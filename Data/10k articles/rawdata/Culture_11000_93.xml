'''AIM25''' is a non-profit making collaborative archive project; a single point of networked access to collection level descriptions of the [[archives]] of over one hundred higher education institutions, learned societies and specialist archives within the [[M25 motorway|M25]] [[Greater London]] area of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="ariadne"&gt;{{cite web |title=The AIM25 Project |url=http://www.ariadne.ac.uk/issue31/aim25/ |accessdate=5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It holds over 7500 collection level descriptions on subjects including social sciences, politics, social and economic history, women's history and military history. Each description on AIM25 provides a link to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#ARCHON directory|ARCHON]] which gives contact details of the repository holding that archive.

AIM25 follows [[ISAD(G)]] and is interoperable with [[Encoded Archival Description]], [[Open Archives Initiative]] and [[Dublin Core]]. AIM25 is based at [[King's College London]] and is freely available to all. Partner institutions update the records for their holdings and collection level descriptions are indexed at King's College London using personal, corporate, place names and subject thesauri.&lt;ref name="ariadne"/&gt;
AIM25 is freely available and forms part of the UK national network of archives.

The relaunched interface has [[Web 2.0]] features including a [[tag cloud]], [[RSS]] feeds and space for the upload of images.

The project was initially funded by the [[Research Support Libraries Programme]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rslp.ac.uk/Projects/research/30.htm |title=RSLP Projects: AIM25 - Archives in London and the M25 area |accessdate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307174258/http://www.rslp.ac.uk/Projects/research/30.htm |archivedate=7 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''American football''', referred to as '''football''' in the United States and Canada and also known as '''gridiron''',{{refn|group=nb|The terms "[[gridiron football]]" and "gridiron" are sometimes used as synonyms for American football,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.macmillandictionary.com/us/dictionary/american/gridiron "Gridiron"], ''[[Macmillan English Dictionary for Advanced Learners|MacMillan Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and are also sometimes used in a broader sense that includes [[Canadian football]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football |title=gridiron football (sport)|work = Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=britannica.com |accessdate=13 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is a team sport played by two teams of eleven players on a rectangular [[American football field|field]] with goalposts at each end.  The [[offense (sports)|offense]], which is the team controlling the oval-shaped [[Football (ball)#American and Canadian football|football]], attempts to advance down the field by [[Rush (gridiron football)|running]] with or [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|passing]] the ball, while the defense, which is the team without control of the ball, aims to stop the offense's advance and aims to take control of the ball for themselves. The offense must advance at least ten yards in four [[Down (gridiron football)|downs]], or plays, and otherwise they [[turnover on downs|turn over]] the football to the defense; if the offense succeeds in advancing ten yards or more, they are given a new set of four downs. Points are primarily scored by advancing the ball into the opposing team's [[end zone]] for a [[touchdown]] or kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a [[field goal]]. The team with the most points at the end of a game wins.

American football evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of [[association football]] (known in the U.S. as soccer) and [[rugby football]]. The first match of American football was played on [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|November 6, 1869]], between two college teams, [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], under rules based on the association football rules of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scarletknights.com/sports/2017/6/28/points-of-pride.aspx|title=The Official Site of Rutgers Athletics|website=www.scarletknights.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the latter half of the 1870s, colleges playing association football switched to the [[rugby union|Rugby Union code]], which allowed carrying the ball. A set of rule changes drawn up from [[1880 college football season|1880]] onward by [[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football", established the [[snap (gridiron football)|snap]], eleven-player teams, and the concept of downs; later rule changes legalized the [[forward pass]], created the [[neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]], and specified the size and shape of the football. The sport [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|is closely related]] to [[Canadian football]], which evolved parallel and contemporary to the American game, and most of the features that distinguish American football from rugby and soccer are also present in Canadian football.

American football as a whole is the most popular [[sport in the United States]]. The most popular forms of the game are [[Professional football (gridiron)|professional]] and [[college football]], with the other major levels being [[high school football|high school]] and youth football. {{as of|2012}}, nearly 1.1&amp;nbsp;million high school athletes and 70,000 college athletes play the sport in the United States annually, almost all of them men, [[women's American football|with a few exceptions]]. The [[National Football League]], the most popular American football league, has the [[List of sports attendance figures#Top leagues in total attendance|highest average attendance of any professional sports league in the world]]; its championship game, the [[Super Bowl]], ranks among the most-watched club sporting events in the world, and the league has an annual revenue of around US$10&amp;nbsp;billion.

==History==
{{Main|History of American football}}
{{History of American football}}

===Early history===
American football evolved from the sports of association football (soccer) and [[rugby football]]. Rugby football, like American football, is a sport where two competing teams vie for control of a ball, which can be kicked through a set of goalposts or run into the opponent's goal area to score points.&lt;ref name="The basics of rugby union"&gt;{{cite web|title=The basics of rugby union|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/rules_and_equipment/4200680.stm|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered to be the first American football game was played on [[1869 New Jersey vs. Rutgers football game|November 6, 1869]], between [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[Princeton Tigers football|Princeton]], two college teams. The game was played between two teams of 25 players each and used a round ball that could not be picked up or carried. It could, however, be kicked or batted with the feet, hands, head or sides, with the ultimate goal being to advance it into the opponent's goal. Rutgers won the game 6 goals to 4.&lt;ref name="Rutgers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp|title=Rutgers – The Birthplace of Intercollegiate Football|publisher=[[Rutgers University]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924154500/http://www.scarletknights.com/football/history/first-game.asp|archivedate=September 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="No Christian End"&gt;{{cite journal|title=No Christian End! The Beginnings of Football in America|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/articles/No_Christian_End.pdf|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collegiate play continued for several years in which matches were played using the rules of the host school. Representatives of Yale, [[Columbia University|Columbia]], Princeton and Rutgers met on October 19, 1873 to create a standard set of rules for all schools to adhere to. Teams were set at 20 players each, and fields of {{convert|400 x 250|ft|m}} were specified. Harvard abstained from the conference, as they favored a rugby-style game that allowed running with the ball.&lt;ref name="No Christian End" /&gt; After playing McGill University using both Canadian and American rules, the Harvard players preferred the Canadian style having only 11 men on the field, running the ball without having to be chased by an opponent, the forward pass, tackling, and using an oblong instead of a round ball.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcinet.ca/en/2015/05/14/history-may-14-1874-how-canada-created-american-football/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcgill.ca/channels/news/date-history-first-football-game-was-may-14-1874-106694&lt;/ref&gt;

An 1875 Harvard-Yale game played under rugby-style rules was observed by two impressed Princeton athletes. These players introduced the sport to Princeton, a feat the [[Professional Football Researchers Association]] compared to "selling [[refrigerator]]s to [[Eskimo]]s."&lt;ref name="No Christian End" /&gt; Princeton, Harvard, Yale and Columbia then agreed to intercollegiate play using a form of [[rugby union]] rules with a modified scoring system.&lt;ref name="Camp and His Followers" /&gt; These schools formed the Intercollegiate Football Association, although Yale did not join until 1879. Yale player [[Walter Camp]], now regarded as the "Father of American Football",&lt;ref name="Camp and His Followers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NFL1869" /&gt; secured rule changes in 1880 that reduced the size of each team from 15 to 11 players and instituted the [[snap (gridiron football)|snap]] to replace the chaotic and inconsistent [[scrum (rugby)|scrum]].&lt;ref name="Camp and His Followers"/&gt;

===Evolution of the game===
[[File:Walter Camp - Project Gutenberg eText 18048.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Walter Camp standing by the railing on a bridge|A photograph of [[Walter Camp]], the "Father of American Football", taken in 1878 when Camp was captain of [[Yale]]'s football team]]

The introduction of the snap resulted in unexpected consequences. Prior to the snap, the strategy had been to punt if a scrum resulted in bad field position. However, a group of Princeton players realized that, as the snap was uncontested, they now could hold the ball indefinitely to prevent their opponent from scoring. In 1881, both teams in a game between Yale-Princeton used this strategy to maintain their undefeated records. Each team held the ball, gaining no ground, for an entire half, resulting in a 0–0 tie. This "block game" proved extremely unpopular with the spectators and fans of both teams.&lt;ref name="Camp and His Followers" /&gt;

A rule change was necessary to prevent this strategy from taking hold, and a reversion to the scrum was considered. However, Camp successfully proposed a rule in 1882 that limited each team to three [[down (gridiron football)|downs]], or tackles, to advance the ball five yards. Failure to advance the ball the required distance within those three downs would result in control of the ball being forfeited to the other team. This change effectively made American football a separate sport from rugby, and the resulting five-yard lines added to the field to measure distances made it resemble a [[gridiron (cooking)|gridiron]] in appearance. Other major rule changes included a reduction of the field size to {{convert|110 x 53.333|yd|m}}, and the adoption of a scoring system that awarded four points for a touchdown, two for a safety and a [[Conversion (gridiron football)|goal following a touchdown]], and five for a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|goal from field]]; additionally, tackling below the waist was legalized.&lt;ref name="Camp and His Followers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.com/articles/Camp_And_Followers.pdf|title=Camp and His Followers|publisher=[[Professional Football Researchers Association]]|accessdate=November 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last, and arguably most important innovation, which would at last make American football uniquely "American", was the legalization of interference, or [[Blocking (American football)|blocking]], a tactic which was highly illegal under the rugby-style rules.

[[File:WCMorris Spokesman-Review cartoons 099 (1).jpg|thumb|right|1908 cartoon (by [[William Charles Morris|W.C. Morris]]) highlighting the dangers that were associated with the sport]]
Despite these new rules, football remained a violent sport. Dangerous mass-formations, which involved interlocking interference, like the [[flying wedge]] resulted in serious injuries and deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett (1976), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; A 1905 peak of 19 fatalities nationwide resulted in a threat by President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to abolish the game unless major changes were made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lewis |first=Guy M. |year=1969 |title=Teddy Roosevelt's Role in the 1905 Football Controversy |journal=The Research Quarterly |volume=40 |pages=717–724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, sixty-two colleges and universities met in New York City to discuss rule changes on December 28, 1905, and these proceedings resulted in the formation of the Intercollegiate Athletic Association of the United States, later named the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA).&lt;ref name=NCAA&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the NCAA|publisher=[[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]|url=https://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html|accessdate=November 24, 2012|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070430205324/http://www.ncaa.org/about/history.html|archivedate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal [[forward pass]] was introduced in 1906, although its impact was initially limited due to the restrictions placed on its use. Other rule changes introduced that year included the reduction of the time of play from 70 to 60 minutes and the increase of the distance required for a first down from 5 to {{convert|10|yd|m}}. To reduce infighting and dirty play between teams, the [[Neutral zone (gridiron football)|neutral zone]] was created along the width of the football.&lt;ref name="Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever: 1906"&gt;{{cite journal|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928221224/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2014|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/06-An-209.pdf|title=Blondy Wallace and the Biggest Football Scandal Ever: 1906|last1=Braunwart|first1=Bob|last2=Carroll|first2=Bob|journal=The Coffin Corner|accessdate=November 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scoring was also adjusted: field goals were lowered to three points in 1909&lt;ref name=NFL1869&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL History 1869–1910|publisher=[[NFL.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102045951/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910#1892 |archivedate=January 2, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1869-1910#1892 |deadurl=no |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; and touchdowns were raised to six points in 1912.&lt;ref name=NFL1911&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL History 1911–1920 |publisher=[[NFL.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115043331/http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920#1920 |archivedate=January 15, 2008 |accessdate=November 24, 2012 |url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1911-1920#1920 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The field was also reduced to {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, but two 10-yard-long end zones were created, and teams were given four downs instead of three to advance the ball {{convert|10|yd|m}}.&lt;ref name="Danzig1956"&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of American Football: Its Great Teams, Players, and Coaches|last=Danzig |first=Allison |authorlink= |year=1956 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |isbn= |pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[roughing the passer]] penalty was implemented in 1914, and eligible players were first allowed to catch the ball anywhere on the field in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Vancil (2000), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professional era===
[[File:Pudge heffelfinger.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|alt=Photo of William Heffelfinger|[[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]], widely regarded as the first professional football player]]

On November 12, 1892, [[William Heffelfinger|William "Pudge" Heffelfinger]] was paid $500 to play a game for the [[Allegheny Athletic Association]] in a match against the [[Pittsburgh Athletic Club (football)|Pittsburgh Athletic Club]]. This is the first recorded instance of a player being [[Professional football (gridiron)|paid to participate in a game of American football]], although many athletic clubs in the 1880s offered indirect benefits, such as helping players attain employment, giving out trophies or watches that players could pawn for money, or paying double in expense money. Despite these extra benefits, the game had a strict sense of amateurism at the time, and direct payment to players was frowned upon, if not outright prohibited.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;{{cite web|title=The Birth of Pro Football |publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] |url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.jsp |accessdate=March 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116215456/http://www.profootballhof.com/history/general/birth.jsp |archivedate=November 16, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, professional play became increasingly common, and with it came rising salaries and unpredictable player movement, as well as the illegal payment of college players who were still in school. The [[National Football League]] (NFL), a group of professional teams that was originally established in 1920 as the American Professional Football Association, aimed to solve these problems. This new league's stated goals included an end to bidding wars over players, prevention of the use of college players, and abolition of the practice of paying players to leave another team.&lt;ref name="The First 25 Years"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clary|first=Jack|year=1994|title=The First 25 Years|journal=The Coffin Corner|volume=16|issue=4|pages=1, 4–5|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-04-570.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140928221312/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-04-570.pdf|archivedate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922, the NFL had established itself as the premier professional football league.&lt;ref&gt;Jozsa (2004), pp. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dominant form of football at the time was played at the [[college football|collegiate level]], but the upstart NFL received a boost to its legitimacy in 1925 when an NFL team, the [[Pottsville Maroons]], defeated a team of [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] all-stars in an [[1925 NFL Championship controversy#Background|exhibition game]].&lt;ref name="The Curse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/2007-01-11/news/the-curse/full|title=The Curse|last=Nelson|first=Robert|date=January 11, 2007|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|accessdate=January 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A greater emphasis on the passing game helped professional football to further distinguish itself from the college game during the late 1930s.&lt;ref name="The First 25 Years" /&gt; Football in general became increasingly popular following the [[1958 NFL Championship game]], a match between the [[Baltimore Colts]] and the [[New York Giants]] that is still referred to as the "Greatest Game Ever Played". The game, a 23–17 overtime victory by the Colts, was seen by millions of television viewers and had a major impact on the popularity of the sport. This, along with the innovations introduced by the new [[American Football League]] (AFL) in the early 1960s, helped football to become the most popular sport in the United States by the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="Greatest game ever played"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/release.aspx?release_id=1805|title=Greatest game ever played|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rival [[American Football League]] arose in 1960 and challenged the NFL's dominance. The AFL began in relative obscurity but eventually thrived, with an initial television contract with the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. The AFL's existence forced the conservative NFL to expand to Dallas and Minnesota in an attempt to destroy the new league. Meanwhile, the AFL introduced many new features to Professional Football in the United States: official time on the scoreboard clock, rather than on a watch in the referee's pocket, as the NFL did; optional two-point conversions by pass or run after touchdowns; names on the jerseys of players; and several others, including expansion of the role of minority players, actively recruited by the league in contrast to the NFL. The AFL also signed several star college players that had also been drafted by NFL teams. Competition for players heated up in 1965, when the AFL [[New York Jets]] signed rookie [[Joe Namath]] to a then-record US$437,000 contract. A five-year, $40&amp;nbsp;million [[NBC]] television contract followed, which helped to sustain the young league. The bidding war for players ended in 1966, when NFL owners approached the AFL regarding a merger, and the two leagues agreed on [[AFL–NFL merger|one]] that would take full effect in 1970. This agreement provided for a common draft that would take place each year, and it instituted an annual World Championship game to be played between the champions of each league. That game began play at the end of the 1966 season. Once the merger was completed, it was no longer a championship game between two leagues, and reverted to the NFL championship game, which came to be known as the [[Super Bowl]].&lt;ref name="The Second 25 Years"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clary|first=Jack|year=1994|title=The Second 25 Years|journal=The Coffin Corner|volume=16|issue=5|pages=4–5|url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-05-575.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019125833/http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/16-05-575.pdf|archivedate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

College football maintained a tradition of postseason [[bowl games]]. Each bowl game would be associated with a particular conference, and earning a spot in a bowl game was the reward for winning a conference. This arrangement was profitable, but it tended to prevent the two top-ranked teams from meeting in a true national championship game, as they would normally be committed to the bowl games of their respective conferences. Several systems have been used since 1992 to determine a national champion of college football. The first was the [[Bowl Coalition]], in place from 1992 to 1994. This was replaced in 1995 by the [[Bowl Alliance]], which gave way in 1997 to the [[Bowl Championship Series]] (BCS).&lt;ref name=BCS&gt;{{cite web | title = BCS Chronology |publisher=FOX Sports on MSN| year = 2006 | url = http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history | accessdate =March 19, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113132437/http://www.bcsfootball.org/bcsfb/history|archivedate=January 13, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BCS arrangement proved to be [[BCS controversies|controversial]], and was replaced in 2014 by the [[College Football Playoff]] (CFP).&lt;ref name="Presidents get playoff plan right"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/8099205/college-football-time-celebrate-approval-four-team-playoff|title=Presidents get playoff plan right|author=[[Gene Wojciechowski|Wojciechowski, Jean]]|date=June 26, 2012|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ralph D.

===Offensive unit===
The role of the offensive unit is to advance the football down the field with the ultimate goal of scoring a [[touchdown]].&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/other_sports/american_football/3192002.stm|title=NFL in a nutshell|date=October 19, 2005|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive team must line up in a legal [[Formation (American football)|formation]] before they can snap the ball. An offensive formation is considered illegal if there are more than four players in the [[Glossary of American football#B|backfield]] or fewer than five players numbered 50–79 on the offensive line.&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 15"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, pp. 21-24"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 57-58"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–58.&lt;/ref&gt; Players can temporarily line up in a position whose eligibility is different from what their number permits as long as they immediately report the change to the referee, who then informs the defensive team of the change.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, pp. 36, 40"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp. 36, 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Neither team's players, with the exception of the snapper, are allowed to line up in or cross the neutral zone until the ball is snapped.

[[File:Hurricanes Quarterback.JPG|thumb|A quarterback for the [[Kiel Baltic Hurricanes]] under center, ready to take the snap]]
The main backfield positions are the [[quarterback]] (QB), [[Halfback (American football)|halfback/tailback]] (HB/TB) and [[fullback (gridiron football)|fullback]] (FB). The quarterback is the leader of the offense. Either the quarterback or a coach calls the plays. Quarterbacks typically inform the rest of the offense of the play in the [[Huddle#American football|huddle]] before the team lines up. The quarterback lines up behind the center to take the snap and then hands the ball off, throws it or runs with it.&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /&gt;

The primary role of the halfback, also known as the running back or tailback, is to carry the ball on running plays. Halfbacks may also serve as receivers. Fullbacks tend to be larger than halfbacks and function primarily as blockers, but they are sometimes used as runners in short-yardage situations&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/football-players-roles-in-team-offense-and-defense.html|title=Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are seldom used in passing situations.&lt;ref name="Fullbacks back en vogue"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=pasquarelli_len&amp;id=5238185|title=Fullbacks back en vogue|last=Pasquarelli|first=Len|date=June 1, 2010|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Lineman (American football)#Offensive line|offensive line]] (OL) consists of several players whose primary function is to [[Blocking (American football)|block]] members of the defensive line from tackling the ball carrier on running plays or [[Quarterback sack|sacking]] the quarterback on passing plays.&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt; The leader of the offensive line is the [[Center (gridiron football)|center]] (C), who is responsible for snapping the ball to the quarterback, blocking,&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt; and for making sure that the other linemen do their jobs during the play.&lt;ref name="Centers: The Unsung Heroes of Football"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.active.com/football/Articles/Centers-The-Unsung-Heroes-of-Football|title=Centers: The Unsung Heroes of Football|last=Wood|first=Ryan|publisher=Active.com|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On either side of the center are the [[Guard (American and Canadian football)|guards]] (G), while [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)#Offensive tackle|tackles]] (T) line up outside the guards.

The principal receivers are the [[wide receiver]]s (WR) and the [[tight end]]s (TE).&lt;ref name="Football's Offensive Team: The Receivers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/footballs-offensive-team-the-receivers.html|title=Football's Offensive Team: The Receivers|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide receivers line up on or near the line of scrimmage, split outside the line. The main goal of the wide receiver is to catch passes thrown by the quarterback,&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt; but they may also function as decoys or as blockers during running plays. Tight ends line up outside the tackles and function both as receivers and as blockers.&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt;

===Defensive unit===
[[File:Arian Foster fumble.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dallas Cowboys]] defensive players force [[Houston Texans]] running back [[Arian Foster]] to fumble the ball]]
The role of the defense is to prevent the offense from scoring by [[Tackle (football move)#American and Canadian football|tackling]] the ball carrier or by forcing [[Turnover (gridiron football)|turnovers]] ([[interception]]s or [[fumble]]s).&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /&gt;

The [[Lineman (American football)#Defensive line|defensive line]] (DL) consists of [[defensive end]]s (DE) and [[Tackle (American and Canadian football)#Defensive tackle|defensive tackle]]s (DT). Defensive ends line up on the ends of the line, while defensive tackles line up inside, between the defensive ends. The primary responsibilities of defensive ends and defensive tackles is to stop running plays on the outside and inside, respectively, to pressure the quarterback on passing plays, and to occupy the line so that the [[linebacker]]s can break through.&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt;

[[File:Brent Grimes-Hamburg Sea Devils.jpg|thumb|left|Cornerback [[Brent Grimes]] of the [[Hamburg Sea Devils]] intercepts a pass]]
Linebackers line up behind the defensive line but in front of the defensive backfield. They are divided into two types: middle linebackers (MLB) and outside linebackers (OLB). Linebackers are the defensive leaders and call the defensive plays. Their diverse roles include defending the run, pressuring the quarterback, and guarding backs, wide receivers and tight ends in the passing game.&lt;ref name="Football's Defensive Team: The Linebackers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/footballs-defense-team-the-linebackers.html|title=Football's Defensive Team: The Linebackers|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[defensive back]]field, often called the secondary, consists of [[cornerback]]s (CB) and [[Safety (gridiron football position)|safeties]] (S). Safeties are themselves divided into free safeties (FS) and strong safeties (SS).&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt; Cornerbacks line up outside the defensive formation, typically opposite of a receiver so as to be able to cover him, while safeties line up between the cornerbacks but farther back in the secondary. Safeties are the last line of defense, and are responsible for stopping deep passing plays as well as running plays.&lt;ref name="Football Players' Roles in Team Offense and Defense" /&gt;
{{-}}

===Special teams unit===
[[File:Jeff Reed kickoff 2006.jpg|thumb|Kicker [[Jeff Reed (American football)|Jeff Reed]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] executes a kickoff]]
The special teams unit is responsible for all kicking plays. The special teams unit of the team in control of the ball will try and execute [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] (FG) attempts, [[Punt (gridiron football)|punt]]s and [[Kickoff (gridiron football)|kickoff]]s, while the opposing team's unit will aim to block or return them.&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /&gt;

Three positions are specific to the field goal and [[Conversion (gridiron football)|PAT (point-after-touchdown)]] unit: the [[placekicker]] (K or PK), [[Holder (American football)|holder]] (H) and [[long snapper]] (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the ball is kicked off of a tee; however, a holder may be used in certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the ball is known as the [[kickoff returner]] (KR).&lt;ref name="The Role of Special Teams in a Football Game"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-role-of-special-teams-in-a-football-game.html|title=The Role of Special Teams in a Football Game|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions specific to punt plays are the [[punter (football)|punter]] (P), long snapper, [[upback]] and [[Gunner (American football)|gunner]]. The long snapper snaps the football directly to the punter, who then drops and kicks it before it hits the ground. Gunners line up split outside the line and race down the field, aiming to tackle the [[punt returner]] (PR) – the player that catches the punt. Upbacks line up a short distance behind the line of scrimmage, providing additional protection to the punter.&lt;ref name="Football Special Teams: Players on a Punt Team"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/football-special-teams-players-on-a-punt-team.html|title=Football Special Teams: Players on a Punt Team|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=January 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
[[File:2006 Navy - Tusla.jpg|thumb|right|A player for the [[Navy Midshipmen football|Navy Midshipmen]] (dark jersey) scores a touchdown while a defender from the [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa Golden Hurricane]] (in white) looks on. The goal line is marked by the small orange pylon]]
In American football, the winner is the team that has scored the most points at the end of the game. There are multiple ways to score in a football game.

The [[touchdown]] (TD), worth six points, is the most valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live ball is advanced into, caught in, or recovered in the end zone of the opposing team.&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /&gt; The scoring team then attempts a [[try]] or [[Conversion (gridiron football)|conversion]], more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.

A PAT is most commonly attempted from the two- or three-yard line, depending on the level of play. If scored by a placekick or dropkick through the goal posts, it is worth one point, and is typically called the extra point.&lt;ref name="Duke"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sackrowitz|first=Harold|year=2000|title=Refining the Point(s)-After-Touchdown Decision|journal=Department of Statistical Science|volume=13|issue=3|pages=29–30, 33–34|url=http://www.stat.duke.edu/~dalene/chance/chanceweb/133.sackrowitz.pdf|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a team may elect to run a single play from scrimmage and attempt, once again, to achieve what would normally be considered a touchdown. In such a case, a successful attempt is called the [[two-point conversion]]&lt;ref name="Duke" /&gt; and is worth two points. For the 2015 season, the NFL adopted a rules on PATs that stated during an extra point the placekick must be snapped from the 15-yard line and on extra points if the kick is blocked and the opposing team returns it into the end zone or if during a two-point conversion the ball is fumbled or intercepted and returned to the end zone the opposing team will score two points. No points are awarded on a failed extra point or two-point conversion attempt, although under a rare set of circumstances it is possible to score a safety, worth one point, if the defense takes the ball back into its own end zone and is downed there.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 56-57"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p.&amp;nbsp;56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 77-79"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;77–79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 65-66"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the extra point is almost always successful in professional play and is only slightly less successful at amateur levels, while the two-point conversion is a much riskier play with a higher probability of failure; accordingly, extra point attempts are far more common than two-point conversion attempts.&lt;ref name="Duke"/&gt;

A [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]] (FG), worth three points, is scored when the ball is placekicked or dropkicked through the uprights and over the crossbars of the defense's goalposts.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 57-59"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;57–59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 79-80"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;79–80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 66"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.&lt;ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/beginnersguidetofootball|title=Beginner's Guide to Football|publisher=[[National Football League]]|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Safety (gridiron football score)|safety]] is scored when the ball carrier is tackled in their own end zone. Safeties are worth two points, which are awarded to the defense.&lt;ref name="NFL in a nutshell" /&gt; In addition, the team that conceded the safety must kick the ball to the scoring team via a [[Safety kick#Resuming play after a safety|free kick]].&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 60"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Field and equipment===

[[File:Edward Jones Dome endzone view.jpg|left|thumb|A football field as seen from behind one end zone. The tall, yellow goal posts mark where the ball must pass for a successful field goal or extra point. The large, rectangular area marked with the team name is the end zone]]

Football games are played on a rectangular [[American football field|field]] that measures {{convert|120|yd|m}} long and {{convert|53.33|yd|m}} wide. Lines marked along the ends and sides of the field are known respectively as the end lines and [[sidelines]], and [[Goal line (American football)|goal line]]s are marked {{convert|10|yd|m}} inward from each end line. Weighted pylons are placed on the inside corner of the intersections of the goal lines and end lines.

White markings on the field identify the distance from the end zone. Inbound lines, or [[hash marks]], are short parallel lines that mark off {{convert|1|yd|m}} increments. [[Yard lines]], which can run the width of the field, are marked every {{convert|5|yd|m}}. A one-yard-wide line is placed at each end of the field; this line is marked at the center of the two-yard line in professional play and at the three-yard line in college play. Numerals that display the distance from the closest goal line in yards are placed on both sides of the field every ten yards.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. v, 1"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p. v, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 18-19, 23–24"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–19, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 11-12, 13, 28"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12, 13, 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goalposts]] are located at the center of the plane of each of the two end lines.

===Duration and time stoppages===
Football games last for a total of 60 minutes in professional and college play and are divided into two-halves of 30 minutes and four-quarters of 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 14"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 45"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; High school football games are 48 minutes in length with two-halves of 24 minutes and four-quarters of 12 minutes.&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 38-39"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-halves are separated by a [[half-time|halftime]] period, and the first and third quarters are also followed by a short break.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 45" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 39"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the start of the game, the referee and [[captain (sports)|team captains]] for each team meet at midfield for a [[coin toss]]. The visiting team is allowed to call 'heads' or 'tails'; the winner of the toss is allowed to decide between choosing whether to receive or kick off the ball or choosing which goal they want to defend, but they can also defer their choice until the second half. The losing team, unless the winning team decides to defer, is allowed to choose the option the winning team did not select, and receives the option to receive, kick, or select a goal to defend to begin the second half. Most teams choose to receive or defer, because choosing to kick the ball to start the game would allow the other team to choose which goal to defend.&lt;ref name="TMQ's all-haiku NFL preview"&gt;{{cite web|title=TMQ's all-haiku NFL preview|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=easterbrook/080902|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|accessdate=October 1, 2013|author=[[Gregg Easterbrook|Easterbrook, Gregg]]|date=September 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teams switch goals following the first and third quarters.&lt;ref name="How Football Game Time Is Measured in Quarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-football-game-time-is-measured-in-quarters.html|title=How Football Game Time Is Measured in Quarters|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=December 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a down is in progress when a quarter ends, play continues until the down is completed.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 14-18"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;14–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 47-53"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;47–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 38-45"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–45&lt;/ref&gt;

If the play clock expires before the ball has been snapped or free-kicked, a delay of game foul is called on the offense. The play clock is set to 40 seconds in professional and college football and to 25 seconds in high school play or following certain administrative stoppages in the former levels of play.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 14-18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 41, 46–47"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 41, 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 36, 45"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 36, 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advancing the ball and downs===
[[File:Delhomme goes deep.jpg|thumb|left|[[Carolina Panthers]] quarterback [[Jake Delhomme]] (number 17) in the motion of throwing a forward pass]]
There are two main ways that the offense can advance the ball: [[Rush (gridiron football)|running]] and [[Forward pass#American and Canadian football|passing]]. In a typical play, the quarterback calls the play, and the center passes the ball backwards and under their legs to the quarterback in a process known as the [[Snap (American and Canadian football)|snap]]. The quarterback then either hands the ball off to a back, throws the ball or runs with it. The play ends when the player with the ball is tackled or goes out of bounds, or a pass hits the ground without a player having caught it. A forward pass can only be legally attempted if the passer is behind the line of scrimmage.&lt;ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football" /&gt; In the NFL, a down also ends if the runner's helmet comes off.&lt;ref name="When a runner's helmet comes off, he's down"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Michael David|title=When a runner's helmet comes off, he's down|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/11/16/when-a-runners-helmet-comes-off-hes-down/|publisher=[[Profootballtalk.com]]|accessdate=October 19, 2014|date=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offense is given a series of four plays, known as [[Down (American and Canadian football)|downs]]. If the offense advances ten or more yards in the four downs, they are awarded a new set of four downs. If they fail to advance ten yards, possession of the football is turned over to the defense. In most situations, if the offense reaches their fourth down they will [[Punt (American football)|punt]] the ball to the other team, which forces them to begin their drive from further down the field; if they are in [[field goal range]], they might also attempt to score a field goal.&lt;ref name="Beginner's Guide to Football" /&gt; A group of officials, the chain crew, keeps track of both the downs and the distance measurements.&lt;ref name="The Orchestration of the Chain Gang"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/01/sports/football/01chainside.html|title=The Orchestration of the Chain Gang|last=Branch|first=John|date=December 31, 2008|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On television, a yellow line is electronically superimposed on the field to show the first down line to the viewing audience.&lt;ref name="Yellow line"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/outdoors/sports/4301993|title=The Tech Behind the Football's Broadcast-Only First Down Line|last=St. John|first=Allan|date=December 18, 2009|publisher=[[Popular Mechanics]]|accessdate=November 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kicking===
[[File:MasonCrosbyFG-Edit.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Green Bay Packers]] placekicker [[Mason Crosby]] attempts a field goal by kicking the ball from the hands of a holder. This is the standard method to score field goals or extra points.&lt;ref name="PFRA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The last dropkick" /&gt;]]

There are two categories of kicks in football: scrimmage kicks, which can be executed by the offensive team on any down from behind or on the line of scrimmage,&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 50"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 34"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 32"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; and free kicks.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 6"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 30"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 27"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The free kicks are the [[Kickoff (American football)|kickoff]], which starts the first and third quarters and overtime and follows a try attempt or a successful field goal, and the [[Safety kick#Resuming play after a safety|safety kick]], which follows a safety.&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 34"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, pp. 8-9"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 31-32"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

On a kickoff, the ball is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in professional and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can be placed on the ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has been touched by any member of the receiving team.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, pp. 29-30"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 61-64"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 15, 46, 52–53"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 15, 46, 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of scrimmage kicks are place kicks, drop kicks, and punts. Only place kicks and drop kicks can score points.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 57-59" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, p. 79-80" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 66" /&gt; The place kick is the standard method used to score points,&lt;ref name="PFRA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogrogian|first=John|year=1999|title=The Last Drop Kick?|journal=The Coffin Corner|volume=21|issue=6|url=http://profootballresearchers.com/archives/Website_Files/Coffin_Corner/21-06-832.pdf|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; because the pointy shape of the football makes it difficult to reliably drop kick.&lt;ref name="PFRA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The last dropkick"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/hof/release.aspx?release_id=1481|title=The last dropkick|publisher=[[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]|accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the ball has been kicked from a scrimmage kick, it can be advanced by the kicking team only if it is caught or recovered behind the line of scrimmage. If it is touched or recovered by the kicking team beyond this line, it becomes dead at the spot where it was touched.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, pp. 33-34, 50–53"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34, 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 55-56, 63–64"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;55–56, 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 49, 53–54"&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 49, 53–54.&lt;/ref&gt; The kicking team is prohibited from interfering with the receiver's opportunity to catch the ball, and the receiving team has the option of signaling for a [[fair catch]]. This prohibits the defense from blocking into or tackling the receiver, but the play ends as soon as the ball is caught and the ball may not be advanced.&lt;ref name="NFL Rules 2012, p. 7"&gt;NFL Rules 2012, pp. 7, 54–55.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 30, 66–67"&gt;NCAA Rules 2011–2012, pp. 30, 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NFHS Rules 2012, p. 2756, "&gt;NFHS Rules 2012, pp. 27, 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Officials and fouls===

[[File:First down measurement at EWU at Cal 2009-09-12.JPG|thumb|Officials use the chains to measure for a first down. Here, the ball is just short of the pole and therefore short of a first down.]]

Officials are responsible for enforcing game rules and monitoring the clock. All officials carry a [[whistle]] and wear black-and-white striped shirts and black hats except for the referee, whose hat is white. Each carries a [[Penalty flag|weighted yellow flag]] that is thrown to the ground to signal that a [[Penalty (gridiron football)|foul]] has been called. An official who spots multiple fouls will throw their hat as a secondary signal.&lt;ref name="American Football Officials"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/american-football-officials.html|title=American Football Officials|last1=Long|first1=Howie|last2=Czarnecki|first2=John|authorlink1=Howie Long|publisher=[[For Dummies|Dummies.com]]|accessdate=November 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seven officials on the field are each tasked with a different set of responsibilities:&lt;ref name="American Football Officials" /&gt;
*The '''referee''' is positioned behind and to the side of the offensive backs. The referee is charged with oversight and control of the game and is the authority on the score, the down number, and any and all rule interpretations in discussions between the other officials. The referee announces all penalties and discusses the infraction with the offending team's captain, monitors for illegal hits against the quarterback, makes requests for first-down measurements, and notifies the head coach whenever a player is ejected. The referee positions themselves to the passing arm side of the quarterback. In most games, the referee is responsible for spotting the football prior to a play from scrimmage. 
*The '''umpire''' is positioned in the defensive backfield, except in the NFL, where the umpire is positioned lateral to the referee on the opposite side of the formation. The umpire watches play along the line of scrimmage to make sure that no more than 11 offensive players are on the field prior to the snap and that no offensive linemen are [[Ineligible receiver downfield|illegally downfield]] on pass plays. The umpire monitors the contact between offensive and defensive linemen and calls most of the [[Holding (American football)|holding]] penalties. The umpire records the number of timeouts taken and the winner of the coin toss and the game score, assists the referee in situations involving possession of the ball close to the line of scrimmage, determines whether player equipment is legal, and dries wet balls prior to the snap if a game is played in rain.
*The '''back judge''' is positioned deep in the defensive backfield, behind the umpire. The back judge ensures that the defensive team has no more than 11 players on the field and determines whether catches are legal, whether field goal or extra point attempts are good, and whether a [[pass interference]] violation occurred. The back judge is also responsible for the play clock, the time between each play, when a visible play clock is not used. 
*The '''head linesman''' is positioned on one end of the line of scrimmage. The head linesman watches for any line-of-scrimmage and illegal use-of-hands violations and assists the line judge with illegal shift or illegal motion calls. The head linesman also rules on out-of-bounds calls that happen on their side of the field, oversees the chain crew and marks the forward progress of a runner when a play has been whistled dead.
[[File:First down marker.png|thumb|upright|A modern down indicator box is mounted on a pole and is used to mark the current line of scrimmage. The number on the marker is changed using a dial.]]
*The '''side judge''' is positioned twenty yards downfield of the head linesman. The side judge mainly duplicates the functions of the field judge. On field goal and extra point attempts, the side judge is positioned lateral to the umpire. 
*The '''line judge''' is positioned on the end of the line of scrimmage, opposite the head linesman. He or she supervises player substitutions, the line of scrimmage during punts, and game timing. The line judge notifies the referee when time has expired at the end of a quarter and notifies the head coach of the home team when five minutes remain for halftime. In the NFL, the line judge also alerts the referee when [[Two-minute warning|two minutes remain in the half]]. If the clock malfunctions or becomes inoperable, the line judge becomes the official timekeeper.
*The '''field judge''' is positioned twenty yards downfield from the line judge. The field judge monitors and controls the [[play clock]], counts the number of defensive players on the field, and watches for offensive pass interference and illegal use-of-hands violations by offensive players. The field judge also makes decisions regarding catches, recoveries, the ball spot when a player goes out of bounds, and illegal touching of fumbled balls that have crossed the line of scrimmage. On field goal and extra point attempts, the field judge is stationed under the upright opposite the back judge. 
*The '''center judge''' is an eighth official used in the top level of college football. The center judge stands lateral to the referee, the same way the umpire does in the NFL. The center judge is responsible for spotting the football after each play, and has many of the same responsibilities as the referee, except announcing penalties. 
Another set of officials, the [[chain crew]], are responsible for moving the chains. The chains, consisting of two large sticks with a 10-yard-long chain between them, are used to measure for a first down. The chain crew stays on the sidelines during the game, but if requested by the officials they will briefly bring the chains on to the field to measure. A typical chain crew will have at least three people – two members of the chain crew will hold either of the two sticks, while a third will hold the down marker. The down marker, a large stick with a dial on it, is flipped after each play to indicate the current down, and is typically moved to the approximate spot of the ball. The chain crew system has been used for over 100 years and is considered to be an accurate measure of distance, rarely subject to criticism from either side.&lt;ref name="The Orchestration of the Chain Gang"/&gt;

Football is a full-contact sport, and injuries are relatively common. Most injuries occur during training sessions, particularly ones that involve contact between players.&lt;ref name="Sports Medicine" /&gt; To try to prevent injuries, players are required to wear a set of equipment.

===Rival professional leagues===
Several professional football leagues have been formed as rival leagues to the NFL. The most successful rival league was the American Football League (AFL), which existed from 1960 to 1969. The AFL became a significant rival in [[1964 American Football League season|1964]] before signing a five-year, US$36&amp;nbsp;million television deal with NBC. AFL teams began to sign NFL players to contracts, and the league's popularity grew to challenge that of the NFL. The two leagues merged in the [[1970 NFL season|1970 season]], and all AFL teams joined the NFL. An earlier league, the [[All-America Football Conference]], was in play from 1946 to 1949. After the league dissolved, two AAFC teams, the [[Cleveland Browns]] and the [[San Francisco 49ers]], became members of the NFL; another member, the [[Baltimore Colts (1947–50)|Baltimore Colts]] joined the league, but folded after just a year in the NFL.&lt;ref name="Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/news/2001/01/22/afl_history_2/|title=Off-the-field competition yields game-changing merger|last=Cross|first=B.

Other attempts to start rival leagues have been far less successful. The [[World Football League]] (WFL) played for two seasons, in 1974 and 1975, but faced monetary issues so severe that the league could not pay its players. In its second and final season the WFL attempted to establish a stable credit rating, but the league disbanded before its second season could be completed.&lt;ref name="The Day The Money Ran Out"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090543/index.htm|title=The Day The Money Ran Out|last=Johnson|first=William Oscar|date=December 1, 1975|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=March 25, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019095749/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1090543/index.htm|archivedate=October 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Football League]] (USFL) operated for three seasons from 1983 to 1985 but collapsed due to poor business decisions and monetary problems.

The IFAF also organizes the annual International Bowl game.&lt;ref name="Championship Competitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifaf.info/pages/competition|title=Championship Competitions|publisher=[[International Federation of American Football]]|accessdate=January 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the international level, Canada, Mexico, and Japan are considered to be second-tier, while Austria, Germany, and France would rank among a third tier. All of these countries rank far below the United States, which is dominant at the international level.&lt;ref name="Football in Olympics is a dream that could become a reality" /&gt;

Football is not an [[Olympic sport]], but it was a [[demonstration sport]] at the [[American football at the 1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name="Football remains an Olympic long shot"/&gt; The IFAF has received provisional recognition from the [[International Olympic Committee]] (IOC), and a vote on making it an Olympic sport could be held as early as 2017.&lt;ref name="Football takes step toward Olympics, could be medal sport in 2024"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/american-football-provisional-recognition-international-olympic-committee-possible-medal-sport-2024-121013|last1=Marvez|first1=Alex|title=Football takes step toward Olympics, could be medal sport in 2024|publisher=[[Foxsports.com]]|accessdate=June 18, 2015|date=June 2, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204060852/http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/american-football-provisional-recognition-international-olympic-committee-possible-medal-sport-2024-121013|archivedate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several major obstacles hinder the IFAF goal of achieving status as an Olympic sport, such as the predominant participation of men in international play and the short three-week Olympic schedule. Large team sizes are an additional difficulty, due to the Olympics' set limit of 10,500 athletes and coaches. American football also has the issue of global visibility. [[Nigel Melville]], the CEO of [[USA Rugby]], noted that "American football is recognized globally as a sport, but it's not played globally." In order to solve these concerns, major effort has been put into promoting [[flag football]], a modified version of American football, at the international level.&lt;ref name="Football in Olympics is a dream that could become a reality" /&gt;

===Other countries===
In Canada, the game has a significant following – according to a 2013 poll, 21% of respondents said they followed the NFL "very closely" or "fairly closely", making it the third-most followed league behind the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL).&lt;ref name="Super Bowl 2014: Comparing the NFL's popularity in Canada and the U.S."&gt;{{cite web |last=Spurrier |first=Guy |title=Super Bowl 2014: Comparing the NFL's popularity in Canada and the U.S. |url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/01/30/super-bowl-2014-comparing-the-nfls-popularity-in-canada-and-the-u-s/ |work=[[National Post]] |accessdate=April 17, 2014 |date=January 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170525152429/http://news.nationalpost.com/sports/nfl/super-bowl-2014-comparing-the-nfls-popularity-in-canada-and-the-u-s |archivedate=May 25, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; American football also has a long history in Mexico, which was introduced to the sport in 1896.

At the collegiate level there is the Liga Mayor of the ONEFA, a college championship founded in 1930. There is also the CONADEIP Premier Conference, another college competition founded in 2010. American football is the fifth most popular sport in Mexico and the country has the highest rating of the NFL outside the United States.

[[File:NFL_International_Series_2010.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Opening ceremony of the 2010 [[NFL International Series]] at London's [[Wembley Stadium]]]]
Japan was introduced to the sport in 1934 by [[Paul Rusch]], a teacher and Christian missionary who helped establish football teams at three universities in Tokyo. Play was halted during World War II, but began to grow in popularity again after the war. {{as of|2010}}, there are more than 400 high school football teams in Japan, with over 15,000 participants, and over 100 teams play in the Kantoh Collegiate Football Association (KCFA).&lt;ref name="Friday night lights: American football in Japan a high school hit"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jardine|first=Lisa|title=Friday night lights: American football in Japan a high school hit|url=http://travel.cnn.com/tokyo/play/friday-night-lights-japanese-american-football-player-dream-686573|publisher=CNN Travel|accessdate=April 23, 2014|date=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college champion plays the champion of the [[X-League]] (a semi-pro league where teams are financed by corporations) in the [[Rice Bowl]] to determine Japan's national champion.&lt;ref name="Obic captures third straight Rice Bowl"&gt;{{cite web|title=Obic captures third straight Rice Bowl|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2013/01/04/more-sports/obic-captures-third-straight-rice-bowl/|work=[[The Japan Times]]|accessdate=April 23, 2014|date=January 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europe is a major target for expansion of the game by football organizers. In the United Kingdom in the 1980s, the sport was fairly popular, with the 1986 Super Bowl being watched by over 4 million people (about 1 out of every 14 Britons). The sport's popularity faded over the 1990s, coinciding with the establishment of the [[Premier League]]. According to [[BBC America]], there is a "social stigma" surrounding American football in the UK, with many Brits feeling the sport has no right to call itself 'football' due to the small emphasis on kicking.&lt;ref name="Touchdown in the U.K.: Britain's Long-Distance Affair with the NFL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Langford|first=John|title=Touchdown in the U.K.: Britain's Long-Distance Affair with the NFL|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/anglophenia/2014/02/touchdown-u-k-british-nfl-fans-cope-long-distance-love-affair/|publisher=[[BBC America]]. Anglophenia|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=February 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the sport has retained a following in the United Kingdom; the NFL operates a media network in the country, and since 2007 has hosted the [[NFL International Series]] in London. Super Bowl viewership has also rebounded, with over 4.4&amp;nbsp;million Britons watching [[Super Bowl XLVI]].&lt;ref name="Super Bowl caps UK's growing gridiron fever"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Sarah|last2=Hayman-Brown|first2=Isabel|title=Super Bowl caps UK's growing gridiron fever|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/others/super-bowl-caps-uks-growing-gridiron-fever-6423166.html|website=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=June 19, 2015|date=February 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport is played in European countries such as Switzerland, which has American football clubs in every major city,&lt;ref name="The Game Is American, but the View, Alpine"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tagliabue|first=John|title=The Game Is American, but the View, Alpine|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/15/world/europe/15swiss.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 17, 2014|date=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany, where the sport has around 45,000 registered amateur players.&lt;ref name="American football touches down in Germany" /&gt; In Europe, almost all nations have their own leagues, highlighting its importance those of [[Austria]] ([[Austrian Football League]]), Germany ([[German Football League]]), Great Britain ([[BAFA National Leagues]]), France ([[Ligue Élite de Football Américain]]) and Italy ([[Italian Football League]]). But in these countries American football has not yet reached the same level of popularity it has, for example, in North America. There are national teams of [[Austria national American football team|Austria]], [[Finland national American football team|Finland]], [[France national American football team|France]], [[Germany national American football team|Germany]], [[Great Britain national American football team|Great Britain]], [[Hungary national American football team|Hungary]], [[Israel national American football team|Israel]], [[Italy national American football team|Italy]], [[Netherlands national American football team|Netherlands]], [[Poland national American football team|Poland]], [[Romania national American football team|Romania]], [[Russia national American football team|Russia]], [[Serbia national American football team|Serbia]], [[Spain national American football team|Spain]] and [[Sweden national American football team|Sweden]].

In Brazil, American football audience increased 800% between 2013 and 2016, according to [[ESPN]], which is, along to [[Esporte Interativo]], the responsible to the transmission in the country. Brazil's audience is the 3rd of the world, behind only Mexico and United States. NFL leaders visited [[Maracanã Stadium]], in [[Rio de Janeiro]], to verify the field. Rumors were that a [[Pro Bowl]] edition could be held there. One of the reasons of that boom in audience is the [[placekicker]] of [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Cairo Santos]], the first Brazilian player to reach some worldwide success in the sport.&lt;ref name="Crescimento do interesse por futebol americano no Brasil atrai NFL"&gt;{{cite web|last=Macedo|first=Sandro|title=Crescimento do interesse por futebol americano no Brasil atrai NFL|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/esporte/2017/02/1855099-crescimento-do-interesse-por-futebol-americano-no-brasil-atrai-nfl.shtml|work=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|accessdate=April 28, 2017|date=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the sport is already one of the most played around the country, with approximately 130 teams. The [[Superliga Nacional de Futebol Americano]] (National American Football Superleague) is a recently created Brazilian American football league, created and organized by the {{ill|Confederação Brasileira de Futebol Americano|pt}} (Brazilian Confederation of American Football). To 2017, a strongest league will get start in June, including 32 teams around the country, in 4 conferences. In 2017, the famous soccer team [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube]] joined with the 2016 America Cup's champion [[BH Eagles Futebol Americano]], to create the [[Sada Cruzeiro Futebol Americano]]. The recent born team already won his state championship, and for the Brazilian top league already has signed with former NFL's player [[Nic Harris]].

In other countries of South America there was a very important evolution with regard to American Football, since 2006 when has begun the practice of this sport in [[Argentina]]. Currently there are three American Football Leagues in that country: Football Americano Argentina, located in [[Buenos Aires]], which has six teams; Córdoba Football Americano, located in [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], with three teams; Rosario Football League, located in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]], also with three teams. In addition there are teams in the formation stage in several provinces, such as in the province of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]].

In [[Colombia]] the FECOFA (Colombian Federation of American Football) was created. Recently it formalized a strategic alliance with FLAG FOOTBALL COLOMBIA to join efforts and work together looking for the growth and development of American football in all its modalities.

[[Canadian football]], the predominant form of football in Canada, is closely related to American football – both sports developed from rugby, and the two sports are considered to be the chief variants of [[gridiron football]].&lt;ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/212839/gridiron-football|title=Gridiron football|pages=1, 13–14|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two games share a [[Comparison of American and Canadian football|similar set of rules]], there are several key rule differences: for example, in Canadian football the field measures {{convert|150|by|65|yd|m}}, including two 20-yard end zones (for a distance between goal lines of 110 yards),&lt;ref name="Argos, Rogers Centre agree on lease deal through 2017"&gt;{{cite web|title=Argos, Rogers Centre agree on lease deal through 2017|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/football/cfl/argos-rogers-centre-agree-on-lease-deal-through-2017-1.1861980|publisher=[[CBC Sports]]|accessdate=April 19, 2014|date=September 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; teams have three downs instead of four, there are twelve players on each side instead of eleven,&lt;ref name="Behind IDFFL, Canadian players chase football dreams"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staples|first=Andy|title=Behind IDFFL, Canadian players chase football dreams|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130628/canadian-football-recruiting/|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|accessdate=April 19, 2014|date=June 28, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420041857/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/college-football/news/20130628/canadian-football-recruiting/|archivedate=April 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; fair catches are not allowed, and a [[Single (football)|rouge]], worth a single point is scored if the offensive team kicks the ball out of the defense's end zone.&lt;ref name="Head to Head: CFL vs. NFL" /&gt; The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) is the major Canadian league and is the second-most popular sporting league in Canada, behind only the [[National Hockey League]].&lt;ref name="Head to Head: CFL vs. NFL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carillonregina.com/?p=2097|title=Head to Head: CFL vs. NFL|last1=Buchinski|first1=Colin|last2=Neu|first2=Dietrich|date=January 6, 2011|work=[[The Carillon]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major variant of football is [[arena football]], played by the [[Arena Football League]] (AFL).&lt;ref name="Arena football: Is it America's fifth major sport?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-04-13-sw-arena-football_N.htm|title=Arena football: Is it America's fifth major sport?|last=Colston|first=Chris|date=April 15, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arena football has eight-player teams and uses an indoor field {{convert|50|yd|m}} in length, excluding end zones, and {{convert|28.3|yd|m}} wide. Punting is illegal, and kickoffs are attempted from the goal line. Large overhead nets deflect forward passes and kicks that hit them, and deflected kicks are live balls that may be recovered by either team.&lt;ref name="Arena football: The basics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-04-13-arena-football-basics_N.htm|title=Arena football: The basics|date=April 13, 2007|work=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the Arena Football League are what ''[[The New York Times]]'' writer Mike Tanier described as the "most minor of minor leagues:" [[Indoor American football|indoor football]] leagues. Like in arena football, teams in indoor football leagues play in arenas, but games are only attended by a small number of fans, and most players are [[semi-professional]] athletes. Indoor football leagues are unstable, with franchises regularly moving from one league to another or merging with other teams, and teams or entire leagues dissolving entirely. The [[Indoor Football League]], [[National Arena League]], [[Champions Indoor Football]] and [[Arena Pro Football|American Arena League]] are examples of prominent indoor leagues that are active as of 2017.&lt;ref name="Staying in the Game on Football's Fringe"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/28/sports/football/staying-in-the-game-on-footballs-fringe.html|title=Staying in the Game on Football's Fringe|last=Tainer|first=Mike|date=June 27, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=January 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several non-contact variants of American football, such as [[flag football]].&lt;ref name="NFL FLAG football is about fun and fundamentals"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mills|first=Amy|title=NFL FLAG football is about fun and fundamentals|url=http://usafootball.com/blog/fundamentals-and-performance/nfl-flag-football-about-fun-and-fundamentals|publisher=[[USA Football]]|accessdate=April 19, 2014|date=July 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In flag football the ballcarrier is not tackled; instead, defenders aim to pull a flag tied around their waist.&lt;ref name="Proper flag pull takes fast feet and discipline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Musto|first=Adam|title=Proper flag pull takes fast feet and discipline|url=http://usafootball.com/news/coaches/proper-flag-pull-takes-fast-feet-and-discipline|publisher=[[USA Football]]|accessdate=April 19, 2014|date=March 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another variant, [[Touch football (American)|touch football]], simply requires the ballcarrier to be touched to be considered downed. A game of touch football may require that the player be touched with either one or two hands to be considered down, depending on the rules used.&lt;ref name="The 32 Rules of Thanksgiving Touch Football "&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204531404577050370294096452|title=The 32 Rules of Thanksgiving Touch Football |last=Gay|first=Jason|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=January 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antisemitism may be manifested in many ways, ranging from expressions of hatred of or discrimination against individual Jews to organized [[pogrom]]s by mobs, state police, or even military attacks on entire Jewish communities. Although the term did not come into common usage until the 19th century, it is now also applied to historic anti-Jewish incidents. Notable instances of [[Persecution of Jews|persecution]] include the [[Rhineland massacres]] preceding the [[First Crusade]] in 1096, the [[Edict of Expulsion]] from England in 1290, the [[History of the Jews in Spain#Massacres and mass conversions of 1391|massacres of Spanish Jews]] in 1391, the persecutions of the [[Spanish Inquisition]], the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion from Spain]] in 1492, the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising#Jews|Cossack massacres in Ukraine]] from 1648 to 1657, various [[anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire]] between 1821 and 1906, the 1894–1906 [[Dreyfus affair]] in France, [[the Holocaust]] in [[Nazi Germany|German-occupied Europe]] during [[World War II]], [[antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Soviet anti-Jewish policies]], and Arab and Muslim involvement in the [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]].

The root word ''[[Wikt:Semite|Semite]]'' gives the [[misnomer|false impression]] that antisemitism is directed against all [[Semitic people]], ''e.g.'', including [[Arabs]] and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]. The compound word ''antisemite'' was popularized in Germany in 1879{{sfn|Bein|1990|p=595}} as a scientific-sounding term for ''Judenhass'' ("Jew-hatred"),{{sfn|Chanes|2004|p=150}}{{sfn|Rattansi|2007|p=4–5}}{{sfn|Roth|2003|p=30}}{{sfn|Johnston|1983|p=27}}&lt;ref name=laqueur1&gt;{{harvp|Laqueur|2006}}.

[[File:Statuten der Antisemiten-Liga.jpg|thumb|1879 statute of the Antisemitic League]]

The origin of "antisemitic" terminologies is found in the responses of [[Moritz Steinschneider]] to the views of [[Ernest Renan]]. As [[Alex Bein]] writes: "The compound anti-Semitism appears to have been used first by Steinschneider, who challenged Renan on account of his 'anti-Semitic prejudices' [i.e., his derogation of the "Semites" as a [[Race (human categorization)|race]]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cQOn0y8ENg4C&amp;pg=PA594 |last=Bein |first=Alex |author-link=Alex Bein |title=The Jewish Question: Biography of a World Problem |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=1990 |page=594 |isbn=0-8386-3252-1 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avner Falk]] similarly writes: 'The German word ''antisemitisch'' was first used in 1860 by the Austrian Jewish scholar Moritz Steinschneider (1816–1907) in the phrase ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices). Steinschneider used this phrase to characterise the French philosopher Ernest Renan's false ideas about how "[[Semitic people#Ethnicity and race|Semitic races]]" were inferior to "[[Aryan race]]s"'.&lt;ref name="'The ''antisemitisch'' 18 60 (1816-1907) ''antisemitische Vorurteile'' (antisemitic prejudices).

[[Pseudoscience|Pseudoscientific]] theories concerning race, civilization, and "progress" had become quite widespread in Europe in the second half of the 19th century, especially as [[Prussia]]n nationalistic historian [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] did much to promote this form of racism. He coined the phrase "the Jews are our misfortune" which would later be widely used by [[Nazism|Nazis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Poliakov |first=Léon |author-link=Léon Poliakov |title=The History of Anti-Semitism, Vol. 3: From Voltaire to Wagner |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2003 |page=404 |isbn=978-0-8122-1865-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Falk, Treitschke uses the term "Semitic" almost synonymously with "Jewish", in contrast to Renan's use of it to refer to a whole range of peoples,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Falk |first=Avner |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VWL4ja2BbnEC&amp;pg=PA21 |title=Anti-Semitism: A History and Psychoanalysis of Contemporary Hatred |location=Westport, Conn. |publisher=Praeger |page=21 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; based generally on linguistic criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brustein |first=William I. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hc3HabBQsdsC&amp;pg=PA118 |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe before the Holocaust |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2003 |page=118 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jonathan M. Hess, the term was originally used by its authors to "stress the radical difference between their own 'antisemitism' and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan M. |last=Hess |url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/18229 |title=Johann David Michaelis and the Colonial Imaginary: Orientalism and the Emergence of Racial Antisemitism in Eighteenth-Century Germany |journal=Jewish Social Studies |volume=6 |number=2 |date=Winter 2000 |pages=56–101 |doi=10.1353/jss.2000.0003 |quote=When the term "antisemitism" was first introduced in Germany in the late 1870s, those who used it did so in order to stress the radical difference between their own "antisemitism" and earlier forms of antagonism toward Jews and Judaism. |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bookcover-1880-Marr-German uber Juden.jpg|thumb|Cover page of Marr's ''The Way to Victory of Germanicism over Judaism'', 1880 edition]]

In 1879 German journalist [[Wilhelm Marr]] published a pamphlet, ''Der Sieg des Judenthums über das Germanenthum. Vom nicht confessionellen Standpunkt aus betrachtet'' (''The Victory of the Jewish Spirit over the Germanic Spirit. Observed from a non-religious perspective'') in which he used the word ''Semitismus'' interchangeably with the word ''Judentum'' to denote both "Jewry" (the Jews as a collective) and "jewishness" (the quality of being Jewish, or the Jewish spirit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jaspal |first=Rusi |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qS_jBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT38 |title=Antisemitism and Anti-Zionism: Representation, Cognition and Everyday Talk |location=Farnham, Surrey |publisher=Ashgate Publishing |chapter=Antisemitism: Conceptual Issues |access-date=27 October 2018}} Jaspal erroneously gives the date of publication as 1873.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Marr|Marr, Wilhelm]].

Rudolph Costenoble. 1879, 8th edition/printing. Archive.org. Marr uses the word "Semitismus" (Semitism) on pages 7, 11, 14, 30, 32, and 46; for example, one finds in the conclusion the following passage: "Ja, ich bin überzeutgt, ich habe ausgesprochen, was Millionen Juden im Stillen denken: Dem Semitismus gehört die Weltherrschaft!" (Yes, I am convinced that I have articulated what millions of Jews are quietly thinking: World domination belongs to Semitism!)

This use of ''[[Wikt:Semitismus|Semitismus]]'' was followed by a coining of "[[Wikt:Antisemitismus|Antisemitismus]]" which was used to indicate opposition to the Jews as a people{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} and opposition to the Jewish spirit, which Marr interpreted as infiltrating German culture. His next pamphlet, ''Der Weg zum Siege des Germanenthums über das Judenthum'' (''The Way to Victory of the Germanic Spirit over the Jewish Spirit'', 1880), presents a development of Marr's ideas further and may present the first published use of the German word '' Antisemitismus'', "antisemitism".

The pamphlet became very popular, and in the same year he founded the ''Antisemiten-Liga'' (League of Antisemites),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilhelm Marr |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/wilhelm-marr |website=[[Jewish Virtual Library]] |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; apparently named to follow the "Anti-Kanzler-Liga" (Anti-Chancellor League).&lt;ref name="MZ1987"/&gt; The league was the first German organization committed specifically to combating the alleged threat to Germany and German culture posed by the Jews and their influence, and advocating their [[population transfer|forced removal]] from the country.

So far as can be ascertained, the word was first widely printed in 1881, when Marr published ''Zwanglose Antisemitische Hefte'', and [[Wilhelm Scherer]] used the term ''Antisemiten'' in the January issue of ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.

The [[Jewish Encyclopedia]] reports, "In February 1881, a correspondent of the ''[[Allgemeine Zeitung des Judentums]]'' speaks of 'Anti-Semitism' as a designation which recently came into use ("Allg. Zeit. d. Jud." 1881, p.&amp;nbsp;138). On 19 July 1882, the editor says, 'This quite recent Anti-Semitism is hardly three years old.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=The Jewish Encyclopedia |title=Anti-Semitism |first=Gotthard |last=Deutsch |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1603-anti-semitism  |publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls |page=641 (A) |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The related term "[[Philo-Semitism|philosemitism]]" was coined around 1885.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Usage===
From the outset the term anti-Semitism bore special racial connotations and meant specifically prejudice against [[Jews]].&lt;ref name="MWdef" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JustJews" /&gt; The term is confusing, for in modern usage 'Semitic' designates a language group, not a race. In this sense, the term is a misnomer, since there are many speakers of [[Semitic languages]] (e.g. [[Arabs]], [[Ethiopian Semitic languages|Ethiopians]], and [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]]) who are not the objects of anti-Semitic prejudices, while there are many Jews who do not speak [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], a Semitic language. Though 'antisemitism' has been used to describe [[prejudice]] against people who speak other Semitic languages,  the validity of such usage has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Benjamin |last=Isaac |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eem1AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA442 |title=The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=2004 |page=442 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=David Matas |last=Matas |first=David |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DYR7SqcMe9gC&amp;pg=PA34 |title=Aftershock: Anti-Zionism and Antisemitism |publisher=Dundurn Press |year=2005 |page=34 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term may be spelled with or without a hyphen (antisemitism or anti-Semitism). Some scholars favor the unhyphenated form because, "If you use the hyphenated form, you consider the words 'Semitism', 'Semite', 'Semitic' as meaningful" whereas "in antisemitic parlance, 'Semites' really stands for Jews, just that."&lt;ref name="Almog"&gt;{{cite web |last=Almog |first=Shmuel |url=https://astro.temple.edu/~hfreiden/Antisemitism/whatis.htm |title=What's in a Hyphen? |access-date=27 October 2018}}, SICSA Report: Newsletter of the [[Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism]] (Summer 1989).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Power of Myth |url=https://www.facinghistory.org/campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/$FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |website=Facing History |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305002701/http://www2.facinghistory.org/Campus/reslib.nsf/99ca830bb4f483948525717f005abfc7/2820f36c177cc758852571860065e8c2/%24FILE/complete_antisemitism.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2009 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bauer |first1=Yehuda |title=Problems of Contemporary Antisemitism |url=http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |access-date=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307094003/http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/docs/YBauerLecture.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bauer2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bauer |first=Yehuda |title=A History of the Holocaust |publisher=Franklin Watts |year=1982 |page=52 |isbn=0-531-05641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Emil Fackenheim]] supported the unhyphenated spelling, in order to "[dispel] the notion that there is an entity 'Semitism' which 'anti-Semitism' opposes."&lt;ref name=Fackenheim&gt;{{harvp|Prager|Telushkin|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VK0llzUqQ2YC&amp;pg=PA199 199]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorsing an unhyphenated term for the same reason include Padraic O'Hare, professor of Religious and Theological Studies and Director of the Center for the Study of Jewish-Christian-Muslim Relations at [[Merrimack College]]; [[Yehuda Bauer]], professor of [[Holocaust studies]] at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]; and [[James Carroll (author)|James Carroll]], historian and novelist. According to Carroll, who first cites O'Hare and Bauer on "the existence of something called 'Semitism'", "the hyphenated word thus reflects the bipolarity that is at the heart of the problem of antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=James |author-link=James Carroll (author) |title=Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews |publisher=Mariner |location=New York |year=2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n7EUdvSQs70C&amp;pg=PT421 |isbn=978-0618219087 |pages=628–629 |access-date=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objections to the usage of the term, such as the obsolete nature of the term Semitic as a racial term, have been raised since at least the 1930s.&lt;ref name="MZ1987"&gt;{{cite book |last=Zimmermann |first=Moshe |title=Wilhelm Marr: The Patriarch of Anti-Semitism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tYW013SjKM4C&amp;pg=PA112 |year=1987 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-536495-8 |page=112 |access-date=27 October 2018 |quote=The term "anti-Semitism" was unsuitable from the beginning for the real essence of Jew-hatred, which remained anchored, more or less, in the Christian tradition even when it moved via the natural sciences, into racism. It is doubtful whether the term which was first publicizes in an institutional context (the Anti-Semitic League) would have appeared at all if the "Anti-Chancellor League," which fought Bismarck's policy, had not been in existence since 1875. The founders of the new Organization adopted the elements of "anti" and "league," and searched for the proper term: Marr exchanged the term "Jew" for "Semite" which he already favored. It is possible that the shortened form "Sem" is used with such frequency and ease by Marr (and in his writings) due to its literary advantage and because it reminded Marr of Sem Biedermann, his Jewish employer from the Vienna period.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sevenster1975"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sevenster |first=Jan Nicolaas |title=The Roots of Pagan Anti-Semitism in the Ancient World |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLE3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=27 October 2018 |year=1975 |publisher=Brill Archive |isbn=978-90-04-04193-6 |pages=1–2 |quote=It has long been realised that there are objections to the term anti-Semitism and therefore an endeavour has been made to find a word which better interprets the meaning intended. Already in 1936 Bolkestein, for example, wrote an article on ''Het "antisemietisme" in de oudheid'' (Anti-Semitism in the ancient world) in which the word was placed between quotation marks and a preference was expressed for the term hatred of the Jews… Nowadays the term anti-Judaism is often preferred. It certainly expresses better than anti-Semitism the fact that it concerns the attitude to the Jews and avoids any suggestion of racial distinction, which was not or hardly, a factor of any significance in ancient times. For this reason Leipoldt preferred to speak of anti-Judaism when writing his ''Antisemitsmus in der alien Welt'' (l933). Bonsirven also preferred this word to Anti-Semitism, "mot moderne qui implique une théorie des races".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Definition===
Though the general definition of antisemitism is hostility or prejudice against Jews, and, according to [[Olaf Blaschke]], has become an "umbrella term for negative stereotypes about Jews",&lt;ref name="pogromsriots"&gt;{{cite book |first=Sonja |last=Weinberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0HDeEPouQm0C&amp;pg=PA18 |title=Pogroms and Riots: German Press Responses to Anti-Jewish Violence in Germany and Russia (1881–1882) |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2010 |access-date=27 October 2018 |isbn=9783631602140}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|18}} a number of authorities have developed more formal definitions.

Holocaust scholar and [[City University of New York]] professor [[Helen Fein]] defines it as "a persisting latent structure of hostile beliefs towards Jews as a collective manifested in individuals as attitudes, and in culture as myth, ideology, folklore and imagery, and in actions—social or legal discrimination, political mobilization against the Jews, and collective or state violence—which results in and/or is designed to distance, displace, or destroy Jews as Jews."

Elaborating on Fein's definition, Dietz Bering of the [[University of Cologne]] writes that, to antisemites, "Jews are not only partially but totally bad by nature, that is, their bad traits are incorrigible. Because of this bad nature: (1) Jews have to be seen not as individuals but as a collective. (2) Jews remain essentially alien in the surrounding societies. (3) Jews bring disaster on their 'host societies' or on the whole world, they are doing it secretly, therefore the anti-Semites feel obliged to unmask the conspiratorial, bad Jewish character."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Falk|2008|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zL_0WOiZj0oC&amp;pg=PA5 5]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Sonja Weinberg, as distinct from economic and religious [[anti-Judaism]], antisemitism in its modern form shows conceptual innovation, a resort to 'science' to defend itself, new functional forms and organisational differences. It was anti-liberal, racialist and nationalist. It promoted the myth that [[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion|Jews conspired to 'judaise' the world]]; it served to consolidate social identity; it channeled dissatisfactions among victims of the capitalist system; and it was used as a conservative cultural code to fight emancipation and liberalism.&lt;ref name="pogromsriots" /&gt;{{rp|18–19}}

[[File:Antisemiticroths.jpg|thumb|Caricature by C.Léandre (France, 1898) showing [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] with the world in his hands]]
[[Bernard Lewis]] defines antisemitism as a special case of prejudice, hatred, or persecution directed against people who are in some way different from the rest. According to Lewis, antisemitism is marked by two distinct features: Jews are judged according to a standard different from that applied to others, and they are accused of "cosmic evil." Thus, "it is perfectly possible to hate and even to persecute Jews without necessarily being anti-Semitic" unless this hatred or persecution displays one of the two features specific to antisemitism.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]]. [http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/21832.html "The New Anti-Semitism"], ''The American Scholar'', Volume 75 No. 1, Winter 2006, pp. 25–36. The paper is based on a lecture delivered at [[Brandeis University]] on 24 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of efforts by international and governmental bodies to define antisemitism formally. The [[United States Department of State]] states that "while there is no universally accepted definition, there is a generally clear understanding of what the term encompasses." For the purposes of its 2005 Report on Global Anti-Semitism, the term was considered to mean "hatred toward Jews—individually and as a group—that can be attributed to the Jewish religion and/or ethnicity."&lt;ref name=USDS&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/40258.htm "Report on Global Anti-Semitism"], [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]], 5 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and [[Xenophobia]] (now [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]), then an agency of the [[European Union]], developed a more detailed [[EUMC Working Definition of Antisemitism|working definition]], which states: "Antisemitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. Rhetorical and physical manifestations of antisemitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities." It also adds that "such manifestations could also target the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity," but that "criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic." It provides contemporary examples of ways in which antisemitism may manifest itself, including: promoting the harming of Jews in the name of an ideology or religion; promoting negative stereotypes of Jews; holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of an individual Jewish person or group; [[Holocaust denial|denying the Holocaust]] or accusing Jews or Israel of exaggerating it; and accusing Jews of [[dual loyalty]] or a greater allegiance to Israel than their own country. It also lists ways in which attacking Israel could be antisemitic, and states that denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, e.g. by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavor, can be a manifestation of antisemitism—as can applying double standards by requiring of Israel a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation, or holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the period before [[World War II]], when animosity towards Jews was far more commonplace, it was not uncommon for a person, an organization, or a political party to self-identify as an antisemite or antisemitic.

The early [[Zionism|Zionist]] pioneer [[Leon Pinsker]], a professional physician, preferred the clinical-sounding term ''Judeophobia'' to antisemitism, which he regarded as a misnomer. The word ''Judeophobia'' first appeared in his pamphlet "[[Auto-Emancipation]]", published anonymously in German in September 1882, where it was described as an irrational fear or hatred of Jews. According to Pinsker, this irrational fear was an inherited predisposition.&lt;ref name="Bartlett2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Steven J.|title=The Pathology of Man: A Study of Human Evil|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U5KQ0Yi76GMC&amp;pg=PA30|accessdate=2 June 2015|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|isbn=9780398075576|pages=30–}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|Judeophobia is a form of demonopathy, with the distinction that the Jewish ghost has become known to the whole race of mankind, not merely to certain races....

In the aftermath of the [[Kristallnacht]] pogrom in 1938, German propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]] announced: "The German people is anti-Semitic. It has no desire to have its rights restricted or to be provoked in the future by parasites of the Jewish race."&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Telegraph'', 12 November 1938.

After the 1945 [[End of World War II in Europe|victory of the Allies over Nazi Germany]], and particularly after the full extent of the [[The Holocaust|Nazi genocide against the Jews]] became known, the term "anti-Semitism" acquired [[pejorative]] connotations. This marked a full circle shift in usage, from an era just decades earlier when "Jew" was used as a pejorative term.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Rader Marcus. ''United States Jewry, 1776–1985.''

==Manifestations==
[[File:Medieval manuscript-Jews identified by rouelle are being burned at stake.jpg|thumb|Jews (identified by the mandatory [[Jewish badge]] and [[Jewish hat]]) being burned.]]
Antisemitism manifests itself in a variety of ways. [[René König]] mentions social antisemitism, economic antisemitism, religious antisemitism, and political antisemitism as examples. König points out that these different forms demonstrate that the "origins of anti-Semitic prejudices are rooted in different historical periods." König asserts that differences in the chronology of different antisemitic prejudices and the irregular distribution of such prejudices over different segments of the population create "serious difficulties in the definition of the different kinds of anti-Semitism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Materialien zur Kriminalsoziologie |first=René |last= König |publisher=VS Verlag |year=2004 |page=231 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=N9oL2cljv8QC&amp;pg=PA231|isbn=978-3-8100-3306-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; These difficulties may contribute to the existence of different taxonomies that have been developed to categorize the forms of antisemitism. The forms identified are substantially the same; it is primarily the number of forms and their definitions that differ. [[Bernard Lazare]] identifies three forms of antisemitism: [[Christianity and antisemitism|Christian antisemitism]], economic antisemitism, and ethnologic antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes |first=Bernard |last=Lazare |publisher=Cosimo, Inc. |year=2006 |page=224|url=https://books.google.com/?id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA224|isbn=978-1-59605-601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*political and economic antisemitism, giving as examples [[Cicero]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Lindbergh]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Religious antisemitism|theological or religious antisemitism]], sometimes known as [[anti-Judaism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*nationalistic antisemitism, citing [[Voltaire]] and other [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers, who attacked Jews for supposedly having certain characteristics, such as greed and arrogance, and for observing customs such as [[kashrut]] and [[Shabbat]];&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*and [[racial antisemitism]], with its extreme form resulting in [[the Holocaust]] by the [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|1985|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louis Harap separates "economic antisemitism" and merges "political" and "nationalistic" antisemitism into "ideological antisemitism". Harap also adds a category of "social antisemitism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature, 1900-1940s |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=24|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA24|isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* religious (Jew as Christ-killer),
* economic (Jew as banker, usurer, money-obsessed),
* social (Jew as social inferior, "pushy," vulgar, therefore excluded from personal contact),
* racist (Jews as an inferior "race"),
* ideological (Jews regarded as subversive or revolutionary),
* cultural (Jews regarded as undermining the moral and structural fiber of civilization).

[[Gustavo Perednik]] has argued that what he terms "Judeophobia" has a number of unique traits which set it apart from other forms of racism, including permanence, depth, obsessiveness, irrationality, endurance, ubiquity, and danger.&lt;ref&gt;Gustavo Perednik, [http://www.zionism-israel.com/his/judeophobia.htm Judeophobia –  Anti-Semitism, Jew-Hate and anti-"Zionism"]&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote in his book ''The Judeophobia'' that "The Jews were accused by the nationalists of being the creators of Communism; by the Communists of ruling Capitalism. If they live in non-Jewish countries, they are accused of double-loyalties; if they live in the Jewish country, of being racists. When they spend their money, they are reproached for being ostentatious; when they don't spend their money, of being avaricious. They are called rootless cosmopolitans or hardened chauvinists. If they assimilate, they are accused of being fifth-columnists, if they don't, of shutting themselves away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo |title=La Judeofobia: Cómo y Cuándo Nace, Dónde y Por Qué Pervive |url=https://books.google.com/?id=c3IiAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.&amp;dq=Los+judíos+fueron+acusados+por+los+nacionalistas+de+ser+generadores+del+comunismo;+por+los+comunistas+de+regir+el+capitalismo.+Si+viven+en+países+no+judíos,+son+acusados+de+dobles+lealtades;+si+viven+en+el+país+judío,+de+ser+racistas.+Cuando+gastan+su+dinero,+se+les+reprocha+ser+ostentosos;+cuando+no+lo+gastan,+ser+avaros.+Son+tildados+de+cosmopolitas+sin+raíces+o+de+chauvinistas+empedernidos.+Si+se+asimilan+al+medio,+se+les+acusa+de+quintacolumnistas,+si+no,+de+recluirse+en+sí+mismos.|publisher=Flor del Viento |year=2001 |page=26 |isbn=978-8489644588 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perednik |first=Gustavo Daniel |title=España descarrilada: terror islamista en Madrid y el despertar de Occidente |publisher=Inédita Editores |year=2004 |isbn=978-8496364042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harvard University|Harvard]] professor [[Ruth Wisse]] has argued that antisemitism is a political ideology that authoritarians use to consolidate power by unifying disparate groups. One example she gives is the [[Criticism of the United Nations#Allegations of anti-Zionism and antisemitism|alleged antisemitism within the United Nations]], which, in this view, functioned during the [[Cold War]] as a coalition-building technique between Soviet and Arab states, but now serves the same purpose among states opposed to the type of human-rights ideology for which the UN was created. She also cites as an example the formation of the [[Arab League]].&lt;ref name="Wisse" /&gt;

===Cultural antisemitism===

Louis Harap defines cultural antisemitism as "that species of anti-Semitism that charges the Jews with corrupting a given culture and attempting to supplant or succeeding in supplanting the preferred culture with a uniform, crude, "Jewish" culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Creative awakening: the Jewish presence in twentieth-century American literature |first=Louis |last=Harap |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1987 |page=76 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=mAPvam-n_DYC&amp;pg=PA76 |isbn=978-0-313-25386-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Eric Kandel]] characterizes cultural antisemitism as being based on the idea of "Jewishness" as a "religious or cultural tradition that is acquired through learning, through distinctive traditions and education." According to Kandel, this form of antisemitism views Jews as possessing "unattractive psychological and social characteristics that are acquired through acculturation."&lt;ref name=Kandel30&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |year=2007 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=PFnRwWXzypgC&amp;pg=PA30 |isbn=978-0-393-32937-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Niewyk and Nicosia characterize cultural antisemitism as focusing on and condemning "the Jews' aloofness from the societies in which they live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust |first1=Donald L. |last1=Niewyk|first2=Francis R. |last2=Nicosia |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2003|page=215|url=https://books.google.com/?id=z-6vKBHggVwC&amp;pg=PA215|isbn=978-0-231-11201-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An important feature of cultural antisemitism is that it considers the negative attributes of Judaism to be redeemable by education or by religious conversion.&lt;ref name=Kandel3031&gt;{{cite book |title=In search of memory: the emergence of a new science of mind |first=Eric R. |last=Kandel |publisher=W.

===Religious antisemitism===
{{See also|Anti-Judaism|Christianity and antisemitism|Islam and antisemitism}}
[[File:Execution of Mariana de Carabajal.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Execution of [[Francisca Nuñez de Carabajal|Mariana de Carabajal]] (converted Jew), accused of a relapse into Judaism, [[Mexico City]], 1601]]
[[Religious antisemitism]], also known as anti-Judaism, is antipathy towards Jews because of their perceived religious beliefs. In theory, antisemitism and attacks against individual Jews would stop if Jews stopped practicing Judaism or changed their public faith, especially by [[Religious conversion|conversion]] to the official or right religion. However, in some cases discrimination continues after conversion, as in the case of Christianized ''[[Marranos]]'' or Iberian Jews in the late 15th century and 16th century who were suspected of secretly practising Judaism or Jewish customs.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

Although the origins of antisemitism are rooted in the Judeo-Christian conflict, other forms of antisemitism have developed in modern times. Frederick Schweitzer asserts that, "most scholars ignore the Christian foundation on which the modern antisemitic edifice rests and invoke political antisemitism, cultural antisemitism, racism or racial antisemitism, economic antisemitism and the like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A concise history of American antisemitism |first=Robert |last=Michael |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |year=2005|page=vii |url=https://books.google.com/?id=5G3feplFBYUC&amp;pg=PR7|isbn=978-0-7425-4313-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Nichols draws a distinction between religious antisemitism and modern antisemitism based on racial or ethnic grounds: "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion [...] a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon [[baptism]]." From the perspective of racial antisemitism, however, "the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.[...] From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews[...] Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."

Some Christians such as the Catholic priest [[Ernest Jouin]], who published the first French translation of the ''Protocols'', combined religious and racial anti-Semitism, as in his statement that "From the triple viewpoint of race, of nationality, and of religion, the Jew has become the enemy of humanity."&lt;ref name="Michael"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=R. |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The virulent anti-Semitism of [[Édouard Drumont]], one of the most widely read Catholic writers in France during the Dreyfus Affair, likewise combined religious and racial anti-Semitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arnal |first1=Oscar L. |title=Ambivalent Alliance: The Catholic Church and the Action Française, 1899-1939 |date=1985 |publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rubenstein |first1=Richard L. |title=Approaches to Auschwitz: The Holocaust and Its Legacy |date=2003 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brustein |first1=William |title=Roots of Hate: Anti-Semitism in Europe Before the Holocaust |date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic antisemitism===
The underlying premise of [[economic antisemitism]] is that Jews perform harmful economic activities or that economic activities become harmful when they are performed by Jews.&lt;ref name=MeyerBrenner220&gt;{{cite book |title=German-Jewish History in Modern Times: Integration in dispute, 1871–1918 |publisher=Columbia University Press|year=1998 |page=220 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HFFoSglsovoC&amp;pg=PA220|isbn=978-0-231-07476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linking Jews and money underpins the most damaging and lasting [[Antisemitic canard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jews &amp; Money – The story of a stereotype|url=http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|accessdate=18 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228220753/http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/jewsandmoney/default.asp|archivedate=28 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemites claim that Jews control the world finances, a theory promoted in the fraudulent [[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]], and later repeated by [[Henry Ford]] and his [[The Dearborn Independent|Dearborn Independent]]. In the modern era, such myths continue to be spread in books such as ''[[The Secret Relationship Between Blacks and Jews]]'' published by the [[Nation of Islam]], and on the internet.
[[Derek Penslar]] writes that there are two components to the financial [[Antisemitic canard|canards]]:&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;
:a) Jews are savages that "are temperamentally incapable of performing honest labor"
:b) Jews are "leaders of a financial cabal seeking world domination"

[[Abraham Foxman]] describes six facets of the financial canards:
#All Jews are wealthy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews are stingy and greedy&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;
#Powerful Jews control the business world&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jewish religion emphasizes profit and materialism&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is okay for Jews to cheat non-Jews&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
#Jews use their power to benefit "their own kind"&lt;ref&gt;Foxman, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Krefetz]] summarizes the myth as "[Jews] control the banks, the money supply, the economy, and businesses—of the community, of the country, of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Krefetz gives, as illustrations, many slurs and proverbs (in several different languages) which suggest that Jews are stingy, or greedy, or miserly, or aggressive bargainers.&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, Jews were described as "scurrilous, stupid, and tight-fisted", but after the [[Jewish Emancipation]] and the rise of Jews to the middle- or upper-class in Europe were portrayed as "clever, devious, and manipulative financiers out to dominate [world finances]".&lt;ref&gt;Krefetz, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Léon Poliakov]] asserts that economic antisemitism is not a distinct form of antisemitism, but merely a manifestation of theologic antisemitism (because, without the theological causes of the economic antisemitism, there would be no economic antisemitism). In opposition to this view, Derek Penslar contends that in the modern era, the economic antisemitism is "distinct and nearly constant" but theological antisemitism is "often subdued".&lt;ref&gt;Penslar, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

An academic study by Francesco D'Acunto, Marcel Prokopczuk, and Michael Weber showed that people who live in areas of Germany that contain the most brutal history of anti-Semitic persecution are more likely to be distrustful of finance in general. Therefore, they tended to invest less money in the stock market and make poor financial decisions. The study concluded "that the persecution of minorities reduces not only the long-term wealth of the persecuted, but of the persecutors as well."&lt;ref&gt;D’Acunto, Francesco, et al.

===Racial antisemitism===
{{Main|Racial antisemitism}}

Racial antisemitism is prejudice against [[Jew]]s as a racial/ethnic group, rather than [[Judaism]] as a religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1603&amp;letter=A&amp;search=Anti-semitism "Anti-Semitism"], [[Jewish Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Racial antisemitism is the idea that the Jews are a distinct and inferior race compared to their host nations. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, it gained mainstream acceptance as part of the [[eugenics]] movement, which categorized non-Europeans as inferior. It more specifically claimed that Northern Europeans, or "Aryans", were superior. Racial antisemites saw the Jews as part of a Semitic race and emphasized their non-European origins and culture. They saw Jews as beyond redemption even if they converted to the majority religion.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Racial antisemitism replaced the hatred of Judaism with the hatred of Jews as a group. In the context of the [[Industrial Revolution]], following the [[Jewish Emancipation]], Jews rapidly urbanized and experienced a period of greater social mobility. With the decreasing role of religion in public life tempering religious antisemitism, a combination of growing [[nationalism]], the rise of [[eugenics]], and resentment at the socio-economic success of the Jews led to the newer, and more virulent, racist antisemitism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

According to William Nichols, religious antisemitism may be distinguished from modern antisemitism based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[ethnicity|ethnic]] grounds. "The dividing line was the possibility of effective conversion... a Jew ceased to be a Jew upon baptism." However, with racial antisemitism, "Now the assimilated Jew was still a Jew, even after baptism.... From the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] onward, it is no longer possible to draw clear lines of distinction between religious and racial forms of hostility towards Jews... Once Jews have been emancipated and secular thinking makes its appearance, without leaving behind the old Christian hostility towards Jews, the new term antisemitism becomes almost unavoidable, even before explicitly racist doctrines appear."&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, William: ''Christian Antisemitism, A History of Hate'' (1993) p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, a number of laws enabling emancipation of the Jews were enacted in Western European countries.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Webster (2001)''Petain's Crime''. London, Pan Books: 13, 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dan Cohn-Sherbok (2006) ''The Paradox of Anti-Semitism''. Continuum: 44–46&lt;/ref&gt; The old laws restricting them to [[ghetto]]s, as well as the many laws that limited their property rights, rights of worship and occupation, were rescinded. Despite this, traditional discrimination and hostility to Jews on religious grounds persisted and was supplemented by [[racial antisemitism]], encouraged by the work of racial theorists such as [[Joseph Arthur de Gobineau]] and particularly his ''Essay on the Inequality of the Human Race'' of 1853–5. [[Nationalist]] agendas based on [[ethnicity]], known as [[ethnonationalism]], usually excluded the Jews from the national community as an alien race.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007)''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': 64&lt;/ref&gt; Allied to this were theories of [[Social Darwinism]], which stressed a putative conflict between higher and lower races of human beings. Such theories, usually posited by northern Europeans, advocated the superiority of white [[Aryan]]s to [[Semitic people|Semitic]] Jews.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Beller (2007) ''Antisemitism: A Very Short Introduction'': pp. 57–9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William I. Brustein|William Brustein]] defines political antisemitism as hostility toward Jews based on the belief that Jews seek national and/or world power." Yisrael Gutman characterizes political antisemitism as tending to "lay responsibility on the Jews for defeats and political economic crises" while seeking to "exploit opposition and resistance to Jewish influence as elements in political party platforms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide, critical issues of the Holocaust: a companion to the film, Genocide |publisher=Behrman House, Inc |year=1983 |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=DcdiVs9lwvcC&amp;pg=PA100|isbn=978-0-940646-04-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Viktor Karády, political antisemitism became widespread after the legal emancipation of the Jews and sought to reverse some of the consequences of that emancipation.

{{Main|New antisemitism}}
Starting in the 1990s, some scholars have advanced the concept of [[new antisemitism]], coming simultaneously from the [[Left-wing politics|left]], the [[Right-wing politics|right]], and [[Islamism|radical Islam]], which tends to focus on opposition to the creation of a Jewish homeland in the [[State of Israel]],&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and they argue that the language of [[anti-Zionism]] and [[criticism of Israel]] are used to attack Jews more broadly. In this view, the proponents of the new concept believe that [[criticism of Israel|criticisms of Israel]] and [[Zionism]] are often disproportionate in degree and unique in kind, and they attribute this to antisemitism. Jewish scholar [[Gustavo Perednik]] posited in 2004 that anti-Zionism in itself represents a form of discrimination against Jews, in that it singles out Jewish national aspirations as an illegitimate and racist endeavor, and "proposes actions that would result in the death of millions of Jews".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20031205153139/http://yaleglobal.yale.edu/display.article?id=2791 "Antiglobalism's Jewish Problem"] in Rosenbaum, Ron (ed). ''Those who forget the past: The Question of Anti-Semitism'', Random House 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;272.&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that the new antisemitism deploys traditional antisemitic motifs, including older motifs such as the [[blood libel]].&lt;ref name="New-AS-List"/&gt;

Critics of the concept view it as trivializing the meaning of antisemitism, and as exploiting antisemitism in order to silence debate and to deflect attention from legitimate [[criticism of Israel|criticism of the State of Israel]], and, by associating anti-Zionism with antisemitism, misused to taint anyone opposed to Israeli actions and policies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Klug|Klug, Brian]].

Many authors see the roots of modern antisemitism in both pagan antiquity and early Christianity. Jerome Chanes identifies six stages in the historical development of antisemitism:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Pre-Christian anti-Judaism in ancient Greece and Rome which was primarily ethnic in nature
#Christian antisemitism in antiquity and the Middle Ages which was religious in nature and has extended into modern times
#Traditional Muslim antisemitism which was—at least, in its classical form—nuanced in that Jews were a protected class
#Political, social and economic antisemitism of Enlightenment and post-Enlightenment Europe which laid the groundwork for racial antisemitism
#Racial antisemitism that arose in the 19th century and culminated in Nazism in the 20th century
#Contemporary antisemitism which has been labeled by some as the [[New Antisemitism]]

Chanes suggests that these six stages could be merged into three categories: "ancient antisemitism, which was primarily ethnic in nature; [[Christian antisemitism]], which was religious; and the racial antisemitism of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;ref name=Chanes5&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient world===

The first clear examples of anti-Jewish sentiment can be traced to the 3rd century BCE to [[Alexandria]],&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; the home to the largest Jewish diaspora community in the world at the time and where the [[Septuagint]], a Greek translation of the [[Hebrew Bible]], was produced. [[Manetho]], an Egyptian priest and historian of that era, wrote scathingly of the Jews. His themes are repeated in the works of [[Chaeremon of Alexandria|Chaeremon]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Poseidonius]], [[Apollonius Molon]], and in [[Apion]] and [[Tacitus]].&lt;ref name=Flannery&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agatharchides of Cnidus]] ridiculed the practices of the Jews and the "absurdity of [[Torah|their Law]]", making a mocking reference to how [[Ptolemy Lagus]] was able to invade [[Jerusalem]] in 320 BCE because its inhabitants were observing the ''[[Shabbat]]''.&lt;ref name=Flannery /&gt; One of the earliest anti-Jewish [[edict]]s, promulgated by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]] in about 170–167 BCE, sparked a revolt of the [[Maccabees]] in [[Judea]].&lt;ref name="gruen"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |authorlink=Erich S.

In view of Manetho's anti-Jewish writings, antisemitism may have originated in Egypt and been spread by "the [[Greeks|Greek]] retelling of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian prejudices".&lt;ref name="Schäfer"&gt;Schäfer, Peter. ''Judeophobia'', Harvard University Press, 1997, p. 208.[[Peter Schaefer (author)|Peter Schäfer]]&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jewish philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] describes an attack on Jews in Alexandria in 38 CE in which thousands of Jews died.&lt;ref name=Barclay&gt;Barclay, John M G, 1999.

''Philo's Flaccus: the First Pogrom'', Philo of Alexandria Commentary Series, Brill. [[Pieter Willem van der Horst]]&lt;/ref&gt; Tcherikover argues that the reason for hatred of Jews in the Hellenistic period was their separateness in the Greek cities, the ''[[polis|poleis]]''.&lt;ref name=tcherikover&gt;Tcherikover, Victor, ''Hellenistic Civilization and the Jews'', New York: Atheneum, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Bohak has argued, however, that early animosity against the Jews cannot be regarded as being anti-Judaic or antisemitic unless it arose from attitudes that were held against the Jews alone, and that many Greeks showed animosity toward any group they regarded as barbarians.&lt;ref name=Bohak&gt;Bohak, Gideon. "The Ibis and the Jewish Question: Ancient 'Antisemitism' in Historical Context" in Menachem Mor et al., ''Jews and Gentiles in the Holy Land in the Days of the Second Temple, the Mishna and the Talmud'', Yad Ben-Zvi Press, 2003, pp. 27–43 {{ISBN|9652172057}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
Statements exhibiting prejudice against Jews and their religion can be found in the works of many [[pagan]] [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=3265911|author=Daniels J.L.|title=Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period|journal=Journal of Biblical Literature|volume=98 |issue=1|year=1979|pages=45–65|doi=10.2307/3265911}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Flannery writes that it was the Jews' refusal to accept Greek religious and social standards that marked them out. Hecataetus of Abdera, a Greek historian of the early third century BCE, wrote that Moses "in remembrance of the exile of his people, instituted for them a misanthropic and inhospitable way of life." [[Manetho]], an Egyptian historian, wrote that the Jews were expelled Egyptian [[Leprosy|lepers]] who had been taught by [[Moses]] "not to adore the gods." Edward Flannery describes antisemitism in ancient times as essentially "cultural, taking the shape of a national xenophobia played out in political settings."&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt;

There are examples of [[Hellenistic]] rulers desecrating the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple]] and banning Jewish religious practices, such as [[circumcision]], Shabbat observance, study of Jewish religious books, etc. Examples may also be found in anti-Jewish riots in [[Alexandria]] in the 3rd century BCE.

The Jewish diaspora on the [[Nile River|Nile]] island [[Elephantine]], which was founded by mercenaries, experienced the destruction of its temple in 410 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Colpe, Carsten (Berlin). "Anti-Semitism." Brill's New Pauly. Antiquity volumes edited by: Hubert Cancik and Helmuth Schneider. Brill, 2008. Brill Online. 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Relationships between the Jewish people and the occupying [[Roman Empire]] were at times antagonistic and resulted in [[Jewish-Roman wars|several rebellions]]. According to [[Suetonius]], the emperor [[Tiberius]] expelled from Rome Jews who had gone to live there. The 18th-century English historian [[Edward Gibbon]] identified a more tolerant period in Roman-Jewish relations beginning in about 160 CE.&lt;ref name="Flannery1985"/&gt; However, when Christianity became the state religion of the Roman Empire, the state's attitude towards the Jews [[History of antisemitism#Late Roman Empire|gradually worsened]].

[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] asserted: "Jews accounted for 10% of the total population of the [[Roman Empire]]. By that ratio, if other factors such as [[pogrom]]s and [[forced conversion|conversion]]s had not intervened, there would be 200 million Jews in the world today, instead of something like 13 million."&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, James.

During the [[Middle Ages]] in Europe there was persecution against Jews in many places, with [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. A main justification of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious.

The persecution hit its first peak during the [[Crusades]]. In the [[First Crusade]] (1096) hundreds or even thousands of [[Rhineland massacres|Jews were killed as the crusaders arrived.]]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chazan, ''In the Year 1096: The First Crusade and the Jews'' (1996) [https://www.questia.com/library/5684490/in-the-year-1096-the-first-crusade-and-the-jews online]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first major outbreak of anti-Jewish violence in Christian Europe outside Spain and was cited by Zionists in the 19th century as indicating the need for a state of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Corliss K.

In the [[Second Crusade]] (1147) the Jews in Germany were subject to several massacres. The Jews were also subjected to attacks by the [[Shepherds' Crusade (1251)|Shepherds' Crusades of 1251]] and [[Shepherds' Crusade (1320)|1320]], as well as [[Rintfleisch massacres|Rintfleisch knights]] in 1298. The Crusades were followed by expulsions, including, in 1290, the banishing of all [[English people|English]] Jews; in 1394, the expulsion of 100,000 Jews in France;&lt;ref&gt;History of the reign of Charles VI, titled ''Chronique de Religieux de Saint-Denys, contenant le regne de Charles VI de 1380 a 1422'', encompasses the king's full reign in six volumes.

As the [[Black Death]] epidemics devastated Europe in the mid-14th century, causing the death of a large part of the population, Jews were used as [[scapegoating#Psychology and sociology|scapegoats]]. Rumors spread that they caused the disease by deliberately poisoning wells. Hundreds of Jewish communities were [[Black Death Jewish persecutions|destroyed in numerous persecutions]]. Although [[Pope Clement VI]] tried to protect them by issuing two [[papal bull]]s in 1348, the first on 6 July and an additional one several months later, 900 Jews were [[Strasbourg massacre|burned alive in Strasbourg]], where the plague had not yet affected the city.&lt;ref name="Black"&gt;See Stéphane Barry and Norbert Gualde, ''La plus grande épidémie de l'histoire'' ("The greatest epidemics in history"), in ''[[L'Histoire]]'' magazine, n°310, June 2006, p. 47 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th century===
During the mid-to-late 17th century the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was devastated by several conflicts, in which the Commonwealth lost over a third of its population (over 3 million people), and Jewish losses were counted in the hundreds of thousands. The first of these conflicts was the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]], when [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]'s supporters massacred tens of thousands of [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]] in the eastern and southern areas he controlled (today's [[Ukraine]]). The precise number of dead may never be known, but the decrease of the Jewish population during that period is estimated at 100,000 to 200,000, which also includes emigration, deaths from diseases and [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|captivity in the Ottoman Empire]], called ''jasyr''.&lt;ref&gt;"Bogdan Chmelnitzki leads Cossack uprising against Polish rule; 100,000 Jews are killed and hundreds of Jewish communities are destroyed."

European immigrants to the United States brought antisemitism to the country as early as the 17th century. [[Peter Stuyvesant]], the Dutch governor of [[New Amsterdam]], implemented plans to prevent Jews from settling in the city. During the Colonial Era, the American government limited the political and economic rights of Jews. It was not until the [[American Revolutionary War]] that Jews gained legal rights, including the right to vote. However, even at their peak, the restrictions on Jews in the United States were never as stringent as they had been in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Ed. by Paul S.|title=The Oxford companion to United States history|year=2006|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-508209-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Zaydi|Zaydi imamate]] of [[Yemen]], Jews were also singled out for discrimination in the 17th century, which culminated in the general expulsion of all Jews from places in Yemen to the arid coastal plain of [[Tihamah]] and which became known as the [[Mawza Exile]].&lt;ref&gt;Yosef Qafiḥ, ''Ketavim'' (''Collected Papers''), Vol. 2, Jerusalem 1989, pp. 714–716 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enlightenment===
In 1744, [[Frederick II of Prussia]] limited the number of Jews allowed to live in [[Breslau]] to only ten so-called "protected" Jewish families and encouraged a similar practice in other [[Prussia]]n cities. In 1750 he issued the ''Revidiertes General Privilegium und Reglement vor die Judenschaft'': the "protected" Jews had an alternative to "either abstain from marriage or leave [[Berlin]]" (quoting [[Simon Dubnow]]). In the same year, Archduchess of Austria [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] ordered Jews out of [[Bohemia]] but soon reversed her position, on the condition that Jews pay for their readmission every ten years. This [[extortion]] was known as ''malke-geld'' (queen's money). In 1752 she introduced the law limiting each Jewish family to one son. In 1782, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] abolished most of these persecution practices in his ''[[Toleranzpatent]]'', on the condition that [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] were eliminated from public records and that judicial autonomy was annulled. [[Moses Mendelssohn]] wrote that "Such a tolerance... is even more dangerous play in tolerance than open persecution."

===Voltaire===
According to Arnold Ages, [[Voltaire]]'s "Lettres philosophiques, Dictionnaire philosophique, and Candide, to name but a few of his better known works, are saturated with comments on Jews and Judaism and the vast majority are negative".&lt;ref&gt;Ages Arnold. "Tainted Greatness: The Case of Voltaire's Anti-Semitism: The Testimony of the Correspondence." Neohelicon 21.2 (Sept. 1994): 361.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul H. Meyer adds: "There is no question but that Voltaire, particularly in his latter years, nursed a violent hatred of the Jews and it is equally certain that his animosity...did have a considerable impact on public opinion in France."&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, Paul H. "The Attitude of the Enlightenment Toward the Jew." Studies on Voltaire and the Eighteenth Century, 26 (1963): 1177.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty of the 118 articles in Voltaire's ''[[Dictionnaire Philosophique]]'' concerned Jews and described them in consistently negative ways.&lt;ref&gt;[[Léon Poliakov|Poliakov, L.]] ''The History of Anti-Semitism: From Voltaire to Wagner''.

===Louis de Bonald and the Catholic Counter-Revolution===
The [[counter-revolutionary]] Catholic royalist [[Louis de Bonald]] stands out among the earliest figures to explicitly call for the reversal of Jewish emancipation in the wake of the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Battini1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=2–7 and 30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Katz |first1=Jacob |title=From Prejudice to Destruction: Anti-Semitism, 1700-1933 |date=1980 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's attacks on the Jews are likely to have influenced [[Napoléon Bonaparte|Napoleon]]'s decision to limit the civil rights of Alsatian Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Socialism of Fools: Capitalism and Modern Anti-Semitism|last=Battini|first=Michele|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Garṭner |first1=Aryeh |last2=Gartner |first2=Lloyd P. |title=History of the Jews in Modern Times |date=2001 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Joskowicz |first1=Ari |title=The Modernity of Others: Jewish Anti-Catholicism in Germany and France |date=2013 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |last2=Rosen |first2=Philip |title=Dictionary of Antisemitism from the Earliest Times to the Present |date=2007 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald's article ''Sur les juifs'' (1806) was one of the most venomous screeds of its era and furnished a paradigm which combined anti-liberalism, a defense of a rural society, traditional Christian antisemitism, and the identification of Jews with bankers and finance capital, which would in turn influence many subsequent right-wing reactionaries such as [[Roger Gougenot des Mousseaux]], [[Charles Maurras]], and [[Édouard Drumont]], nationalists such as [[Maurice Barrès]] and [[Paolo Orano]], and anti-Semitic socialists such as [[Alphonse Toussenel]].&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanos |first1=Sandrine |title=The Aesthetics of Hate: Far-Right Intellectuals, Antisemitism, and Gender in 1930s France |date=2012 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Laqueur |first1=Walter |last2=Baumel |first2=Judith Tydor |title=The Holocaust Encyclopedia |date=2001 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonald furthermore declared that the Jews were an "alien" people, a "state within a state", and should be forced to wear a distinctive mark to more easily identify and discriminate against them.&lt;ref name="Battini1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

Under the French Second Empire, the popular counter-revolutionary Catholic journalist [[Louis Veuillot]] propagated Bonald's arguments against the Jewish "financial aristocracy" along with vicious attacks against the Talmud and the Jews as a "deicidal people" driven by hatred to "enslave" Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Graetz |first1=Michael |title=The Jews in Nineteenth-century France: From the French Revolution to the Alliance Israélite Universelle |date=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michael1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Michael |first1=Robert |title=A History of Catholic Antisemitism: The Dark Side of the Church |date=2008 |publisher=Springer |pages=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1882 and 1886 alone, French priests published twenty antisemitic books blaming France's ills on the Jews and urging the government to consign them back to the ghettos, expel them, or hang them from the gallows.&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt; Gougenot des Mousseaux's ''Le Juif, le judaïsme et la judaïsation des peuples chrétiens'' (1869) has been called a "Bible of modern antisemitism" and was translated into German by Nazi ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]].&lt;ref name="Michael1" /&gt;

===Imperial Russia===
Thousands of Jews were slaughtered by Cossack [[Haidamaka|Haidamaks]] in the 1768 [[massacre of Uman]] in the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Kingdom of Poland]]. In 1772, the empress of Russia [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] forced the Jews into the [[Pale of Settlement]] &amp;ndash; which was located primarily in present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus &amp;ndash; and to stay in their [[shtetls]] and forbade them from returning to the towns that they occupied before the [[partition of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour By Rebecca Weiner]. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org.

Policy towards Jews was liberalised somewhat under [[Czar Alexander II]] ({{reign|1855|1881}}).&lt;ref&gt;Paul Johnson, ''A History of the Jews'', Harper Perennial, 1986, p 359&lt;/ref&gt; However, his assassination in 1881 served as a pretext for further repression such as the [[May Laws]] of 1882. [[Konstantin Pobedonostsev]], nicknamed the "black czar" and tutor to the [[czarevitch]], later crowned [[Czar Nicholas II]], declared that "One third of the Jews must die, one third must emigrate, and one third be converted to Christianity".&lt;ref&gt;[[John Van der Kiste]],''The Romanovs 1818–1959'', Sutton, 1998, p 104&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic antisemitism in the 19th century===
Historian [[Martin Gilbert]] writes that it was in the 19th century that the position of Jews worsened in [[Muslim]] countries. [[Benny Morris]] writes that one symbol of Jewish degradation was the phenomenon of stone-throwing at Jews by Muslim children. Morris quotes a 19th-century traveler: "I have seen a little fellow of six years old, with a troop of fat toddlers of only three and four, teaching [them] to throw stones at a Jew, and one little urchin would, with the greatest coolness, waddle up to the man and literally spit upon his Jewish [[gaberdine]]. To all this the Jew is obliged to submit; it would be more than his life was worth to offer to strike a Mahommedan."&lt;ref name=Morris10&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''Righteous Victims: A History of the Zionist-Arab Conflict, 1881–2001''. Vintage Books, 2001, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of the 19th century, [[J. J. Benjamin]] wrote about the life of [[Persian Jews]], describing conditions and beliefs that went back to the 16th century: "…they are obliged to live in a separate part of town… Under the pretext of their being unclean, they are treated with the greatest severity and should they enter a street, inhabited by Mussulmans, they are pelted by the boys and mobs with stones and dirt…."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Bernard |last=Lewis |title=The Jews of Islam |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |year=1984 |pages=181–183|isbn=978-0-691-00807-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Jerusalem at least, conditions for some Jews improved. [[Moses Montefiore]], on his seventh visit in 1875, noted that fine new buildings had sprung up and; 'surely we're approaching the time to witness God's hallowed promise unto Zion.' Muslim and Christian Arabs participated in [[Purim]] and [[Passover]]; Arabs called the [[Sephardi]]s 'Jews, sons of Arabs'; the [[Ulema]] and the Rabbis offered joint prayers for rain in time of drought.&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Sebag Montefiore]], ''Jerusalem'', Phoenix, 2011, pp. 429-432&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the Dreyfus trial in France, 'Muslim comments usually favoured the persecuted Jew against his Christian persecutors'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis]], ''What Went Wrong?'', Phoenix, 2002, p 172&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secular or racial antisemitism===
[[Image:Wagner Das Judenthum in der Musik 1869.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Title page of the second edition of ''Das Judenthum in der Musik'', published in 1869]]
In 1850 the German composer [[Richard Wagner]] – who has been called "the inventor of modern antisemitism"&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt; – published ''[[Das Judenthum in der Musik]]'' (roughly "Jewishness in Music"&lt;ref name=bismarck&gt;[[Jonathan Steinberg|Steinberg, Jonathan]] (2011) ''Bismarck: A Life'' New York: Oxford, pp.388–90. {{ISBN|978-0-19-997539-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;) under a [[pseudonym]] in the ''[[Neue Zeitschrift für Musik]]''. The essay began as an attack on Jewish composers, particularly Wagner's contemporaries, and rivals, [[Felix Mendelssohn]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]], but expanded to accuse Jews of being a harmful and alien element in [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], who corrupted morals and were, in fact, parasites incapable of creating truly "German" art. The crux was the manipulation and control by the Jews of the money economy:&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the present constitution of this world, the Jew in truth is already more than emancipated: he rules, and will rule, so long as Money remains the power before which all our doings and our dealings lose their force.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although originally published anonymously, when the essay was republished 19 years later, in 1869, the concept of the corrupting Jew had become so widely held that Wagner's name was affixed to it.&lt;ref name=bismarck /&gt;
 
Antisemitism can also be found in many of the [[Grimms' Fairy Tales]] by [[Jacob Grimm|Jacob]] and [[Wilhelm Grimm]], published from 1812 to 1857. It is mainly characterized by Jews being the [[villain]] of a story, such as in "The Good Bargain" ("''Der gute Handel"'') and "The Jew Among Thorns" (''"Der Jude im Dorn"'').

The middle 19th century saw continued official harassment of the Jews, especially in Eastern Europe under Czarist influence. For example, in 1846, 80 Jews approached the governor in Warsaw to retain the right to wear their traditional dress, but were immediately rebuffed by having their hair and beards forcefully cut, at their own expense.&lt;ref name=BDE&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=The Despot of Russia...|image=50249029|date=22 December 1846|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, even such influential figures as Walt Whitman tolerated bigotry toward the Jews. During his time as editor of the Brooklyn Eagle (1846–1848), the newspaper published historical sketches casting Jews in a bad light.&lt;ref name=BDE-Whitman&gt;{{cite bklyn|title=Anecdotes of Jews, and their peculiar traits|image=50243090|page=2|date=8 January 1847}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dreyfus Affair]] was an infamous antisemitic event of the late 19th century and early 20th century. [[Alfred Dreyfus]], a Jewish artillery [[wikt:captain|captain]] in the [[French Army]], was accused in 1894 of passing secrets to the Germans. As a result of these charges, Dreyfus was convicted and sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] on [[Devil's Island]]. The actual spy, Marie Charles Esterhazy, was acquitted. The event caused great uproar among the French, with the public choosing sides on the issue of whether Dreyfus was actually guilty or not. [[Émile Zola]] accused the army of corrupting the French justice system. However, general consensus held that Dreyfus was guilty: 80% of the press in France condemned him. This attitude among the majority of the French population reveals the underlying antisemitism of the time period.&lt;ref&gt;Rapport, Michael. (2005) Nineteenth Century Europe. New York: Palgrave MacMillan {{ISBN|0333652460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Stoecker]] (1835–1909), the [[Lutheran]] court chaplain to [[Kaiser Wilhelm I]], founded in 1878 an antisemitic, [[Liberalism|anti-liberal]] political party called the [[Christian Social Party (Germany)|Christian Social Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Harold M.

Some scholars view [[Karl Marx|Karl Marx's]] essay ''[[On The Jewish Question]]'' as antisemitic, and argue that he often used antisemitic epithets in his published and private writings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Flannery|2004|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacobs2005"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Marx, Karl (1818–1883) |title=Antisemitism: A Historical Encyclopedia of Prejudice and Persecution |last=Jacobs |first=Jack |editor=Levy, Richard S. |year=2005 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=978-1-85109-439-4 |pages=446–447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lewis1999"&gt;{{harvp|Lewis|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; These scholars argue that Marx equated Judaism with capitalism in his essay, helping to spread that idea.

These scholars argue that "On the Jewish Question" is a critique of Bruno Bauer's arguments that Jews must convert to Christianity before being emancipated, and is more generally a critique of liberal rights discourses and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;David McLellan: ''Marx before Marxism'' (1970), pp. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Y.

Wheen says that "Those critics, who see this as a foretaste of 'Mein Kampf', overlook one, essential point: in spite of the clumsy phraseology and crude stereotyping, the essay was actually written as a defense of the Jews. It was a retort to Bruno Bauer, who had argued that Jews should not be granted full civic rights and freedoms unless they were baptised as Christians".&lt;ref&gt;Wheen, F., Karl Marx, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; According to McLellan, Marx used the word ''Judentum'' colloquially, as meaning ''commerce'', arguing that Germans must be emancipated from the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] not Judaism or Jews in particular. McLellan concludes that readers should interpret the essay's second half as "an extended pun at Bauer's expense".&lt;ref&gt;McLellan 1980, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1900 and 1924, approximately 1.75 million Jews migrated to America, the bulk from Eastern Europe. Before 1900 American Jews had always amounted to less than 1% of America's total population, but by 1930 Jews formed about 3.5%. This increase, combined with the [[upward social mobility]] of some Jews, contributed to a resurgence of antisemitism. In the first half of the 20th century, in the US, Jews were discriminated against in employment, access to residential and resort areas, membership in clubs and organizations, and in tightened quotas on Jewish enrolment and teaching positions in colleges and universities. The lynching of [[Leo Frank]] by a mob of prominent citizens in [[Marietta, Georgia]] in 1915 turned the spotlight on antisemitism in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Chanes|2004|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ju7U83nRDt8C&amp;pg=PA72 72]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was also used to build support for the renewal of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] which had been inactive since 1870.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Levy|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Tdn6FFZklkcC&amp;pg=PA243 vol. 1, p.&amp;nbsp;72]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Menahem Mendel Beilis|Beilis Trial]] in Russia represented incidents of [[blood libel|blood-libel]] in Europe. Christians used allegations of Jews killing Christians as a justification for the killing of Jews.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Antisemitism in America reached its peak during the [[interwar period]]. The pioneer automobile manufacturer [[Henry Ford]] propagated antisemitic ideas in his newspaper ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'' (published by Ford from 1919 to 1927). The radio speeches of [[Father Coughlin]] in the late 1930s attacked [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] and promoted the notion of a Jewish financial conspiracy. Some prominent politicians shared such views: [[Louis T. McFadden]], Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Banking and Currency]], blamed Jews for Roosevelt's decision to abandon the [[gold standard]], and claimed that "in the United States today, the Gentiles have the slips of paper while the Jews have the lawful money".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arad |first=Gulie Ne'eman |title=America, Its Jews, and the Rise of Nazism |year=2000 |publisher=Indiana University Press |location=Indianapolis |isbn=978-0-253-33809-9 |page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1940s the [[aviator]] [[Charles Lindbergh]] and many prominent Americans led The [[America First Committee]] in opposing any involvement in the war against [[Fascism]]. During his July 1936 visit to [[Nazi Germany]], a few weeks before the [[1936 Summer Olympics]], Lindbergh wrote letters saying that there was "more intelligent leadership in Germany than is generally recognized". The [[German American Bund]] held parades in New York City during the late 1930s, where members wore [[Nazi]] uniforms and raised flags featuring [[swastika]]s alongside American flags.

In Germany, [[Nazism]] led [[Adolf Hitler]] and the [[Nazi Party]], who [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] on 30 January 1933 shortly afterwards instituted repressive legislation which denied the Jews basic civil rights.{{sfn|Majer|2014|p=60}}&lt;ref&gt;see also [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] (7 April 1933)&lt;/ref&gt; 
In September 1935, the [[Nuremberg Laws]] prohibited sexual relations and marriages between "Aryans" and Jews as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' ("race disgrace") and stripped all German Jews, even quarter- and [[half-Jew]]s, of their citizenship, (their official title became "subjects of the state").{{sfn|Majer|2014|pp=113, 116, 118}} It instituted a pogrom on the night of 9–10 November 1938, dubbed ''[[Kristallnacht]]'', in which Jews were killed, their property destroyed and their synagogues torched.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Kershaw (2008) ''Fateful Choices'': 441-44&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitic laws, agitation and propaganda were extended to [[German-occupied Europe]] in the wake of conquest, often building on local antisemitic traditions.

Antisemitism was commonly used as an instrument for settling personal conflicts in the [[Soviet Union]], starting with the conflict between [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]] and continuing through numerous conspiracy-theories spread by official propaganda. [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|Antisemitism in the USSR]] reached new heights after 1948 during the campaign against the "[[rootless cosmopolitan]]" (euphemism for "Jew") in which numerous Yiddish-language poets, writers, painters and sculptors were killed or arrested.&lt;ref name="jcws"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Konstantin Azadovskii and Boris Egorov| title=From Anti-Westernism to Anti-Semitism| journal=Journal of Cold War Studies| year=2002| volume=4:1| issue=Winter| pages=66–80| url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~hpcws/egorov.htm#REF31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Myth"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Myth of the Jewish Race| author1=Raphael| author2=Jennifer Patai| year=1989| page=178| publisher=Wayne State University Press| isbn=978-0-8143-1948-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in the so-called [[Doctors' Plot]] (1952–1953).

After the war, the [[Kielce pogrom]] and the "[[March 1968 events]]" in communist Poland represented further incidents of antisemitism in Europe. The [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|anti-Jewish violence in postwar Poland]] has a common theme of [[blood libel]] rumours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/?id=4Iiw0KB31rgC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=Cracow+Kupa+synagogue+ritual+murder | title = Contested memories: Poles and Jews during the Holocaust and its aftermath | isbn = 978-0-8135-3158-8 | author1 = Zimmerman | first1 = Joshua D | year = 2003}}

In Eastern Europe the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the instability of the new states has brought the rise of nationalist movements and the accusation against Jews for the economic crisis, taking over the local economy and bribing the government alongside with traditional and religious motives for antisemitism such as [[blood libel]]s. Most of the antisemitic incidents are against Jewish cemeteries and building (community centers and synagogues).

Such a perception may have arisen by many Jews having strictly kept to their own communities, with their own practices and laws.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=VP81v2Y24HUC&amp;pg=PA9 Page 9] in: {{cite book|title=Anti-Semitism: Its History and Causes|author=Bernard Lazare|publisher=Cosimo, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=9781596056015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that parts of antisemitism arose from a perception of Jewish people as greedy (as often used in [[Stereotypes of Jews#Greed|stereotypes of Jews]]), and this perception has probably evolved in Europe during Medieval times where a large portion of [[Moneylender|money lending]] was operated by Jews.&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=IaloAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=154 Page 154] in: {{cite book|title=The Changing Face of Anti-Semitism: From Ancient Times to the Present Day|author=Walter Laqueur|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2006|isbn=9780199774739}}&lt;/ref&gt; Factors contributing to this situation included that Jews were restricted from other professions,&lt;ref name=Laqueur2006/&gt; while the [[Christian Church]] declared for their followers that money lending constituted immoral "[[usury]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Hawthorne's secret: an un-told tale|jstor=41398742|journal=The Georgia Review|volume=38|issue=3|pages=664–666|author=Philip Young|year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Libya}}
[[Libya]] had once one of the oldest Jewish communities in the world, dating back to 300 BCE. Despite the repression of Jews in the late 1930, as a result of the pro-Nazi Fascist Italian regime, Jews were third of the population of [[Tripoli|Libya]] till 1941. In 1942 the Nazi German troops occupied the Jewish quarter of Benghazi, plundering shops and deporting more than 2,000 Jews across the desert. Sent to work in labor camps, more than one-fifth of this group of Jews perished. A series of pogroms started in November 1945, while more than 140 Jews were killed in [[Tripoli]] and most synagogues in the city looted.&lt;ref name="harris"&gt;Harris, 2001, pp. 149–150.&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon Libya's independence in 1951, most of the Jewish community emigrated from Libya. After the [[Suez Crisis]] in 1956, another series of pogroms forced all but about 100 Jews to flee. When [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] came to power in 1969, all remaining Jewish property was confiscated and all debts to Jews cancelled.

==== Morocco ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Morocco}}

[[Jew]]ish communities, in [[Islam]]ic times often living in [[ghetto]]s known as ''[[mellah]]'', have existed in [[Morocco]] for at least 2,000 years. Intermittent large scale massacres (such as that of [[1033 Fez massacre|6,000 Jews in Fez]] in 1033, over 100,000 Jews in Fez and [[Marrakesh]] in 1146 and again in Marrakesh in 1232)&lt;ref name=Morris10/&gt;&lt;ref name="Morocco"&gt;For the events of Fez see Cohen, 1995, pp 180–182. On Marrekesh, see the ''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' of 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; were accompanied by systematic discrimination through the years.
In 1875, 20 Jews were killed by a mob in [[Demnat]], Morocco; elsewhere in Morocco, Jews were attacked and killed in the streets in broad daylight.&lt;ref name=Gilbert179&gt;[[Martin Gilbert|Gilbert, Martin]]. ''Dearest Auntie Fori. The Story of the Jewish People''. HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 179–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
While the pro-Nazi [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime during [[World War II]] passed discriminatory laws against Jews, [[Mohammed V of Morocco|King Muhammad]] prevented deportation of Jews to death camps (although Jews with French, as opposed to Moroccan, citizenship, being directly subject to Vichy law, were still deported.)
In 1948, approximately 265,000 Jews lived in Morocco. Between 5,000 and 8,000 live there now.
In June 1948, soon after [[Israel]] was established and in the midst of the first Arab-Israeli war, riots against Jews broke out in [[Oujda]] and [[Djerada]], killing 44 Jews. In 1948-9, 18,000 Jews left the country for Israel. After this, Jewish emigration continued (to Israel and elsewhere), but slowed to a few thousand a year. Through the early fifties, [[Zionism|Zionist]] organizations encouraged emigration, particularly in the poorer south of the country, seeing Moroccan Jews as valuable contributors to the Jewish State:
In 1955, Morocco attained independence and emigration to Israel has increased further until 1956 then it was prohibited until 1963, then resumed.[http://rickgold.home.mindspring.com/Emigration/emigration13.htm] By 1967, only 60,000 Jews remained in Morocco.
The [[Six-Day War]] in 1967 led to increased Arab-Jewish tensions worldwide, including Morocco. By 1971, the Jewish population was down to 35,000; however, most of this wave of emigration went to [[Europe]] and [[North America]] rather than [[Israel]].

==== South Africa ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in South Africa}}

Antisemitism has been present in history of [[South Africa]] since Europeans first set foot ashore on the [[Cape Peninsula]]. In the years 1652–1795 Jews were not allowed to settle at the Cape. An 1868 Act would sanction religious discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Milton | first =Shain | title =The roots of antisemitism in South Africa | publisher =Wiwatersrand University Press | year =1994 | location =Johannesburg | pages =9–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antisemitism reached its apotheosis in the years leading up to [[World War II]]. Inspired by the rise of [[national socialism]] in [[Germany]] the [[Ossewabrandwag]] (OB) – whose membership accounted for almost 25% of the 1940 [[Afrikaner]] population – and the National Party faction ''New Order'' would champion a more programmatic solution to the 'Jewish problem'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/south-africa/23.htm|title=South Africa - The Impact of World War II|website=countrystudies.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Tunisia ====
{{Further|History of the Jews in Tunisia}}

Jews have lived in Tunisia for at least 2,300 years. In the 13th century, Jews were expelled from their homes in [[Kairouan]] and were ultimately restricted to ghettos, known as ''hara''. Forced to wear distinctive clothing, several Jews earned high positions in the Tunisian government. Several prominent international traders were Tunisian Jews. From 1855 to 1864, [[Muhammad Bey]] relaxed dhimmi laws, but reinstated them in the face of anti-Jewish riots that continued at least until 1869.
Tunisia, as the only Middle Eastern country under direct [[Nazism|Nazi]] control during World War II, was also the site of racist antisemitic measures activities such as the yellow star, prison camps, deportations, and other persecution.
In 1948, approximately 105,000 Jews lived in [[Tunisia]]. Only about 1,500 remain there today. Following Tunisia's independence from France in 1956, a number of anti-Jewish policies led to emigration, of which half went to Israel and the other half to France. After attacks in 1967, Jewish emigration both to Israel and [[France]] accelerated. There were also attacks in 1982, 1985, and most recently in 2002 when a suicide bombing&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrucci|first=Filippo|last2=Fois|first2=Marisa|date=2016-03-03|title=Attitudes towards Israel in Tunisian political debate: from Bourguiba to the new constitution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|journal=The Journal of North African Studies|volume=21|issue=3|pages=392–410|doi=10.1080/13629387.2016.1152188|issn=1362-9387}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Djerba]] took 21 lives (most of them German tourists) near the local synagogue, in a terrorist attack claimed by [[Al-Qaeda]]. 

In modern-day Tunisia, there have been many instances of antisemitic acts and statements. Since the government is not quick to condemn them, antisemitism spreads throughout Tunisian society.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|last=Israeli|first=Raphael|title=Anti-Semitism under the Guise of Anti-Zionism and Anti-Israelism|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315124933-6|work=Muslim Anti-Semitism in Christian Europe|pages=149–189|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315124933|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Ben Ali regime, there have been an increasing number of public offenses against Jews in Tunisia. For example, in February 2012, when Egyptian cleric Wagdi Ghanaim entered Tunisia, he was welcomed by Islamists who chanted "Death to the Jews" as a sign of their support. The following month, during protests in Tunis, a Salafi sheikh told young Tunisians to gather and learn to kill Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the past, The Tunisian government has made efforts to block Jews from entering high positions, and some moderate members have tried to cover up the more extremist anti-Semitic efforts by appointing Jews to governmental positions, however, it is known that Muslim clerics believe that if the Muslim Brotherhood leads the regime, that will enhance their hatred towards Jews.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In response to the prevalent anti-Semitism, the Tunisian government has publicly protected the dwindling population and its marks of Jewish culture, for example, synagogues, and advised them to settle in Djerba, a French tourist attraction.  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/world/tunisian-synagogue-blast-called-accident.html|title=Tunisian Synagogue Blast Called Accident|last=Jr.|first=Donald G.

Other cartoons in the contest were antisemitic as well. The national director of the Anti-Defamation League, Abraham Foxman, condemned the cartoon, stating that "Here's the anti-Semitic notion of Jews and their love for money, the canard that Jews 'control' Wall Street, and a cynical perversion of the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism," and "Once again Iran takes the prize for promoting antisemitism."&lt;ref name="The Algemeiner"&gt;{{cite news|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Wins Iranian Festival Prize|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/11/anti-semitic-cartoon-wins-iranian-festival-prize/|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Algemeiner|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jewish Chronicle"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rocker|first=Simon|title=Iran gives antisemitic cartoon top prize|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/69827/iran-gives-antisemitic-cartoon-top-prize|accessdate=11 July 2012|newspaper=The Jewish Chronicle|date=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ADL&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Semitic Cartoon Declared Winner Of Iranian 'Wall Street Downfall' Festival|url=http://altwire.utne.com/zine/israel-palestine_new/antisemitic-cartoon-declared-winner-of-i/5547314632322f6f30586535547a61726a6e747545413d3d|website=The Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese first learned about antisemitism in 1918, during the cooperation of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] with the [[White movement]] in [[Siberia]]. [[White Army#Structure|White Army]] soldiers had been issued copies of ''The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'', and "The ''Protocols'' continue to be used as evidence of Jewish conspiracies even though they are widely acknowledged to be a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8yetAgAAQBAJ Esther Webman, ''The Global Impact of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion: A Century-Old Myth,'' Jewish Studies Series, Routledge, 2012.] {{ISBN|1136706100}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], [[Nazi Germany]] encouraged Japan to adopt antisemitic policies. In the post-war period, [[Extremism|extremist groups]] and [[ideologues]] have promoted [[conspiracy theories]].

In 2004, [[Al-Manar]], a media network affiliated with [[Hezbollah]], aired a drama series, ''The Diaspora'', which observers allege is based on historical antisemitic allegations.

Although [[Malaysia]] presently has no substantial Jewish population, the country has reportedly become an example of a phenomenon called "antisemitism without Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Jonathan|title=Klezmer America : Jewishness, ethnicity, modernity|date=2008|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14278-6|page=140|edition=1st}} Hyphenation added by Fulford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fulford|first1=Robert|title=Anti-Semitism without Jews in Malaysia|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/m/wp/full-comment/blog.html?b=fullcomment.nationalpost.com/2012/10/06/robert-fulford-anti-semitism-without-jews-in-malaysia|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=''[[National Post]]''|date=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise on Malay identity, "The Malay Dilemma," which was published in 1970, former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]] wrote: "The Jews are not only hooked-nosed... but understand money instinctively.... Jewish stinginess and financial wizardry gained them the economic control of Europe and provoked antisemitism which waxed and waned throughout Europe through the ages."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rabbi-abraham-cooper/malaysia-anti-semitism_b_903767.html In Malaysia, When in Doubt, Blame the Jews] by Rabbi Abraham Cooper, ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 22 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay-language [[Utusan Malaysia]] daily stated in an editorial that Malaysians "cannot allow anyone, especially the Jews, to interfere secretly in this country's business... When the drums are pounded hard in the name of human rights, the pro-Jewish people will have their best opportunity to interfere in any Islamic country," the newspaper said. "We might not realize that the enthusiasm to support actions such as demonstrations will cause us to help foreign groups succeed in their mission of controlling this country."

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1987-004-09A, Amin al Husseini und Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|[[Haj Amin al-Husseini]] is a central figure of [[Palestinian nationalism]] in Mandatory Palestine. He took refuge and collaborated with Nazi Germany during World War II. He met [[Adolf Hitler]] in December 1941. Scholarly opinion is divided on the Mufti's antisemitsm, with many scholars viewing him as a staunch antisemite&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|1961|p=231}},&lt;/ref&gt; while some deny the appropriateness of the term, or argue that he became antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laurens|2002|pp=467,469–470}};'In terms of his initial formation, Haj Amin was far from being an antisemite. He had learnt French at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] institute in Jerusalem and [[Albert Antébi]] had been one of his mentors. In the interwar period, he had fought Zionism as a political and religious leader. He was then of the opinion that the aim of Zionism was to expel the Arabs of Palestine and take over the [[Haram al-Sharif]] in order to build the [[Third Temple]]. Gradually (''progressivement'') he was persuaded that world Judaism supported Zionists in an secretive manner and exercised a major influence over decision-making in Great Britain and the United States. For some time (during WW2) he was certain (based on real facts) that the Zionists were seeking to assassinate him. … It is evident that he gradually came to identify his battle in Palestine with that of Germany against world Judaism. The reading of all those passages in his memoirs devoted to his European sojourn reveal an assimilation of the content of european antisemitism, with their two great themes of the identification of Judaism with financial capitalism (Anglo-Saxons), and of the [[Stab-in-the-back myth|legend of the stab in the back]] (the Jews as responsible for the two world wars). On the other hand, a racist vision of world history is totally absent from his general worldview. … Taken together, his writings after 1945 do not show him as having an attitude of [[negationism|holocaust denial]], whilst Arab politicians of the first rank, in the period of Eichmann's trial, had begun to adopt (precisely) this kind of discourse.'&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In March 2011, the Israeli government issued a paper claiming that "Anti-Israel and anti-Semitic messages are heard regularly in the government and private media and in the mosques and are taught in school books," to the extent that they are "an integral part of the fabric of life inside the PA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Gov't aggressively goes after Palestinian incitement |author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Govt-aggressively-goes-after-Palestinian-incitement |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Israeli Strategic Affairs Ministry director-general Yossi Kuperwasser stated that Palestinian incitement to antisemitism is "going on all the time" and that it is "worrying and disturbing." At an institutional level, he said the PA has been promoting three key messages to the Palestinian people that constitute incitement: "that the Palestinians would eventually be the sole sovereign on all the land from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea; that Jews, especially those who live in Israel, were not really human beings but rather 'the scum of mankind'; and that all tools were legitimate in the struggle against Israel and the Jews."&lt;ref name="kuperwasser"&gt;{{cite news |title='Palestinian incitement continuing unabated'|author= |url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Palestinian-incitement-continuing-unabated |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=13 August 2012 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, the [[Hamas]]' spokesman in Doha said on live television that [[Blood libel|Jews use blood to make matzos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/384542/top-hamas-offical-jews-use-blood-matzos-molly-wharton Top Hamas Official: Jews Use Blood for Matzos]."

According to a 2004 report from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], antisemitism had increased significantly in Europe since 2000, with significant increases in verbal attacks against Jews and vandalism such as graffiti, fire bombings of Jewish schools, desecration of synagogues and cemeteries. Germany, France, Britain, and Russia are the countries with the highest rate of antisemitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp" /&gt; The Netherlands and Sweden have also consistently had high rates of antisemitic attacks since 2000.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The 2005 U.S. State Department Report on Global Antisemitism.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claim that recent European antisemitic violence can actually be seen as a spillover from the long running [[Arab–Israeli conflict|Arab-Israeli conflict]] since the majority of the perpetrators are from the [[Islam in Europe|large Muslim immigrant communities in European cities]]. However, compared to France, the United Kingdom and much of the rest of Europe, in Germany Arab and pro-Palestinian groups are involved in only a small percentage of antisemitic incidents.&lt;ref name = "mgjmsp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ Stephen Roth Institute, Tel Aviv University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070817134910/http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/ |date=17 August 2007 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism'', most of the more extreme attacks on Jewish sites and physical attacks on Jews in Europe come from militant Islamic and Muslim groups, and most Jews tend to be assaulted in countries where groups of young Muslim immigrants reside.&lt;ref name=roth&gt;[http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2004/general-analysis.htm GENERAL ANALYSIS 2004], The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, Tel Aviv University.

On 1 January 2006, Britain's chief [[rabbi]], Lord [[Jonathan Sacks]], warned that what he called a "tsunami of antisemitism" was spreading globally. In an interview with [[BBC Radio 4]], Sacks said: "A number of my rabbinical colleagues throughout Europe have been assaulted and attacked on the streets. We've had synagogues desecrated. We've had Jewish schools burnt to the ground—not here but in France. People are attempting to silence and even ban Jewish societies on campuses on the grounds that Jews must support the state of Israel, therefore they should be banned, which is quite extraordinary because... British Jews see themselves as British citizens. So it's that kind of feeling that you don't know what's going to happen next that's making... some European Jewish communities uncomfortable."&lt;ref name=Gillan&gt;Gillan, Audrey.

Following an escalation in antisemitism in 2012, which included the [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|deadly shooting of three children]] at a Jewish school in France, the [[European Jewish Congress]] demanded in July a more proactive response. EJC President Moshe Kantor explained, "We call on authorities to take a more proactive approach so there would be no reason for statements of regret and denunciation. All these smaller attacks remind me of smaller tremors before a massive earthquake. The Jewish community cannot afford to be subject to an earthquake and the authorities cannot say that the writing was not on the wall." He added that European countries should take legislative efforts to ban any form of [[incitement]], as well as to equip the authorities with the necessary tools to confront any attempt to expand [[terrorist]] and violent activities against Jewish communities in Europe.&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|last=Shamee|first=Maureen|title='Proactive' response needed to escalation of anti-Semitic attacks across Europe, says European Jewish Congress|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/uk/59964|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=European Jewish Press|date=6 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4 months later, in July 2012, a French Jewish teenager wearing a "distinctive religious symbol" was the victim of a violent antisemitic attack on a train travelling between Toulouse and Lyon. The teen was first verbally harassed and later beaten up by two assailants. [[Richard Prasquier]] from the French Jewish umbrella group, [[Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France|CRIF]], called the attack "another development in the worrying trend of anti-Semitism in our country."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack Read more: Toulouse yeshiva student beaten up in anti-Semitic attack|newspaper=[[Times of Israel]]|date=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another incident in July 2012 dealt with the vandalism of the synagogue of [[Noisy-le-Grand]] of the [[Seine-Saint-Denis]] district in [[Paris]]. The synagogue was vandalized three times in a ten-day period. Prayer books and shawls were thrown on the floor, windows were shattered, drawers were ransacked, and walls, tables, clocks, and floors were vandalized. The authorities were alerted of the incidents by the Bureau National de Vigilance Contre L'Antisémtisme (BNVCA), a French antisemitism watchdog group, which called for more measures to be taken to prevent future hate crimes. BNVCA President Sammy Ghozlan stated that, "Despite the measures taken, things persist, and I think that we need additional legislation, because the Jewish community is annoyed."&lt;ref name=Algemeiner1&gt;{{cite news|title=French Synagogue Vandalized For Third Time in Ten Days|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/07/12/french-synagogue-vandalized-for-third-time-in-ten-days/|accessdate=13 July 2012|newspaper=Algemeiner|date=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, [[Abraham Cooper]], the dean of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], met French Interior Minister [[Manuel Valls]] and reported that antisemitic attacks against French Jews increased by 40% since [[Toulouse and Montauban shootings|Merah's shooting spree]] in [[Toulouse]].

In July 2012, two women were assaulted in Germany, sprayed with tear gas, and were shown a "[[Nazi salute|Hitler salute]]," apparently because of a [[Star of David]] necklace that they wore.&lt;ref name="Frauen im"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nordbayern.de/region/fuerth/frauen-im-freizeitbad-beleidigt-und-mit-reizgas-bespruht-1.2227517 | title=Frauen im Freizeitbad beleidigt und mit Reizgas besprüht | publisher=Nordbayern | date=3 August 2012 | accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August 2012, [[Berlin]] police investigated an attack on a 53-year-old rabbi and his 6-year-old daughter, allegedly by four Arab teens, after which the rabbi needed treatment for head wounds at a hospital. The police classified the attack as a hate crime. ''Jüdische Allgemeine'' reported that the rabbi was wearing a [[kippah]] and was approached by one of the teens, who asked the rabbi if he was Jewish. The teen then attacked the rabbi while yelling antisemitic comments, and threatened to kill the rabbi's daughter. Berlin's mayor condemned the attack, saying that "Berlin is an international city in which intolerance, xenophobia and anti-Semitism are not being tolerated. Police will undertake all efforts to find and arrest the perpetrators."&lt;ref name="VoNG"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vosizneias.com/112634/2012/08/29/germany-berlin-rabbi-and-his-six-year-old-daughter-become-victims-of-a-hate-crime/ | title=Germany – Berlin Rabbi And His Six-Year-Old Daughter Become Victims Of A Hate Crime | publisher=Vos Iz Neias | date=29 August 2012 | accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, various historians, including Dr. Julius H. Schoeps, a prominent German-Jewish historian and a member of the German Interior Ministry's commission to combat antisemitism, charged the majority of [[Bundestag]] deputies with failing to understand antisemitism and the imperativeness of periodic legislative reports on German antisemitism. Schoeps cited various antisemitic statements by German parliament members as well. The report in question determined that 15% of Germans are antisemitic while over 20% espouse "latent anti-Semitism," but the report has been criticized for downplaying the sharpness of antisemitism in Germany, as well as for failing to examine anti-Israel media coverage in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=289609 | title=Historian slams Germany for ignoring anti-semitism | publisher=The Jerusalem Post | date=28 October 2012 | accessdate=29 October 2012 |author=Weinthal, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Greece====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Greece}}

Antisemitism in Greece manifests itself in religious, political and media discourse. The recent [[Greek government-debt crisis]] has facilitated the rise of far right groups in Greece, most notably the formerly obscure [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]].
Jews have lived in Greece since antiquity, but the largest community of around 20,000 [[Sephardic Jews]] settled in [[Thessalonica]] after an invitation from the [[Ottoman Sultan]] in the 15th century. After Thessalonica was annexed to Greece in 1913, the Greek government recognized Jews as Greek citizens with full rights and attributed Judaism the status of a recognized and protected religion. Currently in Greece, Jewish communities representing the 5,000 Greek Jews are legal entities under public law. 
According to the [[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]] (Anti-Defamation League) report of 2015, the "ADL Global 100", a report of the status of antisemitism in 100 countries around the world, 69% of the adult population in Greece harbor antisemitic attitudes and 85% think that "Jews have too much power in the business world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ADL Global 100: Greece|url=http://global100.adl.org/#country/greece/2014|website=ADL Global 100|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In March 2015, a survey about the Greeks' perceptions of the holocaust was published. Its findings showed that less than 60 percent of the respondents think that holocaust teaching should be included in the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=van Versendaal|first1=Harry|title=Victimhood culture spawns Greek anti-Semitism, study finds|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/168389/article/ekathimerini/community/victimhood-culture-spawns-greek-anti-semitism-study-finds|accessdate=31 August 2015|work=ekathimerini|date=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jobbik-NewHungarianGuard-May2013.jpg|thumb|150px|Members of the New Hungarian Guard stand at a Jobbik rally against a gathering of the [[World Jewish Congress]] in Budapest, 4 May 2013]]
In the 21st century, antisemitism in Hungary has evolved and received an institutional framework, while verbal and physical aggression against Jews has escalated, creating a great difference between its earlier manifestations in the 1990s and recent developments. One of the major representatives of this institutionalized antisemitic ideology is the popular Hungarian party [[Jobbik]], which received 17 percent of the vote in the April 2010 national election. The far-right subculture, which ranges from nationalist shops to radical-nationalist and neo-Nazi festivals and events, plays a major role in the institutionalization of Hungarian antisemitism in the 21st century. The contemporary antisemitic rhetoric has been updated and expanded, but is still based on the old antisemitic notions. The traditional accusations and motifs include such phrases as Jewish occupation, international Jewish conspiracy, Jewish responsibility for the [[Treaty of Trianon]], Judeo-Bolshevism, as well as blood libels against Jews. Nevertheless, the past few years have seen the reemergence of the blood libel and an increase in Holocaust relativization and denial, while the monetary crisis has revived references to the "Jewish banker class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jcpa.org/article/anti-semitism-in-hungary/|title=Anti-Semitism in Hungary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
{{Main|Antisemitism in 21st-century Italy}}

The ongoing political conflict between Israel and Palestine has played an important role in the development and expression of [[antisemitism in the 21st century]], and in Italy as well. The [[Second Intifada]], which began in late September 2000, has set in motion unexpected mechanisms, whereby traditional anti-Jewish prejudices were mixed with politically based stereotypes.&lt;ref name=EUMC&gt;{{cite web|title=Manifestations of anti-Semitism in the European Union|url=http://www.erinnern.at/bundeslaender/oesterreich/e_bibliothek/antisemitismus-1/431_anti-semitism_in_the_european_union.pdf|publisher=EUMC|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, Israeli Jews were charged with full responsibility for the fate of the peace process and with the conflict presented as embodying the struggle between good (the Palestinians) and evil (the Israeli Jews).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Antisemitism Summary overview of the situation in the European Union 2001–2011|url=http://fra.europa.eu/sites/default/files/fra_uploads/2215-FRA-2012-Antisemitism-update-2011_EN.pdf|publisher=FRA|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
{{Further|History of the Jews in the Netherlands}}
The [[Netherlands]] has the second highest incidence of antisemitic incidents in the European Union. However, it is difficult to obtain exact figures because the specific groups against whom attacks are made are not specifically identified in police reports, and analyses of police data for antisemitism therefore relies on key-word searches, e.g. "Jew" or "Israel". According to Centre for Information and Documentation on Israel (CIDI), a pro-Israel lobby group in the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Over CIDI (Dutch)|url=http://www.cidi.nl/over-cidi/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number of antisemitic incidents reported in the whole of the Netherlands was 108 in 2008, 93 in 2009, and 124 in 2010. Some two thirds of this are acts of aggression. There are approximately 52 000 [[History of the Jews in the Netherlands|Dutch Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Nieuwe CIDI Monitor antisemitisme" (Dutch)|url=http://www.niw.nl/nieuwe-cidi-monitor-antisemitisme/|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the NRC Handelsblad newspaper, the number of antisemitic incidents in [[Amsterdam]] was 14 in 2008 and 30 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Berkhout, Karel.

Retrieved on 1 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Raphaël Evers, an [[Orthodox judaism|orthodox]] rabbi in [[Amsterdam]], told the [[Norway|Norwegian]] newspaper [[Aftenposten]] that Jews can no longer be safe in the city anymore due to the risk of violent assaults. "We Jews no longer feel at home here in the Netherlands. Many people talk about moving to Israel," he said.&lt;ref name="aftenposten.no"&gt;[http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece Hets av jøder er økende i Europa – Aftenposten] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120411225535/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/uriks/article3584266.ece |date=11 April 2012 }}. Aftenposten.no. Retrieved 2 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Anne Frank Foundation]], antisemitism in the Netherlands in 2011 was roughly at the same level as in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nieuwe rapportage – anne frank|url=http://m.annefrank.org/key/aWQ9MTUwMjQmbGM9bmw=|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual antisemitic incidents increased from 19 in 2010 to 30 in 2011. Verbal antisemitic incidents dropped slightly from 1173 in 2010 to 1098 in 2011. This accounts for 75%–80% of all verbal racist incidents in the Netherlands. Antisemitism is more prevalent in the age group 23–27 years, which is a younger group than that of racist incidents in general.

====Norway====
{{Main|Antisemitism in Norway}}
In 2010, the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]] after one year of research, revealed that antisemitism was common among some 8th, 9th, and 10th graders in Oslo's schools. Teachers at schools with large numbers of [[Muslim]]s revealed that Muslim students often "praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of [[Jew]]s", that "Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students" and that "Muslims laugh or command [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the [[Holocaust]]". Additionally, "while some students might protest when some express support for [[terrorism]], none object when students express hate of Jews", saying that it says in "the [[Quran]] that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One [[Jew]]ish father also stated that his child had been taken by a Muslim mob after school (though the child managed to escape), reportedly "to be taken out to the forest and [[lynching|hung]] because he was a Jew".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|work=NRK Lørdagsrevyen|title=Jødiske blir hetset|date=13 March 2010|access-date=5 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419230618/http://www1.nrk.no/nett-tv/indeks/205057|archive-date=19 April 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=What about Norwegian anti-Semitism?|url=http://theforeigner.no/pages/columns/what-about-norwegian-anti-semitism/|accessdate=15 February 2014|newspaper=The Foreigner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian Education Minister Kristin Halvorsen referred to the antisemitism reported in this study as being "completely unacceptable."

In 2017 an [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]] survey found that the levels of anti-Semitism in Great Britain were among the lowest in the world, with 2.4% expressing multiple anti-Semitic attitudes, and about 70% having a favourable opinion of Jews. However, only 17% had a favourable opinion of Israel, with 33% holding an unfavourable view.&lt;ref name=bbc-20170913&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41241353 |title=Over a quarter of British people 'hold anti-Semitic attitudes', study finds |last=May |first=Callum |work=BBC News |date=13 September 2017 |accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jpr-201709&gt;{{cite report |url=http://www.jpr.org.uk/documents/JPR.2017.Antisemitism_in_contemporary_Great_Britain.pdf |title=Antisemitism in contemporary Great Britain |author=L.

In 2017, a report by the Campaign Against Antisemitism (CAA) found that the previous year, 2016, had been the worst on record for antisemitic hate crime in the UK.&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://antisemitism.uk/crime|title=National Antisemitic Crime Audit|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=1 May 2016|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to that, 2015 had been the worst year on record, and 2014 was the worst year on record before that. The report found that in 2016, antisemitic crime rose by 15% compared to 2015, or 45% compared to 2014. It also found that 1 in 10 antisemitic crimes was violent. Despite rising levels of antisemitic crime, the report said there had been a decrease in the [[Criminal charge|charging]] of antisemitic crime. In the report's foreword, the CAA's Chairman wrote: "Britain has the political will to fight antisemitism and strong laws with which to do it, but those responsible for tackling the rapidly growing racist targeting of British Jews are failing to enforce the law. There is a very real danger of Jewish citizens emigrating, as has happened elsewhere in Europe unless there is radical change."&lt;ref name="Campaign Against Antisemitism"/&gt;

Every year since 2015, the CAA has commissioned polling by [[YouGov]] concerning the attitude of the British public toward British Jews. In 2017, their polling found that 36% of British adults believed at least one of the antisemitic statements pollsters had shown them to be true, a reduction from 39% in 2016 and 45% in 2015. Additionally, the polling revealed widespread fear amongst British Jews, with almost 1 in 3 saying that they had considered emigrating in the last two years due to antisemitism, and 37% saying that they concealed their Judaism in public. The report gave various indications as to the cause of the fears, with British Jews identifying Islamist antisemitism, far-left antisemitism and far-right antisemitism as their main concerns, in that order. 78% of British Jews saying that they had witnessed antisemitism disguised as a political comment about Israel, 76% thoughts that political developments were contributing antisemitism, and 52% felt that the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] was not doing enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|title=Antisemitism Barometer|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|date=11 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205173252/https://antisemitism.uk/barometer/|archive-date=5 February 2017|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antisemitism.uk/barometer-full-report|title=Annual Antisemitic Barometer 2015 Full Report|type=PDF|publisher=Campaign Against Antisemitism|access-date=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a group of British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Members of Parliament]] set up an inquiry into antisemitism, which published its findings in 2006. Its report stated that "until recently, the prevailing opinion both within the Jewish community and beyond [had been] that antisemitism had receded to the point that it existed only on the margins of society." It found a reversal of this progress since 2000. The inquiry was reconstituted following a surge in antisemitic incidents in Britain during the summer of 2014, and the new inquiry published its report in 2015, making recommendations for reducing antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/129862/key-recommendations-include-call-police-and-council-involvement|title=Key recommendations include call for police and council involvement|website=www.thejc.com|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although antisemitism in Canada is less prevalent than in many other countries, there have been recent incidents. For example, a 2004 study identified 24 incidents of antisemitism between 14 March and 14 July 2004 in Newfoundland, Montreal, Quebec City, Ottawa, the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), and some smaller Ontario communities. The incidents included vandalism and other attacks on four synagogues, six cemeteries, four schools, and a number of businesses and private residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/phas/phas-prutschi-f04.htm|title=Anti-Semitism in Canada  - Manuel Prutschi|website=www.jcpa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2005, the [[U.S. Commission on Civil Rights]] examined antisemitism on college campuses. It reported that "incidents of threatened bodily injury, physical intimidation or property damage are now rare", but antisemitism still occurs on many campuses and is a "serious problem." The Commission recommended that the [[U.S. Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] protect college students from antisemitism through vigorous enforcement of ''Title VI'' of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and further recommended that [[United States Congress|Congress]] clarify that Title VI applies to discrimination against Jewish students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusccr.com/Ending%20Campus%20Ant-Semitism1.htm Ending Campus Anti-Semitism].

On 19 September 2006, [[Yale University]] founded the [[Yale Initiative for the Interdisciplinary Study of Anti-Semitism]] (YIISA), the first North American university-based center for study of the subject, as part of its Institution for Social and Policy Studies. Director [[Charles A.

After carrying out a routine review, the faculty review committee said that the initiative had not met its research and teaching standards. [[Donald Green]], then head of Yale's Institution for Social and Policy Studies, the body under whose aegis the antisemitism initiative was run, said that it had not had many papers published in the relevant leading journals or attracted many students.

A 2007 survey by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) concluded that 15% of Americans hold antisemitic views, which was in-line with the average of the previous ten years, but a decline from the 29% of the early sixties. The survey concluded that education was a strong predictor, "with most educated Americans being remarkably free of prejudicial views." The belief that Jews have too much power was considered a common antisemitic view by the ADL. Other views indicating antisemitism, according to the survey, include the view that Jews are more loyal to Israel than America, and that they are responsible for the death of [[Jesus|Jesus of Nazareth]]. The survey found that antisemitic Americans are likely to be intolerant generally, e.g. regarding immigration and free-speech. The 2007 survey also found that 29% of foreign-born [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanics]] and 32% of [[African American|African-Americans]] hold strong antisemitic beliefs, three times more than the 10% for whites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Anti_semitism/poll_2007/ ADL Survey: American Attitudes Towards Jews in America].

In August 2012, the [[California state assembly]] approved a [[non-binding resolution]] that "encourages university leaders to combat a wide array of anti-Jewish and anti-Israel actions," although the resolution "is purely symbolic and does not carry policy implications."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/calif-resolution-denouncing-anti-semitism-on-college-campuses-targets-anti-israel-protests/2012/08/29/17a0188a-f1b2-11e1-b74c-84ed55e0300b_story.html|title=Calif. resolution denouncing anti-Semitism on college campuses targets anti-Israel protests|website=washingtonpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, ''[[Politico|Politico Magazine]]'' published an article purporting to show links between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]], Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] and the Jewish outreach organization [[Chabad-Lubavitch]]. The article was widely condemned, with the head of the Anti-Defamation League [[Jonathan Greenblatt]] saying that it "evokes age-old myths about Jews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zalman|first1=Jonathan|title=Politico’s Dubious Chabad Story Receives Widespread Criticism|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/229930/politicos-dubious-chabad-story-receives-widespread-criticism|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=Tablet Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Politico goes full ‘Elders of Zion,’ silenced by the college mob &amp; other comments|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/10/politico-goes-full-elders-of-zion-silenced-by-the-college-mob-other-comments/|accessdate=10 April 2017|publisher=New York Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, Jonathan Greenblatt, national director and CEO of the Anti-Defamation League, stated in an interview, “While anti-Semitic attitudes have remained consistent at 14%... anti-Semitic incidents have been on the rise. In 2016 we saw a 34% increase over the prior year in acts of harassment, vandalism, or violence directed at Jewish individuals and institutions. During the first three quarters of 2017, there was a 67% increase over the same period in 2016. We’ve seen double the number of incidents in K-12 schools, and almost a 60% increase on college campuses." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://reformjudaism.org/blog/2017/11/27/we-cant-just-rely-old-tactics|title=We Can't Just Rely on the Old Tactics|website=ReformJudaism.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Arsenault-Cameron v Prince Edward Island''''', [2000] 1 S.C.R. 3, 2000 SCC 1, is a landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on [[minority language]] rights. The Court found that the numbers of Francophone children in [[Summerside, Prince Edward Island|Summerside]], [[Prince Edward Island]] warranted [[French language|French-language]] education in Summerside, under [[Section Twenty-three of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 23]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'', and the province was constitutionally obligated to create a French language school.

==Background==
A number of Francophone families living in Summerside made a request to the [[French Language Board]] to build a French-language school in the community rather than bus the children to the closest French school 57 minutes away. The Board made a proposal to the [[Minister (government)|Minister]] which was rejected.

The family applied for a declaration against the province to build a school in Summerside. At trial the declaration was granted but was overturned on appeal.

In the decision of ''Arsenault-Cameron v. Prince Edward Island'', [1999] 3 S.C.R. 851, prior to the language rights hearing, the counsel for the government sought to have [[Bastarache]] recuse himself for [[reasonable apprehension of bias]] due to his history of championing the French language. In an application to Bastarache, he held that he was not biased to hear the case, and so did not recuse himself.

==Opinion of the Court==
Major and Bastarache, writing for a unanimous court, applied a [[purposive interpretation]] to section 23 of the ''Charter''. He found that the purpose of the right is to redress past injustices and provide "an official language minority with equal access to high quality education in its own language in circumstances where community development will be enhanced."

'''Arthur Asa Berger''' (born 1933) is Professor Emeritus in Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts at [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sagepub.com/authorDetails.nav?contribId=501254&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
He received a "Catholic" education in his public high school despite the fact that he is Jewish. Most of his teachers were [[Catholics]] who were educated at [[Boston College]] or [[College of the Holy Cross]]. He gradually developed interest in writing and drawing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.enculturation.net/writing-myself-into-existence&lt;/ref&gt;
He got a B.A. in literature and philosophy at the University of Massachusetts in 1954, assuming that a good education would fit him for any job. Then he applied to graduate school in journalism, thinking that he liked to write and might find journalism an interesting career. He was accepted into the [[University of California Berkeley]] journalism school and started there in the summer of 1954 but transferred to the University of Iowa where he could work with people like Marguerite Young. He was also able to take a couple of philosophy courses with [[Gustav Bergmann]] from the Vienna Circle. He was drafted in the summer of 1956, eleven days after he received his MA. He got out of the Army in 1958 and went to Europe for a year.

==Academic career==
[[File:پروفسور برگر.jpg|thumb|Arthur Asa Berger during a lecture at [[University of Tehran]] in May 2015]]
A year after he came back from Europe, he enrolled at the University of Minnesota’s program for a Ph.D in [[American Studies]]. In time, he ended up teaching in the Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts department at [[San Francisco State University]] where he taught courses on writing and media criticism. Berger has published more than 130 articles and more than 70 books in the course of his career.  He spent 1963-64 as a [[U.S.-Italy Fulbright Commission|Fulbright]] scholar at the University of Milan and has also taught at Jinan University and Tsing Hua university in China, spent a month as a Fulbright Senior Specialist lecturing on semiotics in Argentina and lectured in more than a dozen universities in various countries.&lt;ref&gt;Ralon, L. (2012), Interview with Arthur Asa Berger Professor Emeritus Broadcast and Electronic Communication Arts [[San Francisco State University]].The Popular Culture Studies Journal, Vol. 1, No. 1&amp;2,  126-137&lt;/ref&gt; His works have been cited thousands of times by international academics.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RPJrfN0AAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Berger is married to Philis Berger and they have two children. Their son Gabriel went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] for his BA and has a Ph.D. in
mathematics from Columbia.  He works for Google now.  Their daughter Nina has a doctorate from an institute that trains psychoanalysts and is a psychoanalyst. [[Jason Berger]] was his brother. He manages his personal weblog named ''Decoder Man''.&lt;ref&gt;http://decoderman.blogspot.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Baroque''' ({{IPAc-en|US|b|ə|ˈ|r|oʊ|k}} or {{IPAc-en|UK|b|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|k}}) is a highly ornate and often extravagant [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of architecture, art and music that flourished in Europe from the early 17th until the mid-18th century.  It followed the [[Renaissance style]] and preceded the [[Rococo]] (in the past often referred to as "late Baroque") and [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] styles. It was encouraged by the [[Catholic Church]] as a means to counter the simplicity and austerity of [[Protestant]] architecture, art and music, though [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed in parts of Europe as well.&lt;ref name="Heal2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=1 December 2011|title=‘Better Papist than Calvinist’: Art and Identity in Later Lutheran Germany|journal=German History|publisher=German History Society|volume=29|issue=4|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baroque style used contrast, movement,  exuberant detail, deep colour, grandeur and surprise to achieve a sense of awe.  The style began at the start of the 17th century in Rome,  then spread rapidly to France, northern Italy, Spain and Portugal, then to Austria and southern Germany. By the 1730s, it had evolved into an even more flamboyant style, called ''[[rocaille]]'' or ''[[Rococo]]'', which appeared in France and central Europe until the mid to late 18th century.

==Origin of word==
The word ''baroque'' was a Portuguese term for a pearl (barocco) with an irregular shape. Cognates for the term in other Romance languages include: ''barroco'' in Portuguese, ''barrueco''&lt;!--Antes de corregir esto al "barroco", por favor, verifique la fuente citada, y tenga en cuenta que esta palabra es un sustantivo que significa "perla barroca".--&gt; in Spanish, and ''barocco'' in Italian.&lt;ref&gt; Oxford English Dictionary on-line definition of Baroque&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in French to describe pearls in a 1531 inventory of [[Charles V of France|Charles V's]] treasures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.es/books?id=CMdwCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR28&amp;lpg=PR28&amp;dq=baroque+1531+Oxford+English+Dictionary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zptCm4Wxki&amp;sig=45xkAmnoROBehwvsaY3xADkg_jc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjE1rnTsNDYAhULtRQKHZrrBXQQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=baroque%201531%20Oxford%20English%20Dictionary&amp;f=false Michael Meere, ''French Renaissance and Baroque Drama: Text, Performance, Theory''], Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2015, {{ISBN|1611495490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, the term was usually used to describe music.  In an anonymous satirical review of the première of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]]'' in October 1733, which was printed in the ''[[Mercure de France]]'' in May 1734, the critic wrote that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque", complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was unsparing with dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.&lt;ref&gt;Claude V. Palisca, "Baroque". ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and composer as well as philosopher,  wrote in 1768 in the ''[[Encyclopédie]]'':   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"&gt;''Encyclopedie''; ''Lettre sur la Musique Francaise'' under the direction of [[Denis Diderot]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word was first used to describe the period of art that followed the [[Renaissance]] in 1855 by the Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]] in an article in the journal ''[[Cicerone|Le Cicerone]]''. He used the term to attack the movement for subverting the values of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, "Les Styles en Architecture'', (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;  The term "style baroque" did not enter into the [[Dictionnaire de l'Académie française|dictionary]] of the [[Académie française]] until 1878, when it lost its original negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Panofsky |first=Erwin |chapter=What is Baroque? |title=Three Essays on Style |publisher=The MIT Press |year=1995 |page=19 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1888, the art historian [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] published the first serious academic work on the style, ''Renaissance und Barock'', which described the differences between the painting, sculpture, and architecture of the Renaissance and the Baroque.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Owen, ''Les Styles en Architecture'' (2014), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture: origins and characteristics==
{{Main|Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Triumph of the Name of Jesus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''Quadratura'' or [[trompe-l'œil]]  ceiling of the Church of the Jesu, Rome, by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] (1669–1683)]]
The Baroque style of architecture was a result of doctrines adopted by the [[Catholic Church]] at the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545–63, in response to the [[Protestant Reformation]]. The first phase of the [[Counter-Reformation]] had imposed a severe, academic style on religious architecture, which had appealed to intellectuals but not the mass of churchgoers.  The Council of Trent decided instead to appeal to a more popular audience, and declared that the arts should communicate religious themes with direct and emotional involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, J. Quentin (1953). [http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.01(1952-55)/MH.1(1953)2/orig05.pdf The Influence of Italian Mannerism Upon Maltese Architecture]. ''Melitensiawath''. Retrieved 8 July 2016. pp. 104–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Helen Gardner, Fred S. Kleiner, and Christin J. Mamiya, ''Gardner's Art Through the Ages'' (Belmont, CA: [[Thomson/Wadsworth]], 2005), p. 516.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lutheran_art#Baroque_period|Lutheran Baroque art]] developed as a confessional marker of identity, in response to the [[Iconoclastic Fury|Great Iconoclasm]] of [[Calvinist]]s.&lt;ref name="2018Heal"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog.oup.com/2018/02/reformation-lutheran-baroque/|title=The Reformation and Lutheran baroque|last=Heal|first=Bridget|date=20 February 2018|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|language=English|accessdate=1 May 2018|quote=However, the writings of theologians can go only so far towards explaining the evolution of confessional consciousness and the shaping of religious identity. Lutheran attachment to religious images was a result not only of Luther’s own cautious endorsement of their use, but also of the particular religious and political context in which his Reformation unfolded. After the reformer’s death in 1546, the image question was fiercely contested once again. But as Calvinism, with its iconoclastic tendencies, spread, Germany’s Lutherans responded by reaffirming their commitment to the proper use of religious images. In 1615, Berlin’s Lutheran citizens even rioted when their Calvinist rulers removed images from the city’s Cathedral.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque churches were designed with a large central space, where the worshippers could be close to the altar, with a dome or cupola high overhead, allowing light to illuminate the church below. The dome was one of the central symbolic features of baroque architecture illustrating the union between the heavens and the earth, The inside of the cupola was lavishly decorated with paintings of angels and saints, and with stucco statuettes of angels, giving the impression to those below of looking up at heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;
Another feature of baroque churches are the ''quadratura''; [[trompe-l'œil]] paintings on the ceiling in stucco frames, either real or painted, crowded with paintings of saints and angels and connected by architectural details with the balustrades and consoles. ''Quadratura'' paintings of [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlantes]] below the cornices appear to be supporting the ceiling of the church.  Unlike the painted ceilings of Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel, which combined different scenes, each with its own perspective,  to be looked at one at a time, the Baroque ceiling paintings were carefully created so the viewer on the floor of the church would see the entire ceiling in correct perspective, as if the figures were real.

The interiors of baroque churches became more and more ornate in the High Baroque,  and focused around the altar, usually placed under the dome.  The most celebrated baroque decorative works of the High Baroque are the [[Chair of Saint Peter]] (1647–53) and the [[St. Peter's Baldachin|Baldachino of St. Peter]] (1623–34), both by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]], in [[St. Peter's Basilica]] in Rome. The Baldequin of St. Peter is an example of the balance of opposites in Baroque art; the gigantic proportions of the piece, with the apparent lightness of the canopy; and the contrast between the solid twisted columns, bronze, gold and marble of the piece with the flowing draperies of the angels on the canopy.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 106-107&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Frauenkirche]] serves as a prominent example of Lutheran Baroque art, which was completed in 1743 after being commissioned by the Lutheran city council of Dresden and was "compared by eighteenth-century observers to St Peter’s in Rome".&lt;ref name="Heal2011"/&gt;

The twisted column in the interior of churches is one of the signature features of the Baroque. It gives both a sense of motion and also a dramatic new way of reflecting light.
The [[cartouche (design)|cartouche]] was another characteristic feature of baroque decoration.  These were large plaques of carved of marble or stone, usually oval and with a rounded surface, which carried images or text in gilded letters, and were placed as interior decoration or above the doorways of buildings, delivering messages to those below. They showed a wide variety of invention, and were found in all types of buildings, from cathedrals and palaces to small chapels.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988), pg. 102&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque architects sometimes used forced perspective to create illusions.  For the [[Palazzo Spada]] in Rome, Borromini used columns of diminishing size, a narrowing floor and a miniature statue in the garden beyond to create the illusion that a passageway was thirty meters long, when it was actually only seven meters long. A statue at the end of the passage appears to be life-size, though it is only sixty centimeters high. Borromini designed the illusion with the assistance of a mathematician.

===Italian Baroque architecture===
[[File:Basilica di San Pietro in Vaticano September 2015-1a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (early 17th century)]]
[[File:Santa Maria della Salute in Venice 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Santa Maria della Salute]], Venice (1631–1687)]]
The first building in Rome to have a Baroque facade was the [[Church of the Gesù]] in 1584; it was plain by later Baroque standards, but marked a break with the traditional Renaissance facades that preceded it. The interior of this church remained very austere until the high Baroque, when it was lavishly ornamented.

In Rome in 1605, [[Paul V]] became the first of series of [[popes]] who commissioned basilicas and church buildings designed to inspire emotion and awe through a proliferation of forms, and a richness of colors and dramatic effects.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 12&lt;/ref&gt; Among the most influential monuments of the Early Baroque were the facade of [[St. Peter's Basilica]] (1606–1619), and the new nave and loggia which connected the facade to Michelangelo's dome in the earlier church. The new design created a dramatic contrast between the soaring dome and the disproportionately wide facade, and the contrast on the facade itself between the Doric columns and the great mass of the portico.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid to late 17th century the style reached its peak, later termed the High Baroque. Many monumental works were commissioned by Popes [[Urban VIII]] and [[Alexander VII]]. The sculptor and architect [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] designed a new quadruple colonnade around St. Peter's Square (1656 to 1667). The three galleries of columns in a giant ellipse balance the oversize dome and give the Church and square a unity and the feeling of a giant theater.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"&gt;Ducher (1988) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major innovator of the Italian High Baroque was [[Francesco Borromini]], whose major work was the Church of [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] or Saint Charles of the Four Fountains (1634–46).  The sense of movement is given not by the decoration, but by the walls themselves, which undulate and by concave and convex elements, including an oval tower and balcony inserted into a concave traverse. The interior was equally revolutionary; the main space of the church was oval, beneath an oval dome.&lt;ref name="Ducher page 104"/&gt;

Painted ceilings, crowded with angels and saints and [[trompe-l'œil]] architectural effects, were an important feature of the Italian High Baroque. Major works included ''The Entry of Saint Ignace into Paradise'' by [[Andrea Pozzo]] (1685–1695) in the [[Sant'Ignazio Church, Rome|Church of Saint Ignatius]] in Rome, and ''The triumph of the name of Jesus'' by [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] in the [[Church of the Gesù]] in Rome (1669–1683), which featured figures spilling out of the picture frame and dramatic oblique lighting and light-dark contrasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 15&lt;/ref&gt;
The style spread quickly from Rome to other regions of Italy:  It appeared in Venice in the church of [[Santa Maria della Salute]] (1631–1687) by [[Baldassare Longhena]], a highly original octagonal form crowned with an enormous cupola.  It appeared also in Turin, notably in the [[Chapel of the Holy Shroud]]  (1668–1694) by [[Guarino Guarini]]. The style also began to be used in palaces;  Guarini designed the [[Palazzo Carignano]] in Turin, while Longhena designed the [[Ca' Rezzonico]] on the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], (1657), finished by [[Giorgio Massari]] with decorated with paintings by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pages 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;  A series of massive earthquakes in [[Sicily]] required the rebuilding of most of the, and several were built in the exuberant late Baroque or Rococo style.

===Spanish Baroque architecture===
{{Main|Spanish Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Basílica de Santiago 02.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The towers of the Cathedral of [[Santiago de Compostela]] by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]] (1680 (center tower) and 1738–50)]]
[[File:Palacio San Telmo facade Seville Spain.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Palace of San Telmo]], [[Seville]] (1682)]]
The Catholic Church in Spain, and particularly the Jesuits, were the driving force of Spanish Baroque architecture.  The first major work in the style was the San Isidro Chapel in [[Madrid]], begun in 1643 by [[Pedro de la Torre]].  It contrasted an extreme richness of ornament on the exterior with simplicity in the interior, divided into multiple spaces and using effects of light to create a sense of mystery.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) page 48-49&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cathedral in [[Santiago de Compostela]] was modernized with a series of Baroque additions beginning at the end of the 17th century, starting with a highly-ornate bell tower (1680), then flanked by two even taller and more ornate towers, called the ''Obradorio'', added between 1738 and 1750 by [[Fernando de Casas Novoa]]. Another landmark of the Spanish Baroque is the chapel tower of the [[Palace of San Telmo]] in [[Seville]] by [[Leonardo de Figueroa]].&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"&gt;Cabanne (1988) pgs. 48–51&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Granada]] had only been liberated from the Moors in the 15th century, and had its own distinct variety of Baroque.  The painter, sculptor and architect [[Alonso Cano]] designed the Baroque interior of [[Granada Cathedral]] between 1652 and his death in 1657.  It features dramatic contrasts of the massive white columns and gold decor.

Some of the most and ornamental and lavishly decorated architecture of the period was designed by the brothers [[Churriguera]], who worked primarily in [[Salamanca]] and Madrid. The [[Church of San Esteban (Salamanca)|Church of San Esteban]] in Salamanca (1693) is one of the most ornate baroque churches anywhere. Their other works include the buildings on the city's main square, the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor of Salamanca]] (1729).&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

Other notable Spanish baroque architects of the late Baroque include [[Pedro de Ribera]], a pupil of Churriguera, who designed the Royal Hospice of San Fernando in Madrid, and [[Narciso Tomé]], who designed the celebrated [[El Transparente]] altarpiece at [[Toledo Cathedral]] (1729–32) which gives the illusion, in certain light, of floating upwards.&lt;ref name="Cabanne pages 48-51"/&gt;

The architects of the Spanish Baroque had an effect far beyond Spain;  their work was highly influential in the churches built in the Spanish colonies in Latin America and the Philippines. The Church built by the Jesuits for a college in [[Tepotzotlán]], with its ornate Baroque facade and tower, is a good example.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pg. 63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Europe and ''Rococo'' (1740s–1770s)===

[[File:Wies altar.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Wiesekirche in Bavaria by [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] (1745–1754)]]
From 1680 to 1750,  many highly ornate cathedrals, abbeys, and pilgrimage churches were built in central Europe, in Bavaria, Austria, and what is now the Czech Republic.  Some were in [[Rococo]] style,  a distinct, more flamboyant and asymmetric style which emerged out of the Baroque, then replaced it in Central Europe in the first half of the 18th century, until it was replaced in turn by classicism.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéristique des Styles'' (2014), page 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

The princes of the multitude of states in that region also chose Baroque or Rococo for their palaces and residences, and often used Italian-trained architects to construct them.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pp. 89–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable architects included Johann Fischer von Erlach, [[Lukas von Hildebrandt]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]] in Bavaria, [[Balthasar Neumann]] in [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Bruhl]], and [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]] in Dresden. In Prussia, [[Frederic II of Prussia]] was inspired the [[Grand Trianon]] of the [[Palace of Versailles]], and used it as the model for his summer residence, [[Sanssouci]], in [[Potsdam]], designed for him by [[Georg Wenzeslaus von Knobelsdorff]] (1745–1747). Another work of baroque palace architecture is the [[Zwinger (Dresden)|Zwinger]] in [[Potsdam]], the former orangerie of the palace of the Dukes of [[Saxony]] in the 18th century.

One of the best examples of a rococo church is the Basilika Vierzehnheiligen, or [[Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers]], a pilgrimage church located near the town of [[Bad Staffelstein]] near Bamberg, in [[Bavaria]], southern Germany. The Basilica was designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]] and was constructed between 1743 and 1772, its plan a series of interlocking circles around a central oval with the altar placed in the exact center of the church. The interior of this church illustrates the summit of Rococo decoration.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pp. 104–105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable example of the style is the Pilgrimage Church of Wies ({{lang-de|Wieskirche}}). It was designed by the brothers [[Johann Baptist Zimmermann|J. B.]] and [[Dominikus Zimmermann]]. It is located in the foothills of the [[Alps]], in the municipality of [[Steingaden]] in the [[Weilheim-Schongau]] district, [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].Construction took place between 1745 and 1754, and the interior was decorated with frescoes and with stuccowork in the tradition of the [[Wessobrunner School]]. It is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site. 

Another notable example is the [[St. Nicholas Church (Malá Strana)]] in Prague (1704–55), built by [[Christoph Dientzenhofer]] and his son [[Kilian Ignaz Dientzenhofer]]. Decoration covers all of walls of interior of the church. The altar is placed in the nave beneath the central dome, and surrounded by chapels,  Light comes down from the dome above and from the surrounding chapels. The altar is entirely surrounded by arches, columns, curved balustrades and pilasters of colored stone, which are richly decorated with statuary, creating a deliberate confusion between the real architecture and the decoration.  The architecture is transformed into a theater of light, color and movement.&lt;ref name="Ducher pages 106-107"/&gt;

===French Baroque or ''Classicism''===
{{main|French Baroque architecture}}
[[File:Château de Balleroy 25.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chateau de Balleroy]] by [[François Mansart]] (1626–1636)]]
[[File:Château de Versailles 04 2016 5737.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Versailles]] (begun by [[Louis Le Vau]] in 1661)]]
France largely resisted the ornate baroque style of Italy, Spain, Vienna and the rest of Europe. The French Baroque style (often termed ''Grand Classicism'' or simply ''Classicism''  in France) is closely associated with the works built for [[Louis XIV]] and [[Louis XV]]; it features more geometric order and measure than baroque, and less elaborate decoration on the facades and in the interiors.  Louis XIV invited the master of baroque, Bernini, to submit a design for the new wing of the Louvre, but rejected it in favor of a more classical design by [[Claude Perrault]] and [[Louis Le Vau]].&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pages 25–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal architects of the style included [[François Mansart]] ([[Chateau de Balleroy]], 1626–1636), [[Pierre Le Muet]] (Church of [[Val-de-Grace]], 1645–1665), [[Louis Le Vau]] ([[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], 1657–1661) and especially [[Jules Hardouin Mansart]] and [[Robert de Cotte]], whose work included the [[Galerie des Glaces]] and the [[Grand Trianon]] at Versailles (1687–1688). Mansart was also responsible for the Baroque-classicism of the [[Place Vendôme]] (1686–1699).&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 25–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major work of the period was the [[Palace of Versailles]], begun in 1661 by Le Vau with decoration by the painter [[Charles Le Brun]]. The gardens were designed by [[André Le Nôtre]] specifically to complement and amplify the architecture. The Galerie des Glaces (Hall of Mirrors), the centerpiece of the château, with paintings by Le Brun, was constructed between 1678 and 1686. Mansart completed the Grand Trianon in 1687. The chapel, designed by de Cotte, was finished in 1710. Following the death of Louis XIV, Louis XV added the more intimate [[Petit Trianon]] and the highly ornate theater. The fountains in the gardens were designed to be seen from the interior, and to add to the dramatic effect. The palace was admired and copied by other monarchs of Europe, particularly [[Peter the Great]] of Russia, who visited Versailles early in the reign of Louis XV, and built his own version at [[Peterhof Palace]] near Saint Petersburg, between 1705 and 1725.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988), pgs. 28–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Baroque===

[[File:The Great Church of the Winter Palace in Saint Petersburg, iconostasis.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The Great Church of the [[Winter Palace]] in St. Petersburg, by Rastrelli (1753–1759)]]
The debut of Russian Baroque, or [[Petrine Baroque]], followed a long visit of [[Peter the Great]] to western Europe in 1697–98,  where he visited the Chateaux of Fontainebleu and Versailles and other architectural monuments.  He decided, on his return to Russia, to construct similar monuments in St. Petersburg, when he moved the Russian capital there in 1712. Early major monuments in the Petrine baroque include the [[Peter and Paul Cathedral]] and [[Menshikov Palace]].
During the reign of [[Empress Anna]] and [[Elizaveta Petrovna]], Russian architecture was dominated by the luxurious baroque style of [[Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli|Bartolomeo Rastrelli]]; called [[Elizabethan Baroque]]. Rastrelli's signature buildings include the [[Winter Palace]], the [[Catherine Palace]] and the [[Smolny Cathedral]]. Other distinctive monuments of the Elizabethan Baroque are the bell tower of the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]] and the [[Red Gate]].&lt;ref&gt;* William Craft Brumfield.

==Painting==
{{Main|Baroque painting}}
[[File:Peter Paul Rubens - De kruisoprichting.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''The Raising of the Cross'' by [[Peter Paul Rubens]] (1610–1611)]]

[[File:Fresco with Trompe l'oeuil - Andrea Pozzo -Jesuit Church Vienna.jpg|thumb|right|150px|''Quadratura''; a painted dome by [[Andrea Pozzo]] for the [[Jesuit Church, Vienna]], giving the illusion of looking upwards at heavenly figures around a nonexistent dome (1703)]]
Baroque painters worked deliberately to set themselves apart from the painters of the Renaissance and the Mannerism period after it.  In their palette, they used intense and warm colors, and particularly made use of the [[primary colors]] red, blue and yellow, frequently putting all three in close proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 11&lt;/ref&gt;   In their lighting, they avoided the even lighting of Renaissance painting and used strong contrasts of light and darkness on certain parts of the picture to direct attention to the central actions or figures.  In their composition, they avoided the tranquil scenes of Renaissance paintings, and chose the moments of the greatest movement and drama.  Unlike the tranquil faces of Renaissance paintings, the faces in Baroque paintings clearly expressed their emotions.  They often used asymmetry, with action occurring away from the center of the picture, and created axes that were neither vertical or horizontal, but slanting to the left or right, giving a sense of instability and movement.  They enhanced this impression of movement by having the costumes of the personages blown by the wind, or moved by their own gestures. The overall impressions were movement, emotion and drama.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pgs. 3–15&lt;/ref&gt;  Another essential element of baroque painting was allegory; every painting told a story and had a message, often encrypted in symbols and allegorical characters, which an educated viewer was expected to know and read.&lt;ref&gt;Prater and Bauer,  ''La Peinture du baroque'' (1997), pg. 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:The Toilet of Venus, by François Boucher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Toilet of Venus'' by [[François Boucher]] (1755)]]
The earliest Baroque painters were the Italians the Caracci brothers, [[Annibale Caracci| Annibale]] and [[Agostino Caracci|Agostino]], in the last score of the 16th century, and [[Caravaggio]] in the last decade of the century. Caravaggio's realistic approach to the human figure, painted directly from life and dramatically spotlit against a dark background, shocked his contemporaries and opened a new chapter in the history of painting.    Other major painters associated closely with the Baroque style include [[Guido Reni]], [[Domenichino]], [[Andrea Pozzo]], and [[Paolo de Matteis]] in Italy; [[Francisco de Zurbarán]] in Spain; [[Adam Elsheimer]] in Germany; and [[Nicolas Poussin]] and [[Georges de La Tour]] in France (though Poussin spent most of his working life in Italy).  Poussin and La Tour adopted a "classical" Baroque style with less focus on emotion and greater attention to the line of the figures in the painting than colour.  

[[Peter Paul Rubens]] was the most important painter of the [[Flemish Baroque painting|Flemish Baroque]] style.  Rubens' highly charged compositions reference erudite aspects of classical and Christian history. His unique and immensely popular Baroque style emphasized movement, color, and sensuality, which followed the immediate, dramatic artistic style promoted in the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Rubens specialized in making altarpieces, portraits, landscapes, and [[history painting]]s of mythological and allegorical subjects.

One important domain of Baroque painting was ''Quadratura'', or paintings in ''[[trompe-l'oeil]]'', which literally "fooled the eye".  These were usually painted on the stucco of ceilings or upper walls and balustrades, and gave the impression to those on the ground looking up were that they were seeing the heavens populated with crowds of angels saints, and other heavenly figures, set against painted skies and imaginary architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Ducher, Robert, ''La Caractéistique des Styles'' (2014), pg. 92 &lt;/ref&gt;  

In Italy, artists often collaborated with architects on interior decoration; [[Pietro da Cortona]] was one of the painters of the 17th century who employed this illusionist way of painting. Among his most important commissions were the frescoes he painted for the [[Palazzo Barberini|Palace of the Barberini family]] (1633–39), to glorify the reign of [[Pope Urban VIII]].  Pietro da Cortona’s compositions were the largest decorative frescoes executed in Rome since the work of Michelangelo at the [[Sistine Chapel]]. .&lt;ref&gt;Ducher (1988) pages 108–109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[François Boucher]] was an important figure in the more delicate French Rococo style, which appeared during the late Baroque period.  He designed tapestries, carpets and theater decoration as well as painting.  His work was extremely popular with [[Madame Pompadour]], the Mistress of King [[Louis XV]]. His paintings featured mythological romantic, and mildly erotic themes.&lt;ref&gt;Cabanne (1988) pp. 102–104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
{{Main|Baroque sculpture}}
[[File:Teresabernini.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|''Ecstasy of St. Teresa'', by [[Bernini]] (1647–1652)]]
[[File:LouisXIV-Bernini.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Bust of [[Louis XIV]] by Bernini, Versailles (1665)]]
The dominant figure in baroque sculpture was [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].  Under the patronage of [[Pope Urban VIII]], he made a remarkable series of monumental statues of saints and figures whose faces and gestures vividly expressed their emotions, as well as portrait busts of exceptional realism, and highly decorative works for the Vatican, including the imposing [[Chair of St. Peter]] beneath the dome in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]  In addition, he designed fountains with monumental groups of sculpture to decorate the major squares of Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'' (1999), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

Baroque sculpture was particularly inspired by ancient Roman statuary, particularly by the famous statue of [[Laocoön]] from the First Century A.D., which was on display in the gallery of the Vatican.  When he visited Paris in 1665, Bernini addressed the students at the Academy of painting and sculpture, he advised the students to work from classical models, rather than from nature.  He told the students, "When I had trouble with my first statue, i consulted the ''Antinous'' like an oracle."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1999) page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable late French baroque sculptors included [[Étienne Maurice Falconet]] and [[Jean Baptiste Pigalle]].  Pigalle was commissioned by [[Frederick the Great]] to make statues for Frederick's own version of Versailles at [[Sanssouci]] in [[Potsdam]], Germany. Falconet also received an important foreign commission, creating the famous statue of [[Peter the Great]] on horseback found in St. Petersburg.

In Spain, the sculptor [[Francisco Salzillo]] worked exclusively on religious themes, using polychromed wood. Some of the finest baroque sculptural craftsmanship was found in the gilded stucco altars of churches of the Spanish colonies of the New World, made by local craftsmen; examples include the Rosary Chapel of the Church of Santo Domingo in Oaxaca, Mexico (1724–31).

==Music and ballet==
{{Main article|Baroque music|Baroque dance}}

[[File:Vivaldi.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|[[Antonio Vivaldi]], (1678–1741)]]
The term ''Baroque'' is also used to designate the style of music composed during a period that overlaps with that of Baroque art. The first uses of the term 'baroque' for music were criticisms.  In an anonymous, satirical review of the première in October 1733 of Rameau's ''[[Hippolyte et Aricie]],'' printed in the ''Mercure de France'' in May 1734, the critic implied that the novelty in this opera was "du barocque," complaining that the music lacked coherent melody, was filled with unremitting dissonances, constantly changed key and meter, and speedily ran through every compositional device.{{sfn|Palisca|2001}} [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], who was a musician and noted composer as well as philosopher, made a very similar observation in 1768 in the famous ''Encylopedié'' of [[Denis Diderot]]:   "Baroque music is that in which the harmony is confused, and loaded with modulations and dissonances. The singing is harsh and unnatural, the intonation difficult, and the movement limited. It appears that term comes from the word 'baroco' used by logicians."&lt;ref name="Encyclopedie"/&gt;

Common use of the term for the music of the period began only in 1919, by [[Curt Sachs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sachs |first1=Curt |authorlink1=Curt Sachs |title=Barockmusik |trans-title=Baroque Music |series=Jahrbuch der Musikbibliothek Peters |volume=26 |year=1919 |publisher=Edition Peters |location=Leipzig |language=German|pages=7–15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until 1940 that it was first used in English in an article published by [[Manfred Bukofzer]].{{sfn|Palisca|2001}}

The baroque was a period of musical experimentation and innovation. New forms were invented, including the [[concerto]] and [[sinfonia]]. [[Opera]] was born in Italy at the end of the 16th century (with [[Jacopo Peri]]'s mostly lost ''[[Dafne]]'', produced in [[Florence]] in 1598) and soon spread through the rest of Europe:   Louis XIV created the first Royal Academy of Music,  In 1669, the poet [[Pierre Perrin]] opened an academy of opera in Paris, the first opera theater in France open to the public, and premiered ''[[Pomone (opera)|Pomone]]'', the first grand opera in French, with music by [[Robert Cambert]], with five acts, elaborate stage machinery, and a ballet.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"&gt;Bély, Lucien, ''Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde'' (2005), pp. 152–54&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Schütz]] in Germany, [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]] in France, and [[Henry Purcell]] in England all helped to establish their national traditions in the 17th century.

The classical ballet also originated in the Baroque era. The style of court dance was brought to France by [[Marie de Medici]], and in the beginning the members of the court themselves were the dancers. [[Louis XIV]] himself performed in public in several ballets. In March 1662, the [[Académie Royale de Danse]], was founded by the King.  It was the first professional dance school and company,  and set the standards and vocabulary for ballet throughout Europe during the period.&lt;ref name="Louis XIV- Le Plus Grand Roi du Monde"/&gt;

Several new instruments, including the [[piano]], were introduced during this period. The invention of the piano is credited to [[Bartolomeo Cristofori]] (1655–1731) of [[Padua]], Italy, who was employed by [[Ferdinando de' Medici, Grand Prince of Tuscany]], as the Keeper of the Instruments. .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erlich|first=Cyril|title=The Piano: A History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], USA; Revised edition|year=1990|isbn=0-19-816171-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="metmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/cris/hd_cris.htm |title=The Piano: The Pianofortes of Bartolomeo Cristofori (1655–1731) &amp;#124; Thematic Essay &amp;#124; Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History &amp;#124; The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2003 | author=Powers, Wendy |accessdate=2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cristofori named the instrument ''un cimbalo di cipresso di piano e forte'' ("a keyboard of [[cypress]] with soft and loud"), abbreviated over time as ''pianoforte'', ''fortepiano'', and later, simply, piano.&lt;ref&gt;Isacoff (2012, 23)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatre==
[[File:Set design Act5 of Andromède by P Corneille 1650 - Gallica.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Set design for ''Andromedé'' by [[Pierre Corneille]], (1650)]]

The Baroque period was a golden age for theater in France and Spain;  playwrights included [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]], [[Jean Racine|Racine]] and [[Moliere]] in France; and [[Lope de Vega]] and [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] Spain.

During the Baroque period, the art and style of the theater evolved rapidly, alongside the development of opera and of ballet.  The design of newer and larger theaters, the invention the use of more elaborate machinery, the wider use of the [[proscenium arch]], which framed the stage and hid the machinery from the audience, encouraged more scenic effects and spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;Britannica on-line, ''Baroque Theater''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baroque had a Catholic and conservative character in Spain, following an Italian literary models during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt; The Hispanic Baroque theatre aimed for a public content with an ideal reality that manifested fundamental three sentiments: Catholic religion, monarchist and national pride and honour originating from the chivalric, knightly world.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco, Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two periods are known in the Baroque Spanish theatre, with the division occurring in 1630. The first period is represented chiefly by [[Lope de Vega]], but also by [[Tirso de Molina]], [[Gaspar Aguilar]], [[Guillén de Castro]], [[Antonio Mira de Amescua]], [[Luis Vélez de Guevara]], [[Juan Ruiz de Alarcón]], [[Diego Jiménez de Enciso]], [[Luis Belmonte Bermúdez]], [[Felipe Godínez]], [[Luis Quiñones de Benavente]] or [[Juan Pérez de Montalbán]]. The second period is represented by [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]] and fellow dramatists [[Antonio Hurtado de Mendoza]], [[Álvaro Cubillo de Aragón]], [[Jerónimo de Cáncer]], [[Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla]], [[Juan de Matos Fragoso]], [[Antonio Coello y Ochoa]], [[Agustín Moreto]], and [[Francisco Bances Candamo]].&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; These classifications are loose because each author had his own way and could occasionally adhere himself to the formula established by Lope. It may even be that the "manner" of Lope was more liberal and structured than Calderón's.&lt;ref&gt;González Mas, Ezequiel (1980). ''Historia de la literatura española: (Siglo XVII). Barroco'', Volumen 3. La Editorial, UPR, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Lope de Vega introduced through his ''Arte nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo'' (1609) the ''new comedy''. He established a new dramatic formula that broke the three [[Aristotle]] unities of the Italian school of poetry (action, time and place) and a fourth unity of Aristotle which is about style, mixing of tragic and comic elements showing different types of verses and stanzas upon what is represented.&lt;ref&gt;Lope de Vega, 2010, Comedias: El Remedio en la Desdicha. El Mejor Alcalde El Rey, pp.&amp;nbsp;446–447&lt;/ref&gt; Although Lope has a great knowledge of the plastic arts, he did not use it during the major part of his career nor in theatre or scenography. The Lope's comedy granted a second role to the visual aspects of the theatrical representation.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Tirso de Molina, Lope de Vega, and Calderón were the most important play writers in Golden Era Spain. Their works, known for their subtle intelligence and profound comprehension of a person's humanity, could be considered a bridge between Lope's primitive comedy and the more elaborate comedy of Calderón. Tirso de Molina is best known for two works, ''The Convicted Suspicions'' and ''[[The Trickster of Seville]]'', one of the first versions of the [[Don Juan]] myth.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Edward M.; Moir, Duncan (1992). ''Historia de la literatura española: Siglo De Oro: Teatro'' (1492–1700). Editorial Ariel, pp.&amp;nbsp;155–158&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his arrival to Madrid, [[Cosimo Lotti]] brought to the Spanish court the most advanced theatrical techniques of Europe. His techniques and mechanic knowledge were applied in palace exhibitions called "Fiestas" and in lavish exhibitions of rivers or artificial fountains called "Naumaquias". He was in charge of styling the Gardens of [[Buen Retiro]], of [[Palace of Zarzuela|Zarzuela]] and of [[Royal Palace of Aranjuez|Aranjuez]] and the construction of the theatrical building of Coliseo del Buen Retiro.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Lope's formulas begins with a verse that it unbefitting of the palace theatre foundation and the birth of new concepts that begun the careers of some play writers like Calderón de la Barca. Marking the principal innovations of the New Lopesian Comedy, Calderón's style marked many differences, with a great deal of constructive care and attention to his internal structure. Calderón's work is in formal perfection and a very lyric and symbolic language. Liberty, vitality and openness of Lope gave a step to Calderón's intellectual reflection and formal precision. In his comedy it reflected his ideological and doctrine intentions in above the passion and the action, the work of [[Autos sacramentales]] achieved high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Molina Jiménez,  María Belén (2008). El teatro musical de Calderón de la Barca: Análisis textual. EDITUM, p. 56
&lt;/ref&gt; The genre of Comedia is political, multi-artistic and in a sense hybrid. The poetic text interweaved with Medias and resources originating from architecture, music and painting freeing the deception that is in the Lopesian comedy was made up from the lack of scenery and engaging the dialogue of action.&lt;ref&gt;Amadei-Pulice, 1990, María Alicia (1990). Calderón y el barroco: exaltación y engaño de los sentidos. John Benjamins Publishing Company, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The best known German playwright was [[Andreas Gryphius]], who used the [[Jesuit]] model of the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[Joost van den Vondel]] and [[Pierre Corneille]]. There was also [[Johannes Velten]] who combined the traditions of the English comedians and the [[commedia del'arte]]  with the classic theatre of Corneille and [[Molière]]. His touring company was perhaps the most significant and important of the 17th century.

==End of the style, condemnation and academic rediscovery==
Madame de Pompadour, the mistress of Louis XV, probably without intending it, contributed to the decline of the baroque and rococo style.  In 1750 she sent her nephew, [[Abel-François Poisson|Abel-François Poisson de Vandières]], on a two-year mission to study artistic and archeological developments in Italy.  He was accompanied by several artists, including the engraver [[Nicolas Cochin]] and the architect [[Soufflot]].  They returned to Paris with a passion for classical art. Vandiéres became the Marquis of Marigny, and was named Royal Director of buildings in 1754. He turned official French architecture toward the neoclassical. Cochin became an important art critic;  he denounced the ''petit style'' of Boucher, and called for a grand style with a new emphasis on antiquity and nobility in the academies of painting of architecture. {{sfn|Cabanne|1988|pg. 106}} 

The pioneer German art historian and archeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] also condemned the baroque style, and praised the superior values of classical art and architecture.  By the 19th century, Baroque was a target for ridicule and criticism.  The neoclassical critic Francesco Milizia wrote: "Borrominini in architecture, Bernini in sculpture, Pierre de Cortone in painting...are a plague on good taste, which infected a large number of artists."&lt;ref&gt;Boucher, Bruce, ''La Sculpture baroque italienne'', Thames and Hudson, (1997), page 9&lt;/ref&gt;    In the 19th century, criticism went even further; the British critic [[John Ruskin]] declared that baroque sculpture was not only bad, but also morally corrupt.&lt;ref&gt;Boucher (1998) page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Swiss-born art historian Heinrich Wölfflin (1864–1945) started the rehabilitation of the word Baroque in his Renaissance und Barock (1888); Wölfflin identified the Baroque as "movement imported into mass", an art antithetic to Renaissance art. He did not make the distinctions between Mannerism and Baroque that modern writers do, and he ignored the later phase, the academic Baroque that lasted into the 18th century. Baroque art and architecture became fashionable between the two World Wars, and has largely remained in critical favor.  The term "Baroque" may still be used, usually pejoratively, describing works of art, craft, or design that are thought to have excessive ornamentation or complexity of line.

'''Big Writing''' is an approach to [[teaching]] writing developed by Ros Wilson and marketed by Andrell Education. The aim of Big Writing is to advise schools on how to raise attainment level in speaking, listening and writing. The method is currently used by numerous [[schools]], primarily in the UK but also overseas. The target audience for Big writing are [[Key Stage 1]] and [[Key Stage 2]] students (i.e. those aged 5 to 11), although a slightly adjusted method is also taught that focuses on Foundation stage pupils and is known as 'Big Talk'. Andrell Education claims that Big Writing has proven to be successful in a number of schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eastardsley.leeds.sch.uk/homedir/BigWriting.htm |title=Big Writing at East Ardsley Primary School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107102702/http://www.eastardsley.leeds.sch.uk/homedir/BigWriting.htm |archivedate=2010-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; both with [[teachers]] and [[Students|pupils]], and points to [[case studies]] as evidence of this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancsngfl.ac.uk/projects/gp_award/getfile.php?src=163/Lomeshaye.J.007.018.pdf|title=Lomeshaye Junior School Case Study|accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Raising Standards in Writing"&gt;{{Cite book

==Description==

The first part of the Big Writing course to be developed was the Criterion Scale, an assessment tool linked to [[National Curriculum]] levels. From October 1999, Wilson spent three years working with the [[Local education authority|Kirklees LEA]] re-assessing work other teachers had already graded. During this time she read through and marked around 20,000 pieces of [[writing]] and observed that some teachers struggled to properly [[Educational assessment|assess]] work, and had too high of an opinion of their pupils' writing. She also noticed the students who were underachieving, particularly the ones that teachers had given too high a grade, all had similar weaknesses in their writing. Ros Wilson decided to develop a standard that teachers could use to assess pupils' writing more accurately, and in a way that Wilson claims is more scientific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kenttrustweb.org.uk/kentict/kentict_sub_lit_levels.cfm |title=Writing Levels from 'Kent ICT' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111027191208/http://www.kenttrustweb.org.uk/kentict/kentict_sub_lit_levels.cfm |archivedate=2011-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cumbriagridforlearning.org.uk/index.php?category_id=835 |title=Writing Levels at Cumbria Grid for Learning |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306060536/http://www.cumbriagridforlearning.org.uk/index.php?category_id=835 |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this, Wilson believes teachers can more accurately assess a student's work, and provide better targeted teaching and more helpful feedback.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to address the weaknesses in children's writing that she noted as being common across schools, Wilson identified four features that she believes are key to improving writing in the primary age range: [[vocabulary]], [[Discourse marker|connectives]], openers and [[punctuation]], or V.C.O.P.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/ealing/schools/westacton/web/communities/Y3/resources/Y3/VCOP/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20110923170141/http://www.lgfl.net/lgfl/leas/ealing/schools/westacton/web/communities/Y3/resources/Y3/VCOP/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-09-23|title=V.C.O.P. at Early grid for Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=3014216|title=V.C.O.P.

&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the Criterion Scale, V.C.O.P. became a core part of the Big Writing approach, which Wilson and Andrell Education have promoted through books and professional development courses.

Big Writing also emphasises talk for writing, and that pupils need to be taught to speak [[Standard English]] in order to help them make fewer spelling and grammar mistakes in their writing.

Andrell advises that classes have regular Big Write sessions (ideally  lasting one and a half hours, in order to allow children time to write at length), perhaps once a week, as well as regular short exercises throughout the school week in which children develop writing and editing skills with a focus on V.C.O.P.

Ros Wilson also advocates creating a positive environment for a writing through the use of candles, music and whatever else a teacher feels is beneficial in creating the right mood for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.chadvale.bham.sch.uk/big_writing.htm |title=Big Writing at Chadvale School |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504041022/http://web.chadvale.bham.sch.uk/big_writing.htm |archivedate=2010-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blessing of animals''' can be either of the animal or of the human-animal relationship, and can apply to [[pet]]s and other [[companion animals]], or to [[agricultural animal]]s and [[working animal|working]] and other animals which humans depend on or interact with.

Blessing of animals, or of the slaughtering process, before [[animal slaughter|slaughter]], is a key element of some [[religion]]s.

Ceremonial blessing of companion animals occurs throughout the world,&lt;ref name="dtwc"/&gt; for example, Australia,&lt;ref name="mtgrav"/&gt; Canada,&lt;ref name="horace"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20070917/281599531121068 |title=Canon Baugh's pet blessings live on |publisher=pressreader - NewspaperDirect Inc. |work=Montreal Gazette |access-date=18 November 2017 |first=Irwin |last=Block |date=17 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scotland,&lt;ref name="scotland"&gt;

[[Blessing]] of animals is a [[religion|religious]] activity, and occurs broadly across most religions in some form, including, for example, across [[Christianity]],&lt;ref name="humane"/&gt; [[Islam]], [[Judaism]],&lt;ref name="tablet"/&gt; [[Shintoism]],&lt;ref name="shinto"/&gt; [[Unitarian Universalism]],&lt;ref name="unit"&gt;

[[Secular]] respect for animals is also strong, for example, [[World Animal Day]], an international day of action for animal rights and welfare celebrated annually, but is still held on 4 October, the feast day of [[Francis of Assisi]], a Christian [[patron saint]] of animals.&lt;ref&gt;

==Judaism==
Many synagogues now have ceremonies for the blessing of animals, and some say the idea may have originated in ancient Judaism. The Jewish ceremony is often performed on the seventh day of Passover (in the spring) as a celebration of the Hebrews’ (and their animals’) emancipation from slavery in Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Many Jewish congregations schedule blessings of the animals after the High Holy Days, with ceremonies around the second weekly Torah portion of the Jewish Year, the Parashat Noach, the portion about Noah and the ark, the saving of both humans and other animals, they also being gifts from God.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Jewish ceremonies are derived from the Christian ceremony and are not derived from traditional Judaism, which gives some concern for more traditional followers of Judaism.&lt;ref name="tablet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/148298/the-rabbi-who-blesses-jewish-pets |title=THE RABBI WHO BLESSES JEWISH PETS |publisher=Nextbook Inc. |work=Tablet Magazine |access-date=19 November 2017 |first=Rebecca |last=Meiser |date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coming of age===
A [[Bark Mitzvah]] is an observance and celebration of a dog's [[coming of age]],&lt;ref name="BarkMitzvahNYT"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/nyregion/20mitzvah.html |title= Today He Is a Dog; Actually He Always Was |author= Lily Koppel |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= 20 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CohenGindlinBook"&gt;Shari Cohen and Marcelo Gindlin.

The term has been in use since at least 1958.

===Ritual slaughter===
Islamic [[dhabiha]] requires that God's name be pronounced before each slaughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shariahprogram.ca/eat-halal-foods/islamic-guidelines-slaughtering-animals.shtml |title=Islamic Guidelines Slaughtering Animals |publisher=Shariahprogram.ca |date= |accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culturalisation==
[[File:Bendicion de Carros (8).JPG|thumb|200px|Blessing of cars, horses, and vehicles in front of the church of [[San Pedro de Santa Bárbara]] de Heredia, Costa Rica]]
Some towns and cities have the blessing of animals as a cultural event, for example:
* [[San Juan del Río]], on January 17, [[feast day]] of San Antonio.
* [[Unterammergau]], the site of the 11th-century Chapel of St Leonhard, patron saint of horses, which is the terminus of the annual Leonhardritt and Blessing of the Animals.
* [[Olvera Street#Blessing of the Animals|Blessing of the Animals]] at Olvera Street, an event from 1930, is held every Sabado de Gloria ([[Holy Saturday]]). It is an all-day event with vendors, performers, and a procession where participants bring their animals to be blessed by religious authorities and others.&lt;ref&gt;Rondeau, Ginette [http://www.olvera-street.com/Calendar/calendar.html ''Calendar''] ''Olvera Street Website'' Accessed 15 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Madrid]], where the festival has been celebrated largely uninterrupted since the 19th century. It is also held in other parts of Spain, such as the [[Balearic Islands]] in the Mediterranean and the northern city of [[Burgos]].&lt;ref name="spain"/&gt;
* During the latter part of the 20th century, the blessing of animals and pets in the [[United States]] has become mainstream cultural activity, with services occurring in 48 states and districts in 2008.&lt;ref name="humane"/&gt;

==Culturally significant animals==
Rare animal instances can have great significance in belief systems and may be ritually blessed as part of that tradition, for example the white buffalo, [[Kenahkihinén]], in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Historical animal blessing and prayer==

The [[Lorsch Bee Blessing|Lorscher Bienensegen]], believed to date back to the 9th century, is a Christian [[apiary|bee-keeping]] prayer written in [[Old High German]] to bring [[Western honey bee|honey bee]]s back to their hives in good health, and may arise from earlier [[Anglo-Saxon]] and apparently pagan "[[For a Swarm of Bees]]" in pre-Christian Germanic areas.&lt;ref name=GRENDON209&gt;[https://archive.org/details/anglosaxoncharms00gren Grendon (1909:209)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=HGDxCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;lpg=PA89&amp;dq=grendon+1909&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5KaM4xJBUy&amp;sig=6qe1jVCP1jnDzh2Rqr38deIgkRQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwixhoTOycfXAhXDnJQKHTNZA-4Q6AEIPDAE#v=onepage&amp;q=grendon%201909&amp;f=false |title=21st Century Homestead: Beekeeping |publisher=Lulu.com |access-date=18 November 2017 |first=Brant |last=Reuber |date=2015 |isbn=9781312937338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saint Dwynwen]] is more known for being a [[Wales|Welsh]] patron saint of lovers but she is also lesser known as being the patron saint of sick animals which she would bless. 

Legend has it that in the 4th century, whole herds of wild animals would come for the blessing of [[Saint Blaise]].&lt;ref&gt;Vollet, E. H., ''[[Grande Encyclopédie]]'' ''s.v.'' Blaise (Saint); published in ''Bibliotheca Hagiographica Graeca'' "Auctarium", 1969, 278, col. 665b.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal chaplaincy==
{{main|Chaplain#Animal{{!}}Chaplain}}
Animal chaplaincy is typically associated with veterinary work. Veterinary chaplains minister in regard to the spirituality associated with animals and the human-animal bond and responsibilities, and perform animal blessings as part of a broad range of services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahwatukee.com/news/article_b608ca1a-aba4-11e2-a089-001a4bcf887a.html |title=Animal chaplains teach that animals have spiritual nature |work=Ahwatukee Foothills News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of animals blessed==

Any animal can be blessed and a wide variety have been blessed during blessing ceremonies. It depends on what people bring on the day. Included have been:

* Working animals, for example military or police dogs.

==Practical issues==
The safety of animals and people is important. Due consideration also needs to be given to any mess some animals may make.&lt;ref name="calgary"/&gt;

==Counterpoint==
[[PETA]] have an alternative view on animal blessing events, and proffer the following points:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web
|url=https://www.peta.org/features/saint-francis-assisi-day/

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cats are terrified and should be left at home. The blessing is for the animals so do not sacrifice the animals' welfare for the ceremony.
* Many animals, all created by God, miss out on the blessing, and are mutilated and abused for our sake. PETA states St. Francis would be appalled by the degree of suffering that we inflict on animals to indulge our acquired taste for their flesh.
* PETA suggest two [[Franciscan]] Animal Blessings.

The Big Draw, formerly the '''Campaign for Drawing,''' is a UK registered charity that promotes [[drawing]] and visual literacy. It was founded in 2000 by the [[Guild of St George]], and is now an independent charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100917/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/history.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Big Draw believes that drawing is a universal language that can unite people across generations, backgrounds and borders. It is inspired by the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] artist and writer, [[John Ruskin]], whose mission was not to teach people how to draw, but how to see. An arts [[educational]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], the Campaign demonstrates that drawing is a [[life skill]]: an essential tool for learning, expression and invention. Its [[publications]] for [[teacher]]s and other educators provide comprehensive evidence that drawing supports formal and informal [[learning]].&lt;ref name="campaign"&gt;[http://www.campaignfordrawing.org]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511163743/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/|date=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/ |title=The Campaign for Drawing - Press releases |publisher=NESTA |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213131726/http://www.nesta.org.uk/the-campaign-for-drawing/# |archive-date=2012-02-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Broadcasting Corporation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/secretofdrawing/ |title=Arts - The Secret of Drawing |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2013-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013133744/http://www.raeng.org.uk/education/stf/pdf/the_big_draw_2007.pdf |date=October 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503153730/http://staffcentral.brighton.ac.uk/clt/projects/bigdraw/bigdraw.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charity leads a programme of advocacy, empowerment and engagement, and is the driving force behind The Big Draw Festival – the world’s biggest celebration of drawing.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

The charity supports established and emerging artists through The John Ruskin Prize and exhibition, and regular events, awards and competitions.

The Big Draw manages collaborative research projects, campaigns and educational conferences on visual literacy, digital technology and STEAM (Science, Technology, Art, Maths, Science).

==The Big Draw Festival==
The Big Draw charity is the founder and driving force behind The Big Draw Festival, which takes place each year in over 20 countries around the world. 

Events often take place at notable venues throughout the UK including [[The British Museum]], [[The National Gallery]] and [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] as well as schools, community centres, parks and village halls. The 2013 Big Draw highlight event offered visitors 20 different activities in the new Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. Previous launches were held at the Natural History Museum, V&amp;A (twice), Trafalgar Square, St Pancras International Station, Welcome Collection and the British Library.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Partnerships==
The Big Draw receives no core funding. Previously, it has been sponsored by bodies as diverse as NESTA, [[Arts Council England]] (ACE), [[Crayola]], [[Daler-Rowney]], Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, Paul Hamlyn Foundation, Barbara Whatmore Charitable Trust, [[Financial Times]], Heritage Lottery Fund, [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|National Lottery]], [[Persil]], [[Puffin]], [[Royal Academy of Engineering]] and [[Royal Institute of British Architects]] (RIBA), Derwent and Cass Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx |title=The Campaign For Drawing |publisher=Campaignfordrawing.org |date= |accessdate=2015-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402145232/http://www.campaignfordrawing.org/about/funding.aspx# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caucasian Dhol''' ({{Lang-hy|Դհոլ}}, {{Lang-az|Nağara}}, {{Lang-ce|Фуотт}}, {{Lang-ka|დოლი}}, {{Lang-ru|Доули}}) is a kind of [[dhol]] drums in the [[Caucasus]]. This drum was used by the Caucasian warriors in the battle, today for national music playing.

== Construction ==
[[File:Caucasian Drum.jpg|thumb|Caucasian Dhol drum|177x177px]]
Сaucasian dhol is a double-sided barrel drum, the shell used from wood or acrylic plastic, and the heads from thinnest leather or synthetic plastic film. The traditional preferences is shell from walnut wood and the heads from goat skin. The skin or plastic film should be spanned on strong iron round rod, strong during the tuning up of the drum heads the rod should not be bent, the round rod is optimal for touch hands. Adjustment made by hemp or synthetic rope.

== Playing ==
Сaucasian dhol played mostly as an accompanying instrument with [[Garmon]], [[Zurna]] and [[Clarinet]]. There are two playing variants, one with hands and the second with two wooden sticks, usually the sticks made out of [[Cornus|dogwood]] because this is heavy wood.
[[File:Caucasian drum - wooden sticks playing.png|thumb|Caucasian drum - wooden sticks playing]]

== Regional forms and traditions ==

=== Armenia and Azerbaijan ===
In [[Armenia]] it is called '''Dhol''', in [[Azerbaijan]] called '''[[Naqara]]''', their dhols used from natural thinnest leather skin or plastic film heads and the shell is wooden or acrylic plastic. The playing is only with hands.

=== Chechnya and Ingushetia ===
In [[Chechnya]] and [[Ingushetia]] it's called '''Fuott''' or '''Wuott''', and as many traditional drums, was made from cylindrical wooden shell and acoustic membrane from natural leather skin, traditionally played with the bare hands.

=== Georgia and Abkhazia ===
In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Abkhazia]] it is called '''Dholi''' or '''Doli''', their dhols almost used from natural thick leather skin heads and wooden shell. The playing is almost with hands.

=== Southern Russia ===
In [[Southern Russia]] it is called '''Douli''', their dhols is the same as the Armenian and Azerbaijani.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5055">In [[statistics]], a '''central composite design''' is an experimental design, useful in [[response surface methodology]], for building a second order (quadratic) model for the [[response variable]] without needing to use a complete three-level [[factorial experiment]].

After the designed experiment is performed, [[linear regression]] is used, sometimes iteratively, to obtain results. Coded variables are often used when constructing this design.

==Implementation==

The design consists of three distinct sets of experimental runs:

# A [[factorial design|factorial]] (perhaps [[Fractional factorial design|fractional]]) design in the factors studied, each having two levels;
# A set of ''center points'', experimental runs whose values of each factor are the medians of the values used in the factorial portion. This point is often replicated in order to improve the precision of the experiment;
# A set of ''axial points'', experimental runs identical to the centre points except for one factor, which will take on values both below and above the median of the two factorial levels, and typically both outside their range.  All factors are varied in this way.

==Design matrix ==
The design matrix for a central composite design experiment involving ''k'' factors is derived from a matrix, '''d''', containing the following three different parts corresponding to the three types of experimental runs:
#The matrix '''F''' obtained from the factorial experiment.  The factor levels are scaled so that its entries are coded as +1 and &amp;minus;1.  
#The matrix '''C''' from the center points, denoted in coded variables as (0,0,0,...,0), where there are ''k'' zeros. 
#A matrix '''E''' from the axial points, with 2''k'' rows. Each factor is sequentially placed at ±α and all other factors are at zero. The value of α is determined by the designer; while arbitrary, some values may give the design desirable properties. This part would look like:

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf E = \begin{bmatrix}
   \alpha  &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 0  \\
   { - \alpha } &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; \alpha  &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 0  \\
   0 &amp; { - \alpha } &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; 0  \\
    \vdots  &amp; {} &amp; {} &amp; {} &amp; {} &amp; {} &amp; \vdots  \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; \alpha   \\
   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp;  \cdots  &amp;  \cdots  &amp; { - \alpha }  \\
\end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Then '''d''' is the vertical concatenation:
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf d = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf F \\ \mathbf C \\ \mathbf E 
                  \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

The design matrix '''X''' used in linear regression is the horizontal concatenation of a column of 1s (intercept), '''d''', and all elementwise products of a pair of columns of '''d''':

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf X = \begin{bmatrix} \mathbf 1 &amp; \mathbf d &amp; \mathbf d(1)\times\mathbf d(2) &amp; \mathbf d(1)\times\mathbf d(3) &amp; \cdots &amp; \mathbf d(k-1)\times\mathbf d(k) &amp; \mathbf d(1)^2 &amp;\mathbf d(2)^2 &amp;\cdots &amp; \mathbf d(k)^2 \end{bmatrix}, &lt;/math&gt;

where '''d'''(''i'') represents the ''i''th column in '''d'''. 
 
=== Choosing &amp;alpha; ===

There are many different methods to select a useful value of α. Let ''F'' be the number of points due to the factorial design and ''T'' = 2''k'' + ''n'', the number of additional points, where ''n'' is the number of central points in the design. Common values are as follows (Myers, 1971):
#'''Orthogonal design:''': &lt;math&gt;\alpha  = (Q\times F/4)^{1/4}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; Q = (\sqrt{F + T}  -\sqrt{F})^2 &lt;/math&gt;;
#'''Rotatable design''': α = ''F''&lt;sup&gt;1/4&lt;/sup&gt; (the design implemented by [[MATLAB]]’s ''ccdesign'' function).

=== Application of central composite designs for optimization ===
Statistical approaches such as RSM can be employed to maximize the production of a special substance by optimization of operational factors. In contrast to conventional methods, the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques. For instance, in a study, a central composite design was employed to investigate the effect of critical parameters of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw including temperature, time, and ethanol concentration. The residual solid, lignin recovery, and hydrogen yield were selected as the response variables.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Convention on Biological Diversity''' ('''CBD'''), known informally as the '''Biodiversity Convention''', is a [[multilateral treaty]]. The Convention has three main goals including: the conservation of biological diversity (or [[biodiversity]]); the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from [[Germplasm|genetic resource]]s.

In other words, its objective is to develop national strategies for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. It is often seen as the key document regarding [[sustainable development]]. The Convention was opened for signature at the [[Earth Summit]] in Rio de Janeiro on 5 June 1992 and entered into force on 29 December 1993. At the 2010 10th Conference of Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity in October in [[Nagoya]], Japan, the Nagoya Protocol was adopted.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.cbd.int/cop10/ Welcome to COP 10&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and scope==

The notion of an international convention on bio-diversity was conceived at a [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) Ad Hoc Working Group of Experts on Biological Diversity in November 1988. The subsequent year, the Ad Hoc Working Group of Technical and Legal Experts was established for the drafting of a legal text which addressed the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity, as well as the sharing of benefits arising from their utilization with sovereign states and local communities.
In 1991, an intergovernmental negotiating committee was established, tasked with finalizing the convention's text.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/history/|title=History of the Convention|work=Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity (SCBD)|accessdate= 14 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Conference for the Adoption of the Agreed Text of the Convention on Biological Diversity was held in Nairobi, Kenya, in 1992, and its conclusions were distilled in the [[Nairobi Final Act]].&lt;ref name="nairAct"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/doc/handbook/cbd-hb-09-en.pdf Nairobi Final Act of the Conference for the adoption of the agreed text of the Convention on Biological Diversity], Heinrich, M. (2002). Handbook of the Convention on Biological Diversity: Edited by the Secretariat of the Convention on Biological Diversity, Earthscan, London, 2001. {{ISBN|9781853837371}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Convention's text was opened for signature on 5 June 1992 at the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (the Rio "Earth Summit"). By its closing date, 4 June 1993, the convention had received 168 signatures. It entered into force on 29 December 1993.&lt;ref name="CBDweb01" /&gt;

The convention recognized for the first time in international law that the conservation of biodiversity is "a common concern of humankind" and is an integral part of the development process. The agreement covers all [[ecosystem]]s, [[species]], and genetic resources. It links traditional conservation efforts to the economic goal of using biological resources sustainably. It sets principles for the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the use of genetic resources, notably those destined for commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;Louafi, Sélim and Jean-Frédéric Morin, International governance of biodiversity: Involving all the users of genetic resources, IDDRI, 2004, https://www.academia.edu/3809935/Louafi_S._and_J-F_Morin_2004_International_Governance_of_biodiversity_Involving_all_the_Users_of_Genetic_Resources_Les_synth%C3%A8ses_de_lIddri_n_5._4_p&lt;/ref&gt; It also covers the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology through its [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]], addressing technology development and transfer, benefit-sharing and [[biosafety]] issues. Importantly, the Convention is legally binding; countries that join it ('Parties') are obliged to implement its provisions.

The convention reminds decision-makers that natural resources are not infinite and sets out a philosophy of [[sustainable use]]. While past [[conservation biology|conservation]] efforts were aimed at protecting particular species and habitats, the Convention recognizes that ecosystems, species and genes must be used for the benefit of humans. However, this should be done in a way and at a rate that does not lead to the long-term decline of biological diversity.

The convention also offers decision-makers guidance based on the [[precautionary principle]] which demands that where there is a threat of significant reduction or loss of biological diversity, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimize such a threat. The Convention acknowledges that substantial investments are required to conserve [[biodiversity|biological diversity]]. It argues, however, that conservation will bring us significant environmental, economic and social benefits in return.

The Convention on Biological Diversity of 2010 banned some forms of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]].

==Issues==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

Some of the many issues dealt with under the convention include:

* Measures the incentives for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity.
* Regulated access to genetic resources and [[traditional knowledge]], including Prior Informed Consent of the party providing resources.
* Sharing, in a fair and equitable way, the results of research and development and the benefits arising from the commercial and other utilization of [[Genetics|genetic]] resources with the Contracting Party providing such resources (governments and/or local communities that provided the traditional knowledge or biodiversity resources utilized).
* Access to and transfer of technology, including [[biotechnology]], to the governments and/or local communities that provided traditional knowledge and/or biodiversity resources.
* Technical and scientific cooperation.
* Coordination of a global directory of taxonomic expertise (Global Taxonomy Initiative).
* Impact assessment.
* Education and public [[awareness]].
* Provision of financial resources.
* National reporting on efforts to implement treaty commitments.

==Cartagena Protocol==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety}}
The '''Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety''' of the Convention, also known as the Biosafety Protocol, was adopted in January 2000. The Biosafety Protocol seeks to protect biological diversity from the potential risks posed by living modified organisms resulting from modern biotechnology.

The Biosafety Protocol makes clear that products from new technologies must be based on the [[precautionary principle]] and allow developing nations to balance public health against economic benefits. It will for example let countries ban imports of a [[genetically modified organism]] if they feel there is not enough scientific evidence the product is [[safe]] and requires exporters to label shipments containing [[genetically modified]] commodities such as corn or cotton.

The required number of 50 instruments of ratification/accession/approval/acceptance by countries was reached in May 2003. In accordance with the provisions of its Article 37, the Protocol entered into force on 11 September 2003.

== Global Strategy for Plant Conservation ==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

{{main|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation}}

In April 2002, the parties of the UN CBD adopted the recommendations of the Gran Canaria Declaration Calling for a Global Plant Conservation Strategy, and adopted a 16-point plan aiming to slow the rate of plant extinctions around the world by 2010.

==Parties==
As of 2016, the Convention has 196 parties, which includes 195 states and the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/|title=CBD List of Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt; All UN member states—with the exception of the United States—have ratified the treaty. Non-UN member states that have ratified are the [[Cook Islands]], [[Niue]], and the [[State of Palestine]]. The [[Holy See]] and the [[List of states with limited recognition|states with limited recognition]] are non-parties. The US has signed but not ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India Presses U.S. to Pass Biotic Treaty|last=Hazarika|first=Sanjoy|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=23 April 1995|page=1.13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has not announced plans to ratify it.

==International bodies established==
{{ref section|date=February 2017}}

'''Conference of the parties:'''
The convention's governing body is the [[Conference of the parties]] (COP), consisting of all governments (and regional economic integration organizations) that have ratified the treaty. This ultimate authority reviews progress under the Convention, identifies new priorities, and sets work plans for members. The COP can also make amendments to the Convention, create expert advisory bodies, review progress reports by member nations, and collaborate with other international organizations and agreements.

The Conference of the Parties uses expertise and support from several other bodies that are established by the Convention. In addition to committees or mechanisms established on an ad hoc basis, two main organs are:

'''Secretariat:'''
The CBD Secretariat, based in [[Montreal]], operates under the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]. Its main functions are to organize meetings, draft documents, assist member governments in the implementation of the programme of work, coordinate with other international organizations, and collect and disseminate information.

'''Subsidiary body for Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA):'''
The SBSTTA is a committee composed of experts from member governments competent in relevant fields. It plays a key role in making recommendations to the COP on scientific and technical issues.

The 13th Meeting of the SBSTTA, or SBSTTA-13, held from 18&amp;ndash;22 February 2008 at the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] headquarters in Rome, Italy. SBSTTA-13 delegates finalized and adopted recommendations on the in-depth reviews of the work programmes on agricultural and forest biodiversity and SBSTTA's modus operandi for the consideration of new and emerging issues, as well as on inland waters biodiversity, [[marine (ocean)|marine]] biodiversity, [[invasive alien species]], and biodiversity and [[climate change]].

The current chairperson of the SBSTTA is Dr. Theresa Mundita Lim of the [[Philippines]].

==Country implementation==

===National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAP)===
"National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) are the principal instruments for implementing the Convention at the national level (Article 6). The Convention requires countries to prepare a national biodiversity strategy (or equivalent instrument) and to ensure that this strategy is mainstreamed into the planning and activities of all those sectors whose activities can have an impact (positive and negative) on biodiversity. To date [2012-02-01], 173 Parties have developed NBSAPs in line with Article 6."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/nbsap/|title= National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Tanzania have carried out elaborate responses to conserve individual species and specific habitats. The United States of America, a signatory who has not yet ratified the treaty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/27/harrison-ford-conservation-nagoya | location=London | work=[[The Guardian]] | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | title=Harrison Ford calls on US to ratify treaty on conservation | date=27 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; has produced one of the most thorough implementation programs through species Recovery Programs and other mechanisms long in place in the USA for species conservation.

Singapore has also established a detailed ''National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130606095712/http://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/docs/nbc/NPark-booklet-final-4sep.pdf National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''National Biodiversity Centre'' of Singapore represents Singapore in the Convention for Biological Diversity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150119041729/https://www.nparks.gov.sg/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=122&amp;Itemid=124 National Biodiversity Centre]&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Reports===
In accordance with Article 26 of the Convention, Parties prepare national reports on the status of implementation of the Convention.

==Executive secretary==
The current executive secretary is [[Cristiana Pașca Palmer]], who took up this post on 17 March 2017.&lt;ref name="exec"&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/es/default.shtml] as on 20th March 2017&lt;/ref&gt; [[Braulio Ferreira de Souza Dias]] was the previous executive secretary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbd.int/secretariat/former-es/default.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nagoya Protocol==
{{main|Nagoya Protocol}}

The Nagoya Protocol on Access to Genetic Resources and the Fair and Equitable Sharing of Benefits Arising from their Utilization to the Convention on Biological Diversity&lt;ref name="nagoya_text"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbd.int/abs/text/ |title=Text of the Nagoya Protocol |work=cbd.int |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a supplementary agreement to the Convention on Biological Diversity. It provides a transparent legal framework for the effective implementation of one of the three objectives of the CBD: the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources. The Protocol was adopted on 29 October 2010 in Nagoya, Aichi Province, Japan, and entered into force on 12 October 2014. Its objective is the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, thereby contributing to the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.cbd.int/abs/about/|title= Nagoya Protocol}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 COP 11===
{{Main|2012 Hyderabad Biodiversity Conference}}
Leading up to the Conference of the Parties (COP 11) meeting on biodiversity in [[Hyderabad, India]] 2012, preparations for a World Wide Views on Biodiversity has begun, involving old and new partners and building on the experiences from the [[World Wide Views on Global Warming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biodiversity.wwviews.org/  World Wide Views on Biodiversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 COP 12===
Under the theme, "Biodiversity for Sustainable Development," thousands of representatives of governments, NGOs, indigenous peoples, scientists and the private sector gathered in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], Republic of Korea in October 2014 for the 12th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP 12).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbd.int/cop2014; Webcasting: {{cite web |url=http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006120510/http://www.liveto.com/cop12/floor/index.html |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 6–17 October 2014, Parties discussed the implementation of the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020 and its Aichi Biodiversity Targets, which are to be achieved by the end of this decade. The results of Global Biodiversity Outlook 4, the flagship assessment report of the CBD informed the discussions.

The conference gave a mid-term evaluation to the UN Decade on Biodiversity (2011-2020) initiative, which aims to promote the conservation and sustainable use of nature.
 
At the end of the meeting, the meeting adopted the "Pyeongchang Road Map," which addresses ways to achieve biodiversity through technology cooperation, funding and strengthening the capacity of developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;(Source http://www.cbd.int/doc/press/2014/pr-2014-10-06-cop-12-en.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2016 COP 13===
[[File:COP13 Mexico conference.jpg|thumb|COP13 Mexico meeting]]
The thirteenth ordinary meeting of the parties to the convention took place between 2 and 17 December 2016 in Cancun, Mexico.

==Commemorative periods==
2010 was the [[International Year of Biodiversity]] and the Secretariat of the CBD was its focal point. Following a recommendation of CBD signatories during COP 10 at [[Nagoya]] in October 2010, the UN, on 22 December 2010, declared 2011 to 2020 as the [[United Nations Decade on Biodiversity]].

==Criticism==
There have been criticisms against CBD that the Convention has been weakened in implementation due to the resistance of Western countries to the implementation of the pro-South provisions of the Convention. &lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2004) The Unmaking of a Treaty. Biodiversity 5(3) 2004&lt;/ref&gt; CBD is also regarded as a case of a hard treaty gone soft in the implementation trajectory &lt;ref&gt;Harrop, Stuart &amp; Pritchard, Diana. (2011). A Hard Instrument Goes Soft: The Implications of the Convention on Biological Diversity's Current Trajectory. Global Environmental Change-human and Policy Dimensions - GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANGE. 21. 474-480. 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2011.01.014. &lt;/ref&gt; The argument to enforce the treaty as a legally binding multilateral instrument with the Conference of Parties reviewing the infractions and non-compliance is also gaining strength&lt;ref&gt;Faizi, S (2012) CBD: Putting the focus on enforcement. Square Brackets. Issue No. 7. October, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the convention explicitly states that all forms of life are covered by its provisions,&lt;ref name="cbd1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/text/ |title=Text of the CBD|publisher=www.cbd.int|accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; examination of reports and of national biodiversity strategies and action plans submitted by participating countries shows that in practice this is not happening. The fifth report of the European Union, for example, makes frequent reference to animals (particularly fish) and plants, but does not mention [[bacteria]], [[fungi]] or [[protists]] at all.&lt;ref name="cbd_eur1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/eur/eur-nr-05-en.pdf |title=Fifth Report of the European Union to the Convention on Biological Diversity. June 2014 |publisher=www.cbd.int |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Society for Fungal Conservation has assessed more than 100 of these CBD documents for their coverage of fungi using defined criteria to place each in one of six categories. No documents were assessed as good or adequate, less than 10% as nearly adequate or poor, and the rest as deficient, seriously deficient or totally deficient.&lt;ref name="isfc1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fungal-conservation.org/micheli.htm |title=The Micheli Guide to Fungal Conservation |publisher=www.fungal-conservation.org |accessdate=7 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Furthermore, intensive monoculture and human overpopulation are the two most pertinent biodiversity issues to address.

Scientists working with biodiversity and medical research are expressing fears that the Nagoya Protocol is counterproductive, and will will hamper disease prevention and conservation efforts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6396/1405.full|title= When the cure kills—CBD limits biodiversity research|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the threat of imprisonment of scientists will have a chilling effect on research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nature.com/news/biopiracy-ban-stirs-red-tape-fears-1.16028|title= Biopiracy ban stirs red-tape fears}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-commercial researchers and institutions such as [[natural history museum]]s fear maintaining biological reference collections and exchanging material between institutions will become difficult&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/05/05/biosci.biv056.short?rss=1|title= The Nagoya Protocol on Access and Benefit Sharing—International treaty poses challenges for biological collections}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and medical researchers have expressed alarm at plans to expand the protocol to make it illegal to publicly share genetic information, e.g. via [[GenBank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/404|title= Threats to timely sharing of pathogen sequence data|website=science.sciencemag.org|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Critical Quarterly''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in the [[humanities]] published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]]. The [[editor-in-chief]] is [[Colin MacCabe]]. The journal notably published the [[Black Papers]] on education starting in 1969.

==History==
===Early years===
''Critical Quarterly'' was established in 1958 by its first editors [[Brian Cox (poet)|Brian Cox]] (C. B. Cox) and [[A. E.

R. Leavis]]. The latter's legacy was a notable feature of ''Critical Quarterly'''s early years, when it published work by a new generation of scholars including [[Raymond Williams]], [[David Lodge (author)|David Lodge]], and [[Frank Kermode]].&lt;ref name="independent1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/professor-brian-cox-english-scholar-poet-and-editor-of-critical-quarterly-whose-black-papers-sparked-debate-on-education-817250.html |title=Professor Brian Cox: English scholar, poet and editor of 'Critical Quarterly' whose Black Papers sparked debate on education - Obituaries |publisher=''The Independent'' |date=29 April 2008|accessdate=20 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some respects the journal sought to modify Leavis's project; in particular Cox and Dyson felt that Leavis and his acolytes tended unfairly to ignore contemporary writing, partly because of their unshakeable belief in the "myth of a culture in decline".&lt;ref name="autogenerated148"&gt;Alan Sinfield, ''Society and Literature, 1945-1970'' (London: Taylor and Francis, 1983), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; The early years of the journal were notable for the inclusion of contemporary poetry, and ''Critical Quarterly'' helped to launch the careers of [[Sylvia Plath]] (who won one of the first poetry competitions), [[Thom Gunn]], [[Philip Larkin]], and [[Ted Hughes]].&lt;ref name="independent1"/&gt;

===MacCabe editorship===
In 1987, after nearly 30 years of Cox's editorship, [[Colin MacCabe]] took over as editor, announcing some new ambitions for the journal in "Aims for ''Critical Quarterly''".&lt;ref&gt;Colin MacCabe, "Aims for Critical Quarterly", ''Critical Quarterly'', Volume 29, Issue 4, December 1987, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Year's Work in English Studies'' for 1987 noted that "''CritQ'' certainly had seemed for many years to be stuck in a rut, even if a pleasant and occasionally lively one, and one looks forward to the new team's effort to revamp the project entirely."&lt;ref&gt;Tony Pinkney, Makikow Minow, and Diana Knight, "Literary Theory", ''Years Work Eng Studies'' (1987) 68(1): 12-58.&lt;/ref&gt; MacCabe's name was at that time strongly associated with the (at times controversial) importation of various [[structuralism|structuralist]] and [[post-structuralist]] ideas into the study of English Literature, and - while largely sticking to its original ethos - the journal moved in more theoretical directions at the same time as expanding into adjacent disciplines, notably [[film studies]], [[cultural studies]], and [[history]], alongside its more traditional focus on [[literary criticism]]. Its website now claims that the journal "addresses the whole range of cultural forms so that discussions of, for example, cinema and television can appear alongside analyses of the accepted literary canon."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiley.com/bw/aims.asp?ref=0011-1562&amp;site=1 |title=Critical Quarterly - Journal Information |publisher=Wiley.com |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under MacCabe's editorship, ''Critical Quarterly'' has published the work of [[Fredric Jameson]], [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[Jacqueline Rose]], and [[Paul Gilroy]], among many other prominent scholars.

===Critical Quarterly book series===
In 2007, ''Critical Quarterly'' commenced publication of a book series, published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]], which includes books by David Trotter, [[Moustapha Safouan]], and Ashley Tauchert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/Section/id-397552.html |title=Wiley: Critical Quarterly Series |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date= |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Erotic literature''' comprises fictional and factual stories and accounts of human sexual relationships which have the power to or are intended to arouse the reader sexually.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Such [[erotica]] takes the form of novels, short stories, [[poetry]], true-life [[memoir]]s, and [[sex manual]]s.  A common feature of the genre is [[sexual fantasies]] on such themes as [[prostitution]], [[orgies]], [[homosexuality]], [[sado-masochism|sadomasochism]], and many other taboo subjects and [[fetishes]], which may or may not be expressed in explicit language.&lt;ref&gt;Kronhausen (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; Other common elements are [[satire]] and [[social criticism]]. Despite cultural [[taboos]] on such material, circulation of erotic literature was not seen as a major problem before the invention of printing, as the costs of producing individual manuscripts limited distribution to a very small group of readers. The invention of printing, in the 15th century, brought with it both a greater market and increasing restrictions, like [[censorship]] and legal restraints on publication on the grounds of [[obscenity]].&lt;ref name="Hyde 1964; pp. 1-26"&gt;Hyde (1964); pp. 1-26&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, much of the production of this type of material became [[wiktionary:clandestine|clandestine]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982)'' A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon: 7-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Much erotic literature features [[erotic art]], illustrating the text.

===Early periods===
In ancient Sumer, a whole [[Sumerian literature|cycle of poems]] revolved around the erotic lovemaking between the goddess [[Inanna]] and her consort [[Dumuzid the Shepherd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolkstein|first1=Diane|last2=Kramer|first2=Samuel Noah|title=Inanna: Queen of Heaven and Earth: Her Stories and Hymns from Sumer|date=1983|publisher=Harper&amp;Row Publishers|location=New York City, New York|isbn=0-06-090854-8|pages=150–155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Leick|first=Gwendolyn|title=Sex and Eroticism in Mesopotamian Literature|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-1-134-92074-7|location=New York City, New York|pages=64–79, 90–96|quote=|via=|origyear=1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKoWblE4pd0C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many erotic poems have survived from [[ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Greek poets [[Straton of Sardis]] and [[Sappho of Lesbos]] both wrote erotic lyric poems.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Derek Parker]], ed. (1980) ''An Anthology of Erotic Verse''. London: Constable {{ISBN|0-09-463500-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Archilochus]] wrote numerous satirical poems filled with obscene and erotic imagery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cahill|first1=Thomas|title=Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: Why the Greeks Matter|date=2003|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-0-385-49554-7|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erotic poems continued to be written in [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] and Roman times by writers like  [[Automedon (poet)|Automedon]] (''The Professional'' and ''Demetrius the Fortunate''), [[Philodemus]] (''Charito'') and [[Marcus Argentarius]]. Notable Roman erotic poets included [[Catullus]], [[Propertius]], [[Tibullus]], [[Ovid]], [[Martial]] and [[Juvenal]], and the anonymous [[Priapeia]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Some later Latin authors such as [[Joannes Secundus]] also wrote erotic verse.

''[[The Seven Beauties]]'' ({{lang-fa|هفت پیکر}}) also known as ''Bahramnameh'' ({{lang|fa|بهرام‌نامه}}, ''The Book of Bahram'') is a romantic epic by the Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]] written in 1197. This poem is a part of the ''Nizami's Khamsa''. The original title ''Haft Peykar'' can be translated literally as “seven portraits” with the figurative meaning of “seven beauties.” The poem is a masterpiece of erotic literature, but it is also a profoundly [[moralistic]] work.&lt;ref name="Blois"&gt;François de Blois. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/haft-peykar Haft Peykar] // [[Encyclopædia Iranica]]. — 15 December 2002. — V. XI. — pp. 522-524.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Renaissance period, many poems were not written for publication; instead, they were merely circulated in manuscript form among a relatively limited readership. This was the original method of circulation for the ''[[Sonnets]]'' of [[William Shakespeare]], who also wrote the erotic poems ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Parker, ed. (1980) ''An Anthology of Erotic Verse''; pp. 88-96&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th and 18th centuries===
[[File:Jacob Huysmans - Portrait of John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester 1.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Jacob Huysmans]] of [[John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester]], a notorious author of erotic verse]]
In the 17th century, [[John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester]] (1647–80) was notorious for obscene verses, many of which were published posthumously in compendiums of poetry by him and other [[Restoration rake]]s such as [[Charles Sedley|Sir Charles Sedley]], [[Charles Sackville, 6th Earl of Dorset]], and [[George Etherege]]. Though many of the poems attributed to Rochester were actually by other authors, his reputation as a libertine was such that his name was used as a selling point by publishers of collections of erotic verse for centuries after. One poem which definitely was by him was "A Ramble in [[St. James's Park]]" in which the protagonist's quest for healthy exercise in the park uncovers instead "Bugg'ries, Rapes and Incest" on ground polluted by debauchery from the time when "Ancient Pict began to Whore". This poem was being censored from collections of Rochester's poetry as late as 1953, though, in line with a general change in attitudes to sexuality, it was dramatised as a scene in the film ''[[The Libertine (2004 film)|The Libertine]]'' about his life based on an existing play.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982) ''A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon Books: 22, 40-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Derek, ed. (1980) ''An Anthology of Erotic Verse''. London: Constable&lt;/ref&gt;

English collections of erotic verse by various hands, include the ''Drollery'' collections of the 17th century; ''[[Pills to Purge Melancholy]]'' (1698–1720); the ''[[Roxburghe Ballads]]''; ''[[Bishop Percy's Folio]]''; ''The Musical Miscellany''; ''National Ballad and Song: Merry Songs and Ballads Prior to the Year AD 1800'' (1895-7) edited by J. S. Farmer; the three volume ''[[Poetica Erotica]]'' (1921) and its more obscene supplement the ''Immortalia'' (1927) both edited by T. R. Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford J. Scheiner (1996)'' The Essential Guide to Erotic Literature, Part Two: After 1920''. Ware: Wordsworth: 26-27&lt;/ref&gt; French collections include ''Les Muses gaillardes'' (1606) ''Le Cabinet satyrique'' (1618) and ''La Parnasse des poetes satyriques'' (1622).&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982) ''A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon Books: 65&lt;/ref&gt;

A famous collection of four erotic poems, was published in England in 1763, called ''An Essay on Woman''. This included the title piece, an obscene parody of [[Alexander Pope]]'s "[[An Essay on Man]]"; "Veni Creator: or, The Maid's Prayer", which is original; the "Universal Prayer", an obscene parody of Pope's poem of the same name, and "The Dying Lover to his Prick", which parodies "A Dying Christian to his Soul" by Pope. These poems have been attributed to [[John Wilkes]] and/or Thomas Potter and receive the distinction of being the only works of erotic literature ever read out loud, in their entirety in the [[House of Lords]]—before being declared obscene and blasphemous by that august body and the supposed author, Wilkes, declared an [[outlaw]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982) ''A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon Books: 71-4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] worked to collect and preserve Scottish folk songs, sometimes revising, expanding, and adapting them. One of the better known of these collections is ''The Merry Muses of Caledonia'' (the title is not by Burns), a collection of bawdy lyrics that were popular in the music halls of Scotland as late as the 20th century.

===19th century===
[[File:Maurice Ray - Aphrodite 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Illustration by [[:fr:Maurice Ray|Maurice Ray]] for [[Pierre Louÿs]]'s ''[[Aphrodite: mœurs antiques]]'']]

One of the 19th century's foremost poets—[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]—devoted much of his considerable talent to erotic verse, producing, inter alia, twelve eclogues on [[flagellation]] titled ''The Flogging Block'' "by Rufus Rodworthy, annotated by Barebum Birchingly";&lt;ref&gt;Derek Parker, ed. (1980) ''An Anthology of Erotic Verse'': 22&lt;/ref&gt; more was published anonymously in ''[[The Whippingham Papers]]'' (c. 1888).&lt;ref&gt;Bragman, L. J. (1934). "The Case of Algernon Charles Swinburne: a study in Sadism". ''[[The Psychoanalytic Review|Psychoanal. Rev.]]'', '''21''':59-74.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another notorious anonymous 19th-century poem on the same subject is ''[[The Rodiad]]'', ascribed (seemingly falsely and in jest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Canada exposed | volume=20 | series=Canadian Studies | first=Faye | last=Hammill | editor1-first=Pierre | editor1-last=Anctil | editor2-first=Andre | editor2-last=Loiselle | editor3-first=Christopher | editor3-last=Rolfe | publisher=Peter Lang | year=2009 | isbn=90-5201-548-1 | chapter=John Glassco, Canadian erotica and the 'Lying Chronicle' | page=286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to [[George Colman the Younger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwo.ca/english/canadianpoetry/cpjrn/vol13/darling.htm |title=John Glassco's Squire Hardman: a Poem and its Contexts |publisher=Uwo.ca |date=1954-07-09 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Camden Hotten]] even wrote a pornographic comic opera, ''[[Lady Bumtickler’s Revels]]'', on the theme of [[flagellation]] in 1872.&lt;ref name=prins152&gt;{{cite book | title=Victorian Sappho | first=Yopie | last=Prins | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=1999 | isbn=0-691-05919-5 | page=152 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Louÿs]] helped found a literary review, ''La Conque'' in 1891,&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Lloyd, ''Mallarmé: the Poet and His Circle'', Ithaca, NY: [[Cornell University Press]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-8014-8993-8}}, pp. 195-197&lt;/ref&gt; where he proceeded to publish ''[[Astarte]]''—an early collection of erotic verse already marked by his distinctive elegance and refinement of style. He followed up in 1894 with another erotic collection in 143 prose poems—''[[Songs of Bilitis]] (Les Chansons de Bilitis)'', this time with strong lesbian themes.

===20th century===
Although [[D. H. Lawrence]] could be regarded as a writer of love poems, he usually dealt in the less romantic aspects of love such as sexual frustration or the sex act itself. [[Ezra Pound]] in his ''Literary Essays'' complained of Lawrence's interest in his own "disagreeable sensations" but praised him for his "low-life narrative." This is a reference to Lawrence's dialect poems akin to the Scots poems of [[Robert Burns]], in which he reproduced the language and concerns of the people of [[Nottinghamshire]] from his youth. He called one collection of poems ''Pansies'' partly for the simple ephemeral nature of the verse but also a pun on the French word ''panser'', to dress or bandage a wound. "The Noble Englishman" and "Don't Look at Me" were removed from the official edition of ''Pansies'' on the grounds of obscenity; Lawrence felt wounded by this.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

From the age of 17, [[Gavin Ewart]] acquired a reputation for wit and accomplishment through such works as "Phallus in Wonderland" and "Poems and Songs", which appeared in 1939 and was his first collection. The intelligence and casually flamboyant virtuosity with which he framed his often humorous commentaries on human behaviour made his work invariably entertaining and interesting. The irreverent eroticism for which his poetry is noted resulted in [[W H Smith]]'s banning of his "The Pleasures of the Flesh" (1966) from their shops.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Canadian poet [[John Glassco]] wrote ''[[Squire Hardman (poem)|Squire Hardman]]'' (1967), a long poem in [[heroic couplets]], purporting to be a reprint of an 18th-century poem by [[George Colman the Younger]], on the theme of flagellation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Canada Exposed | volume=20 | series=Canadian Studies | first=Faye | last=Hammill | editor1-first=Pierre | editor1-last=Anctil | editor2-first=Andre | editor2-last=Loiselle | editor3-first=Christopher | editor3-last=Rolfe | publisher=Peter Lang | year=2009 | isbn=90-5201-548-1 | chapter=John Glassco, Canadian erotica and the 'Lying Chronicle' | pages=279–296 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example he shows a keen interest in Indian thought and literature and has written many erotic poems on Indian themes: Indian mythology; classical Sanskrit plays; Indian philosophy; Indian folktales and translated Sanskrit poetry. Some of these works are: The Caurapâñcâśikâ (The Love-Thief) Of Bilhana; The Amarusataka of Amaru; Shakuntala; The Subhashitasringar; The-Travels-Of-Pandit-Ganja-Deen-The-Sadhaka; The-Twenty-Fifth-Tale-Of-The-Vetala; Rishyasringa; Gitavesya.

==Erotic fiction==
'''Erotic fiction''' is the name given to [[fiction]] that deals with sex or sexual themes, generally in a more literary or serious way than the fiction seen in [[pornographic magazine]]s and sometimes including elements of [[satire]] or [[social criticism]]. Such works have frequently been banned by the government or religious authorities. It should be noted, however, that apparently non-fictional works dealing with sex or sexual themes may contain fictional elements; calling an erotic book 'a memoir' is a literary device that is common in this genre. For reasons similar to those that make pseudonyms both commonplace and often deviously set up, the boundary between fiction and non-fiction is often very diffuse. Erotic fiction is credited in large part for the sexual awakening and liberation of women into the 20th and 21st centuries.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

===History of western erotic fiction===

====Ancient, medieval, and early modern periods====

''[[The Satyricon]]'' of [[Petronius Arbiter]] (later made into a [[Fellini Satyricon|film]] by [[Fellini]]) is an ancient Roman novel, which has partially survived, narrating the misadventures of an impotent man named Encolpius, who has been cursed by the god [[Priapus]]. The novel is filled with bawdy and obscene episodes, including orgies, ritual sex, and other erotic incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arbiter|first1=Petronius|title=The Satyricon|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/5225/5225-h/5225-h.htm|website=Project Gutenberg|publisher=Project Gutenberg|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's ''Phoenician Tale'' reveal that a genre of picaresque erotic novel also existed in ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reardon|first1=Bryan P.|title=Collected Ancient Greek Novels|date=1989|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-04306-5|pages=809–810|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AZT8fEYMKBwC&amp;pg=PA809&amp;lpg=PA809&amp;dq=Phoenicica+ancient+Greek+novel&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WhOs-cnxj3&amp;sig=mdeilxdkoNdftIOLmQQE9z0vBUM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3-pvU4ZrUAhWEwiYKHcqdDE8Q6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Phoenicica%20ancient%20Greek%20novel&amp;f=false|accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, some of the [[ancient Greek novel|ancient Greek romance novels]], such as ''[[Daphnis and Chloe]]'', also contain elements of sexual fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|pages=184–185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the medieval period, there is the ''[[Decameron]]'' (1353) by the Italian [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] (made into a [[The Decameron (1970 film)|film]] by [[Pasolini]]) which features tales of lechery by monks and the seduction of nuns from convents. This book was banned in many countries. Even five centuries after publication copies were seized and destroyed by the authorities in the US and the UK. For instance between 1954 and 1958 eight orders for destruction of the book were made by English magistrates.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); pp. 71-72&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 15th century, another classic of Italian erotica is a series of bawdy folk tales called the ''Facetiae'' by [[Gian Francesco Poggio Bracciolini]]. ''[[The Tale of Two Lovers]]'' ({{lang-la|Historia de duobus amantibus}}) written in 1444 was one of the bestselling books of the 15th century, even before its author, [[Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini]], became [[Pope Pius II]]. It is one of the earliest examples of an [[epistolary novel]], full of erotic imagery. The first printed edition was published by [[Ulrich Zell|Ulrich Zel]] in Cologne between 1467 and 1470.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrall |first=E.

The 16th century was notable for the ''[[Heptameron]]'' of [[Marguerite de Navarre]] (1558), inspired by Boccaccio's ''Decameron'' and the notorious ''[[I Modi]]'' which married erotic drawings, depicting postures assumed in sexual intercourse, by [[Giulio Romano]], with obscene sonnets by [[Pietro Aretino]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); pp. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

Aretino also wrote the celebrated [[whore dialogue]] ''Ragionamenti'' in which the sex lives of wives, whores and nuns are compared and contrasted.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); pp.  76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ian Frederick Moulton, ''Before Pornography: erotic writing in Early Modern England'' (Studies in the History of Sexuality.)

Blanshard, ''Sex: Vice and Love from Antiquity to Modernity'', Chichester: John Wiley and Sons, 2010, {{ISBN|1-4051-2291-9}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;  Such works typically concerned the sexual education of a naive younger woman by an experienced older woman and often included elements of philosophising, satire and [[anti-clericalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Kronhausen (1969), pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt; [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] has translated ''L'École des filles'', as ''The School of Venus'', (1972), described on its back cover as "both an uninhibited manual of sexual technique and an erotic masterpiece of the first order".&lt;ref&gt;The original title is ''L'escole des filles, ou: la philosophie des dames''; later editions sometimes ascribe it to M. Mililot (sic). Pascal Durand edited it in 1959.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The School of Venus'' (orig: ''[[:de:L’École des filles|L'École des filles, ou la Philosophie des dames]]'') by Michel Millot et Jean L'Ange ([[New American Library]] 1971)  (Panther 1972) {{ISBN|0-586-03674-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his diary [[Samuel Pepys]] records reading and (in an often censored passage) masturbating over this work.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Chorier's  ''Dialogues of Luisa Sigea'' goes a bit further than its predecessors in this genre and has the older female giving practical instruction of a lesbian nature to the younger woman plus recommending the spiritual and erotic benefits of a flogging from willing members of the holy orders.&lt;ref&gt;Muchembled (2008) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; This work was translated into many languages under various different titles, appearing in English as ''A Dialogue between a Married Woman and a Maid'' in various editions.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982)'' A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon: 34-46&lt;/ref&gt; ''The School of Women'' first appeared as a work in [[Latin language|Latin]] entitled ''Aloisiae Sigaeae, Toletanae, Satyra sotadica de arcanis Amoris et Veneris''. This manuscript claimed that it was originally written in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] by [[Luisa Sigea de Velasco]], an erudite poet and maid of honor at the court of [[Lisbon]] and was then translated into Latin by Jean or [[Johannes Meursius]]. The attribution to Sigea and Meursius was a lie; the true author was [[Nicolas Chorier]].

A unique work of this time is ''[[Sodom, or the Quintessence of Debauchery]]'' (1684), a [[closet play]] by the notorious [[Restoration rake]], [[John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester]] in which Bolloxinion, King of Sodom, authorises "that buggery may be used O'er all the land, so cunt be not abused", which order, though appealing to soldiery, has deleterious effects generally, leading the court physician to counsel: "Fuck women, and let Bugg'ry be no more".&lt;ref&gt;Kronhausen (1969); pp. 26-32&lt;/ref&gt;

====18th century====
 [[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (6).jpg|thumb|right|Scene from chapter eight of ''Fanny Hill'']]
An early pioneer of the publication of erotic works in England was [[Edmund Curll]] (1675–1747) who published many of the [[Merryland]] books. These were a somewhat peculiar English genre of erotic fiction in which the female body (and sometimes the male) was described in terms of a [[landscape]].&lt;ref name="Patrick J Kearney 1982"&gt;Patrick J Kearney (1982) ''A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon: 53-7&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest work in this genre seems to be ''Erotopolis: The Present State of Bettyland'' (1684) probably by [[Charles Cotton]]. This was included, in abbreviated form, in ''The Potent Ally: or Succours from Merryland'' (1741). Other works include '' A New Description of Merryland. Containing a Topographical, Geographical and Natural History of that Country'' (1740) by Thomas Stretzer, ''Merryland Displayed'' (1741) and set of maps entitled ''A Compleat Set of Charts of the Coasts of Merryland'' (1745). The last book in this genre appears to be a parody of [[Laurence Sterne]]'s ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'' (1768) entitled  ''La Souriciere. The Mousetrap. A Facetious and Sentimental Excursion through part of Austrian Flanders and France'' (1794) by "Timothy Touchit".&lt;ref name="Patrick J Kearney 1982"/&gt;

The rise of the novel in 18th-century England provided a new medium for erotica. One of the most famous in this new genre was ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' (1748) by [[John Cleland]]. This book set a new standard in literary smut and was often adapted for the cinema in the 20th century. [[Peter Fryer]] suggests that ''Fanny Hill'' was a high point in British erotica, at least in the eighteenth century, in a way that mainstream literature around it had also reached a peak at that time, with writers like Defoe, Richardson and Fielding all having made important and lasting contributions to literature in its first half. After 1750, he suggests, when the [[British literature#The roots of Romanticism: 1750–1798|Romantic period]] began, the quality of mainstream writing and of smut declined in tandem. Writes Fryer: "sex was driven out of the English novel in the latter half of the eighteenth century. The castration of imaginative English literature made the clandestine literature of sex the most poverty stricken and boring in Europe".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Fryer (1966) ''Public Case-Private Scandal'', Secker &amp; Warburg, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sade 1.jpeg|thumb|left|Justine, or The Misfortunes of Virtue]]

Meanwhile, French writers kept their stride. One genre, which vies in oddness with the English "Merryland" productions, was inspired by the newly translated ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and involved the transformation of people into objects which were in propinquity with or employed in sexual relationships: such as [[sofas]], [[dildos]] and even [[bidet]]s. The climax of this trend is represented in French philosopher [[Diderot]]'s ''[[Les Bijoux indiscrets]]'' (1747) in which a [[magic ring]] is employed to get women's [[vaginas]] to give an account of their intimate sexual histories.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Kearney (1982) ''A History of Erotic Literature''. Parragon: 60-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Other works of French erotica from this period include ''[[Thérèse Philosophe]]'' (1748) by [[Jean-Baptiste de Boyer, Marquis d'Argens]] which describes a girl's initiation into the secrets of both philosophy and sex.;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Steel (2003) ''Vive la Révolution''. London, Scribner; pp. 39-40&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Lifted Curtain or Laura's Education'', about a young girl's sexual initiation by her father, written by the French revolutionary politician [[Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, comte de Mirabeau|Comte de Mirabeau]]; also [[Les Liaisons dangereuses]] (Dangerous Liaisons) by [[Pierre Choderlos de Laclos]], first published in 1782.

In the late 18th century, such works as ''[[Justine, or the Misfortunes of Virtue]]'' and ''[[120 Days of Sodom]]'' by the [[Marquis de Sade]] were exemplars of the theme of [[sado-masochism]] and influenced later erotic accounts of [[Sadism and masochism in fiction]]. De Sade (as did the later writer Sacher-Masoch) lent his name to the sexual acts which he describes in his work.

====19th century====
In the Victorian period, the quality of erotic fiction was much below that of the previous century—it was largely written by 'hacks'{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}. Some works, however, borrowed from established literary models, such as [[Dickens]]. It also featured a curious form of [[social stratification]]. Even in the throes of orgasm, the social distinctions between master and servant (including form of address) were scrupulously observed. Significant elements of [[sado-masochism]] were present in some examples, perhaps reflecting the influence of the English [[Public school (UK)|public school]], where [[flagellation]] was routinely used as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Pearsall (1969) "The Worm in the Bud: the world of Victorian sexuality", Macmillan; pp. 404-22&lt;/ref&gt; These clandestine works were often anonymous or written under a pseudonym, and sometimes undated, thus definite information about them often proves elusive.

English erotic novels from this period include ''[[The Lustful Turk]]'' (1828); ''[[The Romance of Lust]]'' (1873); ''[[The Convent School, or Early Experiences of A Young Flagellant]]'' (1876) by [[Rosa Coote]] [pseud.]; ''[[The Mysteries of Verbena House]], or, Miss Bellasis Birched for Thieving'' (1882) by ''Etonensis'' [pseud.], actually by [[George Augustus Sala]] and [[James Campbell Reddie]]; ''[[The Autobiography of a Flea]]'' (1887); ''[[Venus in India]]'' (1889) by 'Captain Charles Devereaux';&lt;ref&gt;Hyam, Ronald (1990) "Empire and sexuality: the British experience", in: ''Studies in Imperialism'', Manchester University Press {{ISBN|0-7190-2504-4}}; p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarman, Francis (2005) ''White Skin, Dark Skin, Power, Dream: collected essays on literature and culture'' (I. O. Evans studies in the philosophy and criticism of literature; vol. 27.)

It first appeared in 1982 and was written by one Gordon Grimley, a sometime managing director of Penthouse International.&lt;ref&gt;"Introduction" to ''Beatrice'' (2001) by [[Gordon Grimley]]. London, The Scarlet Library (illustrated).&lt;/ref&gt;

Clandestine erotic periodicals of this age include ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', ''[[The Oyster]]'' and ''[[The Boudoir]]'', collections of erotic tales, rhymes, songs and parodies published in London between 1879 and 1883.

[[File:Publishers carrington catalogue coverpage.jpg|right|Coverpage of a catalogue of books published by [[Charles Carrington]] (Paris, 1906)]]
The centre of the trade in such material in England at this period was Holywell Street, off the [[Strand, London]]. An important publisher of erotic material in the early 19th century was [[George Cannon (publisher)|George Cannon]] (1789–1854), followed in mid-century by [[William Dugdale (publisher)|William Dugdale]] (1800–1868) and [[John Camden Hotten]] (1832–1873).&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964): 167-68&lt;/ref&gt;

An important and entertaining conspectus and evaluation of 19th-century (pre-1885) and earlier underground erotica, from the author's own private archive, is provided by Victorian writer [[Henry Spencer Ashbee]], using the pseudonym "Pisanus Fraxi", in his bibliographical trilogy ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (1877), ''Centuria Librorum Absconditorum'' (1879) and ''Catena Librorum Tacendorum'' (1885). His plot summaries of the works he discusses in these privately printed volumes are themselves a contribution to the genre. Originally of very limited circulation, changing attitudes have led to his work now being widely available.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Spencer Ashbee (1969) ''Index of Forbidden Books''. Sphere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Marcus (1969) ''The Other Victorians''. London, Corgi; pp. 34-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable European works of erotica at this time were ''[[Gamiani, or Two Nights of Excess]]'' (1833) by Frenchman [[Alfred de Musset]] and ''[[Venus in Furs]]'' (1870) by the [[Austria]]n author [[Leopold von Sacher-Masoch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Towards the end of the 19th century, a more "cultured" form of erotica began to appear by such as the poet [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] who pursued themes of paganism, lesbianism and sado-masochism in such works as ''[[Lesbia Brandon]]'' and in contributions to ''[[The Whippingham Papers]]'' (1888) edited by St George Stock, author of ''[[The Romance of Chastisement]]'' (1866). This was associated with the [[Decadent movement]], in particular, with [[Aubrey Beardsley]] and the ''[[The Yellow Book|Yellow Book]]''. But it was also to be found in France, amongst such writers as [[Pierre Louys]], author of ''[[Les chansons de Bilitis]]'' (1894) (a celebration of lesbianism and sexual awakening).

Pioneering works of male homosexual erotica from this time were ''[[The Sins of the Cities of the Plain]]'' (1881),&lt;ref&gt;Harford Montgomery Hyde, "The love that dared not speak its name: a candid history of homosexuality in Britain", Little, Brown, 1970, pp.121–123&lt;/ref&gt; which features the celebrated Victorian [[transvestite]] duo of [[Boulton and Park]] as characters,&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Pearsall (1971) ''The Worm in the Bud: The World of Victorian Sexuality''.

[[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s ''[[Lolita]]'' is often described as an erotic novel, but other critics view it more as a literary drama with elements of eroticism.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''Lolita'' and ''The Story of O'' were published by [[Olympia Press]], a [[Paris]]-based [[publisher]], launched in 1953 by [[Maurice Girodias]] as a rebadged version of the [[Obelisk Press]] he inherited from his father [[Jack Kahane]]. It published a mix of erotic fiction and [[avant-garde]] [[literary fiction|literary]] works. ''[[The Girls of Radcliff Hall]]'' is a ''[[roman à clef]]'' novel in the form of a [[lesbian]] girls' [[school story]] written in the 1930s by the British composer and bon-vivant [[Gerald Berners]], the 14th Lord Berners, under the [[pseudonym]] "Adela Quebec", published and distributed privately in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Judith|last1=Still|first2=Michael|last2=Worton|title=Textuality and Sexuality: Reading Theories and Practices|publisher=Manchester University Press|date=1993|isbn=0-7190-3605-4|page= 190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend in the twentieth century was the rise of the [[lesbian pulp fiction]]. Works such as ''[[The Price of Salt]]'' (1952), ''[[Spring Fire]]'' (1952), ''[[Desert of the Heart]]'' (1964), and ''[[Patience and Sarah]]'' (1969) were only a few examples of this subgenre. Many of the authors were women themselves, such as [[Gale Wilhelm]] and [[Ann Bannon]].

===Asian erotic fiction===
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}
[[File:Rouputuan1705.jpg|thumb|right|Front cover of the 1705 edition of ''The Carnal Prayer Mat'']]
[[Chinese literature]] has a tradition of erotic fiction dating back to at least the 16th century. The earliest novel with explicit sexuality is [[Ruyijun zhuan|''Ruyijun zhuan'' (The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction)]], by [[Xu Changling]]. The critic Charles Stone has argued that pornographic technique is the "union of banality, obscenity, and repetition," and contains just the "rudiments" of plot, style, and characterization, while anything that is not sexually stimulating is avoided. If this is the case, he concluded, then ''The Lord of Perfect Satisfaction'' is the "fountainhead of Chinese erotica," but not pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Stone.

(Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press,  2003), pp. 13-14. {{ISBN|0824824121}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another notable work is ''[[The Carnal Prayer Mat]]'' usually attributed to [[Li Yu (author)|Li Yu]] (1657). The most famous sexually explicit novel is the ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'' written by an author who used only a pseudonym (his real name is unknown).

There is also a tradition of erotic fiction in Japan. Some portion of this is [[doujinshi]], or independent comics, which are often [[fan fiction]]. The [[sharebon]] (洒落本) was a pre-modern Japanese literary genre. Plots revolved around humor and entertainment at the pleasure quarters. It is a subgenre of [[gesaku]].

In Indonesia, a mysterious erotic writer known only as Enny Arrow&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/enny.arrow.5 Enny Arrow]; facebook&lt;/ref&gt; wrote countless novels from the late 1970s until the early 1990s which were secretly circulated through magazine sellers. Most of the novels are known for their vulgar and hyperbolic, sometimes comical language. They are now regarded as classics by some Indonesians and have been scanned for historical purposes.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===Contemporary erotic fiction===
In the 21st century, a number of female authors have risen to prominence, including [[Alison Tyler]], [[Rachel Kramer Bussel]] and [[Carol Queen]]. Janine Ashbless, Kristina Lloyd, and Portia da Costa are well known for their erotic novels and short stories.

Other authors celebrate the term 'erotica' but also question why literature 'with the sex left in' should be considered outside literary fiction.

The debate has been rekindled by the release, in 2012, of the ''50 Shades of Grey'' trilogy written by [[E. L. James]]. The phenomenal success of her erotica for every woman, dubbed 'mommyporn', has given rise to satires like ''Fifty Shames of Earl Grey'' by 'Fanny Merkin' (real name [[Andrew Shaffer]]), a book of essays called ''Fifty Writers on Fifty Shades'' (ed. [[Lori Perkins]]), a parody called ''Fifty Sheds of Grey''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2252688/50-Sheds-Grey-spoof-leaves-original-shade-Book-outsells-original-past-weeks.html|title=50 Sheds of Grey spoof leaves original in the shade|date=23 December 2012|work=MailOnline|accessdate=7 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and editors of erotic imprints re-evaluating the content and presentation of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Seduction Stories.

A development in contemporary erotica has been that, contrary to some previous views that it was mainly a male interest, many women readers are aroused by it, whether it be traditional pornography or tailor-made [[women's erotica]]. [[Romantic novel]]s are sometimes marketed as erotica—or vice versa—as "mainstream" romance in recent decades has begun to exhibit blatant (if poetic) descriptions of sex. [[Erotic romance novels|Erotic romance]] is a relatively new genre of romance with an erotic theme and very explicit love scenes, but with a romance at the heart of the story. Erotic fantasy is a [[subgenre]] of [[fantasy|fantasy fiction]] and utilizes [[erotica]] in a fantasy setting. These stories can essentially cover any of the other subgenres of fantasy, such as [[high fantasy]], [[contemporary fantasy]], or even [[historical fantasy]]. The extents of the genre to break existing conventions and limits in subject matter have managed to shock popular audiences, with genres such as [[monster erotica]] emerging with the ease of digital publishing.

Erotic [[fantasy]] fiction has similarities to [[romantic fantasy]] but is more explicit. Erotic fantasy can also be found in [[fan fiction]], which uses plot elements and characters from popular fiction such as television series, movies or novels. Erotic fan fiction may use characters from existing works in relationships undreamed of by their creators, such as "[[Slash fiction|slash]]" (homoerotic) fan fiction. Fan fiction and its Japanese counterpart, [[doujinshi]], account for an enormous proportion of all erotica written today.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

====Internet erotic fiction====
{{cleanup|section|date=December 2010}}
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
The Internet and digital revolution in [[history of erotic depictions|erotic depiction]] has changed the forms of representing scenes of a sexual nature. One researcher&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Anne Skipp, ''British Eighteenth-century Erotic Literature: a reassessment''. Ph.D. thesis, University of Leeds, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that erotic literature was available among the poor and performed at public readings in 18th-century Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2007-03/uol-sit032307.php|title= Eureka publicity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erotica was present on the Internet from the earliest days, as seen from rec.arts.erotica on Usenet. This news group was a moderated forum for the exchange of erotic stories that predated the creation of the World Wide Web. Most of this migrated to the [[alt.* hierarchy]] forums by the 1990s, including [[alt.sex.stories]]. The vast majority of Internet erotica is of an amateur nature, written for the enjoyment of the author and readers instead of for profit. Increased interactivity and anonymity allows casual or hobby writers the opportunity not only to author their own stories but also to share them with a world-wide audience. Many authors adopt colorful pseudonyms and can develop cult followings within their genre, though a small number use (or claim to use) their real names. Among [[transgender]] or [[genderqueer]] authors it is a common practice to adopt a feminine or masculine alter-ego, although it is not unheard of for a writer to use his or her own given name.

==Other accounts==

===Writings of prostitutes===
[[File:Harris List Covent Garden Ladies 1773.gif|thumb|Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies]][[Prostitution]] was the focus of much of the earliest erotic works. The very term "[[pornography]]" is derived from the Greek ''pornographos'' meaning "writer about prostitutes", originally denoting descriptions of the lives and manners of prostitutes and their customers in [[Ancient Greece]]. According to [[Athenaeus]] in ''[[The Deipnosophists]]'' these constituted a considerable genre, with many lubricious treatises, stories and dramas on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); pp. 34-44&lt;/ref&gt; A surviving example of this genre is [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''Dialogues of the Courtesans''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lucian|first1=--|title=The Mimes of the Courtesans|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/luc/motc/index.htm|website=sacredtexts.org|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accounts of prostitution have continued as a major part of the genre of erotic literature. In the 18th century directories of [[prostitutes]] and their services, such as ''[[Harris's List of Covent Garden Ladies]]'' (1757–1795), provided both entertainment and instruction.

In the 19th century, the sensational journalism of [[William Thomas Stead|W. T. Stead]]'s ''[[The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon]]'' (1885) about the procuring of underage girls into the brothels of Victorian London provided a stimulus for the erotic imagination. Stead's account was widely translated and the revelation of "padded rooms for the purpose of stifling the cries of the tortured victims of lust and brutality" and the symbolic figure of "The Minotaur of London"  confirmed European observers worst imaginings about "Le Sadisme anglais" and inspired erotic writers to write of similar scenes set in London or involving sadistic English gentlemen. Such writers include  [[D'Annunzio]] in ''Il Piacere'', [[Paul-Jean Toulet]] in ''Monsieur de Paur'' (1898), [[Octave Mirbeau]] in ''[[The Torture Garden (novel)|Jardin des Supplices]]'' (1899) and [[Jean Lorrain]] in ''Monsieur de Phocas'' (1901).&lt;ref&gt;Mario Praz (1970) ''The Romantic Agony''. Oxford University Press: 443-451&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known recent works in this genre are ''[[Xaviera Hollander#Author|The Happy Hooker: My Own Story]]'' (1971) by the Dutch madame [[Xaviera Hollander]] and ''[[The Intimate Adventures of a London Call Girl]]'' (2005) by [[Belle de Jour (writer)|Belle de Jour]].

===Erotic memoirs===
[[File:Casanova-Icosameron.png|thumb|left|Medallion portrait of Casanova, engraving by Berka, used as frontispiece for ''Icosameron'' (1788)]]

Erotic memoirs include [[Casanova]]'s  ''[[Histoire de ma vie]]'', from the 18th century. Notable English works of this genre from the 19th century include ''The Ups and Downs of Life'' (1867) by [[Edward Sellon]] and ''[[My Secret Life (erotica)|My Secret Life]]'' by "Walter". Edward Sellon was a writer, translator and illustrator of erotic literature who wrote erotica for the pornographic publisher William Dugdale, including such works as ''[[The New Epicurean]]'' (1865).&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde (1964) ''A History of Pornography'': 113-5&lt;/ref&gt; The true identity of "Walter" is very mysterious.  Ian Gibson, in ''The Erotomaniac'' speculates that ''My Secret Life'' was really written by Henry Spencer Ashbee and therefore it is possible that "Walter" is a fiction. A famous German erotic work of this time, published in two parts in 1868 and 1875 entitled ''Pauline the Prima Donna'' purports to be the memoirs of the opera singer [[Wilhelmine Schröder-Devrient]]. Various discrepancies with known facts of the singer's life, however, have led many to doubt the veracity of this book and the erotic adventures contained in the second volume, at least, appear to be very implausible. These include the author indulging in lesbian sadomasochism, group sex, sodomy, bestiality, [[scatology]], [[necrophilia]], prostitution and [[vampirism]]: all before she had reached the age of 27.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford J. Scheiner (1996) ''The Essential Guide to Erotic Literature, Part One: Before 1920''. Ware: Wordsworth: 91-113&lt;/ref&gt; 20th-century contributions to the genre include [[Frank Harris]]'s ''[[My Life and Loves]]'' (1922–27) and the convicted Austrian sex criminal [[Edith Cadivec]]'s ''Confessions and Experiences'' and its sequel ''Eros, the Meaning of My Life'' (published together 1930-1).&lt;ref&gt;Armand Coppens (1973)'' The Memoirs of an Erotic Bookseller''. St Albans, Panther: 66-69&lt;/ref&gt; A 21st-century example is ''[[One Hundred Strokes of the Brush Before Bed]]'' (2004) by [[Melissa Panarello]].

===Sex manuals===
{{Main|Sex manual}}
Sex manuals are among the oldest forms of erotic literature. Three brief fragments of a sex manual written in the fourth century BC that is attributed to [[Philaenis of Samos]] have survived, though modern scholars generally regard it as a work of parody probably written by a man, most likely the Athenian sophist [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plant|first1=Ian Michael|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3622-7|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsantsanoglou|first=K.|title=The Memoirs of a Lady from Samos|jstor=20180553|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|location=Bonn, Germany|publisher=Dr. Rudolf Habelt GmbH|year=1973|volume=12|pages=183–195|ref=harv}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the genre from the classical world include the lost works of [[Elephantis]]&lt;ref name=Plant&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plant|first1=Ian Michael|title=Women Writers of Ancient Greece and Rome: An Anthology|date=2004|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=0-8061-3622-7|page=118|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYGay_yqBLUC&amp;pg=PA45#v=onepage&amp;q=Elephantis&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]''. The Indian ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' is one of the world's best-known works of this type. The ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'', a 12th-century collection of Indian erotic works, is a lesser known one. Also very famous, and often reprinted and translated, is ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]'', a 16th-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] work by [[Sheikh Nefzaoui]].  There is anecdotal evidence that at least as late as the mid-20th century sex therapists and other physicians prescribed erotic literature as treatment for erectile dysfunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://buelahman.wordpress.com/2012/05/06/id-rather-use-a-cavalier-poet-than-a-blue-pill/ |title=I'd Rather Use a Cavalier Poet than a Blue Pill |publisher=Buelahman.wordpress.com |date=2012-05-09 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ancient Chinese versions of the sex manual include the texts that contain the [[Taoist sexual practices]]. These include books that show illustrations of the ideal sexual behavior because sex in this religion is not considered taboo but a manifestation of the concept of the [[yin and yang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Studies in Human Sexuality: A Selected Guide|last=Frayser|first=Suzanne|last2=Whitby|first2=Thomas|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|year=1995|isbn=1563081318|location=Englewood, Colorado|pages=646}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein the male and female engage in an act of "joining of energy" or "joining of essences".  The belief is that proper sexual practice is key to achieving good health. The manuals included the [[Ishinpō|Ishinpo]] text,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Science and Culture in Traditional Japan|last=Sugimoto|first=Masayoshi|last2=Swain|first2=David|publisher=Tuttle Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781462918133|location=Rutland, VT|pages=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a medical document that also included sections devoted to sexual hygiene and sexual manuals of the Tang and Han dynasties.

Not all sex manuals were produced to arouse or inform readers about sexual acts. There are also those created as a form of satire or social criticism. For instance, there is the case of mock-sex manual produced in the early sixteenth century by [[Pietro Aretino]] in response to the clerical censorship of the nude engravings of the Roman artists [[Marcantonio Raimondi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Impotency Poem from Ancient Latin to Restoration English Literature|last=Lavery|first=Hannah|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2014|isbn=9781472422026|location=Burlington, VT|pages=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was released in cheap wood, with a corresponding sonnet serving as the "voice" of the characters.

==Legal status==
{{Further|Obscenity}}

===Early legislation===

====To 1857====
[[File:Fanny Hill 1910 cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of an undated American edition of ''Fanny Hill'', c. 1910]]
Erotic or pornographic works have often been prosecuted, censored and destroyed by the authorities on grounds of obscenity.&lt;ref name="Hyde 1964; pp. 1-26"/&gt; In Medieval England, erotic or pornographic publications were the concern of the ecclesiastical courts. After the Reformation the jurisdiction of these courts declined in favour of the Crown which licensed every printed book. Prosecutions of books for their erotic content alone were rare and works which attacked the church or state gave much more concern to the authorities than erotica or '[[obscene libel]]' as it was then known. For instance the Licensing Act of 1662 was aimed generally at "heretical, seditious, schismatical or offensive books of pamphlets" rather than just erotica per se. Even this Licensing Act was allowed to lapse in 1695 and no attempt made to renew it.

The first conviction for [[obscenity]] in England occurred in 1727, when [[Edmund Curll]] was fined for the publication of ''[[Venus in the Cloister|Venus in the Cloister or The Nun in her Smock]]'' under the [[common law]] offence of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the]] [[Queen's peace|King's peace]]. This set a [[legal precedent]] for other convictions.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.eroticabibliophile.com/censorship_history.html The Obscenity of Censorship: A History of Indecent People and Lacivious Publications]," The Erotica Bibliophile. Retrieved 29 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of other books by Curll, however, considered seditious and blasphemous, such as ''The Memoirs of John Ker'', apparently most offended the authorities. Prosecutions of erotica later in the 18th century were rare and were most often taken because of the admixture of seditious and blasphemous material with the porn. For instance, no proceedings were taken against the publishers of Cleland's notorious ''Fanny Hill'' (1763).

====1857–1959====
[[File:NewYorkSocietyForTheSuppressionOfVice.jpg|thumb|Erotic literature going up in smoke and its distributors being put in jail, courtesy of Anthony Comstock's New York Society for the Suppression of Vice.]] It was the [[Obscene Publications Act 1857]] which made the sale of obscene material a statutory offence, for the first time, giving the courts power to seize and destroy offending material. The origins of the Act itself were in a trial for the sale of pornography presided over by the [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]], [[John Campbell, 1st Baron Campbell|Lord Campbell]], at the same time as a debate in the House of Lords over a bill aiming to restrict the sale of poisons. Campbell was taken by the analogy between the two situations, famously referring to the London pornography trade as "a sale of poison more deadly than prussic acid, strychnine or arsenic",&lt;ref&gt;Perhaps the earliest known appearance of this ever-popular analogy; compare "I would rather give a healthy boy or a healthy girl a phial of prussic acid than this novel," describing ''[[The Well of Loneliness]]'' in 1928&lt;/ref&gt; and proposed a bill to restrict the sale of pornography; giving statutory powers of destruction would allow for a much more effective degree of prosecution. The bill was controversial at the time, receiving strong opposition from both [[Houses of Parliament]], and was passed on the assurance by the Lord Chief Justice that it was "... intended to apply exclusively to works written for the single purpose of corrupting the morals of youth and of a nature calculated to shock the common feelings of decency in any well-regulated mind." The House of Commons successfully amended it so as not to apply to Scotland, on the grounds that Scottish common law was sufficiently stringent.

The Act provided for the seizure and destruction of any material deemed to be obscene, and held for sale or distribution, following information being laid before a "court of summary jurisdiction" ([[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' court]]). The Act required that following evidence of a common-law offence being committed - for example, on the report of a plain-clothes policeman who had successfully purchased the material - the court could issue a warrant for the premises to be searched and the material seized. The proprietor then would be called upon to attend court and give reason why the material should not be destroyed. Critically, the Act did not define "obscene," leaving this to the will of the courts.

Whilst the Act itself did not change, the scope of the work affected by it did. In 1868 [[Sir Alexander Cockburn, 12th Baronet|Sir Alexander Cockburn]], Campbell's successor as Lord Chief Justice, held in an appeal that the test of obscenity was "...whether the tendency of the matter charged as obscenity is to deprave and corrupt those whose minds are open to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this sort may fall." This was clearly a major change from Campbell's opinion only ten years before - the test now being the effect on someone open to corruption who obtained a copy, not whether the material was ''intended'' to corrupt or offend.

Cockburn's declaration remained in force for several decades, and most of the high profile seizures under the Act relied on this interpretation. Known as the [[Hicklin test]] no cognisance was taken of the literary merit of a book or on the extent of the offending text within the book in question. The widened scope of the original legislation led to the subsequent notorious targeting of now acknowledged classics of world literature by such authors as [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[James Joyce]] and [[D.H. Lawrence]] plus medical textbooks by such as [[Havelock Ellis]] rather than the blatant erotica which was the original target of this law.&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Pearl (1955) ''The Girl With the Swansdown Seat''; p. 270&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to England, where actions against obscene literature were the preserve of the magistrates, in America such actions were the responsibility of the Postal Inspection Service, embodied in the federal and state [[Comstock laws]], named after the postal officer and anti-obscenity crusader [[Anthony Comstock]] who proved himself officious in the work of suppression both in his official capacity and through his [[New York Society for the Suppression of Vice]].&lt;ref&gt;Hyde (1964); pp. 15-16&lt;/ref&gt;  The first such law was the Comstock Act, (ch. 258 {{USStat|17|598}} enacted March 3, 1873) which made it illegal to send any "obscene, lewd, and/or lascivious" materials through the mail. Twenty-four states passed similar prohibitions on materials distributed within the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Daniel J. Kevles | title = The Secret History of Birth Control | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2001-07-22 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E0DB173BF931A15754C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;pagewanted=print | accessdate =  2006-10-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern legislation===

This question of whether a book had literary merit eventually prompted a change in the law in both America and the UK. In the United Kingdom the [[Obscene Publications Act 1959]] provided for the protection of "literature" but conversely increased the penalties against pure "pornography." The law defined obscenity and separated it from serious works of art.

The new definition read:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]n article shall be deemed to be obscene if its effect or (where the article comprises two or more distinct items) the effect of any one of its items is, if taken as a whole, such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After this piece of legislation questions of the literary merit of the work in question were allowed to be put before the judge and jury as in the ''[[Lady Chatterley]]'' trial. The publishers of the latter book were found not guilty by the court on the grounds of the literary merit of the book. In later prosecutions of literary erotica under the provisions of the act, however, even purely pornographic works with no apparent literary merit escaped destruction by the authorities. Purely textual pornographic texts, with no hint of [[libel]], ceased to be brought to trial following the collapse of the ''Inside Linda Lovelace'' trial in 1976.  However, in October 2008, a man was unsuccessfully prosecuted under the Obscene Publications Act (the [[R v Walker]] trial) for posting fictional written material to the Internet allegedly describing the kidnap, rape and murder of the pop group [[Girls Aloud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Green |first=Chris |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/blogger-wrote-of-murdering-girls-aloud-949711.html |title=Blogger wrote of murdering Girls Aloud |publisher=Independent.co.uk |date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] gives protection to written fiction, although the legal presumption that it does not protect obscene literature has never been overcome. (Instead, pornography has successfully been defined legally as non-obscene, or "obscene" been shown to be so vague a term as to be unenforceable.) In 1998 [[State v. Dalton|Brian Dalton]] was charged with creation and possession of child pornography under an Ohio obscenity law. The stories were works of fiction concerning sexually abusing children which he wrote and kept, unpublished, in his private journal. He accepted a plea bargain, pleaded guilty and was convicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politechbot.com/p-02223.html | title=Ohio man convicted for "obscene" stories in his private journal | accessdate=2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, the conviction was [[Vacated_judgment|vacated]].

Importing books and texts across national borders can sometimes be subject to more stringent laws than in the nations concerned. Customs officers are often permitted to seize even merely 'indecent' works that would be perfectly legal to sell and possess once one is inside the nations concerned. [[Canada]] has been particularly notorious for such border seizures.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Although the 1857 and 1959 legislation outlawed the publication, retail and trafficking of certain writings and images, regarded as pornographic, and would order the destruction of shop and warehouse stock meant for sale, the private possession of and viewing of pornography has not been prosecuted until recent times.&lt;ref&gt;H. Montgomery Hyde ''A History of Pornography''. (1969) London, Heinemann: 14&lt;/ref&gt; In some nations, even purely textual erotic literature is still deemed illegal and is also prosecuted.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The '''flag of [[Samoa]]''' was first adopted from February 24, 1949 for [[United Nations Trust Territory|UN Trusteeships]], and continuously applied for the state's independence on January 1, 1962. It consists of a red field with a blue rectangle in the [[canton (heraldry)|canton]]. The blue rectangle bears the constellation [[Southern Cross]]: four large white stars and one smaller star.

=={{anchor|Historial flags}}Historical flags==
Prior to the [[First World War]], Samoa was a [[German colonial empire|colony]] of the [[German Empire]]. German colonies used the flag of the [[Imperial Colonial Office]], a black-white-red [[tricolour (flag)|tricolour]] defaced with the [[Reichsadler|Imperial Eagle]]. The Imperial German government intended to introduce specific flags for the colonies (also based on the tricolour) and several proposals were created, but the war and the subsequent loss of all overseas territories prevented their official adoption. [[New Zealand]] occupied [[German Samoa]] in 1914 and officially gained control of the territory in 1919.

From the capture by New Zealand forces on August 29, 1914, a defaced ensign with three palm trees encircled, and emblazoned on the fly were used. The defaced Blue Ensign was used by vessels owned by the mandate government, or those operated in the government service, while the defaced Red Ensign was used by locally registered civilian ships.

'''Genetically modified fish''' ('''GM fish''') are [[genetically modified organism|organisms]] from the taxonomic clade which includes the classes [[Agnatha]] (jawless fish), [[Chondrichthyes]] (cartilaginous fish) and [[Osteichthyes]] (bony fish) whose genetic material ([[DNA]]) has been altered using [[genetic engineering]] techniques.  In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new [[trait (biology)|trait]] to the fish which does not occur naturally in the species, i.e. [[transgenesis]].

GM fish are used in scientific research and kept as pets.  They are being developed as environmental pollutant sentinels and for use in aquaculture food production. In 2015, the [[AquAdvantage salmon]] was approved by the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) for commercial production, sale and consumption,&lt;ref name = FDA&gt;Staff (November 2015)[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/UCM473578.pdf FDA Has Determined That the AquAdvantage Salmon is as Safe to Eat as Non-GE Salmon] FDA Consumer Health Information / U.S. Food and Drug Administration / November 2015 / Retrieved 20 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; making it the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption. Some GM fish that have been created have promoters driving an over-production of "all fish" [[growth hormone]]. This results in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including [[salmonid]]s,&lt;ref name="nature fish"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1038/nbt0292-176 |last1=Jun Du |first1=Shao |author2=Zhiyuan Gong, Garth L.

Critics have objected to GM fish on several grounds, including ecological concerns, animal welfare concerns and with respect to whether using them as [[genetically modified food|food]] is safe and whether GM fish are needed to help address the world's food needs.

==History and process==
{{Main|Genetic engineering}}
The first transgenic fish were produced in China in 1985.&lt;ref name="Dunham" /&gt; As of 2013, approximately 50 species of fish have been subject to genetic modification.   This has resulted in more than 400 fish/trait combinations.  Most of the modifications have been conducted on food species, such as [[Atlantic salmon]] (''Salmo salar''), [[tilapia]] (genus) and [[common carp]] (''Cyprinus carpio'').&lt;ref name="Menozzi"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Menozzi, D., Mora, C. and Merigo, A.|year=2013|title=Genetically modified salmon for dinner? Transgenic salmon marketing scenarios|journal=AgBioForum|volume=15|issue=3|url=http://www.agbioforum.org/v15n3/v15n3a04-menozzi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, genetic modification entails manipulation of [[DNA]]. The process is known as [[cisgenesis]] when a [[gene]] is transferred between organisms that could be conventionally bred, or [[transgenesis]] when a gene from one species is added to a different species.  Gene transfer into the genome of the desired organism, as for fish in this case, requires a vector like a [[lentivirus]] or mechanical/physical insertion of the altered genes into the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] of the host by means of a micro syringe or a [[gene gun]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csiro.au/resources/WhatIsGM Csiro. Genetic modification] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020213624/http://www.csiro.au/resources/WhatIsGM |date=20 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Research===
[[File:2012 02 12 0022scolio.jpg|thumb|right|A zebrafish genetically modified to have long fins]]
Transgenic fish are used in research covering five broad areas&lt;ref name="Dunham" /&gt; - 
*Enhancing the traits of commercially available fish
*Their use as bioreactors for the development of bio-medically important proteins
*Their use as indicators of aquatic pollutants
*Developing new non-mammalian animal models
*Functional genomics studies

Most GM fish are used in basic research in genetics and development. Two species of fish, zebrafish and medaka, are most commonly modified because they have optically clear [[chorion]]s (shells), develop rapidly, the 1-cell embryo is easy to see and micro-inject with transgenic DNA, and zebrafish have the capability of regenerating their organ tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Hackett, P.B., Ekker, S.E. and Essner, J.J. (2004) Applications of transposable elements in fish for transgenesis and functional genomics. Fish Development and Genetics (Z. Gong and V. Korzh, eds.) World Scientific, Inc., Chapter 16, 532-580.&lt;/ref&gt; They are also used in [[drug discovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bowman TV, Zon LI | date = Feb 2010 | title = Swimming into the future of drug discovery: in vivo chemical screens in zebrafish | journal = ACS Chem Biol. | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 159–61 | doi = 10.1021/cb100029t | pmid = 20166761 | pmc=4712380}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GM zebrafish are being explored for benefits of unlocking human organ tissue diseases and failure mysteries. For instance, zebrafish are used to understand heart tissue repair and regeneration in efforts to study and discover cures for [[cardiovascular disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Major R, Poss K | year = 2007 | title = Zebrafish Heart Regeneration as a Model for Cardiac Tissue Repair | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2597874/pdf/nihms58902.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Drug Discov Today Dis Models | volume = 4 | issue = 4| pages = 219–225 | pmc=2597874 | pmid=19081827 | doi=10.1016/j.ddmod.2007.09.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transgenic [[rainbow trout]] (''Oncorhynchus mykiss'') have been developed to study muscle development.  The introduced transgene causes green fluorescence to appear in [[fast twitch muscle]] fibres early in development which persist throughout life.  It has been suggested the fish might be used as indicators of aquatic pollutants or other factors which influence development.&lt;ref name="Gabillard"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gabillard, J.C., Rallière, C., Sabin, N. and Rescan, P.Y.|year=2010|title=The production of fluorescent transgenic trout to study in vitro myogenic cell differentiation.|journal=BMC Biotechnology|volume=10|issue=1|pages=39|doi=10.1186/1472-6750-10-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In intensive fish farming, the fish are kept at high stocking densities.  This means they suffer from frequent transmission of contagious diseases, a problem which is being addressed by GM research.  [[Grass carp]] (''Ctenopharyngodon idella'') have been modified with a transgene coding for human [[lactoferrin]], which doubles their survival rate relative to control fish after exposure to ''[[Aeromonas]]'' bacteria and [[Grass carp hemorrhage virus]].  [[Cecropin]] has been used in channel catfish to enhance their protection against several pathogenic bacteria by 2–4 times.&lt;ref name="Forabosco" /&gt;

===Food===
One area of intensive research with GM fish has aimed to increase food production by modifying the expression of [[growth hormone]] (GH).  The relative increases in growth differ between species.&lt;ref name="Devlin2015" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;(Figure 1)&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See figures in [https://www.aquabounty.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Risk_Assessment_Mitigation_of_AAS-Oct2010.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt; They range from a doubling in weight, to some fish that are almost 100 times heavier than the wild-type at a comparable age.&lt;ref name="Forabosco"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Forabosco, F., Löhmus, M., Rydhmer, L. and Sundström, L.F.|year=2013|title=Genetically modified farm animals and fish in agriculture: A review|journal=Livestock Science|volume=153|issue=1|pages=1–9|doi=10.1016/j.livsci.2013.01.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This research area has resulted in dramatic growth enhancement in several species, including [[salmon]],&lt;ref name="nature salmon"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Jun Du Shao ''et al.'' | year = 1992 | title = Growth Enhancement in Transgenic Atlantic Salmon by the Use of an "All Fish" Chimeric Growth Hormone Gene Construct | url = http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v10/n2/abs/nbt0292-176.html | journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 176–181 | doi=10.1038/nbt0292-176}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[trout]]&lt;ref name="nature trout"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Devlin, R.H., Biagi,, C.A.,  Yesaki, T.Y., Smailus, D.E. and Byatt, J.C|title=Growth of domesticated transgenic fish|journal=Nature|volume=409|issue=6822|year=2001|pages=781–782|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6822/full/409781a0.html|pmid=11236982|doi=10.1038/35057314}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tilapia]].&lt;ref name=tilapia&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rahman MA ''et al.'' | year = 2001 | title = Growth and nutritional trials on transgenic Nile tilapia containing an exogenous fish growth hormone gene | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1095-8649.2001.tb02338.x/abstract | journal = Journal of Fish Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 62–78 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2001.tb02338.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other sources indicate an 11-fold and 30-fold increase in growth of salmon and [[mud loach]], respectively, compared to wild-type fish.&lt;ref name="Dunham" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aquabounty.com/products/aquadvantage-295.aspx |title=AquAdvantage® Fish |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=AquaBounty Technologies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328110726/http://www.aquabounty.com/products/aquadvantage-295.aspx |archive-date=2014-03-28 |dead-url=yes |access-date=2016-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Transgenic fish development has reached the stage where several species are ready to be marketed in different countries, for example, GM tilapia in Cuba, GM carp in the People’s Republic of China, and GM salmon in the USA and Canada.&lt;ref name="Kaiser"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kaiser, M.|year=2005|title=Assessing ethics and animal welfare in animal biotechnology for farm production.|journal=Revue Scientifique et Technique-Office International des Epizooties|volume=24|issue=1|pages=75–87|url=http://vet.hcmuaf.edu.vn/data/file/application%20of%20biotechnology%20of%20animal%20health%20and%20production%20/Assessing%20ethics%20and%20animal%20welfare%20in%20animal%20biotechnology%20for%20farm%20production.pdf|doi=10.20506/rst.24.1.1552}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, it was reported that applications for the approval of transgenic fish as food had been made in Canada, China, Cuba and the United States.&lt;ref name="Dunham" /&gt;

Over-production of GH from the [[pituitary]] gland increases growth rate mainly by an increase in food consumption by the fish, but also by a 10 to 15% increase in feed conversion efficiency.&lt;ref name="Sundstrom" /&gt;

Another approach to increasing meat production in GM fish is "[[double muscling]]".  This results in a phenotype similar to that of [[Belgian Blue]] cattle in rainbow trout.  It is achieved by using transgenes expressing [[follistatin]], which inhibits [[myostatin]], and the development of two muscle layers.&lt;ref name="Forabosco" /&gt;

====AquAdvantage salmon====
{{main|AquAdvantage salmon}}
In November 2015, the FDA of the USA approved the GM [[AquAdvantage]] salmon created by [[AquaBounty]] for commercial production, sale and consumption.&lt;ref name="FDA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Press Announcements - FDA takes several actions involving genetically engineered plants and animals for food|url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm473249.htm|website = www.fda.gov|accessdate = 2015-12-03|first = Office of the|last = Commissioner}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the first genetically modified animal to be approved for human consumption.  The fish is essentially an Atlantic salmon with a single gene complex inserted: a growth hormone regulating gene from a [[Chinook salmon]] with a promoter sequence from an [[ocean pout]].  This permits the GM salmon to produce GH year round rather than pausing for part of the year as do wild-type Atlantic salmon.&lt;ref name="USA Today" /&gt;  The wild-type salmon takes 24 to 30 months to reach market size (4–6&amp;nbsp;kg) whereas the producers of the GM salmon claim it requires only 18 months for the GM fish to achieve this.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite web|author=Firger, J.|publisher=CBS News|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/controversy-swims-around-genetically-modified-fish/|year=2014|title=Controversy swims around genetically modified fish|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fda.gov"&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/VeterinaryMedicineAdvisoryCommittee/UCM224760.pdf Environmental Assessment for AquAdvantage Salmon]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReutersNov19"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/11/20/us-aquabounty-technologies-fda-idUSKCN0T826T20151120#yDLkHQMESrDJvbit.97|author1=Steenhuysen, J.  |author2=Polansek, T.|title=U.S. clears genetically modified salmon for human consumption|publisher=Reuters|date=November 19, 2015|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  AquaBounty argue that their GM salmon can be grown nearer to end-markets with greater efficiency (they require 25% less feed to achieve market weight&lt;ref name="Milman" /&gt;) than the Atlantic salmon which are currently reared in remote coastal fish farms, thereby making it better for the environment, with recycled waste and lower transport costs.&lt;ref name="Connor" /&gt;

Several transgenic methods have been used to introduce target DNA into zebrafish for environmental monitoring, including [[micro-injection]], [[electroporation]], [[particle gun bombardment]], [[liposome-mediated gene transfer]], and [[sperm-mediated gene transfer]]. Micro-injection is the most commonly used method to produce transgenic zebrafish as this produces the highest survival rate.&lt;ref name="Dai"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dai, Y.J., Jia, Y.F., Chen, N., Bian, W.P., Li, Q.K., Ma, Y.B., ... &amp; Pei, D.S.|year=2014|title=Zebrafish as a model system to study toxicology|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|volume=33|issue=1|pages=11–17|pmid=24307630|doi=10.1002/etc.2406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
{{main|Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms}}

The regulation of genetic engineering concerns the approaches taken by governments to assess and manage the risks associated with the development and release of genetically modified crops. There are differences in the regulation of GMOs between countries, with some of the most marked differences occurring between the USA and Europe. Regulation varies in a given country depending on the intended use of the products of the genetic engineering. For example, a fish not intended for food use is generally not reviewed by authorities responsible for food safety.

The US FDA guidelines for evaluating transgenic animals define transgenic constructs as "drugs" regulated under the animal drug provisions of the Federal Food and Cosmetic Act.  This classification is important for several reasons, including that it places all GM food animal permits under the jurisdiction of the FDA’s Center for Veterinary Medicine (CVM) and imposes limits on what information the FDA can release to the public, and furthermore, it avoids a more open food safety review process.&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Bailey, C.|year=2015|title=Transgenic salmon: Science, politics, and flawed policy|journal=Society &amp; Natural Resources|volume=28|issue=11|pages=1249–1260|doi=10.1080/08941920.2015.1089610}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US states of Washington and Maine have imposed permanent bans on the production of transgenic fish.&lt;ref name="Bailey" /&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Main|Genetically modified food controversies}}

Critics have objected to use of genetic engineering per se on several grounds, including ethical concerns, ecological concerns (especially about [[gene flow]]), and economic concerns raised by the fact GM techniques and GM organisms are subject to intellectual property law.  GMOs also are involved in controversies over GM food with respect to whether using GM fish as safe is safe, whether it would exacerbate or cause fish allergies, whether it should be labeled, and whether GM fish and crops are needed to address the world's food needs. These controversies have led to litigation, international trade disputes, and protests, and to restrictive regulation of commercial products in most countries.

There is much doubt among the public about genetically modified animals in general.&lt;ref name="Broom2015"&gt;{{cite book|title=Domestic Animal Behaviour and Welfare|edition=5|author1=Broom, D.M.  |author2=Fraser, A.F.|year=2015|publisher=CABI|page=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the acceptance of GM fish by the general public is the lowest of all GM animals used for food and pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref name="Mora"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mora, C., Menozzi, D., Kleter, G., Aramyan, L.H., Valeeva, N. I. and Reddy, G.P.|year=2012|title=Factors affecting the adoption of genetically modified animals in the food and pharmaceutical chains|journal=Bio-based and Applied Economics|volume=1|issue=3|pages=313–329|url=http://www.fupress.net/index.php/bae/article/viewFile/11706/11801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethical concerns===
In transgenic fast-growing fish genetically modified for growth hormone, the mosaic founder fish vary greatly in their growth rate, reflecting the highly variable proportion and distribution of transgenic cells in their bodies. Fish with these high growth rates (and their progeny) sometimes develop a morphological abnormality similar to [[acromegaly]] in humans, exhibiting an enlarged head relative to the body and a bulging [[Operculum (fish)|operculum]]. This becomes progressively worse as the fish ages. It can interfere with feeding and may ultimately cause death. According to a study commissioned by [[Compassion in World Farming]], the abnormalities are probably a direct consequence of growth hormone over-expression and have been reported in GM coho salmon, rainbow trout, common carp, channel catfish and loach, but to a lesser extent in Nile tilapia.&lt;ref name="Kirkden"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Kirkden, R.  |author2=Broom, D.M.|year=2012|title=Welfare of genetically modified and cloned animals used for food|url=http://staging.ciwf.com/media/1253633/welfare_of_genetically_modified_and_cloned_animals_used_in_food.pdf|accessdate=November 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=December 2015}}

In GM coho salmon (''Oncorhynchus kisutch'') there are morphological changes and changed [[allometry]] that lead to reduced swimming abilities. They also exhibit abnormal behaviour such as increased levels of activity with respect to feed-intake and swimming.&lt;ref name="Kaiser" /&gt;  Several other transgenic fish show decreased swimming ability, likely due to body shape and muscle structure.&lt;ref name="Sundstrom" /&gt;

Genetically modified triploid fish are more susceptible to temperature stress, have a higher incidence of deformities
(e.g. abnormalities in the eye and lower jaw&lt;ref name="Benfey"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benfey, T.J.|year=2001|title=Use of sterile triploid Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) for aquaculture in New Brunswick, Canada|journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science|volume=58|issue=2|pages=525–529|doi=10.1006/jmsc.2000.1019}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and are less aggressive than diploids.&lt;ref name="Fraser"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fraser, T.W., Fjelldal, P.G., Hansen, T. and Mayer, I.|year=2012|title=Welfare considerations of triploid fish|journal=Reviews in Fisheries Science|volume=20|issue=4|pages=192–211|doi=10.1080/10641262.2012.704598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Piferrer"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Piferrer, F., Beaumont, A., Falguière, J.

A. and Devlin, R.H.|year=2007|title=Genetically enhanced growth causes increased mortality in hypoxic environments|journal=Biology Letters|volume=3|issue=2|pages=165–168|pmid=17272234|pmc=2375932|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2006.0598}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been suggested the increased sensitivity to hypoxia is caused by the insertion of the extra set of chromosomes requiring a larger nucleus which thereby causes a larger cell overall and a reduction in the surface area to volume ratio of the cell.

===Ecological concerns===
[[File:Aquakultur-Vestmanna.jpg|thumb|right|An aquaculture enterprise]]
Transgenic fish are usually developed in strains of near-wild origin.  These have an excellent capacity for interbreeding with themselves or wild relatives and therefore possess a significant possibility for establishing themselves in nature should they escape biotic or abiotic containment measures.&lt;ref name="Devlin2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Devlin, R.H., Sundström, L.F. and Leggatt, R.A.|year=2015|title=Assessing ecological and evolutionary consequences of growth-accelerated genetically engineered fishes|journal=BioScience|volume=65|issue=7|pages=685–700|url=https://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/65/7/685.full|doi=10.1093/biosci/biv068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide range of concerns about the consequences of genetically modified fish escaping have been expressed.  For polyploids, these include the degree of sterility, interference with spawning, competing with resources without contributing to subsequent generations.  For transgenics, the concerns include characteristics of the genotype, the function of the gene, the type of the gene, potential for causing [[pleiotropic]] effects, potential for interacting with the remainder of the genome, stability of the construct, ability of the [[DNA construct]] to [[Transposition (horizontal gene transfer)|transpose]] within or between genomes.&lt;ref name="Devlin1992"&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Chapter 13 - Containment of genetically altered fish|title=Transgenic Fish|editor1=C.L. Hew |editor2=G.L. Fletcher |author1=Devlin, R.H.  |author2=Donaldson, E.M.|publisher=World Scientific|year=1992|pages=229–266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study, using relevant life history data from the Japanese medaka (''[[Oryzias latipes]]'') predicts that a transgene introduced into a natural population by a small number of transgenic fish will spread as a result of enhanced mating advantage, but the reduced viability of offspring will cause eventual local extinction of both populations.&lt;ref name="Muir"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Muir, W.M.  |author2=Howard, R.D.|year=1999|title=Possible ecological risks of transgenic organism release when transgenes affect mating success: Sexual selection and the Trojan gene hypothesis|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=96|issue=24|pages=13853–13856|pmid=10570162|doi=10.1073/pnas.96.24.13853|pmc=24154}}&lt;/ref&gt; GM coho salmon show greater risk-taking behaviour and better use of limited food than wild-type fish.
  
Transgenic coho salmon have enhanced feeding capacity and growth, which can result in a considerably larger body size (&gt;7-fold) compared to non-transgenic salmon. When transgenic and non-transgenic salmon in the same enclosure compete for different levels of food, transgenic individuals consistently outgrow non-transgenic individuals. When food abundance is low, dominant individuals emerge, invariably transgenic, that show strong agonistic and cannibalistic behavior to cohorts and dominate the acquisition of limited food resources. When food availability is low, all groups containing transgenic salmon experience population crashes or complete extinctions, whereas groups containing only non-transgenic salmon have good (72%) survival rates.&lt;ref name="Devlin2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Devlin, R.H., D'Andrade, M., Uh, M. and Biagi, C.A.|year=2004|title=Population effects of growth hormone transgenic coho salmon depend on food availability and genotype by environment interactions|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=101|issue=25|pages=9303–9308|pmid=15192145|pmc=438972|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400023101}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led to the suggestion that these GM fish will survive better than the wild-type when conditions are very poor.&lt;ref name="Sundstrom"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sundström, L.F., Leggatt, R.A. and Devlin, R.H.|year=2015|chapter=Chapter 13, Growth-enhanced transgenic salmon|title=Evolutionary Biology of the Atlantic Salmon|pages=261–272|publisher=CRC Press|editor=Vladic, T. and Petersson, E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Benessia"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Benessia, A.  |author2=Barbiero, G.|year=2015|title=The impact of genetically modified salmon: from risk assessment to quality evaluation|journal=Visions for Sustainability|volume=3|pages=35–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Successful artificial transgenic hybridization between two species of loach (genus ''Misgurnus'') has been reported, yet these species are not known to hybridize naturally.&lt;ref name="Oke"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Oke, K.B., Westley, P.A., Moreau, D.T. and Fleming, I.A.|year=2013|title=Hybridization between genetically modified Atlantic salmon and wild brown trout reveals novel ecological interactions|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=280|issue=1763|pages=20131047|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/280/1763/20131047.short|doi=10.1098/rspb.2013.1047|pmc=3774243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GloFish were not considered as an environmental threat because they were less [[Fitness (biology)|fit]] than normal zebrafish which are unable to establish themselves in the wild in the US.&lt;ref name="Dunham" /&gt;

====AquAdvantage salmon====
The FDA has said the AquAdvantage Salmon can be safely contained in land-based tanks with little risk of escape into the wild,&lt;ref name="Connor" /&gt; however, Joe Perry, former chair of the GM panel of the [[European Food Safety Authority]], has been quoted as saying “There remain legitimate ecological concerns over the possible consequences if these GM salmon escape to the wild and reproduce, despite FDA assurances over containment and sterility, neither of which can be guaranteed”.&lt;ref name="Connor" /&gt;

AquaBounty indicates their GM salmon can not interbreed with wild fish because they are triploid which makes them [[sterility (physiology)|sterile]].&lt;ref name="fda.gov"/&gt;  The possibility of fertile triploids is one of the major short-falls of triploidy being used as a means of bio-containment for transgenic fish.&lt;ref name="Mair"&gt;{{cite book|page=227|year=2007|publisher=CABI|title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Genetically Modified Organisms.

The GH transgene can be transmitted via hybridization of GM AquAdvantage Salmon and the closely related wild [[brown trout]] (''Salmo trutta''). Transgenic hybrids are viable and grow more rapidly than transgenic salmon and other wild-type crosses in conditions emulating a hatchery.

An article in Slate Magazine in December 2012 by [[Jon Entine]], Director of the [[Genetic Literacy Project]], criticized the Obama Administration for preventing the publication of the environmental assessment (EA) of the AquAdvantage Salmon, which was completed in April 2012 and which concluded that "the salmon is safe to eat and poses no serious environmental hazards."&lt;ref name=slate&gt;Jon Entine for Slate Magazine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2048">The '''Globe of Matelica''' (Globo of Matelica) is an ancient Roman [[sundial]] sculpted on a marble ball. The artifact was found during the 1985 reconstruction of the medieval Palazzo Pretorio, presently Museo Civico Archeologico, of [[Matelica]] in the region of [[Marche]], Italy.

==Description==
The globe measures nearly 29&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter an appears to be sculpted from a cristalline marble originating near [[Ephesus]] in present-day Turkey. It is thought to date from the first two centuries CE. There is one similar item, identified in 1939 by [[Carl William Blegen]] in a Museum in [[Nafplio]], Greece.

All that remains is the stone component, it is engraved with a variety or lines and letter sare inscribed. The sphere is bisected by a center line while on its top are three concentric circles of various diameters, intersected by an arc of a circle and on which words in ancient Greek alphabet are still visible, and 13 holes, each marked by a Greek letter. In these holes were probably metallic insertions that delineated the hour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqui.it/archeoastronomia/globo.htm Description of Astronomical calculus of globe], by  Andrea Carusi and Danilo Baldini, from l'Astronomia n. 92 (October 1989) pp. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the lower part there is a large conical depression which ends with a big rectangular hole maybe made to secure the base. Other theories for the sphere are that it was used for astronomical calculations, thus as an [[armillary sphere]] or for use in [[spherical astronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turismo.marche.it/Turismi/Cultura-The-genius-of-Marche/The-best-of/Title/Globo-di-Matelica/IdPOI/3677/C2/31/T/16?page=1 Tourism Office of the Region of Marche], entry on globe.&lt;/ref&gt;

This page describes the modern idea of the Abrahamic God, Yahweh is the ancient idea of the Abrahamic god, and should not be referenced here since this page's subject is God's modern worship, not ancient worship.--&gt;
{{God}}
[[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]] are sometimes called [[Abrahamic religions]] because they all accept the tradition of a god, [[Yahweh]], that [[Revelation|revealed himself]] to the prophet [[Abraham]]. The theological traditions of all Abrahamic religions are thus to some extent influenced by the depiction of the God of Israel in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the historical development of [[monotheism]] in the [[history of Judaism]].

The Abrahamic God in this sense is the [[conception of God]] that remains a common attribute of all three traditions. God is conceived of as [[Eternity#God and eternity|eternal]], [[omnipotent]], [[omniscient]] and as the [[Creator deity|creator of the universe]]. God is further held to have the properties of holiness, justice, [[Omnibenevolence|omni-benevolence]] and [[omnipresence]]. Proponents of Abrahamic faiths believe that God is also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], meaning that he is outside space and outside time and therefore [[Incorporeality|not subject to anything within his creation]], but at the same time a [[personal God]], involved, listening to [[prayer]] and reacting to the actions of his creatures.

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main|God in the Bahá'í Faith}}

The [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]] writings describe a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]], personal, inaccessible, omniscient, omnipresent, imperishable, and almighty God who is the creator of all things in the universe.&lt;ref name="Psmith106"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-86251-5 | pages = 106}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BFaith-74"&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Hatcher | year = 1985 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = San Francisco | isbn = 0-06-065441-4 | pages = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[existence of God]] and the [[universe]] is thought to be eternal, without a beginning or end.&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Britannica|year = 1992 |contribution=The Bahá'í Faith |title = Britannica Book of the Year |isbn=0-85229-486-7 |editor1=Daphne Daume |editor2=Louise Watson |publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica |location = Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though transcendent and inaccessible directly, God is nevertheless seen as conscious of creation, with a will and purpose that is expressed through messengers termed [[Manifestations of God]].&lt;ref name="Psmith106"/&gt; The purpose of creation is for the created to have the capacity to know and love its creator,&lt;ref name="Psmith111"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-86251-5 | pages = 111}}&lt;/ref&gt;  through such methods as [[Prayer in the Bahá'í Faith|prayer]], [[Introspection|reflection]], and being of service to humankind.&lt;ref name="hatcher_huri"&gt;{{Cite book |last = Hatcher  |first = John S. |year = 2005 |title = Unveiling the Hurí of Love |periodical = Journal of Bahá'í Studies |volume = 15 |issue = 1 |pages = 1–38 | ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; God communicates his will and purpose to humanity through intermediaries, known as [[Manifestations of God]], who are the prophets and messengers who have founded religions from prehistoric times up to the present day.&lt;ref name="Psmith107-108"&gt;{{cite book | last = Smith | first = Peter | year = 2008 | title = An Introduction to the Baha'i Faith | publisher = Cambridge University Press | place = Cambridge | isbn=0-521-86251-5  |pages = 107–108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Manifestations of God reflect divine attributes, which are creations of God made for the purpose of spiritual enlightenment, onto the physical plane of existence.&lt;ref name="BFaith-123-126"&gt;{{cite book | first = William | last = Hatcher | year = 1985 | title = The Bahá'í Faith | publisher = Harper &amp; Row | location = San Francisco | isbn = 0-06-065441-4 | ref=harv | pages = 123–126}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Bahá'í view, all physical beings reflect at least one of these attributes, and the human [[soul]] can potentially reflect all of them.&lt;ref name="GH"&gt;{{cite book |last=Saiedi | first= Nader |year=2008 |title=Gate of the Heart |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, Ontario, Canada |isbn=978-1-55458-035-4  |ref=harv | pages = 163–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bahá'í view rejects all [[pantheistic]], [[anthropomorphic]], and incarnationist beliefs in God.&lt;ref name="Psmith106"/&gt;

==Christianity==
{{Main|God the Son|God in Christianity}}
[[Christianity]] [[Judeo-Christian|originated]] within the realm of [[Second Temple Judaism]] and thus shares most of its beliefs about God, including his [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], his role as creator of all things, his personality, [[Immanence]], [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] and ultimate unity and supremacy, with the innovation that [[Jesus of Nazareth]] is considered to be in one way or another, the fulfillment of ancient prophecy or the [[Supersessionism|completion of the Law of the prophets of Israel]].

Most [[Christian denominations]] believe Jesus to be the [[incarnation]] of God as a human being, which is the main theological [[Christianity and Judaism|divergence]] with respect to Judaism and Islam. Although personal [[salvation]] is implicitly stated in Judaism, personal salvation by grace and a recurring emphasis in [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] is particularly emphasized in Christianity, often contrasting this with a perceived [[Legalism (theology)|over-emphasis in law observance]] as stated in canon Jewish law, where it is contended that a belief in an intermediary between man and God is against the [[Noahide laws]], and thus [[Shituf|not monotheistic]].

For most Christians, beliefs about God are enshrined in the doctrine of [[Trinitarianism]], which holds that the three persons of the trinity are distinct but all of the same indivisible essence, meaning that the Father is God, the Holy spirit is God and the Son is God yet there is one God as there is one indivisible essence. The doctrines were largely formalized at the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] and are enshrined in the [[Nicene Creed|Nicene creed]].
The Trinitarian view emphasizes that [[Will of God|God has a will]], and that [[God the Son]] has two wills, divine and human, though these are never in conflict but joined in the [[hypostatic union]]. 

A small minority of Christians, largely coming under the heading of [[Unitarianism]], hold [[Nontrinitarianism|non-trinitarian]] views.

===Mormonism===
{{Main|God in Mormonism}}
In the Mormonism represented by most of Mormon communities (including [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]), ''God'' means [[Elohim]] (the Father), whereas ''Godhead'' means a council of three distinct gods; Elohim, [[Jehovah]] (the Son, or Jesus), and the [[Holy Spirit]]. The Father and Son have perfected, material bodies, while the Holy Spirit is a spirit and does not have a body. This conception differs from the traditional Christian [[Trinity]]; in Mormonism, the three persons are considered to be physically separate beings, or personages, but united in will and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;The term with its distinctive Mormon usage first appeared in ''[[Lectures on Faith]] (published 1834), Lecture 5 ("We shall in this lecture speak of the Godhead; we mean the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit."). The term "Godhead" also appears several times in Lecture 2 in its sense as used in the [[Authorized King James Version]] as meaning divinity.''&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the term ''[[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]]'' differs from how it is used in traditional Christianity. This description of God represents the [[orthodoxy]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), established early in the 19th century.

==Islam==
{{Allah |related}}
{{main|Allah|God in Islam}}
In Islam, God is believed to be the only real supreme being, all-powerful and all-knowing creator, sustainer, ordainer, and judge of the universe.&lt;ref name="EoQ-Quran"&gt;Gerhard Böwering, ''God and his Attributes'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="esp22"&gt;John L. Esposito, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Islam puts a heavy emphasis on the conceptualization of God as strictly singular (''[[tawhid]]'').&lt;ref&gt;John L. Esposito, ''Islam: The Straight Path'', Oxford University Press, 1998, p.88&lt;/ref&gt; He is unique (''wahid'') and inherently one (''ahad''), all-merciful and omnipotent.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"Allah." [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Qur'an]] there are [[99 Names of God]] (''al-asma al-husna'' lit. meaning: "The best names") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of God.&lt;ref name="Ben"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bentley |first1=David |title=The 99 Beautiful Names for God for All the People of the Book |publisher=William Carey Library |date=September 1999 |isbn=0-87808-299-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMMENA"&gt;Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, ''Allah''&lt;/ref&gt; All these names refer to [[Allah]], the supreme and all-comprehensive divine Arabic name.&lt;ref name="Tao-Islam"&gt;Annemarie Schimmel,''The Tao of Islam: A Sourcebook on Gender Relationships in Islamic'', SUNY Press, p.206&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are "the Most Gracious" (''al-rahim'') and "the Most Merciful" (''al-rahman'').&lt;ref name="Ben"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EncMMENA"/&gt;

Creation and ordering of the universe is seen as an act of prime mercy for which all creatures sing his glories and bear witness to his unity and lordship. According to the Qur'an, "No vision can grasp Him, but His grasp is over all vision. He is above all comprehension, yet is acquainted with all things" (Qur'an 6:103).&lt;ref name="esp22"/&gt;

God in Islam is not only majestic and sovereign, but also a personal god. According to the Qur'an, he is nearer to a person than that person's [[jugular vein]]. He responds to those in need or distress whenever they call him. Above all, he guides humanity to the right way, the "straight path".&lt;ref name="Britannica p3"&gt;Britannica Encyclopedia, ''Islam'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam teaches that God is the same god worshipped by the members of other [[Abrahamic religion]]s such as [[Christianity]] and [[Judaism]] ({{cite quran|29|46|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="Peters1"&gt;F.E. Peters, ''Islam'', p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;  This is [[Christianity and Islam|not universally accepted]] by non-Muslims, as Islam denies the divinity of Jesus Christ as a son of God, Islam views that God does not have any offspring or descendants, he created all things including prophets such as Jesus Christ. Most Muslims today believe that the religion of Abraham (which now split into Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) are of one source, which is The Almighty God.

==Judaism==
{{Main|Tetragrammaton|God in Judaism}}
Judaism, the oldest Abrahamic religion, is based on a strict [[monotheism]], finding its origins in the sole veneration of the ancient predecessor to the Abrahamic God, [[Yahweh]].&lt;ref group="n"&gt;While Yahweh is indeed the Abrahamic God, this specifically refers to the ancient ideas Yahweh once encompassed, such as living on mountains or controlling the weather. Thus, in this page's context, "Yahweh" is used to refer to the ancient idea of the Abrahamic God, and should not be referenced when describing His modern worship in today's Abrahamic religions.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of God as a [[Dualistic cosmology|duality]] or [[trinity]] is heretical in Judaism - it is considered akin to [[polytheism]]. "[God], the Cause of all, is one. This does not mean one as in one of series, nor one like a species (which encompasses many individuals), nor one as in an object that is made up of many elements, nor as a single simple object that is infinitely divisible. Rather, God is a unity unlike any other possible unity". This is referred to in the [[Torah]]: "Hear Israel, the Lord is our God, the Lord is One".{{Bibleref2c|Deut.|6:4}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]], [[Maimonides#The 13 principles of faith|13 principles of faith]], Second Principle&lt;/ref&gt;

God is conceived of as eternal, the creator of the universe, and the source of morality. God has the power to intervene in the world. The term God thus corresponds to an actual ontological reality, and is not merely a projection of the human psyche. [[Maimonides]] describes God in this fashion: "The foundation of all foundations and the pillar of wisdom is to know that there is a Primary Being who brought into being all existence. All the beings of the heavens, the earth, and what is between them came into existence only from the truth of His being."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishneh Torah]], book HaMadda', section Yesodei ha-Torah, chapter 1:1 ([http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/6756/jewish/Perek-1.htm original Hebrew]/[http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/904960/jewish/Chapter-One.htm English translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"The language of poetry should be like brocade and the feeling deeper than the ocean."'' -from Michitoshi's Preface {{ref|pg266}}

The {{nihongo|'''''Goshūi Wakashū'''''|後拾遺和歌集|Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems}}, sometimes abbreviated as '''''Goshūishū''''', is an [[imperial anthology]] of [[Japanese poetry|Japanese]] [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] compiled in 1086 at the behest of [[Emperor Shirakawa]] (who had ordered it begun in 1075). It was compiled by the conservative [[Fujiwara no Michitoshi]] (1047-1099), who wrote its preface. It consists of twenty volumes containing 1,220 poems. It is noted for a comparatively large contingent of poems written by women.

Its name "Later Collection" comes from the fact that it succeeds the ''[[Shūi Wakashū]]'' ("Collection of Gleanings").

[[File:JENNY LIND HUMBUG.jpg|thumb|An 1850 cartoon of [[Jenny Lind]] outside [[P. T. Barnum]]'s New American Museum, New York City, 1850, captioned as a "Panorama of Humbug"]]
[[File:Magic vs Science.jpg|thumb|''Humbugging, or raising the Devil'', 1800. [[Thomas Rowlandson|Rowlandson]]’s humbugging depicts the public as a credulous simpleton being distracted by a display of “the miraculous”, the better to have his pockets picked.]]
A '''humbug''' is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a [[hoax]] or in jest.&lt;ref name=Webster&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/humbug|publisher=Merriam-Webster|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins|title=Definition of Humbug|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/humbug|publisher=Collin's Dictionary|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first described in 1751 as student [[slang]], and recorded in 1840 as a "nautical phrase".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Two Years Before the Mast | author=Dana, Richard Henry Jr. | authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. | year=1840|quote=When there is danger or necessity, or when he is well used, no one can work faster than he; but the instant he feels that he is kept at work for nothing, or, as the nautical phrase is, 'humbugged,' no sloth could make less headway.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now also often used as an exclamation to mean [[nonsense]] or [[gibberish]].

When referring to a person, a humbug means a [[fraud]] or [[impostor]], implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], created by [[Charles Dickens]] in his novella ''[[A Christmas Carol]]''. His famous reference to [[Christmas]], '''"Bah! Humbug!"''', declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and television versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees.

Another use of the word was by [[John Collins Warren]], a [[Harvard Medical School]] professor who worked at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of [[ether]] anesthesia, administered by [[William Thomas Green Morton]], a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, "Gentlemen, this is no humbug."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bennett |first=William |title=The Genealogy of Mass General |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/content/genealogy-mass-general?page=5 |journal=American Heritage Magazine |volume=35 |issue=6 |year=1984 |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==

The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book ''The Student'' (1750–1751), ii. 41, where it is called "a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's ''The Universal Jester'', subtitled "a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs" from 1754; as mentioned in ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' from 1911, which further refers to the ''New English Dictionary''.&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Humbug |volume=13 |page=876}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven:
* [[Charles Godfrey Leland]] mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the [[Old Norse|Norse]] word ''hum'', meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word ''bugges'' (used in the Bible), a variant of ''bogey'', meaning 'apparitions'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Godfrey Leland]], ''Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling'' [1891], Chapter X [http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gsft/gsft12.htm of ''The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs'']&lt;/ref&gt; The Norse word ''hum'' mentioned, or ''hume'', actually means 'dark air' in [[Old Norwegian]]. From the other [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]] based on Old Norse, there is ''húm'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] which means 'twilight', ''hómi'' in [[Faeroese language|Faeroese]] which means 'unclear', and ''humi'' in Old [[Swedish language|Swedish]] which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hum|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this word is also derived the Swedish verb ''hymla'', still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=hymla|title='Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Hymla|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to the ''Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' by [[Francis Grose]], 1731–1791, ''to hum'' in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext04/dcvgr10.txt |title=Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with ''bugges'' from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word ''bug'' is derived from the [[Middle English]] ''Bugge'' (of which the term ''[[Bogeyman|bogey]]'' is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word ''bögge'' (of which ''böggel-mann'' (''"Goblin"'') is derived)&lt;ref name=etym/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Middle English Dictionary'' by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, University of Michigan Press, 1958, {{ISBN|978-0-472-01025-7}}, page 1212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary'', 11th edition, Merriam-Webster, 2003, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-809-5}}, page 162&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly the Norwegian dialect word ''bugge'' meaning "important man".&lt;ref name=merriamwebster&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'', Merriam-Webster, 1991, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-603-9}}, page 71&lt;/ref&gt; The Welsh ''bwg'' (''"ghost"'') could also be connected,&lt;ref name=etym&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=bug |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was thought in the past to be the origin of the English term however more recent studies indicate that it is a borrowing from the much older Middle English word.&lt;ref&gt;''Metatony in Baltic, Volume 6 of Leiden studies in Indo-European'' by Rick Derksen, Rodopi, 1996, {{ISBN|90-5183-990-1}}, {{ISBN|978-90-5183-990-6}}, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog   : English bogey from a Slavonic root?'', Brian Cooper 1, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Correspondence to Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DA&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Early Modern Northern English Lexis: A Literary Corpus-Based Study'', Javier Ruano-Garcia, Peter Lang, 2010, {{ISBN|3-0343-0058-1}}, {{ISBN|978-3-0343-0058-2}}. pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Studies in folk life'', John Geraint Jenkins, Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate, Ayer Publishing, 1977,{{ISBN|0-405-10102-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-405-10102-1}}. p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; Also, with ''bug'' meaning ghost or goblin, the use of the term applies in Dickens' novel about the Christmas ghosts. In ''Etym. Diet.'' of 1898, [[Walter Skeat]] also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where ''hum'' meant to murmur applause, and ''bug'' being a spectre.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* It could also come from the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''uomo bugiardo'', which literally means 'lying man'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.factmonster.com/dictionary/brewers/humbug.html |title=Factmonster |publisher=Factmonster |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug').
* ''Uim-bog'' is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in [[Irish language|Irish]], worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;
* The 1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'' also suggests that it is a form of "[[Hamburg]]",&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print.
* A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug—''i.e.'' something small and inconsequential, such as a [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]], that makes a lot of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.word-detective.com/012504.html#humbug |title=word-detective |publisher=word-detective |date=2004-01-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Norton Juster]]'s novel ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything.

The word has been used outside of anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Horst Conrad |url=http://www.etymologie.info/~e/u_/us-ismen_.html |title=etymologie.info |publisher=Etymologie.info |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Sweden since at least 1862,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saob.se/artikel/?seek=humbug|title=Svenska Akademiens ordbok s.v. Humbug|last=|first=|date=|website=www.saob.se|publisher=|accessdate=2016-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; in France since at least 1875,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.littre.org/definition/humbug |title=Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise, Littré 1872-1877 |publisher=www.littre.org |date= |accessdate=2013-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Hungary, and in Finland.

{{IPA_notice}}
'''''Joual''''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒwal}}) is the common name for the linguistic features of [[basilectal]] [[Quebec French]] that are associated with the French-speaking [[working class]] in [[Montreal]] which has become a symbol of national identity for a large number of artists from that area. Speakers of Quebec French from outside Montreal usually have other names to identify their speech, such as [[Magoua]] in [[Trois-Rivières]], and [[Chaouin]] south of Trois-Rivières. Linguists tend to eschew this term, but historically some have reserved the term ''joual'' for the variant of Quebec French spoken in Montreal.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Lefebvre, «Faut-il miser sur le joual?» ''Le Devoir'' 1965, 30 octobre; «L'étude de la culture: la linguistique.» ''Recherche sociographiques'' 3:1–2.233–249, 1962; Henri Wittmann, 1973. «Le joual, c'est-tu un créole?» La Linguistique 1973, 9:2.83–93.[http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1973a-joual.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most regional and class variants of a widely spoken language, ''joual'' is [[Social stigma|stigmatized]] by some and celebrated by others. While ''joual'' is often considered a [[sociolect]] of the Québécois working class, that perception is outdated.  Both the upward socio-economic mobility among the Québécois, and a cultural renaissance around ''joual'' connected to the [[Quiet Revolution]] in the Montreal East-End have resulted in ''joual'' being spoken by people across the educational and economic spectrum.  &lt;!--At the beginning of the 20th century, ''joual'' was at best a kind of [[Creole language|Creole]] that also fitted the description of a [[Register (sociolinguistics)#Diatype|diatype]] more than any other categorization. (At best? what does that mean?)--&gt;Today, many Québécois who were raised in Quebec during the 20th century (command of English notwithstanding) can understand and speak at least some ''joual''.

== Today ==
The language levels of the population are diverse today, particularly following the adoption of [[Bill 101]]. However, slang and other basilectal varieties of Quebec French are still very present in Quebec culture. This phenomenon occurs through music, storytelling, television, radio, in movies and in conversations.

== Origin of the name ''joual'' ==
Although coinage of the name ''joual'' is often attributed to [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] journalist [[André Laurendeau]], usage of this term throughout French-speaking Canada predates the 1930s.{{Citation needed|reason=no source|date=April 2013}}

The actual word ''joual'' is the representation of how the word ''cheval'' ([[Standard French]]: {{IPA-fr|ʃəval|}}, ''horse'') is pronounced by those who speak ''joual''. &lt;!--''Cheval'' is usually pronounced as one syllable, {{IPA|[ʃval]}}, by all francophones in the [[Francophonie]].--&gt; The weak [[schwa]] vowel {{IPA|[ə]}} disappeared. Then the [[Voiceless postalveolar fricative|voiceless]] {{IPA|[ʃ]}} was [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] to {{IPAblink|ʒ}}, thereby creating {{IPA|[ʒval]}}. Next, the {{IPA|[v]}} at the beginning of a syllable in some regional dialects of French or even in very rapid speech in general weakens to become the [[semi-vowel]] {{IPA|[w]}} written {{angbr|ou}}. The end result is the word {{IPA|[ʒwal]}} transcribed as ''joual''.{{Citation needed|reason=there is no evidence of this|date=April 2013}}

==Most notable or stereotypical linguistic features==

[[Diphthongs]] are normally present where [[long vowels]] would be present in standard French. There is also "sontaient, sonté" ("ils étaient, ils ont été").

Although ''moé''  and ''toé''  are today considered substandard slang pronunciations of ''toi'' and ''moi'', these were the pronunciations of ''[[ancien régime]]'' French used in all provinces of Northern France—by the royalty, aristocracy and common people.  After the 1789 [[French Revolution]], the standard pronunciation in France changed to that of a previously-stigmatized form in the speech of Paris, but [[Quebec]] French continued to evolve from the historically older dialects, having become isolated from France following the 1760 [[Quebec#New France|British conquest of New France]].&lt;ref&gt;Marc Picard, "La diphtongue /wa/ et ses équivalents en français du Canada." ''Cahiers de linguistique de l'Université du Québec'' 1974, 4.147–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Joual'' shares many features with modern [[Oïl languages]], such as [[Norman language|Norman]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Picard language|Picard]], [[Poitevin (language)|Poitevin]] and [[Saintongeais]] though its affinities are greatest with the 17th century [[Koiné language|koiné]] of [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Wittmann, "Le français de Paris dans le français des Amériques." ''Proceedings of the International Congress of Linguists'' 16.0416 (Paris, 20–25 juillet 1997). Oxford: Pergamon (CD edition). [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1998a-fpparis.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers of these [[languages of France]] predominated among settlers to [[New France]]. Their usage varies.
 
It could easily be argued that at least some aspects of more modern ''joual'' are further [[linguistic contractions]] of standard French. D'la, for instance (de la), whereas the word de has nearly fallen out of usage over time and has become contracted. This argument does apply to other words and this concept permeates universally throughout the French language.

Another outstanding characteristic of ''Joual'' is the use of profanity called [[Quebec French profanity|sacre]] in everyday speech.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Charest, ''Le livre des sacres et blasphèmes québécois.'' Montréal: L"Aurore, 1974; Jean-Pierre Pichette, ''Le guide raisonné des jurons.'' Montréal: Les Quinze, 1980; Diane Vincent, ''Pressions et impressions sur les sacres au Québec.'' Québec: Office de la langue française, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

===English loanwords (Anglicisms)===
*{{main|List of French words of English origin}}
There are a number of English [[loanword]]s in ''joual'', although they have been stigmatized since the 1960s:&lt;ref&gt;The standard reference to this subject is Gilles Colpron, ''Les anglicismes au Québec: Répertoire classifié. Montréal: Beauchemin.&lt;/ref&gt; Their usage varies both regionally and historically.
* Bécosse: From backhouse, used generally in the sense of a bathroom. Unlike most borrowing, this one can sometimes be seen written, usually as shown here.
* Bicycle or bécik: Bicycle
* Bike or bécik: Motorbike
* Bines: Beans
* Braker: pronounced {{IPA|[bʁeke]}}. Verb meaning "to brake".
* Breakeur: Circuit breaker (''disjoncteur''). Still very often used nowadays.
* Bum: Bum
* Bumper: Bumper
* Caller: {{IPA|[kɑle]}}. Verb meaning to phone someone.
* Checker or chequé: Verb meaning to check something (out), as in "Check ben ça" ("Check this out.")
* Coat: Winter jacket (only for the clothing item), never in the sense of "layer".
* Chum: {{IPA|[tʃɔm]}}. Most often in the sense of boyfriend, often simply as a male friend of a male.
* Dash:  dashboard
* Dumper: {{IPA|[dõpe]}}. To throw in the trash, to deposit something, or to break up with someone. – Usually actually spelled and pronounced "domper". (In hockey, domper la puck: to dump the puck)
* Enfirouaper: To cheat someone. This comes from "in fur wrap". Centuries ago, fur traders would sell a ballot of fur, actually filled with cardboard in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Dulong, ''Dictionnaire des canadianismes.'' Québec: Larousse Canada, 1989, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Flat: A flat tire, called ''une crevaison'' in Standard French. Can also mean a belly flop.
* Frencher: {{IPA|[fʁɛntʃe]}}. To French-kiss.
* Hood: Carhood
* Lift: Previously used only in the sense of giving a lift to someone in one's vehicle, now used to designate any kind of lift.
* Mossel: Muscle.

* les States: {{IPA|[le stei̯t]}}. Used when referring to the USA.
* Tinque : Usually {{IPA|[tẽːk]}}. Used in the sense of "container": Tinque à gaz [fuel tank].

* Tough: {{IPA|[tɔf]}}. Tough.
* Truck: {{IPA|[tʁɔk]}}. Truck.
* Trunk: pronounced tRung. Car trunk
* Suit: suit.
* Ski-doo: Snowmobile (based on [[Bombardier Recreational Products|Bombardier]]'s [[Ski-Doo]] brand).
* Skring : Window screen
* Windshield: pronounced win-sheel. windshield

Some words were also previously thought to be of English origin, although modern research has shown them to be from regional French dialects:
* Pitoune (log, cute girl, loose girl): previously thought to come from "happy town" although the word "pitchoune" exists in dialects from southern France (possibly coming from the [[Occitan language|Occitan]] word "pichona", "little girl") and means "cute girl".
* [[Poutine]]: was thought to come from "pudding", but some have drawn a parallel with the occitan term "podinga", a stew made of scraps, which was (in [[Montreal]]) the previous use of the term.

{{Expand Russian|Л. Толстой и Достоевский|date=September 2010|topic=culture}}
'''''L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky''''' was a critical [[essay]] written by [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] and published between 1900-1901 in ''[[Mir iskusstva]]'' magazine. The publication coincided with [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s excommunication by [[Most Holy Synod]] and drew a wide public response.&lt;ref name="rulex"&gt;{{cite web  | url = http://www.rulex.ru/01130429.htm | title = Мережковский Дмитрий Сергеевич | publisher = Русский биографический словарь | accessdate    = 2010-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''L. Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky'' is considered the most significant work of Merezhkovsky in the genre of literary research essays. 

The work was partly devoted to the history of [[Russian literature]] and partly to the views of Dmitry Merezhkovsky. An ideological basis of the essay is the dilemma of Christianity and [[paganism]]. [[Alexander Men]] noted that Tolstoy was described as a pagan here ("seer of flesh"), while [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] opposed him as a "seer of spirit".

The Merezhkovsky's study on the works of Leo Tolstoy was subsequently recognized as the most detailed and accurate.

'''Lath art''' is a form of [[woodworking]] [[folk art]] for making rustic pictures out of strips out of old "[[lath]]" from "[[plaster]] and lath" walls. Today it is commonly made from lattice, lumber stickers and [[weathering|weathered]] [[lobster trap]]s. Beach scenes and rural scenes are the most popular themes. 

==Techniques==
  
Lath art has a lot in common with [[marquetry]] and [[intarsia]]. They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of wood, but marquetry  and intarsia use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the [[lath]] stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">'''Logeion''' is an open-access database of [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek]] dictionaries. Developed by Josh Goldenberg and Matt Shanahan in 2011, it is hosted by the [[University of Chicago]]. Apart from simultaneous search capabilities across different dictionaries and reference works, Logeion offers access to frequency and collocation data from the [[Perseus Project]].

== Features ==
Having started out as an aggregator for Latin and Ancient Greek dictionaries, Logeion has implemented multiple new features in its development. These include:
*the integration of reference works on antiquity;
*frequency and [[collocation]] data from the [[Perseus Project]];
*corpus examples, equally retrieved from the Perseus Project;
*references to relevant chapters in a number of (English-language) textbooks.

Furthermore, an [[iOS]] app was developed by Joshua Day in 2013. The app's second version, launched in 2018, is also available for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] devices.

== Dictionaries ==
As of November 2018, Logeion contains the following dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://logeion.uchicago.edu/about|title=About ΛΟΓΕΙΟΝ|publisher=Logeion|accessdate=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3892">The word '''''Mamihlapinatapai''''' is derived from the [[Yaghan language]] of [[Tierra del Fuego]], listed in ''[[The Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the "most succinct word", and is considered one of the [[Words hardest to translate|hardest words to translate]]. It allegedly refers to "a look shared by two people, each wishing that the other would initiate something that they both desire but which neither wants to begin."&lt;ref name="guinness"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQhj-D1WpkcC&amp;dq=The+Guinness+Book+of+world+Records+1993&amp;q=succinct#search_anchor |title=The Guinness Book of Records 1994 |page=392 |author=Peter Matthews, Norris McWhirter |accessdate=20 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A slightly different interpretation of the meaning also exists: "It is that look across the table when two people are sharing an unspoken but private moment. When each knows the other understands and is in agreement with what is being expressed. An expressive and meaningful silence."&lt;ref name = "Daily Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3639409/Drachenfutter-Saudade-Onsay.html|title=Drachenfutter, Saudade, Onsay}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also cited in books and articles on [[game theory]] associated with the [[volunteer's dilemma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Kollock | first=Peter | title=Social Dilemmas: the anatomy of cooperation | journal = [[Annual Review of Sociology|Annu. Rev. Sociol.]] | year=1998 |volume=24 |issue= | pages=183–214 |jstor=223479 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rock, Paper, Scissors: Game Theory in Everyday Life |first=Len |last=Fisher |page=76 |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also referenced in ''[[Defining the World]]'' in a discussion of the difficulties facing [[Samuel Johnson]] in trying to arrive at succinct, yet accurate, definitions of words.&lt;ref name="Henry Hitchings"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hitchings |first=H. |page=92 |title=Defining the World |publisher=[[Farrar, Straus, and Giroux]] |location=New York |year=2005 |isbn=0-374-11302-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referenced in the documentary film ''Life in a Day'' (2011), in response to the question "what do you love?".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mamihlapinatapai- Life in a day|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWS5loAeH2M|accessdate = 2015-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
The word consists of the [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]]/[[grammatical voice|passive]] prefix ''ma-'' (''mam-'' before a vowel), the root ''ihlapi'' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|iɬapi|}}), which means "to be at a loss as what to do next", the [[stative]] suffix ''-n'', an achievement suffix ''-ata,'' and the [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] suffix ''-apai'', which in composition with the reflexive ''mam-'' has a reciprocal sense.

==In popular culture==
*''Mamihlapinatapai'' was the title of an exhibition and self-published exhibition catalogue by [[Max Pinckers]] and Michiel Burger in Amsterdam's Flemish Cultural Centre, De Brakke Grond, in 2012.&lt;ref name="De Brakke Grond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.brakkegrond.nl/programma/550/Max_Pinckers_en_Michiel_Burger/MAMIHLAPINATAPAI/ | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121126152159/http://www.brakkegrond.nl/programma/550/Max_Pinckers_en_Michiel_Burger/MAMIHLAPINATAPAI/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=November 26, 2012 | title=Max Pinckers en Michiel Burger: ''Mamihlapinatapai'' | publisher=De Brakke Grond | accessdate=November 24, 2014| language=Dutch, English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*"Mamihlapinatapai" is a song by [[Ronny Cox]] from his 2004 album ''Ronny Cox Live''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ronny Cox Live RELEASED 2004|url=http://www.ronnycox.com/albums/ronny-cox-live/|website=[[Ronny Cox]]|publisher=ronnycox.com|accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Matrix''' is an open protocol for real-time communication.  It is designed to allow users with accounts at one [[communications service provider]] to communicate with users of a different service provider via [[online chat]], [[Voice over IP]], and [[Videotelephony]].  That is, it aims to make real-time communication work seamlessly between different service providers, just like standard [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] email does now for [[store-and-forward]] email service.

From a technical perspective, it is an [[application layer]] [[communication protocol]] for [[Federation (information technology)|federated]] real-time communication.  It provides HTTP APIs and [[open source]] reference implementations for securely distributing and persisting messages in [[JSON]] format over an open federation of servers.&lt;ref name=lwn&gt;{{cite news | url=https://lwn.net/Articles/632572/ | title=Matrix: a new specification for federated realtime chat | author=Nathan Willis | work=[[LWN.net]] | date=2015-02-11 | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drdobbs&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/matrixorg-reloads-inside-illusion-of-con/240169004 | author=Adrian Bridgwater | title=Matrix.org Reloads Inside "Illusion of Control" Vortex | work=[[Dr. Dobb's Journal]]  | date=2014-09-09 | accessdate=2015-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can integrate with standard [[web services]] via [[WebRTC]], facilitating browser-to-browser applications.

Other attempts at defining an open [[instant messaging]] or multimedia [[signalling protocol]] of this type had difficulties becoming widely adopted—e.g. [[XMPP]] and [[IRCv3]]—and have highlighted the challenges involved, both technological and political.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240169575/solving-the-webrtc-interoperability-problem | author=Andrew Prokop | title=Solving the WebRTC Interoperability Problem - Post | work= No Jitter | date=2015-02-23 | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is unclear if there is enough demand among users for services which interoperate among providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telecomtv.com/articles/standards/to-interop-or-not-to-interop-is-matrix-org-the-answer-for-silo-d-comms-services-12444/ | author= Ian Scales| title=To interop or not to interop?

== History ==

=== Initial Project ===
The initial project was created inside [[Amdocs]], while building a chat tool called "Amdocs Unified Communications"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amdocs.com:80/Products/digital-lifestyle-services/Pages/unified-communications.aspx|title=Amdocs {{!}} Products {{!}} Unified Communications|last=|first=|date=|website=amdocs|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141003202858/http://www.amdocs.com:80/Products/digital-lifestyle-services/Pages/unified-communications.aspx|archive-date=2014-10-03|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;, by Matthew Hodgson and Amandine Le Pape. Amdocs then funded most of the development work from 2014 - October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/who-is-matrix-org/|title=Who is Matrix.org? {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 a [[subsidiary]] of Amdocs was created, named "Vector Creations Limited", and the Matrix Staff was moved there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/vector-creations-ltd.|title=Linkedin entry for Vector Creations Limited|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Matrix was the winner of the Innovation award at WebRTC 2014 Conference &amp; Expo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.uppersideconferences.com/award-winners-webrtc-2014-conference-expo/#.VZBLdbIVhBc|title=Award Winners of the WebRTC 2014 Conference &amp; Expo - Upperside Blog|date=2014-12-23|work=WebRTC|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of the "Best in Show" award at WebRTC World in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.webrtcworld.com/topics/from-the-experts/articles/403607-webrtc-world-miami-wrap-up-review.htm|title=WebRTC World Miami Wrap Up and Review|date=2015-05-18|work=WebRTC|accessdate=2015-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funding Crisis ===
In July 2017 the funding by Amdocs was announced to be cut and in the following weeks the core team created their own [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based company, "New Vector"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10873661 | title=Free company information from Companies House (UK Government) | accessdate=2018-07-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was mainly build to support Matrix and Riot development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vector.im/|title=New Vector - We believe the future will be open and decentralized|website=New Vector|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time period, there were multiple calls for support to the community and companies that build on Matrix&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2017/07/07/a-call-to-arms-supporting-matrix/|title=A Call to Arms: Supporting Matrix! {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, to help pay for the wages of at least part of the core team. [[Patreon]] and [[Liberapay]] crowdfunding accounts were created&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/hello-world-12867439|title=Hello world! {{!}} Matrix.org on Patreon|work=Patreon|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the core team started a [[Video Podcast|video podcast]], called Matrix "Live" to keep the contributors up to speed with ongoing developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Matrixdotorg|title=Matrix Live - Episode 1: July 14th 2017|date=2017-07-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0n1xz4KRVE|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was expanded by a weekly [[blog]] format, called "This Week in Matrix", where interested community members could read, or submit their own, Matrix-related news.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/category/this-week-in-matrix/|title=This Week in Matrix {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== New Vector ===
The company was created with the goal of offering [[IT consultancy|consultancy]] services for Matrix and paid hosting of Matrix servers (as a platform called modular.im) to generate income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matrix-org | title=Matrix  | work=CrunchBase | accessdate=2015-06-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.modular.im/|title=Awesome hosting for Matrix {{!}} Modular|website=www.modular.im|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the early weeks after its creation, there the Matrix team and the company [[Purism, SPC|Purism]] published plans to collaborate in the creation of the [[Librem|Librem 5]] phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.tomshardware.com/news/purism-librem-5-january-2019,37216.html|title=Purism’s Privacy-Focused Librem 5 Smartphone's On Track For A Jan '19 Release|date=2018-06-06|work=Tom's Hardware|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Librem 5 was intended to be a Matrix native phone, where the default pre-installed messaging and caller app should use Matrix for audio and video calls and instant messaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://shop.puri.sm/shop/librem-5/|title=Librem 5 – A Security and Privacy Focused Phone – Purism|website=shop.puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In late January 2018 the company received a investment of US$ 5 million from '''status&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/01/29/status-invests-5-million-in-matrix-to-create-a-blockchain-messaging-superpower/|title=Status invests $5 million in Matrix to create a blockchain messaging superpower|date=2018-01-29|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-10-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.status.im/status-invests-5m-in-riot-im-4e3026a8bd50|title=Status Invests $5M In Riot.im – Status Blog|date=2018-01-29|work=Status Blog|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;''', a  [[Ethereum]] based [[Startup company|startup]]. 

In April 2018 the [[Government of France|French Government]] announced plans to create their own instant messaging tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-france-privacy/france-builds-whatsapp-rival-due-to-surveillance-risk-idUSKBN1HN258|title=France builds WhatsApp rival due to surveillance risk|last=Rosemain|first=Mathieu|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which was later confirmed, by the Matrix team, to be based on Riot and Matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2018/04/26/matrix-and-riot-confirmed-as-the-basis-for-frances-secure-instant-messenger-app/|title=Matrix and Riot confirmed as the basis for France’s Secure Instant Messenger app {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Vector is said to provide some support to the government in this endeavour.

=== The Matrix.org Foundation ===
In October 2018 a [[private company limited by guarantee]] called "the Matrix.org foundation"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/11648710|title=THE MATRIX.ORG FOUNDATION - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated, to serve as a neutral legal entity for further development of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2018/10/29/introducing-the-matrix-org-foundation-part-1-of-2/|title=Introducing the Matrix.org Foundation (Part 1 of 2) {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protocol==
Matrix targets use cases like [[Voice over IP]], [[Internet of Things]] and [[instant messaging]], including group communication, along with a longer-term goal to be a generic messaging and data synchronization system for the web. The protocol supports security and replication, maintaining full conversation history, with no single points of control or failure.  Existing communication services can integrate with the Matrix ecosystem.&lt;ref name="lwn" /&gt;

Client software is available for open-federated Instant Messaging (IM), Voice over IP (VoIP) and Internet of Things (IoT) communication.

The Matrix standard specifies [[REST]]ful HTTP APIs for securely transmitting and replicating JSON data between Matrix-capable clients, servers and services. Clients send data by PUTing it to a ‘room’ on their server, which then replicates the data over all the Matrix servers participating in this ‘room’. This data is signed using a git-style signature to mitigate tampering, and the federated traffic is encrypted with HTTPS and signed with each server’s private key to avoid spoofing. Replication follows [[eventual consistency]] semantics, allowing servers to function even if offline or after data-loss by re-synchronizing missing history from other participating servers.

The Olm library provides for optional [[end-to-end encryption]] on a room-by-room basis via a [[Double Ratchet Algorithm]] implementation.&lt;ref name="Ermoshina-2016"&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Ermoshina |first1=Ksenia |last2=Musiani |first2=Francesca |last3=Halpin |first3=Harry|editor=Bagnoli, Franco et al. |pages=244–254 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-45982-0_22|title=End-to-End Encrypted Messaging Protocols: An Overview|book-title=Internet Science |publisher=Springer |location=Florence, Italy |conference=INSCI 2016 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-45982-0_22 |isbn=978-3-319-45982-0 |date=September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It can ensure that conversation [[data at rest]] is only readable by the room participants. With it configured, data transmitted over Matrix is only visible as [[ciphertext]] to the Matrix servers, and can be decrypted only by authorized participants in the room. The Olm and Megolm (an expansion of Olm to better suit the need for bigger rooms) libraries have been subject of a cryptographic review by [[NCC Group]], whose findings are publicly available&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/our-research/matrix-olm-cryptographic-review/|title=Matrix Olm Cryptographic Review |date=18 November 2016 |website=www.nccgroup.trust|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and have been addressed by the Matrix team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://matrix.org/blog/2016/11/21/matrixs-olm-end-to-end-encryption-security-assessment-released-and-implemented-cross-platform-on-riot-at-last/|title=Matrix’s ‘Olm’ End-to-end Encryption security assessment released – and implemented cross-platform on Riot at last! {{!}} Matrix.org|website=matrix.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review was sponsored by the [[Open Technology Fund]].

== Bridges ==
Matrix does support bridging messages from different chat applications into Matrix rooms. These bridges are programs that run on the server and communicate with the non-Matrix servers. Bridges can either be acting as puppets or relays, where the in the former the individual users account is visibly posting the messages, and in the latter a bot posts the messages for non puppeteered user accounts. 

Currently there are bridges for:

* [[Telegram (service)|Telegram]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram|title=tulir/mautrix-telegram|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Discord (software)|Discord]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord|title=Half-Shot/matrix-appservice-discord|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gitter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter|title=matrix-org/matrix-appservice-gitter|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Slack (software)|Slack]]/[[Mattermost]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack|title=matrix-org/matrix-appservice-slack|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc|title=matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But all are at various stages of completion.

== Clients ==
[[Riot.im|Riot]] is the reference implementation of a client. Many other clients, bots, bridges, servers and other implementations of the Matrix protocol exist too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Try Matrix Now!|url=https://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html|website=Matrix.org|accessdate=13 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''''Microcosmos''''' (original title ''Microcosmos : Le peuple de l'herbe'' &amp;mdash; Microcosmos: People of the grass) is a 1996  [[documentary film]] by Claude Nuridsany and Marie Pérennou and produced by [[Jacques Perrin]]. Set to the music of [[Bruno Coulais]], this film is primarily a record of detailed interactions between insects and other small invertebrates.

The film was screened out of competition at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4706/year/1996.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Microcosmos |accessdate=2009-09-20|website=Festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
[[Roger Ebert]] gave Microcosmos 4/4 stars, calling it "...an amazing film that allows us to peer deeply into the insect world and marvel at creatures we casually condemn to squishing." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/microcosmos-1997|title=Microcosmos Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1997) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=Rogerebert.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Janet Maslin]] of [[The New York Times]] wrote, "...this quick, captivating film offers a taste of the exotic to viewers of any stripe (or spot). And it's a breathtaking reminder that Mother Nature remains the greatest special effects wizard of all." &lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F07E3DF173EF93AA35753C1A960958260|title=Movie Review -  Bee Loves Orchid; Little Beetle Works Very Hard|website=Nytimes.com|accessdate=18 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mitsouko''' is a 1919 [[perfume]] by [[Guerlain]].  Its name is derived from the French [[transliteration]] of a [[Women in Japan|Japanese female]] personal name [[Mitsuko]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://perfumeshrine.blogspot.com/2011/03/guerlain-mitsouko-fragrance-review.html?m=1 Guerlain: Mitsouko] ''Perfume Shrine'' Nov 2011, accessed Nov 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fruity [[chypre]] whose top [[Note (perfumery)|notes]] include [[bergamot essential oil|bergamot]], its middle notes [[peach]], [[rose]], [[iris (plant)|iris]], [[clove]], and [[jasmine]], and its base notes [[vetiver]], [[oakmoss]], and [[labdanum]].&lt;ref name="BasenotesNet_Guerlain_Mitsouko" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FragranticaCom_Guerlain_Mitsouko" /&gt;

==History==
Mitsouko was created by [[perfumer]] [[Jacques Guerlain]] in 1919. The perfume has remained continuously available ever since.&lt;ref name=BasenotesNet_Guerlain_Mitsouko&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitsouko is preserved in its original 1919 formulation in the archives of the [[Osmothèque]], donated to the collection by [[Thierry Wasser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osmotheque.fr/ Osmothèque - Conservatoire international des parfums]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been re-formulated several times in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boisdejasmin.com/2005/05/guerlain-mitsouko-perfume-review.html Mitsouko review] boisdejasmin.com accessed Dec 2014&lt;/ref&gt; It was a favorite fragrance of [[Charlie Chaplin]], [[Ingrid Bergman]], [[Jean Harlow]], and [[Anais Nin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Donaldson|first1=Alexandra|title=Celebrity Perfumes: Do You Buy by Association?|url=http://www.thewhaleandtherose.com/celebrity-influence-guerlain-mitsouko/|website=The Whale &amp; The Rose|accessdate=5 January 2018|date=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
There is no definitive information on the origin of the name. One account of the origin of the name is that it was inspired by the name of the heroine of [[Claude Farrère]]'s novel ''La bataille'' (''The Battle'').  The novel is set in [[Japan]] during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], and chronicles a fictional ''amour fou'' between a British Navy Officer&lt;!-- Source just says "British Officer" but context strongly suggests RN officer--&gt; and one "Mitsouko," the wife of Fleet Admiral Baron  [[Tōgō Heihachirō]].  Both Togo and the British officer sail to war, and Mitsouko awaits with [[Stiff upper lip|reserve]] to see which of the two will return alive to her.&lt;ref name=FragranticaCom_Guerlain_Mitsouko&gt;

| accessdate = 2008-12-30}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The other possibility is that it was inspired by the story of [[Mitsuko Aoyama]], the mother of [[Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7454">'''Multi-age classrooms''' or '''composite classes''' are classrooms with students from more than one [[grade level]]. They are created because of a pedagogical choice of a school or school district. They are different from split classes which are formed when there are too many students for one class - but not enough to form two classes of the same [[grade level]]. Composite classes are more common in smaller schools; an extreme form is the [[one-room school]].

Studies of the [[academic achievement|performance of students]] in composite classes shows their academic performance is not substantially different from those in single-grade classrooms; instead, outcomes tend to be a function of the teacher's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Prevalence==
For a given number of students, composite classes allow greater administrative flexibility in allocating students to classes. This allows gender balancing, matching of student needs to teaching expertise, and balancing [[class size]]s. By allocating children to classes according to specific learning needs, it is possible to arrange classes with narrower ranges of abilities.

Schools composed exclusively of composite classes are increasingly common in Australian primary school education; they are not uncommon in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Composite classes often meet resistance, with parents often believing that their child is disadvantaged by being in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Advocates of multi-age classrooms point to the lack of age stratification in workplaces, families or other social environments as a reason to create a similar environment in the classroom.

==Cited benefits==
Social benefits often cited are:
*Older children in a composite class get more leadership opportunities and frequently build self-esteem as a sort or role model to the younger class mates. Younger children aspire to do work like the older children in the class.
*The ability for a child to be educated by the one teacher for two years, creating a stronger relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational benefits often cited are:
*Because literacy and numeracy is taught in [[ability grouping|ability groups]], teachers need heightened awareness of individual student's capabilities - they must think of children as individuals.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;
*The techniques of [[classroom teaching]] and of [[individual teaching]] can be still applied.
*[[Learning by teaching]] occurs when students at different stages of learning can help each other with their work; children resolve differences in understanding of material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ednewsparent.org/teaching-learning/8157-ask-an-expert-are-multi-age-groupings-good-for-kids |title=Expert weighs in on mixed-age classroom settings  |first=Laura |last=Barr |work=ednewsparent.org |date=February 14, 2012 |accessdate=1 April 2012| publisher=EdNews Parent}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Roopnarine | first1 = J.

*Composite classes provide a range of levels of work, so the needs of both talented children and slower learners can be catered for, while providing a supportive environment for both.&lt;ref name="theage" /&gt;

At any one time, both composite and single-level classes have groups of students at a variety of levels. This is part of the normal delivery of the curriculum. Education expectations are set at curriculum levels which span across two years; for example, see the [[Victorian Essential Learning Standards]]. Contemporary teaching and learning materials are developed for multi-age classes. By using them, teachers can introduce core concepts to the whole classroom, and then differentiate instruction for the range of learners in the classroom.

OTHER CONSIDERATIONS

The students will be of a greater range of size, age and maturity which can have both positive and negative implications particularly in class sporting activities and playground interaction.

'''''Olim L'Berlin''''' (Hebrew: עולים לברלין, lit. "Let's Ascend to Berlin", also known as the Milky protest) is the name of a [[Facebook]] page that coined a [[snowclone]] in 2014. Comparing the high cost of living in Israel with the comparatively cheaper economic climate in [[Berlin]], which has a growing community of Israeli expatriates, the page urged more Israelis to move to Germany, raising a storm of protest in Israeli social and political circles. Compounding the reaction was the Facebook page's use of the same verb (''olim'') that Jews use for [[aliyah]] (immigration to Israel).

The Facebook page based its cost-of-living comparison on the price of grocery items in Israel and Germany, among them a pudding dessert similar to the popular Israeli pudding known as [[Milky (pudding)|Milky]]. The grocery bill was found to be three times higher in Israel than in Germany. The Facebook page and subsequent public debate became known as the "Battle of the Milky" ({{lang-he|הקרב על המילקי}}) in Israel, or "Milky Protest" in international media.

== Background ==
[[Milky (pudding)|Milky]] pudding, based on a former [[Groupe Danone|Danone]] product and produced by [[Strauss (company)|Strauss]], is one of the best-known and best-selling dessert products in Israel.&lt;ref name=ynet&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3534561,00.html|title= We were (almost) there first|first=Orna|last=Yefet|date=22 April 2008|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[Ynetnews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=way&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/The-Milky-way-378205|title=The Milky Way|date=6 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chocolate-flavored Milky was introduced in 1979, followed by the vanilla-flavored version in 1980.&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt; In 1986, a video commercial called "Battle of the Milky" ({{lang-he|הקרב על המילקי}}) was released in cinemas, showing supermarket customers racing each other down the aisle to grab the last chocolate-flavored Milky off the shelf.&lt;ref name=ynet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-194266999.html|title=Milking a Crisis|first=Liat|last=Collins|date=26 June 2011|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[The Jerusalem Post]]}} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evoking the [[cottage cheese boycott|cottage cheese protests]] in Israel in 2011, the Facebook site owner chose the popular Milky pudding as a new symbol of protest against Israel's high consumer prices, calling for Israelis to emigrate to Berlin to enjoy a lower cost of living.&lt;ref name=way/&gt;

== Controversy ==
On September 29, 2014, a Hebrew-language Facebook page called ''Olim L'Berlin'' was launched by an anonymous site owner.&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/10/17/pudding-man-who-left-israel-for-germany-reveals-his-identity/|title='Pudding Man' who left Israel for Germany reveals his identity|first=Anthony|last=Faiola|date=17 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; On October 5, the page showed a picture of a Berlin supermarket&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; receipt for a variety of products, including bread, eggs, noodles, orange juice, and three containers of a chocolate pudding dessert. Beside it was a picture of a Milky-like chocolate pudding product topped with whipped cream.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/olim-le-berlin-in-israel-a-facebook-page-causes-an-uproar-a-996503.html|title= An Israeli in Berlin: The Chocolate Pudding Exodus|first=Raniah|last=Salloum|date=10 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[Der Spiegel]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site challenged Israelis to buy exactly the same list of groceries in Israel for less.&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; The pudding alone cost the equivalent of 1 [[Israeli new shekel|shekel]] in Germany, as opposed to 4 or 5 shekels in Israel.&lt;ref name=jp&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/From-Berlin-to-Tel-Aviv-Social-media-takes-notice-of-Israeli-super-market-prices-again-378137 |title=From Tel Aviv to Berlin: Social media takes notice of Israeli supermarket prices, again |date=6 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalent grocery bill was found to be three times higher in Israel than in Germany.&lt;ref name=eco/&gt;&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

Besides reminding Israelis of the high cost of living in their country, the name of the Facebook page was a distortion of the Zionist ideal of [[aliyah]], using the same verb (''olim'') to suggest emigration to Germany instead. [[Ministry of Finance (Israel)|Finance Minister]] [[Yair Lapid]] called the owner of the site "anti-Zionist".&lt;ref name=spiegel/&gt; The fact that Germany was chosen as the destination struck a raw nerve across the social and political spectrum, considering Israel's founding in 1948 in the wake of the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]],&lt;ref name=mcc&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2014/10/27/244822/israelis-praise-of-life-in-germany.html|title= Israeli's praise of life in Germany sets off fury on Facebook|first=Michael|last=Schofield|date=27 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|work=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy DC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; its large population of Holocaust survivors, and the many citizens who still refuse to buy products made in Germany.&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/berlin-exodus-campaign-sparks-outrage-in-israel/|title= Berlin exodus campaign sparks outrage in Israel|first1=Aron|last1=Heller|first2=Kirsten|last2=Grieshaber|date=18 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014|publisher=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Are the gas chambers in Berlin also cheaper than here?" one visitor posted to the Facebook page.&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; ''[[Israel HaYom]]'' branded the Facebook page as "an insult to all Holocaust survivors".&lt;ref name=eco&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.economist.com/news/middle-east-and-africa/21623796-some-israelis-yearn-new-lives-germany-next-year-berlin |title= Next year in Berlin: Some Israelis yearn for new lives in Germany|work=[[The Economist]]|date=11 October 2014|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (Israel)|Agriculture Minister]] [[Yair Shamir]] stated, "I pity the Israelis who no longer remember the Holocaust and abandoned Israel for a pudding".&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

On October 14 ''[[The Washington Post]]'' revealed that the site owner was Naor Narkis, a 25-year-old former officer of the [[Intelligence Corps (Israel)|Intelligence Corps]] and a freelance mobile app designer living in Berlin.&lt;ref name=man/&gt; Narkis had first emigrated to France five months earlier, but was put off by strains of [[antisemitism]] and the high cost of living in Paris. He found much less antisemitism in Germany and a more welcoming atmosphere for Israelis there, as well as the "cheap and cool" factor of Berlin.&lt;ref name=man/&gt; He claimed that the high cost of living in Israel was "forcing young people into exile".&lt;ref name=man/&gt;

'''Plantation tradition''' is a genre of literature based in the [[Southern United States|southern states]] of the United States that is heavily nostalgic for [[Antebellum era|antebellum]] times.&lt;ref name=Beaulieu&gt;{{cite book|contribution=Plantation Tradition|first=Kara L.|last=Mollis|editor=Elizabeth Ann Beaulieu|title=Writing African American Women: An Encyclopedia of Literature by and about Women of Color|year=2006|publisher=Greenwood Press|place=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-313-33197-9|pages=705–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decades before the [[American Civil War]] saw several works idealizing the plantation, such as [[John Pendleton Kennedy]]'s 1832 ''The Swallow Barn''. However, plantation tradition became more popular in the late-nineteenth century as a reaction against [[slave narratives]] like those of [[Frederick Douglass]], and abolitionist novels like ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''. Prominent writers in the plantation tradition include [[Thomas Nelson Page]] (1853-1922) and [[Harry Stillwell Edwards]] (1855-1938).  Other writers, especially [[African-American]] writers, soon satirized the genre: [[Charles W. Chesnutt]]'s ''The Conjure Woman'' (1899), for example, "consciously evoke[d] the conventions of the plantation novel only to subvert them".&lt;ref name=Beaulieu/&gt;

'''Project Hieroglyph''' is an initiative to create [[science fiction]] that will spur innovation in science and technology founded by [[Neal Stephenson]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/Dear-Science-Fiction-Writers-Stop-Being-So-Pessimistic.html |title=Dear Science Fiction Writers: Stop Being So Pessimistic! &amp;#124; Science &amp; Nature &amp;#124; Smithsonian Magazine |publisher=Smithsonianmag.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson framed the ideas behind Hieroglyph in a World Policy Institute article entitled "Innovation Starvation" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpolicy.org/journal/fall2011/innovation-starvation |title=Innovation Starvation &amp;#124; World Policy Institute |publisher=Worldpolicy.org |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he attempts to rally writers to infuse science fiction with [[optimism]] that could inspire a new generation to, as he puts it, “get big stuff done.”

Stephenson says that "a good SF universe has a coherence and internal logic that makes sense to scientists and engineers. Examples include [[Isaac Asimov]]'s robots, [[Robert Heinlein]]'s rocket ships, and [[William Gibson]]'s [[cyberspace]]. Such icons serve as hieroglyphs—simple, recognizable symbols on whose significance everyone agrees."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- by ASU --&gt; |url=http://hieroglyph.asu.edu/ |title=Hieroglyph &amp;#124; Home |publisher=Hieroglyph.asu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephenson partnered with [[Arizona State University]]'s Center for Science and the Imagination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!-- by ASU --&gt; |url=http://csi.asu.edu/ |title=Center for Science and the Imagination, Arizona State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; which now administers the project.

In September 2014, the project's first book, Hieroglyph: Stories and Visions for a Better Future, edited by Ed Finn and [[Kathryn Cramer]] was published by [[William Morrow (publisher)|William Morrow]]. Contributors to the book include Neal Stephenson, [[Bruce Sterling]], [[Madeline Ashby]], [[Gregory Benford]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[Vandana Singh]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Elizabeth Bear]], [[Karl Schroeder]], [[James Cambias]], [[Brenda Cooper]], [[Charlie Jane Anders]], [[Kathleen Ann Goonan]], [[Lee Konstantinou]], [[Annalee Newitz]], [[Geoffrey Landis]], [[David Brin]], [[Lawrence Krauss]], and [[Paul Davies]].

The '''SMOG grade''' is a measure of [[readability]] that estimates the years of education needed to understand a piece of writing. SMOG is an acronym for '''Simple Measure of Gobbledygook'''.

SMOG is widely used, particularly for checking health messages.&lt;ref name="Hedman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hedman |first=Amy S. |date=January 2008 |title=Using the SMOG formula to revise a health-related document|journal=American Journal of Health Education |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=61–64 |url=http://www.articlearchives.com/education-training/literacy-illiteracy/880189-1.html |accessdate=2009-01-19 |doi=10.1080/19325037.2008.10599016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ley1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ley |first=P. |author2=T. Florio  |date=February 1996 |title=The use of readability formulas in health care |journal=Psychology, Health &amp; Medicine |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=7–28 |doi=10.1080/13548509608400003 |url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a783435805 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMOG grade yields a 0.985 [[correlation]] with a [[standard error]] of 1.5159 grades with the grades of readers who had 100% comprehension of test materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McLaughlin |first=G. Harry |date=May 1969 |title=SMOG Grading — a New Readability Formula |journal=Journal of Reading |volume=12 |issue=8 |pages=639–646  |url=https://ogg.osu.edu/media/documents/health_lit/WRRSMOG_Readability_Formula_G._Harry_McLaughlin__1969_.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2018-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula for calculating the SMOG grade was developed by G. Harry McLaughlin as a more accurate and more easily calculated substitute for the [[Gunning fog index]] and published in 1969. To make calculating a text's readability as simple as possible an approximate formula was also given — count the words of three or more syllables in three 10-sentence samples, estimate the count's square root (from the nearest perfect square), and add 3.

A 2010 study published in the ''Journal of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh'' stated that “SMOG should be the preferred measure of readability when evaluating consumer-oriented healthcare material.” The study found that “The [[Flesch–Kincaid readability test|Flesch-Kincaid formula]] significantly underestimated reading difficulty compared with the gold standard SMOG formula.”&lt;ref name=Fitzsimmons2010&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

Applying SMOG to other languages lacks statistical validity.&lt;ref name=Contreras1999&gt;{{cite journal

|accessdate=2008-09-20
|pmid = 10977275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulae==
To calculate SMOG
#Count a number of sentences (at least 30)
#In those sentences, count the [[wikt:polysyllable|polysyllables]] (words of 3 or more syllables).
#Calculate using
#:
#:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{grade} = 1.0430 \sqrt{\mbox{number of polysyllables}\times{30 \over \mbox{number of sentences}} } + 3.1291
&lt;/math&gt;

This version (sometimes called the SMOG Index) is more easily used for [[mental math]]:
# Count the number of polysyllabic words in three samples of ten sentences each.
# Take the square root of the nearest [[square number|perfect square]]
# Add 3

SMOG conversion tables compiled by Harold C. McGraw are slightly inaccurate because they are based on the approximate formula. Furthermore, tables for texts of fewer than 30 sentences are statistically invalid, because the formula was normed on 30-sentence samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2497">The '''Schmilblick''' is an imaginary object first described in a [[Literary nonsense|nonsense prose]] by the French [[humorist]] [[Pierre Dac]] during the 1950s. According to its creator, the Schmilblick can be used in almost any occasion, therefore being strictly indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pierredac.free.fr/schmil.htm|title=Le Schmilblick|last=|first=|date=|website=Archive de Pierre Dac|language=French|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pierre Dac]] himself credits the brothers Jules and Raphaël Fauderche with its invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=6p-MAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq=schmilblick+pierre+dac&amp;hl=fr&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Dictionnaire de la télévision française|last=Dehée|first=Yannick|last2=Chauveau|first2=Agnès|date=2014-01-01|publisher=Nouveau Monde éditions|isbn=9782365838092|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Schmilblick'' resurfaced in 1969, in a TV Show by [[Guy Lux]] and [[Jacques Antoine]] entitled ''Le Schmilblic'' (sometimes spelled ''Schmilblik'' or ''Schmilblick''). The aim of the game was to guess the name of an object given some of its characteristics (color, shape, use and so on). This TV game actually re-uses an idea from an old radio show created several years before and called ''Tirlipot''.

[[Coluche]] used this word in one of his sketches, a parody of [[Guy Lux]]'s show.

The word quickly became very popular in [[French language]] and was sometimes used as a [[synonym]] for ''thing'' or ''stuff'', or something designating a strange or unknown object. Nowadays, this word is occasionally used to refer to some limited help provided by someone to solve a difficult problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160929-the-worlds-quirkiest-phrases|title=Eleven of the world’s quirkiest phrases|last=Macdonald|first=Fiona|date=29 September 2016|website=[[BBC Online]]|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idiom is actually ''faire avancer le schmilblick'' ("to make the schmilblick move/get ahead", literally) and was used a lot in the TV quiz show where it meant asking another pertinent question that might make it easier to guess the object.

It usually appears above the [[heraldic crest|crest]] on a [[coat of arms]], though sometimes it appears as a secondary motto beneath the [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt; The word ''[[slogan]]'' dates from 1513, though it is a variant of the earlier ''slogorn'', which was an [[Anglicisation]] of the [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''sluagh-ghairm''.&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster-p1174"/&gt;

==Mottoes and heraldry==

The word ''slogan'' dates from 1513. It is a variant of the earlier ''slogorn'', which was an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic ''sluagh-ghairm'' (''sluagh'' "army", "host" + ''gairm'' "cry").&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster-p1174"&gt;Merriam-Webster (2003), p. 1174.&lt;/ref&gt; Slogans are used in [[heraldry]], most notably in Scottish heraldry. In Scottish heraldry slogans are used as mottoes, or secondary mottoes. Slogans usually appear above the crest on a coat of arms, though sometimes they appear as a secondary motto beneath the shield. There may be several possible origins for mottoes used in heraldry, however slogans are considered{{By whom|date=May 2009}} to have originated from [[battle cry|battle cries or war cries]]. There are several notable heraldic mottoes which are thought to originate from a war cries. For example, the [[Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom]] contains the motto ''[[DIEU ET MON DROIT]]'' ("God and my right") which has been thought to originated as a war cry. As has the motto ''MONTJOYE SAINT-DENIS'' which appeared on the former French coat of arms (this motto is refers to the ''[[oriflamme]]'', the [[royal standard]] of the [[kings of France]], which was kept in the [[Basilique Saint-Denis]]). Several mottoes found in Irish heraldry, which end in ''a boo'', are also thought to have originated as war cries. Examples of such [[Irish language|Irish]] mottoes are ''[[Crom a Boo|CROM A BOO]]'' of the Fitzgerald [[Earl of Leinster|earls of Leinster]]; and ''SHANET A BOO'' of the Fitzgerald [[earls of Desmond]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"&gt;Woodcock; Robinson (1988), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox-DaviesJohnston-p449–450"&gt;Fox-Davies; Johnston (2007), p. 449–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all slogans are actually authentic war cries though. Many slogans pertaining to [[Scottish clan chief]]s have been registered relatively recently at the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]]. Sometimes slogans are merely a name, such as ''A HOME A HOME A HOME'' of the [[Clan Home|Homes]], others refer to a rallying point for the clan, like ''CRUACHAN'' of the [[Clan Campbell|Campbells]], some slogans refer to a prominent clansman like the [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] ''Fear eile airson Eachuinn'' ("Another for Hector"). In at least one case, a [[patron saint]] is used as a slogan, as in ''St Bennet and Set On'' of the [[Clan Seton|Setons]].&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Innes-p60–61"&gt;Innes of Learney (1971), pp. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; The arms of Grant use two slogans (or mottoes): ''CRAIG ELACHAIDH'' (which appears above the crest), and ''STANDFAST'' (which appears beneath on a scroll beneath the shield).&lt;ref name="WoodcockRobinson-p112"/&gt; Sometimes a [[Scottish clan chief|clan chief's]] slogan appears on his [[crest badge]] and in consequence on the crest badges worn by his clan members. In some cases the chief's slogan also appears on his [[heraldic standard|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldry)|guidon]] and [[Heraldic flag|pinsel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/375.html |title=Further Guidance on Flags |accessdate=2008-07-30 |work=The Court of the Lord Lyon (lyon-court.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4017">'''Slow education''' is based upon [[Socratic method|Socratic]], adaptive and non-standards based approaches to teaching.

'''''Smile''''' is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with music by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and book and lyrics by [[Howard Ashman]]. It was originally produced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in 1986. The musical is based loosely on the [[Smile (1975 film)|1975 comedy film of the same title]], from a [[screenplay]] by [[Jerry Belson]].

==Original Film==
The original [[Smile (1975 film)|1975 film]] was directed by [[Michael Ritchie (film director)|Michael Ritchie]] with a screenplay by Jerry Belson. It starred [[Barbara Feldon]] as Brenda DiCarlo, [[Nicholas Pryor]] as Andy DiCarlo (Brenda's husband in the film), [[Bruce Dern]] as Big Bob Freelander, [[Geoffrey Lewis (actor)|Geoffrey Lewis]] as Wilson Shears, [[Joan Prather]] as Robin Gibson, [[Annette O'Toole]] as Doria Hudson, [[Melanie Griffith]] as Karen Love, and choreographer [[Michael Kidd]] as Tommy French. The movie was filmed on location in [[Santa Rosa, California]] with the pageant festivities at Veteran's Memorial Auditorium.

==Production==
The original production opened on Broadway on November 24, 1986 at the [[Lunt-Fontanne Theatre]] and closed on January 3, 1987 after 48 performances. It was directed by Ashman with musical staging by Mary Kyte.&lt;ref name=dates&gt;{{cite web | title = Internet Broadway Database - Smile | publisher = The League of American Theatres and Producers | year = 2006 | url = http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4433 | accessdate = 2006-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It received a [[Tony Award]] nomination for Best Book of a Musical as well as [[Drama Desk Award]] nominations for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical (Michael O'Gorman) and Outstanding Costume Design ([[William Ivey Long]]).

''Smile'' chronicles the backstage troubles of the fictional 1985 California Young American Miss [[beauty pageant]] held in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. The main characters include Robin Gibson and Doria Hudson, two contestants who befriend and help each other throughout the week; Brenda DiCarlo Freelander, an ex-Young American Miss second-runner-up coordinating the pageant; and Brenda's husband Big Bob, an RV Salesman trying to help her through the week.

''Smile'' is considered a "lost" musical because no official cast recording was ever made. However, there does exist a demo CD by Broadway Original cast for Samuel French Publishing, which is a primary source for groups performing the show. Because of that, demos by original cast are audible at their merchandizing site, but they have never been released publicly. Some of the songs from the show, "Disneyland," "Smile," and "In Our Hands," received their first recordings on Bruce Kimmel's Unsung Musicals album, released by Varese Sarabande.  "Disneyland" was sung by Jodi Benson, who originated it in the show.  On a subsequent volume Maria's Song was also recorded.  In November 2008, the record label [[PS Classics]] rectified this loss, releasing the album ''[[Howard Sings Ashman]]''.  The second disc is comprised completely of songs from ''Smile'', sung by Ashman and Hamlisch, with Hamlisch at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Kenneth.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/122198.html "'Howard Sings Ashman' CDs Will Feature Demos From Smile, Babe, Mermaid and More"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212222124/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/122198.html |date=2008-12-12 }}, playbill.com, October 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  They also put a transcript of a taped conversation between Ashman, Hamlisch and Bob Fosse discussing the development of the musical on their website.&lt;ref&gt;PS Classics Smile Transcript&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent activity==
After the Broadway production of ''Smile'' flopped, Ashman and Hamlisch revised the show for stock productions. Book changes include the change of Shawn's roommate from Connie-Sue to Maria, and the addition of some material for Bob. The score was further revised, gaining a completely re-structured opening number (though retaining most of the original melody and words), a new song for Brenda ("Very Best Week of Your Lives") that completely replaced the Orientation Sequence musically, a new song for Bob (Bob's Song), a new number for the winner of the pageant (There Goes the Girl) and a completely new melody and lyric set for Robin's letters home and a slight decrease in the time given to them. The ending was also re-worked giving Bob a significant musical section new to the revised version.

Many of the small lyric changes to the licensed version actually originated before the Broadway production. When reading Lincoln Center's photocopy of the Broadway rehearsal script to ''Smile'', many of the licensed lyrics are printed but scratched out and replaced with what was sung at the Lunt-Fontanne, handwritten.

An hour-long recording of the licensed version was made for Samuel French (the licensing agent) to distribute to groups interested in performing ''Smile''. It uses many of the original Broadway cast, including Marsha Waterbury, Jodi Benson, [[Anne Bobby|Anne Marie Bobby]], Tia Riebling and Dick Patterson. Director and author Howard Ashman played the role of Big Bob in Jeff McCarthy's absence. This recording is often referred to incorrectly as an unreleased cast recording when it is in fact a demo.

A private "industry" reading was scheduled for November 19, 2010, reflecting the revisions.

A production of ''Smile'' was presented by [http://awkwardstageproductions.com/ Awkward Stage Productions] in [[Vancouver BC|Vancouver, BC]], Canada. Awkward Stage's production featured all the adult characters being played by puppets (a la "[[Avenue Q]]" style puppetry). 
Awkward Stage Productions version of Smile, was presented at the [[Firehall Arts Centre]] as part of the [[Vancouver Fringe Festival|Vancouver International Fringe Festival]] Sept. 8-18 2011. As well as at the [http://www.normanrothsteintheatre.com/ Norman Rothstein Theatre] in Vancouver, BC. Canada, October 26–30, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Hetrick, Adam.[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/144664-Casting-Announced-for-Reading-of-Revised-Version-of-Broadway-Pageant-Musical-Smile "Casting Announced for Reading of Revised Version of Broadway Pageant Musical Smile"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101108073507/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/144664-Casting-Announced-for-Reading-of-Revised-Version-of-Broadway-Pageant-Musical-Smile |date=2010-11-08 }} playbill.com, November 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Smile reunion concert was presented at 54 Below, New York, NY, on Sept. 22nd, 2014. The concert featured Jodi Benson, Mana Allen, Anne Bobby, Cheryl-Ann Rossi, and other original Broadway casts. 

==Story==

===Act 1===
The show opens with Dale Wilson Shears, chairman of the fictitious Young American Miss Foundation, explaining to the audience the qualities of an ideal Young American Miss. The contestants begin to enter and, throughout the course of the song, prepare for their journey to the pageant in Santa Rosa, waving goodbye as the number ends. ("Typical High School Senior"). In Santa Rosa, pageant coordinator Brenda Dicarlo Freelander and head judge Big Bob Freelander are photographed for a [[Rotary International|Jaycee]] newsletter. Brenda receives a letter that Wilson Shears himself will be attending the pageant.  When the girls arrive, Brenda gives them an orientation presentation of what to expect during the upcoming week ("The Very Best Week of Your Lives"). The audience learns that Brenda is a former Young American Miss herself. The story then switches over to the dorms, where two sets of roommates, Maria and Shawn and Doria and Robin, are getting ready for bed.  Doria, an experienced contestant, talks about her passion for pageants with Robin while the latter writes a postcard to her mother ("Dear Mom #1").  When Robin is finished, Doria relates the memory of her first pageant, a [[television broadcast]] of the Miss Anaheim pageant in Disneyland, and sings of her dream to someday go there in person ("Disneyland").

The next morning, Little Bob is caught staring at the pageant applications by his father. Oblivious to Little Bob's less-than-wholesome interest in the girls, Big Bob praises him for taking an interest in the pageant. The girls enter and begin to learn a difficult dance routine under famed choreographer Tommy French ("Shine"). During the song, several girls break away from the dance and give short speeches to [[Social Club]]s, the local sponsors of the event. The girls exit and Brenda vows that she will stay cool under the watchful eye of Wilson Shears and the national foundation, unlike her own Young American Miss finals eighteen years ago.

Robin, who has no experience in pageants, is worn out and wants to leave ("Dear Mom #2"). Meanwhile, Shawn has become angry over the attention Mexican-American Maria is garnering from the judges and sponsors.  Shawn voices her wishes to get Maria out of the competition to Valerie, another contestant.  The scene shifts to Big Bob in a meeting with the other judges.  He asks them to look beyond the appearance of the girls and look into their hearts, and how nobody does this. ("Bob's Song").  Late that night, Little Bob and his friend Freddy are seen sneaking around the building where the pageant will be held.  Their plan, to sell nude photos of the girls to local kids, is revealed.  The scene changes to the next morning, as the girls complain of various ailments brought on by the intense dance workouts, a lack of sleep, and the subpar food as Brenda passes out the day's schedule ("Nerves"). Private interviews with the judges are held. Robin, who is fatherless but refuses to play for sympathy, panics and runs out of the room when asked about her family.  The girls, led by Tommy, rehearse for the upcoming Preliminary Night competition. However, the rehearsal is abruptly cut short when Tommy and Brenda argue over a large ramp extending into the audience. Although featured in Tommy's plans, the ramp made unusable many seats that had already been sold. Brenda offers to deduct the cost of the seats from Tommy's check, which prompts him to strike the ramp. When the girls try to rehearse without it, one of the contestants falls. Seeing Brenda's lack of sympathy, Tommy tells her to deduct the money and proceed with the ramp. Preliminary night begins and the girls compete in three categories: Vim and Vigor, Scholastic Achievement, and Creative Talent. ("Young and American"). Sandra-Kay Macaffee, Robin Gibson, and Maria Gonzales win respectively in each category.

The girls return to the dorms and Doria, who believes she has no chance of winning the competition now, begins to pass on her knowledge of pageantry. The girls begin to sing of their anxiety for the pageant the next night, later joined by Brenda and Big Bob ("Until Tomorrow Night"). Shawn catches Little Bob and Freddy taking pictures of her in the shower and, though initially angry, strikes up a deal with them. The song ends in state of high anticipation.

===Act 2===
In the dressing room just before the pageant Robin writes a third letter to her mother ("Dear Mom #3"). The girls anxiously sing of the pageant as they make their final preparations and are introduced to the event's MC, radio and television personality Ted Farley ("Opening Act 2"). The girls, preparations complete, exit. The "pageant" opens with Ted Farley greeting the audience and introducing the previous year's winner, Joanne Marshall. The two dance briefly and the girls enter, carrying parasols ("Smile"). As they sing, each girl gets a chance to open her parasol and perform a brief quip. When Robin's turn comes, her parasol breaks and she runs offstage. Encouraged by Tommy French, she runs on and ad-libs a quip before the dance moves on. The girls continue their dance as a slideshow of their photographs appear on a large screen. Each girl has a chance to pose in front of her photograph, concluding with Maria. However, to Maria's shock and horror, the photo she sees is not a posed glamour shot, but a nude photo taken in the shower. Maria runs off and the action switches backstage. As Ted continues the show, Brenda attempts to persuade Maria to go back on stage and perform. Maria refuses and leaves.

Dale Wilson-Shears confronts Brenda about the catastrophe on stage as the girls perform an (off-stage) number ("Get The Girls"). After realizing that Maria was a finalist in the competition, she crosses her name off of the list and marches onto the pageant stage. After she gives an impassioned defense of the pageant and its honor, Ted announces the four finalists: Shawn, Sandra-Kay, Robin, and Doria. The girls sing as Ted introduces the girls ("We Wish We Were You").  Backstage, Bob informs Brenda that the judges do not want to pick a winner in light of what happened. He and Brenda fight and Brenda fires Bob. The four finalists then give their final remarks before the winner is announced. ("In Our Hands"). Robin finally reveals to the judges that she is fatherless, and Big Bob finds out that his son is the one who took that picture.  Ted and Joanne announce the first runner-up of the pageant, Doria Hudson. After a brief  moment, the winner is announced as Sandra-Kay, Bakerfield's Young American Miss. Ted sings as Sandra-Kay walks the runway ("There Goes The Girl")

Wilson Shears congratulates Brenda on saving the pageant and offers her a spot on the National Committee.  Brenda tries to reconcile with Bob, but to no avail.  Bob, alone on stage, wonders how he can reconcile with his family. In their dorm room, Doria tries to convince Robin to join her in the Miss Sunbelt Pageant.  Robin ultimately decides to go home to find her own destiny.  When she sees that Robin has left without her, Doria takes a winner's stance in her runner-up tiara and roses, once again singing of Disneyland, the only place she can feel loved and accepted ("Finale")

{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}
The '''Sokal affair''', also called the '''Sokal hoax''',&lt;ref name="Derrida97"&gt;Derrida (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[scholarly publishing sting]] perpetrated by [[Alan Sokal]], a [[physics]] professor at [[New York University]] and [[University College London]]. In 1996, Sokal submitted an article to ''[[Social Text]]'', an academic journal of [[postmodern]] [[cultural studies]]. The submission was an experiment to test the journal's [[Rigour#Intellectual rigour|intellectual rigor]] and, specifically, to investigate whether "a leading North American journal of cultural studies&amp;nbsp;– whose editorial collective includes such luminaries as [[Fredric Jameson]] and [[Andrew Ross (sociologist)|Andrew Ross]]&amp;nbsp;– [would] publish an article liberally salted with nonsense if (a) it sounded good and (b) it flattered the editors' ideological preconceptions".&lt;ref name="experiments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html |title=A Physicist Experiments with Cultural Studies |last=Sokal |first=Alan D.|work=''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' |date= 5 June 1996 |accessdate= 2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article, "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative [[Hermeneutics]] of Quantum Gravity",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sokal|first1=Alan D.|title=Transgressing the Boundaries: Toward a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity|journal=Social Text|date=1996|volume=46–47|pages=217–252|doi=10.2307/466856|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in the ''Social Text'' spring/summer 1996 "[[Science Wars]]" issue. It proposed that [[quantum gravity]] is a social and linguistic construct. At that time, the journal did not practice academic [[peer review]] and it did not submit the article for outside expert review by a physicist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/transgress_v2/transgress_v2_singlefile.html| title = Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity| accessdate=April 3, 2007| last = Sokal| first = Alan D.| date=November 28, 1994| work = [[Social Text]] #46/47 (spring/summer 1996)| publisher = [[Duke University]] Press| pages = 217–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MST"&gt;{{cite journal| journal = [[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]| url = http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html| title = Mystery science theater| author1 = Bruce Robbins| author2 = Andrew Ross|date=July 1996}}. Reply by Alan Sokal.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of its publication in May 1996, Sokal revealed in ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'' that the article was a hoax.&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt;

The hoax sparked a debate about the scholarly merit of commentary about the physical sciences by those in the humanities; the influence of [[postmodern philosophy]] on social disciplines in general; academic ethics, including whether Sokal was wrong to deceive the editors and readers of ''Social Text''; and whether ''Social Text'' had exercised appropriate intellectual rigor.

==Background==
In an interview on the U.S. radio program ''[[All Things Considered]]'', Sokal said he was inspired to submit the bogus article after reading ''[[Higher Superstition]]'' (1994), in which authors [[Paul R. Gross]] and [[Norman Levitt]] claim that some humanities journals would publish anything as long as it had "the proper leftist thought" and quoted (or was written by) well-known leftist thinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview|first = Alan|last = Sokal|subjectlink = Alan Sokal|interviewer = [[Robert Siegel]]|title = Parody|work = [[All Things Considered]]|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = 15 May 1996|url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1043441}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=mLgyyDSicEwC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=higher+superstition+proper+leftist+thought#v=onepage&amp;q=higher%20superstition%20proper%20leftist%20thought&amp;f=false|title = The Ivory Tower of Babel: Why the Social Sciences are Failing to Live Up to Their Promises|first = David|last = Demers|publisher = [[Algora Publishing]]|year = 2011|isbn = 9780875868806|chapter = Jesse Jackson vs. The Professors|pages = 15–40|quote = Sokal got the idea for his "experiment" after reading Paul R. Gross and Norman Levitt's ''Higher Superstition: The Academic Left and Its Quarrels With Science'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994).  Gross and Levitt argued that the success of getting published in postmodern journals was based not on the quality of the work but rather on its "academic leanings &amp;ndash; papers displaying the proper leftist thought, especially if written by or quoting well known authors, were being published in spite of their low quality.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gross and Levitt had been vocal defenders of the [[scientific realist]] camp of the "[[science wars]]", opposing postmodernist academics who questioned [[Objectivity (science)|scientific objectivity]]. They asserted that [[anti-intellectual]] sentiment in [[liberal arts]] departments (and especially in English departments) caused the rise of [[deconstruction]]ist thought, which eventually led to a deconstructionist critique of science.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} They saw the critique as a "repertoire of rationalizations" for avoiding the study of science.&lt;ref&gt;''Higher Supersitition'', p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Article==
Sokal reasoned that, if the presumption of editorial laziness was correct, the nonsensical content of his article would be irrelevant to whether the editors would publish it. What would matter would be [[ideology|ideologic]] obsequiousness, fawning references to deconstructionist writers, and sufficient quantities of the appropriate jargon.  Writing after the article was published and the hoax revealed, he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The results of my little experiment demonstrate, at the very least, that some fashionable sectors of the American academic Left have been getting intellectually lazy. The editors of Social Text liked my article because they liked its conclusion: that "the content and methodology of postmodern science provide powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project" [sec. 6]. They apparently felt no need to analyze the quality of the evidence, the cogency of the arguments, or even the relevance of the arguments to the purported conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Alan. "Revelation: A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies". ''Sokal Hoax: The Sham That Shook the Academy.'' Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska, 2000. 49-54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Content of the article===
"Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" proposed that [[quantum gravity]] has [[Progressivism|progressive]] political implications, and that the "[[morphogenetic field (Rupert Sheldrake)|morphogenetic field]]" could be a cutting-edge theory of quantum gravity (a morphogenetic field is a concept adapted by [[Rupert Sheldrake]] in a way that Sokal characterized in the affair's aftermath as "a bizarre [[New Age]] idea").&lt;ref name="experiments"/&gt; Sokal wrote that the concept of "an external world whose properties are independent of any individual human being" was "dogma imposed by the long post-Enlightenment hegemony over the Western intellectual outlook".

After referring skeptically to the "so-called scientific method", the article declared that "it is becoming increasingly apparent that physical 'reality{{'"}} is fundamentally "a social and linguistic construct".  It went on to state that because scientific research is "inherently theory-laden and self-referential", it "cannot assert a privileged epistemological status with respect to counterhegemonic narratives emanating from dissident or marginalized communities" and that therefore a "liberatory science" and an "emancipatory mathematics", spurning "the elite caste canon of 'high science{{'"}}, needed to be established for a "postmodern science [that] provide[s] powerful intellectual support for the progressive political project".

Moreover, the article's footnotes conflate academic terms with sociopolitical rhetoric, e.g.:

{{quote|Just as [[liberal feminist]]s are frequently content with a minimal agenda of legal and social equality for women and "[[pro-choice]]", so liberal (and even some [[socialist]]) mathematicians are often content to work within the hegemonic [[Zermelo–Fraenkel framework]] (which, reflecting its nineteenth-century liberal origins, already incorporates the axiom of equality) supplemented only by the [[axiom of choice]].}}

===Publication===
Sokal submitted the article to ''Social Text'', whose editors were collecting articles for the "[[Science Wars]]" issue. "Transgressing the Boundaries: Towards a Transformative Hermeneutics of Quantum Gravity" was the only article submitted by a natural scientist. Later, after Sokal's self-exposure of his [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] [[hoax]] article in the journal ''[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]'', the ''Social Text'' editors said in a published essay that they had requested editorial changes that Sokal refused to make,&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; and had had concerns about the quality of the writing, stating "We requested him (a)&amp;nbsp;to excise a good deal of the philosophical speculation and (b)&amp;nbsp;to excise most of his footnotes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linguafranca.mirror.theinfo.org/9607/mst.html|title=Lingua Franca|publisher=|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite subsequently designating the physicist as having been a "difficult, uncooperative author", and noting that such writers were "well known to journal editors", ''[[Social Text]]'' published the article in acknowledgment of the author's credentials in the May 1996 Spring/Summer "Science Wars" issue.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt; The editors did not seek peer review of the article by physicists or otherwise; they later defended this decision on the basis that ''Social Text'' was a journal for open intellectual inquiry and the article was not offered as a contribution to the physics discipline.&lt;ref name="MST" /&gt;

==Responses==

===Follow-up between Sokal and the editors===
In the May 1996 issue of ''Lingua Franca'', in the article "A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies", Sokal revealed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" was a hoax and concluded that ''Social Text'' "felt comfortable publishing an article on quantum physics without bothering to consult anyone knowledgeable in the subject" because of its ideological proclivities and editorial bias.&lt;ref name="experiments" /&gt; In their defense, the ''Social Text'' editors said they believed that "Transgressing the Boundaries" "was the earnest attempt of a professional scientist to seek some kind of affirmation from postmodern philosophy for developments in his field" and that "its status as parody does not alter, substantially, our interest in the piece, itself, as a symptomatic document".&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ross, [http://www.math.tohoku.ac.jp/~kuroki/Sokal/sokaltxt/00005.txt "A discussion of Jacques Derrida and Deconstruction"], May 24, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Besides criticizing his writing style, the ''Social Text'' editors accused Sokal of behaving [[ethics|unethically]] in deceiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Bruce |last1=Robbins |first2=Andrew |last2=Ross |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/SocialText_reply_LF.pdf |format=PDF |title=Editorial response to Sokal hoax by editors of Social Text |year= 1996|publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sokal said the editors' response illustrated the problem he highlighted. ''Social Text'', as an academic journal, published the article not because it was faithful, true and accurate to its subject but because an "[[Argument from authority|academic authority]]" had written it and because of the appearance of the obscure writing. The editors said they considered it poorly written but published it because they felt Sokal was an academic seeking their intellectual affirmation. Sokal remarked:

{{quote|My goal isn't to defend science from the barbarian hordes of [[literary criticism|lit crit]] (we'll survive just fine, thank you), but to defend the Left from a trendy segment of itself. ... There are hundreds of important political and economic issues surrounding science and technology. Sociology of science, at its best, has done much to clarify these issues. But sloppy sociology, like sloppy science, is useless, or even counterproductive.&lt;ref name=MST/&gt;}}

''Social Text'''s response revealed that none of the editors had suspected Sokal's piece was a parody. Instead, they speculated Sokal's admission "represented a change of heart, or a folding of his intellectual resolve". Sokal found further humor in the idea that the article's absurdity was hard to spot:

{{quote|In the second paragraph I declare without the slightest evidence or argument, that "physical 'reality' (note the scare quotes) [...] is at bottom a social and linguistic construct."  Not our ''theories'' of physical reality, mind you, but the reality itself. Fair enough. Anyone who believes that the laws of physics are mere social conventions is invited to try transgressing those conventions from the windows of my apartment.  I live on the twenty-first floor.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, John, The Oxford Book of Parodies, Oxford University Press, 2010, pg. 307&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Book by Sokal and Bricmont===
{{main|Fashionable Nonsense}}
In 1997, Sokal and [[Jean Bricmont]] co-wrote ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (U.S.: ''[[Fashionable Nonsense|Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of Science]]'', U.K.: ''Intellectual Impostures'', 1998).&lt;ref name="EnglishPreface"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|author2=[[Jean Bricmont]]|title=Intellectual Impostures|publisher=Profile Books|year=1998|location=London|page=xii|isbn=1-86197-631-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The book featured analysis of extracts from established [[intellectual]]s' writings that Sokal and Bricmont claimed misused scientific terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/lingua_franca_v4/lingua_franca_v4.html|title=A Physicist Experiments With Cultural Studies|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Sokal|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Sokal|work=[[Lingua Franca (magazine)|Lingua Franca]]|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; It closed with a critical summary of [[postmodernism]] and criticism of the [[strong programme]] of [[social constructionism]] in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]].&lt;ref name="Epstein97"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm|title=Postmodernism and the Left|accessdate=March 5, 2008|last=Epstein|first=Barbara|authorlink=Barbara Epstein|work=[[New Politics (magazine)|New Politics]]&lt;!-- vol. 6, no. 2 (new series), whole no. 22 --&gt;|date=Winter 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004646/http://www.wpunj.edu/newpol/issue22/epstei22.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=May 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media coverage and Jacques Derrida===
As Sokal revealed the hoax, the French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] was initially one of the targets of discredit in the United States, particularly in newspaper coverage.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; A U.S. weekly magazine used two images of Derrida, a photo and a [[caricature]], to illustrate a "dossier" on the Sokal article.&lt;ref name="Derrida97"/&gt; Derrida responded to the hoax in "Sokal et Bricmont ne sont pas sérieux" ("Sokal and Bricmont Aren't Serious"), first published on 20 November 1997 in ''[[Le Monde]]''. He called Sokal's action sad (''triste'') for having overshadowed Sokal's mathematical work and ruining the chance to carefully sort out controversies about scientific objectivity. Derrida went on to fault him and coauthor Jean Bricmont for what he considered an act of intellectual bad faith in describing their follow-up book, ''Impostures intellectuelles'' (UK: ''Intellectual Impostures''; US: ''Fashionable Nonsense''): they had published two articles almost simultaneously, one in English in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' on 17 October 1997&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "The Furor Over Impostures intellectuelles: What Is All the Fuss About?" ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' 17 October 1997, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; and one in French in ''[[Libération]]'' on 18–19 October 1997,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Que se passe-t-il ?" ''[[Libération]]'' 18–19 October 1997. pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but while the two articles were almost identical, they differed in how they treated Derrida. The English-language article had a list of French intellectuals who were not included in Sokal and Bricmont's book: "Such well-known thinkers as Althusser, Barthes, and Foucault—who, as readers of the TLS will be well aware, have always had their supporters and detractors on both sides of the Channel—appear in our book only in a minor role, as cheerleaders for the texts we criticize." The French-language list, however, included Derrida: "Des penseurs célèbres tels qu'Althusser, Barthes, Derrida et Foucault sont essentiellement absents de notre livre." Derrida may also have been sensitive to a slight difference between the French and English versions of ''Impostures intellectuelles''. In the French, his citation from the original hoax article is said to be an "isolated" instance of abuse,&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Impostures intellectuelles''. Paris: Odile Jacob, 1997. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the English text adds a parenthetical remark that Derrida's work contained "no systematic misuse (or indeed attention to) science."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. ''Fashionable Nonsense''. New York: Picador USA, 1998. p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Brian J. (2006). Hopkins Impromptu: Following Jacques Derrida Through Theory's Empire. ''MLN'', 121(4), pp. 919-24.&lt;/ref&gt; Derrida cried foul, but Sokal and Bricmont insisted that the difference between the articles was "banal."&lt;ref&gt;Sokal, Allan and Jean Bricmont. "Réponse à Jacques Derrida et Max Dorra." ''[[Le Monde]]'', 12 December 1997. p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Derrida concluded, as the title of his article indicates, that Sokal was not serious in his approach, but had used the spectacle of a "quick practical joke" to displace the scholarship Derrida believed the public deserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Derrida |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Derrida |title=Paper Machine |origyear=1994 |year=2005 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Stanford |pages=70 |nopp=true |isbn=08-047-4619-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social science criticism===
Sociologist Stephen Hilgartner, the [[Cornell University]] science and technology studies department chairman, wrote "The Sokal Affair in Context" (1997),&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epstein used a similar approach to Sokal's, submitting fictitious articles to real academic journals to measure their response. Though far more systematic than Sokal's work, it received scant media attention. Hilgartner argued that the intellectual impact of the successful Sokal hoax cannot be attributed to its quality as a "demonstration" but rather to journalistic hyperbole and the anti-intellectual biases of some American journalists.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

The Sokal Affair scandal extended from academia to the public press. The [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Bruno Latour]], criticized in ''Fashionable Nonsense'', described the scandal as a "[[tempest in a tea cup]]". Retired [[Northeastern University]] [[Mathematics|mathematician]] turned social scientist Gabriel Stolzenberg wrote essays meant to discredit the statements of Sokal and his allies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gabriel |last=Stolzenberg |url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr |title=Debunk: Expose as a Sham or False |publisher=Math.bu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that they insufficiently grasped the philosophy they criticized, rendering their criticism meaningless. In ''Social Studies of Science'', Bricmont and Sokal responded to Stolzenberg,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.nyu.edu/sokal/reply_to_stolzenberg_v2.pdf |format=PDF |title=Reply to Gabriel Stolzenberg|work=Social Studies of Science |publisher=Physics.nyu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; denouncing his "tendentious misrepresentations" of their work and criticizing Stolzenberg's commentary about the "[[strong programme]]" of the sociology of science. In the same issue, Stolzenberg replied, arguing that their critique and allegations of misrepresentation were based on misreadings. He advised readers to slowly and skeptically examine the arguments proposed by each party, bearing in mind that "the obvious is sometimes the enemy of the true".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stolzenberg|first1=Gabriel|title=Reply to Bricmont and Sokal|url=http://math.bu.edu/people/nk/rr/reply_to_bs.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociological follow-up study==
In 2009, Cornell sociologist Robb Willer performed an experiment in which undergraduate students read Sokal's paper and were told either that it was written by another student or that it was by a famous academic. He found that students who believed the paper's author was a high-status intellectual rated it higher in quality and intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willer |first= Robb|last2= Kuwabara|first2= Ko|last3= Macy|first3= Michael|date= September 2009|title= The False Enforcement of Unpopular Norms|url=https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/4570/false%20enforcement.pdf|journal= American Journal of Sociology|volume= 115|issue= 2|pages= 451–90|access-date=21 February 2015|doi=10.1086/599250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Hook illustration.jpg|thumb|205px|right|Ink drawing depicting ''The Hook'' legend.]]
'''The Hook''' or '''The Hookman'''{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} is an [[urban legend]] about a killer with a [[Prosthesis#Hooks|hook for a hand]] attacking a couple in a parked car. The story is thought to date from at least the mid-1950s, and gained significant attention when it was reprinted in the advice column ''[[Dear Abby]]'' in 1960. It has since become a morality [[archetype]] in popular culture, and has been referenced in various horror films. 

==Legend==
{{unsourced section|date=August 2017}}
The basic premise involves a young couple parking at a [[lovers' lane]]. The radio plays while they’re making out. Suddenly, a news bulletin reports that a serial killer has just escaped from a nearby institution.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2004|p=15}} The killer has a hook for one of his hands. For varying reasons, they decide to leave quickly. In the end, the killer's hook is either found hanging from the door handle or embedded into the door itself. Different variations include a scraping sound on the car door. Some versions start the same way, but have the couple spotting the killer, warning others, and then narrowly escaping with the killer holding onto the car's roof.

In an alternate version, the couple drive through an unknown part of the [[rural area|country]] late at night and stop in the middle of the [[forest|woods]], because either the male has to relieve himself, or the car breaks down and the man leaves for help. While waiting for him to return, the female turns on the radio and hears the report of an escaped [[mental patient]]. She is then disturbed many times by a thumping on the roof of the car. She eventually exits and sees the escaped patient sitting on the roof, banging the male's severed head on it. Another variation has the female seeing the male's butchered body suspended upside down from a tree with his fingers scraping the roof. In other versions the man does return to the car only to see his date brutally murdered with a hook embedded in her. In other versions, the woman gets out of the car when her date doesn't come back. Only to see his mutilated body (either on the car's roof, nailed on a tree, or just a few short steps way). But as she starts to panic, she runs into the maniac and she too gets killed.

There is also another legend that is similar. In the legend, the young couple are heading back from a great date but their car breaks down (either from running out of fuel or a malfunction). The man then decides to head off on foot to find someone or somewhere to help with the problem while the woman stays behind in the car. She then falls asleep while waiting and wakes up to see a hideous person looking at her through the window. Luckily the car is locked so the person can't get inside. But to the woman's horror, the person raises both of his arms to reveal that they are holding her date's severed head in one hand and the car keys in the other. The fate of the woman is never revealed.

==Origin==
The origins of the Hook legend are not entirely known, though, according to folklorist and historian [[Jan Harold Brunvand]], the story began to circulate some time in the 1950s in the United States.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|p=49}} According to Brunvand in ''The Vanishing Hitchhiker: American Urban Legends and Their Meanings'', the story had become widespread amongst American teenagers by 1959, and continued to expand into the 1960s.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=49–50}}

The first known publication of the story occurred on November 8, 1960, when a reader letter telling the story was reprinted in ''[[Dear Abby]]'', a popular advice column:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Dear Abby: If you are interested in teenagers, you will print this story. I don't know whether it's true or not, but it doesn't matter because it served its purpose for me: A fellow and his date pulled into their favorite "lovers lane" to listen to the radio and do a little [[kissing|necking]]. The music was interrupted by an announcer who said there was an escaped convict in the area who had served time for rape and robbery. He was described as having a hook instead of a right hand. The couple become frightened and drove away. When the boy took his girl home, he went around to open the  car door for her. Then he saw—a hook on the door handle! I will never park to make out as long as I live. I hope this does the same for other kids. —Jeanette{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=48–49}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Literary scholar Christopher Pittard traces the plot dynamics of the legend to [[Victorian literature]], particularly the 1913 horror novel ''[[The Lodger (novel)|The Lodger]]'' by [[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]].{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|pages=188–189}} Though the two narratives have little in common, he notes that both are built upon a "threefold relationship of crime, dirt, and chance... Such a reading also implies a reconsideration of the historical trajectory of the urban legend, usually read as a product of postmodernist consumer culture."{{Sfn|Pittard|2011|p=188}}

== Interpretations ==
Folklorists have interpreted the long history of this legend in many ways. [[Alan Dundes|Alan Dundes's]] Freudian interpretation explains the hook as a phallic symbol and its amputation as a symbolic castration.{{Sfn|Brunvand|2003|pages=50–51}}

Swedish folklorist [[Bengt af Klintberg]] describes the story as an example of "a conflict between representatives of normal people who follow the rules of society and those who are not normal, who deviate and threaten the normal group."{{Sfn|Brunvand|2001|pages=200–201}}

American folklorist Bill Ellis interpreted the maniac in ''The Hook'' as a moral custodian who interrupts the sexual experimentation of the young couple. He sees the Hookman's handicap as "his own lack of sexuality" and "the threat of the Hookman is not the normal sex drive of teenagers, but the abnormal drive of some adults to keep them apart."{{Sfn|Ellis|1987|pages=31–60}} 

==Influence on film==

The Hook legend has most often been depicted and referenced in [[horror film]]s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|pages=112–114}} Its prevalence, according to film scholar [[Mark Kermode]], is most reflected in the [[slasher film]], functioning as a morality [[archetype]] on youth sexuality.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=113}} 

In ''[[Meatballs (film)|Meatballs]]'' (1979), [[Bill Murray]]'s character retells the Hook legend to campers around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=101}} ''[[He Knows You're Alone]]'' (1980) opens with a [[Story within a story#Film within a film|film within a film]] scene in which a young couple are attacked by a killer while in a parked car.{{Sfn|Everman|2003|p=122}} The slasher film ''[[Final Exam (film)|Final Exam]]'' opens with a scene in which a couple are attacked in a parked car, and later, a student is murdered in a university locker room with a hook.{{Sfn|Armstrong|2003|p=113}} ''[[Campfire Tales (1997 film)|Campfire Tales]]'' (1997), an anthology horror film, opens with a segment retelling the Hook legend, set in the 1950s.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=192}} ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'' (1997) features a killer stalking teenagers with a hook; at the beginning of the film, the central characters recount the Hook legend around a campfire.{{Sfn|Koven|2007|p=104}} "[[The Pest House]]" (1998), the fourteenth episode of season 2 of the TV series ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', opens with a murder similar to that of the urban legend. ''[[Lovers Lane (1999 film)|Lovers Lane]]'' (1999), is a slasher film featuring a killer who murders teenagers at a lovers' lane with a hook.{{Sfn|Harper|2004|p=123}} Season one, episode seven of the TV show ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' features a hookman as the villain.

'''Thomas Mahon''' is an [[English people|English]] tailor, noted for outfitting the [[British Royal Family]] and other VIP clients.  He is also noted for his former ground breaking blog, [http://www.englishcut.com englishcut.com].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Abraham | first=Chris | date=9 July 2010 | title=Marketing Conversation: English Cut Is Still the Best of the Breed Brand Blog | url=http://marketingconversation.com/2010/07/09/english-cut-is-still-the-best-of-breed-brand-blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Mahon was born in Carlisle, Cumbria and grew up in the small village of [[Corby Hill]], Cumbria. He was educated at the local village school and went on to the former grammar school, White House in [[Brampton (disambiguation)|Brampton]], Cumbria. He entered the tailoring trade by taking a summer job at bespoke tailors S. Redmayne Ltd. There the company's owner, Michael Wigglesworth, great, great grandson of the company's founder encouraged Mahon into, what would be a lifelong career in the craft of bespoke Savile Row tailoring. As Wigglesworth pointed out, "Mahon had a vocation and a natural love of the craft". He stayed at Redmayne and completed his apprenticeship whilst studying Industrial pattern construction and grading at a local polytechnic. After seven years of training he left Redmayne for London and furthered his skills as a ''striker'' (apprentice cutter) to Dennis Halbery at [[Anderson &amp; Sheppard]] of Savile Row.&lt;ref&gt;English Cut: Savile Row Tailors.  Documentary.  Accessed 9 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;&lt;ref&gt;"About Thomas," ''English Cut''.  Accessed 9 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Independence and Weblog==
In 1995, Mahon started his own bespoke tailoring company called ''Steed Bespoke Tailors'' with Edwin Deboise, before going independent in 2001. In 2005, he began his [[weblog]] English Cut with aid of cartoonist and Internet entrepreneur Hugh McLeod, in order to promote his business and share his knowledge of the traditional tailor's craft.

Mahon's customers, reportedly include [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] and Sir Jonathan Ive. Although Mahon will admit only to having Prince Charles as a client and is known for not disclosing his Savile Row clients.

Mahon credits his weblog with helping build his business to the point where he had to temporarily stop accepting new clients in 2007 He's quoted as saying  "this is about relationships. It's the old adage that quality, not quantity is key."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Fletcher | first=Mansel | title=Interview: Thomas Mahon | publisher=countrylife.co.uk | date=13 September 2007 | accessdate=6 February 2011 | url=http://www.countrylife.co.uk/culture/article/142979/Interview_Thomas_Mahon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahon is married to his wife Claire who also studied tailoring, fashion and design at UCA, Epsom. They have three boys, Patrick, Francis and John. In his spare time he is a keen sailor and teaches sailing and navigation with the rank of Petty Officer in the [http://www.sea-cadets.org/ Sea Cadet Corps], the UK's Naval Cadet Force.

== Ousted from English Cut ==
English Cut traded successfully building a worldwide client base and reputation. After Mahon's position was confirmed as one of the worlds most respected tailors he sought to expand the business and its services. In late 2012, Mahon began working with Christian Irving. Irving, a long time friend and colleague recognised the potential of harnessing Mahon's knowledge and reputation to offer a high quality made to measure tailoring service. A service which would be much more available and affordable than traditional bespoke. Mahon then began searching for a suitable high quality manufacturer. Through his client contacts he found himself a manufacturer in Japan. Mutual respect and Mahon's reputation and knowledge allowed him to totally, re design and raise the standards of style and fit. Work on this new service was continually supervised by Mahon for the next four years.  Culminating with a personal visit to Japan in May 2017, two months before being ousted as founder, head cutter and creative director of English Cut.

This situation arose when 2015 Mahon was approached to sell a 20% stake in English Cut Ltd to Todd Enright on behalf of [http://whitewinston.com/ White Winston LLC, Boston], MA. Although the purchase was never completed a loan note from White Winston was enforced as the main creditor on 31 July 2017. This involved the company being in an insolvent position and forced into administration by White Winston. Mahon was invited to stay under new terms but found the conditions totally unacceptable and left the same day. 

== Redmayne 1860 ==
Mahon subsequently started his own blog, [https://cuttinganswers.com cuttinganswers.com] and also returned as head cutter and creative director of his original company, where he started in 1983, [https://redmayne1860.com Redmayne] Ltd.

His bespoke tailoring is still available on a limited basis whilst training his apprentice Eden Lewis since 2015. A full made to measure service will follow in the autumn of 2017

'''''Wristcutters: A Love Story''''' is a 2006 American [[black comedy]] [[road movie]] written and directed by [[Goran Dukić]] and starring [[Patrick Fugit]], [[Shea Whigham]], and [[Shannyn Sossamon]]. Its premise is set in a strange [[afterlife]] [[Layover|way-station]] that has been reserved for people who have died by [[suicide]].

It is based on [[Etgar Keret]]'s [[short story]] "Kneller's Happy Campers". A [[graphic novel]] version was titled ''Pizzeria Kamikaze.''

The film was originally intended to be shot on [[Super-16 film|super-16]] [[color infrared film]], which was produced specially by [[Eastman Kodak|Kodak]]. The color-shifts inherent in using this kind of film were thought to enhance the [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]] feel to the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Finney, Andy | work=atsf.co.uk | title=Invisible Light |url=http://www.atsf.co.uk/ilight/tech/ilightec.html| accessdate=2007-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, it proved to be too time-consuming and the film was shot using normal [[filmstock]] manipulated in [[Video post-processing|post-processing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Goran Dukić (Director) | title=Making The Final Cut: The Wristcutters Journey | medium=DVD (Special Features) | publisher=Lionsgate |date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was produced on an estimated budget of $1 million.&lt;ref name="numbers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2007/WRIST.php|title=Wristcutters: A Love Story |work=The Numbers|accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]], it was distributed in limited release on October 19, 2007, before being expanded into wide release on November 2, 2007.

==Plot==
After Zia takes his own life, he finds himself in an afterlife limbo much the same as life, just slightly worse. Here the color is dim, there are no stars, and no one can smile. This strange realm is populated by people who have died by suicide, such as Eugene, a Russian musician who lives with his mother, father, and brother – all suicide victims. Together they waste most of their afterlives in bars, until Zia learns from a friend, Brian, that his ex-girlfriend, Desiree, has also taken her own life. He and Eugene take to the road to find her, in Eugene's rundown car. Early on, it is revealed that Eugene's car has two idiosyncrasies: a sort of black hole underneath the passenger seat where items that are dropped disappear forever and broken headlights that cannot be fixed by even the most adept of mechanics. On their trip, they pick up hitchhiker Mikal, who insists there has been a mistake, and is seeking the "people in charge" (a.k.a. the PIC) in order to be sent back.

After a few adventures across the country, as the trio journey along a desolate highway, Mikal pushes a button, miraculously activating the broken headlights on Eugene's car. Shortly thereafter, they come upon a man lying in the middle of the dark highway, forcing them to veer off the road in order to avoid hitting him and wrecking the car in the process.

They discover the man, Kneller, an eccentric commune leader, had fallen asleep while looking for his dog. Kneller invites them back to his camp, where they quickly discover that minor "miracles" occur, as long as the campers remain apathetic about the result. The group stays with the camp longer than intended, and Zia begins to obsess over the miracles and his inability to perform them. When contrasting this to Mikal's obsession with the people in charge, she reveals that her death was an accidental overdose. Eugene meets a young woman, Nanuk, whom he romances. Just as Mikal and Zia discuss their plans to leave Kneller's camp, another camper, Yan, emerges from the woods with news that Kneller's dog has been abducted by a cult leader called "Messiah King". Kneller, Zia, Mikal, and Yan set off in search of King and Kneller's dog.

The group soon find themselves lost and decide to bed down for the night. Unable to sleep, Mikal and Zia discover a nearby ocean shore, where they kiss and spend the night together. In the morning, Kneller discovers them lying among a mass of (presumably used) condoms and needles. The group eventually reach King's camp, where they discover that King is readying himself for a "real" miracle – to separate his soul from his body. As Kneller confronts King, Zia discovers that his Desiree is a devout cult follower, having taken her own life for the purpose of following King into the afterlife.

As King is about to perform public, ritual suicide, Kneller reveals himself to be an undercover agent for the people in charge. King and Desiree are taken away, while Mikal leaves with them, promising Zia that she'll return. As Zia waits, Eugene and Nanuk arrive, explaining that Mikal has been returned to life and Kneller's camp has been shut down. They depart together on a train, giving Eugene's car to Zia. After finally performing a miracle - creating a star in the sky next to one that Mikal had created earlier - Zia enters the black hole under the car seat.

In a large warehouse filled with halls of boxes, Kneller is seen picking up Zia's file from a box, placing it into his inside breast pocket, and commenting on how fortunate it is to know people in high places. Zia wakes up in a hospital bed. He turns his head, noting his parents outside talking to doctors. When he looks at the person in the bed next to his, he sees Mikal. Both look at each other and smile.

==Music==
[[Gogol Bordello]]'s music forms the backbone of the soundtrack for the film; the character Eugene is partly based on the band's lead singer, [[Eugene Hütz]]. [[Tom Waits]], who plays Kneller in the film, also appears on the soundtrack with the song "Dead and Lovely" (from his 2004 album ''[[Real Gone (album)|Real Gone]]'') in the opening credits. [[Joy Division]]'s "[[Love Will Tear Us Apart]]" and [[Christian Death]]'s "Deathwish" can be heard in the background of the first bar scene of the film (both bands were fronted by singers who died by suicide), and an arrangement of "[[Gloomy Sunday]]" can be heard at a later point, songs about or associated with suicide.

==Reception==
The film received a positive review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', which named it a "Critics' Pick" and said in part that it "has an offbeat, [[absurdism|absurdist]] charm that turns a potentially creepy concept into an odd, touching adventure."&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/movies/19wris.html "Life’s a Little Bit Worse Now That They’re Dead,"] A. O. Scott, ''The New York Times,'' October 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2015, the film had a 67% "fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|wristcutters_a_love_story}}&lt;/ref&gt;
