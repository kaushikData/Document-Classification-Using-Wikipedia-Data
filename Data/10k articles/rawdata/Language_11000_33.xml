'''Aas''' ({{lang-oc|Aas}}) is the name of a French village of about a hundred inhabitants in the [[Communes of France|commune]] of [[Eaux-Bonnes]], [[Ossau]] valley, historical province of [[Haut-Béarn]], [[departments of France|departement]] [[Pyrénées-Atlantiques]].

Its shepherds maintained a [[whistled language]] until the 20th century. According to [[Graham Robb]], no outsiders knew of the language until a 1959 TV program mentioned it. Whistles were up to 100 decibels, and were used for communication by shepherds in the mountains and by women working in the fields. During the Nazi occupation the language was used to ferry refugees across the Spanish borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robb|first=Graham|title=The Discovery of France|page=61|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=2007|isbn=9780393059731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Afghan Sign Language''' is the [[deaf sign language]] of [[Jalalabad]] in eastern Afghanistan, possibly with some presence in [[Kabul]]. It has been encouraged in the country's only school for the deaf, and derives from the [[Deaf-community sign language]] of Jalalabad, but it's not known what connection it may have, if any, with the sign languages of other cities with established deaf populations, which are principally Kabul, [[Mazar-e Sharif]], [[Herat]], and [[Kandahar]]. [[American Sign Language]] was used in the Jalalabad school for a few years, and so may have had some influence on Afghan Sign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2006-041_afg.pdf ISO 639-3 Registration Authority: Request for New Language Code Element in ISO 639-3]&lt;/ref&gt;

It has more than 40,000 speakers in [[Alxa League]], [[Inner Mongolia]], China and consists of two sub-dialects, ''Alasha proper'' and ''{{transl|mn|Eǰene}}''.&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 265-266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

{{IPA|/pɑɢ/}} 'small' vs. {{IPA|/pɑɡ/}} 'group', therefore {{IPA|/ɢ/}}. {{IPA|/øt͡səɡtər/}}, thus [[Affricate consonant|affricate]] depalatalization took place for {{IPA|/t͡ʃʰ/}} and {{IPA|/t͡ʃ/}} in any position except before *i.&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 272-273, but we follow Söngrüb 1988 (''non vidi'') who assumes an opposition of unaspirated devoiced and aspirated voiceless phonemes. As we reconstruct *t for Written Mongolian &lt;d&gt; etc. in accordance with Svantesson et al. 2005, Alasha {{IPA|/d̥/}} is simply interpreted as {{IPA|/t/}} from the outset.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ɪr/}} 'to thrust open' vs. {{IPA|/ir/}} 'to come', thus {{IPA|/ɪ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 268&lt;/ref&gt; The maximal [[syllable]] is CVCC, e.g. {{IPA|/tʰers.let/}} ''converbal form of 'to counteract'''.&lt;ref&gt;Sečenbaγatur et al. 2005: 276&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alda Ferreira Pires Barreto de Lara Albuquerque''', known as '''Alda Lara''' (9 June 1930, [[Benguela]], [[Angola]] – 30 January 1962, [[Cambambe]], Angola) was a [[Portuguese-language]] Angolan poet.&lt;ref name=ovimbundu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovimbundu.org/categoria/escritores-ovimbundus/alda-lara |title=Alda Lara |work=Nação Ovimbundu.org|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Margaret Busby 1993"&gt;[[Margaret Busby]] (ed.), ''[[Daughters of Africa: An International Anthology of Words and Writings by Women of African Descent from the Ancient Egyptian to the Present]]'', London: Jonathan Cape, 1992; Vintage, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Alda Lara was born on 9 June 1930 in [[Benguela]], [[Angola]]. She came from a wealthy family and received a Christian education, which gave her a spirit of liberalism according to one commentator. Her brother was the noted poet [[Ernesto Lara Filho]]. Lara attended a women's school in Sá da Bandeira (now Lubango) before moving to Portugal to finisher her secondary schooling.&lt;ref name="luso"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biografia de Alda Lara|url=http://www.lusofoniapoetica.com/artigos/angola/alda-lara/biografia-alda-lara.html|website=Lusophonia Poetica|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Lisbon University]] and resided at the Casa dos Estudantes do Imperio (House of the Students of the Empire). She had an active student life and began her writing career by publishing poetry in the literary journal ''Mensagem'', a publication specifically for Africans. Lara later attended the [[University of Coimbra]] and earned a degree in medicine.&lt;ref name="sheldon"/&gt; 

Lara wrote for several newspapers and magazines such as the ''[[Jornal de Benguela]]'', the ''[[Jornal de Angola]]'', and the ''ABC e Ciência''.&lt;ref name="luso"/&gt; She married the Mozambican-Portuguese writer [[Orlando Albuquerque]] and gave birth to four children. After living in Portugal for 13 years, Lara moved back to Angola in 1961.&lt;ref name="sheldon"/&gt; However, her return would be short-lived, as she died on 30 January 1962 in [[Cambambe]].&lt;ref name=ovimbundu/&gt; Her husband set about publishing her collected works after her death, including ''Poemas'' in 1966 and ''Tempo de Chuva'' in 1973. Lara's poems and short stories mostly deal with themes of motherhood and children as well as liberty and justice.&lt;ref name="sheldon"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sheldon|first1=Kathleen|title=Historical Dictionary of Women in Sub-Saharan Africa|date=2016|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=1442262931|edition=2nd.|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of her poetry reflect a dissatisfaction with the colonial status quo.&lt;ref name=ovimbundu/&gt; 

The [[Alda Lara Prize]] (in Portuguese, ''Prémio Alda Lara'') was established in her honour by the city of [[Lubango]].&lt;ref name="sheldon"/&gt; [[Paulo de Carvalho]], a famed Portuguese singer, who has had a strong artistic career, recorded "Preludio/Mãe Negra", a poem written by Alda Lara.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paulo de Carvalho|url=http://www.casadamusica.com/pt/media/604519/2012-03-25_paulo_de_carvalho_fs_af.pdf?lang=pt|website=Casa da Musica|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=Portuguese}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Movimento'', the second album of [[Aline Frazão]] released in 2013, features a poem by Lara set to music.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://brasileiros.com.br/2014/12/aline-frazao-musica-brasileira-e-autossuficiente-2/|title=Aline Frazão: 'a música brasileira é autossuficiente'|author=Thaís Folgosi|work=Brasileiros|date=20 December 2014|language=Portuguese|accessdate=6 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005210841/http://brasileiros.com.br/2014/12/aline-frazao-musica-brasileira-e-autossuficiente-2/|archive-date=2016-10-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Athanase Jean''' (born 1861 in [[Saint-Césaire]], died 1932 at [[Rouffiac, Charente-Maritime]] ) was a French country doctor and writer.

==His Life==

Athanase Jean, better known by the name of '''Doctor Jean''', was born on 24 November 1861 at Saint-Cesaire, [[Charente-Maritime]], into a family of winemakers.  Having done well at his studies undertaken in [[Pons]], [[Saintes, Charente-Maritime|Saintes]] and [[Rochefort, Charente-Maritime|Rochefort]] and ending up specialising in Naval Health, he found himself posted to [[Guyana]] for his military service.  It was here that he began practising medicine.

On his return home to [[France]] he was able to complete his university degree.  He was subsequently asked by the residents of Rouffiac to become their local doctor, a post he kept until his death on 17 February 1932.

An enthusiastic man and curious about everything, he kept his peasant roots at heart and showed a talent for speaking and writing about the [[Saintonge]] using the local dialect.  This resulted in several works, the most relevant and most popular of which was undoubtedly "La Mérine à Nastasie", a comedy in three acts in [[Saintongeais]], and published under the pseudonym of Yan San Acer (Saint-Acer being the Saintonge name of his birthplace, Saint-Césaire ). It was performed for the first time on 25 May 1902 at the Chateau de Mauleon in Rouffiac.  On 4 December of the same year it made its début in Paris at the Salle Lancry.  It has been reprised on various occasions throughout the twentieth century.

As well as working tirelessly as doctor, he also took part in local government serving on the [[municipal council]] and serving as mayor and councillor for the town of Pons.  He worked to promote the revival of the local vineyard after its destruction by [[phylloxera]], and was instrumental in having a railway station built to serve the village using the receipts from the first performance of his play "La Mérine à Nastasie". He was also responsible for bringing the telephone to the commune.

Like [[Barthélemy Gautier]], well known for his sketches of peasant life, "Doctor Jean" will remain with [[Evariste Poitevin]] and [[Odette Comandon]] as one of the principal names associated with Saintonge culture.

==List of Works==

Wine is contained in a [[plastic]] [[wikt:bladder|bladder]] typically with an air-tight valve emerging from a protective [[corrugated fiberboard]] [[box]]. It serves as an alternative to traditional wine bottling in glass with a [[Cork (material)#Use in wine bottling|cork]] or [[Alternative wine closure|synthetic]] seal.   It is sometimes called  '''goon'''&lt;ref name="The Guardian - 2 March 2015 - Happy birthday goon: cask wine turns 50"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/02/happy-birthday-goon-cask-wine-turns-50|title=Happy birthday goon: cask wine turns 50|last=McClintock|first=Alex|date=2 March 2015|work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; , '''goon bag'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?behaviour=view_article&amp;Section_id=1000&amp;article_id=10021|title=Wine cask|accessdate=5 March 2007|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "Chateau Cardboard" in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/chateau_cardboard|title=chateau cardboard {{!}} Definition of chateau cardboard in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Bladder pack.JPG|thumb|"Bag-in-box" packaging is used for box wine, as well as other drinks]]
The process for packaging 'cask wine' (box wine) was invented by Thomas Angove, a winemaker from [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]], [[South Australia]], and patented by his company on April 20, 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/eclectic-mix-honoured-on-australia-day-20110126-1a4h9.html |title=Eclectic mix honoured on Australia Day |author1=Crystal Ja |author2=AAP reporters |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=13 September 2009 |accessdate=12 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Polyethylene bladders of 1 [[imperial unit#Volume|gallon]] (4.5 litres) were placed in corrugated boxes for retail sale. The original design required that the consumer cut the corner off the bladder, pour out the serving of wine and then reseal it with a special peg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?behaviour=view_article&amp;Section_id=1000&amp;article_id=10021|title=Wine cask|accessdate=27 January 2008|publisher=[[Powerhouse Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was based on a product already on the market, which was a bag in a box used by mechanics to hold and transport battery acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.goodgoonguide.com/who-invented-the-wine-cask/|title=Who Invented The Wine Cask (Goon Box)?|date=2017-08-06|work=Good Goon Guide|access-date=2017-08-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Australian inventor Charles Malpas and Penfolds Wines patented a plastic, air-tight [[tap (valve)|tap]] welded to a metallised bladder, making storage more convenient. All modern wine casks now use some sort of plastic tap, which is exposed by tearing away a [[perforation|perforated]] panel on the box. For the next decades bag in a box packaging was primarily preferred by producers of less expensive wines as it is cheaper to fabricate and distribute than glass bottles.

In 2003, California [[Central Coast AVA]]–based [[Black Box Wines]] introduced mass premium wines in a box, which served to overturn the stereotype that box wines are an alternate packing on inexpensive [[jug wine]].{{Where |date=July 2018 }}&lt;!-- is this stereotype universal? --&gt; Within the decade premium wineries and bottlers began packaging their own high-quality boxed wine, including French rabbit, Bandit Wines, Octavin,&lt;!-- If these three brands are notable, link them; if not, remove them. They are wholly unfamiliar to this UK reader — [[User:OwenBlacker]] --&gt; [[Target Corporation|Target]], and hundreds of others. This coupled with an increased cultural interest in environmentally [[sustainable packaging]] has cultivated growing popularity with affluent wine consumers.&lt;ref name=tcnyt&gt;Colman, Tyler, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/opinion/18colman.html Drink Outside the Box ] ''The New York Times'' (August 17, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the mid-1970s, the bag in box packaging concept expanded to other beverages including spring waters, orange juices, and wine coolers, however today wine and spring water are the main two beverages packed into these bags.

== Attributes ==

Bag-in-box packaging is less expensive, lighter and more environmentally friendly than glass-bottled wine,{{r|tcnyt}} as well as being easier to transport and store. Typical bag-in-box containers hold one and a half to four 750&amp;nbsp;ml bottles of wine per box, though they come in a wide variety of volumes.

The fact that wine is removed from the flexible bag without adding air to fill the vacated space greatly reduces [[oxidation]] of the wine during dispensing. Compared to wine in a [[bottle]] which should be consumed within hours or days of opening, bag-in-box wine is not subject to [[cork taint]] and will not spoil for approximately 3–4 weeks after breaking the seal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Wine contained in plastic bladders are not intended for [[Wine Cellar|cellaring]] and should be consumed within the manufacturer printed [[shelf life]]. Deterioration may be noticeable by 12 months after filling.&lt;ref name="OCW-box"&gt;{{cite web |author=The Oxford Companion to Wine |authorlink=The Oxford Companion to Wine |title=boxes, wine |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=430 |website=winepros.com.au |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905132404/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=430 |archive-date=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
In a 2007 editorial in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', Adele Horin criticized the lower level of alcohol excise levied on cask wine in Australia (compared to beer and bottled wine), saying it encourages binge drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/drinking-problem-is-lack-of-will-on-overall-measures/2007/06/29/1182624168792.html?page=2|title=Drinking problem is lack of will on overall measures|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=30 June 2007|accessdate=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=November 2017}}

'''Cervical dislocation''' is a common method of [[animal euthanasia]].

| MS., [[Tobolsk]], 1665. Published: Moscow 1848, Zagreb 1984.. An attempt to write Pan-Slavic grammar based on the data of all the [[Slavic languages]] which were known to the author. Characteristics of one of the Croatian literary languages (the so-called ''ozaljaski književni krug'', Ozalj literary circle) were marked, that was characterised by the mixture of [[Čakavian]], [[Kajkavian]] and [[Štokavian]] traits, so this grammar can be considered a codification of that literary idiom.

Grammar is generally based on Kašić's, but has introduced several improvements. The distinction is made between the definite and indefinite adjectives, as well as the declension of adjectives and the pronouns and numerals. Della Bella tries to achieve a unified orthography, and provides marks of three types of accents (acute, grave and circumflex), and rules governing their distribution.

[[Image:Panasonic DMR-EH60 20060312.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Digital video recorder|DVR]] with built-in DVD recorder.]]

A '''DVD recorder''' is an [[optical disc recorder]] that uses [[optical disc recording technologies]] to [[digital recording|digitally record]] [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digital signals]] onto blank writable [[DVD recordable|DVD media]]. Such devices are available as either installable drives for computers or as standalone components for use in [[television studio]]s or [[home cinema|home theater systems]].

As of March 1, 2007 all new [[tuner (television)|tuner]]-equipped television devices manufactured or imported in the [[United States]] must include an [[ATSC tuner]]. The US [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has interpreted this rule broadly, including apparatus such as computers with [[TV tuner card]]s with [[video capture]] ability, [[videocassette recorder]]s and standalone DVD recorders. [[NTSC]] DVD recorders are undergoing a transformation, either adding a digital ATSC tuner or removing over-the-air [[broadcast television]] tuner capability entirely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/eb/dtv/ FCC - DTV enforcement]&lt;/ref&gt; However, these DVD recorders can still record [[analog audio]] and [[analog video]].

Given the decline in popularity of DVDs, Magnavox, as of 2018, was the last manufacturer of stand-alone recorders (including a tuner).

==Technical information==
[[File:Detail of DVD-RW optics.png|thumb|DVD-RW optics]]
Originally, [[DVD]] recorders supported one of three standards: [[DVD-RAM]], [[DVD-RW]] (using [[DVD-VR]]), and [[DVD+RW]] (using [[DVD+VR]]), none of which are directly compatible. Most current [[DVD drive]]s support both the + and - standards, while few support the [[DVD-RAM]] standard, which is not directly compatible with standard DVD drives.

Recording speed is generally denoted in values of X (similar to [[CD-ROM]] usage), where 1X in DVD usage is equal to 1.321 MB/s, roughly equivalent to a 9X CD-ROM. In practice, this is largely confined to computer-based DVD recorders, since standalone units generally record in [[Real-time computing|real time]], that is, 1X speed.

Recorders use a [[laser]] (usually 650 [[Nanometre|nm]] red) to read and write DVDs. The reading laser is usually not stronger than 5 [[Watt|mW]], while the writing laser is considerably more powerful. The faster the writing speed is rated, the stronger the laser. DVD burner lasers often peak at about 100-400&amp;nbsp;mW in continuous wave (some are pulsed).

==Computer-based DVD (Digital Versatile Disc) drives==
{{See|Optical disc drive}}
DVD recorder drives are standard equipment in many computer systems on the market, after being initially popularized by the [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer]]/[[Apple Computer|Apple]] [[SuperDrive]]; aftermarket drives can cost as little as $20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16827106393&amp;cm_re=cd_rw_drive-_-27-106-393-_-Product|title=Lite-On DVD Burner Black SATA Model iHAS124-14 - OEM|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Newegg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DVD recorder drives can be used in conjunction with [[DVD authoring]] software to create DVDs near or equal to commercial quality, and are also widely used for data backup and exchange. As a general rule, computer-based DVD recorders can also handle [[CD-R]] and [[CD-RW]] media; in fact, a number of standalone DVD recorders use drives designed for computers.

More recently, manufacturers have begun to phase out DVD drives from [[laptop]] computers in favor of portability and digital media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lifewire.com/death-of-the-computer-optical-drive-832403|title=Why Do Most New PCs not Come with DVD or Blu-ray Drives?|work=Lifewire|access-date=2018-04-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most internal drives are designed with [[SATA]] interfaces, with [[Advanced Technology Attachment|parallel ATA]] becoming increasingly rare. External drives often use the [[USB]] standard for connectivity.

DVD recorder drives manufactured since January 2000 are required by the DVD consortium to respect [[DVD region code]]s when reading a disc. The drives are incapable of assigning region codes when writing a disc as this is stored on a part of the disc to which PC based and standalone video recorders do not have write access.

DVD duplication systems are generally built out of stacks of drives, connected through a computer-based [[backplane]].

==Standalone DVD recorders==
When the standalone DVD recorder first appeared on the [[Japan]]ese consumer market in 1999, early units were very expensive, costing between $2500 and $4000 [[United States dollar|USD]]. More recently, DVD recorders from notable brands have dropped in price. Early units supported only [[DVD-RAM]] and [[DVD-R]] discs, but newer units can record to [[DVD-R]], [[DVD-RW]], [[DVD+R]], [[DVD+RW]], [[DVD-R DL]] and [[DVD+R DL]]. Certain models include mechanical [[hard disk drive]]-based [[digital video recorders]] (DVRs) to improve ease of use. Standalone DVD recorders generally have basic [[DVD authoring]] software built in.

In 2009, Panasonic introduced the world's first [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray disc]] recorder which was capable of recording both DVDs and Blu-ray discs and featured built in satellite HDTV tuners. A year later, Panasonic introduced Blu-ray disc recorders with terrestrial HDTV tuners.

DVD recorders have technical advantages over VCRs, including: {{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}

* Superior video and audio quality
* Easy-to-handle smaller form-factor disc media, and higher durability compared to [[magnetic tape]]
* Random access to video chapters without rewinding or fast-forwarding (serial access)
* Onscreen multilingual subtitles and labeling not available on VCRs
* Reduced playback wear and tear
* High-quality digital copying, with little or no [[generation loss|generational quality loss]]
* Improved editing on rewritable media
* Playlisting
* No risk of accidentally recording over existing content or unexpectedly running out of space during recording
* Easily accessible recordings as a result of chapter menus

Note: Blu-ray disc recorders can record full high definition videos on BD-Rs and BD-REs.

Disadvantages include: {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

* Slow initial access/load times due to the optical nature of the disc
* Limited rewritability on DVD-RW/+RW discs (typically around 1000). DVD-RAM is better suited for high frequency re-recording (around 100,000 rewrites)
* Relatively short life of the laser diodes (average of about 2 years depending on usage).

In addition, DVDs recorded with DVD recorders in the standard DVD format must be [[finalize (optical discs)|finalized]] to view in other DVD players. This disadvantage does not apply to discs recorded in the newer and more flexible [[DVD-VR]] format or the [[DVD+VR]] format - the latter (but not the former) also being compatible with DVD players. The implementation of [[MPEG-2]] compression used on most standalone DVD recorders is required to compress the picture data in real time, producing results that may not be up to par with professionally rendered DVD video, which can take days to compress.

Standard definition VCR replacement DVD video recorders typically has a set of standard recording modes for fitting 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 hour modes (XP, SP, LP, EP, SLP, SEP, respectively) on single layer 12cm discs (DVD5).&lt;ref&gt; About.com, [http://hometheater.about.com/od/dvd/qt/dvdrecordmodes.htm "DVD Record Modes - Recording Times For DVDs"], Robert Silva (accessed 2014-05-10) &lt;/ref&gt; These modes are comparable to those found on VHS VCRs using standard 120-tapes, having SP, LP, SLP modes of 2, 4, 6 hour.

The United States converted its over-the-air television broadcasts to digital "ATSC" in June 2009. This will have a limited impact in ending the need for DVD recorders to perform realtime MPEG-2 encoding or transcoding.  The only setup where ATSC could eliminate MPEG-2 encoding/transcoding in a DVD recorder would be where an antenna is hooked directly into a DVD recorder that has an integrated ATSC tuner.  However, the DVD recorder will have to transcode the ATSC MPEG-2 into DVD-Video-compliant MPEG-2 if the ATSC MPEG-2 stream isn't already DVD-Video-compatible.  This would require transcoding for all high-definition broadcasts and some if not all standard-definition broadcasts.  The same general situation applies to digital cable service; only DVD recorders with integrated digital cable ("QAM") tuners can avoid transcoding, and then only if the digital cable system is already sending a DVD-Video-compatible MPEG-2 stream, which again requires transcoding of all HD content and some if not all SD content.  All other setups (digital cable box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, satellite box's analog outputs to DVD recorder, DVD recorder tuning and recording analog cable channels which are still permitted after 2/2009, etc.) usually always involve an analog step with MPEG-2 encoding being necessary inside the DVD recorder.

A number of manufacturers have combined DVD recorders with mechanical [[hard disk drive]]-based [[digital video recorder]]s, allowing for recording to large fixed disks, and the ability to view these recordings off the hard disk at a later date.

In Japan, [[AVCREC]] recorders, which are able to record MPEG-2 or AVC high definition video from [[ISDB]] broadcast with or without re-encoding, get increasingly popular. Initially, AVCREC recorders use DVD recordable discs, but newer models are able to record onto Blu-ray discs as well onto hard disk drives.

=== ATSC standalone DVD recorders ===

As a result of the [[North America]]n [[DTV transition in the United States|digital switchover]], tuner-equipped devices manufactured or imported into the [[United States]] are now required by the US [[Federal Communications Commission]] to include digital tuners.

This has caused most new [[VHS]] recorders to be implemented as [[DVD]]/[[VCR]] combo units, or to be manufactured without tuners. The US requirement of [[ATSC]] compatibility forces inclusion of [[MPEG-2]] decoding hardware, which is already part of all DVD players but which otherwise would be unnecessary in an analog-only VCR.

An ATSC-capable DVD unit can also serve as a more-powerful alternative to [[digital television adapter]]s, which allow DTV reception with older [[NTSC]] [[analog television]]s. The DVD recorders offer additional capabilities, such as automated VCR-style timeshifting of programming and a variety of output formats, that are deliberately not included in the most common mass-market US ATSC converters.

Unlike the more common digital television adapter boxes, newer DVD recorder units are able to tune both analog and digital signals - an advantage when receiving [[LPTV|low-power television]] and foreign (analogue) signals. Some, however, do suffer from many of the same design limitations as the less costly converter boxes, including poorly designed signal strength meters, incomplete display of [[PSIP|broadcast program information]], incompatibility with [[antenna rotator]]s or [[CEA-909]] [[smart antenna]]s and inability to add digital channels without wiping out all existing channels and rescanning the entire band.

A DVD recording of an over-the-air [[HDTV]] broadcast is at DVD resolution, which is inferior to the original broadcast with [[720p]] or [[1080i]] resolution. Some units also provide limited USB or flash memory interface capability, often only supporting viewing of [[digital camera]] still photos or playback of [[MP3]]s with no ability to write video to these media.

A number of DVD recorders are also capable of recording to [[SVCD]], [[VCD]] and [[DVD-Audio|Audio CD]] formats. Recording to DVDs can be done at different speeds that may take between 1 and 6 hours (even up to 8 hours on certain models) on a standard (single sided 12&amp;nbsp;cm) blank DVD. A trade off exists between recording time and video quality.

=== MiniDVD recorders ===
8&amp;nbsp;cm [[miniDVD]]s are used on some [[digital camcorder|digital]] [[camcorder]]s, primarily those meant for a consumer market ("[[Point-and-shoot camera|point and shoot]]"); such discs are usually playable on a full-sized DVD player, but may not record on a full-sized DVD recorder system. Though popular for their convenience (in the manner of [[VHS-C]]), DVD camcorders are not suitable for professional use due to higher levels of compression compared to [[MiniDV]] and the difficulty of editing MPEG-2 video.

'''Dutton Speedwords''', sometimes called '''''rapmotz''''' {{IPA-xx|ˈrapɪŋmɔtəz}}, is an [[international auxiliary language]] as well as a [[shorthand]] writing system for all the languages of the world. It was invented by [[Reginald J. G. Dutton]] (1886–1970) in 1922. It was first published in 1935 under the title ''International Symbolic Script'' and a year later using the name ''Speedwords''. Revisions were made and published in 1946 and 1951.

The dual function of being both an international language and a shorthand system was intended as a way of encouraging more people to see the value of the method. The original Dutton Speedwords manuals are now out of print, but the method has seen a revival since the start of the 21st century, as its applications in online work have become noted, such as the benefit of using a shorthand method for typing e-mail.

Unlike other shorthand methods, such as [[Isaac Pitman|Pitman's]] shorthand, the Speedwords method uses ordinary Roman letters to represent the [[semantic]] qualities of words rather than using new symbols. This means it can be typed using a normal keyboard.
The vocabulary of Speedwords uses many international words and compressed forms of the writer's{{who|date=April 2015}} own language.

Dutton claimed that Speedwords was "the first abbreviated writing invention in history which at once transcribes all languages",&lt;ref name=petry/&gt; though really its lexicon only fits the English it was patterned after.

Dutton conceived Speedwords not only as a system of shorthand but as an auxiliary spoken language; thus, he provided rules of pronunciation.

==Lexicon==
The principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see [[information theory]]). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots:

:''a'' {{IPA|[aː]}} "at, to" (&lt; French ''à'')
:''b'' {{IPA|[bʊt]}} "but, butt" (&lt; English)
:''c'' {{IPA|[tʃə/tʃi]}} "this" (&lt; French ''ce'')
:''d'' {{IPA|[də/di]}} "of, from" (&lt; French ''de'')
:''e'' {{IPA|[eː]}} "to be, is, am, are" (&lt; French ''est'')
:''f'' {{IPA|[froː]}} "for" (&lt; English)
:''g'' {{IPA|[ɡə/ɡi]}} "they, them"
:''h'' {{IPA|[hiː]}} "has, have" (&lt; English?)
:''i'' {{IPA|[iː]}} "in, within" (&lt; English)
:''j'' {{IPA|[ʒə/ʒi]}} "I, me" (&lt; French ''je'')
:''k'' {{IPA|[kə/ki]}} "that" [conjunction] (&lt; French ''que'')
:''l'' {{IPA|[lə/li]}} "the" (&lt; French ''le'')
:''m'' {{IPA|[mɪt]}} "with" (&lt; German ''mit'')
:''n'' {{IPA|[nɔt]}} "no, not" (&lt; English)
:''o'' {{IPA|[oː]}} "on" (&lt; English)
:''p'' {{IPA|[pə/pi]}} "can, to be able" (&lt; French ''peut'')
:''q'' {{IPA|[kwə/kwi]}} "do (question particle), question, query" (&lt; English)
:''r'' {{IPA|[rə/ri]}} "will, shall" (&lt; ?)
:''s'' {{IPA|[sə/si]}} "he, him" (&lt; French ''se'')
::''sh'' {{IPA|[ʃə/ʃi]}} "she, her" (&lt; English)
:''t'' {{IPA|[tə/ti]}} "it" (&lt; English)
:''u'' {{IPA|[uː]}} "a, an, one" (&lt; Latin ''unus'')
:''v'' {{IPA|[və/vi]}} "you" (&lt; French ''vous'')
:''w'' {{IPA|[wə/wi]}} "we, us" (&lt; English)
:''x'' {{IPA|[ɪks]}} "whether, if" 
:''y'' {{IPA|[joː]}} "was, were" 
:''z'' {{IPA|[zuː]}} "as, then" (&lt; English? "zen"?)
:''&amp;'' {{IPA|[and]}} "and" (&lt; English)

Some two- and three-letter words are

:good -- ''gu''
:know -- ''sa''
:love -- ''am''
:beautiful -- ''bel''
:language -- ''lin''
:game, play -- ''lud''

(Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from [[Latin language|Latin]] roots &amp;mdash;''sapio'', ''amo'', ''bellus'', ''lingua'', ''ludus''&amp;mdash;as are "room" and "sleep" below&amp;mdash;''camera'' and ''dormio''&amp;mdash;while "good" and the root for "air" below come from [[German language|German]]: ''gut'', ''luft''.)

The few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix ''-a'' indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, ''bixy'' = kill, ''bixya'' = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ''ky + luf'' (eat + air) to mean "picnic". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter  ''r'' indicates future tense and ''y'' indicates past. Thus,  ''j sa'' = I know, ''j ysa'' = I knew, ''j r sa'' = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (''bel'' = "beautiful" and "beautifully"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ''ca + dor'' (room + sleep) = bedroom.

==Phonology and orthography==
Dutton orthography is irregular.  It is combined with phonology below.

===Stress===
Stress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix ''-o'' is always stressed, and the prefixes ''u-'' and past ''y-'' are never stressed.

===Vowels===
Vowels are rather similar to Latin.  When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).&lt;ref name=kennaway&gt;Richard Kennaway, ca. 2003, [http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/SpeedwordsSpoken.html Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation]. Compiled by Raymond Brown.&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

Vowel length is only phonemic in a few cases where a root contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel.  For example,
:''pad'' {{IPA|[paːd]}} "paid" (''pa'' "pay" + ''-d'' passive participle) vs ''pad'' {{IPA|[pad]}} "pad".

Only ''au'' and ''y'' are diphthongs.  Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. ''eis'' "ice" is {{IPA|[ˈeː.ɪs]}}.&lt;ref&gt;Or perhaps with an epenthetic yod, {{IPA|[ˈeːjɪs]}}, as occurs with suffixes.&lt;/ref&gt; Vowel sequences in roots are ''ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu''.  The sequences ''ie, uo'' are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way.

"Y" is a consonant in ''ye'' {{IPA|[jɛ]}} "yes" and in ''y'' {{IPA|[ˈjoː]}} "was, were".  (The diphthong ''y'' never appears next to another vowel within a root, so the pronunciation of the letter "y" in ''ye'' is predictable.)

===Consonants===
Consonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., ''s'' is always voiceless, as in "less", ''g'' is always hard, as in "get", and ''r'' is trilled, as in Scots and Italian.  Exceptions:
*''c'' is {{IPA|[tʃ]}} (as in "i'''tch'''")
*''j'' is {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (as in French)
*''q'' is {{IPA|[kw]}} (as in "'''qu'''ick")
*''sh'' is {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (as in English)
*''x'' is {{IPA|[ks]}} (as in English)

Words spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a "very short ee" before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise.  (This epenthetic vowel parallels the pronunciation of ''e'' in the English word "the".)  The suffixes ''-r'' (agent) and ''-z'' (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.

{{IPA|[ʒ, h]}} do not occur in final position.&lt;ref&gt;Lack of final {{IPA|[ʒ]}} is presumably an accidental gap; there is also no suffix ''j''.  Lack of final {{IPA|[h]}} reflects English phonotactics.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{IPA|[ʃ]}} only occurs in final position in an unwritten affix.  A nasal {{IPA|[ŋ]}} occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either.  (See below.)  {{IPA|[j]}} occurs initially in just two words, ''ye'' and ''y''; finally it arguably ends the diphthong ''y''.  The letter ''w'' does not occur in final position, but {{IPA|[w]}} arguably ends the diphthong ''au''.

Consonant sequences in word-initial position are ''bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q'' [kw], ''sp, st''.  The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is ''tt'' in ''otto'' "eight".  Consonant sequences in word-final position are ''nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk&lt;!--search 'erk'--&gt;, rm, rn, st, sk, x'' [ks], and ''q'' [kw] (in ''aq'' "water").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.cmp.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.dict Speedwords–English dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unwritten consonants and vowels===
Some morphemes spelled with a single consonant have an unwritten vowel, and one prefix spelled with a single vowel has an unwritten consonant:
*''b'' "but" is {{IPA|[bʊt]}}, as in English "but"&lt;ref&gt;Presumably with the northern English pronunciation, with the usual Dutton pronunciation of short ''u'', considering that the prefix ''u-'' {{IPA|[ʊŋ]}} below is described as being pronounced as in ''y'''oung'''.''&lt;/ref&gt;
*''-c'' (a suffix) is {{IPA|[tʃoː]}}, as if it were written ''co''.  That is, ''lec'' "mail" is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈleːtʃoː]}}, not {{IPA|*[ˈlɛtʃ]}}.
*''f'' "for" is {{IPA|[froː]}}, as if it were written ''fro''
*''h'' "have/has" is {{IPA|[hiː]}}, as if it were written ''hi''
*''m'' "with" is {{IPA|[mɪt]}}, as if it were written ''mit''
*''n'' "not" is {{IPA|[nɔt]}}, as if it were written ''not''
*''-st'' "-ist" is {{IPA|[ɪst]}}, as if it were written ''ist'' 
*''u-'' (participle) is {{IPA|[ʊŋ]}}
*:(though "having" is ''hu'' {{IPA|[hʊŋ]}} rather than expected *uh)
*''x'' "if" is {{IPA|[ɛks]}}, as if it were written ''ex''
*''y'' "was/were" is {{IPA|[joː]}}, as if it were written ''yo'' (with the ''y'' pronounced as a consonant)
*''z'' "as" is {{IPA|[zuː]}}, as if it were written ''zu''
*''&amp;'' "and" is {{IPA|[and]}}, as if it were written ''and''

Some suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants.  They are detailed below.

===Affixes===
As noted above, the prefixes past-tense ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai̯]}} and ''u-'' {{IPA|[ʊŋ]}} do not take stress, and ''u-'' is pronounced with an unwritten engma.  ''Me-'' {{IPA|[ˈmeː]}} and ''my-'' {{IPA|[ˈmai̯]}} are regular.

Suffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} (English ''y'') when following a vowel.  For example, ''dau'' "allow, grant" (&lt; ''da + u'') is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈdaːjuː]}}, ''gan'' "scarcely" (&lt; ''ga + n'') is {{IPA|[ˈɡaːjʊn]}}, and ''rist'' "clerk" (&lt; ''ri + st'') is {{IPA|[ˈriːjɪst]}}.

Suffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel.  The exceptions are ''-d, -z, -r'', which leave the vowel long.  (As noted above, ''-z'' and ''-r'' take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.)  Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants:
*''-d'' is pronounced {{IPA|[d]}} after vowels and voiced consonants but ''d'', and {{IPA|[ɛd]}} after ''d'' and voiceless consonants.
*''-m'' shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced {{IPA|[ɔm]}} after any consonant.
*Other single-consonant suffixes (''-b, -g, -k, -l, -p, -s, -t'') may take an epenthetic vowel when they would otherwise be difficult to pronounce.  The epenthetic vowel is {{IPA|[ɛ]}} for the suffix ''-t'' (as it is for ''-d'') and maybe for ''-p'',&lt;ref&gt;According to Brown, but not Kennaway.  This is presumably a typo or oversight by one of them.&lt;/ref&gt; and {{IPA|[ɪ]}} for all others.

In addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;
*''-f'' after vowels and ''-y'' after consonants
*''-v'' after vowels and ''-i'' after consonants 
*''-x'' after vowels and ''-o'' after consonants

===Irregularities to avoid homophones===
Besides the epenthetic vowels mentioned above, many suffixes take epenthetic vowels (or their other alternative form) to avoid homophones.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;Raymond Brown, 2003, [http://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/SWpronunciation.html Speedwords pronunciation is complicated]&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, the suffix ''-s'' takes its epenthetic {{IPA|[ɪ]}} after ''k'' and ''g'' to prevent confusion with final ''x'', regardless of whether this would create a homophone.

Usually, the root-plus-suffix is written the same as the potential homophone, and only pronounced differently.  For example, ''-m'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ɔm]}} after consonants, and {{IPA|[jɔm]}} after vowels when a pronunciation of {{IPA|[m]}} would create a homophone, but it is always written ''-m''.  On the other hand, ''-v'', ''-f'', and ''-x'' after a vowel are replaced with their post-consonantal forms ''-i'', ''-y'', and ''-o'' when their normal post-vocalic forms would create a homophone;&lt;ref&gt;Brown writes that the substituting form of ''-f'' is ''fy'', but his wording suggests this is a typo.&lt;/ref&gt; here the difference is reflected in both pronunciation and writing (though the epenthetic {{IPA|[j]}} is still not written).  One suffix, ''-r'' (agent suffix, as English "-er"), has a special disambiguating form:

*The agent suffix ''-r'' is pronounced '''and spelled''' ''-er'', rather than with its normal epenthetic schwa, when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word.  For example, "maker" is ''maer'' {{IPA|[ˈmaːjɛr]}} to avoid confusion with ''mar'' {{IPA|[mar]}} "marry, marriage". (The only other suffix to take an epenthetic schwa, plural ''-z'', would never create a homophone, so schwa never occurs after a vowel.)

===Compound words===
When two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is placed after the first root.  When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix {{IPA|[ʃ]}} is placed after the first root.  Either affix takes an epenthetic {{IPA|[ɪ]}} after a consonant.  Examples:

:''albe'' "already" (&lt; ''al + be'') is {{IPA|[ˈalɪŋbeː]}}
:''diel'' "telephone" (&lt; ''di + el'') is {{IPA|[ˈdiːŋɛl]}}
:''rysan'' "hospital" (&lt; ''ry + san'') is {{IPA|[ˈrai̯ŋsan]}}
:''opmekav'' "anti-aircraft" (&lt; ''op + mek + av'') is {{IPA|[ˈɔpɪʃmɛkav]}} 'OPP-ish-mek-avv'
:''ryefki'' "gymnasium" (&lt; ''ry + ef + ki'') is {{IPA|[ˈrai̯ʃɛfkiː]}}

==Morphology and syntax==
Many roots function as either noun or verb:&lt;ref name=petry&gt;Robert Petry, 1997, [http://www.oocities.org/athens/Delphi/2464/page9.html "The Only Official Site for Rap Lin Rie / World Speedwords"]&lt;/ref&gt;

:''J '''ra''' cde'' {{IPA|[ʒə ˈraː tʃəˈdeː]}} "I '''work''' today"
:''C '''ra''' e fas'' {{IPA|[tʃə ˈraː eː ˈfas]}} "This '''work''' is easy"

The past tense of most verbs is marked by the unstressed prefix ''y-'' {{IPA|[ai̯]}}.  Two verbs are irregular:&lt;ref name=brown/&gt; 
*to be: ''e'' {{IPA|[eː]}} "is, are, am"; ''y'' {{IPA|[joː]}} "was, were"
*to have: ''h'' {{IPA|[hiː]}} "has, have"; ''hy'' {{IPA|[hai̯]}} "had".

The possessive of nouns is {{IPA|[zai̯]}}, and written with an apostrophe:&lt;ref&gt;The homophone "disease" is spelled ''zy''.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''l ont' ka'' {{IPA|[liˈɔnɛtzai̯ˈkaː]}} "the boy's head" (&lt; ''on'' man, ''ka'' chief, head)
*''u femtz' ryu'' {{IPA|[uˈfɛm(ɛ)təzzai̯ˈrai̯juː]}} "a girls' school" (&lt; ''fem'' woman, ''ry'' building)

===List of affixes===
;Prefixes
:''u-'' {{IPA|[ʊŋ]}} progressive (and gerund?), -ing
:''y-'' {{IPA|[ai̯]}} past tense, -ed (related to ''y'' {{IPA|[joː]}} was, were)

:''my-'' {{IPA|[ˈmai̯]}} superlative, most, -est (&lt; ''my'' most)

[[File:Musrepov.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Postage stamp|Stamp]] of [[Kazakhstan]] devoted to Gabit Musirepov, 2002 (Michel 400)]]
'''Gabit Makhmutuli Musirepov''' ({{lang-kz|'''Ғабит Махмұтұлы Мүсірепов'''}}; {{lang-ru|'''Габит Махмутович Мусрепов'''}}) (1902&amp;ndash;1985) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] writer, playwright and author of libretto to [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] opera ''[[Kyz-Zhibek]]''. [[People's Writer]] of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]], President of the Kazakhstan Union of Writers and member of the [[Kazakhstan Academy of Sciences]].

== Biography ==
Gabit Musirepov was born on 22 March 1902 (9 March according to the [[Julian calendar]]) in a village located in [[Province of Kostanay|Kostanay]] region, then belonging to the [[Russian Empire]]. Between 1923 and 1926, he studied at the [[Rabfak|Faculty of Workers]] in [[Orenburg]], and then at the agroeconomic institute at [[Omsk]]. He started his literary career in 1925, writing his first story, ''To the abyss'' (''В пучине'') in 1928, about events that occurred during the [[Russian Civil War]], 1918-1920. In 1928, he collaborated at the literary journal ''Jana-Adabiet'' (''Жана-Адабиет''). Among his works stand out ''Kyz-Zhibek'' (''Қыз Жібек''), first libretto to a Kazakh opera, with music by [[Yevgeny Brusilovsky]], and ''The tragedy of the poet'' (''Трагедия поэта''), written in 1958 (first version titled ''Ақан сері Ақтоқты'', 1942), that dealt with the tragedy of [[Ajani]], a Kazakh singer and composer of the 19th century.

He was President to the Union of Kazakh Writers between 1956–1962 and 1964–1966, Secretary of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]] (1959) and member of the 5th Convocation of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], deputy to the Supreme Soviet of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]]. He died on 31 December 1985.

'''Guilhèm Adèr''' (in [[French language]] ''Guilhem Ader''  ; [[Gimont]] ?, 1567 ? - [[Gimont]], 1638) was an [[Occitan language]] writer from [[Gascony]]. He is the author of a book a maxims inspired from [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] (''Lo Catonet Gascon'') and of an epic poem dedicated to [[Henry IV of France|Henry III of Navarre and IV France]] in 2690 [[Alexandrine verse]]s.

He was born in [[Gimont]], [[Gascony]]. He studied in [[Toulouse]] and became a physician and served in the Duc of Joyeuse's army. Afterward he settle back in [[Gimont]] where he married Magdalena de Lux and had a daughter and son.

In [[linguistics]], '''Heaps' law''' (also called '''Herdan's law''') is an [[empirical law]] which describes the number of distinct words in a document (or set of documents) as a function of the document length (so called type-token relation). It can be formulated as

:&lt;math&gt; V_R(n) = Kn^\beta &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of distinct words in an instance text of size ''n''. ''K'' and β are free parameters determined empirically. With English [[text corpus|text corpora]], typically ''K'' is between 10 and 100, and β is between 0.4 and 0.6.

The law is frequently attributed to [[Harold Stanley Heaps]], but was originally discovered by {{harvs|first=Gustav|last=Herdan|year=1960|txt}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Egghe|2007}}: "Herdan's law in linguistics and Heaps' law in information retrieval are different formulations of the same phenomenon".&lt;/ref&gt; Under mild assumptions, the Herdan–Heaps law is asymptotically equivalent to [[Zipf's law]] concerning the frequencies of individual words within a text.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kornai|1999}}; {{harvtxt|Baeaza-Yates|Navarro|2000}}; {{harvtxt|van Leijenhorst|van der Weide|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a consequence of the fact that the type-token relation (in general) of a homogenous text can be derived from the distribution of its types.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Milička|2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heaps' law means that as more instance text is gathered, there will be diminishing returns in terms of discovery of the full vocabulary from which the distinct terms are drawn.

Heaps' law also applies to situations in which the "vocabulary" is just some set of distinct types which are attributes of some collection of objects. For example, the objects could be people, and the types could be country of origin of the person. If persons are selected randomly (that is, we are not selecting based on country of origin), then Heaps' law says we will quickly have representatives from most countries (in proportion to their population) but it will become increasingly difficult to cover the entire set of countries by continuing this method of sampling.

{{Certainty}}

A '''hypothesis''' (plural '''hypotheses''') is a proposed [[explanation]] for a [[phenomenon]]. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the [[scientific method]] requires that one can [[testable|test]] it. [[Scientist]]s generally base scientific hypotheses on previous [[observation]]s that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words "hypothesis" and "[[theory]]" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a [[scientific theory]]. A [[working hypothesis]] is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further [[research]],&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"/&gt; in a process beginning with an educated guess or thought.&lt;ref name=Feynman /&gt; 

A different meaning of the term ''hypothesis'' is used in [[formal logic]], to denote the [[antecedent (logic)|antecedent]] of a [[proposition]]; thus in the proposition "If ''P'', then ''Q''", ''P'' denotes the hypothesis (or antecedent); ''Q'' can be called a [[consequent]]. ''P'' is the [[:wikt:assumption|assumption]] in a (possibly [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]]) ''[[wikt:what if|What If]]'' question.

The adjective ''hypothetical'', meaning "having the nature of a hypothesis", or "being assumed to exist as an immediate consequence of a hypothesis", can refer to any of these meanings of the term "hypothesis".

==Uses==

In its ancient usage, ''[[Hypothesis (drama)|hypothesis]]'' referred to a summary of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical drama]]. The English word ''hypothesis'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ὑπόθεσις|ὑπόθεσις]] word ''hupothesis'', meaning "to put under" or "to suppose".&lt;ref name="HilbornMangel1997"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hilborn |first1=Ray |last2=Mangel |first2=Marc |title=The ecological detective: confronting models with data |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=katmvQDi8PMC&amp;pg=PA24 |accessdate=22 August 2011 |year=1997 |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=978-0-691-03497-3 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Plato]]'s ''[[Meno]]'' (86e–87b), [[Socrates]] dissects [[virtue]] with a method used by mathematicians,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Wilbur Knorr|Wilbur R. Knorr]], "Construction as existence proof in ancient geometry", p. 125, as selected by Jean Christianidis (ed.), ''Classics in the history of Greek mathematics'', Kluwer.&lt;/ref&gt; that of "investigating from a hypothesis."&lt;ref&gt; [[Gregory Vlastos]], Myles Burnyeat (1994) ''Socratic studies'', Cambridge {{ISBN|0-521-44735-6}}, p. 1 &lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, 'hypothesis' refers to a clever idea or to a convenient mathematical approach that simplifies cumbersome [[calculation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"Neutral hypotheses, those of which the subject matter can never be directly proved or disproved, are very numerous in all sciences." — [[Morris Raphael Cohen|Morris Cohen]] and  [[Ernest Nagel]] (1934) ''An introduction to logic and scientific method'' p. 375. New York: Harcourt, Brace, and Company.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Bellarmine|Cardinal Bellarmine]] gave a famous example of this usage in the warning issued to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the early 17th century: that he must not treat the motion of the Earth as a reality, but merely as a hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;"Bellarmine (Ital. ''Bellarmino''), Roberto Francesco Romolo", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition.: 'Bellarmine did not proscribe the Copernican system ... all he claimed was that it should be presented as a hypothesis until it should receive scientific demonstration.' {{EB1911|wstitle=Hypothesis|volume=14|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common usage in the 21st century, a ''hypothesis'' refers to a provisional idea whose merit requires evaluation. For proper evaluation, the framer of a hypothesis needs to define specifics in operational terms. A hypothesis requires more work by the researcher in order to either confirm or disprove it. In due course, a confirmed hypothesis may become part of a theory or occasionally may grow to become a theory itself. Normally, scientific hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]].&lt;ref&gt;Crease, Robert P.  (2008) ''The Great Equations'' {{ISBN|978-0-393-06204-5}},  p.112 lists the [[conservation of energy]] as an example of accounting a [[constant of motion]]. Hypothesized by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], truth demonstrated by [[James Prescott Joule]], proven by [[Emmy Noether]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, but not always, one can also formulate them as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon under examination has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[Universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

In entrepreneurial science, a hypothesis is used to formulate provisional ideas within a business setting. The formulated hypothesis is then evaluated where either the hypothesis is proven to be "true" or "false" through a [[Authentication|verifiability]]- or [[falsifiability]]-oriented [[experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://hbr.org/2013/05/why-the-lean-start-up-changes-everything Harvard Business Review (2013) "Why Lean Startup Changes Everything"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://grasshopperherder.com/success-metric-vs-fail-condition-to-the-pain/ Tristan Kromer 2014 "Success Metric vs. Fail Condition"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leanstartup.pbworks.com/w/page/65946049/Intro%20to%20Lean%20Startup Lean Startup Circle "What is Lean Startup?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s by [[reasoning]] (including [[deductive reasoning]]). It might predict the outcome of an [[experiment]] in a [[laboratory]] setting or the observation of a phenomenon in [[nature]]. The prediction may also invoke statistics and only talk about probabilities. [[Karl Popper]], following others, has argued that a hypothesis must be [[falsificationism|falsifiable]], and that one cannot regard a proposition or theory as scientific if it does not admit the possibility of being shown false. Other philosophers of science have rejected the criterion of falsifiability or supplemented it with other criteria, such as verifiability (e.g., [[verificationism]]) or coherence (e.g., [[confirmation holism]]). The [[scientific method]] involves experimentation, to test the ability of some hypothesis to adequately answer the question under investigation. In contrast, unfettered observation is not as likely to raise unexplained issues or open questions in science, as would the formulation of a [[crucial experiment]] to test the hypothesis. A [[thought experiment]] might also be used to test the hypothesis as well.

In framing a hypothesis, the investigator must not currently know the outcome of a test or that it remains reasonably under continuing investigation. Only in such cases does the experiment, test or study potentially increase the probability of showing the truth of a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Popper1959"&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pp17,49–50}} If the researcher already knows the outcome, it counts as a "consequence" — and the researcher should have already considered this while formulating the hypothesis. If one cannot assess the predictions by observation or by [[experience]], the hypothesis needs to be tested by others providing observations. For example, a new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.

==Scientific hypothesis==
People refer to a trial solution to a problem as a hypothesis, often called an "[[educated guess]]"&lt;ref&gt;
"When it is not clear under which law of nature an effect or class of effect belongs, we try to fill this gap by means of a guess. Such guesses have been given the name ''conjectures'' or ''hypotheses''.", [[Hans Christian Ørsted]](1811) "First Introduction to General Physics" ¶18. ''Selected Scientific Works of Hans Christian Ørsted'', {{ISBN|0-691-04334-5}} p.297&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feynman &gt;"In general we look for a new law by the following process. First we guess it. ...", —[[Richard Feynman]] (1965) ''[[The Character of Physical Law]]'' p.156&lt;/ref&gt; because it provides a suggested outcome based on the evidence. However, some scientists reject the term "educated guess" as incorrect. Experimenters may test and reject several hypotheses before solving the problem.

According to Schick and Vaughn,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schick, Theodore |authorlink1=Theodore Schick |author2=Vaughn, Lewis |title=How to think about weird things: critical thinking for a New Age |publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education |location=Boston |year=2002 |isbn=0-7674-2048-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; researchers weighing up alternative hypotheses may take into consideration:
* [[Testability]] (compare [[falsifiability]] as discussed above)
* Parsimony (as in the application of "[[Occam's razor]]", discouraging the postulation of excessive numbers of [[entity|entities]])
* Scope – the apparent application of the hypothesis to multiple cases of [[Phenomenon|phenomena]]
* Fruitfulness – the prospect that a hypothesis may explain further phenomena in the future
* Conservatism – the degree of "fit" with existing recognized knowledge-systems.

==Working hypothesis==
{{main|Working hypothesis}}
A [[working hypothesis]] is a hypothesis that is provisionally accepted as a basis for further research&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of Sports Science &amp; Medicine''. [http://www.answers.com/topic/working-hypothesis Eprint] via Answers.com.&lt;/ref&gt; in the hope that a tenable theory will be produced, even if the hypothesis ultimately fails.&lt;ref name=Century&gt;See in "hypothesis", ''[[Century Dictionary]] Supplement'', v. 1, 1909, New York: [[The Century Company]]. Reprinted, [https://archive.org/stream/centurydictionar11whituoft#page/616/mode/1up v. 11, p. 616] (via ''Internet Archive'') of the ''Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia'', 1911. {{quote|'''hypothesis''' [...]—'''Working hypothesis''', a hypothesis suggested or supported in some measure by features of observed facts, from which consequences may be deduced which can be tested by experiment and special observations, and which it is proposed to subject to an extended course of such investigation, with the hope that, even should the hypothesis thus be overthrown, such research may lead to a tenable theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Like all hypotheses, a working hypothesis is constructed as a statement of expectations, which can be linked to the [[exploratory research]] purpose in empirical investigation. Working hypotheses are often used as a [[conceptual framework]] in qualitative research.&lt;ref&gt;

The provisional nature of working hypotheses make them useful as an organizing device in applied research. Here they act like a useful guide to address problems that are still in a formative phase.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]] and Nandhini Rangarajan. 2013. [https://books.google.com/books?id=tVYbAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Patricia+M.+Shields%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=c3iIU6X7HdOYyASjlIDwBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false.  ''A Playbook for Research Methods: Integrating Conceptual Frameworks and Project Management'']. Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. pp. 109–157&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, philosophers of science have tried to integrate the various approaches to evaluating hypotheses, and the scientific method in general, to form a more complete system that integrates the individual concerns of each approach. Notably, [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]], Karl Popper's colleague and student, respectively, have produced novel attempts at such a synthesis.

==Hypotheses, concepts and measurement==
[[Concept]]s in Hempel's [[deductive-nomological model]] play a key role in the development and testing of hypotheses. Most formal hypotheses connect concepts by specifying the expected relationships between [[proposition]]s. When a set of hypotheses are grouped together they become a type of [[conceptual framework]]. When a [[conceptual framework]] is complex and incorporates causality or explanation it is generally referred to as a theory. According to noted philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]] "An adequate empirical interpretation turns a theoretical system into a testable theory: The hypothesis whose constituent terms have been interpreted become capable of test by reference to observable phenomena. Frequently the interpreted hypothesis will be derivative hypotheses of the theory; but their confirmation or disconfirmation by empirical data will then immediately strengthen or weaken also the primitive hypotheses from which they were derived."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Hempel provides a useful metaphor that describes the relationship between a [[conceptual framework]] and the framework as it is observed and perhaps tested (interpreted framework).  "The whole system floats, as it were, above the plane of observation and is anchored to it by rules of interpretation. These might be viewed as strings which are not part of the network but link certain points of the latter with specific places in the plane of observation. By virtue of those interpretative connections, the network can function as a scientific theory."&lt;ref&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Hypotheses with concepts anchored in the plane of observation are ready to be tested. In "actual scientific practice the process of framing a theoretical structure and of interpreting it are not always sharply separated, since the intended interpretation usually guides the construction of the theoretician."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"&gt;Hempel, C. G. (1952). Fundamentals of concept formation in empirical science. Chicago, Illinois: The University of Chicago Press, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, "possible and indeed desirable, for the purposes of logical clarification, to separate the two steps conceptually."&lt;ref name="Hempel, C. G. 1952 p. 33"/&gt;

===Statistical hypothesis testing===
{{Main|Statistical hypothesis testing}}
When a possible [[correlation]] or similar relation between phenomena is investigated, such as whether a proposed remedy is effective in treating a disease, the hypothesis that a relation exists cannot be examined the same way one might examine a proposed new law of nature. In such an investigation, if the tested remedy shows no effect in a few cases, these do not necessarily falsify the hypothesis. Instead, [[statistical test]]s are used to determine how likely it is that the overall effect would be observed if the hypothesized relation does not exist. If that likelihood is sufficiently small (e.g., less than 1%), the existence of a relation may be assumed. Otherwise, any observed effect may be due to pure chance.

In statistical hypothesis testing, two hypotheses are compared. These are called the [[null hypothesis]] and the [[alternative hypothesis]]. The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that states that there is no relation between the phenomena whose relation is under investigation, or at least not of the form given by the alternative hypothesis. The alternative hypothesis, as the name suggests, is the alternative to the null hypothesis: it states that there ''is'' some kind of relation. The alternative hypothesis may take several forms, depending on the nature of the hypothesized relation; in particular, it can be two-sided (for example: there is ''some'' effect, in a yet unknown direction) or one-sided (the direction of the hypothesized relation, positive or negative, is fixed in advance).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 8.5,]&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional significance levels for testing hypotheses (acceptable probabilities of wrongly rejecting a true null hypothesis) are .10, .05, and .01. The significance level for deciding whether the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted must be determined in advance, before the observations are collected or inspected. If these criteria are determined later, when the data to be tested are already known, the test is invalid.&lt;ref name="Mellenbergh, 2008"&gt;Mellenbergh, G.J.(2008). Chapter 8: Research designs: Testing of research hypotheses. In [[H.J. Adèr]] &amp; [[Gideon J. Mellenbergh|G.J. Mellenbergh]] (Eds.) (with contributions by D.J. Hand), Advising on Research Methods: A consultant's companion (pp. 183-209). Huizen, The Netherlands: Johannes van Kessel Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

The above procedure is actually dependent on the number of the participants (units or [[sample size]]) that are included in the study. For instance, to avoid having the sample size be too small to reject a null hypothesis, it is recommended that one specify a sufficient sample size from the beginning. It is advisable to define a small, medium and large effect size for each of a number of important statistical tests which are used to test the hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v-walRnRxWQC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;dq=statistical+hypothesis+medical&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oFm-U_CbLYexPIragIAB&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=statistical%20hypothesis%20medical&amp;f=false Altman. DG., ''Practical Statistics for Medical Research'', CRC Press, 1990, Section 15.3,]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Association of Conference Interpreters - AIIC''' (AIIC – Association internationale des interprètes de conférence) was founded in 1953. &lt;ref&gt;Naissance d'une profession&lt;/ref&gt; It represents over 3,000 members present in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://aiic.net/page/1673/aiic-an-inclusive-and-representative-professional-body/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
==Overview==
AIIC is the only global association of conference interpreters. Since the very early days of modern conference interpreting, AIIC has promoted high standards of quality and ethics in the profession and represented the interests of its practitioners.

AIIC is active in all areas affecting conference interpreting and works for the benefit of all conference interpreters and for the profession as a whole.
AIIC sets professional and ethical standards for the profession and promotes the working conditions that high quality interpreting requires. The Association also contributes its expertise to ensure that future generations of interpreters will be trained to today's high standards.

The association has a strict admissions procedure based on a peer review system, intended to guarantee high-quality [[interpreting]] and professionalism. Candidates must be sponsored by interpreters who have been AIIC members for at least five years. AIIC members are required to abide by the association’s code of ethics and its professional standards&lt;ref&gt;https://aiic.net/page/6724/&lt;/ref&gt;. 
==Partnerships==
AIIC liaises with a number of international organisations (e.g., the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[United Nations]]) and negotiates the working conditions for all of their non-staff interpreters, including non-members. The AIIC goals are to secure acceptable working conditions for interpreters, to ensure professional interpretation, and to raise public awareness of the interpreting profession. It is also involved in other areas of the profession, such as:
* programmes for young conference interpreters - VEGA;&lt;ref&gt;http://aiic.net/vega/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
* continuing professional development;
* standardisation;
* new technologies in conference interpretation;
* court and legal interpretation;
* interpretation in conflict areas, and 
* "preservation of World Linguistic Heritage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://aiic.net/ViewPage.cfm?article_id=489&amp;plg=1&amp;slg=1 AIIC Declaration on the Preservation of World Linguistic Heritage].&lt;/ref&gt;

AIIC has joined forces with [[IAPTI]], [[Red T]] and [[International Federation of Translators|FIT]] in an effort to put pressure on governments to ensure the long-term safety of linguists who served their troops in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fit-ift.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Open-Letter_Feb-2013_USA.pdf |title=Open Letter Protecting Translators and Interpreters Worldwide |publisher=[[International Federation of Translators]] |accessdate=16 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
AIIC issues a [[webzine]] named '''''Communicate!'''''.

''Naissance d'une profession'' [Birth of a Profession]: a book describing conference interpreting from its beginnings in the early 20th century to the present. (2013)

{{main|Kiowa language}}
The most thorough treatment of the '''[[Kiowa language|Kiowa]] [[phonology|sound system]]''' is by Laurel Watkins in a [[generative linguistics|generative]] framework. A consideration of prosodic phenomena with [[Acoustic phonetics|acoustic]] analysis is in Sivertsen (1956). Earlier discussions of [[phonemics]] are Trager (1960), Merrifield (1959), Wonderly et al. (1954), and Harrington (1928).

* The [[Voiced labio-velar approximant|labio-velar]] glide {{IPA|[w]}} is only found in [[Comanche language|Comanche]] [[loanword]]s or in some [[interjection]]s like {{IPA|[wéː]}} (an expression used to welcome travelers).&lt;ref&gt;Sounds restricted to interjections are usually considered marginal. Compare the use of a [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} in ''whew!'' or a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} in ''ugh!'' in [[American English]].&lt;/ref&gt; A [[phonetic]] {{IPA|[w]}} [[offglide]] also occurs after the mid back vowel {{IPA|/o/}}.
* The [[voiceless palatal fricative|palatal fricative]] {{IPA|ç}} is found only in two cognate roots, the singular and nonsingular suppletive pair for 'small', ''syáun'' {{IPA|[çɔ̃́n]}} and ''syân'' {{IPA|[çæ̃̂n]}} (as well as in their derivatives, like the adverbials ''syáundé'' 'a little', ''syândè'' 'in small portions').  The pronunciation {{IPA|[sj]}} is occasionally heard for {{angbr|sy}}, suggesting that {{IPA|[ç]}} might arise by assimilation from {{IPA|/sj/}}.
* Voiceless {{IPA|/p, t/}} when followed by another consonant (and, thus, also syllable-final) are typically reduced to a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. In careful speech, the bilabial and dental articulations are preserved. Example: ''bat fā́u'' {{IPA|/batpɔ́ː/}} ('eat' imperfective, 2nd person singular') is {{IPA|[baʔpɔ́ː]}} in casual speech.
* Ejectives {{IPA|/pʼ, tʼ, tsʼ, kʼ/}} are strongly articulated.&lt;ref&gt;This is in contrast to the ejectives in the distantly related [[Taos language|Taos]], which are weakly articulated.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Glottal stops''.
** The [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|/ʔ/}} is typically deleted in normal speech. However, in carefully articulated citation forms, the glottal stop is retained. For example, the word ''v&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;u&lt;u&gt;ā́&lt;/u&gt;u'' {{IPA|/pʼɔ̃́ʔɔ̃́ː/}} ('wash') is usually pronounced {{IPA|[pʼɔ̃́ː]}} in connected speech.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins notes the stress may affect the retention of the glottal stop although stress and its effect require further research.&lt;/ref&gt;
** Phonetic glottal stops are also automatically inserted after [[morpheme]]-final short vowels before [[concatenation]].
** Other phonetic glottal stops are [[allophone]]s of syllable-final oral stops {{IPA|/p, t/}} (see above)&lt;ref&gt;Note that {{IPA|/p, t/}} are the only oral stops that occur in syllable-final position. (See the [[#Syllable and phonotactics|syllable section]].)&lt;/ref&gt; or a [[phonation]] effect of the falling tone.
* Velar consonants palatalize before the low front vowel {{IPA|/a/}}.  This vowel then fronts further to {{IPA|[æ]}} (see Vowels below).  Being automatic (like aspiration in English), this palatalization is not indicated in McKenzie's orthography.  Examples with all four velars are: ''qám'' {{IPA|[kʲʼæ̃́m]}} ('lazy'), ''cáp'' {{IPA|[kʲǽp]}} ('onwards'), ''kál'' {{IPA|[kʲʰǽᵈl]}} ('wet'), ''-gà'' {{IPA|[ɡʲæ]}} ('in').  (Exceptions to this rule arise only in loanwords and are indicated by an apostrophe: ''c'ā́bòlī̀'' {{IPA|[káːbòlìː]}} 'sheep', ''c'átlìn'' {{IPA|[kǽtlɪ̃n]}} 'sharpshooter'.)
* The dental [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/n, l/}} were [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized]] {{IPA|[nʲ, lʲ]}} before the high front vowel {{IPA|/i/}} in previous generations, though this is not generally heard in current elder’s speech: ''b&lt;u&gt;ṓ&lt;/u&gt;nî'' {{IPA|/bṍːnîː/}} ('see' (imperfective hearsay) pronounced as {{IPA|[bṍːwnʲĩ̂ː]}}, ''tàlī́'' {{IPA|/tʰàlíː/}} ('boy') pronounced as {{IPA|[tʰàlʲíː]}}.
* Lateral {{IPA|/l/}} is slightly [[affricated]] at the end of [[syllable]]s as {{IPA|[ᵈl]}}. At the end of [[utterance]]s, the affricate is partially devoiced. Examples: ''gúldā̀u'' {{IPA|/ɡúldɔ̀ː/}} ('to be red') pronounced as {{IPA|[ɡúᵈldɔ̀ː]}}, ''sál'' {{IPA|/sál/}} ('to be hot') pronounced as {{IPA|[sáᵈ̥l̥]}}.
* The nasality of the vowels spreads onto following offglides: ''k&lt;u&gt;á&lt;/u&gt;ui'' {{IPA|/kʰɔ̃́j/}} ('bark, rind') is {{IPA|[kʰɔ̃́ȷ̃]}}.

===Vowels===

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Kiowa has six contrasting [[vowel]] qualities with three heights and a front-back distinction. Additionally, there is an oral-[[nasalization|nasal]] contrast on all six vowels. For example, nasality is the only difference between ''ā́u'' {{IPA|/ʔɔ́ː/}} ('to gamble') and ''&lt;u&gt;ā́&lt;/u&gt;u'' {{IPA|/ʔɔ̃́ː/}} ('to give').

The oral-nasal contrast, however, is [[Phoneme#Neutralization, archiphoneme, underspecification|neutralized]] in the environment of [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]], where only nasalized vowels occur. Watkins phonemicizes an oral vowel in these contexts: ''mā́'' {{IPA|/máː/}} ('up') is phonetically {{IPA|[mã́ː]}}, ''máun'' {{IPA|/mɔ́n/}} ('probably') is phonetically {{IPA|[mɔ̃́n]}}.

Kiowa vowels have an underlying two-way length contrast (short vs. long). However, a number of phonological issues restrict the length contrast. (See the [[#Syllable and phonotactics|syllable and phonotactics]] for details.)

* The high vowels {{IPA|/i, u/}} are lowered to {{IPA|[ɪ, ʊ]}} when they occur before nasal consonants {{IPA|/m, n/}}: ''bímkàui'' {{IPA|/bímkʰɔ̀j/}} ('bag') is phonetically {{IPA|[bɪ̃́mkʰɔ̀j]}}, ''gún'' {{IPA|/ɡún/}} ('to dance' perfective) is phonetically {{IPA|[ɡʊ̃́n]}}.
* Long mid vowels {{IPA|/eː, oː/}} are followed by [[homorganic]] offglides: ''hḗbà'' {{IPA|/héːbà/}} ('to enter') is pronounced as {{IPA|[héːjbà]}}, ''jṓcà'' {{IPA|/tóːkià/}} ('at the house') is phonetically {{IPA|[tóːwkjæ̀]}}. The offglides are considered sub-phonemic as they are predictable.
* Low {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is only slightly [[Roundedness|rounded]] — its position varying between [[Open-mid back rounded vowel|lower-mid]] to [[Open back rounded vowel|low]] {{IPA|[ɔ~ɒ]}}. When it is short and in open syllables, it is [[Centralization (phonetics)|centralized]] approaching [[Open-mid central rounded vowel|central]] {{IPA|[ɞ]}}: ''dàufôm'' {{IPA|/dɔ̀pôm/}} ('despicable') → {{IPA|[dɞ̀pôm]}} .
* The {{IPA|/a/}} of the diphthong {{IPA|/ia/}} is fronted and raised when long as {{IPA|[æː]}} and is raised further when it precedes a nasal consonant: ''q&lt;u&gt;ā́&lt;/u&gt;h&lt;u&gt;ĩ̂&lt;/u&gt;'' {{IPA|/kʼiã́ːhĩ̂ː/}} ('man') → {{IPA|[kʼjæ̃́ːhĩ̂ː]}}, ''qám'' {{IPA|/kʼiám/}} ('to be lazy') → {{IPA|[kʼjɛ̃́m]}}.
*Vowel length is only contrastive in open syllables.  Closed syllables only have phonetic short vowels. Underlying long vowels are shortened in this position (note morphophonemic alternations).
&lt;!-- Kiowa also has four [[diphthong]]s of the form ''vowel'' + {{IPA|/j/}}.

Kiowa has three tones: ''high'', ''low'', ''falling''.  No minimal triple is available, but the distinctions can be illustrated pairwise: ''à'' ~ ''á'' (agreement prefixes for 1sg and 3pl unaccusatives), ''&lt;u&gt;ḕ&lt;/u&gt;'' ('when') ~ ''&lt;u&gt;ḗ&lt;/u&gt;'' ('here'); ''àl'' ('also)' ~ ''âl'' ('chase' perfective imperative), ''ch&lt;u&gt;ḕ&lt;/u&gt;'' ('when') ~ ''ch&lt;u&gt;ê&lt;/u&gt;'' ('horse'); ''cául'' ('cattle')~ ''câul'' ('some'), ''gṹ''('wise') ~ ''gû'' ('hit').  Note that length is not indicated on vowels with falling tone in the current orthography: this is because falling tone is generally only realized over long vowels or a vowel plus resonant ({{IPA|/j/}}, {{IPA|/l/}}, {{IPA|/m/}}, or {{IPA|/n/}}).  However, there are at least two words with falling tone realized before {{IPA|/t/}}, both of them minimally contrastive with high tone: ''bót'' ('guts') ~ ''bôt'' ('because'), ''chát'' ('door') ~ ''chât'' ('cheque').  This behaviour contrasts with {{IPA|/p/}}; suffixation of {{IPA|/p/}} to verbs with falling tone causes the vowel to shorten and become simply high, as in root ~ perfective pairs ''gû'' ~ ''góp'' ('hit'), ''kî'' ~ ''tép'' ('exit').  One speaker has been recorded with the pronunciation {{IPA|[êtʼ]}} ('big') in contrast to other speakers' {{IPA|[ét]}} (the compounding form, ''êl'', as in ''êlmā̀'' 'old woman', has falling tone).

The falling tone has glottalized realizations ([[creaky voice]], [[tense voice]], with [[glottal stop]]) in some contexts.

There are also a number of [[tone sandhi]] effects.

===Syllable and phonotactics===

Surface [[syllable]]s in Kiowa must consist of a vowel nucleus. [[Syllable onset]]s are optional and can consist of single consonant or a consonant followed by a palatal glide {{IPA|[j]}}. A single vowel may be followed by an optional [[syllable coda]] consonant or the vowel may optionally be long. Thus, the following syllables are found in Kiowa: {{IPA|V, CV, CjV, VC, CVC, CjVC, Vː, CVː, CjVː}}. This can be succinctly represented as the syllable equation below.

:&lt;math&gt;\left ( C \right ) \left ( j \right ) V \left ( \begin{Bmatrix}
  C \\
  \text{ː}
\end{Bmatrix} \right ) + Tone&lt;/math&gt;

A number of [[phonotactic]] restrictions are found limiting the possible combinations of sounds. These are discussed below.

'''Onset.''' All consonants can occurs as a single consonant onset.  However, {{IPA|/l/}} only occurs word-initially in loan words (e.g., ''láyàn'' 'lion', ''Láut'' 'Lawton').

'''Nucleus'''. The [[syllable nucleus]] can be any vowel, which can be either short or long.

'''Coda.''' The coda position may be filled only by {{IPA|/p, t, m, n, l, j/}}. Palatal {{IPA|/j/}} only follows the vowels {{IPA|/u, o, ɔ, a/}} (i.e. the palatal may not occur after non-low front vowels).&lt;ref&gt;A phonetic palatal glide does follow mid-front {{IPA|/e/}}, but this is not considered phonemic and parallels the similar {{IPA|[w]}} off-glide following mid-back {{IPA|/o/}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Molter Karoly.jpg|thumb|right|Károly Molter]]
'''Károly Molter''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈkaːroj ˈmoltɛr}}; 2 December 1890 &amp;ndash; 30 November 1981) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] novelist, dramatist, literary critic, journalist and academic. He spent most of his life in the region of [[Transylvania]], being successively a national of [[Austria-Hungary]] and Romania.

==Biography==
Born in [[Vrbas (town)|Óverbász (Vrbas)]], [[Vojvodina]] region, Molter was from an [[ethnic German]] ([[Danube Swabians|Danube Swabian]]) family, but adopted [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] as his language.&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"&gt;{{ro icon}} Lucian Nastasă, Levente Salat (eds.), [http://www.edrc.ro/docs/docs/eticaminoritara/IntregVolumul.pdf ''Maghiarii din România şi etica minoritară (1920-1940)''], p.236, at the [http://www.edrc.ro/ Ethnocultural Diversity Resource Center. Open Society Foundation Romania]; retrieved September 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He studied at the College of [[Kecskemét]], and then at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] Faculty of Philosophy in Letter (the Hungarian-German section).&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt;

In 1913, he moved to Transylvania, settling down in [[Târgu Mureş|Marosvásárhely (Târgu Mureş)]].&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt; Between 1913 and 1945, he was a teacher in the [[Bolyai Gymnasium]], a [[Reformed Church in Romania|Reformed Church]] college in the city.&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt; In the [[interwar period]], after the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he became a member of the ''[[Erdélyi Helikon]]'' group in [[Brâncoveneşti, Mureş|Marosvécs (Brâncoveneşti)]], as well as sitting on the editorial staff of ''Zord Idő'' magazine.&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt; In 1937, he published one of his most successful works, the novel ''Tibold Márton'', which depicted a Swabian family in the process of adopting [[Culture of Hungary|Hungarian culture]], as well as the problems faced by ethnic minorities in their relation to the majority.&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt;

After 1945, Molter was employed by the [[Babeş-Bolyai University|Bolyai faculty]] in [[Cluj-Napoca|Cluj]], where he lectured in German language and [[German literature|literature]].&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt; Retiring in 1950, he moved back to Târgu Mureș, and died there 31 years later.&lt;ref name="eticaminoritara"/&gt;

'''Language coordination''' is the tendency of people to [[mimic]] the language of others. The coordination occurs when one person responds to another using similar vocabulary, or word or sentence structure. Language coordination can also be applied to individuals who linguistically coordinate to a group. As suggested by the [[communication accommodation theory]], this is often used as a way to reduce social distance (convergence). Language coordination often occurs [[unconsciously]].

'''Left-wing populism''' is a [[political ideology]] that combines [[left-wing politics]] and [[Populism|populist]] rhetoric and themes. The rhetoric of left-wing populism often consists of [[anti-elitist]] sentiments, opposition to [[the Establishment]] and speaking for the "[[common people]]".&lt;ref name="AM p123"&gt;Albertazzi and McDonnell, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The important themes for left-wing populists usually include [[anti-capitalism]], [[social justice]], [[pacifism]] and [[anti-globalization]], whereas [[Social class|class society]] ideology or [[Socialism|socialist]] theory is not as important as it is to traditional left-wing parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaslove|first=Andrej|date=June 2008|title=Here to Stay?

With the rise of Greek [[Syriza]] and Spanish [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] during the [[European debt crisis]], there has been increased debate on new left-wing populism in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mudde|first=Cas|date=17 February 2015|title=The problem with populism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/problem-populism-syriza-podemos-dark-side-europe|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zabala|first=Santiago|date=2 December 2014|title=In Europe, not all populist parties are the same|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/12/podemos-spain-politicspopulismeurope.html|newspaper=AlJazeera|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[leftist]] and [[populist]] political parties in Europe belong to the [[European United Left–Nordic Green Left]].
==== Germany ====
[[File:Oskar lafontaine hamm.jpg|thumb|[[Oskar Lafontaine]], member of [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]]]]
The [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] was explicitly studied under left-wing populism, especially by German academics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Lange|first=Sarah|date=December 2005|title=Political extremism in Europe|journal=European Political Science|volume=4|pages=476–488|doi=10.1057/palgrave.eps.2210056}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was formed after the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]] and it was similar to [[Right-wing populism|right-wing populists]] in that it relied on anti-elitism and media attention provided by a charismatic leadership.&lt;ref name="p132"&gt;Albertazzi and McDonnell, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; The party competed for the same voter base with the right-wing populists to some extent, although it relied on a more serious platform in Eastern Germany. This was limited by anti-immigration sentiments preferred by some voters, although the lines were for example crossed by [[Oskar Lafontaine]], who used a term previously associated with the [[Nazi Party]], ''Fremdarbeiter'' ("foreign workers"), in his election campaign in 2005.&lt;ref name="p132"/&gt; The PDS merged into the [[The Left (Germany)|Left Party]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi and McDonnell, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Greece ====
[[Syriza]], which became the largest party since [[Greek legislative election, January 2015|January 2015 elections]], has been described as a left-wing populist party after their platform incorporated most demands of the popular movements in Greece during the [[Greek government-debt crisis|government-debt crisis]]. Populist traits in Syriza's platform include growing importance of "the People" in their rhetoric and "us/the people against them/the establishment" antagonism in campaigning. On immigration and [[LGBT rights]], Syriza is inclusionary. Syriza itself does not accept the label "populist".&lt;ref name="Stavrakaki"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stavrakaki|first=Yannis|last2=Katsambekis|first2=Giorgos|date=June 2014|title=Left-wing populism in the European periphery: the case of SYRIZA|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13569317.2014.909266|journal=Journal of Political Ideologies|volume=19|issue=2|pages=119–142|doi=10.1080/13569317.2014.909266|accessdate=22 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Yiannos|last=Katsourides|title=Radical Left Parties in Government: The Cases of SYRIZA and AKEL|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2016|pages=103ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The left-wing populist party [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] achieved 8 percent of the national vote in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Spain)|2014 European Parliament election]]. Due to avoiding [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] language typical with right-wing populists, Podemos is able to attract all leftist voters disappointed with the [[political establishment]] without taking sides in the regional political struggle.&lt;ref name="Torre2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carlos de la Torre|title=The Promise and Perils of Populism: Global Perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_ybJBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA211|date=11 December 2014|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-4687-4|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Spanish general election, 2015|2015 election for the national parliament]], Podemos reached 20.65% of the vote and became the third largest party in the parliament after the conservative [[People's Party (Spain)|People's Party]] with 28.71% and the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] with 22.02%. In the new parliament, Podemos holds 69 out of 350 seats and this result ended the traditional [[two-party system]] of Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/spanien-die-ersten-hochrechnungen-zur-parlamentswahl-a-1068834.html ''Entscheidung in Spanien: Konservative sind Wahlsieger, verlieren aber Mehrheit''].

[[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] (the [[President of Argentina]] from 2007 to 2015) and her husband [[Néstor Kirchner]] were said to practice [[Kirchnerism]], a variant of Peronism that was often mentioned alongside other early [[Pink tide|21st century Latin American left-wing populist movements]] in Boliva and Venezuela. During Cristina Fernández de Kirchner time in office, she often engaged in [[Criticism of the United States government|criticism of the United States]], gave speeches with anti-globalization overtones and sought to form economic alliances with non-Western countries such as China and Russia, with some degree of success.{{citation needed|reason=Does not specify which success|date=November 2015}} She has also repeatedly spoken against capitalism in general. Her administration was characterized by marked tax increases, especially on agricultural produce, [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina's main export]]. In 2009, she instated the [[universal allocation per child]] subsidy (commonly referred to as AUH in Argentina, ''Asignación Universal por Hijo''), a [[means-tested benefit]] to families with children who qualified for the program (despite its name, the AUH is not a universal subsidy).

==== Bolivia ====
The leadership of [[Siles Zuazo]] practiced left-wing populism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mayorga |first=Rene Antonio|last2= |first2= |date=January 1997 |title= Bolivia's Silent Revolution |url= |journal=Journal of Democracy  |publisher= |volume= 8 |issue=1 |pages=142–156 |doi=10.1353/jod.1997.0006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as that of incumbent socialist [[President of Bolivia|President]] [[Evo Morales]].&lt;ref name="Hawkins" /&gt;

==== Ecuador ====
[[Rafael Correa]], the [[President of Ecuador]], has stressed the importance of a "populist discourse" and has integrated technocrats to work within this context for the common Ecuadorians. In the conflict between the indigenous peoples and the government, Correa has blamed foreign [[non-governmental organization]]s for exploiting the indigenous people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=de la Torre |first=Carlos |date=2013 |title=Populismus in Lateinamerika.

==== Venezuela ====
The presidency of [[Hugo Chávez]] resembled a combination of folk wisdom and charismatic leadership with doctrinaire socialism.&lt;ref name="Hawkins"&gt;Kirk Andrew Hawkins, ''Venezuela's Chavismo and Populism in Comparative Perspective''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-521-76503-9}}, page 84&lt;/ref&gt; Chávez's government was also described to have been a "throwback" to populist nationalism and redistributivism.&lt;ref name="Daniel Hellinger 2003, page 67"&gt;[[Steve Ellner]] &amp; Daniel Hellinger, eds., ''Venezuelan politics in the Chávez era: class, polarization, and conflict''.

{{Culture of Somalia}}

'''Maay Maay''' (also known as ''Af-Maay'', ''Af-Maymay'', ''Rahanween'', ''Rahanweyn'' or simply ''Maay'', and sometimes spelled ''Mai Mai'') is a dialect of the Somali language of the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] branch of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family. It is spoken mostly in [[Somalia]] and adjacent parts of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Kenya]]. Its speakers are known as [[Rahanweyn|Sab]] Somalis. The centre of the dialect is around [[Baidoa]]. The dialect is written using the [[Latin script]].

==Overview==
Somali linguistic varieties are divided into three main groups: Northern, [[Benadiri Somali|Benadir]] and Maay. Northern Somali (or Northern-Central Somali) forms the basis for Standard Somali.&lt;ref name="Dalby"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Dalby|1998|p=571}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maay is principally spoken by the Digil and Mirifle ([[Rahanweyn]] or Sab) clans in the southern regions of [[Somalia]].&lt;ref name="Dalby"/&gt; Its speech area extends from the southwestern border with [[Ethiopia]] to a region close to the coastal strip between [[Mogadishu]] and [[Kismayo]], including the city of [[Baidoa]].&lt;ref name="Saeed"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeed|first=John|year=1999|title=Somali|location=Amsterdam|publisher=John Benjamins|page=4|isbn=1-55619-224-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maay is not [[mutually comprehensible]] with Northern Somali or [[Benadiri Somali|Benadir]], and it differs considerably in sentence structure and phonology.&lt;ref name="Ethnymm"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maay - A language of Somalia|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/ymm|publisher=Ethnologue|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also not generally used in education or media. However, Maay speakers often use Standard Somali as a [[lingua franca]],&lt;ref name="Saeed"/&gt; which is learned via mass communications, internal migration and urbanisation.&lt;ref name="Ethnymm"/&gt;

==Grammar==

===Sounds===
Maay Maay exhibits significant amounts of [[epenthesis]], inserting central or high-central vowels to break up consonant clusters. Vowel length is contrastive; minimal pairs such as ''bur'' 'flour' and ''buur'' 'mountain' are attested.

===Words===
Maay Maay is fairly [[agglutinative]]. It has complex verb forms, inflecting at least for tense/aspect and person/number of both subject and object. There is also a prefix indicating negation. In addition, verbs exhibit derivational morphology, including a [[causative]] and an [[Applicative voice|applicative]]. Nominal morphology includes a [[definiteness]] suffix, whose form depends on the gender of the head noun, and possessive suffixes.

===Sentences===
Maay Maay exhibits [[Word order|SVO]] and SOV word orders, apparently in fairly free variation. When the object is postverbal, the prefix ''maay'' appears on the verb. Within the noun phrase, the [[head noun]] is generally initial. Possessors, adjectives and some strong quantifiers follow the head noun. Numerals and the indefinite quantifier precede the head noun.

Syllables in Maká may be of types V, VC, CV, CCV, and CCVC.  When a consonant cluster appears at the beginning of a syllable, the second consonant must be /x/, /h/, /w/, or /y/.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===

====Gender====
Maká has two genders—masculine and feminine.  The demonstratives reflect the gender of a noun (Gerzenstein 1995:153:
{|class='wikitable'
!colspan='2'|'''Masculine nouns'''!! colspan="2" |'''Feminine nouns'''
|-
|na’ ||sehe’||ne'||naxkax		
|-
|dem:masc||	land||dem:fem||tree
|-
|colspan='2'|‘this land’|| colspan="2" |'this tree'
|-
|na'	||nunax	||ne'||nunax
|-
|dem:masc	||dog||dem:fem||dog
|-
| colspan="2" |‘this (male) dog'|| colspan="2" |‘this (female) dog'
|}

In the plural the gender distinction is neutralized, and the plural demonstrative is the same as the feminine singular:

ne’	sehe-l		
these	land-pl
‘these lands’

ne’	naxkak-wi	
these	tree-pl
‘these trees’

====Number====

Maká nouns inflect for plurality.  There are several distinct plural endings: -l, -wi, Vts, and -Vy.  All plants take the -wi plural, but otherwise the choice seems to be unpredictable (Gerzenstein 1995:150):
{| class="wikitable"
!singular!!plural!!gloss
|-
| sehe|| sehe-l||land(s)
|-
| naxkax || naxkax-wi||tree(s)
|-
| tenuk || tenuk-its||cat(s)
|}

====Case====
Maká does not have any overt case marking on nouns.  Consider the following sentence, where neither the subject nor object shows any case (Gerzenstein 1995:139):

{|class="wikitable"
|Ne’ ||efu|| Ø-tux|| ka’|| sehets.
|-
|dem:f|| woman|| A3-eat|| indef:m|| fish
|-
|colspan='5'|‘The woman eats fish.’ 
|}

====Agreement with the possessor====

Nouns agree with their possessor in person (Gerzenstein 1995:148):

{|class='wikitable' 
|'''y'''-exi’||'''Ø'''-exi’||'''ł'''-exi’||'''in'''-exi’	
|-
|1s-mouth||2-mouth||3-mouth||1plur:incl-mouth
|-
|‘my mouth’||'your mouth'||'his/her/their mouth'||'our (inclusive) mouth'
|}

===Verbs===

====Agreement with subject and object====
Verbs agree with their subject and object in a rather complex system.  Gerzenstein (1995) identifies five conjugation classes for intransitive verbs.  The following two examples show intransitive verbs from conjugation classes 1 and 3.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! colspan='2'|tremble (conjugation class 3)  !! !! !! colspan='2'|dance (conjugation class 1)
|-
| 1 || '''tsi'''-kawelik ||'I tremble'  ||  || '''hoy'''-otoy||'I dance'
|-
| 2 || '''łan'''-kawelik || 'you tremble' || || '''ł'''-otoy||'you dance'
|-
|3 || '''yi'''-kawelik || 'he/she trembles' ||  || '''t'''-otoy||'he/she dances'
|-
| 1pl inclusive || '''xiyi'''-kawelik || 'we (inclusive) tremble' ||  || '''xit'''-otoy||'we (inclusive) dance'
|}

Transitive verbs belong to a different conjugation class, Conjugation 6.  The following forms show a transitive verb with a 3rd person object:

{|class='wikitable'
|-
! colspan='2'|love (conjugation class 6)
|-
|'''hi'''-su'un|| 'I love (him/her)'
|-
|'''łi'''-su'un|| 'you love (him/her)'
|-
|'''yi'''-su'un|| 'he/she loves (him/her)'
|-
|'''xite'''-su'un||'we (inclusive) love (him/her)'
|}

If the object of the transitive verb is 1st or 2nd person, then certain combinations of subject and object are shown by a portmanteau morpheme.

{|class='wikitable'
|-
! colspan='2'|love (conjugation class 6)|| subject/object combination
|-
|'''k'e'''-su'un|| 'I love you' ||1SUBJ›2OBJ
|-
|'''tsi'''-su'un||'he/she loves me'||3SUBJ›1OBJ
|-
|'''ne'''-su'un||'he/she loves you'||3SUBJ›2OBJ
|}

Other combinations involve an object agreement marker which may either precede or follow the subject marker (Gerzenstein 1995:94-101):

{|class='wikitable'
|'''łe-ts'''-ikfex
|-
|2:subj-1sg:obj-bite
|-
|'you bite me'
|-
|'''xi-yi'''-łin
|-
|1pl(incl):obj-3-save
|-
|'he/she saves us (inclusive)'
|}

====Applicatives====
Verbs in Maká have a series of suffixes called 'postpositions' in Gerzenstein (1995), which have the effect of introducing new oblique objects into the sentence.

The following examples show the applicative suffixes -ex 'instrumental ('with')' and -m 'benefactive ('for')'

{|class='wikitable'
|Ne’|| efu|| ni-xele-ex|| ke’|| ute||  na’|| nunax.
|-
|dem:f|| woman|| A3-throw-with|| indef:masc|| rock|| dem:m|| dog
|-
|colspan='7'|‘The woman threw a rock at the dog.’  
|}

{|class='wikitable'
|H-osxey-i-m ||na’|| sehets|| na’ ||k’utsaX
|-
|A1-grill-P3-for ||dem:m|| fish|| dem:m|| old:man
|-
|colspan='7'|‘I grill fish for the old man.’ 
|}

==Syntax==

===Noun phrases===

In noun phrases, the possessor precedes the possessed noun (Gerzenstein 1995:155):

{|class='wikitable'
|e-li-ts ||łe-xiła’ 		
|-
|2-child-pl|| 3-head
|-
|colspan='2'|'your children’s head'
|}

Noun phrases show the order (Demonstrative) (Numeral) (Adjective) N (Gerzenstein 1995:154):

{|class='wikitable'
|Ne’ || efu || t-aqhay-ets||ne’ ||ikwetxuł||fo’||tiptip-its
|-
|dem:fem||woman||S3-buy-toward||dem:plur||four|| white||horse=pl
|-
|colspan='7'|’The woman bought four white horses.’ 
|}

===Sentences===

====Affirmative====
The basic word order for a transitive clause in Maká is [[subject–verb–object]], as seen in the following example (Gerzenstein 1995:138)

{|class='wikitable'
|Ne’|| efu|| ni-xele-ex|| ke’|| ute||  na’|| nunax.
|-
|dem:f|| woman|| A3-throw-with|| indef:masc|| rock|| dem:m|| dog
|-
|colspan='7'|‘The woman threw a rock at the dog.’  
|}

For intransitive clauses, the basic order is verb-subject (Gerzenstein 1995:106):

{|class='wikitable'
|Wapi|| ne'|| efu.
|-
|rest || dem:f ||woman
|-
|colspan='7'|'The woman rests'
|}

====Interrogative====

In yes-no questions, the usual [[subject–verb–object]] order changes to [[verb-subject-object]] following an initial particle /me/ (Gerzenstein 1995:136):

{|class='wikitable'
|Me|| y-eqfemet-en|| na'|| k’utsaX|| na'|| xukhew?
|-
|q|| A3-injure-caus|| dem:m|| old:man||  dem:m ||man
|-
|colspan='7'|‘Did the old man injure the man?’
|}

Sentences with wh-questions show a sentence-initial question word.  Maká has a very small inventory of question words, with only three members: ''łek'' 'who, what', ''pan'' 'which, where, how many', and ''inhats'ek'' 'why'.  The following example shows an interrogative sentence with an initial question word (Gerzenstein 1995:178:

{|class='wikitable'
|Łek|| pa'||tux|| na'|| xukhew?
|-
|what||dem:m||eat|| dem:m ||old:man
|-
|colspan='7'|‘What did the old man eat?’
|}

She was born in [[Byumba]] and studied sociology, going on to work in rural development. Considered a "moderate" [[Hutu]], she was forced to flee to [[Kivu]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].

The '''Nahuan''' or '''Aztecan''' languages are those languages of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] [[language family]] that have undergone a [[sound change]], known as [[Whorf's law]], that changed an original *t to [[Voiceless alveolar lateral affricate|{{IPA|/tɬ/}}]] before *a.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Whorf, Benjamin Lee   |authorlink=Benjamin Whorf|year=1937|title=The origin of Aztec tl|journal=[[American Anthropologist]]|volume=39|issue=2|pages=265–274|doi=10.1525/aa.1937.39.2.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, some Nahuan languages have changed this {{IPA|/[[Voiceless alveolar affricate|tɬ]]/}} to {{IPA|/l/}} or back to {{IPA|/t/}}, but it can still be seen that the language went through a {{IPA|/tɬ/}} stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Campbell, Lyle   |authorlink=Lyle Campbell |author2=Ronald Langacker |title=Proto-Aztecan vowels: Part I|year=1978 |journal=[[International Journal of American Linguistics]]|volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=85–102|location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |doi=10.1086/465526 |oclc=1753556|authorlink2=Ronald Langacker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known Nahuan language is [[Nahuatl]].

Some authorities, such as the Mexican government, ''[[Ethnologue]],'' and ''[[Glottolog]],'' consider the varieties of modern Nahuatl to be distinct languages, because they are often mutually unintelligible and their speakers have distinct ethnic identities. As of 2008, the Mexican government recognizes thirty varieties that are spoken in Mexico as languages (see the list below).

Researchers distinguish between several dialect areas that each have a number of shared features: One classification scheme distinguishes innovative central dialects, spoken around Mexico City, from conservative peripheral ones spoken north, south and east of the central area, while another scheme distinguishes a basic split between western and eastern dialects.  Nahuan languages include not just varieties known as Nahuatl, but also [[Pipil language|Pipil]] and the extinct [[Pochutec language]].

==Intelligibility==
The differences among the varieties of Nahuatl are not trivial, and in many cases result in low or no mutual intelligibility: people who speak one variety cannot understand or be understood by those from another. Thus, by that criterion, they could be considered different languages. The ISO divisions referenced below respond to intelligibility more than to historical or reconstructional considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/introduction.asp#language_id]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the higher-level groupings, they also are not self-evident and are subject to considerable controversy.

Nevertheless, the variants all are clearly related and more closely related to each other than to [[Pochutec]], and they and Pochutec are more closely related to each other than to any other Uto-Aztecan languages (such as [[Cora language|Cora]] or [[Huichol language|Huichol]], [[Tepehuán]] and [[Tarahumara language|Tarahumara]], [[Yaqui language|Yaqui]]/[[Mayo language|Mayo]], etc.)

== Historical linguistic research ==
Little work has been done in the way of the historical linguistics of Nahuatl proper or the Aztecan (nowadays often renamed Nahuan) branch of Uto-Aztecan.

[[Lyle Campbell]] and [[Ronald W. Langacker]] (1978), in a paper whose focus was the [[internal reconstruction]] of the vowels of Proto-Aztecan (or [[Proto-Nahuan]]), made two proposals of lasting impact regarding the internal classification of the Aztecan branch. They introduced the claim, which would quickly be received as proven beyond virtually any doubt, that the well known change of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */ta-/ to */t͡ɬa-/ was a development in Proto-Aztecan (Proto-Nahuan), not a later development in some dialects descended from Proto-Aztecan. Second, they adduced new arguments for dividing the branch in two subdivisions: Pochutec, whose sole member is the [[Pochutec language]], which became extinct sometime in the 20th century, and General Aztec, which includes the Pipil language and all dialects spoken in Mexico which are clearly closely related to the extinct literary language, Classical Nahuatl. This binary division of Aztecan (Nahuan) was already the majority opinion among specialists, but Campbell and Langacker's new arguments were received as being compelling.&lt;ref&gt;Canger 1988:42–44&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, in "adopt[ing] the term 'General Aztec' ", they may in fact have been the ones to introduce this designation. Part of their reconstruction of the Proto-Aztecan vowels was disputed by Dakin (1983).

The most comprehensive study of the history of Nahuan languages is [[Una Canger]]'s "Five Studies inspired by Nahuatl verbs in -oa" (Canger 1980), in which she explores the historical development of grammar of the verbs ending in ''-oa'' and ''-ia''.  She shows that verbs in ''-oa'' and ''-ia'' are historically and grammatically distinct from verbs in ''-iya'' and ''-owa'', although they are not distinguished in pronunciation in any modern dialects. She shows the historical basis for the five verb classes, based on how they form the perfect tense-aspect, and she shows that all of the different forms of the perfect tense-aspect derives from a single ''-ki'' morpheme that has developed differently depending on the phonological shape of the verb to which it was suffixed. She also explains the historical development of the applicative suffix with the shape ''-lia'' and ''-lwia'' as coming from a single suffix of the shape ''-liwa''.

In 1984 Canger and Dakin published an article in which they showed that Proto-Nahuan ''*ɨ'' had become /e/ in some Nahuan dialects and /i/ in others, and they proposed that this split was among the oldest splits of the Nahuan group.

Dakin has proposed a historical internal classification of Nahuan, e.g., Dakin (2000). She asserts two groups of migrations in central Mexico and eventually southwards to Central America. The first produced Eastern dialects. Centuries later, the second group of migrations produced Western dialects. But many modern dialects are the result of blending between particular Eastern dialects and particular Western dialects.

Campbell in his grammar of Pipil (1985) discussed the problem of classifying Pipil. Pipil is either a descendant of Nahuatl (in his estimation) or still to this day a variety of Nahuatl (in the estimation of for example Lastra de Suárez (1986) and Dakin (2001)).

Dakin (1982) is a book-length study (in Spanish) of the phonological evolution of Proto-Nahuatl. Dakin (1991) suggested that irregularities in the modern Nahuatl system of possessive prefixes might be due to the presence in Proto-Nahuan of distinct grammatical marking for two types of possession.

In the 1990s, two papers appeared addressing the old research problem of the "[[Saltillo (linguistics)|saltillo]]" in Nahuatl: a lost paper by Whorf (1993), and Manaster Ramer (1995).

== Modern Nahuan languages and their classification ==
A Center-Periphery scheme was introduced by Canger in 1978, and supported by comparative historical data in 1980.  Lastra de Suarez' (1986) dialect atlas that divided dialects into center and peripheral areas based on strictly synchronic evidence. The subsequent 1988 article by Canger adduced further historical evidence for this division.(Dakin 2003:261).

=== Studies of individual dialects ===
Until the middle of the 20th century, scholarship on Nahuan languages was limited almost entirely to the literary language that existed approximately 1540–1770 (which is now known as [[Classical Nahuatl grammar|Classical Nahuatl]], although the descriptor "classical" was never used until the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Canger 1988:49&lt;/ref&gt;). Since the 1930s, there have appeared several grammars of individual modern dialects (in either article or book form), in addition to articles of narrower scope.&lt;ref&gt;Amith's career long dictionary project for the dialect of the Alto Balsas region of Guerrero is recounted in [http://www.mercatus.org/MediaDetails.aspx?id=22092 ''Wall Street Journal'', 2006-02-27]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
The history of research into Nahuan dialect classification in the 20th century up to 1988 has been reviewed by Canger (1988). Before 1978, classification proposals had relied to a greater or lesser degree on the three way interdialectal sound correspondence /t͡ɬ ~ t ~ l/ (the lateral affricate /t͡ɬ/ of Classical Nahuatl and many other dialects corresponds to /t/ in some eastern and southern dialects and to /l/ in yet other dialects). [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]] (1937) had performed an analysis and concluded that /t͡ɬ/ was the ''reflex'' of Proto-Uto-Aztecan */t/ before /a/ (a conclusion which has been borne out). But in 1978 Campbell and Langacker made the novel proposal—which met with immediate universal acceptance—that this sound change had occurred back in Proto-Aztecan (the ancestor dialect of Pochutec and General Aztec) and that therefore the corresponding /t/ or /l/ in Nahuatl dialects were innovations.

As a geographical note: the northern part of the State of Puebla is universally recognized as having two subgroupings. The northern part of the State of Puebla is a long north to south lobe. In the middle of it from east-northeast to west-southwest runs the Sierra de Puebla (as Nahuanist linguists call it) or Sierra Norte de Puebla (as geographers call it). The "Sierra de Puebla" dialects are quite distinct from the "northern Puebla" dialects, which are spoken in northernmost Puebla State and very small parts of neighboring states.

==== Eastern–Western division ====
Dakin (2003:261) gives the following classification of Nahuatl dialects (in which the word "north" has been replaced by "northern"), based on her earlier publications, e.g., Dakin (2000).

*Eastern Nahuatl
**[[Huasteca Nahuatl|Huastec]]
**[[Guerrero Nahuatl|Guerrero]]
**[[Sierra Puebla Nahuatl|Sierra Puebla]]
**[[Tehuacan–Zongolica Nahuatl|Tehuacán–Zongolica]]
**[[Isthmus Nahuatl|Isthmus]]
**[[Pipil language|Pipil]]
*Western Nahuatl
**[[Central Nahuatl languages|Central Nahuatl]]
***"Classical" Nahuatl
***[[Tlaxcala–Puebla Nahuatl|Tlaxcala–Puebla]]
***[[Central Puebla Nahuatl|Central Puebla]]
***[[Ometepec Náhuatl language|Ometepec]]
***Northern Puebla
**[[Western Peripheral Nahuatl|Western Peripheral]]
***[[Mexicanero language|Mexicanero]]
***[[Coatepec Nahuatl|Coatepec]]
***[[Temascaltepec Nahuatl|Temascaltepec]]
***[[Michoacán Nahuatl|Michoacán]]
***[[Pochutec language|Pochutec]]

Most specialists in Pipil (El Salvador) consider it to have diverged from Nahuatl to the point it should no longer be considered a variety of Nahuatl. Most specialists in Nahuan do not consider Pochutec to have ever been a variety of Nahuatl.

====Center–Periphery division====
Canger (1978; 1980) and Lastra de Suarez (1986) have made classification schemes based on data and methodology which each investigator has well documented.  Canger proposed a single Central grouping and several Peripheral groupings. The Center grouping is hypothesized to have arisen during the Aztec Empire by diffusion of the defining feature (an innovative verb form) and other features from the prestigious dialect of the capital. The dialects which adopted it could be from multiple genetic divisions of General Aztec.&lt;ref&gt;Indeed, she clarifies, "I hypothesized that the loss of stem-final vowel in the perfect of some verbs, which is defining for the Central dialects, had started only after the Mexica entered the Valley of Mexico, i.e., sometime in the fourteenth century" (1988:47). That is, the feature being offered as defining "Central dialects" is claimed to have originated with a dialect which was in fact a late arrival in Central Mexico and is claimed to have spread to dialects of Nahuatl which are known to have arrived centuries earlier.&lt;/ref&gt; As for the various Peripheral groupings, their identity as Peripheral is defined negatively, i.e., by their lack the grammatical feature which, it is proposed, defines the Central grouping. Canger recognized the possibility that centuries of population migrations and other grammatical feature diffusions may have combined to obscure the genetic relationships (the branching evolution) among the dialects of Nahuatl.

Some of the isoglosses used by Canger to establish the Peripheral vs. Central dialectal dichotomy are these:

{|class="wikitable"

|#''ye''- epenthetic y before initial e

Lastra de Suárez in her Nahuatl dialect atlas (1986) affirmed the concept of the Center/Periphery geographic dichotomy, but amended Canger's assignment of some subgroupings to the Center or the Periphery. The three most important divergences are probably those involving Huastec dialects, Sierra de Zongolica dialects,&lt;ref&gt;Spoken in the Sierra de Zongolica, state of Veracruz, which contains a town also named Zongolica, and in the adjacent southeastern part of the state of Puebla, in the vicinity of Tehuacán&lt;/ref&gt; and northwestern Guerrero dialects. Lastra classifies these as Peripheral, Central, and Central, respectively, while in each case Canger does the opposite.

The dialectal situation is very complex and most categorizations, including the one presented above, are, in the nature of things, controversial.  Lastra wrote, "The [[isogloss]]es rarely coincide. As a result, one can give greater or lesser importance to a feature and make the [dialectal] division that one judges appropriate/convenient" (1986:189). And she warned: "We insist that this classification is not [entirely] satisfactory" (1986:190). Both researchers emphasized the need for more data in order for there to be advances in the field of Nahuatl dialectology. Since the 1970s, there has been an increase in research whose immediate aim is the production of grammars and dictionaries of individual dialects. But there is also a detailed study of dialect variation in the dialect subgroup sometimes known as the Zongolica (Andrés Hasler 1996). A. Hasler sums up the difficulty of classifying Zongolica thus (1996:164): "Juan Hasler (1958:338) interprets the presence in the region of [a mix of] eastern dialect features and central dialect features as an indication of a substratum of eastern Nahuatl and a superstratum of central Nahuatl.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hasler is referring to J. Hasler's own definitions of "eastern Nahuatl" and "central Nahuatl".&lt;/ref&gt; Una Canger (1980:15–20) classifies the region as part of the eastern area, while [[Yolanda Lastra]] (1986:189–190) classifies it as part of the central area."

As already alluded to, the nucleus of the Central dialect territory is the [[Valley of Mexico]]. The extinct [[Classical Nahuatl]], the enormously influential language spoken by the people of [[Tenochtitlan]], the Aztec capital, is one of the Central dialects. Lastra in her dialect atlas proposed three Peripheral groupings: eastern, western, and [[La Huasteca|Huasteca]].&lt;ref&gt;Lastra de Suarez 1986, chapter 4; summarized in Martín, in press, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; She included Pipil in Nahuatl, assigning it to the Eastern Periphery grouping. Lastra's classification of dialects of modern Nahuatl is as follows (many of the labels refer to Mexican states):

*[[Western Peripheral Nahuatl|Western Periphery]]
**West coast
**Western México State
**[[Mexicanero|Durango]]–Nayarit
*[[Eastern Peripheral Nahuatl|Eastern Periphery]]
**[[Sierra Puebla Nahuatl|Sierra de Puebla]]&lt;ref&gt;The [[Sierra Norte de Puebla]] is a small mountain range in the northern lobe of the State of Puebla, running east to west. Lastra, Canger, and A. Hasler typically refer to it as "Sierra de Puebla"&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Isthmus Nahuatl|Isthmus]]
**[[Pipil language|Pipil]]
*[[Huastecan Nahuatl|Huasteca]]
*[[Central Nahuatl dialects|Center]]
**Nuclear subarea (in and near Mexico, D.F.)
**Puebla–Tlaxcala (areas by the border between the states of Puebla and Tlaxcala)
**Xochiltepec–Huatlatlauca (south of the city of Puebla)
**Southeastern Puebla (this grouping extends over the Sierra de Zongolica located in the neighboring state of Veracruz)
**Central Guerrero (so called; actually northern Guerrero, specifically the region of the Balsas River)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15357">'''Narcissistic mortification''' is "the primitive terror of self dissolution, triggered by the sudden exposure of one's sense of a defective self ... it is death by [[embarrassment]]".&lt;ref name = Libbey&gt;{{cite web|title=On Narcissistic Mortification|url=http://internationalpsychoanalysis.net/wp-content/uploads/2007/07/libbeypaper.pdf|author= Mary Libbey|publisher= Paper  presented at the Shame Symposium, New York, March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic mortification is a term first used by [[Sigmund Freud]] in his last book, ''[[Moses and Monotheism]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''Moses and Monotheism'' (Standard Ed., 23) p. 74 and p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with respect to early injuries to the [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|ego]]/self. The concept has been widely employed in [[ego psychology]] and also contributed to the roots of [[self psychology]].

When narcissistic mortification is experienced for the first time, it may be defined as a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality, or both. This produces strong emotions of terror while at the same time narcissistic [[libido]] (also known as ego-libido) or [[destrudo]] is built up.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01568757#page-1|publisher=Psychiatric Quarterly|author=Ludwig Eidelberg}} 1957;31(4):657-68.&lt;/ref&gt; Narcissistic libido or ego-libido is the concentration of libido on the self. Destrudo is the opposite of libido and is the impulse to destroy oneself and everything associated with oneself.

==Early developments: Bergler, Anna Freud, and Eidelberg==
[[Edmund Bergler]] developed the concept of narcissistic mortification in connection with early fantasies of [[omnipotence]] in the developing child, and with the fury provoked by the confrontations with reality that undermine his or her illusions.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, "The Psychology of Gambling", Jon Halliday/Peter Fuller eds., ''The Psychology of Gambling'' (London 1974) p. 182-3&lt;/ref&gt; For Bergler, “the narcissistic mortification suffered in this very early period continues to act as a stimulus throughout his life”.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Bergler, ''The Basic Neurosis'' (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anna Freud]] used the term in connection with her exploration of the [[defence mechanism]] of altruistic surrender, whereby an individual lives only through the lives of others – seeing at the root of such an abrogation of one's own life an early experience of narcissistic mortification at a disappointment with one's self.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Appignanesi/John Forrester, ''Freud's Women'' (2004) p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychoanalyst and author Ludwig Eidelberg subsequently expanded on the concept in the fifties and sixties. Eidelberg defined narcissistic mortification as occurring when “a sudden loss of control over external or internal reality...produces the painful emotional experience of terror”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/u567q2r527731438/ "An introduction to the study of the narcissistic mortification" Psychiatric Quarterly 31]&lt;/ref&gt; He also stressed that for many patients simply to have to accept themselves as having neurotic symptoms was itself a source of narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Eidelberg: [http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.029.0582b The Concept of Narcissistic Mortification] Int J Psychoanal. 1959 May-Aug;40:163-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kohut and self psychology==

For Kohut, [[narcissistic rage and narcissistic injury|narcissistic injury]] - the root cause of what he  termed [[narcissistic personality disorder]] – was broadly equivalent to the [[humiliation]] of mortification.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson/Hilary Anne Clark, ''Scenes of Shame'' (1999) p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Kohut considered that “if the [[grandiosity]] of the narcissistic self has been insufficiently modified...then the adult ego will tend to vacillate between an irrational overestimation of the self and feelings of inferiority and will react with narcissistic mortification to the thwarting of its ambitions”.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Steven J. Ellman, ''When Theories Touch'' (London 2009) p. 464&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object relations theory==
{{Main|Object relations theory}}
Unlike ego psychologists, object relations theorists have traditionally used a rather different, [[Melanie Klein|post-Kleinian]] vocabulary to describe the early woundings of narcissistic mortification. Recently however  such theorists have found analogies between Freud's emphasis on the sensitivity of the ego to narcissistic humiliation and mortification, and the views of [[W. R. Bion|Bion]] on 'nameless dread' or [[D. W. Winnicott|Winnicott]]'s on the original agonies of the breakdown of childhood consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Eigen, ''The Sensitive Self'' (2004) p. 10, 20, and 25&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time ego psychologists have been increasingly prepared to see narcissistic mortification as occurring in the context of early relations to objects.

==Physical sensations and psychological perceptions==
An individual’s experience of mortification may be accompanied by both physical and psychological sensations. Physical sensations such as: burning, painful tingling over the body, pain in the chest that slowly expands and spreads throughout the torso, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, sweating, blanching, coldness and numbness can be experienced by the individual suffering from mortification. The psychological sensations described are feeling shocked, exposed, and humiliated. Descriptions of this experience can be, for example: “It feels like I won’t survive” and “I have the absolute conviction that he or she hates me and it’s my fault”. These sensations are always followed by shock, although they may have happened on various occasions, they also prompt the need for the individual suffering to do something both internally and externally, to effect a positive self-image in the eyes of their narcissistic object. Narcissistic mortification is extreme in its intensity, global nature, and its lack of perspective, causing the anxiety associated with it to become traumatic.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==Normal versus pathological==
In Eidelberg's view, a normal individual would usually be able to avoid being overwhelmed by internal needs because they recognize these urges in time to bring about their partial discharge. However, Eidelberg does not view occasional outbursts of temper as a sign of disorder. An individual experiencing pathological narcissistic mortification is prone to become fixated on infantile objects, resulting in an infantile form of discharge. He or she cannot be satisfied by the partial discharge of this energy, which takes place on an  unconscious level, and this in turn interferes with their well-being. According to Eidelberg, the denial of an infantile narcissistic mortification can be responsible for many defensive mechanisms.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

===Internal versus external===

Narcissistic mortification can be: 
* '''Internal''' - occurs when an individual is overstimulated by their emotions. For example, while debating with classmates on the importance of stem cell research an outspoken student loses his temper causing an uproar. The student has just exhibited an overstimulation of his emotions and used this outburst to relieve internal tension. 
* '''External''' - occurs when something out of one's control influences a situation, for example, an individual who is held at gunpoint while having their wallet stolen. This individual does not hold any control over the scenario nor the actions of the gunman, but their reaction to being held at gunpoint influences the next scenario and what the gunman does next.&lt;ref name=Eidelberg /&gt;

==In cult leadership==
{{POV-section|date=May 2013}}

To escape the narcissistic mortification of accepting their own dependency needs, [[cult]] leaders may resort to delusions of [[omnipotence]].&lt;ref name="pathological narcissist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Chris Nemelka - Public Scrutiny|url=http://chrisnemelka.com/the-pathological-narcissist/#more-4828|accessdate=31 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their continuing [[shame]] and underlying [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The dark side of enlightenment: sadomasochistic aspects of the quest for perfection|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|accessdate=31 March 2013|author=Daniel Shaw|date=22 January 2000|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130629000728/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/dark_side.htm|archivedate=29 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their repudiation of dependency,&lt;ref name="traumatic abuse in cults"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=Daniel|title=Traumatic abuse in cults: A psychoanalytic perspective|journal=Cultic Studies Review|year=2003|volume=2|url=http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|accessdate=31 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130617040314/http://www.danielshawlcsw.com/traumabusecults.pdf|archivedate=17 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; obliges such leaders to use seduction and manic defenses to externalize and locate dependency needs in others, thus making their followers controllable through a displaced sense of shame.

==Death, anxiety, and suicide==

Because in western culture death is sometimes seen as the ultimate loss of control, fear of it may produce death anxiety in the form of a sense of extreme shame or narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kauffman ed.,  ''The Shame of Death, Grief and Trauma'' (2010) p. 77-9&lt;/ref&gt; The shame in this context is produced by the loss of stoicism, productivity, and control, aspects that are highly valued by society and aspects that are taken away as one ages. Death according to Darcy Harris, 'is the ultimate narcissistic wound, bringing about not just the annihilation of self, but the annihilation of one's entire existence, resulting in a form of existential shame for human beings, who possess the ability to ponder this dilemma with their higher functioning cognitive abilities.'&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman&lt;/ref&gt;

Individuals who hold this anxiety are ashamed of mortality and the frailty that comes along with it; and may attempt to overcome this reality through diversions and accomplishments, deflecting feelings of inferiority and shame through strategies like [[grandiosity]] in similar fashion to those with narcissistic personality traits.&lt;ref name="shame of death"&gt;{{cite book|title=The shame of death, grief, and trauma |isbn=0-203-88360-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VAn8xnSisJQC&amp;pg=PA77&amp;lpg=PA77&amp;dq=death+anxiety+and+narcissistic+mortification&amp;source=bl&amp;hl=en |editor=Jeffrey Kauffman |accessdate=1 April 2013 |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Narcissistic mortification may also be produced by death of someone close.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 680&lt;/ref&gt; Such a loss of an essential object may even lead through narcissistic mortification to suicide.&lt;ref&gt;F. Alexander et al, ''Psychoanalytic Pioneers'' (1995) p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many motives behind suicidal activities in general are shame, loss of honor, and narcissistic mortification.&lt;ref name="suicide and narcissistic mortification"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ritter |first1=Kristina |last2=Chaudhry |first2=Haroon |last3=Erhabor |first3=Idemudia |last4=Karakula |first4=Hanna |last5=Okribelashvili |first5=Ninõ |last6=Rudaleviciene |first6=Palmira |last7=Stompe |first7=Thomas |title=Suicide motives and culture |journal=Official Journal of World Association of Cultural Psychiatry |year=2008 |url=http://www.wcprr.org/pdf/03-02/2008.02.6976.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who suffer from narcissistic mortification are more likely to participate in suicidal behaviors and those who do not receive the proper help more often than not succeed. Suicide related to narcissistic mortification is different from  normal sorrow in that it is associated with deep rooted self-contempt and self-hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Woolf, M. M. (1958). Zur Psychologie des Selbstmordes. Acta Psychotherapeutica, Psychosomatica Et Orthopaedagogica, 6317-326. doi:10.1159/000285354&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
According to a paper presented by Mary Libbey, "On Narcissistic Mortification", presented at the 2006 Shame Symposium, long-term goal of psychoanalytic treatment for those who suffer from narcissistic mortification is to transform the mortification into shame. She says by transforming it into shame it enables the sufferer to tolerate and use it as a signal; the process of transforming mortification into shame entails working through both the early mortifying traumas as well as the defenses, often unstable, related to them. If an individual sufferer does not go through this transformation, he or she is left with two unstable narcissistic defenses. Libbey says these defenses are: self-damning, deflated states designed to appease and hold on to self-objects, and narcissistic conceit, which is designed to project the defective self experiences onto self-objects. Both of these defensive styles require a continuation of dependence on the self-object. Transforming the mortification into shame makes it possible for self-appraisal and self-tolerance, this ultimately leads to psychic separation and self-reliance without the need to sustain one's mortification, according to Libbey's paper.&lt;ref name = Libbey/&gt;

==In the 21st century==

Postmodern Freudians link narcissistic mortification to Winnicott's theory of primitive mental states which lack the capacity for symbolisation, and their need for re-integration.&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Druck et al eds., ''A New Freudian Synthesis'' (2011) p. 253&lt;/ref&gt; Returning in the transference to the intolerable mortification underpinning such [[narcissistic defences]] can however also produce positive analytic change, by way of the (albeit mortifying) re-experience of overwhelming object loss within an intersubjective holding environment.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Druck, ''A Freudian Synthesis'' (London 2010) p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

21st century American analysts are particularly concerned with the potential production of narcissistic mortification as a by-product of analytic interpretation, especially with regard to [[masochistic personality disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Cooper ed., ''Contemporary Psychoanalysis in America'' (2008) p. 505 and p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary uses==

Narcissistic mortification at injuries to [[self-esteem]] has been seen as pervading Captain Ahab's motivations in his confrontation with [[Moby-Dick]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Adamson, ''Melville, Shame, and the Evil Eye'' (1997) p. 74-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Mortification at one's self is seen in Mary Shelley's [[Frankenstein]] when the Creature stares at his reflection in a pool of water. This is where he becomes convinced that he is in fact the Creature and becomes filled with despondence and mortification.&lt;ref name=Frankenstein&gt;{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Jeffrey|title=Frankenstein; or, the Modern Narcissus|url=http://knarf.english.upenn.edu/Articles/berman.html|publisher=New York University|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A non-recursive filter only uses input values like x[n − i], unlike recursive filter where it uses previous output values like y[n-i]. Non-recursive digital filters are often known as Finite Impulse Response (FIR) Filters as a non-recursive digital filter has a finite number of coefficients in the impulse response h[n].


Non-recursive Filter Example:
y[n] = 0.5x[n − 1] + 0.5x[n].

Recursive Filter Example:
y[n] = 0.5y[n − 1] + 0.5x[n].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3405">The '''Proclamation by the Crown Act 1539''' (31 Hen. 8 c. 8; also known as the '''Statute of Proclamations''')&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/site-information/glossary/henry-viii-clauses/&lt;/ref&gt; was a law enacted by the [[English Reformation Parliament]] of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]. It permitted the King to legislate by decree, ordering that "traditional" [[proclamations]] (that is, any unable to impose the death penalty or forfeiture of goods){{clarify|date=December 2013}} should be obeyed as "though they were made by act of parliament". In addition the act appointed machinery for their enforcement.&lt;ref name=VII3&gt;[[G.R. Elton]] ''England Under The Tudors'' London: Methuen, 1955, revised edition 1974: Chapter VII The Tudor Revolution: 3 Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Blackstone]] called the Act "a statute, which was calculated to introduce the most despotic tyranny; and which must have proved fatal to the liberties of this kingdom, had it not been luckily repealed."&lt;ref&gt;Blackstone (1765-69) ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'', book 1, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was once considered to be the height of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s despotism. The great efforts made by the King's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]], when drafting the acts of this time show that he was aware of the importance of statute and Parliament.&lt;ref name=VII3/&gt;

Cromwell's natural reaction to any problem of government was to draft a bill. However, there were times when an immediate decision or temporary policy was required without having to wait for Parliament. For example, in 1535 it was desired to prevent the export of currency from the realm; Cromwell insisted on finding a relevant statute, although he was relieved to hear from the judges that, in such matters, failing such a statute, the king had the power to issue a proclamation. Nevertheless, Cromwell felt unsatisfied, and hence the Act of 1539, designed to give general legal sanction to royal proclamations.&lt;ref name=VII3/&gt;

Cromwell originally intended to allow the common-law courts to enforce these proclamations. However, opposition from the [[House of Lords]] forced him instead to accept a council as nominated in the act. This council proved so incapable of doing the work that in 1547, when the Act was repealed, it made no difference to the legality of royal proclamations.&lt;ref name=VII3/&gt;

Proclamations would continue to prove controversial, especially when it came to taxation in which it was seen as an arbitrary power, becoming one of the many reasons for the [[War of the Three Kingdoms]]. Restored Stuart attempts at emulating French absolutism through revival of proclamations would be a factor in causing the eventual [[Glorious Revolution]], leading to the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] that entrenched [[Parliamentary sovereignty]].

'''Salvador das Missões''' is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Brazil. 

==Regional language==
Like many towns in the state which were first settled by German-speaking Europeans, the German language is still present in daily family and community life, if not as much in the public sphere since [[World War II]]; the regional German dialect is called [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]], as it is a Brazilian variant of the dialekt spoken in the [[Hunsrück]] region of southwest Germany. In 2012 the state chamber of deputies voted unanimously in favor of recognizing this Germanic dialect an official historical culture good to be preserved.

'''Semantic integration''' is the process of interrelating information from diverse sources, for example calendars and to do lists, email archives, presence information (physical, psychological, and social), documents of all sorts, contacts (including [[social graph]]s), search results, and advertising and marketing relevance derived from them. In this regard, [[semantics]] focuses on the organization of and action upon [[information]] by acting as an intermediary between heterogeneous data sources, which may conflict not only by structure but also context or value.

==Applications and methods==

In [[enterprise application integration]] (EAI), semantic integration can facilitate or even automate the communication between computer systems using [[metadata publishing]]. Metadata publishing potentially offers the ability to automatically link [[ontology (computer science)|ontologies]]. One approach to (semi-)automated ontology mapping requires the definition of a semantic distance or its inverse, [[semantic similarity]] and appropriate rules. Other approaches include so-called ''lexical methods'', as well as methodologies that rely on exploiting the structures of the ontologies.  For explicitly stating similarity/equality, there exist special properties or relationships in most ontology languages. [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]], for example has "owl:equivalentClass", "owl:equivalentProperty" and "owl:sameAs".

Eventually system designs may see the advent of composable architectures where published semantic-based interfaces are joined together to enable new and meaningful capabilities{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. These could predominately be described by means of design-time declarative specifications, that could ultimately be rendered and executed at run-time{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

Semantic integration can also be used to facilitate design-time activities of interface design and mapping. In this model, semantics are only explicitly applied to design and the run-time systems work at the [[syntax]] level{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}. This  "early semantic binding" approach can improve overall system performance while retaining the benefits of semantic driven design{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

==Examples==

The [[Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing]] has been a venue for the popularization of the ontology mapping task in the biomedical domain, and a number of papers on the subject can be found in its proceedings.

'''Strip programming''' or '''stripping''' is a technique used for [[scheduling]] [[terrestrial television|television]] and [[radio broadcasting|radio]] [[broadcast programming|programming]] to ensure consistency and coherency. [[Television program|Television]] or [[radio program]]s of a particular style (such as a [[television series]]) are given a regular time slot during the week, so that it appears as a strip straight across the weekly schedule. For example, radio and television [[broadcasting|broadcasters]] may program a [[news]] program at [[rush hour]]s every day, or at least every weekday.

Strip programming is used to deliver consistent content to targeted audiences. Broadcasters know or predict the times at which certain [[demographics]] will be listening to or watching their programs and play them at that time. Most television [[dayparting|dayparts]] outside of [[prime time]] use strip programming five days a week, with the same programs being broadcast every day at the same time to target specific demographics. Strip programming is sometimes criticized as making programming too predictable, and reducing diversity and uniqueness.

==Overview==
Strip scheduling often applies to any program that airs on multiple consecutive days during the calendar week (most commonly Monday through Friday), whether carried through a [[television network]] (such as with a [[talk show]], news program or [[soap opera]]) or in [[broadcasting syndication|syndication]]. It is commonly restricted to describing the airing of [[television program]]s that were originally broadcast on a weekly basis during their original run: ''[[The West Wing]]'' could be stripped but not ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', as ''Jeopardy!'' was originally intended to be run daily. It can also refer to shows in prime time that run daily, such as with the short-lived ''[[The Jay Leno Show]]'' in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/watch_with_kristin/leno_show_confirmed_canceled_nbc/161301 |title=Leno Show Confirmed Canceled, NBC Late-Night Schedule Questions Remain Unresolved |publisher=E! Online |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For much of the 1960s and into the early 1990s, stripping for syndication was one of, if not ''the'' primary profit component of the studio production model in American television. A show became far more profitable if it succeeded in getting three full U.S. seasons (about 75 [[episode]]s) or more, as then it was possible to strip it for fifteen weeks (15×5=75) before needing to repeat episodes. Once a series attained five seasons (which would push the show over the [[100 episodes]] threshold), it would be a full six months before it would repeat. For ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', in particular, this was relevant. Only due to an unprecedented letter-writing campaign was the show renewed for its third season, and it did not begin to attain wider popularity until appearing in syndication for a number of years. If it had failed to be renewed for a third season, it would not have been syndicated, and its subsequent popularity and influence would likely not have occurred. Many other shows with lukewarm response in their initial runs became widely appreciated cult favorites as a result of syndication, or helped keep cultural memes associated with them far more widely known than if the shows had only been viewable during their initial time frame.

[[Michael Grade]] was responsible for introducing '''stripped and stranded''' schedules to the [[BBC]]'s television service in the [[United Kingdom]] in his role as controller of [[BBC1]]: from February 18, 1985, onward,{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}} the weekday evening schedule has consisted almost entirely of half-hour or hour-long programs starting on the hour, or half-hour (the BBC channels never carried spot advertising). For example, Grade's new schedule provided at 19:00, the talk show ''[[Wogan]]'' thrice weekly and two episodes of ''[[EastEnders]]'' and fixed the national news at 18:00 and 21:00, and regional news at 18:30. Before this date, programs might start at almost any time and programs could have different times on consecutive weeks or even days, for example:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090905085411/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/tvheroes/michael_grade.php Michael Grade The most popular media mogul in Britain]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stripping has also become an even more common practice on many [[United Kingdom|British]] channels since the introduction of multi-channel [[Cable television|cable]] and [[satellite television]] in the 1990s.

In many other countries, even new episodes of various series are aired every weekday. For example, if such a station gets the most recent season of a television series originating from the [[United States]], the episodes will air in this way for two or three weeks, after which they are replaced by another show in the same timeslot.

In Australia, [[Network Ten]] and its sister station [[Eleven (TV channel)|Eleven]] have stripped ''[[The Simpsons]]'' for many years, airing the show daily at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., which is traditionally the news hour on rivals [[Seven Network]] and [[Nine Network]]. Despite some attempts to fill this slot with original programming, ''The Simpsons'' stripped at 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. remained a mainstay of Australian television until recently.

{{for|the actual death of players in sport|Sudden cardiac death of athletes}}
In a [[sport]] or [[game]], '''sudden death''' (also '''sudden-death overtime''' or a '''sudden-death round''') is a form of competition where play ends as soon as one competitor is ahead of the others, with that competitor becoming the winner.  Sudden death is typically used as a [[tiebreaker]] when a contest is tied at the end of the normal playing time or the completion of the normal playing task.

An alternative tiebreaker method is to play a reduced version of the original; for example, in [[association football]] 30 minutes of [[extra time]] (overtime) after 90 minutes of normal time, or in [[golf]] one playoff round (18 holes) after four standard rounds (72 holes).  Sudden-death playoffs typically end more quickly than these reduced replays.  Reducing the variability of the event's duration assists those scheduling television time and team travel. Fans may see sudden death as exciting and suspenseful, or they may view the format as insufficiently related to the sport played during regulation time; for example, prior to 2012, the [[National Football League]] ([[American football]]) used a sudden-death rule for overtime play.  In those situations, a team possessing the ball need only kick a field goal to end the game in their favor, negating the additional benefit that typically comes with scoring a touchdown.

Sudden death provides a victor for the contest without a specific amount of time being required.  It may be called "'''next score wins'''" or similar, although in some games, the winner may result from penalization of the other competitor for a mistake.  Sudden death may instead be called '''sudden victory''' to avoid the mention of death and serious disease, particularly in sports with a high risk of physical injury. This variant became one of announcer [[Curt Gowdy]]'s idiosyncrasies in 1971 when the AFC divisional championship game between the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[Miami Dolphins]] went into overtime.

North American professional sports using a sudden-death method of settling a tied game include the modified version now employed by the  [[National Football League]], the [[National Hockey League]] and, also in a modified sense, the [[PGA Tour]] ([[golf]]).  [[Baseball]] uses a unique method of tie-breaking that incorporates elements of sudden death.  In some [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring games sudden-death extra time may be given in which the first goal scored wins; in association football it is called the ''[[golden goal]]'', although this has not been recognised since it was abolished from the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] in 2004 by [[FIFA]].  In baseball, a winning run scored by the home team in an extra inning is often referred to as a '''walk-off''', as the players can immediately walk off the field.

==American football==
Sudden death has been perceived as a particularly poor fit for [[gridiron football]] because the process gives an inherent advantage to the team who starts with possession of the ball: they can score and end the game immediately (even by driving a relatively short distance into [[field goal range]] and then kicking a [[Field goal (American and Canadian football)|field goal]]), but the team on defense cannot (other than through far rarer scoring strategies such as the [[Interception|pick-six]] or the [[Safety (American football score)|safety]]).

All organized forms of American football have abolished pure sudden death for overtime as of the 2011 season. Most levels of the game, including [[high school football]] and [[college football]], never used it, instead either allowing ties to stand or using alternatives like the [[Kansas Playoff]]. The [[National Football League]] was an exception; the league used pure sudden death in its playoffs beginning in 1940 and in regular season matchups starting in 1974, finally modifying its process for playoffs in 2010 and then regular season games in 2011.

===National Football League===
Originally, all [[National Football League]] games tied at the end of regulation time ended as a tie. Late in the 1940 season, NFL President [[Carl Storck]] announced that sudden death periods would be authorized for any playoff game needed to decide either division title.  It was emphasized that this did not apply to the final championship game, which would crown co-champions in the event of a tie.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, November 19, 1940. [https://www.nytimes.com/1940/11/19/archives/novel-plan-adopted-to-decide-playoffs-pro-football-group-title.html Novel Plan Adopted to Decide Play-Offs],  p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;  Commissioner [[Elmer Layden]] approved a similar arrangement for the 1941 season, with the same limitation. In the years when it was within the rules, the [[NFL Championship Game]] only was tied in regulation in the 1958 NFL Championship Game. A tied game in regulation did not occur in the Super Bowl until [[Super Bowl LI]] (51).

Sudden death overtime was finally approved for the NFL championship game in 1946&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, April 30, 1946. Danzig, Allison, [https://www.nytimes.com/1946/04/30/archives/pro-giants-to-play-seven-home-games-all-national-league-elevens.html Pro Giants To Play Seven Home Games], p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; and remains in effect now.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times, December 18, 1948, [https://www.nytimes.com/1948/12/18/archives/cards-and-eagles-evenly-matched-but-chicago-team-on-basis-of-strong.html Cards And Eagles Evenly Matched], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York Times,  December 11, 1950, [https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/11/archives/sudden-death-overtime-for-playoff-contests.html Sudden Death Overtime For Play-Off Contests], p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;  The first playoff game requiring overtime was the [[NFL Championship Game, 1958|1958 NFL Championship Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Gifford and Richmond, pg. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the NFL adopted a 15-minute sudden-death overtime period for regular-season games; in {{NFL year|2017}} it was cut to 10 minutes.  The game ended as a tie if neither team scores in overtime.  When a team gets near the [[end zone]], it typically tried to kick a [[Field goal (football)|field goal]].  An overtime game can also be won by scoring a [[touchdown]] (in such an event, the [[extra point]] is not attempted).  This usually happened on a play that began with field position far enough away from the end zone to make a field goal difficult if not impossible, but it can also result from a team choosing not to attempt a field goal until reaching fourth down, even if the team enters an easy field goal range; this strategy only works if the team can maintain possession of the ball and does not fumble the ball away, throw an interception or lose enough yardage to back out of field goal range.  Only thrice has an overtime game been won by a [[Safety (American football score)|safety]].  In recent years, sportscasters have referred to such scoring plays as "walk-offs," as both teams can walk off the field after the play.

Since the 2010–11 playoffs, in the post-season, each team was allowed at least one possession to score in overtime, unless the team receiving the kickoff scored a touchdown or if the defensive team scored a touchdown or safety on the same possession. True sudden death rules applied if both teams have had their initial possession and the game remains tied. This rule did not actually come into use during the 2010 playoffs, with the first overtime game under the new rules not occurring until 2011, with the [[Denver Broncos]] scoring a long touchdown on their first play from scrimmage against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. 

This rule was adopted for the start of the 2012 regular season.  It was adopted to counter the criticism that the outcome of overtime games was very frequently decided by the coin toss, as the team which won it usually attempted only enough offensive action to maneuver into field goal range and seldom made a real effort to score a touchdown.  In the regular season, games still tied after one full overtime period will continue to be allowed to end in a tie.

For information on games that have taken a long time under sudden death, see [[Overtime (sports)#Longest games|Overtime]].

===Arena football===
In [[arena football]], each team is allowed one overtime possession in the first overtime, after which whoever is ahead is the winner.  If the score is still tied, however, true sudden death rules apply thereafter.  (A similar, modified sudden death format, with a 10-minute limit, was used in the [[NFL Europa#Experimental rules|NFL Europa]] League.) This rule was implemented in the [[2007 Arena Football League season|2007 season]]; prior to this, the league used [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]], a fixed seven and one-half minute extra period; if the game was still tied at this point, it was recorded as a tied game.  This was later changed to a fifteen-minute maximum modified sudden death as above, but with a definite conclusion after one overtime period, again a tied game being recorded if the score was still equal.  (Only one tied game was recorded under each of the two prior overtime rules.) Since the beginning of the 2007 season, all Arena football games, both regular season and playoff, have been played to a victorious conclusion.  Any succeeding overtime periods are true sudden death periods. An exception is applied to second game of the 2018 semifinal series, provided one team wins the first game and the second game ends with the two-game aggregate score tied, the game will continue with a standard overtime even if the score of the second game is not tied.

==Association football==

{{Main|Golden goal}}
Sudden death has a controversial history in [[association football]]. Important matches were traditionally resolved by replaying the entire match, however in the era of television and tight travel schedules this is often impracticable. Replays are still used in some major competitions (like the [[FA Cup]]).

In many matches, if the score is tied after the full 90 minutes, a draw results; however, if one team must be eliminated, some form of tie-breaking must occur. Originally, two 15-minute halves of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] were held and if the teams remained equal at the end of the halves, [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|kicks from the penalty mark]] are held.

To try to decrease the chances of requiring kicks from the penalty mark, the [[International Football Association Board|IFAB]], the world law making body of the sport, experimented with new rules. The [[golden goal]] rule transformed the overtime periods into sudden death until the periods were over, where shootouts would occur. As this became unpopular, the [[silver goal]] rule was instituted, causing the game to end if the scores were not equal after the first 15-minute period as well as the second. The silver goal has also fallen into disrepute so [[UEFA Euro 2004]] was the last event to use it; after which the original tie-breaking methods were restored.

The main criticism of golden goal is the quickness of ending the game, and the pressure on coaches and players. Once a goal is scored, the game is over and the opponent cannot attempt to answer the goal within the remaining time. Therefore, teams would place more emphasis on not conceding a goal rather than scoring a goal, and many golden goal extra time periods remained scoreless.

In [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] collegiate play in the United States, however, sudden death, adopted in 1997 for all championship play in addition to regular season play, remains. In 2005, the Division II Women's Championship game ended in sudden death as a goal was scored three minutes into the overtime to end the championship match.[http://www.soccertimes.com/ncaa/2005/wgames/dec03a.htm] Sudden death is also prevalent in youth play, for the safety of players.

If the teams are still tied after the initial allocated number in the penalty shoot-out, the game goes to sudden-death penalties, where each team takes a further one penalty each, repeated until only one team scores, resulting in the winning of the game.

==Badminton==
In [[badminton]], if a set is tied at 29-all, golden point is played; whoever scores this point wins it.

==Baseball and softball==
[[Baseball]] and [[softball]] are not true sudden-death sports, but they have one comparable situation.

Baseball and softball games cannot end until both teams have had an equal number of turns at bat, unless further play (by the home team if they lead after {{Frac|8|1|2}} innings) cannot affect the outcome.  In the final scheduled inning (typically, in professional and advanced amateur leagues the ninth inning, but usually the seventh for youth leagues and softball, and the sixth for leagues for subteens such as [[Little League]]), if the visitors complete their turn at bat and still trail the hosts, the game ends.  If the visitors lead or the game is tied, the hosts take their "last ups" at bat.  If the hosts should exceed the visitors' score, the game ends at the conclusion of the play on which the hosts take this insurmountable lead.  (If the final scheduled inning ends in a tie, multiple extra innings are played with the same implications as the final scheduled inning.)

The ability to bat last is an [[Home advantage|advantage of being the home team]].  It is said that "visitors must play to win; hosts need only play to tie" because tying forces an extra inning.

A tied game in the bottom of the final scheduled inning puts pressure on the visitors.  For example, with a runner on third base and fewer than two outs, the visitors cannot afford even to get certain types of out that would let the game-ending run score after the out.

A scoring play that ends the game is called a walk-off, because after the runner scores the winning run everyone can walk off the field.  A [[walk-off home run]] is an exception to the rule stated above; the game does not end when the winning run scores, but continues until the batter and all runners score (provided they run the bases correctly).

==Basketball==
[[Basketball]] does not traditionally employ sudden death to decide games; it instead uses multiple five-minute [[Overtime (sports)#Basketball|overtime]] periods to determine the result of games tied after regulation play. The entire overtime is played; if the game remains tied, this procedure is repeated.

The [[NBA Summer League]], a developmental summer league, employs sudden death basketball after the first overtime. The rules state ''Double overtime &amp; thereafter is sudden death (first team to score a point wins).'' In the first sudden death professional basketball game, [[Devin Ebanks]] hit a game winner with 45 seconds elapsed for the D-League Select team, beating the summer league [[Atlanta Hawks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nba/2014/07/13/nba-summer-league-introduces-sudden-death-basketball/12609323/|title=NBA Summer League introduces sudden death basketball|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another form of basketball does employ a sudden-death overtime. [[3x3 (basketball)|3x3]], a formalized version of the half-court three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime period that ends by rule once either team has scored 2&amp;nbsp;points. In this form of the sport, shots taken from behind the "three-point" arc are worth 2&amp;nbsp;points and all other shots are worth 1&amp;nbsp;point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/3x3/inside3x3/p/openNodeIDs/23267/selNodeID/23267/3x3-rules-of-the-game.html |title=3x3: Rules of the game |publisher=[[FIBA]] |accessdate=March 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fencing==
An individual [[Fencing (sport)|fencing]] bout lasts for five touches in a poule match, or 15 touches in a direct elimination (DE) match in all three weapons (épée, foil, and sabre.  Although sabre bouts rarely go to full-time, the same time frames apply)  Matches are also timed (three minutes for a poule match, and three periods of three minutes for a DE). If neither fencer has reached five or 15 points within the time limit, the leading fencer is deemed the winner. However, if the fencers are tied after the allotted time, one minute of extra time is added.

Before resuming the bout, one fencer is randomly awarded "priority". The first fencer to score a valid hit within extra time wins the match; if no valid hits are scored within the time, that fencer with priority is declared the victor.

In the normal course of a match, there is a de facto sudden death situation if both fencers are tied at four (or 14) touches each. The final hit is called "la belle". The fencers may salute each other before playing for the final point.

==Golf==
In individual [[match play]], players level after the regulation 18 or 36 holes will play extra holes in sudden death.  In team tournaments, players may gain half a point each for a tie rather than play sudden death; this is the case in the [[Ryder Cup]], for example. In the [[Presidents Cup]], there was provision for a single-player sudden death shootout if the entire competition ended in a tie.  When this came to pass in [[2003 Presidents Cup|2003]], the tiebreak was unfinished at dusk.  There was no provision for an extra day's play, and both team captains agreed to declare the match tied and share the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2003-11-23-presidents-cup-day4_x.htm |title=Els-Woods playoff unable to settle Presidents Cup |last=Brennan |first=Christine |date=2003-11-25 |work=[[USA Today]] |accessdate=2009-01-29}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, professional [[stroke play]] golf tournaments ending in a tie were [[Playoff (golf)|played off]] the next day with an eighteen-hole match.  Modern considerations such as [[television]] coverage and the tight travel schedule of most leading golfers have led to this practice being almost entirely abandoned, and in all but the most important tournaments, the champion is determined by sudden death. All players tied after the completion of regulation play are taken to a predetermined hole, and then play it and others in order as needed. If at least two players are tied, player(s) who score higher on a hole than the other competitors is/are immediately eliminated, and those still tied continue play until one remaining player has a lower score for a hole than any of the others remaining, who is declared the winner.

Of the four men's [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]], only [[Masters Tournament|The Masters]] uses a sudden-death playoff format, first used in [[1979 Masters Tournament|1979]]. Through [[2017 U.S. Open (golf)|2017]] (and last used in [[2008 U.S. Open (golf)|2008]]), the {{nowrap|[[U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]}} had an 18-hole playoff at stroke play on the day after the main tournament, with sudden-death if needed after 18 holes. A two-hole aggregate playoff is used since [[2018 U.S. Open (golf)|2018]], followed by sudden-death if needed.&lt;ref name=abandn18&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.espn.com/golf/story/_/id/22586395/us-open-abandons-18-holes-2-hole-playoff |work=ESPN |agency=Associated Press |title=U.S. Open abandons 18 holes for 2-hole playoff |date=February 26, 2018 |accessdate=June 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; First used in [[1989 Open Championship|1989]], [[The Open Championship]] uses a four-hole total-stroke playoff, while the [[PGA Championship]] uses a three-hole total-stroke playoff, first used in [[2000 PGA Championship|2000]]. The PGA Championship introduced the sudden-death playoff to the majors in [[1977 PGA Championship|1977]]&lt;ref name=pgahist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/pgachampionship/2012/history/championship_history.cfm |publisher=PGA of America|title=PGA Championship: history|accessdate=June 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used it seven times through [[1996 PGA Championship|1996]]. Sudden death is used if a tie exists at the end of the scheduled playoff.

==Ice hockey==
Sudden-death overtime has traditionally been used in playoff and championship games in hockey. It has been used in the [[National Hockey League]] throughout the league's history. The first NHL game with sudden-death overtime was game four of the [[1919 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Currently, the NHL, [[American Hockey League]], and [[ECHL]] also use the sudden-death system in their regular seasons, playing a five-minute overtime period when the score is tied at the end of regulation time.

In 2000, the AHL reduced the teams to four players each during the five-minute overtime.  (But any two-man advantage is administered with five-on-three play rather than four-on-two.)  The ECHL and NHL both changed to the four-on-four overtime format in 2001, with the [[International Olympic Committee]] following by no later than 2010. By 2015 the NHL went to the three-on-three format.  In the [[Southern Professional Hockey League|SPHL]], a class A minor league, the overtime is three-on-three, with the team that would be on the power play given a fourth, and a fifth attacker respectively instead, and any penalty in the final two minutes results in a [[penalty shot]] instead of a power play.

If neither team scores during this period, the teams use a penalty-shot shootout, consisting of three players in the NHL or five players in the minor leagues, to determine the winner.  In the NHL, if no team wins this shootout, a 1-by-1, sudden-death shootout ensues. No player may shoot twice until every non-goaltender on the bench has taken a shot.

During championship playoffs, however, all games are played to a conclusion resulting in a victory for one team and a loss for the other.  These are true sudden-death games, which have gone on into as many as six additional full 20-minute periods with five players, instead of the five-minute period with at least three players.

IIHF hockey uses a penalty-shot shootout for gold medal games if neither team scores after one 20-minute, sudden-death overtime period. The shootout is decided in best-of-5 rounds, then round by round (in other words, if one team scores in the 6th round or beyond and the other fails, the game ends, unlike most professional leagues), and players can shoot as many times as the team desires (first 5 rounds are done in order, then reversely thereafter; may use new or same players). (There is a 5-minute overtime in round-robin games [10 minutes in elimination/bronze medal games], plus the best-of-5-round [best-of-3 rounds in round robin] shootout procedure in elimination/bronze medal games.)

==Judo==
In the case of a tie in competition [[judo]], the match proceeds to Golden Score, another form of Sudden Death. Sudden Death in competition Judo consists of a 5 minute long match, during which the first competitor to achieve a score is awarded the match. Penalties in Judo award points to the other competitor, making fair-play of absolute importance. If no victor is decided in Golden Score, the match is decided based on a Referee's Decision. A Referee's Decision is a vote amongst the Referee and both Judges of the match.

==Mixed martial arts==
In [[mixed martial arts]] competitions that consist of an even number of rounds, a type of sudden death is sometimes used in the event that each competitor wins an equal number of points. This is not a true sudden death that ends on the first point scored, since MMA competitions do not generally score individual points. Rather, it is a final round of combat, the winner of which is declared the winner of the match. This particular rule, known as "Sudden Victory", has been commonly seen in previous seasons of the [[reality television]] show ''[[The Ultimate Fighter]]'' when the competition has consisted of two rounds.  A sudden victory round rule was also implemented in the tournament to decide [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]]'s first Flyweight Champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mma-cagewriter/sudden-death-round-tap-ufc-flyweight-tournament-182515404.html |title=Sudden death round on tap for UFC’s flyweight tournament |first=Maggie |last=Handricks |publisher=Yahoo Sports |date=February 24, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional wrestling==
Sudden death in wrestling is most commonly seen in Real Canadian Wrestling tournament matches, in which a victor must be decided. This happens in the case of a double knockout or double countout. In the United States, Sudden Death rules occurs mainly in an [[Iron Man match]] when there is a tie after the time limit have expired. (Most notably at [[Wrestlemania XII]] when the match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and [[Bret Hart]] ended 0-0 after the 60 minute limit)

An example that invoked sudden death occurred in the [[Royal Rumble (2005)|2005 Royal Rumble]]. [[John Cena]] and [[Dave Batista|Batista]] were left, and both men's feet touched the ground at the same time. A comparable draw leading to sudden death might happen if the shoulders of a wrestler applying a submission move are on the mat.

==Rugby league==
{{further|List of National Rugby League golden point games}}
Drawn [[National Rugby League]] premiership and [[State of Origin series]] games are subject to sudden death extra time after 80 minutes of play, called the [[golden point]]. Golden point consists of two five-minute halves, with the teams swapping ends at the end of the first half.

Any score (try, penalty goal, or field goal) in golden point wins the game for the scoring team - no [[Try#Conversion|conversion]] is attempted if a try is the winning score.

In the NRL, the victor in golden point receives two competition points, the loser none.  In the event that no further scoring occurs, the game is drawn, and each team receives one point each.

==Rugby union==
In the knockout stages of rugby competitions, most notably the [[Rugby World Cup]], a match drawn after 80 minutes does not proceed immediately to sudden death conditions. Two 10-minute extra time periods are played first, if scores are level after 100 minutes then the rules call for a single sudden-death period of 10 minutes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Rugby World Cup|url = http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|website = www.rugbyworldcup.com|access-date = 2016-02-09|last = rugbybworldcup.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160201091833/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/tournament-rules|archivedate = 2016-02-01|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; If the sudden-death extra time period results in no scoring a kicking competition is used to determine the winner.

However, no match in the history of the Rugby World Cup has ever gone past 100 minutes into a sudden-death extra time period.

==Tennis and volleyball==
In contrast with the usual sudden-death procedure of awarding the victory to the next side to score, [[tennis]] and [[volleyball]] require that the margin of victory be two.  A volleyball game tied at the target score continues until one team's score exceeds the other's by two points.

The traditional requirement that a tennis [[Tennis score|set]] be won by two games sometimes resulted in men's five-set matches lasting over six hours (including an [[Isner–Mahut match at the 2010 Wimbledon Championships|8-hour 11-minute set at Wimbledon]]) or, in women's/doubles' three-set matches, lasting over three hours, which is a major disruption to a television schedule.  To shorten matches, sets tied at six games each can now be broken by a single tiebreaker game.  This is awarded to the first player to score seven points.  The winner must lead the loser by two points, so tiebreaker games can become lengthy in their own right.

Tiebreakers are not used in major tournaments in the final set, except at the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|US Open]] &amp; the [[Tennis at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8377">In [[mathematics]] and [[computer science]], the '''syntactic monoid''' ''M''(''L'') of a [[formal language]] ''L'' is the smallest [[monoid]] that [[recognizable set|recognizes]] the language ''L''.

==Syntactic quotient==
The [[free monoid]] on a given [[set (mathematics)|set]] is the monoid whose elements are all the [[string (computer science)|strings]] of zero or more elements from that set, with [[string concatenation]] as the monoid operation and the [[empty string]] as the [[identity element]]. Given a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a free monoid &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, one may define sets that consist of formal left or right [[Inverse element#In a unital magma|inverses of elements]] in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;.  These are called [[Quotient of a formal language|quotients]], and one may define right or left quotients, depending on which side one is concatenating. Thus, the '''right quotient''' of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; by an element &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is the set
:&lt;math&gt;S \ / \ m=\{u\in M \;\vert\; um\in S \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the '''left quotient''' is

:&lt;math&gt;m \setminus S=\{u\in M \;\vert\; mu\in S \}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Syntactic equivalence==
The syntactic quotient induces an [[equivalence relation]] on ''M'', called the '''syntactic relation''', or '''syntactic equivalence'''  (induced by ''S''). The right syntactic equivalence is the equivalence relation

:&lt;math&gt;\sim_S \;= \{(s,t)\in M\times M \,\vert\; S \ / \ s = S \ / \ t \}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, the left syntactic relation is

:&lt;math&gt;\,_S\sim \;= \{(s,t)\in M\times M \,\vert\; s\setminus S = t \setminus S \}.&lt;/math&gt;

The '''syntactic congruence''' or '''[[John Myhill|Myhill]] congruence'''&lt;ref name=Hol160&gt;Holcombe (1982) p.160&lt;/ref&gt; may be defined as&lt;ref name=Law210&gt;Lawson (2004) p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s \equiv_S t \Leftrightarrow \forall x, y\in M (xsy \in S \Leftrightarrow xty \in S).&lt;/math&gt;

The definition extends to a congruence defined by a subset ''S'' of a general monoid ''M''.  A '''disjunctive set''' is a subset ''S'' such that the syntactic congruence defined by ''S'' is the equality relation.&lt;ref name=Law232&gt;Lawson (2004) p.232&lt;/ref&gt;

Let us call &lt;math&gt;[s]_S&lt;/math&gt; the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; for the syntactic congruence.
The syntactic congruence is [[Quotient algebra|compatible]] with concatenation in the monoid, in that one has

:&lt;math&gt;[s]_S[t]_S=[st]_S&lt;/math&gt;

for all &lt;math&gt;s,t\in M&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the syntactic quotient is a [[monoid morphism]], and induces a [[quotient monoid]]

:&lt;math&gt;M(S)= M \ / \ {\equiv_S}.&lt;/math&gt;

This monoid &lt;math&gt;M(S)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''syntactic monoid''' of ''S''.
It can be shown that it is the smallest [[monoid]] that [[recognizable set|recognizes]] ''S''; that is, ''M''(''S'') recognizes ''S'', and for every monoid ''N'' recognizing ''S'', ''M''(''S'') is a quotient of a [[submonoid]] of ''N''. The syntactic monoid of ''S'' is also the [[transition monoid]] of the [[minimal automaton]] of ''S''.&lt;ref name=Hol160/&gt;&lt;ref name=Law210/&gt;&lt;ref name=S55&gt;Straubing (1994) p.55&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, a language ''L'' is regular if and only if the family of quotients

:&lt;math&gt;\{m \setminus  L \,\vert\; m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt;

is finite.&lt;ref name=Hol160&gt;Holcombe (1982) p.160&lt;/ref&gt;  The proof showing equivalence is quite easy. Assume that a string ''x'' is read by a [[deterministic finite automaton]], with the machine proceeding into state ''p''.  If ''y'' is another string read by the machine, also terminating in the same state ''p'', then clearly one has &lt;math&gt;x \setminus  L\,= y \setminus  L&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt; is at most equal to the number of states of the automaton and &lt;math&gt;\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in L\}&lt;/math&gt; is at most the number of final states. Assume, conversely, that the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. One can then construct an automaton where &lt;math&gt;Q=\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of states, &lt;math&gt;F=\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in L\}&lt;/math&gt; is the set of final states, the language ''L'' is the initial state, and the transition function is given by &lt;math&gt;y\setminus(x \setminus L)  =(xy) \setminus L&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, this automaton recognizes ''L''. Thus, a language ''L'' is recognizable if and only if the set &lt;math&gt;\{m \setminus L \,\vert\; m\in M\}&lt;/math&gt; is finite. Note that this proof also builds the minimal automaton.

Given a [[regular expression]] ''E'' representing ''S'', it is easy to compute the syntactic monoid of ''S''.

A '''group language''' is one for which the syntactic monoid is a [[Group (mathematics)|group]].&lt;ref name=Sak342&gt;Sakarovitch (2009) p.342&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
* Let ''L'' be the language over ''A'' = {''a'',''b''} of words of even length.  The syntactic congruence has two classes, ''L'' itself and ''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, the words of odd length.  The syntactic monoid is the group of order 2 on {''L'',''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}.&lt;ref name=S54&gt;Straubing (1994) p.54&lt;/ref&gt;  
* The [[bicyclic monoid]] is the syntactic monoid of the [[Dyck language]] (the language of balanced sets of parentheses).
* The [[free monoid]] on ''A'' (|''A''| &gt; 1) is the syntactic monoid of the language { ''ww''&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; | ''w'' in ''A''* }, where ''w''&lt;sup&gt;R&lt;/sup&gt; denotes the reversal of word ''w''.

The '''Theory of Narrative Thought''' is a theory of thought designed to bridge the gap between the [[Brain|neurological functioning of the brain]] and the flow of everyday [[Consciousness|conscious experience.]] Proposed by Lee Roy Beach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Decision making: Linking narratives and action|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2009|journal = Narrative Inquiry|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The psychology of narrative thought: How the stories we tell ourselves shape our lives.|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2010|journal = Bloomington IN: Xlibris|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Cognitive errors and the narrative nature of epistemic thought|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 2011|journal = Perspectives on thinking, judging, and decision making.|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = Universitesforlaget.|editor-first = W.|editor-last = Brun|editor2-last = Keren|editor2-first = G.|editor3-last = Kirkebøen|editor3-first = G.|editor4-last = Montgomery|editor4-first = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theory is expanded by Beach, Byron Bissell, and James Wise (2016).

==Background==

	The theory of narrative thought (TNT) is a refinement of image theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Image theory: Decision making in personal and organizational contexts|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|publisher = Wiley|year = 1990|isbn = |location = Chichester UK|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Image theory: Principles, goals, and plans in decision making|last = Beach|first = Lee Roy|date = 1987|journal = Acta Psychologica|doi = 10.1016/0001-6918(87)90034-5|pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Mitchell|first2 = T. R. |volume=66 |pages=201–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was developed as an alternative to [[rational choice theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theory of games and economic behavior|last = von Neumann|first = J.|publisher = Princeton University Press|year = 1947|isbn = |location = Princeton NJ|pages = |last2 = Morgenstern|first2 = O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The essence of image theory is that decisions are shaped by long-term attempts to manage the future rather than short-term results. The image theory model of the decision process, called the compatibility test, held up in both laboratory and field tests (Beach, L. R., &amp; Connolly, T. (2005). The Psychology of Decision Making: People in Organizations. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage) and has been retained, but renamed, as the discrepancy test in TNT.

	Image theory’s weakness was its failure to adequately specify the concept of image.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Subsequent attempts to specify it led to its replacement by narrative, the specification of which was based upon the work of Walter R. Fisher (1987) in [[Communication theory|communications theory]]. Exploration of the specification’s implications led to TNT, in which [[narrative]] is supposed to be the natural mode of human thought in a story that defines what led up to this moment, what is happening now, and what can be expected to happen in the future. This, in turn, led to examination of the apparently “natural” urge to think narratively and its roots in known neurological processes that format neural events in a rudimentary narrative form. This, in turn, led to the view that narrative thinking is a product of [[evolution]].

==Narrative development==
The theory of narrative thought (TNT) describes the brain as being composed of subsystems that act together to give rise to consciousness. Some of these subsystems, such as perception and memory, contribute content to consciousness. One subsystem in the [[Lateralization of brain function|left hemisphere]] codes the content in language while a corresponding subsystem in the right hemisphere links it with emotions. Working together as a single system, called the “interpreter,” they organize the content of consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Who’s in charge? Free will and the science of the brain|last = Gazzaniga|first = M. S.|publisher = HarperCollins|year = 2011|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This order is the origin of narrative but at this point it is rudimentary, a proto-narrative. The proto-narrative is simple but up-to-date; it reflects what is happening at the moment. For infants, proto-narratives are pretty much the whole story, but as memories are formed, past proto-narratives become linked with present proto-narratives and, as caregivers lend a hand, more elaborate narratives take shape. As a store of elaborated narratives develops, proto-narratives continue to update them with current information from the [[perceptual system]]. This keeps the narratives aware of what is going on in the internal and external environments. Over time, two kinds of narratives develop.

== Two kinds of narrative ==
Chronicle narratives are about what happened in the past, what is happening now, and what is expected to happen in the future. They are the ongoing story of one’s conscious experience. Procedural narratives are about how to do things. They are about the actions one can take to better inform one’s chronicle narratives. They also are about the actions one can take to shape the future by acting directly upon the internal or external environment to produce desired results. Procedural narratives are subordinate to chronicle narratives. When used alone, the word “narrative” refers to chronicle narratives. [Note that chronicle and procedural narratives are parallel to, but not identical to, Daniel Kahneman’s (2011) System 1 and System 2.]

==Nature of narratives==
Narratives are more than just updated memories about what has happened recently. They are the stuff of ongoing conscious experience, of moment-to-moment thinking, of the richness of mental life, and they are the foundations for informed guesses about the future. They are a mixture of memories and of visual, auditory, and other imagery as well as the accompanying emotions. Their elements are symbols that stand for real or imagined events and actors (including oneself), where the actors are animate beings or inanimate forces. The events and actors are linked by causality. Causality implies temporality and, for animate actors, purpose. That is, a narrative consists of a temporal arrangement of events that are purposefully caused by animate beings (including oneself) or are the result of inanimate forces. The narrative’s storyline is its meaning, which is created by a coherent arrangement of the events and actors.

==Causality, plausibility, and coherence==
Causality is the structural backbone of all narratives, both chronicle and procedural. This is because it is the source of narrative temporality. This temporal aspect of causality works retrospectively, from effect to cause, which allows one to account for what is happening now as a result of what has happened in the past. And it works prospectively, from cause to effect, which allows one to set expectations for what will happen in the future as a result of what is happening now and what came before. A good narrative is plausible if its actors’ actions contribute to the story line and are not uncharacteristic, i.e., are reasonably consistent across narratives. A good narrative is coherent if the actions of the actors and the effects of those actions conform to one’s causal rules. In short, a good narrative makes sense in that there are no loose ends.

==Causal rules==
Noncontingent rules are about what to expect to happen as a result of actions by other people or outside forces over which one has no control. Contingent rules are about what one expects to happen as a result of one’s own actions. These rules form the causal linkages among narratives’ elements and are the bases of expected and action projections respectively.

Causal rules tell one what caused something to happen or how to make something happen. Another kind of rule, normative rules, tell one why something should happen. Normative rules are about what qualifies as desirable and what does not. That is, normative rules are standards for what is ethical, right, proper, principled, reasonable, appropriate, preferred, and so on, all of which are one’s values and preferences.

==Current narrative==
The current narrative is the narrative one is focused upon at the moment. It is the narrative that makes sense of what has happened leading up to the present, what is happening right now, and what will happen next. The latter, results from extrapolating the past and present segments of current narrative to make educated guesses about the future. A guess about how the future might unfold if one does not make an effort to change it is called an expected projection and a guess about how the future might unfold as a result of one’s efforts to change it is called an action projection. Both projections are narratives. Both are extrapolations of the current narrative. Both are constructed using one’s store of causal rules. Both are subject to the scrutiny of normative rules. Both are imaginary.

==Decision making==
When the future is projected, based upon the current narrative, the emotions associated with the relevant normative rules provide the criteria for evaluating the desirability of that future. Each feature of the projected future elicits an emotion that reflects how well it meets the relevant standard(s) set by one’s normative rule(s). A positive emotion is elicited if it meets the standard(s) and a negative emotion is elicited if it doesn’t. The strength of the elicited emotion is a function of the degree to which the feature exceeds or falls short of the standard(s). When evaluating the desirability of the projected future, the focus is on the features that fall short of one’s standards—called violations. If the violations are too abundant, too large, or too important, the associated negative emotions mount to a point at which one must conclude that the projected future will be undesirable. When this happens, survival, or simply unacceptable discomfort, dictates that something must be done to change the future so that when it arrives it will be more desirable than if things are simply allowed to happen as they will. The action agenda for changing the future is called a plan and execution of that plan is called implementation. The anticipated result of implementing the plan is the action projection. An acceptable plan is one that offers a sufficiently desirable future, a future that is compatible with one’s values and preferences.

==Plans==
A plan is a narrative about how one intends to go from the present to a more desirable future—how one intends to influence the course of ongoing events in a desirable direction. Like other narratives, plans must be plausible and coherent. Plausibility means that all the relevant elements, including oneself, are included and that their proposed actions are reasonable. Coherence means that the sequence of tactics creates a feasible causal chain from the present to the desired future. Plausibility is revealed by the ease with which one can imagine oneself and other actors engaging in a successful implementation of the plan, even if it will require hard work. Plausibility also requires that this activity seems natural and lifelike, and that success doesn’t rely on unlikely events or unrealistic amounts effort and resources. Coherence is revealed by the completeness of the causal chain of tactics, even though one knows one probably won’t end up doing things exactly as planned. A plan that lacks plausibility and/or coherence inspires little confidence (which is an emotion associated with a normative standard), which prompts its revision or replacement by another plan.

Briefly stated: (1) There are two kinds of narratives: chronicle narratives, which are stories about ongoing events, including the expected future, and procedural narratives, which are stories about how to do things; (2) both kinds of narrative are structured by time and causality and both are “good narratives” if they are plausible and coherent; (3) the undesirability of the expected future is assessed by its failure to meet standards set by one’s values and preferences; (4) action is prompted when the projected future is determined to be so undesirable as to be unacceptable.

==TNT as a theory of mind==

Both Beach (2010) and Beach, Bissell, and Wise (2016) open with a historical description of the ebbing fortunes of “executive mind,” as a scientific concept but how, over the past 50 years, it has come back, albeit on firmer ground, as “the brain.” But while “the brain” may be the new name for “mind,” the fact that the old name continues to be used in both scientific and everyday discourse suggests that the new name doesn’t quite do the job. That is, rather than merely reflecting sloppy usage, the word “mind” reflects something more than merely neural activity in the brain.

Other than the computer analogy and the information processing metaphor, cognitive science has produce no encompassing theory. But it seems to be widely assumed that when such a theory appears, it will necessarily be in terms of brain function to which conscious experience is subsidiary and derivative. TNT challenges this assumption by recognizing that brain functioning and conscious experience are two qualitatively different things. Although subjective experience derives from brain activity, it is not reducible to it. Therefore, the theory recognizes the importance of the brain and how it works, but it also recognizes the importance of conscious experience and how it works. Putting the two together as equally legitimate and complementary provides the “something more” than neural activity in the brain that is implied by the word “mind.”
 
Much has been written about the characteristics of mind, mostly by philosophers. The commonalities across those discussions reveals three primary characteristics that a theory of mind should address and that are, in fact, addressed by TNT: Thinking that is both reflective and reflexive—that is able to consider both itself and things other than itself. Knowing that allows distinctions between truth and falsity, error and ignorance, and belief and opinion. Purpose that results in actions aimed at foreseen objectives. In addition, TNT addresses the most common questions raised in these philosophical discussions: How does the mind operate? What are its “intrinsic excellences or defects?” How is it related to matter, to bodily organs, to material conditions, and to other minds? Is it possessed in common with animals? Does it exist separate from corporeality? Insofar as the theory adequately deals with these characteristics and answers these questions, it qualifies as a modern theory of mind.

'''Trench shoring''' is the process of bracing the walls of a [[trench]] to prevent collapse and [[Cave-in (excavation)|cave-ins]].  The phrase can also be used as a noun to refer to the materials used in the process.&lt;ref&gt;"shore, n. 3." def, 1. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods can be used to shore up a trench.  Hydraulic shoring is the use of [[hydraulic piston]]s that can be pumped outward until they press up against the trench walls.  They are typically combined with steel plate or a special heavy [[plywood]] called Finform.  Another method is called beam and plate, in which [[steel]] [[I-beam]]s are driven into the ground and steel plates are slid in amongst them.  A similar method that uses wood planks is called soldier boarding.  Hydraulics tend to be faster and easier; the other methods tend to be used for longer term applications or larger excavations.

Shoring should not be confused with shielding by means of [[trench shield]]s.  Shoring is designed to prevent collapse, whilst shielding is only designed to protect workers should collapse occur. Most professionals agree that shoring is the safer approach of the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crandall|first1=David|title=What is Trench Shoring?|url=http://www.iconjds.com/what-is-trench-shoring/|publisher=ICON Equipment|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant [[Phonology|phonological]] variation among the various [[Yiddish dialects]]. The description that follows is of a modern Standard Yiddish that was devised during the early [[20th century]] and is frequently encountered in pedagogical contexts.

* {{IPA|/m, p, b/}} are [[Bilabial consonant|bilabial]], whereas {{IPA|/f, v/}} are [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental]].{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}
* The {{IPA|/l – ʎ/}} contrast has collapsed in some speakers.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}
* The palatalized coronals {{IPA|/nʲ, tsʲ, dzʲ, tʃʲ, dʒʲ, sʲ, zʲ/}} appear only in Slavic loanwords.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}} The phonemic status of these palatalised consonants, as well as any other affricates, is unclear.
* {{IPA|/k, ɡ, ɣ/}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} are [[Velar consonant|velar]], whereas {{IPA|/j, ʎ/}} are [[Palatal consonant|palatal]].{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}
** {{IPA|[ŋ]}} is an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} after {{IPA|/k, ɡ/}}, and it can only be syllabic {{IPA|[ŋ̍]}}.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}
* The phonetic realization of {{IPA|/χ/}} and {{IPA|/nʲ/}} is unclear:
** In the case if {{IPA|/χ/}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kleine|2003}} puts it in the "velar" column, but consistently uses a symbol denoting a voiceless ''uvular'' fricative {{angbr|{{IPA|χ}}}} to transcribe it. It is thus safe to assume that {{IPA|/χ/}} is phonetically uvular {{IPAblink|χ}}.
** In the case of {{IPA|/nʲ/}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Kleine|2003}} puts it in the "palatalized" column. This can mean that it is either palatalized alveolar {{IPA|[nʲ]}} or alveolo-palatal {{IPAblink|ɲ̟}}. {{IPA|/ʎ/}} may actually also be alveolo-palatal {{IPAblink|ʎ̟}}, rather than just palatal.
* The rhotic {{IPA|/r/}} can be either alveolar or uvular, either a trill {{IPA|[{{IPA link|r}} ~ {{IPA link|ʀ}}]}} or, more commonly, a flap/tap {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɾ}} ~ {{IPA link|ʀ̆}}]}}.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}
* The glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}} appears only as an intervocalic separator.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}}

As in the [[Slavic languages]] with which Yiddish was long in [[language contact|contact]] ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]), but unlike [[German language|German]], [[voiceless consonant|voiceless]] stops have little to no [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]; unlike many such languages, voiced stops are not devoiced in final position.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=262}} Moreover, Yiddish has regressive [[phonation|voicing]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], so that, for example, {{lang|yi|זאָגט}} {{IPA|/zɔɡt/}} ('says') is pronounced {{IPA|[zɔkt]}} and {{lang|yi|הקדמה}} {{IPA|/hakˈdɔmɜ/}} ('foreword') is pronounced {{IPA|[haɡˈdɔmɜ]}}.

==Vowels==
The [[vowel]] phonemes of Standard Yiddish are:

{|class="wikitable"
|+Yiddish [[monophthong]]s{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=263}}
!
! [[Front vowel|Front]]
! [[Central vowel|Central]]

| {{IPA link|ɜ}}
| {{IPA link|ɔ}}
|- align=center

|
|
|}

* {{IPA|/ɪ, ʊ/}} are [[Near-close vowel|near-close]] {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ɪ}}, {{IPA link|ʊ}}]}}, but {{IPA|/ɪ/}} may sometimes be realized as close {{IPAblink|i}}. These allophones are more or less in free variation, but they could have been separate phonemes in the past.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=263}}
* {{IPA|/ɜ/}} appears only in [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] syllables.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=263}}

! Central nucleus
! Back nucleus
|-
| align=center | {{IPA|ɛɪ}}
| align=center | {{IPA|aɪ}}
| align=center | {{IPA|ɔɪ}}
|}

* The last two diphthongs may be realized as {{IPA|[aɛ]}} and {{IPA|[ɔɜ]}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Kleine|2003|p=263}}

In addition, the [[sonorant]]s {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} can function as [[syllable#Nucleus|syllable nuclei]]:
*אײזל  {{IPA|/ˈɛɪzl̩/}} 'donkey'
*אָװנט  {{IPA|/ˈɔvn̩t/}} 'evening'

{{IPA|[m]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} appear as syllable nuclei as well, but only as allophones of {{IPA|/n/}}, after bilabial consonants and [[dorsal consonant]]s, respectively.

The syllabic sonorants are always unstressed.

==Comparison with German==
{{see also|High German consonant shift|Germanic umlaut}}
In vocabulary of Germanic origin, the differences between Standard German and Standard Yiddish pronunciation are mainly in the [[vowel]]s and [[diphthong]]s. Examples are the German long {{IPA|/aː/}} as in ''Vater'' ('father'), which corresponds to {{IPA|/ɔ/}} in Yiddish  {{lang|yi|פֿאָטער}} {{IPA|/ˈfɔtɛr/}}, and the German long {{IPA|/eː/}} and long {{IPA|/oː/}}, which correspond to diphthongs in Yiddish ({{IPA|/ɛɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}}). As in many Germanic languages, Yiddish lacks the German [[front rounded vowel]]s {{IPA|/œ, øː/}} and {{IPA|/ʏ, yː/}}. They are replaced in Yiddish by {{IPA|/ɛ/}} (in the case of the short {{IPA|/œ/}}), {{IPA|/ɛɪ/}} (in the case of the long {{IPA|/øː/}}) and {{IPA|/ɪ/}} (in the case of {{IPA|/ʏ, yː/}}), respectively.

Diphthongs have also undergone divergent developments in German and Yiddish. Where Standard German has merged the [[Middle High German]] diphthong ''ei'' and long vowel ''ī'' to ''ei'' (pronounced {{IPA|/aɪ/}}), Standard Yiddish has maintained the distinction between them as {{IPA|/ɛɪ/}} and {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, respectively. The German {{IPA|/aʊ/}} (as in ''kaufen'', 'buy') corresponds to the Yiddish {{IPA|/ɔɪ/}} (in  {{lang|yi|קױפֿן}} {{IPA|/kɔɪfn/}}); lastly, the German {{IPA|/ɔʏ/}}, as in ''Deutsch'' 'German') corresponds to {{IPA|/aɪ/}} in Yiddish (in  {{lang|yi|דײַטש}} {{IPA|/daɪtʃ/}}). Another difference is that the [[vowel length]] distinctions of German do not exist in Standard Yiddish.

There are consonantal differences between German and Yiddish. Yiddish [[lenition|deaffricates]] the Middle High German [[voiceless labiodental affricate]] {{IPA|/pf/}} to {{IPA|/f/}} initially (as in {{lang|yi|פֿונט}} ''funt''; though this pronunciation is also quasi-standard throughout northern and central Germany); /pf/ surfaces as an [[High German consonant shift|unshifted]] {{IPA|/p/}} medially or finally (as in {{lang|yi|עפּל}} {{IPA|/ɛpl/}} and {{lang|yi|קאָפּ}} {{IPA|/kɔp/}}). Additionally, final voiced stops appear in Standard Yiddish but not Northern Standard German.

'''Yuracaré''' (also '''Yurakaré''', '''Yurakar''', '''Yuracare''', '''Yurucare''', '''Yuracar''', '''Yurakare''', '''Yurujuré''', '''Yurujare''') is an [[endangered language|endangered]] [[language isolate]] of central [[Bolivia]] in  [[Cochabamba Department|Cochabamba]] and [[Beni Department|Beni]] departments spoken by the [[Yuracaré]] people.

There are approximately 2,500 speakers. These numbers are in decline as the youngest generation no longer learns the language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpi.nl/DOBES/projects/yurakare Documentation of Endangered Languages].&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Language death]].)

Yuracaré is documented with a grammar based on an old missionary manuscript by de la Cueva (Adam 1893). The language is currently being studied by Rik van Gijn. A [[Foundation for Endangered Languages]] grant was awarded for a Yuracaré–Spanish / Spanish–Yuracaré dictionary project in 2005.

==Genealogical relations==

Suárez (1977) suggests a relationship between Yuracaré and the [[Mosetenan]], [[Pano–Tacanan]], [[Arawakan]], and [[Chon]] families. His earlier ''Macro-Panoan'' proposal is the same minus Arawakan (Suárez 1969).
