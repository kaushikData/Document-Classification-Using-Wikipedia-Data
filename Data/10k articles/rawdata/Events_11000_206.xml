On 14 March 1961 an aircraft accident occurred near [[Yuba City, California]]. A United States Air Force [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52F-70-BW Stratofortress]] bomber, AF Serial No. ''57-0166'', c/n 464155, carrying two nuclear weapons departed from [[Mather Air Force Base]] near [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. According to the official Air Force report, the aircraft experienced an [[uncontrolled decompression]] that required it to descend to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} in order to lower the [[cabin pressurization|cabin altitude]]. Increased fuel consumption caused by having to fly at lower altitude, combined with the inability to rendezvous with a tanker in time caused the aircraft to run out of fuel. The aircrew ejected safely, and then the unmanned aircraft crashed {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of Yuba City,&lt;ref name="JNACC"&gt;{{cite web

The crew ejected, the aircraft broke up and four onboard nuclear weapons were released. The weapons' multiple safety interlocks prevented both a nuclear explosion and release of radioactive material. LTC McGill, based on his SAC experience, blames the aircrew failures on the use of [[dexedrine]] to combat fatigue on the 24-hour flight preceding the accident.

The weapons did not detonate as their safety devices worked properly.&lt;ref name="arrow"&gt;{{cite book

The following timeline is an abridged version of the description transcribed by Oskins and Maggelet&lt;ref name="arrow"/&gt; from a declassified copy of the original Air Force accident report. Doe 11 was the aircraft call sign. Doe 13 was a second B-52 in formation for the first portion of the flight.

All times are hours and minutes after takeoff.

0:20  –  the pilot first noticed excessive hot air coming from the pilots' vents. All attempts to control this hot air were unsuccessful.

6:00  –  Mather Command Post contacted the aircraft on HF radio. The heat problem was discussed and wing guidance received. This consisted of several suggested corrective actions which were verified by the pilot as having been used earlier without success.

6:30  – Mather control room called the aircraft on HF radio and discussed the heat problem and the effects of the heat on the aircraft electronics and crew personnel. Wing guidance at this time was to continue the mission.

6:50  –  Mather control room contacted the aircraft and Wing guidance was to "continue mission as long as you can; call us back after second refueling tonight and advise us of your status, if it gets intolerable, of course, bring it home."

11:15  –  Mather control called Doe 11 to see if he would complete the mission. At that the response was, "We are going to try."

12:35  –  Mather control was contacted by Doe 11 and told that Doe 13's refueling was completed and "we are about ready to take off."  Control asked, "Your present status . . . has it improved?"  The pilot answered "Negative . . . worse . . . number 3 engine setting at 70% . . . we had it once before and it cleared up but at this time it has not cleared as yet."  Control advised, "Understand you will proceed on course and we will be looking for you tomorrow."

14:00  –  the outside panel of the pilot's L-4 window shattered. The heat in the cockpit was unbearable at this time and had cracked the glass case for the ball on both pilot's and co-pilot's turn and slip indicators. It is estimated that the upper compartment heat level ranged from 125–160 degrees F or higher during this period. A decision was made to depressurize the aircraft and attempt to continue the mission. Altitude was 33,500 feet.

14:20  –  after 20 minutes of unpressurized flight, the decision was made to descend to 12,000 feet and continue the mission as far as possible at this altitude.

15:00  –  Mather control contacted Doe 11 and asked "Which windshield is cracked and what is your present altitude?"  Answer received, "The L-4 window shattered, heat unbearable at altitude, two sick crew members. We have descended to 12,000 feet and plan to go 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 and return direct to Mather."  They were advised to "proceed as planned, recommend you stay low altitude, give us an estimate on your fuel as soon as you get in close enough to contact us."

16:50  –  Mather control contacted Doe 11 via HF radio requesting ETA to Mather. The aircraft reported, "We just passed TP 3.19 at 1212Z, estimate 150 nautical miles north of TP 3.19 at 1239Z, ETA to Mather 1755Z."

18:50  –  Mather control contacted the aircraft through HF radio to check his progress.

19:45  –  McClellan called for flight plan and altitude required from last position to Mather.

20:30  –  aircraft contacted McClellan to ask Early Warning vessel "Hardware" to look out for them and would like a fix.{{Efn|Note: Here the term 'fix' means a determination of position coordinates.  It does not mean 'fix' as in a repair.}}

21:00  –  the aircraft contacted Mather control stating, "We would like a tanker up here and get a little fuel. We now figure we will be over the field at 14,000 pounds. That is a little light. We would like to have a tanker."  And, control answered Doe 11 "will be cleared for a straight in approach and will have tanker standby . . . we will not launch unless you go below 10,000 pounds."

Doe 11's ETA to Mather at this time was given as approximately 22:30 hours after takeoff.

For approximately the next hour, several heading deviations up to 30 degrees were made by the pilot of Doe 11 to circumnavigate the weather associated with a front in this area. Turbulence was moderate. It is estimated from study of weather and Doe 11 pilot and navigator interviews that 7 or 8 minutes were lost during this frontal penetration due to these heading deviations.

21:50  –  Mather was contacted through HF radio and advised he had, "#1 main tank gauge stuck at 10,030 pounds . . . we are not sure just how much fuel we have in it now. We have #2 and one other 1/4 full warning light on and I think it would be a good idea to get that tanker airborne."  Mather Control Room advised, "We have a tanker airborne. Pick him up at Red Bluff VOR and refuel back in this direction. You might keep in mind, if things get a little close up there, head into Beale AFB."  Later in this same conversation, Mather control indicated, "We will get it off the ground here ASAP."

22:10  –  Democrat contacted the aircraft on HF advising, "McClellan is requesting your present position."  The aircraft advised, " . . . just coasted in and looking for our tanker."  This was the last contact through Democrat HF radio.

22:10  –  the tanker was launched.

22:23  –  the bomber and the tanker initiated the head on rendezvous at 70 nautical miles. Normal mileage countdown was used and the bomber turned the tanker at 21 NM. This left Doe 11 flying at 280K IAS approximately 11NM behind the tanker after the tanker rolled out on refueling track. The bomber asked the tanker to slow down. The tanker reduced speed to 200K IAS, and then to 185K IAS. The bomber maintained 280K IAS to approximately 2NM behind this tanker, and then lost power. The pilot had warned the crew earlier of the possibility of bailout and he now alerted them to prepare for bailout. He initiated a 30 degree bank to the west toward a clear area as all engines flamed out together at approximately 22:40 hours after takeoff.

The bailout sequence began at approximately 7,000 feet with an outside temperature of approximately 42 degrees, and was normal except the gunner could not jettison his turret despite full strength pull on the inner emergency release handle. The gunner was called forward and bailed out the navigator hatch, using the spare chute in the forward compartment. The pilot continued to guide the aircraft toward a clear area. The crew continued to bail out in order of navigator, spare navigator, spare pilot, EW, gunner, co-pilot and radar navigator. The pilot bailed out at 4,000 feet. The aircraft was trimmed and calculated to be at approximately a 21:1 glide ratio at this time. The aircraft made one complete 360 degree left turn and crashed into a clear flat barley field area 15.75 miles west of Yuba County Airport, California, at approximately 22:50 after takeoff. The aircraft struck the ground at a 15.3 degree left bank and an estimated attitude of 5 degrees nose down at an indicated airspeed of approximately 200 knots. Impact angle was approximately 45 degrees.

The '''2014 FIA International Hill Climb Cup''' was the first edition of the [[FIA International Hill Climb Cup]], after the merging of the FIA European Hill Climb Cup and the FIA International Hill Climb Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fia.com/news/creation-international-hill-climb-cup-2014&lt;/ref&gt; The season consisted of fourteen rounds, starting on 27 April with the Subida Internacional Ubrique Benaocaz in Spain, and ended on 5 October with the Bergrennen Mickhausen in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fia.com/news/hill-climb-latest-decisions-and-2014-calendars&lt;/ref&gt;

In Category 1, Bulgaria's Nikolay Zlatkov was the inaugural champion, winning three events during the season. He won the championship by 35 points ahead of Italian driver Fulvio Giuliani, who also won three events. Third place in the championship went to Karl Schagerl of Austria, who won his home event of the Sankt Andrae. The remaining events were shared between Igor Drotár, Andreas Gabat, Raúl Borreguero, Tomasz Nagorski and Tiago Reis, while Fausto Bormolini won the last two events during the season, but was ineligible to score championship points. In Category 2, Václav Janík of the Czech Republic was crowned champion by 21 points ahead of Switzerland's Tiziano Riva with another Czech driver, Jiří Svoboda, edging out Simone Faggioli by half a point for third place in the final championship standings.

'''AberFest''' is a Celtic cultural festival celebrating all things Cornish and Breton that takes place every second year in Cornwall, UK, around Easter. The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh – Kernow Festival which is held in [[Brandivy]] or [[Bignan]] in [[Brittany]], alternating between those two Breton locations.

Both festivals are unusual in that the main focus of the events is on families and individuals from one country staying with families and individuals from the other, against a wide background of cultural activities.

An AberFest was last held at Easter 2016. The next AberFest will be 31 March to 2 April 2018.

== Background ==
[[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]] have [[Celt]]ic links going back centuries and have closely related [[Celtic languages]] and many other traditions that are practised in both countries. Both AberFest and the Breizh – Kernow Festival celebrate these cultures in their traditional and more recent forms.

5th–7th centuries saw a mass emigration of Cornish people to "Armorica."  These people were to become the Breton people of modern Brittany. Their language was the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] Celtic language that was to become [[Breton language]] (Brezhoneg) in Brittany, the Cornish language ([[Kernewek]]) in Cornwall and the Welsh language ([[Cymraeg]]) in Wales. Although they are separate languages today they remain closely related.

Throughout the centuries since the first emigrations, there have been continued links and movements of people, up to and including the [[World War II|Second World War]], when small numbers of Breton people escaped German-occupied Brittany to live in Cornwall.

While the practical working lives of ordinary fishermen were a common sight in ports in both Cornwall and Brittany in the 1960s and later, other links have gone through periods of popularity, including [[Cornish wrestling|Cornish]] and Breton wrestling. This saw regular exchange competitions in the inter war years and sporadic interest ever since.

== The modern era ==
The late 1970s and 1980s saw a great deal of interest in Inter Celtic organisations and activities. The International [[Celtic Congress]] had been very active in the Celtic world through much of the 20th Century, but saw a new  enthusiasm in Cornwall as the "Cornish movement" looked to other Celtic countries for support and ideas in facing the decline in cultural self-confidence that was very evident at that time. Around the same time the Pan Celtic Festivals had led to the establishment of an independent Inter Celtic festival, "Lowender Peran"  in Perranporth, Cornwall each October.

As visitors to this Festival, Katrine Pasco and her husband Patrick Lorho, travelled to Cornwall and made friends with a wide number of people with loose involvement with the Cornish movement including Ron Williams (Ronnie) from Falmouth. After several years of visiting Lowender Peran and strengthening links, Pasco and Lorho, organised the first "Breizh – Kernow Festival" in 1987 (Breizh being Breton for Brittany and Kernow being Cornish for Cornwall) in [[Brandivy]], in the [[Morbihan]] region of Brittany.

== Breizh – Kernow Festival ==
The Breizh – Kernow Festival was started with the intention of it being at the Breton part of a Festival alternating between Brittany and Cornwall. The Breizh – Kernow festival was then held most years in Brandivy and later included Bignan. This one sided arrangement persisted until 2002.

The main reason that the festival was not held in Cornwall was that there was a community of like minded people in more or less one geographical location in Brandivy. In Cornwall the links were less involved with a location and more to do with individuals that were spread geographically across Cornwall without a clear location that could be realistically identified as suitable location, nor was there anyone willing to take on the task without such a generally accepted suitable location.

== Ron Williams ==
[[File:Cornish pasty.jpeg|thumb|A Cornish pasty]]
Ron Williams had been a very active individual with many voluntary organisations in Falmouth ( a founder of the Falmouth Youth Club,) and throughout Cornwall and was widely known and respected.

From 1987 onwards, the friendship between Williams and  Pasco, Lorho and their increasing family grew stronger with Williams spending more and more time in his retirement, living with Castel Guen, Brandivy. He also became  an increasingly well known  and popular figure in Brandivy itself.

== Ronnie Fest ==
Ron Williams died on 7 December 2001.

As a memorial, in particular for Bretons the "Ronnie Fest" took place in Falmouth at Easter 2002. Supported by groups such as Cornish dance team "Ros Keltek" the day filled the weekend.

This was a day of celebration of Ron’s life and included organisations and groups with which Ron had worked, in some cases for 40–50 years. Due to the good will towards Ron Williams, in the Falmouth venues, and time were given for free.This included the Easter Sunday afternoon at the Royal Polytechniic Society, and the British Legion Club on the Easter Sunday evening 31 March 2002.

== The first AberFest ==
After a return to Brittany at Easter 2003, the Festival returned to Cornwall as "AberFest’04" and again in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 as AberFest’06, AberFest'08, AberFest'10, AberFest'12 and AberFest'14.

== Festival philosophy ==
Central to the aims of both Breizh – Kernow and AberFest Festivals is the arrangement whereby individuals and families are hosted  by  families from the respective countries. People visiting the festival from one Celtic country stay with families from the host Celtic country.

While there are public events that form the "public" side of the festivals, it is hosting and being hosted with families that is the core of the success of both the festivals. Through this arrangement, lifelong friendships have developed outside the confines of either festival.

The personal friendships between individuals and families form a strength and commitment to the relationship between the two festivals. The importance of the personal relationships has not been understood by some who have seen the more public events as of the prime importance and have mistakenly viewed the way to strengthening the festivals, and AberFest in particular, through greater commercialisation of the events.

Today the basic philosophy continues that performers are not paid and perform for free, putting performers on an equal footing and providing a platform for new and in particular younger performers.

A significant contrast between the two festivals is a reflection on the Cultural strengths within both countries. While Breton culture in Brittany is well established, accepted as part of their regional identity and is not under exceptional pressures within the French State, the situation within Cornwall remains different.

The burgeoning cultural revival within Cornwall now enjoys a greater confidence than in the 1970s or 1980s but it is not universally recognised or accepted, often remaining opaque to those outside the movement.

== AberFest Festival format ==
Although AberFest is a relatively new event, it has established a general event Format:-

Good Friday     Breton guests arrive at suitable Rendezvous via the Roscoff – Plymouth Ferry, by car and bus, in the late evening. They meet their hosts and travel to their homes. A welcoming event includes music by the groups involved in the festival.

Easter Saturday	Free Public performances and processions through Falmouth. A combined dance/concert event featuring Breton Fest Noz and Cornish Ceili, known as the AberFest-Noz takes place in the evening.

Easter Sunday	Morning and lunch with host families followed by a public event at a particular location in West/mid Cornwall. ( previous locations have included Godolphin House and St. Michael’s Mount. )  Workshops in various cultural activities ( these were held on the Saturday in previous years)

Easter Monday: known as Rons Day: morning with families. Afternoon group event. Evening, Group party and Miracle.

== Bryl and Bryl Byghan ==

The icon used for the festival is that of a Mackerel. This has been embodied in various large "mascot" mackerel that have become part of the festival in their own right. Mackerel are fish common to the coasts of both Cornwall and Brittany. The word ''mackerel'' also has certain sexual connotations in both cultures.

At the end of each Festival a mackerel known as "Bryl Byghan" (Cornish for "small mackerel") is "born" in a ceremony called "The Miracle." Bryl Byghan is about 2 feet (70&amp;nbsp;cm) long. After the end of the festival, Bryl Byghan is taken back to Brittany and is passed from family to family during the following year. The following Easter,( approximately 12 months after the Miracle) the festival is held in Brittany. At the end of the Breizh-Kernow festival, Bryl Byghan returns to spend most of the next year circulating with families in Cornwall.

About 2 weeks before the following AberFest, Bryl Byghan drops out of sight to reappear at the start of AberFest as Bryl (Cornish for "mackerel") The "grown up" mascot mackerel is about 4 foot (1.5&amp;nbsp;m) long and becomes the focus of the festival, passing from person to person and it is taken to all events. Bryl is also used as a flag to identify where AberFest host families are during the Festival. In more recent aberfests Byl's appearance has been greeted by the singing of "you are my mackerel" to the tune of [[you are my sunshine]].

As the festival draws to a close, Bryl "dies" in a special "funeral" (Mort de Bryl) As the festival ends, the "dead" Bryl is given to a Breton, selected by previous "dead" Bryl receiving Bretons, who are known as "The Guardians of Bryl." The Guardians of Bryl are also responsible for Bryl's well being during the festival.
The Bryl "funeral" ends with the "miracle" of a "new" Bryl Byghan being "born" to be passed to the Breton families for the next cycle of festivals in Brittany and Cornwall.

Bryl Byghan's adventures with families in Brittany and Cornwall have become events in their own right. Bryl Byghan has become a Facebook member with his own Facebook profile and friends. Regular updates and photographs are posted during the year between festivals.

The success of Bryl and Bryl Byghan has led to the Breizh – Kernow Festival in Brittany adopting a "Cock" as their "mascot." So far the Cock's adventures remain in Bryl Byghan's shadow. Rumours of a Bryl / Cock offspring have led to the anticipation of events in 2011 at the next Breizh – Kernow festival in Brittany.

==Cornish and Breton cultural activities==
Cornish and Breton cultural activities and workshops in previous AberFest festivals have included:-
Dance
Music
Singing, ( individual, group and Choir)
Wrestling	( Breton Gouwren and Cornish Wrestling )
Bombard and Pipes (Bagpipes)
Cooking and 
Language	( Brezhoneg and Kernewek)

The '''Arietids''' are a strong [[meteor shower]] that lasts from May 22 to July 2 each year, and peaks on June 7.

First discovered at [[Jodrell Bank Observatory]] in [[Great Britain|England]] during the summer of 1947, the showers are caused when the Earth passes through a dense portion of two interplanetary meteoroid streams, producing an average of 60 [[Meteoroid|shooting stars]] each hour, that originate in the sky from the constellation [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] and the constellation [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]].&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html|title=Arietids|accessdate=September 7, 2007|publisher=Meteor Showers Online|author=Meteor Showers Online| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071025021939/http://meteorshowersonline.com/showers/daytime_arietids.html| archivedate=October 25, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because both constellations are so close to the Sun when these showers reach their peak, the showers are difficult to view with the naked eye.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt; Some of the early meteors are visible in the very early hours of the morning, usually an hour before dawn.&lt;ref name="four"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://observers.org/tac.mailing.list/2001/june/0109.html |title=Listen...to the Arietids!! |accessdate=September 7, 2007 |publisher=The Astronomy Connection |date=1999 |author=James Turley |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929191104/http://observers.org/tac.mailing.list/2001/june/0109.html |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The meteors strike Earth's atmosphere at speeds around 39&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="one" /&gt;

The '''FIA Asia-Pacific Touring Car Championship''' was a motorsport championship staged in [[1988 Asia-Pacific Touring Car Championship|1988]] and in [[1994 Asia-Pacific Touring Car Championship|1994]]. The 1988 championship was won by [[New Zealand]]'s Trevor Crowe and the 1994 champion was [[Joachim Winkelhock]] from [[Germany]]. Crowe drove a [[BMW M3#E30 M3|BMW M3]] for fellow Kiwi John Sax, while Winkelhock drove a [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|BMW 318i]] for [[Schnitzer Motorsport]]. In 1996–1999 the series was re-vamped into the [[South East Asia Touring Car Zone Challenge]] mainly with local drivers only. In 2000 it changed to the [[Asian Touring Car Series|FIA Asian Touring Car Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://motorsportsresults.com/berlines/Touring.asie.pdf South East Asia Touring Car Zone Challenge history.] {{dead link|date=April 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second '''Battle of Ramla''' (or '''Ramleh''') took place on 17 May 1102 between the [[Crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] and the [[Fatimids]] of [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Pringle | first=Denys | coauthors= | title=The Churches of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem: A Corpus | year=1993 | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge  | isbn=0-521-39037-0 | pages=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The town of [[Ramla]] lay on the road from [[Jerusalem]] to [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]], the latter of which was the largest Fatimid fortress in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. From Ascalon the Fatimid vizier, [[Al-Afdal Shahanshah]], launched almost annual attacks into the newly founded Crusader kingdom from 1099 to 1107. It was thrice the case that the two armies met each other at Ramla. 

Egyptian armies of the period relied on masses of Sudanese bowmen supported by Arab and Berber cavalry. Since the archers were on foot and the horsemen awaited attack with lance and sword, an Egyptian army provided exactly the sort of immobile target that the Frankish heavy cavalry excelled in attacking. Whereas the Crusaders developed a healthy respect for the harass and surround tactics of the Turkish [[horse archer]]s, they tended to discount the effectiveness of the Egyptian armies. While overconfidence led to a Crusader disaster at the second battle of Ramla, the more frequent result was a Fatimid defeat. "The Franks never, until the reign of [[Saladin]], feared the Egyptian as they did the armies from Muslim Syria and Mesopotamia."&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
Despite defeat to the crusaders at the [[Battle of Ramla (1101)|first Battle of Ramla]] the previous year, al-Afdal was soon ready to strike at the crusaders once again and dispatched around 20,000 troops under the command of his son [[Sharaf al-Ma'ali]]. [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] was in [[Jaffa]] when news reached him of the Fatimid invasion force, seeing off survivors of the defeated [[Crusade of 1101]]. [[William IX, Duke of Aquitaine|William of Aquitaine]] had already departed but many others such as [[Stephen II, Count of Blois|Stephen of Blois]] and [[Stephen I, Count of Burgundy|Count Stephen of Burgundy]] had been forced back due to unfavorable winds and consequently joined Baldwin's force in order to help in the battle. Due to faulty reconnaissance Baldwin severely underestimated the size of the Egyptian army, believing it to be no more than a minor expeditionary force, and rode to face an army of several thousand with only two hundred mounted knights and no infantry.&lt;ref name="Asbridge"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Crusades: The War for the Holy Land |author=Thomas Asbridge |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rK8nA9U0OE4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thomas+asbridge+the+crusades&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj24YvdweHYAhWmDsAKHZNzDUQQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=thomas%20asbridge%20the%20crusades&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn=978-1-84983-688-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Realizing his error too late and already cut off from escape, Baldwin and his army were charged by the Egyptian forces and many were quickly slaughtered, although Baldwin and a handful of others managed to barricade themselves in Ramla's single tower. Baldwin was left with no other option than to flee and escaped  the tower under the cover of night with just his scribe and a single knight, Hugh of Brulis, who is never mentioned in any source afterwards. Baldwin spent the next two days evading Fatimid search parties until he arrived exhausted, starved and parched in the reasonably safe haven of [[Arsuf]] on May 19th.&lt;ref name="Asbridge" /&gt; 

The situation of the remaining knights in Ramla deteriorated when Fatimid forces stormed the town on the morning after Baldwin's escape, with only the tower remaining under Crusader control. The Fatimids ruthlessly attacked the tower, undermining walls and setting fires to smoke out the desperate defenders. After a day of desperately holding their ground the remaining knights, all but abandoned by their king, decided to launch a suicidal last stand and charged the besiegers. Almost all of the meagre force was immediately slain including Stephen of Blois, who finally restored the honour that he lost when he deserted the [[Siege of Antioch]] four years previously. However, Conrad of Germany, the constable of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] who had previously led a contingent at the Crusade of 1101, fought so valiantly that even after everyone around him was dead he still fought on, holding off the Fatimids to the point that his awestruck foe offered to spare his life if he surrendered.&lt;ref name="Asbridge" /&gt;

==Siege of Jaffa and Aftermath==
Having recuperated in Arsuf, Baldwin commandeered an English pirate ship to break through the Egyptian blockade of Jaffa while a force of eighty knights under [[Hugh of Fauquembergues|Hugh of Falchenburg]] attempted to break in by land. The victorious Sharaf al-Ma'ali had surrounded the city and, with their king missing and the army presumed destroyed, capitulation seemed inevitable. In order to coax the city into surrender, the Fatimids made the corpse of Gerbod of Scheldewindeke, a knight who had fallen in battle previously,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/families/gundred/gundocs.shtml#1102 Plurimis deinde diebus evolutis et conventu Christianorum de die in diem comminuto, aliis redeuntibus navigio, aliis per diversas regiones in reditu suo dispersis [a list of names, including] Gerbodo de castello Winthinc[1] ...

Albert of Aachen, ''Historia Hierosolymitana'', printed in ''Recueil des Historiens des Croisades, Occidentaux'', vol. 4, pp. 591, 593 (Paris, 1879).&lt;/ref&gt; to look like Baldwin I before mutilating the body and parading it in front of the walls of Jaffa. Gerbod had apparently held a resemblance to Baldwin and the crusaders fell for the ruse, with preparations to flee the city underway when Baldwin arrived just in time. Baldwin's arrival disheartened and Sharaf withdrew, allowing Baldwin time to organize a counterattack. With Baldwin's forces strengthened by the arrival of a fleet of French and German Crusaders, he was able to assemble an army of eight thousand men&lt;ref&gt;Dupuy, p. 316&lt;/ref&gt; and surprised the unprepared Egyptians. Discontent was already arising from Sharaf's indecisive leadership and the Fatimids quickly routed back to Ascalon. Although Baldwin succeeded in defending his kingdom, his miscalculation had cost the lives of a number of prominent knights which the nascent Kingdom of Jerusalem could ill afford to lose. Further Fatimid incursions continued, with the two nations meeting in battle at Ramla [[Battle of Ramla (1105)|for a third time]] in 1105.&lt;ref name="Asbridge" /&gt;

Since May 2013, BottleRock Napa Valley Music Festival has drawn rock &amp; roll enthusiasts to California’s premiere wine country. When it first began, it seemed to locals that the idea of a four-day music festival in upscale Napa was completely incompatible, and not the greatest plan. But organizers determined to hold the festival at the park-like area of the Napa Valley Expo situated alongside the river in downtown Napa. The two square miles of riverfront offered a cozy location for concerts, and the organizers clearly advertised which acts played on each day. The idea was to focus on selling more single-day-tickets. Fans wouldn’t have trouble finding places to spend the night. No camping was allowed at the site, and attendees would need to leave their cars in satellite lots and transfer into the concert area on shuttles. Plenty of attention was focused on crowd management, and even more was directed toward booking established artists for the event.

==Portraits==
The artist, initially unidentified, was eventually revealed to be Conor Casby, a school teacher in his thirties from Claremorris, [[County Mayo]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The first portrait was surreptitiously hung in the [[National Gallery of Ireland]] on 7 March 2009.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt; Casby is said to have entered the National Gallery carrying a shoulder bag,&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; and located a free space for his portrait and its caption among other portraits of prominent Irish people such as [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], [[W. B. Yeats]], and [[Bono]].&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; Casby then left the building unnoticed by security.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt; It was reported as having read: &lt;blockquote&gt;Brian Cowen, Politician 1960–2008. This portrait, acquired uncommissioned by the National Gallery, celebrates one of the finest politicians produced by Ireland since the foundation of the state. Following a spell at the helm of the Department of Finance during a period of unprecedented prosperity, Brian Cowen inherited the office of Taoiseach in 2008. Balancing a public image that ranges from fantastically intelligent analytical thinker to Big Ignorant Fucker from Offaly, the Taoiseach proves to be a challenging subject to represent.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The National Gallery called gardaí after it discovered the unauthorised painting. It has claimed that it had been hanging in public view for no more than twenty minutes before it was removed,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|title=Cowen artist 'could be charged'|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230238/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7964096.stm|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradicting the ''[[Sunday Tribune]]'''s claim that it hung for over an hour.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;

The following day, 8 March, Casby hung a second painting of Cowen in the [[Royal Hibernian Academy]] (RHA). A woman attempted to buy the RHA portrait before it was removed.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken |last=Foxe |url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |title=A stunt, a story, a nut and a hammer |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |date=29 March 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090331022003/http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/mar/29/a-stunt-a-story-a-nut-and-a-hammer/ |archivedate=31 March 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media reports==
''Sunday Tribune'' reporter Ken Foxe was contacted by a source at the National Gallery on 9 March and was the first to break the story of Cowen's portraits. Subsequently, "Topsy Campbell" (a pseudonym for Casby) sent [[camera phone]] photographs of the paintings on display.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; The incidents were first reported in the ''Tribune'' of 22 March.&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Foxe|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|title=Cowen hung out to dry in National Gallery hijack|newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327191317/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/22/cowen-hung-out-to-dry-in-national-gallery-hijack/#image_1|archivedate=27 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RTÉ===
On 23 March, [[state broadcaster]] [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] ran a report on the hangings at the end of the ''[[RTÉ News: Nine O'Clock|Nine O'Clock News]]''. The report by Tadhg Enright displayed the paintings, obtained an appraisal (of zero) from an art expert, and mentioned that Cowen was "not thought to have posed for the anonymous artist".&lt;ref name=before_complaint&gt;{{cite news|first=Ronan|last=McGreevy|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0326/1224243451815.html|title=Cowen not consulted before complaint to RTÉ|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=1 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report was not used on subsequent newscasts. On 24 March, the Nine O'Clock News included an apology "for any personal offence caused to Mr Cowen or his family or for any disrespect shown to the office of Taoiseach by [the prior] broadcast."&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2009/0325/breaking38.htm|title=Gardaí visit radio station in Cowen painting inquiry|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230609/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/garda%C3%AD-visit-radio-station-in-cowen-painting-inquiry-1.838054|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original item was removed from the online archives at [[RTÉ.ie]], and the apology added.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

===Today FM===
On 24 March, ''[[The Ray D'Arcy Show]]'' on commercial radio station [[Today FM]], covered the story. Producer [[Will Hanafin]] revealed that a friend of the artist had e-mailed photographs of a similarly styled painting to him in January, a caricature of the Taoiseach urinating in a full frontal nude pose. This painting has not been displayed publicly.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; A Garda detective visited the station requesting the emails.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; The Garda was said to have been "sheepish and apologetic" about the visit but indicated that he had received an order from "on high" to initiate an investigation.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt; Hanafin refused to comply with the Garda request and, being told that a [[search warrant]] would be sought,&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; labelled the entire affair as "crazy".&lt;ref name=producer_reaction&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.examiner.ie/ireland/idqlqleysn/|title=Today FM producer brands reaction 'crazy'|newspaper=[[Irish Examiner]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302224032/http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/idqlqleysn/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abroad===
The incident was covered by foreign newspapers, including ''[[The Times]]'' of London.&lt;ref name=exposed_to_ridicule&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Sharrock|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5971027.ece|title=Brian Cowen is exposed to ridicule by art gallery guerrilla|newspaper=[[The Times]]|location=London|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also covered in [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

===Online===
Blogs and [[social network service]]s such as Twitter were reported to be popular outlets for members of the general public to express their dissatisfaction at the attempted censorship and apology of RTÉ.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; A YouTube video of the original RTÉ news report had received more than three thousand views within twenty-four hours.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; The affair was nicknamed "Picturegate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|title=Irish internet in uproar over Picturegate censorship|work=Silicon Republic|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230815/http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/article/12591/digital-life/picturegate-has-web-in-uproar|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Cowengate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|title=Cowengate and Freedom of Expression|work=cearta.ie|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=26 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302230929/http://www.cearta.ie/2009/03/cowengate-and-freedom-of-expression/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in online discussions.

==Garda investigation==
The Garda investigation was said to have taken six hours. The possible crimes were offending [[decency]], [[Hate speech#Ireland|incitement to hatred]], and [[criminal damage]] for nailing the painting to the wall&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; (though it has also been reported that paintings were hung without the use of nails)&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/artdesign/story/2009/03/27/cowen-nudes.html?ref=rss|title=Artist behind naughty nudes of Irish PM emerges|work=CBC News|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigators telephoned Casby and he entered Pearse Street Garda Station where he was interviewed for two hours, admitted to having hung the two paintings and was subsequently released.&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0325/cowenb.html|title=Teacher questioned over Cowen paintings|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=25 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave gardaí five more portraits of other politicians, including [[Michael McDowell (politician)|Michael McDowell]].&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;&lt;ref name=stunt_story_nut_hammer/&gt; A file was prepared for the [[Director of public prosecutions#Ireland|director of public prosecutions]], but it is expected that no charges will be brought.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt; Casby expressed his desire to "draw an end" to the matter by auctioning the paintings for charity.&lt;ref name=could_be_charged/&gt;

==Political reaction==
The incidents attracted comment from politicians.

The RTÉ News report was criticised as being in bad taste by [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Seanad Éireann|Senators]] [[Maria Corrigan]] and [[Mary O'Rourke]] and [[Teachta Dála|TDs]] [[M. J. Nolan]] and [[Michael Kennedy (Dublin politician)|Michael Kennedy]]. [[Fine Gael]] TD [[Michael W. D'Arcy]] called it the "most distasteful report I have seen on RTÉ in years".&lt;ref name=before_complaint/&gt; Kennedy urged consideration for the feelings of Cowen's wife and children, and called on [[Director-General of RTÉ]] [[Cathal Goan]] to resign, but did not advocate charging the artist.&lt;ref name=producer_reaction/&gt;

Some suggested the government had put pressure on RTÉ to withdraw the report and apologise, or on Today FM to co-operate with the Garda. The station received several complaints that the report was in bad taste, including one from the government press secretary, Eoghan Ó Neachtain, who claimed he was acting on his own initiative.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt; [[Fine Gael]]'s [[Enda Kenny]]&lt;ref name="Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture"&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=O'Regan|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0327/1224243552769.html|title=Ceann Comhairle exasperated as Kenny fails to see the bigger picture|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|date=27 March 2009|accessdate=27 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231103/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/oireachtas/ceann-comhairle-exasperated-as-kenny-fails-to-see-the-bigger-picture-1.731374|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Charles Flanagan]] called it a restriction on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].&lt;ref name=teacher_questioned/&gt;&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/cowenb.html|title=Opposition slams Govt over portrait pressure|publisher=[[RTÉ News]]|date=26 March 2009|accessdate=28 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302231227/http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0326/115596-cowenb/|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liz McManus]] of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] criticised RTÉ for "bow[ing] to political pressure".&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; RTÉ claimed the decision to withdraw the report was taken by RTÉ executives, and that Ó Neachtain's complaint was received after the late-night ''[[RTÉ News on Two|News on Two]]'' had already been broadcast without the report.&lt;ref name=radio_station_inquiry/&gt;

Some criticised the Garda investigation as a waste of resources. Fine Gael's [[Frances Fitzgerald (Irish politician)|Frances FitzGerald]] said it was "over the top"; [[Rónán Mullen]] defended it as appropriate.&lt;ref name=opposition_pressure/&gt; Labour's [[Joan Burton]] said "While I sympathise with the Taoiseach and his family, the public has noticed that it took gardaí six months to [[Anglo Irish Bank hidden loans controversy|go into the Anglo Irish Bank]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |title='It took Gardaí six months to go into Anglo Irish': reaction to cowengate |date=29 March 2009 |newspaper=[[Sunday Tribune]] |accessdate=1 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402180945/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2009/mar/29/it-took-gardai-six-months-to-go-into-anglo-irish-r/ |archivedate= 2 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Circleville Pumpkin Show''' is an annual [[festival]] held in [[Circleville, Ohio|Circleville]], [[Ohio]], about {{convert|30|mi}} south of the state capital of [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. The festival, which is held to celebrate local agriculture, is headed up by the Circleville Pumpkin Show Corporation. Considered to be the biggest festival in the United States dedicated to the [[pumpkin]], it is billed as '''''The Greatest Free Show On Earth'''''. Attendance has topped 400,000 for the four-day event, which is free to enter.&lt;ref name="Pumpkin Show Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Circleville Pumpkin Show Fact Sheet|url=http://www.pumpkinshow.com/pdf/factsheet.pdf|website=Pumpkin Show|publisher=The Circleville Pumpkin Show|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dates==
The Pumpkin Show begins on the third Wednesday of October and lasts until the following Saturday. In recent years, a Tuesday preview night "for locals" has been introduced, adding an unofficial half day to the event.

==Locations==
Starting on the Sunday before the festival, work begins to restrict traffic in [[Circleville Historic District|downtown Circleville]]. The restricted areas dedicated to the show are from South Scioto Street on the west to Pickaway Street on the east, and Watt/Pinckney Street on the north to Franklin Street on the south. More than 12 blocks are restricted by this event, which causes massive detours throughout a major portion of the city, including [[Ohio State Route 56|State Route 56]] and [[U.S. Route 22]]. Because there is no organized parking system, many small businesses, individuals, and non-profit organizations provide parking for varying fees.

==History==
In October 1903, Mayor George R. Haswell decided to hold a small pumpkin-and-corn exhibit in front of his store to celebrate the local harvest. This small exhibit featured corn, carved pumpkins and other harvest-themed displays. Because of the prominence of pumpkins in this first exhibit, the name "The Pumpkin Show" was then coined. In the following years local merchants were attracted to improve the size, scope and attendance of the festival. By 1905, the first ride was installed. Soon after, with the success of the shows, an annual festival was organized to be held on the city streets to attract merchants, patrons and improve the quality of the festival.&lt;ref name="Circleville Pumpkin Show History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of the Pumpkin Show|url=http://www.pumpkinshow.com/history/|website=The Circleville Pumpkin Show|publisher=The Circleville Pumpkin Show, Inc.|accessdate=30 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pumpkin Show has been held annually since 1903. Despite it still being held during the [[Influenza pandemic|influenza outbreaks]] of 1918-1919, The Pumpkin Show was silenced for one year during [[World War I]] and two years during [[World War II]]. Aside from this three-year gap, there have been no other recorded occurrences of the Circleville Pumpkin Show being canceled or postponed.

The Pumpkin Show became the sixth largest festival in the United States by 2007, attracting more than 300,000 people to the city every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Circleville_Pumpkin_Show|title=Circleville Pumpkin Show - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditions==
Every Pumpkin Show officially kicks off with the weigh-in of large pumpkins from around the area. The largest pumpkin to date was grown by Bob &amp; Jo Liggett, with their entry from 2014 weighing in at {{convert|1964|lb}}. Recent weigh-ins have had multiple entries that go over {{convert|1000|lb}}.

Every year, Lindsey's Bakery creates the "world's largest" [[pumpkin pie]]. Visitors can be in line for over an hour to see the pie. At the 100th anniversary Pumpkin Show in 2006, the bakery had to make a much bigger pie compared to previous years to officially reclaim the title of world's largest. The pie pan was so large that it was moved outside of the bakery window and into a tent out on the street.

Another long-standing tradition of the Circleville Pumpkin Show is a [[Beauty pageant|pageant]] to crown the Little Miss and [[Pumpkin queen|Miss Pumpkin Show Queen]]. The Little Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be in the 1st grade at a school in [[Pickaway County, Ohio|Pickaway County]], while the Miss Pumpkin Show Queen must be a junior or senior from one of the six local high schools. Once crowned, they lead off each parade for the rest of the event.

Seven parades in total are held during the event (two on Wednesday-Friday, one night parade on Saturday). These parades have many different themes, including the Pet Parade and Baby Parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pumpkinshow.com/parades.asp|title=The Circleville Pumpkin Show - Parades|website=www.pumpkinshow.com|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These parades also feature performances by many local high school and middle school bands, as well as other organizations. [[The Ohio University Marching 110]], which is often referred to as "The Most Exciting Band In The Land," has made numerous trips to highlight Thursday night's parade of bands. The 2006 Pumpkin Show welcomed [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]]. They came back in 2010 to march in the parade of bands again and hold a concert afterwards.

== Facts ==
The Pumpkin Show features several different pumpkin related foods, including pumpkin donuts, pancakes, burgers, ice cream, cookies, fudge, brownies, cream puffs, waffles, pumpkin seeds, and pumpkin pie. Over the course of the event, approximately 23,000 pumpkin pies and more than 100,000 pumpkin donuts are sold from local vendors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Circleville_Pumpkin_Show|title=Circleville Pumpkin Show - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also many other festival foods available at various stands throughout the event.

Due to its popularity, the Pumpkin Show also has a song, "The Punkin Show," written and composed by M. W. "Burk" Burkhart in 1952 (published in 1977).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/74329111/|title=The Circleville Herald from Circleville, Ohio on October 18, 1977 &amp;middot; Page 15|newspaper=Newspapers.com|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People from over 34 states and 13 different countries have been documented to have attended the festival in the most recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Circleville_Pumpkin_Show|title=Circleville Pumpkin Show - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|access-date=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collector Car Appreciation Day (CCAD)''' is an annual celebration to raise awareness of the role [[automotive restoration]] and collection plays in American society. The day was first recognized on July 9, 2010 due, in part, to [[U.S. Senate]] resolution S. Res 513, sponsored by Senators [[Jon Tester]] (D-MT) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.semasan.com/main/main.aspx?id=62850 |title=Sema Action Network |publisher=Sema San |date= |accessdate=2011-06-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530171411/http://www.semasan.com/main/main.aspx?id=62850# |archive-date=2011-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hundreds of events were staged nationwide to celebrate the first CCAD. Thousands attended events ranging from car cruises and shows to small-business open houses and “drive your car to work” displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sema.org/news/2010/07/15/hobbyists-come-out-in-force-to-celebrate-inaugural-collector-car-appreciation-day |title=Hobbyists Come Out in Force to Celebrate Inaugural "Collector Car Appreciation Day" &amp;#124; Specialty Equipment Market Association |publisher=Sema.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effort was organized by the [[Specialty Equipment Market Association]] (SEMA) and its Automotive Restoration Market Organization (ARMO) and Hot Rod Industry Alliance (HRIA) Councils, acknowledged the importance of the automobile in American culture as the inspiration for much music, literature, photography, cinema, fashion and other artistic pursuits.

The '''Harmonic Convergence''' is the name given to one of the world's first globally synchronized meditation events, which occurred on August 16–17, 1987. This event also closely coincided with an exceptional alignment of planets in the [[Solar System]].

Although the event had been predicted by author [[Tony Shearer]] in his book ''Lord of the Dawn'' (1971), the principal organizer of the Harmonic Convergence event was [[José Argüelles]].

According to Shearer's interpretation of Aztec cosmology, the selected date marked the end of twenty-two cycles of 52 years each, or 1,144 years in all. The twenty-two cycles were divided into thirteen "[[heaven]]" cycles, which began in AD 843 and ended in 1519, when the nine "[[hell]]" cycles began, ending 468 years later in 1987. The very beginning of the nine "[[hell]]" cycles was precisely the day that [[Hernán Cortés]] landed in Mexico, April 22, 1519 (coinciding with "1 Reed" on the Aztec/Mayan calendar, the day sacred to Mesoamerican cultural hero Quetzalcoatl). The 9 hell cycles of 52 years each ended precisely on August 16–17, 1987.  Shearer introduced the dates and the prophecy to Arguelles in 1970, and he eventually co-opted them and created the name Harmonic Convergence as the public title of the event.

The timing of the Harmonic Convergence was allegedly significant in the [[Maya calendar]], with some consideration also given to European and Asian astrological traditions. The chosen dates have the distinction of allegedly marking a planetary alignment with the Sun, Moon and six out of eight planets being "part of the [[grand trine]]."  Though Arguelles eventually connected the timing of the Harmonic Convergence with his understanding of the significance of Maya calendrics, the dates themselves were derived not from Maya cosmology but from [[Tony Shearer]]'s reconstructed [[Aztec]] prophecies.

==Astrological alignment==
According to the astrologer Neil Michelsen's "The American Ephemeris," on 24 August 1987 there was an exceptional alignment of planets in the Solar System. Eight planets were aligned in an unusual configuration called a [[grand trine]].{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs mathematical verification.|date=May 2018}}

The Sun, Moon and six out of eight planets formed part of the grand trine, that is, they were aligned at the apexes of an [[equilateral triangle]] when viewed from the Earth.

The Sun, Moon, Mars and Venus were in exact alignment, astrologically called a [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] at the first degree of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] in [[Tropical Astrology]]. Mercury was in the  fourth degree of Virgo which most astrologers count as part of the same conjunction being within the "orb" of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73840709.html?dids=73840709:73840709&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+22%2C+1987&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Harmonic+Convergence%3A+Why+Report+It+With+Such+Disrespect%3F&amp;pqatl=google|title=Harmonic Convergence: Why Report It With Such Disrespect?|date=Aug 22, 1987|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter was in Aries, and Saturn and Uranus in Sagittarius completing the grand trine.  However some believe that this is an Earth grand trine with Sun/Moon/Mars/Venus/Mercury in the initial degrees of Virgo, Neptune at 5 degrees of Capricorn, and Jupiter in the last degree of Aries ([[anaretic degree]]), on the cusp of Taurus. Uranus, and especially Saturn are on the edge of this trine.

Controversy is associated to the claim that this occurrence was a unique event.  Grand trines, where planets are at 120 degree positions forming an equilateral triangle are not uncommon or particularly noteworthy.  Traditional astrology does not consider trines to be action points, so the notion of a special shift in world history would not be in the offing under a grand trine.  Hence, many traditional astrologers do not regard this occurrence to be of significant importance.  There is no evidence that astronomers have ever considered it significant.

== Astrological interpretations ==

The convergence is purported to have "corresponded with a great shift in the earth’s energy from warlike to peaceful."&lt;ref name="nyttravel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/29/travel/29spirituality.html|title=Touring the Spirit World|last=Todras-Whitehill|first=Ethan|date=April 29, 2007|publisher=New York Times|pages=3|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Believers of this esoteric prophecy maintain that the Harmonic Convergence ushered in a five-year period of Earth's "cleansing", where many of the planet's "false structures of separation" would collapse.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

According to Argüelles, the event came at the end of these "hell" cycles and the beginning of a new age of universal peace. Adherents believed that signs indicated a "major energy shift" was about to occur, a turning point in [[Earth]]'s collective [[karma]] and [[dharma]], and that this energy was powerful enough to change the global perspective of man from one of conflict to one of [[co-operation]]. Actress and author [[Shirley MacLaine]] called it a "window of light,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anderson|first=Lisa|title=Getting Cosmic With Shirley|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-08-19/entertainment/8703030024_1_shirley-maclaine-new-age-seminars/3|accessdate=15 February 2013|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=August 19, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;  allowing access to higher realms of awareness.

According to Argüelles, the Harmonic Convergence also began the final 25-year countdown to the end of the [[Mayan Long Count]] in [[2012 millenarianism|2012]], which would be the so-called end of history and the beginning of a new 5,125-year cycle. Evils of the modern world, e.g. war, materialism, violence, abuses, injustice, oppression, etc. would end with the birth of the 6th Sun and the 5th Earth on [[December 21, 2012]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

== Power centers ==

An important part of the Harmonic Convergence observances was the idea of congregating at "power centers."&lt;ref name = field&gt;{{cite news | url =  https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=19870815&amp;id=8V8eAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5771,2464174 | title = 144,000 Needed to Establish Field of Trust |date = Aug 15, 1987 | publisher = Times Daily  | accessdate = 2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Power centers were places, such as [[Mount Shasta]], California,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Harmonic Convergence  | publisher = [[College of the Siskiyous]]  | date = 1989  | url = http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/har/index.htm  | accessdate = 2010-03-31  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100527184532/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/fol/har/index.htm  | archivedate = 2010-05-27  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mount Fuji]],&lt;ref name = APStory&gt;{{cite news | url =  https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19870815&amp;id=YiAyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ouUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3744,141928 | title = Convergers Seek harmony |date = Aug 15, 1987 | publisher = Reading Eagle (from Associated Press and United Press Intl.) | accessdate = 2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mount Yamnuska]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightningpath.net/page106/page49/page76/page2/page2.html&lt;/ref&gt; where the spiritual energy was held to be particularly strong.  The belief was that if [[144,000]] people assembled at these power centers and meditated for peace, that the arrival of the new era would be facilitated.&lt;ref name = field/&gt;

The '''Houston Dragon Boat Festival''' is held in [[Houston, Texas]]. The Houston Dragon Boat Festival is a race down [[Buffalo Bayou]], using decorated canoes called "[[dragon boat]]s".

==History==
The first festival was held in October 2001 at [[Allen's Landing]] in downtown Houston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nancy |last=Sarnoff |title=Beware of floating dragons on the bayou |url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2001/10/15/tidbits.html?page=2 |work=Houston Business Journal |date=2001-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the festival added a second event – the Gulf Coast International Dragon Boat Regatta held in October at Clear Lake Park. 2005 saw the festival host the U.S. Central Region Championships in conjunction with the Gulf Coast International regatta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A Year of Corporate Philanthropy: October 2005 |url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2005/11/14/focus20.html|work=Houston Business Journal |date=2005-11-11 |quote=Wal-Mart was presenting sponsor of the second annual Gulf Coast International Dragon Boat Regatta at Clear Lake Park, which helps increase awareness of Asian and Asian-American culture. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Boathouse ==
The Texas Dragon Association plans to build the first [[boathouse]] along the downtown Bayou for non-motor boat craft. The Houston Endowment donated $75,000 to build the boathouse at 501 N. York Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buffalo Bayou to get boathouse |url=http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2007/01/15/daily15.html |work=Houston Business Journal |date=2007-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''ICCA Congress''' is the annual meeting of the [[International Congress and Convention Association]] (ICCA), an organization of the main specialists in handling, transporting and accommodating international events.

It has been held every year since 1963 as a [[Popular assembly|General Assembly]] for ICCA members. As a meeting for members only, has been traditionally held in October/November and has rotated throughout the world. It has lasted approximately 4 days and consisted of category meetings combined with education sessions.

In 1997, the format was changed to combine the General Assembly with a Congress that would be open to all professionals in the meetings industry including non-ICCA members. At the same time an exhibition was held with both member and non-member exhibitors. As of 2010 the exhibition no longer takes place.

The event attracts approximately 600-1000 delegates and 40-100 accompanying persons, depending on the destination. The current format of the event is half a day for the First Time Attendees (Sunday morning), half day for the General Assembly (Sunday) and three days for the [[Congress]] (Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday am). Because the General Assembly and Congress is the key focal point of [[International Congress and Convention Association|ICCA]]’s annual activity, the responsibility to deliver a well-organised and managed event of a top-quality standard is an exciting challenge to a destination. A high standard in all aspects of meetings management is expected - programming, [[marketing]], [[theming]], social activities, [[logistical]] arrangements, etc.

'''Indalpine''' ([[International Nonproprietary Name|INN]], [[British Approved Name|BAN]]; brand name '''Upstène'''; developmental code name '''LM-5008''') is a [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SSRI) class drug that was briefly marketed.&lt;ref name="Elks2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. Elks|title=The Dictionary of Drugs: Chemical Data: Chemical Data, Structures and Bibliographies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0vXTBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA988|date=14 November 2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4757-2085-3|pages=988–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was discovered in 1977 by the pharmacologists Le Fur and Uzan at Pharmuka, a small French pharmaceutical firm, who credit Baron Shopsin and his colleagues at NYU-Bellevue/NYU School of Medicine in New York with providing the basis for their work.  They were particularly influenced by the series of "synthesis inhibitor studies" carried out by Shopsin's team during the early to mid 1970s, and in particular, the clinical report by Shopsin et al. (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 133650 | year = 1976 | last1 = Shopsin | first1 = B | last2 = Friedman | first2 = E | last3 = Gershon | first3 = S | title = Parachlorophenylalanine reversal of tranylcypromine effects in depressed patients | volume = 33 | issue = 7 | pages = 811–9 | journal = Archives of General Psychiatry | doi=10.1001/archpsyc.1976.01770070041003}}&lt;/ref&gt; relating to [[fenclonine|PCPA]]'s rapid reversal of antidepressant response to [[tranylcypromine]] in [[depression (mood)|depressed]] patients. This led to an understanding of the role of the [[monoamine neurotransmitter]] [[serotonin]] (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5HT) in the therapeutic effects of the available [[tricyclic antidepressant|tricyclic]] and [[MAOI]] class antidepressants. The studies led to widespread recognition of a serotonin hypothesis of depression, contradicting theories that promoted the role of [[norepinephrine]].

==History==
&lt;!--'''Indalpine: the first worldwide marketed SSRI and Designated Blockbuster''': --&gt;
While [[citalopram]] and [[zimelidine]] were developed in the early 1970s, it was Pharmuka's indalpine that was first to reach the market. Baron Shopsin was recruited as consultant to Pharmuka throughout a research and development process that resulted in the marketing of indalpine in France and then worldwide, in 1982. With FDA approval of Pharmuka's IND submission to conduct clinical studies with indalpine and viqueline, Shopsin carried out and published the first clinical trials with these drugs in depressed outpatients in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Shopsin1983&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shopsin B, Lefebvre C, Maulet C | title = Indalpine (LM-5008): An open study in depressed outpatients | journal = Current Therapeutic Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | pages = 239–252 | year = 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Astra's SSRI zimelidine was marketed within a year (1983), but the next crop of SSRIs didn't become commercially available until the 1986 marketing of [[fluvoxamine]] in Belgium by Duphar, followed by approval in the United States later that year. Lilly's [[fluoxetine]] (Prozac) was approved in the US in 1987.
&lt;!--'''Indalpine withdrawn and Fluoxetine (Prozac) marketed in 1987'''--&gt;

Meanwhile, zimelidine had been withdrawn soon after its marketing in 1983 due to the emergence of [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]], a serious neurological disease. With lingering concerns among some Common Market countries and activist groups about the potential of SSRIs to induce adverse effects, and the reported association between indalpine and hematological effects, which emerged in the aftermath of Pharmuka's take over by [[Rhône Poulenc]], indalpine was abruptly taken off the market by Rhône Poulenc. Irish psychiatrist David Healy characterized indalpine as being "born at the wrong time" during a period when "indalpine and psychiatry was under siege" by different interest groups in some of the Common Market countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Healy|first1=David|title=Let them eat Prozac : the unhealthy relationship between the pharmaceutical industry and depression|date=2004|publisher=New York University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780814736975|pages=20-22|chapter=Indalpine and psychiatry under siege}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with indalpine's fate, research and development was halted relating to the 2 other 4-alkyl-piperidine derivatives developed by Pharmuka, [[viqualine]] (a [[serotonin releasing agent]]) and [[pipequaline]] (a [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]] [[positive allosteric modulator]]), both in different stages of development at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ahmed|first1=Aejaz|last2=Molvi|first2=K.

The '''International Front of the Working People of the Latvian SSR''' or '''Interfront''' ({{Lang-lv|Latvijas PSR Internacionālā Darbaļaužu fronte, Interfronte}}, {{Lang-ru|Интернациональный фронт трудящихся Латвийской ССР, Интерфронт}}) was a pro-Soviet socialist organization in the [[Latvian SSR]], which during the years 1989–1991, supported [[Latvia]] remaining part of the [[USSR]].

Interfront was founded in January 1989 as a reaction to the creation of the pro-independence [[Popular Front of Latvia]]. In 1989 it took part in forming the ''United Front of Workers of the USSR'' (Объединенный фронт трудящихся СССР).

The Interfront central leadership published a newspaper ''Edinstvo'' ({{lang-ru|Единство}}, 'Unity'). Local sections of the organisation, for example in [[Liepāja]], published their own information bulletins. Interfront also made radio broadcasts.

Among the leaders of Interfront were Igor Lopatin, Anatoly Alekseyev, and [[Tatjana Ždanoka]].

Interfront was particularly active during the [[January 1991 events in Latvia]], during which several civilians and law enforcement officers were killed in clashes with [[OMON]] units loyal to the central government in Moscow.

In September 1991, following the failed [[August Coup]] attempt and the restoration of Latvian independence from the USSR, the transitional parliament, the [[Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia|Supreme Council]] passed a decree [[proscription|proscribing]] the Interfront, along with the [[Communist Party of Latvia]] and some other pro-soviet organizations.

As a result of this ban, those known to have been members in Interfront after 13 January 1991 have faced restrictions on [[naturalization]] as citizens of Latvia. Former Interfront activists who hold citizenship of Latvia have been barred from standing as candidates for election to the [[Saeima]] (parliament) or municipal councils.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51760">This is a chronological list of conflicts in which [[peasant]]s played a significant role.

==Background==
History of peasant wars spans over a period of over two thousand years. A variety of reasons fueled the emergence of the peasant revolt phenomenon, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/03066157508437962|title=The Late  Medieval Peasant Wars|author=Frantisek Graus|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=22 October 2014|doi=10.1080/03066157508437962|volume=3|journal=The Journal of Peasant Studies|pages=1–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Tax resistance]] 
*[[Social inequality]] 
*[[Religious war]] 
*[[Wars of national liberation|National liberation]] 
*Resistance against [[serfdom]] 
*Redistribution of land
*External factors such as [[Black Death|plague]] and [[Great Famine of 1315-1317|famine]]

Later peasant revolts such as the [[Telangana Rebellion]] were also influenced by [[Agrarian socialism|agrarian socialist]] [[Maoism|ideologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/courses/2007fall/geog/804/001/Skocpol%201979%20What%20Makes%20Peasant%20Revolutionary.pdf|title=Review: What Makes Peasants Revolutionary?|author=Theda Skocpol|date=April 1982|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of peasant rebellions ended prematurely and were unsuccessful. Peasants suffered from limited funding and lacked the training and organisational capabilities of professional armies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmarkshistorien.dk/leksikon-og-kilder/vis/materiale/bondeoproer/?tx_historyview_pi1[lang]=1&amp;cHash=f8911ce32f21435e54b5720e3e9db0f7|title=Peasant Rebellions|work=Danmarkshistorien-Aarhus University|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3957">'''Martin Šmíd''' was a fictitious [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] university student, who was supposedly killed in the police attack on the November 17, 1989 student demonstration in Prague that launched Czechoslovakia's [[Velvet Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"&gt;Dan Bilefsky, [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/world/europe/18czech.html "Velvet Revolution’s Roots Obscure 20 Years Later,"] ''New York Times,'' 17 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The rumour of Šmíd's death was spread by Drahomíra Dražská, a porter at a student dormitory in the city's Troja district. The dissident [[Charter 77]] activist Petr Uhl believed her story and passed it along to [[Radio Free Europe]], the [[BBC]] and [[Voice of America]], who broadcast it.&lt;ref name=Fall&gt;Sebestyen (2010), ''Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire'', p. 370-371&lt;/ref&gt; The news of a student's death shocked many, and the rumour is thought to have contributed to the fall of the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia.

The Martin Šmíd in question was allegedly a student of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at [[Charles University]]. Two students with that name attended the school at the time, both in their second year at the university, but nothing happened to either of them on November 17. One did not attend the student demonstration, and the other left it just before the police attack. After the story spread across the country, the public reaction was one of outrage. The government showed the two Martin Šmíds and interviewed one of them on television, but people did not believe their assertion that the story was fictitious. Massive demonstrations began across the weekend and the government responded by arresting Uhl for "spreading false rumours".&lt;ref name=Fall/&gt;

Drahomíra Dražská's actions, and her motivation for them, have never been fully made clear. The most likely explanation is that she invented the story of Šmíd's death,&lt;ref name="dezinformace"&gt;Závěrečná zpráva vyšetřovací komise Federálního shromáždění pro objasnění událostí 17. listopadu 1989, část III. 5) - Desinformace o údajném úmrtí studenta Šmída, [cit. 2009-10-21].  [http://www.psp.cz/eknih/1990fs/tisky/t1236_06.htm Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; and Dražská herself has on several occasions reaffirmed this claim.&lt;ref name="drazska"&gt;Drahomíra Dražská: Strůjkyně zprávy o mrtvém Šmídovi promluvila. [http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/72859-drahomira-drazska-strujkyne-zpravy-o-mrtvem-smidovi-promluvila/ Available online.]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Velvet Revolution]], a [[conspiracy theory]] began to spread that the incident had been a secret police operation. According to journalist Victor Sebestyen, the StB "faked the 'death' of Martin Šmíd in order to create a groundswell of popular anger that would remove General Secretary [[Miloš Jakeš|Jakeš]] and other hardliners, and replace them with [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]]-type reformers."&lt;ref name=Fall/&gt; Sebestyen maintained that Ludvík Zifčák, a junior StB agent who had infiltrated the student movement, fell down and played dead during the November 17 demonstrations in [[Wenceslas Square]] and that Dražská, whom Sebestyen also believed to be an StB agent, then passed on to Uhl the story that "Šmíd" had been killed.&lt;ref name=Fall/&gt;

However, an investigation by a committee of the Czechoslovak parliament found no evidence of these claims, and Dražská's involvement with the StB was found highly unlikely.&lt;ref name=dezinformace/&gt; Furthermore, following the events of November 17, Zifčák continued his undercover work, casting doubts on his role as Martin Šmíd since the operation would be compromised had he been recognized.&lt;ref name=dezinformace/&gt;

During the entire duration of the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, a large number of teachers, doctors, engineers, poets and writers were systematically massacred by the [[Pakistan Army]] and their local collaborators, most notably the alleged [[Islamism|Islamist]] militia groups [[Al-Badr (East Pakistan)|Al-Badr]] and [[Al-Shams (Bangladesh)|Al-Shams]]. The largest number of assassinations took place on 14 December 1971, only two days before the surrender of the Pakistan Army to the joint forces of the [[Indian army]] and [[Mukti bahini]].
[[File:Intelectual Martyrs Memorial, Mirpur.jpg|right|thumb|Foundation plaque of the memorial, Mirpur, Dhaka.]]

On the night of 14 December 1971, over 200 of East Pakistan's intellectuals including professors, journalists, doctors, artists, engineers, and writers were rounded up in Dhaka. They were taken blindfolded to torture cells in Mirpur, Mohammadpur, Nakhalpara, Rajarbagh and other locations in different sections of the city. They were later executed en masse, most notably at Rayerbazar and Mirpur. In memory of the martyred intellectuals, 14 December is mourned in Bangladesh as ''Shaheed Buddhijibi Dibosh'' ("Day of the Martyred Intellectuals").

Even after the official ending of the war on 16 December, there were reports of hostile fire from the armed Pakistani soldiers and their collaborators. In one such incident, filmmaker [[Zahir Raihan]] was killed on 30 January 1972 in Mirpur, allegedly by the armed Beharis of Mirpur.

The number of intellectuals killed is estimated as: educationist 991, journalist 13, doctor 49, lawyer 42, others (litterateur, artist and engineer) 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Muazzam Hussain |year=2012 |chapter=Killing of Intellectuals |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Killing_of_Intellectuals |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intellectuals who were killed between 25 March and 16 December 1971 in different parts of the country included [[Govinda Chandra Dev]] (Philosopher, Professor at DU), [[Munier Chowdhury]] (Litterateur, dramatist, Professor at DU), [[Mufazzal Haider Chaudhury]] (Litterateur, Professor at DU), [[Anwar Pasha]] (Litterateur, Professor at DU), [[Mohammed Fazle Rabbee]] (cardiologist), Alim Chowdhury (ophthalmologist), [[Shahidullah Kaisar]] (journalist), Nizamuddin Ahmed (Reporter), [[Selina Parvin]] (reporter), [[Altaf Mahmud]] (lyricist and musician), Hobibur Rahman (Professor of Mathematics, RU), Sukhranjan Somaddar (Professor of Sanskrit, RU), Mir Abdul Quaiyum (Professor of Psychology, RU), [[Dhirendranath Datta]] (politician), [[Ranadaprasad Saha]] (philanthropist), Lt.

Moazzem Hossain (ex-soldier), Mamun Mahmood (Police Officer), and many others.&lt;ref name=shahiduzzman&gt;[http://www.newagebd.com/2005/dec/15/murdered/murdered.html No count of the nation’s intellectual loss] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201162513/http://www.newagebd.com/2005/dec/15/murdered/murdered.html |date=1 December 2010 }}", ''The New Age''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and Construction of the Memorial==
In 1993, the Government of Bangladesh decided to erect a memorial at the site. The Ministry of Housing and Works Department and the Institute of Architects Bangladesh jointly organised a national level architectural competition for the design of the memorial "Badhya Bhumi Smriti Soudha".  Out of 22 entries the jurors selected the design proposal of Architect Farid Uddin Ahmed and Architect Md Jami-al-Shafi. Public Works Department was responsible for the implementation of the project and its completion took about three years (1996 to 1999).

==Design Significance of Martyred Intellectual Memorial==
The main element of the monument is approxiamtley 17.7 m high, 0.9 m thick and 115.8 m long curved brick wall, representing the original brickfield of Rayer Bazar where the dead bodies were found. The wall is broken at the two ends, representing grief and sorrow. A square window at the south-west side of the wall permits visitor's view to reach the sky behind, that also scale down the wall. In front of the curved wall is a still water body from which rises a black granite column, which represents grief.&lt;ref&gt;"Badhya Bhumi Smriti Soudho'" Banglapedia.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Cawood Green''' (born 10 April 1954) is a South African born academic and writer.

As a researcher he is most noted for his monograph, ''Novel Histories'' which explores the uses of history in [[South African fiction]]. He is the author of two works of historical fiction, ''Sinking: A Verse Novella'' about the 1964 [[Blyvooruitzicht]] sinkhole disaster, and ''For the Sake of Silence'' about the [[Trappists]] in South Africa.

Michael Green's fiction forms part of a 'new wave' of writing (see also [[Zakes Mda]], [[Ivan Vladislavic]], [[J. M. Coetzee]]) which explores the altered landscape of [[Post-apartheid South Africa]]. His work, as noted critic Leon de Kock puts it, "...speaks to the muteness of history, ... that ruptures the silence of time past, and further, ...talks so very eloquently about those who would not speak at all..."[https://web.archive.org/web/20110714083149/http://michaelcawoodgreen.com/index_files/Page967.htm](Review: Leon de Kok, Sunday Times online, 15 June 2008)

Michael Green is currently Professor in English and Creative Writing at [[Northumbria University]].

== ''For The Sake of Silence'' ==
Winner of the 2009 Olive Schreiner Prize [https://archive.is/20130421225355/http://news.book.co.za/blog/2010/04/21/michael-cawood-green-wins-the-olive-schreiner-prize-for-prose-for-for-the-sake-of-silence/]
 
[[J. M. Coetzee]] writes, "Of the Trappist enterprise in nineteenth-century South Africa, with all its passionate personal rivalries and Byzantine internal politics, Michael Cawood Green has made a work of history cum fiction that will grip and sometimes amaze the reader."[https://web.archive.org/web/20110327123758/http://www.quartetbooks.co.uk/bookpages/forthesakeofsilence.html]

The '''Michigan Challenge Balloonfest''' is an annual [[hot air balloon festival]] established in 1984 and held in [[Howell, Michigan]] during the last weekend of June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/balloon-festivals-michigan-11807.html|title=Balloon Festivals in Michigan|author=Maryellen Cicione, Demand Media|work=Travel Tips - USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event draws crowds from all over [[Michigan]] and its surrounding states with attendance usually topping 100,000 over the three-day weekend. The festival is hosted by the [[Howell Area Chamber of Commerce]], and Balloonfest Director Michelle Tokan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howell.org/23.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100118170628/http://www.howell.org/23.html |date=January 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual attractions==
The festival starts each year on Friday afternoon with the opening of the [[carnival]]. Being right on Grand River, the lights make a spectacle for anyone driving through the downtown area every night. Friday night also features a [[fireworks]] display, as of the 2009 festival, sponsored by MediLodge of Howell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofhowell.org/uploaded/files/20090713%20Council%20Packet.pdf|title=Welcome to City of Howell, MI|work=cityofhowell.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Festival held next to the [[Howell High School (Howell, Michigan)|Howell High School]] main campus goes on for the entire weekend as long as the Balloonfest is running and attracts vendors selling anything from crafts to hand-painted artwork. Saturday morning the day starts early with the balloon fly-in. In downtown Howell, the [[Saint Joseph Mercy Hospital]] kids day, held on the lawn of the historical Howell Courthouse, features demonstrations such as karate and dancing. One of the favorite events of the festival is held late on Saturday night each year, the balloon [[night glow]]. After the evening launch, the pilots all come back to the launch field and re-inflate their balloons, then led by a countdown, they all light their torches together and the crowd is treated to all the balloons glowing together on the field.

==Annual launches==
There are several mass balloon launches scheduled each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/index.ssf/2009/06/annual_michigan_challenge_ball.html|title=Annual Michigan Challenge Balloonfest arrives in Howell this weekend|work=MLive.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many years there are some canceled due to inclement weather such as rain or heavy wind. On Friday night the balloons all launch from the Howell High School Freshman Campus main launch field. On Saturday morning, the pilots have to fly back in to the same field and try to drop a marker onto a large target that has been placed where they would normally take off. That evening holds another mass launch followed by the Balloon Glow. Sunday morning holds an early mass launch which many Howell natives enjoy waking up to.

==Sponsors==
The sponsor list changes up every year. The main sponsor for 2010 was [[PNC Financial Services|PNC Bank]]. Other sponsors include [[Waste Management, Inc]], who provide all sanitation services for the weekend, MediLodge of Howell who sponsors the fireworks and hosts the VIP party for pilots and sponsors, [[PepsiCo]] as the beverage sponsor, and Howell Public Schools, [[Tanger Factory Outlet Centers]], and Citizens Insurance are also major contributors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10289">A '''motorcycle rally''' is a gathering of [[motorcycling|motorcycle enthusiasts]].  Rallies can be large or small, and one-time or recurring.  Some rallies are ride-in events, whereas some like the [[Iron Butt Association#Iron Butt Rally|Iron Butt Rally]] involve days of riding and an actual gathering only at the end of the ride.

==North America==
[[File:Street lined with motorcycles at a motorcycle rally in Marietta, Ohio.jpg|thumb|Street lined with motorcycles at a motorcycle rally in [[Marietta, Ohio]].]]
Notable annual [[North America]]n rallies with attendance in the hundreds of thousands from all over the continent include the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]], [[Laconia Motorcycle Week]], [[Black Bike Week]] and [[Daytona Beach Bike Week]].  The [[Republic of Texas Biker Rally]] is held each June in Austin, Texas and attracts over 200,000 bikers to the state capitol. There are innumerable smaller, regional rallies around the United States, including the annual [[BMW MOA]] international rally, the [[Oyster Run]] in the Pacific Northwest, the [[Golden Aspen Rally]] (formerly Aspencade) in the Southwest, the [[Laughlin River Run]] in the West, [[Americade]] in the Northeast, and [[Indianapolis motorcycle Grand Prix#Motorcycles on Meridian|Motorcycles on Meridian]] in the Midwest. A popular rally in the East takes place in the mountains of Maryland, Apple's East Coast Motorcycle Rally (formerly East Coast Sturgis) is best known for its "old school" feel, beautiful mountain riding and even a Motorcycle Demolition Derby.

Rallies will often incorporate entertainment such as a [[Burnout (vehicle)|burnout]] pit, motorcycle contests, bike washes, [[motorcycle stunt riding|motorcycle stunt]] performances like [[wheelie]] acts and the [[wall of death (motorcycle act)|wall of death]], live bands, and [[dice run]]s or [[poker run]]s.  The Indianapolis and Daytona Beach motorcycle rallies have championship motorcycle racing at nearby circuits.  In some cases, rallies are held as benefits for organizations or groups such as the [[American Red Cross]], [[American Cancer Society]], [[American Legion]] or [[VFW]].

==Europe==
The longest established motorcycle rally in Europe is the [[Elephant Rally|''Elefantentreffen'']] (Elephant Rally), established in 1956&lt;ref name=current&gt;{{citation|url=http://current.com/entertainment/comedy/88922655_the-coldest-meeting-elefantentreffen.htm|title=The coldest meeting -- Elefantentreffen|publisher=[[Current TV]]|date=April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; by former Wehrmacht motorcyclists and named in honour of the [[Zündapp]] motorcycle that was nicknamed the "green elephant." The growing reputation of the Elephant Rally led to the creation in 1962 of a British winter rally, the [[Dragon rally]], held each February in North Wales.

One of the largest motorcycle rallies in Europe is the [[Thundersprint]], held annually in May in [[Northwich]], [[Cheshire]], [[England]] and usually has notable motorcycle champions or enthusiasts such as [[Giacomo Agostini]] and [[James May]]. Another large motorcycle rally is [http://glemseck101.de/ Glemseck 101]. It takes place around the Glemseck at the [[Solitude race track]] in [[Leonberg]], [[Germany]] every first weekend in September. A special attraction are the 1/8 mile drag races, where customizers and motorcycle brands send their best bikes and bikers to the race (e.g. [http://www.triumphmotorcycles.at/news-and-events/events/germany/2016/september/glemseck%20101 Triumph], [http://brand.bmw-motorrad.com/en/stories/events/glemseck-101.html BMW], [https://www.yamaha-motor.eu/baltic/products/motorcycles/sport-heritage/yard-built/glemseck/index.aspx Yamaha], [https://news.suzuki.de/essenza-sprint-glemseck-am-3-9-2016-vorstellung-sv650-little-bastard/ Suzuki]).

In the UK, the [[Iron Ore Rally]] is held annually in Egremont Cumbria and the [[Rally of Discovery]] is held in Ireland.  Rallies are held all year round.  Many motorcyclists (or bikers) prefer the winter rallies, such as the Mayflower MCCs [[Force Ten Rally]] or the Dean Vally MCCs [[Rallymans Rally]]. The usual order of the day is camping with a real ale tent and music. Rallies usually start on a Friday afternoon and finish at lunchtime on a Sunday. The point is to travel there by motorcycle, motorcycle and sidecar or trike (not cars or vans), meet friends from all over the country and sometimes further afield, claim a rally badge and enjoy the entertainment. Prizes are awarded for the furthest distance travelled, best bike, best [[rat bike]], oldest person attending, youngest person attending, etc. There are usually planned ride-outs on the Saturday taking in good roads and sometimes historic sites, museums, etc.

In the UK many people relate motorcycle rallies to the famous [[Bulldog Bash]] near Stratford-upon-Avon. This is a hugely popular event and attracts thousands of people including non-motorcyclists. There are many much smaller rallies that attract between 50 and 500 bikers to each event, organised and controlled by a host club. Rallies are still attended by motorcyclists that have been going to rallies for up to 40 or 50 years. In the UK motorcycle rallies began in earnest in the early 1960s as young, mainly working class men and women (usually on the [[pillion]]) gained freedom by motorcycle ownership and set off around the country camping. Some went in groups or clubs and thus the rally was born. Many were [[Ton-up boy]]s, later [[Greaser (subculture)|Greasers]] and then Greebos.

==Gypsy tour==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}

'''Gypsy tour''' is an American motorcycling term which originated before the 1920s; the term has been mostly but not entirely replaced by ''rally'' or ''run''.  Gypsy tours were organized where groups of riders all over the country converged on a favorite destination.  The term ''gypsy'' was used because the riders would travel long distances and often sleeping in tents around a campfire along the way much like the Hollywood stereotype [[Romani people|gypsies]].

One Australian newspaper referring to a Gypsy Tour rally from Melbourne to Sydney in 1927, stated - "The idea of a "gypsy tour" originated in America. There these tours are usually being organised simultaneously in different cities and towns, and routes all converging on one centre, where a great rally is held by the touring parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=December 29, 1927|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The term gypsy tour has been used for other activities, but predominantly motorcycle rallies, and the idea quickly spread around the world.

Many gypsy tours have been held over the years and are still a regular event for many vintage and modern motorcycle groups.
The annual gypsy tour to [[Laconia, New Hampshire]] near [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] began in 1916 and is the oldest continuous motorcycle event in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JFuwEgYzpGUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=gypsy+tour+motorcycle|title=Laconia Motorcycle Week|isbn=978-0-7385-5473-0|author=Charlie St. Clair |author2=Jennifer Anderson|year=2008|publisher=Arcadia Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of rallies are held throughout Australia, at all times of the year.  These range from 'back to basics' rallies, usually held in remote locations with no facilities, to catered rallies held in country towns and other rural locations.  Many rallies are held at a local recreation reserve, football ground, racecourse or showground in country towns.  These venues often have toilet/shower blocks, and bar/kitchen facilities.  Often the motorcycle club organising the rally will arrange for a local service group like the Rotary club, or local sporting club to cater an evening meal and breakfast, and to run the bar.  These events often provide much needed revenue sources for the communities in which the rallies are held, and the communities welcome the rallies to their towns.

Compared to European and American rallies, Australian rallies are often small affairs, with attendance ranging from a few dozen to a few hundred bikes.

The [[Ulysses Club]] Annual General Meeting Event is a weeklong affair that brings in thousands of motorcyclists and millions of dollars to its host site, which can be different each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ulysses Club National AGM|publisher=Tourism Central Australia|url=http://www.discovercentralaustralia.com/index.php/event-s/events-calendar/event/299-ulysses-club-national-agm|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 event in [[Alice Springs]] is expected to draw 5,000 to 7,000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The A'vans are coming|date=October 10, 2011 |newspaper=Alice Spring News |publisher=Media Choice|location=Alice Springs, Australia|url=http://www.alicespringsnews.com.au/2011/10/10/1881/|accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
There are number of rallies held throughout New Zealand, most events taking place over the warmer months. There are a couple of cold weather rallies such as the [[Brass Monkey Motorcycle Rally]].

'''National Science Week''' refers to series of science-related events for the general public which are held in a specific countries during a designated week of the year. The aim of such science weeks is to engage and inspire people of all ages with science, engineering and technology.

==Australia==
[[Australia's]] National Science Week is held annually in August, funded through the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. National Science Week welcomes an audience of over a million and hosts more than 1000 events across the nation. Science Week provides an opportunity for all Australians to participate in events and activities that showcase science and encourages younger people to consider continuing studies in science. Past participants have included polar explorer and environmental scientist [[Tim Jarvis]], NASA Astronaut [[Katherine Megan McArthur]]; environmentalist Tanya Ha; theoretical physicist [[Lawrence Krauss]]; and palaeontologist [[Scott Sampson]]. Another key activity during National Science Week is the National Project, which is run in conjunction with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC Australia]]. Past project have included Weather Detective in 2014 and the Aussie Star Hunt in 2009. Also in 2009 [[Cosmos Magazine]] launched a website called [[HELLO FROM EARTH]] which collected over 28,000 messages which were beamed to the first Earth like planet candidate, [[Gliese 581d]]. In 2016 it included Wikibomb2016, a project to create missing Wikipedia pages on Australian women scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women in STEM Wikibomb|url=http://www.scienceweek.net.au/women-in-stem-wikibomb/|publisher=National Science Week (Australia)|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
In [[India]], Science Week culminates in National Science Day, which takes place each year on 28 February to commemorate [[C. V. Raman]]'s discovery of the [[Raman scattering|Raman Effect]].

==United Kingdom==
[[UK|Britain's]] National Science Week was first held in 1994. It is now known as ''[https://www.britishscienceweek.org/ British Science Week]'' and is one of the largest national celebrations of science. It is organised by the [[British Science Association]] and funded by BEIS (UK Department for Business, Energy, Innovation and Skills) and other partners. British Science Week is a massive UK-wide grassroots celebration of science which saw over 1 million people taking part in over 2,300 events and activities throughout the UK in 2017. 

==United States==
In the [[United States]], the National Science &amp; Technology Week was one of the [[National Science Foundation]]'s main outreach efforts between 1985 and 1999, before the program was succeeded by ''Find Out Why'', a year-long outreach effort focused on families, offering everyday science activities. The idea was revisited in 2005 by the [[U.S. Department of Education]] and the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], in collaboration with other government and scientific partners, with an "Excellence in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education (ESTEME) Week." 

==Other countries==
Other national science weeks include the [[Norway|Norwegian]] Forskningsdagene ("Research Days"), the [[Science Week in Catalonia]], [[Canada]]'s  National Science &amp; Technology Week, Science Week in [[Ireland]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[South Africa]]n National Science Week, and [[China]]'s National Science Week launched in May 2006.

Random Hacks of Kindness grew out of an industry panel discussion&lt;ref name="rhok.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/about/what-is-random-hacks-of-kindness/ |title=What is Random Hacks of Kindness? « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the first [[Crisis camp]] Bar Camp in Washington, DC in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crisiscamp.eventbrite.com/ |title=Crisis Camp - Crisiscamp - Web 2.0- Eventbrite |publisher=Crisiscamp.eventbrite.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panel attendees included Patrick Svenburg&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crisiscampdc.ning.com/profile/svenburg?xg_source=profiles_memberList |title=Patrick Svenburg's Page - CrisisCampDC |publisher=Crisiscampdc.ning.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Microsoft, Phil Dixon&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://crisiscampdc.ning.com/profile/PhilDixon |title=Phil Dixon's Page - CrisisCampDC |publisher=Crisiscampdc.ning.com |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeff Martin&lt;ref&gt;http://crisiscampdc.ning.com/profile/JefferyMartin&lt;/ref&gt; of Google and Jeremy Johnstone&lt;ref&gt;[http://crisiscampdc.ning.com/main/search/search?q=jeremy+johnstone Crisiscampdc.ning.com]&lt;/ref&gt; of Yahoo. They agreed to use their developer communities to create solutions that will affect disaster response, risk reduction and recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGr1IzzrF4I |title=A History of RHoK |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was for a "[[hackathon]]" with developers producing open source solutions. The World Bank's Disaster Risk Reduction Unit (Stuart Gill) and NASA's Open Government team (Robbie Schingler) joined the partnership and these "founding partners" (Microsoft, Yahoo, Google, NASA and the World Bank)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/about |title=What is Random Hacks of Kindness? « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; decided on the name "Random Hacks of Kindness" for their first event.

An innovation incubator in the area of sustainable development, SecondMuse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secondmuse.com secondmuse.com]&lt;/ref&gt; acts as "operational lead" for Random Hacks of Kindness,&lt;ref name="rhok.org"/&gt; coordinating global volunteer efforts, facilitating [[collaborative partnerships]], and managing communications and branding.

===  2009: RHoK 0  ===

The first Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK 0)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/events/rhok-0/ |title=RHoK #0 « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was held at the [[Hacker Dojo]] in Mountain View, California in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author="" |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd0vFbgWV-k&amp;feature=related |title=RHoK at the Hacker Dojo |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-11-13 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergencymgmt.com/disaster/Hackers-Unite-in-the-Name-of-Disaster-Preparedness.html |title=Hackers Unite in the Name of Disaster Preparedness |publisher=Emergencymgmt.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.worldbank.org/insidetheweb/node/519 |title=Random Hacks of Kindness support disaster relief projects &amp;#124; The intersection of the web and the World Bank |publisher=Blogs.worldbank.org |date=2009-11-30 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|FEMA]] Administrator [[Craig Fugate]] gave the keynote&lt;ref name="fema.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fema.gov/news/newsrelease.fema?id=49939|title=FEMA: FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate Keynotes Random Hacks Of Kindness, Disaster Relief Codejam|date=2009-11-13|publisher=Fema.gov|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made a call to action to the developers to apply their creativity to the challenges and featured hacks. The first RHoK event is known as RHoK 0 after 0-based array indexing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xw2k.nist.gov/dads/html/zeroBasedIndexing.html |title=0-based indexing |publisher=Xw2k.nist.gov |date=2006-07-06 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; in computer programming.

* Break Glass

Tweak the Tweet was used during the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti earthquake]] response in January 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/tweak-the-tweet/helping_haiti_tweak_the_twe.html |title=Project EPIC: Helping Haiti/Tweak the Tweet |publisher=Epic.cs.colorado.edu |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  2010: RHoK 1.0 and 2.0 ===
The second RHoK event was held at the Microsoft Chevy Chase offices in Washington DC on June 4–6, 2010.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/events/rhok-1-0/ |title=RHoK #1 « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/randomhacks/sets/72157624091261377/ |title=Washington, D.C. - a set on Flickr |publisher=Flickr.com |date=2010-06-06 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Public Sector DPE Team |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/publicsector/archive/2010/05/25/you-re-invited-to-be-a-part-of-the-random-hacks-of-kindness-hackathon-june-4-6-washington-dc.aspx |title=You’re Invited to be a part of the Random Hacks of Kindness “Hackathon” - June 4–6, Washington DC - Public Sector Developer Weblog - Site Home - MSDN Blogs |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2010-05-25 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhokdc.eventbrite.com/ |title=Random Hacks of Kindness DC - World Bank - Microsoft- Eventbrite |publisher=Rhokdc.eventbrite.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisis Commons hosted a Crisis Camp co-located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.crisiscommons.org/wiki/Random_Hacks_of_Kindness_2010 |title=Random Hacks of Kindness 2010 - CrisisCommons Wiki |publisher=Wiki.crisiscommons.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reception for RHoK 1.0 was held at the US State Department, and was blogged by [[Aneesh Chopra]], the United States Chief Technology Officer.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/06/03/hacking-humanity|title="Hacking for Humanity" &amp;#124; The White House|author=Aneesh Chopra|date=2010-06-03|publisher=Whitehouse.gov|accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Washington, DC RHoK was the "main stage", several other locations hosted satellite events at the same time,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; including Oxford England, Jakarta Indonesia, Sydney Australia, Nairobi Kenya, São Paulo Brazil, and Santiago Chile.fd

The "winning" hack at the Washington DC event was a new interface on CHASM (Combined Hydrology and Stability Model),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chasm.info/ |title=CHASM Software - Combined Hydrology &amp; Slope Stability Model |publisher=Chasm.info |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/2010/06/rhok-1-0-washington-d-c-winning-hack-chasm/ |title=RHoK #1.0 Washington D.C.

CHASM continues to be developed and is supported by groups including the World Bank.&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:22776384~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html?cid=EXT_TwitterWBPubs_P_EXT |title=News &amp; Broadcast - Google, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Nasa And The World Bank Team Up With Hackers From Around The World To Meet The Challenge Of Disaster Risk Management |publisher=Web.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Random Hacks of Kindness was held on December 4 and 5, 2010, in 21 cities on 5 continents.&lt;ref name="web.worldbank.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/events/rhok-2/ |title=RHoK #2 « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/2010/12/rhok-2-world-map/ |title=RHoK #2 World Map « RHoK |publisher=Rhok.org |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  2011 - 2013: RHoK 3.0, 4.0 and 5.0 ===
The fourth Random Hacks of Kindness (RHoK 3.0) was held in 2011 in the cities of: Buenos Aires, Toronto, Nairobi, Lusaka, Bogota, San Pablo, Singapur, Tel Aviv, Birmingham, México DF, Juárez, Atlanta, Chicago, Nueva York, San Francisco and Seattle. The most active city to be participant was Buenos Aires, which was held in the Globant office and the participants included Guibert Englebienne (CTO of Globant) and Alejandro Pablo Tkachuk (ex-Globant and now CTO of Calculistik) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.apertura.com/historico/Hackear-para-ayudar-20110301-0011.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

RHoK 3.0 was held twice in 2012: On the 3-4 June and again on the 1-2 December. This saw multiple cities come into play and a huge turnaround of developers from all over the world including Cape Town. The focus of the hackathon was toilets and/or sanitation.

The sixth global hackathon (RHoK 4.0) was also a major success. It was held twice in 2013 (in June and in December). UN Secretary General [[Ban Ki-moon]] gave the keynote speech at New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhok.org/2010/12/in-a-weekend-you-can-change-the-world/ |publisher=RHoK.org |title=Blog post from RHoK.org with photos of UN Secretary General launching RHoK 2.0 in New York |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unglobalpulse.org/blog/un-secretary-general-appeals-global-open-source-community |publisher=UN Global Pulse |title=UN Secretary General Speaks at Random Hacks of Kindness Launch and appeals to global Open Source community |date= |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also speaking at NYC were NASA Deputy Administrator [[Lori Garver]], Google vice president for research [[Alfred Spector]], Microsoft Director Patrick Svenburg, Parsons The New School for Design Dean Joel Towers and [[UN Global Pulse]] director, Robert Kirkpatrick.

=== 2014 - 2016 ===
2014 and 2015 saw the organisation shrink as the rhok.org website went down, cutting off global coordination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/RandomHacks/posts/10153083474620465|title=Random Hacks of Kindness|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and events in a number of cities ceased to be held. However, a new website was created at the end of 2016 at [https://rhok.cc rhok.cc]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/RandomHacks/posts/10153577566070465|title=Random Hacks of Kindness|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and communities continued to thrive in multiple cities in India and Australia, as well as Ottawa and Berlin &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aFuMeqkXlp1c3DCdMtw663r4qeg7XBy8XMkiuaYcjQ0/edit|title=RHoK Global 2016 - Review|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. RHoK Jnr, an independent effort for students in the United States, also continued to thrive, holding 7 events in 2016&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;.

=== 2017 - 2018 ===
In 2017 rebuilding of the global community continued, and connections with all the active RHoK communities around the world were reestablished. The global community grow considerably, with events over 6 cities in Australia and 3 in India, as well as events in Ottawa, Berlin, Washington DC, Pretoria, and Ghana&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o1DbAEi9tKI4duEjognV1V4Zy0YjxZmN/view|title=2017 Random Hacks of Kindness Year in Review|last=|first=|date=|work=Google Docs|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Legislative elections''' were held in the [[Russian SFSR]] on 4 March 1990.

A total of 1,068 deputies were elected to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia|Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR]] for a term of five years, 86% of them from the [[CPSU|Communist Party]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politika.su/gos/ndrs.html|title=Congress of People’s Deputies and the Supreme Soviet of RSFSR / Russian Federation|date=2008-03-03|work=Politika|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; the rest were [[non-partisan]]. Parties other than the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) were not formally allowed to participate in the election, however the elections were [[Competitive election|competitive]] and the [[Democratic Russia]] movement, an organization uniting many opposition political groups, won about 190 seats. The elected Congress began its first session on 16 May. Among the elected deputies from the CPSU was [[Boris Yeltsin]], who was then elected by the Congress as Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of RSFSR, effectively the leader of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gorby.ru/rubrs.asp?art_id=15056&amp;rubr_id=175&amp;page=5|title=Chronicle of Perestroika|date=2008-03-03|work=The Gorbachev Foundation|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070502084319/http://www.gorby.ru/rubrs.asp?art_id=15056&amp;rubr_id=175&amp;page=5|archivedate=2007-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many CPSU members, including Yeltsin, subsequently resigned from the CPSU. The CPSU was temporarily banned by Yeltsin in August 1991 in the aftermath of the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]], and the CPSU, along with the [[Soviet Union]], collapsed completely by December of the same year.

It was the first and only [[free election]] to the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR. It became the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation]] after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], and was dissolved by Yeltsin in October 1993 during the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]] and replaced by the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]].

The '''SABIA-Mar''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: {{lang|es|'''S'''atélites '''A'''rgentino-'''B'''rasileño para '''I'''nformación '''A'''mbiental del '''Mar'''}}), originally called '''SAC-E''' by [[CONAE]] is a dual satellite joint [[Earth observation satellite|Earth observation]] mission. The mission objective is to study the oceanic biosphere, its changes along time and how it is affected and reacts to human activity.&lt;ref name=conae-presentation20160210 /&gt; It focuses on monitoring of ocean surfaces, especially studies of the ocean ecosystem, the carbon cycle, marine habitats, and mapping.&lt;ref name=inpe-newsplanodiretormiolo /&gt;&lt;ref name=ioccg-chamonsabiamar /&gt;

This collaboration between the Argentine (CONAE) and the Brazilian ([[Brazilian Space Agency|AEB]]) space agencies was originally supposed to make two identical spacecraft with Argentina supplying the payload and Brazil the satellite bus. The satellites, '''SABIA-Mar A''' and '''SABIA-Mar B''', are supposed to fly in 2017 and 2018, and be operated until 2021.&lt;ref name=inpe-newsplanodiretormiolo /&gt;&lt;ref name=ioccg-chamonsabiamar /&gt;

By 2016, CONAE announced that an agreement had been reached, where Argentina would make '''SABIA-Mar 1''', and Brazil would make '''SABIA-Mar 2'''. The Argentine satellite is supposed to fly in 2020.&lt;ref name=conaeesp-sabiamarintroduction /&gt;

==SABIA-Mar 1==
SABIA-Mar 1 will be designed and built by the Argentine technological company [[INVAP]]. They will act as prime contractor, integrator and will supply two instruments. It is expected to be launched in 2020, have a 5-year design life and fly on a [[Sun-synchronous orbit|Sun-synchronous]] orbit with a four-day revisit frequency.&lt;ref name=invap-sabiamar20160822 /&gt; It successfully passed PDR on April 2016 which marked the end of Phase B development and the project thus entered Phase C, Detailed Design.&lt;ref name=conaeesp-pr20160410 /&gt;
In April 2018, the Critical Design Review of the flight segment was approved.&lt;ref name="conaecriticaldesignsegment"&gt;{{cite news|title=Otro Satélite Aprobado: Comienza la Fabricación de SABIA-Mar 1|url=http://www.conae.gov.ar/index.php/espanol/2018/1026-avances-mision-sabia-mar|accessdate=25 April 2018|agency=[[CONAE]]|date=25 April 2018|language=spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==SABIA-Mar 2==
SABIA-Mar 2 will be built in Brazil on the [[Multi Mission Platform (satellite bus)|Multi Mission Platform]] the [[satellite bus]] developed for [[Amazônia-1]]. It will have a service module with a dry mass of {{convert|292|kg|abbr=on}} and a power budget of 304&amp;nbsp;Watts, and a payload module with a mass of {{convert|219|kg|abbr=on}} and a power budget of 260&amp;nbsp;Watts.&lt;ref name=conae-phaseafinalreport /&gt;

The '''Scream the Prayer Tour''', also known as '''Scream the Prayer''', or simply '''STP''', was an American [[Christian Metal|Christian metalcore]]/[[Christian Hardcore|hardcore]] music worship tour, presented by INRI Clothing. The tour had been held annually since it began, in mid-2008. In 2013 promoters decided it would be the final tour due to low ticket sales and lack of audience.

The '''Severomorsk Disaster''' was a deadly series of [[Ammunition|munitions]] [[fire]]s that resulted in the detonation and destruction of large amounts of munitions that lasted from May 13 to 17, 1984, within the Okolnaya naval munitions depot, near the Severomorsk Naval Base (headquarters of the revered [[Northern Fleet]] of the [[Russian Navy]]). The detonation occurred in the Northern Russian "[[closed city|closed]]" [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|town]] of [[Severomorsk]] ({{lang-ru|Северомо́рск}}), over 900 miles (1,448.4 kilometers) from the Russian capital [[Moscow]].&lt;ref name="google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cr81ZHY-6H0C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=America's Nuclear Legacy|author=|date=|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="barentsobserver1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2013/12/russia-builds-huge-nuclear-missile-depot-severomorsk-13-12 |title=Russia builds huge nuclear missile depot in Severomorsk |publisher=Barentsobserver |date=2013-12-13 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Munitions had reportedly [[detonation|detonated]] after a fire started on May 13, which thus caused a massive chain of explosions on May 17, and resulted in the deaths of at least 200–300 people, and the destruction of at least 900 of the Northern Fleet's missiles and torpedoes.&lt;ref name="nytimes1984"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/11/world/soviet-naval-blast-called-crippling.html|title=Soviet Naval Blast Called Crippling|date=11 July 1984|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the dead were allegedly ordnance technicians "sent into the fire in a desperate but unsuccessful effort to defuse or disassemble munitions before they exploded", according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cr81ZHY-6H0C&amp;pg=PA193&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=America's Nuclear Legacy – Wayne D.

==Background==
The town of [[Severomorsk]] has long had history with the armed forces of both the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Federation]], a history that dates to before the [[Second World War]]. 

It is a history in part signified by the presence of at least two Russian military airbases within 10 [[kilometers]] (6.2 miles) of the town, as well as a naval base and its munitions depot (the Okolnaya naval munitions depot),&lt;ref name="barentsobserver1"/&gt; as well as serving as the main administrative base of the [[Russian Navy]]'s [[Northern Fleet]].&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

At the time of the disaster, the Northern Fleet was believed to have an [[aircraft carrier]], 148 [[cruiser]]s, [[destroyer]]s and other warships, and 190 of the navy's 371 submarines, of which two were apparently stationed at the munitions depot.&lt;ref name="nytimes1984"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://redbannernorthernfleet.blogspot.no/2008/05/soviet-naval-disaster-of-day.html |title=Russian Navy Blog: Soviet Naval Disaster of the Day – Severomorsk is Nearly Obliterated, 17 May 1984 |publisher=Redbannernorthernfleet.blogspot.no |date=2008-05-31 |accessdate=2015-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of Northern Fleet bases ENG.svg|thumb|300px|Map of military installations in and around the vicinity of Severomorsk.]]

==Incident==
On May 13, 1984, a fire started in the Okolnaya munitions depot on the outskirts of Severomorsk, the cause of which allegedly was the fact that munitions had been stored too close together.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

On May 17, the fire caused the detonation of the munitions at the depot. For about an hour and a half, sporadic blasts occurred at the supply depot, that resulted in the deaths of between 200–300 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barentsobserver.com/en/security/2013/12/russia-builds-huge-nuclear-missile-depot-severomorsk-13-12|title=Russia builds huge nuclear missile depot in Severomorsk|author=|date=|work=Barentsobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom were ordnance technicians that had been "sent into the fire in a desperate but unsuccessful effort to defuse or disassemble munitions before they exploded", according to the ''[[New York Times]]''.

Dozens of local civilians began to evacuate their apartments and head to the hills, as the blast was allegedly so powerful that it was first thought a nuclear accident had occurred.&lt;ref name="nytimes1984"/&gt;

The blast and the evacuation were described on a Russian navy blog over twenty years later;

"''Women ran into the streets with children in their arms, many only half dressed in house coats and slippers, the men running henny-penny with them, certain of them in uniform, giving the scene a weird drama. People ran up the stairs that lead up the slopes of the hills. Someone fell, he was picked up and dragged. Cars jammed the routes out of town. The cars were packed, but despite this they stopped to pick up children which their mothers literally threw into the arms of strangers. Screams, cries, curses – all drowned out by the thunder and howl from the volcano that was Mount Okol'naya ''[The apparent namesake of the Okolnaya Naval Munitions depot, where the incident had begun days earlier]. ''Black with an orange-purple mushroom top, growing to its full height in an instant, nodding toward the town, but afterwards it began to slowly settle in the direction of the tundra and the ocean.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://redbannernorthernfleet.blogspot.no/2008/05/soviet-naval-disaster-of-day.html|title=Russian Navy Blog|author=Russian Navy Blog|date=|work=redbannernorthernfleet.blogspot.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reporting and aftermath==
One of the first mentions of the incident in the media was, reportedly, an article published on July 10 of the same year by the newly established British non-fiction military weekly magazine, [[Jane's Defence Weekly]] (JDW), which claimed that it had obtained the information from "Western intelligence sources."

Though no nuclear weapons were damaged during the fire and subsequent explosion, according to the [[Norwegian Defence Research Establishment]], had nuclear weapons detonated during the blasts, the [[nuclear fallout]] would've almost certainly reached [[Norway]], just {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} away.&lt;ref name="google.com"/&gt;

An [[Annulus (mathematics)|annular]] [[solar eclipse]] occurred on May 30, 1984. A [[solar eclipse]] occurs when the [[Moon]] passes between [[Earth]] and the [[Sun]], thereby totally or partly obscuring the image of the Sun for a viewer on Earth. An annular solar eclipse occurs when the Moon's [[apparent diameter]] is smaller than the Sun's, blocking most of the Sun's light and causing the Sun to look like an [[Annulus (mathematics)|annulus]] (ring). An annular eclipse appears as a partial eclipse over a region of the Earth thousands of kilometres wide. Annularity was visible in [[Mexico]], the [[United States]], [[Azores]] Islands, [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]].

'''Team AngelicvM''' is a private company based in [[Chile]] that plans to deploy a small [[Lunar rover|rover]] on the [[Moon]] in 2020. Their rover, called '''''Unity''''', is one of various rovers that will be carried by the commercial ''Peregrine'' lander manufactured by [[Astrobotic Technology]].

==History==

Team AngelicvM was created in 2010 in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://lunar.xprize.org/teams/angelicvm Lunar XPrize - Team AngelicvM.] Accessed: 4 August 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose to compete for the [[Google Lunar X Prize]].&lt;ref name=Astrobotic&gt;[https://www.astrobotic.com/2015/10/27/team-angelicvm-will-fly-with-astrobotic-on-first-lunar-mission Team AngelicvM Will Fly with Astrobotic on First Lunar Mission]. Astrobotic Technology Press Release. 27 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This international competition offered US$20 million for the first privately-developed rover to land on the Moon, travel at least 500 meters, and transmit high-definition video and images back to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Overview|url = http://lunar.xprize.org/about/overview|website = Google Lunar XPRIZE|accessdate = 18 February 2016|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201424/http://lunar.xprize.org/about/overview|archivedate = 3 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since no team was able to make a launch attempt to reach the Moon by the 31 March 2018 deadline, the Google Lunar XPRIZE went unclaimed and the competition ended without a winner, but AngelicvM plans to go ahead with the rover's development and launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacetechasia.com/updates-on-glxp-teams-from-israel-india-and-japan/ Updates on GLXP teams from Israel, India and Japan].  Phillip Keane, ''Space Tech''. July 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Team AngelicvM is financed by AngelicvM Foundation (''Inversiones AngelicvM''); its owner and President is Gerardo Rocha-Haardt, who by 2012 has financed about $3 million USD.&lt;ref name='km Zero'/&gt; Rocha-Haardt explained that since there is no space agency in Chile, he hopes to inspire and stimulate the private sector's participation in the outer space economy.&lt;ref name='EST News'&gt;[https://www.thisischile.cl/chiles-first-lunar-rover-nears-completion/?lang=en Chile's first lunar rover nears completion]. Chile's Education, Science and Technology NEWS. 18 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Rocha-Haardt invited all Chilean universities to participate in the project. They were joined by the [[Universidad de Concepción]] and [[Universidad Austral de Chile]], that are developing the rover.&lt;ref name='km Zero'/&gt;&lt;ref name='EST News'/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campos&gt;[http://www.cosmonoticias.org/el-team-angelicvm-presento-su-rover-angelicvm-1/ El Team AngelicvM presentó su rover AngelicvM 1]. Felipe Campos ''Cosmo Noticias''. 27 June 2013. (in Spanish).&lt;/ref&gt;

AngelicvM signed a contract with [[Astrobotic Technology]] in 2015 to have their rover carried on board Astrobotic's ''Peregrine'' lander,&lt;ref name=Astrobotic/&gt; and in July 2017, Astrobotic announced an agreement had been reached with [[United Launch Alliance]] for the launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulalaunch.com/astrobotic-and-ula-announce-moon-mission.aspx Astrobotic and United Launch Alliance Announce Mission to the Moon].

Michael Coli, ''Spaceflight Insider''. 19 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Unity'' rover==

The first rover's concept was called ''Dandelion''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmonoticias.org/angelicvm-chile-hacia-la-luna/ Angelicvm: Chile hacia la Luna]. Felipe Campos, ''Cosmo Noticias'' (in Spanish). 29 December 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=REAL/&gt; Its body was spherical of about 10 cm in diameter&lt;ref name="km Zero"&gt;[https://kilometrocero.cl/la-silenciosa-carrera-espacial-chilena-5d9fc18679cf La silenciosa carrera espacial chilena]. Valentina Echeverría, ''Km Zero.'' Accessed : 4 August 2018. (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt; with a flat top and bottom. It uses two bilateral "legged" wheels for traction and it keeps upright by a [[pendulum]].  This light traction concept was inspired on insect legs, and it was considered because that is what all insects evolved for efficient displacement on uneven surfaces.&lt;ref name=REAL&gt; [http://www.real.ic.uach.cl/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=19 Dandelion rover]. Robotic &amp; Environmental Algorithms Laboratory (REAL). Accessed: 4 August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding some flexibility to each blade/leg, it imitates the tendon in the insect leg and holds potential energy for better traction.&lt;ref name=REAL/&gt; Preliminary tests performed in Chile's Atacama desert were reported to surpass their predicted expectations.&lt;ref name=REAL/&gt;

AngelicvM's current rover concept is a 5 kg, four-wheeled rover called ''Unity''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJX8SryBLyI]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Uni'&gt;[https://spacenews.com/astrobotic-adds-another-google-lunar-x-prize-team-to-its-lander/ Astrobotic Adds Another Google Lunar X Prize Team to Its Lander]. Jeff Foust, ''Space News''. 27 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The team has 34 members, all professionals and mostly volunteers. Their transmission to Earth will be a high-definition music video that carries "a message of faith, hope, peace and unity to the World.&lt;ref name=Astrobotic/&gt;

[[File:Guy-Fawkes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|A 17th-century illustration of [[Guy Fawkes]]. Fawkes tried to assassinate [[James I of England]]. He failed and was convicted of treason and sentenced to be [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].]]

In [[law]], '''treason''' is the [[crime]] that covers some of the more extreme acts against one's [[nation]] or [[sovereignty|sovereign]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/traitor "Traitor | Definition of Traitor by Merriam-Webster"]&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, treason also covered the murder of specific social superiors, such as the murder of a husband by his wife or that of a master by his servant. Treason against the king was known as [[high treason]] and treason against a lesser superior was [[petty treason]]. A person who commits treason is known in law as a '''traitor'''.

At times, the term ''traitor'' has been used as a political [[epithet]], regardless of any verifiable treasonable action. In a [[civil war]] or [[insurrection]], the winners may deem the losers to be traitors. Likewise the term ''traitor'' is used in heated political discussion{{spaced ndash}}typically as a [[term of disparagement|slur]] against [[political dissent|political dissidents]], or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents. In certain cases, as with the ''[[Dolchstoßlegende]]'' (Stab-in-the-back myth), the accusation of treason towards a large group of people can be a unifying political message. Treason is considered to be different  and on many occasions a separate charge from "treasonable felony" in many parts of the world.

==History==

[[File:Belsky Vaclav Cartoon.png|thumb|[[Cartoon]] depicting Václav Bělský (1818–1878), [[Mayor of Prague]] from 1863 until 1867, in charge of the city during [[Prussia]]n occupation in July 1866. Some forces wanted to try him for high treason (left: "What some men wished" – "Dr. Bělský for high treason"), but he got a full confidence from the Council of Prague (right: "but what they did not expect" – "address of confidence from the city of Prague").]]
In [[English law]], [[high treason]] was punishable by being [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] (men) or [[execution by burning|burnt at the stake]] (women), although [[Decapitation|beheading]] could be substituted by royal command (usually for royalty and nobility). Those penalties were abolished in 1814, 1790 and 1973 respectively. The penalty was used by later monarchs against people who could reasonably be called traitors, although most modern jurists would call it excessive. Many of them would now just be considered [[dissident]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-_0mDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=religious+dissidents+tried+for+treason+england&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qAas6fFfu_&amp;sig=2j8rQbkgRE-GjQ6ufSi5071CIgk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjN4N-Hj4jZAhVNw1kKHZ5NB5sQ6AEIPDAD#v=onepage&amp;q=religious%20dissidents%20tried%20for%20treason%20england&amp;f=false|title=The Pragmatist Turn: Religion, the Englightenment, and the Formation of American Literature|last=Gunn|first=Giles|publisher=University of Virginia Press|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Puritan Ascendance and Decline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[King Lear]]'' (c. 1600), when the King learns that his daughter [[Regan (King Lear)|Regan]] has publicly dishonoured him, he says "They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder": a conventional attitude at that time. In [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'', the ninth and lowest circle of [[Hell]] is reserved for traitors; [[Judas Iscariot]], who betrayed [[Jesus]], suffers the worst torments of all: being constantly gnawed at by one of Lucifer's own three mouths. His treachery is considered so notorious that his name has long been synonymous with ''traitor'', a fate he shares with [[Benedict Arnold]], [[Vidkun Quisling]],  [[Marcus Junius Brutus]] (who too is depicted in Dante's ''Inferno'', suffering the same fate as Judas along with [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]]). Indeed, the [[etymology]] of the word ''traitor'' originates with Judas' handing over of Jesus to the chief priests, captains of the temple and elders (Luke 22:52): the word is derived from the Latin ''[[traditor]]'' which means "one who delivers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Traitor|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=traitor|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Christian theology and political thinking until after [[Age of Enlightenment|the Enlightenment]] considered treason and [[blasphemy]] as synonymous, as it challenged both the state and the will of God. [[Divine right of Kings|Kings were considered chosen by God]],&lt;ref&gt;Cf. parallels in Eastern and Oriental cultures, such as the [[Divine mandate]] and [[Mandate of Heaven]].&lt;/ref&gt; and to betray one's country was to do the work of Satan.

Many nations' laws mention various types of treason. "Crimes Related to Insurrection" is the internal treason, and may include a [[coup d'etat]]. "Crimes Related to Foreign Aggression" is the treason of cooperating with foreign aggression positively regardless of the national inside and outside. "Crimes Related to inducement of Foreign Aggression" is the crime of communicating with [[alien (law)|aliens]] secretly to cause foreign aggression or menace. Depending on a country, [[Conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] is added to these.

==In individual jurisdictions==

===Australia===

In Australia, there are federal and state laws against treason, specifically in the states of [[New South Wales]], [[South Australia]] and Victoria. Similarly to [[Treason laws in the United States]], citizens of Australia owe allegiance to their sovereign, the federal and state level. 

The federal law defining treason in Australia is provided under section 80.1 of the Criminal Code, contained in the schedule of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Code Act 1995 - Schedule The Criminal Code|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cca1995115/sch1.html|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defines treason as follows:

{{quote|A person commits an offence, called treason, if the person:
:(a) causes the death of the Sovereign, the heir apparent of the Sovereign, the consort of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
:(b) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister resulting in the death of the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
:(c) causes harm to the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister, or imprisons or restrains the Sovereign, the Governor-General or the Prime Minister; or
:(d) levies war, or does any act preparatory to levying war, against the Commonwealth; or
:(e) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist, an enemy:
::(i) at war with the Commonwealth, whether or not the existence of a state of war has been declared; and
::(ii) specified by Proclamation made for the purpose of this paragraph to be an enemy at war with the Commonwealth; or
:(f) engages in conduct that assists by any means whatever, with intent to assist:
::(i) another country; or
::(ii) an organisation;
:that is engaged in armed hostilities against the Australian Defence Force; or
:(g) instigates a person who is not an Australian citizen to make an armed invasion of the Commonwealth or a Territory of the Commonwealth; or
:(h) forms an intention to do any act referred to in a preceding paragraph and manifests that intention by an [[overt act]].}}

A person is not guilty of treason under paragraphs (e), (f) or (h) if their assistance or intended assistance is purely humanitarian in nature.

The only permissible penalty for treason is [[life imprisonment]]. Section 24AA of the [[Crimes Act 1914]] creates the related offence of [[treachery (law)|treachery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1914 - Section 24AA|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca191482/s24aa.html|work=Commonwealth Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New South Wales====

The [[Treason Act 1351]], the [[Treason Act 1795]] and the [[Treason Act 1817]] form part of the law of [[New South Wales]]. The [[Treason Act 1795]] and the [[Treason Act 1817]] have been repealed by Section 11 of the [[Crimes Act 1900]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1900 - Section 11|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s11.html|work=New South Wales Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in so far as they relate to the compassing, imagining, inventing, devising, or intending death or destruction, or any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maim, or wounding, imprisonment, or restraint of the person of the heirs and successors of [[King George III of the United Kingdom]], and the expressing, uttering, or declaring of such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them.

Section 12 of the [[Crimes Act 1900]] (NSW) creates an offence which is derived from section 3 of the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1900 - Section 12|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s12.html|work=New South Wales Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whosoever, within New South Wales or without, compasses, imagines, invents, devises, or intends to deprive or depose Our Most Gracious Lady the Queen, her heirs or successors, from the style, honour, or Royal name of the Imperial Crown of the United Kingdom, or of any other of Her Majesty's dominions and countries, or to levy war against Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, within any part of the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, in order, by force or constraint, to compel her or them to change her or their measures or counsels, or in order to put any force or constraint upon, or in order to intimidate or overawe, both Houses or either House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, or the Parliament of New South Wales, or to move or stir any foreigner or stranger with force to invade the United Kingdom, or any other of Her Majesty's dominions, or countries under the obeisance of Her Majesty, her heirs or successors, and expresses, utters, or declares such compassings, imaginations, inventions, devices, or intentions, or any of them, by publishing any printing or writing, or by open and advised speaking, or by any overt act or deed, shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.}}

Section 16 provides that nothing in Part 2 repeals or affects anything enacted by the [[Treason Act 1351]] (25 Edw.3 c. 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1900 - Section 16|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s16.html|work=New South Wales Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This section reproduces section 6 of the [[Treason Felony Act 1848]].

====Victoria====
The offence of treason was created by section 9A(1) of the [[Crimes Act 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes Act 1958 - Section 9A|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/ca195882/s9a.html|work=Victorian Consolidated Acts|publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====South Australia====

In South Australia, treason is defined under Section 7 of the South Australia Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 and punished under Section 10A. Any person convicted of treason against South Australia will receive a mandatory sentence of [[life imprisonment]].

===Brazil===
According to [[Brazilian law]], treason is the crime of disloyalty by a citizen to the [[Federal Republic of Brazil]], applying to combatants of the Brazilian military forces. Treason during wartime is the only crime for which a person can be sentenced to death ''(see [[capital punishment in Brazil]])''.

The only military person in the [[history of Brazil]] to be convicted of treason was [[Carlos Lamarca]], an army captain who deserted to become the leader of a communist-terrorist guerrilla against the [[Brazilian military dictatorship|military government]].

===Canada===
Section 46 of the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] has two degrees of treason, called "high treason" and "treason." However, both of these belong to the historical category of [[high treason]], as opposed to [[petty treason]] which does not exist in Canadian law. Section 46 reads as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treason and other Offences against the Queen's Authority and Person|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-7.html#h-13|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
High treason&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Every one commits high treason who, in Canada,
:(a) kills or attempts to kill Her Majesty, or does her any bodily harm tending to death or destruction, maims or wounds her, or imprisons or restrains her;
:(b) levies war against Canada or does any act preparatory thereto; or
:(c) assists an enemy at war with Canada, or any armed forces against whom Canadian Forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between Canada and the country whose forces they are.
Treason&lt;br /&gt;
 (2) Every one commits treason who, in Canada,
:(a) uses force or violence for the purpose of overthrowing the government of Canada or a province;
:(b) without lawful authority, communicates or makes available to an agent of a state other than Canada, military or scientific information or any sketch, plan, model, article, note or document of a military or scientific character that he knows or ought to know may be used by that state for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or defence of Canada;
:(c) conspires with any person to commit high treason or to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a);
:(d) forms an intention to do anything that is high treason or that is mentioned in paragraph (a) and manifests that intention by an [[overt act]]; or
:(e) conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) or forms an intention to do anything mentioned in paragraph (b) and manifests that intention by an overt act.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is also illegal for a Canadian citizen or a person who owes allegiance to Her Majesty in right of Canada to do any of the above outside Canada.

The penalty for high treason is life imprisonment. The penalty for treason is imprisonment up to a maximum of life, or up to 14 years for conduct under subsection (2)(b) or (e) in peacetime.

===Finland===
Finnish law distinguishes between two types of treasonable offences: ''maanpetos'', treachery in war, and ''valtiopetos'', an attack against the constitutional order. The terms ''maanpetos'' and ''valtiopetos'' are unofficially translated as treason and high treason, respectively. Both are punishable by imprisonment, and if aggravated, by life imprisonment.

''Maanpetos'' consists in joining enemy armed forces, making war against Finland, or serving or collaborating with the enemy. ''Maanpetos'' proper can only be committed under conditions of war or the threat of war. Espionage, disclosure of a national secret, and certain other related offences are separately defined under the same rubric in the Finnish criminal code.

''Valtiopetos'' consists in using violence or the threat of violence, or unconstitutional means, to bring about the overthrow of the Finnish constitution or to overthrow the president, cabinet or parliament or to prevent them from performing their functions.

===France===
[[File:Degradation alfred dreyfus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|5 January 1895: The treason conviction of Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]].]]
Article 411-1&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3778 Article 411-1] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704025741/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3778 |date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the French Penal Code defines treason as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The acts defined by articles 411-2 to 411-11 constitute treason where they are committed by a French national or a soldier in the service of France, and constitute espionage where they are committed by any other person.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Article 411-2 prohibits "handing over troops belonging to the French armed forces, or all or part of the national territory, to a foreign power, to a foreign organisation or to an organisation under foreign control, or to their agents". It is punishable by life imprisonment and a fine of [[Euro|€]]750,000. Generally parole is not available until 18 years of a life sentence have elapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3650 195.83.177.9] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704025737/http://195.83.177.9/code/liste.phtml?lang=uk&amp;c=33&amp;r=3650 |date=2011-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 411-3 to 411-10 define various other crimes of collaboration with the enemy, sabotage, and the like. These are punishable with imprisonment for between seven and 30 years. Article 411-11 make it a crime to incite any of the above crimes.

Besides treason and espionage, there are many other crimes dealing with national security, insurrection, terrorism and so on. These are all to be found in Book IV of the code.

===Hong Kong===
Section 2 of the Crime Ordinance provides that levying war against the HKSAR Government of the People's Republic of China, conspiring to do so, instigating a foreigner to invade Hong Kong, or assisting any public enemy at war with the HKSAR Government, is treason, punishable with [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=200-2: Treason|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/CURALLENGDOC/E16492924C32B508C8256483003220EE?OpenDocument|work=Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A601-6: Schedule added|url=http://www.legislation.gov.hk/blis_ind.nsf/B505654FA2FD062B4825647A00339D10/AA8F1D14B8B1011C4825650C00330F54?OpenDocument|work=Hong Kong Crimes Ordinance|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
German law differentiates between two types of treason: "High treason" (''Hochverrat'') and "treason" (''Landesverrat''). High treason, as defined in Section 81&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Treason|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#BIii|work=Criminal Code|publisher=The Comparative Law Society|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Law of Germany|German criminal code]] is defined as a violent attempt against the existence or the constitutional order of the Federal Republic of [[Germany]], carrying a penalty of life imprisonment or a fixed term of at least ten years. In less serious cases, the penalty is 1–10 years in prison. German criminal law also criminalises high treason against a German state. Preparation of either types of the crime is criminal and carries a penalty of up to five years.

The other type of treason, ''Landesverrat'' is defined in Section 94.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treason And Endangering External Security|url=http://www.iuscomp.org/gla/statutes/StGB.htm#BII|work=Criminal Code|publisher=The Comparative Law Society|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is roughly equivalent to espionage; more precisely, it consists in betraying a secret either directly to a foreign power, or to anyone not allowed to know of it; in the latter case, treason is only committed if the aim of the crime was explicitly to damage the Federal Republic or to favor a foreign power. The crime carries a penalty of one to fifteen years in prison. However, in especially severe cases, life imprisonment or any term of at least of five years may be sentenced.

As for many crimes with substantial threats of punishment active repentance is to be considered in mitigation under §83a StGB (Section 83a, Criminal Code).

Notable cases involving ''Landesverrat'' are the [[Weltbühne]] trial during the [[Weimar Republic]] and the [[Spiegel scandal]] of 1962. On 30. July 2015, [[Public Prosecutor General (Germany)|Germany's Public Prosecutor General]] [[Harald Range]] initiated criminal investigation proceedings against the German blog [[netzpolitik.org]].

===Ireland===
{{main article|Treason in the Republic of Ireland}}
Article 39 of the [[Constitution of Ireland]] (adopted in 1937) states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;treason shall consist only in levying war against the State, or assisting any State or person or inciting or conspiring with any person to levy war against the State, or attempting by force of arms or other violent means to overthrow the organs of government established by the Constitution, or taking part or being concerned in or inciting or conspiring with any person to make or to take part or be concerned in any such attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Constitution of Ireland|url=http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/eng/Historical_Information/About_the_Constitution,_Flag,_Anthem_Harp/Constitution_of_Ireland_Eng_Nov2004.htm|work=Department of the Taoiseach|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the enactment of the 1937 constitution, the [[Treason Act 1939]] provided for the imposition of the death penalty for treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treason Act, 1939|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1939/en/act/pub/0010/index.html|work=[[Irish Statute Book]]|publisher=Government of Ireland|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Criminal Justice Act 1990 [[capital punishment in the Republic of Ireland#Abolition|abolished the death penalty]], setting the punishment for treason at life imprisonment, with parole in not less than forty years.&lt;ref name="Government of Ireland"&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Justice Act, 1990|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1990/en/act/pub/0016/index.html|work=Irish Statute Book|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No person has been charged under the Treason Act.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} [[Irish republican legitimism|Irish republican legitimatists]] who refuse to recognise the legitimacy of the [[Republic of Ireland]] have been charged with lesser crimes under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939–1998]].

===Italy===
[[File:Popravení čeští a slovenští legionáři v Davanzo.gif|thumb|upright=1.1|The [[Czechoslovak Legions|Czechoslovak legionnaires]] in Italy executed after being captured by the Austro-Hungarian forces.]]
The [[Italy|Italian]] law defines various types of crimes that could be generally described as treason (''tradimento''), although they are so many and so precisely defined that no one of them is simply called ''tradimento'' in the text of ''Codice Penale'' (Italian Criminal Code). The treason-type crimes are grouped as "crimes against the personhood of the State" (''Crimini contro la personalità dello Stato'') in the Second Book, First Title, of the Criminal Code.

Articles 241 to 274 detail crimes against the "international [[Legal personality|personhood]] of the State" such as "attempt against wholeness, independence and [[Secession|unity of the State]]" (art.241), "hostilities against a foreign State bringing the Italian State in danger of war" (art.244), "[[bribery]] of a citizen by a foreigner against the national interests" (art.246), and "political or military [[espionage]]" (art.257).

Articles 276 to 292 detail crimes against the "domestic personhood of the State", ranging from "attempt on the [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]]" (art.271), "attempt with purposes of [[terrorism]] or of [[subversion]]" (art.280), "attempt against the [[Constitution of Italy|Constitution]]" (art.283), "armed [[Rebellion|insurrection]] against the power of the State" (art.284), and "[[civil war]]" (art.286).

Further articles detail other crimes, especially those of conspiracy, such as "[[List of conspiracies (political)|political conspiracy]] through association" (art.305), or "armed association: creating and participating" (art.306).

The penalties for treason-type crimes, before 1948, included [[Capital punishment|death]] as maximum penalty, and, for some crimes, as the only penalty possible. Nowadays the maximum penalty is [[life imprisonment]] (''ergastolo'').

===Japan===
Japan does not technically have a law of treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June 12, 2007|title=Penal Code (Act No. 45 of 1907)|url=https://www.oecd.org/site/adboecdanti-corruptioninitiative/46814456.pdf|journal=Penal Code of Japan|volume=|pages=1-5|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead it has an offence against taking part in foreign aggression against the Japanese state (''gaikan zai''; literally "crime of foreign mischief"). The law applies equally to Japanese and non-Japanese people, while treason in other countries usually applies only to their own citizens. Technically there are two laws, one for the crime of inviting foreign mischief (Japan Criminal Code section 2 clause 81) and the other for supporting foreign mischief once a foreign force has invaded Japan. "Mischief" can be anything from invasion to espionage. Before World War II, Japan had a crime similar to the English crime of high treason (''Taigyaku zai''), which applied to anyone who harmed the Japanese emperor or imperial family. This law was abolished by the American Occupation force after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199295678.001.0001/acref-9780199295678-e-1836|title=A Dictionary of Contemporary World History|last=Palmowski|first=Jan|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199295678|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] has treason laws that are stipulated under the [[Crimes Act 1961]]. Section 73 of the Crimes Act reads as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Every one owing allegiance to [[Elizabeth II of New Zealand|Her Majesty the Queen]] [[Monarchy in New Zealand|in right of New Zealand]] commits treason who, within or outside New Zealand,—
:(a) Kills or wounds or does grievous bodily harm to Her Majesty the Queen, or imprisons or restrains her; or
:(b) Levies war against New Zealand; or
:(c) Assists an enemy at war with New Zealand, or any armed forces against which New Zealand forces are engaged in hostilities, whether or not a state of war exists between New Zealand and any other country; or
:(d) Incites or assists any person with force to invade New Zealand; or
:(e) Uses force for the purpose of overthrowing the [[Government of New Zealand]]; or
:(f) Conspires with any person to do anything mentioned in this section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crimes against public order: Treason and other crimes against the Queen and the State|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1961/0043/latest/DLM328520.html#DLM328520|work=Crimes Act 1961|publisher=New Zealand Government|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The penalty is [[Life imprisonment in New Zealand|life imprisonment]], except for conspiracy, for which the maximum sentence is 14 years' imprisonment. Treason was the last [[Capital punishment in New Zealand|capital crime]] in New Zealand law, with the death penalty not being revoked until 1989, years after it was abolished for [[murder]].

Very few people have been prosecuted for the act of treason in New Zealand and none have been prosecuted in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Part D - Specific Oaths|url=http://www.justice.govt.nz/publications/global-publications/r/review-of-oaths-and-affirmations-a-public-discussion-paper-may-2004/part-d-specific-oaths#2.2%20%20%20%20%20Matters%20to%20consider|work=Review of Oaths and Affirmations|publisher=New Zealand Ministry of Justice|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Article 85 of the [[Constitution of Norway]] states that "[a]ny person who obeys an order the purpose of which is to disturb the liberty and security of the [[Storting]] &lt;nowiki&gt;[Parliament]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is thereby guilty of treason against the country."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.stortinget.no/globalassets/pdf/english/constitutionenglish.pdf The Constitution of the Kingdom of Norway] from the Norwegian Parliament's website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
Article 275 of the [[Criminal Code of Russia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 29. Crimes Against the Fundamentals of the Constitutional System and State Security|url=http://www.russian-criminal-code.com/PartII/SectionX/Chapter29.html|work=The Criminal Code Of The Russian Federation|publisher=Open LLC|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines treason as "espionage, disclosure of state secrets, or any other assistance rendered to a foreign State, a foreign organization, or their representatives in hostile activities to the detriment of the external security of the [[Russian Federation]], committed by a citizen of the Russian Federation." The sentence is imprisonment for 12 to 20 years. It is not a capital offence, even though murder and some aggravated forms of attempted murder are (although Russia currently has a moratorium on the death penalty). Subsequent sections provide for further offences against state security, such as armed rebellion and forcible seizure of power.

===Sweden===
Sweden's treason laws have seen little application in modern times. The most recent case was in 2001. Four teenagers (their names were not reported) were convicted of treason after they  assaulted [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|King Carl XVI Gustaf]] with a strawberry cream cake on 6 September that year. They were fined between 80 and 100 days' income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swedish Tart Attack was Treason|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/europe/12/03/sweden.treason/| work=CNN | date=December 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===
There is no single crime of treason in [[Swiss law]]; instead, multiple criminal prohibitions apply. Article 265 of the [[Strafgesetzbuch (Switzerland)|Swiss Criminal Code]] prohibits "[[high treason]]" (''Hochverrat/haute trahison'') as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whoever commits an act with the objective of violently&lt;br /&gt;
– changing the [[Swiss Federal Constitution|constitution of the Confederation]] or of a [[Swiss cantons|canton]],&lt;br /&gt;
– removing the constitutional authorities of the state from office or making them unable to exercise their authority,&lt;br /&gt;
– separating Swiss territory from the Confederation or territory from a canton,
shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A separate crime is defined in article 267 as "diplomatic treason" (''Diplomatischer Landesverrat/Trahison diplomatique''):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
1. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to a foreign state or its agents, (...) shall be punished with imprisonment of no less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Whoever makes known or accessible a secret, the preservation of which is required in the interest of the Confederation, to the public, shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1950, in the context of the [[Cold War]], the following prohibition of "foreign enterprises against the security of Switzerland" was introduced as article 266&lt;sup&gt;bis&lt;/sup&gt;:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Whoever, with the purpose of inciting or supporting foreign enterprises aimed against the security of Switzerland, enters into contact with a foreign state or with foreign parties or other foreign organizations or their agents, or makes or disseminates untrue or tendentious claims (''unwahre oder entstellende Behauptungen / informations inexactes ou tendancieuses''), shall be punished with imprisonment of up to five years or a monetary penalty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; In grave cases the judge may pronounce a sentence of imprisonment of no less than a year.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The criminal code also prohibits, among other acts, the suppression or falsification of legal documents or evidence relevant to the international relations of Switzerland (art. 267, imprisonment of no less than a year) and attacks against the independence of Switzerland and incitement of a war against Switzerland (art. 266, up to life imprisonment).

The Swiss military criminal code contains additional prohibitions under the general title of "treason", which also apply to civilians, or which in times of war civilians are also (or may by executive decision be made) subject to. These include [[espionage]] or transmission of secrets to a foreign power (art. 86); [[sabotage]] (art. 86a); "military treason", i.e., the disruption of activities of military significance (art. 87); acting as a [[franc-tireur]] (art. 88); disruption of military action by disseminating untrue information (art. 89); military service against Switzerland by Swiss nationals (art. 90); or giving aid to the enemy (art. 91). The penalties for these crimes vary, but include life imprisonment in some cases.

===Turkey===
Treason ''per se'' is not defined in the Turkish Penal Code. However, the law defines crimes which are traditionally included in the scope of treason, such as cooperating with the enemy during wartime. Treason is punishable by imprisonment up to life.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article|High treason in the United Kingdom}}
{{See also|Petty treason|Treason felony}}
[[File:Execution of thomas armstrong 1683.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|Engraving depicting the execution of [[Sir Thomas Armstrong]] in 1684, who was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]].]]

The British law of treason is entirely [[statutory]] and has been so since the [[Treason Act 1351]] (25 Edw. 3 St. 5 c. 2). The Act is written in [[Anglo-Norman language|Norman French]], but is more commonly cited in its English translation.

The Treason Act 1351 has since been amended several times, and currently provides for four categories of treasonable offences, namely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* "when a man doth compass or imagine the death of our lord the King, or of our lady his Queen or of their eldest son and heir";
* "if a man do violate the King's companion, or the King's eldest daughter unmarried, or the wife of the King's eldest son and heir";&lt;ref&gt;As was widely pointed out in the press at the time, if the allegations that [[James Hewitt]] had an affair with [[Princess Diana]] whilst she was married to [[Prince Charles]] had been substantiated, it would have amounted to the crime of treason. Queens consort [[Anne Boleyn]], [[Catherine Howard]] and [[Caroline of Brunswick]] were prosecuted for treasonable adultery.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ipsen|first=Erik|title='Kiss and Tell' Officer Draws Heaps of Scorn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/05/news/05iht-royale.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=5 October 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "if a man do levy war against our lord the King in his realm, or be adherent to the King's enemies in his realm, giving to them aid and comfort in the realm, or elsewhere"; and
* "if a man slea the [[Lord Chancellor|chancellor]], treasurer, or the King's justices of the one bench or the other, justices in eyre, or justices of assise, and all other justices assigned to hear and determine, being in their places, doing their offices".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another Act, the [[Treason Act 1702]] (1 Anne stat. 2 c. 21), provides for a fifth category of treason, namely:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* "if any person or persons ... shall endeavour to deprive or hinder any person who shall be the next in succession to the crown ... from succeeding after the decease of her Majesty (whom God long preserve) to the imperial crown of this realm and the dominions and territories thereunto belonging".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By virtue of the [[Treason Act 1708]], the law of treason in [[Scotland]] is the same as the law in England, save that in Scotland the slaying of the [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Session]] and [[Senator of the College of Justice|Lords of Justiciary]] and counterfeiting the [[Great Seal of Scotland]] remain treason under sections 11 and 12 of the Treason Act 1708 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treason Act 1708|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/apgb/Ann/7/21/contents|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treason is a [[Reserved matters|reserved matter]] about which the [[Scottish Parliament]] is prohibited from legislating. Two acts of the former [[Parliament of Ireland]] passed in [[Treason Act (Ireland) 1537|1537]] and [[Crown of Ireland Act 1542|1542]] create further treasons which apply in [[Northern Ireland]].

The [[Treason Act 1814|penalty for treason]] was changed from death to a maximum of imprisonment for life in 1998 under the Crime And Disorder Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crime and Disorder Act 1998|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/37/contents#pt2-pb3-l1g36|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=Crown|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1998, the death penalty was mandatory, subject to the [[pardon|royal prerogative of mercy]]. Since the abolition of the [[death penalty]] for murder in 1965 an execution for treason was unlikely to have been carried out.

Treason laws were used against Irish insurgents before [[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Irish independence]]. However, members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] and other [[Irish republicanism|militant republican]] groups were not prosecuted or executed for treason for levying war against the British government during [[the Troubles]]. They, along with members of [[Ulster Loyalism|loyalist]] paramilitary groups, were jailed for [[murder]], violent crimes or [[terrorist]] offences. [[William Joyce]] ("[[Lord Haw-Haw]]") was the last person to be put to death for treason, in 1946. (On the following day [[Theodore Schurch]] was executed for [[Treachery Act 1940|treachery]], a similar crime, and was the last man to be executed for a crime other than murder in the UK.)

As to who can commit treason, it depends on the ancient notion of [[allegiance]]. As such, all [[British national]]s (but not other [[Commonwealth citizen]]s) owe allegiance to the Queen in right of the United Kingdom wherever they may be, as do Commonwealth citizens and aliens present in the United Kingdom at the time of the treasonable act (except diplomats and foreign invading forces), those who hold a British passport however obtained, and aliens who – having lived in Britain and gone abroad again – have left behind family and belongings.{{citation needed|date=July 2013|reason=for the details from "as do Commonwealth citizens..."}}

====International influence====
The [[Treason Act 1695]] enacted, among other things, a rule that treason could be proved only in a trial by the evidence of two witnesses to the same offence. Nearly one hundred years later this rule was incorporated into the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]], which requires two witnesses to the same overt act. It also provided for a three-year time limit on bringing prosecutions for treason (except for assassinating the king), another rule which has been imitated in some common law countries. The [[Sedition Act 1661]] made it treason to imprison, restrain or wound the king. Although this law was abolished in the United Kingdom in 1998, it still continues to apply in some [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries.

===United States===
{{See also|Treason laws in the United States}}
In the 1790s, [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] political parties were new and not fully accepted. Government leaders often considered their opponents to be traitors. Historian [[Ron Chernow]] reports that Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton and President George Washington "regarded much of the criticism fired at their administration as disloyal, even treasonous, in nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Chernow|title=Alexander Hamilton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iafgTEhU3QC&amp;pg=PA392|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; When an undeclared [[Quasi-War]] broke out with France in 1797–98,   "Hamilton increasingly mistook dissent for treason and engaged in hyperbole." Furthermore, the Jeffersonian opposition party behaved the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chernow|title=Alexander Hamilton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iafgTEhU3QC&amp;pg=PA569|year=2005|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1801, with a peaceful transition in the political party in power, the rhetoric of "treason" against political opponents diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Hofstadter|title=The Idea of a Party System: The Rise of Legitimate Opposition in the United States, 1780-1840|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdVQmgnDv84C&amp;pg=PA141|year=1969|publisher=University of California Press|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Smelser, "The Federalist period as an age of passion." ''American Quarterly'' (1958): 391-419. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2710583 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal====
[[File:Iva Toguri mug shot.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Iva Toguri D'Aquino|Iva Toguri]], known as ''[[Tokyo Rose]]'', was tried for treason after World War II for her broadcasts to American troops.]]
To avoid the abuses of the English law, the scope of treason was specifically restricted in the [[United States Constitution]]. [[Article Three of the United States Constitution|Article III]], section 3 reads as follows:

{{quote|Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession in open Court.

The Congress shall have Power to declare the Punishment of Treason, but no [[Attainder]] of Treason shall work [[Attainder#Corruption of blood|Corruption of Blood]], or Forfeiture except during the Life of the Person attainted.}}

The Constitution does not itself create the offense; it only restricts the definition (the first paragraph), permits the [[United States Congress]] to create the offense, and restricts any punishment for treason to only the convicted (the second paragraph). The crime is prohibited by legislation passed by [[United States Congress|Congress]]. Therefore, the [[United States Code]] at {{usc|18|2381}} states: {{quote|Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.}}

The requirement of testimony of two witnesses was inherited from the British [[Treason Act 1695]].

However, Congress has passed laws creating related offenses that punish conduct that undermines the government or the national security, such as [[sedition]] in the 1798 [[Alien and Sedition Acts]], or [[espionage]] and [[sedition]] in the [[Espionage Act of 1917]], which do not require the testimony of two witnesses and have a much broader definition than Article Three treason.  Some of these laws are still in effect. Some well-known spies, such as [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]], have been convicted of espionage rather than treason.

====Historical cases====
In the United States, [[Benedict Arnold]]'s name is considered synonymous with treason due to his collaboration with the British during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. However, this occurred before the Constitution was written. Arnold became a general in the British Army, which protected him.

Since the Constitution came into effect, there have been fewer than 40 federal prosecutions for treason and even fewer convictions. Several men were convicted of treason in connection with the 1794 [[Whiskey Rebellion]] but were pardoned by President [[George Washington]].

=====Burr trial=====
{{main article|Burr conspiracy}}
The most famous treason trial, that of [[Aaron Burr]] in 1807, resulted in acquittal. In 1807, on a charge of treason, Burr was brought to trial before the United States [[Circuit court|Circuit Court]] at [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The only physical evidence presented to the grand jury was Wilkinson's so-called letter from Burr, which proposed the idea of stealing land in the Louisiana Purchase. The trial was presided over by Chief Justice of the United States [[John Marshall]], acting as a circuit judge.  Since no witnesses testified, Burr was acquitted in spite of the full force of Jefferson's political influence thrown against him. Immediately afterward, Burr was tried on a misdemeanor charge and was again acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Charles Hoffer, ''The treason trials of Aaron Burr'' (U. Press of Kansas, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Civil War=====
During the [[American Civil War]], treason trials were held in Indianapolis against [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]] for conspiring with the Confederacy against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis J. Wertheim, "The Indianapolis Treason Trials, the Elections of 1864, and the Power of the Partisan Press." ''Indiana Magazine of History'' (1989): 236-260. [http://scholarworks.iu.edu/journals/index.php/imh/article/view/10986/15681 online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William Rehnquist, "Civil Liberty and the Civil War: The Indianapolis Treason Trials," ''Indiana Law Journal'' 72 (Fall 1997), 932+. [http://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1866&amp;context=ilj online] The author was Chief Justice of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the war the question was whether the United States government would make indictments for treason against leaders of the [[Confederate States of America]], as many people demanded. [[Jefferson Davis]], the Confederate president, was indicted and held in prison for two years. The indictment was dropped in 1869 when the political scene had changed and it was possible he would be acquitted by a jury in Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Roy Franklin Nichols, "United States vs. Jefferson Davis, 1865-1869." ''American Historical Review'' 31#2 (1926): 266-284. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1838262 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; When accepting Lee's surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia, at Appomattox, in April 1865, Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] assured all Confederate soldiers and officers a blanket amnesty, provided they returned to their homes and refrained from any further acts of hostility, and subsequently other Union generals issued similar terms of amnesty when accepting Confederate surrenders.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aleksandreia.com/2009/09/16/grant-lee-parole-treason/ . Notwithstanding this, some Northern leaders still tried to indict various Confederate leaders for treason, and Grant reminded President Johnson of the terms of surrender.&lt;/ref&gt; All Confederate officials received a blanket amnesty issued by President [[Andrew Johnson]] as he left office in 1869.

=====World War II=====
In 1949 [[Iva Toguri D'Aquino]] was convicted of treason for wartime radio broadcasts (under the name of "Tokyo Rose") and sentenced to ten years, of which she served six. As a result of prosecution witnesses having lied under oath, she was pardoned in 1977.

In 1952 [[Kawakita v. United States|Tomoya Kawakita]], a Japanese-American dual citizen was convicted of treason and sentenced to death for having worked as an interpreter at a Japanese POW camp and having mistreated American prisoners. He was recognized by a former prisoner at a department store in 1946 after having returned to the United States. The sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. He was released and deported in 1963.

=====Cold War and after=====
The [[Cold War]] saw frequent talk linking treason with support for [[Communist]]-led causes. The most memorable of these came from Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]], who used rhetoric about the Democrats as guilty of "twenty years of treason". As chosen chair of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Investigations Subcommittee]], McCarthy also investigated various government agencies for [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy rings (see the [[Venona project]]); however, he acted as a political fact-finder rather than a criminal prosecutor. The Cold War period saw no prosecutions for explicit treason, but there were convictions and even executions for [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] to commit [[espionage]] on behalf of the [[Soviet Union]], such as in the [[Julius and Ethel Rosenberg]] case.

On October 11, 2006, the United States government charged [[Adam Yahiye Gadahn]] for videos in which he appeared as a spokesman for [[al-Qaeda]] and threatened attacks on American soil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US indicts fugitive for treason|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/us-indicts-fugitive-for-treason/story-e6frf7lf-1111112352534|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The Herald Sun|date=13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was killed on January 19, 2015 in an [[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|unmanned aircraft]] (drone) strike in [[Waziristan]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[White House Press Secretary]]|title=Statement by the Press Secretary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2015/04/23/statement-press-secretary|accessdate=February 29, 2016|work=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Treason against U.S. states=====
Most states have treason provisions in their constitutions or statutes similar to those in the U.S. Constitution. The [[Extradition Clause]] specifically defines treason as an extraditable offense.

Thomas Jefferson in 1791 said that any Virginia official who cooperated with the federal [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] proposed by [[Alexander Hamilton]] was guilty of "treason" against the state of Virginia and should be executed.  The Bank opened and no one was prosecuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ron Chernow|title=Alexander Hamilton|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iafgTEhU3QC&amp;pg=PA352|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several persons have been prosecuted for treason on the state level. [[Thomas Dorr]] was convicted for treason against the state of [[Rhode Island]] for his part in the [[Dorr Rebellion]], but was eventually granted [[amnesty]]. [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] was convicted of treason against the Commonwealth of [[Virginia]] for his part in the [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry|raid on Harpers Ferry]], and was hanged. The [[Mormon]] [[prophet]], [[Joseph Smith]], was charged with treason against Missouri along with five others, at first in front of a state [[military court]], but Smith was allowed to escape&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Jeff. “A Change of Venue: Joseph Smith's Escape from Liberty Jail.” Fairmormon.org, 2 Aug. 2007, www.fairmormon.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/2007-Jeffrey-Walker.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; to Illinois after his case was transferred to a civilian court for trial on charges of treason and other crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Fawn M. Brodie, ''No Man Knows My History'' (1945, reprinted 1995, NY, Vintage Books) chap. 17, page 255.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was then later imprisoned for trial on charges of treason against Illinois, but was murdered by a lynch mob while in jail awaiting trial.

===Vietnam===
The [[Constitution of Vietnam]] proclaims that treason is the most serious crime. It is further regulated in the Criminal Code with the 78th article:&lt;ref&gt;[http://hinhsu.luatviet.co/toi-phan-boi-to-quoc-duoc-quy-dinh-the-nao/n20161028120823002.html Tội phản bội tổ quốc được quy định thế nào?]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|1. Any Vietnamese citizen acting in collusion with a foreign country with a view to causing harm to the independence, sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of the Fatherland, the national defense forces, the socialist regime or the State of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam shall be sentenced to between twelve and twenty years of imprisonment, life imprisonment or capital punishment.

2. In the event of many extenuating circumstances, the offenders shall be subject to between seven and fifteen years of imprisonment.}}

Also, according to the Law on Amnesty amended in November 2018, it is impossible for those convicted for treason to be granted amnesty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vietnamnet.vn/vn/thoi-su/quoc-hoi/pham-nhan-phan-boi-to-quoc-lat-do-chinh-quyen-khong-duoc-dac-xa-489659.html Phạm nhân phản bội tổ quốc, lật đổ chính quyền không được đặc xá]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim-majority countries===
Early in [[Islamic history]], the only form of treason was seen as the attempt to overthrow a just government or waging war against the State. According to Islamic tradition, the prescribed punishment ranged from imprisonment to the severing of limbs and the death penalty depending on the severity of the crime. However, even in cases of treason the repentance of a person would have to be taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter 5 Al-Ma'idah|url=http://www.alislam.org/quran/tafseer/?page=244&amp;region=EN|work=Al Islam|publisher=Ahmadiyya Muslim Community|accessdate=17 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the consensus among major Islamic schools is that [[Apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] (leaving Islam) is considered treason and that the penalty is death; this is supported not in the [[Quran]] but in [[hadith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cooney|first=Daniel|title=Christian convert faces death penalty in Afghanistan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/20/afghanistan.islam|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=19 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hull|first=Liz|title=Imam's daughter in hiding after her conversion to Christianity sparked death threats|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-500087/Imams-daughter-hiding-conversion-Christianity-sparked-death-threats.html|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail|date=7 December 2007|author2=Daniel Bates}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Clerics Call for Christian Convert's Death Despite Western Outrage|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,188903,00.html|work=Fox News.com|publisher=FOX News Network, LLC|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=23 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://freecopts.net/english/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=998&amp;Itemid=9 FreeCopts.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samir|first=Samir Khalil|title=Hegazi case: Islam's obsession with conversions|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&amp;art=10161|work=AsiaNews.it|publisher=AsiaNews C.F.|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bostom|first=Andrew G.|title=Death for Apostasy|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=5062|accessdate=17 November 2012|newspaper=FrontPage Magazine|date=27 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This confusion between apostasy and treason almost certainly had its roots in the [[Ridda Wars]], in which an army of rebel traitors led by the self-proclaimed prophet [[Musaylima]] attempted to destroy the [[caliphate]] of [[Abu Bakr]].

In the 19th and early 20th century, the Iranian Cleric [[Sheikh Fazlollah Noori]] opposed the [[Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] by inciting insurrection against them through issuing fatwas and publishing pamphlets arguing that democracy would bring vice to the country. The new government executed him for treason in 1909.

In [[Malaysia]], it is treason to commit offences against the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]]'s person, or to wage or attempt to wage war or abet the waging of war against the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]], a Ruler or [[Yang di-Pertua Negeri]]. All these offences are punishable by hanging, which derives from the English treason acts (as a former British colony, Malaysia's legal system is based on English [[common law]]).

====Algeria====
[[File:Harki-j.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|A young [[Harki]], an Algerian who served the French during the Algerian War, circa 1961]]
In Algeria, treason is defined as the following:
* attempts to change the regime or actions aimed at incitement
* destruction of territory, sabotage to public and economic utilities
* participation in armed bands or ''in insurrectionary movements''

====Bahrain====
In [[Bahrain]], plotting to topple the regime, collaborating with a foreign hostile country and threatening the life of the Emir are defined as treason and punishable by death. The [[State Security Law of 1974]] was used to crush dissent that could be seen as treasonous, which was criticised for permitting severe human rights violations in accordance with Article One:

{{quote|If there is serious evidence that a person has perpetrated acts, delivered statements, exercised activities, or has been involved in contacts inside or outside the country, which are of a nature considered to be in violation of the internal or external security of the country, the religious and national interests of the State, its social or economic system; or considered to be an act of sedition that affects or can possibly affect the existing relations between the people and Government, between the various institutions of the State, between the classes of the people, or between those who work in corporations propagating subversive propaganda or disseminating atheistic principles; the Minister of Interior may order the arrest of that person, committing him to one of Bahrain's prisons, searching him, his residence and the place of his work, and may take any measure which he deems necessary for gathering evidence and completing investigations.

The period of detention may not exceed three years. Searches may only be made and the measures provided for in the first paragraph may only be taken upon judicial writ.}}

====Palestine====
{{see|Capital punishment in the Gaza Strip}}
In the areas controlled by the [[Palestinian National Authority]], it is treason to give assistance to Israeli troops without the authorization of the Palestinian Authority or to sell land to Jews (irrespective of nationality) and also non-Jewish Israeli citizens under the [[Palestinian Land Laws]], as part of the PA's general policy of discouraging the expansion of [[Israeli settlement]]s. Both crimes are capital offences subject to the [[death penalty]], although the former provision has not often been enforced since the beginning of effective security cooperation between the [[Israel Defense Forces]], [[Israel Police]], and [[Palestinian National Security Forces]] since the mid-2000s (decade) under the leadership of Prime Minister [[Salam Fayyad]]. Likewise, in the [[Gaza Strip]] under the [[Hamas]]-led government, any sort of cooperation or assistance to Israeli forces during military actions is also [[Capital punishment in the Gaza Strip|punishable by death]].

'''''Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic''''' (1987) is an artwork created by Canadian [[Jana Sterbak]], first displayed at Montreal's Galerie Rene Blouin. Its most famous showing was at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in Ottawa, where it attracted national controversy. The work was composed of 50 pounds of raw [[flank steak]]s sewn together, and hung on a hanger. According to the artist, the work is a  contrast between vanity and bodily decomposition.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat&gt;{{cite news|last=Rowley|first=Storer H.|title='Flesh dress' is rotten art, some Canadians say|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nWBWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=q_ADAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=vanitas%20flesh%20dress%20for%20an%20albino%20anorectic&amp;pg=1763%2C2277170|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=The Spokane-Review|agency=Chicago Tribune|location=Spokane WA|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The artwork is in the collections of Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and of [[Centre Pompidou]] in Paris (edition of 2 + artist copy).

==Description==
The artwork consists of a "Flesh Dress", constructed of slabs of beef sewn together, hung on a tailor's dummy. On a nearby wall is a framed photograph of a model posing in the dress. The dress is stitched together from 50-60 pounds of raw flank steak and must be constructed anew each time it is shown. The work included either $260&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; or $300 worth of meat, as of its 1991 showing.&lt;ref name=atexpense&gt;{{cite news|last=Hume|first=Christopher|title=Right and left scoring points at arts' expense|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=7 April 1991|location=Toronto ON|page=C02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As suggested by the title, the work is considered within the genre of "[[vanitas]]", a category of art showing death and decay. The work includes non-traditional materials, a trend in 20th-century art.

There were some earlier instances of meat being used as clothing in art.

==Exhibition==
Montreal gallery Galerie Rene Blouin exhibited the ''Flesh Dress'' in 1987. The exhibit received "scant" attention.&lt;ref name=voicesoffire&gt;{{cite book|title=Voices of fire: art, rage, power, and the state|year=1996|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto ON|isbn=0-8020-7803-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XiBA86UK_a4C&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Vanitas:+Flesh+Dress+for+an+Albino+Anorectic&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5Y09Tu3hO4bX0QG5l8n6Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=Vanitas%3A%20Flesh%20Dress%20for%20an%20Albino%20Anorectic&amp;f=false|author1=Bruce Barber |author2=Serge Guilbaut |author3=John O'Brian |accessdate=6 August 2011|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jana Sterbak CorpsACorps.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Cover of the National Gallery catalog.]]
At age 36, Sterbak was given a retrospective show at the National Gallery of Canada called "States of Being", reviewing the past decade of her works.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; Scheduled from 8 March to 21 May 1991, the exhibit included works like "Cone on Hand" (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Jana Sterbak: States of Being" advertisement|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=5 March 1991|location=Toronto ON}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibit was relatively well-attended, compared to other shows, due in part to the controversy,&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; and was discussed in the catalog ''Jana Sterbak: States of Being = corps à corps''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jana Sterbak : states of being = corps à corps|url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/jana-sterbak-states-of-being-corps-a-corps/oclc/24796341&amp;referer=brief_results|work=Worldcat.org|accessdate=12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the meat was shriveling, flaking, and falling off, one anonymous donor gave the gallery $260 for replacement meat.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;&lt;ref name=offthehook&gt;{{cite news|title=Controversial meat dress off the hook|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=10 April 1991|agency=Canadian Press|location=Toronto ON|page=B01}}&lt;/ref&gt; (This number was of some debate, with $350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Carrot and stick|journal=Vegetarian Times| date=August 1991 |volume=168|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XwcAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=jana+sterbak&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=lIw9TuiyG4Lz0gGmouzYAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jana%20sterbak&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 August 2011|page=75|publisher=Active Interest Media, Inc.|location=Oak Park IL|issn=0164-8497}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the negative publicity the work had received, gallery staff pretended to be caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;

In 1993, the T. B. Walker Acquisition Fund purchased a copy of the work for the [[Walker Art Center]], in Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic|url=http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/957|work=Collections|publisher=Walker Art Centre|accessdate=12 August 2011|location=Minneapolis MN|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221113917/http://collections.walkerart.org/item/object/957|archive-date=21 December 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reconstructed by a small team in 2011, for the show "Midnight Party".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Construction of Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic|url=http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.10150127285028180.302281.6265053179|work=Walker Art Center Facebook page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=12 August 2011|location=Minneapolis MN|date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was later exhibited at the [[Tate Modern]] in London, for the exhibition "Rites of Passage".&lt;ref name=Aussiesteaks&gt;{{cite news|title=Lady Gaga's outfit raises the steaks|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/executive-lifestyle/lady-gagas-outfit-raises-the-steaks/story-e6frg8k6-1225922091756|accessdate=11 August 2011|newspaper=The Australian|date=14 September 2010|author=Valentine Low|author2=Laura Pitel|location=Surry Hills, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the small retrospective of her work was taken to Antoni Tàpies Foundation in Barcelona, the show was "edited down to an arid minimum" by the artist herself, which included editing out the dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Searle|first=Adrian|title=Dedicated manipulator of fashion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/dedicated-manipulator-of-fashion-1325361.html|accessdate=6 August 2011|newspaper=The Independent|date=23 January 1996|location=London UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, the work was presented at "Tous Cannibales" at ''la Maison Rouge''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.light-house-films.com/video-production/visual-arts/Jana-Sterbak-Making-of-Vanitas-Flesh-Dress-for-an-Albino-Anorectic-at-la-Maison-Rouge-in-Paris.html|title=Jana Sterbak Making of Vanitas Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic at la Maison Rouge in Paris|website=light house films.com|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010 at Elles@Centre Pompidou, Paris [http://elles.centrepompidou.fr/blog/?p=175 Jana Sterbak / Couture sanglante].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | date = 18 April 2011 | title = Making of "Vanitas: Flesh Dress for an Albino Anorectic", Jana Sterbak | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nqaFJO8-pko | format = Streaming video | medium = Short film | publisher=Lighthouse Films | accessdate  =12 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The work was one in a series of controversies surrounding the [[National Gallery of Canada]] in the 1980s and 1990s, including the acquisition of [[Barnett Newman]]'s ''[[Voice of Fire]]'' (1967), less than a year before.&lt;ref name=voicesoffire /&gt; The show drew criticism from Members of Parliament, and the organizers of food banks and soup kitchens.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; It was considered an insult, given the [[early 1990s recession]].&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;

Progressive Conservative MP [[Felix Holtmann]], a pig farmer from Manitoba commented: "I call it a jerky dress. There are a lot of people who hold food sacred in this land, and they are appalled by the use of food for this thing." In response, one newspaper editorial called him a "meat head". Holtmann was chair of the House of Commons Communications and Culture Committee, which oversees the NGC funding; the committee itself was split on the issue. The artist called Holtmann a "self-proclaimed Philistine [who is] not even successful as a hog farmer."&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; Art critic [[Christopher Hume]] commented that the Committee's concept "was based on the notion that the National Gallery is somehow accountable for poverty and hunger in Canada. Surely the irony of their desperate position is that ''they'' are members of the group that created the mess the country is now in."&lt;ref name=atexpense /&gt;

Ottawa alderman Mark Maloney called health inspectors, who found that there the work presented no health hazards.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt; Inspected on 1 April, Dr. Edward Ellis of the Ottawa-Carlton Health Department issued a statement that the dress presented "no health hazard to the public at this time", so long as no one touches or eats it. The inspector also suggested the dress was out of their jurisdiction, being on a federal property; the department asked [[Health and Welfare Canada]] to follow up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Flesh dress not a health threat|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=3 April 1991|agency=Canadian Press|location=Toronto ON}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Toronto Sun]]'' and its sister paper, the ''[[Ottawa Sun]]'', printed a cartoon featuring "a curvy, spaghetti-strapped slip" made of the same materials as the meat dress. The editorial cartoon suggested readers cut out the image, smear it with foodstuffs, and mail it to [show curator Diana] Nemiroff; her address was included with the image. The mailroom opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon; one was covered in feces. A sexually-threatening letter was sent to the NGC communications officer, who had been quoted in articles about the work. The writer for ''Canadian Art'' suggested reaction would have been different if the genders of the artist and curator were different, that the work would have likely been deemed sexist, for starters.&lt;ref name=cdnartfdn /&gt; In all, 200 people mailed food scraps to the National Gallery of Canada within a week.&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;

|salign    = right
|source    = Jana Sterbak&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;
}}Contemporary Canadian art curator Diana Nemiroff suggested the controversy was largely due to the work being taken out of the larger context of the show. "There's no doubt that the dress is a provocative object and it's meant to be a provocative object, but the cry that it's a waste of food is misplaced." She noted that other exhibits have used grains, breads, and potatoes were used as part of previous exhibits, but the flesh was likely source of the controversy. Said Nemiroff: "It's kind of double cross because clothing is supposed to be second skin and cover us up. And this one reverses the process and reveals what we don't want to confront: our mortality."&lt;ref name=spoked-meat /&gt;

The film ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'', about a man who butchers women, was released around the same time, a coincidence noted by a writer for ''Canadian Art'' magazine.&lt;ref name=cdnartfdn /&gt;

In various critical reviews, the work of German [[Joseph Beuys]] was referenced; a 1996 work by Sterbak portrayed her as a moth, eating up the clothes in his closet.&lt;ref name=beuys&gt;{{cite news|last=Hackett|first=Regina|title=Artist looks at clothing: Are we wearing it, or is it wearing us?|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Artist-looks-at-clothing-Are-we-wearing-it-or-1092669.php|accessdate=7 August 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=1 August 2002|location=Seattle WA}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''New York Times'' writer Ann Wilson Lloyd noted in 1998 that Sterbak's work "has inspired reams of humorless, abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered metaphors unturned. Yet Ms. Sterbak's work&amp;nbsp;– seductive, intensely physical and edged with dark absurdity&amp;nbsp;– delivers a mind-body frisson unknowable by intellect alone."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=Ann Wilson|title=An Absurdist Who Savors the Poetry of Technology|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/04/arts/arts-architecture-an-absurdist-who-savors-the-poetry-of-technology.html|accessdate=7 August 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 October 1998|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Verticalnet was founded in 1995 by Michael McNulty and Michael Hagan with a site called WaterOnline.&lt;ref name=landgrab/&gt;

In 1997, [[Mark Walsh (businessman)|Mark Walsh]] joined the company as its [[chief executive officer]].

In 1999, on the first day of trading after its [[initial public offering]], its shares increased in value by 180%, valuing the company at $1.6 billion, despite only having $3.6 million in quarterly revenue. The company had 1,300 advertisers, each of which were paying $6,000 per year. At that time, Internet Capital Group, now [[Actua Corporation]], owned 28% of the company and founders Michael McNulty and Michael Hagan were each worth $60 million on paper.&lt;ref name=landgrab/&gt;

In 1999, the company lost $53.5 million on revenues of $18.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1128326 | title=VerticalNet reports loss despite revenue gains | work=[[EE Times]] | date=February 22, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, revenues increased to $112.5 million and the company posted a cash loss of $28.5 million.&lt;ref name=infoweek&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.informationweek.com/verticalnet-to-acquire-e-marketplace-narrows-losses/d/d-id/1010073 | title=VerticalNet To Acquire E-Marketplace, Narrows Losses | work=[[InformationWeek]] | date=February 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2000, the company received a $100 million investment from [[Microsoft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2000/01/21/technology/verticalnet/ | title=Microsoft backs VerticalNet | work=[[CNNMoney]] | date=January 21, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2000, the [[dot-com bubble]] burst, and the [[market capitalization]] of the company fell from a peak of $10.89 billion on March 10, 2000 to $3.89 billion on May 4, 2000.&lt;ref name=adage/&gt;

In 2002, Verticalnet acquired Atlas Commerce for 14.3 million shares of Verticalnet common stock and $3.5 million of cash and the company relocated to Malvern, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1131989 | title=Verticalnet wraps acquisition of Atlas Commerce | first=Jennifer Baljko | last=Shah | work=[[EE Times]] | date=January 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, VerticalNet sold its Small and Medium Business Group to Corry Publishing, now Jameson Publishing, for a cash up-front payment of $2.35 million and a four-year performance-based earn-out of $6.5 million, as well as the assumption of certain liabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://adage.com/article/btob/verticalnet-sells-e-marketplaces-corry-publishing/254414/ | title=Verticalnet sells e-marketplaces to Corry Publishing | first=Sean | last=Callahan | work=[[Advertising Age]] | date=July 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38179">The '''Violence Against Women Act of 1994''' ('''VAWA''') is a [[United States federal law]] (Title IV, sec. 40001-40703 of the [[Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act]], {{USBill|103|hr|3355}}) signed as {{USPL|103|322}} by [[US President|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] on September 13, 1994 (codified in part at 42 U.S.C. sections 13701 through 14040). The Act provided $1.6 billion toward investigation and prosecution of violent crimes against women, imposed automatic and mandatory restitution on those convicted, and allowed civil redress in cases prosecutors chose to leave un-prosecuted. The Act also established the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] within the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

==Background==
{{refimprove section|date=October 2018}}
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna, Austria, in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that [[domestic violence]] is a public health policy and [[human rights]] concern. In the United States, according to the National Intimate Partner Sexual Violence Survey of 2010 1 in 6 women suffered some kind of [[Sexual violence by intimate partners|sexual violence]] induced by their intimate partner during the course of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;Black, M. C. et al. ''[http://www.niwrc.org/sites/default/files/documents/Resources/Stalking-report2010.pdf The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey (NISVS): 2010 Summary Report]''. Atlanta, GA: National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Violence Against Women Act was developed and passed as a result of extensive grassroots efforts in the late 1980s and early 1990s, with advocates and professionals from the battered women's movement, sexual assault advocates, victim services field, law enforcement agencies, prosecutors' offices, the courts, and the private bar urging Congress to adopt significant legislation to address domestic and sexual violence [citation needed]. One of the greatest successes of VAWA is its emphasis on a coordinated community response to domestic violence, sex dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; courts, law enforcement, prosecutors, victim services, and the private bar currently work together in a coordinated effort that did not exist before at the state and local levels [citation needed].  VAWA also supports the work of community-based organizations that are engaged in work to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking; particularly those groups that provide culturally and linguistically specific services. Additionally, VAWA provides specific support for work with tribes and tribal organizations to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking against Native American women.

Many grant programs authorized in VAWA have been funded by the U.S. Congress. The following grant programs, which are administered primarily through the [[Office on Violence Against Women]] in the U.S. Department of Justice have received appropriations from Congress:

* STOP Grants (State Formula Grants)
* Transitional Housing Grants
* Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforce Protection Orders
* Court Training and Improvement Grants
* Research on Violence Against Native American Women
* National Tribal [[Sex offender registries in the United States|Sex Offender Registry]]
* Stalker Reduction Database
* Federal Victim Assistants
* Sexual Assault Services Program
* Services for Rural Victims
* Civil Legal Assistance for Victims
* Elder Abuse Grant Program
* Protections and Services for Disabled Victims
* Combating Abuse in Public Housing
* National Resource Center on Workplace Responses
* Violence on College Campuses Grants
* Safe Havens Project
* Engaging Men and Youth in Prevention

==Debate and legal standing==
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) had originally expressed concerns about the Act, saying that the increased penalties were rash, that the increased pretrial detention was "repugnant" to the U.S. Constitution, that the mandatory HIV testing of those only charged but not convicted was an infringement of a citizen’s [[right to privacy]], and that the edict for automatic payment of full restitution was non-judicious (see their paper: "Analysis of Major Civil Liberties Abuses in the Crime Bill Conference Report as Passed by the House and the Senate", dated September 29, 1994). The ACLU has, however, supported reauthorization of VAWA on the condition that the "unconstitutional DNA provision" be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union|url=https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction |title=Tell Congress to Support the Violence Against Women Act|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051116000141/https://secure.aclu.org/site/Advocacy?pagename=homepage&amp;id=251&amp;page=UserAction|archivedate=2005-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ACLU, in its July 27, 2005 'Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197' stated that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to [[violence against women]] and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|publisher=ACLU|date=July 27, 2005|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists oppose the bill. Janice Shaw Course, a senior fellow at [[Concerned Women for America]]'s Beverly LaHaye Institute called the Act a "boondoggle" which "ends up creating a climate of suspicion where all men are feared or viewed as violent and all women are viewed as victims". She described the Act as creating a "climate of false accusations, rush to judgment and hidden agendas" and criticized it for failing to address the factors identified by the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] as leading to violent, abusive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Crouse |first=Janice Shaw |date=March 19, 2012 |title=The Violence Against Women Act Should Outrage Decent People |url=https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |work=U.S. News and World Report |type=Opinion |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171103052355/https://www.usnews.com/debate-club/should-the-violence-against-women-act-be-reauthorized/the-violence-against-women-act-should-outrage-decent-people |archivedate=November 3, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative activist [[Phyllis Schlafly]] denounced VAWA as a tool to "fill feminist coffers" and argued that the Act promoted "divorce, breakup of marriage and [[misandry|hatred of men]]".&lt;ref name="vawa-2012"/&gt;

In 2000, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held part of VAWA unconstitutional in ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'' on federalism grounds. In that decision, only the civil rights remedy of VAWA was struck down. The provisions providing program funding were unaffected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=529&amp;invol=598 United States v.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is Affirmed." (at end of opinion section III)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the reauthorization of VAWA (as HR3402) defined what population benefited under the term of "Underserved Populations" described as " Populations underserved because of geographic location, underserved racial and ethnic populations, populations underserved because of special needs (such as language barriers, disabilities, alienage status, or age) and any other population determined to be underserved by the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] or by the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services|Secretary of Health and Human Services]] as appropriate".&lt;ref name="Olivares, Mariela 2014"&gt;Olivares, Mariela. 2014.

In 2011, the law expired.&lt;ref name="USAT021213" /&gt; In 2012 the law was up for reauthorization in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bolduan|first=Kate|title=House passes GOP version of Violence Against Women Act renewal|newspaper=CNN|location=Washington|date=16 May 2012|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623034529/http://www.cnn.com/2012/05/16/politics/gop-violence-against-women/index.html|archivedate=23 June 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different versions of the legislation have been passed along party lines in the Senate and House, with the Republican-sponsored House version favoring the reduction of services to undocumented immigrants and [[LGBT]] individuals. Another area of contention is the provision of the law giving Native American tribal authorities jurisdiction over sex crimes involving non-Native Americans on tribal lands. This provision is considered to have constitutional implications,{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} as non-tribes people are under the jurisdiction of the United States federal government and are granted the protections of the U.S. Constitution, protections that tribal courts do not often have. The two bills were pending [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|reconciliation]], and a final bill did not reach the President's desk before the end of the year, temporarily ending the coverage of the Act after 18 years, as the 112th Congress adjourned.

In April 2012, the Senate voted to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, and the House subsequently passed its own measure (omitting provisions of the Senate bill that would protect gays, Native Americans living in reservations, and immigrants who are victims of domestic violence). Reconciliation of the two bills was stymied by procedural measures, leaving the re-authorization in question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work = New York Times | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | title = THE CAUCUS; G.O.P.

138 House Republicans voted against the version of the act that became law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|title=S. 47 (113th): Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 -- House Vote #55 -- Feb 28, 2013|author=|date=|website=GovTrack.us|accessdate=6 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180127204126/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h55|archivedate=27 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several, including [[Steve King]] (R-Iowa), [[Bill Johnson (Ohio politician)|Bill Johnson]] (R-Ohio), [[Tim Walberg]] (R-Michigan), [[Vicky Hartzler]] (R-Missouri), [[Keith Rothfus]] (R-Pennsylvania), and [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]] (R-Pennsylvania), claimed to have voted in favor of the act.

==Persons who are covered under VAWA immigration provisions==
VAWA allows for the possibility that certain individuals who might not otherwise be eligible for immigration benefits may petition for US permanent residency on the grounds of a close relationship with a US citizen or permanent resident who has been abusing them.  The following persons are eligible to benefit from the immigration provisions of VAWA:
* A wife or husband who has been abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident (Green Card holder) spouse. The petition will also cover the petitioner’s children under age 21.
* A child abused by a U.S. citizen or permanent resident parent. The petition can be filed by an abused child or by her parent on the child’s behalf. 
* A parent who has been abused by a U.S. citizen child who is at least 21 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VAWA: VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT|publisher=Givi Kutidze|date=November 2, 2016|url=http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206032636/http://www.us-counsel.com/green-card/vawa-violence-against-women-act/|archivedate=December 6, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coverage of male victims==

'''William H. Mumler''' (1832&amp;ndash;1884) was an American [[spirit photography|spirit photographer]] who worked in [[New York City|New York]] and [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Boston Directory. 1873&lt;/ref&gt; His first spirit photograph was apparently an accident—a self-portrait which, when developed, also revealed the "spirit" of his deceased cousin. Mumler then left his job as an engraver to pursue spirit photography full-time, taking advantage of the large number of people who had lost relatives in the [[American Civil War]]. His two most famous images are the photograph of [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] with the ghost of her husband [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the portrait of Master Herrod, a [[mediumship|medium]], with three spirit guides.

Mumler was eventually taken to court and tried for fraud and larceny. Noted showman [[P. T. Barnum]] testified against him. Though the judge acquitted him (Mumler's trial was not by jury), the event ruined his career and Mumler died in poverty. Today, Mumler's photographs are recognized as fakes but they circulated widely during the last quarter of the 19th century and were marketed as objects of belief and visual curiosities both within and beyond the spiritualist movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Supernatural Entertainments: Victorian Spiritualism and the Rise of Modern Media Culture|last = Natale|first = Simone|publisher = Pennsylvania State University Press|year = 2016|isbn = 978-0-271-07104-6|location = University Park, PA|pages = 147–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before beginning his career as a spirit photographer, Mumler worked as a [[engraving|jewellery engraver]] in [[Boston]],&lt;ref&gt;Boston Directory. 1856, 1858, 1862, 1868&lt;/ref&gt; practicing amateur photography in his spare time.&lt;ref name="ghosts"&gt;{{cite book |last= Willin|first= Melvyn|others= West, Donald|title= Ghosts Caught on Film: Photographs of the Paranormal|year= 2007|publisher= David &amp; Charles|location= [[Newton Abbot]]|isbn= 978-0-7153-2728-9|pages= 22|chapter= The Earliest Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1860s, he developed a [[self-portrait]] that appeared to feature the [[ghost|apparition]] of his cousin who had been dead for 12 years.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt;&lt;ref name="college"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecollegetimes.com/vnews/display.v/ART/2006/04/20/4446c24cb566f|title= The paranormal pictures of William Mumler|accessdate= 2008-05-04|date= 2006-04-20|publisher= ''College Times''|archiveurl= http://www.unexplained-mysteries.com/viewnews.php?id=67517|archivedate= 2006-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is widely credited as the first "spirit photograph"—a photograph of a living subject featuring the likeness of a deceased person (often a relative) imprinted by the spirit of the deceased.&lt;ref name="hoax"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/day/04_26_2001.html|title= William Mumler's Spirit Photography|accessdate=2008-05-04 |last= Boese|first= Alex|date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mumler then became a full-time spirit photographer, continuing to work in Boston but eventually moving to [[New York City]], where his work was analyzed by numerous photography experts, none of whom could find any evidence of fraud.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; Spirit photography was a lucrative business thanks to the enormous death tolls that resulted from the [[American Civil War]], and the thousands of families who sought reassurance that their loved ones live on after death.&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt;

Mumler's wife, Hannah Mumler, was also a famous "healing medium," and conducted her own spiritual business in addition to the business of assisting her husband.&lt;ref name="Kaplan 2008 304"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaplan|first=Louis|title=The Strange Case of William Mumler|year=2008|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-5157-3|pages=304|url=http://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/the-strange-case-of-william-mumler-spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Mumler's work included [[P. T. Barnum]], who claimed that Mumler was taking advantage of people whose judgment was clouded by grief.&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt; Barnum's accusation was one of many in a chorus voices that had accused Mumler of staging "ghosts" of people who were still in fact living,&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; and breaking into houses to steal photos of deceased relatives.&lt;ref name="college"/&gt; According to [[Joe Nickell]] "Mumler was exposed as a fraud when people recognized that some of the supposed spirits were still among the living."&lt;ref&gt;
Nickell, Joe. (2008). [http://www.csicop.org/si/show/photoghosts_images_of_the_spirit_realm "Photoghosts: Images of the Spirit Realm?"]. Csicop.org. Retrieved 2014-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt; Mumler was eventually brought to trial for [[fraud]] in April 1869.&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt; Barnum testified against him, having hired [[Abraham Bogardus]] to create a picture that appeared to show Barnum with the ghost of [[Abraham Lincoln]] to demonstrate the ease with which such "spirit photographers" could be created.&lt;ref name="hoax"/&gt; Those testifying in support of Mumler included Moses A. Dow, a journalist whom Mumler had photographed.&lt;ref name="psychic"/&gt; Ultimately Mumler was acquitted because the prosecution could not prove beyond all doubt that he was fabricating the photographs, but following the trial his career never fully recovered.

Mumler continued working in photography (though never spirit photography), and later discovered a process by which photo-electrotype plates could be produced and printed as easily as woodcuts (known as the "Mumler Process").&lt;ref name="Kaplan 2008 304"/&gt; He died in 1884, and his obituary focused on his photographic contributions in general, making only a passing reference to the earlier spirit photography scandal in the last line.

==Photographs==

===Ghost of Abraham Lincoln===
[[File:Mumler (Lincoln).jpg|thumb|150px|left|Mary Todd Lincoln with the "ghost" of her husband.]]
Mumler's most famous photograph apparently shows [[Mary Todd Lincoln]] with the "ghost" of her husband, [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; Paranormal researcher Melvyn Willin, in his book ''Ghosts Caught on Film'', claims that the photo was taken around 1869, and that Mumler did not know that his sitter was Lincoln, instead believing her to be a 'Mrs Tundall'. Willin goes on to say that Mumler did not discover who she was until after the photo was developed.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; The [[College of Psychic Studies]], referencing notes belonging to [[William Stainton Moses]] (who has appeared in photographs by other spirit photographers), claim that the photo was taken in the early 1870s, that Mrs. Lincoln assumed the name of 'Mrs. Lindall,' and that she had to be encouraged by Mumler's wife (a [[Mediumship|medium]]) to identify her husband on the photo.&lt;ref name="psychic"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collegeofpsychicstudies.co.uk/index.html?http%3A//www.collegeofpsychicstudies.co.uk/archives/examples.html|title= William Stainton Moses collection|accessdate=2008-05-04 |publisher= College of Psychic Studies}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although the image has been dismissed as a fraudulent [[multiple exposure|double exposure]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa022100a.htm|title= Presidents and the Paranormal|accessdate=2008-05-04 |last= Wagner|first= Stephen|publisher= [[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has been widely circulated.&lt;ref name="psychic"/&gt;

===Master Herrod===
[[File:Mumler (Herrod).jpg|thumb|100px|right|An image of Herrod with a single "ghost".]]
Master Herrod was a young [[mediumship|medium]] from [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] photographed by Mumler in about 1872.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; One photograph, once developed, apparently showed Herrod in a trance surrounded by the spirits of Europe, Africa and America.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; The photograph was advertised for sale in ''The Religio-Philosophical Journal'' on August 24, 1872.&lt;ref name="psychic"/&gt;

===Other photographs===
Other photographs by Mumler included pictures showing various spirits (including relatives, fiancés, actresses and spirit guides) with living sitters.&lt;ref name="ghosts"/&gt; Other well-known sitters include [[Moses A. Dow]] (editor of ''[[The Waverley Magazine]]'') whose photograph apparently showed the spirit of his assistant Mabel Warren, and Fanny Conant, a well-known [[mediumship|medium]] from [[Boston]], apparently photographed with the ghost of her brother Chas.&lt;ref name="psychic"/&gt;
