[[File:Bale Village Sign 30 August 2008 (2).JPG|The top of the village sign depicts the Bale oak|thumb]]
The '''Bale Oak''' was a large [[oak]] [[tree]] in [[Bale, Norfolk|Bale]], a village in northern [[Norfolk, England]] that measured {{convert|36|ft|m}} in circumference, was over 500 years old and, reportedly, featured branches over {{convert|70|ft|m}} long.

==History==
In the middle of the 14th century, All Saints church was erected immediately east of the site of the tree. According to folk legend, the tree had previously been a site for [[Paganism|pre-Christian worship]] and may have been a part of a larger grove.

In 1795, the oak was severely damaged. The oak was heavily [[pollarding|pollarded]] and the removed bark and some of the wood was sold to the Hardys of Letheringsett for tanning.

Norfolk historian [[Blomfield (Norfolk historian)|Blomfield]] recorded use of the oak in the 18th century:{{cn|date=November 2012}}
:''A great oak at bathele near the church, its hollow so large that ten or twelve men may stand within it and a cobbler had his shop and lodge there of late and it is or was used for a swinestry''.

Deemed dangerous by the local populace, the abuse of the tree lead to its destruction in 1860. The Lord of the Manor [[Sir Willoughby Jones, 3rd Baronet|Sir Willoughby Jones]] ordered the tree removed and, with much local mourning, the remains taken carted to Cranmer Hall at [[Fakenham]].

The site is now covered by a grove of [[Quercus ilex|Holm oaks]] and is protected by the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty]].

'''Bamse''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for "teddy bear") (1937 – 22 July 1944) was a [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernard]] dog that became the [[hero]]ic [[mascot]] of the [[Free Norwegian Forces]] during the [[World War II|Second World War]].  He became a symbol of Norwegian freedom during the war.

==Pre-war life==
Bamse was bought in [[Oslo]], Norway by Captain [[Erling Hafto]], the [[captain (nautical)|master]] of the Norwegian whale-catcher ''[[HNoMS Thorodd|Thorodd]]'', and he was taken to sea from an early age. In her childhood memories of pre-war [[Honningsvåg]], Captain Hafto's daughter Vigdis remembers Bamse as a very kind dog that would look after the children while they were playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.finnmarkdagblad.no/Kultur/article2352959.ece |title=Prins Andrew avdukerbronsestatue av Bamse |trans-title=Prince Andrew unveils bronze statue of Bamse |newspaper=[[Finnmark Dagblad]] |date=17 October 2006 |accessdate=18 April 2015 |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military service==
At the onset of the Second World War, ''Thorodd'' was drafted into the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]] as a coastal patrol vessel, based in [[Hammerfest]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161012014414/http://niehorster.org/022_norway/navy_03.htm ]  &lt;/ref&gt; and Bamse was enrolled as an official crew member on 9 February 1940. After the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] [[invasion of Norway]]  on 9 April 1940 the ''Thorodd'' was part of the naval opposition to the Germans and had as one of its uses [[POW]] transport. Shortly before the 10 June 1940 capitulation of mainland Norway, ''Thorodd'' was one of 13 Norwegian naval vessels to escape to the UK, arriving 17 June 1940. She was converted to a [[minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] in [[Rosyth]] from June 30, 1940 and stationed in [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and [[Dundee]] in [[Scotland]], where she remained for the rest of the war.

[[File:Bamse-180 56445a.jpg|thumb|Bamse being given a bath aboard the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] [[HNoMS Thorodd|HNoMS ''Thorodd'']]]]

===Bamse and his crew===
Bamse lifted the morale of the ship's crew, and became well known to the local civilian population.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In battle, he would stand on the front gun tower of the boat, and the crew made him a special metal helmet.  His acts of heroism included saving a young lieutenant commander who had been attacked by a man wielding a knife by pushing the assailant into the sea, and dragging back to shore a sailor who had fallen overboard. He was also known for breaking up fights amongst his crewmates by putting his paws on their shoulders, calming them down and then leading them back to the ship. One of Bamse's tasks in Scotland was to round up his crew and escort them back to the ship in time for duty or curfew. To do this, he travelled on the local buses unaccompanied, and the crew bought him a [[bus pass]] which was attached to his collar. Bamse would wander down to the bus stop at Broughty Ferry Road and take the bus down to Dundee. He would get off at the bus stop near his crew's favourite watering hole, the Bodega Bar and go in to fetch them. If he could not locate his friends he would take the bus back to base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Siri |last=Lawson |url=http://www.warsailors.com/singleships/thorodd.html |title=Thorodd - Norwegian Merchant Fleet 1939-1945 |work=Warsailors.com |accessdate=18 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patriotic symbol===
From his ship's mascot, Bamse became mascot of the Royal Norwegian Navy, and then of all the Free Norwegian Forces. An iconic photograph of him wearing a Norwegian [[sailor's cap]] was used on patriotic [[Easter cards]] and [[Christmas card]]s during the war.  The [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals|PDSA]] made him an official [[Allied Forces Mascot]].

==Death==
Suffering from [[heart failure]], Bamse died on the dockside at Montrose on 22 July 1944.  He was buried with full military honours. Hundreds of Norwegian sailors, Allied servicemen, schoolchildren and townsfolk from Montrose and Dundee attended his funeral.  His grave site in the sand dunes has been looked after by local people. The Royal Norwegian Navy holds a commemorative ceremony every ten years.

==Post-war honours==
Bamse was posthumously awarded  [[Norges Hundeorden]] on 30 September 1984 for his war service.  In 2006, he was also awarded the [[PDSA Gold Medal]] (sometimes known as the "animals' [[George Cross]]") for gallantry and devotion to duty, the only World War II animal to have received this honour. 

On 17 October 2006, HRH [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York|The Duke of York]] unveiled a larger than life sized bronze statue of Bamse, made by Scottish sculptor [[Alan Herriot]], on Montrose's Wharf Street. The Norwegian [[Consul (representative)|consul]] in Edinburgh, Bjørn Eilertsen, brought greetings from Norway's king, [[Harald V]]. Other attendees included the Lathallan School Pipe Band,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lathallan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=77 |title=Lathallan School Pipe Band |accessdate=20 February 2009 |work=Lathallan School |publisher= |date= | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090119162353/http://www.lathallan.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=57&amp;Itemid=77| archivedate=19 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Royal Norwegian Navy representatives, Hans Petter Oset (director of the [[Royal Norwegian Navy Museum]]), and Vigdis Hafto (the daughter of Bamse's owner). 

In August 2008 author and columnist Angus Whitson and Andrew Orr of the Montrose Bamse Project published a new book, ''Sea Dog Bamse''.  The book charts Bamse's life — from prewar days in [[Honningsvåg]], through the five years of war, until his heartfelt death. Using extensive source material and new eyewitness accounts, it relates stories of the Hafto family, the [[Norwegian Campaign]], the minesweeper ''Thorodd'' and its crew, the naval war off East Scotland, and the bonds between the Norwegians and the Scots are threaded together. The hardback version became a Scottish best-seller, and a paperback version was released in October 2009.

Media attention renewed interest in Bamse in Norway. The Royal Norwegian Navy Museum (Marinemuseet) at [[Horten]] planned to install a smaller bronze version of the statue. In addition, the mayor of [[Nordkapp]] municipality (which includes Honningsvåg), Kristina Hansen, and project manager Sigurd Berg-Hansen visited Montrose in November 2008, and launched a campaign to raise funds to purchase and install a duplicate bronze statue of Bamse on the waterfront at Honningsvåg, which currently has about 250,000 annual visitors. In December 2008 the Norwegian [[Minister of Defence (Norway)|Minister of Defence]], [[Anne-Grete Strøm-Erichsen]] announced that her ministry supported the Bamse project in Honningsvåg and would grant {{NOK|70,000}} to the memorial statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Svein G. |last=Jørstad |title=Støtter Bamse-minnesmerke |trans-title=Support the Bamse memorial |url=http://www.finnmarkdagblad.no/nyheter/article4011608.ece |newspaper=[[Finnmark Dagblad]] |date=24 December 2008 |accessdate=13 January 2009 |language=Norwegian | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226091657/http://www.finnmarkdagblad.no/nyheter/article4011608.ece| archivedate= 26 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 May 2009  Royal Norwegian Navy cutter MV ''Leikvin'' transported a Bamse statue from the Port of Leith, Scotland to Honningsvåg. On 19 June 2009 schoolchildren from Honningsvåg and from Montrose unveiled the statue on the Honningsvåg harbour, in front of the museum (which tells his story in detail). The combined bands of the Skolekorps and Lathallan School's pipe band entertained the large crowd of supporters from Scotland, Norway, Sweden and Canada. The new statue of Bamse at Honningsvåg faces south west towards Montrose, and the Scottish statue is faces north-east towards Honningsvåg.

During 2016 a 17 acre forest was planted in honour of Bamse. The scheme "[[Bamse's Wood]]" was supported by the Forestry Commission. The location is at Guards Lonning, Nether Wasdale, Cumbria, CA20 1EN OS grid ref NY108056.

'''Bowfin''' (''Amia calva'') are bony fishes related to [[gar]]s in the infraclass [[Holostei]]. Common names include mudfish, mud pike, dogfish, griddle, grinnel, swamp trout and choupique. They are regarded as [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[relict species|relicts]], being the sole surviving species of the [[order (biology)|order]] [[Amiiformes]] which dates from the [[Jurassic]] to the [[Eocene]], persisting to the present. Although bowfin are highly evolved, they are often referred to as "[[primitive fishes]]" because they have retained some morphological [[Cladistics#Terminology for character states|characteristics of their early ancestors]].

Bowfin are [[Demersal fish|demersal]] freshwater [[piscivore]]s native to North America, and commonly found throughout much of the eastern [[United States]], and in southern [[Ontario]] and [[Quebec]]. Fossil deposits indicate Amiiformes were once widespread in both freshwater and marine environments with a range that spanned across North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. Now their range is limited to much of the eastern United States and adjacent southern Canada, including the [[drainage basin]]s of the [[Mississippi River]], [[Great Lakes]] and various rivers exiting in the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]] or [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Their preferred habitat includes vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps and backwater areas; they are also occasionally found in brackish water. They are stalking, ambush predators known to move into the shallows at night to prey on fish and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects.

Like [[gar]]s, bowfin are bimodal breathers which means they have the capacity to breathe both water and air. Their [[Fish gill|gills]] exchange gases in the water allowing them to exploit oxygen for breathing, but they also have a [[gas bladder]] that serves to maintain buoyancy, and also allows them to breathe air by means of a small [[pneumatic duct]] connected from the foregut to the gas bladder. They can break the surface to gulp air, which allows them to survive conditions of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|aquatic hypoxia]] that would be lethal to most other species.

The body of the bowfin is elongated and cylindrical, with the sides and back [[Olive (color)|olive]] to brown in color, often with vertical bars, and dark reticulations, or camouflaged pattern. The dorsal fin has horizontal bars, and the caudal fin has irregular vertical bars. The underside is white or cream, and the paired fins and anal fin are bright green. During larval stage, hatchlings from about {{convert|7|-|10|mm|in|abbr=on}} total length are black and tadpole-like in appearance.&lt;ref name="WVDNR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wvdnr.gov/wildlife/magazine/archive/06summer/bowfin.pdf | title=Bowfin | publisher=West Virginia DNR | work=Wildlife Diversity Notebook | date=2006 | accessdate=September 25, 2014 | author=Jeff Hansbarger}}&lt;/ref&gt; At approximately {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} total length they have been described as looking like miniature [[placoderms]].&lt;ref name="Berra"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-1Ygw6XwFQC&amp;pg=PA52 | title=Freshwater Fish Distribution | publisher=University of Chicago Press | work=Families and Maps | date=September 15, 2008 | author=Berra, Tim | page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; They grow quickly, and typically leave the nest within 4 to 6 weeks after hatching.&lt;ref name="ADW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu/accounts/Amia_calva/ | title=Amia calva | publisher=University of Michigan | work=Animal Diversity Web | accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young males have a black [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]] on the base of the tail ([[caudal peduncle]]) that is commonly encircled by an orange-yellowish border while the female's is black, if present at all.

The skull of the bowfin is made of two layers of skull, the [[dermatocranium]] and the [[chondrocranium]]. The chondrocranium layer cannot be seen because it is located below the dermal bones. The bowfin skull is made up of 28 fused bones, which compose the dermatocranium. The roof of the mouth is made up of 3 bones, the ectopterygoid, the palantine, and the vomer. The teeth are on two bones, the premaxillae and the maxillae. Another three bones make up the lower jaw the dentary, the angular, and the surangular. The cranial surface of the skull is made up of the nasals, the antorbital, the lacrimal, the parietal, the intertemporal, the post parietal, the supratemporal, the extra scapular, the post temporal, and the opercular. The entirety of the skull is attached to the girdle through another set of bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/732361696|title=Vertebrates : comparative anatomy, function, evolution|last=V.|first=Kardong, Kenneth|date=2012-01-01|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073524238|oclc=732361696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fishes similar in appearance===
[[Northern snakehead]]s (''Channa argus'') are commonly mistaken for bowfin because of similarities in appearance, most noticeably their elongated, cylindrical shape, and long dorsal fin that runs along their backs. Northern snakeheads are [[piscivores|piscivorous]] fishes native to the rivers and estuaries of China, Russia, and Korea.&lt;ref name=NYDEC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/45470.html | publisher=New York Department of Environmental Conservation | title=Northern Snakehead Fish | accessdate=July 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, unlike bowfin which are native to North America, the northern snakehead is considered an [[invasive species]] and environmentally harmful.&lt;ref name="TxPWD"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/huntwild/wild/species/exotic/snakehead_bowfin.phtml | title=Bowfin and Snakeheads: Distinguishing Features | publisher=Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department | work=Brochure | accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/30/northern-snakehead-fish-invasive-species_n_3358192.html | title=Northern Snakehead Fish, Invasive Species, May Not Be As Bad As Originally Thought | publisher=Reuters | work=Huffington Post Green | date=May 30, 2013 | accessdate=August 4, 2014 | author=Deborah Zabarenko}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some contrasting differences in bowfin include a black [[Eyespot (mimicry)|eyespot]] on their caudal peduncle, a tan and olive coloration, a shorter anal fin, a more rounded head, and an upper jaw that is longer than its lower jaw.&lt;ref name="InDNR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.in.gov/activecalendar/EventList.aspx?fromdate=6/1/2012&amp;todate=6/30/2012&amp;display=Month&amp;type=public&amp;eventidn=57006&amp;view=EventDetails&amp;information_id=114486 | title=Bowfin mistaken as snakeheads | publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources | work=Alerts and Notifications, event calendar press release | date=June 27, 2012 | accessdate=June 14, 2014 | author=DNR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[burbot]], a [[predator]]y fish native to streams and lakes of North America and Eurasia, is also commonly mistaken for bowfin. Burbots can be distinguished by their flat head and chin barbel, long anal fin, and pelvic fins situated beneath the pectoral fins.&lt;ref name="WiDNR"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dnr.wi.gov/lakes/cbcw/publications/FH-715.pdf | title=Snakehead, Bowfin, or Burbot&amp;nbsp;— Know the difference | publisher=Wisconsin Dept. of Natural Resources | work=Wisconsin Anglers Want To Know brochures | accessdate=June 14, 2014 | author=Bureau of Fisheries Management}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of bowfin morphology ==
The first fishes lacked jaws and used negative pressure to suck their food in through their mouths. The jaw in the bowfin is a result of their evolutionary need to be able to catch and eat bigger and more nutritious prey. As a result of being able to gather more nutrients, Bowfin are able to live a more active lifestyle. The jaw of a bowfin has several contributions. The maxilla and premaxilla are fused and the posterior chondrocranium articulates with the vertebra which allows the jaw freedom to rotate. The suspensorium includes several bones and articulates with the snout, brain case, and the mandible. When the jaw opens [[Epaxial and hypaxial muscles|epaxial muscles]] lift the chondrocranium which is attached to the upper jaw, and [[Adductor muscles (bivalve)|adductor muscles]] close the lower jaw. This ability to open and close the jaw allows the bowfin to become more of a predator, in that it can catch bigger prey and be able to mechanical catch, and digest it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function, Evolution|last=Kardong|first=Kenneth V|publisher=New York: McGraw-Hill Education|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vertebral column]] in bowfin is ossified and in comparison to earlier fishes, the centra are the major support for the body, whereas in earlier fish the notochord was the main form of support. Neural spines and ribs provide additional support and help stabilize unpaired fins. In bowfin neural spines and ribs also increase in prominence, an evolutionary aspect that helps them stabilize unpaired fins. The evolution of the vertebral column allows the bowfin to withstand lateral bending that puts the column under compression without breaking. This, in turn, allows the bowfin to have more controlled and powerful movements, in comparison to fish that had only a notochord. The bowfin has a rounded heterocercal tail that resembles a homocercal tail. This type of tail gives the body a streamlined shape which allows the bowfin to improve its swimming ability by reducing drag. These types of tails are common in fish with gas bladders, because the bladder supplies the fish with natural buoyancy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Hal - Cyprinus carpio and Amia calva skeletons.jpg|thumb|The lower figure is a skeleton of the bowfin. The pelvic and pectoral girdles are both visible and the axial and cranial elements are also both present.]]
The bowfin is an [[actinopterygii]] which means that the pectoral girdle is partly [[Endochondral ossification|endochondral]] but mostly [[dermal bone]]. In this group of fishes the fins function to maneuver, brake, and for slight positional adjustments. The pectoral girdle of the bowfin has six parts. The post temporal, supracleithrum, postcleithrum, cleithrum, scapulacoracoid, and the clavicle make up the [[pectoral girdle]]. The pectoral girdle is attached to the skull. The pectoral girdle is made of mostly dermal and some endochondral bone. The paired pectoral and pelvic fins of fish are homologous with the limbs of tetrapods.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Physiology==
[[File:Amia Gas Bladder.jpg|thumb|Dissection of a bowfin [[swim bladder]]]]
Bowfin, like other [[physostome]]s such as bichirs ([[Polypteridae]]), gars ([[gar|Lepisosteidae]]), and the lungfishes ([[Dipnoi]]), are capable of [[bimodal]] respiration. They can extract oxygen from the water when breathing through their [[gills]], and can also break the water's surface to breathe or gulp air through a small [[pneumatic duct]] connected from their foregut to the [[gas bladder]].&lt;ref name="WaEDU05"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://courses.washington.edu/fish311/FISH%20311%20files/05-Swimbladder.pdf| title=Swimbladder | publisher=University of Washington | work=Biology of Fishes-Fish/Biol 311 | accessdate=August 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NCB&gt;{{cite journal|title=Control of gill ventilation and air-breathing in the bowfin amia calva |vauthors=Hedrick MS, Jones DR |date=January 1999|pmid=9841898|volume=202|journal=J.

===Genome evolution===
The bowfin [[genome]] contains an intact [[ParaHox]] [[gene cluster]], similar to the [[bichir]] and to most other [[vertebrate]]s. This is in contrast, however, with [[teleost]] fishes, which have a fragmented ParaHox cluster, probably because of a [[whole genome duplication]] event in their lineage. The presence of an intact ParaHox gene cluster suggests that bowfin ancestors separated from other fishes before the [[last common ancestor]] of all [[teleost]]s appeared. Bowfin are thus possibly a better model to study vertebrate genome organization than common teleost [[model organism]]s such as [[zebrafish]].&lt;ref name="Mulley2006"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Breakup of a homeobox cluster after genome duplication in teleosts | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600341103 | url = http://www.pnas.org/content/103/27/10369.full | author =  John F.

==Feeding behavior==
[[File:Gill Rakers of Amia Calva.jpg|thumb|The [[gill raker]]s are short with blunt processes and with a small space in between them. They are connected to the gill arch of the gills.]]
Bowfin are stalking, ambush predators that customarily move into the shallows at night to prey on fish, and aquatic invertebrates such as crawfish, mollusks, and aquatic insects.&lt;ref name="InDFW"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.in.gov/dnr/fishwild/files/fw-bowfin.pdf | title=Bowfin (Amia calva) | publisher=Indiana Department of Natural Resources | accessdate=June 13, 2014 | author=Indiana Department of Fish &amp; Wildlfife}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young bowfin feed mostly on small [[crustaceans]], while adults are mostly [[piscivorous]], but also known to be opportunistic.&lt;ref name="fishsc" /&gt; Bowfin are remarkably agile, can move quickly through the water, and they have a voracious appetite.&lt;ref name="StewartWatkinson2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz2010" /&gt; Their undulating dorsal fin propels them silently through the water while stalking their prey. The attack is straightforward and swift with a movement that lasts approximately 0.075 seconds.&lt;ref name="Ross2001" /&gt; There were also some studies regarding the capacity of the bowfin to survive without food. In 1916, A female bowfin was starved for twenty months.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smallwood|first=W. M.|date=1916-01-01|title=Twenty Months of Starvation in Amia Calva|jstor=1536322|journal=Biological Bulletin|volume=31|issue=6|pages=453–464|doi=10.2307/1536322}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the longest period that any vertebrate had been without food, as far the writer was aware during the observation. Some independent studies focus on the bowfin's ability to used organic material as a source of food and studied the structure of the [[gill raker]]. They concluded that it did not benefit from the organic material in the water because the gill rakers were short with blunt processes and a short space between them. Even bacteria could enter and exit through the gill easily. Its structure alone indicated that the ''Amia'' doesn't use microorganism as a source of food.

==Distribution and habitat==

===Stocking===
Research from the late 1800s to the 1980s suggests a trend of intentional stockings of non-indigenous fishes into ponds, lakes and rivers in the United States. At that time, little was known about environmental impacts, or long-term effects of new species establishment and spread as a result of "fish rescue and transfer" efforts, or the importance of nongame fishes to the ecological balance of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref name="UofWI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/EcoNatRes/EFacs/FishesWI/reference/econatres.fisheswi.i0008.pdf | title=Early Limnological and Fishery Research | publisher=University of Wisconsin | work=Wisconsin Fishes and Fishery Management | accessdate=August 9, 2014 | pages=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introductions of bowfin to areas they were considered a non-indigenous species included various lakes, rivers and drainages in Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt; Many of the introductions were intentional stockings by various resource management; however, there is no way to positively determine distribution resulting from flood transfers, or other inadvertent migrations. Bowfin are typically piscivorous, but as an introduced species are capable of being voracious predators that pose a threat to native fishes and their prey.&lt;ref name="USGS"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FAO"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y3610e/y3610e12.htm | title=Potential Adverse Socio-Economic And Biological Impacts Of Aquatic Animal Pathogens Due To Hatchery-Based Enhancement Of Inland Open-Water Systems, And Possibilities For Their Minimisation | publisher=Inland Water Resources and Aquaculture Service | work=Primary aquatic animal health care in rural, small-scale, aquaculture | accessdate=August 9, 2014 |author1=J. Richard Arthur |author2=Rohana P. Subasinghe }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preferred habitat===
Bowfin prefer vegetated sloughs, lowland rivers and lakes, swamps, backwater areas, and are occasionally found in brackish water. They are well camouflaged, and not easy to spot in slow water with abundant vegetation. They often seek shelter under roots, and submerged logs.&lt;ref name="fishsc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Freshwater Fishes of South Carolina|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fVZHbQ7eJLQC&amp;pg=PA80|year=2009|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-680-4|page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MillerRobison2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rudolph John Miller|author2=Henry W.

==Life cycle==
Bowfin spawn in the spring or early summer, typically between April and June, more commonly at night&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fishsc"/&gt; in abundantly vegetated, clear shallow water in weed beds over sand bars, and also under stumps, logs, and bushes.&lt;ref name="Bonner"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G3__cpgkqVoC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23&amp;dq=Timothy+Bonner+Amia+Calva&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ndejM3AjuG&amp;sig=PB0HsfGqKveeDP7UZYWiYnFSvy0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjhupTNuefUAhVS_WMKHVruDFQQ6AEIRDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=Timothy%20Bonner%20Amia%20Calva&amp;f=false | title=Freshwater Fishes of Texas | publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press | page=23 |ISBN=9781585445707| last=Thomas|first=Chad|last2=Bonner|first2=Timothy|last3=Whiteside|first3=Timothy H. |date=June 18, 2007| accessdate=July 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Optimum temperatures for nesting and spawning range between {{convert|16|-|19|C|F|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt; The males construct circular nests in fibrous root mats, clearing away leaves and stems. Depending on the density of surrounding vegetation there may be a tunnel-like entrance at one side.&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt; The diameter of the nests commonly range between {{convert|39|-|91|cm|in|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt; at a water depth of {{convert|61|-|92|cm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt;

During spawning season, the fins and underside of male bowfin often change in color to a bright lime green.&lt;ref name="DECNY"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/77506.html | title=The Bowfin: New York's Disrespected Living Fossil | publisher=New York Department of Environmental Conservation | accessdate=June 11, 2014 | author=Randy Jackson }}&lt;/ref&gt; The courtship/spawning sequence lasts one to three hours, and can repeat up to five times.&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt; Courtship begins when a female approaches the nest. The ritual consists of intermittent nose bites, nudges, and chasing behavior by the male until the female becomes receptive,&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt; at which time the pair lie side by side in the nest. She deposits her eggs while he shakes his fins in a vibratory movement, and releases his milt for fertilization to occur.&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt; A male often has eggs from more than one female in his nest, and a single female often spawns in several nests.&lt;ref name="ADW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AnimalsJRank"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://animals.jrank.org/pages/1979/Bowfins-Amiiformes.html | title=Bowfins: Amiiformes&amp;nbsp;– Physical Characteristics, Geographic Range, Habitat, Diet, Behavior and Reproduction, Bowfins and People, Conservation Status | publisher=Net Industries | work=Reference for the animal kingdom | date=1979 | accessdate=June 11, 2014 | author=Animals, jrank.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Females vacate the nest after spawning,&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt; leaving the male behind to protect the eggs during the eight to ten days of incubation.&lt;ref name="Schultz2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bonner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berra, Tim M. (2001). ''Freshwater Fish Distribution''. San Diego: Academic Press. {{ISBN|0-12-093156-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A nest may contain 2,000 to 5,000 eggs, possibly more.&lt;ref name="MillerRobison2004"/&gt; [[Fecundity]] is usually related to size of the fish, so it isn't unusual for the roe of a large gravid female to contain over 55,000 eggs.&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fishsc"/&gt; Bowfin eggs are adhesive, and will attach to aquatic vegetation, roots, gravel, and sand.&lt;ref name="Ross2001"/&gt; After hatching, larval bowfin do not swim actively in search of food. During the seven to nine days required for yolk-sac absorption, they attach to vegetation by means of an adhesive organ on their snout, and remain protected by the parent male bowfin.&lt;ref name="MillerRobison2004"/&gt; Bowfin aggressively protect their spawn from the first day of incubation to a month or so after the eggs have hatched.&lt;ref name="MillerRobison2004"/&gt; When the fry are able to swim and forage on their own, they will form a school and leave the nest accompanied by the parent male bowfin who slowly circles them to prevent separation.&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt;

Bowfin reach sexually maturity at two to three years of age.&lt;ref name="fishsc"/&gt; They can live ten to twelve years in the wild,&lt;ref name="fishsc"/&gt; and 30 years in captivity.&lt;ref name="Schultz2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bonner/&gt; Females are longer-lived than males.&lt;ref name=Nicholls/&gt;

==Diseases==
[[File:Lernaea parasite on a Murray cod.jpg|thumb|''Lernaea'', or [[anchor worm]], on a [[Murray cod]]. The same parasite also attacks bowfin.]]
A common [[parasite]] of bowfin is the [[anchor worm]] (''Lernaea''). These small crustaceans infest the skin and bases of fins, with consequences ranging from slowed growth to death.&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt; The mollusk ''[[Unionidae|Megalonaias gigantea]]'' lays eggs in the bowfin gills, that are then externally fertilized by sperm passing in the water flow. The small [[glochidia]] larvae then hatch and develop in the gill tubes.&lt;ref name="FLMNH"/&gt;

Bowfin with [[liver cancer]] and with fatal [[leukemia]] have been reported.&lt;ref name="Stauffer2007"/&gt;

==Utilization==
[[File:Bowfin (Amia calva) (4015394787).jpg|thumb|A man with a freshly caught bowfin]]
As a sport fish, bowfin are not considered desirable to many [[angling|anglers]]. They were once considered a nuisance fish by anglers and early biologists who believed the bowfin's predatory nature was harmful to sport fish populations. As a result, efforts were taken to reduce their numbers.&lt;ref name="NYS"/&gt; Research has since proven otherwise, and that knowledge together with a better understanding of maintaining overall balance of ecosystems, regulations were introduced to help protect and maintain viable populations of bowfin.&lt;ref name=NYS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dec.ny.gov/animals/77506.html|title=The Bowfin, New York's Disrespected Living Fossil|publisher=New York Department of Environmental Conservation|author=Randy Jackson|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowfin are strong fighters, a prized trait in game fish. However, they do have a jaw full of sharp teeth which requires careful handling. The current tackle record is {{convert|21.5|lb|kg|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="StewartWatkinson2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acorn2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="igfa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igfa.org/species/100-bowfin.aspx?CommonName=100-bowfin.aspx|title=Bowfin|publisher=International Game Fish Association|author=IGFA|accessdate=June 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bowfin were once considered to have little commercial value because of its poor-tasting meat which has been referred to as "soft, bland-tasting and of poor texture".&lt;ref name="StewartWatkinson2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Stewart|author2=Douglas Watkinson|title=Freshwater Fishes of Manitoba|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VyzuWkePgtsC&amp;pg=PA51|date=3 May 2004|publisher=Univ. of Manitoba Press|isbn=978-0-88755-374-5|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schultz2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ken Schultz|title=Ken Schultz's Field Guide to Freshwater Fish|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jXkW9mYqP8oC&amp;pg=PA64|date=15 December 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-03987-8|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is considered quite palatable if cleaned properly and [[smoking (food)|smoked]], or prepared fried, [[Blackening (cooking)|blackened]], used in [[Court-bouillon|courtbouillion]], or in fishballs or fishcakes.&lt;ref name="StewartWatkinson2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Acorn2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycomet.com/article/20090405/ARTICLES/904039977?p=2&amp;tc=pg|publisher=Daily Comet|title=Choupique may be a trash fish for some, treasure to others|author=David A.

==Accumulation of toxic substances==
In some areas of the United States where aquatic environments have tested positive for elevated levels of [[toxins]], such as [[Mercury (metal)|mercury]], [[arsenic]], [[chromium]], and [[copper]], there are posted signs with warnings about the consumption of fish caught in those areas.&lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.epa.gov/scitech/swguidance/fishshellfish/fishadvisories/index.cfm|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|title=Fish Consumption Advisories|author=EPA|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concentration of mercury [[biomagnify|biomagnifies]] as it passes up the food chain from organisms on lower trophic levels to apex predators.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17931">'''Brainstem death''' is a clinical syndrome defined by the absence of reflexes with pathways through the [[brainstem]]—the "stalk" of the brain, which connects the [[spinal cord]] to the [[mid-brain]], [[cerebellum]] and [[cerebral hemispheres]]—in a deeply comatose, [[Medical ventilator|ventilator]]-dependent patient.
Identification of this state carries a very grave [[prognosis]] for survival; cessation of [[Cardiac cycle|heartbeat]] often occurs within a few days although it may continue for weeks if intensive support is maintained.&lt;ref name ="AMRC"&gt;A Code of Practice for the Diagnosis and Confirmation of Death. Academy of Medical Royal Colleges, 70 Wimpole Street, London, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the formal diagnosis of brainstem death by the procedure laid down in the official Code of Practice&lt;ref name ="AMRC"/&gt; permits the diagnosis and certification of [[death]] on the premise that a person is dead when consciousness and the ability to breathe are permanently lost, regardless of continuing life in the body and parts of the brain, and that death of the brainstem alone is sufficient to produce this state.&lt;ref name = "Roy"&gt;Criteria for the diagnosis of brain stem death. J Roy Coll Physns of London 1995;29:381–2&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept of brainstem death is also accepted as grounds for pronouncing death for legal purposes in [[India]]&lt;ref&gt;The Transplantation of Human Organs Act, 1994. Act No.42 of 1994. s. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Tissue Transplant Act 2000. s. 19(1)&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere in the world the concept upon which the certification of death on neurological grounds is based is that of permanent cessation of all function in all parts of the brain—[[Brain death|whole brain death]]—with which the British concept should not be confused. The [[United States]]' [[President's Council on Bioethics]] made it clear, for example, in its White Paper of December 2008, that the British concept and clinical criteria are not considered sufficient for the diagnosis of death in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;Controversies in the determination of death. A White Paper by the President's Council on Bioethics, Washington, DC. p 66&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of diagnostic criteria==

The United Kingdom (UK) criteria were first published by the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges (with advice from the Transplant Advisory Panel) in 1976, as prognostic guidelines.&lt;ref name = "CMR1976"&gt;Conference of Medical Royal Colleges and their Faculties in the UK. BMJ 1976;2:1187–8&lt;/ref&gt; They were drafted in response to a perceived need for guidance in the management of deeply comatose patients with severe [[brain damage]] who were being kept alive by [[Mechanical ventilation|mechanical ventilators]] but showing no signs of recovery. The Conference sought "to establish diagnostic criteria of such rigour that on their fulfilment the mechanical ventilator can be switched off, in the secure knowledge that there is no possible chance of recovery". The published criteria—negative responses to bedside tests of some reflexes with pathways through the brainstem and a specified challenge to the brainstem respiratory centre, with caveats about exclusion of [[endocrine]] influences, [[Metabolism|metabolic]] factors and drug effects—were held to be "sufficient to distinguish between those patients who retain the functional capacity to have a chance of even partial recovery and those where no such possibility exists". Recognition of that state required the withdrawal of fruitless further [[Life support|artificial support]] so that death might be allowed to occur, thus "sparing relatives from the further [[emotional trauma]] of sterile hope".&lt;ref name ="CMR1976"/&gt;

In 1979, the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges promulgated its conclusion that identification of the state defined by those same criteria—then thought sufficient for a diagnosis of brain death—"means that the patient is dead"&lt;ref name ="CMJ1979"&gt;Conference of Medical Royal Colleges and their Faculties in the UK. BMJ 1979;1:332.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Death certificate|Death certification]] on those criteria has continued in the United Kingdom (where there is no statutory legal definition of death) since that time, particularly for [[organ transplantation]] purposes, although the conceptual basis for that use has changed.

In 1995, after a review by a Working Group of the [[Royal College of Physicians]] of [[London]], the Conference of Medical Royal Colleges&lt;ref name = "Roy"/&gt; formally adopted the "more correct" term for the syndrome, "brainstem death"—championed by [[Chris Pallis|Pallis]] in a set of 1982 articles in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''&lt;ref name = "Pallis"&gt;Pallis, C. From Brain Death to Brain Stem Death, BMJ, 285, November 1982&lt;/ref&gt;—and advanced a new definition of human death as the basis for equating this syndrome with the death of the person. The suggested new definition of death was the "irreversible loss of the capacity for consciousness, combined with irreversible loss of the capacity to breathe".  It was stated that the irreversible cessation of brainstem function will produce this state and "therefore brainstem death is equivalent to the death of the individual".&lt;ref name = "Roy"/&gt;

==Diagnosis==

In the UK, the formal rules for the diagnosis of brainstem death have undergone only minor modifications since they were first published&lt;ref name = "CMR1976"/&gt; in 1976. The most recent revision of the UK's Department of Health Code of Practice  governing use of that procedure for the diagnosis of death&lt;ref name ="AMRC"/&gt; reaffirms the preconditions for its consideration. These are:

#There should be no doubt that the patient's condition&amp;nbsp;– deeply comatose, unresponsive and requiring [[artificial ventilation]]—is due to irreversible brain damage of known cause.
#There should be no evidence that this state is due to [[depressant]] drugs.
#Primary [[hypothermia]] as the cause of unconsciousness must have been excluded, and
#Potentially reversible circulatory, metabolic and endocrine disturbances likewise.
#Potentially reversible causes of [[apnoea]] (dependence on the ventilator), such as [[muscle relaxant]]s and cervical cord injury, must be excluded.

With these pre-conditions satisfied, the definitive criteria are:

#Fixed pupils which do not respond to sharp changes in the intensity of [[incident light]].
#No [[corneal reflex]].
#Absent [[oculovestibular reflex]]es&amp;nbsp;– no eye movements following the slow injection of at least 50ml of ice-cold water into each ear in turn (the [[caloric reflex test]]).
#No response to supraorbital pressure.
#No [[cough reflex]] to bronchial stimulation or gagging response to pharyngeal stimulation.
#No observed respiratory effort in response to disconnection of the ventilator for long enough (typically 5 minutes) to ensure elevation of the arterial partial pressure of [[carbon dioxide]] to at least 6.0 kPa (6.5 kPa in patients with chronic carbon dioxide retention). Adequate [[Oxygenation (medicine)|oxygenation]] is ensured by pre-oxygenation and diffusion oxygenation during the disconnection (so the brainstem respiratory centre is not challenged by the ultimate, anoxic, drive stimulus). This test—the apnoea test—is dangerous&amp;nbsp;– and may prove lethal.&lt;ref name ="Coimbra87"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coimbra CG. The apnea test&amp;nbsp;– a bedside lethal 'disaster' to avoid a legal 'disaster' in the operating room. In Finis Vitae&amp;nbsp;– is brain death still life? pp.113–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Saposnik G et al. Problems associated with the apnea test in the diagnosis of brain death. Neurology India 2004;52:342–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yingying S et al. Diagnosis of brain death : confirmatory tests after clinical test. Chin Med J 2014;127:1272–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Two doctors, of specified status and experience, are required to act together to diagnose death on these criteria and the tests must be repeated after "a short period of time ... to allow return of the patient's [[arterial blood gas]]es and baseline parameters to the pre-test state". These criteria for the diagnosis of death are not applicable to infants below the age of two months.

==Prognosis and management==

With due regard for the cause of the coma, and the rapidity of its onset, testing for the purpose of diagnosing death on brainstem death grounds may be delayed beyond the stage where brainstem reflexes may be absent only temporarily&amp;nbsp;– because the [[cerebral blood flow]] is inadequate to support synaptic function although there is still sufficient blood flow to keep [[brain cell]]s alive &lt;ref name ="Coimbra87"&gt;Coimbra CG. Implications of ischemic penumbra for the diagnosis of brain death. Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research 1999;32:1479–87&lt;/ref&gt; and capable of recovery. There has recently been renewed interest in the possibility of neuronal protection during this phase by use of moderate hypothermia and by correction of the [[neuroendocrine]] abnormalities commonly seen in this early stage.&lt;ref&gt;Coimbra CG. Are 'brain dead' (or 'brain stem dead') patients neurologically recoverable? In Finis Vitae—'brain death' is not true death. Eds. De Mattei R, Byrne PA. Life Guardian Foundation, Oregon, Ohio, 2009, pp. 313–378&lt;/ref&gt;

Published studies of patients meeting the criteria for brainstem death or whole brain death&amp;nbsp;– the American standard which includes brainstem death diagnosed by similar means&amp;nbsp;– record that even if ventilation is continued after diagnosis, the heart stops beating within only a few hours or days.&lt;ref&gt;Pallis C, Harley DH. ABC of brain stem death. BMJ Publishing Group, 1996, p.30&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been some very long-term survivals&lt;ref&gt;Shewmon DA. 'Brain body' disconnection : implications for the theoretical basis of 'brain death'. In Finis Vitae&amp;nbsp;– is brain death still life? Ed. De Mattei R. Consiglio Nazionale delle Richerche. Rubbettino, 2006, pp. 211–250&lt;/ref&gt; and it is noteworthy that expert management can maintain the bodily functions of [[pregnant]] brain dead women for long enough to bring them to term.&lt;ref&gt;Powner DJ, Bernstein IM. Extended somatic support for pregnant women after brain death. Crit Care Med 2003;31:1241–49&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

The diagnostic criteria were originally published for the purpose of identifying a clinical state associated with a fatal prognosis (see above). The change of use, in the UK, to criteria for the diagnosis of death itself was protested from the first.&lt;ref name ="Evans-C"&gt;Evans DW, Lum LC. Cardiac transplantation. Lancet 1980;1:933–4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans DW, Lum LC. Brain death. Lancet 1980;2:1022&lt;/ref&gt; The initial basis for the change of use was the claim that satisfaction of the criteria sufficed for the diagnosis of the death of the brain as a whole, despite the persistence of demonstrable activity in parts of the brain.&lt;ref name="Beyond brain death"&gt;Evans DW. The demise of 'brain death' in Britain. In Beyond brain death—the case against brain based criteria for human death. Eds. Potts M, Byrne PA, Nilges RG. Kluwer Academic Publishers, 2006, pp. 139–158
&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, that claim was abandoned&lt;ref name =CMJ1979/&gt; and the diagnosis of death (acceptable for legal purposes in the UK in the context of organ procurement for transplantation) by the specified testing of brainstem functions was based on a new definition of death, viz. the permanent loss of the capacity for consciousness and spontaneous breathing. There are doubts that this concept is generally understood and accepted and that the specified testing is stringent enough to determine that state. It is, however, associated with substantial risk of exacerbating the brain damage and even causing the death of the apparently dying patient so tested (see "the apnoea test" above). This raises ethical problems which seem not to have been addressed.
 
It has been argued that sound scientific support is lacking for the claim that the specified purely bedside tests have the power to diagnose true and total death of the brainstem, the necessary condition for the assumption of permanent loss of the intrinsically untestable consciousness-arousal function of those elements of the [[reticular formation]] which lie within the brainstem (there are elements also within the higher brain).&lt;ref name="Beyond brain death"/&gt; Knowledge of this arousal system is based upon the findings from animal experiments&lt;ref name ="Moruzzi73"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ward AA. The relationship between the bulbar-reticular suppressor region and the EEG. Clin Neurophysiol 1949;1:120&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsley DB et al. Effect upon the EEG of acute injury to the brain stem activating system. EEG Clin Neurophysiol 1949;1:475–8627&lt;/ref&gt; as illuminated by pathological studies in humans.&lt;ref name ="Parvizi"&gt;Parvizi J, Damasio AR. Neuroanatomical correlates of brainstem coma. Brain 2003;126:1524–36&lt;/ref&gt; The current neurological consensus is that the arousal of consciousness depends upon reticular components which reside in the midbrain, [[diencephalon]] and [[pons]].&lt;ref&gt;Textbook of clinical neurology, 2nd Edn. Ed. Goetz CG. Elsevier Science, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bleck TP. In Textbook of clinical neurology, 3rd Edn. Ed. Goetz CG. Elsevier Science, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the midbrain reticular formation may be viewed as a driving centre for the higher structures, loss of which produces a state in which the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] appears, on the basis of electroencephalographic (EEG) studies, to be awaiting the command or ability to function. The role of diencephalic (higher brain) involvement is stated to be uncertain and we are reminded that the arousal system is best regarded as a physiological rather than a precise anatomical entity. There should, perhaps, also be a caveat about possible arousal mechanisms involving the first and second [[cranial nerve]]s (serving sight and smell) which are not tested when diagnosing brainstem death but which were described in cats in 1935 and 1938.&lt;ref name ="Moruzzi73"&gt;G, Magoun HW. Brain stem reticular formation and activation of the EEG. Electroencephalog Clin neurophysiol 1949;1:455–73&lt;/ref&gt; In humans, light flashes have been observed to disturb the sleep-like EEG activity persisting after the loss of all brainstem reflexes and of spontaneous respiration.&lt;ref&gt;Zwarts MJ, Kornips FHM. Clinical brainstem death with preserved electroencephalographic activity and visual evoked response. Arch Neurol 2001;58:1010&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also concern about the permanence of consciousness loss, based on studies in cats, dogs and monkeys which recovered consciousness days or weeks after being rendered comatose by brainstem ablation and on human studies of [[brainstem stroke syndrome]] raising thoughts about the "plasticity" of the nervous system.&lt;ref name ="Parvizi"/&gt; Other theories of consciousness place more stress on the thalamocortical system.&lt;ref&gt;Tononi G. An information integration theory of consciousness. BMC Neuroscience 2004;5:42&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most objective statement to be made is that consciousness is not currently understood. That being so, proper caution must be exercised in accepting a diagnosis of its permanent loss before all cerebral blood flow has permanently ceased.

The ability to breathe spontaneously depends upon functioning elements in the [[Medulla oblongata|medulla]]&amp;nbsp;– the 'respiratory centre'. In the UK, establishing a neurological diagnosis of death involves challenging this centre with the strong stimulus offered by an unusually high concentration of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, but it is not challenged by the more powerful drive stimulus provided by [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]]&amp;nbsp;– although the effect of that ultimate stimulus is sometimes seen after final disconnection of the ventilator in the form of [[Agonal respiration|agonal gasps]].

No testing of testable brain stem functions such as oesophageal and cardiovascular regulation is specified in the UK Code of Practice for the diagnosis of death on neurological grounds. There is published evidence&lt;ref&gt;Hall GM et al. Hypothalamic-pituitary function in the 'brain dead' patient. Lancet 1980;2:1259&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wetzel RC et al. Hemodynamic responses in brain dead organ donor patients. Anesthesia and Analgesia 1985;64:125–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pennefather SH, Dark JH, Bullock RE. Haemodynamic responses to surgery in brain-dead organ donors. Anaesthesia 1993;48:1034–38&lt;/ref&gt; strongly suggestive of the persistence of brainstem [[blood pressure]] control in [[Organ donation|organ donors]].

A small minority of medical practitioners working in the UK have argued that neither requirement of the UK Health Department's Code of Practice basis for the equation of brainstem death with death is satisfied by its current diagnostic protocol&lt;ref name ="AMRC"/&gt; and that in terms of its ability to diagnose de facto brainstem death it falls far short.

'''Charlotte Napoléone Bonaparte''' (31 October 1802 – 2 March 1839) was the daughter of [[Joseph Bonaparte]], the older brother of Emperor [[Napoleon I]], and [[Julie Clary]]. Her mother was the sister of [[Désirée Clary]], Napoleon's first love. Charlotte [[Cousin marriage|married her first cousin]] [[Napoleon Louis Bonaparte|Napoleon Louis]], the second son of [[Louis Bonaparte]] and [[Hortense de Beauharnais]]. She studied engraving and lithography in Paris with the artist [[Louis Léopold Robert]], who is reputed to have fallen in love with her.

==Early life==
After her father was deposed in 1813 he moved to America and purchased "Point Breeze", an estate on the [[Delaware River]] near [[Bordentown, New Jersey]]. His palatial house was filled with paintings and sculpture by such luminaries as [[Jacques-Louis David]], [[Antonio Canova]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and [[Titian]] (Tiziano Vecelli). The surrounding park of {{convert|1800|acre|km2}} included landscaped gardens. Joseph Bonaparte played host to many of the national’s wealthiest and most cultivated citizens, and his art collection played a crucial role in transmitting high European taste to America.

==Artist==
Charlotte, known as the Countess de Survilliers, lived with her father in New Jersey from December 1821 to August 1824. While there she sketched numerous landscapes including Passaic Falls, her father's "Point Breeze" estate, the town of [[Lebanon, New Jersey]], and others, some of which were engraved for the book "Picturesque American Scenes" by Joubert. Extant landscape drawings by her include [[Great Falls (Passaic River)|Passaic Falls]], a view near [[Tuckerton, New Jersey]], and [[Schooley's Mountain]]. She also painted portraits (Cora Monges, 1822; Emilie Lacoste, 1823) and exhibited her work at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]].

==Portraits==
Charlotte, her sister Zénaide (1801–1854), and their mother were painted by the French artist [[François Gérard]], while their mother was Queen of Spain. Another French artist, the well-known [[Jacques-Louis David]], painted a portrait of the two sisters; it shows them reading a letter from Philadelphia sent by their father.

==Death==
Charlotte reportedly died in childbirth, aged 36.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}
Her tomb is in the Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence, Italy, and it says (paraphrased): Born Oct. 31, 1802, died 1839.

The '''cortical reaction''' is a process initiated during [[fertilisation|fertilization]] by the release of [[cortical granule]]s from the egg, which prevents [[polyspermy]], the fusion of multiple sperm with one egg. In contrast to the [[Polyspermy#Fast block of polyspermy|fast block of polyspermy]] which immediately but temporarily blocks additional sperm from fertilizing the egg, the cortical reaction gradually establishes a permanent barrier to sperm entry and functions as the main part of the [[Polyspermy#Slow block of polyspermy|slow block of polyspermy]] in many animals.

To create this barrier [[cortical granule]]s, specialized [[Vesicle (biology)#Secretory vesicles|secretory vesicles]] located within the egg's [[cell cortex|cortex]] (the region directly below the plasma membrane), are fused with the egg's plasma membrane, causing the contents of the cortical granules to be released outside the cell where they modify an existing extracellular matrix to make it impenetrable to sperm entry. The cortical granules contain [[proteases]] that clip perivitelline tether proteins, [[peroxidases]] that harden the vitelline envelope, and [[glycosaminoglycans]] that attract water into the perivitelline space, causing it to expand and form the [[hyaline layer]]. The trigger for the cortical granules to [[Exocytosis|exocytose]] is the release of calcium ions from cortical [[smooth endoplasmic reticulum]] in response to sperm binding to the egg.

In most animals, the extracellular matrix present around the egg is the [[Vitelline membrane|vitelline envelope]] which becomes the fertilization membrane following the cortical reaction. In mammals, however, the extracellular matrix modified by the cortical reaction is the [[zona pellucida]]. This modification of the zona pellucida is known as the zona reaction. Although highly conserved across the animal kingdom, the cortical reaction shows great diversity between species. While much has been learned about the identity and function of the contents of the cortical granules in the highly accessible sea urchin, little is known about the contents of cortical granules in mammals.

The cortical reaction within the egg is analogous to the [[acrosomal reaction]] within the sperm, where the acrosome, a specialized secretory vesicle that is homologous to cortical granules, is fused with the plasma membrane of the sperm cell to release its contents which degrade the egg's tough coating and allow the sperm to bind to and fuse with the egg.

==Echinoderms==
In the well-studied [[sea urchin]] model system, the granule contents modify a protein coat on the outside of the plasma membrane (the vitelline layer) so that it is released from the membrane. The released cortical granule proteins exert a [[colloid]] [[osmotic pressure]] causing water to enter the space between the plasma membrane and the vitelline layer, and the vitelline layer expands away from the egg surface. This is easily visible through a microscope and is known as "elevation of the fertilization envelope". Some of the former granule contents adhere to the fertilization envelope, and it is extensively modified and cross-linked. As the fertilization envelope elevates, non-fertilizing sperm are lifted away from the egg plasma membrane, and as they are not able to pass through the fertilization envelope, they are prevented from entering the egg. Therefore, the cortical reaction prevents [[polyspermy|polyspermic]] fertilization, a lethal event. Another cortical granule component, polysaccharide-rich hyalin, remains adherent to the outer surface of the plasma membrane, and becomes part of the hyaline layer.

==Mammals==
Although various mammals have been studied, mice represent the best studied animal models for understanding the cortical reaction in mammals. In mammals the cortical reaction leads to a modification of the [[zona pellucida]] that blocks polyspermy; enzymes released by cortical granules digest sperm receptor glycoproteins ZP2 and ZP3 so that they can no longer bind spermatozoon.

'''Day-care sex-abuse hysteria''' was a [[moral panic]] that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against [[day care|day-care]] providers of several forms of [[child abuse]], including [[Satanic ritual abuse]].&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=L |last=Miller |authorlink= |title=Parole Board recommends Amirault's commutation |url=http://www.truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |quote=The Amiraults always insisted they were innocent, the victims of a sex-abuse hysteria that swept the country in the 1980s and questionable testimony from child witnesses. |agency=Associated Press |date=2001-07-06 |accessdate=2007-10-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071104063907/http://truthinjustice.org/amirault.htm |archivedate=2007-11-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A prominent case in [[Kern County, California]] first brought the issue of day-care sexual abuse to the forefront of the public awareness, and the issue figured prominently in news coverage for almost a decade. The Kern County case was followed by cases elsewhere in the United States as well as Canada, New Zealand, Brazil, and various European countries.

==Causes==

===Anxiety===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, more and more mothers were working outside of the home, resulting in the opening of large numbers of day-care centers. Anxiety and guilt over leaving young children with strangers may have created a climate of fear and readiness to believe false accusations.&lt;ref name=Peggy/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pendergrast |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |title=Victims of Memory: Sex Abuse Accusations and Shattered Lives |publisher= |quote='It seems [the day-care sex- abuse hysteria] had something to do with this fear that we'd turned our kids over to total strangers,' sociologist Catherine Beckett says ... |isbn=978-0-942679-18-2|year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suggestions and false allegations when interviewing children===
{{synthesis|section|talksection=Synthesis in discussion of causes|date=November 2016}}

Children are vulnerable to outside influences that lead to fabrication of testimony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carter |first=Sherrie Bourg |title=Children in the Courtroom |year=2005 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their testimony can be influenced in a variety of ways.
Maggie Bruck in her article published by the [[American Psychological Association]] wrote that children incorporate aspects of the interviewer's questions into their answers in an attempt to tell the interviewer what the child believes is being sought.&lt;ref name="ceci"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies also show that when adults ask children questions that do not make sense (such as "is milk bigger than water?" or "is red heavier than yellow?"), most children will offer an answer, believing that there is an answer to be given, rather than understand the absurdity of the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McGough |first=Lucy S. |title=Child Witnesses: Fragile Voices in the American Legal System |year=1994 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, repeated questioning of children causes them to change their answers. This is because the children perceive the repeated questioning as a sign that they did not give the "correct" answer previously.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=79–81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are also especially susceptible to leading and [[suggestive question]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that only a small percentage of children produce fictitious reports of sexual abuse on their own.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, D. P. H., and J. M. McGraw: Reliable and Fictitious Accounts of Sexual Abuse to Children. Journal of Interpersonal Violence, 2, 27–45, 1987 {{doi|10.1177/088626087002001002}} [http://jiv.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/2/1/27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oates, R. K., D.P. Jones, D. Denson, A.

W. Boat: False Allegations of Sexual Abuse by Children and Adolescents. Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, 28, 230–35, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Interviewer bias also plays a role in shaping child testimony. When an interviewer has a preconceived notion as to the truth of the matter being investigated, the questioning is conducted in a manner to extract statements that support these beliefs.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; As a result, evidence that could disprove the belief is never sought by the interviewer. Additionally, positive reinforcement by the interviewer can taint child testimony. Often such reinforcement is given to encourage a spirit of cooperation by the child, but the impartial tone can quickly disappear as the interviewer nods, smiles, or offers verbal encouragement to "helpful" statements.&lt;ref name = "Ceci79"/&gt; Some studies show that when interviewers make reassuring statements to child witnesses, the children are more likely to fabricate stories of past events that never occurred.&lt;ref name="ceci140"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peer pressure also influences children to fabricate stories. Studies show that when a child witness is told that his or her friends have already testified that certain events occurred, the child witness was more likely to create a matching story.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|pp=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The status of the interviewer can also influence a child's testimony, because the more authority an interviewer has such as a police officer, the more likely a child is to comply with that person's agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, while there are supporters of the use of [[anatomically correct doll]]s in questioning victims of sexual abuse/molestation, there are also critics of this practice.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"&gt;{{harvnb|Ceci|Bruck|1996|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics say that because of the novelty of the dolls, children will act out sexually explicit acts with the dolls even if the child has not been sexually abused.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt; Another criticism is that because the studies that compare the differences between how abused and non-abused children play with these dolls are conflicting (some studies suggest that sexually abused children play with anatomically correct dolls in a more sexually explicit manner than non-abused children, while other studies suggest that there is no correlation), it is impossible to interpret what is meant by how a child plays with these dolls.&lt;ref name ="Ceci162"/&gt;

==Significant cases==

===McMartin Preschool===
{{Main|McMartin preschool trial}}

The McMartin Preschool case was the first daycare abuse case to receive major media attention in the United States.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case centered upon the McMartin Preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], where seven teachers were accused of kidnapping children, flying them in a plane to another location, and forcing them to engage in group sex as well as forcing them to watch [[Cruelty to animals|animals be tortured and killed]].&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; The case also involved accusations that children had been forced to participate in bizarre religious rituals, and been used to make child pornography.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case began with a single accusation, made by the mother - who was later found to be a paranoid schizophrenic&lt;ref name=Peggy&gt;{{cite news |first=Margaret |last=Talbot |authorlink= |title=The Lives They Lived: 01-07-01: Peggy McMartin Buckey, b. 1926; The Devil in The Nursery. |url=http://www.newamerica.net/publications/articles/2001/the_devil_in_the_nursery |format=reprint from New America |quote=Buckey's ordeal began in 1983, when the mother of a 2½-year-old who attended the McMartin preschool in [[Manhattan Beach, California|Manhattan Beach]], [[California]], called the police to report that her son had been sodomized there. It didn't matter that the woman was eventually found to be a paranoid schizophrenic, and that the accusations she made – of teachers who took children on airplane rides to Palm Springs and lured them into a labyrinth of underground tunnels where the accused "flew in the air" and others were "all dressed up as witches" ... |publisher=The New York Times |date=January 7, 2001 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; - of one of the students, but grew rapidly when investigators informed parents of the accusation and began interviewing other students.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; The case made headlines nationwide in 1984, and seven teachers were arrested and charged that year.&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt; When a new district attorney took over the case in 1986, however, his office re-examined the evidence and dropped charges against all but two of the original defendants. Their trials became one of the longest and most expensive criminal trials in the history of the United States,&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; but in 1990 all of these charges were also dropped.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Both jurors at the trial and academic researchers later criticized the interviewing techniques that investigators had used in their investigations of the school, alleging that interviewers had "coaxed" children into making unfounded accusations, repeatedly asking children the same questions and offering various incentives until the children reported having been abused.&lt;ref name="CAV"/&gt; Most scholars now agree that the accusations these interviews elicited from children were false.&lt;ref name="Schreiber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Garven"/&gt; Sociologist [[Mary de Young]] and historian [[Philip Jenkins]] have both cited the McMartin case as the prototype for a wave of similar accusations and investigations between 1983 and 1995, which constituted a moral panic.&lt;ref name="de Young"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jenkins"/&gt;

===Country Walk===
In 1985, Frank Fuster – the owner of the Country Walk Babysitting Service in the [[Country Walk, Florida|Country Walk]] suburb of [[Miami|Miami, Florida]] – was found guilty of 14 counts of abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt; He was sentenced to prison with a minimum length of 165 years. Fuster's alleged victims testified that he led them in Satanic rituals and terrorized them by forcing them to watch him mutilate birds, a lesson to children who might reveal the abuse.&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;{{cite news |last=Collins |first=Glen |title=Nightmare in Country Walk |publisher=The New York Times |date=1986-12-14 |quote=Mr. Fuster was convicted of molesting the children entrusted to his wife's care in their home in the middle-class Dade County suburb of Country Walk, a planned development that was intended to be an idyllic refuge from the anxieties of urban Miami. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/books/nightmare-in-country-walk.html?pagewanted=print |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster had been previously convicted for manslaughter and for molesting a 9-year-old child.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Testimony from children in the case was elicited by [[University of Miami]] [[child psychologist]]s Laurie and Joseph Braga, who resorted to coercive questioning of the alleged victims when the desired answers were not forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=De Young, Mary |authorlink=Mary de Young |title=The day care ritual abuse moral panic |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, N.C |year=2004 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=_e8ZkJBtz0EC&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 71] |isbn=978-0-7864-1830-5 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuster's wife recanted her court testimony in an interview with Frontline, saying that she had been kept naked in solitary confinement and subjected to other forms of physical and psychological duress until she had agreed to testify against her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/video.html|title=Did Daddy Do It|publisher=PBS|transcript=Transcript|transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/fuster/etc/script.html|date=April 25, 2002|series=Frontline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In 1984, Bernard Baran worked at the Early Childhood Development Center ('ECDC') as a teacher's aide. The allegations in this case emanate from his contact with pre-school children who were enrolled in this facility. The first family to bring accusations against Mr. Baran was that of Boy A. Previously, the boy's father had filed a complaint with ECDC objecting to Mr. Baran being allowed to work with children because he was a homosexual. On September 12th, 1984, the ECDC Board of Directors discussed Mr. Baran's sexuality and his possible termination. On October 5th, 1984, this family contacted the police to report that Mr. Baran had molested their child."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Video helps clear convict of abuse after 21 years." http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32341725/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/ Associated Press / MSNBC. 2009-08-09. His case had followed a tortured path – the first complaint came from a drug-addicted couple, acting as narcotics informants, who told their police connection they "didn't want no homo" watching their son.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days of the first allegation, ECDC hosted a puppet show and delivered letters to parents notifying them about a child at the day care with [[gonorrhea]]. Five other allegations emerged. Baran was tried in the Berkshire County courthouse 105 days after the first allegation, a swiftness noted in the later court rulings. The courtroom was closed during the children's testimony, which Baran claimed violated his right to a public trial. Baran's defense attorney was later ruled ineffective. Baran was convicted on January 30, 1985, on three counts of rape of a child and five counts of indecent assault and battery. He was sentenced to three life terms plus 8 to 20 years on each charge. He maintained his innocence throughout his case.&lt;ref&gt;Pollitt, Katha. 2000-02-03.

In 2004 hearings began in a motion for a new trial. In 2006, Baran was granted a new trial and released on $50,000 bail. In May 2009, the Massachusetts Appeals Court affirmed the new trial ruling, setting aside the 1985 convictions. The Berkshire County District Attorney's office dismissed the original charges and Baran's record was cleared.&lt;ref&gt;"D.A. Capeless decides not to continue prosecuting Baran." 2009-06-09.

===Oak Hill satanic ritual abuse trial===

Frances Keller and her husband, Dan Keller, both of [[Austin, Texas]], were convicted of sexually abusing a 3-year-old girl in their care, and they spent 21 years in prison until their release in 2013.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-texas-release-idUSBRE9AQ13R20131127|title=Texas frees daycare operator accused of 'satanic' sexual abuse|date=27 November 2013|publisher=|via=Reuters|newspaper=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case began on August 15, 1991, when a 3-year-old girl told her mother that Dan Keller had hurt her. The mother and daughter were on their way to a scheduled appointment with the girl’s therapist, who drew out details that included Keller defecating on her head and sexually assaulting her with a pen. During the time leading up to the trial, two other children from the day care offered similar accusations. According to the children, the couple served blood-laced Kool-Aid and forced them to have videotaped sex with adults and other children. The Kellers, they said, sometimes wore white robes and lit candles before hurting them. The children also accused the Kellers of forcing them to watch or participate in the killing and dismemberment of cats, dogs and a crying baby. Bodies were unearthed in cemeteries and new holes dug to hide freshly killed animals and, once, an adult passer-by was shot and dismembered with a chain saw. The children recalled several plane trips, including one to [[Mexico]], where they were sexually abused by soldiers before returning to [[Austin]] in time to meet their parents at the day care.&lt;ref name="case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/news/local/fran-keller-to-be-freed-in-satanic-abuse-case/nb5S2/|title=Fran Keller to be freed in satanic abuse case|work=statesman.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only physical evidence of abuse in the case was presented by Michael Mouw, an emergency room physician at Brackenridge Hospital who examined the 3-year-old girl in 1991 on the night she first accused Dan Keller of abuse. Mouw testified at the Kellers’ trial that he found two tears in the girl’s hymen consistent with sexual abuse and determined that the injuries were less than 24 hours old. Three years after the trial, while attending a medical seminar, Mouw said a slide presentation on “normal” pediatric hymens included a photo that was identical to what he had observed in the girl.&lt;ref name="case" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html Austin attorneys weigh in on why Kellers were convicted] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205081850/http://www.kvue.com/news/editors-pick/233691871.html |date=2013-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 2013, the [[Travis County]] district attorney's office announced that Fran Keller, now 63, was being released on bond and her husband, Dan Keller, who was convicted at the same time, would be released within a week in a deal reached with lawyers. "There is a reasonable likelihood that (the medical expert's) false testimony affected the judgment of the jury and violated Frances Keller's right to a fair trial," said the district attorney.&lt;ref name="reuters" /&gt;

On June 20, 2017, the Travis County district attorney's office announced that the case against the Kellers had been dismissed, citing actual innocence.

===Wenatchee child abuse prosecutions===
{{Main|Wenatchee child abuse prosecutions}}
In [[Wenatchee, Washington]], in 1994 and 1995, police and state social workers undertook what was then called the nation's most extensive child sex-abuse investigation.&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; Forty-three adults were arrested on 29,726 charges of child sex abuse involving 60 children. Parents, Sunday school teachers and a pastor were charged, and many were convicted of abusing their own children or the children of others in the community. However, prosecutors were unable to provide any physical evidence to support the charges. The main witness was the 13-year-old foster daughter of police officer Robert Perez, who had investigated the cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Timothy |last=Egan |authorlink= |title=Pastor and Wife Are Acquitted on All Charges in Sex-Abuse Case. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/12/us/pastor-and-wife-are-acquitted-on-all-charges-in-sex-abuse-case.html |publisher=The New York Times |date=1995-12-12 |accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A jury found the city of Wenatchee and [[Douglas County, Washington]], negligent in the 1994–1995 investigations.

===Christchurch Civic Crèche===
{{Main|Peter Ellis (childcare worker)}}
[[Peter Ellis (childcare worker)|Peter Ellis]], a child-care worker at the [[Christchurch]] Civic [[Day care|Crèche]] in [[New Zealand]], was found guilty on 16 counts of sexual abuse against children in 1992 and served seven years in jail. Parents of the alleged abuse victims were entitled to claim NZ$10,000 (equivalent to about US$11,000 in 2010) in compensation for each allegation from the [[Accident Compensation Corporation]], regardless of whether the allegations were proved or not. Many victims' families made multiple allegations. Four female co-workers were also arrested on 15 charges of abuse, but were released after these charges were dropped. Together with six other co-workers who lost their jobs when the centre was closed, they were awarded $1 million in compensation by the Employment Court in 1995, although this sum was reduced on appeal. Peter Ellis has consistently denied any abuse, and the case is still considered controversial by many New Zealanders.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite news|title=Government to reconsider Peter Ellis case |publisher=The Press |date=15 December 2008 |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130113102452/http://www.stuff.co.nz/thepress/4793550a6009.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martensville satanic sex scandal===
{{Main|Martensville satanic sex scandal}}
In 1992, a mother in the central [[Saskatchewan]] city of [[Martensville]], alleged that a local woman who ran a babysitting service and day care center in her home had sexually abused her child. Police began an investigation, leading to a sharp increase in allegations. More than a dozen persons, including five police officers from two different forces, ultimately faced over 100 charges connected with running a Satanic cult called The Brotherhood of The Ram, which allegedly practiced ritualized sexual abuse of numerous children at a "Devil Church".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Satanic Sex Scandal |url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/martin/scandal.html |quote=The nightmare that descended on Martensville, Saskatchewan began when a local mother had some grave suspicions.

* During the 1980s a series of highly publicized “daycare ritual abuse cases” erupted in communities across the United States and Europe. The cases typically involved allegations by preschool children that they had been terrorized and sexually abused by day-care workers in bizarre scenarios with Satanic or ritualistic overtones. Some scholars continue to take the view that these cases were genuine and involved actual ritual abuse (Faller, 1996; Summit, 1994). However, skepticism has become widespread among research psychologists. An extensive body of research, arising in the wake of the day-care cases of the 1980s, has identified a variety of interviewing techniques that can induce children to make false reports.

* "The McMartin affair was followed by dozens of comparable cases in all parts of the country, all involving bizarre or ritualistic methods of abuse and all sharing similar backgrounds.  Whether in Bakersfield (California), Jordan (Minnesota), Edenton, (North Carolina), Martensville (Canada) or Wenatchee (Washington), the affair generally began with a limited, plausible allegation... in the ensuing investigation, interrogation of child "victims" produced evidence that far more abuse had occurred than originally thought, and ultimately the compounding reports and rumors would implicate dozens of local residents in what could only be called sex rings or cults.  Supposed victims were questioned, until they confirmed the charges and offered their own creative embellishments."
* "Most day care and preschool prosecutions resulted in either the acquittal of the accused or the conviction of some individuals on counts that involved neither satanic nor ritualistic elements. Even these convictions were often overturned when appeals courts examined the means by which testimony had been elicited from children."

* "In the 1980s and early 1990s the United States witnessed an epidemic of what some commentators have called 'Satanic panic' ... contributing to the panic was a national outbreak of so-called 'daycare abuse' cases, in which groups of young children alleged that they had been sexually abused by their caretakers and forced to participate in bizarre ceremonies with satanic overtones.  Many social scientists, scholars, and legal authorities now view the stories of Satanic conspiracy that circulated in the 1980s as urban legends, and the daycare abuse cases as historical aberrations... Psychological researchers have taken a special interest in the interviewing techniques in these cases, which apparently induced children to make false accusations."&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides an anonymised summary of the experts' forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, experts are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of their panel. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the "correct" answer. Finally, the process is stopped after a predefined stop criterion (e.g., number of rounds, achievement of consensus, stability of results), and the [[mean]] or [[median]] scores of the final rounds determine the results.&lt;ref name="rw1999"&gt;Rowe and Wright (1999): The Delphi technique as a forecasting tool: issues and analysis.

Delphi is based on the principle that forecasts (or decisions) from a structured group of individuals are more accurate than those from unstructured groups.&lt;ref name="rw2001"&gt;Rowe and Wright (2001): Expert Opinions in Forecasting. Role of the Delphi Technique. In: Armstrong (Ed.): ''Principles of Forecasting: A Handbook of Researchers and Practitioners'', Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique can also be adapted for use in face-to-face meetings, and is then called mini-Delphi or Estimate-Talk-Estimate (ETE). Delphi has been widely used for business forecasting and has certain advantages over another structured forecasting approach, [[prediction markets]].&lt;ref name="kag" /&gt;

==History==
The name "Delphi" derives from the [[Oracle of Delphi]], although the authors of the method were unhappy with the oracular connotation of the name, "smacking a little of the occult".&lt;ref name="Adler"&gt;Adler, Michael &amp; Erio Ziglio (1996) ''Gazing Into the Oracle: The Delphi Method and Its Application to Social Policy and Public Health'', (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, 1996). ([https://books.google.com/books?id=jo1Z1JZIrKIC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;lpg=PA5&amp;dq=delphi+method+%22something+oracular,+something+smacking+a+little+of+the+occult%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CPxZEGMbdT&amp;sig=VE3UTLHWtTD1w09yWE3bZI4oUuk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAmoVChMI7bzWr9TxxgIVzJQNCh04oAA8#v=onepage&amp;q=delphi%20method%20%22something%20oracular%2C%20something%20smacking%20a%20little%20of%20the%20occult%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false])&lt;/ref&gt; The Delphi method is based on the assumption that group judgments are more valid than individual judgments.

The Delphi method was developed at the beginning of the [[Cold War]] to forecast the impact of technology on [[war]]fare.&lt;ref name=Randwork&gt;"JVTE v15n2: The Modified Delphi Technique - A Rotational Modification," ''Journal of Vocational and Technical Education'', Volume 15 Number 2, Spring 1999, web: [http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JVTE/v15n2/custer.html VT-edu-JVTE-v15n2]: of Delphi Technique developed by Olaf Helmer and Norman Dalkey.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, [[Henry H. Arnold|General Henry H. Arnold]] ordered the creation of the report for the [[U.S. Army Air Corps]] on the future technological capabilities that might be used by the military.

Different approaches were tried, but the shortcomings of traditional [[technology forecasting|forecasting]] methods, such as [[theoretical approach]], [[quantitative model]]s or trend extrapolation, quickly became apparent in areas where precise scientific laws have not been established yet. To combat these shortcomings, the Delphi method was developed by [[Project RAND]] during the 1950-1960s (1959) by [[Olaf Helmer]], Norman Dalkey, and [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref name="r1999"&gt;Rescher(1998): ''Predicting the Future'', (Albany, NY: State University of New York Press, 1998).  ([http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P3558/], [http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM5888], [http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P1513/])&lt;/ref&gt; It has been used ever since, together with various modifications and reformulations, such as the [[David Passig#Imen Delphi|Imen-Delphi]] procedure.&lt;ref&gt;Passig, David (1997) "Imen Delphi: A Delphi Variant Procedure for Emergence". ''Human Organization: Journal of the Society for Applied Anthropology'', Southern Methodist University. Dallas, TX. Spring, 56(1), 53-63&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts were asked to give their opinion on the probability, frequency, and intensity of possible enemy attacks. Other experts could anonymously give feedback. This process was repeated several times until a consensus emerged.

==Key characteristics==
[[File:DELPHIST.png|thumb|right|''The Delphi Method communication structure'']] 
The following key characteristics of the Delphi method help the participants to focus on the issues at hand and separate Delphi from other methodologies: in this technique a panel of experts is drawn from both inside and outside the organisation. The panel consist of experts having knowledge of the area requiring decision making.  Each expert is asked to make anonymous predictions.

===Anonymity of the participants===
Usually all participants remain anonymous. Their identity is not revealed, even after the completion of the final report. This prevents the authority, personality, or reputation of some participants from dominating others in the process. Arguably, it also frees participants (to some extent) from their personal biases, minimizes the "[[bandwagon effect]]" or "[[halo effect]]", allows free expression of opinions, encourages open critique, and facilitates admission of errors when revising earlier judgments.

=== Structuring of information flow ===
The initial contributions from the experts are collected in the form of answers to questionnaires and their comments to these answers. The panel director controls the interactions among the participants by processing the information and filtering out irrelevant content. This avoids the negative effects of face-to-face panel discussions and solves the usual problems of [[group dynamics]].

===Regular feedback===
The Delphi Method allows participants to comment on the responses of others, the progress of the panel as a whole, and to revise their own forecasts and opinions in real time.

===Role of the facilitator===
The person coordinating the Delphi method is usually known as a ''facilitator'' or Leader, and facilitates the responses of their ''panel of experts'', who are selected for a reason, usually that they hold knowledge on an opinion or view. The facilitator sends out questionnaires, surveys etc. and if the panel of experts accept, they follow instructions and present their views. Responses are collected and analyzed, then common and conflicting viewpoints are identified. If consensus is not reached, the process continues through thesis and antithesis, to gradually work towards synthesis, and building consensus.

==Applications==

===Use in forecasting===
First applications of the Delphi method were in the field of science and technology forecasting. The objective of the method was to combine expert opinions on likelihood and expected development time, of the particular technology, in a single indicator. One of the first such reports, prepared in 1964 by Gordon and Helmer, assessed the direction of long-term trends in science and technology development, covering such topics as scientific breakthroughs, [[population control]], [[automation]], space progress, war prevention and weapon systems. Other forecasts of technology were dealing with vehicle-highway systems, industrial robots, intelligent internet, broadband connections, and technology in education.

Later the Delphi method was applied in other places, especially those related to public policy issues, such as economic trends, health and education. It was also applied successfully and with high accuracy in business forecasting. For example, in one case reported by Basu and Schroeder (1977),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Basu|first=Shankar|author2=Roger G. Schroeder|title=Incorporating Judgments in Sales Forecasts: Application of the Delphi Method at American Hoist &amp; Derrick|journal=Interfaces|date=May 1977|volume=7|issue=3|pages=18–27|doi=10.1287/inte.7.3.18|url=http://interfaces.journal.informs.org/content/7/3/18.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Delphi method predicted the sales of a new product during the first two years with inaccuracy of 3–4% compared with actual sales. Quantitative methods produced errors of 10–15%, and traditional unstructured forecast methods had errors of about 20%. (This is only one example; the overall accuracy of the technique is mixed.)

The Delphi method has also been used as a tool to implement multi-stakeholder approaches for participative policy-making in developing countries. The governments of Latin America and the Caribbean have successfully used the Delphi method as an open-ended public-private sector approach to identify the most urgent challenges for their regional [[ICT-for-development]] [[eLAC Action Plans]].&lt;ref name="HilbertMilesOthmer2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hilbert | first1 = Martin | last2 = Miles | first2 = Ian | last3 = Othmer | first3 = Julia | year = 2009 | title = Foresight tools for participative policy-making in inter-governmental processes in developing countries: Lessons learned from the eLAC Policy Priorities Delphi | url = http://martinhilbert.net/Hilbert_etal.eLACdelphi.pdf | format = PDF | journal = [[Technological Forecasting and Social Change]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 880–896 | doi = 10.1016/j.techfore.2009.01.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, governments have widely acknowledged the value of collective intelligence from civil society, academic and private sector participants of the Delphi, especially in a field of rapid change, such as technology policies.

Use in Patent Participation Identification
In the early 1980s Jackie Awerman of Jackie Awerman Associates, Inc.designed a modified Delphi method for identifying the roles of various contributors to the creation of a patent-eligible product. (Epsilon Corporation, Chemical Vapor Deposition Reactor) The results were then used by patent attorneys to determine bonus distribution percentage to the general satisfaction of all team members.

===Use in policy-making===
From the 1970s, the use of the Delphi technique in public policy-making introduces a number of methodological innovations. In particular:
* the need to examine several types of items (not only ''forecasting'' items but, typically, ''issue'' items, ''goal'' items, and ''option'' items) leads to introducing different evaluation scales which are not used in the standard Delphi. These often include ''desirability'', ''feasibility'' (technical and political) and ''probability'', which the analysts can use to outline different scenarios: the ''desired'' scenario (from desirability), the ''potential'' scenario (from feasibility) and the ''expected'' scenario (from probability);
* the complexity of the issues posed in public policy-making leads to give more importance to the arguments supporting the evaluations of the panelists; so these are often invited to list arguments for and against each option item, and sometimes they are given the possibility to suggest new items to be submitted to the panel;
* for the same reason, the scaling methods, which are used to measure panel evaluations, often include more sophisticated approaches such as multi-dimensional scaling.

Further innovations come from the use of computer-based (and later web-based) Delphi conferences. According to Turoff and Hiltz,&lt;ref&gt;Murray Turoff, Starr Roxanne Hiltz, "Computer-based Delphi processes", in  Michael Adler, Erio Ziglio (eds.), Gazing Into the Oracle, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; in computer-based Delphis: 
* the iteration structure used in the paper Delphis, which is divided into three or more discrete rounds, can be replaced by a process of continuous (roundless) interaction, enabling panelists to change their evaluations at any time;
* the statistical group response can be updated in real-time, and shown whenever a panelist provides a new evaluation.

According to Bolognini,&lt;ref name="Bolognini"&gt;{{citation

}}, chap. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; web-based Delphis offer two further possibilities, relevant in the context of interactive policy-making and [[e-democracy]]. These are: [[File:HYPERD.GIF|thumb|right|''A web-based communication structure (Hyperdelphi)''.&lt;ref name="Bolognini"/&gt;]]
* the involvement of a large number of participants,
* the use of two or more panels representing different groups (such as policy-makers, experts, citizens), which the administrator can give tasks reflecting their diverse roles and expertise, and make them to interact within ad hoc communication structures. For example, the  ''policy community'' members (policy-makers and experts) may interact as part of the ''main conference'' panel, while they receive inputs from a ''virtual community'' (citizens, associations etc.) involved in a ''side conference''. These web-based variable communication structures, which he calls ''Hyperdelphi'' (HD), are designed to make Delphi conferences "more fluid and adapted to the hypertextual and interactive nature of digital communication".
One successful example of a (partially) web-based policy Delphi is the five-round Delphi exercise (with 1,454 contributions) for the creation of the [[eLAC Action Plans]] in Latin America. It is believed to be the most extensive online participatory policy-making foresight exercise in the history of intergovernmental processes in the developing world at this time.&lt;ref name="HilbertMilesOthmer2009"/&gt; In addition to the specific policy guidance provided, the authors list the following lessons learned include "(1) the potential of Policy Delphi methods to introduce transparency and accountability into public decision-making, especially in developing countries; (2) the utility of foresight exercises to foster multi-agency networking in the development community; (3) the usefulness of embedding foresight exercises into established mechanisms of representative democracy and international multilateralism, such as the United Nations; (4) the potential of online tools to facilitate participation in resource-scarce developing countries; and (5) the resource-efficiency stemming from the scale of international foresight exercises, and therefore its adequacy for resource-scarce regions."&lt;ref name="HilbertMilesOthmer2009"/&gt;

=== Online Delphi systems ===
{{main|Real-time Delphi}}
A number of Delphi forecasts are conducted using web sites that allow the process to be conducted in real-time. For instance, the [[TechCast Project]] uses a panel of 100 experts worldwide to forecast breakthroughs in all fields of science and technology. Another example is the [[Horizon Project]], where educational futurists collaborate online using the Delphi method to come up with the technological advancements to look out for in education for the next few years.

==Variations==
Traditionally the Delphi method has aimed at a consensus of the most probable future by iteration. Other versions, such as the Policy Delphi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Turoff | first1 = Murray | year = | title = The Design of a Policy Delphi | url = http://is.njit.edu/pubs/delphibook/ch3b1.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 2 | issue = 2| page = 1970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is instead a decision support method aiming at structuring and discussing the diverse views of the preferred future. 
In Europe, more recent web-based experiments have used the Delphi method as a communication technique for interactive [[decision-making]] and [[e-democracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}. An example of e-democracy application is DEMOS (Delphi Mediation Online System), whose prototype was presented at the 3rd Worldwide Forum on Electronic Democracy, in 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
The Argument Delphi, was developed by Osmo Kuusi, focuses on ongoing discussion and finding relevant arguments rather than focusing on the output. The Disaggregative Policy Delphi, developed by Petri Tapio, uses cluster analysis as a systematic tool to construct various scenarios of the future in the latest Delphi round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tapio | first1 = P | year = 2003 | title = Disaggregative Policy Delphi: Using cluster analysis as a tool for systematic scenario formation | url = | journal = Technological Forecasting and Social Change | volume = 70 | issue = 1| pages = 83–101 | doi = 10.1016/S0040-1625(01)00177-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The respondent's view on the probable and the preferable future are dealt with as separate cases. The computerization of Argument Delphi is relatively difficult because of several problems like argument resolution, argument aggregation and argument evaluation. The computerization of Argument Delphi, was developed by Sadi Evren Seker, proposes solutions to such problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seker | first1 = Sadi Evren | year = 2015 | title = Computerized Argument Delphi Technique | url =http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=7089162 | journal = IEEE Access | volume = 3 | issue = 2| pages = 368–380 | doi = 10.1109/ACCESS.2015.2424703 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accuracy==
Overall the track record of the Delphi method is mixed. There have been many cases when the method produced poor results. Still, some authors attribute this to poor application of the method and not to the weaknesses of the method itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} It must also be realized that in areas such as science and technology forecasting, the degree of uncertainty is so great that exact and always correct predictions are impossible, so a high degree of error is to be expected.

Another particular weakness of the Delphi method is that future developments are not always predicted correctly by consensus of experts. The issue of ignorance is important. If panelists are misinformed about a topic, the use of Delphi may only add confidence to their ignorance.&lt;ref&gt;Green, K. C., Armstrong, J. S., &amp; Graefe, A. (2007). Methods to elicit forecasts from groups: Delphi and prediction markets compared. Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting, 8, 17–20. [http://qbox.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/mktg/research/Delphi-WPv33.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the initial problems of the method was its inability to make complex forecasts with multiple factors. Potential future outcomes were usually considered as if they had no effect on each other. Later on, several extensions to the Delphi method were developed to address this problem, such as [[cross impact analysis]], that takes into consideration the possibility that the occurrence of one event may change probabilities of other events covered in the survey. Still the Delphi method can be used most successfully in forecasting single scalar indicators.

Despite these shortcomings, today the Delphi method is a widely accepted forecasting tool and has been used successfully for thousands of studies in areas varying from technology forecasting to [[drug abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;The Delphi Method:Techniques and Applications,Harold A. Linstone and Murray Turoff, Editors © 2002, Murray Turoff and Harold Linstone, TOC III.B.3. The National Drug-Abuse Policy Delphi: Progress Report and Findings to Date, IRENE ANNE JILLSON {http://is.njit.edu/pubs/delphibook/ch3b3.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delphi vs. prediction markets===
Delphi has characteristics similar to [[prediction markets]] as both are structured approaches that aggregate diverse opinions from groups. Yet, there are differences that may be decisive for their relative applicability for different problems.&lt;ref name="kag"&gt;Green, Armstrong, and Graefe (2007): Methods to Elicit Forecasts from Groups: Delphi and Prediction Markets Compared. ''[[Foresight: The International Journal of Applied Forecasting]]'' (Fall 2007). [http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/4663/01/MPRA_paper_4663.pdf PDF format][http://ideas.repec.org/a/for/ijafaa/y2007i8p17-20.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some advantages of [[prediction markets]] derive from the possibility to provide incentives for participation.
# They can motivate people to participate over a long period of time and to reveal their true beliefs.
# They aggregate information automatically and instantly incorporate new information in the forecast.
# Participants do not have to be selected and recruited manually by a facilitator. They themselves decide whether to participate if they think their private information is not yet incorporated in the forecast.

Delphi seems to have these advantages over prediction markets:
# Participants reveal their reasoning
# It is easier to maintain confidentiality
# Potentially quicker forecasts if experts are readily available.
# Delphi is applicable in situations where the bets involved might affect the value of the currency used in bets (e.g. a bet on the collapse of the dollar made in dollars might have distorted odds).

'''Deon Dreyer''' (7 August 1974 – 17 December 1994) was a South African recreational [[scuba diving|scuba diver]] who died in [[Bushman's Hole]] in South Africa. Cave diver [[David Shaw (diver)|David Shaw]] died more than 10 years later whilst attempting to retrieve Dreyer's cadaver.

==Life==
Dreyer's father, Theo (who owns a business that sells and services two-way radios) and mother, Marie, raised him in the town of [[Vereeniging]], about 35 miles south of [[Johannesburg]]. Dreyer designed "obscenely loud car stereos", had a passion for diving, and loved adventure, (e.g., hunting, racing a souped-up car, and motorcycling).&lt;ref name="tzimmer"&gt;{{cite news|author=Zimmerman, Tim|work=Outside Magazine|date=August 1, 2005|title=Raising the Dead|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/africa/south-africa/Raising-the-Dead.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Outside Magazine''{{'}}s Tim Zimmerman reports:&lt;blockquote&gt;Deon had logged about 200 dives when he was invited to join some South Africa Cave Diving Association divers at [[Bushman's Hole]] over the 1994 Christmas break. They planned a descent to 492 feet and asked Deon to dive support. He was thrilled. Two weeks before the expedition, Deon's grandfather passed away. Sitting around a barbecue with his family one night, Deon spoke with boyish hubris. "He said if he had a choice of how to go out in life, he'd like to go out diving," recalls his father, Theo, 51.&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Death==
Dreyer drowned on December 17, 1994, aged 20, during a practice dive while helping a team, assembled by [[Nuno Gomes (diver)|Nuno Gomes]], set up conditions for a deep, [[technical diving|technical dive]] scheduled to take place later that week. According to first-hand accounts from those diving with him, Dreyer was lost on ascent around {{convert|50|m|ft}} from the surface. They conjectured he had probably lost consciousness either because of [[oxygen toxicity]] or [[Hypercapnia#During_diving|hypercapnia]] induced by the high work-rate of breathing at depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|work= Australian Story |url= http://www.abc.net.au/austory/content/2005/s1367913.htm |title=To Boldly Go |date=May 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt;

Two weeks after Dreyer's death, Theo hired a small, remotely operated sub used by the [[De Beers]] mining company. It found Dreyer's dive helmet on the [[cenote]] floor, but there was no sign of his body.&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt;

==Commemoration==
Dreyer's parents erected a plaque on a rock wall above the Bushman's Hole entry pool, in memory of their son.&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt; In Phillip Finch's book ''Diving Into Darkness: A True Story of Death and Survival'', it was suggested that one of the reasons Dreyer's death created such an impression on the cave diving community was because of the plaque.  The bodies of most other divers who die, even whilst cave diving, are recovered.  However, for many years it was assumed Dreyer's body would never be recovered from the cave because it was simply too deep, but the plaque was a continual reminder to cave divers that his body lay within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Diving Into Darkness: A True Story of Death and Survival |first=Phillip |last=Finch |isbn=0-312-38394-0 |lccn=2008024271 |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=2008 |pages=113–114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RTgh4Hn3TNgC&amp;pg=PA113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recovery of body==
Ten years later, October 2004, renowned cave diver [[David Shaw (diver)|David Shaw]] discovered Dreyer's body in the cave at a depth of {{convert|270|m|ft}}. On 8 January 2005, Shaw tried to recover the body but died in the attempt. Shaw's close friend and support diver, Don Shirley, also nearly died and was left with permanent damage that has impaired his balance.&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt; On 12 January 2005, while others were recovering part of the technical equipment, they discovered the bodies of both Dreyer and Shaw had floated up close to the surface. Both bodies were recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515/good-guys?act=3|work=This American Life|title=Episode 515: Good Guys, Act 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.npr.org/2014/10/31/360358240/where-no-one-should-go|work=Snap Judgment|title=Where No One Should Go|date=October 31, 2014|publisher=NPR.org|author=Washington, Glynn}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tzimmer" /&gt;

'''Edward Almer''' or '''Aylmer''' (by 1516-1574 or later), of [[Denbigh]] and [[Gresford]], [[Denbighshire]], was a Welsh politician.

He was a younger son of John Almer of Almer, Denbighshire, a sergeant-at-arms at the court of Henry VIII.

He was a [[Justice of the Peace]] for Denbighshire from 1543 to his death and was appointed [[High Sheriff of Denbighshire]] for 1552-53, 1557–58 and 1570-71. He was elected a [[Member of Parliament|Member]] (MP) of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Denbighshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Denbighshire]] in 1555.

He transferred the family seat from Almer to [[Gresford|Pant Iocyn]] (now Pant-yr-Ochain), a house he rebuilt between Gresford and Wrexham using materials salvaged from his previous home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.brunningandprice.co.uk/images/pubs/pant/panthistory.pdf|title = Pant-yr-Ochain: the chief house in Gresford by CHRISTOPHER J.

He married Dorothy, the daughter of Sir George Calverley of Lea, Cheshire and widow of Robert Bostock of Churton, Cheshire. They had 5 sons and 3 daughters. He was succeeded by his eldest son, [[William Almer]], also MP for Denbighshire.

'''Elsa the lioness''' ({{circa}} 28 January 1956{{snd}}24 January 1961) was a female [[lion]] raised along with her sisters "Big One" and "Lustica" by game warden [[George Adamson]] and his wife [[Joy Adamson]] after they were orphaned at only a few weeks old. Though her two sisters eventually went to the [[Netherlands]]' [[Diergaarde Blijdorp|Rotterdam Zoo]], Elsa was trained by the Adamsons to survive on her own, and was eventually released into the wild.

Her story is told in several books by the Adamsons, as well as the 1966 motion picture ''[[Born Free]]''.

== Life ==
Elsa and her sisters were orphaned on 1 February 1956 after George Adamson was forced to kill their mother when she charged him, in defence of her three cubs. George only later realised why the lioness had acted so aggressively towards him. George and his wife Joy then adopted the lioness’s four-day-old cubs.

While Elsa lived in many ways like a domesticated pet when she was small, [[Joy Adamson]], whom Elsa trusted the most, considered her relationship with Elsa to be that of equals. Indeed, after sending the other two to a zoo, Joy was fiercely determined to give Elsa the education she needed to hunt and live in the wild. Her efforts paid off, earning Elsa worldwide fame at the time, when her early life’s story was published in the book ''[[Born Free]]''. When Elsa was three years old, she brought three cubs of her own to show to the Adamsons, whom the Adamsons named “Jespah” (male), “Gop (male), and “Little Elsa” (female). The life of Elsa and her cubs is covered in the book ''[[Living Free]]'', published not long afterwards.

Elsa's died prematurely of a form of [[babesiosis]], a tick-borne blood disease similar to [[malaria]] which often infects the [[Felidae|cat family]]. Elsa’s grave is in the [[Meru National Park]]. She died as local sentiment had begun to turn against Elsa and her cubs, forcing the Adamsons to consider moving them. Elsa’s death made her cubs much more averse to human contact, even with the Adamsons themselves, complicating what would be their eventual capture and release in the [[Serengeti]]. The fate of the cubs upon their release was uncertain, though George Adamson was able to find Little Elsa, healthy and in the company of two other unrelated lions, during 19 months of subsequent searching.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, George. ''A Lifetime With Lions''.  New York:  Avon Books, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the last time that the Adamsons saw any of Elsa's cubs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7731">'''Embodied imagination''' is a therapeutic and creative form of working with [[dream]]s and [[memory|memories]] pioneered by Dutch Jungian psychoanalyst [[Robert Bosnak]]&lt;ref&gt;Bosnak, Robert. (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bosnak, Robert. (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and based on principles first developed by Swiss psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], especially in his work on [[alchemy]],&lt;ref&gt;Jung in Schwartz-Salant, Nathan (Ed.). (1995).&lt;/ref&gt; and on the work of American archetypal psychologist [[James Hillman]], who focused on [[soul]] as a simultaneous multiplicity of autonomous states.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. (1975). pp. 30-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of embodied imagination takes dreaming as the paradigm for all work with images. While dreaming, everyone experiences dreams as embodied events in time and space; that is, the dreamer is convinced that he or she is experiencing a real event in a real environment. Bosnak describes how a dream "instantaneously presents a total world, so real that you are convinced you are awake. You don't just think so, you ''know'' it in the same way you now know you are awake reading this book."&lt;ref&gt;Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  So from the perspective of dreaming, the image is a place.&lt;ref&gt;Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this notion, the dreamer can re-enter the landscape of the dream and flash back into its images to more fully and deeply explore and experience them. The dreamer explores the images of the dream while in a hypnagogic state, a state of consciousness between waking and sleeping. While in this state, the dreamer is asked a series of questions that help him or her to re-experience the dream by describing details of its landscape and image. 

Once fully immersed in the images that the dream environment presents, the dreamer is then also invited to feel and identify the feelings and sensations manifested in the body from a variety of dream perspectives. Perspectives explored are both that of the dream ego as well any "others" that appear in the dream. These "others" may be, for example, another person, an animal, or a physical object. Approaching dream figures in this way is consistent with archetypal psychologist [[James Hillman]]'s prescription for therapeutic work in regard to the phenomena of psychic multiplicity. Drawing upon [[Carl Jung]]'s realization that "the ego complex is not the only complex in the psyche," Hillman described the psyche to be not a singular unified whole defined by the ego point of view, but rather a self-organizing multiplicity of autonomous selves.&lt;ref&gt;Hillman, James. (1975). p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the technique of embodied imagination, for each of these "selves" or "states" representing various perspectives, the dreamer then feels, identifies, and locates the feelings and sensations in his or her body. At the conclusion of the dreamwork session, the dreamer simultaneously holds in conscious awareness these differentiated and complex states of embodied feeling and sensation. The act of holding these multiple disparate states at the same time creates a psychical tension from which a completely new image or feeling state spontaneously emerges from the dreamer's psyche. This new image or state presents a completely new and previously unknown awareness to the dreamer, one through which the dreamer often feels changed, transformed, or greatly expanded in the ability to embody and feel intensely. 

After working with a dream in this way, one dreamer, a woman whose name is Ariel, later reflected, "That dreamwork warded off my seasonal depression which always starts in the autumn. I could already feel it creeping up at the time of the dream. And with the dreamwork it just stopped and retreated and never came back. I didn't have it all winter."&lt;ref&gt;Bosnak, Robert. (2007). p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ariel's transformation is typical of those who practice this method of working with dreams. Using the technique of embodied imagination in [[dreamwork]], the body becomes the theater for a vivid complexity of states, which leads along "alchemical" lines to profound psychical transformation.

==Practice==

Working with both dreams and memories, embodied imagination is practiced individually and in groups in psychotherapy, medicine, theater, art and creative research. The technique has been used as a rehearsal method by the Royal Shakespeare Company in Stratford-upon-Avon and the Bell Shakespeare Company in Sydney. Both its simple rules and emphasis on group participation augment working on the Internet, where this technique is practiced in small dream groups using on-line voice chat forums such as Paltalk.&lt;ref&gt;See the website *[http://www.cyberdreamwork.com ''Cyberdreamwork''] for more information about participating in dreamwork through on-line chat groups.&lt;/ref&gt; A simplified form of Embodied Imagination for creativity is called DreamPlay


==Professional societies==
On November 3, 2006, the International Society for Embodied Imagination was founded at a conference in Guangzhou, China.

'''Ethical egoism'''  is the [[normative ethics|normative ethical]] position that [[Moral agency|moral agent]]s ought to do what is in their own [[self-interest]]. It differs from [[psychological egoism]], which claims that [[people]] can only act in their self-interest. Ethical egoism also differs from [[rational egoism]], which holds that it is [[rationality|rational]] to act in one's self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Steven M. "Is egoism morally defensible?" ''Philosophia''. Springer Netherlands. Volume 18, Numbers 2–3 / July 1988&lt;/ref&gt;
Ethical egoism holds, therefore, that actions whose consequences will benefit the doer can be considered ethical in this sense.

Ethical egoism contrasts with ethical [[altruism (ethics)|altruism]], which holds that moral agents have an [[moral obligation|obligation]] to help others. Egoism and altruism both contrast with ethical [[utilitarianism]], which holds that a moral agent should treat one's [[Philosophy of self|self]] (also known as [[subject (philosophy)|the subject]]) with no higher regard than one has for others (as egoism does, by elevating self-interests and "the self" to a status not granted to others). But it also holds that one should not (as altruism does) sacrifice one's own interests to help others' interests, so long as one's own interests (i.e. one's own [[desire (philosophy)|desires]] or [[Quality of life|well-being]]) are substantially equivalent to the others' interests and well-being. Egoism, utilitarianism, and altruism are all forms of [[consequentialism]], but egoism and altruism contrast with utilitarianism, in that egoism and altruism are both [[Consequentialism#Agent-focused or agent-neutral|agent-focused]] forms of consequentialism (i.e. subject-focused or [[Subjectivity|subjective]]). However, utilitarianism is held to be agent-neutral (i.e. [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and [[Impartiality|impartial]]): it does not treat the subject's (i.e. the self's, i.e. the moral "agent's") own interests as being more or less important than the interests, desires, or well-being of others.

Ethical egoism does not, however, require moral agents to harm the interests and well-being of others when making moral deliberation; e.g. what is in an agent's self-interest may be incidentally detrimental, beneficial, or neutral in its effect on others. [[Individualism]] allows for others' interest and well-being to be disregarded or not, as long as what is chosen is efficacious in satisfying the self-interest of the agent. Nor does ethical egoism necessarily entail that, in pursuing self-interest, one ought always to do what one wants to do; e.g. in the long term, the fulfillment of short-term desires may prove detrimental to [[self (philosophy)|the self]]. Fleeting pleasure, then, takes a back seat to protracted [[eudaimonia]]. In the words of [[James Rachels]], "Ethical egoism ... endorses selfishness, but it doesn't endorse foolishness."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical egoism is often used as the philosophical basis for support of [[right-libertarianism]] and [[individualist anarchism]].&lt;ref name=ridgely&gt;{{Cite web

==Forms==
Ethical egoism can be broadly divided into three categories: individual, personal, and universal. An ''individual ethical egoist'' would hold that all people should do whatever benefits "my" (''the individual'')'' ''self-interest; a ''personal ethical egoist'' would hold that he or she should act in ''his or her'' self-interest, but would make no claims about what anyone else ought to do; a ''universal ethical egoist'' would argue that everyone should act in ways that are in their self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Waller (2005), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ethical egoism was introduced by the philosopher [[Henry Sidgwick]] in his book ''[[The Methods of Ethics]]'', written in 1874. Sidgwick compared egoism to the philosophy of [[utilitarianism]], writing that whereas utilitarianism sought to maximize overall pleasure, egoism focused only on maximizing individual pleasure.&lt;ref name="routledge"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy | chapter = Egoism and Altruism | last = Floridi | first = Luciano | last2 = Craig | first2 = Edward |publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn = 9780415187091|pages=246–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers before Sidgwick have also retroactively been identified as ethical egoists. One ancient example is the philosophy of [[Yang Zhu]] (4th century BC), [[Yangism]], who views ''wei wo'', or "everything for myself", as the only virtue necessary for self-cultivation.&lt;ref name="senghaas"&gt;{{Cite book| title = The clash within civilizations: coming to terms with cultural conflicts | year =2002 | last =Senghaas | first =Dieter |publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | isbn =  978-0-415-26228-6|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek philosophers like Plato, Aristotle and the Stoics were exponents of [[virtue ethics]], and "did not accept the formal principle that whatever the good is, we should seek only our own good, or prefer it to the good of others."&lt;ref name="routledge"/&gt; However, the beliefs of the [[Cyrenaics]] have been referred to as a "form of egoistic hedonism",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/cyren/ Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Cyrenaics]&lt;/ref&gt; and while some refer to Epicurus' hedonism as a form of [[virtue ethics]], others argue his ethics are more properly described as ethical egoism.&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Evans | first = Matthew | title = Can Epicureans be friends? | journal = Ancient Philosophy | volume = 24 | pages = 407–24 | date = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Justifications==
Philosopher [[James Rachels]], in an essay that takes as its title the theory's name, outlines the three arguments most commonly touted in its favor:&lt;ref&gt;He notes, however, that "the theory is asserted more often than it is argued for. Many of its supporters apparently think its truth is self-evident, so that arguments are not needed." (Rachels 2008, p. 534.)&lt;/ref&gt;

*"The first argument," writes Rachels, "has several variations, each suggesting the same general point:&lt;ref&gt;That is, that regarding and pursuing the interests of others is a self-defeating policy. Rachels quotes Alexander Pope in support of this: "Thus God and nature formed the general frame/And bade self-love and social be the same."&lt;/ref&gt;
**"Each of us is intimately familiar with our own individual wants and needs. Moreover, each of us is uniquely placed to pursue those wants and needs effectively. At the same time, we know the desires and needs of others only imperfectly, and we are not well situated to pursue them. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe that if we set out to be 'our brother's keeper,' we would often bungle the job and end up doing more mischief than good."&lt;ref name="Rachels 2008, p. 534"/&gt;
**To give charity to someone is to degrade him, implying as it does that he is reliant on such munificence and quite unable to look out for himself. "That," reckons Rachels, "is why the recipients of 'charity' are so often resentful rather than appreciative."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 534, where it is pointed out that, in the strictest egoistic terms, this is an inconsequential argument. Ethical egoism does not bother itself with how others receive charity, irrespective of how degraded it makes them feel. The same reasoning applies to the previous two bullets, which use self-interest as a means to the end of beneficence, rather than for its own purposes, as the theory would dictate.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Altruism, ultimately, denies an individual's value and is therefore destructive both to society and its individual components, viewing life merely as a thing to be sacrificed. Philosopher [[Ayn Rand]] is quoted as writing that, "[i]f a man accepts the ethics of altruism, his first concern is not how to live his life but how to sacrifice it."&lt;ref&gt;Rachels 2008, p. 535, where this argument is attributed to [[Ayn Rand]], "a writer little heeded by professional philosophers but who nevertheless was enormously popular on college campuses in the 1960s and 1970s".&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, "[t]he basic principle of altruism is that man has no right to exist for his own sake, that service to others is the only justification for his existence, and that self-sacrifice is his highest moral duty, virtue or value." Rather, she writes, "[t]he purpose of morality is to teach you, not to suffer and die, but to enjoy yourself and live."&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, "Faith and Force: Destroyers of the Modern World," ''Philosophy: Who Needs It'', p. 74; ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', 1957, Random House, p. 1014; "Faith and Force," p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
*All of our commonly accepted moral duties, from doing no harm unto others to speaking always the truth to keeping promises, are rooted in the one fundamental principle of self-interest.
*It has been observed, however, that the very act of eating (especially, when there are others starving in the world) is such an act of self-interested discrimination. Ethical egoists such as Rand who readily acknowledge the (conditional) value of others to an individual, and who readily endorse empathy for others, have argued the exact reverse from Rachels, that it is altruism which discriminates: "If the sensation of eating a cake is a value, then why is it an immoral indulgence in your stomach, but a moral goal for you to achieve in the stomach of others?"&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''Atlas Shrugged'', 1957, Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore altruism which is an arbitrary position, according to Rand.

==Criticism==
It has been argued that extreme ethical egoism is self-defeating. Faced with a situation of limited resources, egoists would consume as much of the resource as they could, making the overall situation worse for everybody. Egoists may respond that if the situation becomes worse for everybody, that would include the egoist, so it is not, in fact, in his or her rational self-interest to take things to such extremes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-252577/ethics "Ethics"] ''Britannica''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the (unregulated) [[tragedy of the commons]] and the (one off) [[prisoner's dilemma]] are cases in which, on the one hand, it is rational for an individual to seek to take as much as possible ''even though'' that makes things worse for everybody, and on the other hand, those cases are not self-refuting since that behaviour remains rational ''even though'' it is ultimately self-defeating, i.e. self-defeating does not imply self-refuting. A tragedy of the commons, however, assumes some degree of public land. That is, a commons forbidding homesteading requires regulation. Thus, an argument against the tragedy of the commons is fundamentally an argument for private property rights and the system that recognizes both property rights and rational self-interest—capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Block |first1=Walter |title=Environmentalism and Economic Freedom: The Case for Private Property Rights |journal=[[Journal of Business Ethics]] |volume=17 |issue=16 |pages=18871899 |date=1998 |issn=0167-4544 |jstor=25074025 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, an increasing respect for individual rights uniquely allows for increasing wealth creation and increasing usable resources despite a fixed amount of raw materials (e.g. the West pre-1776 versus post-1776, East versus West Germany, Hong Kong versus mainland China, North versus South Korea, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.juliansimon.org/writings/Ultimate_Resource/ |title= The Ultimate Resource II: People, Materials, and Environment (1996) | author=Julian Simon |accessdate=2014-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not clear how to apply a private ownership model to many examples of "Commons", however. Examples include large fisheries, the atmosphere and the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/July-August%202008/ostrom-full.html " The Challenge of Common-Pool Resources"] ''Environment Magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dummies.com/education/science/environmental-science/ten-real-life-examples-of-the-tragedy-of-the-commons/ "Ten Real-life Examples of the Tragedy of the Commons"] ''Environmental Science for Dummies''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable proponents==
The term ''ethical egoism'' has been applied retroactively to philosophers such as [[Bernard de Mandeville]] and to many other [[Dialectical materialism|materialist]]s of his generation, although none of them declared themselves to be egoists. Note that materialism does not necessarily imply egoism, as indicated by [[Karl Marx]], and the many other [[materialist]]s who espoused forms of [[collectivism]]. It has been argued that ethical egoism can lend itself to [[individualist anarchism]] such as that of [[Benjamin Tucker]], or the combined [[anarcho-communism]] and egoism of [[Emma Goldman]], both of whom were proponents of many egoist ideas put forward by [[Max Stirner]]. In this context, egoism is another way of describing the sense that the common good should be enjoyed by all. However, most notable anarchists in history have been less radical, retaining altruism and a sense of the importance of the individual that is appreciable but does not go as far as egoism. Recent trends to greater appreciation of egoism within [[anarchism]] tend to come from less classical directions such as [[post-left anarchy]] or [[Situationism]] (e.g. [[Raoul Vaneigem]]). Egoism has also been referenced by [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]], such as [[Murray Rothbard]].

Philosopher [[Max Stirner]], in his book ''[[The Ego and Its Own]]'', was the first philosopher to call himself an egoist, though his writing makes clear that he desired not a new idea of morality (ethical egoism), but rather a rejection of morality ([[amoralism]]), as a nonexistent and limiting "spook"; for this, Stirner has been described as the first [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]]. Other philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[David Gauthier]], have argued that the conflicts which arise when people each pursue their own ends can be resolved for the best of each individual only if they all voluntarily forgo some of their aims—that is, one's self-interest is often best pursued by allowing others to pursue their self-interest as well so that liberty is equal among individuals. Sacrificing one's short-term self-interest to maximize one's long-term self-interest is one form of "[[Rational selfishness|rational self-interest]]" which is the idea behind most philosophers' advocacy of ethical egoism. Egoists have also argued that one's actual interests are not immediately obvious, and that the pursuit of self-interest involves more than merely the acquisition of some good, but the ''maximizing'' of one's chances of survival and/or happiness.

Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] suggested that egoistic or "life-affirming" behavior stimulates jealousy or "[[ressentiment]]" in others, and that this is the psychological motive for the altruism in [[Christianity]]. Sociologist [[Helmut Schoeck]] similarly considered [[envy]] the motive of collective efforts by society to reduce the disproportionate gains of successful individuals through moral or legal constraints, with altruism being primary among these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Helmut Schoeck|Schoeck, Helmut]], ''Der Neid. Eine Theorie der Gesellschaft'' (''Envy. A Theory of Social Behaviour''), 1966, 1st English ed. 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Nietzsche (in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'') and [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] (in ''[[After Virtue]]'') have pointed out that the [[ancient Greeks]] did not associate [[morality]] with altruism in the way that post-Christian [[Western culture|Western civilization]] has done.
[[Aristotle]]'s view is that we have duties to ourselves as well as to other people (e.g. friends) and to the ''[[polis]]'' as a whole. The same is true for [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]] and [[Immanuel Kant]], who claim that there are duties to ourselves as Aristotle did, although it has been argued that, for Aristotle, the duty to one's self is primary.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, Jack, "Rand and Aristotle," in Den Uyl and Rasmussen, ''[[The Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand]]'', 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayn Rand]] argued that there is a positive harmony of interests among free, rational humans, such that no moral agent can rationally coerce another person consistently with his own long-term self-interest. Rand argued that other people are an enormous value to an individual's well-being (through education, trade and affection), but also that this value could be fully realized only under conditions of political and economic freedom. According to Rand, voluntary trade alone can assure that human interaction is ''mutually'' beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Rand, Ayn, ''[[The Virtue of Selfishness]]'' (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; Rand's student, [[Leonard Peikoff]] has argued that the identification of one's interests itself is impossible absent the use of principles, and that self-interest cannot be consistently pursued absent a consistent adherence to certain ethical principles.&lt;ref&gt;Peikoff, Leonard, "Why Should One Act on Principle?," ''The Objectivist Forum'', 1988, originally delivered at the [[Ford Hall Forum]].&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Rand's position has also been defended by such writers as [[Tara Smith (philosopher)|Tara Smith]], [[Tibor Machan]], [[Allan Gotthelf]], [[David Kelley]], [[Douglas Rasmussen]], [[Nathaniel Branden]], [[Harry Binswanger]], [[Andrew Bernstein]], and [[Craig Biddle]].

Philosopher [[David L. Norton]] identified himself an "ethical individualist", and, like Rand, saw a harmony between an individual's fidelity to his own self-actualization, or "personal destiny", and the achievement of society's well being.&lt;ref&gt;[[David L. Norton|Norton, David]], ''Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism'', 1976, [[Princeton University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sharksteeth-castlehain.jpg|thumb|Collecting [[Shark tooth|fossilized shark's teeth]] is an easy way to begin collecting fossils. They are often found in abundance on public beaches. The teeth shown here were collected in Castle Hayne, [[North Carolina]], and are from the [[Eocene]] and [[Cretaceous]] divisions.]]
[[File:07PaleoFTb11.JPG|thumb|[[College of Wooster]] students collecting fossils as part of their invertebrate [[paleontology]] course. This is a roadside outcrop of [[Ordovician]] [[limestone]]s and [[shale]]s in southeastern [[Indiana]].]]

'''Fossil collecting''' (some times, in a non-scientific sense, '''fossil hunting''') is the [[Collecting|collection]] of [[fossils]] for scientific study, hobby, or profit. Fossil collecting, as practiced by amateurs, is the predecessor of modern [[paleontology]] and many still collect fossils and study fossils as amateurs. Professionals and amateurs alike collect fossils for their scientific value. A commercial trade in fossils has also long existed, with some of this being practised illegally.

==Process==

===Locating fossils===

====Rock type====
Fossils are generally found in [[sedimentary rock]] with differentiated strata&lt;!--strata is plural of stratum--&gt; representing a succession of deposited material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sdnhm.org/kids/fossils/ffwhere.html | title=Where to look for fossils | publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum | accessdate=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The occurrence of fossil bearing material depends on environmental factors before and after the time of preservation. After death, the first preserving factor is a rapid burial in water bodies or [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] sediment which would help in preserving the specimen. These rocks types are usually termed [[clastic rock]], and are further subdivided into fine, medium and coarse grained material. While fossils can be found in all grain types, more detailed specimens are found in the fine grained material.&lt;ref name=potts2003/&gt; A second type of burial is the non-clastic rock, form where the rock is made up of the precipitation of compacted fossil material, types of rock include [[limestone]] and [[coal]]. The third fossil bearing material is the [[evaporates]], which precipitate out of concentrated dissolved salts to form [[Nodule (geology)|nodular deposit]]s, examples include [[rock salt]] and [[phosphate]] concentrations. The evaporates are usually associated with [[gastropod]], [[algae]], [[vertebrate]], and [[trace fossil]]s. Fossils are not to be found in areas of [[igneous rock]] (except in some beds between lava flows). In rocks which have undergone [[metamorphism]], fossils are generally so distorted that they are difficult to recognize or have been destroyed completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.rasny.org/fossil/NYstrat.htm | title=Stratigraphy Fossil-Bearing Rocks | publisher=The Rochester Academy of Science | accessdate=2007-09-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preservation====
After burial various factors are at work to endanger the current fossil's preserved state. Chemical alteration would change the mineral composition of the fossil, but generally not its appearance, [[lithification]] would distort its appearance, the fossil itself may be fully or partially dissolved leaving only a fossil mold.&lt;ref name=potts2003&gt;{{Cite book|last=Potts |first=Joanna |editor-link=Joanna Potts|year=2003 |title=Guide to Fossils |location=London |publisher=Phillips|pages=31–34pp |isbn=0-540-08374-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How to look for fossils"&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sdnhm.org/kids/fossils/ffmore.html | title=How to look for fossils | publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum | accessdate=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Exposure====
Areas where sedimentary rocks are being eroded include exposed [[mountain]]ous areas, [[river bank]]s and [[river bed|beds]], wave washed sea [[cliff]]s, and engineering features like [[Quarry|quarries]] and [[Cut (earthmoving)|road cuts]]. [[Coal mining]] operations often yield excellent fossil [[plant]]s, but the best ones are to be found not in the [[coal]] itself but in the associated sedimentary rock deposits called [[coal measures]]. 

Wave-washed sea cliffs and foreshore exposures are often good places to search for fossils, but always be aware of the state of the [[tide]]s in the area. Never take chances by climbing high cliffs of crumbling rock or clay (many have died attempting it). Dried up natural lake beds &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/research/cuddie/cuddie.html | title=Dinnertime at Cuddie Springs: hunting and butchering megafauna? | publisher=Judith Furby, School of Archaeology, The University of Sydney, NSW 2006 | accessdate=2007-09-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114003012/http://acl.arts.usyd.edu.au/research/cuddie/cuddie.html |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and caves in the form of [[pitfall trap]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parks.sa.gov.au/naracoorte/caves/index.htm |title=Development of the Naracoorte Caves |publisher=South Australian Parks Web |accessdate=2007-09-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901122951/http://www.parks.sa.gov.au/naracoorte/caves/index.htm |archivedate=2007-09-01 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; frequently also have high concentrations of fossils (e.g., [[Cuddie Springs]] and [[Naracoorte Caves]] in Australia).

Generally in appearance, a fossil will be either a different colour to the surrounding rock, because of the different mineral content, will have a defining shape and texture or a combination of both. A fossil can also be extracted from it's geological environment, having similar characteristics in colour naturally embed from the sedimentary formation (surrounding rock) it was found within.&lt;ref name="How to look for fossils"/&gt;

===Collecting techniques===
The techniques used to collect fossils vary depending on the sediment or rock in which the fossils are to be found. For collecting in rock a [[geological hammer]], a variety of [[Chisel#Cold chisel|cold chisel]]s and a [[mallet]] are used to split and break rocks to reveal fossils. Since the rock is deposited in layers, these layers may be split apart to reveal fossils. For soft [[sediment]]s and unconsolidated deposits, such as sands, [[silt]]s, and clays, a [[spade]], flat-bladed [[trowel]], and stiff [[brushes]] are used. [[Sieve]]s in a variety of [[mesh]] sizes are used to separate fossils from sands and [[gravel]]s. Sieving is a rougher technique for collecting fossils and can destroy fragile ones. Some times, water is run through a sieve to help remove silt and sand. This technique is called '''wet sieving'''

Fossils tend to be very fragile and are generally not extracted entirely from the surrounding rock (the matrix) in the field. Cloth, cotton, small boxes and aluminum foil are frequently used to protect fossils being transported. Occasionally, large fragile specimens may need to be protected and supported using a jacket of [[plaster]] before their removal from the rock. If a fossil is to be left [[in situ]], a cast may be produced, using [[plaster of paris]] or [[latex]]. Whilst not preserving every detail, such a cast is inexpensive, easier to transport, causes less damage to the environment, and leaves the fossil in place for others to enjoy. Fossilized [[Animal tracks|tracks]] are frequently documented with casts. Subtle fossils which are preserved solely as impressions in sandy layers, such as the [[Ediacaran biota|Ediacaran fossils]], are also usually documented by means of a cast, which shows detail more clearly than the rock itself.

Safety is emphasized while fossil collecting and [[hard hat]]s, safety [[goggle]]s, steel toe [[boot]]s, and protective [[glove]]s are used.

===Preparation and cleaning===
Sometimes, for smaller fossils, a stiff brush may simply be used to dust off and clean the fossil. For larger fossils, a chisel can be used to remove large bits of dirt, however, you run the risk of damaging the fossil.
Running water can cause some types of fossils to either dislodge from the rock, or even crumble and break apart, for they are very fragile. Dental tools are sometimes used to remove small amounts of rock from the fossil.

===Documentation===
A knowledge of the precise location a fossil is essential if the fossil is to have any scientific value. Details of the parent rock strata, the location of the find, and other fossil material associated with the find help scientists to place the fossil in context, in terms of the time, location and situation in which the organism lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.sdnhm.org/kids/fossils/ffwhat.html | title=Discover what you have | publisher=San Diego Natural History Museum | accessdate=2007-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data logging|Data logs]], photographs, and sketchs may accompany detailed field notes to assist in the locating of a fossiliferous outcrop. Individual fossils are ideally [[Database catalog|cataloged]] with a locality number and a unique specimen number. This allows a collection to be easily searched and specimens located. Catologing of collections is almost universal in large institutions like [[museums]].

==Collecting ethics==
To collect fossils, there are various legal realities that must be observed. Permission should be sought before collection begins on private land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ology.amnh.org/paleontology/stuff/findfossils_2.html |title=Do's and don'ts for fossil hunters |publisher=American Museum of Natural History |accessdate=2007-09-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810175630/http://ology.amnh.org/paleontology/stuff/findfossils_2.html |archivedate=2007-08-10 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammering the rocks in [[national parks]] and other areas of natural beauty is often discouraged and in most cases is illegal.

The first expressly worded fossil-collecting code was published from the museum-home of pioneering geologist [[Hugh Miller]] at [[Cromarty]], on the Highland east coast of [[Scotland]], 11 April 2008. It was introduced by [[Michael Russell (politician)|Michael Russell]], [[Minister for Environment|Minister for Environment, Scotland]], as part of celebrations honouring the bicentennial of the founding of the [[Geological Society of London]].  The code supplements an existing draft drawn up by [[English Nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english-nature.org.uk/news/statement.asp?Id=13 |title=English nature's code of collecting |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020114135719/http://www.english-nature.org.uk/news/statement.asp?ID=13 |archivedate=January 14, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The code advises fossil collectors to seek permission from landowners, to collect responsibly, record details, seek advice on finding an unusual fossil and label  the specimens and care for them. Its principles establish a framework of advice on best practices in the collection, identification, conservation and storage of fossil specimens.

The non-binding [[Ethical code|code of ethics]] for this field was drawn up by [[Scottish Natural Heritage]] (SNH) following many months of consultation with fossil collectors, landowners, palaeontological researchers, and staff of Scotland's museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geology.com/news/2007/fossil-collectors-code-of-conduct.shtml |title=Geology.com: an early draft of the full code |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070624120211/http://geology.com/news/2007/fossil-collectors-code-of-conduct.shtml |archivedate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil trade===
[[Image:TBataar.jpeg|left|thumb|A ''[[Tarbosaurus]]'' specimen that was illegally smuggled to the US, and subsequently returned to Mongolia]] 
Fossil trading is the practice of buying and selling fossils. This is illegal when it comes to stolen fossils, and some important scientific specimens are sold to collectors, rather than given or obtained by museums and institutes of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fossil-theft-one-of-our-dinosaurs-is-missing-1826931.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Fossil theft: One of our dinosaurs is missing | first=Cahal | last=Milmo | date=2009-11-25 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/fossil-wars.html|title=Fossil Wars|last=Simons|first=Lewis|work=National Geographic|publisher=The [[National Geographic Society]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s532586.htm|title=Fossil Trade|work=Catalyst|date=18 April 2002|author=Willis, Paul|author2=Clark, Tim|author3=Dennis, Carina}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=148688&amp;sectioncode=26|title=Cretaceous crimes that fuel the fossil trade|last=Farrar|first=Steve|date=5 November 1999|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much focus has been put on the illegal fossil dealing in [[China]], where many specimens have been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/language/bilingual/2009-11/483395.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811070718/http://www.globaltimes.cn/www/english/language/bilingual/2009-11/483395.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |title=Fossil trade puts China's natural history at risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade is lucrative, and many celebrities collect fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Luxury Market For Dinosaur Remains Thrives|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/09/luxury-dinosaur-market-th_n_1084588.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=10 November 2010|accessdate=21 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Society of Vertebrate Paleontology]], an international association of professional and amateur vertebrate paleontologists, believes that scientifically important fossils—especially but not exclusively those found on public lands—should be held in perpetuity in the public trust, preferably in a museum or research institution, where they can benefit the scientific community as a whole as well as future generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vertpaleo.org/society/polstatvertfossilsale.cfm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100714230458/https://www.vertpaleo.org/society/polstatvertfossilsale.cfm |archivedate=July 14, 2010 |title=Statement regarding the sale of vertebrate fossils online}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Paleontological Resources Preservation Act. S. 546]] and H. R. 2416 were introduced in the [[US Congress]] with SVP's full support.

Many commercial fossil collectors and dealers believe that such policies are a breach of their rights. The argument has also been put forth that there are too few professional paleontologists to collect and preserve fossils currently exposed to the elements, and that it is therefore essential that private citizens be allowed to collect them for the sake of their preservation. Eric Scott, the Curator of Paleontology for the San Bernardino County Museum, argues that 1) private citizens and amateur (not for profit) collectors can and do participate frequently in the permitted recovery and preservation of significant vertebrate fossils, and 2) preservation of significant fossils does not require or mandate ''sale'' of those fossils.&lt;ref name="Scott2005"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Scott, E. | year = 2005 | title = Is Selling Vertebrate Fossils Bad For Science? | journal = PALAIOS| doi = 10.2110/palo.2005.S06 | volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 515–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ethics by-law of SVP, "The barter, sale, or purchase of scientifically significant vertebrate fossils is not condoned, unless it brings them into or keeps them within a public trust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vertpaleo.org/Content/NavigationMenu/TheSociety/StatementsandGuidelines/OntheSaleofVertebrateFossils/default.htm|title=Statement regarding the sale of vertebrate fossils online|publisher=The Society of Vertebrate Paleontology|accessdate=2 November 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403072414/http://www.vertpaleo.org/Content/NavigationMenu/TheSociety/StatementsandGuidelines/OntheSaleofVertebrateFossils/default.htm|archivedate=3 April 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societies and clubs==
Many  include fossil collectors. [[Lapidary club]]s also include fossil collectors. In addition, paleontological societies and fossil clubs exist. There is some overlap between fossil collecting, [[mineral collecting]], and [[amateur geology]].

'''Geronimo''' "'''Gerry'''" '''Peñalosa''' (born August 7, 1972) is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] former [[professional boxer]] who competed from 1989 to 2010. He is a two-weight world champion, having held the [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] and [[lineal championship|lineal]] [[super flyweight]] titles from 1997 to 1998, and the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] [[bantamweight]] title from 2007 to 2009. Originally from [[San Carlos City, Negros Occidental|San Carlos City]], Peñalosa currently resides in [[Manila]]. He was trained mainly by [[Freddie Roach (boxing)|Freddie Roach]], and went on to become a boxing trainer himself after retirement. Peñalosa's older brother, [[Dodie Boy Peñalosa]], is also a former boxer and world champion.

==Professional career==
===Early years at flyweight===
Peñalosa turned professional in 1989. He made his debut against Fidel Jubay on May 20, 1989, and won the bout by knockout.

===Super flyweight===
He captured the WBC and [[Lineal championship|lineal]] super flyweight title with a decision win over [[Hiroshi Kawashima]] on 27 February 1997 and has defended the title three times since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jrbant.htm|title=Gerry Peñalosa - Lineal Jr. Bantamweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later lost it on points to [[In-Joo Cho]] on 29 August 1998. Two years later, he had a rematch with Cho to regain the title but again lost by controversial unanimous decision.

===Retirement and comeback===
On 24 September 2001, he challenged [[Masamori Tokuyama]] who then succeeded Cho in being the WBC super flyweight champion. However, he lost by another controversial split decision. The two fought again on 20 December 2002 but the result was the same, in Tokuyama's favor. Peñalosa temporarily retired that year.

Peñalosa returned to boxing two years later. He defeated Bangsaen Sithpraprom for the World Boxing Foundation (WBFo) super flyweight title on 7 November 2004.

===Super bantamweight===
On 17 March 2007, he took on [[Daniel Ponce de León]] who then held the WBO super bantamweight title. In the fight, Peñalosa displayed his intelligence, excellent boxing skills and defensive abilities. De León who is a knockout artist could not land a clear punch on Penalosa.  Penalosa answered with stinging counters that frustrated De Leon. Although De Leon was the busier boxer, most of his punches landed in the air and on Penalosa's gloves. However, De Leon won via unanimous decision.

===Return to bantamweight===
====WBO champion====
On August 11, 2007, the veteran Filipino boxer took on [[Jhonny González]] of [[Mexico]] for the WBO bantamweight title at the Arco Arena in [[Sacramento, California]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The younger fighter appeared to be in control of the match in the early rounds, as he skillfully kept the much shorter Peñalosa away with crisp jabs. Peñalosa stayed patient and continued to walk forward even though he is getting hit by some of the Mexican's punches. In the seventh round, Peñalosa got an opportunity, when Gonzales launched a strong right that missed Peñalosa head. Gonzalez failed to pull his arm back quickly and at that short moment, leaving a hole for the veteran fighter, who then threw a precise and solid left hook to Gonzalez’ body. The defending champion fell on the canvas a few moments after receiving the counter-attack; the Mexican tried to get up and fight again but failed to do it remained down on the canvas. This was Peñalosa's second world title in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He defended the title in [[Quezon City, Philippines]] by stopping former world title holder [[Ratanachai Sor Vorapin]] of [[Thailand]] in the eighth round on 6 April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This was the second time he fought Sor Vorapin in which Peñalosa prevailed on both encounters.

On February 21, 2009, Peñalosa took on German Meraz of [[Mexico]] at the Cebu Coliseum in [[Cebu City]], [[Cebu]], Philippines; the two fought in the main event of the "Battle of the Bantamweights" card. The WBO title was not at stake. The Filipino boxer won the fight by unanimous decision after 10 rounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====Events outside the ring====
After the Manny Pacquiao-Marco Antonio Barrera rematch in Las Vegas, Peñalosa and [[Jorge Arce]] of Mexico nearly figured in a fistfight, according to a report by Philboxing.com. The two boxers crossed  their way out of the Mandalay Bay Events Center. The boxing website said its sources revealed that it was Arce who challenged Peñalosa to a fight. Peñalosa was reportedly with his wife Goody and Japanese associate Kosuke Washio when the incident happened. Arce was reportedly irritated when one spectator told him upon seeing Penalosa that the Filipino boxer is more popular than him. The proud Mexican, the report said, apparently did not like the comments and immediately confronted the Filipino world champion. According to the report, Peñalosa was apparently irked by Arce's actuations and tried to follow the Mexican boxer but was prevailed upon by Goody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Super bantamweight===
He later fought on 25 April 2009, in [[Puerto Rico]] against Puerto Rican sensation [[Juan Manuel López (boxer)|Juan Manuel López]] for the WBO Super Bantamweight Championship. The showdown featured as a '''Champion versus Champion''' match because the two fighters were both holders of WBO World titles. Penalosa had the bantamweight title and Lopez had the super bantamweight belt.

Early in the fight, both pugilists exchanged combinations, with López gaining a slight advantage by targeting the head and body of Peñalosa. This pattern continued in the third and fourth rounds, while the challenger continued counterattacking despite receiving more damage. Between the fifth and sixth chapters, both pugilists exchanged combinations, with Peñalosa scoring his most solid punches. During the following two rounds, López managed to establish control of the offensive's tempo, but Peñalosa continued using his counterattack. Prior to the ninth chapter, Peñalosa's trainer, Freddie Roach, warned him that he had to win by knockout or the fight would be stopped. In the round, the pattern continued with few variations, once it was over Roach submitted the fight. With this technical knockout, López became the first boxer to defeat the veteran by knockout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

After the fight, the Filipino boxer said: "He (Lopez) was too big for me. I felt his punches. But I hope he wasn't lying after the fight when he said he felt my punches, too. I was the underdog but I gave it my best. I trained hard for that fight". Then Penalosa talked about a possible retirement after one last fight, as he wants to hang up his gloves as a champion. Many people, including members of his family and his friend, [[Manny Pacquiao]], wanted Peñalosa to quit boxing already, saying he has nothing more to prove in the sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In April, Penalosa was stripped of his bantamweight title for failing to defend it within one year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=sports4_may18_2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Farewell fights====
However, Peñalosa decided to fight for one more time. Many tough boxers were considered to be his possible next opponent, including [[Jorge Arce]], Daniel Ponce de Leon, [[Eric Morel]] and [[Vic Darchinyan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 13 February 2010, Peñalosa faced Eric Morel (41-2) of Puerto Rico for the interim WBO bantamweight title at the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. The veteran fighter trained at the Wild Card Gym in Los Angeles under the guidance of coach Freddie Roach, along with Filipino prospect [[Bernabe Concepcion]] and [[Septuple champion|seven-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

At the opening round the Puerto Rican looked to stick and move while Peñalosa took on the role of the aggressor. In the early rounds Morel appeared a bit more active. Peñalosa received a bad low blow in the 2nd round and was given some time to recover. In the 6th round a clash of heads opened a cut over the Filipino's right eyes; a few moments later, another headbutt opened a severe laceration over Peñalosa's left eye. The injury bled profusely during the next rounds, but he was able to hurt the opponent with strong body punches and seemed to take control of the fight. With the bleeding clearly bothering him, the "Fearless" boxer continued to attack as Morel seemed to keep away from him. Peñalosa continued along this way through the championship rounds, while Morel looked to jab and retreat. During the last rounds, Peñalosa fought hard but apparently hadn't done enough to impress the judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Following the fight against Morel, Peñalosa stated that he will fight for one last time against Yodsaenkeng Kietmangmee of Thailand on October 10, 2010. The Filipino pugilist also revealed that the proceeds of this match will be given to Z Gorres to help him with his medical expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://philboxing.com/news/story-44532.html | title =Gerry’s last hurrah for The Dream | last=Bonsubre | first =Rene | work = | publisher =PhilBoxing.com | date =September 27, 2010 | accessdate =October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event, called "Golpe Golpe na Zamboanga: The Last Hurrah", was held at the Zamboanga City Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://philboxing.com/news/story-44981.html | title =All set for Gerry’s last fight | last=Pangilinan | first =Robbie | work = | publisher =PhilBoxing.com | date =October 9, 2010 | accessdate =October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former world champion won the bout by TKO in the 4th round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://philboxing.com/news/story-45018.html | title =All set for Gerry’s last fight | last=Bonsubre | first =Rene | work = | publisher =PhilBoxing.com | date =October 10, 2010 | accessdate =October 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peñalosa finished his 21-year career with a professional record of 55 wins, with 37 knockouts, 8 losses and 2 draws.

===Retirement===
After retiring as a fighter he became a boxing promoter with his nephew, Dave Peñalosa, among the boxers in his stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://combat-asia.com/index.php/gerry-penalosas-nephew-dave-penalosa-to-take-on-thai-opponent-in-manila-on-saturday| title =Gerry Peñalosa's nephew Dave Peñalosa to take on Thai opponent in Manila on Saturday| last= | first = | work = | publisher =Combat Asia | date =August 14, 2012 | accessdate =August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outside the ring==
On April 21, 2008, Peñalosa won in the game show ''[[Wheel of Fortune (Philippine game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' held in the Philippines, defeating fellow boxers [[Reynaldo Bautista|Rey Bautista]] and [[AJ Banal|Alex John Banal]]. The prize he earned was worth [[Philippine peso|P]]159,000 ($3,791).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Hong Kong 1956 riots''' were the result of escalating provocations between pro-[[Chinese Nationalist|Nationalist]] and pro-[[Communist Party of China|Communist]] factions in Hong Kong during [[Double Ten Day]], 10 October 1956.&lt;ref name="hkh1"&gt;HKheadline.com.

Most violence took place in the town of [[Tsuen Wan]], five miles from central Kowloon. A mob stormed and ransacked a clinic and welfare centre, killing four people. Some foreigners became involved, including a Swiss national who lost his life while travelling in a taxi on [[Nathan Road]].&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,824497,00.html "Hong Kong: Trouble on the Double Ten"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' Monday, 22 Oct. 1956&lt;/ref&gt;

To quell the rioting, [[Chief Secretary for Administration|Colonial Secretary]] [[Edgeworth B. David]] ordered extra manpower from the [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|British Forces Hong Kong]], including armoured troops of  [[The Queen's Royal Hussars|7th Hussars]], to reinforce the [[Hong Kong Police]] and disperse the rioters.&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt;  In total, there were 59 deaths and approximately 500 injuries.

{{Humanism}}
{{contains Hebrew text}}

'''Humanism''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical]] and [[ethics|ethical]] stance that emphasizes the value and [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] of [[Human|human beings]], individually and collectively, and generally prefers [[critical thinking]] and [[evidence]] ([[rationalism]] and  [[empiricism]]) over acceptance of [[dogma]] or [[superstition]]. The meaning of the term ''humanism'' has fluctuated according to the successive intellectual movements which have identified with it.&lt;ref name="What 2004"&gt;[[Nicolas Walter]]'s ''Humanism{{spaced ndash}}What's in the Word'' (London: [[Rationalist Press Association]], 1997 {{ISBN|0-301-97001-7}}) gives an account of the evolution of the meaning of the word ''humanism'' from the point of view of a modern [[secular humanist]]. A similar perspective, but somewhat less polemical, appears in [[Richard Norman]]'s ''On Humanism (Thinking in Action)'' (London: Routledge: 2004). For a historical and [[philological]]ly oriented view, see Vito Giustiniani's "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism", ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' 46: 2 (April–June 1985): 167–95.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by theologian [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer|Friedrich Niethammer]] at the beginning of the [[19th century]] to refer to a system of education based on the study of classical literature ("classical humanism"). Generally, however, humanism refers to a perspective that affirms some notion of human [[freedom]] and progress. It views humans as solely responsible for the promotion and development of individuals and emphasizes a concern for man in relation to the world.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, “Developing the Spirit of Patriotism and Humanism in Children for Peace and Harmony”, ''Children At Risk: Issues and Challenges'', Jesudason Jeyaraj (Ed.), Bangalore: CFCD/ISPCK, 2009, p.474&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern times, humanist movements are typically [[secular humanism|non-religious movements]] aligned with [[secularism]], and today humanism typically refers to a [[nontheism|nontheistic]] [[life stance]] centred on human agency and looking to [[science]] rather than [[revelation]] from a [[supernatural]] source to understand the world.&lt;ref&gt;See for example the 2002 ''[[Amsterdam Declaration]]'' &lt;http://iheu.org/humanism/the-amsterdam-declaration/&gt; issued by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
The [[British Humanist Association]]'s [https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/ definition of Humanism]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The word "humanism" is ultimately derived from the Latin concept ''[[humanitas]]''.  It entered English in the nineteenth century. However, historians agree that the concept predates the label invented to describe it, encompassing the various meanings ascribed to ''humanitas'', which included both benevolence toward one's fellow humans and the values imparted by ''bonae litterae'' or humane learning (literally "good letters").

In the second century AD, a Latin grammarian, [[Aulus Gellius]] (c.{{nbsp}}125{{snds}}c.{{nbsp}}180), complained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Those who have spoken Latin and have used the language correctly do not give to the word ''humanitas'' the meaning which it is commonly thought to have, namely, what the Greeks call φιλανθρωπία ([[philanthropy]]), signifying a kind of friendly spirit and good-feeling towards all men without distinction; but they gave to ''humanitas'' the force of the Greek παιδεία ([[paideia]]); that is, what we call ''eruditionem institutionemque in bonas artes'', or "education and training in the [[liberal arts]]". Those who earnestly desire and seek after these are most highly humanized. For the desire to pursue of that kind of knowledge, and the training given by it, has been granted to humanity alone of all the animals, and for that reason it is termed ''humanitas'', or "humanity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Gellius/13*.html Aulus Gellius], ''Attic Nights'', XIII: 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gellius says that in his day ''humanitas'' is commonly used as a synonym for [[philanthropy]]{{snds}}or kindness and benevolence toward one's fellow human beings. Gellius maintains that this common usage is wrong, and that model writers of Latin, such as Cicero and others, used the word only to mean what we might call "humane" or "polite" learning, or the Greek equivalent [[Paideia]]. Yet in seeking to restrict the meaning of ''humanitas'' to literary education this way, Gellius was not advocating a retreat from political engagement into some ivory tower, though it might look like that to us. He himself was involved in public affairs. According to legal historian Richard Bauman, Gellius was a judge as well as a grammarian and was an active participant the great contemporary debate on harsh punishments that accompanied the legal reforms of [[Antoninus Pius]] (one these reforms,  for example, was that a prisoner was not to be treated as guilty before being tried). "By assigning pride of place to Paideia in his comment on the etymology of ''humanitas'', Gellius implies that the trained mind is best equipped to handle the problems troubling society."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'' (Routledge Classical Monographs [1999]), pp. 74–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gellius's writings fell into obscurity during the Middle Ages, but during the Italian Renaissance, Gellius became a favorite author. Teachers and scholars of Greek and Latin grammar, rhetoric, philosophy, and poetry were called and called themselves "humanists".&lt;ref name="mann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann |first=Nicholas |title=The Origins of Humanism |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |pages=1–2 |quote=The term ''umanista'' was used, in fifteenth century Italian academic jargon to describe a teacher or student of classical literature including that of grammar and rhetoric. The English equivalent 'humanist' makes its appearance in the late sixteenth century with a similar meaning. Only in the nineteenth century, however, and probably for the first time in [[Humanism in Germany|Germany]] in 1809, is the attribute transformed into a substantive: ''humanism'', standing for devotion to the literature of ancient Greece and Rome, and the humane values that may be derived from them.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oxford-renaissance"&gt;''Humanissime vir'', "most humane man", was the usual Latin way to address scholars. (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 168.)&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholars, however, point out that [[Cicero]] (106{{snds}}43{{nbsp}}BCE), who was most responsible for defining and popularizing the term ''humanitas'', in fact frequently used the word in both senses, as did his near contemporaries. For Cicero, a lawyer, what most distinguished humans from brutes was speech, which, allied to reason, could (and should) enable them to settle disputes and live together in concord and harmony under the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;There was a time when men wandered about in the manner of wild beasts. They conducted their affairs without the least guidance of reason but instead relied on bodily strength. There was no divine religion and the understanding of social duty was in no way cultivated. No one recognized the value inherent in an equitable code of law.(Cicero, ''De Inventione'', I. I: 2, quoted in Quentin Skinner, ''Visions of Politics, Volume 2:  Renaissance Virtues'' [Cambridge University Press, 2002], p. 54.)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''humanitas'' included two meanings from the outset and these continue in the modern derivative, ''humanism'', which even today can refer to both humanitarian benevolence and to a method of study and debate involving an accepted group of authors and a careful and accurate use of language.&lt;ref&gt;A noted authority on the subject, [[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], identified Renaissance humanism as a cultural and literary movement, which in its substance was not philosophical but which had important philosophical implications and consequences." "I have been unable to discover in the humanist literature any common philosophical doctrine," he wrote, "except a belief in the value of man and the humanities and in the revival of ancient learning." (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought: The Classic, Scholastic, and Humanist Strains'' [New York, Harper and Row, 1961], p. 9). As the late Jacques Barzun has written:&lt;blockquote&gt;The path between the onset of the good letters and the modern humanist as freethinker or simply as scholar is circuitous but unbroken. If we look for what is common to the Humanists over the centuries we find two things: a body of accepted authors and a method of carrying on study and debate. The two go together with the belief that the best guides to the good life are [[Reason]] and [[Nature]]. (Jacques Barzun, ''From Dawn to Decadence :500 years of Western Cultural Life'' [New York: HarperCollins, 2000], p. 45)&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], and soon after, in Germany (by the [[Left Hegelians]]), ''humanism'' began to refer to an ethical philosophy centered on humankind, without attention to the [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] or  [[supernatural]]. The designation [[Religious Humanism]] refers to organized groups that sprang up during the late-nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is similar to [[Protestantism]], although centered on human needs, interests, and abilities rather than the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Genesis of a Humanist Manifesto | url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/edwin_wilson/manifesto/ch2.html | accessdate=14 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Anglophone world, such modern, organized forms of humanism, which are rooted in the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], have to a considerable extent more or less detached themselves from the historic connection of humanism with [[Classics|classical learning]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].

The first ''[[Humanist Manifesto I|Humanist Manifesto]]'' was issued by a conference held at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Who_We_Are/About_Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |title=Text of Humanist Manifesto I |publisher=Americanhumanist.org |accessdate=13 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107221355/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_I |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Signatories included the philosopher [[John Dewey]], but the majority were ministers (chiefly [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]) and [[Academic theology|theologians]]. They identified humanism as an ideology that espouses [[reason]], [[ethics]], and [[social justice|social and economic justice]], and they called for science to replace [[Dogma#In religion|dogma]] and the [[supernatural]] as the basis of [[morality]] and decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Although a distinction has often been drawn between secular and religious humanism, the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] and similar organizations prefer to describe their life stance without qualification as 'Humanism'. See Nicolas Walter,  ''Humanism: What's in the Word?'' (London: RPA/BHA/Secular Society Ltd, 1937), p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanism is Eight Letters, No More|url=http://www.iheu.org/humanism-is-eight-letters-no-more|authors=Harold Blackham, Levi Fragell, Corliss Lamont, Harry Stopes-Roe,  Rob Tielman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Isola di Utopia Moro.jpg|thumb|An ideal society as conceived by Renaissance humanist Saint [[Thomas More]] in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'']]

In 1808 Bavarian educational commissioner [[Friedrich Immanuel Niethammer]] coined the term ''Humanismus'' to describe the new [[Classics|classical curriculum]] he planned to offer in German secondary schools,&lt;ref&gt;Niethammer's book was entitled ''Der Streit des Philanthropinismus und des Humanismus in der Theorie des Erziehungs-Unterrichts unsrer Zeit'' (''The Dispute between Philanthropinism and Humanism in the Educational Theory of our Time''), which directly echoes Aulus Gellius's distinction between "philanthropy" and humane learning. Neithammer and other distinguished members of the movement they called "Neo-Humanism" (who included [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling]] and [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]]), felt that the curriculum imposed under Napoleon's occupation of Germany had been excessively oriented toward the practical and vocational. They wished to encourage individuals to practice life-long self cultivation and reflection, based on a study of the artistic, philosophical, and cultural masterpieces of (primarily) Greek civilization.&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1836 the word "humanism" had been absorbed into the English language in this sense. The coinage gained universal acceptance in 1856, when German historian and philologist [[Georg Voigt]] used ''humanism'' to describe [[Renaissance humanism]], the movement that flourished in the Italian [[Renaissance]] to revive classical learning, a use which won wide acceptance among historians in many nations, especially Italy.&lt;ref name="See 1877"&gt;As J. A. Symonds remarked, "the word humanism has a German sound and is in fact modern" (See ''The Renaissance in Italy'' Vol. 2:71 n, 1877). Vito Giustiniani writes that in the German-speaking world "Humanist" while keeping its specific meaning (as scholar of Classical literature) "gave birth to further derivatives, such as ''humanistisch'' for those schools which later were to be called ''humanistische Gymnasien'', with Latin and Greek as the main subjects of teaching (1784). Finally, ''Humanismus'' was introduced to denote 'classical education in general' (1808) and still later for the epoch and the achievements of the Italian humanists of the fifteenth century (1841). This is to say that 'humanism' for 'classical learning' appeared first in Germany, where it was once and for all sanctioned in this meaning by Georg Voigt (1859)". (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 172.)&lt;/ref&gt;

But in the mid-18th century, during the French Enlightenment, a more ideological use of the term had come into use. In 1765, the author of an anonymous article in a French Enlightenment periodical spoke of "The general love of humanity ... a virtue hitherto quite nameless among us, and which we will venture to call 'humanism', for the time has come to create a word for such a beautiful and necessary thing".&lt;ref&gt;"''L'amour général de l'humanité ... vertu qui n'a point de nom parmi nous et que nous oserions appeler 'humanisme', puisqu'enfin il est temps de créer un mot pour une chose si belle et nécessaire''"; from the review ''Ephémérides du citoyen ou Bibliothèque raisonée des sciences morales et politiques'', Chapter 16 (Dec, 17, 1765): 247, quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175, note 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter part of the 18th and the early 19th centuries saw the creation of numerous grass-roots "philanthropic" and benevolent societies dedicated to human betterment and the spreading of knowledge (some Christian, some not). After the [[French Revolution]], the idea that human virtue could be created by human reason alone independently from traditional religious institutions, attributed by opponents of the Revolution to [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ''[[philosophes]]'' such as [[Rousseau]], was violently attacked by influential religious and political [[Conservatism|conservatives]], such as [[Edmund Burke]] and [[Joseph de Maistre]], as a deification or idolatry of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Although Rousseau himself devoutly believed in a personal God, his book, ''[[Emile: or, On Education]]'', does attempt to demonstrate that atheists can be virtuous. It was publicly burned. During the Revolution, [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobins]] instituted a cult of the Supreme Being along lines suggested by Rousseau. In the 19th-century French positivist philosopher [[Auguste Comte]] (1798–1857) founded a "religion of humanity", whose calendar and catechism echoed the former Revolutionary cult. See [[Comtism]]&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism began to acquire a negative sense. The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' records the use of the word "humanism" by an English clergyman in 1812 to indicate those who believe in the "mere humanity" (as opposed to the divine nature) of Christ, i.e., [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] and [[Deists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; In this polarised atmosphere, in which established ecclesiastical bodies tended to [[circle the wagons]] and reflexively oppose political and social reforms like extending the franchise, universal schooling, and the like, liberal reformers and radicals embraced the idea of Humanism as an alternative religion of humanity. The anarchist [[Proudhon]] (best known for declaring that "[[property is theft]]") used the word "humanism" to describe a "''culte, déification de l’humanité''" ("worship,  deification of humanity") and [[Ernest Renan]] in ''L’avenir de la science: pensées de 1848'' ("The Future of Knowledge: Thoughts on 1848") (1848–49), states: "It is my deep conviction that pure ''humanism'' will be the religion of the future, that is, the cult of all that pertains to humanity{{mdash}}all of life, sanctified and raised to the level of a moral value."&lt;ref&gt;''"Ma conviction intime est que la religion de l'avenir sera le pur'' humanisme, ''c’est-à-dire le culte de tout ce qui est de l'homme, la vie entière santifiée et éléve a une valeur moral"''. quoted in Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism" : 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the word "humanism" as a philosophy centred on humankind (as opposed to institutionalised religion) was also being used in Germany by the [[Left Hegelians]], [[Arnold Ruge]], and [[Karl Marx]], who were critical of the close involvement of the church in the German government. There has been a persistent confusion between the several uses of the terms:&lt;ref name="What 2004"/&gt; philanthropic humanists look to what they consider their antecedents in critical thinking and human-centered philosophy among the Greek philosophers and the great figures of Renaissance history; and scholarly humanists stress the linguistic and cultural disciplines needed to understand and interpret these philosophers and artists.

===Predecessors===

====Ancient South Asia====

Human-centered philosophy that rejected the supernatural may also be found circa 1500 BCE in the [[Cārvāka|Lokayata]] system of Indian philosophy. [[Nasadiya Sukta]], a passage in the [[Rigveda|Rig Veda]], contains one of the first recorded assertions of agnosticism.
In the 6th-century BCE, [[Gautama Buddha]] expressed, in [[Pali literature]] a skeptical attitude toward the supernatural:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lesson 1: A brief history of humanist thought|url=http://humanisteducation.com/class.html?module_id=1&amp;page=1|work= Introduction to Humanism: A Primer on the History, Philosophy, and Goals of Humanism|publisher=The Continuum of Humanist Education|accessdate=21 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since neither soul, nor aught belonging to soul, can really and truly exist, the view which holds that this I who am 'world', who am 'soul', shall hereafter live permanent, persisting, unchanging, yea abide eternally: is not this utterly and entirely a foolish doctrine?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another instance of ancient humanism as an organised system of thought is found in the [[Gathas]] of [[Zarathustra]], composed between 1,000{{nbsp}}BCE{{snds}}600{{nbsp}}BCE&lt;ref&gt;"Principles of Integral Science of Religion", By Georg Schmid, p. 109, 'As an Example: Yasna 32:8', p. 109&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greater Iran]]. Zarathustra's philosophy in the Gathas lays out a conception of humankind as thinking beings, dignified with choice and agency according to the intellect which each receives from [[Ahura Mazda]] (God in the form of supreme wisdom). The idea of Ahura Mazda as a non-intervening [[Deism|deistic]] god or [[Great Architect of the Universe]] was combined with a unique eschatology and ethical system which implied that each person is held morally responsible in the afterlife, for their choices they freely made in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Behavior and Good Thinking|url=http://www.zarathushtra.com/z/article/dgm/vol1.htm#volume1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This importance placed upon thought, action and personal responsibility, and the concept of a non-intervening creator, was a source of inspiration to a number of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] humanist thinkers in Europe such as [[Voltaire]] and [[Montesquieu]].

====Ancient Greece====
{{Main|Ancient Greek philosophy}}

6th-century [[BCE]] [[pre-Socratic]] Greek philosophers [[Thales of Miletus]] and [[Xenophanes of Colophon]] were the first in the region to attempt to explain the world in terms of human reason rather than myth and tradition, thus can be said to be the first Greek humanists. Thales questioned the notion of anthropomorphic gods and Xenophanes refused to recognise the gods of his time and reserved the divine for the principle of unity in the universe. These Ionian Greeks were the first thinkers to assert that nature is available to be studied separately from the supernatural realm. [[Anaxagoras]] brought philosophy and the spirit of rational inquiry from Ionia to Athens. [[Pericles]], the leader of Athens during the period of its greatest glory was an admirer of Anaxagoras. Other influential pre-Socratics or rational philosophers include [[Protagoras]] (like Anaxagoras a friend of Pericles), known for his famous dictum "man is the measure of all things" and [[Democritus]], who proposed that matter was composed of atoms. Little of the written work of these early philosophers survives and they are known mainly from fragments and quotations in other writers, principally [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]]. The historian [[Thucydides]], noted for his scientific and rational approach to history, is also much admired by later humanists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Potter |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Francis Potter |title=Humanism A new Religion |pages=64–69 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1930}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In the 3rd century BCE, [[Epicurus]] became known for his concise phrasing of the [[problem of evil]], lack of belief in the afterlife, and human-centred approaches to achieving [[eudaimonia]]. He was also the first Greek philosopher to admit women to his school as a rule.

====Medieval Islam====
{{See also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Many medieval Muslim thinkers pursued humanistic, [[Rationalism|rational]] and scientific [[discourse]]s in their search for knowledge, meaning and [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]]. A wide range of Islamic writings on love, poetry, history and [[philosophical theology]] show that medieval Islamic thought was open to the humanistic ideas of [[individualism]], occasional [[secularism]], [[skepticism]], and [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=Goodman&gt;Lenn Evan Goodman (2003), ''Islamic Humanism'', p. 155, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-513580-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Imad-ad-Dean Ahmad, another reason the Islamic world flourished during the Middle Ages was an early emphasis on [[freedom of speech]], as summarised by al-Hashimi (a cousin of Caliph [[al-Ma'mun]]) in the following letter to one of the religious opponents he was attempting to [[Religious conversion|convert]] through [[reason]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |first=I.

According to George Makdisi, certain aspects of [[Renaissance humanism]] has its roots in the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], including the "art of ''[[Dictation (exercise)|dictation]]'', called in Latin, ''[[ars dictaminis]]''", and "the humanist attitude toward [[classical language]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Makdisi |first=George |title=Scholasticism and Humanism in Classical Islam and the Christian West |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=2 |date=April–June 1989 |pages=175–82 |doi=10.2307/604423 |publisher=Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 109, No. 2 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |jstor=604423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===
{{Main|Renaissance humanism}}

[[File:Ritratto di francesco petrarca, altichiero, 1376 circa, padova.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Petrarch]] painted in 1376]]

Renaissance humanism was an intellectual movement in Europe of the later [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern]] period. The 19th-century German historian [[Georg Voigt]] (1827–91) identified [[Petrarch]] as the first Renaissance humanist. [[Paul Johnson (writer)|Paul Johnson]] agrees that Petrarch was "the first to put into words the notion that the centuries between the fall of Rome and the present had been the age of Darkness". According to Petrarch, what was needed to remedy this situation was the careful study and imitation of the great classical authors. For Petrarch and [[Boccaccio]], the greatest master was [[Cicero]], whose prose became the model for both learned (Latin) and vernacular (Italian) prose.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Once the language was mastered grammatically it could be used to attain the second stage, eloquence or rhetoric. This art of persuasion [Cicero had held] was not art for its own sake, but the acquisition of the capacity to persuade others – all men and women – to lead the good life. As Petrarch put it, 'it is better to will the good than to know the truth'. Rhetoric thus led to and embraced philosophy. [[Leonardo Bruni]] (c.{{nbsp}}1369–1444), the outstanding scholar of the new generation, insisted that it was Petrarch who "opened the way for us to show how to acquire learning", but it was in Bruni's time that the word ''umanista'' first came into use, and its subjects of study were listed as five: grammar, rhetoric, poetry, moral philosophy, and history".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |pages=32–34 and 37 |isbn=0-679-64086-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Salutati.jpg|thumb|Coluccio Salutati, Chancellor of Florence and disciple of Petrarch (1331–1406)]]

The basic training of the humanist was to speak well and write (typically, in the form of a letter). One of Petrarch's followers, [[Coluccio Salutati]] (1331–1406) was made chancellor of [[Florence]], "whose interests he defended with his literary skill. The Visconti of Milan claimed that Salutati’s pen had done more damage than 'thirty squadrons of Florentine cavalry'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Paul |title=The Renaissance |year=2000 |publisher=The Modern Library |location=New York |page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gianfrancesco Poggio Bracciolini - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Poggio Bracciolini (1380–1459), an early Renaissance humanist, book collector, and reformer of script, who served as papal secretary&lt;ref&gt;Following an old engraving; from Alfred Gudeman, ''Imagines philologorum: 160 bildnisse...'' ("Portraits of Philologists, 160 prints"), (Leipzig/Berlin) 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Contrary to a still widely held interpretation that originated in Voigt's celebrated contemporary, [[Jacob Burckhardt]],&lt;ref&gt;The influence of Jacob Burckhardt's classic masterpiece of cultural history, [[The Civilisation of the Renaissance in Italy]] (1860) on subsequent Renaissance historiography is traced in Wallace K. Ferguson's ''The Renaissance in Historical Thought: Five Centuries of Historical Interpretation'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt; and which was adopted wholeheartedly – especially by modern thinkers calling themselves "humanists" – &lt;ref&gt;For example the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy,'' adhering to the tenacious 19th-century narrative of the Renaissance as a complete break with the past established in 1860 by [[Jacob Burckhardt]], describes the liberating effects of the re-discovery of classical writings this way:&lt;blockquote&gt;Here, one felt no weight of the supernatural pressing on the human mind, demanding homage and allegiance. Humanity{{mdash}}with all its distinct capabilities, talents, worries, problems, possibilities{{mdash}}was the centre of interest. It has been said that medieval thinkers philosophised on their knees, but, bolstered by the new studies, they dared to stand up and to rise to full stature.{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia="The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Second Edition|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; most specialists today do not characterise Renaissance humanism as a philosophical movement, nor in any way as anti-Christian or even anti-clerical. A modern historian has this to say:

{{quote|text=Humanism was not an ideological programme but a body of literary knowledge and linguistic skill based on the "revival of good letters", which was a revival of a late-antique philology and grammar, This is how the word "humanist" was understood by contemporaries, and if scholars would agree to accept the word in this sense rather than in the sense in which it was used in the nineteenth century we might be spared a good deal of useless argument. That humanism had profound social and even political consequences of the life of Italian courts is not to be doubted. But the idea that as a movement it was in some way inimical to the Church, or to the conservative social order in general is one that has been put forward for a century and more without any substantial proof being offered.&lt;poem&gt;

&lt;/poem&gt;The nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt, in his classic work, ''[[The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy]]'', noted as a "curious fact" that some men of the new culture were "men of the strictest piety, or even ascetics". If he had meditated more deeply on the meaning of the careers of such humanists as Abrogio Traversari (1386–1439), the General of the Camaldolese Order, perhaps he would not have gone on to describe humanism in unqualified terms as "pagan", and thus helped precipitate a century of infertile debate about the possible existence of something called "Christian humanism" which ought to be opposed to "pagan humanism".|author=Peter Partner|source=''Renaissance Rome, Portrait of a Society 1500–1559'' (University of California Press 1979) pp. 14–15.}}

The ''umanisti'' criticised what they considered the barbarous Latin of the universities, but the revival of the humanities largely did not conflict with the teaching of traditional university subjects, which went on as before.&lt;ref&gt;

"The term ''umanista'' was associated with the revival of the ''[[studia humanitatis]]'' "which included ''grammatica'', ''rhetorica'', poetics, ''historia'', and ''philosophia moralis'', as these terms were understood. Unlike the liberal arts of the eighteenth century, they did not include the visual arts, music, dancing or gardening. The humanities also failed to include the disciplines that were the chief subjects of instruction at the universities during the Later Middle Ages and throughout the Renaissance, such as theology, jurisprudence, and medicine, and the philosophical disciplines other than ethics, such as logic, natural philosophy, and metaphysics. In other words, humanism does not represent, as often believed, the sum total of Renaissance thought and learning, but only a well-defined sector of it. Humanism has its proper domain or home territory in the humanities, whereas all other areas of learning, including philosophy (apart from ethics), followed their own course, largely determined by their medieval tradition and by their steady transformation through new observations, problems, or theories. These disciplines were affected by humanism mainly from the outside and in an indirect way, though often quite strongly". ([[Paul Oskar Kristeller]], ''Humanism'', pp. 113–14, in Charles B. Schmitt, [[Quentin Skinner]] (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'' [1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

Nor did the humanists view themselves as in conflict with Christianity. Some, like Salutati, were the Chancellors of Italian cities, but the majority (including Petrarch) were ordained as priests, and many worked as senior officials of the Papal court. Humanist Renaissance popes [[Pope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]], [[Pope Pius II|Pius II]], [[Pope Sixtus IV|Sixtus IV]], and [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] wrote books and amassed huge libraries.&lt;ref&gt;See their respective entries in Sir John Hale's ''Concise Encyclopaedia of the Italian Renaissance'' (Oxford University Press, 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[High Renaissance]], in fact, there was a hope that more direct knowledge of the wisdom of antiquity, including the writings of the Church fathers, the earliest known Greek texts of the Christian Gospels, and in some cases even the Jewish [[Kabbalah]], would initiate a harmonious new era of universal agreement.&lt;ref&gt;To later generations, the Dutch humanist, [[Desiderius Erasmus]], epitomised this reconciling tendency). According to the ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'', "[[European Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers remembered Erasmus (not quite accurately) as a precursor of modern intellectual freedom and a foe of both Protestant and Catholic dogmatism". [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/erasmus/. Erasmus himself was not much interested in the Kabbalah, but several other humanists were, notably Pico della Mirandola]. See [[Christian Kabbalah]].)&lt;/ref&gt; With this end in view, Renaissance Church authorities afforded humanists what in retrospect appears a remarkable degree of freedom of thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Bergin |first1=Thomas |last2=Speake |first2=Jennifer |title=The Encyclopedia of the Renaissance |year=1987 |publisher=Facts On File Publications |location=Oxford |pages=216–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Only thirteen of Pico della Mirandola's nine hundred theses were thought theologically objectionable by the papal commission that examined them.... [This] suggests that, in spite of his publicly expressed contempt in his ''Apologia'' for their intellectual inadequacies, the Curial authorities hardly saw these theses as the work of a dangerous theological modernist like Luther or Calvin. Unorthodox though they were, most of the issues raised in them had been the subject of theological dispute for centuries and the commission ... condemned him not for innovations but for 'reviving several of the errors of gentile philosophers which are already disproved and obsolete'". Davies (1997), p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; One humanist, the [[Greek Orthodox]] Platonist [[Gemistus Pletho]] (1355–1452), based in [[Mystras]], Greece (but in contact with humanists in Florence, Venice, and Rome) taught a Christianised version of pagan [[polytheism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard H. Popkin]] (editor), ''The Columbia History of Western Philosophy'' (1998), pp. 293, 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to the sources====

[[File:Quentin Massys- Erasmus of Rotterdam.JPG|thumb|Portrait of [[Erasmus of Rotterdam]]]]

The humanists' close study of [[Latin]] literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ''[[ad fontes]]'', or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of [[Patristic]] literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in [[Naples]] at the court of [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist [[Lorenzo Valla]] used stylistic textual analysis, now called [[philology]], to prove that the [[Donation of Constantine]], which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery.&lt;ref&gt;More than 100 years earlier, Dante in the [[Divine Comedy]] (c. 1308–1321) had pinpointed the Donation of Constantine (which he accepted as genuine) as a great mistake and the cause of all the political and religious problems of Italy, including the corruption of the Church. Although Dante had thunderously attacked the idea that the Church could have temporal as well as spiritual powers, it remained to Valla to conclusively prove that the legal justification for such powers was spurious.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the [[Byzantine Empire]] to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Hermeticism]], hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world.&lt;ref&gt;Ironically, it was a humanist scholar, [[Isaac Casaubon]], in the 17th century, who would use philology to show that the [[Corpus Hermeticum]] was not of great antiquity, as had been asserted in the 4th century by [[Saint Augustine]] and [[Lactantius]], but dated from the Christian era. See Anthony Grafton, ''Defenders of the Text: The Traditions of Scholarship in an Age of Science, 1450–1800'' (Harvard University Press, 1991).&lt;/ref&gt; The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.

After 1517, when the new invention of printing made these texts widely available, the Dutch humanist [[Erasmus]], who had studied Greek at the Venetian printing house of [[Aldus Manutius]], began a philological analysis of the Gospels in the spirit of Valla, comparing the Greek originals with their Latin translations with a view to correcting errors and discrepancies in the latter. Erasmus, along with the French humanist [[Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples]], began issuing new translations, laying the groundwork for the Protestant Reformation. Henceforth Renaissance humanism, particularly in the German North, became concerned with religion, while Italian and French humanism concentrated increasingly on scholarship and philology addressed to a narrow audience of specialists, studiously avoiding topics that might offend despotic rulers or which might be seen as corrosive of faith. After the Reformation, critical examination of the Bible did not resume until the advent of the so-called [[Higher criticism]] of the 19th-century German [[Tübingen school]].

====Consequences====

The ''ad fontes'' principle also had many applications. The re-discovery of ancient manuscripts brought a more profound and accurate knowledge of ancient philosophical schools such as [[Epicureanism]], and [[Neoplatonism]], whose Pagan wisdom the humanists, like the Church fathers of old, tended, at least initially, to consider as deriving from divine revelation and thus adaptable to a life of Christian virtue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Humanism|encyclopedia=Encyclopedic Dictionary of Religion|volume=F-N|page=1733|publisher=Corpus Publications|year=1979|isbn=0-9602572-1-7}} "Renaissance humanists rejoiced in the mutual compatibility of much ancient philosophy and Christian truths", M. A. Screech, ''Laughter at the Foot of the Cross'' (1997), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; The line from a drama of [[Terence]], ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto'' (or with ''nil'' for ''nihil''), meaning "I am a human being, I think nothing human alien to me",&lt;ref&gt;''Homo'' in Latin specifically means "human being", in contrast to ''vir'', "man", and ''mulier'', "woman": Annabel Robinson, ''The Life and Work of Jane Ellen Harrison'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), p. 206; Tore Janson, ''A Natural History of Latin'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 281; Timothy J. Moore, ''Roman Theatre'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 62 (note to the line in Terence); as a "watchword" for humanists, ''Humanism and the Humanities in the Twenty-First Century'', edited by William S. Haney and Peter Malekin (Associated University Presses, 2001), p. 171; similar ''homo sum'' declaration by Seneca, James Ker, ''The Deaths of Seneca'' (Oxford University Press, 2009), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; known since antiquity through the endorsement of Saint Augustine, gained renewed currency as epitomising the humanist attitude. The statement, in a play modeled or borrowed from a (now lost) Greek comedy by Menander, may have originated in a lighthearted vein{{snds}}as a comic rationale for an old man's meddling{{snds}}but it quickly became a proverb and throughout the ages was quoted with a deeper meaning, by Cicero and Saint Augustine, to name a few, and most notably by [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Richard Bauman writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Homo sum: humani nihil a me alienum puto.'', I am a human being: and I deem nothing pertaining to humanity is foreign to me.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The words of the comic playwright P.{{nbsp}}Terentius Afer reverberated across the Roman world of the mid-2nd century BCE and beyond. Terence, an African and a former slave, was well placed to preach the message of universalism, of the essential unity of the human race, that had come down in philosophical form from the Greeks, but needed the pragmatic muscles of Rome in order to become a practical reality. The influence of Terence's felicitous phrase on Roman thinking about human rights can hardly be overestimated. Two hundred years later Seneca ended his seminal exposition of the unity of humankind with a clarion-call:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is one short rule that should regulate human relationships. All that you see, both divine and human, is one. We are parts of the same great body. Nature created us from the same source and to the same end. She imbued us with mutual affection and sociability, she taught us to be fair and just, to suffer injury rather than to inflict it. She bid us extend our hands to all in need of help. Let that well-known line be in our heart and on our lips: ''Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto''." &lt;ref&gt;Bauman, ''Human Rights in Ancient Rome'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Better acquaintance with Greek and Roman technical writings also influenced the development of European science (see the [[history of science in the Renaissance]]). This was despite what [[A. C. Crombie]] (viewing the Renaissance in the 19th-century manner as a chapter in the heroic March of Progress) calls "a backwards-looking admiration for antiquity", in which Platonism stood in opposition to the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] concentration on the observable properties of the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. C. Crombie]], ''Historians and the Scientific Revolution'', p. 456 in ''Science, Art and Nature in Medieval and Modern Thought'' (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; But Renaissance humanists, who considered themselves as restoring the glory and nobility of antiquity, had no interest in scientific innovation. However, by the mid-to-late 16th century, even the universities, though still dominated by Scholasticism, began to demand that Aristotle be read in accurate texts edited according to the principles of Renaissance philology, thus setting the stage for Galileo's quarrels with the outmoded habits of Scholasticism.

Just as artist and inventor [[Leonardo da Vinci]]{{snds}}partaking of the ''[[zeitgeist]]'' though not himself a humanist{{snds}}advocated study of human [[anatomy]], nature, and weather to enrich Renaissance works of art, so Spanish-born humanist [[Juan Luis Vives]] (c. 1493–1540) advocated observation, craft, and practical techniques to improve the formal teaching of Aristotelian philosophy at the universities, helping to free them from the grip of Medieval Scholasticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Gottlieb |first=Anthony |title=The Dream of Reason: a history of western philosophy from the Greeks to the Renaissance |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year=2000 |pages=410–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the stage was set for the adoption of an approach to [[natural philosophy]], based on [[empiricism|empirical]] observations and experimentation of the physical universe, making possible the advent of the age of scientific inquiry that followed the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Alleby |first=Brad |title=Humanism |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Religion |volume=1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |year=2003 |pages=426–28 |isbn=0-02-865705-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in education that the humanists' program had the most lasting results, their curriculum and methods:

&lt;blockquote&gt;were followed everywhere, serving as models for the Protestant Reformers as well as the Jesuits. The humanistic school, animated by the idea that the study of classical languages and literature provided valuable information and intellectual discipline as well as moral standards and a civilised taste for future rulers, leaders, and professionals of its society, flourished without interruption, through many significant changes, until our own century, surviving many religious, political and social revolutions. It has but recently been replaced, though not yet completely, by other more practical and less demanding forms of education.&lt;ref&gt;Kristeller, "Humanism" in ''The Cambridge History of Renaissance Philosophy'', p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===From Renaissance to modern humanism===

Early humanists saw no conflict between reason and their Christian faith (see [[Christian Humanism]]). They inveighed against the abuses of the Church, but not against the Church itself, much less against religion. For them, the word [[Secularism#Overview|"secular"]] carried no connotations of disbelief{{snds}}that would come later, in the nineteenth century. In the Renaissance to be secular meant simply to be in the world rather than in a monastery. Petrarch frequently admitted that his brother Gherardo's life as a Carthusian monk was superior to his own (although Petrarch himself was in [[Minor Orders]] and was employed by the Church all his life). He hoped that he could do some good by winning earthly glory and praising virtue, inferior though that might be to a life devoted solely to prayer. By embracing a non-theistic philosophic base,&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=146–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the methods of the humanists, combined with their eloquence, would ultimately have a corrosive effect on established authority.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Yet it was from the Renaissance that modern Secular Humanism grew, with the development of an important split between reason and religion. This occurred as the church's complacent authority was exposed in two vital areas. In science, Galileo's support of the Copernican revolution upset the church's adherence to the theories of Aristotle, exposing them as false. In theology, the Dutch scholar Erasmus with his new Greek text showed that the Roman Catholic adherence to Jerome's Vulgate was frequently in error. A tiny wedge was thus forced between reason and authority, as both of them were then understood.&lt;ref&gt;[[Os Guinness]], ''The Dust of Death: A Critique of the Establishment and the Counter Culture and the Proposal for a Third Way'' (Intervarsity Press, 1973) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For some, this meant turning back to the Bible as the source of authority instead of the Catholic Church, for others it was a split from theism altogether. This was the main divisive line between the Reformation and the Renaissance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schaeffer |first1=Francis A. |title=How Should We Then Live? |publisher=Crossway |isbn=978-1581345360 |pages=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dealt with the same basic problems, supported the same science based on reason and empirical research, but had a different set of presuppositions (theistic versus naturalistic).&lt;ref name="How Should We Then Live"/&gt;

===19th and 20th centuries===

The phrase the "religion of humanity" is sometimes attributed to American [[Founding Father]] [[Thomas Paine]], though as yet unattested in his surviving writings. According to Tony Davies: &lt;blockquote&gt;Paine called himself a ''theophilanthropist'', a word combining the Greek for "God", "love", and "humanity", and indicating that while he believed in the existence of a creating intelligence in the universe, he entirely rejected the claims made by and for all existing religious doctrines, especially their miraculous, transcendental and salvationist pretensions. The Parisian "Society of Theophilanthropy" which he sponsored, is described by his biographer as "a forerunner of the ethical and humanist societies that proliferated later" ... [Paine's book] the trenchantly witty ''Age of Reason'' (1793) ... pours scorn on the supernatural pretensions of scripture, combining Voltairean mockery with Paine's own style of taproom ridicule to expose the absurdity of a theology built on a collection of incoherent Levantine folktales.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) pp.{{nbsp}}26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Davies identifies Paine's '' [[The Age of Reason]]'' as "the link between the two major narratives of what [[Jean-François Lyotard]]&lt;ref&gt;In [[The Postmodern Condition|La Condition postmoderne]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls the narrative of legitimation": the rationalism of the 18th-century ''[[Philosophes]]'' and the radical, historically based German 19th-century Biblical criticism of the [[Hegelian]]s [[David Friedrich Strauss]] and [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]. "The first is political, largely French in inspiration, and projects 'humanity as the hero of liberty'. The second is philosophical, German, seeks the totality and autonomy of knowledge, and stresses ''understanding'' rather than freedom as the key to human fulfilment and emancipation. The two themes converged and competed in complex ways in the 19th century and beyond, and between them set the boundaries of its various humanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo homini deus est'' ("The human being  is a god to humanity" or "god is nothing [other than] the human being to himself"), Feuerbach had written.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Humanism'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian novelist Mary Ann Evans, known to the world as [[George Eliot]], translated Strauss's ''Das Leben Jesu'' (''"The Life of Jesus"'', 1846) and Ludwig Feuerbach's ''Das Wesen Christianismus'' ("The Essence of Christianity"). She wrote to a friend:

&lt;blockquote&gt;the fellowship between man and man which has been the principle of development, social and moral, is not dependent on conceptions of what is not man ... the idea of God, so far as it has been a high spiritual influence, is the ideal of goodness entirely human (i.e., an exaltation of the human).&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eliot and her circle, who included her companion [[George Henry Lewes]] (the biographer of [[Goethe]]) and the [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolitionist]] and social theorist [[Harriet Martineau]], were much influenced by the positivism of [[Auguste Comte]], whom Martineau had translated. Comte had proposed an atheistic ''culte'' founded on human principles{{snds}}a secular [[Religion of Humanity]] (which worshiped the dead, since most humans who have ever lived are dead), complete with holidays and liturgy, modeled on the rituals of what was seen as a discredited and dilapidated Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;"Comte's secular religion is no vague effusion of humanistic piety, but a complete system of belief and ritual, with liturgy and sacraments, priesthood and pontiff, all organised around the public veneration of Humanity, the ''Nouveau Grand-Être Suprême'' (New Supreme Great Being), later to be supplemented in a positivist trinity by the ''Grand Fétish'' (the Earth) and the ''Grand Milieu'' (Destiny)". According to Davies (pp. 28–29), Comte's austere and "slightly dispiriting" philosophy of humanity viewed as alone in an indifferent universe (which can only be explained by "positive" science) and with nowhere to turn but to each other, was even more influential in Victorian England than the theories of Charles Darwin or Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Comte's English followers, like Eliot and Martineau, for the most part rejected the full gloomy panoply of his system, they liked the idea of a religion of humanity.

The British Humanistic Religious Association was formed as one of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered Humanist organisations in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership, and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Morain |first1=Lloyd |last2=Morain |first2=Mary |title=Humanism as the Next Step |publisher=Humanist Press |year=2007 |location=Washington, D.C. |page=109 |url=http://aha-files.s3.amazonaws.com/63/226/Hum_as_the_Next_Step.pdf |isbn=978-0931779091 |lccn=97-74611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1877, the word was used pejoratively, apparently for the first time in America, to describe [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]]. Adler, however, did not embrace the term, and instead coined the name "[[Ethical Culture]]" for his new movement {{snds}}a movement which still exists in the now Humanist-affiliated New York Society for Ethical Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysec.org/sitemap/about-ethical-culture/history/ |title=History: New York Society for Ethical Culture |accessdate=6 March 2009 |year=2008 |publisher=New York Society for Ethical Culture }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Ethical Culture Leaders wrote: "Today, the historic identification, Ethical Culture, and the modern description, Ethical Humanism, are used interchangeably."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ethical Culture |publisher=American Ethical Union |url=http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf |accessdate=23 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226081725/http://aeu.org/library/articles/Ethical_Culture.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active in the early 1920s, [[F.C.S. Schiller]] labelled his work "humanism" but for Schiller the term referred to the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] philosophy he shared with [[William James]]. In 1929, [[Charles Francis Potter]] founded the First Humanist Society of New York whose advisory board included [[Julian Huxley]], [[John Dewey]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Thomas Mann]]. Potter was a minister from the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] tradition and in 1930 he and his wife, Clara Cook Potter, published ''Humanism: A New Religion''. Throughout the 1930s, Potter was an advocate of such liberal causes as, [[women’s rights]], access to [[birth control]], "civil divorce laws", and an end to capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stringer-Hye |first=Richard |title=Charles Francis Potter |work=Dictionary of Unitarian and Universalist Biography |publisher=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |url=http://wWorldWarII5.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/charlesfrancispotter.html |accessdate=1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Raymond B. Bragg]], the associate editor of ''The New Humanist'', sought to consolidate the input of [[Leon Milton Birkhead]], [[Charles Francis Potter]], and several members of the Western Unitarian Conference. Bragg asked [[Roy Wood Sellars]] to draft a document based on this information which resulted in the publication of the ''[[Humanist Manifesto]]'' in 1933. Potter's book and the Manifesto became the cornerstones of modern humanism, the latter declaring a new religion by saying, "any religion that can hope to be a synthesising and dynamic force for today must be shaped for the needs of this age. To establish such a religion is a major necessity of the present." It then presented 15 theses of humanism as foundational principles for this new religion.

In 1941, the [[American Humanist Association]] was organised. Noted members of The AHA included [[Isaac Asimov]], who was the president from 1985 until his death in 1992, and writer [[Kurt Vonnegut]], who followed as honorary president until his death in 2007. [[Gore Vidal]] became honorary president in 2009. [[Robert Buckman]] was the head of the association in Canada, and is now an honorary president.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

After World War II, three prominent Humanists became the first directors of major divisions of the United Nations: [[Julian Huxley]] of [[UNESCO]], [[Brock Chisholm]] of the [[World Health Organization]], and [[John Boyd-Orr]] of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html American Humanist Association] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020812090133/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |date=12 August 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, [[American Humanist Association]], along with other groups representing agnostics, atheists, and other freethinkers, joined to create the [[Secular Coalition for America]] which advocates in Washington, D.C., for [[separation of church and state]] and nationally for the greater acceptance of nontheistic Americans. The Executive Director of Secular Coalition for America is Larry T. Decker.

===Scholarly tradition===
====Renaissance humanists====
{{main|Renaissance humanism}}

"Renaissance humanism" is the name later given to a tradition of cultural and educational reform engaged in by civic and ecclesiastical chancellors, book collectors, educators, and writers, who by the late fifteenth century began to be referred to as ''umanisti''{{snds}}"humanists".&lt;ref name=mann/&gt; It developed during the fourteenth and the beginning of the fifteenth centuries, and was a response to the challenge of scholastic university education, which was then dominated by Aristotelian philosophy and logic. [[Scholasticism]] focused on preparing men to be doctors, lawyers or professional theologians, and was taught from approved textbooks in logic, natural philosophy, medicine, law and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Craig W. Kallendorf, introduction to ''Humanist Educational Treatises'', edited and translated by Craig W. Kallendorf (Cambridge, Massachusetts and London England: The I Tatti Renaissance Library, 2002) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; There were important centres of humanism at [[Florence]], [[Naples]], [[Rome]], [[Venice]], [[Mantua]], [[Ferrara]], and [[Urbino]].

Humanists reacted against this utilitarian approach and the narrow pedantry associated with it. They sought to create a citizenry (frequently including women) able to speak and write with eloquence and clarity and thus capable of engaging the civic life of their communities and persuading others to virtuous and prudent actions. This was to be accomplished through the study of the ''[[humanitas|studia humanitatis]]'', today known as the [[humanities]]: grammar, rhetoric, history, poetry and moral philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Early Italian humanism, which in many respects continued the grammatical and rhetorical traditions of the [[Middle Ages]], not merely provided the old [[Trivium]] with a new and more ambitious name (''Studia humanitatis''), but also increased its actual scope, content and significance in the curriculum of the schools and universities and in its own extensive literary production. The ''studia humanitatis'' excluded logic, but they added to the traditional grammar and rhetoric not only history, Greek, and moral philosophy, but also made poetry, once a sequel of grammar and rhetoric, the most important member of the whole group. (Paul Oskar Kristeller, ''Renaissance Thought II: Papers on Humanism and the Arts'' [New York: Harper Torchbooks, 1965], p. 178.)&lt;/blockquote&gt; See also Kristeller's ''Renaissance Thought I'', "Humanism and Scholasticism In the Italian Renaissance", ''Byzantion'' 17 (1944–45):  346–74. Reprinted in ''Renaissance Thought'' (New York: Harper Torchbooks), 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; As a program to revive the cultural{{snds}}and particularly the literary{{snds}}legacy and moral philosophy of classical antiquity, Humanism was a pervasive cultural mode and not the program of a few isolated geniuses like [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]] or [[Erasmus]] as is still sometimes popularly believed.&lt;ref&gt;Vito Giustiniani gives as an example of an out-dated, but still pervasive view, that of Corliss Lamont, who described Renaissance Humanism as, "first and foremost a revolt against the otherworldliness of mediaeval Christianity, a turning away from preoccupation with personal immortality to make the best of life in this world. Renaissance writers like Rabelais and Erasmus gave eloquent voice to this new joy of living and to the sheer exuberance of existence. For the Renaissance the ideal human being was no longer the ascetic monk, but a new type – the universal man  the many-sided personality delighting in every kind of this-earthly achievements. The great Italian artists, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, typified this ideal." (Giustiniani, "Homo, Humanus, and the Meanings of Humanism": 192.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-theistic worldviews===
====Secular humanists====
{{main|Secular humanism}}

[[File:Happyman.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.25|The Humanist "happy human" logo]]

Secular humanism is a comprehensive [[life stance]] or [[world view]] which embraces human [[reason]], [[metaphysical naturalism]], [[altruism|altruistic]] [[morality]] and [[distributive justice]], and consciously rejects [[supernatural]] claims, [[ethical monotheism|theistic]] [[faith]] and [[religiosity]], [[pseudoscience]], and [[superstition]].&lt;ref name="americanhumanist"&gt;{{cite web |last=Edwords |first=Fred |title=What Is Humanism? |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |year=1989 |publisher=American Humanist Association |accessdate=19 August 2009 |quote=Secular Humanism is an outgrowth of eighteenth century enlightenment rationalism and nineteenth century freethought... Secular and Religious Humanists both share the same worldview and the same basic principles... From the standpoint of philosophy alone, there is no difference between the two. It is only in the definition of religion and in the practice of the philosophy that Religious and Secular Humanists effectively disagree. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130233229/http://www.americanhumanist.org/who_we_are/about_humanism/What_is_Humanism |archivedate=30 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }} A decidedly anti-theistic version of secular humanism, however, is developed by Adolf Grünbaum, 'In Defense of Secular Humanism' (1995), in his ''Collected Works'' (edited by Thomas Kupka), vol. I, New York: Oxford University Press 2013, ch. 6 (pp. 115{{ndash}}48)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="humaniststudies"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definitions of humanism (subsection)|publisher=Institute for Humanist Studies|url=http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html |accessdate=16 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070118050402/http://humaniststudies.org/humphil.html|archive-date=18 January 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes referred to as Humanism (with a capital H and no [[grammatical modifier|qualifying]] adjective).

The [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] ([[IHEU]]) is the world union of 117 Humanist, rationalist, [[irreligious]], [[atheistic]], [[Brights movement|Bright]], [[secular]], [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture]], and [[freethought]] organisations in 38 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iheu.org/story/humanist-movement-hits-new-high-membership |title=Humanist movement hits new high in membership. |publisher=iheu.org |date= |accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Happy Human]]" is the official symbol of the IHEU as well as being regarded as a universally recognised symbol for secular humanism.

According to the IHEU's bylaw 5.1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iheu.org/bylaws |title=IHEU's Bylaws |accessdate=5 July 2008 |publisher=International Humanist and Ethical Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Humanism is a democratic and ethical life stance, which affirms that human beings have the [[natural and legal rights|right]] and responsibility to give meaning and shape to their own lives. It stands for the building of a more humane society through an ethic based on human and other natural values in the spirit of reason and free inquiry through human capabilities. It is not [[theism|theistic]], and it does not accept [[supernatural]] views of reality.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Religious humanists====
{{main|Religious humanism}}
"Religious humanists" are non-superstitious people who nevertheless see ethical humanism as their religion, and who seek to integrate (secular) humanist ethical philosophy with congregational [[ritual]]s centred on human needs, interests, and abilities. Though practitioners of religious humanism did not officially organise under the name of "humanism" until the late 19th and early 20th centuries, non-theistic religions paired with human-centred ethical philosophy have a long history. A unified [[Ethical Culture]] movement was first founded in 1876; its founder, [[Felix Adler (Society for Ethical Culture)|Felix Adler]] was a former member of the [[Free Religious Association]], and conceived of Ethical Culture as a new religion that would retain the ethical message at the heart of all religions. Ethical Culture was religious in the sense of playing a defining role in people's lives and addressing issues of ultimate concern. Nowadays religious humanists in the United States are represented by organisations such as the [[American Ethical Union]], and will simply describe themselves as "ethical humanists" or "humanists". Secular humanists and religious humanists organise together as part of larger national and international groupings, and differentiate themselves primarily in their attitude to the promotion of humanist thinking.

Earlier attempts at inventing a secular religious tradition informed the Ethical Culture movement. The [[Cult of Reason]] ({{lang-fr|Culte de la Raison}}) was a religion based on [[deism]] devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]] and their supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the cathedral [[Notre Dame de Paris]] was turned into a "[[Temple of Reason]]" and for a time [[Liberty (goddess)|Lady Liberty]] replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.&lt;ref name="Herrick"&gt;James A. Herrick, "The Making of the New Spirituality", InterVarsity Press, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8308-3279-3}}, p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1850s, [[Auguste Comte]], the Father of Sociology, founded [[Positivism]], a "religion of humanity".&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"&gt;{{cite web | title=Humanism as the Next Step | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html | accessdate=25 June 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614195856/http://www.americanhumanist.org/publications/morain/chapter-8.html |archivedate = 14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the earliest forerunners of contemporary chartered humanist organisations was the Humanistic Religious Association formed in 1853 in London. This early group was democratically organised, with male and female members participating in the election of the leadership and promoted knowledge of the sciences, philosophy, and the arts.&lt;ref name="Humanism as the Next Step"/&gt;

The distinction between so-called "ethical" humanists and "secular" humanists is most pronounced in the United States, although it is becoming less so over time. The philosophical distinction is not reflected at all in Canada, Latin America, Africa, or Asia, or most of Europe. In the UK, where the humanist movement was strongly influenced by Americans in the 19th century, the leading "ethical societies" and "ethical churches" evolved into secular humanist charities (e.g. the British Ethical Union became the British Humanist Association and later [[Humanists UK]]). In Scandinavian countries, "Human-etik" or "[[:no:humanetikk|humanetikk]]" (roughly synonymous with ethical humanism) is a popular strand within humanism, originating from the works of Danish philosopher [[Harald Høffding]]. The Norwegian Humanist Association belongs to this tendency, known as [[Human-Etisk Forbund]] (literally "Human-Ethical League"). Over time, the emphasis on ''human-etisk'' has become less pronounced, and today HEF promotes both "humanisme" and "human-etisk". In Sweden, the main Swedish humanist group [[Humanisterna]] ("Humanists") began as a "human-ethical association", like the Norwegian humanists, before adopting the more prevalent secular humanist model popular in most of Europe. Today the distinction in Europe is mostly superficial.

The modern Buddhist sect Soka Gakkai International practices what has been called "Nichiren Humanism", based on txhe Lotus Sutra's focus on self-development and altruism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seagar |first1=Richard |title=Buddhism In America |date=2012 |publisher=Columbia Uniiversity Press |isbn=978-0-231-15973-9 |page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==

Polemics about humanism have sometimes assumed paradoxical twists and turns. Early 20th century critics such as [[Ezra Pound]], [[T.&amp;nbsp;E. Hulme]], and [[T.&amp;nbsp;S. Eliot]] considered humanism to be sentimental "slop" (Hulme){{Citation needed|date=September 2014}}&lt;!--double check please--&gt; or "an old bitch gone in the teeth" (Pound).&lt;ref&gt;Tony Davies, ''Humanism'' (Routledge, 1997) p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodernism|Postmodern]] critics who are self-described [[antihumanism|anti-humanists]], such as [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Michel Foucault]], have asserted that humanism posits an overarching and excessively abstract notion of humanity or universal [[human nature]], which can then be used as a pretext for imperialism and domination of those deemed somehow less than human. "Humanism fabricates the human as much as it fabricates the nonhuman animal", suggests Timothy Laurie, turning the human into what he calls "a placeholder for a range of attributes that have been considered most virtuous among humans (e.g. rationality, altruism), rather than most commonplace (e.g. hunger, anger)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Becoming-Animal Is A Trap For Humans |first=Timothy |last=Laurie |journal=Deleuze and the Non-Human |year=2015 |url=https://www.academia.edu/10912960}} eds. Hannah Stark and Jon Roffe.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, philosopher [[Kate Soper]]&lt;ref&gt;in ''Humanism and Anti-humanism (Problems of Modern European Thought)'' (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court Press, 1986, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that by faulting humanism for falling short of its own benevolent ideals, anti-humanism thus frequently "secretes a humanist rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Davies (1997) p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, ''Humanism'' (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics "humanist anti-humanists". Critics of antihumanism, most notably [[Jürgen Habermas]], counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Habermas accepts some criticisms leveled at traditional humanism but believes that humanism must be rethought and revised rather than simply abandoned.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like the German philosopher [[Heidegger]] considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German "race" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists.&lt;ref&gt;"The antihhumanist Humanism of Heidegger and the humanist antihumanism of Foucault and Althusser" (Davies [1997]), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century "it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them". For "it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason". Yet, he continues, "it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms."&lt;ref&gt;Davies (1997), pp. 131–32&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humanists, such as [[Corliss Lamont]] or [[Carl Sagan]], hold that humanity must seek for truth through reason and the best observable evidence and endorse [[scientific skepticism]] and the [[scientific method]]. However, they stipulate that decisions about right and wrong must be based on the individual and common good, with no consideration given to metaphysical or supernatural beings. The idea is to engage with what is human.&lt;ref&gt;"Conscience, the sense of right and wrong and the insistent call of one's better, more idealistic, more social-minded self, is a social product. Feelings of right and wrong that at first have their locus within the family gradually develop into a pattern for the tribe or city, then spread to the larger unit of the nation, and finally from the nation to humanity as a whole. Humanism sees no need for resorting to supernatural explanations, or sanctions at any point in the ethical process" ({{Cite book |last=Lamont |first=Corliss |authorlink=Corliss Lamont |title=The Philosophy of Humanism, Eighth Edition |pages=252–53 |publisher=Humanist Press: Amherst, New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-931779-07-3}})&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book |last=Kurtz |first=Paul |title=Humanist manifesto 2000 : a call for a new planetary humanism |year=2000 |publisher=Prometheus Books |location=Amherst, NY |isbn=157392783X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher [[Alfred North Whitehead]] cautioned: "The prophecy of [[Francis Bacon]] has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts".&lt;ref&gt;''Science and the Modern World'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, [1925] 1997) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentientist philosophers criticise humanism for focusing too strongly, sometimes even exclusively, on the human species. They propose [[Sentientism]] as an extension of humanism that grants degrees of moral consideration to all [[Sentience|sentient]] beings - those capable of experiencing. Sentient beings include humans and most non-human animals and could potentially include artificial or alien intelligences.

== Humanistic psychology ==
{{main|Humanistic psychology}}

Humanistic psychology is a psychological perspective which rose to prominence in the mid-20th century in response to [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychoanalytic theory and [[B. F. Skinner]]'s [[Behaviorism]]. The approach emphasizes an individual's inherent drive towards [[self-actualization]] and creativity.  Psychologists [[Carl Rogers]] and [[Abraham Maslow]] introduced a positive, humanistic psychology in response to what they viewed as the overly pessimistic view of psychoanalysis in the early 1960s. Other sources include the philosophies of [[existentialism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4074">'''Hydroinformatics''' is a branch of [[Information science|informatics]] which concentrates on the application of [[information technology|information and communications technologies]] (ICTs) in addressing the increasingly serious problems of the equitable and efficient use of [[water]] for many different purposes. Growing out of the earlier discipline of [[computational hydraulics]], the numerical [[simulation]] of water flows and related processes remains a mainstay of hydroinformatics, which encourages a focus not only on the technology but on its application in a social context. 

On the technical side, in addition to [[computational hydraulics]], hydroinformatics has a strong interest in the use of techniques originating in the so-called [[artificial intelligence]] community, such as [[artificial neural networks]] or recently [[support vector machines]] and [[genetic programming]]. These might be used with large collections of observed data for the purpose of [[data mining]] for knowledge discovery, or with data generated from an existing, physically based model in order to generate a computationally efficient emulator of that model for some purpose.

Hydroinformatics recognises the inherently social nature of the problems of water management and of decision making processes, and strives to understand the social processes by which technologies are brought into use. Since the problems of water management are most severe in the majority world, while the resources to obtain and develop technological solutions are concentrated in the hands of the minority, the need to examine these social processes are particularly acute.

Hydroinformatics draws on and integrates [[hydraulics]], [[hydrology]], [[environmental engineering]] and many other disciplines. It sees application at all points in the [[water cycle]] from atmosphere to ocean, and in artificial interventions in that cycle such as urban drainage and water supply systems. It provides support for decision making at all levels from governance and policy through management to operations.

Hydroinformatics has a growing world-wide community of researchers and practitioners, and postgraduate programmes in Hydroinformatics are offered by many leading institutions. The [[Journal of Hydroinformatics]] provides a specific outlet for Hydroinformatics research,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwaponline.com/jh/toc.htm IWA Publishing - Journal of Hydroinformatics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the community gathers to exchange ideas at the biennial conferences. These activities are coordinated by the joint [[IAHR]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iahr.org/ International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Water Association|IWA]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwa-network.org/ IWA HomePage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Association of Hydrological Sciences|IAHS]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://iahs.info/ IAHS-AISH&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.iwahq.org/Home/Networks/Specialist_groups/List_of_groups/Hydroinformatics/ Hydroinformatics Section].

There is a growing need for professionals and managers to appreciate and work with these new technologies and tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1496">'''Héctor Febres''' (died 10 December 2007) was an Argentine [[coastguard]] officer who died while awaiting [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] after being [[Trial|tried]] for torture. 

Febres was accused of having tortured dissidents during Argentina's [[Dirty War]] period. Thousands of dissidents were tortured at the Navy School of Mechanics, known as [[Navy Petty-Officers School of Mechanics|ESMA]], for seven years beginning in 1976.  Febrés was accused of torturing prisoners at the ESMA, and the prosecution had asked for [[life imprisonment]].  Febres was found dead in his cell from apparent cyanide poisoning days before he was to be sentenced.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/7145040.stm] BBC: Argentine cyanide family arrested 				, 14 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; His wife and adult children, and two guards, were arrested in connection with his death; they had dined with him the previous evening. It was reported that "Febres had stories to tell and many suspected he might talk", and police were investigating whether he was murdered or killed himself; prosecution lawyers were convinced he was silenced by people linked to the military. Febres would have been the first person from the ESMA to be sentenced.

[[File:In Situ Bioremediation.png|thumb|In Situ Bioremediation]]
[[Bioremediation]] is the process of decontaminating polluted sites through the usage of either endogenous or external [[microorganism]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=7R7VX9dLV8oC&amp;pg=PR1&amp;dq=in+situ+bioremediation#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=Rittmann|first=Bruce E.|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780815513483|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[In situ#Environmental remediation|In situ]] is a term utilized within a variety of fields meaning "on site" and refers to the location of an event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=situs2|title=Charlton T.

Bioremediation is used to neutralize pollutants including [[Hydrocarbon]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, chlorinated compounds, nitrates, toxic metals and other [[pollutant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s through a variety of chemical mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Microorganism used in the process of bioremediation can either be implanted or cultivated within the site through the application of fertilizers and other nutrients. Common polluted sites targeted by bioremediation are groundwater/aquifers and polluted soils. Aquatic [[ecosystem]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s  affected by oil spills have also shown improvement through the application of bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perelo|first=Louisa Wessels|date=15 May 2010|title=Review: In situ and bioremediation of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389409020792|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=177|issue=1–3|pages=81–89|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.12.090|pmid=20138425}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable cases being the [[Deepwater Horizon]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-microbes-clean-up-oil-spills/|title=Slick Solution: How Microbes Will Clean Up the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|last=Biello|first=David|date=|work=Scientific American|access-date=17 March 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; oil spill in 2010 and the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Atlas|first=Ronald M.|last2=Hazen|first2=Terry C.|date=15 August 2011|title=Oil Biodegradation and Bioremediation: A Tale of the Two Worst Spills in U.S. History|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=16|pages=6709–6715|doi=10.1021/es2013227|issn=0013-936X|pmc=3155281|pmid=21699212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two variations of bioremediation exist defined by the location where the process occurs. Ex situ bioremediation occurs at a location separate from the contaminated site and involves the translocation of the contaminated material. In situ occurs within the site of contamination&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In situ bioremediation can further be categorized by the metabolism occurring, [[Cellular respiration#Aerobic respiration|aerobic]] and [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]], and by the level of human involvement.
__TOC__

==History==
The Sun Oil pipeline spill in Ambler, [[Pennsylvania]] spurred the first commercial usage of in situ bioremediation in 1972 to remove hydrocarbons from contaminated sites.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/civil-and-environmental-engineering/1-34-waste-containment-and-remediation-technology-spring-2004/lecture-notes/lecture12.pdf|title=Lecture 12 Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=Online Course Work Massachusetts Institute of Technology|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A patent was filed in 1974 by Richard Raymond, Reclamation of Hydrocarbon Contaminated Ground Waters, which provided the basis for the commercialization of in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Classifications of In situ Bioremediation ==

===Accelerated===
Accelerated in situ bioremediation is defined when a specified microorganism is targeted for growth through the application of either nutrients or an electron donor to the contaminated site. Within aerobic metabolism the nutrient added to the soil can be solely Oxygen. Anaerobic in situ bioremediation often requires a variety of electron donors or acceptors such as [[benzoate]] and lactate.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bioprocess.pnnl.gov/resour/rt3d.in.situ.bioremediation.htm#advant|title=In Situ Bioremediation|last=|first=|date=|website=bioprocess.pnnl.gov|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides nutrients, microorganisms can also be introduced directly to the site within accelerated in situ bioremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ellis|first=David E.|last2=Lutz|first2=Edward J.|last3=Odom|first3=J. Martin|last4=Buchanan|first4=Ronald J.|last5=Bartlett|first5=Craig L.|last6=Lee|first6=Michael D.|last7=Harkness|first7=Mark R.|last8=DeWeerd|first8=Kim A.|date=1 June 2000|title=Bioaugmentation for Accelerated In Situ Anaerobic Bioremediation|journal=Environmental Science &amp; Technology|volume=34|issue=11|pages=2254–2260|doi=10.1021/es990638e|issn=0013-936X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of extraneous microorganisms to a site is termed [[bioaugmentation]] and is used when a particular microorganism is effective at degrading the pollutant at the site and is not found either naturally or at a high enough population to be effective.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Accelerated in situ bioremediation is utilized when the desired population of microorganisms within a site is not naturally present at a sufficient level to effectively degrade the pollutants. It also is used when the required nutrients within the site are either not at a concentration sufficient to support growth or are unavailable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

====Raymond Process====
The Raymond Process is a type of accelerated in situ bioremediation that was developed by Richard Raymond and involves the introduction of nutrients and electron acceptors to a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This process is primarily used to treat polluted groundwater. In the Raymond process a loop system is created. Contaminated [[Groundwater]] from downstream of the groundwater flow is pumped to the surface and infused with nutrients and an electron donor, often oxygen. This treated water is then pumped back down below the [[water table]] upstream of where it was originally taken. This process introduces nutrients and electron donors into the site allowing for the growth of a determined microbial population.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=====Oxygen Injection=====
In contaminated sites where the desired microbial metabolism is aerobic the introduction of oxygen to the site can be used to increase the population of targeted microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/techfocus/default.focus/sec/Bioremediation/cat/Aerobic_Bioremediation_(Direct)/|title=CLU-IN {{!}} Technologies &gt; Remediation &gt; About Remediation Technologies &gt; Bioremediation &gt; Aerobic Bioremediation (Direct)|last=|first=|date=|website=clu-in.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The injection of Oxygen can occur through a variety of processes. Oxygen can be injected into the subsurface through injection wells. It can also be introduced through an injection gallery. The presence of oxygen within a site is often the limiting factor when determining the time frame and efficacy of a proposed in situ bioremediation process.

====== Ozone Injection ======
Ozone injected into the subsurface can also be a means of introducing oxygen into a contaminated site.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Despite being a strong oxidizing agent and potentially having a toxic effect on subsurface microbial populations, ozone can be an efficient means of spreading oxygen throughout a site due to its high solubility.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Within twenty minutes after being injected into the subsurface, fifty percent of the ozone will have decomposed to Oxygen.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; Ozone is commonly introduced to the soil in either a dissolved or gaseous state.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

=====Accelerated Anaerobic In situ Bioremediation=====
Within accelerated anaerobic in situ bioremediation electron donors and acceptors are introduced into a contaminated site in order to increase the population of anaerobic microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Monitored Natural Attenuation (MNA)===
Monitored Natural Attenuation is in situ bioremediation that occurs with little to no human intervention.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://clu-in.org/download/Citizens/a_citizens_guide_to_monitored_natural_attenuation.pdf|title=A Citizen's Guide to Monitored Natural Attenuation|last=|first=|date=September 2012|website=Contaminated Sites Clean up Information|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process relies on the natural microbial populations sustained within the contaminated sites to over time reduce the contaminants to a desired level.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During monitored natural attenuation the site is monitored in order to track the progress of the bioremediation.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Monitored natural attenuation is used in sites where the source of contamination is no longer present, often after other more active types of in situ bioremediation have been conducted.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Uses of In situ bioremediation==
===Hydrocarbon Degradation===

Naturally occurring within the soil are microbial populations that utilize [[hydrocarbons]] as a source of energy and Carbon.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.bren.ucsb.edu/~keller/courses/esm223/SuthersanCh05Bioremediation.pdf|title=IN SITU BIOREMEDIATION|last=Suthersan|first=Susan|date=1999|website=University of California Barbara|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upwards to twenty percent of microbial soil populations have the ability to metabolize hydrocarbons.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These populations can through either accelerated or natural monitored attenuation be utilized to neutralize within the soil hydrocarbon pollutants. The metabolic mode of hydrocarbon remediation is primarily aerobic.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The end products of the remediation for hydrocarbons are Carbon Dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbons vary in ease of degradation based on their structure. Long chain aliphatic carbons are the most effectively degraded. Short chained, branched, and quaternary aliphatic hydrocarbons are less effectively degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Alkene degradation is dependent on the saturation of the chain with saturated alkenes being more readily degraded.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Large numbers of microbes with the ability to metabolize aromatic hydrocarbons are present within the soil. Aromatic hydrocarbons are also susceptible to being degraded through anaerobic metabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hydrocarbon metabolism is an important facet of in situ bioremediation due to the severity of petroleum spills around the world. Polynuclear aromatic carbons susceptibility to degradation is related to the number of aromatic rings within the compound.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Compounds with two or three rings are degraded at an effective rate, compounds possessing four or more rings can be more resilient to bioremediation efforts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Degradation of polynuclear aromatic carbons with less than four rings is accomplished by various aerobic microbes present in the soil. For larger compounds the only metabolic mode that has shown to be effective is [[cometabolism]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The fungus genus [[Phanerochaete]] under anaerobic conditions has species with the ability to metabolize some polynuclear aromatic carbons utilizing a peroxidase enzyme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Syed|first=Khajamohiddin|last2=Yadav|first2=Jagjit S.|date=1 November 2012|title=P450 monooxygenases (P450ome) of the model white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium|journal=Critical Reviews in Microbiology|volume=38|issue=4|pages=339–363|doi=10.3109/1040841X.2012.682050|issn=1040-841X|pmc=3567848|pmid=22624627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chlorinated Compounds===
====Chlorinated Aliphatic Compounds====

A variety of metabolic modes exist capable of degrading chlorinated [[aliphatic compounds]]. Anaerobic reduction, oxidation of the compound, and cometabolism under aerobic conditions are the three main metabolic modes utilized by microorganisms to degrade chlorinated aliphatic compounds.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Organisms that can readily metabolize chlorinated aliphatic compounds are not common in the environment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; One and two carbons that have little chlorination are the compounds most effectively metabolized by soil microbial populations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The degradation of chlorinated aliphatic compounds is most often performed through cometabolism.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
[[File:Reacciotriclorur.png|thumb|Synthesis and general structure of polychlorinated byphenyls.]]

====Chlorinated Aromatic Hydrocarbons====

Chlorinated [[Aromaticity|aromatic]] hydrocarbons are resistant to bioremediation and many microorganisms lack the ability to degrade the compounds. Chlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons are most often degraded through a process of reductive dechlorination under anaerobic conditions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; [[Polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) are primarily degraded through cometabolism. There are also some fungi that can degrade the compounds as well.  Studies show an increase in PCB degradation when biphenyl is added to the site due to cometabolic affects the enzymes used to degrade [[biphenyl]] have on PCBs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==Benefits==
Due to in situ bioremediation taking place at the site of contamination there is a lessened risk of cross contamination as opposed to ex situ bioremediation where the polluted material is transported to other sites. In situ bioremediation can also have lower costs and a higher rate of decontamination than ex situ bioremediation.

'''Lindow Man''', also known as '''Lindow&amp;nbsp;II''' and (in jest) as '''Pete Marsh''', is the preserved [[bog body]] of a man discovered in a [[peat]] [[bog]] at [[Lindow Moss]] near [[Wilmslow]] in [[Cheshire]], [[North West England]]. The human remains were found on 1 August 1984 by commercial peat-cutters. Lindow Man is not the only bog body to have been found in the moss; [[Lindow Woman]] was discovered the year before, and other body parts have also been recovered. The find, described as "one of the most significant archaeological discoveries of the 1980s",&lt;ref name="BM press release"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/news_and_press_releases/press_releases/2008/lindow_man.aspx |title=British Museum announces year long loan of Lindow Man to Manchester |publisher=[[British Museum]] |year=2008 |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused a media sensation. It helped invigorate study of British bog bodies, which had previously been neglected in comparison to those found in the rest of Europe.

At the time of death, Lindow Man was a healthy male in his mid-20s, and he may have been someone of high status, as his body shows little evidence of heavy or rough work. There has been debate over the reason for Lindow Man's death, for the nature of his demise was violent, perhaps ritualistic; after a last meal of charred bread, Lindow Man was strangled, hit on the head, and his throat cut. Dating the body has proven problematic, but it is thought that Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss, face down, some time between 2 BC and 119&amp;nbsp;AD, in either the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] or [[Roman Britain|Romano-British]] period. The recovered body has been preserved by [[freeze-drying]] and is on permanent display at the [[British Museum]], although it occasionally travels to other venues such as the [[Manchester Museum]].

==Background==

===Lindow Moss===
{{Main|Lindow Common}}
Lindow Moss is a peat bog in Lindow, an area of Wilmslow, Cheshire, which has been used as [[common land]] since the [[medieval]] period. It formed after the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]], one of many such peat bogs in north-east Cheshire and the [[River Mersey|Mersey basin]] that formed in hollows caused by melting ice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995a|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations have not yet discovered settlement or agricultural activity around the edge of Lindow Moss that would have been contemporary with Lindow Man; however, analysis of pollen in the peat suggests there was some cultivation in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995a|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once covering over {{convert|600|ha|acre}}, the bog has now shrunk to a tenth of its original size. It is a dangerous place; an 18th-century writer recorded people drowning there. For centuries the peat from the bog was used as fuel, and it continued to be extracted until the 1980s, by which time the process had been mechanised.&lt;ref name="Brothwell13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindow Moss is a [[Bog#Raised bog|lowland raised mire]]; this type of peat bog often produces the best preserved bog bodies, allowing more detailed analysis. Lowland raised mires occur mainly in northern England and extend south to the Midlands. Lindow Man is one of 27&amp;nbsp;bodies to be recovered from such areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995b|p=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lindow Woman===
{{Main|Lindow Woman}}
On 13 May 1983, two peat workers at Lindow Moss, Andy Mould and Stephen Dooley, noticed an unusual object—about the size of a football—on the elevator taking peat to the shredding machine. They removed the object for closer inspection, joking that it was a dinosaur egg. Once the peat had been removed, their discovery turned out to be a decomposing, incomplete human head with one eye and some hair intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forensics identified the skull as belonging to a European woman, probably aged 30–50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner 13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995a|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police initially thought the skull was that of Malika Reyn-Bardt, who had disappeared in 1960 and was the subject of an ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name="Brothwell12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in prison on another charge, her husband, Peter Reyn-Bardt, had boasted that he had killed his wife and buried her in the back garden of their bungalow, which was on the edge of the area of mossland where peat was being dug. The garden was examined but no body was recovered there. When Reyn-Bardt was confronted with the discovery of the skull from Lindow Moss, he confessed to the murder of his wife.&lt;ref name="Turner 13"/&gt; It was later [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]], revealing it to be nearly 2,000&amp;nbsp;years old. "Lindow Woman", as it became known, dated from around 210&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Brothwell12"/&gt; This emerged shortly before Reyn-Bardt went to trial, but he was convicted on the evidence of his confession.&lt;ref name="Turner 13"/&gt;

==Discovery==
[[Image:Lindow Moss 2006.jpg|thumb|The area of Lindow Moss where Lindow Man was discovered]]
A year later a further discovery was made at Lindow Moss, just {{convert|820|ft}} south-west of the Lindow Woman. On 1 August 1984, Andy Mould, who had been involved in the discovery of Lindow Woman, took what he thought was a piece of wood off the elevator of the peat-shredding machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He threw the object at Eddie Slack, his workmate. When it hit the ground, peat fell off the object and revealed it to be a human foot. The police were called and the foot was taken away for examination.&lt;ref name="Brothwell13"/&gt; [[Rick Turner (archaeologist)|Rick Turner]], the Cheshire [[County Archaeologist]], was notified of the discovery and succeeded in finding the rest of the body,&lt;ref name="Brothwell 1986 14"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became known as Lindow Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some skin had been exposed and had started to decay, so to prevent further deterioration of the body, it was re-covered with peat. The complete excavation of the block containing the remains was performed on 6 August. Until it could be dated, it was moved to the [[Macclesfield]] [[East Cheshire NHS Trust|District General Hospital]] for storage.&lt;ref name="Brothwell 1986 14"/&gt; As the body of Malika Reyn-Bardt had still not been found, it was thought possible the body might be hers, until it was determined to be male, and radiocarbon dated.&lt;ref name="Turner 13"/&gt; The owners of the land on which Lindow Man was found donated the body to the British Museum, and on 21 August it was transported to London.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, the body was dubbed "Pete Marsh" (a pun on "peat marsh") by [[Middlesex Hospital]] radiologists, a name subsequently adopted by local journalists, as was the similar "Pete Bogg" (a pun on "peat bog").&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stead|Bourke|Brothwell|1986|pp=12,&amp;nbsp;16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Connolly 17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Connolly|1985|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The find was announced to the press during the second week of investigation.&lt;ref name="Joy 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the best preserved bog body found in Britain, its discovery caused a domestic media sensation and received global coverage. Sparking excitement in the country's archaeological community, who had long expected such a find, it was hailed as one of the most important archaeological discoveries of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="BM press release"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Connolly|1985|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Q.E.D. (BBC TV series)|''Q.E.D.'']] documentary about Lindow Man broadcast by the [[BBC]] in 1985 attracted 10&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="Joy 12"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindow Man's official name is Lindow&amp;nbsp;II, as there are other finds from the area: Lindow&amp;nbsp;I (Lindow Woman)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|Scaife|1995|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a human skull, Lindow&amp;nbsp;III to a "fragmented headless body", and Lindow&amp;nbsp;IV to the upper thigh of an adult male, possibly that of Lindow Man.&lt;ref name="British museum"&gt;{{citation |title=Lindow Man |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/l/lindow_man.aspx |publisher=[[British Museum]] |accessdate=28 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623055326/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_prb/l/lindow_man.aspx |archivedate=23 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the discovery of Lindow Man, there were no further archaeological excavations at Lindow Moss until 1987. A large piece of skin was found by workmen on the elevator on 6 February 1987. On this occasion, the police left the investigation to the archaeologists. Over 70&amp;nbsp;pieces were found, constituting Lindow&amp;nbsp;III. Although the bone was not as well preserved as that of Lindow Man, the other tissues survived in better condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995a|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final discovery was that of Lindow&amp;nbsp;IV on 14 June 1988. Part of a left leg and buttocks were found on the elevator, from a site just {{convert|50|ft}} west of where Lindow Man was found. Nearly three months later, on 12 September, a right thigh was discovered in the peat on the bucket of a digger. The proximity of the discovery sites, coupled with the fact that the remains were shown to come from an adult male, means that Lindow&amp;nbsp;IV is probably part of Lindow Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995a|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remains and investigation==
[[File:Lindow Man 02.jpg|thumb|Lindow Man's right foot]]
[[File:Lindow Man 04.JPG|thumb|Lindow Man's face]]
Lindow Man marked the first discovery in Britain of a well-preserved bog body; its condition was comparable to that of [[Grauballe Man]] and [[Tollund Man]] from [[Denmark]]. Before Lindow Man was found, it was estimated that 41&amp;nbsp;bog bodies had been found in England and Wales and 15 in Scotland. Encouraged by the discovery of Lindow Man, a gazetteer was compiled, which revealed a far higher number of bog bodies: over 85 in England and Wales and over 36 in Scotland. Prior to the discovery of the bodies in Lindow Moss, British bog bodies had been a relatively neglected subject compared to European examples. The interest caused by Lindow Man led to more in-depth research of accounts of discoveries in bogs since the 17th&amp;nbsp;century; by 1995, the numbers had changed to 106 in England and Wales and 34 in Scotland. The remains covered a large time frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995b|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In life, Lindow Man would have measured between 5'6" and 5'8" (1.68 and 1.73&amp;nbsp;m) tall and weighed about {{convert|132|lb|kg}}. It was possible to ascertain that his age at death was around the mid-20s. The body retains a trimmed beard, moustache, and sideburns of brown hair, as well as healthy teeth with no visible cavities, and manicured fingernails, indicating he did little heavy or rough work.{{refn|Lindow Man's hair is currently red due to chemical changes caused by the bog in which he was buried; however, his hair was probably originally dark brown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=nb}} Apart from a fox-fur armband, Lindow Man was discovered completely naked.&lt;ref name="RB456"&gt;{{Harvnb|Renfrew|Bahn|2006|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he died, Lindow Man was suffering from slight [[osteoarthritis]] and an infestation of [[whipworm]] and [[Ascaris lumbricoides|maw worm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Renfrew|Bahn|2006|pp=456–457}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of decalcification of the bones and pressure from the peat under which Lindow Man was buried, his skull was distorted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1995|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some preserved human remains may contain DNA, peat bogs such as Lindow Moss are generally poor for such a purpose, and it is unlikely that DNA could be recovered from Lindow Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1995|p=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindow Man and Lindow&amp;nbsp;III were found to have elevated levels of copper on their skin. The cause for this was uncertain as there could have been natural causes, although a study by Pyatt ''et al.'' proposed that the bodies may have been painted with a copper-based pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pyatt|Beaumont|Lacy|Magilton|1991|pp=69–70}}, referenced in {{Harvnb|Cowell|Craddock|1995|p=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this, skin samples were taken from places likely to be painted and tested against samples from areas where painting was unlikely. It was found that the copper content of the skin of the torso was higher than the control areas, suggesting that the theory of Pyatt ''et al.'' may have been correct. However, the conclusion was ambiguous as the overall content was above that expected of a male, and variations across the body may have been due to environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cowell|Craddock|1995|pp=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, green deposits were found in the hair, originally thought to be a copper-based pigment used for decoration, but it was later found to be the result of a reaction between the [[keratin]] in the hair and the acid of the peat bog.&lt;ref name="RB456"/&gt;

[[File:Lindow Man reconstructed face.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The reconstructed face of Lindow Man. For the process, a replica of his skull was created from radiographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prag|Neave|1997|pp=157–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.rn-ds-partnership.com/Reconstruction/lindow.html |title=Lindow Man |publisher=RN-DS Partnership |accessdate=9 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715191441/http://www.rn-ds-partnership.com/Reconstruction/lindow.html |archivedate=15 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Dating Lindow Man is problematic as samples from the body and surrounding peat have produced dates spanning a 900-year period. Although the peat encasing Lindow Man has been [[radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dated]] to about 300&amp;nbsp;BC, Lindow Man himself has a different date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early tests at different laboratories returned conflicting dates for the body; later tests suggested a date between 2&amp;nbsp;BC and 119&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name="Joy 23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Buckland 47"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckland|1995|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been a tendency to ascribe the body to the [[Iron Age]] period rather than Roman due to the interpretation that Lindow Man's death may have been a ritual sacrifice or execution.&lt;ref name="Buckland 47"/&gt; Explanations for why the peat in which he was found is much older have been sought. Archaeologist P.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Buckland suggests that as the stratigraphy of the peat appears undisturbed, Lindow Man may have been deposited into a pool that was already some 300&amp;nbsp;years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buckland|1995|pp=49–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Geographer K.&amp;nbsp;E.&amp;nbsp;Barber has argued against this hypothesis, saying that pools at Lindow Moss would have been too shallow, and suggests that the peat may have been peeled back to allow the burial and then replaced, leaving the stratigraphy apparently undisturbed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barber|1995|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindow Man's last meal was preserved in his stomach and intestines and was analysed in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holden|1986|pp=116–125}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was hoped that investigations into the contents of the stomach would shed light on the contemporary diet, as was the case with Grauballe Man and Tollund Man in the 1950s. The analysis of the contents of the digestive system of bog bodies had become one of the principal endeavours of investigating such remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Holden|1995|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of the grains present revealed his diet to be mostly of [[cereal]]s. He probably ate slightly charred bread, although the burning may have had ritual significance rather than being an accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=90,&amp;nbsp;94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[mistletoe]] pollen was also found in the stomach, indicating that Lindow Man died in March or April.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=95–96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dash"&gt;Mike Dash, "The bodies in the bogs." [https://mikedashhistory.com/2016/09/04/the-bodies-in-the-bogs// A Blast From the Past, 4 September 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the conclusions of the study was that the people buried in Lindow Moss may have had a less varied diet than their European counterparts.&lt;ref name="Brothwell 1995 101"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1995|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jody Joy, curator of the Iron Age collection at the [[British Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/staff/prehistory_and_europe/jody_joy.aspx |title=Jody Joy |publisher=British Museum |accessdate=3 July 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107114808/http://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/staff/prehistory_and_europe/jody_joy.aspx |archivedate=7 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance of Lindow Man lies more in how he lived rather than how he died, as the circumstances surrounding his demise may never be fully established.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jan/28/archaeology.forensicscience |title=First-century Lindow Man goes back to his roots |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |date=28 January 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Lindow man top of head.JPG|thumb|right|The top of the Lindow Man's head. The V-shaped cut can be seen at the lower centre.]]
As the peat was cleaned off the body in the laboratory, it became clear that Lindow Man had suffered a violent death. The injuries included a V-shaped, {{convert|3.5|cm|in|adj=on}} cut on top of his head; a possible laceration at the back of the head, ligature marks on the neck where a sinew cord was found, a possible wound on the right side of the neck, a possible stab wound in the upper right chest, a broken neck, and a fractured rib. [[Xeroradiography]] revealed that the blow on top of the head (causing the V-shaped cut) was caused by a relatively blunt object; it had fractured the skull and driven fragments into the brain.  Swelling along the edges of the wound indicated that Lindow Man had lived after being struck. The blow, possibly from a small axe, would have caused unconsciousness, but Lindow Man could have survived for several hours afterwards. The ligature marks on the neck were caused by tightening the sinew cord found around his neck, possibly a garrotte or necklace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not possible to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration on the back of the skull.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|pp=39, 42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p= 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|pp=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The broken neck would have proven the fatal injury, whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head.&lt;ref name="Joy 44"&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Archaeologist [[Don Brothwell]] considers that many of the older bodies need re-examining with modern techniques, such as those used in the analysis of Lindow Man. The study of bog bodies, including these found in Lindow Moss, has contributed to a wider understanding of well-preserved human remains, helping to develop new methods in analysis and investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1995|pp=100–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of sophisticated techniques, such as [[X-ray computed tomography|computer tomography (CT) scans]], has marked the investigation of the Lindow bodies as particularly important. Such scans allow the reconstruction of the body and internal examination.&lt;ref name="Brothwell 1995 101"/&gt; Of the 27&amp;nbsp;bodies recovered from lowland raised mires in England and Wales, only those from Lindow Moss and the remains of [[Worsley Man]] have survived, together with a shoe from another body. The remains have a date range from the early 1st to the 4th&amp;nbsp;centuries. Investigation into the other bodies relies on contemporary descriptions of the discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Turner|1995b|pp=111, 114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical evidence allows a general reconstruction of how Lindow Man was killed, although some details are debated, but it does not explain why he was killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North West England, there is little evidence for religious or ritual activity in the Iron Age period. What evidence does survive is usually in the form of artefacts recovered from peat bogs.&lt;ref name="HB 55-56"&gt;{{Harvnb|Hodgson|Brennand|2006|pp=55–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Iron Age burials in the region often took the form of a crouched [[inhumation]], sometimes with personal ornaments. Although dated to the mid-1st century&amp;nbsp;AD, the type of burial of Lindow Man was more common in the pre-historic period.&lt;ref name="Philpott 79"&gt;{{Harvnb|Philpott|2006|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter half of the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, scholars widely believed that bog bodies demonstrating injuries to the neck or head area were examples of ritual sacrifice. Bog bodies were associated with Germanic and Celtic cultures, specifically relating to head worship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Briggs|1995|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Brothwell, Lindow Man is one of the most complex examples of "[[Overkill (term)|overkill]]" in a bog body, and possibly has ritual meaning as it was "extravagant" for a straightforward murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|pp=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists John Hodgson and Mark Brennand suggest that bog bodies may have been related to religious practice, although there is division in the academic community over this issue.&lt;ref name="HB 55-56"/&gt; In the case of Lindow Man, scholars debate whether the killing was murder or done as part of ritual.&lt;ref name="Philpott 79"/&gt; Anne Ross, an expert on Iron Age religion, proposed that the death was an example of human sacrifice and that the "[[threefold death|triple death]]" (throat cut, strangled, and hit on the head) was an offering to several different gods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wide date range for Lindow Man's death (2&amp;nbsp;BC to 119&amp;nbsp;AD) means he may have met his demise after the Romans conquered northern England in the 60s&amp;nbsp;AD. As the Romans outlawed human sacrifice, such timing would open up other possibilities.&lt;ref name="Joy 23"/&gt; This conclusion was emphasised by historian Ronald Hutton, who challenged the interpretation of sacrificial death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Connolly suggests that as Lindow Man was found naked, he could have been the victim of a violent robbery.&lt;ref name="Connolly 17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Joy 44"/&gt;

Joy said,
"The jury really is still out on these bodies, whether they were aristocrats, priests, criminals, outsiders, whether they went willingly to their deaths or whether they were executed&amp;nbsp;– but Lindow was a very remote place in those days, an unlikely place for an ambush or a murder".&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

==Conservation==
[[File:Lindow Man, British Museum.jpg|thumb|Lindow Man on display at the British Museum in 1996.]] Environment and situation are the crucial factors that determine how corpses decay. For instance, corpses will decay differently depending on the weather, the way they are buried, and the medium in which they are buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers|last = Roach|first = Mary|publisher = |year = 2003|isbn = 978-0-393-32482-2|location = New York|pages = 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peat slows the decay of corpses. It was feared that, once Lindow Man was removed from that environment, which had preserved the body for nearly 2,000&amp;nbsp;years, the remains would rapidly start to deteriorate, so steps were taken to ensure preservation. After rejecting methods that had been used to maintain the integrity of other bog bodies, such as the "pit-tanning" used on Grauballe Man, which took a year and a half, scientists settled on freeze-drying. In preparation, the body was covered in a solution of 15% [[polyethylene glycol]] 400 and 85% water to prevent its becoming distorted. The body was then frozen solid and the ice vaporised to ensure Lindow Man did not shrink. Afterwards, Lindow Man was put in a specially constructed display case to [[HVAC|control the environment]], maintaining the temperature at {{convert|20|°C|°F}} and the humidity at 55%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Brothwell|1986|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Joy|2009|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/conserving_the_lindow_man.aspx|title=Conserving the Lindow Man|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=12 November 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090514082439/http://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/article_index/c/conserving_the_lindow_man.aspx|archivedate=14 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lindow Man is held in the [[British Museum]]. Before the remains were transferred there, people from North West England launched an unsuccessful campaign to keep the body in Manchester.&lt;ref name="rest in peat"&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2008/apr/28/heritage |last=Hector |first=Russell |title=Rest in peat |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=28 April 2008 |accessdate=3 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bog body has been on temporary display in other venues: at the [[Manchester Museum]] on three occasions, April to {{Nowrap|December 1987}}, March to {{Nowrap|September 1991}},&lt;ref name="BM press release"/&gt; and {{Nowrap|April 2008}} to {{Nowrap|April 2009}}; and at the [[Great North Museum]] in Newcastle from August to {{Nowrap|November 2009}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=808672&amp;partid=1 |title=Lindow Man |publisher=[[British Museum]] |accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2008–09 Manchester display, titled ''Lindow Man: A Bog Body Mystery Exhibition at the Manchester Museum'', won the category "Best Archaeological Innovation" in the 2010 British Archaeological Awards, run by the [[Council for British Archaeology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.britarch.ac.uk/awards/ |title=British Archaeological Awards |publisher=[[Council for British Archaeology]] |date=19 July 2010 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have complained that, by museum display of the remains, the body of Lindow Man has been objectified rather than treated with the respect due the dead. [[Emma Restall Orr]], a [[Neo-druidism|neo-druid]], has questioned whether the body should be displayed at all. This is part of a wider discussion about the scientific treatment of human remains and museum researchers and archaeologists using them as information sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/places+to+go/north+west/manchester/art44192 |title=Manchester Prepares For The Appearance Of Lindow Man |publisher=[[Culture24]] |date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lucas Barrett.jpg|thumb]]
'''Lucas Barrett''' (14 November 1837 – 19 December 1862) was an English [[natural history|naturalist]] and [[geologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P0277.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030930085200/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/isaar/GB_0237_NAHSTE_P0277.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 September 2003 |accessdate=18 February 2012 |title=Barrett, Lucas – 1837–1862: geologist and naturalist }}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Barrett, Lucas}} which in turn cites the obituary by S. P. Woodward in ''Geologist'' (February 1863), p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;br&gt;- Death given as 19 December in ''The Reader'', Volume 1, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrett was born in London and educated at [[University College School]]. He went to Ebersdorf, near [[Neundorf bei Lobenstein|Lobenstein]], Vogtland, Germany in 1853, studying [[botany]] and [[chemistry]] for a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mitchell|first=Simon|title=Lucas Barrett, F.G.S., F.L.S.|url=http://www.sfmgeology.com/jamaicangeologists/barrett.html|work=The geologists who studied Jamaica|publisher=University of the West Indies|accessdate=2 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, he accompanied [[Robert MacAndrew]] on a dredging excursion from the [[Shetland Islands]] to Norway and beyond the [[Arctic Circle]]; he subsequently made other cruises, to [[Greenland]] and to the coast of Spain. These expeditions laid the foundations of an extensive knowledge of the distribution of marine life.

[[James Scott Bowerbank]] named in 1858 a new species of deep-sea sponge after him: ''[[Geodia barretti]].'' It had been collected by R. MacAndrew and L. Barrett on the Norwegian coast.

In 1855, he was engaged by [[Adam Sedgwick]] to assist in the [[Woodwardian Museum]] at [[Cambridge]]. During the following three years, he aided the professor by delivering lectures. He discovered bones of birds in the [[Cambridge Greensand]], and he prepared a geological map of Cambridge on the one-inch [[Ordnance map]]. In 1859, when he was twenty-two, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Jamaica. There, he determined the [[Cretaceous]] age of certain rocks that contained ''[[Hippurites]]''. [[S. P. Woodward]] named the new genus ''[[Barrettia (bivalve)|Barrettia]]'' after him. Barrett also collected many fossils from the [[Miocene]] and newer [[stratum|strata]].

He drowned, at the age of twenty-five, while investigating the sea-bottom off [[Kingston, Jamaica]].

==Products and applications==

Luminex's Multi-Analyte Profiling (xMAP) technology allows simultaneous analysis of up to 500 bioassays from a small sample volume, typically a single drop of fluid, by reading biological tests on the surface of microscopic polystyrene beads called microspheres. xMAP technology combines this miniaturized liquid array bioassay capability with small lasers, light emitting diodes (LEDs), digital signal processors, photo detectors, charge-coupled device imaging and proprietary software to create a system offering advantages in speed, precision, flexibility and cost. xMAP technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry, which includes the fields of drug discovery and development, and for clinical diagnostics, genetic analysis, bio-defense, food safety and biomedical research. Luminex MultiCode technology, used for real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and
multiplexed PCR assays.

'''Luo Junqiang''' ({{zh|羅君強}}) (1902 – February 22, 1970) was a politician of the Republic of China. He was born in [[Xiangtan]], [[Hunan]]. In 1922, at the age of 20, Luo joined the [[Communist Party of China]], but later left it to join the [[Kuomintang]]. He served in the government of [[Wang Jingwei]] in [[Nanjing]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. After the downfall of Wang's government in 1945, Luo was arrested and imprisoned. He died in custody in [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;税警団は、2万人規模の巨大組織であり、軍事力を有するのみならず、情報活動にも手を伸ばすなどした。これにより、「ＣＣ派」の周仏海は「公館派」の[[李士群]]に対抗するための組織を備えた。[[劉傑]]『漢奸裁判』、136頁。&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;徐友春主編『民国人物大辞典 増訂版』、2776頁。一方、劉傑前掲、151頁は、8月14日としている。&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maria Elisabeth Dickin''' [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (nickname, '''Mia'''; 22 September 1870 &amp;ndash; 1 March 1951) was a social reformer&lt;ref name="Long2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Long|first=David|title=Animal Heroes: Inspiring true stories of courageous animals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewiFsD91lUMC&amp;pg=PR12|date=14 March 2013|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4481-6516-2|pages=12–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an animal welfare pioneer who founded the [[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] (PDSA) in 1917. Born in 1870 in [[London]], she was the oldest of eight children; her parents were William George Dickin, a [[Wesleyan]] minister, and Ellen Maria (née Exell). She married her first cousin, Arnold Francis Dickin, an accountant, in 1899; they had no children. She enjoyed music, literary work and philanthropy. Dickin died in London in 1951 of influenzal broncho-pneumonia.&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Brian Harrison, ‘Dickin, Maria Elisabeth (1870–1951)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2010 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/53789, accessed 2 Aug 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Master McGrath''' (1866–1873) was a famous [[Greyhound]] in the sport of [[hare coursing]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/master-mcgrath-monument/49822&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://greytarticles.wordpress.com/historical/master-mcgrath-ireland%E2%80%99s-famous-coursing-greyhound/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early days==
Master McGrath was born in [[County Waterford]], [[Ireland]]. A small, weak pup, he went on to become the most celebrated and successful dog of his time. Master McGrath was born in 1866 at Colligan Lodge, the home of James Galwey, a well-known trainer and owner of [[greyhound]]s. Master McGrath was one of a litter of seven pups and although small was powerfully built. As a pup, his pet name was "Dicksy".

==First trial==
The dog showed none of the outstanding qualities which were later to make him famous at his first trial; his performance was so bad that his trainer ordered him to be given away. As luck would have it his "slipper" (handler) took charge of him and having more faith in him, entered him in several courses which he won. After these wins, he was returned to his trainer.

==Waterloo Cup==
He won the [[Waterloo Cup]] on three occasions, 1868, 1869 and 1871, and was the first greyhound to do so. He became such a [[celebrity]] that his owner, [[Charles Brownlow, 2nd Baron Lurgan|The 2nd Baron Lurgan]], was asked to take him to be seen by [[Queen Victoria]] and the [[British Royal Family]]. His success enabled Lord Lurgan to build a terrace of houses in [[Walthamstow]] from Master McGrath's winnings. These houses now form part of Shernhall Street, but are still clearly marked at one end of the terrace as "Master McGrath Terrace".

==Death==
Master McGrath died early in 1873 of [[heart disease]] which had already ended his career as a sire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=P. J.|last=McConville|title=The Wonder Dog &amp;ndash; Master McGrath|newspaper=[[Lurgan Mail]]|date=1941-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[autopsy]] showed that his heart was twice the size of a normal dog's heart. He was buried in the grounds of a house called "Solitude" in [[Lurgan]]. The house has since been demolished for development and Master McGrath's grave lies at a house once owned by an early English settler.

==Song and Ballad – ''Master McGrath''==
Eighteen sixty eight being the date and the year, &lt;br&gt;
Those Waterloo sportsmen and more did appear; &lt;br&gt;
For to gain the great prizes and bear them awa',&lt;br&gt;
Never counting on Ireland and Master McGrath.

On the twelfth of December, that day of renown,&lt;br&gt;
McGrath and his keeper they left Lurgan town;&lt;br&gt;
A gale in the Channel, it soon drove them o'er,&lt;br&gt;
On the thirteenth they landed on fair England's shore.

And when they arrived there in big London town,&lt;br&gt;
Those great English sportsmen all gathered round -&lt;br&gt;
And one of the gentlemen gave a "Ha! Ha!" Saying,&lt;br&gt;
"Is that the great dog you call Master McGrath?"

And one of those gentlemen standing around&lt;br&gt;
Says, "I don't care a damn for your Irish greyhound,"&lt;br&gt;
And another he laughs with a scornful "Ha! Ha!&lt;br&gt;
We'll soon humble the pride of your Master McGrath."

Then Lord Lurgan stepped forward and said, "Gentlemen,&lt;br&gt;
If there's any among you has money to spend -&lt;br&gt;
For your grand english nobles I don't care a straw -&lt;br&gt;
Here's five thousand to one upon Master McGrath."

Then McGrath he looked up and he wagged his old tail,&lt;br&gt;
Informing his lordship, "I know what you mane,&lt;br&gt;
Don't fear, noble Brownlow, don't fear them, agra,&lt;br&gt;
For I'll tarnish their laurels," says Master McGrath.

And Rose stood uncovered, the great English pride,&lt;br&gt;
Her master and keeper were close by her side;&lt;br&gt;
They have let her away and the crowd cried "Hurrah!"&lt;br&gt;
For the pride of all England – and Master McGrath.

As Rose and the Master they both ran along,&lt;br&gt;
"Now I wonder," says Rose, "what took you from your home;&lt;br&gt;
You should have stayed there in your Irish domain,&lt;br&gt;
And not come to gain laurels on Albion's plain."

"Well, I know," says McGrath, "we have wild heather bogs&lt;br&gt;
But you'll find in old Ireland there's good men and dogs.&lt;br&gt;
Lead on, bold Britannia, give none of your jaw,&lt;br&gt;
Stuff that up your nostrils," says Master McGrath.

Then the hare she went on just as swift as the wind&lt;br&gt;
He was sometimes before her and sometimes behind.&lt;br&gt;
Rose gave the first turn according to law;&lt;br&gt;
But the second was given by Master McGrath.

The hare she led on with a wonderful view.&lt;br&gt;
And swift as the wind o'er the green field she flew.&lt;br&gt;
But he jumped on her back and he held up his paw&lt;br&gt;
"Three cheers for old Ireland," says Master McGrath.

I've known many greyhounds that filled me with pride,&lt;br&gt;
In the days that are gone, but it can't be denied,&lt;br&gt;
That the greatest and the bravest that the world ever saw,&lt;br&gt; 
Was our champion of champions, great Master McGrath.

There was also a tune; "The Master McGrath Gallop" by H. R. Callcott R.A.M. (Composer of The Massereene Waltzes)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3473">'''Melchisedek Tsouderos''' ({{lang-el|Μελχισεδέκ Τσουδερός}}; 1769-1823) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] monk and fighter of the [[Greek War of Independence]] from [[Crete]]. He was killed in 1823 in a battle with the Ottoman forces.

==Biographical information==
He was born in 1769.&lt;ref&gt;''Σύγχρονος Εγκυκλοπαίδεια Ελευθερουδάκη'', vol. 23, p. 363.&lt;/ref&gt; His name was Michael and he had origins from the historic [[Tsouderos]] family. He was the third son of Emmanouil Tsouderos and had three more brothers named Georgios, Ioannis and Nikolaos.&lt;ref name=Kokkinos&gt;Dionysios Kokkinos, Η Ελληνική Επανάστασις, εκδόσεις Μέλισσα, Athens 1974, 6th edition, vol 2, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anastasios N. Goudas, Βιογραφία Τσουδερών ή Καλλεργών, Τυπογραφείον "Εστία", Athens, 1930, p. 53 - 54.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1810 he became a monk with the [[monastic name]] Melchisedek in [[Preveli Monastery]], which had conceded properties of his family. Around the 1817 he became abbot of the monastery acquiring the nickname "Tsouderogoumenos" ("Abbot Tsouderos").&lt;ref name=Goudas54&gt;Goudas, 1930, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt; During the pre-revolutionary period he was initiated into the [[Filiki Eteria]] by a monk of [[Agia Lavra]].&lt;ref name=Goudas54/&gt;

During May 1821, as the [[Greek Revolution]] had broken out in mainland Greece, an [[Cretan Turks|Ottoman-Cretan]] officer tried to arrest him, but he was informed by another Ottoman-Cretan and fled to Asomatos in the [[Rethymno]] region. From there, he moved with his brothers Georgios and Ioannis to [[Kallikratis]] and then he went along with an armed force to the monastery, which in the meantime had been destroyed and looted by the Ottomans.&lt;ref name=Kokkinos/&gt; On the 24th of the same month, he attended the official declaration of the Revolution in Crete in [[Kourkoulo Rodakinou]].&lt;ref&gt;Goudas, 1930, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June he participated in a battle on the hill of Agios Ioannis where a force of 600 Ottomans had camped. The surprise was absolute and the Ottomans suffered many losses – among the dead was their leader, the Ottoman-Cretan Ismail Agha or Psaraosmailis – and they retreated while the rebels took over a number of villages. Two days later, his men prevailed in a new battle with enemy forces in Spili. From the Ottoman side, among the dead was Deli Mustafa, who was captured and later executed.&lt;ref&gt;Goudas, 1930, p. 60-63&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1822 Tsouderos participated in the Third Assembly of the Cretans, in [[Armenoi]] in Chania. He even took caregiver tasks under the command of the general prefect of Crete [[Michail Komninos Afentoulief]].&lt;ref&gt;Sp. Zampelios – K.

'''Migrant deaths along the Mexico–U.S. border''' occur hundreds of times a year because of those attempting to cross into the [[United States]] from [[Mexico]] illegally.&lt;ref&gt;United States Government Accounting Office. [http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06770.pdf GAO-06-770], August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The US Border Patrol reported 294 migrant deaths in the fiscal year 2017 (ending September 30, 2017), which was lower than in 2016 (322), and any year during the period 2003-2014.

Mexico's [[Secretary of Foreign Affairs (Mexico)|Secretariat of Foreign Affairs]] has compiled data including deaths on the Mexican side of the border area during the period from 1994 to 2000.

The ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'' maintained a database of border deaths recorded by the Pima, Santa Cruz, Cochise, and Yuma County medical examiners between summer 2004 and September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''Arizona Daily Star'' [http://regulus.azstarnet.com/borderdeaths/search.php Border Death Database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106163958/http://regulus.azstarnet.com/borderdeaths/search.php |date=2010-01-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated, "With no official record-keeping system, the exact number of [[illegal entry|illegal entrants]] who have died along the Arizona stretch of U.S-Mexican border has never been known".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://regulus.azstarnet.com/borderdeaths/search.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106163958/http://regulus.azstarnet.com/borderdeaths/search.php |archivedate=2010-01-06 |df= }}, retrieved 14 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of dead border crossing migrants per year in Arizona increased from nine in 1990 to 201 in 2005; about 80% of the dead migrants were under 40 during 2000–2005, with an increasing number younger than 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/021607dntexazdead.149bf0e.html# | title=Funnel effect blamed for leap in border deaths | author=Isabel C.

A study by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100621092232/http://www.class.uh.edu/cir/index.asp Center for Immigration Research] at the [[University of Houston]] found that, "In the late 1980s, the number of foreign transient deaths usually exceeded 300, and peaked in 1988 at 355. Thereafter, the number of deaths fell to 180 in 1993 and 1994. After 1994 the number of deaths started to increase again, peaking in 2000 at 370. Border Patrol counts for 2001 and 2002 show a small decrease in the number of deaths in those years compared to 2000."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Eschbach, [[Jacqueline Hagan]], Nestor Rodríguez (2003): [http://www.uh.edu/cir/Deaths_during_migration.pdf Deaths during illegal migration: trends and policy implications in the new era of homeland security] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206162336/http://www.uh.edu/cir/Deaths_during_migration.pdf |date=2007-02-06 }}. In ''In Defense of the Alien'', Vol. 26, pp. 37–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of deaths of illegal immigrants along the border has increased on a regular, yearly basis since the middle 1990s, particularly in the state of [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=Eschbach01/&gt; As of summer 2006, tighter enforcement in Arizona has likely led to fewer deaths there, but border wide fatalities were approaching the record pace of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;San Diego Union-Tribune (July 22, 2006): [http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060722-9999-1n22crossers.html Border deaths on record pace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027171142/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/tijuana/20060722-9999-1n22crossers.html |date=2006-10-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060722/images/border.pdf Apprehensions, Rescues, Deaths 2005–2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102002203/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060722/images/border.pdf |date=2006-11-02 }}.

In 2012, the [[United States Border Patrol]] found the remains of 463 migrants in the U.S., of which 177 were discovered along the section of the border near Tucson, Arizona.&lt;ref name="wola.org"&gt;Isacson, Adam. {{cite news|title=A Big Shift in Migration, and the Importance of Search and Rescue|url=http://www.wola.org/commentary/a_big_shift_in_migration_and_the_importance_of_search_and_rescue|date=11 December 2013|newspaper=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Rio Grande Valley]] of South Texas reported 150 migrant remains found, a jump from 2011 due to the increased numbers of Central American migrants.&lt;ref name="wola.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="http"&gt;Isacson, Adam, Maureen Meyer and Ashley Davis. {{cite news|title=Border Security and Migration: A Report from Arizona|url=http://www.wola.org/publications/border_security_and_migration#remains|date=5 December 2013|newspaper=[[Washington Office on Latin America]]|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exposure===
[[Hyperthermia]] is one of the most common causes of migrant border deaths.&lt;ref name="Eschbach01"/&gt;

===Drowning===
A common cause of immigrant border deaths is drowning in canals, ditches, and the [[Rio Grande]].&lt;ref name="datb1"&gt;{{Citation|periodical=International Migration Review|publisher=The Center for Migration Studies of New York|last1=Eschbach|last2=Hagan|last3=Rodriguez|last4=Hernandez-Leon|last5=Bailey|first1=Karl|first2=Jacqueline|first3=Nestor|first4=Ruben|first5=Stanley|title=Death at the Border|volume=33|issue=2|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accidents===
Significant numbers of illegal immigrants die in [[car accident]]s and other accidental causes. According to a December 2006 cover story in the ''[[San Diego Reader]]'', "...traffic fatalities involving immigrants have more than doubled since 2003 as ''coyotes,'' or ''polleros'' – the guides leading migrants across the border – try other methods. On August 7, nine migrants died in a crash in the [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] sector when the driver of a [[Chevrolet Suburban]] – in which 21 Mexicans were "stacked like cordwood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/us/09crash.html|title=Risky Measures by Smugglers Increase Toll on Immigrants|first=Randal C.|last=Archibold|date=9 August 2006|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; – lost control after crossing a Border Patrol spike strip at high speed.

Close to one hundred illegal immigrants were struck and killed on [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]] freeways over a five-year span in the late 1980s, prompting the creation of [[Immigration sign|a highway safety sign]] to caution drivers about migrants crossing the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050410/news_1n10signs.html |title=Highway safety sign becomes running story on immigration |date=2005-04-10 |first=Leslie |last=Berestein |accessdate=2008-07-31 |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724201725/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050410/news_1n10signs.html |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2010, a 15-year-old Mexican citizen was shot to death on the Mexican side of the border near El Paso, Texas. The U.S. Border Patrol reported that the officers responded to a group of suspected illegal immigrants who were throwing rocks at them. President [[Felipe Calderón]]  criticized the shooting by stating that "the use of firearms to repel attacks with stones represents disproportionate use of force".&lt;ref name="AP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Dentron"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-borderpatrol_09tex.ART.State.Edition1.2949f5e.html|title=Mexican teen shot to death by U.S. Border Patrol agent|accessdate=3 September 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130121103112/http://www.dentonrc.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/texassouthwest/stories/DN-borderpatrol_09tex.ART.State.Edition1.2949f5e.html|archivedate=21 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vigilante killings===
According to [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' Magazine]], in the first half of 2000, three immigrants were killed and seven others wounded in showdowns on the U.S. side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;Time McGirk: [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,997279,00.html Border Clash].

==Impact on border communities==

The impact of migrant deaths on border communities can be difficult for small towns on the U.S. side, which have found themselves with hundreds of remains to identify and bury, at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Immigrant deaths surge in South Texas county|url=http://lubbockonline.com/texas/2012-12-31/immigrant-deaths-surge-south-texas-county#.UwZmUmJdXD0|date=21 December 2012|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=20 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the Office of the Medical Examiner in Pima County, Arizona, had 871 cases of unidentified remains dating as far back as the 1990s.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt; Relief groups often aid migrants traveling along the border.

==International consequences==

The deaths have caused tension between the United States and other countries, particularly Mexico and the countries of [[Central America]],{{citation needed|date = February 2014}} from where a majority of illegal immigrants that enter the United States through the Southwestern borders come. Foreign consulates across the Southwest United States, in particular those of [[Latin America]]n countries, have condemned the deaths of illegal immigrants across the border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sre.gob.mx/english/events/guillermo_case.htm|title=Follow-up to the Guillermo Martínez Rodríguez case|date=2006-01-05|accessdate=2008-07-31|publisher=Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927212556/http://www.sre.gob.mx/english/events/guillermo_case.htm| archivedate = September 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sarah Marie Johnson''' was born January 24, 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[https://krazykillers.wordpress.com/2011/09/01/sarah-johnson-peculiar-parracide/ Killers Without Conscience]&lt;/ref&gt; She grew up in the  Idaho city of [[Bellevue, Idaho|Bellevue]], and attended [[Wood River High School (Idaho)|Wood River High School]] in [[Hailey, Idaho|Hailey]].&lt;ref name="prime"/&gt;

== History ==
On September 2, 2003, Alan Scott Johnson and Diane Johnson were shot to death in their [[Bellevue, Idaho]], home. Alan was shot twice in the chest, while Diane was shot in the head. Their daughter, Sarah Johnson, was found guilty of their murder. Sarah was 16 years old at the time. Her apparent motive was her parents' prohibiting her from [[dating]] 19-year-old Bruno Santos.&lt;ref name=prime/&gt;

At approximately 6:20 am on September 2, 2003, Johnson took the murder weapon, a [[Winchester rifle]] from the guest house. The tenant of the house had left for [[Boise, Idaho]], and had not planned on returning for a week or so. She then walked into her parents' bedroom and shot her sleeping mother in the head, whereupon she walked into the bathroom and shot her father in the chest, right above the heart, while he was showering. DNA evidence was presented at trial from a discarded bathrobe and a [[latex glove]] that police found in the garbage can in front of the house. It contained the DNA of both victims and Sarah. Along with the robe and latex glove was a [[leather glove]] that had [[gunshot residue]] on it. In Johnson's bedroom investigators located the other leather glove that belonged to the pair.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.heritage.org/2009/10/23/adult-time-for-adult-crime-sarah-johnson/ Adult Time for Adult Crime: Sarah Johnson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Englert|first1=Rod|last2=Passero|first2=Kathy|last3=Rule|first3=Ann|coauthors= |title=Blood Secrets: Chronicles of a Crime Scene Reconstructionist|page=251 |quote=Sarah's father, Alan Johnson, lay facedown and naked on the floor nearby, ...

The [[Idaho Supreme Court]] upheld her conviction.

In 2012, Johnson's lawyer filed petition for a new trial, charging that she had ineffective legal counsel in the murder trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://magicvalley.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/sarah-johnson-again-seeks-new-trial-for-parents-murder/article_ef90d6ba-948f-11e1-acca-0019bb2963f4.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, the request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktvb.com/story/news/crime/2014/10/31/judge-denies-johnson-new-trial/18244987/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discovery of remains===
On 5 October 2009, a motorway worker found a plastic bin bag containing bones while he was clearing a vegetation patch on a slip road at Junction 14 of the [[M5 motorway]]. The bones in the bag included a skull, pelvis and thigh bone and further remains were found buried and spread around the field by the side of the motorway. Police confirmed that the remains were human, and they showed a piece of jewellery found at the site to Mr and Mrs Hall, who confirmed that it had belonged to their daughter.&lt;ref name="key"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/8296122.stm|title=Jewellery 'key' in M5 bones case |date=8 October 2009 |publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, police refused to confirm that the body was that of Miss Hall until a post-mortem had been carried out.&lt;ref name="Bristol247"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol247.com/2009/10/07/police-refuse-to-confirm-bones-link-to-missing-melanie/|title=Police refuse to confirm bones link to missing Melanie|date=7 October 2009|publisher=Bristol247|accessdate=8 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091011074315/http://www.bristol247.com/2009/10/07/police-refuse-to-confirm-bones-link-to-missing-melanie/|archivedate=11 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains were formally identified as being Hall's through dental records on 7 October.&lt;ref name="Garbage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TimelineBBC" /&gt; She had incurred severe blunt trauma to her head resulting in a fractured skull, cheekbone and jaw.

Hall's parents launched a fresh appeal on 8 October for anyone with information to come forward,&lt;ref name="Garbage" /&gt; while Avon and Somerset CID DS Mike Britton stated that he was staying on after his retirement to continue working on the Hall disappearance, codenamed Operation Denmark, having spent 13 years on the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/somerset/8323755.stm|title=CID man holds retirement for case |date=24 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Murder of Melanie Hall|url=http://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/newsroom/special_appeals/melanie-hall/|work=[[Avon and Somerset Constabulary]]|accessdate=16 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016122530/http://avonandsomerset.police.uk/newsroom/special_appeals/melanie-hall/|archivedate=16 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 October 2009, police announced that three keys to a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] vehicle, possibly a [[Ford Transit|Transit]], [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]] or [[Ford Escort (Europe)|Escort]] had been found near the body, and that they were working with Ford to try to identify the vehicle. ''[[Crimewatch]]'' also launched a fresh appeal for information, which resulted in more than 200 phone calls from the public.

'''Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins''' (NRAMPs) are members of the '''metal ion (Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-iron) transporter family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55 TC# 2.A.55]). The NRAMP family is a member of the large [[APC Superfamily]] of secondary carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vastermark A, Wollwage S, Houle ME, Rio R, Saier MH | title = Expansion of the APC superfamily of secondary carriers | journal = Proteins | volume = 82 | issue = 10 | pages = 2797–811 | date = October 2014 | pmid = 25043943 | pmc = 4177346 | doi = 10.1002/prot.24643 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homologues of this family are found in various [[yeast]]s, [[plant]]s, [[animal]]s, [[archaea]], and [[Gram-negative bacteria|Gram-negative]] and [[Gram-positive bacteria]] termed "natural resistance-associated" [[macrophage]] proteins because one of the animal homologues plays a role in resistance to intracellular bacterial [[pathogen]]s such as ''[https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Salmonella_enterica_serovar_Typhi Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium]'', ''[[Leishmania donovani]]'' and ''[[Mycobacterium bovis]]''. The natural history of ''SLC11'' genes in vertebrates has been discussed by Neves et al. (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Neves JV, Wilson JM, Kuhl H, Reinhardt R, Castro LF, Rodrigues PN | title = Natural history of SLC11 genes in vertebrates: tales from the fish world | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 11 | pages = 106 | date = April 2011 | pmid = 21501491 | pmc = 3103463 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-11-106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed to be a distant member of the [[APC Superfamily]], several human pathologies may result from defects in NRAMP-dependent Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; transport, including iron overload, neurodegenerative diseases and innate susceptibility to infectious diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cellier MF | title = Nramp: from sequence to structure and mechanism of divalent metal import | journal = Current Topics in Membranes | volume = 69 | pages = 249–93 | date = 2012-01-01 | pmid = 23046654 | doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-394390-3.00010-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NRAMP2==
{{Main|DMT1}}
Humans and rodents possess two distinct NRAMPs. The broad specificity NRAMP2 (DMT1), which transports a range of divalent metal cations, transports Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; with a 1:1 stoichiometry and apparent affinities of 6 μm and about 1 μm, respectively. Variable H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; stoichiometry has also been reported. The order of substrate preference for NRAMP2 is:

Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&gt; Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

Many of these ions can inhibit iron absorption. Mutation of NRAMP2 in rodents leads to defective [[Endosome|endosomal]] iron export within the ferritin cycle, impaired intestinal iron absorption and [[microcytic anemia]]. Symptoms of Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; deficiency are also seen. It is found in apical membranes of intestinal epithelial cells but also in late [[endosome]]s and [[lysosome]]s.

==NRAMP1==
{{Main|SLC11A1}}
In contrast to the widely expressed NRAMP2, NRAMP1 is expressed primarily in [[macrophage]]s and [[monocyte]]s and appears to have a preference for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; rather than Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. NRAMP1 ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.3 TC# 2.A.55.2.3]) has been reported to function by metal:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; antiport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Techau ME, Valdez-Taubas J, Popoff JF, Francis R, Seaman M, Blackwell JM | title = Evolution of differences in transport function in Slc11a family members | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 49 | pages = 35646–56 | date = December 2007 | pmid = 17932044 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M707057200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that a deficiency for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or some other metal prevents the generation of reactive oxygenic and nitrogenic compounds that are used by macrophage to combat pathogens. This hypothesis is supported by studies on the bacterial NRAMP homologues which exhibit extremely high selectivity for Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; over Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other divalent cations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wei W, Chai T, Zhang Y, Han L, Xu J, Guan Z | title = The Thlaspi caerulescens NRAMP homologue TcNRAMP3 is capable of divalent cation transport | journal = Molecular Biotechnology | volume = 41 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–21 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 18663607 | doi = 10.1007/s12033-008-9088-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation of these transporters in bacteria can occur through Fur, OxyR, and most commonly a DtxR homolog, MntR.

==Smf and other homologues==
The Smf1 protein of ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' appears to catalyze high-affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.3 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake while the closely related Smf2 protein may catalyze low affinity (''K&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 60 μm) Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake in the same organism. Both proteins also mediate H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; uptake. These proteins are of 575 and 549 amino acyl residues in length and are predicted to have 8-12 transmembrane α-helical spanners. The ''E. coli'' homologue of 412 aas exhibits 11 putative and confirmed TMSs with the N-terminus in and the C-terminus out. The yeast proteins may be localized to the vacuole and/or the plasma membrane of the yeast cell. Indirect and some direct experiments suggest that they may be able to transport several heavy metals including Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cd&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. A third yeast protein, Smf3p, appears to be exclusively intracellular, possibly in the Golgi. NRAMP2 (''[[SLC11A2|Slc11A2]]'') of Homo sapiens ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.55.2.1 TC# 2.A.55.2.1]) has a 12 TMS topology with intracellular N- and C-termini. Two-fold structural symmetry in the arrangement of membrane helices for TM1-5 and TM6-10 (conserved Slc2 hydrophobic core) is suggested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Czachorowski M, Lam-Yuk-Tseung S, Cellier M, Gros P | title = Transmembrane topology of the mammalian Slc11a2 iron transporter | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 48 | issue = 35 | pages = 8422–34 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19621945 | pmc = 2736113 | doi = 10.1021/bi900606y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport reaction==
The generalized transport reaction catalyzed by NRAMP family proteins is:

Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) ⇌ Me&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in).

'''Rationality''' is the quality or state of being rational – that is, being based on or agreeable to [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rationality|title=Definition of RATIONALITY|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rational|title=Definition of RATIONAL|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationality implies the conformity of one's beliefs with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s to believe, and of one's actions with one's [[reason (argument)|reason]]s for action. "Rationality" has different specialized meanings in [[philosophy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/reason|title=reason|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[game theory]] and [[political science]].

To determine what behavior is the most rational, one needs to make several key assumptions, and also needs a logical formulation of the problem. When the goal or problem involves making a decision, rationality factors in all information that is available (e.g. complete or incomplete [[knowledge]]). Collectively, the formulation and background assumptions are the model within which rationality applies. Rationality is relative: if one accepts a model in which benefitting oneself is optimal, then rationality is equated with behavior that is self-interested to the point of being selfish; whereas if one accepts a model in which benefiting the group is optimal, then purely selfish behavior is deemed irrational. It is thus meaningless to assert rationality without also specifying the background model assumptions describing how the problem is framed and formulated.

==Theories==

===Max Weber===
The German sociologist [[Max Weber]] proposed an interpretation of [[Social actions|social action]] that distinguished between four different [[ideal type|idealized types]] of rationality. The first, which he called ''Zweckrational'' or purposive/[[instrumental rationality]], is related to the expectations about the behavior of other human beings or objects in the environment. These expectations serve as means for a particular actor to attain ends, ends which Weber noted were "rationally pursued and calculated." The second type, Weber called ''Wertrational'' or value/belief-oriented. Here the action is undertaken for what one might call reasons intrinsic to the actor: some ethical, aesthetic, religious or other motive, independent of whether it will lead to success. The third type was affectual, determined by an actor's specific affect, feeling, or emotion—to which Weber himself said that this was a kind of rationality that was on the borderline of what he considered "meaningfully oriented." The fourth was traditional or conventional, determined by ingrained habituation. Weber emphasized that it was very unusual to find only one of these orientations: combinations were the norm. His usage also makes clear that he considered the first two as more significant than the others, and it is arguable that the third and fourth are subtypes of the first two.

The advantage in Weber's interpretation of rationality is that it avoids a value-laden assessment, say, that certain kinds of beliefs are irrational. Instead, Weber suggests that a ground or motive can be given—for religious or affect reasons, for example—that may meet the criterion of explanation or justification even if it is not an explanation that fits the ''Zweckrational'' orientation of means and ends. The opposite is therefore also true: some means-ends explanations will not satisfy those whose grounds for action are ''Wertrational''.

Weber's constructions of rationality have been critiqued both from a [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermasian]] (1984) perspective (as devoid of social context and under-theorised in terms of social power)&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Habermas]] (1984) ''The Theory of Communicative Action Volume&amp;nbsp;1; Reason and the Rationalization of Society'', Cambridge: Polity Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and also from a [[feminist]] perspective (Eagleton, 2003) whereby Weber's rationality constructs are viewed as imbued with masculine values and oriented toward the maintenance of male power.&lt;ref&gt;Eagleton, M. (ed) (2003) ''A Concise Companion to Feminist Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative position on rationality (which includes both [[bounded rationality]],&lt;ref&gt;Simons, H. and Hawkins, D. (1949), "Some Conditions in Macro-Economic Stability", ''Econometrica'', 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the affective and value-based arguments of Weber) can be found in the critique of Etzioni (1988),&lt;ref&gt;Etzioni, A. (1988), [https://www.gwu.edu/~ccps/etzioni/A186.pdf "Normative-Affective Factors: Toward a New Decision-Making Model"], ''Journal of Economic Psychology'', Vol. 9, pp. 125–150.&lt;/ref&gt; who reframes thought on decision-making to argue for a reversal of the position put forward by Weber. Etzioni illustrates how purposive/instrumental reasoning is subordinated by normative considerations (ideas on how people 'ought' to behave) and affective considerations (as a support system for the development of human relationships).

===Psychology===
In the [[psychology of reasoning]], psychologists and [[Cognitive science|cognitive scientists]] have defended different positions on human rationality. One prominent view, due to [[Philip Johnson-Laird]] and [[Ruth M.&amp;nbsp;J. Byrne]] among others is that humans are rational in principle but they err in practice, that is, humans have the competence to be rational but their performance is limited by various factors.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, R.M.J. &amp; Johnson-Laird, P.N. (2009). 'If' and the problems of conditional reasoning. ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', 13, 282–287&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been argued that many standard tests of reasoning, such as those on the [[conjunction fallacy]], on the [[Wason selection task]], or the [[base rate fallacy]] suffer from methodological and conceptual problems. This has led to disputes in psychology over whether researchers should (only) use standard rules of logic, probability theory and statistics, or rational choice theory as norms of good reasoning. Opponents of this view, such as [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], favor a conception of [[bounded rationality]], especially for tasks under high uncertainty.&lt;ref&gt;Sturm, Thomas (2012). The “rationality wars” in psychology: Where they are and where they could go. ''Inquiry'', 55, 66-81.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Richard Brandt===
[[Richard Brandt]] proposed a "reforming definition" of rationality, arguing someone is rational if their notions survive a form of [[psychotherapy|cognitive-psychotherapy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ethical Theory: The Problems of Normative and Critical Ethics|publisher=Prentice-Hall|author=Richard B. Brandt|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quality==
Abulof argues that rationality has become an "essentially contested concept," as its "proper use… inevitably involves endless disputes." He identifies "four fronts" for the disputes about the meaning of rationality: 
# The purpose, or function, of ascribing rationality: Is it descriptive/explanatory, prescriptive or subjunctive (rationality "as if" real)? 
# The subject of rationality: What, or who, is rational: the choice, the act, or the choosing actor?
# Cognition: What is the quality of the cognitive decision-making process: minimal (calculative intentionality) or optimal (expected-utility)? 
# Rationale: Is rationality merely instrumental, that is, agnostic about the logic of human action and its motivations (instrumental rationality) or does it substantially inform them (substantive rationality, focusing on material maximization)?&lt;ref name="Abulof"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Abulof | first = Uriel | date = 2015 | title =  The Malpractice of Rationality in International Relations | journal =  Rationality and Society | volume = 27 | issue = 3 | pages = 358–384 | url = http://rss.sagepub.com/content/27/3/358.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by some philosophers (notably [[A.&amp;nbsp;C. Grayling]]) that a good rationale must be independent of emotions, personal feelings or any kind of instincts. Any process of evaluation or analysis, that may be called rational, is expected to be highly objective, logical and "mechanical". If these minimum requirements are not satisfied i.e. if a person has been, even slightly, influenced by personal emotions, feelings, instincts, or culturally specific moral codes and norms, then the analysis may be termed irrational, due to the injection of subjective bias.

Modern [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] show that studying the role of emotion in mental function (including topics ranging from flashes of scientific insight to making future plans), that no human has ever satisfied this criterion, except perhaps a person with no affective feelings, for example an individual with a massively damaged [[amygdala]] or severe psychopathy. Thus, such an idealized form of rationality is best exemplified by computers, and not people. However, scholars may productively appeal to the idealization as a point of reference. {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Theoretical and practical==
[[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] had distinguished theoretical from practical reason. Rationality theorist [[Jesús Mosterín]] makes a parallel distinction between theoretical and practical rationality, although, according to him, reason and rationality are not the same: reason would be a psychological faculty, whereas rationality is an optimizing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús (2008). ''Lo mejor posible: Racionalidad y acción humana''. Madrid: Alianza Editorial, 2008. 318 pp. {{ISBN|978-84-206-8206-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Humans are not rational by definition, but they can think and behave rationally or not, depending on whether they apply, explicitly or implicitly, the strategy of theoretical and practical rationality to the thoughts they accept and to the actions they perform.

The distinction is also described as that between epistemic rationality, the attempt to form beliefs in an unbiased manner, and instrumental rationality.

Theoretical rationality has a formal component that reduces to logical consistency and a material component that reduces to empirical support, relying on our inborn mechanisms of signal detection and interpretation. Mosterín distinguishes between involuntary and implicit belief, on the one hand, and voluntary and explicit acceptance, on the other.&lt;ref&gt;Mosterín, Jesús (2002). “Acceptance Without Belief”. ''Manuscrito'', vol. XXV, pp. 313–335.&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical rationality can more properly be said to regulate our acceptances than our beliefs. Practical rationality is the strategy for living one’s best possible life, achieving your most important goals and your own preferences in as far as possible.

==Examples in different fields==

===Logic===
{{main|Logic and rationality}}
As the study of arguments that are correct in virtue of their form, [[logic]] is of fundamental importance in the study of rationality.  The study of rationality in logic is more concerned with epistemic rationality, that is, attaining beliefs in a rational manner, than instrumental rationality.

===Economics===
Rationality plays a key role and there are several strands to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foundations of Rational Choice Under Risk|publisher=Oxford University Press|author=Paul Anand|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, there is the concept of instrumentality—basically the idea that people and organisations are instrumentally rational—that is, adopt the best actions to achieve their goals. Secondly, there is an axiomatic concept that rationality is a matter of being logically consistent within your preferences and beliefs. Thirdly, people have focused on accuracy of beliefs and full use of information—in this view a person who is not rational has beliefs that don't fully use the information they have.

Debates within economic sociology also arise as to whether or not people or organizations are "really" rational, as well as whether it makes sense to model them as such in formal models. Some have argued that a kind of [[bounded rationality]] makes more sense for such models.

Others think that any kind of rationality along the lines of [[rational choice theory]] is a useless concept for understanding human behavior; the term ''[[homo economicus]]'' (economic man: the imaginary man being assumed in economic models who is [[logically consistent]] but amoral) was coined largely in honor of this view.  [[Behavioral economics]] aims to account for economic actors as they actually are, allowing for psychological biases, rather than assuming idealized instrumental rationality.

===Artificial intelligence===
Within [[artificial intelligence]], a ''[[intelligent agent|rational agent]]'' is typically one that maximizes its [[Expected utility hypothesis|expected utility]], given its current knowledge. [[Utility]] is the usefulness of the consequences of its actions. The utility function is arbitrarily defined by the designer, but should be a function of "performance", which is the directly measurable consequences, such as winning or losing money. In order to make a safe agent that plays defensively, a nonlinear function of performance is often desired, so that the reward for winning is lower than the punishment for losing. An agent might be rational within its own problem area, but finding the rational decision for arbitrarily complex problems is not practically possible. The rationality of human thought is a key problem in the [[psychology of reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson-Laird, P.N. &amp; Byrne, R.M.J. (1991). ''Deduction''. Hillsdale: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International relations===
There is an ongoing debate over the merits of using “rationality” in the study of [[international relations]] (IR). Some scholars hold it indispensable.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno De Mesquita, Bruce (2010) Foreign Policy Analysis and Rational Choice Models. In The International Studies Encyclopedia, edited by Robert Allen Denemark. Malden, MA: Wiley-Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt; Others are more critical.&lt;ref&gt;Walt, Stephen M. (1999) Rigor or Rigor Mortis?: Rational Choice and Security Studies. International Security 23 (4):5-48.&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the pervasive and persistent usage of "rationality" in political science and IR is beyond dispute. "Rationality" remains ubiquitous in this field. Abulof finds that Some 40% of all scholarly references to "foreign policy" allude to "rationality"—and this ratio goes up to more than half of pertinent academic publications in the 2000s. He further argues that when it comes to concrete security and foreign policies, IR employment of rationality borders on "malpractice": rationality-based descriptions are largely either false or unfalsifiable; many observers fail to explicate the meaning of "rationality" they employ; and the concept is frequently used politically to distinguish between "us and them."&lt;ref name=Abulof/&gt;

'''Rob''' (1939 – 18 January 1952) was a [[Collie]] dog who in February 1945 was awarded the [[Dickin Medal]].&lt;ref name=pdsadog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs#awards-made-between-2000-ndash-to-date |title=Dickin Medal dogs |publisher=[[People's Dispensary for Sick Animals]] |accessdate=14 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212182318/http://www.pdsa.org.uk/about-us/animal-bravery-awards/dickin-medal-dogs |archivedate=12 February 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; considered to be the animals' [[Victoria Cross]]. He was alleged to have made over 20 parachute descents during the North African Campaign, serving with the [[Special Air Service|SAS]]. However, in 2006, his actions were revealed as being a possible hoax perpetrated by members of his regiment in order to prevent Rob leaving after his original owners requested his return.

==Early life and military service==
Rob was a [[working dog]] on a farm in [[Shropshire]] until 1942, when his owners, Basil and Heather Bayne, enlisted him as a [[war dog]].&lt;ref name=dogbiz /&gt; Assigned to the [[Special Air Service]] at the base in [[Wivenhoe Park]], [[Essex]], Rob's official designation was war dog No 471/322.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2277684.html |title = War heroics were a shaggy dog story| work=[[The Times]] |date=20 July 2006|accessdate=5 March 2011|first=Jack|last=Malvern}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was used as a messenger and a [[guard dog]].

==Dickin Medal==
Rob received his medal in London on 3 February 1945.&lt;ref name=pdsadog/&gt;  The citation read "For service including 20 parachute jumps while serving with Infantry in North Africa and SAS Regiment in Italy."&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; Rob won other medals for bravery, including an [[RSPCA]] silver medal.&lt;ref name=dogbiz&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Neill|first=Amanda|title=Dogbiz|year=2006|page=71|publisher=Interpet Publishing|isbn=978-1-84286-136-3|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Wst9BSbWuY8C&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=rob+dickin+medal#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20dickin%20medal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dickin Medal is often referred to as the animal metaphorical equivalent of the [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Long|first1=David|title=The animals' VC: for gallantry and devotion: the PDSA Dickin Medal - inspiring stories of bravery and courage|date=2012|publisher=Preface|location=London|isbn=9781848093768|ref=long2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hoax===
According to [[Quentin Hughes (architect)|Quentin Hughes]]' [[Autobiography|autobiographical]] account of his time in the [[Special Air Service|2nd SAS]], ''Who Cares Who Wins?'',&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; the actions which led to Rob's Dickin Medal were in fact a hoax. He reported that instead of completing parachute drops as reported, the dog acted as a companion to the regiment [[quartermaster]], Tom Burt.&lt;ref name=shaggydogstory&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1524456/SAS-reports-of-canine-heroics-just-a-shaggy-dog-story.html | newspaper = [[Daily Telegraph]]| accessdate=5 March 2011 | date = 21 July 2006|title = SAS reports of canine heroics 'just a shaggy dog story' | first = Richard|last=Alleyne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lll
Hughes wrote that when hearing that the family which donated Rob to the [[Army Veterinary and Remount Services]] had requested the dog back, he and Burt worked together to keep Rob by exaggerating his exploits. At one point they attempted to carry out a parachute jump with Rob but weather conditions were unfavourable and they could not follow through with the jump as Hughes wrote, "We had a suitable parachute harness and I phoned through to the RAF and made arrangements for Rob to have a short flight, unfortunately, quite a strong wind blew up during the flight and the RAF decided it would be dangerous to drop Rob on that day."&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; They had to send a letter to his owners following the successful drop, and after the failure decided to send it anyway. Rob's owners passed the letter about the dog's actions to the PDSA,&lt;ref name=Times /&gt; resulting in Rob's Dickin Medal in January 1945. Although Hughes died in 2004, the possibility of a hoax wasn't revealed until 2006 when a painting of Rob was featured in an exhibition entitled "The Animals War" at the [[Imperial War Museum]] in London.&lt;ref name=shaggydogstory/&gt; According to Hughes' friend Mickey King, who remembered the author discussing the incident, "Quentin said that nobody survived 20 parachute drops, let alone a dog. You were lucky to survive three."&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;

==Later life==
Following his military service, he returned to his owners in Tetchill, Shropshire. He died in 1952 and was buried on the family farm, marked with a stone memorial which reads:&lt;ref name=animalgraves&gt;{{cite book|last=Toms|first=Jan|title=Animal Graves and Memorials|year=2006|publisher=Shire Publications Ltd|isbn=978-0-7478-0643-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iGW2YkGWAdAC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=rob+dickin+medal#v=onepage&amp;q=rob%20dickin%20medal&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{quote|To the dear memory of Rob, war dog no 471/322, twice VC, Britain's first parachute dog, who served three and a half years in North Africa and Italy with the Second Special Air Service Regiment.

==In literature==
A [[Children's literature|children's book]] has been written about Rob, entitled ''Rob the Paradog'', written by Dorothy Nicholle and published by Blue Hills Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Books for children|url=http://bluehillspress.co.uk/childrens_books.html|work=Blue Hills Press|accessdate=5 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rogneda of Polotsk''' (962–1002) is the [[Slavic (language)|Slavic]] name for '''Ragnhild''', was a Princess consort of Rus. She was the daughter of [[Rogvolod|Ragnvald]] (Slavic: [[Rogvolod]]) came from [[Scandinavia]] and established himself at [[Polatsk]] in the mid-10th century. 

==Life==
It has been speculated that Rogneda belonged to the [[Ynglings]] royal family of [[Norway]]. In or about 980, [[Vladimir I of Kiev|Vladimir]], on learning that she was betrothed to his half-brother [[Yaropolk I of Kiev]], took Polotsk and forced Rogneda to marry him. Having raped Rogneda in the presence of her parents, he ordered them to be killed, along with two of Rogneda's brothers.

Rogneda gave him several children. The four sons were [[Yaroslav the Wise]], Vsevolod, [[Mstislav of Chernigov]], and [[Izyaslav of Polotsk]]. She also bore two daughters, one of whom is named by [[Nestor the Chronicler]] as [[Predslava]] (taken as a concubine of [[Boleslaus I of Poland]], according to [[Gallus Anonymus|Gallus]]). A later chronicle tells a story, most likely taken from a [[Norse saga]], of Rogneda plotting against Vladimir and asking her elder son, Izyaslav, to kill him. As was the Norse royal custom, she was sent with her elder son to govern the land of her parents, i.e. Polotsk. Izyaslav's line continued to rule Polotsk and the newly found town of [[Izyaslavl]] until the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol invasion]].

After Vladimir converted to Christianity and took [[Anna Porphyrogeneta]] as his wife, he had to divorce all his previous wives, including Rogneda. After that, she entered the convent and took the name '''Anastasia'''.

==Legacy==
Around 1825 [[Kondraty Fyodorovich Ryleyev|Kondraty Ryleev]] wrote a narrative poem entitled ''Rogneda''.  This poem became a literary source for her portrayal in the nationalist Russian opera ''[[Rogneda (opera)|Rogneda]]'' by [[Alexander Serov]], which premiered in 1865.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6450">A '''shadow biosphere''' is a hypothetical [[microbe|microbial]] [[biosphere]] of Earth that uses radically different [[biochemistry|biochemical]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] processes than currently known life. Although life on Earth is relatively well-studied, the shadow biosphere may still remain unnoticed because the exploration of the microbial world targets primarily the biochemistry of the macro-organisms. The term was coined by Carol Cleland and Shelley Copley in 2005.&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"&gt;Cleland and Copley (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

==The hypothesis==
It has been proposed that the early Earth hosted multiple origins of life, some of which produced chemical variations on life as we know it.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland, C.E. (2007) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18053938 Epistemological issues in the study of microbial life: alternative biospheres]. Studies in the History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences 38:847–861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt; Steven A. Benner, Alonso Ricardo, and Matthew A. Carrigan, biochemists at the [[University of Florida]], argued that if [[RNA world hypothesis|organisms based on RNA]] once existed, they might still be alive today, unnoticed because they do not contain [[ribosome]]s, which are usually used to detect living microorganisms. They suggest searching for them in environments that are low in [[sulfur]], environments that are spatially constrained (for example, minerals with pores smaller than one [[micrometre]]), or environments that cycle between extreme hot and cold.&lt;ref&gt;Benner, S. A., Ricardo, A. and Carrigan, M. A. (2004) [http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf Is there a common chemical model for life in the universe?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214063212/http://www.ffame.org/sbenner/cochembiol8.672-689.pdf |date=2010-12-14 }}. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 8, 672-689.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other proposed candidates for a shadow biosphere include organisms using different suites of amino acids in their proteins or different molecular units (e.g., bases or sugars) in their nucleic acids,&lt;ref name="Cleland and Copley 2005"/&gt; having a [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] opposite of ours, using some of the [[Amino acid#Non-standard amino acids|non-standard amino acids]], or using [[arsenic]] instead of [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P. C. W. , Benner, S.A., Cleland, C.E., Lineweaver,C.H., McKay,C.P. and Wolfe-Simon,F. [http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1089/ast.2008.0251 Signatures of a Shadow Biosphere] (2009) Astrobiology. 9(2): 241-249. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2008.0251}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Carol Cleland, a philosopher of science at the University of Colorado (Boulder), argues that [[desert varnish]], whose status as living or nonliving has been debated since the time of Darwin, should be investigated as a potential candidate for a shadow biosphere.&lt;ref&gt;Cleland (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/14/shadow-biosphere-alien-life-on-earth "Life on Earth… but not as we know it"], Robin McKie, 14 April 2013, The Guardian&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The idea of a shadow biosphere is not widely accepted in biochemistry, and methods used by proponents and conclusions drawn from experiments that purport to show evidence of shadow biospheres have been criticized. For example, evidence that once seemed to support arsenic as a substitute for phosphorus in DNA could have resulted from lab or field contamination, and DNA that includes arsenic is chemically unstable.&lt;ref name=vastag&gt;{{cite news|last=Vastag|first=Brian|title=Debate over arsenic-based life enters a new chapter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/debate-over-arsenic-based-life-enters-a-new-chapter/2011/05/26/AGhk7fCH_story.html?hpid=z9|newspaper=Washington Post|date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of her death at the age of 65, she held the record of being the oldest living alligator in captivity, an honor that landed her a spot in the ''[[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]]''.&lt;ref name="smiley"/&gt; (There are, however, records of alligators that have lived longer since her death). At the time of her death Smiley weighed {{convert|75|kg|lb}} and measured {{convert|265|cm|ft}}, which is small for [[North America]]n alligators (males can grow to a length and weight double that). Only after her death and [[necropsy]] did doctors establish that Smiley was a female.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Ringlinien 3/2010, Björn Johansson, "Vem var Smilet?"&lt;/ref&gt;

Smiley died after it was decided to turn down the heat in her pond to save money. As a result of the lower temperature, the alligator fell ill for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-02-10/news/mn-2374_1_heat-in-aquarium |title=Smiley the 'Gator Dies as Sweden Cuts Heat in Aquarium |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, three years after Smiley's death, she was once again put on display, this time as a cast made by taxidermist Erling Haack for the [[Gothenburg Natural History Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Torkel Hagström (1991) ''Smilets återkomst – Historien om en alligator'', Göteborgs Naturhistoriska Museum&lt;/ref&gt; The cast is made out of armored plaster painted with [[oil paint]]. The eyes were built with double lenses created by Hendén Optik AB. Smiley's physical remains are preserved in the museum's scientific collection, catalogued as number 17246.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Like many other celebrities who worked and lived in Gothenburg, Smiley has a [[Gothenburg tram network|tram]] named after her, the M29 859 tram.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

'''Suicide in Sri Lanka''' is a common cause of unnatural death and a long term [[social issue]].

== Statistics ==
According to a report published in a seminar by Dr. Neil Fernando, head of National Institute of Mental Health in September 2011, almost 4,000 people die by suicide in Sri Lanka every year. Fernando's statistics shows the majority of victims were aged 15 to 44.&lt;ref name="Sri Lanka suicide rate one of the world's highest"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka suicide rate one of the world's highest|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2012/sep2012/sril-s28.shtml|publisher=World Socialist Web Site|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the statistics of Registrar General's office, at the time of independence (1948) suicide rate in Sri Lanka was 9 per 100,000 people. In the 1970s, it rose up to 19 per 100,000, and in the mid 1980s, it reached 33 per 100,000. The latest statistics for Sri Lanka show a suicide rate of 15 per 100,000 .

{{Distinguish|Transhumanism}}

'''Transcendental humanism''' in philosophy considers what is proper treatment of humans outside of nature and decides they have inherent rights, simply from being human.&lt;ref&gt;Ferry, Luc. 2002. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_Z2tctBZg40C&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA135#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false "Transcendental" Humanism]'' Man Made God: The Meaning of Life. University of Chicago Press. {{ISBN|0226244849}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also positive that man is capable of transcending the material self and can also free himself from surrounding influences. An example of this is when he thinks about himself and his character traits as if two different people.&lt;ref&gt;Vanheste, Jeroen. 2007. ''Guardians of the Humanist Legacy: The Classicism of T.S. Eliot's Criterion Network and Its Relevance to Our Postmodern World, Volume 26 of Philosophy of History and Culture'', pp. [https://books.google.com/books?id=lITBxOMRJFQC&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA447#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false 447] &amp; [https://books.google.com/books?id=lITBxOMRJFQC&amp;lpg=PA447&amp;dq=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;pg=PA449#v=onepage&amp;q=Transcendental%20Humanism&amp;f=false 449] Brill. {{ISBN|9004161600}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kant by the term meant humans are both a part of 'creation' and able to transcend reflexive obedience to the laws of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allison|first=Henry E.|title=The Monist, Vol. 55, No. 2, Is Philosophy Human or Transcendental? |year=1971|publisher=Hegeler Institute|pages=182–207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contains Indic text}}

'''''Vibhishana''''' ([[IAST]]: {{IAST|Vibhīṣaṇa}} or '''''Bibhishan''''') was a king of [[Lanka]] in the legendary epic [[Ramayana]]. He was younger brother of the [[Rakshasa]] king [[Ravana]] of Lanka &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.viralsrilanka.com/ravana/ https://www.viralsrilanka.com/ravan-known-ravana/]&lt;/ref&gt;. Though a [[Rakshasa]] himself, Vibhishana was of a noble character and advised Ravana, who kidnapped and abducted [[Sita]], to return her to her husband [[Rama]] in an orderly fashion and promptly which Ravana refused sternly. When Ravana did not heed his advice, Vibhishana deserted Ravana and joined Rama's army. Later, when Rama defeated Ravana, Rama crowned Vibhishana as the king of Lanka.

And return to Ayodhya

In some period of history [[Sinhala people]] have considered  Vibhishana as one of the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] (''satara varam deviyo'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kariyawasam|first=A.G.S|title=The Gods &amp; Deity Worship in Sri Lanka|url=http://www.hotspotsz.com/The_Gods_and_Deity_Worship_in_Sri_Lanka_%28Article-348%29.html|accessdate=26 September 2014|publisher=The Wheel Publication No. 402/404, Buddhist Publication Society|date=|isbn=955-24-0126-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This belief was more prominent in the [[Kotte]] period. According to the ''Ravana Katha'' of Wickramasinghe Adigar, after the defeat of Ravana, Vibhishana transferred the [[Yaksha]] capital from [[Alaka]]mandawa to [[Kelaniya]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mirando Obeysekere, ''Was Maya Dannawa the architect of Sigiriya?'', Daily News, 6 March 2003. http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~lkawgw/mdannawa.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century poem of [[Thotagamuwe Sri Rahula Thera]], the ''sælalihini sandesaya'', [[Sri Lanka Myna|Myna]] is ordered to carry the missive to Vibhishana at his temple in Kelaniya. After the 16th century, he was replaced as a God of the four warrants by the goddess [[Pattini]]. He continues to be worshipped by a diminishing number of adherents, mainly in the Kelaniya area.&lt;ref&gt;Nandasena Ratnapala, ''Folklore of Sri Lanka'', State Printing Corporation, Colombo, 1991; {{ISBN|955-610-089-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Ramayana==
{{Unsourced section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Rameshvaram lingam.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Rama and Sita worship god [[Shiva]] at [[Rameshwaram]] as Vibhishana (right) looks on with Lakshamana, Tumburu and Narada]]

[[File:Vibhishana meeting Ravana.jpg|thumb|250px|Vibhishana meeting Rama]]

Vibhishana had a [[sattvic]] (pure) mind and a sattvic heart. From his early childhood, he spent all his time [[penance|meditating on the name of the Lord]]. Eventually, [[Brahma]] appeared and offered him any boon he wanted. Vibhishana, said that the only thing he wanted was to have his mind fixed at the feet of the Lord as pure as lotus leaves (charan kamal). He prayed that he should be given the strength by which he would always be at the feet of the Lord and that he would receive the darshan (holy sight) of Lord [[Vishnu]]. This prayer was fulfilled and he was able to give up all his wealth and family, and join Rama, who was [[Avatar]] (God incarnate).

Vibhishana was youngest son of Kaikesi and Sage [[Vishrava]], who was son of Sage Pulatsya, one of the Heavenly Guardians. He (Vibhishana) was younger brother of the Lord of Lanka, Ravana and King of Sleep, [[Kumbakarna]]. Even though he was born in the [[Rakshasa|demon race]], he was alert and pious and considered himself a Brahmin, since his father was intuitively such.

Due to Vibhishana's differences with Ravana because he was against the act of kidnapping Sita and most of all because Ravana wanted the throne for himself, he fled Lanka. His mother, [[Kaikesi]], advised him to go and serve Shri Rama, who was at that time assembling an army to conquer Ravana and to recover Sita. He divulged the secrets of Ravana's army and made sure Rama ended up being victorious in the great battle. Lord Rama accepted Vibhishana's service and anointed him the Lord of Lanka after Ravana's death.

In the Lanka War, Vibhishana's knowledge about the secrets of Lanka proved invaluable to Shri Rama. Vibhishana freely divulged many secrets that became key to the success of Rama's attack, including revealing the secret path to the temple of Mata Nikumbala, the family deity of the Pulatsya Clan. In the climatic battle between Rama and Ravana, when Rama was unable to kill Ravana, he revealed the secret of Ravana's death to Rama. He told Rama that Ravana has stored the nectar of immortality in his belly and it is necessary to dry it. Rama then finally killed Ravana. 
While modern readers tend to view the Indian epics with eyes used to seeing clearly defined good and bad characters, Ramayana's characterisation is trying to represent the practical implications of the concept of Dharma. The epic stresses that neither Vibhishana or Kumbhakarna strayed from the path of Dharma and that there is no single way out of a moral dilemma. Ramayana teaches that Kumbhakarna adhered to the Dharma of loyalty to his kin when his advice fails, while Vibhishana chose to oppose his kin when his advice failed.

Symbolically, Vibhishana represents devotion to Shri Rama and as a demon devotee, he shows that the Lord does not distinguish between his followers based on birth or circumstances in life. The same aught can be read in the story of [[Prahlada]] and [[Narasimha]].

When Vibhishana attained the position of the King of Lanka, he turned his subjects from the path of evil to the path of  [[Dharma]] (righteousness). His wife, Queen [[Sarama (Ramayana)|Sarama]] also aided him in this effort. He had a daughter named AnalTe.

When Rama was about to leave [[Ayodhya]] at the end of his reign, Lord Rama in his original form of Shri Vishnu ordered Vibhishana to stay on earth and serve the people and guide them to the path of truth and Dharma. Hence, Vibhishana is considered one of the [[Seven Immortals (Indian mythology)|seven immortals]] or [[Chiranjeevins]]. Lord Vishnu also ordered Vibhishana to pray the family deity of Rama's natal [[Sun Dynasty]], Lord [[Ranganatha]].

==Srirangam==

Vibishana is attached with the legend of [[Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple]], considered the abode of Vishnu on earth and the primary temple of Vishnu on earth. During the coronation of [[Rama]], avatar of Vishnu, [[Vibishana]] was presented the sacrosanct Sri Ranga Vimana. He was carrying it all the way to his kingdom of [[Sri Lanka]] and midway, to rest, he placed the image on the banks of Kaveri. After performing his routine [[Puja (Hinduism)|pooja]], he tried to lift the Vimana, but it could not be lifted.{{cn|date=March 2017}} Mahavishnu appeared to him and said that he desired to stay as Ranganatha in the place, which went on to become [[Srirangam]]. Vishnu also desired to watch the Brahmotsavam at Tirucherai. The festivals of the temple are thus considered sacred.&lt;ref name=M&gt;{{cite book|title=15 Vaishnava Temples of Tamil Nadu|last=M.|first=Rajagopalan|pages=66–75|publisher=Govindaswamy Printers|location=Chennai, India|year=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Vladimir Gaćinović''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Владимир Гаћиновић}}; nicknamed ''Vlado''; 25 May 1890 – 11 August 1917) was a [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] essayist and revolutionary in [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name="Fabijancic2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fabijancic|first=Tony|title=Bosnia: In the Footsteps of Gavrilo Princip|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=twSoAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|date=25 February 2010|publisher=University of Alberta|isbn=978-0-88864-753-5|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the leaders and organizers of the secret cells of the revolutionary movement, [[Young Bosnia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Braničevo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M7fsAAAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Kulturno-prosvetna zajednica Požorevac|page=75&lt;!-- |quote=Владимир Гаћиновић није био формалии воћа у ономе смислу у коме су код нас биле воће политичких партија; али он је и без тога био стварни воћа рсволуционарне Младе Босне, јер је он у њој био најважиија личност којој су ... --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Gaćinović was born in 1890 in the village of [[Kačanj]] within [[Bileća]] municipality, which was then administered by the Austro-Hungarian [[Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (another source has his birthplace as Rudina village, also in Bileća).&lt;ref name="Glenny2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Glenny|first=Misha|title=The Balkans: Nationalism, War, and the Great Powers, 1804-2012: New and Updated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LJqYbknmxjYC&amp;pg=PT244|date=5 September 2012|publisher=House of Anansi|isbn=978-1-77089-274-3|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaćinović was the son of a [[Serbian Orthodox]] priest,&lt;ref name="Hoare2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoare|first=Marko Attila|title=The history of Bosnia: from the Middle Ages to the present day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OWQtAQAAIAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Saqi|isbn=978-0-86356-953-1|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was also a [[hajduk]]. He completed elementary school in [[Bileća]] in 1901 and finished six grades of high school in [[Mostar]] between 1901 and 1907. The high school had been home to two secret societies since 1905, one of which, "Matica", was led by [[Dimitrije Mitrinović]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Istorijski glasnik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnE6AQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Naučna knjiga|page=96|quote=Рођен 1890. у билећком селу Качњу, као син свештеника који је био и хајдук, основну школу Гаћиновић је свршио... }}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seventeen years old, Gaćinović was a member of the literary society which served as a front for "Matica", and published a critically noted essay about the raconteur [[Petar Kočić]].&lt;ref name="Митриновић1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Митриновић|first=Димитрије|title=Sabrana djela: O književnosti i umjetnosti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iY5iAAAAMAAJ|year=1991|publisher=Свјетлост|page=23&lt;!-- |quote=...терарног клуба »Матица« сачињавали су Драго Перовић, Ва- сиљ Поповић и Перо Слијепчевић, затим Јован Старовић, Бог- дан Жерајић и Владимир Гаћиновић, који је у »Матици«, као седамнаестогодишњи младић, поднео .. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria-Hungary's [[Bosnian crisis|complete annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in 1908 angered young revolutionaries active in that region. They rejected the conciliatory ideas of [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] and his [[Austro-Slavism|cultural struggle within the Austrian monarchy]]; instead, they embraced the notion of "Kosovo [[tyrannicide]]", à la [[Miloš Obilić]], as a method of political struggle.&lt;ref name="Мастиловић2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Мастиловић|first=Драга|title=Херцеговина у Краљевини Срба, Хрвата и Словенаца: 1918-1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_motAQAAIAAJ|year=2009|publisher=Филип Вишњић|isbn=978-86-7363-604-7|page=35&lt;!-- |quote=Анексија Босне и Херцеговине јако је погодила те младе рево- луционаре, па неки од њих врло рано напуштају Масарикове идеје „културне борбе" и прихватају култ „косовског тираноубиства" као метод политичке борбе. --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaćinović was the actual ideologue&lt;ref name="armije1968"&gt;{{cite book|author=Belgrade (Serbia).

In 1911, he became the only Young Bosnia leader to join [[Black Hand (Serbia)|Unification or Death]], [[Dragutin Dimitrijević]]'s secret society.&lt;ref name=Glenny2012 /&gt; In the same year, the term ''Mlada Bosna'' (Young Bosnia) was popularized in an article by Gaćinović, and modeled by him after [[Young Italy]] and [[Nabat|Young Russia]].&lt;ref name=Glenny2012 /&gt; In 1912, Gaćinović publicized a letter by one of his associates, with whom he fully agreed. Titled "Cry of a Desperate One" ({{lang-sr|Крик очајника}}), it attacked the younger generations, in particular students at foreign universities, for lack of idealism and opportunism, petty individualism, and conformity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Историјски гласник: орган Друштва историчара СР Србије|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7nZMAQAAIAAJ|year=1967|publisher=Društvo|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some sources, this was merely an attempt to avoid prosecution for his involvement; however, other authors have it that Gaćinović was sincerely opposed to the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dedijer|first=Vladimir|authorlink=Vladimir Dedijer|title=Sarajevo hiljadu devetstso četraneste|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QTdIAAAAMAAJ|year=1966|publisher=Prosveta|page=522&lt;!-- |quote=Могло би се претпоставити да је Гаћиновић ова писма пи- сао одмах после 28. јуна 1914, да би скинуо са себе одговорност за атентат и његове последице.

During [[World War I]], Gaćinović spent time as a volunteer in the [[French Navy]], after which he traveled to the [[United States]] to seek aid and volunteers for Serbia. He was poisoned with [[arsenic]] in August 1917 in Fribourg, Switzerland, by either the Austrians, the French, the Serbian police, or by one of Serbia's rival political factions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
