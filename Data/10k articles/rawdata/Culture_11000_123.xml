The '''absent-minded professor''' is a [[stock character]] of popular fiction, usually portrayed as a talented [[academic]] whose academic brilliance is accompanied by below-par functioning in other areas, leading to forgetfulness and mistakes. One explanation of this is that highly talented individuals often have unevenly distributed capabilities, being brilliant in their field of choice but below average on other measures of ability. Alternatively, they are considered to be so engrossed in their field of study that they forget their surroundings. 

The [[phrase]] "absent-minded professor" is also commonly used more generally in [[English language|English]] to describe people who are so engrossed in their "own world" that they fail to keep track of their surroundings. It is a common [[stereotype]] that [[professor]]s get so obsessed with their research that they pay little attention to anything else.

The stereotype is very old: the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] biographer [[Diogenes Laërtius]] wrote that the philosopher [[Thales]] walked at night with his eyes focused on the heavens and, as a result, fell down a [[Water well|well]].&lt;ref&gt;Diogenes Laërtius, ''Lives of the Eminent Philosophers'', "Thales"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of real absent-minded professors==
[[Isaac Newton]],&lt;ref name=name1&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=2OCKrF6YNKEC&amp;lpg=PR9&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.ix&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Smith]], [[André-Marie Ampère]], [[Jacques Hadamard]], [[Sewall Wright]], [[Nikola Tesla]], [[Norbert Wiener]], [[Archimedes]], [[Pierre Curie]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.br/books?id=s3vieJGqDooC&amp;lpg=PA76&amp;dq=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q=feynman%20absent-minded%20scientist&amp;f=false], p.76&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Einstein]]&lt;ref name=name1/&gt; were all scholars considered to be absent-minded &amp;ndash; their attention absorbed by their academic studies. [[William Archibald Spooner]], who gave his name to the [[spoonerism]], was known for his [[absent-mindedness]] and eccentricity.

==Fictitious absent-minded professors==
"Doc" [[Emmett Brown]] from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' is an example of an absent-minded professor in film. Another example is the title character in the film ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' and its less successful film remakes, all based on the short story "A Situation of Gravity" by [[Samuel W. Taylor]]. 

Examples in television include [[Hubert J. Farnsworth|Professor Farnsworth]] in ''[[Futurama]]'', [[Professor Frink]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'', [[Walter Bishop (Fringe)|Walter Bishop]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television series ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'', and Professor Von Schlemmer in ''[[Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog]]''. Multo, one of the characters in the children's series ''[[The Zula Patrol]]'', is another example of an absent-minded professor. 

Professor Kokintz in ''[[The Mouse That Roared]]'' by [[Leonard Wibberley]] is an example from literature. [[Professor Branestawm]], created in the 1930s by [[Norman Hunter (author)|Norman Hunter]], is an earlier example of the archetype, and [[Jacques Paganel]] from the [[Jules Verne]]'s 1867 novel ''[[In Search of the Castaways]]'' is probably the codifier of the archetype in the modern literature. Professor Caractacus Potts in the story of ''[[Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (novel)|Chitty Chitty Bang Bang]]'' qualifies as an absent-minded inventor. 

Comic strip examples include [[Professor Calculus]] in ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''; Eli Eon in ''[[Little Orphan Annie]]''; and Professor Edgewise, a minor recurring character in [[Marvel Family]] stories. 

[[Isaac Kleiner]] from the ''[[Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]'' saga and Professor Harold MacDougal from ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' are examples in videogames.

The archetype is sometimes mixed with that of the [[mad scientist]], often for comic effect, as in the [[Jerry Lewis]] film ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' or the Profesor Bacterio in the ''[[Mortadelo y Filemón]]'' comics and movies. However, the mad scientist archetype usually has malevolent connotations, while the absent-minded professor is typically characterized as benevolent. 

The fictional absent-minded professor is often a college professor of science or engineering; in the [[fantasy]] genre, a similar character may appear as a [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]]. Examples of this include the characterisation of [[Merlin]] in ''[[The Sword in the Stone (novel)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' (particularly in [[The Sword in the Stone (film)|the Disney adaptation]]) and [[Albus Dumbledore]] in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14292">'''''AquaNox''''' is a series of [[submarine]]-based [[first-person shooter]]/[[Vehicle simulation game|simulation]] [[video game]]s set in the distant future. The collection includes ''AquaNox'', ''AquaNox 2: Revelation'' and ''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears''. The predecessor and the starter of the series is the [[MS-DOS]] title ''[[Archimedean Dynasty]]''.

==Concept==
In the middle of the 22nd century, raw materials on [[earth]] became increasingly scarce and as the end of the resources loomed, people began to prospect for resources on the ocean floor. This resulted in the construction of mining stations beneath the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Indian Ocean|Indian ocean]]s. Many countries set up these deep-sea stations where workers and engineers extracted the oceans' treasures. Nevertheless, the output was far from enough to cover an ever-increasing demand. When the natural resources on Earth's surface were depleted, a time of destruction and wars began. In the fight over the planet's last remaining resources, alliances fell apart, countries became hostile and old conflicts flared up.

With increasing cruelty and senselessness, man destroyed the very basis of life on the surface of the earth. After a series of resource wars, nuclear weapons [[nuclear holocaust|completed the destruction]] that man had not yet finished with his industrial pollution. When the last glimmer of hope for humanity's survival was extinguished, people fled into the depths of the oceans.

The former extraction stations became the last refuge of those fortunate enough to be able to pay the price of entry into the underwater world. The poorest of the poor were left behind, condemned to die in a desolate world polluted by radioactivity. Life outside the oceans became impossible as the continents were flooded by rising sea levels and a harsh [[nuclear winter]] covered most of the oceans and the shrinking surface landmass of the planet with a layer of [[radioactive dust]], snow and ice many meters thick. A 40-meter thick layer of dead organic matter, the so-called POM layer, covered the oceans. Not a single ray of sunlight penetrated the dense particulate layer that plunged the world into a darkness like none other. Nevertheless, mankind rose one last time to a new life, the only life, in a dead new world. This world was humanity's creation, and was now called Aqua. The following events take place in the middle of the 27th century.

Today, in the year 2661, mankind lives in gigantic cities underwater. Aqua is divided into political power blocs, such as the Aquatoria of the capitalistic, democratically governed Atlantic Federation, the [[oligarchy]] of the Arabic Clans Union and the [[monarchy|monarchist]] Russo-Japanese [[Shogunate]]. In the South Pacific lies the Tornado Zone, stirred up by surface storms, where an anarchist pack of mercenaries, pirates, buccaneers and outlaws gathers, ever ready to sell their friends and their souls.

A single company has long ago monopolized many industries necessary for human survival underwater—EnTrOx, which stands for "Energy-Transportation-[[Oxygen]]". New technologies allow extremely fast underwater travel. However, many old technologies are lost or have become useless. For example, due to the high amounts of [[nuclear fallout|fallout]] in the atmosphere, satellite communication and [[GPS|global positioning]] are impossible, although some organizations are looking for ways to restore these abilities.

The player's task is to complete a series of story-related combat missions. During the course of the missions additional support and story elements are revealed by the secondary characters. The enemies range from hostile vessels to alien or artificial life-forms such as bionts.

==Episodes==

The Aquanox series include the following games, listed by the release in a [[chronological order]]:

===''Archimedean Dynasty''===
{{Main|Archimedean Dynasty}}

===''AquaNox''===
{{Infobox video game
|title=AquaNox

|engine=[[KRASS engine]]
|released=30 November 2001
|genre=Futuristic Sub Sim

}}

The player once again jumps into the role of Emerald "Deadeye" Flint. After the Bionts are defeated, Flint goes back to being a  mercenary as a leader of a Biont-hunting task-force. Things turn for the worse when his submarine, the ''[[Succubus]]'', is stolen on one of the stations. The game begins with one of Flint's dubious acquaintances giving him an old, barely working sub and several missions to get him started.

Throughout the game, Flint earns money by completing missions, allowing him to purchase better subs, weapons and equipment. The new equipment appears throughout the game, available for purchase, as the player progress in the storyline. Generally speaking, the player is allowed to buy a new boat and a new set of weaponry per chapter. While on stations, Flint can speak with various characters in order to get new missions and deepen the atmosphere of the game.

The former system of upgrading the vessel with a variety of defensive turrets has been simplified by fixing the player's view to the cockpit as well as permitting the usage of only two on hull installed cannons. As the result of this change, the controls of the submarine have been adapted to the first-person shooter's mouse-based layout, removing the need for the joystick, thus the game has compromised its tactical depth in order to increase the intensity of combat. This change has raised critique among the reviewers, stating that the developers' focus fell inadequately on the visual performance rather than the actual gameplay of its predecessor. {{quote|...But while ''Archimedean Dynasty'' was a complex, mission-based simulation with trading and privateering, ''AquaNox'' is an arcade-style action game that abandons or greatly simplifies those elements. Combat is fast paced and more similar in style to Quake's, or even a rail shooter's, than it is to the more tactical battles in other underwater sims.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first= |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html |title=AquaNox Review |publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}

The game was one of the first applications to fully use the [[Transform and lighting|T&amp;L effects]] by supporting the ''[[NVIDIA]] Geforce 3 Ti'' graphics accelerator.{{quote|Considering the game engine has been used for months to market Nvidia's flagship GeForce 3 video card, it's no surprise that the graphics are outstanding. The game has been designed to take advantage of all the high-end capabilities of the GeForce and its latest generation of cards, and the environments look amazing as a result. Textures are colourful and extremely detailed, and there are numerous little graphical touches, such as chips that flake off underwater hills hit by your projectile weapons.|{{cite news |last=Desslock |first=  |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox/review.html?page=2 |title=AquaNox Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2001-11-30}} }}

The game includes a vast amount of ''true'' information on oceans, such as origins of different species, their specifics and man's adaptation to submarine life. The game manual consists of two chapters explaining various terms and facts that have been mentioned throughout the course of the story.

===''AquaNox 2: Revelation''===
{{Infobox video game
|title= AquaNox 2: Revelation
|image= AquaNox 2.png
|developer= [[Massive Development]]

|released= 22 August 2003
|genre= Futuristic Sub Sim
|modes= [[Single player]]
|platforms= [[Microsoft Windows]]
}}

The plot of the game is based around William Drake, the last remnant of the old aristocratic, industrialist family. After the bankrupt of the familial industry and the death of the protagonist's grandmother, young William Drake sets 'sail' for open seas on the last freighter of the ''Drake Enterprises''. The cargo ship soon gets taken over by a group of mercenaries, while Drake rushes out to answer a distress call. While sparing his life, the group of seven invaders seize control of the boat, thus binding Williams' fate to their own. The protagonist sees no other options than to unite himself with his new crew, hoping for the best.

The game features a total of four unique, playable and upgradeable gunships. For the completion of the game the player will most likely switch boats depending on the mission's content. While certain missions will require speed and stealth, others will virtually enforce the presence of a heavy arsenal and thick plating. The game features a large variety of projectile armament as well as a set of torpedoes and a collection of energy based weaponry, including lasers and [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] launchers. While most weapons aren't necessarily at odds with the game's underwater environments, the presence of laser-based arms decreases the plausibility of such fights. The torpedo combat is similar to the missile engagements of most flight simulators and space shooters, where the pilot is expected to release flares and perform classic evasion manoeuvres.

The transportation is generally a simple matter of following the navigation points spread out through the game. The ship's controls can be switched from the [[First Person Shooter|FPS]] mode to Simulation Mode via a predefined shortcut, where the latter steering scheme switches the horizontal scrolling of the mouse from turning the cockpit horizontally to rotating the hull around its axis. Reaching the surface is not possible due to the depth-range limitation, which binds the player to the underwater world yet gives certain disadvantages during the combat.

In response to criticisms of poor interaction with other characters in AquaNox, a new dialogue system was added in the sequel. Between missions the player is able to initiate conversations while on board of the freighter as well as in the oceanic cities. The initiation of the conversations is mandatory; however due to the absence of interaction during the dialogues, the outcome of the game is not open-ended. The actions and replies of the protagonist often appear irrational and unnatural. {{quote|Clicking on the person opens up another window that shows the conversation between your character, the absurdly naive William Drake, and the person you've clicked on. These conversations are designed to give the game a plot, but more often than not, the sequences are filled with near-meaningless babble.|{{cite news |last=Gerstmann |first=Jeff |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/action/aquanox2revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamespot.com |date=2003-09-29}} }}

Like William, the other characters in the game do not tend to appear natural by neither showing conscious thought, neither having distinct goals nor developing at all over the period of the adventure. While perhaps being the intention of the playwright, the secondary personages do not show any depth or authenticity, resulting in a group of stereotypic knights, pirates, outcasts and nymphomaniacs. {{quote|As in Aquanox the story is once more handled via boring, unsubstantial and sometimes even featherbrained dialogues, which fortunately can be stopped by using the Escape-button. This one flaw renders the story of the game completely useless, as only few fragments of it actually find their way to the player. | {{cite news |last=Deim |first=I. |url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/aquanox_2_revelation/review.html |title=Aquanox 2 Revelation Review|publisher=Gamershell.com}} }}

===''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears''===

''AquaNox: The Angel's Tears'' is the [[PlayStation 2]] [[remake]] of ''AquaNox 2: Revelation''. The title did not pass Sony's [[software quality assurance]] test and as [[Massive Development]] had already been closed by [[JoWood Productions]], the release was cancelled.

===AquaNox: Deep Descent===
At [[Gamescom 2014]], [[Nordic Games (company)|Nordic Games]] presented a [[tech demo]] of a new iteration from the Aquanox series. The Nordic Games officials confirmed they are working on a new iteration of the game. The demo was created using Unreal Engine 3 and showed a bit of the environment and one ship model prototype along with a hangar interface.&lt;ref&gt;http://extreme.pcgameshardware.de/actionspiele/243518-aquanox-3-nachfolger-namens-aquanox-deep-descent-offiziell-entwicklung-durch-nordic-games-vorstellung-2014-auf-der-gamescom-erste-videos-des-pre-alpha-prototypen-update-19-08-2014-a.html&lt;/ref&gt; The game was successfully [[crowdfunded]] through [[Kickstarter]] on the 11th of September 2015 by amassing USD 95,979, surpassing its USD 75,000 goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/806010995/aquanox-deep-descent/description&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected to be released sometime in 2018.

'''''Black Rock''''' is a 2012 American [[Horror film|horror]]-[[Thriller (genre)|thriller film]] directed by [[Katie Aselton]], based on a screenplay by her husband [[Mark Duplass]]. The film premiered on January 21, 2012, at the [[2012 Sundance Film Festival]] and was released theatrically on May 17, 2013. ''Black Rock'' stars [[Katie Aselton]], [[Lake Bell]], and [[Kate Bosworth]] as three friends that reunite after years apart on a remote island, only for them to have to fight for their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SUNDANCE 2012: KATIE ASELTON ON "BLACK ROCK"|url=http://www.fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6424:sundance-2011-katie-aselton-on-black-rock&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=167|publisher=Fangoria|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

Sarah ([[Kate Bosworth]]) invites her childhood friends, Abby ([[Katie Aselton]]) and Lou ([[Lake Bell]]), to a remote island that they once spent time at in their youth, in hopes of bringing their distant group back together. Though Abby and Lou are reluctant, they go with Sarah to the island.  While there, they use a hand drawn map to try to find a time capsule they had buried as kids.  They give up after Abby picks a fight with Lou over Lou having slept with her boyfriend years ago, something Abby has never gotten over and which ruined their friendship.

On their first night while camping on the beach, they run into Henry ([[Will Bouvier]]), Derek ([[Jay Paulson]]) and Alex ([[Anslem Richardson]]), three veteran soldiers who are hunting on the island.  Lou recognizes Henry as the younger brother of a former classmate and Abby invites the three to camp with them.  While drunk, Abby flirts with Henry and eventually takes him into the woods to make out.  When she tries to stop, Henry becomes aggressive and tries to rape her.  Abby hits him in the head with a large rock.

Hearing Abby's screams, the rest of the group come running and find Henry dead. Abby tries to explain what happened but the men don't believe her and become enraged that she's murdered their best friend. Derek and Alex knock the three women unconscious. When they wake, they are tied together by the wrists on the beach. Derek, the more aggressive of the two men, is adamant about killing them, but Alex tries to stop him. Abby goads Derek into letting her go so they can fight hand-to-hand. When he does, Lou tackles him as Sarah throws sand at Alex's face to prevent him from attacking. The three women then separately escape and hide, and the two men vow to kill them.

After hiding separately, they meet up at a childhood fort and decide to wait until nightfall before trying to reach their boat. Upon doing so, they discover the two men have cut the rope that tied the boat to the shore, sending it floating out to sea. Abby and Lou both believe they could swim it but Sarah believes it's too far and that they'd die from hypothermia before reaching it. As they crawl towards the shore, Sarah loudly protests the plan and runs back towards the tree line where she is shot in the head, by the men.  Lou and Abby try to swim for the boat but cannot make it, instead heading back to another part of shore.  Alex falls down a hill while chasing them and breaks his leg.  Lou and Abby return to the fort and huddle together for warmth.  They vow to "stop being stalked and start stalking."
 
In the morning, they find the time capsule and retrieve a Swiss army knife from inside. They sharpen sticks into weapons. As they do, they talk about the past and reconcile. They search the island and find the hunters camping on the beach, with an injured Alex sleeping nearby. Abby crawls over to Alex, prepared to slit his throat.  However, she accidentally wakes him and he cries out for Derek.  Lou runs at Derek, distracting him and Abby wrestles with Alex, eventually shooting him with his own shotgun.  Derek chases Lou and Abby finally cornering them in an open field.  He fires his gun, but realizes he has run out of bullets.  He draws his hunting knife and the two women attack him from opposite directions.  They fight, with a wounded Lou eventually slitting Derek's throat with his knife.  Lou and Abby take the men's boat and sail back to civilization.

==Development==
[[Katie Aselton]] began developing the film in 2011, expressing her interest in directing a thriller that audiences would see as realistic.&lt;ref name="THR"&gt;{{cite news|title=Katie Aselton to Star in and Direct Thriller 'Black Rock' (Cannes)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/risky-business/katie-aselton-star-direct-thriller-187336|publisher=|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2013-03-03|first=Jay A.|last=Fernandez|date=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Duplass]] was confirmed as writing the screenplay and the couple sought to raise funds for the film through [[crowdsourcing]] on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name="THR" /&gt; [[Kate Bosworth]] and [[Lake Bell]] were signed to ''Black Rock'' to play Sarah and Lou, with Submarine Entertainment handling sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katie Aselton to Direct and Star in Black Rock|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=77448|publisher=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception for the film has been mixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Does This ‘Black Rock’ Trailer Insult The Very Institution Of Horror*?|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3205270/does-this-black-rock-trailer-insult-the-very-institution-of-horror/|publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] it has an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 54 critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Rock|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_rock_2011/|publisher=[[Flixster]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] it has a weighted average score of 46% based on reviews from 19 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-rock &lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer for [[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film three out of five stars, questioning the intelligence of the female characters over what he saw as "stupid choices" and "lack of character logic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bloody Disgusting Staff|title=Review: Black Rock|url= http://bloody-disgusting.com/film/158635/black-rock/ |publisher=Bloody Disgusting|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justin Lowe of [[The Hollywood Reporter]] gave a mixed review, commenting that although the film was "satisfying", the film's female characters "hew perhaps too closely to genre stereotypes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Black Rock: Sundance Film Review|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movie/black-rock/review/284563|publisher=|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=2013-03-03|first=Justin|last=Lowe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alyssa Rosenberg of [[Think Progress]] praised the film, saying "There’s something really powerful about the promise of a piece of popular culture that insists that a woman has the right to say no at any point in a sexual encounter, no matter how flirtatious she’s been or how willing she’s seemed up until that point, and that she has the right to say no without being judged or attacked."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Rock And Feminism As Horror Movie|url=http://thinkprogress.org/alyssa/2012/12/04/1270001/black-rock-and-feminism-as-horror-movie/ |publisher=Think Progress|accessdate=2013-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kronkorken.gif|thumb|Using a bottle opener]]
A '''bottle opener''' is a device that enables the removal of [[Crown cork|metal bottle cap]]s from [[bottle]]s. More generally, it might be thought to include [[Corkscrew (tool)|corkscrew]]s used to remove cork or plastic stoppers from [[wine bottles]].

A metal bottle cap is affixed to the rim of the neck of a bottle by being pleated or ruffled around the rim. A bottle opener is a specialized [[lever]] inserted beneath the pleated metalwork, which uses a point on the bottle cap as a [[wikt:fulcrum|fulcrum]] on which to [[wikt:pivot|pivot]].

==Varieties==
There are several distinct designs of such bottle openers. Wall mounted openers are typically found behind [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s in [[Public house|pub]]s, whilst hand-tool bottle openers tend to be found and used in domestic environments. Whereas the functional elements of bottle openers (a tooth or lip to catch the underside of the cap, a fulcrum across which to exert the force that will remove the cap, and usually a lever for mechanical advantage) tend to be consistent (sometimes the lever is the bottle itself), their aesthetic design is subject to very great variety, and a great many decorative types are available.

The following varieties of bottle opener are used around the world used in a professional capacity.

===The crown cork opener===
{{main article|Churchkey}}
[[Image:Churchkey patent 1996550.jpg|thumb|Churchkey from 3 angles]]
A specific style of bottle opener is known as a [[churchkey]].

Invented at the same time as the [[crown cork]], it is the original bottle opener. But as well as being portable it also comes as a fixed device to be attached to vertical surfaces, often with a tray to catch the bottle tops. It does not open wine bottles. It is class 2 fulcrum type.

{{clear}}

===Simple bottle opener===
[[Image:Bottle Opener.jpg|thumb|A simple bottle opener]]
A simple opener is a piece of metal with a rectangular or rounded opening in one end and a solid handle large enough to be gripped between the thumb and forefingers on the other.  The opening contains a lip that is placed under the edge of the bottle top, pulling it off when upward force is applied to the handle end of the opener.  This type of opener is small and durable, so it is frequently used as a [[key fob]].  
{{clear}}

===Speed opener ('bar blade')===
[[Image:Bar-blade.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] branded "bar blade", front and back]]
The speed opener is a flat blade of steel approximately 4&amp;nbsp;cm wide and 16&amp;nbsp;cm long with a thumb hole at one end and a letterbox cut at the other to remove the crown seals from a bottle. They go under the names 'speed opener', 'popper', 'mamba', ‘bar key’, and most popularly 'bar blade'. The thumb hole may be used to pull bottles out of ice, by placing the hole over the neck of the bottle, then lifting it.  The speed opener is widely used by professional [[bartender]]s in [[Canada]], the [[United States]], and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Carried in the pocket or against the body or on a zip string, it is both convenient and fast for the modern bartender. It is advantageous in that it is easy to open several bottles in rapid succession, and with more flair than other types of bottle opener. Consequently, 'bar blading' is often part of [[Flair bartending|bar flair]] routines.

===Wall-mounted===
[[Image:Bottle opener.JPG|thumb|A wall-mounted bottle opener]]
Works the same as the lever variation, except that it is attached to the wall, to allow for simpler bottle-opening, which can be done with one hand. The bottle cap can fall into a bottle cap catcher mounted below the opener, or you can retrieve it after removal from the bottle. 
A variant to this are similar types of openers mounted on older [[vending machines]].{{clear}}

===Magnetic catch bottle opener===
[[File:Magnetic Bottle Opener.jpg|thumb|Magnetic Bottle Opener]]
This is a bottle opener with a magnet to catch the lids. {{clear}}

===Multi-opener===
Also known as a [[Beverage Opener]], these usually includes a bottle opener of the simple bottle opener style but includes various other openers such as for [[plastic bottle]]s or metal [[beverage can]]s.

=== Novelty/designer ===

In recent years{{what|date=March 2018}} the bottle opener has taken many forms to appeal to young professionals. A few examples of the designer bottle opener include a surfboard shaped bottle opener, baseball cap with bottle opener in the visor, the inclusion of a bottle opener in the sole of a flip flop, in the form of a ring that can be worn, as part of a belt buckle, or in the different shapes for sports, a guitar, cowboy boot or car key. Recent{{what|date=March 2018}} improvements come with the invent{{what|date=March 2018}} of High Definition graphics{{what|date=March 2018}} with epoxy dome on chrome plated versions of the bottle opener. Novelty bottle openers became a popular promotional product for many beer brands with the advent of the surfboard bottle opener by Jim Wysopal from [http://openers.beer Openers Plus] in California 1990.{{dubious|date=March 2018}}

== Technique ==
Under most use, a bottle opener functions as a [[second-class lever]]: the fulcrum is the far end of the bottle opener, placed on the top of the crown, with the output at the near end of the bottle opener, on the crown edge, ''between'' the fulcrum and the hand: in these cases, one pushes ''up'' on the lever.

However, one may instead use it as a [[first-class lever]], by placing the near end on the top of the crown, and the far end under the crown edge, then pushing ''down'' on the lever (thus the output is on the ''opposite side'' of the fulcrum from the hand). This is particularly used with bar blades, which form an [[obtuse angle]]. Mechanically, this is a marginally less effective lever, as the effort arm is shorter, but the action of pushing down is marginally anatomically easier.

While most lever-type bottle openers can be used in either configuration, the designed use can be determined if one of the edges is curved, in which case this edge is designed to sit in the middle of the crown, as the curve concentrates pressure, deforming the crown, and a curved edge does not connect with as much of the crown edge, hence being suboptimal and slipping more frequently if used to connect with the crown edge. This difference can be seen in comparing the traditional opener and contemporary bar blade at right.

== Corkscrews ==
{{Main article|Corkscrew}}

===Waiter's friend===
[[Image:Opened Waiters.JPG|thumb|right|Opened Waiter's Friend]]
The 'waiter's friend or 'wine key' consists of a flat housing (often plastic covered) similar to a [[Swiss army knife]] with a corkscrew and lever (which doubles as crown cork opener) with either a knife or auto-foiler to remove the foil top of wine bottles and then the cork. Designed to be screwed in to within 1 full rotation before the end of the screw (more will pierce the bottom of the cork and result in extra flotsam on the surface of your wine) before levering out the cork.

===Mounted corkscrew===
{{main|Mounted corkscrew}}
This tool is used by businesses that need to open a large volume of wine efficiently and without waste or breakage. It is a large brass tubular device, fixed at a 45° angle to the bar, with a lever pivoted halfway and extending towards the user. The bottle's neck is inserted firmly in the lower aperture of the tube and the lever pulled down firmly and steadily to the bottom. This drives a corkscrew into the cork at a regular depth each time. When the lever is returned to its original position it extracts the cork. When the bottle is removed pull the lever to expose the cork at the bottom, it loosens the cork and returns the lever firmly to its starting position, whereupon the cork will then fall out.

===Twin prong cork puller===
[[Image:ah-so.png|thumb|right|A twin prong cork puller]]
The twin prong cork puller, also called the Butler's Friend, is shaped like a large key with a squared oval handle about 5&amp;nbsp;cm × 8&amp;nbsp;cm, and two thin metal strips, approximately 10&amp;nbsp;cm long, 5&amp;nbsp;mm wide, and 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm thick, descending in tandem from the center of the handle. The two strips are spread open and then wiggled into the space between the cork and the bottle on either side. Once fully in place, a turn and pull of the handle causes friction to turn the cork and pull it out of the bottle.

'''Capri pants''' (also known as '''three quarter pants''', '''capris''', '''crop pants''', '''clam-diggers''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/clam-diggers?showCookiePolicy=true "clam-diggers"] ''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.

They typically come down to between [[knee]] and [[Calf (leg)|calf]] or [[ankle]] length. Capris are popular with people in many countries; especially in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Asia.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Capri pants were introduced by fashion designer [[Sonja de Lennart]] in 1948, and were also popularised by English couturier [[Bunny Roger]]&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;{{cite news |first=Clive |last=Fisher |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bunny-roger-1270036.html |title=Obituary: Bunny Roger |newspaper=The Independent |date=29 April 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407211742/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-bunny-roger-1270036.html |archivedate=7 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The name of the pants is derived from the Italian isle of [[Capri]], where they rose to popularity in the late 1950s and early '60s.&lt;ref name="Ancient"&gt;"Ancient Capri Still Casts Its Powerful Spell". (29 June 2008). ''[[Boston Globe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The American actress [[Audrey Hepburn]] was among the first movie stars who wore capris, most notably in the film [[Roman Holiday]], and the pants quickly became synonymous with her classic style.

==Popularity==
Capris' acceptance in the United States was influenced by the 1960s television series ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]''. The character Laura Petrie, the young housewife played by [[Mary Tyler Moore]], caused a fashion sensation – and some mild controversy – by wearing snug-fitting capri pants during the show's run.&lt;ref name="Waldron2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vince Waldron|title=The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book: The Definitive History and Ultimate Viewer's Guide to Television's Most Enduring Comedy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCTj8iffkKAC&amp;pg=PA128|year=2001|publisher=Applause|isbn=978-1-55783-453-9|pages=128–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid 1960s, capri-style tight-fitting [[cargo pants]] became popular among teenage boys; a good example was the superstar teen actor of that era, [[Luke Halpin]], who wore them in some episodes of the popular ''[[Flipper (1964 TV series)|Flipper]]''.{{fact|date=August 2018}} After a drop in popularity during the 1970s through the 1990s, capris returned to favor in the mid 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GN0E_diWbAC&amp;pg=PA68|date=1 June 2005|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=978-0-7407-9307-3|pages=68–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish tennis player [[Rafael Nadal]] wore capri pants in the majority of his matches [[Rafael Nadal#Equipment and endorsements|before 2009]].&lt;ref name="Ueda"&gt;"Ueda's Commentary on Modern Tennis Champions".

'''Classical music''' is [[art music]] produced or rooted in the traditions of [[Western culture]], including both [[Religious music|liturgical]] (religious) and [[secular music|secular]] music. While a more precise term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]), this article is about the broad span of time from before the 6th century AD to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"&gt;"Classical", ''The Oxford Concise Dictionary of Music'', ed. Michael Kennedy, (Oxford, 2007), ''Oxford Reference Online''. Retrieved July 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the [[common practice period|common-practice period]]. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:
* the [[ancient music]] period, before 500 AD
* the [[early music]] period, which includes
** the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) including

** [[Contemporary classical music|contemporary]] (1945 or 1975–present)

European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European classical and some [[popular music]]al forms by its system of [[musical notation|staff notation]], in use since about the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §III, 1(vi): Plainchant: Pitch-specific notations, 13th–16th centuries|author1=Geoffrey Chew|author2=Richard Rastall|last-author-amp=yes|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Says absolutely nothing at all about European art music, let alone what may or may not distinguish it from other types of music. Moreover, III, 1(vi) is specifically addressed to developments in the 13th-to-16th centuries, saying nothing about the origins of staff notation.--&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] (which form the [[melody|melodies]], [[bassline]]s and [[Chord (music)|chords]]), [[tempo]], [[Metre (music)|metre]] and [[rhythm]]s for a piece of music.{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Staff notation merely indicates pitches and durations. It does not by itself indicate whether these result in melody, bassline, chords}} This can leave less room for practices such as [[musical improvisation|improvisation]] and ''[[ad libitum]]'' [[Ornament (music)|ornamentation]], which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Japan, §III, 1: Notation systems: Introduction|author=Malm, W.P.|author2=Hughes, David W.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=The article states that improvisation "hardly exists in Japanese music."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Notation, §I: General|author=Ian D. Bent|author2=David W. Hughes|author3=Robert C. Provine|author4=Richard Rastall|author5=Anne Kilmer|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017|reason=The article says that notation "may provide a framework for improvisation", not that it leaves less room for it}}&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Popular music, §I, 4: Europe &amp; North America: Genre, form, style|author=[[Richard Middleton (musicologist)|Middleton, Richard]]|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; styles such as [[jazz]] and [[blues]]. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song ([[strophic]]) form or a derivation of this form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the [[symphony]], [[concerto]], [[fugue]], [[sonata]], and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as [[opera]], [[cantata]], and [[Mass (music)|mass]].&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"&gt;Julian Johnson (2002) ''Who Needs Classical Music?: Cultural Choice and Musical Value'': p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "classical music" did not appear until the early 19th century, in an attempt to distinctly canonize the period from [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] to [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] as a golden age.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rushton, Julian]], ''Classical Music'', (London, 1994), 10&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to "classical music" recorded by the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' is from about 1829.&lt;ref name="Music 2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OED_Online_Classical"&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=The OED Online|url=http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50040930?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=classical&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10|accessdate=May 10, 2007|title=classical, a.|year=2007|quote=1829   V.

Novello Mozart Pilgrimage (1955) 181   This is the place I should come to every Sunday when I wished to hear classical music correctly and judiciously performed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}
Given the wide range of styles in European classical music, from Medieval [[plainchant]] sung by monks to Classical and Romantic symphonies for orchestra from the 1700s and 1800s to avant-garde [[atonal]] compositions for solo piano from the 1900s, it is difficult to list characteristics that can be attributed to all works of that type. However, there are characteristics that classical music contains that few or no other genres of music contain,&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Kennedy (music critic)|Kennedy, Michael]] (2006), ''The Oxford Dictionary of Music'', p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; such as the use of [[music notation]]{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=If "classical music" began in 500, then at least five centuries of it were without notation.}} and the performance of complex forms of solo instrumental works (e.g., the [[fugue]]). Furthermore, while the symphony did not exist prior to the late 18th century, the [[Orchestra|symphony ensemble]]—and the [[Symphony|works written for it]]—have become a defining feature of classical music.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Literature===
The key characteristic of European classical music that distinguishes it from [[popular music]] and [[folk music]] is that the repertoire tends to be written down in [[musical notation]], creating a musical part or [[Sheet music|score]]. This score typically determines details of rhythm, pitch, and, where two or more musicians (whether singers or instrumentalists) are involved, how the various parts are coordinated. The written quality of the music has enabled a high level of complexity within them: [[fugue]]s, for instance, achieve a remarkable marriage of boldly distinctive melodic lines weaving in [[counterpoint]] yet creating a coherent [[Diatonic function|harmonic logic]] that would be difficult to achieve in the heat of live improvisation.&lt;ref name="Knud Jeppesen 2007"&gt;[[Knud Jeppesen]]: "Bach's music grows out of an ideally harmonic background, against which the voices develop with a bold independence that is often breath-taking." Quoted from Adele Katz (1946; reprinted 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify |date=April 2017|reason=Jeppesen says this as a comparison between Palestrina's contrapuntal writing and Bach's harmonic conception, but this has nothing to do with improvisation, nor with notation.}} The use of written notation also preserves a record of the works and enables Classical musicians to perform music from many centuries ago. Musical notation enables 2000s-era performers to sing a choral work from the 1300s Renaissance era or a 1700s Baroque concerto with many of the features of the music (the melodies, lyrics, forms, and rhythms) being reproduced.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

That said, the score does allow the interpreter to make choices on how to perform a historical work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} For example, if the tempo is written with an Italian instruction (e.g., Allegro), it is not known exactly how fast the piece should be played. As well, in the Baroque era, many works that were designed for [[basso continuo]] accompaniment do not specify which instruments should play the accompaniment or exactly how the chordal instrument (harpsichord, lute, etc.) should play the chords, which are not notated in the part{{clarify|date=April 2017|reason=Does this uncertainty determine whether the music is "classical" or not?}} (only a [[figured bass]] symbol in the bass part is used to guide the chord-playing performer). The performer and the conductor have a range of options for musical expression and interpretation of a scored piece, including the phrasing of melodies, the time taken during [[fermata]]s (held notes) or pauses, and the use (or choice not to use) of effects such as vibrato or glissando (these effects are possible on various stringed, brass and woodwind instruments and with the human voice).

Although Classical music in the 2000s has lost most of its tradition for [[musical improvisation]], from the Baroque era to the Romantic era, there are examples of performers who could improvise in the style of their era. In the Baroque era, organ performers would improvise [[prelude (music)|preludes]], keyboard performers playing [[harpsichord]] would improvise [[chord (music)|chords]] from the [[figured bass]] symbols beneath the bass notes of the basso continuo part and both vocal and instrumental performers would improvise [[musical ornament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel Solis, Bruno Nettl. ''Musical Improvisation: Art, Education, and Society.'' University of Illinois Press, 2009. p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Johann Sebastian Bach was particularly noted for his complex improvisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.middlebury.edu/~harris/MusicPapers/baroque.html |title=On Baroque Improvisation |publisher=Community.middlebury.edu |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, the composer-performer Mozart was noted for his ability to improvise melodies in different styles.&lt;ref&gt;David Grayson. Mozart: Piano Concertos Nos. 20 and 21. Cambridge University Press, 1998. p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; During the Classical era, some virtuoso soloists would improvise the [[cadenza]] sections of a concerto. During the Romantic era, Beethoven would improvise at the piano.&lt;ref&gt;Tilman Skowroneck. ''Beethoven the Pianist''. Cambridge University Press, 2010. p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[#Improvisation|Improvisation]].

===Instrumentation and vocal practices===
{{See also|Woodwind section|Brass section|String section|Percussion section|Keyboard section}}
The instruments currently used in most classical music were largely invented before the mid-19th century (often much earlier) and systematised in the 18th and 19th centuries. They consist of the instruments found in an [[orchestra]] or in a [[concert band]], together with several other solo instruments (such as the [[piano]], [[harpsichord]], and [[organ (music)|organ]]). The symphony orchestra is the most widely known medium for classical music&lt;ref name="Kirgiss" /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--There is no mention of orchestras at all on this page.--&gt; and includes members of the [[string instrument|string]], [[woodwind]], [[brass instrument|brass]], and [[percussion]] families of instruments. The concert band consists of members of the woodwind, brass, and percussion families. It generally has a larger variety and number of woodwind and brass instruments than the orchestra but does not have a string section. However, many concert bands use a [[double bass]]. The vocal practices changed over the classical period, from the single line monophonic [[Gregorian chant]] done by monks in the Medieval period to the complex, [[polyphonic]] choral works of the Renaissance and subsequent periods, which used multiple independent vocal melodies at the same time.

====Medieval music====
Many of the instruments used to perform medieval music still exist, but in different forms. Medieval instruments included the [[flute]], the [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and plucked [[string instrument]]s like the [[lute]]. As well, early versions of the [[Organ (music)|organ]] and [[fiddle]] (or [[vielle]]) existed. Medieval instruments in Europe had most commonly been used singly, often self accompanied with a [[drone (music)|drone]] note, or occasionally in parts. From at least as early as the 13th century through the 15th century there was a division of instruments into ''haut'' (loud, shrill, outdoor instruments) and ''bas'' (quieter, more intimate instruments).{{sfn|Bowles|1954|loc=119 et passim}} During the [[Early Middle Ages|earlier medieval period]], the vocal music from the [[liturgy|liturgical]] genre, predominantly [[Gregorian chant]], was [[Monophony|monophonic]], using a single, unaccompanied vocal melody line.&lt;ref name="Hoppin57"&gt;Hoppin (1978) p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] vocal genres, which used multiple independent vocal melodies, began to develop during the [[High Middle Ages|high medieval era]], becoming prevalent by the later 13th and early 14th century.

====Renaissance music====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
Many instruments originated during the Renaissance; others were variations of, or improvements upon, instruments that had existed previously. Some have survived to the present day; others have disappeared, only to be re-created in order to perform music on period instruments. As in the modern day, instruments may be classified as brass, strings, percussion, and woodwind. Brass instruments in the Renaissance were traditionally played by professionals who were members of [[Guild]]s and they included the [[slide trumpet]], the wooden [[cornet]], the valveless [[trumpet]] and the [[sackbut]]. Stringed instruments included the [[viol]], the [[rebec]], the harp-like [[lyre]], the [[hurdy-gurdy]], the [[lute]], the [[guitar]], the [[cittern]], the [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], and the [[orpharion]]. Keyboard instruments with strings included the [[harpsichord]] and the [[virginal]]s.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Isn't the virginals a type of harpichord? If not, then the dedicated article linked here needs to be corrected.--&gt; Percussion instruments include the [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]], the [[Jew's harp]], the [[tambourine]], the bells, the rumble-pot, and various kinds of drums. Woodwind instruments included the double reed [[shawm]], the [[reed pipe]], the [[bagpipe]], the [[transverse flute]], the [[Recorder (instrument)|recorder]], the [[dulcian]], and the [[crumhorn]]. Vocal music in the Renaissance is noted for the flourishing of an increasingly elaborate [[polyphony|polyphonic]] style. The principal liturgical forms which endured throughout the entire Renaissance period were masses and motets, with some other developments towards the end, especially as composers of sacred music began to adopt secular forms (such as the [[madrigal (music)|madrigal]]) for their own designs. Towards the end of the period, the early dramatic precursors of opera such as monody, the [[madrigal comedy]], and the [[intermedio]] are seen. Around 1597, Italian composer [[Jacopo Peri]] wrote ''[[Dafne]]'', the first work to be called an [[opera]] today. He also composed [[Euridice (Peri)|Euridice]], the first opera to have survived to the present day.

====Baroque music====
{{refimprove|section|date=November 2017}}
Baroque instruments included some instruments from the earlier periods (e.g., the hurdy-gurdy and recorder) and a number of new instruments (e.g, the oboe, bassoon, cello, contrabass and fortepiano). Some instruments from previous eras fell into disuse, such as the shawm and the wooden cornet. The key Baroque instruments for strings included the [[Baroque violin|violin]], [[viol]], [[viola]], [[viola d'amore]], [[cello]], [[contrabass]], [[lute]], [[theorbo]] (which often played the [[basso continuo]] parts), [[mandolin]], [[cittern]], [[Baroque guitar]], [[harp]] and hurdy-gurdy. Woodwinds included the [[Baroque flute]], [[Baroque oboe]], [[rackett]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] and the [[bassoon]]. Brass instruments included the [[cornett]], [[natural horn]], [[Baroque trumpet]], [[Serpent (instrument)|serpent]] and the [[trombone]]. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]]&lt;!--the [[tangent piano]] --&gt;, the [[harpsichord]], the [[Organ (music)|pipe organ]], and, later in the period, the [[fortepiano]] (an early version of the piano). Percussion instruments included the [[timpani]], [[snare drum]], [[tambourine]] and the [[castanets]].

One major difference between Baroque music and the classical era that followed it is that the types of instruments used in Baroque ensembles were much less standardized. Whereas a classical era [[string quartet]] consists almost exclusively of two violins, a viola and a cello, a Baroque or Classical-era group accompanying a soloist or opera{{non sequitur |date=June 2018 |reason=comparing a Classical-era string quartet with an orchestra from the same period makes nonsense of the comparison of Baroque and Classical usage of instruments}} could include one of several different types of keyboard instruments (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, or clavichord),{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--Who claims that clavichords could be used to accompany soloists or operas?--&gt; additional stringed chordal instruments (e.g., a lute) and an unspecified number of bass instruments performing the basso continuo, including bowed strings, woodwinds and brass instruments (e.g., a cello, contrabass, viol, bassoon, serpent, etc.).

Vocal developments in the Baroque era included the development of [[opera]] types such as [[opera seria]] and [[opéra comique]], and related forms such as [[oratorio]]s and [[cantata]]s.&lt;ref name="BritannicaCantata"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cantata|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/cantata-music|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BritannicaOratorio"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oratorio|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/oratorio|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Classical music====
{{or-section|date=April 2017}}
The term "classical music" has two meanings: the broader meaning includes all Western art music from the Medieval era to the 2000s, and the specific meaning refers to the [[art music]] from the 1750s to the early 1820s—the period of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Joseph Haydn]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. This section is about the more specific meaning. Classical era musicians continued to use many of instruments from the Baroque era, such as the cello, contrabass, recorder, trombone, timpani, fortepiano (the precursor to the modern [[piano]]) and organ. While some Baroque instruments fell into disuse (e.g., the theorbo and rackett), many Baroque instruments were changed into the versions that are still in use today, such as the Baroque violin (which became the [[violin]]), the Baroque oboe (which became the [[oboe]]) and the Baroque trumpet, which transitioned to the regular valved trumpet. During the Classical era, the stringed instruments used in orchestra and [[chamber music]] such as [[string quartet]]s were standardized as the four instruments which form the [[string section]] of the [[orchestra]]: the violin, viola, cello and double bass. Baroque-era stringed instruments such as fretted, bowed [[viol]]s were phased out. Woodwinds included the [[basset clarinet]], [[basset horn]], [[clarinette d'amour]], the Classical [[clarinet]], the [[chalumeau]], the flute, oboe and bassoon. Keyboard instruments included the [[clavichord]] and the [[fortepiano]]. While the [[harpsichord]] was still used in basso continuo accompaniment in the 1750s and 1760s, it fell out of use in the end of the century. Brass instruments included the [[buccin]], the [[ophicleide]] (a replacement for the bass [[serpent (instrument)|serpent]], which was the precursor of the [[tuba]]) and the [[natural horn]].

====Romantic music====
In the Romantic era, the modern [[piano]], with a more powerful, sustained tone and a wider range took over from the more delicate-sounding fortepiano. In the orchestra, the existing Classical instruments and sections were retained ([[string section]], woodwinds, brass and percussion), but these sections were typically expanded to make a fuller, bigger sound. For example, while a Baroque orchestra may have had two double bass players, a Romantic orchestra could have as many as ten. "As music grew more expressive, the standard orchestral palette just wasn't rich enough for many Romantic composers." &lt;ref name="classicfm.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/discover/periods/romantic/romantic-music-beginners-guide/#FaXJhIVlfVSph9bq.97 |title=Romantic music: a beginner's guide – Music Periods |publisher=Classic FM |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; New woodwind instruments were added, such as the [[contrabassoon]], [[bass clarinet]] and [[piccolo]] and new percussion instruments were added, including [[xylophone]]s, [[snare drum]]s, [[celesta]]s (a bell-like keyboard instrument), [[bell]]s, and [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangles]],&lt;ref name="classicfm.com"/&gt; large [[orchestral harp]]s, and even [[wind machine]]s for [[sound effect]]s. [[Saxophone]]s appear in some scores from the late 19th century onwards. While appearing only as featured solo instruments in some works, for example [[Maurice Ravel]]'s orchestration of [[Modest Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]]'s ''[[Symphonic Dances (Rachmaninoff)|Symphonic Dances]]'', the saxophone is included in other works, such as Ravel's ''[[Boléro]]'', [[Sergei Prokofiev]]'s [[Romeo and Juliet (Prokofiev)#Orchestral suites extracted from Romeo and Juliet|Romeo and Juliet Suites 1 and 2]] and many other works as a member of the orchestral ensemble. The [[euphonium]] is featured in a few late [[Romantic music|Romantic]] and [[20th-century classical music|20th-century]] works, usually playing parts marked "tenor tuba", including [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]'', and [[Richard Strauss]]'s ''[[Ein Heldenleben]]''.

The [[Wagner tuba]], a modified member of the horn family, appears in [[Richard Wagner]]'s cycle ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' and several other works by Strauss, [[Béla Bartók]], and others; it has a prominent role in [[Anton Bruckner]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Bruckner)|Symphony No. 7 in E Major]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wagner-tuba.com/ |title=The Wagner Tuba |publisher=The Wagner Tuba |date= |accessdate=2014-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornets appear in [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[Swan Lake]]'', [[Claude Debussy]]'s ''[[La mer (Debussy)|La mer]]'', and several orchestral works by [[Hector Berlioz]].{{clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Why single out these composers in particular?

====Modernist music====

[[Modernism (music)|Modernism in music]] is a philosophical and aesthetic stance underlying the period of change and development in musical language that occurred from 1890 to 1930, a period of diverse reactions in challenging and reinterpreting older categories of music, innovations that lead to new ways of organizing and approaching harmonic, melodic, sonic, and rhythmic aspects of music, and changes in aesthetic worldviews in close relation to the larger identifiable period of [[modernism]] in the arts of the time. The operative word most associated with it is "innovation".{{sfn|Metzer|2009|loc=3}} Its leading feature is a "linguistic plurality", which is to say that no single [[music genre]] ever assumed a dominant position.{{sfn|Morgan|1984|loc=443}}

==== Contemporary classical music ====
[[Contemporary classical music]] is the period that came into prominence in the mid-1970s.  It includes different variations of [[Modernism (music)|modernist]], [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Neoromanticism (music)|neoromantic]], and [[Eclecticism in music|pluralist music]].&lt;ref&gt;Botstein "[http://www.grovemusic.com Modernism]" §9: The Late 20th Century (subscription access).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term may also be employed in a broader sense to refer to all post-1945 musical forms.&lt;ref&gt;"Contemporary" in Du Noyer 2003, 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Postmodern music ====
&lt;!--Everything in this sections is at odds with the linked article on Postmodern music.--&gt;
[[Postmodern music]] is a period of music that began around 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{harvnb|Karolyi|1994|loc=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|1994|loc=331–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares characteristics with [[postmodern art|postmodernist art]] – that is, art that comes after and reacts against [[modernism]].

==== Post-postmodern instrumentation ====
Many instruments that in the 2010s are associated with popular music filled important roles in early music, such as [[bagpipes]], [[theorbo]]s, [[vihuela]]s, [[hurdy-gurdy|hurdy-gurdies]] (hand-cranked string instruments), [[accordion]]s, [[alphorn]]s, [[Water organ#Hydraulis|hydraulises]], [[Calliope (music)|calliopes]], [[sistrum]]s, and some woodwind instruments such as [[tin whistle]]s, [[panpipes]], [[shawms]] and [[crumhorn]]s. On the other hand, instruments such as the [[acoustic guitar]], once associated mainly with popular music, gained prominence in classical music in the 19th and 20th centuries in the form of the [[classical guitar]] and [[banjo]]. While [[equal temperament]] gradually became accepted as the dominant [[musical temperament]] during the 19th century, different historical temperaments are often used for music from earlier periods. For instance, music of the [[English Renaissance]] is often performed in [[meantone temperament]]. As well, while professional [[orchestra]]s and pop bands all around the world have tuned to an A fixed at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz since the late 19th century, there was historically a great variety in the tuning pitch, as attested to in historical pipe organs that still exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Story of "A:" More about Baroque pitch|url=http://pbosf.blogspot.ca/2010/01/story-of-more-about-baroque-pitch.html|website=Philadelphia Baroque Orchestra|accessdate=3 November 2017|date=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{reliable source|date=November 2017}}

===Performance===
[[File:Concertband.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Youth [[concert band]] in performance]]

Performers who have studied classical music extensively are said to be "classically trained". This training may come from private lessons from instrument or voice teachers or from completion of a formal program offered by a Conservatory, college or university, such as a [[Bachelor of Music]] or [[Master of Music]] degree (which includes individual lessons from professors). In classical music, "...extensive formal music education and training, often to postgraduate [Master's degree] level" is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inputyouth.co.uk/jobguides/job-classicalmusician.html |title=Job Guide – Classical Musician |publisher=Inputyouth.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Performance of classical music repertoire requires a proficiency in [[sight-reading]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] playing, [[Harmony|harmonic]] principles, strong [[ear training]] (to correct and adjust pitches by ear), knowledge of [[performance practice]] (e.g., Baroque ornamentation), and a familiarity with the style/musical idiom expected for a given composer or musical work (e.g., a Brahms symphony or a Mozart concerto).{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Some "popular" genre musicians have had significant classical training, such as [[Billy Joel]], [[Elton John]], the [[Van Halen]] brothers, [[Randy Rhoads]], [[Ritchie Blackmore]], and [[Dream Theater]] members.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Moreover, formal training is not unique to the classical genre. Many rock and pop musicians have completed degrees in [[Pop music|commercial music]] programs such as those offered by the [[Berklee College of Music]] and many [[jazz]] musicians have completed degrees in music from universities with jazz programs, such as the [[Manhattan School of Music]] and [[McGill University]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

====Gender of performers====
{{Main article|Women in music}}
Historically, major professional [[orchestra]]s have been mostly or entirely composed of musicians who are men. Some of the earliest cases of [[women in music|women being hired in professional orchestras]] was in the position of [[harp]]ist. The [[Vienna Philharmonic]], for example, did not accept women to permanent membership until 1997, far later than the other orchestras ranked among the world's top five by ''[[Gramophone (magazine)|Gramophone]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name="The world's greatest orchestras"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gramophone.co.uk/editorial/the-world%E2%80%99s-greatest-orchestras |title=The world's greatest orchestras |work=gramophone.co.uk |date= 2012-10-24|accessdate=2013-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last major orchestra to appoint a woman to a permanent position was the [[Berlin Philharmonic]].&lt;ref&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/16/berlin-in-lights-the-woman-question/ "Berlin in Lights: The Woman Question"], Arts Beat, ''The New York Times'', 16 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; As late as February 1996, the Vienna Philharmonic's principal flute, Dieter Flury, told ''[[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]'' that accepting women would be "gambling with the emotional unity ({{Lang|de|emotionelle Geschlossenheit}}) that this organism currently has".&lt;ref name=WDR5&gt;Westdeutscher Rundfunk Radio 5, "Musikalische Misogynie", 13 February 1996, [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdrgerm.htm transcribed by Regina Himmelbauer]; [http://www.osborne-conant.org/wdr.htm translation by William Osborne]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1996, the orchestra's press secretary wrote that "compensating for the expected leaves of absence" of [[maternity leave]] would be a problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osborne-conant.org/posts/schuster.htm |title=The Vienna Philharmonic's Letter of Response to the Gen-Mus List |work=Osborne-conant.org |date=1996-02-25 |accessdate=2013-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the Vienna Philharmonic was "facing protests during a [US] tour" by the [[National Organization for Women]] and the [[International Alliance for Women in Music]]. Finally, "after being held up to increasing ridicule even in socially conservative Austria, members of the orchestra gathered [on 28 February 1997] in an extraordinary meeting on the eve of their departure and agreed to admit a woman, Anna Lelkes, as harpist."&lt;ref name=JP&gt;Jane Perlez, [https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/28/world/vienna-philharmonic-lets-women-join-in-harmony.html "Vienna Philharmonic Lets Women Join in Harmony"], ''The New York Times'', February 28, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2013, the orchestra has six female members; one of them, violinist Albena Danailova became one of the orchestra's [[concertmaster]]s in 2008, the first woman to hold that position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20080508-vienna-opera-albena-danailova-first-female-concertmaster-austria&amp;navi= Vienna opera appoints first ever female concertmaster]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, [[France 24]]&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, women still made up just 6% of the orchestra's membership. VPO president Clemens Hellsberg said the VPO now uses completely screened [[blind audition]]s.&lt;ref name=Legends&gt;[[James R. Oestreich]], [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/28/arts/even-legends-adjust-to-time-and-trend-even-the-vienna.html "Even Legends Adjust To Time and Trend, Even the Vienna Philharmonic"], ''The New York Times'', 28 February 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, an article in ''Mother Jones'' stated that while "[m]any prestigious orchestras have significant female membership—women outnumber men in the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s violin section—and several renowned ensembles, including the [[National Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Detroit Symphony]], and the Minnesota Symphony, are led by women violinists", the [[double bass]], brass, and percussion sections of major orchestras "...are still predominantly male."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Hannah Levintova |url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/09/women-conductors-gap-charts-marin-alsop-proms |title=Here's Why You Seldom See Women Leading a Symphony |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 BBC article stated that the "...introduction of [[Blind audition|'blind' auditions]], where a prospective instrumentalist performs behind a screen so that the judging panel can exercise no gender or racial prejudice, has seen the gender balance of traditionally male-dominated symphony orchestras gradually shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Burton |first=Clemency |url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20130821-why-so-few-women-conductors |title=Culture – Why aren't there more women conductors? |publisher=BBC |date=2014-10-21 |accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Complexity===
Works of classical repertoire often exhibit complexity in their use of [[orchestration]], [[counterpoint]], [[harmony]], [[musical development]], [[rhythm]], [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], [[Texture (music)|texture]], and [[musical form|form]]. Whereas most popular styles are usually written in [[Ternary form|song form]], classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated instrumental musical forms,&lt;ref name="Julian Johnson 2002 p. 63"/&gt; like the [[concerto]], [[symphony]] and [[sonata]]. Classical music is also noted for its use of sophisticated vocal/instrumental forms, such as [[opera]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--Who claims opera is a "sophisticated" form?--&gt; In opera, vocal soloists and choirs perform staged dramatic works with an orchestra providing accompaniment. Longer instrumental works are often divided into self-contained pieces, called [[movement (music)|movements]], often with contrasting characters or moods. For instance, symphonies written during the Classical period are usually divided into four movements: (1) an opening Allegro in [[sonata form]], (2) a slow movement, (3) a minuet or scherzo (in a [[triple metre]], such as 3/4), and (4) a final Allegro. These movements can then be further broken down into a hierarchy of smaller units: first [[Section (music)|sections]], then [[Period (music)|periods]], and finally [[Phrase (music)|phrases]].

{{History of Western art music}}
{{Main article|History of music}}
The major time divisions of classical music up to 1900 are the [[Early music]] period, which includes [[Medieval music|Medieval]] (500–1400) and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] (1400–1600) eras, and the [[Common practice period]], which includes the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] (1600–1750), [[Classical period (music)|Classical]] (1750–1820) and [[Romantic music|Romantic]] (1810–1910) eras.} The current period encompasses the [[20th-century classical music|20th century]] (1901–2000) and includes most of the Early [[modernism (music)|modern]] musical era (1890–1930), the entire [[high modernism|High modern]] (mid 20th-century), and the first part of the [[Contemporary classical music|Contemporary]] (1945 or 1975–current) or [[postmodern music|Postmodern]] musical era (1930–current). The [[21st-century classical music|21st century]] has so far been a continuation of the same period and the same Contemporary/Postmodern musical era which both began mostly in the 20th-century.

The dates are [[Dates of classical music eras|generalizations]], since the periods and eras overlap and the categories are somewhat arbitrary, to the point that some authorities reverse terminologies and refer to a common practice "era" comprising baroque, classical, and romantic "periods".&lt;ref name="Mode and tempo"&gt;{{cite web |author= Vladimir J. Konecni|title= Mode and tempo in Western classical music of the common-practice era |year=2009 |url= https://kb.osu.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/1811/36604/1/EMR000064b_Konecni.pdf|accessdate= 17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the use of [[counterpoint]] and [[fugue]], which is considered characteristic of the Baroque era (or period), was continued by [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], who is classified as typical of the Classical era. [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], who is often described as a founder of the Romantic era, and [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], who is classified as Romantic, also used counterpoint and fugue, but the romantic and sometimes yearning qualities of their music define their era.

The prefix ''neo-'' is used to describe a 19th-, 20th-, or 21st-century composition written in the style of an earlier era, such as Classical or Romantic. [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky's]] ''[[Pulcinella (ballet)|Pulcinella]]'', for example, is a [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] composition because it is stylistically similar to works of the Baroque era.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--So a "Neo-medieval" work might be so-called because it resembles Renaissance music??--&gt;

===Roots===
{{Main article|Ancient music}}

Burgh (2006), suggests that the roots of Western classical music ultimately lie in ancient Egyptian art music via [[cheironomy]] and the ancient Egyptian orchestra, which dates to 2695 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Listening to Artifacts: Music Culture in Ancient Israel/Palestine|first=Theodore W.|last=Burgh|publisher=T. &amp; T. Clark Ltd.|year=2006|isbn=978-0567025524}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development of individual tones and scales was made by ancient Greeks such as [[Aristoxenus]] and [[Pythagoras]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p28"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagoras created a tuning system and helped to codify [[musical notation]]. Ancient Greek instruments such as the [[aulos]] (a [[reed instrument]]) and the [[lyre]] (a stringed instrument similar to a small harp) eventually led to the modern-day instruments of a classical orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Grout88|Grout (1988)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The antecedent to the early period was the era of [[ancient music]] before the fall of the [[Roman Empire]] (476 AD).

{{See also|List of Medieval composers|List of Renaissance composers}}

[[File:Vielle.jpg|thumb|Musician playing the [[vielle]] (fourteenth-century [[Medieval]] [[manuscript]])]]

The Medieval period includes music from after the fall of Rome to about 1400. [[Monophony|Monophonic]] chant, also called plainsong or [[Gregorian chant]], was the dominant form until about 1100.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"/&gt; Catholic monks developed the first forms of modern European musical notation in order to standardize liturgy throughout the worldwide Church.{{sfn|Hall, Neitz, and Battani|2003|p=99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=3fExcE3ouRYC&amp;lpg=PA173&amp;vq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;dq=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;pg=PA173#v=snippet&amp;q=catholic%20monks%20classical%20music&amp;f=false |title = Making Music and Having a Blast!: A Guide for All Music Students|first1= Bonnie |last1= Blanchard |first2= Cynthia |last2=Blanchard Acree |publisher = Indiana University Press|date = 2009|isbn = 9780-253003355 |page = 173}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fnu0BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA256&amp;dq=catholic+monks+classical+music#v=onepage&amp;q=catholic+monks+classical+music&amp;f=false|title=The Rough Guide to Classical Music|first=Rough|last=Guides|date=May 3, 2010|publisher=Rough Guides UK|accessdate=June 21, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=978-1848366770}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Polyphony|Polyphonic]] (multi-voiced) music developed from monophonic chant throughout the late [[Middle Ages]] and into the [[Renaissance]], including the more complex voicings of [[motet]]s. The Renaissance era was from 1400 to 1600. It was characterized by greater use of [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], multiple interweaving melodic lines, and the use of the first [[Bass (sound)|bass instruments]]. Social dancing became more widespread, so musical forms appropriate to accompanying dance began to standardize. It is in this time that the notation of music on a [[staff (music)|staff]] and other elements of [[musical notation]] began to take shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p61"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This invention made possible the separation of the [[Musical composition|composition]] of a piece of music from its ''transmission''; without written music, transmission was oral, and subject to change every time it was transmitted. With a [[Sheet music|musical score]], a work of music could be performed without the composer's presence.&lt;ref name="Grout73p75"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt; The invention of the movable-type [[printing press]] in the 15th century had far-reaching consequences on the preservation and transmission of music.&lt;ref name="Grout73p175"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 175–76&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:white mensural notation.gif|thumb|left|[[Johannes Ockeghem]], Kyrie "Au travail suis" excerpt]]

Typical stringed instruments of the early period include the harp, [[lute]], [[vielle]], and [[psaltery]], while wind instruments included the [[flute]] family (including [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]]), [[shawm]] (an early member of the [[oboe]] family), trumpet, and the [[bagpipes]]. Simple [[pipe organ]]s existed, but were largely confined to churches, although there were portable varieties.&lt;ref name="Grout73p72"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 72–74&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the period, early versions of [[keyboard (music)|keyboard]] instruments like the [[clavichord]] and [[harpsichord]] began to appear. Stringed instruments such as the [[viol]] had emerged by the 16th century, as had a wider variety of brass and reed instruments. Printing enabled the standardization of descriptions and specifications of instruments, as well as instruction in their use.&lt;ref name="Grout73p222"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 222–225&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Medieval composers include [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Guillaume de Machaut]], [[Léonin]], [[Pérotin]], [[Philippe de Vitry]], [[Francesco Landini]], and [[Johannes Ciconia]].

Notable Renaissance composers include [[Josquin des Prez]], [[Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina]], [[John Dunstaple]], [[Johannes Ockeghem]], [[Orlande de Lassus]], [[Guillaume Du Fay]], [[Gilles Binchois]], [[Thomas Tallis]], [[William Byrd]], [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], [[Carlo Gesualdo]], [[John Dowland]], [[Jacob Obrecht]], [[Adrian Willaert]], [[Jacques Arcadelt]], and [[Cipriano de Rore]].

===Common-practice period===
The [[common practice period]] is usually defined as the era between the formation and the dissolution of the hegemony{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} of common-practice [[tonality]].&lt;!-- sentence copied in part from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Common_practice_period&amp;oldid=799911529--&gt;  The term usually spans roughly two-and-a-half centuries, encompassing the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods.

====Baroque music====
{{Main article|Baroque music}}
{{See also|List of Baroque composers}}

[[File:Baschenis - Musical Instruments.jpg|thumb|Baroque instruments including [[hurdy-gurdy]], [[harpsichord]], [[bass viol]], [[lute]], [[baroque violin|violin]], and [[baroque guitar]]]]

Baroque music is characterized by the use of complex tonal [[counterpoint]] and the use of a [[basso continuo]], a continuous bass line. Music became more complex in comparison with the simple songs of all previous periods.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss&gt;{{cite book|last=Kirgiss|first=Crystal|title=Classical Music|year=2004|page=6|publisher=Black Rabbit Books|isbn=978-1583406748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The beginnings of the [[sonata form]] took shape in the [[canzona]], as did a more formalized notion of [[theme and variations]]. The tonalities of [[major and minor]] as means for managing dissonance and [[chromaticism]] in music took full shape.&lt;ref name="Grout73p300"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 300–32&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Baroque era, keyboard music played on the [[harpsichord]] and [[pipe organ]] became increasingly popular, and the violin family of stringed instruments took the form generally seen today. Opera as a staged musical drama began to differentiate itself from earlier musical and dramatic forms, and vocal forms like the [[cantata]] and [[oratorio]] became more common.&lt;ref name="Grout73p341"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 341–55&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalists for the first time began adding extra notes to the music.&lt;ref name=Kirgiss/&gt; Instrumental ensembles began to distinguish and standardize by size{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=as far as I know, instrumental ensembles were far from being standardized in size by Bach's time}}, giving rise to the early orchestra for larger ensembles, with [[chamber music]] being written for smaller groups of instruments where parts are played by individual (instead of massed) instruments. The [[concerto]] as a vehicle for solo performance{{clarify|date=November 2017|reason=and what of the concerto grosso?}} accompanied by an orchestra became widespread.

The theories surrounding [[equal temperament]] began to be put in wider practice, especially as it enabled a wider range of chromatic possibilities in hard-to-tune keyboard instruments. Although Bach did not use equal temperament, as a modern piano is generally tuned, changes in the temperaments from the [[meantone|meantone system]], common at the time, to various temperaments that made modulation between all keys musically acceptable, made possible Bach's ''[[Well-Tempered Clavier]]''.&lt;ref name="Grout73p378"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;

Important composers of this era include [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Henry Purcell]], [[Claudio Monteverdi]], [[Domenico Scarlatti]], [[Georg Philipp Telemann]], [[Arcangelo Corelli]], [[Alessandro Scarlatti]], [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]], [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]], and [[Heinrich Schütz]].

====Classical-era (or -period) music====
{{Main article|Classical period (music)}}
{{See also|List of Classical-era composers}}

[[File:Haydnportrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph Haydn]] (1732–1809) c.&amp;nbsp;1770]]

The Classical era, from about 1750 to 1820, established many of the norms of composition, presentation, and style, and was also when the piano became the predominant keyboard instrument. The ''basic'' forces required for an [[orchestra]] became somewhat standardized (although they would grow as the potential of a wider array of instruments was developed in the following centuries). Chamber music grew to include ensembles with as many as 8 to 10 performers for [[serenade#Classical and Romantic eras|serenades]]. [[Opera]] continued to develop, with regional styles in Italy, France, and German-speaking lands. The ''[[opera buffa]]'', a form of comic opera, rose in popularity. The [[symphony]] came into its own as a musical form, and the concerto was developed as a vehicle for displays of virtuoso playing skill. Orchestras no longer required a [[harpsichord]] (which had been part of the traditional ''continuo'' in the Baroque style), and were often led by the lead violinist (now called the [[concertmaster]]).&lt;ref name="Grout73p463"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 463&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind instruments became more refined in the Classical era. While [[double reed|double-reed]] instruments like the [[oboe]] and [[bassoon]] became somewhat standardized in the Baroque, the [[clarinet]] family of [[single reed]]s was not widely used until [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] expanded its role in orchestral, chamber, and concerto settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward Kingdon|first1=Martha|title=Mozart and the clarinet|issue=2|pages=126–153|url=https://academic.oup.com/ml/article-abstract/XXVIII/2/126/1375956?redirectedFrom=PDF|journal=Music and Letters|volume=XXVIII|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en|doi=10.1093/ml/XXVIII.2.126|date=1 April 1947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major composers of this period include [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]], [[Johann Christian Bach]], [[Luigi Boccherini]], [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach]], [[Muzio Clementi]], [[Antonio Salieri]], and [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]].

====Romantic-era music====
{{Main article|Romantic music}}
{{See also|List of Romantic-era composers}}

The music of the Romantic era, from roughly the first decade of the 19th century to the early 20th century, was characterized by increased attention to an extended melodic line, as well as expressive and emotional elements, paralleling [[romanticism]] in other art forms. Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like [[nocturne]]s, [[Fantasia (music)|fantasias]], and [[Prelude (music)|preludes]] being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized.&lt;ref name="Swafford200"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"&gt;[[#Swafford|Swafford]], p. 201&lt;/ref&gt; The [[art song]] (or ''Lied'') came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of [[grand opera]], ultimately transcended by [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring cycle]].&lt;ref name="Grout73p595"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 595–612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, musical institutions emerged from the control of wealthy patrons, as composers and musicians could construct lives independent of the nobility. Increasing interest in music by the growing middle classes throughout western Europe spurred the creation of organizations for the teaching, performance, and preservation of music. The piano, which achieved its modern construction in this era (in part due to industrial advances in [[metallurgy]]) became widely popular with the middle class, whose demands for the instrument spurred a large number of piano builders. Many symphony orchestras date their founding to this era.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; Some musicians and composers were the stars of the day; some, like [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Niccolò Paganini]], fulfilled both roles.&lt;ref name="Grout73p543"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], p. 543&lt;/ref&gt;

The family of instruments used, especially in orchestras, grew. A wider array of percussion instruments began to appear. Brass instruments took on larger roles, as the introduction of [[rotary valve]]s made it possible for them to play a wider range of notes. The size of the orchestra (typically around 40 in the Classical era) grew to be over 100.&lt;ref name="Swafford201"/&gt; [[Gustav Mahler]]'s 1906 [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 8]], for example, has been performed with over 150 instrumentalists and choirs of over 400.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pitcher|first=John|date=January 2013|title=Nashville Symphony|url=|journal=American Record Guide|volume=76, no. 1|pages=8–10|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

European cultural ideas and institutions began to follow colonial expansion into other parts of the world. There was also a rise, especially toward the end of the era, of [[nationalism in music]] (echoing, in some cases, political sentiments of the time), as composers such as [[Edvard Grieg]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], and [[Antonín Dvořák]] echoed traditional music of their homelands in their compositions.&lt;ref name="Grout73p634"&gt;[[#Grout73|Grout]], pp. 634, 641–42&lt;/ref&gt;

Prominent composers of this era include [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Frédéric Chopin]], [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Richard Wagner]], [[Johannes Brahms]], and [[Johann Strauss II]].

Prominent composers of the early 20th century include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Claude Debussy]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arnold Schoenberg]], [[Anton Webern]], [[Alban Berg]], [[Aram Khachaturian]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Edvard Grieg]], and [[Béla Bartók]]. Although composers of this time can be considered Romantic, usually their works are not in the style of the period.{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}

Encompassing a wide variety of [[Post-romanticism|post-Romantic]] styles composed through the year 2000, 20th-century classical music includes late romantic, impressionist, neoclassical, neoromantic, neomedieval, and postmodern styles of composition. [[Modernism (music)|Modernism]] (1890–1930) marked an era when many composers rejected certain values of the common practice period, such as traditional tonality, melody, instrumentation, and structure. The high-modern era saw the emergence of neo-classical and [[serial music]]. A few authorities have claimed high-modernism as the beginning of [[postmodern music]] from about 1930.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Karolyi says nothing at all about high modernism, let along equate it with the postmodern era, the beginning of which he plants firmly in 1930.--&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Meyer does not equate high modernism with post-modernism.--&gt; Others have more or less equated postmodern music with the "contemporary music" composed from the late 20th century through to the early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 1995, 217&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beard and Gloag|2005|loc=142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women in classical music===
{{see also|Women in classical music}}
Almost all of the composers who are described in music textbooks on classical music and whose works are widely performed as part of the [[Western canon|standard concert repertoire]] are male composers, even though there has been a [[List of female composers|large number of women composers]] throughout the classical music period. Musicologist [[Marcia Citron]] has asked "[w]hy is [[Women in music|music composed by women]] so marginal to the standard 'classical' repertoire?"&lt;ref name=Citron&gt;Citron, Marcia J. "Gender and the Musical Canon." CUP Archive, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Citron "examines the practices and attitudes that have led to the exclusion of women composers from the received '[[Western canon|canon]]' of performed musical works." She argues that in the 1800s, women composers typically wrote [[art song]]s for performance in small recitals rather than [[symphony|symphonies]] intended for performance with an orchestra in a large hall, with the latter works being seen as the most important genre for composers; since women composers did not write many symphonies, they were deemed to be not notable as composers.&lt;ref name=Citron /&gt; In the "...''Concise Oxford History of Music'', [[Clara Schumann|Clara S[c]humann]] is one of the only{{sic}} female composers mentioned."&lt;ref name=rvanews&gt;{{cite web|author=Abbey Philips|url=http://rvanews.com/features/spacebomb-truth-lies-somewhere-in-between/49992|title=The history of women and gender roles in music|publisher=Rvanews.com|date=2011-09-01|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abbey Philips states that "[d]uring the 20th century the women who were composing/playing gained far less attention than their male counterparts."&lt;ref name=rvanews /&gt;

==Significance of written notation==

===Literalist view of the significance of the score===
While there are differences between particular performances of a classical work, a piece of classical music is generally held to transcend any interpretation of it. The use of musical notation is an effective method for transmitting classical music, since the written music contains the technical instructions for performing the work.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The written [[sheet music|score]], however, does not usually contain explicit instructions as to how to interpret the piece in terms of production or performance, apart from directions for [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]], [[tempo]] and expression (to a certain extent). This is left to the discretion of the performers, who are guided by their personal experience and musical education, their knowledge of the work's idiom, their personal artistic tastes, and the accumulated body of historic performance practices.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

===Criticism of the literalist view===
All critics express the opinion that it is only from the mid-19th century, and especially in the 20th century, that the score began to hold such a high significance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Previously, improvisation (in preludes, cadenzas and ornaments), rhythmic flexibility (e.g., [[tempo rubato]]), improvisatory deviation from the score and [[oral tradition]] of playing was integral to the style.{{Clarify|date=April 2017}}&lt;!--Which "style"? The "Neoromanticism" of Berlioz? The Romanticism of Schubert? Notre Dame organum?--&gt; Classical musicians tend to use scores and the parts extracted from them to play music. Yet, even with notation providing the key elements of the music, there is considerable latitude in the performance of the works. Some of this latitude results from the inherent limitations of musical notation, though attempts to supplement traditional notation with signs and annotations indicating more subtle nuances tend to overwhelm and paralyse the performer.

Some quotes that highlight a criticism of overvaluing of the score:
* "... one of the most stubborn modern misconceptions concerning baroque music is that a metronomic regularity was intended" (Baroque Interpretation in [[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|''Grove'' 5th edition]] by [[Robert Donington]])
* "Too many teachers, conditioned to 20th century ideas, teach Bach and other Baroque music exactly the wrong way. This leads to what musicologist [[Sol Babitz]] calls 'sewing machine Bach'."{{clarify|date=July 2016}}&lt;!--What has this quote to do with over-valuing scores?--&gt;&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression /&gt;
* "... tendency to look alike, sound alike and think alike. The conservatories are at fault and they have been at fault for many years now. Any sensitive musician going around the World has noted the same thing. The conservatories, from Moscow and Leningrad to Juilliard, Curtis and Indiana, are producing a standardized product.&lt;br /&gt;[...] clarity, undeviating rhythm, easy technique, 'musicianship'. I put the word musicianship in quotes, because as often as not, it is a false kind of musicianship—a musicianship that sees the tree and not the forest, that takes care of the detail but ignores the big picture; a musicianship that is tied to the printed note rather than to emotional meaning of a piece.&lt;br /&gt;The fact remains that there is a dreadful uniformity today and also an appalling lack of knowledge about the culture and performance traditions of the past." ("Music Schools Turning out Robots?"&lt;ref name=conservatories_kill_expression&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&amp;dat=19691019&amp;id=dpMeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ncsEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=874,4160516 "Music Schools Turning out Robots?"] by [[Harold C. Schonberg]]; ''Daytona Beach Morning Journal'' – October 19, 1969&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Harold C. Schonberg]])

===Improvisation===
{{Essay|section|date=July 2016}}
[[musical improvisation|Improvisation]] once played an important role in classical music. A remnant of this improvisatory tradition in classical music can be heard in the [[cadenza]], a passage found mostly in concertos and solo works, designed to allow skilled performers to exhibit their virtuoso skills on the instrument. Traditionally this was improvised by the performer; however, it is often written for (or occasionally by) the performer beforehand. Improvisation is also an important aspect in authentic performances of operas of Baroque era and of bel canto (especially operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]), and is best exemplified by the ''[[da capo aria]]'', a form by which famous singers typically perform variations of the thematic matter of the aria in the recapitulation section ('B section' / the 'da capo' part). An example is [[Beverly Sills]]' complex, albeit pre-written, variation of "Da tempeste il legno infranto" from Händel's ''[[Giulio Cesare]]''.{{Citation needed|date=July 2016}}

Its{{Clarify|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--This seems to be referring to improvisation, but that seems contradictory.--&gt; written transmission, along with the veneration bestowed on certain classical works, has led to the expectation that performers will play a work in a way that realizes in detail the original intentions of the composer. During the 19th century the details that composers put in their scores generally increased. Yet the opposite trend—admiration of performers for new "interpretations" of the composer's work—can be seen, and it is not unknown for a composer to praise a performer for achieving a better realization of the original intent than the composer was able to imagine. Thus, classical performers often achieve high reputations for their musicianship, even if they do not compose themselves. Generally however, it is the composers who are remembered more than the performers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

The primacy of the composer's written score has also led, today, to a relatively minor role played by improvisation in classical music, in sharp contrast to the practice of musicians who lived during the medieval, renaissance, baroque and early romantic eras. Improvisation in classical music performance was common during both the Baroque and early romantic eras, yet lessened strongly during the second half of the 20th century. During the classical era, Mozart and Beethoven often improvised the cadenzas to their [[piano concerto]]s (and thereby encouraged others to do so), but for violin concertos they provided written cadenzas for use by other soloists.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}&lt;!--The quotation from Maria Callas does not support this claim.--&gt; In opera, the practice of singing strictly by the score, i.e. ''come scritto'', was famously propagated by soprano [[Maria Callas]], who called this practice 'straitjacketing' and implied that it allows the intention of the composer to be understood better, especially during studying the music for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;"In other words, exactly as it's written, nothing more and nothing less, which is what I call straitjacketing." quoted in [[Arianna Huffington|Huffington, Arianna]] (2002). ''Maria Callas: The Woman behind the Legend'', p. 76. Cooper Square. {{ISBN|978-1461624295}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to other music traditions==

===Popular music===
Classical music has often incorporated elements or material from popular music of the composer's time. Examples include occasional music such as Brahms' use of student drinking songs in his ''[[Academic Festival Overture]]'', genres exemplified by [[Kurt Weill]]'s ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'', and the influence of jazz on early and mid-20th-century composers including [[Maurice Ravel]], exemplified by the movement entitled "Blues" in his sonata for violin and piano.&lt;ref&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ravel, Maurice, §3: 1918–37|author=Kelly, Barbara L.|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Postmodern music|postmodern]], [[Minimalist music|minimalist]] and [[Postminimalism|postminimalist]] classical composers acknowledge a debt to popular music.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{GroveOnline|title=Nyman, Michael|author=Siôn, Pwyll Ap|access-date=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}&lt;!--A single instance cannot verify a broader claim.--&gt;

Numerous examples show influence in the opposite direction, including popular songs based on classical music, the use to which ''[[Pachelbel's Canon#Pachelbel's canon in popular culture|Pachelbel's Canon]]'' has been put since the 1970s, and the musical [[Crossover (music)|crossover]] phenomenon, where classical musicians have achieved success in the popular music arena.&lt;ref&gt;Notable examples are the ''[[Hooked on Classics]]'' series of recordings made by the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]] in the early 1980s and the classical crossover violinists [[Vanessa Mae]] and [[Catya Maré]].&lt;/ref&gt; In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], a number of [[lead guitarist]]s (playing [[electric guitar]]), including [[Ritchie Blackmore]] and [[Randy Rhoads]], modeled their playing styles on Baroque or Classical-era instrumental music.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

===Folk music===
Composers of classical music have often made use of [[folk music]] (music created by musicians who are commonly not classically trained, often from a purely oral tradition). Some composers, like [[Antonín Dvořák|Dvořák]] and [[Bedřich Smetana|Smetana]],&lt;ref name="Yeomans2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yeomans|first=David|title=Piano Music of the Czech Romantics: A Performer's Guide|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0253218452|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; have used folk themes to impart a nationalist flavor to their work, while others like [[Béla Bartók|Bartók]] have used specific themes lifted whole from their folk-music origins.&lt;ref name="Stevens129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stevens|first=Haley|author2=Gillies, Malcolm|title=The Life and Music of Béla Bartók|year=1993|isbn=978-0198163497|page=129|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercialization==
Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become [[cliché]]d, particularly the opening of [[Richard Strauss]]' ''[[Also sprach Zarathustra (Strauss)|Also sprach Zarathustra]]'' (made famous in the film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'') and the opening section "[[O Fortuna]]" of [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''; other examples include the "[[Dies irae]]" from the [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]], [[Edvard Grieg]]'s "[[In the Hall of the Mountain King]]" from ''[[Peer Gynt (Grieg)|Peer Gynt]]'', the opening bars of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]], [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s "[[Ride of the Valkyries]]" from ''[[Die Walküre]]'', [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]", and excerpts of [[Aaron Copland]]'s ''[[Rodeo (ballet)|Rodeo]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Several works from the [[Golden age of American animation|Golden Age of Animation]] matched the action to classical music. Notable examples are [[Walt Disney]]'s ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', [[Tom and Jerry]]'s ''[[Johann Mouse]]'', and [[Warner Bros.]]' ''[[Rabbit of Seville]]'' and ''[[What's Opera, Doc?]]''

Similarly, movies and television often revert to standard, clichéd excerpts of classical music to convey refinement or opulence: some of the most-often heard pieces in this category include [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]]´s [[Cello Suites (Bach)|Cello Suite No. 1]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[Eine kleine Nachtmusik]]'', [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]]'s ''[[The Four Seasons (Vivaldi)|Four Seasons]]'', [[Modest Mussorgsky|Mussorgsky]]'s ''[[Night on Bald Mountain]]'' (as orchestrated by Rimsky-Korsakov), and [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]]'s "[[William Tell Overture|''William Tell'' Overture]]". The same passages are often used by telephone call centres to induce a sense of calm in customers waiting in a queue.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century may have harmed the music industry through inadequate representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vancour|first=Shawn|title=Popularizing the Classics: Radio's Role in the Music Appreciation Movement 1922–34.|journal=Media, Culture and Society|date=March 2009|volume=31|issue=2|page=19|doi=10.1177/0163443708100319|url=http://0-web.ebscohost.com.maurice.bgsu.edu/ehost/detail?vid=3&amp;hid=15&amp;sid=44993088-138c-40ef-9fd0-95f42cce6fce%40sessionmgr14&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=a9h&amp;AN=37178702|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the range of production of classical music is from the 14th century to 21st century, most of this music (14th to early 20th century) belongs to the [[public domain]], mainly [[sheet music]] and [[tablature]]s. Some projects like [[Musopen]] and [[Open Goldberg Variations]] were created to produce musical audio files of high quality and release them into the public domain, most of them are available at the [[Internet Archive]] website.

The Open Goldberg Variations project released a [[braille]] format into the public domain that can be used to produce paper or electronic scores, [[Braille e-book]]s, for blind people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengoldbergvariations.org/braille-edition-open-goldberg-variations Braille edition of the Open Goldberg Variations] ny robertDouglass, Open Goldberg Variations, 23 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1990s, several research papers and popular books wrote on what came to be called the "[[Mozart effect]]": an observed temporary, small elevation of scores on certain tests as a result of listening to Mozart's works. The approach has been popularized in a book by Don Campbell, and is based on an experiment published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' suggesting that listening to Mozart temporarily boosted students' [[IQ]] by 8 to 9 points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6747/abs/400827a0.html Prelude or requiem for the 'Mozart effect'?] ''Nature'' '''400''' (August 26, 1999): 827.&lt;/ref&gt; This popularized version of the theory was expressed succinctly by the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' music columnist [[Alex Ross (music critic)|Alex Ross]]: "researchers... have determined that listening to Mozart actually makes you smarter."&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Ross (music critic)|Ross, Alex]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05EFDF1239F93BA1575BC0A962958260 "Classical View; Listening To Prozac... Er, Mozart"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 28, 1994. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Promoters marketed CDs claimed to induce the effect. Florida passed a law requiring toddlers in state-run schools to listen to classical music every day, and in 1998 the governor of Georgia budgeted $105,000 per year to provide every child born in Georgia with a tape or CD of classical music. One of the co-authors of the original studies of the Mozart effect commented "I don't think it can hurt. I'm all for exposing children to wonderful cultural experiences. But I do think the money could be better spent on [[music education]] programs."&lt;ref&gt;Goode, Erica. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E0D81131F930A3575BC0A96F958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=3 "Mozart for Baby? Some Say, Maybe Not"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 3, 1999. Retrieved on May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996/97, a research study was conducted on a population of preschool through college students in the [[Cherry Creek School District]] in Denver, Colorado, US. The study showed that students who actively listen to classical music before studying had higher academic scores. The research further indicated that students who listened to the music prior to an examination also had positively elevated achievement scores. Students who listened to [[rock-and-roll]] or [[Country music]] had moderately lower scores. The study further indicated that students who used classical music during the course of study had a significant leap in their academic performance; whereas, those who listened to other types of music had significantly lowered academic scores. The research was conducted over several schools within the Cherry Creek School District and was conducted through the [[University of Colorado]]. This study is reflective of several recent studies (i.e. Mike Manthei and Steve N. Kelly of the University of Nebraska at Omaha; Donald A. Hodges and Debra S. O'Connell of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; etc.) and others{{Full citation needed|date=September 2016}} who had significant results through the [[discourse]] of their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |title=The Impact of Music Education on Academic Achievement |accessdate=1 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916075557/http://www.issaquah.wednet.edu/documents/highschool/Schedule/Arts/Achievement.pdf |archivedate=September 16, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Code Lyoko: Evolution''''' is the sequel to the [[France|French]] [[Cartoon series|animated television series]] ''[[Code Lyoko]]''. It premiered on December 19, 2012, on [[France 4]] and repeated October 9, 2016, on [[Boing (France)|Boing]]. It blends live-action with [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], picking up where the original series left off. In addition to improving upon the CGI in the original series, the soundtrack has been overhauled as well.

==Plot==
Set one year after the events of the [[Code Lyoko|original series]], Aelita Schaeffer, Jeremie Belpois, Odd Della Robbia, Ulrich Stern, Yumi Ishiyama, and William Dunbar return to their daily lives and routines at Kadic Academy. X.A.N.A., despite their success in defeating it previously, suddenly reappears, reborn with even more strength and power than ever before. The protagonists reactivate Franz Hopper's quantum supercomputer, which runs the virtual world Lyoko, and resume their former double lives in order to protect humanity from X.A.N.A.'s evil schemes once again. Joined by William Dunbar, who has finally been accepted as the sixth Lyoko Warrior, and an unreliable girl-genius named Laura Gauthier, the seven heroes are bent on unraveling the reasons for such a return and to exterminate X.A.N.A., the malevolently evil sentient, autonomous [[artificial intelligence]]/[[multi-agent system]] that is threatening the world once again.

X.A.N.A. is currently unable to take over the network due to it missing some of its essential "Codes," which it injected into the Lyoko Warriors, except for William, during their final virtualization in the original series, and is now trying to steal them back through its Spectres. Jeremie reasons that if X.A.N.A. regains all of its Codes, it will take over the internet and nothing will stop it. One benefit to having Codes, however, is that the carrier can deactivate towers on Lyoko under X.A.N.A.'s control, making all but William capable of doing so, as opposed to just Aelita alone. With the help of Laura, Jeremie works to write a virus program that will be capable of hopefully eradicating X.A.N.A. for good this time.

In addition to X.A.N.A., the gang eventually discover that they have another dangerous enemy, a [[mad scientist]] named Professor Lowell Tyron, who seems to be the one responsible for unintentionally returning X.A.N.A. to life, despite his claim that he has no knowledge of X.A.N.A., despite its high level of activity in the Cortex system, which is a Replika (Lyoko-like virtual world) that Tyron created, though the reason why is never specified. He commands a group of several virtual human avatars in green and black-striped ninja-like costumes to counter the Lyoko Warriors' efforts to hack into his system. In Tyron's lab, the group also discovers Aelita's long-lost mother, Anthea Hopper-Schaeffer. They seek to discover why she is with their new enemy and how to reunite Anthea and her daughter.

In the open-ended cliffhanger finale, ''"Ultimate Mission"'', it is revealed that Tyron had been married to Anthea Hopper for several years, and is now Aelita's stepfather. His ultimate intention, however, was to get his hands on her late husband's archives, so that he could effectively create the Cortex, which a gravely weakened X.A.N.A. then secretly inhabited as a temporary master location, to carry out its plans for world domination once again. Anthea herself only married Tyron to have a chance to see Aelita again. Tyron attempts to coerce Aelita into telling her friends to abort their plan to destroy the Cortex and coming with him, as he has legal custody of her, or risk never seeing her mother again. Aelita chooses to forsake her mother and go through with their original plan, and Tyron orders his subordinates to shut down his supercomputer while the Lyoko Warriors are still inside. They barely escape, having just injected Jeremie's virus program into the core of the Cortex, which means that X.A.N.A. would be destroyed upon rebooting of Tyron's computer, unless either X.A.N.A. was able to back itself up, or Tyron is able to repair his supercomputer, and by extension, X.A.N.A. along with it. 
==Characters==
{{see also|List of Code Lyoko characters}}
There are several characters that do not appear in the original show:

*'''Laura Gauthier''', portrayed by Pauline Serieys''':''' is the latest Lyoko Warrior to be recruited by Jeremie Belpois in "Virus," though she is never virtualized into Lyoko. A tech-savvy youth, she is viewed with suspicion by the protagonists due to her uninitiated status. In "Mutiny," she is excluded from the group and has her memory erased for betraying them and risking William's life.
*'''Professor Tyron''', portrayed by Franck Beckmann: inadvertently works alongside the malevolent artificial intelligence, X.A.N.A.. His character is unintentionally responsible for X.A.N.A.'s rebirth as well as antagonizing Jeremie and his friends. He has been married to Aelita's mother, Anthea, for four years, making him Aelita's step-father. On Lyoko, he uses human avatars named '''Ninjas''' to attack Jeremie and his friends.
*'''Samantha Suarez''', portrayed by Louise Vallat, is an adaptation of Samantha Knight,&lt;ref&gt;http://en.codelyoko.fr/acteurs#secondary_actors&lt;/ref&gt; a [[supporting character]] who appeared in the original series. Notable differences between Samantha Suarez and Samantha Knight include personality and skin color (Suarez is Caucasian while Knight is African-French).

==Production==
The budget for the series was expected to be €5,600,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sudouest.fr/2012/02/29/en-chair-et-en-3d-646142-813.php |title=Angoulême : "Code Lyoko" en chair et en 3D |publisher=SudOuest.fr |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Code Lyoko Evolution received mixed-to-positive-to-negative reviews. While the improved CGI animation was viewed positively by fans (though the change from the unique art style put may fans off), reception to most of the other changes were either mixed or outright negative. Fans lambasted Laura Gauthier's character and had mixed views about the live-action shooting replacing 2-D animation in real life. Fans also criticized the casting choices and wooden acting of some of the performers. Aspects of the writing have also been criticized and it is generally seen as inferior to the original series. All of this lead to there only being one season with 26 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codelyoko.fandom.com/wiki/Code_Lyoko_Evolution|title=Code Lyoko Wikia : Code Lyoko Evolution |publisher=Guest.fr |date=2012 |accessdate=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cosmetic textiles''' are the functional [[textile]]s, including [[garment]]s, underwear which come in direct contact with the skin through the process of [[microencapsulation]]. They concern the treatment of the skin for a cosmetic approach (for example, the orange peel effect), but can also be a vehicle for other active functions, such as slimming and body shaping. Cosmetic textiles currently offered on the market claim to be moisturizing, perfumed, [[cellulite]] reducing and body slimming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knittingindustry.com/beyond-beauty-the-future-of-cosmtotextiles/|title=Beyond Beauty: The Future of Cosmétotextiles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''detective dénouement''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|d|eɪ|ˈ|n|uː|m|ɒ̃|,_|d|ɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˌ|d|eɪ|n|uː|ˈ|m|ɒ̃}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/denouement?q=D%C3%A9nouement "dénouement"]. ''[[Cambridge Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|denumɑ̃|lang}}) is a variant on the [[literature|literary]] [[dénouement]] common to [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] stories.

==Overview==
Detective dénouement was first popularised by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] [[novels]], but is present in many stories, such as the works of [[Agatha Christie]] or in [[Ellen Raskin]]'s young adult novel ''[[The Westing Game]]''.

In detective stories, the dénouement is the segment of a mystery novel in which the [[protagonist]] of the story, or a character serving in his or her stead, reveals all of the clues and lays out the conclusion for the other characters. This is usually in an attempt to show the readers how the character came to the conclusion and figured out the mystery. One famous example of the detective dénouement is the explanatory speech given by a [[forensic]] [[psychology|psychologist]] after the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of the 1960 film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. In the U.S. television series ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'', the title character ([[Adrian Monk]]) usually uses this method with the words "here's what happened." A [[black-and-white]] montage of the events prior to the murder accompanies his narration.

The '''East Kutubuan languages''' are a small [[language family|family]] of [[Trans–New Guinea languages]] (TNG) in the classification of [[Malcolm Ross (linguist)|Malcolm Ross]]. There are just two languages, 
:[[Fiwaga language|Fiwaga]] and [[Foi language|Foi]], 
which are not close to the [[West Kutubuan languages]]. These were linked in a "Kutubuan" family by Franklin and Voorhoeve in 1973, but that position has since been abandoned. Although East Kutubuan has proto-TNG vocabulary, Ross considers its inclusion in TNG to be somewhat questionable.

'''Educational Testing Service''' ('''ETS'''), founded in 1947, is the world's largest private nonprofit educational testing and assessment organization.&lt;ref name="fundinguniverse1"&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Educational-Testing-Service-Company-History.html History of the Educational Testing Service]&lt;/ref&gt; It is headquartered in [[Lawrence Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Lawrence Township]], [[New Jersey]], but has a [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]] address.

ETS develops various [[standardized test]]s primarily in the United States for [[K–12 education|K–12]] and [[higher education]], and it also administers international tests including the [[TOEFL]] (Test of English as a Foreign Language), [[TOEIC]] (Test of English for International Communication), [[Graduate Record Examination]] (GRE) General and Subject Tests, [[HiSET]] and The [[Praxis test]] Series — in more than 180 countries, and at over 9,000 locations worldwide.  Many of the assessments it develops are associated with entry to US [[tertiary education|tertiary]] (undergraduate) and [[quaternary education]] (graduate) institutions, but it also develops K–12 statewide assessments used for accountability testing in many states, including California, Texas, Tennessee, and Virginia.  In total, ETS annually administers 20 million exams in the U.S. and in 180 other countries.

==History==
ETS is a U.S.-registered [[501(c)#501(c)(3)|501(c)(3)]] [[non-profit organization]] created in 1947 by three other nonprofit educational institutions: the [[American Council on Education]] (ACE), [[The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]], and [[College Board|The College Entrance Examination Board]].&lt;ref name="fundinguniverse1"/&gt; ETS was formed in 1947 to take over the testing activities of its founders (whose organizations were not well suited to running operational assessment programs), and to pursue research intended to advance educational measurement and education.&lt;ref name="Fuess"&gt;{{cite news| last =Fuess| first =C.M.| title =The College Board: Its first fifty years.| pages =| publisher =New York: The Columbia University Press| year =1950| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ETS Origins"&gt;{{cite news| last =Educational Testing Service| first =| title =The Origins of Educational Testing Service.| pages =| publisher =Princeton, NJ: ETS| year =1992| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things, ACE gave to the new organization the Cooperative Test Service and the National Teachers Examination; Carnegie gave the GRE; and the College Board turned over to ETS the operation (but not ownership) of the [[SAT]] for graduating high school students.

==Scientific contributions==

In keeping with the purposes for which it was established, ETS developed a program of research that covered not only [[psychometrics|measurement]] and [[education]] but also such related areas as [[statistics]], [[educational evaluation]], and psychology, particularly [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[developmental psychology|developmental]], [[personality psychology|personality]], and [[social psychology]]. This broad-based research program attracted many individuals who distinguished themselves in their fields, often while at ETS but also in subsequent professorial positions. Among the more influential scientists have been Harold Gulliksen (whose book, "Theory of Mental Tests," helped codify [[classical test theory]]);&lt;ref name="Gulliksen memorial"&gt;{{cite news| last =Burkhart| first =F.| title =Harold Gulliksen, 93, Pioneer in Testing, Dies| pages =| work=The New York Times| url =https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/03/nyregion/harold-gulliksen-93-pioneer-in-testing-dies.html?pagewanted=1| accessdate =April 17, 2010 | date=November 3, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gulliksen book"&gt;{{cite news| last =Gulliksen| first =H.| title =Theory of Mental Tests| pages =| publisher =New York: Wiley| year =1950| url =| accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederic M.

Patricia Cross]] (adult education); [[Samuel Ball (educator)|Samuel Ball]] (an evaluation researcher who documented the positive educational effects of [[Sesame Street]]); and [[David Rosenhan]] (known for the [[Rosenhan experiment]], which challenged the validity of psychiatric diagnosis).

Members of the ETS staff have been among the presidents of the National Council on Measurement in Education (NCME); the [[Psychometric Society]]; the Measurement and Evaluation Division of the [[American Educational Research Association]] (AERA); the Evaluation, Measurement and Statistics Division of the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA); the APA Developmental Psychology Division; and the Jean Piaget Society. They have been among the executive editors of the ''[[Journal of Educational Measurement]]'', [[Journal of Educational and Behavioral Statistics]], Educational Evaluation and Policy Analysis, Journal of Educational Psychology, Journal of Applied Developmental Psychology, and Discourse Processes. Major citations have included the APA Distinguished Contributions to Knowledge Award (Norman Frederiksen, 1984), the APA Distinguished Scientific Contribution Award (Frederic Lord, 1988); the AERA E.F. Lindquist Award (William Turnbull, 1981; Frederic Lord, 1988; Samuel Messick, 1994; Paul Holland, 2000; Wendy Yen, 2008); the NCME Career Contributions to Educational Measurement Award (Frederic Lord, 1990; Paul Holland, 2004; Neil Dorans, 2010); and the Jean Piaget Society's Lifetime Achievement Award (Irving Sigel, 2002); among many other awards.

The high caliber of scientific staff allowed ETS to produce both new knowledge and methodology, especially in measurement and statistics, much of which has been taken up by assessment organizations around the world. Among the key scientific contributions were:

Not including its for-profit subsidiaries, ETS employs about 2,700 individuals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_17/b3880102.htm | title = A Syllabus Way Beyond The SATs | author = Jennifer Merritt | date = 2004-04-26 | work = [[Business Week]] | accessdate = 2007-07-04 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071028174700/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_17/b3880102.htm | archivedate = 2007-10-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; including 240 with doctorates and an additional 350 others with "higher degrees."

To help support its nonprofit educational mission, ETS, like many other nonprofits, conducts business activities that are unrelated to that mission (e.g., employment testing). Under US tax law, these activities may be conducted (within limits) by the nonprofit itself, or by for-profit subsidiaries.&lt;ref name="Randy Elliot Bennett 2005"/&gt; Most of the "off-mission" work conducted by ETS is carried out by such wholly owned, for-profit subsidiaries as [[Prometric]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-07-03/business/0707030146_1_prometric-testing-and-assessment-assessment-services ETS buys Prometric]&lt;/ref&gt; which delivers tests for hundreds of third-party clients, ETS Global BV, which contains much of the international operations of the company, ETS China, and ETS Canada.

About 25% of the work carried out by ETS is contracted by the [[College Board]], a private, nonprofit membership association of universities, colleges, school districts, and secondary schools. The most popular and well-known of the College Board's tests is the [[SAT]], taken by more than 3 million students annually. ETS also develops and administers The College Board's Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test ([[PSAT/NMSQT]]) and the [[Advanced Placement]] program, which is widely used in US high schools for advanced course credit.

Since 1983, ETS has conducted the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), known as the "Nation's Report Card," under contract to the US [[National Center for Education Statistics]]. NAEP is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of what US students know and can do. ETS is responsible for coordination among the nine NAEP Alliance contractors, for item development, and for design, data analysis, and reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/contracts/history.asp|format=| title = The History of NAEP Contractors| author = National Center for Education Statistics| work = | year = 2010| accessdate = 2010-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the contract work that ETS undertakes for nonprofit and government entities like the College Board, the National Center for Education Statistics, and state education departments, the organization offers its own tests. These tests include the [[Graduate Record Examinations]] (GRE) (for graduate and professional school admissions), the [[Test of English as a Foreign Language]] (TOEFL) (for post-secondary admissions), the [[Test of English for International Communication]] (TOEIC) (for use by business and industry), and the [[Praxis Series]] (for teacher licensure and certification).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ets.org|title = ETS| author = ETS| work = | year = 2010| accessdate = 2010-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]] and [[Wales]], [[ETS Europe]], a unit of the ETS Global for-profit subsidiary, was contracted to mark and process the [[National Curriculum assessment]]s on behalf of the government. ETS Global took over this role in 2008 from [[Edexcel]], a subsidiary of [[Pearson PLC|Pearson]], which had encountered significant and repeated problems in carrying out the marking and processing contract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/1771461.stm Examiners knew about maths error]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,591-1772007,00.html Call for a GCSE shake-up as pass mark sinks to 16%]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/4172812.stm Admin staff 'marking GCSE papers']&lt;/ref&gt; As was the case for Edexcel, The first year of ETS Global's operation was struck by a number of problems, including the late arrival of scripts to examiners, a database of student entries being unavailable,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/sats/story/0,,2280299,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=8| title = Headteachers angry at Sats 'nightmare'| accessdate =2008-05-17 | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Anthea | last=Lipsett | date=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and countrywide reports of problems with the marking of the papers. The opposition [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] (Tory) criticized the awarding of the contracts to ETS, and produced a dossier listing previous problems with ETS's service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://education.guardian.co.uk/schools/story/0,,2291802,00.html|title = A history of exam failures|publisher=The Guardian|date= 19 July 2008 | location=London | first=Polly | last=Curtis | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ETS contract with the [[Qualifications and Curriculum Authority|QCA]] was terminated in August 2008, with an agreement to pay back £19.5m and cancel invoices worth £4.6m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7562835.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sats marking contract is scrapped | date=August 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the contract for National Curriculum assessment marking and processing was again awarded to Edexcel. Like the two prior contracts, the Edexcel contract has encountered significant quality problems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2009/jun/04/sats-markers-delays|format=| title = Hundreds of Sats examiners wrongly disqualified| author = Guardian| work = The Guardian| date = 4 June 2009| accessdate = 2010-05-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tests themselves, the focus of longstanding controversy in the English education community and among the public, have been subjected to a massive boycott by schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/may/06/planned-sats-boycott|format=| title = Hundreds of primaries to boycott Sats| author = Guardian| work = The Guardian| date = 6 May 2010| accessdate = 2010-05-14 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, ETS released the My Credentials Vault Service with Interfolio, Inc to "simplify the entire letter of recommendation process".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ets.org/Media/Campaign/12150/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
ETS has been criticized for being a "highly competitive business operation that is as much multinational monopoly as nonprofit institution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30915FB3B5E0C738FDDA00894DF494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fE%2fEducational%20Testing%20Service| title = Testing Giant Exceeds Roots, Drawing Business Rivals' Ire | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07 | first1=Jon | last1=Nordheimer | first2=Douglas | last2=Frantz | date=September 30, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to its legal status as a non-profit organization, ETS is exempt from paying federal corporate income tax on many, but not all, of its operations. Furthermore, it does not need to report financial information to the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], though it does annually report detailed financial information to the [[IRS]] on [[Form 990]], which is publicly available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://andyhilbert.blogspot.com/2005/11/teacher-watch-ets-monopoly-continues.html| title = Teacher Watch: ETS Monopoly Continues | work = [[HorseSense and Nonsense]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to growing criticism of its monopolistic power, New York state passed the Educational Testing Act, a disclosure law which required ETS to make available certain test questions and graded answer sheets to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.answers.com/topic/educational-testing-service-company-private-not-for-profit?cat=biz-fin| title = Educational Testing Service - Hoover's profile | work = [[Answers.com]] | accessdate = 2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Problems administering England's national tests in 2008 by ETS Europe were the subject of thousands of complaints recorded by the [[Times Educational Supplement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.tes.co.uk/search/story/?story_id=2644172|title=Chaos casts doubt over tests deadline|author=Warwick Mansell|date=4 July 2008|publisher=Times Educational Supplement}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their operations were also described as a "''shambles''" in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]], where a financial penalty was called for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7409234.stm|title=MPs criticise testing 'shambles'|publisher=BBC|date=20 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Complaints included papers not being marked properly, or not being marked at all&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7511922.stm|title=More questions about Sats results|publisher=BBC|date=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and papers being sent to the wrong schools or lost completely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7521459.stm |title=Schools hunting missing papers |publisher=BBC|date=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has even been suggested that the quality of service is so poor that the [[Department for Children, Schools and Families]] (formerly the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]]) might not be able to publish the 2008 league tables of school performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7513619.stm |title=League tables 'might be scrapped' |publisher=BBC|author=Mike Baker|date=18 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the contract was ended by "mutual consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/7562835.stm | work=BBC News | title=Sats marking contract is scrapped | date=August 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK government asked Lord Sutherland to conduct an inquiry into the failure of the 2008 tests. The report included in its main findings:

''•	primary responsibility for this summer’s delivery failure rests with ETS Global BV, which won the public contract to deliver the tests;''&lt;br&gt;
''•	ETS’s capacity to deliver the contract proved to be insufficient. A lack of comprehensive planning and testing by ETS of its systems and processes was a key factor in the delivery failure;''

In 1983, students of [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|James A. Garfield High School]] in [[East Los Angeles, California]], achieved unexpectedly high exam results on the ETS Advanced Placement Exam. ETS implied that the students may have cheated to obtain such results based on common mistakes across different exams.  The students were required to prove their abilities and innocence by taking a second exam, which they did successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2002/07/01/stand-and-deliver-revisited Stand and Deliver Revisited]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Americans for Educational Testing Reform]] (AETR) claims that ETS is violating its non-profit status through excessive profits, executive compensation, and governing board member pay (which the IRS specifically advises against&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=United States Internal Revenue Service | title=Good Governance Practices for 501(c)(3) Organizations | url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/governance_practices.pdf | format=PDF | date= February 7, 2007| accessdate=2009-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;). AETR further claims that ETS is acting unethically by selling test preparation materials, directly lobbying legislators and government officials, and refusing to acknowledge test-taker rights. It also criticises ETS for forcing GRE test-takers to participate in research experiments during the actual exam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Americans for Educational Testing Reform | title=America's Corporate Guinea Pigs - How ETS Exploits GRE Test-Takers | url=http://aetr.org/downloads/How_ETS_Exploits_GRE_Takers.pdf | format=PDF | date= 10 May 2009 | accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also come under criticism for paying its part-time employees, most of whom are drawn from the less than 10% of the U.S. population with graduate degrees, a modest $15 an hour (with no benefits), to grade the essay component of their standardized exams. A minimum of a bachelor's degree is required of first time raters, and they are paid only $13 hourly. In December 2017, ETS, who had hired an enormous amount of new raters for the SAT program and lost the contract after one year, infiltrated other programs with the new hires and punished long-standing raters by lowering their pay 3-5 dollars per hour after years of hard-earned service.

In 2014 the [[BBC]] reported that the [[Home Office]] has suspended English language tests run by ETS after a BBC investigation uncovered systematic fraud in the student visa system. Secret filming of government-approved English exams needed for a visa showed entire rooms of candidates having the tests faked for them &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26024375 Student visa system fraud exposed in BBC investigation]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fondue''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɒ|n|dj|uː|,_|f|ɒ|n|ˈ|dj|uː}};&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press, [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/fondue "Oxford Dictionaries Online: 'fondue'"], ''Oxford Dictionaries Online'', Retrieved 16 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=fondue], ''American Heritage Dictionary'', Retrieved 10 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|fɔ̃dy|lang}}) is a [[Swiss cuisine|Swiss]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://global.britannica.com/topic/fondue Fondue], [[Encyclopædia Britannica]], global.britannica.com,  retrieved 12 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; and French Savoyard dish of melted cheese served in a communal pot (''[[caquelon]]'' or fondue pot) over a [[portable stove]] (''réchaud'') heated with a candle or [[chafing fuel|spirit lamp]], and eaten by dipping bread into the cheese using long-stemmed forks. It was promoted as a Swiss [[national dish]] by the [[Swiss Cheese Union]] (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s, and was popularized in North America in the 1960s.

Since the 1950s, the term "fondue" has been generalized to other dishes in which a food is dipped into a communal pot of liquid kept hot in a fondue pot: chocolate fondue, in which pieces of fruit or pastry are dipped into a melted chocolate mixture, and ''fondue bourguignonne'', in which pieces of meat are cooked in hot oil or broth.

==Etymology==
The word ''fondue'' is the feminine [[participle|passive past participle]] of the French verb ''fondre'' ("to melt") used as a noun.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trésor de la langue française]]'', ''s.v.'' [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/fondue/substantif ''fondue''] and [http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/fondue/verbe ''fondre'', etymology section B.3.a]&lt;/ref&gt; It is first attested in French in 1735, in [[Vincent la Chapelle]]'s ''Cuisinier moderne'',&lt;ref name='la chapelle'&gt;Vincent la Chapelle, ''Le cuisinier moderne'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYYEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA220 p. 220]&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 1878.&lt;ref name='oed'&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]], Second edition, 1989; online version November 2010. [http://www.oed.com/Entry/72616 ''s.v.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The earliest known recipe for [[cheese]] fondue as we know it today comes from a 1699 book published in [[Zurich]], under the name "Käss&lt;!--This is not the modern spelling, but the spelling used in the cited publication of 1699--&gt; mit Wein zu kochen", "to cook cheese with wine".&lt;ref&gt;''Kochbuch der Anna Margaretha Gessner'', 1699, cited by Albert Hauser, ''Vom Essen und Trinken im alten Zürich'', cited by Isabelle Raboud-Schüle, "Comment la fondue vint aux Suisses", ''Annales fribourgeoises'' 72:101–112 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; It calls for grated or cut-up cheese to be melted with wine, and for bread to be dipped in it.

However, the ''name'' "cheese fondue", until the late nineteenth century, referred to a preparation including eggs and cheese, as in la Chapelle's 1735 ''Fonduë de Fromage, aux Truffes Fraiches''&lt;!--spelling and punctuation as in the original--&gt;&lt;ref name='la chapelle'/&gt; it was something between [[scrambled eggs]] with cheese and a cheese [[soufflé]].&lt;ref&gt;Prosper Montagne, ''Larousse Gastronomique'', 1938, p. 483, quoted in the [http://www.foodtimeline.org/foodfaq1.html#fondue Food Timeline FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Brillat-Savarin]] wrote in 1834 that it is "nothing other than scrambled eggs with cheese".&lt;ref name='brillat-savarin'&gt;"Ce n'est autre chose que des œufs brouillés au fromage", Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, ''Physiologie du goût'', 1834, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hpFLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA336 p.336-9]&lt;/ref&gt; Variations included cream ("à la genevoise") and truffles ("à la piémontaise") in addition to eggs, as well as what is now called "[[raclette]]" ("fondue valaisanne").&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Favre]], ''Dictionnaire universel de Cuisine'', Paris 1894, cited by Raboud-Schüle, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known recipe for the modern cheese fondue under that name, with cheese and wine but no eggs, was published in 1875, and was already presented as a Swiss [[national dish]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis Favre, ''L'habitation--&amp;#8203;le vêtement--&amp;#8203;les aliments. Manuel d'économie domestique à l'usage des écoles secondaires et primaires supérieures'', Neuchâtel 1875, cited by Raboud-Schüle, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its modern associations with rustic mountain life, it was a town-dweller's dish from the lowlands of western, [[Romandy#French|French-speaking]], Switzerland: rich cheese like Gruyère was a valuable [[cash crop|export item]] which peasants could not afford to eat.&lt;ref name='muhieddine'&gt;Fabian Muhieddine, "La fondue: un coup marketing de 1930!", ''Le Matin.ch'', reporting on a lecture by Isabelle Raboud-Schüle [http://www.lematin.ch/actu/suisse/fondue-coup-marketing-1930-43840 full text]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raboud-Schüle, p. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of [[cornstarch]] ("Maïzena") to Switzerland in 1905 made it easier to make a smooth and stable [[emulsion]] of the wine and cheese, and probably contributed to the success of fondue.&lt;ref&gt;Raboud-Schüle, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Fondue was popularized as a Swiss national dish by the [[Swiss Cheese Union]] (Schweizerische Käseunion) in the 1930s as a way of increasing cheese consumption. The Swiss Cheese Union also created pseudo-regional recipes as part of the "spiritual defence of Switzerland".&lt;ref name='raboud'&gt;Isabelle Raboud-Schüle, director of the [[Musée gruérien]], interview "History of Cheese Fondue" {{cite web |url=http://blog.swisster.com/food_corner/page/2/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100720131727/http://blog.swisster.com/food_corner/page/2/ |archivedate=2010-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Public Radio, "The Fondue Conspiracy", ''Planet Money'' '''575''' (October 10, 2014) [https://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/10/355177578/episode-575-the-fondue-conspiracy]&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]] rationing ended, the Swiss Cheese Union continued its marketing campaign, sending fondue sets to military regiments and event organizers across Switzerland.  Fondue is now a symbol of Swiss unity.&lt;ref name='raboud'/&gt;

In the meantime, fondue continued to be promoted aggressively in Switzerland, with slogans like "La fondue crée la bonne humeur" 'fondue creates a good mood' and (1981, in [[Swiss German]]) "Fondue isch guet und git e gueti Luune" 'fondue is good and creates a good mood' – abbreviated as "figugegl".&lt;ref&gt;Raboud-Schüle, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Fondue was promoted to Americans at the Swiss Pavilion's Alpine restaurant at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence R. Samuel, ''End of the Innocence: The 1964-1965 New York World's Fair'', p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;

The extension of the name "fondue" to other dishes served in a communal hot pot dates to 1950s New York. Konrad Egli, a Swiss restaurateur, introduced ''fondue bourguignonne'' at his Chalet Suisse restaurant in 1956. In the mid 1960s, he invented chocolate fondue as part of a [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]] for [[Toblerone]] chocolate.&lt;ref name='lovegren'&gt;Sylvia Lovegren, ''Fashionable Food: Seven Decades of Food Fads'', pp. 240-2&lt;/ref&gt; A sort of [[chocolate mousse]] or chocolate cake had also sometimes been called "chocolate fondue" starting in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Popik, ''The Big Apple'' blog, [http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/new_york_city/entry/chocolate_fondue_myth/ "Chocolate Fondue (myth)"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
[[Image:Full cheese fondue set - in Switzerland.JPG|thumb|right|A full cheese fondue set in Switzerland.  Apart from pieces of bread to dip into the melted cheese, there are side servings of [[kirsch]], raw [[garlic]], pickled [[gherkins]], [[onions]], and [[olives]].]]
Cheese fondue consists of a blend of cheeses, wine and seasoning. To prepare the ''caquelon'' it is first rubbed with a cut [[garlic]] clove. [[White wine]] is slightly heated with cornstarch, and then grated cheese is added and stirred until melted. It is often topped off with a bit of [[kirsch]]. The [[cornstarch]] or other starch is added to prevent separation. The mixture is stirred continuously as it heats in the ''caquelon''.

When it is ready, diners dip cubes of [[bread]] speared on a fondue fork into the mixture.

===Temperature and ''la religieuse''===
A cheese fondue mixture should be kept warm enough to keep the fondue smooth and liquid but not so hot that it burns. If this temperature is held until the fondue is finished there will be a thin crust of toasted (not burnt) cheese at the bottom of the ''caquelon''. This is called ''la religieuse'' (French for ''the nun''). It has the texture of a cracker and is almost always lifted out and eaten.

[[Image:Chocolatefondue.JPG|thumb|right|''Chocolate Fondue'']]
[[Image:Fondue2.jpg|thumb|right|''Fondue Bourguignonne'']]

===Broth===
''Fondue chinoise'' (lit. "Chinese fondue") is a common name for [[hot pot]], where meat and vegetables are cooked in a shared pot of broth, or just dip the sliced meat with fondue fork into boiling broth with salad as side dish&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.blick.ch/news/fleischfondue-richtig-geniessen-so-isst-man-richtig-das-fleischfondue-id7763914.html|title=Fleischfondue richtig genießen : so isst man richtig das Fleischfondue|last=|first=|date=|website=Blick.ch|archive-url=|archive-date=2018-05-23|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Various sauces are provided on the side. Uniquely the meal is finished off when all the diners have finished cooking their ingredients by sharing out the broth, which now contains an amalgam of all of the flavors from the earlier ingredients.

===Chocolate===
Slices of [[fruit]] or [[pastry]] are dipped in a caquelon of melted [[chocolate]], often flavored with [[rum]] or [[kirschwasser]]. Dessert fondues may also be made with [[coconut]], [[honey]], [[caramel]], or [[marshmallow]].

===Oil===
''Fondue bourguignonne'' consists of a fondue pot filled with hot oil into which diners dip pieces of meat to cook them. Various [[dipping sauces]] are provided on the side.

===Wine===
"Fondue vigneronne" or "Fondue Bacchus" is like fondue bourguignonne, with wine rather than oil. Red wine fondue consists of red wine boiled, and seasoned with salt, pepper, garlic, onions and herbs; the white wine version is spiced with cinnamon, chilis, coriander, white pepper and enriched with chicken broth. The guests then dip meat, fish or vegetables in the caquelon and top them with [[bearnaise]], [[tartare]] sauce or simply French [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].

===Slab===
Consists of a metallic or stone slab. Primarily for meat fondue, oil or olive oil is poured on the slab, and the meat is cooked over it like in a pan. It is a very common form of fondue in South America.

==Traditions and etiquette==
A tradition says that if a man loses his bread in the pot, he buys drinks all around.&lt;ref name='lovegren'/&gt;

Fondue is eaten by spearing a piece of bread on a fork, swirling it in the pot, and putting it into the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Kemer, ''Fabulous Fondues: Appetizers, Main Courses, and Desserts'', 2000, {{isbn|0806954892}}, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Some writers recommend that the dipping fork be used only to transport the food from the pot to one's plate, not to eat from.&lt;ref&gt;Ellen Brown, ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to Fondues and Hot Dips'', p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of beverage to drink with fondue is specified in several conflicting traditions; some demand that white wine should be drunk, while others specify black tea as the beverage of choice. Some people drink a shot of spirits during or after the meal. A study published in 2010 showed that none of these beverages caused indigestion after eating fondue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Henriette Heinrich |author2=Oliver Goetze |author3=Dieter Menne |author4=Peter X Iten |author5=Heiko Fruehauf |author6=Stephan R Vavricka |author7=Werner Schwizer |author8=Michael Fried |author9=Mark Fox |title=Effect on gastric function and symptoms of drinking wine, black tea, or schnapps with a Swiss cheese fondue: randomised controlled crossover trial|journal=BMJ|date=December 2010|volume=341|doi=10.1136/bmj.c6731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|hanamachi}}
{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{nihongo|'''''Hanamachi'''''|花街|}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[geisha]] district. The word's literal meaning is "flower town". Such districts contain various ''[[okiya]]'' (geisha houses) and ''[[ochaya]]'' (teahouses).

Historically, ''Hanamachi'' typically contained a number of ''okiya'' and ''ochaya'', along with a ''[[kaburenjō]]'' (歌舞練所).
The ''kaburenjō'' was a meeting place for geisha, usually with a theatre, rooms where geisha classes can be held, and the ''kenban'' offices, which dealt with geisha's pay, regulation and similar matters. [[Gion]], a district in [[Kyoto]], also has a vocational school, called ''[[Nyokoba]]''. Many of the teachers there are designated as [[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasures]]. The [[onsen geisha]] communities of [[onsen]] (hot spring resort) towns are not considered hanamachi, and not listed below.

== Yūkaku ==
''Hanamachi'' were preceded by and should not be confused with traditional courtesan/prostitution districts known as {{Nihongo||[[:ja:遊廓|遊廓]]、遊郭|yūkaku|pleasure quarter, [[red-light district]]}}. These were three districts, established in the early 1600s in Kyoto, Osaka, and Edo (now Tokyo), respectively: [[Shimabara, Kyoto|Shimabara]] for [[Kyoto|Kyōto]] (1640&lt;ref name="FTFW"&gt;Avery, Anne Louise. ''Flowers of the Floating World: Geisha and Courtesans in Japanese Prints and Photographs, 1772–1926'' [Exhibition Catalogue] (Sanders of Oxford &amp; Mayfield Press: Oxford, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Shinmachi]] for [[Osaka|Ōsaka]] (1624–1644&lt;ref name="FTFW"/&gt;) and [[Yoshiwara]] for Edo (1617&lt;ref name="FTFW"/&gt;). The workers in these districts were known as {{nihongo|''yūjo''|[[:ja:遊女|遊女]]}}, of which the highest ranked were ''[[oiran]],'' and rather than the ''ochaya'' and ''okiya'' of geisha, these featured ageya as entertainment venues. Geisha developed about a century later, in the mid-1700s, often in courtesan districts, and thus these districts developed into ''hanamachi.'' All three districts are now defunct, both as courtesan districts and geisha districts, though some tourist-oriented establishments are preserved in Shimabara, Kyoto, and some conventional sex work establishments continue to exist in Yoshiwara, Tokyo.

=== Kyoto hanamachi ===
{{ external media
| image1 = [http://kazenotabi-kyoto.com/encyclopedia-town-image/map-kagai.jpg Map of Kyoto kagai]&lt;ref&gt;[http://kazenotabi-kyoto.com/encyclopedia-town/kagai.html 京都の花街] {{ja-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

There are currently five active hanamachi in Kyoto (in Kyoto these are generally referred to as ''kagai'' instead of "hanamachi"), sometimes referred to as {{Nihongo||五花街|gokagai|5 hanamachi}}; there were previously six, but Shimabara is now defunct, remaining as a tourist attraction.
* [[Gion]] (separated as Gion Kōbu and Gion Higashi)
* [[Miyagawa-chō]]
* [[Kamishichiken]]
* [[Ponto-chō]]
Defunct:
* [[Shimabara, Kyoto|Shimabara]] – also previous courtesans' district (only one in Kyoto, one of three in Japan)

These are primarily clustered around the [[Kamo River]], from [[Sanjō Street (Kyoto)|Sanjō Street]] (3rd Street) to [[Gojō Street]] (5th Street), particularly around [[Shijō Street]] – four of the five districts are in this area. Kamishichiken is separated from the others, being far to the northwest, while the defunct district of Shimabara is also located to the west. Narrowly speaking, districts are centered around their respective {{nihongo|rehearsal halls|歌舞練場|kabu renjō|lit. singing and dancing training space}}.

==== Traditions ====
Each district has a distinctive crest ([[Mon (emblem)|kamon]]), which appears on geisha's kimonos, as well as on lanterns ([http://www.immortalgeisha.com/wiki/index.php?title=Kamon#Kamon_of_the_Hanamachi_of_Kyoto list of crests]).

A summer tradition,               around the time of the [[Gion Festival]] among Kyoto hanamachis is to distribute personalized {{Nihongo||団扇|[[uchiwa]]|flat fans}} to favored patrons and stores the [[maiko]] and geiko (the dialectal word for [[geisha]] in [[Kyoto]] and [[Kanazawa]]; in general, refers to geisha from western Japan) frequent. These feature a crest of the geisha house on the front, and the geiko's name on the back (house name, then personal name). These are produced by {{Nihongo||小丸屋　住井|Komaru-ya Sumii|Sumii (family name) Small circle house}}, and the product name is {{Nihongo||京丸うちわ|Kyōmaru-uchiwa|Kyoto round uchiwa}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.komaruya.jp/english/index.html Komaruya Sumii] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705212617/http://www.komaruya.jp/english/index.html |date=2012-07-05 }} (English)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kvg"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishments in hanamachis that have many geiko clients often accumulate many of these fans, and proudly display them as a sign of quality.&lt;ref name="kvg" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://kyotofoodie.com/oimatsu-citrus-jelly/ Wagashi: Kamishichiken Oimatsu Bitter Citrus Summer Jelly]", ''[http://kyotofoodie.com/ Kyoto Foodie],'' August 23rd, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Kyoto hanamachi stage public dances annually, or ''[[Japanese traditional dance|odori]]'' (generally written in [[Historical kana orthography|traditional kana spelling]] as をどり, rather than modern おどり), featuring both maiko and geiko. These also feature an optional [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] (tea and [[wagashi]] served by maiko) before the performance. These are performed for several weeks, mostly in the spring – four hanamachi hold them in the spring, one (Gion Higashi) holds their show in the autumn. Different districts started public performances in different years; the oldest are Gion Kōbu and Pontocho, whose performances started at the [[Kyoto exhibition]] of 1872,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miyako-odori.jp/odori_en.html Miyako Odori] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415201819/http://www.miyako-odori.jp/odori_en.html |date=2012-04-15 }} "A Brief History of the Miyako Odori"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php Maiko Dance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131003/http://www.intojapan.co.uk/festivals/maiko-dance.php |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others (Kamishichiken, Miyagawachō) started performing in the 1950s. There are many performances, with tickets being inexpensive, ranging from around 1500 yen to 4500 yen.&lt;ref name="geishadances"&gt;[http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html Geisha dances] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130102225341/http://www.geishaofjapan.com/tourism/dances.html |date=2013-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known is ''Miyako odori,'' by Gion Kōbu, which is one of the two oldest and has the most performances.

The dances (name of performance and explanation) are as follows (listed in order of performance through the year):
* {{Nihongo||北野をどり|Kitano odori|name of area – see [[Kitano Tenman-gū]]}} – Kamishichiken (since 1953), spring, varying dates, currently last week of March and first week of April
* {{Nihongo||都をどり|Miyako odori|capital}} – Gion Kōbu (since 1872), all of April
* {{Nihongo||京をどり|Kyō odori|Kyo(to), capital}} – [[Miyagawa-chō]] (since the 1950s), first 2 weeks of April
* {{Nihongo||鴨川をどり|Kamogawa odori|[[Kamo River]]}} – [[Ponto-chō]] (since 1872), most of May
* {{Nihongo||祇園をどり|Gion odori|[[Gion]]}} – Gion Higashi, early November
There was also previously:
* {{Nihongo||青柳踊|Aoyagi odori|Green willow, willow in leaf}} – Shimabara (from 1873 to 1880; ceased in 1881)
There is also a combined show of all five districts, which is called {{Nihongo|"Five Geisha District Combined Public Performance"|五花街合同公演|gokagai gōdō kōen}}, or more formally {{Nihongo|"Kyoto's five geisha districts combined traditional theater special public performance"|京都五花街合同伝統芸能特別公演|Kyōto gokagai gōdō dentō geinō tokubetsu kōen}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ookinizaidan.com/event/index.html 京都五花街合同伝統芸能特別公演] {{ja-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; This takes place during the daytime on two days (Saturday and Sunday) on a weekend in late June (typically last or second-to-last weekend) at a large venue, and tickets are significantly more expensive than those for individual districts. Connected with this event, in the evening on these two days there are evening performances with [[kaiseki]] meals, either a combined event, or separate ones per district. This is known as the {{Nihongo|"Five Geisha Districts Evening"|五花街の夕べ|gokagai no yūbe}}, and is quite expensive (as is usual for kaiseki), and very limited availability; this has been held since 1994.

The '''Israel Cultural Excellence Foundation''' (IcExcellence) is a private cultural foundation which aims to identify, nurture, and support [[Israel]]'s most outstanding artists. 

The foundation locates Israeli artists with potential for excellence in a wide variety of artistic fields, including [[visual arts]], music (classical, jazz, and Israeli), dance, theater, cinema, [[product design]], [[visual communication]], fashion design, and writing. The foundation supports its chosen artists for a period of up to five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icexcellence.com//emppage.asp?id=81 The chosen people, Aviva Lori, [[Haaretz]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The foundation==
IcExcellence was founded by its managing director Rachel Marani, formerly Israel’s cultural [[attaché]] in [[Washington, DC|Washington]]. It is financed by businesspeople, companies, and foundations from Israel and all over the world. 

The artistic advisory committees consist of 35 artists and public opinion makers, including six [[Israel Prize]] laureates, all acting on a voluntary basis.  Members include Dubi Lenz, Gal Uchovsky, [[David Tartakover]], Michal Smoira-Cohn, [[Chaim Topol]], [[Dani Caravan]], Yossi Marhaim, [[Mendi Rodan]], [[Ohad Naharin]], Danny Gottfried, Ron Arad, Asher Fisch, Gershon Bram, Alex Padua, and Micha Lewensohn.

The work of the foundation focuses on two main areas.  The first, "Developing and advancing the artist’s knowledge and skills", involves building a personal advancement program suited to the artist and their needs. The programs may include taking advanced courses in a foreign country, or learning a relevant professional software program. The second area, "Developing and advancing the artist’s professional career, involves encouraging artists to assume a proactive approach to advancing their careers, based on the understanding that great artistic talent is a prerequisite but in itself does not suffice for developing a prominent local and/or international career. Seminars and annual meetings deal with “career skills”, exposing the artists to subjects such as strategic and business counseling, self-presentation, marketing, branding, and networking. Business coaching is also offered.

The '''Jugović brothers''' ({{lang-sr|Браћа Југовићи}}), or '''Nine Jugović''' (Девет Југовића), commonly known as the '''''Jugovići''''', the nine sons of [[Jug Bogdan]] ([[Vratko Nemanjić]]), are popular mythological characters of [[Serbian epic poetry]].

'''Khinkali''' ({{lang-ka|ხინკალი}} {{Audio|Khinkali.ogg|listen}}) is a [[Georgian cuisine|Georgian]] [[dumpling]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LohMBqO3nBYC&amp;pg=RA1-PA123&amp;dq=dumplings+(khinkali)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ma9KT9S8D4LY8gPBka2pDg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dumplings%20(khinkali)&amp;f=false The World Cookbook for Students, Volume 1 by Jeanne Jacob, Michael Ashkenazi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3PM_FnWgPBAC&amp;pg=PA144&amp;dq=khinkali+georgian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ALBKT8-6J5PU8QOA9aWzDg&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=khinkali%20georgian&amp;f=false The Georgian Feast: The Vibrant Culture and Savory Food of the Republic of Georgia by Darra Goldstein]&lt;/ref&gt; which originated in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] mountain regions of [[Pshavi]], [[Mtiuleti]] and [[Khevsureti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0aiBhcfgSVcC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22originating+in+khevsureti%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x61KT7ThKJGu8QPPi-WwCw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22originating%20in%20khevsureti%22&amp;f=false Georgia: in the Mountains of Poetry by Peter Nasmyth, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Varieties of khinkali spread from there across different parts of the [[Caucasus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0oXYX9Qzx9oC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=khinkali's&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jKpKT4CILc2S8gPo1oTADg&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=khinkali's&amp;f=false Armenian food: fact, fiction &amp; folklore by Irina Petrosian, David Underwood, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The fillings of khinkali vary with the area. The original recipe, the so-called ''khevsuruli'', consisted of only minced meat (lamb or beef and pork mixed), onions, [[chili pepper]], [[salt]], and [[cumin]]. However, the modern recipe used mostly especially in Georgian urban areas, the so-called ''kalakuri'', uses herbs like [[parsley]] and [[Coriander|cilantro]] (also called coriander). In Muslim-majority areas the use of beef  and lamb is more prevalent. Mushrooms, potatoes, or cheese may be used in place of meat.

Khinkali is eaten plain or with ground [[black pepper]]. The meat filling is uncooked when khinkali is assembled, so when it is cooked, the juices of the meat are trapped inside the dumpling. To make khinkali juicier usually warm water or [[broth]] is added to the minced meat. Khinkali is typically consumed first by sucking the juices while taking the first bite, in order to prevent the dumpling from bursting. The top, where the pleats meet, is tough, and is not supposed to be eaten, but discarded to the plate so that those eating can count how many they have consumed. In Georgia, this top is called the ''kudi'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: ქუდი, "hat") or ''k'uch'i'' ([[Georgian language|Georgian]]: კუჭი, "stomach").

There is a widespread etiquette in Georgia to use only one's bare hands while consuming these dumplings; the using of utensils, like a fork, is considered impolite.

The towns of [[Dusheti]], [[Pasanauri]] and [[Mtskheta]] are particularly famous for their khinkali.

'''Aglaia Kiarina Kordela''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɔːr|ˈ|d|ɛ|l|ə}}; {{lang-el|Αγλαΐα Κιαρίνα Κορδέλα}} {{IPA-el|korˈðela|}}; born July 13, 1963) is a Greek-American [[philosopher]] and [[critical theorist]]. She is a professor of [[German Studies]] and founding director of the Critical Theory Program at [[Macalester College]] in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul, MN]]. She is also Honorary Adjunct Professor at the Writing and Society Research Center, [[University of Western Sydney]], Australia. She writes and teaches on a wide range of topics, notably [[psychoanalysis]], political, literary and [[film theory]], and [[Biopower|biopolitics]].

Her primary approach and focus is on the relation between [[economic system|economic structures]] and [[metaphysics]] in [[secular]] [[capitalist]] [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/academics/criticaltheory/facultystaff/kordela/ |title =A. Kiarina Kordela Faculty Page |website=Macalester College, Critical Theory |accessdate=20 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kordela is known for her reinterpretation of [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Michel Foucault|Foucauldian]] [[biopolitics]] using the work of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]]. Her philosophical inquiries have ramifications for a variety of contemporary social issues and academic fields of study, including [[Postcolonialism|Postcolonial Studies]], [[Critical Race Theory]], [[Critical Terrorism Studies]], [[Comparative Literature]], and [[Film Studies]].

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===

Kordela was born in Patras, Greece to a middle- to lower-class family of Greek and Italian descent. She moved out of her family's home at the age of 18 (far earlier than is traditional Greek custom), studied filmmaking and worked as a stewardess and bartender. At age 23, she began undergraduate studies in the Department of German Language and Literature at the Philosophy School of Athens at the [[National and Kapodistrian University of Athens|University of Athens]]. Having fulfilled her degree requirements a year earlier than stipulated, she received a [[German Academic Exchange Service|DAAD]] scholarship for a year of studies at [[Heidelberg University]], Germany. A similar scenario occurred during her graduate studies: "I eventually went to Cornell where I did my PhD. I had six years of financial support at Cornell, but I finished in four years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://specimenmagazine.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Kiarina-Kordela-for-Specimen.pdf |title= Interview with Kiarina Kordela |website=Specimen Magazine |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

Kordela received her B.A. from [[University of Athens]], Greece and her M.A. from [[University of Pittsburgh]]. She received her Ph.D. from [[Cornell University]] in 1998. Kordela has been teaching at Macalester since 1998.

Professor Kordela teaches regularly courses in English toward both the German major/minor and the Critical Theory concentration, such as the core Critical Theory seminars "Dead White Men," and a series of different topics seminars, such as "Metaphysics in Secular Thought," "German-French Dialogues in Critical Theory," Value" (a course on aesthetic theory, in its relation to economic and ethical values), ” "Modernity and the Unconscious," "Modernism-Postmodernism," "A Kafkaesque Century," “Philosophy, Literature, Film,” as well as courses on film theory.

== Overview of works ==

=== ''$urplus'' (2007) ===

In 2007, Kordela published ''$urplus: Spinoza, Lacan'', wherein she maintains that the work of [[Psychoanalysis|Psychoanalyst]] [[Jacques Lacan]] is the correct continuation of thought that runs through Spinoza and Marx.&lt;ref&gt;Kordela, A. Kiarina. 2007. ''$urplus''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press. 2. {{ISBN|0791470199}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that this line of thought entails a radical reconceptualization of Being or appearance,&lt;ref&gt;Kunkle, Sheila. "Review: $urplus: Spinoza, Lacan." ''Rethinking Marxism: A Journal of Economics, Culture and Society'' 22.1 (2010): pp. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; and further, that this new ontology works "not simply to overturn the Platonic hierarchy but collapses it as obsolete."&lt;ref&gt;Kordela, A. Kiarina. 2007. ''$urplus''. Albany, NY: SUNY Press. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kordela challenges certain interpretations of Spinoza (namely, those of [[Jonathan Israel]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Antonio Negri]], and [[Michael Hardt]]). Although Kordela criticizes these readings of Spinoza, she also argues that popular criticisms of neo-spinozism (e.g. those of [[Slavoj Žižek]] and [[Alain Badiou]]) make the same mistake as those they criticize — both sides ignore the inherent contradictions of Spinoza's work. One of those contradictions, which is central to Kordela analysis of Spinoza and her allegiance to his monism, is his statement that "truth is the standard both of itself and the false."&lt;ref&gt;Spinoza, Baruch (Benedict de). 1992. ''Ethics''. Transl. Samuel Shirley. Ed. Seymoir Feldman. Indianapolis, IN: Hackett Publishing Company, Inc. Print. Part II, Prop. 43, Scholium 1. pp. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Kordela argues that this ternary concept of truth — truth, itself and the false — reveals Spinoza's break with the binaries of both Platonism and anti-Platonism. Kordela shows that this ternary structure corresponds to Lacan's argument that truth has the structure of a fiction.&lt;ref&gt;Lacan, Jacques. 2002. ''Écrits: A Selection.'' Transl. Bruce Fink. New York, NY: W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc. Print. pp. 684.&lt;/ref&gt;
Kordela traces the emergence of “enjoyment” and “the gaze” out of Spinoza’s theories of God, truth, and causality, Kant’s critique of pure reason, and, drawing on [[Kojin Karatani]], Marx’s pathbreaking application of set theory to economy. The main achievement of ''$urplus'' is to move away from the logical impasse of Kant's critique of reason to Lacan's and Marx's theories of surplus by way of set theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kunkle, Sheila. "Review: $urplus: Spinoza, Lacan." ''Rethinking Marxism: A Journal of Economics, Culture and Society'' 22.1 (2010): pp. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Being, Time, Bios'' (2013) ===

Although both share a focus on human life as it is inscribed by power, Foucauldian biopolitics and Lacanian psychoanalysis have remained isolated from and even opposed to one another. In ''Being, Time, Bios'', A. Kiarina Kordela aims to overcome this divide, formulating a historical ontology that draws from Spinoza, Marx, Heidegger, and Sartre to theorize the changed character of being and time under secular capitalism. With insights from film theory, postcolonial studies, and race theory, Kordela s wide-ranging analysis suggests a radically new understanding of contemporary capitalism one in which uncertainty, sacrifice, immortality, and the gaze are central.

== Publications ==

Early ''Kōrikoppu'' could be found by the end of the [[Meiji period]] (1868–1912), and individual texture patterns using a technique of aburidashi (a technique of glass-works that motifs come to the surface by difference in temperature) were developed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=INOUE|first=Akiko|title=About Kōrikoppu using a technique of aburidashi "The Japanese Glass-Vidro, diamante, glass, from the Edo period to the Meiji, Taisho era"|url=http://www.city.kobe.lg.jp/culture/culture/institution/museum/tokuten/told72.html|year=2000|publisher=Kobe City Museum|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; until the beginning of the [[Shōwa period]] (1926–1989).

[[File:Barbegal mill 02.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Barbegal|Barbegal mill]], located on a steep slope in southern France, is considered the biggest [[ancient history|ancient]] mill complex. Its capacity was sufficient to feed the whole nearby city of [[Arles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greene|2000|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Römische Sägemühle.svg|thumb|250px|Scheme of a water-driven [[Hierapolis sawmill|Roman sawmill at Hierapolis]], Asia Minor. The 3rd century mill is the earliest known machine to incorporate a [[Crank (mechanism)|crank]] and [[connecting rod]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Ritti, Grewe, Kessener 2000, 161"/&gt;]]

This '''list of ancient watermills''' presents an overview of water-powered [[grain-mill]]s and industrial mills in the [[classical antiquity]] from their [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] beginnings through the [[Roman Empire|Roman imperial]] period.

== Historical overview ==
The [[watermill]] is the earliest instance of a machine harnessing natural forces to replace human muscular labour (apart from the [[sail]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilson|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such it holds a special place in the [[history of technology]] and also in economic studies where it is associated with growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|p=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial invention of the watermill appears to have occurred in the [[Hellenistic civilization|hellenized eastern Mediterranean]] in the wake of the [[conquests of Alexander the Great]] and the rise of [[History of science in Classical Antiquity#Hellenistic period|Hellenistic science and technology]].&lt;ref name="invention"/&gt; In the subsequent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era, the use of water-power was diversified and different types of watermills were introduced. These include all three variants of the vertical [[water wheel]] as well as the horizontal water wheel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=373–378}}; {{harvnb|Donners|Waelkens|Deckers|2002|pp=12–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its main use in grinding flour, water-power was also applied to pounding grain,&lt;ref name="Trip hammer"/&gt; crushing ore,&lt;ref name="Wikander 2000b, 407"/&gt; sawing stones&lt;ref name="Sawmill"/&gt; and possibly fulling and bellows for iron furnaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000b|pp=406f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An increased research interest has greatly improved our knowledge of Roman watermill sites in recent years. Numerous archaeological finds in the western half of the empire now complement the surviving documentary material from the eastern provinces; they demonstrate that the breakthrough of watermill technology occurred as early as the 1st century AD and was not delayed until the onset of the [[Middle Ages]] as previously thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|pp=151–154}}; {{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=370–373}}; {{harvnb|Wilson|2002|pp=9–17}}; {{harvnb|Brun|2006|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data shows a wide spread of grain-mills over most parts of the empire, with industrial mills also being in evidence in both halves.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|pp=397–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the prevalence of grain-mills naturally meant that watermilling remained a typically rural phenomenon, it also rose in importance in the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|p=379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The data below spans the period until ca. 500 AD. The vast majority dates to Roman times.

== Earliest evidence ==
Below the earliest ancient evidence for different types of watermills and the use of water-power for various industrial processes. Note: The Perachora watermill, near Loutraki, in Greece, is not included; it is considered the earliest watermill with physical remains. This list is continued for the early Middle Ages [[List of early medieval watermills#Earliest evidence|here]].

=== Millstones ===
The following list comprises stray finds of ancient [[millstones]]. Note that there is no way to distinguish millstones driven by water-power from those powered by animals turning a [[Capstan (nautical)|capstan]]. Most, however, are assumed to derive from watermills.&lt;ref name="Wikander 2000a, 372"&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000a|p=372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Water wheels and other components ===
Although more rare than the massive millstones, finds of wooden and iron parts of the mill machinery can also point to the existence of ancient watermills.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|1985|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large stone mortars have been found at many mines; their deformations suggest automated [[Stamp mill|crushing mills]] worked by water wheels.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnham|1997|pp=332–336}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ohm's acoustic law''', sometimes called the '''acoustic phase law''' or simply '''Ohm's law''', states that a [[music]]al [[sound]] is perceived by the [[ear]] as a set of a number of constituent pure [[harmonic oscillation|harmonic]] tones.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm's law, ''n''.2, ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', 2nd ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Text-book of Physics | author = A. Wilmer Duff, editor | year = 1912 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U_EzAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA530&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA529,M1 | publisher =  P. Blakiston's Son &amp; Co | location=Philadelphia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law was proposed by physicist [[Georg Ohm]] in 1843.&lt;ref&gt;Ohm, G., ''Annalen der Physik'' (1843) 59 513&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] elaborated the law into what is often today known as Ohm's acoustic law, by adding that the quality of a tone depends solely on the number and relative strength of its partial simple tones, and not on their relative phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Science of Musical Sounds | author = Dayton Clarence Miller | publisher = The Macmillan Company | year = 1916 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7f8KAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Lessons in Elementary Practical Physics, Vol. III, Part 1: Practical Acoustics | author = Charles Lightfoot Barnes | publisher = London: Macmillan and Co. Ltd | year = 1897 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6TQIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA160&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA161,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Helmholtz championed the law in opposition to contrary evidence expounded by [[August Seebeck]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Combination Tones and Other Related Auditory Phenomena | publisher = University of Chicago | year = 1908 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=BUEIAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=ohm+tone+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=1&amp;ei=MguHR5ipHpnOtAPuwYDABw#PPA128,M1 | author = Joseph Peterson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law has also been interpreted as "a pitch corresponding to a certain frequency can only be heard if the acoustical wave contains power at that frequency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Acoustics and psychoacoustics | author = David M. Howard, Jamie A. S. Angus | publisher = Focal Press | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-240-51995-1 | page = 123 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyk5nAIJcBcC&amp;pg=PA122&amp;dq=intitle:Acoustics+intitle:and+intitle:Psychoacoustics+ohm+law&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=0&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES&amp;ei=5bxlSby6B5CQkQSJlpznAQ#PPA123,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are true to the extent that the ear is sensitive to the frequency and amplitude of the acoustic waves, and further, is able to resolve the differences in their frequency. In modern times, the sensitivity of human [[hearing (sense)|hearing]] to the phase of tone components has been extensively investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Loudspeaker and Headphone Handbook | author = John Borwick | publisher = Focal Press | isbn = 0-240-51578-1 | year = 2001 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=pAOFt1znYr8C&amp;pg=PA655&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+acoustic+phase&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;ei=NAiHR_CaNp6ktgP_i4zQBQ&amp;sig=1OIFUWDCMTIUILOZrnaa5j3ef9M#PPA655,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Controversy has led to this characterization:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =  Foundations of Modern Auditory Theory | editor = Jerry V. Tobias | publisher = Academic Press | volume = 1 | author = W. Dixon Ward | chapter = Musical Perception |year = 1970 | page = 438}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For years musicians have been told that the ear is able to separate any complex signal into a series of sinusoidal signals – that it acts as a [[Fourier analysis|Fourier analyzer]].  This quarter-truth, known as Ohm's Other Law, has served to increase the distrust with which perceptive musicians regard scientists, since it is readily apparent to them that the ear acts in this way only under very restricted conditions.|W. Dixon Ward (1970)}}

[[File:Owle Schreame Award Skull.jpg|thumb|The engraved glass skull of the Owle Schreame Award]]

The '''Owle Schreame Awards''' were 2014 theatrical awards honouring innovation in classical theatre. They were awarded by [[Brice Stratford]] and his Owle Schreame theatre company in 2014 to commemorate the 450th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth.&lt;ref&gt;Hemley, Matthew. [http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/2014/07/new-awards-launched-honour-classical-theatre/ "New Awards Launched to Honour Classical Theatre"]. ''[[The Stage]]''. 30 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The award itself was an engraved glass skull, in reference to the famous graveyard scene in Shakespeare's ''[[Hamlet]]''. Thirteen were awarded, and the award speeches were published.&lt;ref&gt;Interview: "[http://www.offwestend.com/index.php/news/view/199 BRICE STRATFORD talks to us about THE OWLE SCHREAME AWARDS of engraved glass skulls...]" OffWestEnd.com, (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; The awards covered all forms of historical theatrical performance.&lt;ref&gt;Rigg, Kate ''[http://theculturetrip.com/europe/united-kingdom/articles/5-reasons-to-follow-the-owle-schreame-theatre-company | 5 Reasons to Follow the Owle Schreame Theatre Company]'', "The Culture Trip", (March 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers''''' were first published by the [[Institution of Mechanical Engineers]] (IMechE) in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Journals of the Century|first=Tony|last=Stankus|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7890-1134-3|page=378|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O-1qrN9FlYoC&amp;pg=PA378}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Proceedings'' were published under this single title until 1963, when they began to be published in two parts. The ''Proceedings'' have since expanded further, in part by incorporating four journals previously published separately: the ''Proceedings of the Institution of Automobile Engineers'' (in 1971), the ''Journal of the Institution of Locomotive Engineers'' (in 1971), the ''Journal of Mechanical Engineering Science'' (in 1983) and ''Engineering in Medicine'' (in 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://public.metapress.com/download/profiles/imeche/IMechE_Timeline7.pdf |title=IMechE publications timeline on IMechE Proceedings Archive website |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sixteen individual parts now make up the ''Proceedings'', as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uksagepub.com/imeche |title=IMechE details on SAGE Publications website |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[SAGE Publications]] began publishing the Institution's journals on behalf of the IMechE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/press/2010/september/23_sep.sp |title=IMechE-SAGE Publications press release |year=2011 |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abstracting and indexing ==
As of May 2011, 14 of the journals that make up the ''Proceedings'' were included in the ''[[Journal Citation Reports]]''.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2011 |chapter=Journals Ranked by Impact: Engineering, Mechanical |title=2010 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science |accessdate=2011-07-23 |work=Web of Science |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scopitone''' is a type of [[jukebox]] featuring a [[16 mm film]] component.  Scopitone films were a forerunner of [[music video]]s. The Italian [[Cinebox]]/Colorama and Color-Sonics were competing, lesser-known technologies of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scopitonearchive.com/cinebox/index.html|title=Scopitone Archive: Cinebox/Colorama/Cinejukebox|website=Scopitonearchive.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on [[Soundies]] technology developed during [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stim.com/Stim-x/9.4/scopitone/scopitone-09.4.html|title=Le Scopitone!|website=Stim.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; color [[16 mm film]] clips with a magnetic [[soundtrack]] were designed to be shown in a specially designed jukebox. The main difference between these and the earlier Soundies and [[Snader Telescriptions|Telescriptions]] was the fact that like all modern music videos, all Scopitones featured lip-sync to a pre-recorded track.

Between 1940 and 1946, three-minute musical films called Soundies (produced in [[New York City]], [[Chicago]] and [[Hollywood]]) were displayed on a [[Panoram]], the first coin-operated film jukebox or ''machine music''. These were set up in nightclubs, bars, restaurants and amusement centers.

==History==
The first Scopitones were made in France, by a company called [[Cameca]] on Blvd Saint Denis in Courbevoie, among them [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s "Le poinçonneur des Lilas" (filmed in 1958 in the [[Porte des Lilas (Paris Métro)|Porte des Lilas Métro station]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forumdesimages.net/fr/alacarte/htm/ACTUALITE/GAINSBOURG.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051120123449/http://www.forumdesimages.net/fr/alacarte/htm/ACTUALITE/GAINSBOURG.htm |archive-date=2005-11-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johnny Hallyday]]'s "Noir c'est noir" (a cover of [[Los Bravos]]' "[[Black Is Black]]") and the "[[Hully Gully]]" showing a dance around a swimming pool.

Scopitones spread to [[West Germany]], where the [[Kessler Twins|Kessler Sisters]] burst out of twin steamer trunks to sing "Quando Quando" on the dim screen that surmounted the jukebox. Scopitone went on to appear in bars in [[England]], including a coffee bar in [[Swanage]] where "[[Telstar (song)|Telstar]]" was a favourite. By 1964, approximately 500 machines were installed in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.loti.com/fifties_jukebox/Scoptione_The_Visual_Jukebox.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-05-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605070925/http://www.loti.com/fifties_jukebox/Scoptione_The_Visual_Jukebox.htm |archive-date=2008-06-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1966, reportedly 800 machines were installed in bars and nightclubs in the US, at a cost of $3500 apiece.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{citation |title=Cinema Juke Box: Just a Novelty? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UykEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48&amp;lpg=PA48&amp;dq=cinema+juke+box:+just+a+novelty?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Y8qYox1yRZ&amp;sig=wAl6yCm-w8y5owNccYsu0nnthss&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_FKbUK7aJaXmiwK15oHgDQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=cinema%20juke%20box%3A%20just%20a%20novelty%3F&amp;f=false |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |first1=Ray |last1=Brack|page=48 |date=July 10, 1965 |accessdate=November 7, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known acts of the 1960s appear in Scopitone films, ranging from the earlier part of the decade [[The Exciters]] ("[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]") and [[Neil Sedaka]] ("Calendar Girl") to [[Bobby Vee]] ("[[The Night Has a Thousand Eyes (song)|The Night Has a Thousand Eyes]]" and "[[Baby Face (1926 song)|Baby Face]]") and [[Procol Harum]] ("[[A Whiter Shade of Pale]]") later on. In one Scopitone recording, [[Dionne Warwick]] lay on a white shag rug with an offstage fan urging her to sing "[[Walk On By (song)|Walk On By]]". Another had [[Nancy Sinatra]] and a troupe of go-go girls shimmy to "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]". Inspired by [[burlesque]], [[bombshell (sex symbol)|blonde bombshell]] [[Joi Lansing]] performed "Web of Love" and "The Silencer", and [[Julie London]] sang "Daddy" against a backdrop of strippers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Vt-xeVrI3c|title=Daddy by Julie London|date=18 July 2006|accessdate=2 August 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artifice of such scenes led [[Susan Sontag]] to identify Scopitone films as "part of the canon of [[Camp (style)|Camp]]" in her 1964 essay "[[Notes on 'Camp']]".

The medium's inability to lure the superstar [[British Invasion]] acts of the era was a factor in its demise,&lt;ref name="AVCLUB"&gt;{{citation |title=Let's all watch the Scopitone! 15 never-too-popular obsolete entertainment formats |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/lets-all-watch-the-scopitone-15-nevertoopopular-ob,57012/ |publisher=[[The A.V.

Several sources claim that [[The Back Porch Majority]] film for ''Mighty Mississippi'' from their album ''Riverboat Days'' (1964) was equally instrumental in bringing down the format for its so-called indecency. Against the wishes of the group and its producer [[Randy Sparks]] scenes of girls in 19th century period dress hiking up their [[hoop skirt]]s were inserted into the performance. By the time protests could be raised and the offending material excised, the film had already gone out.

Even though the popularity of the Scopitone had faded away by the end of the 1960s,&lt;ref name="AVCLUB" /&gt;the same concept was still in limited use throughout the 1970s by acts such as the [[The Carpenters|Carpenters]] and [[ABBA]] both of whose early productions were shot on 16mm film before transitioning to [[videotape]]. The last official film for a Scopitone was made at the end of 1978. 

In 2006, French singer [[Mareva Galanter]] released several videos which mimic the Scopitone style. Galenta's album ''Ukuyéyé'' features several songs in the French [[Yé-yé]] style. She also recently hosted a weekly French television program called "Do you do you Scopitone" on the [[Paris Première]] channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paris-premiere.fr/cms/display.jsp?id=p2_802761|title=6play : Replay Paris Première et direct des émissions et séries|website=Paris-premiere.fr|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, a selection of Scopitones was screened at the Jewel Box theater in [[Seattle]] by [[Dennis Nyback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moviemorlocks.com/2010/07/01/scopitone-a-go-go/|title=Scopitone A Go-Go|website=Moviemorlocks.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scopitones.blogs.com/scopitonescom/2010/12/the-day-i-discovered-scopitones-with-jack-stevenson-dennis-nyback-films.html|title=Scopitones.com: The Day I Discovered Scopitones With Jack Stevenson - Dennis Nyback Films|website=Scopitones.blogs.com|accessdate=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2012, one of the few Scopitones not in a museum or private collection in the United States is at [[Third Man Records]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.tennessean.com/tunein/2012/11/20/third-man-records-opens-novelties-lounge-on-black-friday/?repeat=w3tc "Third Man Records opens ‘Novelties Lounge’ on Black Friday"], ''[[The Tennessean]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Many Scopitone films have been released on [[DVD]] or made available on the [[internet]].&lt;ref name="AVCLUB" /&gt;

'''Singing''' is the act of producing [[music]]al sounds with the [[human voice|voice]] and augments regular [[speech]] by the use of sustained [[tonality]], [[rhythm]], and a variety of vocal techniques. A person who sings is called a '''singer''' or '''vocalist''' (in [[jazz]] and [[popular music]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vocalist ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/us/vocalist | title=Vocalist &amp;#124; Definition of vocalist in US English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singers perform music ([[aria]]s, [[recitative]]s, [[song]]s, etc.) that can be sung [[accompaniment|with]] or [[a cappella|without accompaniment]] by [[musical instrument]]s. Singing is often done in an [[ensemble (music)|ensemble]] of musicians, such as a [[choir]] of singers or a band of instrumentalists. Singers may perform as soloists or accompanied by anything from a single instrument (as in [[art song]] or some [[jazz]] styles) up to a [[symphony orchestra]] or [[big band]]. Different singing styles include [[art music]] such as [[opera]] and [[Chinese opera]], [[Hindustani classical music|Indian music]] and [[religious music]] styles such as [[Gospel music|gospel]], [[traditional music]] styles, [[world music]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[gazal]] and popular music styles such as [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[electronic dance music]] and [[filmi]] (film songs).

Singing can be formal or informal, arranged or improvised. It may be done as a form of religious devotion, as a hobby, as a source of pleasure, comfort or ritual, as part of [[music education]] or as a profession. Excellence in singing requires time, dedication, instruction and regular [[practice (learning method)|practice]]. If practice is done on a regular basis then the sounds can become more clear and strong.&lt;ref name="Musicguides"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professional singers usually build their [[career]]s around one specific [[musical genre]], such as [[Classical music|classical]] or [[Rock music|rock]], although there are singers with crossover success (singing in more than one genre). They typically take [[vocal pedagogy|voice training]] provided by voice teachers or [[vocal coach]]es throughout their careers.

[[File:Gray1204.png|right|upright=1.35|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords]]

In its physical aspect, singing has a well-defined technique that depends on the use of the lungs, which act as an air supply or [[bellows]]; on the [[larynx]], which acts as a [[reed (instrument)|reed]] or [[Vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]]; on the [[chest]], head cavities and skeleton, which have the function of an [[amplifier]], as the tube in a [[wind instrument]]; and on the [[tongue]], which together with the [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[lip]]s articulate and impose [[consonant]]s and [[vowel]]s on the amplified sound. Though these four mechanisms function independently, they are nevertheless coordinated in the establishment of a [[vocal technique]] and are made to interact upon one another.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During passive breathing, air is inhaled with the [[diaphragm (anatomy)|diaphragm]] while exhalation occurs without any effort. Exhalation may be aided by the [[abdominal]], [[internal intercostal]] and lower pelvis/pelvic muscles. Inhalation is aided by use of [[external intercostals]], [[scalenes]], and [[sternocleidomastoid muscles]]. The [[pitch (music)|pitch]] is altered with the [[vocal cords]]. With the lips closed, this is called [[humming]].

The sound of each individual's singing voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's [[vocal cords]] but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body. Humans have vocal folds which can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of the [[chest]] and [[neck]], the position of the [[tongue]], and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in [[Pitch (music)|pitch]], volume ([[loudness]]), [[timbre]], or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body and an individual's size and bone structure can affect the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name="Vennard"&gt;polka dots

===Vocal registration===
{{Main|Vocal registration}}
{{Vocal registration}}

''Vocal registration'' refers to the system of vocal registers within the voice. A register in the voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal fold]]s, and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in [[larynx|laryngeal]] function. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular [[Vocal range|range]] of [[Pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name="Large"&gt;

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"&gt;

* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process (phonation is the process of producing vocal sound by the vibration of the vocal folds that is in turn modified by the resonance of the vocal tract)
* A certain vocal [[timbre]] or vocal "color"
* A region of the voice which is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language which combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system. Within [[speech pathology]], the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogues.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

=== Vocal resonation ===
{{Main|Vocal resonation}}
[[File:Illu01 head neck.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of the head and neck]]

'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation, although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; There are seven areas that may be listed as possible vocal resonators. In sequence from the lowest within the body to the highest, these areas are the [[chest]], the [[Vertebrate trachea|tracheal tree]], the [[larynx]] itself, the [[human pharynx|pharynx]], the [[human oral cavity|oral cavity]], the [[nasal cavity]], and the [[sinuses]].&lt;ref name="Greene2001"&gt;

===Chest voice and head voice===
{{Main|Chest voice|Head voice}}

''Chest voice'' and ''head voice'' are terms used within [[vocal music]]. The use of these terms varies widely within vocal pedagogical circles and there is currently no one consistent opinion among vocal music professionals in regards to these terms. Chest voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]]; a [[vocal resonance]] area; or a specific vocal timbre.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; Head voice can be used in relation to a particular part of the [[vocal range]] or type of [[vocal register]] or a [[vocal resonance]] area.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994"/&gt; In Men, the head voice is commonly referred to as the falsetto.

====History and development====
The first recorded mention of the terms chest voice and head voice was around the 13th century, when it was distinguished from the "throat voice" (pectoris, guttoris, capitis—at this time it is likely that head voice referred to the [[falsetto register]]) by the writers [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]] and [[Jerome of Moravia]].&lt;ref name="groveONE"&gt;

Another current popular approach that is based on the bel canto model is to divide both men and women's voices into three registers. Men's voices are divided into "chest register", "head register", and "falsetto register" and woman's voices into "chest register", "middle register", and "head register". Such pedagogists teach that the head register is a [[vocal]] technique used in singing to describe the resonance felt in the singer's head.&lt;ref name="Headv"&gt;

However, as knowledge of physiology has increased over the past two hundred years, so has the understanding of the physical process of singing and vocal production. As a result, many vocal pedagogists, such as Ralph Appelman at [[Indiana University]] and [[William Vennard]] at the [[University of Southern California]], have redefined or even abandoned the use of the terms chest voice and head voice.&lt;ref name=Stark /&gt; In particular, the use of the terms ''chest register'' and ''head register'' have become controversial since [[vocal registration]] is more commonly seen today as a product of [[Larynx|laryngeal]] function that is unrelated to the physiology of the chest, lungs, and head. For this reason, many vocal pedagogists argue that it is meaningless to speak of registers being produced in the chest or head. They argue that the vibratory sensations which are felt in these areas are resonance phenomena and should be described in terms related to [[vocal resonance]], not to registers. These vocal pedagogists prefer the terms ''chest voice'' and ''head voice'' over the term register. This view believes that the problems which people identify as register problems are really problems of resonance adjustment. This view is also in alignment with the views of other academic fields that study vocal registration including [[speech pathology]], [[phonetics]], and [[linguistics]]. Although both methods are still in use, current vocal pedagogical practice tends to adopt the newer more scientific view. Also, some vocal pedagogists take ideas from both viewpoints.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

The contemporary use of the term chest voice often refers to a specific kind of vocal coloration or vocal timbre. In classical singing, its use is limited entirely to the lower part of the [[modal register]] or normal voice. Within other forms of singing, chest voice is often applied throughout the [[modal register]]. Chest timbre can add a wonderful array of sounds to a singer's vocal interpretive palette.&lt;ref name="Miller"&gt;

However, the use of overly strong chest voice in the higher registers in an attempt to hit higher notes in the chest can lead to forcing. Forcing can lead consequently to vocal deterioration.&lt;ref name="oxfordDictOperaOne"&gt;

===Classifying singing voices===
{{Main|Voice type|Voice classification in non-classical music}}
{{Vocal range}}

In [[European classical music]] and [[opera]], voices are treated like [[musical instrument]]s. [[Composers]] who write vocal music must have an understanding of the skills, talents, and vocal properties of singers. '''Voice classification''' is the process by which human singing voices are evaluated and are thereby designated into [[voice types]]. These qualities include but are not limited to [[vocal range]], [[vocal weight]], [[vocal tessitura]], vocal [[timbre]], and [[vocal transition points]] such as breaks and lifts within the voice. Other considerations are physical characteristics, speech level, scientific testing, and [[vocal registration]].&lt;ref name="Shewan"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science behind voice classification developed within European [[classical music]] has been slow in adapting to more modern forms of singing. Voice classification is often used within [[opera]] to associate possible roles with potential voices. There are currently several different systems in use within classical music including the German ''[[Fach]]'' system and the choral music system among many others. No system is universally applied or accepted.&lt;ref name="Stark"&gt;

However, most classical music systems acknowledge seven different major voice categories. Women are typically divided into three groups: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men are usually divided into four groups: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. When considering voices of pre-pubescent children an eighth term, [[Boy soprano|treble]], can be applied. Within each of these major categories, there are several sub-categories that identify specific vocal qualities like [[coloratura]] facility and [[vocal weight]] to differentiate between voices.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

Within [[choral music]], singers' voices are divided solely on the basis of [[vocal range]]. Choral music most commonly divides vocal parts into high and low voices within each sex (SATB, or soprano, alto, tenor, and bass). As a result, the typical choral situation gives many opportunities for misclassification to occur.&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; Since most people have medium voices, they must be assigned to a part that is either too high or too low for them; the mezzo-soprano must sing soprano or alto and the baritone must sing tenor or bass. Either option can present problems for the singer, but for most singers, there are fewer dangers in singing too low than in singing too high.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;

Within contemporary forms of music (sometimes referred to as [[contemporary commercial music]]), singers are classified by the [[music style|style of music]] they sing, such as jazz, pop, blues, soul, country, folk, and rock styles. There is currently no authoritative voice classification system within non-classical music. Attempts have been made to adopt classical voice type terms to other forms of singing but such attempts have been met with controversy.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Vocal pedagogy''' is the study of the teaching of singing. The art and science of vocal pedagogy has a long history that began in [[Ancient Greece]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Greek_Music/|title=Ancient Greek Music|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continues to develop and change today. Professions that practice the art and science of vocal pedagogy include [[vocal coaches]], [[choral music|choral directors]], [[Music education|vocal music educators]], [[List of opera directors|opera directors]], and other teachers of singing.

Vocal pedagogy concepts are a part of developing proper [[vocal technique]]. Typical areas of study include the following:&lt;ref name="Titze2008"&gt;

===Vocal technique===
[[File:Morphometric-Differences-of-Vocal-Tract-Articulators-in-Different-Loudness-Conditions-in-Singing-pone.0153792.s004.ogv|thumb|[[Real-time MRI]] of a [[vocal tract]] while singing.]]

Singing when done with proper vocal technique is an integrated and coordinated act that effectively coordinates the physical processes of singing. There are four physical processes involved in producing vocal sound: [[Breathing|respiration]], [[phonation]], [[vocal resonation|resonation]], and [[Place of articulation|articulation]]. These processes occur in the following sequence:
# Breath is taken
# Sound is initiated in the [[larynx]]
# The vocal resonators receive the sound and influence it
# The articulators shape the sound into recognizable units
Although these four processes are often considered separately when studied, in actual practice, they merge into one coordinated function. With an effective singer or speaker, one should rarely be reminded of the process involved as their mind and body are so coordinated that one only perceives the resulting unified function. Many vocal problems result from a lack of coordination within this process.&lt;ref name="Appelman"/&gt;

Since singing is a coordinated act, it is difficult to discuss any of the individual technical areas and processes without relating them to the others. For example, phonation only comes into perspective when it is connected with respiration; the articulators affect resonance; the resonators affect the vocal folds; the vocal folds affect breath control; and so forth. Vocal problems are often a result of a breakdown in one part of this coordinated process which causes voice teachers to frequently focus in intensively on one area of the process with their student until that issue is resolved. However, some areas of the art of singing are so much the result of coordinated functions that it is hard to discuss them under a traditional heading like phonation, resonation, articulation, or respiration.

Once the voice student has become aware of the physical processes that make up the act of singing and of how those processes function, the student begins the task of trying to coordinate them. Inevitably, students and teachers will become more concerned with one area of the technique than another. The various processes may progress at different rates, with a resulting imbalance or lack of coordination. The areas of vocal technique which seem to depend most strongly on the student's ability to coordinate various functions are:&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;
:
# Extending the [[vocal range]] to its maximum potential
# Developing consistent vocal production with a consistent tone quality
# Developing flexibility and agility
# Achieving a balanced [[vibrato]]

====Developing the singing voice====
Singing is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Vocal exercises have several purposes, including&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt; warming up the voice; extending the vocal range; "lining up" the voice horizontally and vertically; and acquiring vocal techniques such as legato, staccato, control of dynamics, rapid figurations, learning to sing wide intervals comfortably, singing trills, singing melismas and correcting vocal faults.

Vocal pedagogists instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should be thinking constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.&lt;ref name="Appelman" /&gt;

Learning to sing is an activity that benefits from the involvement of an instructor. A singer does not hear the same sounds inside his head that others hear outside. Therefore, having a wise guide who can tell a student what kinds of sounds he or she is producing guides a singer to understand which of the internal sounds correspond to the desired sounds required by the style of singing the student aims to re-create.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Extending vocal range===
An important goal of vocal development is to learn to sing to the natural limits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How much can a singer sing before they reach their limits? May 16, 2014, from |url=http://howikis.com/How_much_can_a_singer_sing_before_they_reach_their_limit}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's vocal range without any obvious or distracting changes of quality or technique. Vocal pedagogists teach that a singer can only achieve this goal when all of the physical processes involved in singing (such as laryngeal action, breath support, resonance adjustment, and articulatory movement) are effectively working together. Most vocal pedagogists believe in coordinating these processes by (1) establishing good vocal habits in the most comfortable tessitura of the voice, and then (2) slowly expanding the range.&lt;ref name=Vennard/&gt;

There are three factors that significantly affect the ability to sing higher or lower:

# The ''energy'' factor – "energy" has several connotations. It refers to the total response of the body to the making of sound; to a dynamic relationship between the breathing-in muscles and the breathing-out muscles known as the breath support mechanism; to the amount of breath pressure delivered to the vocal folds and their resistance to that pressure; and to the dynamic level of the sound.
# The ''space'' factor – "space" refers to the size of the inside of the mouth and the position of the palate and larynx. Generally speaking, a singer's mouth should be opened wider the higher he or she sings. The internal space or position of the soft palate and larynx can be widened by relaxing the throat. Vocal pedagogists describe this as feeling like the "beginning of a yawn".
# The ''depth'' factor – "depth" has two connotations. It refers to the actual physical sensations of depth in the body and vocal mechanism, and to mental concepts of depth that are related to tone quality.

McKinney says, "These three factors can be expressed in three basic rules: (1) As you sing higher, you must use more energy; as you sing lower, you must use less. (2) As you sing higher, you must use more space; as you sing lower, you must use less. (3) As you sing higher, you must use more depth; as you sing lower, you must use less."&lt;ref name="McKinney 1994" /&gt;

===Posture===
The singing process functions best when certain physical conditions of the body are put in place. The ability to move air in and out of the body freely and to obtain the needed quantity of air can be seriously affected by the posture of the various parts of the breathing mechanism. A sunken chest position will limit the capacity of the lungs, and a tense abdominal wall will inhibit the downward travel of the diaphragm. Good posture allows the breathing mechanism to fulfill its basic function efficiently without any undue expenditure of energy. Good posture also makes it easier to initiate phonation and to tune the resonators as proper alignment prevents unnecessary tension in the body. Vocal pedagogists have also noted that when singers assume good posture it often provides them with a greater sense of self-assurance and poise while performing. Audiences also tend to respond better to singers with good posture. Habitual good posture also ultimately improves the overall health of the body by enabling better blood circulation and preventing fatigue and stress on the body.&lt;ref name="Vennard"/&gt;

There are eight components of the ideal singing posture:

# Feet slightly apart
# Legs straight but knees slightly bent
# Hips facing straight forward
# Spine aligned
# Abdomen flat
# Chest comfortably forward
# Shoulders down and back
# Head facing straight forward

===Breathing and breath support===
Natural breathing has three stages: a breathing-in period, a breathing out period, and a resting or recovery period; these stages are not usually consciously controlled. Within singing, there are four stages of breathing: a breathing-in period (inhalation); a setting up controls period (suspension); a controlled exhalation period (phonation); and a recovery period.

These stages must be under conscious control by the singer until they become conditioned reflexes. Many singers abandon conscious controls before their reflexes are fully conditioned which ultimately leads to chronic vocal problems.&lt;ref name=Sundberg&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibrato===
[[Vibrato]] is a technique in which a sustained note wavers very quickly and consistently between a higher and a lower pitch, giving the note a slight quaver. Vibrato is the pulse or wave in a sustained tone. Vibrato occurs naturally and is the result of proper breath support and a relaxed vocal apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Idiot's Guide to Singing|page=64|author=Phyllis Fulford|author2=Michael Miller |year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown that vibrato is the result of a neuromuscular tremor in the vocal folds. In 1922 Max Schoen was the first to make the comparison of vibrato to a tremor due to change in amplitude, lack of automatic control and it being half the rate of normal muscular discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rVFQdViY7jAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=max+schoen+vibrato+neuro+muscular+tremor#v=onepage&amp;q=max%20schoen%20vibrato%20neuro%20muscular%20tremor&amp;f=false|title=Bel Canto: A History of Vocal Pedagogy|last=Stark|first=James|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=978-0802086143|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some singers use vibrato as a means of expression. Many successful artists can sing a deep, rich vibrato.

===[[Extended vocal technique]]===

==Vocal music==
{{Main|Vocal music}}
'''Vocal music''' is [[music]] performed by one or more singers, which are typically called [[song]]s, and which may be performed with or without [[musical instruments|instrumental]] accompaniment, in which singing provides the main focus of the piece. Vocal music is probably the oldest form of music since it does not require any instrument or equipment besides the voice. All musical [[culture]]s have some form of vocal music and there are many long-standing singing traditions throughout the world's cultures.Music which employs singing but does not feature it prominently is generally considered as instrumental music. For example, some [[blues rock]] songs may have a short, simple call-and-response chorus, but the emphasis in the song is on the instrumental melodies and improvisation. Vocal music typically features sung words called [[lyrics]], although there are notable examples of vocal music that are performed using non-linguistic syllables or noises, sometimes as musical [[onomatopoeia]]. A short piece of vocal music with lyrics is broadly termed a [[song]], although, in [[classical music]], terms such as [[aria]] are typically used.

===Genres of vocal music===
{{Main|Music genre}}
[[File:Divine trio 2016.jpg|thumb|A trio of female singers performing at the [[Berwaldhallen|Berwald Hall]] in 2016.]]
Vocal music is written in many different forms and styles which are often labeled within a particular genre of music. These genres include [[Hindustani classical music|Indian classical music]], [[Art music]], [[popular music]], [[traditional music]], regional and national music, and [[fusion genre|fusions]] of those genres. Within these larger genres are many subgenres. For example, popular music would encompass [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[country music]], [[easy listening]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[rock music]], and several other genres. There may also be a subgenre within a subgenre such as [[vocalese]] and [[scat singing]] in jazz.

====Popular and traditional music====
In many modern pop [[musical group]]s, a lead singer performs the primary vocals or [[melody]] of a [[song]], as opposed to a [[Backing vocalist|backing singer]] who sings backup vocals or the [[harmony]] of a song. Backing vocalists sing some, but usually not all, parts of the song often singing only in a song's refrain or [[Hum (sound)|humming]] in the background. An exception is five-part [[Gospel music|gospel]] [[a cappella]] music, where the lead is the highest of the five voices and sings a [[descant]] and not the [[melody]]. Some artists may sing both the lead and backing vocals on audio recordings by overlapping recorded vocal tracks.

Popular music includes a range of vocal styles. [[Hip-hop]] uses [[rapping]], the [[rhythm]]ic delivery of [[rhyme]]s in a rhythmic speech over a [[beats (music)|beat]] or without accompaniment. Some types of rapping consist mostly or entirely of speech and chanting, like the Jamaican "[[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]]". In some types of rapping, the performers may interpolate short sung or half-sung passages. [[Blues]] singing is based on the use of the [[blue note]]s–notes sung at a slightly lower pitch than that of the major scale for expressive purposes. In [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[hardcore punk]] subgenres, vocal styles can include techniques such as [[screaming (music)|screams]], shouts, and unusual sounds such as the "[[death growl]]".

One difference between live performances in the popular and Classical genres is that whereas Classical performers often sing without amplification in small- to mid-size halls, in popular music, a [[microphone]] and [[PA system]] (amplifier and speakers) are used in almost all performance venues, even a small coffee house. The use of the microphone has had several impacts on popular music. For one, it facilitated the development of intimate, expressive singing styles such as "[[crooning]]" which would not have enough projection and volume if done without a microphone. As well, pop singers who use microphones can do a range of other vocal styles that would not project without amplification, such as making whispering sounds, humming, and mixing half-sung and sung tones. As well, some performers use the microphone's response patterns to create effects, such as bringing the mic very close to the mouth to get an enhanced bass response, or, in the case of hip-hop [[beatboxer]]s, doing plosive "p" and "b" sounds into the mic to create percussive effects. It n the 2000s, controversy arose over the widespread use of electronic [[Auto-Tune]] [[pitch correction]] devices with recorded and live popular music vocals. Controversy has also arisen due to cases where pop singers have been found to be [[lip-syncing in music|lip-syncing]] to a pre-recorded recording of their vocal performance or, in the case of the controversial act [[Milli Vanilli]], lip-syncing to tracks recorded by other uncredited singers.

While some bands use backup singers who only sing when they are onstage, it is common for backup singers in popular music to have other roles. In many [[Rock music|rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, the musicians doing backup vocals also play instruments, such as [[rhythm guitar]], electric bass, or drums. In [[Music of Latin America|Latin]] or [[Music of Cuba#African heritage|Afro-Cuban]] groups, backup singers may play percussion instruments or shakers while singing. In some pop and [[hip-hop]] groups and in [[musical theater]], the backup singers may be required to perform elaborately choreographed dance routines while they sing through headset microphones.

The salaries and working conditions for vocalists vary a great deal. While jobs in other music fields such as music education tend to be based on full-time, salaried positions, singing jobs tend to be based on contracts for individual shows or performances, or for a sequence of shows

Aspiring singers and vocalists must have musical skill, an excellent voice, the ability to work with people, and a sense of showmanship and drama.  Additionally, singers need to have the ambition and drive to continually study and improve,&lt;ref name="careers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.menc.org |title=National Association for Music Education (NAfME) |website=Menc.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2017-07-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420155809/http://www.menc.org/ |archivedate=20 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Professional singers continue to seek out [[vocal coach]]ing to hone their skills, extend their range, and learn new styles. As well, aspiring singers need to gain specialized skills in the vocal techniques used to interpret songs, learn about the vocal literature from their chosen style of music, and gain skills in choral music techniques, [[sight singing]] and memorizing songs, and  vocal exercises.

In order to become independent and survive  the competitive atmosphere and stay for a longer time and have a long career, singers must learn the skill of [[Composing (music)|Music composing]], [[Music Producer|Music producing]] and [[Lyrics]] writing, they should take advantage of social media platforms like [[YouTube]] and upload their musical contents. Many musicians gained popularity because of social media and got recognition, example [[Justin Bieber]]. After getting recognition and popularity for their "original" or "cover" songs, they can get offers for doing [[Concerts|Live shows]] from the event organisers, which is a large source of income for musicians across the world, [[YouTube]] also pays if the channel of the singer in YouTube is popular and have significant amount of subscribers and viewership. This they can also monetise (earn revenues) from [[Streaming media|Streaming]] apps.
They must also take steps to market themselves to buyers of vocal talent, by doing [[audition]]s in front of an  [[Music Director]]. Depending on the style of vocal music that a person has trained in, the "talent buyers" that they seek out may be [[Record company]], [[A&amp;R]] representatives, [[Music Director]], choir directors, nightclub managers, or concert promoters. A CD or DVD with excerpts of vocal performances. Some singers hire an agent or manager to help them to seek out engagements and other performance opportunities; the agent or manager is often paid by receiving a percentage of the fees that the singer gets from performing onstage.

==Singing competitions==
In recent years, the talent of singing has become competitive. Currently, there are several television shows that showcase these talents. ''[[American Idol]]'' was one of the prominent of these shows. Debuted in 2002, it was one of the first singing competition shows.The first singing reality show was [[Sa Re Ga Ma Pa]] launched by [[Zee TV]] in the 1995.&lt;ref name="year"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoopwhoop.com/Contestants-On-SaReGaMaPa/|title=Contestants on Saregamapa|accessdate=6 July 2017|date=March 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[American Idol]] Contestants audition in front of a panel of judges to see if they can move on to the next round in Hollywood, from then, the competition begins. The field of contestants is narrowed down week by week until a winner is chosen. In order to move on to the next round, the contestants fate is determined by public vote. ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'' is another well-known singing competition program. Similar to ''American Idol'', the contestants audition in front of a panel of judges, however, the judges chairs are faced towards the audience during the performance. If the coaches are interested in the artist, they will press their button signifying they want to coach them. Once the auditions conclude, coaches have their team of artists and the competition begins. Coaches then mentor their artists and they compete to find the best singer. Other well-known singing competitions include ''[[The X Factor]]'', ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', ''[[Rising Star (TV series)|Rising Star]]'' and ''[[The Sing-Off]]''.

==Health benefits==
Scientific studies suggest that singing can have positive effects on people's health.  A preliminary study based on self-reported data from a survey of students participating in choral singing found perceived benefits including increased lung capacity, improved mood, stress reduction, as well as perceived social and spiritual benefits.&lt;ref name="Clift2001"&gt;

A multinational collaboration to study the connection between singing and health was established in 2009, called ''Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing'' (AIRS).&lt;ref name="AIRS"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] |title=Doctor's prescription: 2 arias + a chorus |last=Mick |first=Hayley |date=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150118161443/http://singaana.com/doctors-prescription-2-arias-chorus/ |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singing provides physical, cognitive, and emotional benefits to participants. When they step on stage, many singers forget their worries and focus solely on the song. Singing is becoming a more widely known method of increasing an individual's overall health and wellness, in turn helping them to battle diseases such as cancer more effectively due to decreased stress, releasing of endorphin's, and increased lung capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/1774037978|title=Chronicle-Herald|last=Clarke|first=Heather Laura|date=June 20, 2014|work=|access-date=November 11, 2016|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on the brain ===
John Daniel Scott, among others, have cited that "people who sing are more likely to be happy." This is because "singing elevates the levels of neurotransmitters which are associated with pleasure and well being." Humans have a long prehistory of music, especially singing; before written language, stories were passed down through song, because song is often more memorable. There is also evidence that music or singing may have evolved in humans before language. Levitin, in his ''This is Your Brain on Music'', argues that "music may be the activity that prepared our pre-human ancestors for speech communication" and that "singing ... might have helped our species to refine motor skills, paving the way for the development of the exquisitely fine muscle control required for vocal ... speech" (260).&lt;ref name="brain on music"&gt;{{Cite book|title = This is Your Brain on Music: The Science of a Human Obsession|last = Levitin|first = Daniel J.|publisher = Plume|year = 2006|isbn = 978-0452288522|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, he cites Pinker, who "argued that language is an adaptation and music is its [[Spandrel (biology)|Spandrel]] ... an evolutionary accident piggybacking on language" (248).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt;

Studies have found evidence suggesting the mental, as well as physical, benefits of singing. When conducting a study with 21 members of a choir at three different points over one year, three themes suggested three areas of benefits; the social impact (connectedness with others), personal impact (positive emotions, self-perception, etc.), and functional outcomes (health benefits of being in the choir). Findings showed that a sense of wellbeing is associated with singing, by uplifting the mood of the participants and releasing endorphins in the brain. Many singers also reported that the singing helped then regulate stress and relax, allowing them to deal better with their daily lives. From a social perspective, approval from the audience, and interaction with other choir members in a positive manner is also beneficial.

Singing is beneficial for pregnant mothers. By giving them another medium of communication with their newborns, mothers in one study reported feelings of love and affection when singing to their unborn children. They also reported feeling more relaxed than ever before during their stressful pregnancy. A song can have nostalgic significance by reminding a singer of the past, and momentarily transport them, allowing them to focus on singing and embrace the activity as an escape from their daily lives and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dingle|first=Genevieve|year=2012|title="To be heard": The social and mental health benefits of choir singing for disadvantaged adults|doi=10.1177/0305735611430081|journal=Psychology of Music|volume=41|issue=4|pages=405–421|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:267353/UQ267353_post_print.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on body===
A recent study by [[Tenovus Cancer Care]] found that singing in a choir for just one hour boosts levels of immune proteins in cancer patients and has a positive overall effect on the health of patients. The study explores the possibility that singing could help put patients in the best mental and physical shape to receive the treatment they need, by reducing stress hormones, and increasing quantities of cytokines- proteins of the immune system that can increase the body's ability to fight disease. "Singing gives you physical benefits like breath control and muscle movement and enunciation, as well as the learning benefits of processing information" says a musical director and accompanist in the study. The enunciation and speech benefits tie into the language benefits detailed below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/04/160404221004.htm|title=Choir singing boosts immune system activity in cancer patients and carers, study shows|last=sciencedaily|first=from ecancermedicalscience|date=April 4, 2016|work=|access-date=November 10, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent newspaper article by the ''Toronto Star'' states that everyone to sing, even if they are not musically talented, because of the benefits it has for the health of the individual. Singing lowers blood pressure by releasing pent up emotions, boosting relaxation and reminding them of happy times. It also allows singers to breathe more easily. Patients with lung disease and chronic pulmonary disease experience relief from their symptoms from singing just two times a week. In addition to breathing related illness, singing also has numerous benefits for stroke victims when it comes to relearning the ability to speak and communicate by singing their thoughts. Singing activates the right side of the brain when the left side cannot function (the left side is the area of the brain responsible for speech), so it is easy to see how singing can be an excellent alternative to speech while the victim heals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2011/04/25/you_docs_5_reasons_to_sing_even_if_you_cant_carry_a_tune.html|title=The Star|last=Rozien Oz|first=Mike Mehmet|date=April 25, 2011|work=|access-date=November 25, 2011|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing and language ==
Every natural or non natural language has its own intrinsic musicality which affects singing by means of pitch, phrasing and accent.

=== Neurological aspects ===
Much research has been done recently on the link between music and language, especially singing. It is becoming increasingly clear that these two processes are very much alike, and yet also different. Levitin describes how, beginning with the eardrum, sound waves are translated into pitch, or a tonotopic map, and then shortly thereafter "speech and music probably diverge into separate processing circuits" (130).&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; There is evidence that neural circuits used for music and language may start out in infants undifferentiated. There are several areas of the brain that are used for both language and music. For example, Brodmann Area 47. Levitin recounts how in certain studies, "listening to music and attending its syntactic features," similar to the syntactic processes in language, activated this part of the brain. In addition, "musical syntax ... has been localized to ... areas adjacent to and overlapping with those regions that process speech syntax, such as Broca's area" and "the regions involved in musical semantics ..  appear to be [localized] near Wernicke's area." Both Broca's area and Wernicke's area are important steps in language processing and production.

Singing has been shown to help stroke victims recover speech. According to neurologist Gottfried Schlaug, there is a corresponding area to that of speech, which resides in the left hemisphere, on the right side of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Singing 'rewires' damaged brain |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8526699.stm |publisher = BBC News|date = 2010-02-21|access-date = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is casually known as the "singing center." By teaching stroke victims to sing their words, this can help train this area of the brain for speech. In support of this theory, Levitin asserts that "regional specificity," such as that for speech, "may be temporary, as the processing centers for important mental functions actually move to other regions after trauma or brain damage."&lt;ref name="brain on music" /&gt; Thus in the right hemisphere of the brain, the "singing center" may be [[neuroplasticity|retrained]] to help produce speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://musicianbrain.gottfriedschlaug.org/papers/Loui_Wan_Schlaug_2010_Acoustics_Today.pdf |journal=Acoustics Today |volume=6 |issue=3 | date=July 2010 |authors=Psyche Loui, Catherine Y. Wan, Gottfried Schlaug |title=Neurological Bases of Musical Disorders and Their Implications for Stroke Recovery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accents and singing ===
{{Expand section|date=January 2013}}

The speaking dialect or accent of a person may differ greatly from the general singing accent that a person uses while singing. When people sing, they generally use the accent or neutral accent that is used in the style of music they are singing in, rather than a regional accent or dialect; the style of music and the popular center/region of the style has more influence on the singing accent of a person than where they come from. For example, in the English language, British singers of rock or popular music often sing in an American accent or neutral accent instead of an English accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=Rock 'n' roll best sung in American accents|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/7922639/Rock-n-roll-best-sung-in-American-accents.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=L.V.|title=Why Do British Singers Sound American?|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/explainer/2012/11/skyfall_theme_song_by_adele_why_do_british_singers_sound_american.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|accessdate=9 January 2013|date=19 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singing animals ==
Scholars agree that singing is strongly present in many different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Marler | first1 = Peter | year = 1970 | title = Birdsong and speech development: Could there be parallels? | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 58 | issue = 6| pages = 669–73 | pmid = 5480089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wallin, Nils, Bjorn Merker, Steven Brown. (Editors) (2000). The origins of music. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wide dispersal of singing behavior among very different animal species, like [[bird]]s, [[gibbon]]s, [[whale]]s, and many others strongly suggests that singing appeared independently in different species. Currently, there are about 5400 species of animals that are known to sing. At least some singing species demonstrate the ability to [[learn]] their songs, to [[improvise]] and even to [[Composer|compose]] new melodies.&lt;ref&gt;Payne, Katherine (2000). "The progressively changing songs of humpback whales: a window on the creative process in a wild animal." In The Origins of Music. Edited by N. L. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 135–150. Cambridge, Massachusetts:MIT&lt;/ref&gt;  In some animal species singing is a group activity (see, for example, singing in [[gibbon]] families&lt;ref&gt;Geissmann, Thomas. 2000. "Gibbon songs and human music from an evolutionary perspective." In ''The origins of Music''. Edited by N. Wallin, B. Merker and S. Brown, pp. 103–124. Cambridge, Massachusetts: [[MIT]]&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Background==
Military operations in [[World War II]] in Yugoslavia began on 6 April 1941, when the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] was swiftly conquered by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces and partitioned between [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Hungary]], [[Bulgaria]] and client regimes. Following a German bombing campaign, Sarajevo, along with the rest of Bosnia and Herzegovina, was conquered by the [[Ustashe]] Croatian fascist [[Independent State of Croatia]], a puppet state of [[Nazi Germany]]. Many of the city's [[Serbs]], [[Romani people|Romani]], and [[Jews]] were taken at this time and killed in the [[Holocaust]]. The city's resistance was led by [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav Partisan]] commander, [[Vladimir Perić]], known by his [[nom de guerre]] ''Walter''. With an Allied victory on the horizon, [[Adolf Hitler]] personally issued a directive on 15 February 1945 ordering the holding of Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sarajevo.travel/ba/tekst/6-april-dan-oslobodenja-sarajeva/182|title=6 april - Dan oslobođenja Sarajeva|publisher=Sarajevo Travel}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ferocious fighting the city was finally liberated on 6 April 1945 by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia]]. The date has since been known as Sarajevo City Day. In 1956 the City Assembly of Sarajevo established the Sixth April Award of Sarajevo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevotimes.com/formal-session-city-council-sarajevo-day-city-sarajevo/|title=Formal Session of City Council of Sarajevo for Day of the City of Sarajevo|publisher=sarajevotimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Soft-paste porcelain''' (sometimes simply "soft paste", or "'''artificial porcelain'''") is a type of [[ceramic]] material in [[pottery]], usually accepted as a type of [[porcelain]].  It is weaker than "true" [[hard-paste porcelain]], and does not require either the high firing temperatures or the special mineral ingredients needed for that.  There are many types, using a range of materials. The material originated in the attempts by many European potters to replicate hard-paste [[Chinese export porcelain]], especially in the 18th century, and the best versions match hard-paste in whiteness and translucency, but not in strength.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 3-6&lt;/ref&gt;  But the look and feel of the material can be highly attractive, and it can take painted decoration very well.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 104; Edwards, 4&lt;/ref&gt;

The ingredients varied considerably, but always included [[clay]], often [[ball clay]], and often ground glass, [[bone ash]], [[soapstone]] (steatite), [[flint]], and [[quartz]].  They rarely included the key ingredients necessary for hard-paste, [[china clay]] including [[kaolin]], or the English [[china stone]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 1-6&lt;/ref&gt; although some manufacturers included one or other of these, but failed to get their kilns up to a hard-paste firing temperature.  They were called "soft paste" (after the French "pâte tendre") either because the material is softer in the kiln, and prone to "slump", or their firing temperatures are lower compared with hard-paste porcelain,&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1977), 4; Rado, P, ''An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery'', 2nd edition. Pergamon Press, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; or, more likely, because the finished products actually are far softer than hard-paste, and early versions were much easier to scratch or break, as well as being prone to shatter when hot liquid was suddenly poured into them.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1977), 2, 4, 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The German [[Meissen porcelain]] had developed hard-paste porcelain by 1708, and later German factories usually managed to find the secret out from former Meissen employees, beginning with [[Vienna porcelain]] in 1718.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 88-102&lt;/ref&gt; The other European countries had much longer to wait, but most factories eventually switched from soft to hard-paste, having discovered both the secret and a source of kaolin. In France kaolin was only found in [[Limousin]] in 1768, and [[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres|Sèvres]] produced both types from 1769, before finally dropping soft-paste in 1804.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1977), 3; Battie, 107-109&lt;/ref&gt;  In England there was a movement in a different direction, as Spode's formula for [[bone china]], developed in the 1790s, was adopted by most other factories by about 1820.  By that point little soft-paste porcelain was being made anywhere, and little hard-paste in England, with [[Nantgarw Pottery|Nantgarw]] and [[Glamorgan Pottery|Swansea]] in Wales among the last factories making soft-paste.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1977), 4-5; see Edwards for the Welsh factories.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
[[File:Saint Cloud bowl soft porcelain with blue decorations under glaze 1700 1710.jpg|thumb|[[Saint-Cloud manufactory]] [[soft porcelain]] bowl, with blue decoration under glaze, 1700-1710.]]
There were early attempts by European potters to replicate [[Chinese porcelain]] when its composition was little understood and its constituents were not widely available in the West. The earliest formulations were mixtures of [[clay]] and ground-up [[glass]] ([[frit]]).  [[Soapstone]] (steatite) and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] are also known to have been included in some compositions. The first successful attempt was [[Medici porcelain]], produced between 1575 and 1587. It was composed of white clay containing powdered [[feldspar]], [[calcium phosphate]] and [[wollastonite]] (CaSiO3), with [[quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;Marco Spallanzani, ''Ceramiche alla Corte dei Medici nel Cinquecento'', (Pisa:  Scuola Normale Superiore, and Modena:  Franco Cosimo Panini, 1994), p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to on-site [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman spectroscopic analyses]] performed at the Musée National de Céramique, Sèvres, reported in Ph. Colomban, V. Milande, H. Lucas, "On-site Raman analysis of Medici porcelain", ''Journal of Raman Spectroscopy'', '''35'''.1 (2003:68-72).&lt;/ref&gt; Other early European soft-paste porcelain, also a frit porcelain, was produced at the [[Rouen manufactory]] in 1673, which was known for this reason as "Porcelaine française".&lt;ref name="Barber 5"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=AQH3op9kyvcC&amp;pg=PP12 ''Artificial Soft Paste Porcelain - France, Italy, Spain and England'' Edwin Atlee Barber p.5-6]&lt;/ref&gt; Again, these were developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese hard-paste porcelain.&lt;ref name="Barber 5"/&gt; As these early formulations slumped in the kiln at high temperatures, they were difficult and uneconomic to use. Later formulations used [[kaolin]] (china clay), [[quartz]], [[feldspar]]s, [[nepheline syenite]] and other feldspathic rocks. Soft-paste porcelain with these ingredients was technically superior to the traditional soft-paste and these formulations remain in production.

==Characteristics==
Soft-paste formulations containing little clay are not very plastic&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1952), p.296&lt;/ref&gt; and shaping it on the potter's wheel is difficult. Pastes with more clay (now more commonly referred to as "bodies"), such as electrical porcelain, are extremely plastic and can be shaped by methods such as jolleying and turning.&lt;!-- Green --&gt; The feldspathic formulations are, however, more resilient and suffer less pyroplastic deformation. Soft-paste is fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, typically around 1100 °C&lt;ref&gt;Fournier, p.214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Firing --&gt; for the frit based compositions and 1200 to 1250 °C for those using [[feldspar]]s or [[nepheline syenite]]s as the primary [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]]. The lower firing temperature gives [[artist]]s and [[manufacturer]]s some benefits, including a wider palette of colours for decoration and reduced fuel consumption.&lt;!-- White --&gt; The body of soft-paste is more [[granular]] than hard-paste porcelain, less glass being formed in the firing process.

According to one expert, with a background in chemistry, "The definition of porcelain and its soft-paste and hard-paste varieties is fraught with misconceptions",&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 4&lt;/ref&gt; and various categories based on the analysis of the ingredients have been proposed instead.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;  Some writers have proposed a "catch-all" category of "hybrid" porcelain, to include bone china and various "variant" bodies made at various times.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
At least in the past, some sources dealing with modern industrial chemistry and pottery production have made a completely different distinction between "hard porcelain" and "soft porcelain", by which all forms of pottery porcelain, including East Asian wares, are "soft porcelain".&lt;ref&gt;''Inorganic Chemistry'', by A. F. Holleman, Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Editor Nils Wiberg, 2001, Academic Press, ISBN, 0123526515, 9780123526519, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Mtth5g59dEIC&amp;pg=PA890 google books]; see also Singer and Singer, pp. 104-1102&lt;/ref&gt;

==European soft-paste==
[[Chinese porcelain]], which arrived in Europe before the 14th century, was much admired and expensive to purchase.  Attempts were made to imitate it from the 15th century onwards but its composition was little understood.  Its translucency suggested that glass might be an ingredient,&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1952), p.496&lt;/ref&gt; so many experiments combined clay with powdered glass ([[frit]]), including the porcelain made in [[Florence]] in the late 16th century under the patronage of the [[Medicis]].  In [[Venice]] there were experiments supposedly using opaque glass alone.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1952), p.497&lt;/ref&gt;

German factories either made hard-paste from their foundation, like Meissen, Vienna, [[Ludwigsburg porcelain|Ludwigsburg]], [[Frankenthal Porcelain Factory|Frankenthal]] and later factories, or obtained the secret and switched. France did in fact make hard-paste at Strasbourg in 1752-54, until [[Louis XV]] gave his own factory, [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes]], a monopoly, at which point the factory moved to become the Frankenthal operation.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 88-102&lt;/ref&gt;

Early factories in France, England, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland and other countries made soft-paste, the switch to hard-paste generally coming after 1750, with France and England rather in the rear, as explained below.&lt;ref&gt;Battie, 102-113&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[American China Manufactory]] (or Bonnin and Morris) in [[Philadelphia]], America's first successful porcelain factory, also made soft-paste from about 1770-72.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/13370 Metropolitan Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===France===
{{further|Porcelain of France}}
[[File:Saint Cloud soft porcelain vase with blue designs under glaze 1695-1700.jpg|thumb|[[Saint-Cloud porcelain|Saint-Cloud manufactory]] [[soft porcelain]] vase, with blue designs under glaze, 1695-1700.]]
Experiments at the [[Rouen manufactory]] produced the earliest soft-paste in France, when a 1673 patent was granted to Louis Poterat, but it seems that not much was made.  An application for the renewal of the patent in 1694 stated, "the secret was  very little used, the petitioners devoting themselves rather to faience-making".  Rouen porcelain, which is blue painted, is rare and difficult to identify.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1952), p.528&lt;/ref&gt;

The first important French porcelain was made at the [[Saint-Cloud porcelain|Saint-Cloud factory]], which was an established maker of [[faience]].  In 1702, letters-patent were granted to the family of Pierre Chicaneau, who were said to have  improved upon the process discovered by him, and since 1693 to have made porcelain as "perfect as the Chinese". The typical blue-painted Saint-Cloud porcelain, says Honey, "is one of the most distinct and attractive of porcelains, and not the least part of its charm lies in the quality of the material itself.  It is rarely of a pure white, but the warm yellowish or ivory tone of the best wares of the period is sympathetic and by no means a shortcoming; and while actually very soft and glassy, it has a firm texture unlike any other.  The glaze often shows a fine satin-like pitting of the surface that helps to distinguish it from the brilliant shiny glaze of Mennecy, which is otherwise similar.  The heavy build of the pieces is also characteristic and is saved from clumsiness by a finer sense of mass, revealed in the subtly graduated thickness of wall and a delicate shaping of edges."&lt;ref name="Honey, p.533"&gt;Honey (1952), p.533&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon|Louis Henry de Bourbon, prince de Condé]] established a soft-paste factory on the grounds of his [[château de Chantilly]] in 1730; [[Chantilly porcelain]] continued to be made after his death in 1740.

A soft-paste factory was opened [[Mennecy-Villeroy porcelain|at Mennecy]] by François Barbin in 1750. The [[Vincennes porcelain|Vincennes porcelain factory]] was established in 1740 under the supervision of Claude-Humbert Gérin, who had previously been employed at Chantilly. The factory moved to larger premises at [http://manufacturedesevres.culture.gouv.fr/site.php?type=P&amp;id=20 Sèvres]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sevr/hd_sevr.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1756. A superior soft-paste was developed at Vincennes, whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/porf/hd_porf.htm Metropolitan Museum of Art]&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of frit in this paste lent it the names ''"Frittenporzellan"'' in Germany  and ''"frita"'' in Spain.  In France it was known as ''"pâte tendre"'' and in England "soft-paste",&lt;ref name="Honey, p.533"/&gt; perhaps because it does not easily retain its shape in the wet state, or because it tends to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched.  (Scratching with a file is a crude way of finding out whether a piece is made of soft-paste or not.)

===England===
The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by [[Thomas Briand]] to the [[Royal Society]] in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, [[Thomas Frye]], a portrait painter, took out a [[patent]] on a porcelain containing bone ash.  This was the first [[bone china]], subsequently perfected by [[Josiah Spode]].

Recipes were closely guarded, as illustrated by the story of [[Robert Brown (potter)|Robert Brown]], a founding partner in the [[Lowestoft#Lowestoft porcelain|Lowestoft]] factory, who is said to have hidden in a barrel in [[Bow, London|Bow]] to observe the mixing of their porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Savage (1983), p.215&lt;/ref&gt; A partner in [[Longton Hall]] referred to "the Art, Secret or Mystery" of porcelain.&lt;ref&gt;Savage, (1983), p.212&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fifteen years after Briand's demonstration, several factories were founded in England to make soft-paste table-wares and figures:&lt;ref&gt;All covered by Honey (1977) - see Index or Contents&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chinese soft-paste porcelain==
Unlike the European product, Chinese porcelain began with hard-paste, and it is common to regard all Chinese production as hard-paste,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 4&lt;/ref&gt; until bone china began to be made there in the 20th century.  However, a classification of "Chinese soft-paste porcelain" is often recognised by museums and auction-houses,&lt;ref&gt;[https://art.thewalters.org/detail/18070 example in the Walters Art Museum]; [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/47049 example in the Metropolitan Museum]; [https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-fine-and-rare-ding-type-glazed-soft-paste-5747738-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5747738&amp;sid=c6ac7f4a-3154-47ac-9521-739cc7966bc8 Lot 3205 "A FINE AND RARE DING-TYPE GLAZED SOFT-PASTE VASE, QIANLONG INCISED SIX-CHARACTER SEAL MARK AND OF THE PERIOD (1736-1795)"] [[Christie's]], Hong Kong, Sale 3265, ''Imperial Chinese Porcelain: Treasures from a Distinguished American Collection'', 27 November 2013, [https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/a-chinese-soft-paste-blue-and-white-porcelain-5184916-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5184916&amp;sid=552d2508-b2c7-4b59-b94a-ecafd3f0c0b0 another example]&lt;/ref&gt; though its existence may be denied by others.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 4&lt;/ref&gt;  

It refers to pieces of Chinese porcelain, mostly from the first half of the 18th century, that are less translucent than most Chinese porcelain and have a rather milky-white glaze, which is prone to [[Craquelure#Craquelure_in_ceramics|crackling]].  Some regard it as essentially made from a hard-paste body that did not reach a sufficiently high firing temperature, or uses a different glaze formula. It takes [[underglaze]] [[cobalt]] blue painting especially well, and is presumably the ware using ''huashi'' mentioned by Father [[François Xavier d'Entrecolles]] in his published letters describing Chinese production.&lt;ref&gt;Valenstein, 242&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hard-paste porcelain==
[[Hard-paste porcelain]] was successfully produced at [[Meissen porcelain|Meissen]] in 1708 by [[Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus]], though [[Johann Friedrich Böttger]] who continued his work has often been credited with the discovery of this recipe. As the recipe was kept secret, experiments continued elsewhere, mixing glass materials (fused and ground into a frit) with clay or other substances to give whiteness and a degree of plasticity.  [[Plymouth porcelain]], founded in 1748, which moved to Bristol soon after, was the first English factory to make hard-paste.&lt;ref&gt;Honey (1977), Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sos mi hombre''''' ({{lang-es|You are the one}}) is an Argentine telenovela, which aired on [[El Trece (Argentina)|El Trece]] in 2012-2013. It starred [[Luciano Castro]] and [[Celeste Cid]].

==Premise==
The two telenovelas made by [[Pol-Ka]] at the beginning of 2012, ''[[Lobo (telenovela)|Lobo]]'' and the second season of ''[[Los únicos]]'', were cancelled because of poor ratings. ''[[Graduados]]'', a fiction aired in the rival channel [[Telefe]], became a huge success. As a result, Pol-Ka rushed the creation of a new telenovela, ''Sos mi hombre'', that filled the timeslot of ''Lobo''. The main actors were [[Luciano Castro]] and [[Celeste Cid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1465434-susana-y-mirtha-juntas-en-la-fiesta-de-telefe|title= Luciano Castro y Celeste Cid protagonizarán Sos mi hombre|trans-title=Luciano Castro and Celeste Cid will work in Sos mi hombre|language= Spanish|author= |date= April 16, 2012|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ''Sos mi hombre'' did not prevail against ''Graduados'' either, it had better rating than the previous telenovelas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1501410-que-te-parecio-el-primer-capitulo-de-sos-mi-hombre|title= ¿Qué te pareció el primer capítulo de Sos mi hombre?|trans-title=What did you thought of the first episode of Sos mi hombre?|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 22, 2012|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last episode had 12,8 rating points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1595275-que-te-parecio-el-final-de-sos-mi-hombre|title= ¿Qué te pareció el final de Sos mi hombre?|trans-title=What did you thought of the end of Sos mi hombre?|language= Spanish|author= |date= June 25, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The program was nominated for the 2013 edition of the [[Martín Fierro Awards]], as best daily fiction. Other nominations are: Luciano Castro as best lead actor of daily fiction, Celeste Cid as lead actress in fiction, [[Osvaldo Laport]] as best guest star, [[Joaquín Furriel]] as secondary actor in daily fiction, and [[Eugenia Tobal]] as secondary actress in daily fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1594993-todos-los-nominados-a-los-martin-fierro-2013|title= Todos los nominados a los Martín Fierro 2013|trans-title=All the nominations for the Martín Fierro 2013|language= Spanish|author= |date= June 24, 2013|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The writer Adriana Lorenzón (who wrote ''[[El elegido]]'', ''[[Por amor a vos]]'' and ''[[Los Roldán]]'') and the actor [[Pepe Monje]] accused the program of being similar to another one they wrote 2 years before. Their program, called "Fuego en tu boca" ({{lang-es|Fire in your mouth}}), only had a [[pilot episode]] and was never aired. The plot was about a boxer from the [[La Boca]] neighbourhood, who also works as a firefighter. Actors [[Juan Palomino]], [[Maximiliano Guerra]], [[Chechu Bonelli]], [[Jorgelina Aruzzi]] and [[Luís Machín]] worked in that production as well.&lt;ref name="polemica"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1501421-polemica-detras-del-estreno-de-sos-mi-hombre|title= Polémica detrás del estreno de Sos mi hombre|trans-title=Controversy behind the airing of Sos mi Hombre|language= Spanish|author= |date= August 22, 2012|work= |publisher= La Nación|accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The TV channel [[El Trece]] replied that the main idea of the telenovela had already been proposed to actor [[Facundo Arana]] in 2004, predating both series. The portrayal of the world of box is also similar to previous productions from [[Pol-Ka]], such as ''[[Campeones]]''.&lt;ref name="polemica"/&gt;

==Plot==
Ringo is a retired boxer, facing economic problems and trying to gain the child custody of his son. He works as a volunteer firefighter. Camila is a young doctor, who works in public hospitals and helps in social diners.

[[File:Tape art by Max Zorn.jpg|thumb|A work in brown packing tape on acrylic glass by Max Zorn, illuminated from behind]]

'''Tape art''' is an artwork created with [[adhesive tape]] such as [[duct tape]] or [[packing tape]]. It developed from urban art in the 1960s, as an alternative to the widely spread use of [[spray can]]s in the urban art scene. Tape can be used to produce a "[[stained glass]]" effect when applied to glass or plastic which is lit from behind. It can be attached to a wall to form the outline or an image, or can be shaped into three-dimensional sculptures.

Tape artists such as [[Max Zorn (artist)|Max Zorn]] show their work at art fairs including [[Art Basel Miami Beach|Art Basel Miami]].

== Characteristics ==

Tape art can be installed quickly and almost silently, making it suitable for small or temporary urban art projects. No masking or covering is necessary. Tape is relatively easy to handle, and can be applied to various surfaces, such as stone, asphalt, wood, [[aluminum]], [[sandwich panel]]s or glass. Interior installations work just as well as exterior ones.{{dubious|date=March 2016}} Unlike [[spray paint art]], tape art can be removed easily without leaving a permanent mark.

Materials for tape art vary depending on which tape is being used. Tape art can use duct tape, packing tape, [[masking tape]] or other products. Unlike traditional paintings and sculptures, tape art can be applied anywhere, including the doors, ceilings and floors of galleries. Duct tape can be used to construct [[three-dimensional]] sculptures.&lt;ref name="About tape art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ostap about tape art|url=http://ostap-art.com/tape-artist-slava-ostap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ThanksKilling''''' is a 2008 [[Horror film|horror]] [[black comedy]] film written and directed by Jordan Downey, and co-written by Brad Schulz, Tony Wilson, Grant Yaffee, and Kevin Stewart. It was followed by a 2013 sequel titled ''ThanksKilling 3'', the $112,248 budget of which was raised on through  [[Kickstarter]] campaign.&lt;ref name = LMU/&gt;

== Plot ==
At the first [[Thanksgiving]] in 1621, a topless [[Pilgrim Fathers|Pilgrim]] is slain with a [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]] wielded by an evil demonic turkey, which quips, "Nice tits, bitch!"

Centuries later, five college students (good girl Kristen, [[Jock (athlete)|jock]] Johnny, ditzy Ali, [[redneck]] Billy, and nerdy Darren) head home to Crawl Berg (formerly Crawberg) for Thanksgiving with their families. After Kristen calls her father, the local sheriff, the car overheats, forcing the quintet to camp out for the night. As they are setting up, Darren tells the [[settler]]-era [[Folklore|folktale]] of Feathercloud, a Native American [[Shamanism|shaman]] who was dishonored by hedonistic pilgrim Chuck Langston, one of Billy's ancestors. The outraged Feathercloud used [[necromancy]] to create Turkie, who is said to appear every five-hundred and five years to slaughter all Caucasians he encounters.

Elsewhere, a dog owned by a [[hermit]] named Oscar urinates on a miniature [[totem pole]], desecrating it, and releasing Turkie prematurely and urinating on him as well.  Angry, Turkie kills the dog, prompting Oscar to swear vengeance as Turkie runs off, and scares Kristen. Kristen tells the others about her run-in with Turkie, but they laugh off her story, until a baby rabbit (which appears to have been pecked to death) is thrown into their campfire. The next day, Turkie flags down a vehicle, and when the driver sexually propositions him, Turkie responds by shooting the man in the head and hijacking his car. By nightfall, the students reach their respective homes, and while Johnny tries to reconnect with his estranged father, Turkie attacks him. Johnny's parents are killed, but he escapes, and rejoins his friends with the exception of Ali, who is having sex with her boyfriend, Greg. Turkie walks in on the lovers, slits Greg's throat, and rapes Ali before snapping her neck.

After finding Ali's remains, the students decide to go to Kristen's house, to see if her father has any books about Turkie in his library. Turkie beats them there, tricking Kristen's father (who is dressed as a turkey for an upcoming pageant) into letting him in by wearing [[Groucho glasses]]. As they wait for Kristen, Turkie and the sheriff share an awkward snack, which ends when Turkie murders the sheriff after he mistakes him for a duck. Kristen and her friends arrive, and are allowed in by Turkie, who has donned the sheriff's severed face as a disguise. Darren finds a book about Turkie, and it mentions he can be killed if his magic [[talisman]] is removed, though the rest of the passage about how to destroy him is written in code. Billy stumbles onto Turkie disposing of the sheriff's body, and while he and the others succeed in getting the talisman, Turkie gets away.

Billy storms off while Darren cracks the code in the book, discovering that Turkie must be burned at the stake after a demonic prayer is said backwards. Outside, Turkie magically enters Billy's body, and shoots his way out. Billy dies in Darren's arms as they reminisce about all the good times they had together. Darren, Kristen, and Johnny track Turkie to his [[tipi]] and say the prayer, but as they prepare to burn him he runs outside, and is shot in the head by Oscar. Oscar leaves, and the others go to Kristen's house, unaware that the dumpster Turkie was blasted into contains [[radioactive waste]], which reanimates him.

Believing that Turkie is dead, the surviving teens go back to Kristen's house. While Johnny and Kristen admit their feelings for each other, Darren awkwardly goes to the kitchen to get a snack. There, Turkie rips Darren's tongue and heart out, and stabs Johnny with an [[electric knife]]. As Johnny dies, Kristen sets Turkie on fire with an aerosol flamethrower, and knocks him into a pile of wood. Later, at a family's Thanksgiving dinner, the cooked turkey comes to life, and in Turkie's voice yells, "Do I smell sequel, biotch?!"

== Production ==

''ThanksKilling'' was shot on a budget of $3,500 in the summer of 2007, and released on DVD in 2009.&lt;ref name = LMU/&gt;

== Reception ==

''ThanksKilling'' was called "cheerily awful" by Tom Russo of ''[[The Boston Globe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/2011/11/13/dvd-reviews/DjAIpSR81VZ1YEC5XzjDuK/story.html|title = DVD reviews|last = Russo|first = Tom|publisher = ''[[The Boston Globe]]''|date = 13 November 2011|website = bostonglobe.com|accessdate = 12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' stated, "It's a comedy-horror movie, but even the humor is awful. But it's so darn awful that it doesn't even need ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'' voice-over jokes to be entertainingly terrible. If you can enjoy laughing at a bad movie, definitely add this one to your list".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2011/11/18/top-five-best-alternate-thanksgiving-movies/|title = Top Five Best 'Alternate' Thanksgiving Movies|last = Hughes|first = Mark|publisher = ''[[Forbes]]''|date = 18 November 2011|website = forbes.com|accessdate = 11 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DVD Verdict]]'s Gordon Sullivan responded well to the film, writing, "In some ways there's nothing special about ''ThanksKilling''—it's a typical [[Slasher film|slasher]]-style creature-feature where a group of college kids are menaced by a holiday themed killer who spouts one liners. However, ''ThanksKilling'' knows how to tickle the low-budget funny bone in particularly effective ways" and "The film itself is a campy low-budget horror flick that gets in and out in little over an hour, delivering the goods all the while. The extras are a little slight, but overall, this disc should please genre fans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/thankskilling.php|title = ''ThanksKilling''|last = Sullivan|first = Gordon|publisher = [[DVD Verdict]]|date = 18 November 2011|website = dvdverdict.com|accessdate = 7 June 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714125316/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/thankskilling.php|archivedate = 14 July 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Last Mimzy''''' is a 2007 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[adventure film|adventure]] [[drama film]] directed by [[Robert Shaye]] and loosely adapted from the 1943 science fiction short story "[[Mimsy Were the Borogoves]]" by [[Lewis Padgett]] (the [[pseudonym]] of husband-and-wife team [[Henry Kuttner]] and [[C. L. Moore]]). The film features [[Timothy Hutton]], [[Joely Richardson]], [[Rainn Wilson]], [[Kathryn Hahn]], [[Michael Clarke Duncan]], and introducing [[Rhiannon Leigh Wryn]] as seven-year-old Emma Wilder and Chris O’Neil as ten-year-old Noah.

==Plot==
Presented as a story to a group of students by their teacher Lena that takes place in the distant future, ''The Last Mimzy'' is the story of the attempt by humans in the distant future to avert a catastrophic [[ecological disaster]] that has destroyed their world. Humanity has become "isolated and warlike," and one scientist is desperately working to save the earth and its people. [[High tech|High-tech]] devices disguised as [[toy]]s are sent back in time, where they are found by Noah (Chris O'Neil) and Emma (Rhiannon Leigh Wryn) Wilder, children living in early-21st-century [[Seattle]]. The "toys" are incomprehensible to them, except for what appears to be a [[Stuffed animal|stuffed]] [[rabbit]]. Sensing the paranormal strangeness of the devices, the children initially keep their discovery secret from their parents.

Emma becomes telepathically connected to the stuffed rabbit, and learns its name, Mimzy, and other information from it, acknowledging it as her teacher. Interaction with the devices causes the children to develop advanced knowledge, [[genius]]-level [[intelligence]] and [[psionic]] abilities. Due to her psychic connection with Mimzy, Emma's development of her abilities is much stronger than her older brother's; she is the only one to display [[empathy]], [[telepathy]], [[levitation (paranormal)|levitation]], and [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]] (though Noah can also communicate with her once she has telepathically contacted him). Emma is also the only one who can use the "spinners", small rocks that when spun, telekinetically float and can produce a force-field. Noah's own psionic/physic abilities are developed through a green card and a [[seashell]]. He gains increased intelligence, knowledge, telepathy, empathic communication and control over [[arthropods]]. He can also use the card to telekinetically [[teleportation|teleport]] objects through a small [[dimensional rift]] after staring at it and observing his surroundings. At one point, Noah becomes somewhat envious of his sister's psionic prowess, but she reveals to him that even though she is the "chosen one', he is her chosen "engineer" and she cannot "build the bridge to the future" without him.

The children's astounding [[List of psychic abilities|psionic]] and [[Extrasensory perception|extrasensory]] abilities and Emma's attachment to Mimzy alert their parents, especially their mother, and Larry White, Noah's science schoolteacher, to the devices. Later, Noah accidentally fuses the card with a blue blob, turning it into a "generator" that causes a [[power outage|power black-out]] over half the state of Washington, alerting the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] to their activities. The family is held for questioning by Special Agent Nathaniel Broadman ([[Michael Clarke Duncan]]), and it is revealed that Mimzy is actually a highly advanced form of [[Synthetic life|artificial life]] utilizing [[nanotechnology]] created by [[Intel Corporation|Intel]]. Emma tells everyone that Mimzy has a message from humanity's distant future. She explains that [[pollution]] has corrupted humanity's [[DNA]], and many toy rabbits like Mimzy have been sent to the past, since no natural life forms can survive time travel, but none have successfully returned. Mimzy is the last one remaining, but she is now beginning to disintegrate. The reason for the other Mimzys' deaths is that the "chosen ones" before Emma had no "engineers" (like Noah) to help build the bridge across time. Emma and Noah must build the bridge by using the other toys to activate a [[Time travel|time portal]], so that they can return Mimzy to the future with uncorrupted 21st-century human DNA that the people of the future can use to correct the damage to their DNA caused by ecological problems.

Despite attempts by the unbelieving FBI to prevent them, Noah and Emma use their psionic abilities to escape so that they can activate the portal. Before leaving, Mimzy absorbs a [[Tears|tear]] from Emma, thus providing the DNA required to restore humanity's corrupted DNA. Emma is almost sucked into the future with Mimzy, but Noah grabs Emma and pulls her out of the portal just as Mimzy is sent back to its own time. Following the transport, Noah's science teacher, who was present at the event, claims that he saw "numbers", a reference to a previous dream he had with numbers in it, which turned out to be the winning lottery numbers, but missed out because he never bought a ticket—thus exciting his fiancée about this second opportunity. Back in the future setting, Mimzy is returned to the future, and humans are finally able to restore their DNA and abandon their protective suits, and more importantly, repair the "mental corruption" that stripped most of them of their feelings toward each other. The teacher ends the story time and the children levitate and fly home. The world in their time has become a beautiful place, where humanity has integrated into the reconstructed [[ecosystem]]s.

The story ends in the current time, with Emma's teacher (Julia Arkos) asking if anyone did anything exciting over the weekend break. No one volunteers, so she calls on Emma at random, who merely smiles.

==The "Toys"==
The "toys" are high-tech devices sent from the future by a scientist to obtain uncorrupted DNA. They were sent in a box that has three compartments despite its outside appearance suggesting it has only one. The floor of the first compartment opens to access the second; the floor of the second compartment opens to access the third. The "toys" all have special abilities and are able to give Emma and Noah genius-level intelligence and psionic abilities of their own.
* '''Mimzy''' – an intelligent object based on nanotechnology, in the form of a white and beige stuffed rabbit, which can telepathically connect with certain individuals.
* '''Green card''' – A neon green-colored card with endless, moving light lines that form geometric patterns and make it seem fractured. To most people, it looks like a small, black rectangular slab of rock or slate. It can enable users to teleport objects after staring at it and observing their surroundings. It can also fuse with the blue blob to turn it into a Generator.
* '''Seashell''' – a white seashell-shaped object that allows the user to hear across longer distances and over a wider range of frequencies than normal. Noah uses this ability to decipher the correct sounds to manipulate spiders. Emma calls it "Mimzy's shell."
* '''Blue Blob''' – a blue blob that has no apparent abilities alone, but can fuse with the green card, turning it into a Generator.
* '''Spinners''' – a large black rock that can break into smaller rocks. The rocks can spin slightly off the ground, and when set spinning in a circle, they create a visible force-field that allows the user to view the time period from which the "toys" came.

The "toys" can be used to send Mimzy back to its original time period. To do this, the green card is first fused with the blue blob to create a "generator". Then, the "spinners" are used to create a force field. Finally, the "generator" must be used to create energy and blast it at the force field, giving it the power needed for the transmission. This can only be done once. After that, the remaining "toys" break and cannot be used again.

==Development and production==
''The Last Mimzy'' is loosely based on the classic [[science fiction]] [[short story]] "[[Mimsy Were the Borogoves]]" by [[Lewis Padgett]], the pen name of collaborators [[Henry Kuttner]] &amp; [[C. L. Moore]]; the story appeared in [[John W. Campbell]]'s magazine ''[[Astounding magazine|Astounding]]'' in 1943.&lt;ref name="sfsite"&gt;{{cite web | last = Norwood | first = Rick | title = Review: The Last Mimzy | work = | publisher = SF Site | year = 2007 | url = http://www.sfsite.com/04b/lm246.htm | accessdate = October 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the film's and short story's titles are derived from third line of the [[nonsense verse]] poem ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' in [[Lewis Carroll]]'s novel ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There]]''. The adapted screenplay is by [[Bruce Joel Rubin]] and [[Toby Emmerich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Movie Review: The Last Mimzy | work = | publisher = Hollywood.com, Inc. | date = | url = http://www.hollywood.com/review/The_Last_Mimzy/3671874 | accessdate = September 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129181150/http://www.hollywood.com/review/The_Last_Mimzy/3671874|archivedate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film’s production team also included editor Alan Heim and sound designer [[Dane Davis]].

==Reception==
===Box office===
''The Last Mimzy'' grossed nearly $21.5 million in North America and $6.1 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $27.5 million,&lt;ref name="TN"/&gt;

===Critical response===
Critical response to ''The Last Mimzy'' was mixed, and ranged from saying that it holds appeal for family audiences—especially children—to describing the storyline as distracting. On [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 54% based on 124 reviews, with an [[average score]] of  5.8/10. The site's critical consensus states, "''The Last Mimzy'' makes efforts to be a fun children's movie, but unsuccessfully juggles too many genres and subplots—eventually settling as an unfocused, slightly dull affair"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''The Last Mimzy'' (1998) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mimzy/ |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film had a score of 59 out of 100, based on 25 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-last-mimzy |title=''The Last Mimzy'' Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=March 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeannette Catsoulis of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it, "Wholesome, eager entertainment that doesn't talk down", agreeing with Ken Fox of [[TV Guide]]'s ''Movie Guide'' who said it was "a thoughtful and sincere interpretation that actually get kids and their guardians thinking and talking."&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Catsoulis | first = Jeannette | title = Box to the Future | work = | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = March 22, 2007 | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/2007/03/22/movies/23mimz.html | accessdate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Fox | first = Ken | title = The Last Mimzy | work = | publisher = [[TV Guide]] | date = | url = http://www.tvguide.com/movies/mimzy/review/286671 | accessdate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling the film "lightweight", the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' rated it a "small gem".&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Ringel Gillespie | first = Eleanor | title = A gentle fantasy that takes its cue from "E.T." | work =  | publisher = [[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] | date =  | url = http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=2301 | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071102001703/http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/movies/etc/getCriticReview.jspd?criticReviewId=2301 | archivedate = 2007-11-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Anderson | first = John | title = The Last Mimzy | work = | publisher = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = February 5, 2007 | url = http://www.variety.com/index.asp?layout=features2007&amp;content=jump&amp;jump=review&amp;dept=berlin&amp;nav=RBerlin&amp;articleid=VE1117932552&amp;cs=1 | accessdate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Stax | title = An overstuffed mess | work = | publisher = [[IGN]] | date = March 22, 2007 | url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/773/773895p1.html | accessdate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Chicago Sun-Times]]'' went as far as to say ''The Last Mimzy'' is an "emotionless empty shell" compared to ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web | last = Budasi | first = Teresa | title = 'Mimzy' whimsy comes up flimsy | work = | publisher = [[The Chicago Sun-Times]] | date = March 23, 2007 | url = http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/movies/309146,WKP-News-mimzy23.article | accessdate = October 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics diverge about the scientific validity of the film. Reviewer Susan Granger said, "There's some validity to the challenging science depicted in the film,{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} according to Brian Greene, Columbia University physics professor, and [[Susan Smalley]], UCLA neurobehavioral genetics professor";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Granger | first = Susan | title = The Last Mimzy | work=| publisher= Alliance of Women Film Journalists| date=March 22, 2007 | url = http://awfj.org/2007/03/22/susan-granger-reviews-the-last-mimzy/|accessdate=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; by contrast, Rick Norwood (The SF Site) writes, "The Last Mimzy has carefully expunged all of the ideas from the story, and replaced them with the New Age nonsense that passes for ideas these days. They have also taken a very personal story about one family and a box of toys from the future and turned it into an epic story in which childlike innocence saves the human race".&lt;ref name="sfsite"/&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack for the film was composed by [[Howard Shore]], the award-winning composer behind the scores of [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]]. Former [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]] also collaborated on a song called "[[Hello (I Love You)]]". "I think together we've come up with a song that captures the themes of the movie—the clash between humanity's best and worst instincts, and how a child's innocence can win the day", Roger Waters commented.&lt;ref name="rwlms"&gt;{{cite web|title="Hello (I Love you)" article|url=http://www.pr-inside.com/waters-records-film-tune-with-oscar-winning-r37315.htm|author=PR Inside|accessdate=January 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Umhlanga lagoon''' is a {{convert|26|ha}} [[nature reserve]] on the shore of the [[Indian Ocean]] at [[Umhlanga, KwaZulu-Natal|Umhlanga Rocks]], [[South Africa]].{{sfn|Bainbridge|2010|p=}} The reserve encloses the [[Ohlanga River]]'s lagoon and mouth.{{sfn|Ballard|1998|p=}} The forest forms a natural extension of the less accessible [[Hawaan Forest]], of which the greater part lies inland of the busy [[M4 road (Durban)|M4 road]]. The reserve trails start at a car park at the northern end of Lagoon Drive, Umhlanga.

The reserve has picnic sites, the remains of a prehistoric [[shell midden]]{{sfn|Beater|Maud|1963}} and walking trails,{{sfn|Ballard|1998|p=}} with a walkway and pedestrian bridge that span the lagoon.

At the mouth of the Ohlanga lagoon there is a popular but unofficial [[nudist beach]].{{sfn|Steele|2012|p=234}}&lt;ref name="phoe_Unco" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nort_uMhl" /&gt; Increased use of the area by non-nudist walkers and families resulted in complaints about nudism and antisocial behaviour.&lt;ref name ="Anthony2013" /&gt; The area was at one time a ‘no-go’ area, due to a serious crime problem.&lt;ref name ="Anthony2013" /&gt;
The use of this area by naturists is under threat as the [[eThekwini Metropolitan Municipality]] is planning a clamp down on nudity in Durban.&lt;ref name="time_Zipi" /&gt;

A '''universal translator''' is a device common to many [[science fiction]] works, especially on television. First described in [[Murray Leinster]]'s 1945 [[novella]] "[[First Contact (novelette)|First Contact]]",&lt;ref&gt;"Hic Rhodus, His Salta" by [[Robert Silverberg]], [[Asimov's Science Fiction]], January 2009, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; the translator's purpose is to offer an instant [[translation]] of any [[language]]. Technology companies are striving to develop a practical "universal" translator for common use.{{cn|date=April 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iamili.com/index.html|title=ili - The world's fastest offline translator for travelers|website=iamili.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a convention, it is used to remove the problem of translating between [[alien language]]s, unless that problem is essential to the plot. To translate a new language in every episode when a new species or culture is encountered would consume time (especially when most of these shows have a half-hour or one-hour format) normally allotted for plot development and would potentially, across many episodes, become repetitive to the point of annoyance. Occasionally, alien races can extrapolate the [[English grammar|rules of English]] from little speech and then immediately be fluent in it, making the translator unnecessary.

While a ''universal'' translator seems unlikely, due to the apparent need for telepathy, scientists continue to work towards similar real-world technologies involving small numbers of known languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author =  | title  = 'Tower of Babel' translator made | date = 2006-10-25 | work = [[BBC News]] | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6083994.stm | accessdate = 2008-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General==
As a rule, a universal translator is instantaneous, but if that language has never been recorded, there is sometimes a time delay until the translator can properly work out a translation, as is true of ''[[Star Trek]]''. Some writers seek greater plausibility by instead having computer translation that requires collecting a database of the new language, often by listening to radio transmissions.

The existence of a universal translator is sometimes problematic in film and television productions from a logical perspective (for example, aliens who still speak English when no universal translator is in evidence and all characters appear to hear the appropriately translated speech instead of the original speech, the ability to speak in the language when direct translation is possible), and requires some [[suspension of disbelief]] when characters' mouths move in sync with the translated words and not the original language; nonetheless, it removes the need for cumbersome and potentially extensive subtitles, and it eliminates the rather unlikely supposition that every other race in the galaxy has gone to the trouble of learning English.

== Fictional depictions ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}

===''Doctor Who''===
Using a [[telepathy|telepathic field]], the [[TARDIS]] automatically translates most comprehensible languages (written and spoken) into a language understood by its pilot and each of the crew members. The field also translates what they say into a language appropriate for that time and location (e.g., speaking the appropriate dialect of [[Latin]] when in ancient [[Rome]]). This system has frequently been featured as a main part of the show. The TARDIS, and by extension a number of its major systems, including the translator, are telepathically linked to its pilot, [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]].  None of these systems appear able to function reliably when the Doctor is incapacitated.  In "[[The Fires of Pompeii]]", when companion Donna Noble attempts to speak the local language directly, her words are humorously rendered into what sounds to a local like Welsh. One flaw of this translation process is that if the language that a word is being translated into does not have a concept for it, e.g, the Romans don't have a word or a general understanding of "volcano" as Mt. Vesuvius has not erupted yet.

===''Farscape''===
On the TV show ''[[Farscape]]'', John Crichton is injected with bacteria called translator microbes which function as a sort of universal translator. The microbes colonize the host's brainstem and translate anything spoken to the host, passing along the translated information to the host's brain.  This does not enable the injected person to speak other languages; they continue to speak their own language and are only understood by others as long as the listeners possess the microbes. The microbes sometimes fail to properly translate slang, translating it literally. Also, the translator microbes cannot translate the natural language of the alien Pilots or Diagnosans because every word in their language can contain thousands of meanings, far too many for the microbes to translate; thus Pilots must learn to speak in "simple sentences", while Diagnosans require interpreters. The implanted can learn to speak new languages if they want or to make communicating with non-injected individuals possible.  The crew of [[Moya (Farscape)|Moya]] learned English from Crichton, thereby being able to communicate with the non-implanted populace when the crew visited Earth. Some species, such as the [[List of races in Farscape#Kalish|Kalish]], cannot use translator microbes because their body rejects them, so they must learn a new language through their own efforts.

===''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy''===
{{further|List of races and species in The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Babel fish}}

In the universe of ''The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', universal translation is made possible by a small fish called a "babel fish". The fish is inserted into the auditory canal where it feeds off the mental frequencies of those speaking to its host. In turn it excretes a translation into the brain of its host.

The book remarks that, by allowing everyone to understand each other, the babel fish has caused more wars than anything else in the universe.

The book also explains that the babel fish could not possibly have developed naturally and therefore proves the existence of God as its creator, which in turn proves the non-existence of God. Since God needs faith to exist, and this proof dispels the need for faith, this therefore causes God to vanish "in a puff of logic".

===''Men in Black''===
The [[Men in Black (franchise)|''Men in Black'' franchise]] possess a universal translator, which, as [[Agent K]] explains in the first film, [[Men in Black (1997 film)|''Men in Black'']], they are not allowed to have because "human thought is so primitive, it's looked upon as an infectious disease in other galaxies."

===''Neuromancer''===
In [[William Gibson]]'s novel ''[[Neuromancer]]'', along with the other novels in his [[Sprawl trilogy]], ''[[Count Zero]]'' and ''[[Mona Lisa Overdrive]]'', devices known as "microsofts" are small chips plugged into "wetware" sockets installed behind the user's ear, giving them certain knowledge and/or skills as long as they are plugged in, such as the ability to speak another language.  (The name is a combination of the words "micro" and "soft", and is not named after the software firm [[Microsoft]].)

===''Star Control''===
In the ''[[Star Control]]'' computer game series, almost all races are implied to have universal translators; however, discrepancies between the ways aliens choose to translate themselves sometimes crop up and complicate communications. The [[VUX]], for instance, are cited as having uniquely advanced skills in linguistics and can translate human language long before humans are capable of doing the same to the VUX. This created a problem during the first contact between Vux and humans, in a starship commanded by Captain Rand. According to ''[[Star control#Star Control|Star Control: Great Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict]]'', Captain Rand is referred to as saying "That is one ugly sucker" when the image of a VUX first came onto his viewscreen. However, in ''[[Star Control II#Star Control II|Star Control II]]'', Captain Rand is referred to as saying "That is the ugliest freak-face I've ever seen" to his first officer, along with joking that the VUX name stands for Very Ugly Xenoform. It is debatable which source is canon. Whichever the remark, it is implied that the VUX's advanced Universal Translator technologies conveyed the exact meaning of Captain Rand's words. The effete VUX used the insult as an excuse for hostility toward humans.

Also, a new race called the [[Orz (Star Control)|Orz]] was introduced in ''Star Control II''. They presumably come from another dimension, and at first contact, the ship's computer says that there are many vocal anomalies in their language resulting from their referring to concepts or phenomena for which there are no equivalents in human language. The result is dialogue that is a patchwork of ordinary words and phrases marked with *asterisk pairs* indicating that they are loose translations of unique Orz concepts into human language, a full translation of which would probably require paragraph-long definitions. (For instance, the Orz refer to the human dimension as *heavy space* and their own as *Pretty Space*, to various categories of races as *happy campers* or *silly cows*, and so on.)

In the other direction, the [[Supox]] are a race portrayed as attempting to mimic as many aspects of other races' language and culture as possible when speaking to them, to the point of referring to their own planet as “[[Earth]],” also leading to confusion.

In ''Star Control III'', the [[K'tang|K’tang]] are portrayed as an intellectually inferior species using advanced technology they do not fully understand to intimidate people, perhaps explaining why their translators’ output is littered with misspellings and nonstandard usages of words, like threatening to “crushify” the player. Along the same lines, the [[Daktaklakpak]] dialogue is highly stilted and contains many numbers and mathematical expressions, implying that, as a mechanical race, their thought processes are inherently too different from humans’ to be directly translated into human language.

===''Stargate''===
In the television shows ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'', there are no personal translation devices used, and most alien and Human cultures on other planets speak English. The makers of the show have themselves admitted this on the main ''SG-1'' site, stating that this is to save spending ten minutes an episode on characters learning a new language (early episodes of ''SG-1'' revealed the difficulties of attempting to write such processes into the plot). In the season 8 finale of ''SG-1'', “[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius (Part II)]],” the characters go back in time to 3000 B.C. and one of them teaches English to the people there.

A notable exception to this rule are the [[Goa'uld|Goa’uld]], who occasionally speak [[Goa'uld language|their own language]] amongst themselves or when giving orders to their [[Jaffa]]. This is never subtitled, but occasionally a translation is given by a third character (usually [[Teal'c|Teal’c]] or [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]]), ostensibly for the benefit of the human characters nearby who do not speak Goa’uld.  The [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]] are also shown having their own language (apparently related to the [[Old Norse|Norse languages]]), although it is English played backwards. (See [[Asgard (Stargate)#Hermiod|Hermiod]]).

In contrast a major plot element of the original [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'']] film was that Daniel Jackson had to learn the language of the people of [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]] in the common way, which turned out to be derived from [[ancient Egypt]]ian. The language had been extinct on Earth for many millennia, but Jackson eventually realized that it was merely errors in pronunciation that prevented effective communication.

===''Star Trek''===
In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the universal translator was used by [[Ensign (Star Trek)|Ensign]] [[Hoshi Sato]], the communications officer on the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', to invent the linguacode matrix. It was supposedly first used in the late 22nd century on Earth for the instant translation of well-known Earth languages. Gradually, with the removal of language barriers, Earth's disparate cultures came to terms of universal peace. Translations of previously unknown languages, such as those of aliens, required more difficulties to be overcome. Like most other common forms of ''Star Trek'' technology (warp drive, transporters, etc.), the universal translator was probably developed independently on several worlds as an inevitable requirement of space travel; certainly the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcans]] had no difficulty communicating with humans upon making "[[Star Trek: First Contact|first contact]]" (although the Vulcans could have learned [[Standard English]] from monitoring Earth radio transmissions). The Vulcan ship that landed during [[first contact (science fiction)|First Contact]] was a survey vessel. The Vulcans had been surveying the humans for over a hundred years, when first contact actually occurred to T'Pol's great-grandmother, T'mir, in the episode "[[Carbon Creek (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Carbon Creek]]"; however, in ''Star Trek First Contact'' it is implied that they learned English by surveying the planets in the Solar System. Deanna Troi mentions the Vulcans have no interest in Earth as it is "too primitive", but the [[Prime Directive]] states not to interfere with pre-Warp species. The Vulcans only noticed the warp trail and came to investigate.

Improbably, the universal translator has been successfully used to interpret non-biological lifeform communication (in the ''Original Series'' episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]"). In the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' (''TNG'') episode "[[The Ensigns of Command]]", the translator proved ineffective with the language of the [[Sheliak]]s, so the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] had to depend on the aliens' interpretation of Earth languages. It is speculated that the Sheliak communicate amongst themselves in extremely complex [[legalese]]. The ''TNG'' episode "[[Darmok]]" also illustrates another instance where the universal translator proves ineffective and unintelligible, because the Tamarian language is too deeply rooted in local [[metaphor]].

Unlike virtually every other form of Federation technology, universal translators almost never break down. Although they were clearly in widespread use during [[Captain (Star Trek)|Captain]] [[James T. Kirk|Kirk]]'s time (inasmuch as the crew regularly communicated with species who could not conceivably have knowledge of Standard English), it is unclear where they were carried on personnel of that era.

The episode "[[Metamorphosis (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Metamorphosis]]" was the only time in which the device was actually seen. In the episode "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]" the Metrons supply Captain Kirk and the Gorn commander with a Translator-Communicator, allowing conversation between them to be possible. During Kirk's era, they were also apparently less perfect in their translations into [[Klingon language|Klingon]]. In the [[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country|sixth ''Star Trek'' film]], the characters are seen relying on print books in order to communicate with a Klingon military ship, since [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]] said that the Klingons would recognize the use of a Translator. Actress [[Nichelle Nichols]] reportedly protested this scene, as she felt that [[Uhura]], as communications officer during what was effectively a cold war, would be trained in [[fluency|fluent]] Klingon to aid in such situations. In that same movie during the trial scene of Kirk and McCoy before a Klingon judiciary, the Captain and the Doctor are holding communication devices while a Klingon (played by Todd Bryant) translates for them. The novelization of that movie provided a different reason for the use of books: sabotage by somebody working on the Starfleet side of the conspiracy uncovered by the crew in the story, but the novelization is not part of the [[Star Trek canon|''Star Trek'' canon]].

By the 24th century, universal translators are built into the communicator pins worn by [[Starfleet]] personnel, although there were instances when crew members (such as [[William Riker|Riker]] in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|Next Generation]]'' episode "[[First Contact (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|First Contact]]") spoke to newly encountered aliens even when deprived of their communicators. In the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode "[[The 37's (Star Trek: Voyager)|The 37's]]" the device apparently works among intra-species languages as well; after the ''Voyager'' crew discovers and revives eight humans abducted in 1937 (including [[Amelia Earhart]] and [[Fred Noonan]]) and held in [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]] since then, a Japanese Army officer expresses surprise that an Ohio farmer is apparently speaking Japanese, while the farmer is equally surprised to hear the soldier speaking English (the audience hears them all speaking English only, however). Certain Starfleet programs, such as the Emergency Medical Hologram, have universal translators encoded into the programming.

The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' says that the universal translator is an "extremely sophisticated computer program" which functions by "analyzing the patterns" of an unknown foreign language, starting from a speech sample of two or more speakers in conversation. The more extensive the conversational sample, the more accurate and reliable is the "translation matrix", enabling instantaneous conversion of verbal utterances or written text between the alien language and American English / Federation Standard.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Sternbach and Michael Okuda, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual (introduction by Gene Roddenberry)'', p. 101. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', we see a [[Cardassian]] universal translator at work. It takes some time to process an alien language, whose speakers are initially not understandable but as they continue speaking, the computer gradually learns their language and renders it into Standard English (also known as Federation Standard).

[[Ferengi]] customarily wear their universal translators as an implant in their ears. In the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (''DS9'') episode "[[Little Green Men (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Little Green Men]]", in which the show's regular Ferengi accidentally become the [[Roswell UFO incident|three aliens in Roswell]], the humans without translators are unable to understand the Ferengi (who likewise can not understand the English spoken by the human observers) until the Ferengi get their own translators working. Similarly, throughout all ''Trek'' series, a universal translator possessed by only one party can audibly broadcast the results within a limited range, enabling communication between two or more parties, all speaking different languages. The devices appear to be standard equipment on starships and space stations, where a communicator pin would therefore presumably not be strictly necessary.

Since the Universal Translator presumably does not physically affect the process by which the user's vocal cords (or alien equivalent) forms audible speech (i.e. the user is nonetheless speaking in his/her/its own language regardless of the listener's language), the listener apparently hears only the speaker's translated words and not the alien language that the speaker is actually, physically articulating; the unfamiliar oratory is therefore not only translated but somehow replaced. The universal translator is often used in cases of contact with pre-warp societies such as in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Who Watches the Watchers]]", and its detection could conceivably lead to a violation of the Prime Directive. Therefore, logically there must be some mechanism by which the lips of the speaker are perceived to be in sync with the words spoken. No explanation of the mechanics of this function appears to have been provided, the viewer is required to suspend disbelief enough to overcome the apparent limitation.

{{Contradicts other|date=June 2012|1=Machine translation}}
[[Microsoft]] is developing its own translation technology, for incorporation into many of their software products and services. Most notably this includes real time translation of video calls with [[Skype Translator]]. As of October 2015, [[Microsoft Translator]] supports over 50 languages and can translate video calls between English, French, German, Chinese (Mandarin), Italian, and Spanish.

In 2015, [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ms.blabber.messenger Blabber Messenger] was developed – a speech translator for 23 languages.

SpeechGear, a Minnesota company, has produced a stand-alone speech translator called Compadre and a web-based translator called Streamer (www.streamer.center).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/one-step-closer-to-a-universal-translator/ |first=Michelle |last=Thatcher |date=January 10, 2008 |title=One step closer to a universal translator |work=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Google]] announced that it was developing a translator. Using a voice recognition system and a database, a robotic voice will recite the translation in the desired language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = | title  = Google's Next Venture: Universal Translator  | date = 2010-02-08  | work = PC World  | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/188777  | accessdate = 2010-02-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Google's stated aim is to translate the entire world's information. Roya Soleimani, a spokesperson for Google, said during a 2013 interview demonstrating the translation app on a smartphone, "You can have access to the world's languages right in your pocket... The goal is to become that ultimate Star Trek computer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Alison van Diggelen  | title  = From Babel to Star Trek: The Quest for Translation  | date = 2013-08-05  | work = KQED  | url = http://www.californiareport.org/archive/R201308050850/b#sthash.sib90ihU.dpuf  | accessdate = 2013-10-02  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The [[United States Army]] has also developed a two-way translator for use in Iraq.  TRANSTAC (Spoken Language Communication and Translation System for Tactical Use), though, only focuses on Arabic-English translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | author = Lucian Dorneanu  | title  = US Army Develops Automatic Translators for Iraq Soldiers  | date = 2007-07-24  | work = Softpedia  | url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/US-Army-Wants-Automatic-Translators-for-Iraq-Soldiers-60817.shtml  | accessdate = 2010-02-08  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The United States Army has scrapped the TRANSTAC Program and is developing in conjunction with DARPA, the BOLT (Broad Operational Language Translation) in its place.

In February 2010, a communications software called VoxOx launched a two-way translator service for instant messaging, SMS, email and social media titled the VoxOx Universal Translator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title  = VoxOx Adds Native Translation to Differentiate from Skype, Google Voice  | author = Clint Boulton  | date = 2010-02-16  | url = http://www.eweek.com/c/a/VOIP-and-Telephony/VoxOx-Adds-Native-Translation-to-Differentiate-From-Skype-Google-Voice-575273/  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It enables two people to communicate instantly with each other while both typing in their native languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | title  = VoxOx Real-Time Language Translation For SMS/Chat/Email/Twitter Makes You Fluent Across the Globe  | author = Brian Barrett  | date = 2010-02-16  | url = https://gizmodo.com/5472968/voxox-real+time-language-translation-for-smschatemailtwitter-makes-you-fluent-across-the-globe  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18988">A '''visible minority''' ({{Lang-fr|minorité visible}}) is defined by the [[Government of Canada]] as "persons, other than aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/eng/concepts/definitions/minority01a|title=Classification of visible minority|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|last=Canada|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used primarily as a demographic category by [[Statistics Canada]], in connection with that country's [[Employment equity (Canada)|Employment Equity]] policies.  The qualifier "visible" was chosen by the Canadian authorities as a way to single out newer immigrant minorities from both Aboriginal Canadians and other "older" minorities distinguishable by [[languages of Canada|language]] ([[Canadian French|French]] vs. [[Canadian English|English]]) and [[religion in Canada|religion]] ([[Catholicism in Canada|Catholics]] vs. [[Orange Order in Canada|Protestants]]), which are "invisible" traits (cf. the categories "[[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]]" and "[[white ethnic]]" in a US context).

The term visible [[Minority group|minority]] is sometimes used as a euphemism for "[[non-white]]". This is incorrect, in that the government definitions differ: Aboriginal people are not considered to be visible minorities, but are not necessarily white either. Also, some groups that are defined as "white" in the United States census, such as [[Middle Eastern Americans]], are defined as "visible minorities" in the official Canadian definition. In some cases, members of "visible minorities" may be visually indistinguishable from the majority population and/or may form a [[majority minority]] population locally (as is the case in some parts of Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal).

Since the reform of [[History of Canadian nationality law|Canada's immigration laws in the 1960s]], immigration has been primarily of peoples from areas other than Europe, many of whom are visible minorities within Canada.  Legally, members of visible minorities are defined by the [[Employment equity (Canada)|Canadian Employment Equity Act]] as "persons, other than [[Aboriginal peoples of Canada|Aboriginal people]], who are non-[[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] in race or non-[[white people|white]] in [[skin colour|colour]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/reference/reportsandguides/visible-minorities.cfm Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide, 2006 Census] from StatsCan&lt;/ref&gt; The United States' equivalent classification—"[[people of color]]"—is similar, but also includes [[Native Americans in the United States|Indigenous Americans]]. Historically, it specifically referred to persons of mixed race, particularly of African and European ancestry.

==In Canada==
Over seven million [[Canadians]] identified as a member of a visible [[minority group]] in the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 Census]], accounting for 22.3% of the total population.  This was an increase from the [[Canada 2011 Census|2011 Census]], when visible minorities accounted for 19.1% of the total population;   from the [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]], when visible minorities accounted for 16.2% of the total population;  from [[Canada 2001 Census|2001]], when visible minorities accounted for 13.4% of the total population; from [[Canada 1996 Census|1996]] when the proportion was 11.2%; and over [[Canada 1991 Census|1991]] (9.4%) and [[Canada 1981 Census|1981]] (4.7%). In 1961, the visible minority population was less than 1%. The increase represents a significant shift in [[demographics of Canada|Canada's demographics]] related to increased immigration since the advent of its multiculturalism policies.

More than 68.8% of Canadian visible minority population are foreign-born, 27.7% are children of immigrants. Less than 4% are third-generation or beyond. Less than 3,000 Canadians are third-generation and visible minority and over 75 years old, they are mainly [[Black Nova Scotians]].

Based upon the annual immigration intake into Canada since the last census in 2006, accompanied by the steady increase in the visible minority population within Canada due to the higher fertility levels of minority females when compared to Canadian women of European origin, researchers estimate that by 2012, approximately 19.56% of the population in Canada will be individuals of non-European (visible minority) origin. The Aboriginal population within Canada, based upon projections for the same year (i.e. 2012), is estimated to be 4.24%. Hence, at least 23.8% of Canada's population in 2012 were individuals of visible minority and Aboriginal heritage. Projections also indicate that by 2031, the visible minority population in Canada will make up about 33% of the nation's population, given the steady increase in the non-European component of the Canadian population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2010/03/09/statscan-minority.html "Minorities to rise significantly by 2031"], cbc.ca&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/TopStories/20100309/visible_minorities_100309/ "Visible minorities to make up 1/3 of population by 2031"]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, CTV, March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the provinces, [[British Columbia]] had the highest proportion of visible minorities, representing 30.3% of its population, followed by [[Ontario]] at 29.3%, [[Alberta]] at 23.5% and [[Manitoba]] at 17.5%. In the 2006 census, [[South Asia]]n Canadians superseded [[Chinese Canadian|ethnic Chinese]] as Canada's largest visible minority group. In 2006, Statistics Canada estimated that there were 1.3 million South Asian people in Canada, compared with 1.2 million Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/04/02/stats-immigration.html One in 6 Canadians is a visible minority], CBC, 2 Apr 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, there were approximately 1.9 million South Asian Canadians, representing 5.6% of the country's population, followed by [[Chinese Canadians]] (4.6%) and [[Black Canadians]] (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/dt-td/Rp-eng.cfm?LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=0&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=110531&amp;PRID=10&amp;PTYPE=109445&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2017&amp;THEME=120&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=|title=Visible Minority (15), Generation Status (4), Age (12) and Sex (3) for the Population in Private Households of Canada, Provinces and Territories, Census Metropolitan Areas and Census Agglomerations, 2016 Census - 25% Sample Data|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Statistics|website=www12.statcan.gc.ca|language=en|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislative versus operational definitions==

According to the Employment Equity Act of 1995, the definition of visible minority is:
{{quotation|
"members of visible minorities" means persons, other than aboriginal peoples, who are non-Caucasian in race or non-white in colour;&lt;ref&gt;Employment Equity Act (1995, c. 44) [http://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/E-5.401/page-2.html#anchorbo-ga:s_3 Act current to Oct 20th, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
This definition can be traced back to the 1984 Report of the [[Rosalie Abella|Abella]] Commission on Equality in Employment,. The Commission described the term visible minority as an "ambiguous categorization", but for practical purposes interpreted it to mean "visibly non-white".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolley|first=Frances|title=Visible Minorities: Distinctly Canadian|url=http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2013/05/visible-minorities-distinctly-canadian.html|publisher=Worthwhile Canadian Initiative|accessdate=May 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian government uses an [[operational definition]] by which it identifies the following groups as visible minorities: "Chinese, South Asian, Black, Filipino, Latin American, Southeast Asian, Arab, West Asian, Korean, Japanese, Visible minority, n.i.e. ('n.i.e.' means 'not included elsewhere'), and Multiple visible minority".&lt;ref&gt;"Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide," 2006 Census [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/rp-guides/visible_minority-minorites_visibles-eng.cfm#Classifications Statcan]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, a few exceptions are applied to some groups. According to the ''Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide'' of the 2006 Census, the exception is:
{{quotation|
"In contrast, in accordance with employment equity definitions, persons who reported 'Latin American' and 'White,' 'Arab' and 'White,' or 'West Asian' and 'White' have been excluded from the visible minority population. Likewise, persons who reported 'Latin American,' 'Arab' or 'West Asian' and who provided a European write-in response such as 'French' have been excluded from the visible minority population as well. These persons are included in the 'Not a visible minority' category. However, persons who reported 'Latin American,' 'Arab' or 'West Asian' and a non-European write-in response are included in the visible minority population."&lt;ref&gt;''Visible Minority Population and Population Group Reference Guide,'' 2006 Census - Catalogue no. 97-562-GWE2006003 [http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2006/ref/rp-guides/visible_minority-minorites_visibles-eng.cfm#Classifications Statcan]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
The term "non-white" is used in the wording of the Employment Equity Act and in employment equity questionnaires distributed to applicants and employees. This is intended as a shorthand phrase for those who are in the Aboriginal and/or visible minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mentzer, M. S. |date=January 2002 |title=The Canadian experience with employment equity legislation |journal=International Journal of Value-Based Management |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=35–50 |doi=10.1023/A:1013021402597 |issn=0895-8815 |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
The classification "visible minorities" has attracted controversy, both nationally and from abroad. The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination#Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] has stated that they have doubts regarding the use of this term since this term may be considered objectionable by certain minorities and recommended an evaluation of this term. In response, the Canadian government made efforts to evaluate how this term is used in Canadian society through commissioning of scholars and open workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/cerd/docs/A.67.18%20English.pdf|website=United Nations|publisher=United Nations: Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism stems from the semantic applicability of the classification. In some cases, members of "visible minorities" may be neither "visually" discernible from the majority population nor form a "minority", at least locally. For instance, many [[Latin American Canadians|Latin Americans living in Canada]] self-identify as [[White Latin Americans]] and are visually indistinguishable from [[White Canadians]]. Moreover, some members of "visible minorities" may form a [[majority minority]] population locally (as is the case in most parts of Vancouver and Toronto). Since 2008, census data and media reports have suggested that the "visible minorities" label no longer makes sense in some large Canadian cities, due to immigration trends in recent decades. For example, "visible minorities" comprise the ''majority'' of the population in [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], [[Coquitlam]], [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]], [[Ajax, Ontario|Ajax]], [[Burnaby]], [[Greater Vancouver Electoral Area A, British Columbia|Greater Vancouver A]], [[Mississauga]], [[Surrey, British Columbia|Surrey]], [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] and [[Brampton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Visible minorities the new majority| author=Hamilton, Graeme| work=National Post| date=2008-04-03| url = https://nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=417736|accessdate =2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, such cities or districts are described as [[majority-minority]].  But, the term "visible minority" is used for the administration of the Employment Equity Act, and refers to its statistical basis in Canada as a whole and not any particular region.

Yet another criticism of the label concerns the composition of "visible minorities". Critics have noted that the groups comprising "visible minorities" have little in common with each other, as they include both disadvantaged groups and [[model minority|groups who are not economically disadvantaged]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Affirmative action and ethnic inequality in Canada: The Impact of the Employment Equity Act of 1986|journal=Ethnic Groups| date= 1992|first=Marc S.|last=Mentzer|author2=John L.

[[File:Onthemorningtbutts1.jpg|thumb|''The Descent of Peace'', 1803-1817, most likely c. 1815]]

'''[[William Blake]]''' drew and painted illustrations for [[John Milton]]'s nativity ode '''''[[On the Morning of Christ's Nativity]]''''' between 1803 and 1815. A total of 16 illustrations are extant: two sets of six [[watercolour]]s each, and an additional four drawings in pencil. 

The dating of the sets is unknown, as is Blake's intended sequence for the illustrations. The two sets of watercolours are known as the "Butts set" and the "Thomas set", after their respective patrons, or as the "Huntington set" and the "Whitworth set" after the [[Huntington Library]] and the [[Whitworth Art Gallery]], which now hold the sets in their collections.

==Provenance==
There is little record of the [[provenance]] of the Thomas set or the Butts set before 1852 and 1872, which has led to disputes about the dating. What is known is that the "Thomas set" was commissioned by the Reverend Joseph Thomas,&lt;ref name = Butlin389&gt; Butlin 389&lt;/ref&gt; who had also commissioned illustrations to Milton's ''[[Comus (poem)|Comus]]'' and ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' from Blake. No contract for the commission is extant, but the commissioning probably took place in 1809, which is the year in which the illustrations were completed.&lt;ref name = Butlin389 /&gt; Blake was eager to accept the commission, according to G. E. Bentley, because "Milton illustrations were a kind of work which Blake could not resist."&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2003 p. 357&lt;/ref&gt; They presumably stayed in the Revd Thomas's family until they were bought at [[Sotheby's]] from an anonymous seller in 1872. By 1876 they were in the collection of J.E. Taylor, who gave them to the Whitworth in 1892.&lt;ref name = Butlin389 /&gt; 

Even less is known about the dates of composition for the "Butts set" - between 1811 and 1820, Blake created at least thirty three designs for Thomas Butts, which included the illustrations of ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2003 p. 288&lt;/ref&gt; Later, they passed from Butts to his son, who sold them at Sotheby's in 1852, passed through several more hands, were sold at [[Christie's]] in 1912, and in 1916 were sold to [[Henry E. Huntington|Henry Huntington]].&lt;ref&gt; Butlin 393&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Onthemorningthomas4.jpg|thumb|''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'', watercolour, 25 x 19.3 cm, 1809. The figure of Apollo in this illustration is a combination of the [[Apollo Belvedere]] and the [[Laocoön]]]]

==Dating and sequence==
The illustrations themselves do not make the dating any easier- the edges of the "Thomas set" were trimmed before sale at Sotheby's, leaving "18" or "180" on most of the sheets.&lt;ref name=Butlin390&gt;Butlin 390&lt;/ref&gt; Only ''The Night of Peace'' bears the full date of 1809.&lt;ref name= Butlin390 /&gt; The Butts set is entirely undated- dates from 1803 to 1817 have been proposed for it.&lt;ref name = Werner117&gt;Werner 117&lt;/ref&gt; Behrendt argues that the Butts set predates the Thomas set by six years,&lt;ref&gt;Behrendt, Stephen C. ''Blake's Illustrations to Milton's Nativity Ode'', in [[Philological Quarterly]], LV, Winter 1976, pp. 65-95. Quoted in Butlin, 390&lt;/ref&gt; and Collins Baker and R.R. Wark place it in 1809, but earlier than the Thomas set.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. H. Collins Baker]], enlarged and revised by R.R. Wark, ''Catalogue of William Blake's Drawings and Paintings in the Huntington Library''. First published 1938. Quoted in Butlin, 390&lt;/ref&gt;

The sequence of the illustrations is also a topic of scholarly dispute: the mountings of the Thomas set were inscribed on their backs with numbers 1-6, but these were added during or after the 1872 Sotheby's sale, and so are unlikely to follow Blake's intended order.&lt;ref name=Butlin390 /&gt;  This "original" order ran thus: 

#''The Descent of Peace''
#''The Annunciation to the Shepherds''
#''The Flight of Moloch''
#''The Old Dragon''
#''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods''
#''The Night of Peace'' 

[[Geoffrey Keynes]] placed them in 1-6-2-3-4-5 order, so that ''The Night of Peace'' followed ''The Descent of Peace'', because of their similar subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, Geoffrey. ''Notes on the Illustrations'', in ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity, Milton's Hymn with Illustrations by William Blake'', 1923, p. 31-2. Quoted in Butlin, 390 &lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Butlin|Butlin]], and nearly all subsequent scholars, have rejected this, as much commentary has centered upon Blake's use of similar images to frame the sequence. Butlin instead rearranges the "original" sequence as 1-2-4-5-3-6, moving ''The Flight of Moloch'' to second to last, so that it matches the order of corresponding verses in Milton's poem.&lt;ref name=Butlin390 /&gt; Dunbar also follows Butlin's order. Behrendt adopts a 1-2-5-3-4-6 order, seeing a thematic progression from the destruction of classical aesthetics, to the old testament cruelty of Moloch (who resembles Blake's [[Urizen]]), to [[Satan]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Behrendt 40-41&lt;/ref&gt; This order is followed by Werner in her ''Blake's Vision of the Poetry of Milton''.

==Analysis==
[[File:Onthemorningthomas5.jpg|thumb|''The Flight of Moloch'', watercolour, 25.7 x 19.7 cm. 1809]]
Blake's literary debt to Milton is key to understanding his illustrations of the earlier poet's writings. In general, ''[[Milton: a Poem]]'' is a guide to Blake's idea of Milton: that he possessed true spiritual vision, but fell by his adherence to the moralistic and repressive tenets of [[puritan|puritanism]] and by his preference for the cruel and distant [[Jehovah]] of the [[Old testament]] over the redemptive figure of [[Christ]]. In that regard the ''Nativity Ode'' is to Blake the rebirth of Milton's poetry into the creative imagination of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;Behrendt 39&lt;/ref&gt; Blake also sees a return to prophetic, Christian ideals of poetry, rather than the "pagan" [[Classicism|classical aesthetic]] represented in ''The Overthrow of Apollo and the Pagan Gods'' by the figure of [[Apollo]], who is modeled on the [[Apollo Belvedere]].&lt;ref&gt;Behrendt 40&lt;/ref&gt;  

Blake's [[William Blake's prophetic books|prophetic book]] ''[[Europe: a Prophecy]]'' was especially influenced by ''On the Morning of Christ's Nativity''. &lt;ref&gt;Frye 262&lt;/ref&gt; In that poem, the messianic [[Orc (Blake)|Orc]], a symbol of pure creative energy, rises against the repressive institutions of Church and state. Orc is part of a doomed cycle- his rebellion is inevitably countered by the increased institutional repression of [[Urizen]].&lt;ref name = Werner117 /&gt; ''Europe'' in that light is seen as a pessimistic parody of Milton's poem.&lt;ref&gt;Werner 115&lt;/ref&gt; Orc is often associated with fire, and the closest parallel with him is found in ''The Flight of Moloch'', where a child is about to be given to the [[Moloch|god of sacrifice]]. The similarity of the orifice that frames the child to the shape of the stable in the other illustrations underscores the purpose of Christ's birth, and foreshadows the [[Harrowing of Hell|harrowing of hell]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner 130&lt;/ref&gt;    

The illustrations emphasize the simultaneous occurrence of the events they depict by the presence of the stable in almost every image, and by framing the set with two very similar images that focus on the peaceful victory of Christ over darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 92&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Descent of Peace'' also has [[Neo-Platonism|neo-platonic]] implications- it represents the descent of the soul into the body, which is symbolized by the cramped stable. &lt;ref&gt;Dunbar 94&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women in journalism''' are individuals who participate in [[journalism]]. As journalism became a [[professionalization|profession]], women were restricted by custom from access to journalism occupations, and faced significant discrimination within the profession.  Nevertheless, women operated as editors, reporters, sports analysts and journalists even before the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Brown, "The Emergence of Females as Professional Journalists," HistoryReference.org [http://www.historyreference.org/library/refwomen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Currently==

In 2017, with the [[#MeToo]] movement, a number of notable female journalists came forward to report sexual harassment in their workplaces.&lt;ref name="2017-December-Vox"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/identities/2017/12/18/16780424/women-journalism-career-harassment|title=When harassment drives women out of journalism|date=December 18, 2017|website= [[Vox Media|Vox]]|access-date=December 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lauren Wolfe, an investigative journalist and the director of the Women's Media Center's Women Under Siege program, female journalists face particular risks over their male colleagues, and are more likely to experience [[online harassment]] or [[sexual assault]] on the job.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"/&gt;

According to a report released on December 20, 2017 by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], in 2017, 42 journalists were killed because of their work worldwide, with 81 percent of those journalists male. This was slightly lower than the historical average of 93 percent of men journalists killed annually for their work, with ''[[The Intercept]]'' theorizing that the drop was perhaps due to women being assigned more frequently to dangerous locales.&lt;ref name="2017-December-TI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theintercept.com/2017/12/21/an-unusually-deadly-year-for-women-journalists-around-the-world-report-finds/|title=An Unusually Deadly Year for Women Journalists Around the World, Report Finds |date=December 20, 2017|website= [[The Intercept]]|access-date=December 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==
{{Main|Safety of Journalists}}
'''Safety of journalists''' is the ability for [[journalist]]s and media professionals to receive, produce and share information without facing physical or moral threats. Women journalists also face increasing dangers such as sexual assault, "whether in the  form  of  a  targeted  sexual  violation,  often  in  reprisal  for  their  work;  mob-related sexual violence aimed against journalists covering public events; or the sexual abuse of journalists in detention or captivity. Many of these crimes are not reported as a result of powerful cultural and professional stigmas."&lt;ref&gt;The United Nations Plan of Action on the Safety of Journalists and Issues of Impunity, 2012, https://en.unesco.org/sites/default/files/un-plan-on-safety-journalists_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=World Trends Report in Freedom of Expression and Media Development Global Report 2017/2018|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002610/261065e.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Threats ===
Women journalists, whether they are working in an insecure context, or in a [[newsroom]], face risks of physical assault, [[sexual harassment]], [[sexual assault]], [[rape]] and even murder. They are vulnerable to attacks not only from those attempting to silence their coverage, but also from sources, colleagues and others.&lt;ref&gt;Lanza, Edison. 2017. Silenced Zones: Highly Dangerous Areas for the Exercise of Freedomof Expression. Office for the Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression of the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Available at http://www.oas.org/en/iachr/expression/docs/publications/ZONAS_SILENCIADAS_ENG.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2014 global survey of nearly a thousand journalists, initiated by the International News Safety Institute (INSI) in partnership with the [[International Women's Media Foundation|International Women's Media Foundation]] (IWMF) and with the support of UNESCO, found that nearly two-thirds of women who took part in the survey had experienced intimidation, threats or abuse in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;International Media Women’s Foundation and International News Safety Institute 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the period from 2012 through 2016, UNESCO's Director-General denounced the killing of 38 women journalists, representing 7 per cent of all journalists killed.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-condemns-killing-of-journalists&lt;/ref&gt;  The percentage of journalists killed who are women is significantly lower than their overall representation in the media workforce. This large gender gap is likely partly the result of the persistent under-representation of women reporting from war-zones or insurgencies or on topics such as politics and crime.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Janet, Nick Mosdell, and James Griffiths. 2016. Gender, Risk and Journalism. Journalism Practice 10 (7): 902–916&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 2017 report of the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] outlines a way forward for a gender-sensitive approach to strengthening the safety of women journalists.&lt;ref&gt;UN General Assembly. 2017.

Available at https://documents-dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/GEN/N17/245/44/PDF/N1724544.pdf?OpenElement.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the [[Council of Europe]]’s Committee of Ministers adopted recommendation CM/Rec(2016)4 on the protection of journalism and safety of journalists and other media actors, in particular noting the gender-specific threats that many journalists face and calling for urgent, resolute and systematic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Council of Europe. 2016.

=== Online harassment ===
Research undertaken by [[Pew Research Center]] indicated that 73 per cent of adult internet users in the [[United States]] had seen someone be harassed in some way online and 40 per cent had personally experienced it, with young women being particularly vulnerable to sexual harassment and [[stalking]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Maeve, Lee Rainie, Aaron Smith, Cary Funk, Amanda Lenhart, and Mary Madden. 2014. Online Harassment. Pew Research Center. Available at http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/10/22/onlineharassment/.&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of more than two million tweets performed by the [[think tank]] [[Demos (U.S. think tank)|Demos]] found that women journalists experienced approximately three times as many abusive comments as their male counterparts on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref&gt;Demos. 2014. Demos: male celebrities receive more abuse on Twitter than women. Demos. Available at https://www.demos.co.uk/press-release/demos-malecelebrities-receive-more-abuse-on-twitterthan-women-2/.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Guardian]] surveyed the 70 million comments recorded on its website between 1999 and 2016 (only 22,000 of which were recorded before 2006). Of these comments, approximately 1.4 million (approximately two per cent) were blocked for abusive or disruptive behavior. Of the 10 staff journalists who received the highest levels of abuse and ‘dismissive [[Internet troll|trolling]]’, eight were women.&lt;ref&gt;Gardiner, Becky, Mahana Mansfield, Ian Anderson, Josh Holder, Daan Louter, and Monica Ulmanu. 2016.

The INSI and IWMF survey found that more than 25 per cent of ‘verbal, written and/or physical intimidation including threats to family and friends’ took place online.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, Alana, and Hannah Storm. 2014. Violence and Harassment Against Women in the News Media: A Global Picture. International Women’s Media Foundation &amp; International News Safety Institute.

The [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (OSCE) organized an expert meeting titled ‘New Challenges to Freedom of Expression: Countering Online Abuse of Female Journalists’ which produced a publication of the same title that includes the voices of journalists and academics on the realities of online abuse of women journalists and how it can be combated.&lt;ref&gt;Mijatović, Dunja. 2016.

==By country==

===Canada===
[[Sophia Dalton]] published the newspaper ''The Patriot'' in [[Toronto]] in 1840-48,&lt;ref&gt;I. R. Dalton, "SIMMS, SOPHIA," in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 8, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed 16 August 2017, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/simms_sophia_8E.html.&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 1851 by [[Mary Herbert (1832-1872)|Mary Herbert]], who became the first woman publisher in [[Nova Scotia]] when publishing the ''Mayflower, or Ladies’ Acadian Newspaper''. 
&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis R. Blakeley, "HERBERT, MARY ELIZA," in Dictionary of Canadian Biography, vol. 10, University of Toronto/Université Laval, 2003–, accessed 14 June 2016, http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/herbert_mary_eliza_10E.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian born [[Florence MacLeod Harper]] was notable for her work with photographer Donald Thompson covering both the Eastern front in World War One and the February revolution in St Petersburg 1917 for Leslie's weekly. Her subsequent books, Bloostained Russia and 'Runaway Russia', were some of the first Western accounts of events.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alexanderpalace.org/thompson/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Denmark===
In Denmark, women became editors early on by inheriting papers form their spouses, the earliest examples being [[Sophie Morsing]], who inherited ''Wochenliche Zeitung'' from her husband in 1658 and managed the paper as editor, and Catherine Hake, who inherited the paper ''Europäische Wochentliche Zeitung'' as widow the following year – as far as it is known, though, these women did not write in their papers.&lt;ref&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen: Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The first woman in Denmark who published articles in Danish papers were the writer [[Charlotte Baden]], who occasionally participated in the weekly ''MorgenPost'' from 1786 to 1793.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;John Chr. Jørgensen:Da kvinderne blev journalister. Københavns Universitet. Det Humanistiske Fakultet. Københavns Universitet. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1845, Marie Arnesen became the first woman to participate in the public political debate in a Danish newspaper, and from the 1850s, it became common for women to participate in public debate or contribute with an occasional article: among them being [[Caroline Testman]], who wrote travel articles, and [[Athalia Schwartz]], who was a well known public media figure through her participation in the debate in the papers between 1849 and 1871.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In the 1870s, the women's movement started and published papers of their own, with women editors and journalists.

It was not until the 1880s, however, that women begun to be professionally active in the Danish press, and [[Sofie Horten]] (1848–1927) likely became the first woman who supported herself as a professional journalist when she was employed at ''Sorø Amtstidende'' in 1888.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; An important pioneer was [[Loulou Lassen]], employed at the ''[[Politiken]]'' in 1910, the first female career journalist and a pioneer female journalist within science, also arguably the first nationally well known woman in the profession. In 1912, eight women were members of the reporter's union ''[[Københavns Journalistforbund]]'' (Copenhagen Association of Journalists), five in the club ''Journalistforeningen i København'' (Journalist Association of Copenhagen) and a total of 35 women employed as journalists in Denmark.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Finland===

The Swedish journalist and editor [[Catharina Ahlgren]] was most likely the first female journalist and editor in the then Swedish province of Finland when she published her own essay paper, the Swedish language ''Om att rätt behaga'' in 1782, which was also among the very first papers in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;Henrika Zilliacus-Tikkanen: När könet började skriva – Kvinnor i finländsk press 1771–1900 (English: When gender started to write – women in Finnish media 1771–1900)&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the first female journalist has been referred to as [[Fredrika Runeberg]], who wrote poems and articles in ''[[Helsingfors Morgonblad]]'' under the name of her spouse [[Johan Ludvig Runeberg]] in the 1830s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The first woman in Finland to work as a journalist in Finland under her own name was [[Adelaïde Ehrnrooth]], who wrote in ''[[Helsingfors Dagblad]]'' and ''[[Hufvudstadsbladet]]'' for 35 years from 1869 onward.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===France===
[[Anne-Marguerite Petit du Noyer]] (1663–1719) has been referred to as one of the most famous early 18th century female journalists in Europe. Her reports of the negotiations leading to the [[Peace of Utrecht]] were read all over Europe and admired for the distinction with which she reported on scandal and gossip.&lt;ref&gt;Regine Reynolds-Cornell: Fiction and reality in the Mémoires of the notorious Anne-Marguerite Petit DuNoyer (Tübingen: Narr 1999). {{ISBN|3-8233-5527-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
The first female journalist in Norway was [[Birgithe Kühle]], who published the local paper ''Provincial-Lecture'' in [[Bergen]] between 1794 and 1795.&lt;ref&gt;Bra böckers världshistoria / [chefredaktör: Kenneth Åström ; redaktion: Gil Dahlström ...]. Bd 10, Två revolutioner : 1750–1815 / av Kåre Tønnesson ; [översättning: Ingrid Emond ...] Malmö Bra Böcker 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th-century, women participated with articles in the press, especially within the culture sections and a translators, notably [[Magdalene Thoresen]], who has by some been referred to as an early female journalist: from 1856, [[Marie Colban]] (1814–1884) lived in Paris, from where she wrote articles for ''[[Morgenbladet]]'' and ''[[Illustreret Nyhedsblad]]'', for which she can be regarded as the first female foreign correspondent in the Norwegian press.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other pioneers were [[Wilhelmine Gulowsen]], editor of the culture paper ''Figaro'' in 1882–83, and [[Elisabeth Schøyen]], editor of the family magazine ''Familie-Musæum'' in 1878 and journalist of ''[[Bergensposten]]'' and ''[[Aftenposten]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth Schøyen. (2009, 14. februar). I Store norske leksikon. Hentet 16. November 2015 fra https://snl.no/Elisabeth_Sch%C3%B8yen.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegian newspaper press in the capital of [[Oslo]] had their first two female reporters with [[Marie Mathisen]] in ''[[Dagsposten]]'' in 1897, and [[Anna Hvoslef]] in ''[[Aftenposten]]'' in 1898: the former became the first female member of the [[Oslo Journalistklubb]] (Oslo Journalist Association) in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;Kvaale, Reidun: Kvinner i norsk presse gjennom 150 år. Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
[[File:Beata Chmielowska-Olech beax.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polish television news anchor Beata Chmielowska-Olech, 2007]]
In 1822, [[Wanda Malecka]] (1800–1860) became the first woman newspaper publisher in Poland when she published the ''Bronisława'' (followed in 1826–31 by the ''Wybór romansów''); she had in 1818-20 previously been the editor of the handwritten publication ''Domownik'', and was also a pioneer woman journalist, publishing articles in ''Wanda''.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Rogalski, Historya literatury Polskiéj, Volume 2, Nakładem Michała Glücksberga, księgarza, 1871. pp. 590–591&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
[[File:Wendela Hebbe.jpg|thumb|[[Wendela Hebbe]], drawing by [[Maria Röhl]] 1842.]]
In Sweden, [[Maria Matras]], known as "N. Wankijfs Enka", published the paper ''Ordinarie Stockholmiske Posttijdender'' in 1690–1695, but it is unknown if she wrote in the paper as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Berger, Margareta, Pennskaft: kvinnliga journalister i svensk dagspress 1690–1975 [Penholders: Female journalists in Swedish press 1690–1975], Norstedt, Stockholm, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Margareta Momma]] became the first identified female journalist and [[chief editor]] as the editor of the political essaypaper ''[[Samtal emellan Argi Skugga och en obekant Fruentimbers Skugga]]'' in 1738.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Öhrberg, Vittra fruntimmer. Författarroll och retorik hos frihetstidens kvinnliga författare (Uppsala 2001) 165–187, 339–345.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th-century, many periodicals for, about, and likely also by women were published, but as women normally published under pseudonym, the can seldom be identified: one of the few identified ones being [[Catharina Ahlgren]], who edited the typical women's periodical ''[[De nymodiga fruntimren]]'' (Modern Women) in 1773.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Margareta, Äntligen ord från qwinnohopen!: At last, words also from the women : om kvinnopress under 1700-talet, Akademilitt., Stockholm, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; Women chief editors became fairly common during the 18th-century when the press in Sweden developed, especially since the widow of a male printer or editor normally took over the business of her late spouse: a successful and well known female newspaper editor was [[Anna Hammar-Rosén]], who managed the popular newspaper ''[[Hwad Nytt?? Hwad Nytt??]]'' between 1773 and 1795.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

It was not until the 19th-century that the papers of the Swedish press started to introduce a permanent staff of co-workers and journalists, a development which attached the first women as permanent employees to the newspaper offices, which are noted to be [[Wendela Hebbe]] at ''[[Aftonbladet]]'' in 1841–51 and [[Marie Sophie Schwartz]] at ''Svenska Tidningen Dagligt Allehanda'' in 1851–57.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1858, [[Louise Flodin]] came to be regarded as an important pioneer when she founded her own newspaper, became the first woman to be given a newspaper license, and composed a staff entirely of women employees,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and [[Eva Brag]] became an important pioneer during her career at ''Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning'' in 1865–1889.&lt;ref&gt;Heggestad, Eva: Kritik och kön. 1880-talets kvinnliga kritiker och exemplet Eva Brag. Samlaren. Tidskrift för svensk litteraturvetenskaplig forskning. Årgång 115 1994. Svenska Litteratursällskapet.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1880s, women became more common in the offices of the press, and when women was admitted to the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] in 1885, 14 women were inducted as members.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;    
The pioneer generation of women journalists were generally from the upper class who wished to earn their own income.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; At this point, the focus of a conventional education for a woman was language, which was not the case with a conventional male education, especially since the male reporters were generally not from the upper classes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women were employed as translators and given the responsibility for the coverage of culture and foreign news and interviews of foreigners. During this period, women journalists were reportedly respected – partially due to their social background – and due to their language skills given assignments with equal status to their male co-workers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; In 1918, [[Maria Cederschiöld]], first woman editor of a foreign news section, recalled that women reporters were not as controversial or discriminated in the 1880s as they would later become, "...when the results of [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s hatred of women made itself known. Nor was the struggle of life and competition so sharp, as it has later become. The women pioneers were generally treated with sympathy and interest, even by the men, perhaps because they normally did not regard them as dangerous competitors."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Of the seven biggest newspapers in Stockholm, six had female co-workers prior to 1900, and when [[Swedish Union of Journalists]] was founded in 1901, women were included from the start.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An important event occurred in 1910, when the popular novel ''Pennskaftet'' by [[Elin Wägner]] made the journalist profession a popular career choice for women, and women career journalists were often referred to as "pennskaft".&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; By this time, women reporters, though a minority, had become common and no longer regarded as a novelty and the competition had become harder: in 1913, ''[[Stockholms Dagblad]]'' made a record by having seven female co-workers, and the same year, the [[Swedish Publicists' Association]] founded the ''De kvinnliga journalisternas stipendiefond'' to finance foreign trips for women reporters.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Women covered [[World War I]] and the [[Russian revolution]] and several women journalists became famed role models such as [[Ester Blenda Nordström]] and [[Elin Brandell]].

During the [[Interwar period]], a change occurred which exposed women reporters to an informal discrimination long referred to as a "woman's trap": the introduction of the customary women's section of the newspapers.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; During [[World War I]], war time rationing made it necessary to cover household interests, which after the war became a woman's section, as household tasks were regarded as female tasks.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; The coverage of the women's section customarily became the task of the women reporters, and as they were a minority, the same reporters were often forced to handle the women's section side from their other assignments, which placed them in a great disadvantage to their male colleagues when the competition became harsher during the interwar depression.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;   
In parallel, they were women with successful careers, notably [[Barbro Alving]], whose coverage of the [[Spanish civil war]], [[World War II]] and the [[Cold war]] made her famous, and Dagmar Crohn, who were the editor of the economy section at ''[[Svenska Dagbladet]]'' in 1933–1959, which made her unique at the time.
In 1939, [[Elsa Nyblom]] became vice chairperson of the [[Publicistklubben]].

The informal discrimination changed when women reporters started to expand the subjects treated at the women's sections. A noted example of this development was [[Synnöve Bellander]], editor of the women's section ''Hus och hem'' at Svenska Dagbladet in 1932–59. Originally expected to write only of fashion and make up, she started to expand the area to the subjects of education and professional life for women, and from there to consumer issues and food quality and other issues concerning the private home life. This development in the women's sections gradually transformed them to sections for "family" and private life for both sexes, and blurred the line to the rest of the paper.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The 1960s signified a great change. A debate about gender discrimination in the press, followed by the general debate about gender roles during the 
[[second-wave feminism]], quickly raised the numbers of female reporters in the press from 1965 onward. In 1970, [[Pernilla Tunberger]] became the first woman to be awarded ''[[Stora Journalistpriset]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
The first female full-time employed journalist in [[Fleet Street]] was [[Eliza Lynn Linton]], who was employed by ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' from 1848: three years later, she became the paper's correspondent in Paris, and upon her return to London in the 1860s, she was given a permanent position.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is regarded as the first account of war by a woman. Her writing analyzes the relevant events, personalities of key actors and consequences of the military struggles she observed. Moreover, she was personally involved in the heart of the [[Battles of Saratoga]]. She suffered the hardships of siege when she sheltered in the cellar of [[Marshall House (Schuylerville, New York)|the Marshall House]] during the [[Saratoga campaign|failed retreat of the British army]].

Beginning in the late nineteenth century, women began agitating for the right to work as professional journalists in North America and Europe; by many accounts, the first notable woman in political journalism was [[Jane Grey Swisshelm]]. A former correspondent for Horace Greeley's ''New York Tribune'', she persuaded President Millard Fillmore to open the gallery in congress so that she could report on congressional news.&lt;ref&gt;"Jane Grey Swisshelm:  A Staunch Foe of Slavery, A Noble Woman's Life's Work." San Francisco Bulletin, 2 August 1884, p. 1S.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Swisshelm, Horace Greeley had employed another noteworthy woman in journalism, [[Margaret Fuller]], who covered international news.  [[Nellie Bly]] became known for her investigative reporting at the ''New York World''. She was one of the first female journalists of her era to report by going undercover.

While many female reporters in the 1800s and early 1900s were restricted to [[society reporting]] and were expected to cover the latest in food or fashion, there were a few women who reported on subjects that were considered the domain of male reporters. One example was [[Ina Eloise Young]] (later Ina Young Kelley). In 1907, Miss Young was said to be the only female sports editor (or "sporting" editor, as it was then called). She worked in Colorado for the ''Trinidad Chronicle-News'', and her areas of expertise were baseball, football, and horse racing.&lt;ref&gt;"Colorado Has the Only Woman Sporting Editor." Washington DC Sunday Star, 29 December 1907, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; She covered the 1908 World's Series, the only woman of her time to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"World's Series Notes." Harrisburg (PA) Patriot, 15 October 1908, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 Status of Women in the U.S. Media reported that of more than 150 sports-related print publications and sports-related websites, 90 percent of editors were white males.&lt;ref name="Bedard-WE media"/&gt;

[[File:Public Domain World War II Correspondents (NARA).jpg|thumb|350px|U.S. [[World War II]] [[War correspondent|correspondents]]]]
Another example of a woman in a non-traditional media profession was [[Jennie Irene Mix]]:  when radio broadcasting became a national obsession in the early 1920s, she was one of the few female radio editors at a magazine:  a former classical pianist and a syndicated music critic who wrote about opera and classical music in the early 1920s, Miss Mix became the radio editor at ''Radio Broadcast'' magazine, a position she held from early 1924 until her sudden death in April 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Mitchell, editor. Women and Radio:  Airing Differences. Routledge, 2000, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In talk radio, there were no women among the top 10 of ''[[Talkers magazine's]]'' "Heavy Hundred" and only two women were among the 183 sport talk radio hosts list.&lt;ref name="Bedard-WE media"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bedard|first=Paul|title=Study: Hollywood execs have own 'war on women,' choking off major roles, salary from women|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/study-hollywood-execs-have-own-war-on-women-choking-off-major-roles-salary-from-women/article/2544237|accessdate=19 February 2014|newspaper=Washington Examiner|date=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women increased their presence in professional journalism, and popular representations of the "intrepid girl reporter" became popular in 20th-century films and literature, such as in "[[His Girl Friday]]".&lt;ref&gt;Paul E.

===Nepal===
The history of women in journalism in [[Nepal]] is relatively new. Nepal only enjoyed an open press after the [[People's Movement I (1990)|1990 democratic movement]]. It is only since that change that women have been more active in the scene of journalism. The number of registered women journalists under the [[Federation of Nepalese Journalists]] is 1,613.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://setopati.net/blog/15868/|title=Women in media in Nepal|work=Setopati Online|author=Bhandari, Kripa |date=18 July 2016|accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt===
[[Hind Nawfal]] (1860–1920) was the first woman in the Arab world to publish a journal ([[Al Fatat]]) concerning only women's issues.  [[Zaynab Fawwaz]] was another prolific journalist who also founded a literary salon.

===Turkey===
[[Fatma Aliye Topuz]] wrote for thirteen years between 1895 and 1908 columns in the magazine Hanımlara Mahsus Gazete ("Ladies' Own Gazette") and her sister [[Emine Semiye Onasya]] worked on the editorial staff.

==Music critics==

===Popular music===
[[File:Ann Powers 01A.jpg|thumb|right|200px|American pop music critic [[Ann Powers]] (pictured in 2007)]]
While there are significant numbers of [[Women in music|women vocalists]] singing in pop and rock music, many other aspects of pop and rock music are male-dominated, including [[record producer|record producing]], [[Instrumentalist|instrument playing]] and [[music journalism]]. According to Anwen Crawford, the "problem for women [popular music critics] is that our role in popular music was codified long ago", which means that "[b]ooks by living female rock critics (or jazz, hip-hop, and dance-music critics, for that matter) are scant."&lt;ref name="newyorker.com"&gt;Crawford, Anwen. "The World Needs Female Rock Critics" in ''The Atlantic''. 26 May 2015. Available at: http://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-world-needs-female-rock-critics&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Simon Frith]] noted that pop and rock music "are closely associated with gender; that is, with conventions of male and female behaviour."&lt;ref name=Frith2001&gt;Frith, Simon, "Pop Music" in S.

The American music critic [[Ann Powers]], as a female critic and journalist, has written critiques on the perceptions of sex, racial and social minorities in the music industry. She has also written about feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwp.org/cs/public/print/resource/3696|title=Why I Write: Ann Powers Reflects on Writing About Rock|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/blog/post/6485_guest-blog-ann-powers/|title=Pop music critic Ann Powers searches for the language of rock and roll|publisher=|accessdate=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 she accepted a position as chief pop-music critic at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', where she succeeded [[Robert Hilburn]].&lt;ref&gt;Patrick MacDonald, [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002848360_aebriefs07.html Ann Powers named L.A.

===Classical music===
[[File:Marion Lignana Rosenberg.png|thumb|right|180px|[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013) was a music critic, writer, translator, broadcaster and journalist. She wrote for many periodicals, including [[Salon (website)|Salon.com]], ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Playbill]]''.]]
In 2005, the National Arts Journalism Program (NAJP) at Columbia studied arts journalism in America and found that "the average classical music critic is a white, 52-year-old male with a [[graduate degree]], but twenty-six percent of all critics writing are female." However, William Osborne points out that this 26% figure includes all newspapers, including low-circulation regional papers. Osborne states that the "...large US papers, which are the ones that influence public opinion, have virtually no women classical music critics." The only female critics from major US papers are [[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'') and Wynne Delacoma (''Chicago Sun-Times''). Midgette was the "...first woman to cover classical music in the entire history of the paper."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.osborne-conant.org/women-critics.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Susannah Clapp]], a critic from ''The Guardian''–a newspaper that has a female classical music critic–stated in May 2014 that she had only then realized "...what a rarity" a female classical music critic is in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/25/sexism-stage-critics-tara-erraught-glyndebourne&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable women classical music critics include:
*[[Anne Midgette]] (''New York Times'')
*[[Marion Lignana Rosenberg]] (1961–2013)

An '''étagère''' or '''shelf''' is a French set of hanging or standing open [[shelf (storage)|shelves]] for the display of collections of objects or ornaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1o3WLC1WuX8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Dictionary of Architecture and Interior Design|last=Gilliatt|first=Mary|date=1 October 2012|publisher=Pan|isbn=978-1-74334-067-7|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X3FjAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Fairchild Books Dictionary of Interior Design|last=Hinchman|first=Mark|date=2 January 2014|publisher=A&amp;C Black|isbn=978-1-60901-534-3|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The étagère became a popular form of furniture in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1999.50.2/|title=Etagere {{!}} Work of Art {{!}} Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History {{!}} The Metropolitan Museum of Art|website=The Met's Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|access-date=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the [[what-not]], the shelves of the étagère provided extra space for the display of the accumulation of knickknacks that was typical of [[Victorian decorative arts|Victorian home decor]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
