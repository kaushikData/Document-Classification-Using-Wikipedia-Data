      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7903">{{About|A hierarchy of 356 saints in the Sufi mystic tradition}}
{{Sufism|Ideas}}{{Sunni Islam}}{{Alevism|Beliefs}}

'''Abdāl''' (&lt;abbr title=literally&gt;''lit''&lt;/abbr&gt;: substitutes, but which can also mean "generous" [''karīm''] and "noble" [''sharīf'']) is a term used in [[Islamic metaphysics]] and [[Islamic mysticism]], both [[Sunni]] and [[Shiite]],&lt;ref&gt;La-Shay', Hussein and Negahban, Farzin, “Abdāl”, in: ''Encyclopaedia Islamica'', Editors-in-Chief: Wilferd Madelung and, Farhad Daftary.&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to a particularly important group of [[Allah|God's]] [[wali|saints]].&lt;ref&gt;La-Shay', Hussein and Negahban, Farzin, “Abdāl”, in: ''Encyclopaedia Islamica'', Editors-in-Chief: Wilferd Madelung and, Farhad Daftary.&lt;/ref&gt; In the tradition of Sunni Islam in particular, the concept attained an especially important position in the writings of the Sunni [[Sufism|mystics]] and [[kalam|theologians]], whence it appears in the works of Sunni authorities as diverse as [[Abu Talib al-Makki]] (d. 956), [[Ali Hujwiri]] (d. 1072), [[Ibn Asakir]] (d. 1076), [[Khwaja Abdullah Ansari]] (d. 1088), and [[Ibn Khaldun]] (d. 1406).&lt;ref&gt;La-Shay', Hussein and Negahban, Farzin, “Abdāl”, in: ''Encyclopaedia Islamica'', Editors-in-Chief: Wilferd Madelung and, Farhad Daftary.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a rank of forty saints, but more often the larger group of 356 saints in [[Sufi]] [[hagiography]]. In this theology it is said that they are only known to and appointed by [[Allah]], and it is through their operations that the world continues to exist.&lt;ref name="Metcalf"&gt;{{cite book | title = Making Muslim space in North America and Europe | last = Metcalf | first = Barbara Daly | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1996 | isbn = 0-520-20404-2 | page = 178 | quote = The centrality of a Sufi saint's power over the earth and nature is explicitly personified in Sufi theosophy by the mystical rank of abdal, part of the esoteric set of beliefs regarding the ranked community of saints. According to this set of beliefs, there are at any one time forty living saints in the world who are abdals. These saints, I was told, make the grass grow, give food to birds, and ensure the fertility of the earth.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term over time has come to include a greater hierarchy of saints, all of different rank and prestige.

"Abdal" is the plural of "Badal" or rather "Badeel", and means "those who get replaced", "those who serve as a partial replacement to the role of the prophets" or "friends of God". The Abdals are the group of true, pure believers in God. They serve God during their lifetime; when they die, they are immediately replaced by another selected by God from a larger group said to be the 500 "[[Akhyar]]", i.e., the semi-divine good ones.

The Abdals are headed by their leader, "[[Al-Ghawth]]" ("the Helper"), who is said to reside in [[Mecca]]. This leader is often referred to as the [[Qutb]], which means "Pole" in Arabic.  This leader though unknown to the public is usually sought out by all of the lower ranking members of the abdal. At various times in history, shaykhs have been known to publicly claim to be the [[Qutb]], despite the tradition of remaining outside the public eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zarrinkoob|first=Abdol-Hosein|title=Persian Sufism in Its Historical Perspective|journal=Iranian Studies|year=1970|volume=3|issue=3/4|pages=198|jstor=4310072|doi=10.1080/00210867008701404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The missions of the Abdals are to be God's merciful subjects everywhere they reside and to render the helping blessing hand to all of God's creatures.

It is said that a Badal exists in each continent. Although the majority live in "[[Al-Sham]] (Syria),"...some live in [[Iraq]], some in [[Lebanon]], some in [[Egypt]], some in [[Antioch]], some in [[Mopsuestia|al-Massisa]], [[South Africa]] and others live throughout the rest of the world.".&lt;ref&gt;Moosa, Matti, ''Extremist Shiites: the ghulat sects'', Syracuse University Press, New York, 1988, p.112&lt;/ref&gt; They have divine powers and super-natural abilities. A person does not recognize that he is one of the Abdal until he becomes aware of his status suddenly though a revelation. It is said that a Badal can be identified through his continuous good deeds and forgiving nature. He may be rich or poor, married or bachelor, child or adult. Such concepts are established in the [[Sunni]] branch of Islam, and in particular in the latter’s original [[Sufi]] schools of spiritual disciplines.

The abdal function as the keepers of equilibrium in the world and preserve it between the times when prophets are present. Varying in classification and denomination, the identity of the abdal are entirely unknown to the public and even to themselves.  With the ability to transmit blessings (baraka) and perform miracles (karāmāt) the abdal as a whole are able to adequately fill the role of prophet. Similarly, it is believed that when judgement day comes, they will act as intermediaries (šafāʿa) between God and the human race.&lt;ref name="Chabbi"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chabbi|first1=J|authorlink1=Jacqueline Chabbi|title=Abdal|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abdal|publisher=Encyclopedia Iranica|accessdate=7 April 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110429161659/http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abdal| archivedate= 29 April 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as the number of the abdal is concerned, there are 300 servants of Allah in the creation whose hearts are like that of Adam. There are 40 whose hearts are similar to the heart of Musa and 7 whose hearts are similar to the heart of Ibrahim. There are 5 whose hearts are like that of Jibra’il and 3 whose hearts are like that of Mika’il and one whose heart is like the heart of Israfil. When he (whose heart is like Israfil) dies, then one of the three whose heart is like Mika’il replaces him and one of the five (whose hearts are like Jibra’il) replaces him. One of the seven replaces one of the five, one of the forty replaces one of the seven and one of the three-hundred replaces one of the forty and a normal Muslim replaces one of the three-hundred. It is due to these 356 awliya that creation are given life and killed, due to them rain falls, vegetation grows and difficulties are removed.&lt;ref&gt;‘Abdullah ibn Mas’ud narrates in the name of Muhammad&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=July 2009}}  It is also believed that since the number of abdal is so near to the number of days in the lunar calendar, their role as a part of the cosmic order of the universe is justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zarrinkoob|first=Abdol-Hosein|title=Persian Sufism in Its Historical Perspective|journal=Iranian Studies|year=1970|volume=3|issue=3/4|pages=197|jstor=4310072|doi=10.1080/00210867008701404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sufism, the Abdal are placed in a cosmic hierarchy with other orders of saintly individuals. Two descriptions of the hierarchy come from notable Sufis.  One comes from the 12th Century persian [[Ali Hujwiri]]. In his divine court, there are three hundred ''akhyār'' (“excellent ones”), forty ''abdāl'' (“substitutes”), seven ''abrār'' (“piously devoted ones”), four ''awtād'' (“pillars”) three ''nuqabā'' (“leaders”) and one [[qutb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunnirazvi.net/qadiri/sufis/awliya.htm The Saints of Islam, quoting The Mystics of Islam by Dr. [[Reynold A. Nicholson]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The second version is from [[Ibn Arabi|Ibn Arabī]], who lived in Moorish Spain. It has a more exclusive structure.  There are eight ''nujabā'' (“nobles”), twelve ''nuqabā'', seven ''abdāl'', four ''awtād'', two ''a’immah'' (“guides”), and the qutb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jones|first=Lindsay|title=Encyclopedia of Religion, Second Edition|year=2005|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Farmington Hills, MI|isbn=0-02-865733-0|pages=8821}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Africana womanism'''" is a term coined in the late 1980s by [[Clenora Hudson-Weems]]&lt;ref name="HttptristatedefenderonlinecomarticlelivearticlesAfricanaWomanismAnauthenticagendaforwomenofAfricanadescentPagehtml"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tri-statedefenderonline.com/articlelive/articles/5584/1/Africana-Womanism-An-authentic-agenda-for-women-of-Africana-descent/Page1.html |title='Africana Womanism': An authentic agenda for women of Africana descent |newspaper=Tri-state Defender |department=Commentaries |date=30 December 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100448/http://tri-statedefenderonline.com/articlelive/articles/5584/1/Africana-Womanism-An-authentic-agenda-for-women-of-Africana-descent/Page1.html |archivedate=2011-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; intended as an ideology applicable to all women of African descent. It is grounded in [[African culture]] and [[Afrocentrism]] and focuses on the experiences, struggles, needs, and desires of Africana women of the [[African diaspora]]. It distinguishes itself from [[feminism]], or [[Alice Walker]]'s [[womanism]]. Africana womanism pays more attention to and gives more focus on the realities and the injustices in society in regard to race.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Africana Womanism is geared to be absolutely African-centered. Even in the naming, Africa is at the center and in African cosmology, ''nommo'' is the proper naming of a thing which calls it into existence. [[Clenora Hudson-Weems]] sought to create a ideology specific to African women and women of African descent.  Hudson-Weems believes that the creation of the ideology separates African women’s accomplishments from African male scholars, [[feminism]], and [[black feminism]].  In attempt to avoid being grouped in with other groups of people, Hudson-Weems decided it was time African women had their own ideology established by them.  Thus, the terminology Africana Womanism, more appropriately fits the Africana woman, who is both Self-Namer and Self-Definer (“I have to Know Who I Am”).  Such realities include the diverse struggles and experiences, and needs of Africana women.

The Africana Womanism Society lists 18 characteristics of ''The Africana womanist'', including self-naming, self-defining, family-centered, flexible and desiring positive male companionship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://africanawomanismsociety.webs.com/aboutaws.htm |title=About AWS |website=African Womanism Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hudson-Weems, pp. 57-58, 61, 66, 68–72.{{clarification needed|reason=which Hudson-Weems source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agenda for the Africana woman is, indeed, distinguishable from all other female based theories.  Primarily because of its insistence upon the prioritizing of race, class and, gender in that order. The sharp contrast between brands of feminism and Africana Womanism has to do with the fact that feminism focuses on females and their empowerment (“I Have to Know Who I Am”).  On the other hand, Africana womanism is a Family-Centered, race empowerment agenda.  This ideology is based upon eighteen essential pillars: Self-Naming, Self-Definition, Family-Centeredness, In Concert With Men, Wholeness, Role Flexibility, Adaptability, Authenticity, Genuine Sisterhood, Male Compatibility, Recognition, Ambition, Nurturer, Strength, Respect, Respect for Elders, Mothering, Spirituality (“I am Because We Are: Africana Womanism as a Vehicle of Empowerment and Influence”).

==Development==
[[Clenora Hudson-Weems]],&lt;ref name="HttptristatedefenderonlinecomarticlelivearticlesAfricanaWomanismAnauthenticagendaforwomenofAfricanadescentPagehtml" /&gt; Professor of English, University of Missouri, author of ''Africana Womanism:  Reclaiming Ourselves'', coined the concept Africana Womanism in the late 1980s (''Africana'' is the feminine form of the Latin ''Africanus'', meaning ''Of Africa'', and appears to be preferred by the movement over ''African''). Hudson-Weems argues that "Africana Womanism is not an addendum to feminism, [[Black feminism]], African feminism or Alice Walker's [[womanism]]"&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hudson-Weems | first = Clenora | year = 1998 | title = Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves | publisher = Bedford Publishing | isbn = 0-911557-14-8 | page = 24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Feminism and gender issues are separate entities that are not reliant upon each other, and therefore, Africana women are able to address gender issues without partaking in feminist activity.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:183926/datastream/PDF/view|title=I Have to Know Who I Am: An Africana Womanist Analysis|last=Waddell Gilliam|first=Doris|date=29 March 2013|website=Florida State University Libraries|access-date=12 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Patricia Hill Collins]], "Although some Africana women may support the very ideas on which feminism rests, however, many of them reject the term "feminism" because of what they perceive as its association with white women's cause. They see feminism as operating exclusively within the terms white and American and perceive its opposite as being Black and American."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Collins |first= Patricia Hill |authorlink= Patricia Hill Collins |date=Winter–Summer 1996 |title= What’s in a Name?  Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond |url=https://oldcapitolbooks.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/whats-in-a-name-womanism-black-feminism-and-beyond.pdf |journal=The Black Scholar |volume=26 |issue= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further many African men and women do not accept the ideology of feminism.  According to Hudson-Weems, she states that "there is a general consensus in the Africana community that the feminist movement, by and large, is the White woman's movement for two reason. First, the Africana woman does not see the man as her primary enemy as does the White feminist, who is carrying out an age-old battle with her White male counterpart for subjugating her as his property. Africana men have never had the same institutionalized power to oppress Africana women as White men have had to oppress White women."&lt;ref&gt;Hudson-Weems, p. 25.{{clarification needed|reason=which Hudson-Weems source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Africana Womanism contrast a racist and sexist feminist/womanist ideology and many Africana women (and men) have come to embrace it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kasun|first1=Genna|title=Womanism and the Fiction of Jhumpa Lahiri |url=https://library.uvm.edu/jspui/bitstream/123456789/203/1/Kasun%20Thesis.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730235325/https://library.uvm.edu/jspui/bitstream/123456789/203/1/Kasun%20Thesis.pdf |archive-date=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hudson-Weems (1998), ''Africana Womanism: Reclaiming Ourselves'', explains the development of Africana Womanism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Africana Womanism is a term I coined and defined in 1987 after nearly two years of publicly debating the importance of self-naming for Africana women. Why the term 'Africana Womanism'? Upon concluding that the term 'Black Womanism' was not quite the terminology to include the total meaning desired for this concept, I decided that 'Africana Womanism,' a natural evolution in naming, was the ideal terminology for two basic reasons. The first part of the coinage, ''Africana'', identifies the ethnicity of the woman being considered, and this reference to her ethnicity, establishing her cultural identity, relates directly to her ancestry and land base—Africa. The second part of the term ''Womanism'', recalls [[Sojourner Truth]]'s powerful impromptu speech '[[Ain't I a Woman?]]', one in which she battles with the dominant alienating forces in her life as a struggling Africana Woman, questioning the accepted idea of womanhood. Without question she is the flip side of the coin, the co-partner in the struggle for her people, one who, unlike the white woman, has received no special privileges in American society.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson-Weems, pp. 22–23.{{clarification needed|reason=which Hudson-Weems source?|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Africana womanist ideology contributes to Afrocentric discourse. Africana womanism fundamental foundation is built on traditional [[Africana philosophy]] and values, and Afrocentric theories:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asantewaa|first1=Reed, Pamela Yaa|title=Africana Womanism and African Feminism: A Philosophical, Literary, and Cosmological Dialectic on Family|journal=The Western Journal of Black Studies|date=22 September 2001|volume=25|issue=3|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-90990918/africana-womanism-and-african-feminism-a-philosophical |url-access=subscription|language=en|issn=0197-4327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the traditional values forefront the role of African mothers as leaders in the struggle to regain, reconstruct, and create a cultural integrity that espouses the ancient Maatic principles of reciprocity, balance, harmony, justice, truth, righteousness, order, and so forth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Lastly, [[Nah Dove]] (1998), "African Womanism: An Afrocentric Theory", credits Hudson-Weems and other scholars in shaping the Africana womanist model. Dove asserts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Nah |last=Dove |title=African Womanism: An Afrocentric Theory |journal=Journal of Black Studies |volume=28 |issue=5 |date=May 1998 |pages=515–539 |jstor=2784792 |doi=10.1177/002193479802800501}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A concept [Africana Womanism] that has been shaped by the work of women such as Clenora Hudson-Weems, [[Ifi Amadiume]], Mary E. Modupe Kolawole, and others. African womanism may be viewed as fundamental to the continuing development of Afrocentric theory. Africana womanism brings to the forefront the role of African mothers as leaders in the struggle to regain, reconstruct, and create a cultural integrity that espouses the ancient Maatic principles of reciprocity, balance, harmony, justice, truth, righteousness, order, and so forth. (p. 535)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Eighteen key components ==
There are 18 key components that form Africana womanism. The characteristics are the following: Self-Naming, Self-Definition, Family-Centeredness, Wholeness, Role Flexibility, Adaptability, Authenticity, Black Female Sisterhood, Struggling with males against oppression, Male Compatibility, Recognition, Ambition, Nurturing, Strengthen, Respect, Respect for Elders, Mothering, Spirituality.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alexander-Floyd|first=Nikol G.|last2=Simien|first2=Evelyn M.|year=2006|title=Revisiting "What's in a Name?": Exploring the Contours of Africana Womanist Thought|url=|journal=A Journal of Women Studies|volume=27|pages=67–89|via=Project Muse|doi=10.1353/fro.2006.0011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the characteristics listed above have a specific meanings that collectively establish a basis for Africana Womanism.  The first principle Self-Naming discusses the importance of self-identifying as an African woman in society.  The Africana identification is distinguishable from feminism and black variants.  Self-naming is the period of recognizing the need for an Africana movement with its own name.  The second principle defined, Self-Definition, begins to describe realities that African women face, through a Pan-African lens.  The Pan-African movement attempts to create a sense of brotherhood among all people of African descent, regardless of whether or not they live on the continent of Africa.  Self-definition explores gender inequalities and stereotypes in the modern patriarchy.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Self-naming and self-definition are the first two couple of characteristics of Africana womanism. The term "nommo" is given to the idea of self-naming, which is important because in order for one to exist it has to be given a correct name. There is an increasing need for self-naming, self-defining, and self-identity for Black people and self-defining helps to discover one's identity through their own point of view of their world that goes against that of the dominant culture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The second groupings of characteristics are family-centeredness, wholeness, authenticity, role flexibility, adaptability, struggling with Black men against oppression, and Black female sisterhood. The second grouping of characteristics includes Family-Centeredness, Wholeness, Authenticity, Role Flexibility, Adaptability, In Concert With Men, and Genuine Sisterhood. The principle of family-centeredness focuses on the entire black family unit.  The interest in the success of the black community as a whole maintains a sense of wholeness.  Any important outcomes are shared as overarching closeness of the Black community is enforced by the women in society.  The commitment to immediate and extended family is of crucial importance to African women, as it shapes the third principle outlined by Clenora Hudson-Weems. The principle of Wholeness describes the importance of self-sufficiency that an African woman must have in order to upkeep her household.  Wholeness also stresses the required self-esteem that emanates from within an African woman who must be strong for not only herself, but for her family and community as a whole.  Completeness, going hand in hand with Wholeness, is defined as the unbroken unity that an African woman is responsible for upholding inside the home and out. &lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The first five components all emphasis the commitment to family that is of major importance to Black women. There is a high interest in success of the group and collective outcomes that maintains a sense of wholeness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Nikol Alexander-Floyd (2006) states that there is this balance of putting the family first, which would be wholeness, without neglecting the career of the women or as he states it here authenticity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Role flexibility and adaptability are also important parts of family-centeredness because of their roots in the history of Black women. The Role Flexibility principle acknowledges and discusses the fact that the Black woman has never been a subjugate.  African women are active in the workforce, take part in leadership opportunities presented, and do not need to be domestic.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In history, Black women have experienced flexible gender roles meaning that Black women not only had experience working outside of home along with men but all within the home. For adaptability, Black women not only adapted to different work environments but also to the lack of luxuries that were experienced by white women and [[Feminism|feminists]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lastly, for struggling with Black men against oppression and Black female sisterhood, Africana womanist see that there is a fight against oppression that is being fought by Black men and see themselves fighting on the same team as Black men. Sisterhood in Africana womanism has to be genuine and is genuine through the fact that Black women go through the same experience of oppression and can therefore empathize with one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Due to these conditions Black women were forced to undergo while under white domination, African women developed an extreme ability to be adaptable.  Women were forced to sacrifice their own goods and desires for the sake of often times, their safety.  Black women were often forced to compromise their dignity, as well as their ambition.  Lastly, there are In Concert With Men and Genuine Sisterhood. In concert with men is the African woman’s push to develop strong relationships with like minded men in the struggle for overarching Black liberation and the eventually Black women's liberation.  The concept of Genuine Sisterhood, which is one of the eighteen characteristics of Africana Womanism, is integral for the survival of women in a male-dominated society.  As described by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison, “In wielding the power that is deservedly yours, don’t permit it to enslave your sisters”.  Morrison’s insights refer to the frequency that women tear each other down, as she continues to describe that this behavior is especially common in the workplace.  The foundation of female relationships is violated by the habitual behavior in that women treat each other with disrespect and cruelty.  Sisterhood in Africana womanism has to be genuine and is genuine through the fact that Black women go through the same experience of oppression and can therefore empathize with one another.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;[[Africana womanism#cite%20note-%3A0-12|&lt;sup&gt;[12]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

The third and last clustering of characteristics are strength, male compatibility, respect, recognition, respect for elders, ambition, mothering, nurturing, and spirituality. Historically, Black women were always had psychological and physical strengthen especially with what happened with [[slavery]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hudson-Weems says that Black men's and Black women's bond helps to maintain the race.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out of the Revolution: The Development of Africana Studies|last=Hudson-Weems|first=Clenora|publisher=Lexington Books|year=2000|isbn=|editor-last=Aldridge|editor-first=Delores P.|location=|pages=205–217|chapter=African Womanism: An Overview|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Black woman are physically and mentally strong.  This principle of Strength is often the one that is attacked by non-Africana oppressors because their goal is to force submission upon the powerful group that is Africana women.  Hudson-Weems says that Black men's and Black women's bond helps to maintain the race. Therefore, the principle of male compatibility is based upon mutually beneficial relationships between a well-respected African woman and a supportive, like-minded, man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/33840/JBlackmonthesis.pdf|title=I Am Because We Are: Africana Womanism as a Vehicle of Empowerment and Influence|last=Blackmon|first=Janice|date=16 June 2008|website=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|access-date=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Respect and recognition go together that is necessary for a healthy respect for Africana womanists and it helps them relate to others. Respect and recognition also contributes to the self-love and admiration, and respect for elders or older members in the Black community. To dissect both principles a bit further, Respect refers to reverence an African woman has for herself, absent of the colonized standards.  Determining one’s worth, while ignoring politics, is a crucial to becoming a confident African woman.  The pillar of Recognition refers to the acknowledgement of humanity, capability, and power of Black women.  Recognition plays a large role in keeping communal peace and ensuring the Black women’s effectiveness in the struggle for equality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  

The principles that outline the caring nature of the Africana womanist are defined below.  Respect for Elders, is an extension of the historical African tradition of ancestral reverence.  Ancestral reverence is the habitual act of caring for elders, and eventual ancestors, within a community or society.  Once the elders become ancestors, they will be responsible for providing wisdom and guidance which is highly vauled.  The Nurturer and Motherer are both described a call for all community members to play an active role in the rearing of the community and propaganda of the race through care.  It is an African woman’s duty to not only care and nourish her family, but to provide the care and nourishment for her race as a whole.  By fostering and guiding fellow women, the Africana Movement is advanced.  The initiative taken to further the public’s appreciation and education about the Africana Movement exemplifies the principle of Ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Africana Womanism: The Flip Side of a Coin|last=Hudson-Weems|first=Clenora|publisher=Western Journal of Black Studies|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=Vol. 25 Issue 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final principle is Spirituality, which stresses the importance of the reverence for traditional African spiritual systems.  These spiritual systems call for a collection of the principles including Ancestral Reverence, Oneness with oneself, and with nature as well.  Africana womanist are also very spiritual and believe in a higher power and their mothering and nurturing is tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Other focuses and concerns ===
Hudson-Weems (2000) states that the rejection of white organizations is something that Africana women take part in.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Africana women focus on things that help with the elimination of oppression, which is considered to be the most important thing in order for the Africana community to survive. Alongside the rejection of white organizations, Africana womanism puts priority on human dignity of Africana women, children, and men. It focuses on race as the main importance for Africana women.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ntiri|first=Daphne W.|year=2001|title=Reassessing Africana womanism: Continuity and change|url=|journal=Western Journal of Black Studies|volume=25|pages=163–167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Racism]] is seen to be priority over [[sexism]] and sexism is seen to derive from racism, [[classism]], and economic [[prejudice]]s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Some problems of Africana women, according to Hudson-Weems, include "physical brutality, sexual harassment, and female subjugation in general perpetrated both within and outside the race" and has to be solved in Africana communities collectively.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

While many think of Africana womanism as being similar to that of [[Black feminism]], [[African feminism]], [[womanism]], and [[feminism]], there are clear distinctions in agenda for the forms of [[Women's empowerment|women empowerment]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Values==

The Africana Womanist concept was best exemplified in Brenda Verner's (1994) article "The Power and Glory of Africana Womanism":

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Africana Womanism in essence says: We love men. We like being women. We love children. We like being mothers. We value life. We have faith in God and the Bible. We want families and harmonious relationships. We are not at war with our men seeking money, power and influence through confrontation. Our history is unique. We are the inheritors of African-American women's history, and as such we shall not redefine ourselves nor that history to meet some politically correct image of a popular culture movement, which demands the right to speak for and redefine the morals and mores of all racial, cultural and ethnic groups. Nor shall we allow the history to be "shanghied" to legitimatize the "global political agenda" of others. We reject the status of victim. Indeed, we are victors, Sisters in Charge of our own destiny. We are Africana culture-keepers: Our primary obligation is to the progress of our cultural way of life through the stability of family and the commitment to community. The practice of cultural womanism is not limited to Africana women. Italian, Japanese, Hispanic, East Indian, Arab, Jewish women, etc., all utilize this approach to decision-making, and know the value of maintaining indigenous cultural autonomy. The rite of passing generation-to-generation knowledge free from outside manipulation, coercion or intimidation insures traditional integrity, which fosters a climate of cultural security. Traditional cultures should not be obligated to bow to redefinitions foisted upon them by elitist entities that gain their authority via the drive of well-organized "media hype."&lt;ref&gt;Brenda Verner (1994, June), "The Power and Glory of Africana Womanism", ''Chicago Tribune Newspaper'', p. 8.  Accessed December 2008, ProQuest.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Male-womanist==
Africana men can embrace an Africana womanist approach. According to Tolagbe Ogunlege (1998), "Referring to a man as a male-womanist is not an anomaly or rarity, and bestowing gender-specific title on individuals of the opposite sex has been practiced by Africana peoples for millennia. For example, among the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], an exceptional woman who has made significant contributions to the educational, socioeconomic, and/or spiritual growth and development of her family and community is referred to as a man-woman or obinrin bi okunrin." Ogunlege further explains that among the [[Lebou people]] of Senegal, a man who governs according to ancient customs is referred to as the "Mother of the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Tolagbe Ogunlege (1998), "Dr. Martin Robison Delany, 19th-Century Africana Womanists: Reflections on His Avant-Garde Politics Concerning Gender, Colorism, and Nation Building", p. 630, in the ''Journal of the Black Studies'', 28(5) pp. 628–649, and Diop, 1978, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
The Africana Womanist concept was adopted by many faculty in higher education.  According to Daphne W. Ntiri (2001), Associate Professor of Social Science, [[Wayne State University]], "Since Clenora Hudson-Weems broke new ground with her 1993 book ''Africana Womanism:  Reclaiming Ourselves'', discourse on the place and agenda of Africana women in the women's movement reflects the text's influence.  In only six years, this work is in the second printing of its third revised edition.  It has been adopted by faculty in several higher education institutions in as far away places as Africa, Brazil, Japan, and the Caribbean Islands.  Adoption at national universities includes Clark Atlanta University, [[California State University-Long Beach]], [[Florida A&amp;M]], [[Indiana State University]], [[Northern Illinois University]], [[San Francisco State University]], [[Temple University]], the [[University of Missouri]], and the [[University of Utah]] to name a few" (p.&amp;nbsp;163).

==Examples in literature==
Drawing on the tenets of Africana Womanism, Clenora Hudson-Weems extends the theoretical framework to literary analysis. Such an anlysis of Africana literature emphasizes the family, complimentarity between men and women, and commitment to the survival and liberation of the community as a whole. In her text, Africana Womanist Literary Theory, Hudson-Weems explores select Africana novels in order to offer Africana womanist interpretations. Five Africana Womanist novels:  [[Zora Neale Hurston]], ''[[Their Eyes Were Watching God]]''.  Hudson-Weems states that the character Janie is a protagonists to name and define herself. Also, a protagonist of family-centeredness (pp.&amp;nbsp;81–82); [[Mariama Ba]], a renowned [[Senegal]]ese writer, ''[[So Long a Letter]]'', Ba's attack on polygamous society that subjugates women, and her interests in the rights of Africana women are reflected in her novel. According to Hudson-Weems "the novel does not justify categorizing it as a feminist novel, which the author dedicates the book 'To all women and men of good will,' thereby demonstrating her natural inclination to include men as a very important part of women's lives" (Hudson-Weems, pp.&amp;nbsp;93–94); [[Paule Marshall]], a prominent African-Caribbean writer, ''[[Praisesong for the Widow]]'', which the character "Reena" bears the historical nuances of so-called shortcomings of the Africana woman in relationship with her male companion. Pauline, the narrator, advocates a solution to the deteriorating relationship between the Africana man and woman (Hudson-Weems, p.&amp;nbsp;105); [[Toni Morrison]], ''Beloved''. Hudson-Weems asserts that "From Morrison first novel, ''[[The Bluest Eye]]'', to ''[[Sula (novel)|Sula]]'', ''[[Song of Solomon (novel)|Song of Solomon]]'', ''[[Tar Baby (novel)|Tar Baby]]'', and finally to her fifth novel, ''[[Beloved (novel)|Beloved]]'', the author develops the roles of the male and the female in this collective struggle" (p.&amp;nbsp;119); and [[Terry McMillan]], ''[[Disappearing Acts]]''. Hudson-Weems explains that the character Zora Banks is self-naming and self-defining, family-centered and compatible, flexible with her roles and ambitions, demanding of respect and strong, reverent of elders and authentic, and last but not least, nurturing and mothering (pp.&amp;nbsp;133–134).

Africana Womanist literature also consists of Africana family dynamics, Africana women and men—their interrelationship, and experiences within their communities, and religion. For instance: [[Russell J. Rickford]] (2003) ''[[Betty Shabazz]]: Surviving [[Malcolm X]]: A Journey of Strength from Wife to Widow to Heroine''; [[Ilyasah Shabazz]] (2002), ''[[Growing Up X]]: A Memoir by the Daughter of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''; Sonsyrea Tate (1997) ''Growing Up in the [[Nation of Islam]]''; [[Yvonne S. Thornton]], M.D. (1995), ''The Ditchdigger's Daughters: A Black Family's Astonishing Success Story''; [[Alex Haley]] (1976) ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family]]''; [[Coretta Scott King]] (1969), ''My Life with [[Martin Luther King, Jr]]''. In addition to Regina Jennings (2001), ''Africana Womanism in The [[Black Panther Party]]: A Personal Story'', published in the ''Western Journal of Black Studies''. Jennings describes her experiences as a young woman who joined the Black Panther Party in [[Oakland, California]], using the theory of Africana Womanism.{&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jennings|first1=Regina|title=Africana Womanism in the Black Panther Party: A Personal Story|journal=public.wsu.edu|date=Fall 2001|volume=25|issue=3|pages=146–152|url=http://public.wsu.edu/~wjbs/vol25.3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;}

'''Afro-Surrealism''' or '''Afrosurrealism''' is a literary and cultural aesthetic that is a response to mainstream [[surrealism]] in order to reflect the lived experience of [[people of color]]. First coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in 1974,&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|last1=D. Scot|first1=Miller|title=Call it Afro-Surreal|url=http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/|website=San Francisco Bay Guarian|accessdate=8 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; this movement focuses on the present day experience of African Americans.  Afro-Surrealism is based on the manifesto written by D. Scot Miller, in which he says, "Afro-Surrealism sees that all 'others' who create from their actual, lived experience are surrealist..."  The manifesto delineates Afro-Surrealism from Surrealism and Afro-Futurism. The manifesto also declares the necessity of Afro-Surrealism, especially in [[San Francisco]], California. The manifesto lists ten tenants that Afro-Surrealism follows including how "Afro-Surrealists restore the cult of the past," and how "Afro-Surreal presupposes that beyond this visible world, there is an invisible world striving to manifest, and it is our job to uncover it."

Afro-Surrealism can be seen in music, photography, film, the visual arts and poetry. Notable practitioners of Afro-Surrealism include [[Ted Joans]], [[Bob Kaufman]], [[Krista Franklin]], [[Kool Keith]], [[Terrence Nance]], [[Will Alexander (poet)|Will Alexander]], [[India Sky Davis]], [[Kara Walker]], [[Samuel R. Delany]], [[Starr Finch]], Romare Bearden and [[Christopher Burch (artist)|Christopher Burch]].

== Influence ==
The AfroSurreal arts movement came about after D. Scot Miller penned The Afrosurreal Manifesto for The San Francisco Bay Guardian in May, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt; Until that time, the term "Afrosurreal Expressionism" was used solely to describe the writings of Henry Dumas by Amiri Baraka. Later that year, Miller spoke with Baraka about extending the term by shortening the description. It was agreed by the two of them that "Afrosurreal" without the "expressionism" would allow further exploration of the term.  [http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/10/28/anti-doofus-agenda/].  Afrosurrealism may have some similar origins to [[surrealism]] in the mid-1920s, in that an aspect of it [Negritude] came after [[André Breton]] wrote the [[Surrealist Manifesto]], but as Leopold Senghor points out in Miller's manifesto, “European Surrealism is empirical. African Surrealism is mystical and metaphorical.”.&lt;ref&gt;http://sfbgarchive.48hills.org/sfbgarchive/2009/05/19/call-it-afro-surreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealism incorporates aspects of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], [[Négritude]] and Black Radical Imagination as described by Professor Robin DG Kelley in his definitive work Freedom Dreams: The Black Radical Imagination (2003),&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/a-converstion-with-robin-d-g-kelley/&lt;/ref&gt; and further with his definitive Afrosurreal historical anthology, Black, Brown, &amp; Beige:
Surrealist Writings from Africa and the Diaspora (2009).&lt;ref&gt;https://muse.jhu.edu/book/3194&lt;/ref&gt;  Aspects of Afro-Surrealism can be traced to Martiniquan Suzanne Césaire’s discussion of the “revolutionary impetus of surrealism” in the 1940s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Editor’s Notes|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.editor.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 1–2|volume = 5|issue = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though much has been written and said about artist/activist/statesmen Aimé Césaire, much more needs to written about his partner Suzanne, a brilliant surrealist thinker, and mother of the Afrosurreal aesthetic. Her quest for “The Marvelous” over the “miserablism” expressed in the usual arts of protest inspired the Tropiques surrealist group, and especially René Ménil.

“The true task of mankind consists solely in the attempt to bring the marvelous into real life,” Ménil says in “Introduction to the Marvelous,”[1930s] “so that life can become more encompassing. So long as the mythic imagination is not able to overcome each and every boring mediocrity, human life will amount to nothing but useless, dull experiences, just killing time, as they say.”

Suzanne Césaire’s proclamation, “Be in permanent readiness for The Marvelous,” quickly became a credo of the movement; the word “marvelous” has since become re-contextualized with regard to contemporary black arts and interventions.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2016/10/afrosurreal-the-marvelous-and-the-invisible/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1956 essay for ''[[Présence Africaine]]'' Haitian novelist [[Jacques Stephen Alexis]] wrote,'' "What, then, is the Marvellous, except the imagery in which a people wraps its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of life, its faith, its hope, its confidence in man, in a great justice, and the explanation which it finds for the forces antagonistic to progress?"''&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Introduction: The No-Theory Chant of Afrosurrealism|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis03.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 95–112|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Alexis is seen to have an acute sense of reality that is not dissimilar to traditional surrealism, and his coining of the term "Marvelous Realism" reflects how he was influenced by the earlier works of the Negritude/Black Surrealist Movement.

== Development ==
Afro-Surrealism was coined by [[Amiri Baraka]] in his 1974 essay on Black Arts Movement avant-garde writer [[Henry Dumas]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2015/10/01/433229181/henry-dumas-wrote-about-black-people-killed-by-cops-then-he-was-killed-by-a-cop&lt;/ref&gt;  Baraka notes that Dumas is able to write about ancient mysteries that were simultaneously relevant to the present day. This idea that the past resurfaces to haunt the present day is a crucial to Afro-Surrealism.

Cinematographer [[Arthur Jafa]] expanded the field of Afro-Surrealism by experimenting with film. Jafa introduces the idea of "the alien familiar," in order to represent the Black experience and its innate surreal characteristics. "I want it to have something that I and my friends call 'the alien familiar.' If a work succeeds in a way or is able to conjure what a Black cinema would be or what this hypothetical manifestation of this particular tradition in the cinematic arena might be, it should be both alien because you’ve never seen anything quite like it, and at the same time, it should be familiar on some level to Black audiences."&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Jafa, “The Notion of Treatment: Black Aesthetics and Film, based on an interview with Peter Hassli and additional discussions with Pearl Bowser,” in Oscar Micheaux and His Circle: African-American Filmmaking and Race Cinema of the Silent Era, ed. Pearl Bowser et al. (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2001), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This focus on the alien aspect of the Black experience, and on Black folk culture, are what separate Afro-Surrealism from magical realism and surrealism.

=== The Future-Past ===
&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. S. "Afrosurreal Manifesto: Black Is the New black—a 21st-Century Manifesto." ''Black Camera'', vol. 5 no. 1, 2013, pp. 113-117. ''Project MUSE'', muse.jhu.edu/article/525948.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Afro-Futurism which speculates on black possibilities in the future, Afrosurrealism, as Miller describes, is about the present. Rather than speculate on the coming of the four horseman, Afrosurrealists understand that they rode through too long ago. Through Afrosurrealism, artists expose this form of the future past that is "RIGHT NOW." Most Afrosurrealists reject the study of the future pushing themselves to focus on the present, the future that has already past.

=== The everyday lived experience ===

Much of Afro-Surrealism is concerned with the everyday life because it is said that there is nothing more surreal than the Black experience.  According to Terri Francis, "Afrosurrealism is art with skin on it where the texture of the object tells its story, how it weathered burial below consciousness, and how it emerged somewhat mysteriously from oceans of forgotten memories and discarded keepsakes. This photograph figures Afrosurrealism as bluesy, kinky-spooky."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Meditation|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/black_camera/v005/5.1.francis02.html|journal = Black Camera|date = 2013-01-01|issn = 1947-4237|pages = 94-94|volume = 5|issue = 1|first = Terri|last = Francis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Present day realism ===
In the manifesto from which present day Afrosurrealism is based, writer D. Scot Miller states in a response to Afrofuturism:

"Afro-Futurism is a diaspora intellectual and artistic movement that turns to science, technology, and science fiction to speculate on black possibilities in the future. Afro-Surrealism is about the present. There is no need for tomorrow’s-tongue speculation about the future. Concentration camps, bombed-out cities, famines, and enforced sterilization have already happened. To the Afro-Surrealist, the Tasers are here. The Four Horsemen rode through too long ago to recall. What is the future? The future has been around so long it is now the past."

As The AfroSurreal Manifesto and Afrofuturism come to the fore in artistic, commercial and academic circles, the struggle between the specific and “the scent” of present-day manifestations of Black absurdity has come with it, posing interesting challenges to both movements. For Afrofuturists, this challenge has been met by inserting Afrocentric elements into its growing pantheon, the intention being to centralize Afrofuturist focus back on the continent of Africa to enhance its specificity. For the Afrosurrealists, the focus has been set at the “here and now” of contemporary Black arts and situations in the Americas, Antilles, and beyond, searching for the nuanced “scent” of those current manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2017/05/the-electrical-scent-of-damas-negritude-the-harlem-renaissance-and-the-afrosurreal/&lt;/ref&gt;

Afro-Surrealist scholar Rochelle Spencer identifies at least three different subgenres of black speculative art, and Spencer argues that Afro-Surrealism is the most present-focus, though it is not devoid of technology and may include allusions to modern technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Black Science Fiction Studies Matter|url = http://www.themarysue.com/black-science-fiction-studies-matter/|website = www.themarysue.com|accessdate = 2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Francis, the juxtaposition between the old and the present day is what makes Afro-Surrealism so unique. As Francis puts it, "Surrealism here, the Afro-surreal, like the marvelous discussed above, is actually a realism so real, so contrary to the norms of publicized blackness, that it represents a rupture, a radical break from ordinary understanding such that the old feels new—because it was never known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiana.edu/~blackcam/pastIssues/Fall2013.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples of Afrosurrealist Works ==

=== ''Zong!,'' M. NourbSe Philip and Setaey Adamu Boateng ===
In &lt;ref&gt;Philip, Marlene Nourbese. Zong! Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Zong!'', M. NourbSe Philip crafts a powerful counter-narrative surrounding the events of the [[Zong massacre|''Zong'' massacre]]. Utilizing the words from the legal decision to build her poetry, Philip rejects the idea of an archival past. Instead Philip looks to the present moment to understand how to read this legal decision and understand the case. Following the footsteps of Toni Morrison’s ''Beloved'', Philip presupposes the notion of a past that is not past allowing these past artifacts to haunt the present moment. Rather than organize the fragments, Philip allows the fragments to tell themselves. This is not to say that Philip gives the fragments voices, but instead gives them space. The space in the poem allows Philip’s audience to hear the silence of these voices, to truly understand the missing narratives form the past and the role that has on the present.

=== ''Beloved'', Toni Morrison ===
As mentioned earlier, Toni Morrison’s &lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Toni. Beloved: A Novel. New York: Knopf : Distributed by Random House, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;''Beloved'' remains an important milestone for Afrosurrealists. Here, Morrison imagines a narrative of a slave women grieving the death of her baby daughter, Beloved. With no trace of a past, Beloved reappears of on the steps of 124, confused and looking for her mother. Following this moment, the novel crafts a haunting tale of a woman seeking to understand the sudden reappearance of her daughter and the scars left behind from slavery. In ''Beloved,'' Morrison attempts to come to grip with the legacies left by slavery, challenging the notion that these legacies exits only from the past. From the epigraph, “''Sixty Million and more'',” Morrison presupposes there is no way to count those affected from slavery and additionally, that the number is ever-growing into the present. In her award-winning novel, Morrison expands the idea of the past, attempting to demonstrate the past is ever present and moreover, that the past is RIGHT NOW.

ArduPilot was originally developed by hobbyists to control model aircraft and rovers and has evolved into a full-featured and reliable autopilot used by industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ardupilot.org/about/Partners|title=Corporate Partners|website=ardupilot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, research organisations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eure|first=Kenneth W.|date=December 2013|title=An Application of UAV Attitude Estimation Using a Low-Cost Inertial Navigation System|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140002398.pdf|journal=ntrs.nasa.gov|volume=NASA/TM–2013-218144|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and amateurs. The project started in 2007 and visible after Chris Anderson published a video of lego based UAV running Ardupilot on youtube&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ardupilot.org/planner2/docs/common-history-of-ardupilot.html|title=History of Ardupilot — APM Planner 2  documentation|website=ardupilot.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Software and Hardware==

=== Software suite ===
The ArduPilot  software suite consists of navigation software (typically referred to as  firmware when it is compiled to binary form for microcontroller hardware targets)  running on the vehicle (either [[Copter]], [[Airplane|Plane]], Rover, AntennaTracker, or [[Submarine|Sub]]),  along with  ground station controlling software including Mission Planner, APM Planner, QGroundControl, MavProxy, Tower and others.

ArduPilot source code is stored and managed on [[GitHub]], with almost 400 total contributors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot|title=ArduPilot/ardupilot|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The software suite is automatically built nightly, with continuous integration and unit testing provided by [[Travis CI]], and a build and compiling environment including the [[GNU Compiler Collection|GNU]] cross-platform compiler and [[Waf]].   Pre-compiled binaries running on various hardware platforms are available for user download from ArduPilot's sub-websites.

[[File:Octocopter_Flying_with_ArduPilot.jpg|thumb|An octocopter flying with Ardupilot|alt=An octocopter flying with Ardupilot]]

=== Supported hardware ===
Copter, Plane, Rover, AntennaTracker or Sub software runs on a wide variety of [[embedded hardware]] (including full blown [[Linux]] computers),  typically consisting of one or more  [[microcontroller]] or [[microprocessor]] connected to peripheral sensors used for navigation. These sensors  include [[MEMs|MEMS]] [[gyroscope]]s and  [[accelerometer]]s at a minimum, necessary for multirotor flight and plane stabilization. Sensors  usually  include, in addition,  one or more [[Magnetometer|compass]], [[altimeter]] (barometric) and [[GPS navigation device|GPS]], along with optional additional sensors such as [[Optical flow|optical flow sensors]], [[airspeed indicator]]s, [[Laser rangefinder|laser]] or [[sonar]] altimeters or rangefinders, monocular, stereoscopic or RGB-D cameras. Sensors may be on the same electronic board, or external.

Ground Station software, used for programming or monitoring vehicle operation, is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android.

== History ==

=== Early years, 2007-2012 ===
The ArduPilot project earliest roots  date back to late 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://forum.arduino.cc/index.php?topic=7623.0|title=ArduCopter V1 Beta|website=forum.arduino.cc|access-date=2017-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  when Jordi Munoz, who later co-founded [[3D Robotics|3DRobotics]] with [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], wrote an [[Arduino]]  program (which he called "ArduCopter") to stabilize an RC Helicopter.  In  2009  Munoz and Anderson released Ardupilot 1.0&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?979372-ArduPilot-an-open-source-autopilot-now-available-(-24-95!)|title=ArduPilot, an open source autopilot, now available ($24.95!) - RC Groups|website=www.rcgroups.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (flight controller software) along with a hardware board it could run on. That same year Munoz, who  had built a  traditional RC  helicopter UAV able to fly autonomously,  won  the first Sparkfun AVC competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://avc.sparkfun.com/2009|title=2009 AVC - AVC.SFE|website=avc.sparkfun.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project grew further thanks to many members of the DIY Drones community, including Chris Anderson who championed the project and had founded the forum based community earlier in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.ardupilot.com/ Developer | APM open source autopilot]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-03-28/drone-makers-get-help-from-the-open-source-diy-crowd Drones Makers Get Help From the Open Source Crowd]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ArduPilot version supported only fixed-wing aircraft and was based on a [[thermopile]] sensor, which relies on determining the location of the horizon relative to the aircraft by measuring the difference in temperature between the sky and the ground.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dev.ardupilot.com/ Developer | APM open source autopilot]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the system was improved to replace thermopiles with an [[Inertial measurement unit|Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU) using a combination of [[accelerometers]], [[gyroscopes]] and [[magnetometers]].  Vehicle support was later expanded to other vehicle types which led to the Copter, Plane, Rover, and Submarine subprojects.

The years 2011 and 2012 witnessed an explosive growth in the autopilot functionality and codebase size, thanks in large part to new participation from  [[Andrew Tridgell|Andrew "Tridge" Tridgell]] and HAL author Pat Hickey. Tridge's contributions included automatic testing and simulation capabilities for Ardupilot, along with PyMavlink and Mavproxy.  Hickey was instrumental in bringing the AP_ HAL library to the code base: HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) greatly simplified and modularized the code base by introducing and confining low-level hardware implementation specifics to a separate hardware library. The year 2012 also saw Randy Mackay taking the role of lead maintainer of Copter, after a request from former maintainer Jason Short, and Tridge taking over the role of lead Plane maintainer, after Doug Weibel who went on to earn a Ph.D. in Aerospace Engineering. Both Randy and Tridge are current lead maintainers to date.

The [[free software]] approach to  ArduPilot code development is similar to that of the [[Linux]] Operating system and the [[GNU Project]], and the [[PX4 autopilot|PX4/Pixhawk]] and [[Paparazzi Project]], where low cost and availability enabled  hobbyists   to build autonomous  small [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|remotely piloted aircraft]], such as [[micro air vehicle]]s and [[miniature UAV]]s. The drone industry, similarly, progressively leveraged ArduPilot code to build professional, high-end autonomous vehicles.

=== Maturity, 2013-2016 ===
While early versions of ArduPilot used the APM flight controller, an AVR CPU running the [[Arduino]] open-source programming language (which explains the "Ardu" part of the project name), later years witnessed  a significant re-write of the code base in  C++ with many supporting utilities written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]].

Between 2013 and 2014  ArduPilot  evolved to run on a range of hardware platforms and operating system beyond the original Arduino [[Atmel ARM-based processors|Atmel]] based microcontroller architecture, first with the commercial introduction of the Pixhawk  hardware flight controller, a collaborative effort between PX4, 3DRobotics and the ArduPilot development team,  and later to the Parrot's Bebop2 and the  Linux-based  flight controllers like Raspberry Pi based NAVIO2 and BeagleBone based ErleBrain.   A key  event within this time period included the first flight of a plane under Linux in mid 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/first-flight-of-ardupilot-on-linux|title=First flight of ArduPilot on Linux|website=diydrones.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late 2014  saw the formation of DroneCode,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/introducing-the-dronecode-foundation|title=Introducing the Dronecode Foundation|website=diydrones.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed to bring together the leading open source UAV software projects, and most notably to solidify the relationship and collaboration of the ArduPilot and the PX4 projects.  ArduPilot's involvement with DroneCode ended in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://diydrones.com/profiles/blogs/ardopilot-and-dronecode-part-ways|title=ArduPilot and DroneCode part ways|website=diydrones.com|language=en|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2015 was also a banner year for 3DRobotics, a heavy sponsor of ArduPilot development, with its introduction of the Solo quadcopter, an off the shelf quadcopter running ArduPilot.  Solo's  commercial success, however, was not to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ryanmac/2016/10/05/3d-robotics-solo-crash-chris-anderson/#5f58cfa63ff5|title=Behind The Crash Of 3D Robotics, North America's Most Promising Drone Company|last=Mac|first=Ryan|work=Forbes|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fall of 2015 again saw a key event in the history of the autopilot,  with a swarm of 50 planes running  ArduPilot simultaneously flown at the  Advanced Robotic Systems Engineering Laboratory (ARSENL) team at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]].

Within this time period, ArduPilot's code base was significantly [[Code refactoring|refactored]], to the point where it ceased to bear any similarity to its early Arduino years.

=== Current, 2018- ===
ArduPilot code evolution continues with support for integrating and communicating with powerful companion computers for autonomous navigation, plane support for additional VTOL architectures, integration with [[Robot Operating System|ROS]], support for [[Glider (sailplane)|gliders]], and tighter integration for submarines.  The  project evolves under the umbrella of ArduPilot.org, a project within the Software in the Public Interest (spi-inc.org) not-for-profit organisation.  ArduPilot is sponsored in part by a growing list of corporate partners.

===UAV Outback Challenge===

In 2012, the Canberra UAV Team successfully took first place in the prestigious [[UAV Outback Challenge]]. The CanberraUAV Team included ArduPlane Developers and the airplane flown was controlled by an APM 2 Autopilot.  In 2014 the CanberraUAV Team and ArduPilot took first place again, by successfully delivering a bottle to the "lost" hiker. In 2016 ArduPilot placed first in the technically more challenging competition, ahead of strong competition from international teams.

== Community ==
ArduPilot is jointly managed by a group of volunteers located around the world, using the Internet ([[Discourse (software)|discourse]] based forum, [[gitter]] channel) to communicate, plan, develop and support it. The development team meets weekly in a chat meeting, open to all, using [[Mumble (software)|Mumble]]. In addition, hundreds of users contribute ideas, code and documentation to the project. ArduPilot is licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] Version 3 and is free to download and use.

== Customizability ==

The flexibility of ArduPilot makes it very popular in the DIY field but it has also gained popularity with professional users and companies. 3DRobotics' Solo quadcopter, for instance, uses ArduPilot, as have a large number of professional aerospace companies such as Boeing &lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/story/boeing-delivery-drone/&lt;/ref&gt;.  The flexibility allows for support of a wide variety of frame types and sizes, different sensors, camera gimbals and RC transmitters depending on the operator's preferences.

ArduPilot has been successfully integrated into many airplanes such as the [[Bixler (aircraft)|Bixler]] 2.0. The customizability and ease of installation have allowed the ArduPilot platform to be integrated for a variety of missions. The Mission Planner (Windows) ground control station allows the user to easily configure, program, use, or simulate an ArduPilot board for purposes such as mapping, search and rescue, and surveying areas.

'''Benoît Lacroix''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dominican Order|OP]] [[Order of Canada|OC]] [[National Order of Quebec|GOQ]] [[Royal Society of Canada|MSRC]]}} ({{IPA-fr|bənwa lakʁwa}}; 8 September 1915 – 2 March 2016) was a Quebec theologian, philosopher, Dominican priest, professor in [[medieval studies]] and historian of the Medieval period, and author of almost 50 works and a great number of articles.&lt;ref name=udm&gt;[http://www.125.umontreal.ca/Pionniers/Lacroix.html Université de Montréal: Nos pionnières et nos pionniers - Benoît Lacroix] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
He was born '''Joachim Lacroix''' in [[Saint-Michel-de-Bellechasse]], [[Quebec]], one of five children to Caïus Lacroix and Rose-Anna Blais. He studied at Collège de Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière obtaining a baccalaureate in the arts in 1936. The same year, he entered the Dominican school in [[Saint-Hyacinthe]] to study religion. He was ordained a priest with the [[Dominican Order]] on 5 July 1941, obtaining a degree in [[theology]] from the Dominican College in [[Ottawa]] in 1941. According to Pietro Boglioni, a historian who wrote a comprehensive biography of Lacroix, he was named Benoît after becoming a Dominican priest, in memory of [[Pope Benedict XI]] (in French, Benoît XI), a Dominican pope from the Middle Ages. After entering the Dominican Order, Father Benoît Lacroix wanted to travel in a mission to Europe to specialize in liturgical studies. But [[World War II]] halted his ambitions and instead he studied for a Ph.D. in Mediaeval Sciences from the [[Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies]] in Toronto in 1951, under the guidance of philosopher, historian professor [[Étienne Gilson]], who encouraged him to study [[Historiography]]. His thesis was titled "Les Débuts de l'historiographie chrétienne" (The Beginnings of Christian Historiography") followed by "L'Histoire dans l'antiquité" (History in Antiquity) in 1951 with a preface by historian philosopher and [[Early Christianity]] expert professor [[Henri-Irénée Marrou]]. He completed his post-doctoral studies at [[École pratique des hautes études]], and at [[École Nationale des Chartes]] both in Paris in 1952-1953&lt;ref name=udm/&gt; and at [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] in 1959-1960, with a bursary from the [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].

===Career===
Between 1945 and 1985, he lectured at various periods at the Institute of Medieval Studies at [[Université de Montréal]], and was appointed director of the Institute between 1963 and 1969.&lt;ref name=udm/&gt; He was also an invited professor and lecturer at universities in [[Kyoto University]] in Japan in 1961, the [[National University of Rwanda]] in Butare, Rwanda in 1965–1966 and at the Chair of Quebec Civilisation at [[University of Caen Normandy]], in Caen France (1973–1976).&lt;ref name=udm/&gt;

According to historian Guy Laperrière, Benoît Lacroix's initial literary beginning were his writings about literature, art and history particularly in ''La Revue Dominicaine''. Starting in 1962, he was collaborating with Father [[Henri-Marie Bradet]], the founder of the publication who also founded ''Maintenant'', another important intellectual publication. Lacroix succeeded Bradet at ''La Revue Dominicaine'' in 1985 after Bradet was stripped of his duties as editor in chief during the turbulent times of the [[Quiet Revolution]] (Révolution tranquille in French) on what became known as the "Bradet Affair" which was interpreted as a "freedom of expression" issue and his departure a result of a scheme to silence him by the Quebec provincial superior of the Dominican Order Father Thomas-M. Rondeau after having received stern warnings about Bradet from his Dominican superiors in Rome. Lacroix shaken by the affair wrote the preface to a biographical book by Denyse Boucher St-Pierre in 1973 in memory of Father Bradet.

In 1968, Lacroix founded the ''Centre d'études des religions populaires'' (Centre of Studies of Popular Religions). Between 1968 and 1971, the Centre published 12 papers, ''Cahiers d'études des religions populaires'' and organized between 1970 and 1982, 11 academic conferences about popular religion in French-speaking Catholics in Quebec, Ontario and Acadie.

In collaboration with Jacques Brault, Lacroix published a critical edition on the works of the Quebec poet and writer [[Hector de Saint-Denys Garneau]] under the title ''Œuvres de Saint-Denys Garneau'' in 1971.

From 1973 to 1976, Lacroix was director of chair of Quebec Studies at [[University of Caen Normandy]] in France, greatly encouraging the cultural and academic exchange between France and Quebec, particularly in education. Hundreds of professors and students benefited from the exchanges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfqlmc.org/bulletin-memoires-vives/bulletins-anterieurs/bulletin-nd22-octobre-2007/215 cfqlmc.org: La coopération franco-québécoise en éducation 1960-1980: l'âge d'or] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821061652/http://www.cfqlmc.org/bulletin-memoires-vives/bulletins-anterieurs/bulletin-nd22-octobre-2007/215 |date=2014-08-21 }} {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving the chair, the position was taken by sociologist Jean-Charles Falardeau.

In the mid-1980s, he left the academic life at the university, to work more freely as author, presenter, communicator and thinker, gaining wide fame in religious and intellectual circles in Quebec according to professor and historian Pietro Boglioni.

In 1979 he was a founding member of ''Institut québécois de recherche'' (IQRC, Quebec Research Institute).&lt;ref name=udm/&gt; headed by sociologist Fernand Dumont under the ministerial jurisdiction of [[Camille Laurin]], Minister of State for Cultural and Scientific Development in Quebec at the time, from 1980 to 1986, was a member of the Science Committee of the Institute, heading notably in 1980 the IQRC sub-group specializing in popular religions that was made of Lacroix, Lucille Côté, Hélène Dionne, Michèle Trudel-Drouin, Danielle Nepveu and Louise Rondeau, including organizing of an international academic conference in 1982 on studies of popular religions in close collaboration with Jean-Paul Montminy, another father from the Dominican Order, assisted by  Fernand Dumont, Pierre Savard et Jean Simard. With Simard, Benoît Lacroix published ''Religion populaire, religion de clercs?'' (Popular religion, the religion of the clergy?) in 1984 followed by another co-authorship with Madeleine Grammond in 1985 titled ''Religion populaire au Québec. Typologie des sources: Bibliographie sélective (1900-1980)''. A Spanish translation of his work was published by [[Universidad Católica Santa María La Antigua]] in [[Panama City]] under the title ''Tipologia en la religiosidad popular en Canada''.

He also published popular works like ''La religion de mon père'' (The Religion of My Father) in 1986 and ''La foi de ma mère'' (The Faith of My Mother) in 2001. He also took part in a number of radio and television shows about the popular religion.

Between 1987 and 2010, Benoît Lacroix wrote and published a number of essays with a spiritual and poetic tendency in Montreal French-language daily ''[[Le Devoir]]''. In 2012, Quebec journalist Josée Blanchette published a long documentary about Father Benoît Lacroix and the Convent of Saint-Albert-le-Grand of the Dominicans, on chemin de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine à Montréal, under the title ''Bonté divine: 24 heures au couvent des dominicains''.

He was a friend and greatly respected by academicians as well as intellectuals and personalities from all walks of life including professor Étienne Gilson, French philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]], Canadian Prime Minister [[Pierre Elliott Trudeau]], Mgr. [[Félix-Antoine Savard]], Father [[Georges-Henri Lévesque]], [[Abbé Pierre]], sociologist, philosopher, theologian and poet [[Fernand Dumont]] and poet and singer-songwriter [[Gilles Vigneault]] and writers Robert Élie, [[Jean Le Moyne]] and Jacques Brault.

In 2012, Lacroix celebrated 75 years of priesthood and religious life.&lt;ref name=devoir&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ledevoir.com/societe/actualites-en-societe/356164/tout-est-a-repenser|author=Amélie Daoust-Boisvert|title="Tout est à repenser" - Les étudiants sont là pour nous le dire, à leur manière, dit le père Benoît Lacroix, qui vient de célébrer 75 ans de vie religieuse|publisher=''[[Le Devoir]]''|date=6 August 2012|accessdate=3 March 2016|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacroix became a [[centenarian]], in September 2015, and died of [[pneumonia]] on 2 March 2016.

==Awards and honours==
[[Image:Benoit Lacroix 2.png|thumb|right|245px|Father Benoît Lacroix in the library of Couvent Saint-Albert-le-Grand of the Dominicans in Montréal (13 August 2014)]]
In 1971, he became a member of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and a member of the French [[Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques]].

In 1981, he was awarded the prestigious [[Prix Léon-Gérin]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prixduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/recherche/desclaureat.php?noLaureat=135 Prix du Quebec: Benoît Lacroix - Lauréat 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; an award established by the [[Government of Quebec]] as part of the [[Prix du Québec]], which "goes to researchers in one of the social sciences". The prize committee sited his works as a theologian, a specialist in popular religions, writer, literary historian and Dominican father, quoting sociologist, theologian, priest and writer Jacques Grand'Maison that Lacoix was one of the best witnesses of Quebec's history from medieval times and as a historian, in the intellectual tradition that fascilated western thinking. His works also permitted a better understanding of Quebec history in new eyes, adding that since the 1950s and the very first of his publications with ''Pourquoi aimer le Moyen Âge'' (Why Love the Middle Ages), he showed his expertise in medieval studies and in popular religions.

In 1982, he became a member of Société des Dix, a group of Quebec historians and in 1985, became an Officer of [[Order of Canada]] (O.C.). In 1097, he received the [[Pierre Chauveau Medal]] awarded by the [[Royal Society of Canada]] "for a distinguished contribution to knowledge in the humanities other than Canadian literature and Canadian history" and in 1990, received an honorary Doctorat honoris causa from [[Université de Sherbrooke]]. He became a Knight of [[National Order of Quebec]] and 5 years later Grand Officer of the same Quebec order.

The public library in [[Saint-Michel-de-Bellechasse]], the hometown of Benoît Lacroix was renamed "Bibliothèque Benoît-Lacroix" in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mabibliotheque.ca/capitale-nationale-et-chaudiere-appalaches/fr/bibliotheques-horaire-et-localisation/B288-bibliotheque-benoit-lacroix/index.aspx mabibliotheque.ca: Bibliothèque Benoît-Lacroix page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Creative computing''' covers the interdisciplinary area at the cross-over of the [[creative arts]] and [[computing]]. Issues of [[creativity]] include [[knowledge discovery]], for example.&lt;ref name="yang15"&gt;{{cite book| doi=10.1007/978-3-319-23766-4_7 | chapter=Knowledge Discovery in Creative Computing for Creative Tasks | first1=Lu | last1=Zhang | first2=Hongji | last2=Yang | authorlink2=Hongji Yang | title=Creativity in Intelligent, Technologies and Data Science | volume=535 | publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] | series=Communications in Computer and Information Science | pages=93–104 | year=2015 | isbn=978-3-319-23765-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Overview==
The ''International Journal of Creative Computing'' describes creative computing as follows:&lt;ref name="IJCrC"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.inderscience.com/ijcrc | title=International Journal of Creative Computing | publisher=[[Inderscience Publishers]] | accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Creative computing refers to a meta-technology to coalesce knowledge in computing and other disciplines.  People use computers as aids to  creativity and creative-computing topics may reshape the world as we know it. Applications are seen in [[arts]], [[entertainment]]/[[games]], [[mobile applications]], [[multimedia]], product/[[web design]] and other [[interactive system]]s.&lt;!-- ICRC aims to shape a significant body of creative computing research. --&gt;}}

Creative computing is [[interdisciplinary]] in nature and topics relating to it include [[Application software|applications]], [[Software development|development method]], [[evaluation]], [[Conceptual model|modeling]], [[philosophy]], [[principle]]s, [[Operating environment|support environment]], and [[theory]].&lt;ref name="IJCrC" /&gt;

The term "creative computing" is used both in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]] (e.g., at [[Harvard University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/ | title=Creative Computing – An Introductory Computing Curriculum using Scratch | publisher=[[Harvard University]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MIT]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://cs4hs.media.mit.edu/ | title=Creative Computing | publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] | work=[[MIT Media Lab]] | accessdate=24 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''''Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers''''' (English: ''Encyclopedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts''),&lt;ref&gt;Ian Buchanan, ''A Dictionary of Critical Theory'', Oxford University Press, 2010, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; better known as '''''Encyclopédie''''', was a general [[encyclopedia]] published in [[France]] between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the [[Encyclopédistes]]. It was edited by [[Denis Diderot]] and, until 1759, co-edited by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]].

The ''Encyclopédie'' is most famous for representing the thought of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. According to Denis Diderot in the article "Encyclopédie", the ''Encyclopédie'''s aim was "to change the way people think" and for people to be able to inform themselves and to know things.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Hunt, p. 611&lt;/ref&gt; He and the other contributors advocated for the [[secularization]] of learning away from the [[Jesuits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=University of the State of New York|title=Annual Report of the Regents, Volume 106|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABxEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot wanted to incorporate all of the world's knowledge into the ''Encyclopédie'' and hoped that the text could disseminate all this information to the public and future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Diderot as quoted in Kramnick, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also the first encyclopedia to include contributions from many named contributors, and it was the first general encyclopedia to describe the [[Artes Mechanicae|mechanical arts]]. In the first publication, seventeen folio volumes were accompanied by detailed engravings. Later volumes were published without the engravings, in order to better reach a wide audience within Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M. (2013). ''Books: a living history''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The ''Encyclopédie'' was originally conceived as a French translation of [[Ephraim Chambers]]'s ''[[Cyclopaedia, or Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'' (1728).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Magee, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; Ephraim Chambers had first published his ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences]]'' in two volumes in London in 1728, following several dictionaries of arts and sciences that had emerged in Europe since the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lough (1971. pp. 3–5)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RS 1970"&gt;[[Robert Shackleton]] "[https://books.google.com/books?id=qEwLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA390 The ''Encyclopedie'']" in: ''Proceedings, American Philosophical Society'' (vol. 114, No. 5, 1970. p. 39)&lt;/ref&gt; This work became quite renowned, and four editions were published between 1738 and 1742. An Italian translation appeared between 1747 and 1754. In France a member of the banking family Lambert had started translating Chambers into French,&lt;ref&gt;''Précis de la vie du citoyen Lambert'', Bibliothèque nationale, Ln. 11217; Listed in Shackleton (1970, p. 130).&lt;/ref&gt; but in 1745 the expatriate Englishman [[John Mills (encyclopedist)|John Mills]] and German [[Gottfried Sellius]] were the first to actually prepare a French edition of Ephraim Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'' for publication, which they entitled ''Encyclopédie''.

Early in 1745 a prospectus for the ''Encyclopédie''&lt;ref&gt;Recently rediscovered in the ''[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]'', see [http://blog.bnf.fr/lecteurs/index.php/2010/12/prospectus-pour-une-traduction-francaise-de-la-cyclopaedia-de-chambers/ Prospectus pour une traduction française de la Cyclopaedia de Chambers] blog.bnf.fr, Dec. 2010&lt;/ref&gt; was published to attract subscribers to the project. This four page prospectus was illustrated by Jean-Michel Papillon,&lt;ref&gt;[[André-François Le Breton]], Jean-Michel Papillon, Ephraim Chambers. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-4AxtwAACAAJ Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire universel des arts et des sciences]''. 1745&lt;/ref&gt; and accompanied by a plan, stating that the work would be published in five volumes from June 1746 until the end of 1748.&lt;ref&gt;Reproduction from 1745 original in: Luneau de Boisjermain (1771) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dIdYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 Mémoire pour les libraires associés à l'Encyclopédie: contre le sieur Luneau de Boisjermain].'' p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; The text was translated by Mills and Sellius, and it was corrected by an unnamed person, who appears to have been [[Denis Diderot]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Blom]]. ''Encyclopédie: the triumph of reason in an unreasonable age Fourth Estate'', 2004. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospectus was reviewed quite positively and cited at some length in several journals.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=9OMTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA70 Prospectus du Dictionnaire de Chambers, traduit en François, et proposé par souscription]" in: M. Desfontaines. ''Jugemens sur quelques ouvrages nouveaux.'' Vol 8. (1745). p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'' journal was lavish in its praise: "voici deux des plus fortes entreprises de Littérature qu'on ait faites depuis long-temps" (here are two of the greatest efforts undertaken in literature in a very long time).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eX9KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA934 Review] in: ''Mémoires pour l'histoire des sciences et des beaux arts'', May 1745, Nr. 2. pp. 934–38&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mercure Journal'' in June 1745, printed a 25-page article that specifically praised Mill's role as translator; the ''Journal'' introduced Mills as an English scholar who had been raised in France and who spoke both French and English as a native. The ''Journal'' reported that Mills had discussed the work with several academics, was zealous about the project, had devoted his fortune to support this enterprise, and was the sole owner of the publishing privilege.&lt;ref&gt;''Mercure Journal'' (1745, p. 87) cited in: Lough (1971), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the cooperation fell apart later on in 1745. [[André Le Breton]], the publisher commissioned to manage the physical production and sales of the volumes, cheated Mills out of the subscription money, claiming for example that Mills's knowledge of French was inadequate. In a confrontation Le Breton physically assaulted Mills. Mills took Le Breton to court, but the court decided in Le Breton's favour. Mills returned to England soon after the court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;Mills' summary of this matter was published in [[:fr:Pierre-Joseph Luneau de Boisjermain|Boisjermain]]'s ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=wRhBAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA162 Mémoire pour P. J. F. Luneau de Boisjermain av. d. Piéc. justif]'' 1771, pp. 162–63, where Boisjermain also gave his version of the events (pp. 2–5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Comments by Le Breton are published in his biography; in the preface of the encyclopedia; in John Lough (1971); etc.&lt;/ref&gt; For his new editor, Le Breton settled on the mathematician [[Jean Paul de Gua de Malves]]. Among those hired by Malves were the young [[Étienne Bonnot de Condillac]], [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], and [[Denis Diderot]]. Within thirteen months, in August 1747, Gua de Malves was fired for being an ineffective leader. Le Breton then hired Diderot and d'Alembert to be the new editors.&lt;ref&gt;Blom, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot would remain as editor for the next twenty-five years, seeing the ''Encyclopédie'' through to its completion; d'Alembert would leave this role in 1758. As d'Alembert worked on the ''Encyclopédie'', its title expanded. As of 1750, the full title was ''Encyclopédie, ou Dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers, par une société de gens de lettres, mis en ordre par M. Diderot de l'Académie des Sciences et Belles-Lettres de Prusse, et quant à la partie mathématique, par M. d'Alembert de l'Académie royale des Sciences de Paris, de celle de Prusse et de la Société royale de Londres.'' ("Encyclopedia: or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts, by a Company of Persons of Letters, edited by M. Diderot of the Academy of Sciences and ''[[Belles-lettres]]'' of Prussia: as to the Mathematical Portion, arranged by M. d'Alembert of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris, to the Academy of Sciences in Prussia and to the Royal Society of London.") The title page was amended as d'Alembert acquired more titles.

==Publication==
[[File:Encyclopedie frontispice section 256px.jpg|thumb|Extract from the [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of the ''Encyclopédie'' (1772). It was drawn by [[Charles-Nicolas Cochin]] and engraved by Bonaventure-Louis Prévost. The work is laden with [[symbol]]ism: The figure in the centre represents truth—surrounded by bright light (the central symbol of the Enlightenment). Two other figures on the right, reason and philosophy, are tearing the veil from truth.]]
The work consisted of 28 volumes, with 71,818 articles and 3,129 illustrations. The first seventeen volumes were published between 1751 and 1765; eleven volumes of plates were finished by 1772. Engraver [[Robert Bénard]] provided at least 1,800 plates for the work. Because of its occasional radical contents (see "Contents" below), the ''Encyclopédie'' caused much controversy in conservative circles, and on the initiative of the [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury#Opposition to the Encyclopédie|Parlement of Paris]], the French government suspended the encyclopedia's ''privilège'' in 1759.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Magee, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the suspension, work continued "in secret," partially because the project had highly placed supporters, such as [[Guillaume-Chrétien de Lamoignon de Malesherbes|Malesherbes]] and [[Madame de Pompadour]]. The authorities deliberately ignored the continued work; they thought their official ban was sufficient to appease the church and other enemies of the project.

During the "secretive" period, Diderot accomplished a well-known work of subterfuge. The title pages of volumes 1 through 7, published between 1751 and 1757, claimed Paris as the place of publication. However, the title pages of the subsequent text volumes, 8 through 17, published together in 1765, show Neufchastel as the place of publication. Neufchastel (now Neuchâtel) is safely across the French border in what is now part Switzerland but which was then an independent principality,&lt;ref&gt;Matheson, D (1992) ''Postcompulsory Education in Suisse romande'', unpublished PhD thesis, University of Glasgow&lt;/ref&gt; where official production of the ''Encyclopédie'' was secure from interference by agents of the French state. In particular, regime opponents of the ''Encyclopédie'' could not seize the production plates for the ''Encyclopédie'' in Paris because those printing plates ostensibly existed only in Switzerland. Meanwhile, the actual production of volumes 8 through 17 quietly continued in Paris.

In 1775, [[Charles Joseph Panckoucke]] obtained the rights to reissue the work. He issued five volumes of supplementary material and a two-volume index from 1776 to 1780. Some scholars include these seven "extra" volumes as part of the first full issue of the ''Encyclopédie'', for a total of 35 volumes, although they were not written or edited by the original authors.

&lt;!-- info taken from the French article --&gt;From 1782 to 1832, Panckoucke and his successors published an expanded edition of the work in some 166 volumes as the ''[[Encyclopédie méthodique]]''. That work, enormous for its time, occupied a thousand workers in production and 2,250 contributors.&lt;!-- From where this is it refers to the EM, but elsewhere the ''Encyclopédie''. Remove for now: The run of the press was 4,250 copies — a ridiculously small number for the present but very large for the 18th century where editions rarely exceeded 1,500 copies. --&gt;

==Contributors==
Since the objective of the editors of the ''Encyclopédie'' was to gather all the knowledge in the world, Diderot and D'Alembert knew they would need various contributors to help them with their project.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the [[philosophes]] ([[intellectuals]] of the French [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]) contributed to the ''Encyclopédie'', including Diderot himself, [[Voltaire]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Charles de Secondat, baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The most prolific contributor was [[Louis de Jaucourt]], who wrote 17,266 articles between 1759 and 1765, or about eight per day, representing a full 25% of the ''Encyclopédie''. The publication became a place where these contributors could share their ideas and interests.

Still, as [[Frank Kafker]] has argued, the Encyclopedists were not a unified group:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camargofoundation.org/fellowdetails_new05.asp?recno=357 |title=Fellow Project Details |publisher=The Camargo Foundation |date= |accessdate=March 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... despite their reputation, [the Encyclopedists] were not a close-knit group of [[Radicalization|radicals]] intent on subverting the Old Regime in France. Instead they were a disparate group of men of letters, physicians, scientists, craftsmen and scholars ... even the small minority who were persecuted for writing articles belittling what they viewed as unreasonable customs—thus weakening the might of the Catholic Church and undermining that of the monarchy—did not envision that their ideas would encourage a revolution.}}

Following is a list of notable contributors with their area of contribution (for a more detailed list, see [[Encyclopédistes]]):

*[[Jean Le Rond d'Alembert]] – editor; science (especially mathematics), contemporary affairs, philosophy, religion, among others
*[[Claude Bourgelat]] – manège, farriery
*[[André Le Breton]] – chief publisher; article on printer's ink &lt;!--to be noted elsewhere: he was the only person to have participated for the entire duration of the project.--&gt;
*[[Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton]] – natural history
*[[Denis Diderot]] – chief editor; economics, mechanical arts, philosophy, politics, religion, among others
*[[Baron d'Holbach]] – science (chemistry, mineralogy), politics, religion, among others
*[[Louis de Jaucourt|Chevalier Louis de Jaucourt]] – economics, literature, medicine, politics, bookbinding, among others
*[[Jean-Baptiste de La Chapelle]] – mathematics
*[[Abbé]] [[André Morellet]] – theology, philosophy
*[[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] – part of the article "Goût" ("Taste")
*[[François Quesnay]] – articles on tax farmers and grain
*[[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] – music, political theory
*[[Anne Robert Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune]] – economics, etymology, philosophy, physics
*[[Voltaire]] – history, literature, philosophy

Due to the controversial nature of some of the articles, several of its editors went to jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Ian|title=An Encyclopedia Brown story: Bound and determined to fight for the facts in the time of Trump|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/an-encyclopedia-ian-brown-story/article35586033/|accessdate=8 July 2017|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=8 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contents and controversies ==

===Structure===
[[File:ENC SYSTEME FIGURE.jpeg|300px|thumb|Fig. 3: "[[Figurative system of human knowledge]]", the structure that the ''Encyclopédie'' organised knowledge into. It had three main branches: memory, reason, and imagination.]] Like most encyclopedias, the ''Encyclopédie'' attempted to collect and summarize human knowledge in a variety of fields and topics, ranging from philosophy to theology to science and the arts. The ''Encyclopédie'' was controversial for reorganizing knowledge based on [[humanism|human]] [[rationalism|reason]] instead of by nature or theology.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, pp. 7,  539&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge and intellect branched from the three categories of human thought, whereas all other perceived aspects of knowledge, including theology, were simply branches or components of these man made categories.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 1993, pp. 18–23&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction to the ''Encyclopédie'', D'Alembert's "[[Preliminary Discourse]]", is considered an important exposition of Enlightenment ideals.  Among other things, it presents a [[Figurative system of human knowledge|taxonomy of human knowledge]] (see Fig. 3), which was inspired by [[Francis Bacon]]'s ''[[The Advancement of Learning]]''. The three main branches of knowledge are: "Memory"/History, "Reason"/Philosophy, and "Imagination"/Poetry. This tree of knowledge was created to help readers evaluate the usefulness of the content within the ''Encyclopédie'', and to organize its content.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; Notable is the fact that theology is ordered under "Philosophy" and that "Knowledge of God" is only a few nodes away from "[[Divination]]" and "[[Black Magic]]".

===Religious and political controversies===
The authors of the ''Encyclopédie'' challenged religious authority. The authors, especially Diderot and d'Alembert, located religion within a system of reason and philosophy. They did not reject all religious claims, but believed theology and notions of [[God]] must be proven. [[Louis de Jaucourt]] therefore harshly criticized superstition as an intellectual error in his article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 51–2 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 0-226-40336-X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"&gt;Lough, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; They therefore doubted the authenticity of presupposed historical events cited in the Bible and questioned the validity of miracles and the Resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=Martyn|title=Books: A Living story|date=2011|publisher=Getty Publications|location=Los Angeles|isbn=978-1-60606-083-4|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some contemporary scholars argue the skeptical view of miracles in the ''Encyclopédie'' may be interpreted in terms of "[[Protestant]] debates about the cessation of the charismata."&lt;ref&gt;Josephson-Storm (2017), p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The writers emphasized an individual’s right to religious sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Lough, p. 196"/&gt;

These challenges led to suppression from church and state authorities. The ''Encyclopédie'' and its contributors endured many attacks and attempts at censorship by the clergy or other censors, which threatened the publication of the project as well as the authors themselves. The [[Curia regis#France|King's Council]] suppressed the ''Encyclopédie'' in 1759.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=780 "Diderot's Encyclopedia"]. Historical Text Archive.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Catholic Church]], under [[Pope Clement XIII]], placed it on its [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum|list of banned books]]. Prominent intellectuals criticized it, most famously [[Jean-Jacques Lefranc, Marquis de Pompignan|Lefranc de Pompignan]] at the [[Académie française|French Academy]]. A playwright, [[Charles Palissot de Montenoy]], wrote a play called ''Les Philosophes'' to criticize the ''Encyclopédie''. When Abbé [[André Morellet]], one of the contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'', wrote a mock preface for it, he was sent to the [[Bastille]] due to allegations of libel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aldridge|first=Alfred Owen|title=Voltaire and the Century of Light|year=2015|publisher=Princeton Legacy Library|pages=266|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bEl9BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA266&amp;lpg=PA266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To defend themselves from controversy, the encyclopedia’s articles wrote of theological topics in a mixed manner. Some articles supported orthodoxy, and some included overt criticisms of Christianity. To avoid direct retribution from censors, writers often hid criticism in obscure articles or expressed it in ironic terms.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the contributors still openly attacked the Catholic Church in certain articles with examples including criticizing excess festivals, monasteries, and celibacy of the clergy.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 258–66&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and society===
The ''Encyclopédie'' is often seen as an influence for the [[French Revolution]] because of its emphasis on Enlightenment political theories. Diderot and other authors, in famous articles such as "Political Authority", emphasized the shift of the origin of political authority from divinity or heritage to the people. This Enlightenment ideal, espoused by Rousseau and others, advocated that people have the right to consent to their government in a form of social contract.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major, contentious component of political issues in the ''Encyclopédie'' was personal or natural rights. Articles such as "Natural Rights" by Diderot explained the relationship between individuals and the general will. The natural state of humanity, according to the authors, is barbaric and unorganized. To balance the desires of individuals and the needs of the general will, humanity requires civil society and laws that benefit all persons. Writers, to varying degrees, criticized [[Thomas Hobbes]]' notions of a selfish humanity that requires a sovereign to rule over it.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, pp. 191–92&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of economics, the ''Encyclopédie'' expressed favor for [[laissez-faire]] ideals or principles of economic liberalism. Articles concerning economics or markets, such as "Economic Politics", generally favored free competition and denounced monopolies. Articles often criticized guilds as creating monopolies and approved of state intervention to remove such monopolies. The writers advocated extending laissez-faire principles of liberalism from the market to the individual level, such as with privatization of education and opening of careers to all levels of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Lough, pp. 331–35&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and technology===
At the same time, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a vast compendium of knowledge, notably on the technologies of the period, describing the traditional craft tools and processes. Much information was taken from the ''[[Descriptions des Arts et Métiers]]''. These articles applied a scientific approach to understanding the mechanical and production processes, and offered new ways to improve machines to make them more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;Brewer 2011, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot felt that people should have access to "useful knowledge" that they can apply to their everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;Burke, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The ''Encyclopédie'' played an important role in the intellectual ferment leading to the French Revolution. "No encyclopaedia perhaps has been of such political importance, or has occupied so conspicuous a place in the civil and literary history of its century. It sought not only to give information, but to guide opinion," wrote the [[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica|1911 ''Encyclopædia Britannica'']]. In ''The Encyclopédie and the Age of Revolution'', a work published in conjunction with a 1989 exhibition of the ''Encyclopédie'' at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], Clorinda Donato writes the following:
{{quote|The encyclopedians successfully argued and marketed their belief in the potential of reason and unified knowledge to empower human will and thus helped to shape the social issues that the French Revolution would address. Although it is doubtful whether the many artisans, technicians, or laborers whose work and presence and interspersed throughout the ''Encyclopédie'' actually read it, the recognition of their work as equal to that of intellectuals, clerics, and rulers prepared the terrain for demands for increased representation. Thus the ''Encyclopédie'' served to recognize and galvanize a new power base, ultimately contributing to the destruction of old values and the creation of new ones (12).}}

While many contributors to the ''Encyclopédie'' had no interest in radically reforming French society, the ''Encyclopédie'' as a whole pointed that way. The ''Encyclopédie'' denied that the teachings of the Catholic Church could be treated as authoritative in matters of science. The editors also refused to treat the decisions of political powers as definitive in intellectual or artistic questions. Some articles talked about changing social and political institutions that would improve their society for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;Spielvogel, pp. 480–81&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Paris was the intellectual capital of Europe at the time and that many European leaders used French as their administrative language, these ideas had the capacity to spread.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The ''Encyclopédie''{{'}}s influence continues today. Historian Dan O'Sullivan compares it to [[Wikipedia]]:

{{quote|Like Wikipedia, the ''Encyclopédie'' was a collaborative effort involving numerous writers and technicians. As do [[Wikipedians]] today, Diderot and his colleagues needed to engage with the latest technology in dealing with the problems of designing an up-to-date encyclopedia. These included what kind of information to include, how to set up links between various articles, and how to achieve the maximum readership.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Quotations==
* The goal of an encyclopedia is to assemble all the knowledge scattered on the surface of the earth, to demonstrate the general system to the people with whom we live, &amp; to transmit it to the people who will come after us, so that the works of centuries past is not useless to the centuries which follow, that our descendants, by becoming more learned, may become more virtuous &amp; happier, &amp; that we do not die without having merited being part of the human race. (''Encyclopédie'', Diderot)&lt;ref&gt;Blom, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"En effet, le but d'une Encyclopédie est de rassembler les connoissances éparses sur la surface de la terre; d'en exposer le système général aux hommes avec qui nous vivons, &amp; de le transmettre aux hommes qui viendront après nous; afin que les travaux des siecles passés n'aient pas été des travaux inutiles pour les siecles qui succéderont; que nos neveux, devenant plus instruits, deviennent en même tems plus vertueux &amp; plus heureux, &amp; que nous ne mourions pas sans avoir bien mérité du genre humain." From [http://artflsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.4:1252.encyclopedie0513 uchicago.edu].&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Reason is to the philosopher what [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]] is to the Christian...  Other men walk in darkness; the philosopher, who has the same passions, acts only after reflection;  he walks through the night, but it is preceded by a torch.  The philosopher forms his principles on an infinity of particular observations.  He does not confuse truth with plausibility; he takes for truth what is true, for forgery what is false, for doubtful what is doubtful, and probable what is probable.  The philosophical spirit is thus a spirit of observation and accuracy." (''Philosophers'', Dumarsais)
* "If exclusive privileges were not granted, and if the financial system would not tend to concentrate wealth, there would be few great fortunes and no quick wealth.  When the means of growing rich is divided between a greater number of citizens, wealth will also be more evenly distributed; extreme poverty and extreme wealth would be also rare." (''Wealth'', Diderot)
* "[[Urena lobata|Aguaxima]], a plant growing in Brazil and on the islands of South America. This is all that we are told about it; and I would like to know for whom such descriptions are made. It cannot be for the natives of the countries concerned, who are likely to know more about the aguaxima than is contained in this description, and who do not need to learn that the aguaxima grows in their country. It is as if you said to a Frenchman that the pear tree is a tree that grows in France, in Germany, etc. It is not meant for us either, for what do we care that there is a tree in Brazil named aguaxima, if all we know about it is its name? What is the point of giving the name? It leaves the ignorant just as they were and teaches the rest of us nothing. If all the same I mention this plant here, along with several others that are described just as poorly, then it is out of consideration for certain readers who prefer to find nothing in a dictionary article or even to find something stupid than to find no article at all." (''Aguaxima'', Diderot)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1717">The '''Enron Code of Ethics''' was a 64-page booklet published by [[Enron]] Corporation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mishkenot.org.il/Hebrew/docs/ethics/%D7%A7%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A9%D7%9C%20%D7%90%D7%A8%D7%92%D7%95%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%9D%20%D7%A2%D7%A1%D7%A7%D7%99%D7%99%D7%9D/Enron%20Code%20Of%20Ethics.pdf] Scan of the complete book by [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt; the last known edition of which was in July 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/enrons-code-ethics] Article and scans of the book on [[The Smoking Gun]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sale of copies of the booklet on [[Ebay]] has passed into internet folklore. 
An article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' for February 10, 2002 reported a final bid level on one copy of USD 202.50. 
Another sale on Ebay (which ran from February 13 to February 20, 2002) carried the item number "1074129276". In the latter sale, the booklet was sold together with a cup, also allegedly an Enron product, which featured text extolling the virtues of the Enron retirement plan.

The content of the booklet has attracted less interest than the fact that Enron had a code of ethics.

*The sociologist [[Erving Goffman]] drew for his studies of ritual in everyday life on what he called Post as "a good source of half-analysed material...in the ritual idiom of a hypothetical class".&lt;ref&gt;E Goffman, ''Relations in Public'' (Penguin 1971) p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Joan Didion]] commended Emily Post for the practical wisdom of her chapter on Funerals (Ch XXIV), especially in relation to the physiology of grief and distress.&lt;ref&gt;J Didion, ''The Year of Magical Thinking'' (London 2005) p. 58-9&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4501">'''Eugeniu Sperantia''' ({{OldStyleDate|May 18|1888|May 6}} &amp;ndash; January 11/12, 1972) was a [[Romania]]n poet, aesthetician, essayist, sociologist and philosopher.

He was born in [[Bucharest]] to folklorist [[Theodor Speranția]] and his wife Elena (''née'' Cruceanu), a relative of poet [[Mihail Cruceanu]]. He attended primary and high school in his native city, graduating in 1906. That year, he made his published debut, in [[Ovid Densusianu]]'s ''[[Vieața Nouă]]''. Prior to that, he had frequented [[Alexandru Macedonski]]'s circle. In 1910, he graduated from the philosophy faculty of [[Bucharest University]]. Two years later, he received a doctorate in literature and philosophy; his thesis dealt with pragmatic apriorism. He took specialty courses in Germany from 1913 to 1914. A high school teacher from the time he was still a student, Sperantia was dispatched to the [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|newly acquired]] [[Transylvania]] province in the wake of World War I, serving as director of higher education for [[Cluj]] (1919-1921), professor at the [[Oradea]] law academy (1929-1934) and professor of sociology and philosophy of law at [[Cluj University]] (1934-1949). He contributed poems and articles to ''[[Flacăra]]'', ''Vieața Nouă'', ''Cele trei Crișuri'', ''Românul literar'', ''Revista celorlalți'', ''Farul'', ''Revue Roumaine'', ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', ''Gând românesc'', ''[[Gândirea]]'', ''Steaua'' and ''[[Familia (magazine)|Familia]]'', sometimes using the pen names Eugenius, Genică, Corina Lazzariny, Victor Olimp, Victor Spoială, Victor Talpă and Cerchez.&lt;ref name="sasu"/&gt;

Sperantia was an early participant in the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|local Symbolist movement]], drawing praise from Macedonski, Densusianu and [[Gheorghe Bogdan-Duică]]. Hailed, at the same time, by [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]] for his contributions to philosophy and sociology, he was a professor shaped in the spirit of [[Titu Maiorescu]]'s school. His published books include collections of Symbolist poems (''Zvonuri din necunoscut'', 1921; ''Pasul umbrelor și al veciei'', 1930, [[Romanian Writers' Society]] prize; ''Sus'', 1939), a novel (''Casa cu nalbă'', 1916), aesthetic studies (''Frumosul ca înaltă suferință'', 1921; ''"Papillons" de Schumann'', 1934, [[Romanian Academy]] prize), memoirs (''Figuri universitare'', 1967; ''Amintiri din lumea literară'', 1967), short biographies of musicians, philosophical essays, studies of psychology (''Psihologia gândirii'', 1922) and of philosophy of law (''Principii fundamentale de filosofie juridică'', 1936). A member of the Romanian Writers' Society from 1916, as well as of international associations for legal philosophers and sociologists, he took part in numerous congresses abroad. He also undertook a prodigious cultural activity in Transylvania in the first years after the war. A scholar of multiple disciplines with an encyclopedic spirit, Sperantia forms part of Romania's humanist tradition.&lt;ref name="sasu"&gt;Aurel Sasu (ed.), ''Dicționarul biografic al literaturii române'', vol. II, p. 592. Pitești: Editura Paralela 45, 2004. {{ISBN|973-697-758-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reached the retirement age in 1949, early in the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]]. This took place after he had undergone a concerted series of attacks during the preceding several years, both from committed Bolsheviks and from the opportunists who had turned to Marxism overnight.&lt;ref name="d324"&gt;[[Dan Dungaciu]], ''Elita Interbelică: Sociologia românească în context european'', p. 324-25.

'''Ganymede''' is an open source network directory management framework, designed to allow administrator teams to collaboratively manage subsets of an organization's [[directory service]]s, such as [[Network Information Service|NIS]], [[Domain Name System|DNS]], [[Active Directory]] / [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]], and [[RADIUS]], among others.  First announced and released at the 1998 [[Large Installation System Administration Conference|USENIX LISA]] conference,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/lisa-98/ganymede-extensible-and-customizable-directory-management-framework|title=Ganymede: An Extensible and Customizable Directory Management Framework|date=6 December 1998|publisher=[[USENIX]]|volume=Proceedings of the 1998 LISA Conference|work=Jonathan Abbey and Michael Mulvaney|accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganymede has been under public development and use since then.

Ganymede uses a central server which supports clients connecting via [[Java remote method invocation|Java RMI]].  The Ganymede server maintains a transactional object graph database of network information such as user objects, group objects, system objects, network objects, etc.  Users and administrators run Ganymede clients (GUI or [[XML]] based) to create, modify, or delete objects in the database.  Whenever a user commits a transaction, the Ganymede server schedules a number of background threads to write out updated network source files and run whatever system scripts are required to propagate the new data into the managed network directory services.  If multiple users are working concurrently, the scheduler makes sure that the entire network environment is updated with transactionally consistent directory images as builds finish and new ones are issued.

The Ganymede server is meant to be programmed by the adopter, who can define arbitrary object data types along with custom logic to interact with the user through the GUI and to maintain consistency within and between objects.  Adopters can also create custom tasks which can be executed at specified times by the internal Ganymede scheduler.  Such custom tasks can make changes in the server's object database and/or can run external scripts to update external services.

Ganymede has an elaborate XML data format which can be used to import and export the server's object database schema and object data.  Importing XML will typically result in the creation, modification, or deletion of database objects, and will trigger one or more network directory service rebuilds just as using the GUI client would do.

Above all, Ganymede is designed around administration teams.  Administrators are members of 'Owner Groups', which own objects.  Any object that is changed by a user or an automated task can result in change report email being sent to administrators in the appropriate Owner Group, making it possible for admins to keep up to date with changes that others in their groups are making.  Owner Groups can be granted authority over arbitrary subsets of the object database, making it easy to slice up the network directory space in any fashion that may be desired.

As a programmable framework, Ganymede must be programmed for a specific set of directory management tasks.  Fundamental Generic Networking in Germany has used it as the basis of their Doctor DNS project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fg-networking.de/index.php/spektrum/forschung-a-entwicklung/doctordns |title=DoctorDNS |accessdate=2013-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430170551/http://www.fg-networking.de/index.php/spektrum/forschung-a-entwicklung/doctordns |archivedate=2013-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is being used to manage DNS for the [[Kaiserslautern University of Technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://twit.tv/show/floss-weekly/143|date=24 November 2010|title=FLOSS Weekly #143: Ganymede|publisher=[[FLOSS Weekly]]|accessdate=2013-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dspace.icsy.de:12000/dspace/handle/123456789/185|title=Self-management in Heterogenous Networks Using A Service-Oriented Architecture|publisher=Proceedings of 2007 IEEE Consumer Communications and Networking Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerhard Dorn''' (c. 1530 &amp;ndash; 1584) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[philosopher]], [[translator]], [[alchemist]], [[physician]] and [[bibliophile]].

==Biography==
The details of Gerhard Dorn's early life, along with those of many other 16th century personalities, are lost to history.  It is known that he was born about 1530 in [[Mechelen]], which is part of modern-day Belgium's [[Antwerp (province)|Antwerp Province]]. He studied with [[Adam von Bodenstein]], to whom his first book is dedicated and began publishing books from around 1565.  He used [[John Dee (mathematician)|John Dee]]'s personal [[glyph]], the ''Monas Hieroglyphica'' on the title page of his ''Chymisticum artificium''.

Together with von Bodenstein, he rescued many of [[Paracelsus|Paracelsus's]] manuscripts and printed them for the first time. He also translated many of them into [[Latin language|Latin]] for the [[Basel]] publisher [[Pietro Perna]] and lived in Basel during the 1570s and [[Frankfurt]] in the early 1580s, where he died when he was in his mid-fifties.

==Philosophy==
Dorn claimed to have found a better philosophy and a more [[Christianity|Christian]] way of thinking in Paracelsus and was one of Paracelsus's strongest advocates. He depreciated practical laboratory work in favor of theoretical study of the human mind, considering the prevailing education of his day too scholastic. Like many [[Alchemy|alchemists]], Dorn was hostile to the philosophy of [[Aristotle]], with its emphasis upon the material world declaring that "whoever wishes to learn the alchemical art, let him not learn the philosophy of Aristotle but that which teaches the truth".

Dorn argued that learning needed a reform as had religion in the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], as had medicine in the teachings of Paracelsus. What was needed, he asserted, was a mystical and spiritual "philosophy of love"&amp;mdash;his radical theology claimed that it was God, not man who was in need of Redemption and he defined the alchemical opus as a labor which redeemed not man but God, a proposal which came perilously close to being heretical in the eyes of Christian orthodoxy. His principal writings are included in Volume I of the ''[[Theatrum Chemicum]]''.

As Monika Wikman summarized in her book ''Pregnant Darkness'', "Alchemists such as Gerhard Dorn, in his work 'The Speculative Philosophy,' referred to this next alchemical stage [inner healing] as ''[[Unus Mundus]]'', where splits are healed, duality ceases, and the individual, the ''vir unus'', unites with the world soul."&lt;ref&gt;Wikman, Monika. ''Pregnant Darkness''.  Berwick, Maine: Nicolas-Hays, Inc., 2004. Page 59 in trade paperback edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dorn's writings were of great interest to the psychologist [[Carl Jung]], enough for him to take Dorn's principal writings with him when traveling to [[India]] in 1928. He is one of Jung's most frequently quoted sources upon [[alchemy]].

Submissions are for works from the previous calendar year, with at most one submission per category per media organization.  Submissions are made in February by an editor of the media organization, and Awards are formally to the media organization with credit given to the individual author(s) of the work.&lt;ref name="2013submissions" /&gt;  Representatives and authors from the winning organizations have been invited to a luncheon and receive a plaque or certificate.  The media organization itself receives the award, which is an Upper Peninsula photograph or painting that combines light with evidence of peaceful human works.&lt;ref name="mining_journal" /&gt;  In 2012, forty-six media professionals were recognized from among twenty Upper Peninsula media organizations that submitted entries.&lt;ref name="2012awards_release"&gt;[http://www.dioceseofmarquette.org/UserFiles/Communications/GoodNewsAwards/GoodNewsAwardsWinners2012_5-31-12.pdf], Press release on 2012 awards. Retrieved Feb 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorship ==
Material receiving awards is expected to uphold values such as community, creativity, tolerance, justice, respect, compassion, perseverance, truth, faith, care for the environment or the dedication to excellence.  The awards have been sponsored annually by the religious leaders of the [[Evangelical Lutheran]], [[PC(USA)|Presbyterian]], [[United Methodist]], [[Catholic]] and [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] Churches in the Upper Peninsula region.  Although the sponsors have been religious organizations, the award criteria do not involve religious content and topics of award-winning material are generally secular.&lt;ref name="dailypress" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ironcounty_reporter"&gt;"Reporter receives certificate of merit..."

'''John Trudell''' (February 15, 1946 – December 8, 2015) was a Native American author, poet, actor, musician, and political activist. He was the spokesperson for the United [[Occupation of Alcatraz|Indians of All Tribes]]' [[Occupation of Alcatraz|takeover of Alcatraz]] beginning in 1969, broadcasting as ''Radio Free Alcatraz''.  During most of the 1970s, he served as the chairman of the [[American Indian Movement]], based in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]].

After his pregnant wife, three children and mother-in-law were killed in 1979 in a suspicious fire at the home of his parents-in-law on the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes [[Duck Valley Indian Reservation]] in [[Nevada]], Trudell turned to writing, music and film as a second career. He acted in films in the 1990s.  The [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Trudell]]'' (2005) was made about him and his life as an activist and artist.

== Early life and education ==
Trudell was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] on February 15, 1946, as the son of a [[Santee Dakota]] father and a Mexican mother. He grew up in small towns near the [[Santee Sioux Reservation]] in northern Nebraska near the southeast corner of [[South Dakota]]. He was educated in local schools and also in Santee Dakota culture.

==Military service==
In 1963 when 17 years old, Trudell dropped out of high school and left the Midwest by joining the [[US Navy]].  He served during the early years of the [[Vietnam War]] and stayed in the Navy until 1967.

Afterward, he attended [[San Bernardino Valley College]], a two-year community college in [[San Bernardino]], [[California]], studying radio and broadcasting. He decided to work through political activism.

==Political activism==
After leaving the military, Trudell had become involved in Indian activism.  In 1969, he became the spokesperson for the United Indians of All Tribes' occupation of [[Alcatraz Island]].  This was a mostly student-member group that had developed in San Francisco. Trudell went to Alcatraz a week after the occupation started. He used his background in broadcasting and ran a radio station from the island through a cooperative arrangement with students at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], broadcasting at night over the Berkeley [[FM broadcasting|FM]] station. The show was called ''Radio Free Alcatraz''. He discussed the cause of the occupation and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] issues, and played traditional Native American music. He criticized how "the system today is only geared toward white needs."{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} He spoke for the many Indians who believed they did not fit in with the then majority European-American population of the nation. He became a spokesperson for the occupation specifically and for the Alcatraz-[[Red Power Movement]] generally, as the author [[Vine Deloria, Jr.]] named it. Trudell was the spokesman for the nearly two-year-long occupation, until 1971.

After the failure of the federal government to meet demands of the protesters at Alcatraz, Trudell joined the [[American Indian Movement]]. It had been established in 1968 in [[Minneapolis]] among urban American Indians, first to deal with police harassment and injustice in the law enforcement system. Trudell acted as its national chairman from 1973 until 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://johntrudell.com/bio.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014150205/http://johntrudell.com/bio.html |archivedate=2013-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfamr.org/doc/trudell.html|title=Testimony of John Trudell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the position after the first chairman, [[Carter Camp]], was convicted for actions related to a protest and was sentenced to jail.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Journal-World, June 7, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975 Trudell was arrested on charges of assault, felonious assault and assault with a deadly weapon.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} He had gone to a reservation trading post to try to get better food for senior residents.  He tried to pay using [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|food stamps]], but the trading post did not accept them. The police report said that he fired a shot inside the store.

On February 12, 1979, Trudell's wife [[Tina Manning]] and their three children, and his mother-in-law Leah Hicks-Manning died in a suspicious fire at the home of his parents-in-law on the [[Duck Valley Indian Reservation]] in [[Nevada]]. His father-in-law Arthur Manning survived. He was a member of the [[Duckwater Shoshone Tribe]]'s [[Tribal Council]] who was working for treaty rights. Opponents included the local tribal police chief and the BIA superintendent, John Artichoker. Leah coordinated social services at the reservation. Tina had been working for tribal water rights at the [[Wildhorse Reservoir]]. Opponents of her campaign included officials of the local BIA, Elko County and Nevada state officials, members of the water recreation industry, and local European-American ranchers.&lt;ref name="trudell"&gt;[http://www.dickshovel.com/JTT.html "Concerning John Trudell..."], Dick Shovel Website, n.d., accessed July 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other activists have also speculated whether there was government involvement behind the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward. 1992. Death Squads in the United States: Confessions of a Government Terrorist;3 Yale J.L. &amp; Lib. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Trudell believed that the fire was arson, but the BIA police investigation claimed that it was accidental. It occurred soon after he had been leading a demonstration in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;Messerschmidt, James W., The Trial of Leonard Peltier, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Trudell believed that the fire was meant to threaten and silence him and his activist wife.&lt;ref name="trudell"/&gt; In numerous interviews, he has expressed distrust for the [[federal government]] and specifically the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;Portland Oregon Public Access interview, September 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The FBI has been implicated in wrongdoing in Pine Ridge and other reservations during this period, which included offering monetary support to the Dickie Wilson's Guardians of the Ogallala Nation (GOONS).  Essentially the GOONS, paid by Dickie Wilson (who in turn was paid by the FBI) the then Band Council Chief (elected in what many believe was a rigged election) terrorized and murdered traditional Sioux people who spoke out against federal government treatment of American Indian people.  The house fire that killed Trudell's family happened within 24 hours of him burning a US flag on the steps of the FBI building in Washington D.C. in protest of the government's treatment of Native Americans and the Sioux Nation.

John Trudell was the co-founder of Hempstead Project Heart with [[Willie Nelson]], which became a project of [[Earth Island Institute]] in 2012. Hempstead Project Heart is dedicated to raising awareness about the environmental, social, and economic benefits of legalizing [[industrial hemp]] in America.

Trudell was also involved with Seva Foundation and their Native American programs. He performed at numerous benefit concerts in support of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.seva.org/site/DocServer/Seva_GOS_2006.pdf Seva pamphlet (pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jambase.com/article/seva-foundation-benefit-steve-earle-john-trudell-p-rowan Trudell in concert for SEVA]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political controversy ===
In 2004, Trudell testified in the federal trial of [[Arlo Looking Cloud]], an [[Oglala Lakota]] [[American Indian Movement]] (AIM) member charged in the kidnapping and murder of [[Anna Mae Aquash]], the highest-ranking woman in AIM, in December 1975. Trudell testified that Looking Cloud had told him that John Graham, another low-level AIM member, was the gunman in the murder.  Trudell identified Graham from photographs. Looking Cloud was convicted in 2004 and sentenced to life imprisonment.

His testimony was part of the evidence considered by the Canadian judge who ordered Graham's extradition to the United States in February 2005. On March 2, 2005, the Native Youth Movement Vancouver announced a boycott of John Trudell's music and poetry in retaliation for his testimony, and alleged that the FBI had killed Aquash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ourfreedom.wordpress.com/2007/06/07/nym-vancouver-announces-boycott-of-john-trudell/ "NYM Vancouver announces boycott of John Trudell"], Our Freedom Blog, June 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2006, Michael Donnelly explored the issues related to the Aquash murder in the American political newsletter ''[[CounterPunch]].'' He documented why Trudell's testimony should be considered substantive and that activists were getting on the wrong side of the issue by attacking him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2006/01/17/killing-anna-mae-aquash-smearing-john-trudell/ MICHAEL DONNELLY, "Getting Away with Murder: Killing Anna Mae Aquash, Smearing John Trudell"], ''Counterpunch'', January 17, 2006, accessed March 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Graham was convicted in a South Dakota state court of felony murder of Aquash and sentenced to life imprisonment.

==Personal life==
In 1968, Trudell married his first wife, Fenicia "Lou" Ordonez.

In 1972, Trudell married Tina Manning, an activist of the Duckwater Shoshone Tribe. They had three children together: Ricarda Star, Sunshine Karma, and Eli Changing Sun.  In February 1979, Tina (who was pregnant), the children and her mother Leah Hicks-Manning were all killed in a fire at her parents' house on the Duck Valley Reservation.  Her father Arthur survived. Trudell was out of town.&lt;ref name="trudell"/&gt;

Trudell was in a relationship with [[Marcheline Bertrand]], the mother of actress [[Angelina Jolie]], at the time of her death from cancer in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2007/12/01/john-trudell-and-the-music-of-urgency/|title=John Trudell and the Music of Urgency|date=1 December 2007|work=www.counterpunch.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/angelina-jolies-mother-marcheline-bertrand-taught-daughter-about-living-survival-f1C9911002|title=Angelina Jolie's mother Marcheline Bertrand taught daughter about living, survival|author=Randee Dawn|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early December 2015, it was announced that Trudell was in the last stages of terminal cancer.&lt;ref name=retraction&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levi|first1=Rickert|title=Story Retraction About John Trudell|url=http://nativenewsonline.net/currents/story-retraction-about-john-trudell/|website=Native News Online|publisher=Native News Online|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death was prematurely announced on the evening of December 4, 2015; his publicist asked for a retraction and the stories were largely removed from the websites where they had been posted.&lt;ref name=retraction/&gt; Trudell died on December 8, 2015.&lt;ref name=Activist&gt;{{cite news |url= http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/american-indian-activist-poet-john-trudell-dies-69-35658485 |title= American Indian Activist, Poet John Trudell Dies at 69 |first=Robert |last= Jablon |publisher= [[Associated Press]] |via= [[ABC News]] |date= December 8, 2015 |accessdate= December 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Trudell obit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weber|first1=Bruce|title=John Trudell, Outspoken Advocate for American Indians, Is Dead at 69|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/10/us/john-trudell-outspoken-advocate-for-american-indians-is-dead-at-69.html|accessdate=10 December 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=Dec 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before dying, he said: "My ride showed up. Celebrate Love. Celebrate Life."{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Musical career==
In 1979, John Trudell met musical artist and activist [[Jackson Browne]] and became more interested in the musical world (and recording albums and performing his own compositions in live venues).

Trudell recorded an album ''A.K.A Grafitti Man'' ("graffiti" was misspelled in the title) with [[Kiowa]] guitarist [[Jesse Ed Davis]] that was originally available on cassette tape format only. This comports with the practice common to American indigenous and other so-called minorities of distributing music [[mixtape]]s captured live at group events and copied and distributed through non-commercial channels, like those of the San Francisco-based rock group [[Grateful Dead]], Native American powwow music performances in general, and African American gatherings whence came the expression [[Each One Teach One]], common also to an emerging [[grassroots movement]] that was arguably itself a ''response'' to the [[reactionary]] madness of [[slavery]] and/or military-industrial/[[imperialism|imperialist]] [[hegemony]] flourishing in the 1980s.

In 1990 John Trudell took part in [[Tony Hymas]]'s ''Oyaté'' project.

In 1992 Trudell remade and re-released ''A.K.A Grafitti Man'' as an audio CD to substantial critical and popular acclaim.

Arguably his greatest musical success came with the 1994 album ''Johnny Damas &amp; Me'' that was described as "a culmination of years of poetic work, and an example of a process of fusing traditional sounds, values, and sensibilities with thought-provoking lyrics, this time with urgent rock and roll."&lt;ref name="Ullestad"&gt;Neal Ullestad. 2008. American Indian rap and reggae: Dancing "to the beat of a different Drummer." Popular Music and Society Vol. 23, Iss. 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Other musical releases (many with his band '''Bad Dog''') include ''A.K.A Grafitti Man'' (1986), ''Heart Jump Bouquet'' (1987), ''Blue Indians'' (1999), ''Descendant Now Ancestor'' (2001), ''Bone Days'' (2001), ''Live A Fip'' (2003), ''Madness and The Moremes'' (2007), ''Crazier Than Hell'' (2010), ''Wazi's Dream'' (2015).

Popular Music critic Neal Ullestad said of Trudell's live performances, "This isn't simply pop rock with Indian drums and chants added. It's integrated rock and roll by an American Indian with a multicultural band directed to anyone who will listen."&lt;ref name="Ullestad"/&gt;

The closing sequence of [[Alanis Obomsawin]]'s 2014 documentary film ''[[Trick or Treaty?]]'' is set to Trudell's song "Crazy Horse."&lt;ref name="Mintzer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/trick-treaty-toronto-review-730328|title='Trick or Treaty?': Toronto Review|last=Mintzer|first=Jordan|date=September 4, 2014|work=Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=September 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing career ==
About six months after the deaths of his family, John Trudell started writing poetry. He described his work, "They're called poems, but in reality they're lines given to me to hang on to."&lt;ref name="Film"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/trudell/film.html  | title=''Trudell'' (2005) | publisher=[[PBS]] | work=[[Independent Lens]] | accessdate=November 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has written many poems, including "Baby Boom Che" and "Rant and Roll," and hundreds of others.

In the 2010s he often shared recent poetic musings and written works-in-progress via social media, such as his Facebook page.

Various impromptu videos of Trudell in live concert appearances or addressing political, social, indigenous rights and educational groups are posted on Google's Youtube.com, and although he was sought after by various print and broadcast media outlets for "sound byte commentary," Trudell preferred to speak in less frenetic style directly to gatherings assembled for specific causes that he supports (e.g., advocating on behalf of re-legalizing hemp cultivation for its many beneficial uses, including sustainable paper pulp).

Trudell often used his poetry as lyrics for recordings, and began in 1982 to set them to traditional American Indian music, which also in the 1980s eventually led to the recording of ''A.K.A Graffiti Man'', as he struggled to make sense of bewildering situations that confronted him, including the loss of so many loved ones.

In late 1988, Australian rock band [[Midnight Oil]] invited Trudell (as Graffiti Man) to tour with them during their ''From Diesel and Dust to the Big Mountain'' world tour. They billed Trudell's part of the show as "Native American activist performance." Members of Midnight Oil played traditional instruments, sang in native American languages, and accompanied songs with heavy [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] [[Jimmy Hendrix|Hendrix]]-style guitar, accompanying Trudell. This exposure brought Trudell new and larger audiences.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Trudell also toured in 1993 with [[Peter Gabriel]]'s global [[WOMAD]] (World Music and Dance) production. He was billed as John Trudell, performing his traditional songs and reading his poetry.

In 2008, Trudell published a book, ''Lines From a Mined Mind: The Words of John Trudell,'' a collection of 25 years of poetry, lyrics and essays.

== Film career ==
Trudell created a career as an actor, performing in roles in "[[Pow Wow Highway]]" (1989), ''[[Thunderheart]]'' (1992), ''[[On Deadly Ground]]'' (1995) and ''[[Smoke Signals (film)|Smoke Signals]]'' (1998) (as the Radio speaker Randy Peone on K-REZ radio&lt;ref&gt;Joanna Hearne. 2005. John Wayne's Teeth: Speech, Sound and Representation in "Smoke Signals" and "Imagining Indians" . ''[[Western Folklore]]'', Vol. 64, No. 3/4, Film and Folklore, pp. 189-208&lt;/ref&gt;).  He was an adviser to the production of ''[[Incident at Oglala]]'', directed by [[Michael Apted]] and produced by [[Robert Redford]]. A kind of companion piece to the fictional ''Thunderheart'', the 1992 documentary explores facts related to the 1975 shooting of two FBI agents at the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]], for which [[Leonard Peltier]] was convicted in 1977. In ''[[Thunderheart]]'', Trudell played a character who resembles Peltier.

Dreamkeeper  (2003) "The Legends of American Nations Come to Life" features several traditional native stories.
Trudell played a character named Coyote in a story about A Spider and Coyote.

The filmmaker [[Heather Rae]] spent more than a decade making a [[documentary]] about Trudell, which was released in 2005.  Her intent in ''[[Trudell]]'' (2005) was to demonstrate how his political and cultural activities were tied to contemporary history and inspired people.  The film premiered at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]] in the U.S. documentary competition.  The movie has received a mixed response among film critics and viewers.  Some claimed it to be thought-provoking and touching, while others suggested Rae made a one-dimensional [[biopic]].{{citation needed|date=July 2011}}  The song used at the end of the film is "Johnny Lobo" about Trudell by [[Kris Kristofferson]], from his 1995 album ''[[A Moment of Forever]]''.&lt;ref name="Native Blog"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nativeblog.typepad.com/the_potawatomitracks_blog/2006/06/about_the_film_.html|title=About the Film 'Trudell-The Movie'|last=Mitchell|first=Larry|date=June 13, 2006|work=The Native Blog|accessdate=September 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://axisoflogic.com/artman/publish/Article_64462.shtml|title=Johnny Lobo.

'''''[[De rerum natura]]''''' (usually translated as ''On the Nature of Things'') is a philosophical epic poem written by [[Lucretius]] in Latin around 55 BCE. The poem was lost during the Middle Ages, rediscovered in 1417, and first printed in 1473. Its earliest published translation into any language (French) did not occur until 1650; in English — although earlier partial or unpublished translations exist — the first complete translation to be published was that of [[Thomas Creech]], in [[heroic couplet]]s, in 1682. Only a few more English translations appeared over the next two centuries, but in the 20th century translations began appearing more frequently.

Only complete (or nearly complete) translations are listed. Notable translations of individual passages include the "invocation to Venus" by [[Edmund Spenser]] in ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' IV.X.44-47; and five passages in [[John Dryden]]'s ''Sylvae'' (1685).

{{Buddhism}}

'''Luminous mind''' ([[Sanskrit|Skt:]] ''prabhāsvara-citta'' or ''ābhāsvara-citta,'' [[Pali]]: ''pabhassara citta;'' [[Tibetic languages|T.]] ''’od gsal gyi sems;'' [[Chinese language|C.]] ''guangmingxin;'' [[Japanese language|J.]] ''kōmyōshin;'' [[Korean language|K.]] ''kwangmyŏngsim'') is a Buddhist term which appears in a [[Suttas|sutta]] of the [[Pali]] [[Anguttara Nikaya]] as well as numerous [[Mahayana sutras|Mahayana]] texts and [[Buddhist Tantras|Buddhist tantras]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Buswell Jr., Donald S. Lopez Jr., The Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism, p. 653.&lt;/ref&gt; It is variously translated as "brightly shining mind", or "mind of clear light" while the related term '''luminosity''' (Skt. ''prabhāsvaratā;'' Tib.''’od gsal ba;'' Ch. ''guāng míng;'' Jpn. ''kōmyō;'' Kor. ''kwangmyōng'') is also translated as "clear light" in Tibetan Buddhist contexts or, "purity" in East Asian contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Casey Alexandra Kemp, Luminosity, Oxford Bibliographies, LAST MODIFIED: 26 MAY 2016 DOI: 10.1093/OBO/9780195393521-0219&lt;/ref&gt; The term is usually used to describe the mind or consciousness in different ways. 

This term is given no direct doctrinal explanation in the Pali discourses, but later Buddhist schools explained it using various concepts developed by them.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Theravada]] school identifies the "luminous mind" with the ''[[bhavanga]]'', a concept first proposed in the Theravada [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Collins, page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; The later schools of the [[Mahayana]] identify it with both the Mahayana concepts of ''[[bodhicitta]]'' and ''[[tathagatagarbha]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; The notion is of central importance in the philosophy and practice of [[Dzogchen]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Contemplative Science, Columbia, 2007, pages 94-96.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Luminosity in Early Buddhist Texts ==

In the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] there are various mentions of luminosity or radiance which refer to the development of the mind in [[Buddhist meditation|meditation]]. In the ''Saṅgīti-sutta'' for example, it relates to the attainment of [[samadhi]], where the perception of light (''āloka sañña'') leads to a mind endowed with luminescence (''sappabhāsa'').&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Analayo, the ''Upakkilesa-sutta'' and its parallels mention that the presence of defilements "results in a loss of whatever inner light or luminescence (obhāsa) had been experienced during meditation".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Pali ''Dhātuvibhaṅga-sutta'' uses the metaphor of refining gold to describe equanimity reached through meditation, which is said to be "pure, bright, soft, workable, and luminous".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chinese parallel to this text however does not describe equanimity as luminous.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Analayo sees this difference due to the propensity of the reciters of the Theravada canon to prefer fire and light imagery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;

The Pali [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (A.I.8-10) states:&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 94. The reference is at A I, 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;"Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements. The well-instructed disciple of the noble ones discerns that as it actually is present, which is why I tell you that — for the well-instructed disciple of the noble ones — there is development of the mind."&lt;ref&gt;Translated by Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;A parallel passage can be found in the [[Śāriputrābhidharma|''Śāriputrābhidharma'']], an [[Abhidharma]] treatise possibly of the Dharmaguptaka tradition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Another mention of a similar term in the Pali discourses occurs in the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' of the [[Majjhima Nikaya|Majjhima-nikāya]] and in the ''Kevaḍḍha-sutta'' of the ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha-nikāya]],'' the latter has a parallel in a [[Dharmaguptaka]] collection surviving in Chinese translation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Anālayo, The Luminous Mind in Theravāda and Dharmaguptaka Discourses, Journal for the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies 2017 (13): 10-51.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' describes an “invisible consciousness” (viññāṇaṃ anidassanaṃ) that is "infinite” (anantaṃ), and “luminous in every way” (sabbato pabhaṃ). However, there is disagreement among the various [[Pāli Canon|Pali Canon]] editions as to whom the statement is spoken by, and in some editions it seems as if it is spoken not by the Buddha but by the deva Baka Brahma in a debate with the Buddha.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Chinese parallel to the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' has the term used by Baka Brahma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;

The ''Kevaḍḍha-sutta'' &amp;nbsp;and its parallel in the [[Dharmaguptaka]] Dīrgha-āgama meanwhile, does have a statement spoken by the Buddha which mentions luminous consciousness. The [[Āgama (Buddhism)|Dīrgha-āgama]] sutra states:&lt;blockquote&gt;Consciousness that is invisible, Infinite, and luminous of its own: This ceasing, the four elements cease, Coarse and subtle, pretty and ugly cease. Herein name-and-form cease. Consciousness ceasing, the remainder [i.e. name-and-form] also ceases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;However, [[Bhikkhu Analayo|Analayo]] mentions that parallel recensions of this sutra in other languages like Sanskrit and Tibetan do not mention luminosity (''pabhaṃ'') and even the various Pali editions do not agree that this verse mentions luminosity, sometimes using ''pahaṃ'' ( "given up") instead of ''pabhaṃ''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Whatever the case, according to Analayo, the passage refers to "the cessation mode of dependent arising, according to which name-and-form cease with the cessation of consciousness".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Bhikkhu Brahmāli, the references to luminosity in the ''Brahmanimantaṇika-sutta'' refers to states of [[samadhi]] known only to [[Four stages of enlightenment|ariyas (noble ones)]], while the ''pabhassaracitta'' of [[Anguttara Nikaya]] (A.I.8-10) is a reference to the mind in [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Bhikkhu Brahmali, What the Nikāyas Say and Do not Say about Nibbāna, Buddhist Studies Review.&lt;/ref&gt; He cites a common passage which notes that the mind with the five hindrances is not considered radiant and thus it makes sense to say that a mind in jhana, which does not have the five hindrances, can be said to be radiant:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So too, bhikkhus, there are these five corruptions of the mind (''cittassa''), corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant (''pabhassaraṃ'') but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. What five? Sensual desire ... ill will ... sloth and torpor ... restlessness and remorse ... doubt is a corruption of the mind, corrupted by which the mind is neither malleable nor wieldy nor radiant but brittle and not rightly concentrated for the destruction of the taints. (SN V 92 and A III 16, cf. AN I 257 and MN III 243).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Theravada ==
{{Main|Bhavanga}}

The [[Theravada|Theravadin]] Anguttara Nikaya [[Atthakatha]] commentary identifies the luminous mind as the ''[[bhavanga]]'', the "ground of becoming" or "latent dynamic continuum", which is the most fundamental level of mental functioning in the Theravada [[Abhidhamma|Abhidhammic]] scheme.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation is also used by [[Buddhaghoṣa|Buddhaghosa]], in his commentary on the [[Dhammasangani]]. Buddhaghosa also mentions that the mind is made luminous by the fourth jhana in his [[Visuddhimagga]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;'''Skorupski, Tadeusz. “Consciousness and Luminosity in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism.” In''' ''Buddhist Philosophy and Meditation Practice: Academic Papers Presented at the 2nd IABU Conference Mahachulalongkornrajavidyalaya University, Main Campus Wang Noi, Ayutthaya, Thailand, 31 May–2 June 2012'''''.''' &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] holds that the commentaries' identification of the luminous mind with the ''bhavanga'' is problematic,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html Pabhassara Sutta: Luminous] Note #1.&lt;/ref&gt; but Peter Harvey finds it to be a plausible interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 98-99. See also pages 155-179 of Harvey2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ajahn Mun]], the leading figure behind the modern [[Thai Forest Tradition]], comments on this verse:

{{quote|The mind is something more radiant than anything else can be, but because counterfeits – passing defilements – come and obscure it, it loses its radiance, like the sun when obscured by clouds. Don’t go thinking that the sun goes after the clouds. Instead, the clouds come drifting along and obscure the sun. So meditators, when they know in this manner, should do away with these counterfeits by analyzing them shrewdly... When they develop the mind to the stage of the primal mind, this will mean that all counterfeits are destroyed, or rather, counterfeit things won’t be able to reach into the primal mind, because the bridge making the connection will have been destroyed. Even though the mind may then still have to come into contact with the preoccupations of the world, its contact will be like that of a bead of water rolling over a lotus leaf.&lt;ref&gt;Ven. Ajahn Mun, ‘A Heart Released,’ p 23. Found in Ajahn Pasanno and Ajahn Amaro, ''The Island: An Anthology of the Buddha’s Teachings on Nibbāna'', pages 212-213. Available online at [http://www.abhayagiri.org/main/book/1788/].&lt;/ref&gt;}}[[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] sees the luminous mind as "the mind that the meditator is trying to develop. To perceive its luminosity means understanding that defilements such as greed, aversion, or delusion are not intrinsic to its nature, are not a necessary part of awareness." He associates the term with the simile used to describe the fourth [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhana]] which states:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Just as if a man were sitting covered from head to foot with a white cloth so that there would be no part of his body to which the white cloth did not extend; even so, the monk sits, permeating the body with a pure, bright awareness. There is nothing of his entire body unpervaded by pure, bright awareness."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other Buddhist schools ==
According to Tadeusz Skorupski, the [[Mahāsāṃghika|Mahasamghika]] school held that the mind’s nature (''cittasvabhva'') is fundamentally pure (''mulavisuddha''), but it can be contaminated by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In contrast, the [[Sarvastivada]] [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasikas]] held that the mind was not naturally luminous. According to Skorupski for the [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhasikas]], the mind:&lt;blockquote&gt;is initially or originally contaminated by defilements, and must be purified by abandoning defilements. For them a primordially luminous mind cannot be contaminated by adventitious defilements. If such a mind were contaminated by adventitious defilements, then these naturally impure defilements would become pure once they become associated with the naturally luminous mind. On the other hand, if adventitious defilements remained to be impure, then a naturally luminous mind would not become defiled by their presence. For them the constantly evolving mind is in possession of defilements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In Mahayana Buddhism ==
{{Main|Mahayana}}In [[Sanskrit]] Mahayana texts and their translations, the term is a compound of the intensifying prefix ''pra-'', the verbal root ''bhāsa'' (Tibetan:  '''od'') which means light, radiance or luminosity and the modifier ''vara'' (Tibetan: ''gsal ba'') which means 'clear,' and also 'the best of, the highest type.'&lt;ref&gt;Tony Duff, ''The Illuminator'' Tibetan Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffrey Hopkins' Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionary glosses the term compound as:&lt;blockquote&gt;clear light; clearly luminous; transparently luminous; translucent; brightly shining; transparent lucidity; splendor; radiance; illumination; spread the light; lustre; come to hear; effulgence; brilliance.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Hopkins, Tibetan-Sanskrit-English Dictionary Digital version: Digital Archives Section, Library and Information Center of Dharma Drum Buddhist College 法鼓佛教學院 圖書資訊館 數位典藏組&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Mahayana texts ===
[[Mahayana sutras]] generally affirm the pure and luminous nature of the mind, adding that this is its natural condition (''prakrti-prabhsvara-citta'').&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In the ''Pañcavimsati [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñaparamita]] sutra'', the ''prabhsvara-citta'' is interpreted thus'':''&lt;blockquote&gt;This mind (citta) is no-mind (acitta), because its natural character is luminous. What is this state of the mind’s luminosity (prabhsvarat)? When the mind is neither associated with nor dissociated from greed, hatred, delusion, proclivities (anusaya), fetters (samyojana), or false views (drsti), then this constitutes its luminosity. Does the mind exist as no-mind? In the state of no-mind (acittat), the states of existence (astit) or non-existence (nstit) can be neither found nor established... What is this state of no-mind? The state of no-mind, which is immutable (avikra) and undifferentiated (avikalpa), constitutes the ultimate reality (dharmat) of all dharmas. Such is the state of no-mind.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A similar teaching appears in some recensions of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'' (8000 lines) ''Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra.'' [[Edward Conze]] considered the teaching on the "essential purity of the nature of mind"  (''prakrti cittasya prabhasvara''; ''xinxiang benjing'', 心相本淨) to be a central teaching of the Mahayana. However according to Shi Huifeng, this term is not present in the earliest textual witness of the ''Aṣṭasāhasrikā'', the ''Daoxing Banruo Jing'', attributed to [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokaksema]] (c. 179 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Huifeng Shi, An Annotated English Translation of Kumārajīva’s Xiaŏpĭn Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra, Asian Literature and Translation Vol. 4, No 1, 2017, 187-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahayana texts like the [[Ratnagotravibhāga|Ratnagotravibhanga]], also associate ''prabhsvara'' with awakening (''bodhi'') and also another term, natural or original purity of mind (''cittaprakrtivisuddhi'').&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Busswell, 2004, Encyclopedia of Buddhism, page 52.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul, Altruism and Reality: Studies in the Philosophy of the Bodhicaryavatara, page 10&lt;/ref&gt; In some Mahayana shastras, natural purity is another term for [[Śūnyatā|Emptiness]], Suchness and [[Dharmadhatu]].&lt;ref&gt;Brunnholz, Karl, When the Clouds Part: The Uttaratantra and Its Meditative Tradition as a Bridge between Sutra and Tantra, Shambhala, 2015, page 1023.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asanga|Asanga's]] [[Mahāyānasaṃgraha|Mahayanasamgraha]] for example, states:&lt;blockquote&gt;The essential purity (''prakṛtivyavadāna''), i.e., the true nature (''tathatā''), emptiness (''śūnyatā''), the utmost point of reality (''bhūtakoti''), the signless (''animitta''), the absolute (''paramārtha''), the fundamental element (''dharmadhātu'').&lt;ref&gt;Lamotte, Étienne , MAHĀYĀNASAṂGRAHA (La Somme du Grand Véhicule d'Asaṅga), Volume II,  page 165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The ''Bhadrapala-sutra'' states that the element of consciousness (''vijñanadhatu'') is pure and penetrates all things while not being affected by them, like the rays of the sun, even though it may appear defiled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Alaya-vijñana ===
According to [[Walpola Rahula]], all the elements of the [[Yogacara]] [[store-consciousness]] (''alaya-vijnana'') are already found in the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the three layers of the mind (''citta'', called "luminous" in the passage discussed above, ''manas'', and ''vijnana'') as presented by Asanga are also used in the Pali Canon.&lt;ref&gt;Walpola Rahula, quoted in Padmasiri De Silva, Robert Henry Thouless, ''Buddhist and Freudian Psychology.'' Third revised edition published by NUS Press, 1992 page 66, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4Fb0q9bKJjIC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=development+of+the+theory+of+karma+buddhism&amp;lr=#PPA66,M1].&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to [[Yogacara]] teachings, as in early Buddhist teachings regarding the ''citta'', the store-consciousness is ''not'' pure, and with the attainment of nirvana comes a level of mental purity that is hitherto unattained.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus, ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, 2002, note 7 on page 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Svasaṃvedana===
{{main|Svasaṃvedana}}
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], the luminous mind (Tibetan: ''gsal ba'') is often equated with the Yogacara concept of [[svasaṃvedana]] (''reflexive awareness''). It is often compared to a lamp in a dark room, which in the act of illuminating objects in the room also illuminates itself.

=== Tathagatagarbha ===
{{Main|Tathagatagarbha}}
In the canonical discourses, when the brightly shining ''citta'' is "unstained," it is supremely poised for ''arahantship'', and so could be conceived as the "womb" of the ''arahant'', for which a synonym is ''[[tathagata]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 96.&lt;/ref&gt; The discourses do not support seeing the "luminous mind" as "nirvana within" which exists prior to liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 94, 96.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Canon does not support the identification of the "luminous mind" in its raw state with [[Nirvana#Luminous consciousness|nirvanic consciousness]], passages could be taken to imply that it can be transformed into the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97. He finds the reference at S III, 54, taking into account statements at S II, 13, S II, 4, and S III, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thanissaro Bhikkhu, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an01/an01.049.than.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the destruction of the fetters, according to one scholar, "the shining nibbanic consciousness flashes out of the womb of arahantship, being without object or support, so transcending all limitations."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the [[Shurangama Sutra]] and the [[Lankavatara Sutra]] describe the ''[[tathagatagarbha]]'' ("arahant womb") &amp;nbsp;as "by nature brightly shining and pure," and "originally pure," though "enveloped in the garments of the [[skandhas]], [[dhatus]] and [[ayatana]]s and soiled with the dirt of attachment, hatred, delusion and false imagining." It is said to be "naturally pure," but it appears impure as it is stained by adventitious defilements.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, pages 96-97.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the Lankavatara Sutra identifies the luminous mind of the Canon with the tathagatagarbha.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[Gelug]] philosophers, in contrast to teachings in the Lankavatara Sutra, maintain that the "purity" of the ''tathagatagarbha'' is not because it is originally or fundamentally pure, but because mental flaws can be removed — that is, like anything else, they are not part of an individual's fundamental essence. These thinkers thus refuse to turn epistemological insight about [[emptiness]] and Buddha-nature into an essentialist metaphysics.&lt;ref&gt;Liberman, page 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shurangama Sutra and the Lankavatara Sutra also equate the ''tathagatagarbha'' (and ''[[alaya-vijnana]]'') with nirvana, though this is concerned with the actual attainment of nirvana as opposed to nirvana as a timeless phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henshall, page 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bodhicitta ==
The Mahayana interprets the brightly shining ''citta'' as ''[[bodhicitta]]'', the altruistic "spirit of awakening."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The Astasahasrika Perfection of Wisdom Sutra describes ''bodhicitta'' thus: "That citta is no citta since it is by nature brightly shining." This is in accord with Anguttara Nikaya I,10 which goes from a reference to brightly shining ''citta'' to saying that even the slightest development of [[Metta|loving-kindness]] is of great benefit. This implies that loving-kindness - and the related state of compassion - is inherent within the luminous mind as a basis for its further development.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, page 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The observation that the ground state of consciousness is of the nature of loving-kindness implies that empathy is innate to consciousness and exists prior to the emergence of all active mental processes.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, page 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vajrayana==
''Luminosity'' or ''clear light'' ([[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] '''od gsal'', [[Sanskrit]] ''prabhāsvara''), is central concept in [[Vajrayana|Esoteric Buddhism]], [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and [[Bon]]. It is the innate condition of the mind, associated with [[buddha-nature]], the realisation of which is the goal of meditative practice. It is said to be experienced when the coarse and subtle minds dissolve during deep [[sleep]], during orgasm, and during the [[death]] process.&lt;ref name="PrincetonAdibuddha"&gt;Buswell, Robert E.; Lopez, Jr., Donald S. (2013). ''The Princeton dictionary of Buddhism.'' Princeton: Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|9781400848058}}. Entry on "''prabhāsvara''".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deity, Mantra, and Wisdom|last1=Dharmachakra Translation Committee|date=2006|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-1-55939-300-3|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Deity, Mantra, and Wisdom|last1=Dharmachakra Translation Committee|date=2006|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|isbn=978-1-55939-300-3|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|pages=192}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; All systems of Tibetan Buddhism agree that the clear light nature of mind is non-conceptual and free from all mental afflictions, and that [[tantra]] is the superior method of working with this nature of the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Berzin, Making Sense of Tantra, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian tantric commentator Indrabhuti, in his ''Jñanasiddhi,'' states that &lt;blockquote&gt;Being luminous by nature, this mind is similar to the moon’s disc. The lunar disc epitomises the knowledge (''jñāna'') that is luminous by nature. Just as the waxing moon gradually emerges in its fullness, in the same way the mind-jewel (''cittaratna''), being naturally luminous, also fully emerges in its perfected state. Just as the moon becomes fully visible, once it is freed from the accidental obscurities, in the same way the mind-jewel, being pure by nature (''prakṛti-pariśuddha''), once separated from the stains of defilements (''kleśa''), appears as the perfected buddha-qualities (''guṇa'').&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Luminosity is also a specific term for one of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]] &lt;ref&gt;Tsongkhapa and Mullin, ''Six Yogas of Naropa,'' Snow Lion, 1996, pages 81-84.&lt;/ref&gt;. In his commentary, [[Pema Karpo]] says that the clear light is experienced briefly by all human beings at the very first moment of death, by advanced yogic practitioners in the highest states of meditation, and unceasingly by all Buddhas.&lt;ref&gt;http://explore.lib.virginia.edu/exhibits/show/dead/texts/artofdying&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[Vajrayana]] practices involve the recognition of this aspect of mind in different situations, such as [[dream yoga]]. In this case, the practitioner trains to lucidly enter the deep sleep state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponlop|first1=Dzogchen|title=Mind beyond death|date=2008|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=1-55939-301-7|pages=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one has the ability to remain lucid during deep sleep, one will be able to recognize the luminosity of death and gain [[Buddhahood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ponlop|first1=Dzogchen|title=Mind beyond death|date=2008|publisher=Snow Lion Publications|location=Ithaca, N.Y.|isbn=1-55939-301-7|pages=86–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is called the meeting of mother and child luminosities, resulting in the state of ''thukdam'' at death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Dudjom|title=Counsels from My Heart|date=2001|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston|isbn=1-57062-844-0|pages=59–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dzogchen===
In Tibetan Buddhist [[Dzogchen]] literature, luminosity ('''od gsal'') is associated with an aspect of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|Ground]] termed "spontaneous presence" (''Lhun grub''), meaning a presence that is uncreated and not based on anything causally extraneous to itself.&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 52&lt;/ref&gt; This term is often paired with 'original-purity' (''ka dag''), which is associated with emptiness ([[shunyata]]), and are both seen as inseparable aspects of the Ground. Other terms used to describe this aspect are dynamism or creative power (''rtsal'') and radiance (''dwangs'').&lt;ref&gt;Van Schaik; Approaching the Great Perfection: Simultaneous and Gradual Methods of Dzogchen Practice in the Longchen Nyingtig (Studies in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism), 2004, 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malek Bennabi''' (1905–1973) ({{lang-ar|مالك بن نبي}}) was an [[Algeria]]n writer and philosopher, who wrote about human society, particularly Muslim society with a focus on the reasons behind the fall of [[Muslim]] civilization. He is mostly known for the concept of ''coloniability'' which is the inner aptitude of some societies to be colonized (Black-African particularly). According to Malek Bennabi, the lack of new ideas in Islamic thought emerged what he coined ''civilizational bankruptcy''.&lt;ref name="african history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.routledge-ny.com/ref/africanhist/algeria.html | title=African History | accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that in order to recover its former magnificence, Islamic society had to become an environment in which individuals felt empowered. In order to satisfy his spiritual and material needs, a Muslim needed to feel that his industry and creativity would find reward.

== Education ==

Bennabi was born in [[Constantine, Algeria]] in 1905. Educated in Paris and [[Algiers]] in engineering, he later based himself in [[Cairo]], where he spent much of his time working extensively in the fields of history, philosophy and sociology. In 1963, after returning to [[Algeria]], he witnessed modern scientific inventions and technological creations unfold before his eyes. This spurred him to reflect on the question of culture in the early nineteenth century. His approach was simple, not parroting what had been discovered before his time, but rather, searching for what constitutes the essence of culture and the birth of civilization.

== Work ==

From one of his works, ''Les Conditions de la Renaissance'' (1948), he defined culture as the mode of being and becoming of a people. This included aesthetic, ethical, pragmatic, and technical values. When these contents had been clearly defined, only then could various formulations of ideas be born. The birth of new ideas led to a dynamic society furthering the movement of vibrancy of a new civilization. In another book, ''The Question of Culture'' (1954), he said, the organisation of society, its life and movement, indeed, its deterioration and stagnation, all possessed a functional relation with the system of ideas found in that society. If that system were to change in one way or another, all other social characteristics would follow suit and adapt in the same direction. Ideas, as a whole, form an important part of the means of development in a given society. The various stages of development in such a society are indeed different forms of its intellectual developments. If one of those stages corresponds to what is called "renaissance", it will mean that society at that stage is enjoying a wonderful system of ideas; a system that can provide a suitable solution to each of the vital problems in that particular society. He added that ideas influence the life of a given society in two different ways; either they are factors of growth of social life, or on the contrary, the role of factors of contagion, thus rendering social growth rather difficult or even impossible.

== Views ==
His primary focus was on the term he coined called 'Post-Almohad Men'. Modern society had left this man hollow due to a stultifying lack of aspiration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Killing Post-Almohad Man: Malek Bennabi, Algerian Islamism and the Search for a Liberal Governance by Sebastian J Walsh&lt;/ref&gt; 
He said that in the nineteenth century, the relations among nations were based on power for the position of a nation was dependent on the number of its factories, cannons, fleets and gold reserves. However, the twentieth century introduced a new development in which ideas were held in high esteem as national and international values. This development has not been strongly felt in many underdeveloped countries, for their inferiority complex created a warped infatuation with the criteria of power that was based on material things. Muslims living in an underdeveloped country often felt that they were inferior to people living in a developed country. As a result of this inferiority, Muslims ascribed this distance to the field of objects. They assessed their situation as an abomination caused by the lack of weapons, aeroplanes and banks. Thus, their inferiority complex, based on social efficacy, would lead only to pessimism on the psychological level. On the social level, it would lead to what we have elsewhere called ''takdis'' (heaping-up). To turn this feeling into an effective driving-force, Muslims needed to ascribe their backwardness to the level of ideas, not to that of "objects", for the development of the new world depended increasingly on ideas and other such intellectual criteria. In underdeveloped countries, which were still within the sphere of influence of the superpowers, arms and oil revenues were no longer sufficient to support that influence. The world had, therefore, entered a stage at which most of its problems could be solved only by certain systems of ideas. Therefore, the Arabs and other Muslim countries, especially those that did not possess a great deal of material power, should give more weight to the issue of [[idea]]s.&lt;ref name="grandestrategy"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.grandestrategy.com/2011/04/question-of-ideas-in-muslim-world.html | title=Malek Bennabi's Book ''A Question of Ideas in the Muslim World'' | accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

He later criticised the Muslim society for frequently falling into an [[apologetic]] state. Muslims tended to dig up past treasures instead of seeking to progress with new ones. He said that Muslims today were in a state of disarray. Muslim countries and societies were largely imperialized by the West. This was truly not a failure of Islam, but because Muslims and those in governance abandoned the true understanding of what Islamic values connoted. In this, Bennabi again pointed out, "after [[Egypt]]'s humiliation in the [[Six-days war]] in June 1967, it is the ''ummah'''s (global Muslim community) understanding and worldview, its stock of ideas rather than of arms and ammunition's, that needs to be renewed. Although looking back to what had been achieved in the Golden Age of Islam is still relevant, what is more important is to be able to appreciate the political values and culture of models and systems implemented by past prophets, re-interpret and apply these to our contemporary society. Enriching the society is part of dynamism in Islam. Colonisation of minds has driven Muslims towards a state of moral and psychological decay.&lt;ref&gt;Islam in History and Society by MalekBennabi&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that moral paralysis resulted in intellectual paralysis.

== A theory in social change ==
In his book, Bases of Civilization, Malek Bennabi put his theory of social change. He argues that we can split any given civilization into three basic elements: Man, soil (raw material) and time.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Bases of Civilization|last=Bennabi|first=Malek|publisher=DAR AL-FIKR|year=2000|isbn=|location=Damascus|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, then, becomes known as the civilization equation which he puts in this simple form: civilization = Man + soil + time.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Renaissance in any society, Bennabi argues, requires a synthesis between these three essential elements.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In studying many civilizations throughout the written history, Bennabi concludes that every civilization starts with a moral system which usually has its roots in some religious foundation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In the light of his theory, he explained how many social movements failed by missing the importance of moral reformation while focusing mainly and for most on the practical means.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An example he gave is the Algerian revolution in that thinkers and religious leaders switched their attention to the ballot boxes which they wrongly thought as if it works as a magic wand that heals all their ethical and thinking problems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Clarify|reason=This example needs more clarification for it to really make sense.|date=January 2018}}

==Life==
Michał Falkener was born in [[Silesia]] to a family of wealthy burghers. In Latin—the language favored by medieval European scholars, and used in his works—he is sometimes referred to as "''Vratislaviensis''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=0&amp;q=%2522Michael+Vratislaviensis%2522&amp;btnG=Search+Books|title = %22Michael Vratislaviensis%22 - Google Search|website = books.google.com|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''Wratislaviensis''" ("the Wrocławian") in addition to "''Michaelis de Vratislauia''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?as_brr=0&amp;q=%2522Michaelis+de+Vratislauia%2522&amp;btnG=Search+Books|title = %22Michaelis de Vratislauia%22 - Google Search|website = books.google.com|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("Michael of [[Wrocław]]"). In Polish he is, respectively, "''Wrocławczyk''" and "''Michał z Wrocławia''" ("Michael of Wrocław"). In German, the place identifier is "of ''Breslau''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?q=%2522Michael+of+Breslau%2522&amp;btnG=Search+Books|title = %22Michael of Breslau%22 - Google Search|website = books.google.com|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;—"''von Breslau''"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?q=%2522Michael+von+Breslau%2522&amp;btnG=Search+Books|title = %22Michael von Breslau%22 - Google Search|website = books.google.com|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "''aus Breslau''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://books.google.com/books?q=%2522Michael+aus+Breslau%2522&amp;as_brr=0|title = %22Michael aus Breslau%22 - Google Search|website = books.google.com|access-date = 2016-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falkener entered the arts faculty of the Kraków Academy in 1478, earning his bachelor's in 1481 and defending his master's thesis in 1488. Later he lectured there on [[astronomy]], [[astrology]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]], [[logic]], [[grammar]], and [[rhetoric]], as well as [[scholasticism|scholastic]] and [[Aristotle|Aristotlian philosophy]]. His students included [[Nicolaus Copernicus]]. In 1495 he entered the Collegium Minus, and in 1501 the Collegium Maius. In 1512 he joined the theological faculty, where he earned a doctorate in 1517. He twice (1499 and 1504) served as rector of the faculty of arts. For several years he headed the Bursa Niemiecka, succeeding [[John of Głogów]].

Falkener was a [[Thomist]] but an incomplete one since, in addition to Peripatetic-[[Thomist]] proofs for the existence of [[God]], he also accepted [[St. Anselm]]'s proofs.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In addition to more medieval pursuits, Falkener was interested in humanism: he knew and taught on classical and humanist authors, appreciating their linguistic and artistic abilities in particular. He published and edited important introductions to and commentaries on song collections and religious texts. Falkener's first printed astrological predictions were published for the years 1494–95; 1506 saw the first edition of his ''Introductorium astronomiae Cracoviensis elucidans almanach''.

He bequeathed his personal library to the Kraków Academy.

== Philosophy ==
The journal initially emerged in contraposition to the dominant analytical thought in British philosophy. It advocated an approach open to the arts, literature, and continental theory, with a strong political focus.

The journal presents a strong focus on non-European philosophy, political theory, and arts. Special issues have looked at contemporary cultural production in China, Pakistan, and Latin America.

{{pp-move-indef}} 

The '''occult''' (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden" or "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to [[fact]]s and "knowledge of the [[measurable]]", usually referred to as [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism,'' Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers.'' New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that [[Speculative reason|extends pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine.'' Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage College Thesaurus |year=2004 |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. 

The term ''occult sciences'' was used in the 16th century to refer to [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and natural [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. The term '''occultism''' emerged in 19th-century France, where it came to be associated with various French esoteric groups connected to [[Éliphas Lévi]] and [[Papus]], and in 1875 was introduced into the [[English language]] by the esotericist [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Throughout the 20th century, the term was used [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratically]] by a range of different authors, but by the 21st century was commonly employed – including by academic scholars of esotericism – to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. ''Occultism'' is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and [[New Age]].

Particularly since the late twentieth century, various authors have used '''the occult''' as a substantivized adjective. In this usage, "the occult" is a category into which varied beliefs and practices are placed if they are considered to fit into neither [[religion]] nor [[science]]. "The occult" in this sense is very broad, encompassing such phenomenon as beliefs in [[vampires]] or [[fairies]] and movements like [[Ufology]] and [[parapsychology]]. In that same period, ''occult'' and ''[[culture]]'' were combined to form the [[neologism]] '''occulture'''. Initially used in the [[industrial music]] scene, it was later given scholarly applications.

==Occult sciences==

The idea of "occult sciences" developed in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} The term usually encompassed three practices—[[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[natural magic]]—although sometimes various forms of divination were also included rather than being subsumed under natural magic.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} These were grouped together because, according to the historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], "each one of them engaged in systematic investigation of nature and natural processes, in the context of theoretical frameworks that relied heavily on a belief in occult qualities, virtues or forces."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}
Although there are areas of overlap between these different occult sciences, they are separate and in some cases practitioners of one would reject the others as being illegitimate.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

During the Enlightenment, the term "occult" increasingly came to be seen as intrinsically incompatible with the concept of "science".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} From that point on, use of the term "occult science(s)" implied a conscious polemic against mainstream science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

In his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', the anthropologist [[Edward Tylor]] used the term "occult science" as a synonym for "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraaff|first1=Wouter J.|title=Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism|date=2006|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004152311|page=716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occult qualities===
Occult qualities are properties that have no known rational explanation; in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, [[magnetism]] was considered an occult quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbLWJPca_zoC&amp;pg=PA185 Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S. Westfall], Margaret J. Osler, Paul Lawrence Farber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-52493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Occult Qualities and the Experimental Philosophy: Active Principles in Pre-Newtonian Matter Theory|first=John|last=Henry|date=1 December 1986|journal=History of Science|volume=24|issue=4|pages=335–381|doi=10.1177/007327538602400401}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aether (classical element)]] is another such element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=othGPNE56dMC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=occult+science+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=+aether&amp;f=false|title=Spirituality and the Occult: From the Renaissance to the Modern Age|first1=B. J.|last1=Gibbons|first2=Brian|last2=Gibbons|date=25 October 2018|publisher=Psychology Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780415244480}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton's contemporaries severely criticized his theory that gravity was effected through "action at a distance", as occult.&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Buchdahl, "History of Science and Criteria of Choice" p. 232. In ''Historical and Philosophical Perspectives of Science'' v. 5 (ed. Roger H. Stuewer)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occultism==

[[File:Eliphas Levi.jpg|thumb|right|The French esotericist Éliphas Lévi popularised the term "occultism" in the 1850s. His reinterpretation of traditional esoteric ideas has led to him being called the origin of "the occultist current properly so-called".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}]]

In the English-speaking world, prominent figures in the development of occultism included [[Helena Blavatsky]] and other figures associated with her [[Theosophical Society]], senior figures in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] like [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Samuel Liddell Mathers]], as well as other individuals such as [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], [[Emma Hardinge Britten]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and—in the early twentieth century—[[Aleister Crowley]], [[Dion Fortune]], and [[Israel Regardie]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}
By the end of the nineteenth century, occultist ideas had also spread into other parts of Europe, such as Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], and Italy.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1365–1366}}

Unlike older forms of esotericism, occultism does not reject "scientific progress or modernity".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=88|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=196}} Lévi had stressed the need to solve the conflict between science and religion, something that he believed could be achieved by turning to what he thought was the ancient wisdom found in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}
The scholar of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]] noted that rather than outright accepting "the triumph of scientism", occultists sought "an alternative solution", trying to integrate "scientific progress or modernity" with "a global vision that will serve to make the vacuousness of materialism more apparent".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Hanegraaff remarked that occultism was "essentially an attempt to adapt esotericism" to the "[[disenchantment|disenchanted world]]", a post-Enlightenment society in which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the "dimension of irreducible mystery" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from the "traditional esotericism" which accepted the premise of an "enchanted" world.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}} According to historian of esotericism [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], occultist groups typically seek "proofs and demonstrations by recourse to scientific tests or terminology".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=196}} 

Another feature of these occultists is that—unlike earlier esotericists—they often openly distanced themselves from [[Christianity]], in some cases (like that of Crowley) even adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This reflected how pervasive the influence of [[secularisation]] had been on all areas of European society.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} In rejecting Christianity, these occultists sometimes turned towards pre-Christian belief systems and embraced forms of [[Modern Paganism]], while others instead took influence from the religions of Asia, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In various cases, certain occultists did both.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} Another characteristic of these occultists was the emphasis that they placed on "the spiritual realization of the individual", an idea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century [[New Age]] and [[Human Potential Movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This spiritual realization was encouraged both through traditional Western 'occult sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial magic, but by the start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices drawn from non-Western contexts, such as [[yoga]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}

Although occultism is distinguished from earlier forms of esotericism, many occultists have also been involved in older esoteric currents. For instance, occultists like [[François-Charles Barlet]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] were also [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophers]],{{efn|This theosophy, which is a Christian esoteric tradition adhered to by theosophers, is a distinct movement from Theosophy, the occultist religion adhered to by Theosophists, despite the shared name.}} adhering to the ideas of the early modern Christian thinker [[Jakob Bohme]], and seeking to integrate ideas from Bohmian theosophy and occultism.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=89}}

==Etymology==

The earliest known usage of the term "occultism" is in the [[French language]], as ''l'occultisme''. In this form it appears in A. de Lestrange's article on "Ésotérisme chrétien" that was published in [[Jean-Baptiste Richard de Randonvilliers]]' ''Dictionnaire des mots nouveaux'' ("Dictionary of new words") in 1842.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1364}} The French esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] then used the term in his influential book on [[ritual magic]], ''[[Dogme et rituel de la haute magie]]'', first published in 1856.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} His use of the term deliberately acknowledged earlier practices that, since the Renaissance, had been termed "occult sciences" or "occult philosophy".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} It was from Lévi's usage of the term that it gained wider usage;{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2pp=1364–1365}} according to Faivre, Lévi was "the principal exponent of esotericism in Europe and the United States" at that time.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

The earliest use of the term "occultism" in the [[English language]] appears to be in "A Few Questions to 'Hiraf'", an 1875 article published in the American Spiritualist magazine, ''[[Spiritual Scientist]]''. The article had been written by [[Helena Blavatsky]], a Russian émigré living in the United States who founded the religion of Theosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1365}}

Various twentieth-century writers on the subject used the term "occultism" in different ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in his "Theses Against Occultism", employed the term as a broad synonym for [[irrationality]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} In his 1950 book ''L'occultisme'', [[Robert Amadou]] used the term as a synonym for [[Western esotericism|esotericism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} an approach that the later scholar of esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term "superfluous".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} Unlike Amadou, other writers saw "occultism" and "esotericism" as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 1970s, the sociologist [[Edward Tiryakian]] distinguished between ''occultism'', which he used in reference to practices, techniques, and procedures, and ''esotericism'', which he defined as the religious or philosophical belief systems on which such practices are based.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} This division was initially adopted by the early academic scholar of esotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he later abandoned it;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} it has been rejected by most scholars who study esotericism.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}}

A different division was used by the [[Traditionalist school|Traditionalist]] author [[René Guénon]], who used ''esotericism'' to describe what he believed was the Traditionalist, inner teaching at the heart of most religions, while ''occultism'' was used pejoratively to describe new religions and movements that he disapproved of, such as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and various [[secret societies]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|pp=887–888}} Guénon's use of this terminology was adopted by later writers like [[Serge Hutin]] and [[Luc Benoist]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} As noted by Hanegraaff, Guénon's use of these terms are rooted in his Traditionalist beliefs and "cannot be accepted as scholarly valid".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

The term "occultism" derives from the older term "occult", much as the term "esotericism" derives from the older term "esoteric".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} However, the historian of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] stated that it was important to distinguish between the meanings of the term "occult" and "occultism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=884}} Occultism is not a homogenous movement, and is widely diverse.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

Over the course of its history, the term "occultism" has been used in various different ways.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1364}} However, in contemporary uses, "occultism" commonly refers to forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] that developed in the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century derivations.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} In a descriptive sense, it has been used to describe forms of esotericism which developed in nineteenth-century France, especially in the [[Martinism|Neo-Martinist]] environment.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to the historian of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]], it is with the esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] that "the occultist current properly so-called" first appears.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Other prominent French esotericists involved in developing occultism included [[Papus]], [[Stanislas de Guaita]], [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville]], and [[Jean Bricaud]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}

===Etic uses of the term===
{{See also|Emic and etic}}
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|In the 1990s, the Dutch scholar Wouter Hanegraaff put forward a new definition of "occultism" for scholarly uses]]

In the mid-1990s, a new definition of "occultism" was put forth by Hanegraaff.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1367–1368}} According to Hanegraaff, the term "occultism" can be used not only for the nineteenth-century groups which openly self-described using that term, but can also be used in reference to "the ''type'' of esotericism that they represent".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} 
Seeking to define "occultism" so that the term would be suitable "as an [[wikt:etic#Adjective|etic]] category" for scholars, Hanegraaff devised the following definition: "a category in the study of religions, which comprises ''all attempts by esotericists to come to terms with a disenchanted world or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericism from the perspective of a disenchanted secular world''".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} Hanegraaff noted that this etic usage of the term would be independent of [[wikt:emic#Adjective|emic]] usages of the term employed by occultists and other esotericists themselves.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} 

In this definition, "occultism" covers many esoteric currents that have developed from the mid-nineteenth century onward, including Spiritualism, Theosophy, the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the [[New Age]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} Employing this etic understanding of "occultism", Hanegraaff argued that its development could begin to be seen in the work of the Swedish esotericist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and in the [[Mesmerism|Mesmerist]] movement of the eighteenth century, although added that occultism only emerged in "fully-developed form" as Spiritualism, a movement that developed in the United States during the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}}

Pasi suggested that the use of Hanegraaff's definition might cause confusion by presenting a group of nineteenth-century esotericists who called themselves "occultists" as just one part of a broader category of esotericists whom scholars would call "occultists".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1368}}

===The Occult===

The term "occult" has also been used as a [[substantivized adjective]] as "the occult", a term that has been particularly widely used among journalists and [[sociology|sociologists]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} This term was popularised by the publication of [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1971 book ''The Occult''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}
This term has been used as an "intellectual waste-basket" into which a wide array of beliefs and practices have been placed because they do not fit readily into the categories of [[religion]] or [[science]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to Hanegraaff, "the occult" is a category into which gets placed a range of beliefs from "spirits or fairies to parapsychological experiments, from UFO-abductions to Oriental mysticism, from vampire legends to channeling, and so on".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

===Occulture===

The neologism "occulture" was used within the [[industrial music]] scene of the late twentieth century, and was probably coined by one of its central figures, the musician and occultist [[Genesis P-Orridge]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
It was in this scene that the scholar of religion Christopher Partridge encountered the term.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
Partridge used the term in an academic sense. He stated that occulture was "the new spiritual environment in the West; the reservoir feeding new spiritual springs; the soil in which new spiritualities are growing".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=4}}

== Early life ==
Swami was born in [[North India]] on the twelfth night of the waxing moon in the month of [[Agrahayana|Margasirsa]], according to the Vedic calendar. Showing deep inclination towards [[spirituality]]&lt;ref&gt;Ramesh K Dhiman (2015-01-11)[http://www.theindiapost.com/articles/his-tryst-with-truth/ "His Tryst With Truth"] ''The India Post.''&lt;/ref&gt; from an early age, Swami studied a range of Vedic and astrological  texts, eventually becoming a professional astrologer during his teen years.  Quitting his job as a part-time editor for a weekly business newspaper, he left for [[Australia]] to pursue tertiary education and later acquired Australian citizenship.

During the days of his intense practice, he meditated for up to 22 hours every day including straight 10-hour stretches. &lt;ref&gt;Vidya Iyenger (2016-12-23) [http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/columns/you/the-monk-who-sold-his-porsche/articleshow/56125288.cms "The Monk Who Sold His Porsche"]''Bangalore Mirror.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
Swami gives his own perspective on enlightenment in his book ''If Truth Be Told''. "Enlightenment does not mean you have to live like a pauper. It does not mean you have to subject yourself to a life of hardship and abstinence. On the contrary, to be enlightened means to live in the light of love, compassion and truthfulness".&lt;ref name =ThePioneer&gt;(2015-01-11) [http://www.dailypioneer.com/sunday-edition/agenda/special/the-ultimate-realization.html "The Ultimate Realization"] ''The Pioneer.''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Wessel Zapffe''' (December 18, 1899&amp;nbsp;– October 12, 1990) was a [[Norwegian people|Norwegian]] [[metaphysician]], author, lawyer and [[mountaineer]]. He is often noted for his [[Pessimism#Philosophical pessimism|philosophically pessimistic]] and fatalistic view of human existence&lt;ref name="Zapffe2"&gt;Tangenes, Gisle, {{cite web | title=The view from mt Zapffe | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://philosophynow.org/issues/45/The_View_from_Mount_Zapffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;—his system of philosophy in line with the work of the earlier philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], by whom he was inspired—as well as his firm advocacy of [[antinatalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Zapffe remarked that children are brought into the world without consent or forethought: &lt;blockquote&gt;In accordance with my conception of life, I have chosen not to bring children into the world. A coin is examined, and only after careful deliberation, given to a beggar, whereas a child is flung out into the cosmic brutality without hesitation. (''To Be a Human Being'' (1989–90); the philosopher Peter Wessel Zapffe in his 90th year (1990 documentary, Tromsø Norway: [http://www.originalfilm.no/en/productions/zapffe.html Original Film AS])).&lt;/ref&gt; His thoughts regarding the error of human life are presented in the essay ''[[The Last Messiah]]'' (Norwegian: ''Den sidste Messias'', 1933). This essay is a shorter version of his best-known work, the philosophical treatise ''[[On the Tragic]]'' (''Om det tragiske'', 1941).

==Philosophical work==
Zapffe's view is that humans are born with an overdeveloped skill (understanding, self-knowledge) which does not fit into [[nature]]'s design. The human craving for justification on matters such as life and death cannot be satisfied, hence [[human race|humanity]] has a need that nature cannot satisfy. The tragedy, following this theory, is that humans spend all their time trying not to be human. The human being, therefore, is a [[paradox]].

In ''[[Den sidste Messias|The Last Messiah]]'' Zapffe described four principal defense mechanisms that humankind uses to avoid facing this paradox:

*Isolation is "a fully arbitrary dismissal from consciousness of all disturbing and destructive thought and feeling".&lt;ref name = "Zapffe1"/&gt;
*[[Anchoring]] is the "fixation of points within, or construction of walls around, the liquid fray of consciousness".&lt;ref name = "Zapffe1"/&gt; The anchoring mechanism provides individuals a value or an ideal that allows them to focus their attentions in a consistent manner. Zapffe also applied the anchoring principle to society, and stated "God, the Church, the State, [[morality]], fate, the laws of life, the people, the future"&lt;ref name = "Zapffe1"/&gt; are all examples of collective primary anchoring firmaments.
*[[Distraction]] is when "one limits attention to the critical bounds by constantly enthralling it with impressions".&lt;ref name="Zapffe1"&gt;Zapffe, Peter Wessel, {{cite web | title=The Last Messiah | work=Philosophy Now | url=http://www.philosophynow.org/issue45/45zapffe.htm | accessdate=April 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Distraction focuses all of one's energy on a task or idea to prevent the mind from turning in on itself.
*[[Sublimation (psychology)|Sublimation]] is the refocusing of energy away from negative outlets, toward positive ones. The individuals distance themselves and look at their existence from an aesthetic point of view (e.g., writers, poets, painters). Zapffe himself pointed out that his produced works were the product of sublimation.

Zapffe was a prolific mountaineer and took a very early interest in [[environmentalism]]. This form of [[nature conservation]]ism sprung from the intent, not of protecting nature, but to avoid human culturalization of nature. He is the author of many humorous short stories about climbing and other adventures in nature.

==Personal life==
Zapffe married twice. He remained married to his second wife Berit Zapffe until his death in 1990. Berit died in May 2008. Zapffe remained [[Voluntary childlessness|childless by choice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=56|title=Wisdom in the open air|first1=Peter|last1=Reed|first2= David|last2=Rothenberg|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|date=1993|chapter=Chapter 2: Peter Wessel Zapffe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter of Auvergne''' (died 1304) was a [[France|French]] philosopher and theologian.

He was a canon of [[Paris]]; some biographers have thought that he was [[Bishop of Clermont]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gallia Christiana]]'', II, 283&lt;/ref&gt; because a Bull of [[Boniface VIII]] of the year 1296 names as canon of Paris a certain Peter of Croc (Cros), already canon of Clermont;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, in "Mélanges d'arch. et d'hist.", Paris, 1882, II, 117-20&lt;/ref&gt; but it is more likely that they are distinct. Peter of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] was in Paris in 1301,&lt;ref&gt;Script. Prædicat., I, 489&lt;/ref&gt; and, according to several accounts, was a pupil of [[Thomas Aquinas]]. In 1279, while the various nations of the [[University of Paris]] were quarrelling about the rectorship, [[Simon de Brion]], [[papal legate]], appointed Peter of Auvergne, to that office; in 1296 he was elected to it.

==Works==

His published works are: 

*"Supplementum Commentarii S. Thomæ in tertium et quartum librum de cælo etmundo" (in "Opera S. Thomæ", II, ad finem)
*commentaries on [[Aristotle]]'s ''Meteororum'', ''De Juventute et senectute'', ''De longitudine et brevitate vitae'', ''De motu animalium''.

He has been credited with a supplement to Aquinas' ''[[Summa Theologica]]''. 

Peter also left numerous treatises which are either at the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]], or at l'[[Arsenal de Paris]]: "Sex quodlibeta" long discussions after the manner of St. Thomas; "Sophisma Determinatum"; "Quæstiones super totam logicam veterem Arist."; "Quæstiones super Perphyrium"; "In Arist. Metaphysicam"; "In libros Politicorum"; "De somno et vigilia"; "De veget. et plantis"; "De anima".

{{Paranormal}}
The '''Philadelphia Experiment''' is an alleged military experiment supposed to have been carried out by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], sometime around October 28, 1943. The U.S. Navy [[destroyer escort]] {{USS|Eldridge|DE-173}} was claimed to have been rendered [[invisibility|invisible]] (or "[[cloaking device|cloaked]]") to enemy devices.

The story first appeared in 1955, in letters of unknown origin sent to a writer and astronomer, [[Morris K. Jessup]]. It is widely understood to be a [[hoax]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://skepdic.com/philadel.html | title = Philadelphia experiment | first = Robert Todd | last = Carroll | authorlink = Robert Todd Carroll | work = [[The Skeptic's Dictionary]] | date = 2007-12-03 | accessdate = 2008-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Borderlands"&gt;{{cite book | title = Borderlands | first = Mike | last = Dash | authorlink = Mike Dash | location = Woodstock, New York | publisher = Overlook Press | year = 2000 | origyear = 1997 | isbn = 978-0-87951-724-3 | oclc = 41932447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_293.html | title = Did the U.S. Navy teleport ships in the Philadelphia Experiment? | last = Adams | first = Cecil | authorlink = Cecil Adams | work = [[The Straight Dope]] | date = 1987-10-23 | accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. Navy maintains that no such experiment was ever conducted, that the details of the story contradict well-established facts about USS ''Eldridge'', and that the alleged  claims do not conform to known [[physical laws]].&lt;ref name=USN-NHC&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq21-1.htm | title = The "Philadelphia Experiment" | publisher = Naval Historical Center of the [[United States Navy]] | date = 2000-11-28 | accessdate = 2007-02-20 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220130747/http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq21-1.htm | archivedate = 2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of the story ==

In 1955, astronomer and UFO buff [[Morris K. Jessup]], the author of the just published book ''The Case for the UFO'', about [[unidentified flying object]]s and the exotic means of [[propulsion]] they might use, received two letters from a Carlos Miguel Allende&lt;ref name="The Philadelphia Experiment From A-Z 1925"&gt;{{cite web | title=Carlos Miguel Allende or Carl Meredith Allen or... | website=The Philadelphia Experiment From A-Z | date=31 May 1925 | url=https://www.de173.com/carlos-miguel-allende-carl-allen/ | access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (who also identified himself as "Carl M. Allen" in another correspondence) who claimed to have witnessed a secret [[World War Two]] experiment at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]. In this experiment, Allende claimed the destroyer escort {{USS|Eldridge|DE-173}} was rendered invisible, teleported to [[New York City|New York]], teleported to another dimension where it encountered aliens, and teleported through time, resulting in the death of several sailors, some of whom were fused with the ship's hull.&lt;ref name=Barna&gt;Barna William Donovan (2011). ''Conspiracy Films: A Tour of Dark Places in the American Conscious'', McFarland. p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; Jessup dismissed Allende as a "crackpot".&lt;ref name=Barna /&gt;

In early 1957, Jessup was contacted by the [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR) in [[Washington, D.C.]], who had received a parcel containing a paperback copy of ''The Case for the UFO'' in a manila envelope marked "Happy Easter." The book had been extensively annotated in its margins, written with three different shades of pink ink, appearing to detail a correspondence among three individuals, only one of which is given a name: "Jemi." The ONR labelled the other two "Mr. A." and "Mr. B."

The annotators referred to each other as "[[Gypsies]]" and discussed two different types of "people" living in [[outer space]]. Their text contained [[non-standard]] use of [[capitalization]] and [[punctuation]], and detailed a lengthy discussion of the merits of various elements of Jessup's [[wikt:assumption#Noun|assumptions]] in the book. There were oblique references to the Philadelphia Experiment (one example is that "Mr. B." reassures his fellow annotators who have highlighted a certain theory which Jessup advanced).&lt;ref name=Moseley&gt;Moseley, James W. &amp; Karl T. Pflock (2002), ''Shockingly Close to the Truth!: Confessions of a Grave-Robbing Ufologist.'' [[Prometheus Books]]. {{ISBN|1-57392-991-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the [[handwriting style]] and subject matter, Jessup concluded a large part of the writing was Allende's,&lt;ref name=Barna /&gt; and others have the same conclusion, that the three styles of annotations are from the same person using three pens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://philadelphiaexperiment.crossingmymind.com/morris-jessup-philadelphia-experiment/ "Morris K. Jessup: Unwitting Pioneer Of The Legend, philadelphiaexperiment.crossingmymind.com"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001133035/http://philadelphiaexperiment.crossingmymind.com/morris-jessup-philadelphia-experiment/ |date=2015-10-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ONR funded a [[self-publishing|small printing]] of 100 copies of the volume by the Texas-based Varo Manufacturing Company, which later became known as the Varo edition, with the annotations therefore known as the Varo annotations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windmill-slayer.tripod.com/aliascarlosallende/id2.html Introduction to the Varo edition of M. K. Jessup's Case for the UFO]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jessup tried to publish more books on the subject of UFOs, but was unsuccessful. Losing his publisher and experiencing a downturn in his personal life led him to commit suicide in Florida on April 30, 1959.&lt;ref name=Barna /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bainton /&gt;

===Repetitions===

In 1963, [[Vincent Gaddis]] published a book of [[Charles Fort#Fortean phenomena|Forteana]], titled ''Invisible Horizons: True Mysteries of the Sea.'' In it he recounted the story of the experiment from the Varo annotations.

George E. Simpson and Neal R. Burger published a 1978 novel titled ''Thin Air.'' In this book, set in the present day, a [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service|Naval Investigative Service]] officer investigates several threads linking wartime invisibility experiments to a [[List of conspiracies (political)|conspiracy]] involving [[Teleportation|matter transmission]] technology.

Large-scale popularization of the story came about in 1979 when the author [[Charles Berlitz]], who had written a best selling book on the [[Bermuda Triangle]], and his co-author, [[ufologist]] [[Bill Moore (ufologist)|William L. Moore]], published ''The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility,'' which purported to be a factual account.&lt;ref name=Bainton&gt;Roy Bainton (2013). ''The Mammoth Book of Unexplained Phenomena: From bizarre biology to inexplicable astronomy'', [[Little, Brown Book Group]]. p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; The book expanded on stories of bizarre happenings, lost [[unified field theory|unified field theories]] by [[Albert Einstein]], and government [[coverup]]s, all based on the Allende/Allen letters to Jessup.&lt;ref name=Barna /&gt;

Moore and Berlitz devoted one of the last chapters in ''The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility'' to "The Force Fields Of Townsend Brown," namely the experimenter and then-U.S. Navy technician [[Thomas Townsend Brown]]. Paul Violette's book ''Secrets of Anti-Gravity Propulsion''{{when |date=July 2017}} also recounts some mysterious involvement of Townsend Brown.

The story was adapted into a 1984 [[time travel in fiction|time travel film]] called ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (film)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]'', directed by [[Stewart Raffill]]. Though only loosely based on the prior accounts of the "Experiment", it served to dramatize the core elements of the original story. In 1990, Alfred Bielek,&lt;ref&gt;Death of Al Bielek announced on ''[[Coast to Coast AM]]'' broadcast by [[George Noory]] on 13 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Adachi, Ken (October 14, 2011). [http://educate-yourself.org/ab/albielekpasses14oct11.shtml "Al Bielek Passed Away in Mexico on Oct. 10, 2011 at Age 84"]. Educate-Yourself.&lt;/ref&gt; a self-proclaimed former crew-member of USS ''Eldridge'' and an alleged participant in the Experiment,&lt;ref&gt;Bielek interview with Art Bell, Coast to Coast AM Radio, Phoenix, AZ, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; supported the version as it was portrayed in the film. He added details of his claims through the Internet, some of which were picked up by mainstream news outlets.&lt;ref name=debunk&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bielek-debunked.com | title = Al Bielek Debunked | date = 2008-01-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General synopsis===
:''Note: Several different, and sometimes contradictory versions of the alleged experiment have circulated over the years. The following synopsis recounts key story points common to most accounts.&lt;ref name="Borderlands"/&gt;''

The experiment was allegedly based on an aspect of some [[unified field theory]], a term coined by [[Albert Einstein]] to describe a class of potential theories; such theories would aim to describe&amp;nbsp;— mathematically and physically&amp;nbsp;— the interrelated nature of the forces of [[electromagnetism]] and [[gravitation|gravity]], in other words, uniting their respective fields into a single field.

According to some accounts, unspecified "researchers" thought that some version of this field would enable using large [[electrical generators]] to [[bend light]] around an object via [[refraction]], so that the object became completely invisible. The Navy regarded this of military value and it sponsored the experiment.

Another unattributed version of the story proposes that researchers were preparing magnetic and gravitational measurements of the [[seafloor]] to detect anomalies, supposedly based on Einstein's attempts to understand gravity. In this version, there were also related secret experiments in [[Nazi Germany]] to find [[anti-gravity]], allegedly led by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Obergruppenführer]] [[Hans Kammler]].

There are no reliable, attributable accounts, but in most accounts of the supposed experiment, USS ''Eldridge'' was fitted with the required equipment at the [[Philadelphia Naval Shipyard]]. Testing began in the summer of 1943, and it was supposedly successful to a limited extent. One test resulted in ''Eldridge'' being rendered nearly invisible, with some witnesses reporting a "greenish fog" appearing in its place. Crew members complained of severe [[nausea]] afterwards. Also, reportedly, when the ship reappeared, some sailors were embedded in the metal structures of the ship, including one sailor who ended up on a deck level below that where he began and had his hand embedded in the steel hull of the ship, as well as some sailors who went "completely [[wikt:bananas#Adjective|bananas]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Invisibility Cloaks |date=7 July 2009 |series=That's Impossible |series-link=That's Impossible (show) |network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]] |season=1 |number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a claim the experiment was altered after that point at the request of the Navy, limiting it to creating a [[stealth technology]] that would render USS ''Eldridge'' invisible to radar.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} None of these allegations have been independently substantiated.

The conjecture then claims that the equipment was not properly [[Calibration|re-calibrated]], but that in spite of this, the experiment was repeated on October 28, 1943. This time, ''Eldridge'' not only became invisible, but she disappeared from the area in a flash of blue light and [[Teleportation|teleported]] to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], over {{convert|200|mi|km}} away. It is claimed that ''Eldridge'' sat for some time in view of men aboard the ship {{SS|Andrew Furuseth}}, whereupon ''Eldridge'' vanished and then reappeared in [[Philadelphia]] at the site it had originally occupied. It was also said that the warship went approximately ten minutes back in time.

Many versions of the tale include descriptions of serious side effects for the crew. Some crew members were said to have been physically fused to bulkheads while others suffered from mental disorders, some re-materialized inside out, and still others vanished. It is also claimed that the ship's crew may have been subjected to [[Mind control|brainwashing]], to maintain the secrecy of the experiment.

==Evidence and research==

The historian [[Mike Dash]]&lt;ref name="Borderlands"/&gt; notes that many authors who publicized the "Philadelphia Experiment" story after that of Jessup appeared to have conducted little or no research of their own. Through the late 1970s, for example, Allende/Allen was often described as mysterious and difficult to locate, but Goerman determined Allende/Allen's identity after only a few telephone calls. Others speculate that much of the key literature emphasizes dramatic embellishment rather than pertinent research. Berlitz's and Moore's account of the story (''The Philadelphia Experiment: Project Invisibility'') claimed to include factual information, such as transcripts of an interview with a scientist involved in the experiment, but their work has also been criticized for [[plagiarism|plagiarising]] key story elements from the novel ''Thin Air'' which was published a year earlier.

===Misunderstanding of documented naval experiments===
Personnel at the Fourth Naval District have suggested that the alleged event was a misunderstanding of routine research during World War II at the Philadelphia Naval Shipyard. An earlier theory was that "the foundation for the apocryphal stories arose from [[degaussing]] experiments which have the effect of making a ship undetectable or 'invisible' to magnetic mines."&lt;ref name="USN-infosheet"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.history.navy.mil/faqs/faq21-2.htm | title = Information Sheet: Philadelphia Experiment | publisher = [[Naval Historical Center]] of the [[United States Navy]] | date = 1996-09-08 | accessdate = 2012-09-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible origin of the stories about [[levitation]], [[teleportation]] and effects on human crew might be attributed to experiments with the generating plant of the destroyer {{USS|Timmerman|DD-828}}, whereby a higher-frequency generator produced [[corona discharge]]s, although none of the crew reported suffering effects from the experiment.&lt;ref name="USN-infosheet" /&gt;

Observers have argued that it is inappropriate to grant credence to an unusual story promoted by one individual, in the absence of corroborating evidence. Robert Goerman wrote in ''[[Fate (magazine)|Fate]]'' magazine in 1980, that "Carlos Allende" / "Carl Allen", who is said to have corresponded with Jessup, was Carl Meredith Allen of [[New Kensington, Pennsylvania]], who had an established history of [[psychiatric illness]], and who may have fabricated the primary history of the experiment as a result of his mental illness. Goerman later realized that Allen was a family friend and "a creative and imaginative loner&amp;nbsp;... sending bizarre writings and claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{Skeptoid | id=4016 | number=16 | title= The Real Philadelphia Experiment |accessdate=2017-06-15|date=2006-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timeline inconsistencies===
The USS ''Eldridge'' was not commissioned until August 27, 1943, and it remained in port in [[New York City]] until September 1943. The October experiment allegedly took place while the ship was on its first [[shakedown cruise]] in [[The Bahamas]], although proponents of the story claim that the [[ship's logs]] might have been falsified or else still be [[Classified information in the United States|classified]].

The [[Office of Naval Research]] (ONR) stated in September 1996, "ONR has never conducted investigations on radar invisibility, either in 1943 or at any other time." Pointing out that the ONR was not established until 1946, it denounces the accounts of "The Philadelphia Experiment" as complete "[[science fiction]]."

A reunion of Navy veterans who had served aboard USS ''Eldridge'' told a Philadelphia newspaper in April 1999 that their ship had never made port in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Where Ship?

Researcher [[Jacques Vallée]]&lt;ref name="scientificexploration.org"&gt;Vallée, Jacques F. (1994) [http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf "Anatomy of a Hoax: The Philadelphia Experiment Fifty Years Later"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091222023540/http://www.scientificexploration.org/journal/jse_08_1_vallee.pdf |date=2009-12-22 }} ''[[Journal of Scientific Exploration]]'' Volume 8, Number 1, pg. 47-71&lt;/ref&gt; describes a procedure on board {{USS|Engstrom|DE-50}}, which was docked alongside the ''Eldridge'' in 1943. The operation involved the generation of a powerful electromagnetic field on board the ship in order to [[Deperming|deperm]] or [[Degaussing|degauss]] it, with the goal of rendering the ship undetectable or "invisible" to magnetically fused undersea [[naval mine|mines]] and [[torpedo]]es. This system was invented by a Canadian, [[Charles F. Goodeve]], when he held the rank of [[commander]] in the [[Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve]], and the [[Royal Navy]] and other navies used it widely during World War II. British ships of the era often included such degaussing systems built into the upper decks (the [[Electrical conduit|conduits]] are still visible on the deck of {{HMS|Belfast|C35}} in London, for example). Degaussing is still used today. However, it has no effect on visible light or radar. Vallée speculates that accounts of USS ''Engstrom's'' degaussing might have been garbled and confabulated in subsequent retellings, and that these accounts may have influenced the story of "The Philadelphia Experiment."

Vallée cites a veteran who served on board USS ''Engstrom'' and who suggests it might have travelled from Philadelphia to Norfolk and back again in a single day at a time when merchant ships could not: by use of the [[Chesapeake and Delaware Canal]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]], which at the time was open only to naval vessels.&lt;ref name="scientificexploration.org"/&gt; Use of that channel was kept quiet: German submarines had ravaged shipping along the East Coast during [[Second Happy Time|Operation Drumbeat]], and thus military ships unable to protect themselves were secretly moved via canals to avoid the threat.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://www.scientificexploration.org/jse/abstracts/v8n1a2.php abstract of "Anatomy of a Hoax: The Philadelphia Experiment Fifty Years Later"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927075259/http://www.scientificexploration.org/jse/abstracts/v8n1a2.php |date=2006-09-27 }} by Jacques F. Vallée, URL accessed February 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The same veteran claims to be the man that Allende witnessed "disappearing" at a bar. He claims that when the fight broke out, friendly barmaids whisked him out of the bar before the police arrived, because he was under age for drinking. They then covered for him by claiming that he had disappeared.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21326">The works of [[Philo]], a first-century Alexandrian philosopher, are mostly allegorical interpretations of the [[Torah]] (known in the Hellenic world as the [[Pentateuch]]), but also include histories and comments on philosophy. Most of these have been preserved in Greek by the [[Church Fathers]]; some survive only through an Armenian translation. 

Many of the titles by which texts and text groups are known are modern conventions and not inventions of Philo.&lt;ref name=Royse&gt;James R. Royse, with Adam Kamesar, "The Works of Philo", in Kamesar, ed. (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Commentaries on the Pentateuch==
Philo's commentary on the Pentateuch is usually classified within three genres.

=== Quaestiones ===
The ''Quaestiones'' explain the Pentateuch catechetically, in the form of questions and answers ("Zητήματα καὶ Aύσεις, Quæstiones et Solutiones"). Only the following fragments have been preserved: abundant passages in Armenian – possibly the full work – in explanation of Genesis and Exodus, an old Latin translation of a part of the "Genesis," and fragments from the Greek text in [[Eusebius]], in the "Sacra Parallela," in the "Catena," and also in [[Ambrosius]]. The explanation is confined chiefly to determining the literal sense, although Philo frequently refers to the allegorical sense as the higher.

=== Allegorical commentary ===
Νόμων Ἱερῶν Ἀλληγορίαι, or "Legum Allegoriæ," deals, so far as it has been preserved, with selected passages from [[The Book of Genesis|Genesis]]. According to Philo's original idea, the history of primal man is here considered as a symbol of the religious and moral development of the human soul. This great commentary included the following treatises:
#"Legum allegoriae," books i.-iii., on Gen. ii. 1-iii. 1a, 8b-19 (on the original extent and contents of these three books and the probably more correct combination of i. and ii.)&lt;ref&gt;Schürer,  ''Geschichte'' iii. 503&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De [[cherubim]]," on Gen. iii. 24, iv. 1;
#"De sacrificiis [[Cain and Abel|Abelis et Caini]]," on Gen. iv. 2-4 &lt;ref&gt;comp. Schürer, ''Geschichte'' iii. p.&amp;nbsp;504&lt;/ref&gt;;
#"De eo quod deterius potiori insidiatur";
#"De [[Cainites|posteritate Caini]]," on Gen. iv. 16-25&lt;ref&gt;see [[Leopold Cohn (Author)|Cohn]] and [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]], "Philonis Alexandrini," etc., ii., pp. xviii. et seq., 1-41; "Philologus," lvii. 248-288);&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De [[Nephilim|gigantibus]]," on Gen. vi. 1-4;
#"Quod Deus sit immutabilis," on Gen. vi. 4-12&lt;ref&gt;Schürer, ''Geschichte'' iii. p.&amp;nbsp;506] correctly combines Nos. 6 and 7 into one book; Massebieau, ''Classement'', adds after No. 7 the lost books Περὶ Διαϑηκῶν); ("Bibliothèque de l'Ecole des Hautes Etudes," p.&amp;nbsp;23, note 2, Paris, 1889)&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De Agricultura [[Noah|Noë]]," on Gen. ix. 20; &lt;ref&gt;Von Arnim, "Quellenstudien zu Philo von Alexandria," 1899, pp.&amp;nbsp;101–140)&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De [[Drunkenness|Ebrietate]]," on Gen. ix. 21&lt;ref&gt;on the lost second book see Schürer, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;507, and Von Arnim, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;53–100)&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Resipuit; Noë, seu De [[sobriety|Sobrietate]]," on Gen. ix. 24-27;
#"De [[Tower of Babel|Confusione Linguarum]]," on Gen. xi. 1-9;
#"De Migratione [[Abraham|Abrahami]]," on Gen. xii. 1-6;
#"Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit," on Gen. xv. 2-18;&lt;ref&gt;(on the work Περὶ Μισϑῶν cited in this treatise see Massebieau, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;27 et seq., note 3)&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De Congressu Quærendæ Eruditionis Gratia," on Gen. xvi. 1-6;
#"De Profugis,"&lt;ref&gt;This is often referred to nowadays as "De Fuga et Inventione".&lt;/ref&gt; on Gen. xvi. 6-14;
#"De Mutatione Nominum," on Gen. xvii, 1-22;&lt;ref&gt;on the fragment "De Deo," which contains a commentary on Gen. xviii. 2, see Massebieau, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;29;&lt;/ref&gt;
#"De Somniis," book i., on Gen. xxviii. 12 et seq., xxxi. 11 et seq. ([[Jacob's ladder|Jacob's dreams]]); "De Somniis," book ii., on [[Joseph (Genesis)#Joseph in prison|Gen. xxxvii. 40 et seq. (the dreams of Joseph, of the cupbearer, the baker, and Pharaoh). Philo's three other books on dreams have been lost. The first of these (on the dreams of [[Abimelech]] and [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]]) preceded the present book i., and discussed the dreams in which God Himself spoke with the dreamers, this fitting in very well with Gen. xx. 3.&lt;ref&gt;On a doxographic source used by Philo in book i., § 4 [i. 623], see Wendland in "Sitzungsbericht der Berliner Akademie." 1897. No. xlix. 1-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposition of the Law ===
Philo wrote a systematic work on [[Moses]] and his laws, which is usually prefaced by the treatise "De Opificio Mundi." The Creation is, according to Philo, the basis for the [[Halakha|Mosaic]] legislation, which is in complete harmony with nature ("De Opificio Mundi," § 1 [i. 1]). The exposition of the Law then follows in two sections. First come the biographies of the men who antedated the several written laws of the Torah, as [[Enos (biblical figure)|Enos]], [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Noah]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. These were the Patriarchs, who were the living impersonations of the active law of virtue before there were any written laws.

Then the laws are discussed in detail: first the chief ten commandments (the Decalogue), and then the precepts in amplification of each law. The work is divided into the following treatises: 
#"De Opificio Mundi" (comp. Siegfried in "Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Theologie," 1874, pp.&amp;nbsp;562–565; L Cohn's important separate edition of this treatise, Breslau, 1889, preceded the edition of the same in "Philonis Alexandrini," etc., 1896, i.).
#"De Abrahamo,"on Abraham, the representative of the virtue acquired by learning. The lives of Isaac and Jacob have been lost. The three patriarchs were intended as types of the ideal cosmopolitan condition of the world.
#"De Josepho," the life of Joseph, intended to show how the wise man must act in the actually existing state.
#"De Vita Mosis," books i.-iii.; Schürer, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;523, combines the three books into two; but, as Massebieau shows (l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;42 et seq.), a passage, though hardly an entire book, is missing at the end of the present second book (Wendland, in "Hermes," xxxi. 440). Schürer (l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;515, 524) excludes this work here, although he admits that from a literary point of view it fits into this group; but he considers it foreign to the work in general, since Moses, unlike the Patriarchs, can not be conceived as a universally valid type of moral action, and can not be described as such. The latter point may be admitted. but the question still remains whether it is necessary to regard the matter in this light. It seems most natural to preface the discussion of the law with the biography of the legislator, while the transition from Joseph to the legislation, from the statesman who has nothing to do with the divine laws to the discussion of these laws themselves, is forced and abrupt. Moses, as the perfect man, unites in himself, in a way, all the faculties of the patriarchal types. His is the "most pure mind" ("De Mutatione Nominum," 37 [i. 610]), he is the "lover of virtue," who has been purified from all passions ("De Allegoriis Legum," iii. 45, 48 [i. 113, 115]). As the person awaiting the divine revelation, he is also specially fitted to announce it to others, after having received it in the form of the Commandments (ib. iii. 4 [i. 89 et seq.]).
#"De Decalogo," the introductory treatise to the chief ten commandments of the Law.
#"De Specialibus Legibus," in which treatise Philo attempts to systematize the several laws of the Torah, and to arrange them in conformity with the Ten Commandments. To the first and second commandments he adds the laws relating to priests and sacrifices; to the third (misuse of the name of God), the laws on oaths, vows, etc.; to the fourth (on the Sabbath), the laws on festivals; to the fifth (to honor father and mother),the laws on respect for parents, old age, etc.; to the sixth, the marriage laws; to the seventh, the civil and criminal laws; to the eighth, the laws on theft; to the ninth, the laws on truthful testifying; and to the tenth, the laws on lust.&lt;ref&gt;Compare [[Bernhard Stade]]-[[Oskar Holtzmann]], ''Geschichte des Volkes Israel'', 1888, ii. 535-545; on Philo as influenced by the Halakah, see B Ritter, "Philo und die Halacha," Leipsic, 1879, and Siegfried's review of the same in the "Jenaer Literaturzeitung," 1879, No. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The first book includes the following treatises of the current editions: "De Circumcisione"; "De Monarchia," books i. and ii.; "De Sacerdotum Honoribus"; "De Victimis." On the division of the book into these sections, the titles of the latter, and newly found sections of the text, see Schürer, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;517; Wendland, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;136 et seq. The second book includes in the editions a section also entitled "De Specialibus Legibus" (ii. 270-277), to which is added the treatise "De Septenario," which is, however, incomplete in [[Thomas Mangey|Mangey]]. The greater part of the missing portion was supplied, under the title "De Cophini Festo et de Colendis Parentibus," by Mai (1818), and was printed in Richter's edition, v. 48-50, Leipsic, 1828. The complete text of the second book was published by [[Lobegott Friedrich Konstantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]] in his "Philonea" (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–83). The third book is included under the title "De Specialibus Legibus" in ed. Mangey, ii. 299-334. The fourth book also is entitled "De Specialibus Legibus"; to it the last sections are added under the titles "De Judice" and "De Concupiscentia" in the usual editions; and they include, also, as appendix, the sections "De Justitia" and "De Creatione Principum." 
#The treatises "De Fortitudine," "De Caritate," and "De Pœnitentia" are a kind of appendix to "De Specialibus Legibus."&lt;ref&gt;Schürer, ''Geschichte'' pp.&amp;nbsp;519 [note 82], 520-522&lt;/ref&gt; combines them into a special book, which, he thinks, was composed by Philo.
#"De Præmiis et Pœnis" and "De Execratione." On the connection of both &lt;ref&gt;Schürer, ''Geschichte''pp.&amp;nbsp;522 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the conclusion of the exposition of the Mosaic law.

This exposition is more exoteric than allegorical and might have been intended for [[gentile]] audiences.&lt;ref name=Royse /&gt;

== Independent works ==
#"Quod Omnis Probus Liber," the second half of a work on the freedom of the just according to [[stoicism|Stoic]] principles. The genuineness of this work has been disputed by [[Zecharias Frankel|Frankel]] (in "Monatsschrift," ii. 30 et seq., 61 et seq.), by [[Heinrich Grätz|Grätz]] ("Gesch." iii. 464 et seq.), and more recently by [[Ansfeld]] (1887), [[Hilgenfeld]] (in "Zeitschrift für Wissenschaftliche Theologie," 1888, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–71), and others. Now [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]], [[Ohle]], [[Emil Schürer|Schürer]], [[Massebieau]], and [[Emil Krell|Krell]] consider it genuine, with the exception of the partly interpolated passages on the Essenes.
#"In Flaccum" and "De Legatione ad Caium," an account of the Alexandrian persecution of the Jews under [[Caligula]]. This account, consisting originally of five books, has been preserved in fragments only (see Schürer, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;525 et seq.).&lt;ref&gt;See also commentary by Pieter W. van der Horst, 'Philo's Flaccus: The First Pogrom. Introduction, Translation, and Commentary' 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Philo intended to show the fearful punishment meted out by God to the persecutors of the Jews (on Philo's predilection for similar discussions see Siegfried, "Philo von Alexandria," p.&amp;nbsp;157).
#"De Providentia," preserved only in Armenian, and printed from Aucher's Latin translation in the editions of Richter and others (on Greek fragments of the work see Schürer, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;531 et seq.).
#"De Animalibus" (on the title see Schürer, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;532; in Richter's ed. viii. 101-144).
#ϓποθετικά ("Counsels"), a work known only through fragments in Eusebius, ''[[Præparatio Evangelica]]'', viii. 6, 7. The meaning of the title is open to discussion; it may be identical with the following
#Περὶ Ἰουδαίων an apology for the Jews (Schürer, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;532 et seq.).

For a list of the lost works of Philo see Schürer, l.c. p.&amp;nbsp;534.

==Other works ascribed to Philo==
===De Vita Contemplativa===
This work&lt;ref&gt;regarding other titles see Schürer, ''Geschichte'', p.&amp;nbsp;535.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the mode of life and the religious festivals of a society of Jewish ascetics, who according to the author, are widely scattered over the earth, and are found especially in every [[Nome (Egypt)|nome]] in [[Egypt]]. The writer, however, confines himself to describing the [[Therapeutae]], a colony of hermits settled on the [[Lake Mareotis]] in Egypt, where each lives separately in his own dwelling. Six days of the week they spend in pious contemplation, chiefly in connection with Scripture. On the seventh day both men and women assemble together in a hall; and the leader delivers a discourse consisting of an allegorical interpretation of a Scriptural passage. The feast of the fiftieth day is especially celebrated. The ceremony begins with a frugal meal consisting of bread, salted vegetables, and water, during which a passage of Scripture is interpreted. After the meal the members of the society in turn sing religious songs of various kinds, to which the assembly answers with a refrain. The ceremony ends with a choral representation of the triumphal festival that Moses and Miriam arranged after the passage through the [[Red Sea]], the voices of the men and the women uniting in a choral symphony until the sun rises. After a common morning prayer each goes home to resume his contemplation. Such is the contemplative life (βίος θεωρητικός) led by these Θεραπευταί ("servants of Yhwh").

The ancient Church looked upon these ''[[Therapeutæ]]'' as disguised Christian monks. This view has found advocates even in very recent times; [[P. E. Lucius|Lucius]]' opinion particularly, that the Christian monkdom of the third century was here glorified in a Jewish disguise, was widely accepted ("Die Therapeuten," 1879). But the ritual of the society, which was entirely at variance with Christianity, disproves this view. The chief ceremony especially, the choral representation of the passage through the Red Sea, has no special significance for Christianity; nor have there ever been in the Christian Church nocturnal festivals celebrated by men and women together. 

[[Massebieau]] ("Revue de l'Histoire des Religions," 1887, xvi. 170 et seq., 284 et seq.), [[F. C. Conybeare|Conybeare]] ("Philo About the Contemplative Life," Oxford, 1895), and [[Paul Wendland|Wendland]] ("Die Therapeuten," etc., Leipsig, 1896) ascribe the entire work to Philo, basing their argument wholly on linguistic reasons, which seem sufficiently conclusive. But there are great dissimilarities between the fundamental conceptions of the author of the "De Vita Contemplativa" and those of Philo. The latter looks upon Greek culture and philosophy as allies, the former is hostile to Greek philosophy (see Siegfried in "Protestantische Kirchenzeitung," 1896, No.42). He repudiates a science that numbered among Its followers the sacred band of the [[Pythagoreans]], inspired men like [[Parmenides]], [[Empedocles]], [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]], [[Cleanthes]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Plato]], whom Philo prized ("Quod Omnis Probus," i., ii.; "Quis Rerum Divinarum Heres Sit," 43; "De Providentia," ii. 42, 48, etc.). He considers the [[symposium]] a detestable, common drinking-bout. This can not be explained as a Stoic diatribe; for in this case Philo would not have repeated it. And Philo would have been the last to interpret the Platonic [[Eros]] in the vulgar way in which it is explained in the "De Vita Contemplativa," 7 (ii. 480), as he repeatedly uses the myth of double man allegorically in his interpretation of Scripture ("De Opificio Mundi," 24; "De Allegoriis Legum," ii. 24). It must furthermore be remembered that Philo in none of his other works mentions these colonies of allegorizing ascetics, in which he would have been highly interested had he known of them. But pupils of Philo may subsequently have founded near Alexandria similar colonies that endeavored to realize his ideal of a pure life triumphing over the senses and passions; and they might also have been responsible for the one-sided development of certain of the master's principles. While Philo desired to renounce the lusts of this world, he held fast to the scientific culture of Hellenism, which the author of this book denounces. Although Philo liked to withdraw from the world in order to give himself up entirely to contemplation, and bitterly regretted the lack of such repose ("De Specialibus Legibus," 1 [ii. 299]), he did not abandon the work that was required of him by the welfare of his people.

===Other===
*"De Incorruptibilitate Mundi." [[Jakob Bernays]] has argued convincingly that this work is spurious. Its [[wikt:peripatetic|Peripatetic]] basic idea that the world is eternal and indestructible contradicts all those Jewish teachings that were for Philo an indisputable presupposition. Bernays has proved at the same time that the text has been confused through wrong pagination, and he has cleverly restored it.&lt;ref&gt;"Gesammelte Abhandlungen," 1885, i. 283-290; "Abhandlung der Berliner Akademie," 1876, Philosophical-Historical Division, pp.&amp;nbsp;209–278; ib. 1882, sect. iii. 82; Von Arnim, l.c. pp.&amp;nbsp;1–52&lt;/ref&gt;
*"De Mundo," a collection of extracts from Philo, especially from the preceding work&lt;ref&gt;comp. Wendland, "Philo," ii., pp. vi.-x.).&lt;/ref&gt;
*"De Sampsone" and "De Jona," in Armenian, published with Latin translation by [[Jean-Baptiste Aucher]].
*"Interpretatio Hebraicorum Nominum," a collection, by an anonymous Jew, of the Hebrew names occurring in Philo. [[Origen]] enlarged it by adding New Testament names; and [[Jerome]] revised it. On the etymology of names occurring in Philo's exegetical works see below.&lt;ref&gt;Further down in the ''Jewish Encyclopedia'' article.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A "Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum," which was printed in the sixteenth century and then disappeared, has been discussed by Cohn in "J. Q. R." 1898, x. 277-332. It narrates Biblical history from Adam to Saul&lt;ref&gt;see Schürer, ''Geschichte'' iii., p.&amp;nbsp;542.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Philosophy Talk''''' is a [[talk radio]] program co-hosted by [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], [[Kenneth Allen Taylor|Ken Taylor]], and [[Joshua Landy]], who are professors at [[Stanford University]]. The show is also available as a [[podcast]], available for purchase. The program deals both with fundamental problems of [[philosophy]] and with the works of famous philosophers, especially as these relate to our contemporary, day-to-day lives. Some of the wide range of topics of past programs include [[terrorism]], [[misogyny]], [[intellectual humility]], [[democracy]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[genetic engineering]], and [[virtue]]. The program is broadcast from the studios of [[KALW]], 91.7 FM, [[San Francisco]], California and is nationally syndicated, airing on radio stations around the country as well as on SiriusXM.

The show focuses on one topic or famous philosopher for an hour at a time, with an invited guest who is an expert on the philosopher or area of philosophy in question. Listener questions are invited and responded to. As with most philosophical discussions, each show usually provides some factual information about the topic, as well as methods and points of view that are helpful in thinking about the topic. The ''Philosophy Talk'' motto is, “the program that questions everything, except your intelligence.”

'''Philosophy of law''' is a branch of [[philosophy]] and [[jurisprudence]] that seeks to answer basic questions about [[law]] and [[legal system]]s, such as "What is law?", "What are the criteria for legal [[Validity (logic)|validity]]?", "What is the relationship between law and [[morality]]?", and many other similar questions.

==Analytical jurisprudence==
"The principal objective of [[analytical jurisprudence]] has traditionally been to provide an account of what distinguishes law as a system of norms from other systems of norms, such as ethical norms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Law|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question that has received the most attention from philosophers of law is ''What is law?''  Several schools of thought have provided rival answers to this question, the most influential of which are:
*[[Natural law]] theory asserts that there are laws that are immanent in nature, to which enacted laws should correspond as closely as possible.  This view is frequently summarized by the maxim: an unjust law is not a true law, 'unjust' being defined as contrary to natural law.
*[[Legal positivism]] is the view that the law is defined by the social rules or practices that identify certain norms as laws.  One of the early positivists was in the early nineteenth century [[John Austin (legal philosopher)|John Austin]], who was influenced by the writings of Jeremy Bentham. Austin held that the law is the command of the sovereign backed by the threat of punishment. Contemporary legal positivism has long abandoned this view. In the twentieth century, two positivists had a profound influence on the philosophy of law. On the continent, Hans Kelsen was the most influential, where his notion of a "grundnorm" ultimate and basic legal norm, still retains some influence.  In the Anglophone world, the pivotal writer was [[H. L. A. Hart]], who argued that the law should be understood as a system of social rules.  Hart rejected Kelsen's views that sanctions were essential to law and that a normative social phenomenon, such as law, cannot be grounded in non-normative social facts.  According to Hart, law is essentially a system of primary social rules that guide the conduct of law's subjects, and secondary rules that regulate how the primary rules may be changed, how disputes about them are to be adjudicated and, especially, how the primary rules are to be identified. Hart argues that this last function is performed by a "rule of recognition", a customary practice of the officials (especially judges) that identifies certain acts and decisions as sources of law. Hart's theory, although widely admired, has also been criticized by a variety of late twentieth century philosophers of law, including his former student, Ronald Dworkin, John Rawls, Joseph Raz, and John Finnis.
*[[Legal realism]] was a view popular with some Scandinavian and American writers.{{who|date=March 2017}}{{when|date=March 2017}}  Skeptical in tone, it holds that the law should be understood as being determined by the actual practices of courts, law offices, and police stations, rather than as the rules and doctrines set forth in statutes or learned treatises.  It has some affinities with the sociology of law.
*[[Interpretivism (legal)|Legal interpretivism]] is the view, espoused mainly by Ronald Dworkin in his text titled ''[[Law's Empire]]'', that law is not entirely based on social facts, but includes the morally best justification for the institutional facts and practices that we intuitively regard as legal.  It follows on Dworkin's view that one cannot know whether a society has a legal system in force, or what any of its laws are, until one knows some moral truths about the justifications for the practices in that society.  It is consistent with Dworkin's view—in contrast with the views of legal positivists or legal realists—that ''no one'' in a society may know what its laws are (because no one may know the best justification of its practices.)

In recent years, debates about the nature of law have become increasingly fine-grained.  One important debate is within legal positivism.  One school is sometimes called "exclusive legal positivism", and it is associated with the view that the legal validity of a norm can never depend on its moral correctness.  A second school is labeled "inclusive legal positivism", and it is associated with the view that moral considerations ''may'' determine the legal validity of a norm, but that it is not necessary that this is the case.  Some philosophers used to contend that positivism was the theory that there is "no necessary connection" between law and morality; but influential contemporary positivists, including Joseph Raz, John Gardner, and Leslie Green, reject that view. As Raz points out, it is a necessary truth that there are vices that a legal system cannot possibly have (for example, it cannot commit rape or murder).  In fact, it is even unclear whether Hart himself held this view in its broad form, for he insisted both that to be a legal system rules must have a certain minimum content, which content overlaps with moral concerns, and that it must attain at least some degree of justice in the administration of laws.

A second important debate in recent years concerns [[interpretivism (legal)|interpretivism]], a view that is associated mainly with [[Ronald Dworkin]].  An interpretivist theory of law holds that legal rights and duties are determined by the best interpretation of the political practices of a particular community.  Interpretation, according to Dworkin's [[law as integrity]] theory, has two dimensions.  To count as an interpretation, the reading of a text must meet the criterion of ''fit''.  But of those interpretations that fit, Dworkin maintains that the correct interpretation is the one that puts the political practices of the community in their best light, or makes of them ''the best that they can be''.  But many writers have doubted whether there ''is'' a single best justification for the complex practices of any given community, and others have doubted whether, even if there are, they should be counted as part of the law of that community.

==Normative jurisprudence==
In addition to analytic jurisprudence, legal philosophy is also concerned with normative theories of law.  "Normative jurisprudence involves normative, evaluative, and otherwise prescriptive questions about the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Philosophy of Law|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/law-phil/#H2|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, What is the goal or purpose of law?  What moral or political theories provide a foundation for the law?  Three approaches have been influential in contemporary moral and political philosophy, and these approaches are reflected in normative theories of law:
* [[Utilitarianism]] is the view that the laws should be crafted so as to produce the best consequences.  Historically, utilitarian thinking about law is associated with the philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]].  In contemporary legal theory, the utilitarian approach is frequently championed by scholars who work in the [[law and economics]] tradition.
* [[Deontology]] is the view that the laws should protect individual autonomy, liberty, or rights.  The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] formulated a deontological theory of law (but not the only one possible).  A contemporary deontological approach can be found in the work of the legal philosopher [[Ronald Dworkin]].
* Aretaic moral theories such as contemporary [[virtue ethics]] emphasize the role of character in morality.  [[Virtue jurisprudence]] is the view that the laws should promote the development of virtuous characters by citizens.  Historically, this approach is associated with Aristotle.  Contemporary virtue jurisprudence is inspired by philosophical work on virtue ethics.
There are many other normative approaches to the philosophy of law, including [[critical legal studies]] and [[libertarian theories of law]].

==Philosophical approaches to legal problems==

Philosophers of law are also concerned with a variety of philosophical problems that arise in particular legal subjects, such as [[constitutional law]], [[Contract]] law, [[Criminal law]], and [[Tort]] law. Thus, philosophy of law addresses such diverse topics as [[Contract theory|theories of contract law]], theories of criminal punishment, theories of tort liability, and the question of whether judicial review is justified.

The new Science of Spirituality International Meditation Center, located in Lisle, Illinois was inaugurated in July 2018. The event was attended by thousands of visitors from over thirty different countries. Situated on 9 acres of land, the building, in both form and function, embodies the message of peace, community and universality. The official ribbon cutting ceremony took place in front of the “Meditator” statue on the reflecting pool at the front entrance to the Center. Helping Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj cut the gold ribbon, were representatives from the US Congress as well as mayors from the Village of Lisle and the City of Wheaton. Also present among the 60-member delegation of dignitaries, were representatives from Gensler and Skender, the architectural firm and contractors respectively, that helped bring the vision of the Center to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://epaper.desitalkchicago.com/2018_08_17/29/#zoom=z|title=Science of Spirituality Meditation center opens In Chicagoland|last=New Headquarters|date=17 August 2018|work=Desi Talk Chicago|access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theindianpanorama.news/unitedstates/sant-rajinder-singh-ji-maharaj-head-of-science-of-spirituality-inaugurates-spectacular-new-national-headquarters-in-chicago/|title=Sant Rajinder Singh Ji Maharaj, Head of Science of Spirituality, inaugurates spectacular new Meditation centre.|last=New Headquarters|date=24 August 2018|work=The Indian Panorama|access-date=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sengai Gibon - Kanzan and Jittoku.jpg|thumbnail|left|Sengai Gibon's "Kanzan and Jittoku", Japan, 18th-19th century.]]
{{nihongo|'''Sengai Gibon'''|仙厓 義梵||extra=1750 - 1837}} was a [[Japan]]ese monk of the [[Rinzai]] (臨在宗) school (one of three main schools of Zen Buddhism in Japan, the others being the Sōtō school and the much smaller Ōbaku school.). He was known for his controversial teachings and writings, as well as for his lighthearted [[sumi-e]] paintings. After spending half of his life in Nagata near [[Yokohama]], he secluded himself in Shōfukuji (in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]]), the first Zen temple in Japan, where he spent the rest of his life.

Though the Rinzai sect is particularly known for its hard-to-understand teachings, Sengai tried to make them accessible to the public.

One of his famous paintings shows a circle, a square and a triangle. Sengai left the painting without a title or inscription (save for his signature); the painting is often called "The Universe" when referred to in English.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"My play with brush and ink is not calligraphy nor painting; yet unknowing people mistakenly think: this is calligraphy, this is painting." — Sengai Gibon &lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Shekhinah Mountainwater''' (October 24, 1938 - August 11, 2007&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tamungina.com/2007/08/shekhinah-mountainwater-1939-2007.html|title=Shekhinah Mountainwater (1939-2007): Author, singer, spiritualist found truth in goddess myths|last=Ragan|first=Tom|date=August 2007|work=Santa Cruz Sentinel|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a musician, author, teacher, priestess of [[Aphrodite]],&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; and a key figure in the [[Goddess movement]]. She is well known on the [[West Coast of the United States|west coast]] of the [[United States]], but has a significant following throughout America and abroad for her music, writing, teaching, Womanrunes, Moonwheels, Goddess ritual, and spiritual and social activism.

Mountainwater referred to herself as a "muse-ical mystical magical woman who loves the Goddess and women, a foremother of the Womanspirit movement, a teacher of Women's Mysteries, and a priestess of Aphrodite."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shekhinah.net/About%20Shekhinah.htm|title=About Shekhinah|last1=|first1=|date=|website=Moonspell|publisher=Shekhinah Mountainwater|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119143727/http://www.shekhinah.net/About%20Shekhinah.htm|archive-date=19 January 2008|dead-url=yes|accessdate=12 December 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She dedicated her life to sharing and expressing the love of the Goddess, leading women to reclaim their power and connection to one another and to the earth. Her music, [[poetry]], [[tarot]] and learned writings are still celebrated in women's circles worldwide.

Mountainwater was a pioneer of what is now referred to in some circles as “Pagan music;” her unique melding of folk and spiritual, ritualistic themes eventually led to her passion for the Goddess. She began folksinging during the American folk music revival of the 1950s and 60's, and played in the same coffee houses in the Village in New York as [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Mountainwater was one of the first musicians in the early 60’s folk movement to start re-tuning the guitar to simple chords, creating a unique and resonant sound that was reminiscent of the organ, or sometimes even the bag-pipe. This movement was called “Modal Music.” In Mountainwater’s case, the lower strings were often used to create a base-drone, while the others harmonized or quarreled with them. Although the bulk of her early influences were Scottish, Celtic, English, Appalachian and American folk, her work has Arabic and African under/overtones. Besides creating a distinctive style and sound, she was a prolific and gifted poet. Her literary compositions stand on their own for eloquence and social pertinence. Motivated by a passionate spirituality, she often chose mythical or occult themes for her treatments. She was able to communicate stories from the protagonist’s perspective, allowing the listener to delve into the psyche of her characters -- to feel the pain and joy of an icon personified.

As she became more active in the women’s spiritual community, her songs were often overtly political, or designed as tools for trance induction and prayer. Her creations however, remained unfailingly personal and poetic, and many remember her ironic wit and brilliance in performance. 

Mountainwater is best known for her book ''Ariadne's Thread: A Workbook of Goddess Magic''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ariadne's Thread: A Workbook of Goddess Magic|last=Shekhinah|first=Mountainwater|publisher=Crossing Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0895944757|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is considered a classic by many practitioners and seekers of women's spirituality and goddess worship. The text encourages women to find their own spiritual path, using the figure of the ancient goddess [[Ariadne]] as a metaphor, and elucidating the mysteries of woman-centered spirituality, while offering guidance through the cycles of life. These include the [[Lunar phase|phases of the moon]], the yearly [[Wheel of the Year|nature holidays]], and the aspects of [[divination]]. ''Ariadne’s Thread'' can be used as a study guide or manual; each chapter concludes with suggested exercises, meditations, and reading lists. The book will be republished in the fall of 2018 by Echo Point Books.

Mountainwater's songs and chants endeared her to music lovers as well as witches and practitioners of Goddess worship, magic and ritual. ''Witch's Choice, Lady with the Lamp, Cry of the Phoenix, Mischievous Fairy, Lady Mother of All, The Year is a Dancing Woman, A Solstice Story'', and ''Power Spot'' are just a few of her most popular titles.

Mountainwater was diagnosed with cancer in 2005, and died on August 11, 2007.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Since her death, her children have endeavored to establish her intellectual estate through the home-spun company known as ''ShekhinahWorks''. In 2014, Shekhinah's birth-daughter committed to an ongoing project to collect, collate and make available her mother's works. Her projects include: republishing ''Ariadne's Thread'', publishing a digital, or Kindle copy of ''Ariadne's Thread'', creating a commemorative Facebook page, YouTube channel, and website, and a remastering and publishing of Mountainwater's original tarot deck.

In 2012, Molly Remer of Brigid's Grove found Mountainwater's Womanrunes in a copy of Sagewoman magazine from 1988. She made her own set and then began to expand on the interpretations of the symbols. With the permission of Mountainwater's estate, Remer created a card deck of the runes and wrote a book of interpretations to accompany the deck. She published the deck and book in 2014 in order to reintroduce the women's spirituality movement to these "woman-identified"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.brigidsgrove.com/womanrunes/|title=Womanrunes|last=Remer|first=Molly|date=2018|website=Brigid's Grove|access-date=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; runes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22879">The '''simulation hypothesis''' or '''simulation theory''' proposes that all of reality, including the earth and the universe, is in fact an artificial simulation, most likely a [[computer simulation]]. Some versions rely on the development of a [[simulated reality]], a proposed technology that would seem realistic enough to convince its inhabitants the simulation was real. The hypothesis has been a central plot device of many [[science fiction]] stories and films.

==Origins==
There is a long philosophical and scientific history to the underlying thesis that reality is an illusion. This [[skeptical hypothesis]] can be traced back to antiquity; for example, to the "[[Zhuangzi (book)#.22The Butterfly Dream.22|Butterfly Dream]]" of [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=You're living in a computer simulation, and math proves it|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/5799396/youre-living-in-a-computer-simulation-and-math-proves-it|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Indian philosophy of [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]].

==Simulation hypothesis==
[[File:Nick Bostrom.jpg|thumb|[[Nick Bostrom]] in 2014]]

{{quote|Many works of science fiction as well as some forecasts by serious technologists and futurologists predict that enormous amounts of computing power will be available in the future. Let us suppose for a moment that these predictions are correct. One thing that later generations might do with their super-powerful computers is run detailed simulations of their forebears or of people like their forebears. Because their computers would be so powerful, they could run a great many such simulations. Suppose that these simulated people are conscious (as they would be if the simulations were sufficiently fine-grained and if a certain quite widely accepted position in the philosophy of mind is correct). Then it could be the case that the vast majority of minds like ours do not belong to the original race but rather to people simulated by the advanced descendants of an original race. It is then possible to argue that, if this were the case, we would be rational to think that we are likely among the simulated minds rather than among the original biological ones. Therefore, if we don't think that we are currently living in a computer simulation, we are not entitled to believe that we will have descendants who will run lots of such simulations of their forebears.|Nick Bostrom, ''Are you living in a computer simulation?'', 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bostrom, Nick |journal=Philosophical Quarterly |date=2003 |volume=53 |issue=211 |pages=243–255 |url=http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html |title=Are You Living in a Computer Simulation?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ancestor simulation===
In 2003, philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] proposed a [[trilemma]] that he called "the simulation argument". Despite the name, Bostrom's "simulation argument" does not directly argue that we live in a simulation; instead, Bostrom's trilemma argues that one of three unlikely-seeming propositions is almost certainly true:
# "The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage (that is, one capable of running high-fidelity ancestor simulations) is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero", '''or'''
# "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one"
The trilemma points out that a technologically mature "posthuman" civilization would have enormous computing power; if even a tiny percentage of them were to run "ancestor simulations" (that is, "high-fidelity" simulations of ancestral life that would be indistinguishable from reality to the simulated ancestor), the total number of simulated ancestors, or "Sims", in the universe (or [[multiverse]], if it exists) would greatly exceed the total number of actual ancestors.

Bostrom goes on to use a type of [[Anthropic principle#Character of anthropic reasoning|anthropic reasoning]] to claim that, ''if'' the third proposition is the one of those three that is true, and almost all people with our kind of experiences live in simulations, ''then'' we are almost certainly living in a simulation.

Bostrom claims his argument goes beyond the classical ancient "[[skeptical hypothesis]]", claiming that "...we have interesting empirical reasons to believe that a certain [[logical disjunction|disjunctive]] claim about the world is true", the third of the three disjunctive propositions being that we are almost certainly living in a simulation. Thus, Bostrom, and writers in agreement with Bostrom such as [[David Chalmers]], argue there might be empirical reasons for the "simulation hypothesis", and that therefore the simulation hypothesis is not a skeptical hypothesis but rather a "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical hypothesis]]". Bostrom states he personally sees no strong argument for which of the three trilemma propositions is the true one: "If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion one's credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3)... I note that people who hear about the simulation argument often react by saying, 'Yes, I accept the argument, and it is obvious that it is possibility #''n'' that obtains.' But different people pick a different ''n''. Some think it obvious that (1) is true, others that (2) is true, yet others that (3) is true."

As a corollary to the trilemma, Bostrom states that "Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."&lt;!-- The entire trilemma section up to here is cited to: --&gt;&lt;ref name="Bostrom 2003"&gt;Bostrom, N., 2003, [http://www.simulation-argument.com/simulation.html Are You Living in a Simulation?], Philosophical Quarterly (2003), Vol. 53, No. 211, pp. 243-255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=faq&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/faq.html The Simulation Argument Website] FAQ&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bostrom&gt;[http://www.simulation-argument.com/matrix.html The Simulation Argument: Why the Probability that You Are Living in a Matrix is Quite High], [[Nick Bostrom]], Professor of Philosophy at [[Oxford University]], 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "M@M"&gt;Davis J. Chalmers [http://consc.net/papers/matrix.html The Matrix as Metaphysics] Dept of Philosophy, U. o Arizona; paper written for the philosophy section of ''[[The Matrix]]'' website.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Bostrom's anthropic reasoning===
{{further|Anthropic principle}}

Bostrom argues that, ''if'' "the fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one", ''then'' it follows that we probably live in a simulation. Some philosophers disagree, proposing that perhaps "Sims" do not have conscious experiences the same way that unsimulated humans do, or that it can otherwise be self-evident to a human that they are a human rather than a Sim.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Weatherson]]. "Are you a sim?" The Philosophical Quarterly 53.212 (2003): 425-431.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Barry Dainton modifies Bostrom's trilemma by substituting "neural ancestor simulations" (ranging from literal brains in a vat, to far-future humans with induced high-fidelity hallucinations that they are their own distant ancestors) for Bostrom's "ancestor simulations", on the grounds that every philosophical school of thought can agree that sufficiently high-tech neural ancestor simulation experiences would be indistinguishable from non-simulated experiences. Even if high-fidelity computer Sims are never conscious, Dainton's reasoning leads to the following conclusion: either the fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage and are able and willing to run large numbers of neural ancestor simulations is close to zero, or we are in some kind of (possibly neural) ancestor simulation.&lt;ref&gt;Dainton, Barry. "On singularities and simulations." Journal of Consciousness Studies 19.1 (2012): 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars categorically reject or are uninterested in anthropic reasoning, dismissing it as "merely philosophical", unfalsifiable, or inherently unscientific.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

Some critics reject the [[block universe]] view of time that Bostrom implicitly accepts and propose that we could be in the first generation, such that all the simulated people that will one day be created [[philosophical presentism|don't yet exist]].&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;

The cosmologist [[Sean M. Carroll]] argues that the simulation hypothesis leads to a contradiction: if a civilization is capable of performing simulations, then it will likely perform many simulations, which implies that we are most likely at the lowest level of simulation (from which point one's impression will be that it is impossible to perform a simulation), which contradicts the arguer's assumption that advanced civilizations can most likely perform simulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2016/08/22/maybe-we-do-not-live-in-a-simulation-the-resolution-conundrum/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments, within the trilemma, against the simulation hypothesis===
[[File:Molecular Dynamics Simulation of DPPC Lipid Bilayer.webm|thumb|Simulation down to molecular level of very small sample of matter]]
Some scholars accept the trilemma, and argue that the first or second of the propositions are true, and that the third proposition (the proposition that we live in a simulation) is false. Physicist [[Paul Davies]] deploys Bostrom's trilemma as part of one possible argument against a near-infinite [[multiverse]]. This argument runs as follows: if there were a near-infinite multiverse, there would be posthuman civilizations running ancestor simulations, and therefore we would come to the untenable and scientifically self-defeating conclusion that we live in a simulation; therefore, by ''[[reductio ad absurdum]]'', existing multiverse theories are likely false. (Unlike Bostrom and Chalmers, Davies (among others) considers the simulation hypothesis to be self-defeating.)&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Paul, Charles William. "Multiverse cosmological models." [[Modern Physics Letters A]] 19.10 (2004): 727-743.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some point out that there is currently no proof of technology which would facilitate the existence of sufficiently high-fidelity ancestor simulation. Additionally, there is no proof that it is physically possible or feasible for a posthuman civilization to create such a simulation, and therefore for the present, the first proposition must be true.&lt;ref name=faq /&gt;
Additionally there are proofs of [[limits of computation]].

==Consequences of living in a simulation==
Economist [[Robin Hanson]] argues a self-interested high-fidelity Sim should strive to be entertaining and praiseworthy in order to avoid being turned off or being shunted into a non-conscious low-fidelity part of the simulation. Hanson additionally speculates that someone who is aware that he might be a Sim might care less about others and live more for today: "your motivation to save for retirement, or to help the poor in Ethiopia, might be muted by realizing that in your simulation, you will never retire and there is no Ethiopia."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robin Hanson]]. "How to live in a simulation." Journal of Evolution and Technology 7.1 (2001).
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing the hypothesis physically==
A long-shot method to test one type of simulation hypothesis was proposed in 2012 in a joint paper by physicists Silas R. Beane from the University of Bonn (now at the University of Washington, Seattle), and Zohreh Davoudi and Martin J. Savage from the University of Washington, Seattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Beane |first= Silas |author2= Zohreh Davoudi |author3= Martin J. Savage |date= 9 November 2012 |title= Constraints on the Universe as a Numerical Simulation |arxiv= 1210.1847 |laysource= The Physics arXiv Blog  |laysummary= http://www.technologyreview.com/view/429561/the-measurement-that-would-reveal-the-universe-as-a-computer-simulation/ |laydate= October 10, 2012 |quote= ABSTRACT Observable consequences of the hypothesis that the observed universe is a numerical simulation performed on a cubic space-time lattice or grid are explored. The simulation scenario is first motivated by extrapolating current trends in computational resource requirements for lattice QCD into the future. Using the historical development of lattice gauge theory technology as a guide, we assume that our universe is an early numerical simulation with unimproved Wilson fermion discretization and investigate potentially-observable consequences. Among the observables that are considered are the muon g-2 and the current differences between determinations of alpha, but the most stringent bound on the inverse lattice spacing of the universe, ''b''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt; &gt;&amp;nbsp;~&amp;nbsp;10^&lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt; GeV, is derived from the high-energy cut off of the cosmic ray spectrum. The numerical simulation scenario could reveal itself in the distributions of the highest energy cosmic rays exhibiting a degree of rotational symmetry breaking that reflects the structure of the underlying lattice.|ref= |separator= |postscript= |bibcode= 2014EPJA...50..148B|doi= 10.1140/epja/i2014-14148-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the assumption of finite computational resources, the simulation of the universe would be performed by dividing the continuum space-time into a discrete set of points. In analogy with the mini-simulations that [[lattice gauge theory|lattice-gauge theorists]] run today to build up [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] from the underlying theory of [[strong interaction]]s (known as [[Quantum chromodynamics]]), several observational consequences of a grid-like space-time have been studied in their work. Among proposed signatures is an [[anisotropy]] in the distribution of ultra-high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s, that, if observed, would be consistent with the simulation hypothesis according to these physicists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/are-we-living-in-a-computer-simulation|title=Are We Living in a Computer Simulation?|first=Clara|last=Moskowitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multitude of physical observables must be explored before any such scenario could be accepted or rejected as a theory of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phys.washington.edu/users/savage/Simulation/Universe/|title=Physics Home|website=www.phys.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Campbell et al. propose several experiments aimed at testing the simulation theory in their ''On testing the simulation theory'' paper.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Campbell, Houman Owhadi, Joe Sauvageau, David Watkinson: ''On testing the simulation theory.'' {{arXiv|1703.00058}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 they started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the experiments, which reached $236,590, more than the required sum of $150,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/simulation/do-we-live-in-a-virtual-reality|title=Do we live in a Virtual Reality?|website=Kickstarter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses of the simulation hypothesis in philosophy==
Besides attempting to assess whether the simulation hypothesis is true or false, philosophers have also used it to illustrate other philosophical problems, especially in [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]. [[David Chalmers]] has argued that simulated beings might wonder whether their [[Mind|mental]] lives are governed by the [[physics]] of their environment, when in fact these mental lives are simulated separately (and are thus, in fact, not governed by the simulated physics).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://consc.net/notes/dualism.html|title=How Cartesian Dualism Might Have Been True|last=Chalmers|first=David|date=January 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They might eventually find that their thoughts fail to be physically [[causality|caused]].  Chalmers argues that this means that [[mind-body dualism|Cartesian dualism]] is not necessarily as problematic of a philosophical view as is commonly supposed, though he does not endorse it.

Similarly, Vincent Conitzer has used the following computer simulation scenarios to illuminate [[further facts]]—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts—about [[qualia]] (what it is ''like'' to have specific experiences), [[indexicality]] (what time it is ''now'' and who ''I'' am), and [[personal identity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Conitzer|first=Vincent|title=A Puzzle about Further Facts|journal=Erkenntnis|arxiv=1802.01161|doi=10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-018-9979-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imagine a person in the real world who is observing a simulated world on a screen, from the perspective of one of the simulated agents in it.  The person observing knows that besides the [[computer code|code]] responsible for the physics of the simulation, there must be ''additional'' code that determines in which colors the simulation is displayed on the screen, and which agent's perspective is displayed. (These questions are related to the [[inverted spectrum]] scenario and whether there are further facts about personal identity.)  That is, the person can conclude that the facts about the physics of the simulation (which are completely captured by the code governing the physics) do not fully determine her [[consciousness|experience]] by themselves.  But then, Conitzer argues, imagine someone who has become so engrossed in the simulation that she has ''forgotten'' that it is a simulation she is watching.  Could she not still reach the same conclusion?  And if so, can we not conclude the same in our own daily lives?

==In popular culture==

===Science fiction themes===
{{main|Simulated reality in fiction|Simulated consciousness (science fiction)}}
Science fiction has highlighted themes such as virtual reality, artificial intelligence and computer gaming for more than fifty years. ''[[Simulacron-3]]'' (1964) by [[Daniel F. Galouye]] (alternative title: ''Counterfeit World'') tells the story of a virtual city developed as a computer simulation for market research purposes, in which the simulated inhabitants possess consciousness; all but one of the inhabitants are unaware of the true nature of their world. The book was made into a German made-for-TV film called  [[World on a Wire|“World on a Wire”]] (1973) directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder. The movie ''[[The Thirteenth Floor]]'' (1999) was also loosely based on this book. "[[We Can Remember It for You Wholesale]]" is a short story by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' in April 1966, and was the basis for [[Total Recall (1990 film)|''Total Recall'' (1990 film)]] and [[Total Recall (2012 film)|''Total Recall'' (2012 film)]]. In ''[[Overdrawn at the Memory Bank]]'', a 1983 television movie, the main character pays to have his mind connected to a simulation. More recently, the same theme was repeated in the 1999 film ''[[The Matrix]]'', which depicted a world in which artificially intelligent robots enslaved humanity within a simulation set in the contemporary world. The 2012 play ''World of Wires'' was partially inspired by the Bostrom essay on the simulation hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2012/01/17/theater/reviews/world-of-wires-at-the-kitchen-review.html | work=The New York Times | first=Ben | last=Brantley | title=‘World of Wires' at the Kitchen — Review | date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the episode "[[Extremis (Doctor Who)|Extremis]]" (broadcast on 20 May 2017 on [[BBC One]]) of the science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', aliens called "The Monks" plan an invasion of Earth by running and studying a holographic simulation of Earth with conscious inhabitants. When the virtual Doctor finds out about the simulation he sends an email about the simulation to his real self so that the real Doctor can save the world. In the first season of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', a science-fiction animated comedy, the episode "[[M. Night Shaym-Aliens!]]" Aliens trap the lead role (Rick) in a simulated reality in order to trick him into revealing his formula for concentrated dark matter. In the game ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', it is revealed that the whole world of the gods Bionis and Mechonis was a simulation run by Alvis, the administrative computer of a phase transition experiment facility (heavily implied to be "Ontos" in Xenoblade Chronicles 2) after Klaus destroyed the universe in a multi-verse experiment. ''[[Simulation Theory (album)|Simulation Theory]]'' is also the name of the eighth album by British alternative band [[Muse (band)|Muse]], released on the 9th of November 2018.

{{Confucianism}}
The '''Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia''' ({{lang-id|Majelis Tinggi Agama Konghucu Indonesia}}, MATAKIN; HYPY: yìnní kǒngiào zǒnghuì; Chinese: 印尼孔教總會) is a [[Confucian church]] established in 1955 in [[Indonesia]], comprising the communities of practitioners of [[Confucianism]] mostly among [[Chinese Indonesians]]. Together with the Hong Kong [[Confucian Academy]] it is one of the two branches that formed after the dissolution of mainland China's Confucian Church founded by [[Kang Youwei]] in the early 20th century.

==History==
* In 1883, Boen Tjhiang Soe (Wen Chang Ci 文昌祠), after being rebuilt in 1906, became the ''Boen Bio'' (''Wen Miao'' 文廟 or ''Kong Miao'' 孔廟, "Temple of Culture" or "Temple of Confucius") at Jl. Kapasan No. 131 Surabaya. The colonial Dutch called it ''Geredja Boen Bio'' or ''Geredja Khonghoetjoe'', "Church of Confucius" (''de Kerk van Confucius''). At the present time it is a place of worship for Confucians in Surabaya.
* In 1886, the first book of Confucius History in Indo[[Indonesian language|nesian]], was published by [[Lie Kim Hok]].
* In 1897, the [[Four Books and Five Classics|Four Books]] were translated in Indonesian by Toean Njio Tjoen Ean and were published in [[Ambon, Maluku|Ambon]].
* In 1900, the translation and commentary of ''[[Great Learning]]'' (Id: ''Ajaran Besar'') and ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'' (Id: ''Tengah Sempurna'') were completed by Tan Ging Tiong.
* On March 17, 1900, led by the social activist Phoa Keng Hek Sia, twenty [[Chinese-Indonesian]] community leaders established Tiong Hoa Hwee Koan, a Confucianist social and educational organisation. It aimed to better the educational and social position of ethnic Chinese in the Dutch East Indies, and reform the practice of Confucianism in the Dutch colony.
* In 1918, the Confucian Council of Solo (Khong Kauw Hwee 孔教會) was legally founded.
* In 1923, a congress was held at Yogyakarta, Central Java, which established the ''Khong Kauw Tjong Hwee'' (孔教總會), the Central Assembly of Confucianism.
* On April 16, 1955 it was renamed the Supreme Council for the Confucian Religion in Indonesia; Majelis Tinggi Agama Khonghucu Indonesia: MATAKIN).

'''Thomas of Sutton'''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas de Sutton, Thomas de Suttona, Thomas de Sutona, Thomas de Suthona, Thomas Anglicus.&lt;/ref&gt; (died after 1315) was an English [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] theologian, an early [[Thomist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/gsas/phil/klima/TS.htm Gyula Klima, ''Thomas of Sutton on the Nature of the Intellective Soul and the Thomistic Theory of Being'']&lt;/ref&gt;

He was ordained as [[deacon]] in 1274 by [[Walter Giffard]], and joined the Dominicans in the 1270s; he may have been a Fellow of [[Merton College, Oxford]] before that. He became [[doctor of theology]] in 1282.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of the University of Oxford'' (1984), p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tranquillity''' (also spelled '''tranquility'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/tranquility&amp;r=67 Answers.com], retrieved on 12-16-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;) is the quality or state of being tranquil; that is, calm, serene, and worry-free. The word tranquillity appears in numerous texts ranging from the religious writings of Buddhism, where the term ''[[passaddhi]]'' refers to tranquillity of the body, thoughts and consciousness on the path to enlightenment, to an assortment of policy and planning guidance documents, where interpretation of the word is typically linked to engagement with the [[natural environment]].

==Benefits==
[[psychology|Psychological]] being in a tranquil or ‘restorative’ environment allows individuals to take respite from the periods of sustained ‘directed attention’ that characterise modern living. In developing their [[Attention Restoration Theory]] (ART), Kaplan and Kaplan&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan R. and Kaplan, S. (1989). The Experience of Nature. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed that recovery from cognitive overload could most effectively be achieved by engaging with natural restorative environments, that are away from daily distractions and have the extent and mystery that allows the imagination to wander, thereby enabling individuals to engage effortlessly with their surroundings. The theory works on the principle that the amount of reflection possible within such an environment depends upon the type of cognitive engagement, i.e. fascination; that the environment holds. ‘Soft fascination’ is deemed to occur when there is enough interest in the surroundings to hold attention but not so much that it compromises the ability to reflect. In essence, soft fascination, which has been taken by Herzog&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Bosley, P. J. (1992). Tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Journal of Environmental Psychology 12, 115-127.&lt;/ref&gt; and Pheasant&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Pheasant, Mark N. Fisher, Greg R. Watts, David J. Whitaker and Kirill V. Horoshenkov. (2010). The importance of auditory-visual interaction in the construction of tranquil space. Journal of Environmental Psychology 30, 501 -509.&lt;/ref&gt; as a reasonable term to describe tranquillity, provides a pleasing level of sensory input that involves no cognitive effort other than removing oneself from an overcrowded mental space.

===Enjoyment===
For many, the chance to experience tranquillity is what makes the countryside different from cities. In a survey by the [[United Kingdom Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) 58% of people said that tranquillity was the most positive feature of the countryside.

===Health===
In contrast to ‘soft fascination’, ‘directed attention’ requires a significant amount of cognitive effort and it is known that prolonged periods of sustained mental activity can lead to directed attention fatigue. This condition has the potential to significantly affect performance and bring about negative emotions, irritability and decreased sensitivity to interpersonal cues.&lt;ref&gt;Hartig, T., Kaiser, F. G. &amp; Bowler, P. A. (1997). Further development of a measure of perceived environmental restorativeness. Working paper 5, Institute for Housing Research, Uppsala University, Sweden.&lt;/ref&gt; As the incidence of mental illness continues to rise,&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B., Lindvall, T and Schwela, D. H. (1999). World Health Organisation guidelines for community noise.&lt;/ref&gt; there is growing evidence that exposure to natural environments can make a significant contribution to health and [[wellbeing]]. Mounting evidence shows, that exposure to nature contributes to physical and psychological wellbeing, such as the review carried out by Louv,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Louv. (2008). Last Child in the Woods: Saving our Children from Nature Deficit Disorder. Algonquin Press&lt;/ref&gt; that found evidence of ‘nature-deficit-disorder’ in children, which suggests that the importance of being able to engage with restorative environments applies across a wide age range. 
Others report that natural tranquil surroundings have profound physiological effects on people suffering from [[Stress (biology)|stress]]. For example, Ullrich&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Ulrich, F. Simons, B.

===Economic===
Since seeking tranquillity is an important reason why many people visit the countryside, the presence of tranquil areas helps boost rural tourism. Since rural tourism in the UK directly supports 380,000 jobs and £13.8 billion annually to the economy, and a recent survey showed that tranquillity is the main reason why 49% of visitors go are attracted to the countryside, one can conclude that tranquillity is worth 186,200 jobs and £6.76 billion a year to the economy.{{Ref|rural}}

==Tranquillity research==
Natural settings that effortlessly engage our attention are typically associated with soft fascination and with the analysis of tranquillity and preference published by Herzog and Bosely (1992). In this study, the authors attempted to distinguish empirically between the constructs of tranquillity and preference as affective qualities of natural environments. Motivated by ART, from which they took tranquillity as a reasonable term to describe soft fascination, they produced definitions for each component. Tranquillity they defined as "how much you think this setting is a quiet, peaceful place, a good place to get away from everyday life", and preference as "how much you like this setting for whatever reason".
Subjects were asked to score the following visual settings: mountains, deserts, fields / forests and waterscapes against the two target variables, tranquillity and preference, and four descriptor variables: mistiness, unstructured openness, focus and surface calmness. Tranquillity and preference were positively correlated across all settings with tranquillity scoring higher ratings in the field / forest, waterscape and mountain categories, whilst rushing water had the highest rating in the preference category.
Analysis of the results identified three physical features that help explain the apparent split between tranquillity and preference. These were; mistiness, unstructured openness; which refers to how open the scene is and how difficult it is to establish a sense of depth or distance, and surface calmness. Mistiness and unstructured openness tended to depress preference relative to tranquillity whilst surface calmness tended to enhance it. Herzog and Barnes&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. &amp; Barnes, G. J. (1999). Tranquillity and preference revisited. Journal of Environmental Psychology 19, 171-18.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted a follow up study in which deserts and waterscapes were included in the setting types. In 2000, Herzog and Chernick&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, T. R. and Chernick, K. K. (2000). Tranquility and Danger in Urban and Natural Settings. Journal of Environmental Psychology, 20, 29-39.&lt;/ref&gt; conducted further research into the tranquillity construct when they investigated the relationship between tranquillity and danger in urban and rural settings.
The key results that emerged from this research were that ‘setting care’, which relates to how safe we feel in a particular setting, is more salient for judgments of danger in urban settings than natural ones and that openness was a significant predictor of danger but not of tranquillity. The authors concluded therefore that tranquillity and danger should not simply be viewed as polar opposites, but like preference and tranquillity as distinct constructs.

===The role of audio-visual interaction within the tranquillity construct===

Within tranquillity studies, much of the emphasis has been placed on understanding the role of vision in the [[perception]] of natural environments, which is probably not surprising, considering that upon first viewing a scene its configurational coherence can be established with incredible speed. Indeed, scene information can be captured in a single glance&lt;ref&gt;Oliva, A. &amp; Torralba, A. (2006). Building the gist of a scene: The role of global image features and recognition. Progress in Brain Research 155 (2), 23 – 36.&lt;/ref&gt; and the gist of a scene determined in as little as 100ms.&lt;ref&gt;Dobel, C. &amp; Gumnoir, H. (2006). Describing scenes hardly seen. Acta Psychologica 125, 129 – 143.&lt;/ref&gt; The speed of processing of complex natural images was tested by Thorpe ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, S., Fize, D. &amp; Marlot, C. (1996). Speed of processing in the human visual system. Nature 381, 520 – 522.&lt;/ref&gt; using colour photographs of a wide range of animals (mammals, birds, reptiles and fish), in their natural environments, mixed with distracters that included pictures of forests, mountains, lakes, buildings and fruit. During this experiment, subjects were shown an image for 20ms and asked to determine whether it contained an animal or not. The electrophysiological brain responses obtained in this study showed that a decision could be made within 150ms of the image being seen, indicating the speed at which cognitive visual processing occurs.
However, audition, and in particular the individual components that collectively comprise the [[soundscape]], a term coined by Schafer&lt;ref&gt;Schafer, R. M. (1977). The Soundscape: Our sonic environment and the tuning of the world. Destiny Books Rochester, Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the ever-present array of sounds that constitute the sonic environment, also significantly inform the various schemata used to characterise differing landscape types. This interpretation is supported by the auditory reaction times, which are 50 to 60ms faster than that of the visual modality.&lt;ref&gt;Jaśkowski, P., Jaroszyk, F., &amp; Hojan-Jezierska, D. (1990). Temporal-order judgement and reaction time for stimuli of different modalities. Psychol Research  52, 35-38.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that sound can alter visual perception&lt;ref&gt;Shams, L., Kanutani, S. &amp; Shimojo, S. (2002). Visual illusion induced by sound. Journal of Cognitive Brain Research 14, 147 – 152.&lt;/ref&gt; and that under certain conditions areas of the brain involved in processing auditory information can be activated in response to visual stimuli. 
Research conducted by Pheasant ''et al.'' has shown that when individuals make tranquillity assessments based on a uni-modal auditory or visual sensory input, they characterise the environment by drawing upon a number of key landscape and soundscape characteristics. For example, when making assessments in response to visual-only stimuli the percentage of water, flora and geological features present within a scene, positively influence how tranquil a location is perceived to be. Likewise when responding to uni-modal auditory stimuli, the perceived loudness of biological sounds positively influences the perception of tranquillity, whilst the perceived loudness of mechanical sounds have a negative effect. However, when presented with bi-modal auditory-visual stimuli the individual soundscape and landscape components alone no longer influenced the perception of tranquillity. Rather configurational coherence was provided by the percentage of natural and contextual features present within the scene and the equivalent continuous sound pressure level (LAeq).

===Predicting tranquillity===

Researchers at the Bradford Centre for Sustainable Environments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk/|title=Please wait while you are being redirected|website=www.sustainable-environments.brad.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; have developed a methodology by which the perceived tranquillity rating (TR) of an amenity area such as park, green or urban square can be measured, on a 0 - 10 scale.&lt;ref&gt;Robert J Pheasant, Kirill V Horoshenkov and Greg R Watts. Tranquillity Rating prediction tool (TRAPT). Institute of Acoustics – Acoustics Bulletin, 35 (6), November/December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., K. V. Horoshenkov., G. R. Watts and B. T. Barrett. (2008). The acoustic and visual factors influencing the construction of tranquil space in urban and rural environments: Tranquil Spaces - Quiet places? J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 123(3), 1446-1457.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. J. Pheasant., G. R. Watts. and K. V. Horoshenkov. (2009). Validation of a tranquillity rating prediction tool, J. ACTA Acustica United with Acustica. 95(6), 1024-1031.&lt;/ref&gt; The method involves the assessment of average daytime noise levels Lday (usually traffic noise) and the measurement of the percentage of natural and contextual features NCF contained within the visual scene. The latter includes the percentage area in the visual scene occupied by natural features in the landscape such as vegetation, water and geological features, e.g. exposed rock outcrops, and contextual features. These contextual elements include listed buildings, religious and historic buildings, landmarks, monuments and elements of the landscape, such as traditional farm buildings, that directly contribute to the visual context of the natural environment. Lastly, the equation includes moderating factors (MF) that can influence the perception of tranquillity in either a positive, or a negative way. 
	
TR = 9.68 + 0.041 NCF – 0.146 Lday + MF 		

These moderating factors are not expected to be large and because they are relatively difficult to quantify they are the subject of ongoing research. One potentially effective solution to improving tranquillity, is to mask traffic noise or distract attention with an attractive water sound. A previous experiment has demonstrated that water generated sounds have the potential to improve the perceived tranquillity of gardens blighted by noise.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant, K. V. Horoshenkov and L. Ragonesi. (2009). Measurement and subjective assessment of water generated sounds. Acta Acustica united with Acustica, 95, 1032-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  A further study has demonstrated that litter has the potential to degrade an environment such that the tranquillity rating drops on average by one scale point.&lt;ref&gt;G. R. Watts, R. J. Pheasant and K. V. Horoshenkov. Validation of tranquillity rating method, Proceedings of the Institute of Acoustics &amp; Belgium Acoustical Society, Noise in the Built Environment, Ghent, 29–30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

This bi-modal relationship is supported by work recently carried out by SCANLab at the University of Sheffield, using [[fMRI]] neuro-imaging techniques.&lt;ref&gt;M.D.Hunter., S. B. Eickhoff., R. J. Pheasant., M. J. Douglas., G. R. Watts., T. F. D. Farrow., D. Hyland., J. Kang., I. D. Wilkinson., K. V. Horoshenkov and P. W. R. Woodruff. (2010). The state of tranquillity: Subjective perception is shaped by contextual modulation of auditory connectivity. NeuroImage 53(2), 611 – 18.&lt;/ref&gt; This study demonstrated for the first time the significant differences in effective connectivity between areas of the brain, namely the auditory cortex and the medial [[pre-frontal cortex]], under tranquil and non-tranquil conditions. Specifically the medial pre-frontal cortex receives significantly enhanced contributions from the [[auditory cortex]] when presented with a tranquil visual scene compared with non-tranquil visual stimuli.

===Mapping tranquillity===
[[Image:CPRE England tranquillity map.jpg|frame|right|2007 Tranquillity map of England. Green areas denote very tranquil areas, whereas red areas denote areas with much less tranquillity.]]

The first method of mapping tranquillity was developed by Simon Rendel of ASH Consulting for a [[Department of Transport]] study in 1991. This led to the production of a set of Tranquil Area maps covering England, produced by Rendel and ASH Consulting and published by the [[Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE)]] and the former [[Countryside Commission]].

In these maps ''tranquil areas'' were defined as ''places sufficiently far from the visual or noise intrusion of development or traffic to be considered unspoilt by urban influences''.

More sophisticated mapping techniques are now available following work by researchers at [[Northumbria University]], [[Newcastle University]], and [[Campaign to Protect Rural England|CPRE]].

Maps have been produced for the whole of [[England]] that show the tranquillity score of [[Ordnance Survey]] Grid derived 500mx500m squares. The tranquillity rating for these is based on 44 different factors that add to or detract from people’s feelings of tranquillity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.surrey.ac.uk/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/ENG/RESEARCH/CES/EVENTS/ABSTRACTSANDPPTS/MAPPING%20TRANQUILLITY%20ANDREW%20OLIVER%202007.PDF] Presentation given by Andrew Oliver on Tranquillity to the University of Surrey, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These factors were defined following extensive public consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013142009/https://www.cpre.org.uk/filegrab/saving-tranquil-places-report.pdf?ref=2583 |archivedate=2007-10-13 |df= }} ''Saving Tranquil Places'', CPRE report on Tranquillity, retrieved 2 Nov 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The new methodology uses advanced modelling techniques to look at the diffusion of the impact of these factors over distance, taking into account the terrain of the land. For example, the tranquillity increases gradually the further one is from a busy road, but increases more sharply if the road is hidden in a cutting.

The mapping process was developed by Northumbria and Newcastle Universities. The dark green areas represent those with the highest composite tranquillity score; dark red areas have the lowest composite tranquillity score (i.e., are least tranquil).

===Stimuli with positive impacts on tranquillity===
*a natural landscape, including woodland
*presence of rivers, streams, lakes or the sea
*birds and other wildlife
*wide open spaces
*clear open night sky with/without moon
*beach in a unique location
*open field,flora etc. with gentle to moderate wind flow

===Examples of stimuli having negative impacts on tranquillity===
*Motorised [[transport]]: [[car]]s, [[motorbikes|motorcycle]], [[train]]s and [[aircraft]] – and [[road]]s and [[railway]]s
*[[light pollution]]
*[[crowd|large numbers]] of people
*[[Electricity pylon|pylon]]s, [[electric power transmission|power line]]s, masts and [[wind turbine]]s
*[[Noise (sound)|noise]]

Note: This cartographic study showed that tranquillity is not the absence of all noise, activity and buildings. Indeed, it found that many rural activities, such as farming and hiking, and natural noises such as birdsong and cows lowing, enhance people’s experience of tranquillity.

'''Transformed cladistics''', also known as '''pattern cladistics''' is an epistemological approach to the [[cladistic]] method of phylogenetic inference and classification that makes no a priori assumptions about [[common ancestry]].  It was advocated by [[Norman Platnick]], [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]], Ronald Brady and others in the 1980s, but has few modern proponents.  The book, ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, D. M. and M. C. Ebach. 2008. ''Foundations of Systematics and Biogeography''. Springer Science+Business Media, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; by David Williams and Malte Ebach provides a thoughtful history of the origins of this point of view.

==Patterns vs. processes==

The traditional approach to cladistics, which traces back to [[Willi Hennig]] &lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1950. Grundzüge einer Theorie der phylogenetischen Systematik. Deutscher Zentralverlag, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hennig, W. 1966. Phylogenetic systematics. University of Illinois Press, Urbana, IL.
&lt;/ref&gt;, groups together organisms based on whether or not they share derived characters or character states that are assumed to be descended from a common ancestor. Transformed cladists maintain that the assumption of [[common descent]] is uninformative and/or potentially misleading, and that therefore cladistic methods should be free from evolutionary process assumptions, and based only on [[Occam's razor|parsimonious]] interpretation of empirical data: 

{{Quote|"If classifications (that is, our knowledge of patterns) are ever to provide an adequate test of theories of evolutionary processes their construction must be independent of any particular theory of process." (Platnick, 1979)&lt;ref&gt;Platnick, N. I. (1979). "Philosophy and the transformation of cladistics". ''Systematic Zoology''. 28: 537–546.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, pattern cladists argue that the fewer evolutionary assumptions a classification presupposes, the fewer errors creep in, and greater transparency results. They draw a distinction between patterns, which are observed, and processes, which may be inferred from patterns, but which should not be presupposed. Before the emergence of cladistics as a school, [[Joseph Henry Woodger]] criticized phylogenetic systematics on the grounds that homology by way of common ancestry is "putting the cart before the horse, because descent from a common ancestor is something assumed, not observed. It belongs to theory, whereas morphological correspondence is observed." &lt;ref&gt;Woodger, S. (1945). “On Biological Transformations”. In: ''Essays on Growth and Form''. Le Gros Clark, W. E., Medawar, P. B (eds.). Oxford: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Colin Patterson]] later wrote similarly:

{{Quote|"We must remember the distinction between the cart--the explanation--and the horse--the data. And where models are introduced in phylogenetic reconstruction, we should prefer models dictated by features of the data to models derived from explanatory theories." &lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. (1994). "Null or minimal models". In: ''Models In Phylogeny Reconstruction''. Scotland, R. W. , Siebert, D. J. (eds.). Systematics Association Special Volume; 173-192.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pattern cladists, like traditional cladists, think that classifications should be isomorphic to cladograms, recognizing groups based on nested patterns of [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]], but they argue that the discovery of characters is not dependent on apriori considerations about common ancestry:

{{Quote|"[T]o state a cladogram is a synapomorphy scheme invites the rejoinder that a cladogram must, therefore be a phyletic concept. Not so, for by ‘synapomorphy’ we mean ‘defining character’ of an inclusive taxon." &lt;ref&gt;Nelson, G. J., Platnick, N. I. (1981). ''Systematics and biogeography: cladistics and vicariance'' (Vol. 214). New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nelson &amp; Platnick (1981) also noted that: "''all'' of Hennig’s groups correspond by definition to patterns of synapomorphy. Indeed, Hennig’s trees are frequently called synapomorphy schemes. The concept of ‘patterns within patterns’ seems, therefore, an empirical generalization.” Pattern cladists hence regard synapomorphies to be patterns free of processes.

==Criticism==
A frequent (but false) accusation against pattern cladistics is that its proponents claim that systematics should be "theory free."  At some point in the 1960s and '70s [[Phenetics|pheneticists]] may have believed that, but pattern cladists are not pheneticists.  Obviously, rejecting a priori evolutionary process theories is not the same thing as categorically rejecting "theory" in toto.  Furthermore, pattern cladists do not reject post hoc evolutionary explanations for cladograms, they simply think that the evidence is independent of the explanation &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Nevertheless, some philosophers with a background conciliatory towards [[evolutionary taxonomy]] continue to offer criticisms in this vein:
{{Quote|"Pattern cladistics has remained on the fringe because of, first, its implausible assumption that there can be pure observation untainted by theory; and second, its rejection of the evolution assumption. Few systematists now think that a classification not based on evolutionary branching and history has any real signification or justification. The developing consensus is that Darwin was right – a natural classification must be genealogical."&lt;ref&gt;Ruse, M. (2008). ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Biology''. Oxford University Press. 171-172.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Of course, the distinction between the phenomenon and its explanation was clear to Darwin:  "the grand fact in natural history of the subordination of group under group, which from its familiarity, does not always sufficiently strike us, is in my judgment fully explained." &lt;ref&gt;Darwin, C. 1859. On the Origin of Species. John Murray, London, p. 413.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brady &lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1982). "Theoretical Issues and 'Pattern Cladistics'". ''Systematic Zoology''. 3. 286-291.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brady, R. H. (1985). "On the independence of systematics". ''Cladistics''. 1: 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the terms ''explanandum'' for empirical patterns (the phenomenon to be explained) and ''explanans'' for process theory (the explanation), writing: "by making our explanation into the definition of the condition [data] to be explained, we express not scientific hypothesis but belief".  In the above quote, Darwin's "fact" is the ''explanandum''; his theory of descent with modification is the ''explanans''.

In this view, whatever the characters imply as the preferred hypothesis of relationships becomes, de facto, "genealogical" when we explain it as a result of evolution. &lt;ref&gt;Brower, A. V. Z. 2002. Cladistics, phylogeny, evidence and explanation - a reply to Lee. Zool. Scripta 31:221-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creationist distortion==

As noted, transformed cladistics does not deny [[common ancestry]], rather it argues a logical precedence: theories regarding processes should only be formulated after patterns are discovered.  Creationists have distorted this to argue that there are pattern cladists who are skeptical about whether evolution occurs. 

===Colin Patterson===

In November, 1981, [[Colin Patterson (biologist)|Patterson]] delivered a seminar to the Systematics Discussion Group in the American Museum of Natural History&lt;ref&gt;Patterson, C. 2002. Systematics and creationism. The Linnean 18:13-37.
&lt;/ref&gt;. In the talk, Patterson asked provocatively: "Can you tell me anything about evolution, any one thing that is true?", and remarked:

{{Quote|"As I understand it, cladistics is theoretically neutral so far as evolution is concerned. It has nothing to say about evolution. You don’t need to know about evolution, or believe in it, to do cladistic analysis. All that cladistics demands is that groups have characters."}}

A [[creationist]] in the audience taped segments of Patterson's talk to imply he was "agnostic" on the subject of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution Colin Patterson: Evolution, Reports of the National Center for Science Education]&lt;/ref&gt; To his dismay, Patterson soon found his name quoted in creationist publications:

{{Quote|"I was too naive and foolish to guess what might happen: the talk was taped by a creationist who passed the tape to Luther Sunderland [...] Since, in my view, the tape was obtained unethically, I asked Sunderland to stop circulating the transcipt, but of course to no effect.  There is not much point in my going through the article point by point. I was putting a case for discussion, as I thought off the record, and was speaking only about systematics, a specialized field. I do not support the creationist movement in any way, and in particular I am opposed to their efforts to modify school curricula. In short the article does not fairly represent my views.  But even if it did, so what?  The issue should be resolved by rational discussion, and not by quoting 'authorities,' which seems to be the creationists' principal mode of argument."  (Letter from Colin Patterson to Steven W. Binkley, June 17, 1982)}}

{{Quote|"Unfortunately, and unknown to me, there was a creationist in my audience with a hidden tape recorder. A transcript of my talk was produced and circulated among creationists, and the talk has since been widely, and often inaccurately, quoted in creationist literature." (Patterson, 1994)}}  (Note that a transcript of Patterson's talk has been published in the Linnean 18(2),and may be [https://www.linnean.org/our-publications/the-linnean/the-linnean-back-issues-2001-2010 downloaded] from the Linnean Society).

{{Quote|text="Because creationists lack scientific research to support such theories as a young earth ... a world-wide flood ... or separate ancestry for humans and apes, their common tactic is to attack evolution by hunting out debate or dissent among evolutionary biologists. ... I learned that one should think carefully about candour in argument (in publications, lectures, or correspondence) in case one was furnishing creationist campaigners with ammunition in the form of 'quotable quotes', often taken out of context."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bartelt |first=Karen |date=May–June 2000 |title=Review: Evolution |url=http://ncse.com/rncse/20/3/evolution |journal=Reports of the National Center for Science Education |type=Book review |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=38–39 |issn=2158-818X |accessdate=2015-05-21}} Bartelt quoting from Patterson, ''Evolution'' (1999), p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''tritone paradox''' is an [[auditory illusion]] in which a sequentially played pair of [[Shepard tone]]s&lt;ref&gt;R. N. Shepard. Circularity in judgments of relative pitch. Journal of the Acoustical Society of America, 36(12):2346–2353, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;  separated by an [[interval (music)|interval]] of a [[tritone]], or half octave, is heard as ascending by some people and as descending by others.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, D. A musical paradox. Music Perception, 3:275–280, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations tend to favor one of a limited set of different spots around the [[chromatic circle]] as central to the set of "higher" tones. Roger Shepard in 1963 had argued that such tone pairs would be heard ambiguously as either ascending or descending. However, [[music psychology|psychology of music]] researcher [[Diana Deutsch]] in 1986 discovered that when the judgments of individual listeners were considered separately, their judgments depended  on the positions of the tones along the  [[chromatic circle]]. For example, one listener would hear the tone pair C–F{{music|sharp}} as ascending and the tone pair G–C{{music|sharp}} as descending. Yet another listener would hear the tone pair C–F{{music|sharp}} as descending and the tone pair G–C{{music|sharp}} as ascending. Furthermore, the way these tone pairs were perceived varied depending on the listener's language or dialect.

Each Shepard tone consists of a set of octave-related sinusoids, whose amplitudes are scaled by a fixed bell-shaped spectral envelope based on a log frequency scale. For example, one tone might consist of a sinusoid at 440&amp;nbsp;Hz, accompanied by sinusoid at the higher octaves (880&amp;nbsp;Hz, 1760&amp;nbsp;Hz, etc.) and lower octaves (220&amp;nbsp;Hz, 110&amp;nbsp;Hz, etc.). The other tone might consist of a 311&amp;nbsp;Hz sinusoid, again accompanied by higher and lower octaves (622&amp;nbsp;Hz, 155.5&amp;nbsp;Hz, etc.). The amplitudes of the sinusoids of both complexes are determined by the same fixed-amplitude envelope&amp;mdash;for example, the envelope might be centered at 370&amp;nbsp;Hz and span a six-octave range.

Shepard predicted that the two tones would constitute a bistable figure, the auditory equivalent of the [[Necker cube]], that could be heard ascending or descending, but never both at the same time. Diana Deutsch later found that perception of which tone was higher depended on the absolute frequencies involved: an individual will usually find the same tone to be higher, and this is determined by the tones' absolute pitches. This is consistently done by a large portion of the population, despite the fact that responding to different tones in different ways must involve the ability to hear [[absolute pitch]], which was thought to be extremely rare. This finding has been used to argue that latent absolute-pitch ability is present in a large proportion of the population.  In addition, Deutsch found that subjects from the south of England and from California resolved the ambiguity the opposite way.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, D. The tritone paradox: An influence of language on music perception. Music Perception, 8:335–347, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Deutsch, Henthorn and Dolson found that native speakers of [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal]] language, heard the tritone paradox differently from Californians who were native speakers of English.&lt;ref&gt;Deutsch, D., Henthorn T. and Dolson, M. Speech patterns heard early in life influence later perception of the tritone paradox. Music Perception, 21:357–372, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen''', born 1942, professor at [[Uppsala University]], Department of Mathematics, is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mathematician]]/[[logician]] and expert on [[domain theory]] and [[recursion theory]] (also known as [[computability theory]]). Viggo received his PhD in Mathematics (titled "On Priority Arguments In Friedberg Theories") from [[University of Toronto]] in 1973, supervised by [[Douglas Clarke]].

==Work on domain theory==

Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen and [[John V. Tucker|John Tucker]] developed in the early 1980s a general method of [[Domain theory|domain]] representations of topological algebras.

Viggo is the main author of the textbook "Mathematical Theory of Domains", Cambridge University Press, 1994 (coauthored by I. Lindström and E. Griffor), and also of a set of [[Marktoberdorf]] summer school lecture notes on domain theory.

==Work on effective domains==

Viggo Stoltenberg-Hansen and John Tucker made a thorough analysis of the computability associated to ''effective algebras''  and continuity of [[homomorphisms]] between such.

[[File:Walter Carnielli.jpg|thumb|Walter Carnielli in Berkeley in 1984]]
'''Walter Alexandre Carnielli''' (born 11 January 1952 in [[Campinas]], [[Brazil]]) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[philosopher]], full professor of Logic at the [http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/ State University of Campinas (UNICAMP)]. With a Bachelor and a Ms.C. degree in mathematics at the [http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/ State University of Campinas ] in [[Campinas]] he obtained his Ph.D. in 1984 in the same university under the supervision of [[Newton da Costa]] and subsequently stayed as a PostDoc at  the [[University of California at Berkeley]] as a Research Fellow, following an invitation  by [[Leon Henkin]].

== Areas of interest ==

=== Many-valued logic and paraconsistent logic ===

Carnielli contributed to the [[proof theory]] and [[semantics]] of [[many-valued logic]]s and [[paraconsistent logic]]s. His tableau method for many-valued logics generalized all previous treatments of the subject [W. A. Carnielli. Systematization of the finite many-valued logics through the method of tableaux. The Journal of Symbolic Logic 52
(2), 1987, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–493]. His proposal of the possible-translations semantics (a new semantical interpretation for paraconsistent logics) contributed to a revival in the philosophial interpretation of paraconsistent logics [[W. A. Carnielli. Possible-translations semantics for paraconsistent logics. In: Frontiers in Paraconsistent Logic: Proceedings of the I World Congress on Paraconsistency, Ghent,
1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–72 , edited by D. Batens et al., Kings College
Publications, 2000]], [W. A. Carnielli (with M. E. Coniglio and J. Marcos). Logics of Formal Inconsistency. In: Handbook of Philosophical Logic, vol. 14, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–107. Eds.: D. Gabbay; F. Guenthner. Springer, 2007].

The logics of formal inconsistency which systematize a large class of paraconsistent logics opened the way to the application of paraconsistency to computer science and to new philosophical investigations on paraconsistency.

===Combinatorics, modulated logics, and combinations of logics===

He also published on finite and infinite [[combinatorics]], and developed (with his collaborators A. M. Sette and P. A. Veloso) the modulated logics, a new kind of logics which allows the formalization of qualitative reasoning by means of special generalized quantifiers. His research also includes [[model theory]], non-classical logics and  foundations of [[Quantum computer|quantum computation]]  and combinations of logics.

== Positions and awards ==
Carnielli served as a Director for  the Centre for Logic, Epistemology and the History of Science at UNICAMP for three terms,  and served as President of the Brazilian Logic Society. He  was  distinguished with an Alexander von Humboldt Grant for long term research stays in Germany, and served as en editor and/or a member of editorial boards of major journals, such as Studia Logica, Logic and Logical Philosophy,  [http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/672712/description#description Journal of Applied Logic],
CLE e-Prints, Reports on Mathematical Logic and ''[[Journal of Applied Non-Classical Logics]]''.  He is a recipient  of the Telesio-Galilei Gold Medal Award 2012 in Philosophy and Mathematics.
