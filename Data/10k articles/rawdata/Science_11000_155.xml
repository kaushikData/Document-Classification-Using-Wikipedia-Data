'''AKTIP – Konzultační a terapeutický institut Praha''' (The Consultation and Therapeutic Institute Prague) is a private institute run by the public business company Progressive consulting, offering services in the field of psychosomatic care.&lt;ref name="group" /&gt; The head of the institute is psychiatrist Jarmila Klímová.&lt;ref name="kontakty" /&gt;

Controversy about the methods of the institute emerges&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; when the documentary Infiltrace: Obchod se zdravím (Infiltration: Health Business) was broadcast by Czech television on May 21, 2018.
The documentary revealed that the company uses unethical techniques to the detriment of its patients for its financial gain, including [[pseudoscience]], manipulation, and incitement of fear of cancer and anxiety. AKTIP offers examinations and healing by instrumentation&lt;ref name="ans" /&gt; and [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] preparations of doubtful effectiveness for various somatic diseases, including [[thyroid disease]].&lt;ref name="CT" /&gt;
Although it has physicians on staff, this institution is not a legitimate provider of health services. It is not a medical facility.&lt;ref name="law" /&gt;

== Erratic Boulder award in the category of teams 2016 ==
AKTIP is the holder of the Silver Erratic Boulder award in the category of teams for 2016.
''“An eventual client meets here imaginary care in a wide range of disciplines. His complex problems will be treated by a [[graphology|graphologist]], an expert in oriental diagnostics and bioresonance therapy will also supply its part of information. If it fails, a miraculous ANESA device, known as the non-invasive AMP blood analyzer (Golden Erratic Boulder award for 2011), will come to the scene”'', said [[Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos|Sisyfos]].&lt;ref name="sisyfos" /&gt;

In the awards report its representatives also cite the statement of the head of AKTIP Jarmila Klímová that the human body is set for 400 years of life. ''“If we really lived only by biological hours, we could be at rest between 380 and 460 years, because this age is set up for our body ... And why do we live only 60 or 80 years? No, because the most important influence outside of ourselves, which fundamentally affects the length and quality of life, we do not accept.”''&lt;ref name="e15" /&gt;

== Professional public response ==
The practices of AKTIP was already criticized by the Czech Oncological Society in 2014.&lt;ref name="otazky" /&gt;
Procedures used by AKTIP employees have been critically evaluated by doctors&lt;ref name="CT" /&gt; (f.ex. by cardiologist Věra Adámková) The psychologist Petr Weiss described AKTIP's practices as charlatan fabrications, fraud, and money-pulling activities.&lt;ref name="rozhlas" /&gt;

According to the President of the Czech Medical Chamber Milan Kubka, AKTIP's position in the future could be solved by a law on healers that would force "all such charlatan institutions" to mandatory registration. ''“This institution only looks like a medical facility, and that's a scam from my point of view.”''&lt;ref name="lidovky" /&gt;

[[Český klub skeptiků Sisyfos|Sisyfos]], in response to the AKTIP case, has published an article analyzing the principles of some devices used by individual "consultants" of AKTIP. This article also expresses concern that AKTIP is not an exceptional case, but that it is a fairly common phenomenon among institutions that provide services of alternative medicine.&lt;ref name="sramek" /&gt;

The '''Aharonov–Bohm effect''', sometimes called the '''Ehrenberg–Siday–Aharonov–Bohm''' effect, is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon in which an [[electric charge|electrically charged]] [[point particle|particle]] is affected by an [[electromagnetic potential]] ('''V''', '''A'''), despite being confined to a region in which both the [[magnetic field]] '''B''' and [[electric field]] '''E''' are zero.&lt;ref name="Significance of electromagnetic potentials in quantum theory"&gt;

|bibcode = 1959PhRv..115..485A }}&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying mechanism is the [[coupling (physics)|coupling]] of the [[electromagnetic potential]] with the [[Argument (complex analysis)|complex phase]] of a charged particle's [[wave function]], and the Aharonov–Bohm effect is accordingly illustrated by [[double-slit experiment|interference experiments]].

The most commonly described case, sometimes called the '''Aharonov–Bohm solenoid effect''', takes place when the wave function of a charged particle passing around a long [[solenoid]] experiences a [[Phase (waves)|phase shift]] as a result of the enclosed magnetic field, despite the magnetic field being negligible in the region through which the particle passes and the particle's wavefunction being negligible inside the solenoid. This phase shift has been observed experimentally.&lt;ref name="The Aharonov–Bohm effects: Variations on a Subtle Theme."&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. |last=Batelaan |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=A. |last2=Tonomura |title=The Aharonov–Bohm effects: Variations on a Subtle Theme |journal=Physics Today |date=Sep 2009|volume=62|issue=9|pages=38–43 |doi=10.1063/1.3226854|bibcode = 2009PhT....62i..38B }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effects on bound energies and scattering cross sections, but these cases have not been experimentally tested. An electric Aharonov–Bohm phenomenon was also predicted, in which a charged particle is affected by regions with different [[electrical potential]]s but zero electric field, but this has no experimental confirmation yet.&lt;ref name="The Aharonov–Bohm effects: Variations on a Subtle Theme." /&gt; A separate "molecular" Aharonov–Bohm effect was proposed for nuclear motion in multiply connected regions, but this has been argued to be a different kind of [[geometric phase]] as it is "neither nonlocal nor topological", depending only on local quantities along the nuclear path.&lt;ref&gt;

Werner Ehrenberg (1901&amp;ndash;1975) and [[R. E. Siday|Raymond E. Siday]] first predicted the effect in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;

The effect was confirmed experimentally, with a very large error, while Bohm was still alive.

== Significance ==
In the 18th and 19th centuries, physics was dominated by Newtonian dynamics, with its emphasis on [[force (physics)|forces]]. Electromagnetic phenomena were elucidated by a series of experiments involving the measurement of forces between charges, [[electrical current|currents]] and magnets in various configurations. Eventually, a description arose according to which charges, currents and magnets acted as local sources of propagating force fields, which then acted on other charges and currents locally through the [[Lorentz force law]]. In this framework, because one of the observed properties of the electric field was that it was [[curl (mathematics)|irrotational]], and one of the observed properties of the magnetic field was that it was [[divergence]]less, it was possible to express an electrostatic field as the [[gradient]] of a scalar potential (e.g. [[Coulomb]]'s electrostatic potential, which is mathematically analogous to the classical gravitational potential) and a stationary magnetic field as the curl of a vector potential (then a new concept – the idea of a scalar potential was already well accepted by analogy with gravitational potential). The language of potentials generalised seamlessly to the fully dynamic case but, since all physical effects were describable in terms of the fields which were the derivatives of the potentials, potentials (unlike fields) were not uniquely determined by physical effects: potentials were only defined up to an arbitrary additive constant electrostatic potential and an irrotational stationary magnetic vector potential.

The Aharonov–Bohm effect is important conceptually because it bears on three issues apparent in the recasting of ([[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s) [[classical electromagnetism|classical electromagnetic theory]] as a [[gauge theory]], which before the advent of quantum mechanics could be argued to be a mathematical reformulation with no physical consequences. The Aharonov–Bohm [[thought experiment]]s and their experimental realization imply that the issues were not just philosophical.

The three issues are: 
#whether potentials are "physical" or just a convenient tool for calculating force fields;
#whether [[action (physics)|action]] [[principle of stationary action|principle]]s are fundamental; 
#the [[principle of locality]].

Because of reasons like these, the Aharonov–Bohm effect was chosen by the ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine as one of the "seven wonders of the quantum world".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/special/seven-wonders-of-the-quantum-world "Seven wonders of the quantum world"], newscientist.com&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Potentials vs. fields ===
It is generally argued that Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates the physicality of electromagnetic potentials, ''Φ'' and '''A''', in quantum mechanics.  Classically it was possible to argue that only the [[electromagnetic field]]s are physical, while the electromagnetic potentials are purely mathematical constructs, that due to [[gauge freedom]] aren't even unique for a given electromagnetic field.

However, Vaidman has challenged this interpretation by showing that the AB effect can be explained without the use of potentials so long as one gives a full quantum mechanical treatment to the source charges that produce the electromagnetic field.&lt;ref name="Vaidman2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first=L. |last=Vaidman |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Role of potentials in the Aharonov-Bohm effect |journal=Physical Review A |date=Oct 2012|volume=86|issue=4|pages=040101 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.86.040101|arxiv = 1110.6169 |bibcode = 2012PhRvA..86d0101V }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to this view, the potential in quantum mechanics is just as physical (or non-physical) as it was classically. Aharonov, Cohen, and Rohrlich responded that the effect may be due to a local gauge potential or due to non-local gauge-invariant fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1605.05470|last1 = Sjöqvist|first1 = Erik|title = On the paper 'Role of potentials in the Aharonov-Bohm effect'|class = quant-ph|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two papers published in the journal in 2017 ''[[Physical Review A]]'' have demonstrated a quantum mechanical solution for the system. Their analysis shows that the phase shift can be viewed as generated by solenoid's vector potential acting on the electron or the electron's vector potential acting on the solenoid or the electron and solenoid currents acting on the quantized vector potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= P. Pearle|author2= A. Rizzi|title= Quantum-mechanical inclusion of the source in the Aharonov-Bohm effects|journal=Phys Rev A|date=2017|volume=95|issue= 5|pages=052123|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.95.052123|arxiv= 1507.00068|bibcode= 2017PhRvA..95e2123P}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= P. Pearle|author2= A. Rizzi|title= Quantized vector potential and alternative views of the magnetic Aharonov-Bohm phase shift|journal=Phys Rev A|date=2017|volume=95|issue= 5|pages=052124|doi= 10.1103/PhysRevA.95.052124|arxiv= 1605.04324|bibcode= 2017PhRvA..95e2124P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Global action vs. local forces ===

Similarly, the Aharonov–Bohm effect illustrates that the [[Lagrangian dynamics|Lagrangian approach to dynamics]], based on [[action (physics)|energies]], is not just a computational aid to the [[Newtonian dynamics|Newtonian approach]], based on [[force (physics)|forces]]. Thus the Aharonov–Bohm effect validates the view that forces are an incomplete way to formulate physics, and potential energies must be used instead. In fact [[Richard Feynman]] complained{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} that he had been taught electromagnetism from the perspective of electromagnetic fields, and he wished later in life he had been taught to think in terms of the electromagnetic potential instead, as this would be more fundamental. In Feynman's [[path integral formulation|path-integral view of dynamics]], the potential field directly changes the phase of an electron wave function, and it is these changes in phase that lead to measurable quantities.

=== Locality of electromagnetic effects ===
The Aharonov–Bohm effect shows that the local '''E''' and '''B''' fields do not contain full information about the electromagnetic field, and the [[electromagnetic four-potential]], (''Φ'', '''A'''), must be used instead. By [[Stokes' theorem]], the magnitude of the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be calculated using the electromagnetic fields alone, ''or'' using the four-potential alone. But when using just the electromagnetic fields, the effect depends on the field values in a region from which the test particle is excluded. In contrast, when using just the electromagnetic four-potential, the effect only depends on the potential in the region where the test particle is allowed.  Therefore, one must either abandon the [[principle of locality]], which most physicists are reluctant to do, or accept that the electromagnetic four-potential offers a more complete description of electromagnetism than the electric and magnetic fields can. On the other hand, the AB effect is crucially quantum mechanical; quantum mechanics is well-known to feature [[Quantum nonlocality|non-local effects]] (albeit still disallowing superluminal communication), and Vaidman has argued that this is just a non-local quantum effect in a different form.&lt;ref name="Vaidman2012" /&gt;

In [[classical electromagnetism]] the two descriptions were equivalent. With the addition of quantum theory, though, the electromagnetic potentials ''Φ'' and '''A''' are seen as being more fundamental.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Feynman, R|title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics|volume=2 |pages=15–25|quote=knowledge of the classical electromagnetic field acting locally on a particle is not sufficient to predict its quantum-mechanical behavior.'' and ''...is the vector potential a "real" field? ... a real field is a mathematical device for avoiding the idea of action at a distance. .... for a long time it was believed that '''A''' was not a "real" field. .... there are phenomena involving quantum mechanics which show that in fact '''A''' is a "real" field in the sense that we have defined it..... '''E''' and '''B''' are slowly disappearing from the modern expression of physical laws; they are being replaced by '''A''' [the vector potential] and &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;[the scalar potential]|title-link=The Feynman Lectures on Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Despite this, all observable effects end up being expressible in terms of the electromagnetic fields, '''E''' and '''B'''.  This is interesting because, while you can calculate the electromagnetic field from the four-potential, due to [[gauge freedom]] the reverse is not true.

==Magnetic solenoid effect==

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect can be seen as a result of the requirement that quantum physics be invariant with respect to the [[gauge fixing|gauge choice]] for the [[electromagnetic potential]], of which the [[magnetic vector potential]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; forms part.

Electromagnetic theory implies that a particle with electric charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; travelling along some path &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; in a region with zero [[magnetic field]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, but non-zero &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; (by &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B} = 0 = \nabla \times \mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt;), acquires a phase shift &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;, given in [[SI]] units by

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi = \frac{q}{\hbar} \int_P \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{x},&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, particles, with the same start and end points, but travelling along two different routes will acquire a phase difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta \varphi&lt;/math&gt; determined by the [[magnetic flux]] &lt;math&gt;\Phi_B&lt;/math&gt; through the area between the paths (via [[Stokes' theorem]] and &lt;math&gt;\nabla  \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;), and given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\varphi = \frac{q\Phi_B}{\hbar}.&lt;/math&gt;

[[Image:Aharonov-Bohm effect.svg|thumbnail|right|250px|Schematic of double-slit experiment in which the Aharonov–Bohm effect can be observed: electrons pass through two slits, interfering at an observation screen, with the interference pattern shifted when a magnetic field '''B''' is turned on in the cylindrical solenoid.]]

In [[quantum mechanics]] the same particle can travel between two points by a [[sum over histories|variety of paths]].  Therefore, this phase difference can be observed by placing a [[solenoid]] between the slits of a [[double-slit experiment]] (or equivalent). An ideal solenoid (i.e. infinitely long and with a perfectly uniform current distribution) encloses a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;, but does not produce any magnetic field outside of its cylinder, and thus the charged particle (e.g. an [[electron]]) passing outside experiences no magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. However, there is a ([[Curl (mathematics)|curl]]-free) vector potential &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; outside the solenoid with an enclosed flux, and so the relative phase of particles passing through one slit or the other is altered by whether the solenoid current is turned on or off. This corresponds to an observable shift of the interference fringes on the observation plane.

The same phase effect is responsible for the [[magnetic flux quantum|quantized-flux]] requirement in [[superconductivity|superconducting]] loops. This quantization occurs because the superconducting wave function must be single valued: its phase difference &lt;math&gt;\Delta \varphi&lt;/math&gt; around a closed loop must be an integer multiple of &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt; (with the charge &lt;math&gt;q=2e&lt;/math&gt; for the electron [[Cooper pair]]s), and thus the flux must be a multiple of &lt;math&gt;h/2e&lt;/math&gt;. The superconducting flux quantum was actually predicted prior to Aharonov and Bohm, by F. London in 1948 using a phenomenological model.&lt;ref&gt;

===Monopoles and Dirac strings===

The magnetic Aharonov–Bohm effect is also closely related to [[Paul Dirac|Dirac's]] argument that the existence of a [[magnetic monopole]] can be accommodated by the existing magnetic source-free [[Maxwell's equations]] if both electric and magnetic charges are quantized.

A magnetic monopole implies a mathematical singularity in the vector potential, which can be expressed as a [[Dirac string]] of infinitesimal diameter that contains the equivalent of all of the 4π''g'' flux from a monopole "charge" ''g''. The Dirac string starts from, and terminates on, a magnetic monopole.  Thus, assuming the absence of an infinite-range scattering effect by this arbitrary choice of singularity, the requirement of single-valued wave functions (as above) necessitates charge-quantization. That is, &lt;math&gt;2\frac{q_\text{e}q_\text{m}}{\hbar c}&lt;/math&gt; must be an integer (in [[Gaussian units|cgs]] units) for any electric charge ''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; and magnetic charge ''q''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;.

Like the [[electromagnetic potential]] '''A''' the Dirac string is not gauge invariant (it moves around with fixed endpoints under a gauge transformation) and so is also not directly measurable.

==Electric effect==

Just as the phase of the wave function depends upon the magnetic vector potential, it also depends upon the scalar electric potential. By constructing a situation in which the electrostatic potential varies for two paths of a particle, through regions of zero electric field, an observable Aharonov–Bohm interference phenomenon from the phase shift has been predicted; again, the absence of an electric field means that, classically, there would be no effect.

From the [[Schrödinger equation]], the phase of an eigenfunction with energy ''E'' goes as &lt;math&gt;e^{-iEt/\hbar}&lt;/math&gt;. The energy, however, will depend upon the electrostatic potential ''V'' for a particle with charge ''q''. In particular, for a region with constant potential ''V'' (zero field), the electric potential energy ''qV'' is simply added to ''E'', resulting in a phase shift:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta\phi = -\frac{qVt}{\hbar} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''t'' is the time spent in the potential.

The initial theoretical proposal for this effect suggested an experiment where charges pass through conducting cylinders along two paths, which shield the particles from external electric fields in the regions where they travel, but still allow a varying potential to be applied by charging the cylinders. This proved difficult to realize, however. Instead, a different experiment was proposed involving a ring geometry interrupted by tunnel barriers, with a bias voltage ''V'' relating the potentials of the two halves of the ring. This situation results in an Aharonov–Bohm phase shift as above, and was observed experimentally in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;

This behavior is similar to that of the superconducting quantum interference devices (see [[SQUID]]).

==Mathematical interpretation==

{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
The Aharonov–Bohm effect can be understood from the fact that one can only measure absolute values of the wave function. While this allows for measurement of phase differences through quantum interference experiments, there is no way to specify a wavefunction with constant absolute phase. In the absence of an electromagnetic field one can come close by declaring the eigenfunction of the momentum operator with zero momentum to be the function "1" (ignoring normalization problems) and specifying wave functions relative to this eigenfunction "1". In this representation the i-momentum operator is (up to a factor &lt;math&gt;\hbar/i&lt;/math&gt;) the differential operator &lt;math&gt; \partial_i = \frac{\partial}{\partial x^i}&lt;/math&gt;. However, by gauge invariance, it is equally valid to declare the zero momentum eigenfunction to be &lt;math&gt; e^{-i\phi(x)} &lt;/math&gt; at the cost of representing the i-momentum operator (up to a factor) as &lt;math&gt;\nabla_i = \partial_i + i(\partial_i \phi)&lt;/math&gt; i.e. with a pure gauge vector potential &lt;math&gt;A = d\phi&lt;/math&gt;. There is no real asymmetry because representing the former in terms of the latter is just as messy as representing the latter in terms of the former. This means that it is physically more natural to describe wave "functions", in the language of [[differential geometry]], as sections in a complex line bundle with a hermitian metric and a U(1)-[[connection (mathematics)|connection]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;. The [[curvature form]] of the connection, &lt;math&gt;i F = \nabla\wedge\nabla &lt;/math&gt;, is, up to the factor i, the [[Faraday tensor]] of the electromagnetic [[field strength]]. The Aharonov–Bohm effect is then a manifestation of the fact that a connection with zero curvature (i.e. [[flat connection|flat]]), need not be trivial since it can have [[monodromy]] along a topologically nontrivial path fully contained in the zero curvature (i.e. field free) region. By definition this means that sections that are parallelly translated along a topologically non trivial path pick up a phase, so that covariant constant sections cannot be defined over the whole field free region.

Given a trivialization of the line-bundle, a non-vanishing section, the U(1)-connection is given by the 1-[[Differential form|form]] corresponding to the [[electromagnetic four-potential]] ''A'' as &lt;math&gt; \nabla = d + i A\,&lt;/math&gt; where ''d'' means [[exterior derivative|exterior derivation]] on the [[Minkowski space]]. The monodromy is the [[holonomy]] of the flat connection. The holonomy of a connection, flat or non flat, around a closed loop &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;e^{i \int_\gamma A}&lt;/math&gt; (one can show this does not depend on the trivialization but only on the connection). For a flat connection one can find a [[Gauge theory|gauge transformation]] in any [[simply connected]] field free region(acting on wave functions and connections) that gauges away the vector potential. However, if the monodromy is nontrivial, there is no such gauge transformation for the whole outside region. In fact as a consequence of [[Stokes' theorem]], the holonomy is determined by the magnetic flux through a surface &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; bounding the loop &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, but such a surface may exist only if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; passes through a region of non trivial field:

:&lt;math&gt; e^{i \int_{\partial \sigma} A} = e^{i \int_{\sigma} dA} = e^{i\int_\sigma F}&lt;/math&gt;

The monodromy of the flat connection only depends on the topological type of the loop in the field free region (in fact on the loops [[Homology (mathematics)|homology]] class). The holonomy description is general, however, and works inside as well as outside the superconductor. Outside of the conducting tube containing the magnetic field, the field strength &lt;math&gt;F = 0&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, outside the tube the connection is flat, and the monodromy of the loop contained in the field-free region depends only on the [[winding number]] around the tube. The monodromy of the connection for a loop going round once (winding number 1) is the phase difference of a particle interfering by propagating left and right of the superconducting tube containing the magnetic field. 
If one wants to ignore the physics inside the superconductor and only describe the physics in the outside region, it becomes natural and mathematically convenient to describe the quantum electron by a section in a complex line bundle with an "external" flat connection &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt; with monodromy

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = &lt;/math&gt; magnetic flux through the tube / &lt;math&gt;(\hbar/e)&lt;/math&gt;

rather than an external EM field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. The Schrödinger equation readily generalizes to this situation by using the [[Laplacian]] of the connection for the (free) Hamiltonian

:&lt;math&gt; H  = \frac{1}{2m}\nabla^*\nabla &lt;/math&gt;.

Equivalently, one can work in two simply connected regions with cuts that pass from the tube towards or away from the detection screen. In each of these regions the ordinary free Schrödinger equations would have to be solved, but in passing from one region to the other, in only one of the two connected components of the intersection (effectively in only one of the slits) a monodromy factor &lt;math&gt; e^{i\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is picked up, which results in the shift in the interference pattern as one changes the flux.

Effects with similar mathematical interpretation can be found in other fields. For example, in classical statistical physics, quantization of a molecular motor motion in a stochastic environment can be interpreted as an Aharonov–Bohm effect induced by a gauge field acting in the space of control parameters.&lt;ref name="chernyak-09prl"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9666">'''Bedding''', in [[ethology]] and [[animal husbandry]], is material, usually organic, used by animals to support their bodies when resting or otherwise stationary. It reduces [[Vascular occlusion|pressure on skin]], [[hypothermia|heat loss]], and [[Sanitation|contamination by waste]] produced by an animal or those it shares living space with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uUMaH661LZ8C&amp;lpg=PA40&amp;dq=%22animal%20bedding%22&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=%22animal%20bedding%22&amp;f=false|title=Illustrated dictionary and resource directory of environmental &amp;  occupational health|last=Koren|first=Herman|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|isbn=978-1-56670-590-5|location=|page=40|authorlink=|accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Dutch barn and straw bales at Bussock Barn - geograph.org.uk - 430068.jpg|thumb|[[Straw]] is a commonly used bedding material]]

== Types of bedding ==

[[Wood]] Shavings ([[pine]], [[Cedrus|cedar]], and [[aspen]]) are absorbent and have good odor control.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/environment/facts/97-029.htm|title=Livestock Bedding Alternatives|last=Kains|first=Frank|last2=Lovell|first2=Barbara|date=|year=1997|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|last3=Payne|first3=Mike|last4=Tremblay|first4=Rob}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different textures such as fine cut, soft shreds, or thick cut are used for different animals. Wood shavings can be dusty and contain aromatic oils that can cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, urinary tract, or skin disorders and other health problems in some animals.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Aspen and kiln-dried wood shavings tend to be less dusty, plus the oils are removed.

[[Hemp]] Bedding is extremely absorbent and thus efficient, has good odor control and minimal dust, and provides more insulation than other bedding materials. Additionally, hemp is naturally pest-repellent and horses are not tempted to eat it. Due to its low dust, hemp bedding is recommended for horses with [[allergy]] or respiratory issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehorse.com/19201/not-your-grandmothers-bedding-horse-bedding-alternatives/|title=Not Your Grandmother's Bedding: Horse Bedding Alternatives – The Horse|date=2016-12-08|work=The Horse|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; From an environmental consideration, hemp is more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] than wood as it requires both less time and human intervention to grow repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.backyardchickencoops.com.au/An-Animal-Lovers-Guide-To-Hemp-Bedding|title=An Animal Lovers Guide to Hemp Bedding|date=2015-03-31|work=Chicken Houses|access-date=2018-05-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Corncob]] Bedding contains no aromatic oils or dust. Corncobs are heat dried which makes it very absorbent.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; When water or urine is absorbed, the corncob will start molding so daily cleaning is needed. If not properly maintained, bacterial infections are likely to occur. Corncobs are cut to little pieces making it easy to ingest. This could be dangerous if ingested by a small animal.  

[[Paper recycling|Paper]] Bedding includes either recycled paper or cardboard boxes.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/g3546.pdf|title=Using Chopped Newspaper for Animal Bedding|last=Gunderson|first=Scott|last2=Wise|first2=Gregg|date=|website=|publisher=Wisconsin County Extension Office|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=December 8, 2017|last3=Roach|first3=John|last4=Muench|first4=Dave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper bedding is ideal for animals with allergies since it contains no oils and little dust.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unlike corncob bedding, paper bedding has no adverse effects with consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Paper is very absorbent, but when saturated with water or urine, a strong odor results.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Straw]] is a soft, dry stalks containing small grains such as barley, oats, rice, rye, and wheat.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Straw is easy to handle and available in most agricultural areas. When deciding to use straw, is imperative to make sure that the straw is not palatable. To do this, the seed must be checked to ensure it is not available for consumption.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Straw has excellent absorbency and is unlikely to mold.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ag.umass.edu/crops-dairy-livestock-equine/fact-sheets/bedding-options-for-livestock-equine|title=Bedding Options for Livestock and Equine|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[Hay]] is composed of grasses that have been cut then dried. Although hay is most commonly used for food, it also can be used for the purpose of animal bedding. This may result in an insufficient diet for the animal if it begins eating its bedding. In addition, old hay may give off dust that could result in respiratory problems. A disadvantage of using hay is that it is one of the more expensive beddings. It is quite absorbent but once it is soiled, it begins to decompose quickly producing an unpleasant odor.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Because of the moisture, hay will mold quickly and could result in a bacterial infection.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Woodchips|Wood Chips]] are a mixture of bark, sawdust, and post peelings. Agriculturalists use wood chips as a cost efficient bedding. While its cost may be desirable, woodchips  provide minimal comfort and absorbency. Wood chips generate mold and mildew, because of its highly damp environment. This causes bacterial growth and potential infection if not changed often. Wood chips are also known to stain the coat of animals from bedding in the moist chips.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sawdust]] must be kiln‐dried to ensure cleanliness and absorbability.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Sawdust ensures quick and easy cleaning, because of the soiled or wet material begins to clump together.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Although the cleanup is easier, sawdust is known to create a lot of health problems such as respiratory, urinary tract, mastitis, and skin disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Sand]] is ideal when looking at microbial growth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sand is the most comfortable bedding because of its natural ability to form to the animals curvature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, large sand particles can cause abrasions and bruising on an animal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another downfall is sand is not very absorbent and causes a difficult clean up of soiled materials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Benefits of Bedding ==

Many animals benefit from bedding, including livestock, poultry, rodents and reptiles. Bedding, in the most simplest context, provides comfort for these animals. When constructed properly, these cushioned structures decrease irritability and rough textures that can cause pain, pressure, and stress on the subject. This also prevents bruising and sores to preserve the physical beauty of the animal.

Bedding also creates an environment of moisture retention. Although incapable to prevent all microbial activity, bedding absorbs a substantial amount of moisture within the animal’s living environment. Soaking up excess urine, bedding assists in keeping the cage dry until the next change. A drier cage also promotes ventilation which  decreases harmful levels of environmental pathogens.

These factors are few of many. With insulation against cold weather and drafts amongst the list, odor control sustains a position as well. Assistance in decreasing and filtering dust to protect against respiratory infections ranks high. Creating an environment conducive for thermoregulation and chemical resistance, along with simple privacy, bedding is ideal for many animal types. All these factors relay a decreases in stress and pain encouraging peaceful resting opportunities that intern increase the overall life, productivity, and well being of the animal.

== Maintenance of Bedding ==

Bedding maintenance is an important part of both human and animal health, cleanliness, and well being.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Angulo|first=F. J.|last2=Steinmuller|first2=N.|last3=Demma|first3=L.|last4=Bender|first4=J. B.|last5=Eidson|first5=M.|date=2006-12-15|title=Outbreaks of Enteric Disease Associated with Animal Contact: Not Just a Foodborne Problem Anymore|url=https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/43/12/1596/278637|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|language=en|volume=43|issue=12|pages=1596–1602|doi=10.1086/509576|pmid=17109295|issn=1058-4838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storage of bedding is important to insure that the bedding does not ruin. The best place to store it is in an environment that is dry and above ground level. Frequent bedding change is important to decrease the amount of bacteria.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;The most bacterial contaminated area is the front of the stall.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This area should receive the most attention when cleaning and changing the bedding. Bedding should not be throughout the stall, it should be clear of the feeding and watering trough. It is recommended that the bedding is more frequently changed when there are a great number of animals, since the bedding will become contaminated faster.  

It is important to note that weather, frequent bedding maintenance, barn design, ventilation, and stall management influence bacteria levels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When one or several of these things change or are not met the susceptibility of illness significantly increases.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; These illnesses are potentially deadly to these animals and that is why the maintenance of bedding is so important.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In marketing, a '''blind taste test''' is often used as a tool for companies to compare their [[brand]] to another brand. For example, the [[Pepsi Challenge]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gee|first=James Paul|date=2010-05-22|title=Sociocultural theory and blind taste-tests|url=http://www.rw.org.za/index.php/rw/article/view/7|journal=Reading &amp; Writing|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.4102/rw.v1i1.7|issn=2308-1422}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a famous taste test that has been run by [[Pepsi]] since 1975, as a method to show their superiority to [[Coca-Cola]]. Additionally, taste tests are sometimes used as a tool by companies to develop their brand or new products.

Blind taste tests are ideal for goods such as food or [[Blind wine tasting|wine]] that are consumed directly. Researchers use blind taste tests to obtain information about customers' perceptions and preferences on the goods. Blind taste test can be used to:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://businesscasestudies.co.uk/greggs/consumer-focused-product-development/carrying-out-taste-tests.html#axzz4MnyrFR00|title=Carrying out taste tests - Consumer focused product development - GREGGS {{!}} GREGGS case studies and information {{!}} Business Case Studies|website=businesscasestudies.co.uk|access-date=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Track views on a product over time 
* assess changes or improvements made to a product 
* gauge reactions to a new product [[File:Slow Food Maple Syrup Tasting (2410527939).jpg|thumb|270x270px|Maple syrup Tasting]]

== What is a blind taste test ==
Blind taste tests require a "blind testing" meaning the people taking the blind taste test are unaware of the identity of the brand being tested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luis Méndez|first=José|last2=Oubiña|first2=Javier|last3=Rubio|first3=Natalia|title=The relative importance of brand‐packaging, price and taste in affecting brand preferences|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1108/00070701111177665|journal=British Food Journal|volume=113|issue=10|pages=1229–1251|doi=10.1108/00070701111177665}}&lt;/ref&gt; or if done at home this can be as simple as a blindfold over the person taking the test. This means that any bias, preconceived ideas about a particular brand or food, is eliminated. The people taking the test will also be unaware of any changes done to the product.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the famous Pepsi Challenge,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they got people to take a sip from two different unlabelled glasses, not knowing which was Coke and which was Pepsi.

==Types of blind taste tests==
[[File:Blind taste test.jpg|thumb|In this single blind taste test of two cola brands, the experimenter knows which bottle is which]]
There are two types of blind taste tests:
*In a [[Single blind|single blind test]], experimenters know information about the participants, but the participants know nothing about the experimenters or the product they are testing. The aforementioned Pepsi Challenge is an example of a single blind test.
*In a [[double blind|double blind taste test]], the experimenters know nothing about the participants, and the participants know nothing about the experimenters or the product they are testing.

==In popular culture==
Taste tests are commonly employed by the [[public television]] show ''[[America's Test Kitchen]]'' and its spin-off series ''[[Cook's Country]]'', typically administered by [[Jack Bishop]].&lt;ref name=ATK&gt;{{cite news|title='Test Kitchen': Have Your (Gluten-Free) Cake, And Love Eating It Too|url=http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/npr-test-kitchen-have-your-gluten-free-cake-and-love-eating-it-too/|accessdate=2014-04-14|newspaper=NPR via OPB|date=2014-03-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415142401/http://www.opb.org/artsandlife/article/npr-test-kitchen-have-your-gluten-free-cake-and-love-eating-it-too/|archivedate=2014-04-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contrail.fourengined.arp.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A high-flying jet's engines leaving a condensation trail ([[contrail]])]]

The '''chemtrail conspiracy theory''' is based on the erroneous belief that long-lasting [[condensation trails]] are "chemtrails" consisting of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological agent]]s left in the sky by high-flying aircraft, sprayed for nefarious purposes undisclosed to the general public.&lt;ref name=currsci/&gt; Believers in this [[conspiracy theory]] say that while normal [[contrail]]s [[dissipate]] relatively quickly, contrails that linger must contain additional substances.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; Those who subscribe to the theory speculate that the purpose of the chemical release may be [[solar radiation management]],&lt;ref name="USAtoday2001" /&gt; [[weather modification]], [[psychological manipulation]], [[human population control]], or [[biological warfare|biological]] or [[chemical warfare|chemical]] warfare and that the trails are causing respiratory illnesses and other health problems.&lt;ref name="currsci" /&gt;&lt;ref name="weatherwise" /&gt;

The arguments have been dismissed by the [[scientific community]]. There is no evidence that purported chemtrails differ from normal water-based contrails routinely left by high-flying aircraft under certain [[Atmospheric Conditions|atmospheric conditions]].&lt;ref name="air force" /&gt; Although proponents have tried to [[Proof (truth)|prove]] that chemical spraying occurs, their analyses have been flawed or based on misconceptions.&lt;ref name="barium" /&gt;&lt;ref name="origin" /&gt; Because of the persistence of the conspiracy theory and questions about [[Cover-up|government involvement]], scientists and [[government agencies]] around the world have repeatedly explained that the supposed chemtrails are in fact normal contrails.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=TheHill2015&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/235632-epa-confronts-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory |title=EPA confronts ‘chemtrails’ conspiracy talk|last=Cama |first=Timothy |date=March 13, 2015 |website= |publisher=''the Hill'' |access-date=December 10, 2016 |quote=Conspiracy theorists say that government officials or others are using jets to spray harmful chemicals into the atmosphere. They cite the contrails left by jets as evidence of the chemicals. The EPA has added a new notice to its website, which links to a fact sheet explaining that the trails left by jets in the atmosphere are only ice particles and contain no harmful chemicals. “Contrails are line-shaped clouds or ‘Condensation trails’ composed of ice particles that are visible behind jet aircraft engines under certain atmospheric conditions and at times can persist,” says the notice, posted to the EPA’s website Friday. “EPA is not aware of any deliberate actions to release chemical or biological agents into the atmosphere.” Theorists have posited that the chemicals are meant to control the climate, to harm humans or to kill them. The fact sheet from the EPA and other federal agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was first published in 2000, when the chemtrails conspiracy became popular on the Web. An EPA spokeswoman said the agency frequently receives questions about chemtrails.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telegraph2013&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/Chemtrails-and-other-aviation-conspiracy-theories/ |title='Chemtrails' and other aviation conspiracy theories|last=Smith |first=Oliver |date=September 24, 2013 |website=telegraph.co.uk |publisher= ''the Telegraph''|access-date=December 11, 2016 |quote=So persistent is the chemtrail theory that US government agencies regularly receive calls from irate citizens demanding an explanation...The conspiracy theory took root in the Nineties, with the publication of a US Air Force research paper about weather modification...Governments and scientific institutions have of course dismissed the theories, and claim those vapour trails which persist for longer than usual, or disperse to cover a wide area, are just normal contrails.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Contrails.jpg|thumb|295px|right|Multiple concurrent contrails.]]

Chemtrail conspiracy theories began to circulate after the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) published a 1996 report about weather modification.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2013 /&gt;  Following the report, in the late 1990s the USAF was accused of "spraying the U.S. population with mysterious substances" from aircraft "generating unusual contrail patterns."&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt;&lt;ref name=times&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Times |author=Paul Simons |title=Weather Eye: contrail conspiracy |date=27 September 2013 |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/weather/article3879866.ece |quote=This conspiracy idea took hold in 1996 when the US Government was accused of trying to modify the weather for military means}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theories were posted on [[Internet forum]]s by people including Richard Finke and William Thomas, and were among many conspiracy theories popularized by late-night radio host [[Art Bell]], starting in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Jay|title=Those Mysterious Lines in the Sky |url=http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/swallowtail/619/linesinsky.html|publisher=Veritas|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817072216/http://www.fortunecity.com/greenfield/swallowtail/619/linesinsky.html|archivedate=August 17, 2000|date=March 1, 1999}}, cited in USAF [https://web.archive.org/web/20021202230839/http://www.af.mil/environment/contrails_chemtrail.shtml Contrails] page.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite journal |last=Thomas |first=Dave |title=The 'Chemtrail Conspiracy'|journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=September 2008 |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/chemtrail_conspiracy |volume=18 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the chemtrail conspiracy theory spread, federal officials were flooded with angry calls and letters.&lt;ref name=Telegraph2013 /&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;

A few months earlier, the Air Force had put out its own fact sheet, which tries to refute its opponents' arguments point by point.  "If you try to pin these people down and refute things, it's, 'Well, you're just part of the conspiracy,' " says atmospheric scientist Patrick Minnis of NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Va.

In the early 2000s the USAF released an undated fact sheet that stated the conspiracy theories were a [[hoax]] fueled in part by citations to a 1996 strategy paper drafted within their [[Air University (United States Air Force)|Air University]] titled ''Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Chemtrail" Hoax |url=http://www.af.mil/environment/contrails_chemtrail.shtml|accessdate=7 May 2010|publisher=Air Force|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021202230839/http://www.af.mil/environment/contrails_chemtrail.shtml|archivedate=2 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="owning"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c15/v3c15-1.htm |title=Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owning the Weather in 2025 |date=1996|publisher=Fas.org |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716000939/http://www.fas.org/spp/military/docops/usaf/2025/v3c15/v3c15-1.htm|archivedate=July 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paper was presented in response to a military directive to outline a future strategic [[weather modification]] system for the purpose of maintaining the United States' military dominance in the year 2025, and identified as "fictional representations of future situations/scenarios."&lt;ref name="owning"/&gt; The USAF further clarified in 2005 that the paper "does not reflect current military policy, practice, or capability," and that it is "not conducting any weather modification experiments or programs and has no plans to do so in the future."&lt;ref name="air force"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-051013-001.pdf|title=Contrails Facts|date=13 October 2005|publisher=US Air Force|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306001902/http://www.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-051013-001.pdf|archivedate=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "EPA"/&gt; Additionally, the USAF states that the "'Chemtrail' hoax has been investigated and refuted by many established and accredited universities, scientific organizations, and major media publications."&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt;

The conspiracy theories are seldom covered by the [[mainstream media]], and when they are, they are usually cast as an example of anti-government [[paranoia]].&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; For example, in 2013, when it was made public that the CIA, NASA, and [[NOAA]] intended to provide funds to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] to conduct research into methods to counteract global warming with geoengineering, an article in the ''[[International Business Times]]'' anticipated that "the idea of any government agency looking at ways to control, or manipulate, the weather will be met with scrutiny and fears of a malign conspiracies" [''sic''], and mentioned chemtrail conspiracy theories as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Poladian|first1=Charles|title=CIA Exploring Geoengineering, Ways To Control Weather, To Reverse Globing Warming: Report|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/cia-exploring-geoengineering-ways-control-weather-reverse-globing-warming-report-1356093|work=International Business Times|date=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory find support for their theories in their interpretations of sky phenomena, videos posted to the internet, and reports about government programs; they also have certain beliefs about the goals of the alleged conspiracy and the effects of its alleged efforts and generally take certain actions based on those beliefs.

Proponents of the chemtrail conspiracy theory say that chemtrails can be distinguished from contrails by their long duration, asserting that the chemtrails are those trails left by aircraft that persist for as much as a half day or transform into cirrus-like clouds.&lt;ref name=knight/&gt; The proponents claim that after 1995 contrails had a different chemical composition and lasted a lot longer on the sky; proponents fail to acknowledge evidence of long-lasting contrails shown in [[World War II]] era photographs.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt;

Proponents characterize contrails as streams that persist for hours and that, with their criss-cross, grid-like or parallel stripe patterns, eventually blend to form large clouds. Proponents view the presence of visible color spectra in the streams, unusual concentrations of sky tracks in a single area, or lingering tracks left by unmarked or military airplanes flying at atypical altitudes or locations as markers of chemtrails.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="weatherwise"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Schlatter |first=Thomas |title=Weather Queries: Chemtrail Controversy |periodical=Weatherwise |publication-date=9 March 2001 |url=http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.chemtrail.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20010309094441/http://www.weatherwise.org/qr/qry.chemtrail.html |archivedate = 9 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Thomas |first=William |title=Stolen Skies: The Chemtrail Mystery |periodical=Earth Island Journal |publication-date=Summer 2002 |url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/stolen_skies_the_chemtrail_mystery/ |accessdate=30 August 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fox12 Idaho"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fox12news.com/Global/story.asp?S=10147467|title=Contrails vs. Chemtrails|last=Hamilton|first=Dan|date=7 April 2009&lt;!-- 09:52 PM EDT --&gt;|work=Fox12 news at nine|publisher=Fox12 Idaho KTRV-TV|accessdate=11 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KSLA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemtrails: Is U.S. Gov't.

Photographs of barrels installed in the passenger space of an aircraft for [[flight test]] purposes have been claimed to show aerosol dispersion systems. The real purpose of the barrels is to simulate the weight of passengers or cargo. The barrels are filled with water, and the water can be pumped from barrel to barrel in order to test different [[Center of gravity|centers of gravity]] while the aircraft is in flight.&lt;ref name="Weight and balance testing"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Haenggi | first = Michael | title = Boeing Widebodies | publisher = Zenith Press | year = 2003 | page = 15 | isbn = 1610607074 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=OEniu9ff-_sC&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jim Marrs]] has cited a 2007 [[Louisiana]] television station report as evidence for chemtrails. In the report the air underneath a crosshatch of supposed chemtrails was measured and apparently found to contain unsafe levels of [[barium]]: at 6.8 parts per million, three times the US nationally recommended limit. A subsequent analysis of the footage showed, however, that the equipment had been misused, and the reading exaggerated by a factor of 100&amp;mdash;the true level of barium measured was both usual and safe.&lt;ref name=barium&gt;{{cite journal |last=Radford |first=Benjamin |title=Curious contrails: death from the sky? |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=March–April 2009 |page=25 |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/curious_contrails_death_from_the_sky/ |volume=33 |issue=2 |authorlink=Benjamin Radford}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2014 a video that went viral showed a commercial passenger airplane landing on a foggy night, which was described as emitting chemtrails.&lt;ref name=DiscoveryNews&gt;Benjamin Radford for Discovery.

The clip went viral on Facebook, with over three million views and more than 52,000 shares, cited as evidence of chemtrails. He later disclosed that the video post was done as a prank, and consequently he was subjected to some vitriolic abuse and threats from several conspiracy believers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/read/i-tricked-chemtrail-conspiracy-theorists-947|title=The Man Who Tricked Chemtrails Conspiracy Theorists - VICE|website=Vice|language=en-us|access-date=2017-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10203901372147247|title=Chris Bovey - What are they spraying? - Facebook|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some accounts, the chemicals are described as [[barium]] and [[aluminum]] [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]], [[polymer]] fibers, [[thorium]], or [[silicon carbide]].&lt;ref name=Cairns2014/&gt;

Chemtrail believers interpret the existence of [[cloud seeding]] programs and research into [[climate engineering]] as evidence for the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientists Just Say No to ‘Chemtrails’ Conspiracy Theory|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/science/scientists-just-say-no-to-chemtrails-conspiracy-theory.html?_r=0|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=26 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs===
Various versions of the chemtrail conspiracy theory have been propagated via the Internet and radio programs.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt; There are websites dedicated to the conspiracy theory, and it is particularly favored by right-wing groups because it fits well with deep suspicion of government.&lt;ref name=knight&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Peter |editor-last=Knight |author-first=Nigel |author-last=James |work=Conspiracy Theories in American History: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMIDrggs8TsC&amp;pg=PA197 |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-57607-812-9 |pages=197–199 |title=Contrails |publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|quote=there are no books on the subject to date.

A 2014 review of 20 chemtrail websites found that believers appeal to science in some of their arguments, but do not believe what academic or government-employed scientists say;&lt;ref name=Cairns2014/&gt;  scientists and federal agencies have consistently denied that chemtrails exist, explaining the sky tracks are simply persistent contrails.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=times/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keith&gt;{{cite web|title=Chemtrails Conspiracy Theory|url=http://keith.seas.harvard.edu/chemtrails-conspiracy-theory|publisher=David Keith Lab, Harvard|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review also found that believers generally hold that chemtrails are evidence of a global conspiracy; they allege various goals which include profit (for example, manipulating futures prices or making people sick to benefit drug companies), population control, or weapons testing (use of weather as a weapon, or testing bioweapons).&lt;ref name=Cairns2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keith/&gt;&lt;ref name=currsci&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fraser |first=Stephen |journal=Current Science |volume=94 |issue=14 |pages=8–9 |year=2009 |title=Phantom menace?

Some chemtrail believers adopt the notions of [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957) who devised a "[[cloudbuster]]" device from pipework. Reich claimed this device would influence weather and remove harmful energy from the atmosphere. Some chemtrail believers have built cloudbusters filled with crystals and metal filings, which are pointed at the sky in an attempt to clear it of chemtrails.&lt;ref name=orgone&gt;{{cite book |author=Fleming JR |series=Columbia Studies in International and Global History |title=Fixing the Sky: The Checkered History of Weather and Climate Control|publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2010 |page=103 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zmdBon09PY0C&amp;pg=PA103|isbn=9780231144131 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemtrail believers sometimes gather samples and have them tested, rather than rely on reports from government or academic laboratories, but their experiments are usually flawed; for example collecting samples in jars with metal lids contaminates the sample and is not done in scientific testing.&lt;ref name=Cairns2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bowerman|first1=Mary|title=Scientists disprove airplane 'chemtrail' theory|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/08/16/scientists-say-chemtrail-conspiracy-theory-isnt-real/88821176/|work=USA Today|date=August 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contrails ==
{{main|Contrail}}
[[File:Condensation Trails contrails from Aircraft Engine Exhaust.png|thumb|Contrails from [[propeller]]-driven aircraft engine exhaust, early 1940s]]

Contrails, or condensation trails, are "streaks of condensed water vapor created in the air by an airplane or rocket at high altitudes."&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt; Fossil fuel combustion (as in piston and jet engines) produces carbon dioxide and water vapor. At high altitudes the air is very cold. Hot humid air from the engine exahust mixes with the colder surrounding air, causing the water vapor to condense into droplets or ice crystals that form visible clouds. The rate at which contrails dissipate is entirely dependent on weather conditions. If the atmosphere is near [[Relative humidity|saturation]], the contrail may exist for some time. Conversely, if the atmosphere is dry, the contrail will dissipate quickly.&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt;

}}

It is well established by atmospheric scientists that contrails can persist for hours, and that it is normal for them to spread out into [[Cirrus cloud|cirrus]] sheets. The different-sized ice crystals in contrails descend at different rates, which spreads the contrail vertically. Then the differential in wind speeds between altitudes ([[wind shear]]) results in horizontal spreading of the contrail. This mechanism is similar to the formation of [[cirrus uncinus]] clouds. Contrails between {{convert|25000|and|40000|ft}} can often merge into an "almost solid" interlaced sheet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kuhn, P. M.|title=Airborne Observations of Contrail Effects on the Thermal Radiation Budget|date=September 1970|journal=Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|volume=27|issue=6|pages=937–942|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1970)027&lt;0937:AOOCEO&gt;2.0.CO;2|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0469%281970%29027%3C0937%3AAOOCEO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|year=1970|bibcode=1970JAtS...27..937K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrails can have a lateral spread of several kilometers, and given sufficient air traffic, it is possible for contrails to create an entirely overcast sky that increases the ice budget of individual contrails and persists for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Measurements of the Growth of the Ice Budget in a Persisting Contrail |author=R.G.

Experts on atmospheric phenomena say that the characteristics attributed to chemtrails are simply features of contrails responding to diverse conditions in terms of sunlight, temperature, horizontal and vertical [[wind shear]], and humidity levels present at the aircraft's altitude.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt;&lt;ref name="weatherwise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="earth"/&gt; In the US, the gridlike nature of the [[National Airspace System]]'s flight lanes tends to cause crosshatched contrails, and in general it is hard to discern from the ground whether overlapping contrails are at similar altitudes or not.&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt; The jointly published fact sheet produced by NASA, the EPA, the FAA, and NOAA in 2000 in response to alarms over chemtrails details the science of contrail formation, and outlines both the known and potential impacts contrails have on temperature and climate.&lt;ref name="EPA"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Aircraft Contrails Factsheet |periodical=United States Environmental Protection Agency |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/policy_guidance/envir_policy/media/contrails.pdf |accessdate=30 August 2008 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF produced a fact sheet that described these contrail phenomena as observed and analyzed since at least 1953. It also rebutted chemtrail theories more directly by identifying the theories as a hoax and disproving the existence of chemtrails.&lt;ref name="air force"/&gt;&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;

Patrick Minnis, an atmospheric scientist with NASA's Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, has said that [[logic]] does not dissuade most chemtrail proponents: "If you try to pin these people down and refute things, it's, 'Well, you're just part of the conspiracy'," he said.&lt;ref name=USAtoday2001/&gt;

Analysis of the use of commercial aircraft tracks for [[climate engineering]] has shown them to be generally unsuitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Laakso | first1 = A. | last2 = Partanen | first2 = A.

Astronomer [[Bob Berman]] has characterized the chemtrail conspiracy theory as a classic example of failure to apply [[Occam's razor]], writing in 2009 that instead of adopting the long-established "simple solution" that the trails consist of frozen water vapour, "the conspiracy web sites think the phenomenon started only a decade ago and involves an evil scheme in which 40,000 commercial pilots and air traffic controllers are in on the plot to poison their own children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Applying Occam's razor: problem solving isn't always a clean shave |first=Bob |last=Berman |authorlink=Bob Berman |journal=Astronomy |volume=37 |issue=9 |year=2009 |page=14 |url=http://business.highbeam.com/136942/article-1G1-206342261/applying-occam-razor-problem-solving-isnt-always-clean}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2016 survey of 77 atmospheric scientists concluded that "76 out of 77 (98.7%) of scientists that took part in this study said there was no evidence of a [secret large-scale atmospheric program (SLAP)], and that the data cited as evidence could be explained through other factors, such as typical contrail formation and poor data sampling instructions presented on SLAP websites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://stacks.iop.org/1748-9326/11/i=8/a=084011|title=Quantifying expert consensus against the existence of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program|first1=Christine|last1=Shearer|first2=Mick|last2=West|authorlink2=Mick West|first3=Ken|last3=Caldeira|first4=Steven J. |last4=Davis |date=1 January 2016 |journal=Environ.

'''China University of Political Science and Law''' ('''CUPL'''; [[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 中国政法大学; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 中國政法大學; [[pinyin]]: ''Zhōngguó Zhèngfǎ Dàxué'' abbr. 法大, ''Fǎ Dà'') is a national public research university specialized in [[law]], [[The arts|arts]], [[history]], [[philosophy]], [[economics]], [[management]] and [[foreign language]]s established in 1952 in [[Beijing]], [[China]].

China University of Political Science and Law is a first tier institution within the national key university [[Project 211]] and the [[985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines Project|Project 985 Innovative Platforms for Key Disciplines]] as part of the national endeavor to build world-class universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/xxgk/xxjj.htm|title=学校简介-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL is a Chinese Ministry of Education [[Double First Class University Plan|Double First Class Discipline University]] with the highest status "A+" in legal studies.&lt;ref name="Chinese Department of Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.cn/srcsite/A22/moe_843/201709/t20170921_314942.html|title=教育部 财政部 国家发展改革委 关于公布世界一流大学和一流学科建设高校及建设 学科名单的通知 (Notice from the Ministry of Education and other national governmental departments announcing the list of double first class universities and disciplines)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely considered to be one of the best Chinese universities in legal studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zyxw.cn/article/cdetail/3736|title=2016教育部法学院排名名单|last=|first=|date=|website=www.zyxw.cn|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also one of the most competitive and selective universities to enter in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gaokao.com/e/20130618/51c0051a1d4fd.shtml|title=2013年中国大学高考招生50强|last=|first=|date=|website=www.gaokao.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CUPL has two campuses, one in [[Haidian District|Haidian]], [[Beijing]] which is the original campus of the university, and the other locates in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. The university's Haidian campus now hosts [[postgraduate]] students only while [[undergraduate]]s study at a much larger campus in [[Changping District|Changping]], [[Beijing]]. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cupl.edu.cn/szdw.htm|title=师资队伍-中国政法大学|website=www.cupl.edu.cn|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries.

==History==
CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its official name '''Peking College of Political Science and Law''' and combined departments of law, political science, sociology and other subjects of [[Peking University]], [[Yenching University]], [[Fu Jen Catholic University]] and [[Tsinghua University]]. The prestigious scholar [[Ch'ien Tuan-Sheng]] (钱端升), who was educated at [[Harvard University]] and regarded as the founder of modern [[political science]] in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of [[Cultural Revolution]] CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch'ien died of illness in 1990.

In 1983, under the policy of [[Central People's Government]] to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State's [[Economic history of China|Seventh Five-Year-Plan]] in 1985.

Under the [[motto]] of "Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public"; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of [[Roman law]] in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] demanding [[democracy]] and [[rule of law]].

To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an [[American Bar Association]]-approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the [[Duquesne University School of Law]]. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with [[Fordham University School of Law]].

CUPL also maintains relationship with the [[University of Exeter]] and the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]], [[Deakin University]] in [[Australia]], [[University of Pennsylvania|the University of Pennsylvania]], [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington University in St. Louis]], the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|UIUC]], the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the [[University of California, Davis]] in the [[United States]], the [[University of Montreal]] in [[Canada]], and [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]] in [[Singapore]].

==Postgraduate Programs==
CUPL also offers two LLM programs and a PhD program for international students in English. One of them is based in Changping and is with the China-EU University. This is an EU funded course, and its main focus is on educating Chinese students on EU law.

There is another LLM program at Haidian campus, in downtown Beijing, which is aimed at International students to learn about Chinese law. There is also a PhD programs in English at Haidian campus. These are flexible and taught entirely in English. They include the option to study Mandarin, and gain law work experience in Beijing and other cities in China.

These postgraduate programs are also open as a semester program to international students from any institution around the world who would like to study at CUPL for one semester.

==Chinese Language Programs==
There are Chinese language programs for international students. These are 8,000 RMB per semester, or 16,000 RMB per year. Students can also stay in accommodation on campus which is 1,000 RMB per year.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10703">In physics, a '''chiral anomaly''' is the [[anomaly (physics)|anomalous]] [[nonconservation]] of a [[chirality (physics)|chiral]] current. In everyday terms, it is equivalent to a sealed box that contained equal number of positive and negative charged particles, that when opened was found to have more positive than negative particles, or vice versa.

Such events are expected to be prohibited according to classical [[conservation law]]s, but we know there must be ways they can be broken, because we have evidence of [[CP violation|charge-parity non-conservation ("CP violation")]]. It is possible that other imbalances have been caused by breaking of a ''chiral law'' of this kind. Many physicists suspect that the fact that the observable universe contains [[baryon asymmetry|more matter than antimatter]] is caused by a chiral anomaly [citation needed], although this observation does not itself rigorously establish that a chiral anomaly must exist. Research into chiral breaking laws is a major endeavor in particle physics research at this time.

==Description==
In some theories of [[fermion]]s with [[chiral symmetry]], the [[Quantization (physics)|quantization]] may lead to the breaking of this (global) chiral symmetry. In that case, the charge associated with the chiral symmetry is not conserved. The non-conservation happens in a [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] process from one [[Vacuum#Quantum mechanics|vacuum]] to another. Such a process is called an [[instanton]].

In the case of a symmetry related to the conservation of a fermionic [[particle number]], one may understand the creation of such particles as follows. The definition of a particle is different in the two vacuum states between which the tunneling occurs; therefore a state of no particles in one vacuum corresponds to a state with some particles in the other vacuum.

In particular, there is a [[Dirac sea]] of fermions and, when such a tunneling happens, it causes the [[energy level]]s of the sea fermions to gradually shift upwards for the particles and downwards for the anti-particles, or vice versa. This means particles which once belonged to the Dirac sea become real (positive energy) particles and particle creation happens.

Technically, an '''''anomalous symmetry''''' is a symmetry of the [[action (physics)|action]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, but not of the [[measure (physics)|measure]] {{mvar| μ}} and  therefore ''not'' of the [[partition function (quantum field theory)|generating functional]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z=\int\! {\exp (i \mathcal A/\hbar) ~ d \mu\,}&lt;/math&gt; of the quantized theory  (ℏ is Planck's action-quantum divided by 2π).

The measure consists of a part depending on the fermion field &lt;math&gt;[d\psi]&lt;/math&gt; and a part depending on its complex conjugate &lt;math&gt;[d\bar{\psi}]&lt;/math&gt;. The transformations of both parts under a chiral symmetry do not cancel in general. Note that if  ''ψ''   is a [[Dirac fermion]], then the chiral symmetry can be written as &lt;math&gt;\psi \rightarrow e^{i \alpha \gamma^5}\psi&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\gamma^5&lt;/math&gt; is some matrix acting on  ''ψ''.

From the formula for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal Z&lt;/math&gt; one also sees explicitly that in the [[classical limit]], ℏ → 0, anomalies don't come into play, since in this limit only the extrema of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt; remain relevant.

The anomaly is proportional to the instanton number of a gauge field to which the fermions are coupled (note that the gauge symmetry is always non-anomalous and is exactly respected, as is required by the consistency of the theory).

==Calculation==
The chiral anomaly can be calculated exactly by [[one-loop Feynman diagram]]s, e.g. the famous "triangle diagram", contributing to the [[pion]] decays, &lt;math&gt;\pi^0 \to\gamma\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi^0\to e^+e^-\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.

The amplitude for this process can be calculated directly from the change in the [[measure (physics)|measure]] of the fermionic fields under the chiral transformation.

Wess and Zumino developed a set of conditions on how the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] ought to behave under [[gauge transformation]]s called the [[Wess-Zumino consistency conditions]].

Fujikawa derived this anomaly using the correspondence between [[functional determinant]]s and the [[Partition function (quantum field theory)|partition function]] using the [[Atiyah-Singer index theorem]]. See [[Fujikawa's method]].

==An example: baryon number non-conservation==
The Standard Model of [[electroweak]] interactions has all the necessary ingredients for successful [[baryogenesis]], although these interactions have never been observed &lt;ref&gt;S. Eidelman et al. (Particle Data Group), Phys. Lett. B592 (2004) 1 ("No baryon number violating processes have yet been observed.")&lt;/ref&gt; and may be insufficient to explain the total [[baryon number]] of observed universe if the initial baryon number of the universe at the time of the Big Bang is zero. Beyond the violation of [[charge conjugation]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and [[CP violation]] &lt;math&gt;CP&lt;/math&gt; (charge+parity), baryonic charge violation appears through the '''Adler–Bell–Jackiw anomaly''' of the  &lt;math&gt;U(1)&lt;/math&gt; group.

Baryons are not conserved by the usual electroweak interactions due to quantum chiral anomaly. The classic electroweak [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] conserves [[baryon]]ic charge. Quarks always enter in bilinear combinations &lt;math&gt;q\bar q&lt;/math&gt;, so that a quark can disappear only in collision with an antiquark. In other words, the classical baryonic current &lt;math&gt;J_\mu^B&lt;/math&gt; is conserved:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu J_\mu^B = \sum_j \partial^\mu(\bar q_j \gamma_\mu q_j) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

However, quantum corrections known as the [[sphaleron]] destroy this [[conservation law]]:  instead of zero in the right hand side of this equation, there is a non vanishing quantum term,
:&lt;math&gt;\partial^\mu J_\mu^B = \frac{g^2 C}{16\pi^2} G^{\mu\nu a} \tilde{G}_{\mu\nu}^a,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|C}} is a numerical constant vanishing for ℏ =0,
:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{G}_{\mu\nu}^a = \frac{1}{2} \epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} G^{\alpha\beta a},&lt;/math&gt;
and the gauge field strength &lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}^a&lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression
:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial_\mu A_\nu^a - \partial_\nu A_\mu^a + g f^{a}_{bc} A_\mu^b A_\nu^c  ~. &lt;/math&gt;

Electroweak sphalerons can only change the baryon and/or lepton number by 3 or multiples of 3 (collision of three baryons into three leptons/antileptons and vice versa).

An important fact is that the anomalous current non-conservation is proportional to the total derivative of a vector operator, &lt;math&gt;G^{\mu\nu a}\tilde{G}_{\mu\nu}^a = \partial^\mu K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; (this is non-vanishing due to [[instanton]] configurations of the gauge field, which are [[pure gauge]] at the infinity), where the anomalous current &lt;math&gt;K_\mu&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;K_\mu = 2\epsilon_{\mu\nu\alpha\beta} \left( A^{\nu a} \partial^\alpha A^{\beta a} + \frac{1}{3} f^{abc} A^{\nu a} A^{\alpha b} A^{\beta c} \right),&lt;/math&gt;
which is the [[Hodge star|Hodge dual]] of the [[Chern-Simons]] 3-form.

'''Cirrus uncinus''' is a type of [[cirrus cloud]]. The name ''cirrus uncinus'' is derived from [[Latin]], meaning "curly hooks". Also known as ''mares' tails'', these [[cloud]]s are generally sparse in the [[sky]] and very thin.

The clouds occur at high [[altitude]]s, at a temperature of about {{convert|-50|to|-40|C|F|abbr=on}}. They are generally seen when a [[warm front|warm]] or [[occluded front]] is approaching. They are very high in the [[troposphere]] and generally mean that [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], usually [[rain]], is approaching.

'''Continuous analytics''' is a data science process that abandons ETLs and complex batch data pipelines in favor of cloud-native and microservices paradigms. Continuous data processing enables realtime interactions and immediate insights with fewer resources.

== Defined ==
Analytics is the application of mathematics and statistics to big data.  Data scientists write analytics programs to look for solutions to business problems, like forecasting demand or setting an optimal price.

The continuous approach runs multiple stateless engines which concurrently enrich, aggregate, infer and act on the data. Data scientists, dashboards and client apps all access the same raw or real-time data derivatives with proper identity-based security, data masking and versioning in real-time. 

Traditionally data scientists have not been part of IT development teams, like regular Java programmers. This is because their skills set them apart in their own department not normally related to IT, i.e., math, statistics, and data science.  So it is logical to conclude that their approach to writing software code does not enjoy the same efficiencies as the traditional programming team.  In particular traditional programming has adopted the Continuous Delivery approach to writing code and the agile methodology.  That releases software in a continuous circle, called iterations.

[http://hydrosphere.io/blog/continuous-analytics-defined/ Continuous analytics] then is the extension of the continuous delivery software [https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/data-scientists-and-the-analytic-lifecycle development model] to the big data analytics development team.  The goal of the continuous analytics practitioner then is to find ways to incorporate writing analytics code and installing big data software into the agile development model of automatically running unit and functional tests and building the environment system with automated tools.

To make this work means getting data scientists to write their code in the same code repository that regular programmers use so that software can pull it from there and run it through the build process.  It also means saving the configuration of the big data cluster (sets of virtual machines) in some kind of repository as well.  That facilitates sending out analytics code and big data software and objects in the same automated way as the continuous integration process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernpacificreview.com/2016/05/17/continuous-analytics-defined/|title=Continuous Analytics Defined |website=Southern Pacific Review|publisher=Southern Pacific Review|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pushkarev|first1=Stepan|title=Tear down the Wall between Data Science and DevOps|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/tear-down-wall-between-data-science-devops-stepan-pushkarev?trk=prof-post|website=LinkedIN|publisher=LinkedIN|accessdate=17 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Synthesis|article|date=October 2016}}
{{Physical cosmology|comp/struct}}

In [[astronomy]] and [[cosmology]], '''dark fluid''' is an alternative theory to both [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]] and attempts to explain both phenomena in a single framework.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Arbey (2005) "Is it possible to consider Dark Energy and Dark Matter as a same and unique Dark Fluid? https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0506732"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arbey2006&gt;Alexandre Arbey (2006) "Dark Fluid: a complex scalar field to unify dark energy and dark matter https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601274"&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=October 2016}}

Dark fluid proposes that dark matter and dark energy are not separate physical phenomena as previously thought, nor do they have separate origins, but that they are strongly linked together and can be considered as two facets of a single fluid. At galactic scales, the dark fluid behaves like dark matter, and at larger scales its behavior becomes similar to dark energy. Our observations within the scales of the [[Earth]] and the [[Solar System]] are currently insufficient to explain the gravitational effects observed at such larger scales.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Overview ==
Two major conundrums have arisen in [[astrophysics]] and [[cosmology]] in recent times, both dealing with the laws of [[Gravitation|gravity]]. The first was the realization that there aren't enough visible stars or gas inside [[Galaxy|galaxies]] to account for their high rate of [[Galaxy rotation curve|rotation]]. The theory of [[dark matter]] was created to explain this phenomenon. It theorizes that the galaxies are spinning as fast as they are because there is more matter in those galaxies (including our own [[Milky Way]]) than can be seen by counting the mass of stars and gas alone, and that this unseen (dark) matter is invisible because it doesn't interact with the [[electromagnetic force]] from which all forms of light come.

The second conundrum came from the observations of a very specific kind of [[supernova]], known as a [[Type Ia supernova]] used as a [[standard candle]]: when they were compared in distant vs. nearby galaxies, it was found that the distant supernova were fainter, and thus farther away than expected. This implied that the [[Universe]] was not only expanding, but [[accelerating universe|accelerating its expansion]]. The theory of [[dark energy]] was created to explain this phenomenon.

The traditional approach to modeling the effects of gravity assumes that [[general relativity]] is as valid at cosmological scales as it is in the Solar System, where its predictions have been more accurately tested. Not changing the rules of gravity, however, implies the presence of dark matter and dark energy in parts of the Universe where the curvature of the [[space-time]] [[manifold]] is far less than that in the Solar System. It is phenomenologically possible to alter the equations of gravity in regions of low space-time curvature such that the dynamics of the space-time causes what we assign to the presence of dark matter and dark energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Exirifard | first=Q. | year=2010 | title=Phenomenological covariant approach to gravity | journal=General Relativity and Gravitation | doi=10.1007/s10714-010-1073-6 | bibcode = 2011GReGr..43...93E | volume=43 | pages=93–106 | arxiv = 0808.1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dark fluid theory hypothesizes that the dark fluid is a specific kind of fluid whose attractive and repulsive behaviors depend on the local energy density. In this theory, the dark fluid behaves like dark matter in the regions of space where the baryon density is high. The idea is that when the dark fluid is in the presence of matter, it slows down and coagulates around it; this then attracts more dark fluid to coagulate around it, thus amplifying the force of gravity near it. The effect is always present, but only becomes noticeable in the presence of a very large mass such as a galaxy. This description is similar to theories of dark matter, and a special case of the equations of dark fluid reproduces dark matter.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On the other hand, in places where there is relatively little matter, as in the [[Void (astronomy)|voids]] between galactic [[superclusters]], this theory predicts that the dark fluid relaxes and acquires a negative pressure. Thus dark fluid becomes a repulsive force, with an effect similar to that of dark energy.

Dark fluid goes beyond dark matter and dark energy in that it predicts a continuous range of attractive and repulsive qualities under various matter density cases. Indeed, special cases of various other gravitational theories are reproduced by dark fluid, e.g. [[Inflation (cosmology)|inflation]], [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]], [[Quintessence (physics)#Phantom energy|k-essence]], [[f(R) gravity|f(R)]], [[Einstein aether theory|Generalized Einstein-Aether f(K)]], [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]], [[TeVeS]], [[Bi-scalar tensor vector gravity|BSTV]], etc. Dark fluid theory also suggests new models, such as a certain f(K+R) model that suggests interesting corrections to MOND that depend on redshift and density.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

== Simplifying assumptions ==
Dark fluid theory is not treated like a standard [[fluid mechanics]] model, because many of the fluid mechanics equations are too difficult to solve completely. A formalized fluid mechanical approach, like the [[Chaplygin gas|generalized Chaplygin gas model]], would be an ideal method for modeling this theory, but it currently requires too many observational data points to be computationally feasible, and not enough such data points are available to cosmologists yet. A simplification step was undertaken by modeling the theory through scalar field models instead, as is done in other alternative approaches to dark energy and dark matter.&lt;ref name=Arbey2006 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Arbey | first1 = A. | last2 = Mahmoudi | first2 = F. | year = 2007 | title = One-loop quantum corrections to cosmological scalar field potentials | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevD.75.063513 | journal = Physical Review D| volume =  75| issue = | page =  |arxiv = hep-th/0703053 |bibcode = 2007PhRvD..75f3513A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2657">{{Economic systems sidebar}}
A '''dual economy''' is the existence of two separate economic sectors within one country, divided by different levels of development, technology, and different patterns of demand. The concept was originally created by [[Julius Herman Boeke]] to describe the coexistence of modern and traditional economic sectors in a colonial economy.&lt;ref name="Singer"&gt;{{cite book |last=Singer|first=H. W.|title=The Social Science Encyclopedia|edition=2nd|year=1999|origyear=1996|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-20794-0|chapter=Dual economy|editor1-last=Kuper|editor1-first=Adam|editor2-last=Kuper|editor2-first=Jessica|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual economies are common in [[less developed countries]], where one sector is geared to local needs and another to the global export market. Dual economies may exist within the same sector, for example a modern [[plantation]] or other commercial [[agricultural]] entity operating in the midst of traditional cropping systems. [[Sir Arthur Lewis]] used the concept of a dualistic economy as the basis of his [[labour supply]] theory of [[rural-urban migration]]. Lewis distinguished between a rural low-income subsistence sector with surplus population, and an expanding urban capitalist sector (see [[Dual-sector model]]). The urban economy absorbed labour from rural areas (holding down urban wages) until the rural surplus was exhausted.&lt;ref name="Singer"/&gt;

A [[World Bank]] comparison of sectoral growth in Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana and Zimbabwe since 1965 provided evidence against the existence of a basic dual economy model. The research implied that a positive link existed between growth in industry and growth in agriculture. The authors argued that for maximum economic growth, policymakers should have focused on agriculture and services as well as industrial development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sector growth and the dual economy model - evidence from Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Zimbabwe, Volume 1|url=http://econ.worldbank.org/external/default/main?pagePK=64165259&amp;theSitePK=469372&amp;piPK=64165421&amp;menuPK=64166093&amp;entityID=000094946_99092004265544|publisher=The World Bank|author=Blunch, Niels-Hugo|author2=Verner, Dorte}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''dérive'' is published quarterly since 2000 by the [[Vienna]] based ''Verein für Stadtforschung''.&lt;ref name=euro&gt;{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|publisher=Eurozine|accessdate=20 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120065558/http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|archivedate=20 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal publishes articles from a broad range of urbanism disciplines such as [[architecture]], [[urban planning|urban]] and [[land use planning|land-use planning]], [[art]], [[geography]], [[sociology]], or [[philosophy]]. Articles from [[urban sociology]] include contributions from [[Loïc Wacquant]] and [[Saskia Sassen]].

== Name ==
[[Dérive]] is a concept of [[psychogeography]] that includes unplanned journeys through urban space. The individual travels where the subtle aesthetic contours of the surrounding architecture and geography subconsciously direct them, with the ultimate goal of encountering an entirely new and authentic experience.

== Networks ==
The magazine is part of the European network of cultural magazines [[Eurozine]].&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;

==Urbanize==
The journal also hosts the annual festival [http://www.urbanize.at urbanize] on urban issues.

'''Explorer 54''', also called as '''AE-D''' ('''Atmospheric Explorer D'''), was a [[NASA]] [[scientific]] [[satellite]] belonging to series '''Atmosphere Explorer''', being launched on October 6, 1975 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg AFB]] board a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta 2910]] rocket. 

==Characteristics==
The purpose of the Explorer 54 was to continue the investigation begun by [[Explorer 51]] (AE-C) of the chemical processes and energy transfer mechanisms that control the structure and behavior of the earth's atmosphere and [[ionosphere]] in the region of high absorption of [[solar energy]]. This mission was planned to sample the [[high latitude]] regions at the same time that the  [[Explorer 55]] (AE-E) mission was sampling the [[Equator|equatorial]] and low latitude regions. The same type of spacecraft as Explorer 54 was used, and the payload consisted of the same types of instruments except for deletion of the extreme solar [[UV]] monitor and the Bennett [[ion]] [[mass spectrometer]], which were part of the [[Explorer 55]] payload. 

The polar orbit provided the sampling of all latitudes and the [[perigee]] moved through all latitudes in 3 months and all local times in 4 months. Unfortunately, a failure in the solar power panels resulted in the termination of operations on 29 January 1976, after slightly less than 4 months of useful life. However, all the regions at the perigee altitudes were sampled during this time. The spacecraft re-entered the [[atmosphere]] about 1 month after cessation of [[telemetry]]. To continue the correlated observations with the Explorer 55 mission, Explorer 51 was reactivated on 28 February 1976, to replace Explorer 54.&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=June 2009}}

In the context of hardware and [[software system]]s, '''formal verification''' is the act of [[Mathematical proof|proving]] or disproving the [[correctness (computer science)|correctness]] of intended [[algorithms]] underlying a system with respect to a certain [[formal specification]] or property, using [[formal methods]] of [[mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanghavi|first=Alok|title=What is formal verification?|journal=EE Times_Asia|date=May 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Formal verification can be helpful in proving the correctness of systems such as: [[cryptographic protocol]]s, [[Combinational logic|combinational circuit]]s, [[digital circuit]]s with internal memory, and software expressed as source code.

The verification of these systems is done by providing a [[formal proof]] on an abstract [[mathematical model]] of the system, the correspondence between the mathematical model and the nature of the system being otherwise known by construction.  Examples of mathematical objects often used to model systems are: [[finite state machine]]s, [[labelled transition system]]s, [[Petri net]]s, [[vector addition system]]s, [[timed automaton|timed automata]], [[hybrid automata]], [[process algebra]], formal semantics of programming languages such as [[operational semantics]], [[denotational semantics]], [[axiomatic semantics]] and [[Hoare logic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://embedded.eecs.berkeley.edu/research/vis/doc/VisUser/vis_user/node4.html Introduction to Formal Verification], Berkeley University of California, Retrieved November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches ==

One approach and formation is [[model checking]], which consists of a systematically exhaustive exploration of the mathematical model (this is possible for [[Finite model theory|finite models]], but also for some infinite models where infinite sets of states can be effectively represented finitely by using abstraction or taking advantage of symmetry).  Usually this consists of exploring all states and transitions in the model, by using smart and domain-specific abstraction techniques to consider whole groups of states in a single operation and reduce computing time. Implementation techniques include [[state space enumeration]], symbolic state space enumeration, [[abstract interpretation]], [[symbolic simulation]], abstraction refinement.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}  The properties to be verified are often described in [[temporal logic]]s, such as [[linear temporal logic]] (LTL), [[Property Specification Language]] (PSL), [[SystemVerilog]] Assertions (SVA),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = SystemVerilog Assertions Handbook|edition = 4th |last1 = Cohen|first1 = Ben| first2=Srinivasan |last2 =Venkataramanan |first3=Ajeetha |last3 =Kumari |first4=Lisa |last4 =Piper | publisher = CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1518681448}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[computational tree logic]] (CTL). The great advantage of model checking is that it is often fully automatic; its primary disadvantage is that it does not in general scale to large systems; symbolic models are typically limited to a few hundred bits of state, while explicit state enumeration requires the state space being explored to be relatively small.

Another approach is deductive verification.  It consists of generating from the system and its specifications (and possibly other annotations) a collection of mathematical ''proof obligations'', the truth of which imply conformance of the system to its specification, and discharging these obligations using either interactive theorem provers (such as [[HOL theorem prover|HOL]], [[ACL2]], [[Isabelle (theorem prover)|Isabelle]],  [[Coq]] or [[Prototype Verification System|PVS]]), automatic theorem provers, or [[satisfiability modulo theories]] (SMT) solvers. This approach has the disadvantage that it typically requires the user to understand in detail why the system works correctly, and to convey this information to the verification system, either in the form of a sequence of theorems to be proved or in the form of specifications of system components (e.g. functions or procedures) and perhaps subcomponents (such as loops or data structures).

=== Software ===

Formal verification of software programs involves proving that a program satisfies a formal specification of its behavior. Subareas of formal verification include deductive verification (see above), [[abstract interpretation]], [[automated theorem proving]], [[type system]]s, and [[formal methods#Lightweight formal methods|lightweight formal methods]]. A promising type-based verification approach is [[dependent types|dependently typed programming]], in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions' specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications. Fully featured dependently typed languages support deductive verification as a special case.

Another complementary approach is [[program derivation]], in which efficient code is produced from [[functional programming|functional]] specifications by a series of correctness-preserving steps. An example of this approach is the [[Bird–Meertens formalism]], and this approach can be seen as another form of [[correct by construction|correctness by construction]].

These techniques can be ''[[soundness|sound]]'', meaning that the verified properties can be logically deduced from the semantics, or ''unsound'', meaning that there is no such guarantee. A sound technique yields a result only once it has searched the entire space of possibilities. An example of an unsound technique is one that searches only a subset of the possibilities, for instance only integers up to a certain number, and give a "good-enough" result. Techniques can also be ''[[decidability (logic)|decidable]]'', meaning that their algorithmic implementations are [[Termination analysis|guaranteed to terminate]] with an answer, or undecidable, meaning that they may never terminate. Because they are bounded, unsound techniques are often more likely to be decidable than sound ones.

== Verification and validation ==
{{main article|Verification and validation}}

[[Verification and validation|Verification]] is one aspect of testing a product's fitness for purpose. Validation is the complementary aspect. Often one refers to the overall checking process as [[Verification and validation|V &amp; V]].

* '''Validation''': "Are we trying to make the right thing?", i.e., is the product specified to the user's actual needs?
* '''Verification''': "Have we made what we were trying to make?", i.e., does the product conform to the specifications?

The verification process consists of static/structural and dynamic/behavioral aspects. E.g., for a software product one can inspect the source code (static) and run against specific test cases (dynamic). Validation usually can be done only dynamically, i.e., the product is tested by putting it through typical and atypical usages ("Does it satisfactorily meet all [[use case]]s?").

== Automated program repair ==
{{main|Automatic bug fixing}}

Program repair is performed with respect to an [[Oracle (computability)|oracle]], encompassing the desired functionality of the program which is used for validation of the generated fix. A simple example is a test-suite—the input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program. A variety of techniques are employed, most notably using [[satisfiability modulo theories]] (SMT) solvers,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Automatic Repair of Buggy If Conditions and Missing Preconditions with SMT|author1=Favio DeMarco |author2=Jifeng Xuan |author3=Daniel Le Berre |author4=Martin Monperrus |date = 2014|journal = Proceedings of the 6th International Workshop on Constraints in Software Testing, Verification, and Analysis (CSTVA 2014)|pages = 30–39|doi = 10.1145/2593735.2593740|pmid = |arxiv = 1404.3186|isbn = 9781450328470}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[genetic programming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.proquest.com/openview/f837f11066e9c9552df9e497064d6d80/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=21418&amp;casa_token=X2fQSRNgLNwAAAAA:CBjvmrcBLZRqV7kjC-MY74s0wF68lhBvLF6rV4DWZkalzo2KdlUUzuMU38YgSmXGbwEL2NAr4w |title = GenProg: A Generic Method for Automatic Software Repair|author1=Le Goues, ThanhVu Nguyen |author2=Forrest, Weimer |date = 2012|journal = IEEE Trans. Software Eng. », 1, 38, 2012, 54-72|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; using evolutionary computing to generate and evaluate possible candidates for fixes. The former method is deterministic, while the latter is randomized.

Program repair combines techniques from formal verification and [[program synthesis]]. Fault-localization techniques in formal verification are used to compute program points which might be possible bug-locations, which can be targeted by the synthesis modules. Repair systems often focus on a small pre-defined class of bugs in order to reduce the search space. Industrial use is limited owing to the computational cost of existing techniques.

== Industry use ==

The growth in complexity of designs increases the importance of formal verification techniques in the [[hardware industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|doi=10.1109/LICS.2003.1210044|year=2003|last1=Harrison|first1=J.|title=18th Annual IEEE Symposium of Logic in Computer Science, 2003.

Important aspects of hardware design are amenable to automated proof methods, making formal verification easier to introduce and more productive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~jrh13/slides/types-04sep99/slides1.pdf |title=Formal Verification in Industry |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global Engineering Education''' is a field of study that focuses on the impact of [[globalization]] on the [[engineering industry]].

== History ==
Over the past decade or so educators and researchers have made an effort to transform engineering education in light of global trends in the profession.  In 1985, the [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] issued a study that spotlighted the need for universities to graduate engineers with professional skills.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Education and Practice in the United States: Foundations of our Techno-Economic Future. 1985, National Research Council: Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; This message was reinforced through a 1994 joint report published by the Engineering Deans Council and [[ASEE]]&lt;ref&gt;Dowell, E., E. Baum, and J. McTague, Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World. American Soc. for Engineering Education, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that stated, “Today, engineering colleges … must educate their students to work as part of teams, communicate well, and understand the economic, social, environmental and international context of their professional activities.”

== Definitions ==

===Global Competency===
[[Global competency]] is essential for engineers from any country who now compete in an international market for engineering know-how.  No longer is [[cultural sensitivity]] needed only for [[product design]] destined for diverse markets. Increasingly, successful entry into the engineering profession requires significant intercultural skills in order to join efficient and productive collaborations with diverse engineering colleagues. Those colleagues may be encountered “virtually” at a distance, in person at an international site, or next door in the office of a [[multinational corporation]]. Outsourcing is increasing, not only for products but also for processes, including highly technical engineering work. Projects are distributed across sites and effective collaboration requires professionals who can work productively with colleagues who are very different from themselves.&lt;ref&gt;B. I. Allert, D. L. Atkinson, E. A. Groll, E. D. Hirleman, [http://digitalcommons.uri.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1009&amp;context=ojgee Making the Case for Global Engineering: Building Foreign Language Collaborations for Designing, Implementing, and Assessing Programs]. Online Journal for Global Engineering Education, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Resources ==
[[IEEE Education Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieee.org/edsoc/ The Education Society]&lt;/ref&gt; belongs to the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) and its major objective is to strive a global leader in engineering education. The organization of education engineering worldwide conferences as they are the EDUCON and the FIE - Frontiers in Education Conference with an open view of all the publications included there as well the integration of engineering educator leaders along all the world in the Administration Committee allows a world integration of different views and perspectives. Newly publication IEEE-RITA (Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías del Aprendizaje - Revista Iberoamericana de Tecnologías de Aprendizagem - Latin-American Learning Technologies Journal) incorporates a new vision of technology and engineering education in Spanish and Portuguese languages.&lt;ref&gt;R.

*'''[[Acceleration]]''' – In [[physics]], '''acceleration''' is the [[Rate (mathematics)|rate]] of change of [[velocity]] of an object with respect to time. An object's acceleration is the net result of any and all [[force]]s acting on the object, as described by [[Newton's Second Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Principles of Mechanics |first=Henry |last=Crew |publisher=BiblioBazaar, LLC |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-559-36871-4 |pages=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International System of Units|SI]] unit for acceleration is [[metre per second squared]] {{nowrap|(m s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;).}} Accelerations are [[Euclidean vector|vector]] quantities (they have [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] and [[Direction (geometry)|direction]]) and add according to the [[parallelogram law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Relativity and Common Sense |first=Hermann |last=Bondi |pages=3 |publisher=Courier Dover Publications |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-486-24021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Physics the Easy Way |pages=27 |first=Robert L. |last=Lehrman |publisher=Barron's Educational Series |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-7641-0236-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Vector space|vector]], the calculated net [[force]] is equal to the product of the object's mass (a [[Scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity) and its acceleration.

*'''[[Accuracy and precision]]''' –
*'''[[Ackermann steering geometry]]''' – is a geometric arrangement of linkages in the [[steering]] of a [[automobile|car]] or other [[vehicle]] designed to solve the problem of wheels on the inside and outside of a turn needing to trace out [[circles]] of different [[radius|radii]]. It was invented by the German carriage builder [[Georg Lankensperger]] in Munich in 1817, then patented by his agent in England, [[Rudolph Ackermann]] (1764–1834) in 1818 for horse-drawn carriages. [[Erasmus Darwin]] may have a prior claim as the inventor dating from 1758.&lt;ref &gt;[https://www.jstor.org/pss/532121 Erasmus Darwin's Improved Design for Steering Carriages] by Desmond King-Hele , 2002, The Royal Society, London.

*'''[[Acoustic droplet ejection]]'''– (ADE) uses a pulse of ultrasound to move low volumes of fluids (typically nanoliters or picoliters) without any physical contact.  This technology focuses acoustic energy into a fluid sample in order to eject droplets as small as a [[Litre|picoliter]].  ADE technology is a very gentle process. This feature makes the technology suitable for a wide variety of applications including [[proteomics]] and cell-based assays.
*'''[[Active cooling]]''' – An '''active cooling''' system is one that involves the use of energy to cool something, as opposed to [[passive cooling]] that uses no energy.  Such systems circulate a [[coolant]] to [[Heat transfer|transfer heat]] from one place to another. The coolant is either a gas, such as in [[air cooling]] of [[Computer cooling|computers]], or a liquid such as in a  [[Radiator (engine cooling)|car engine]]. In the latter case, liquid is pumped to transfer heat from the engine to the radiator, which in turn is cooled by passing air over it.  Other active cooling systems make use of a [[Heat pump and refrigeration cycle|refrigeration cycle]]. 
*'''[[Actual mechanical advantage]]''' – The '''actual mechanical advantage''' (AMA) is the mechanical advantage determined by physical measurement of the input and output forces. Actual mechanical advantage takes into account energy loss due to deflection, friction, and wear.
*'''[[Adjoint equation]]''' – is a [[linear differential equation]], usually derived from its primal equation using [[integration by parts]].  Gradient values with respect to a particular quantity of interest can be efficiently calculated by solving the adjoint equation. Methods based on solution of adjoint equations are used in [[wing shape optimization]], fluid flow control and [[uncertainty quantification]]. For example &lt;math&gt; dX_t = a(X_t)dt + b(X_t)dW&lt;/math&gt; this is an [[Itō calculus|Itō]] stochastic differential equation. Now by using Euler scheme, we integrate the parts of this equation and get another equation, &lt;math&gt; X_{n+1} = X_n  +  a \Delta t + \zeta b \sqrt{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;, here &lt;math&gt;\zeta&lt;/math&gt; is a random variable, later one is an adjoint equation.
*'''[[Aerodynamics]]''' – is the study of the motion of [[air]], particularly its interaction with a solid object, such as an [[airplane]] wing. It is a sub-field of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[gas dynamics]], and many aspects of aerodynamics theory are common to these fields.
*'''[[Agitator (device)]]''' –
*'''[[Air handler]]''' – An '''air handler''', or '''air handling unit''' (often abbreviated to '''AHU'''), is a device used to regulate and circulate air as part of a heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning ([[HVAC]]) system.&lt;ref name=ASHRAE&gt;{{cite book|title=2008 ASHRAE handbook : heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning systems and equipment|year=2008|publisher=ASHRAE American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers|location=Atlanta, Ga.|isbn=9781933742335|edition=Inch-Pound}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Air compressor]]''' –  is a device that [[energy conversion|converts power]] (using an electric motor, diesel or gasoline engine, etc.) into [[potential energy]] stored in pressurized air (i.e., [[compressed air]]). By one of several methods, an air compressor forces more and more air into a storage tank, increasing the pressure. When tank pressure reaches its engineered upper limit the air compressor shuts off. The compressed air, then, is held in the tank until called into use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/home/how-to/a151/how-air-compressors-work/|title=How Do Air Compressors Work?|date=2015-03-18|newspaper=Popular Mechanics|access-date=2017-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Air conditioning can be used in both domestic and commercial environments.
*'''[[Air preheater]]''' – (APH) is any device designed to heat [[air]] before another process (for example,  [[combustion]] in a [[boiler]]) with the primary objective of increasing the thermal efficiency of the process. They may be used alone or to replace a [[recuperator|recuperative]] heat system or to replace a steam coil.
*'''[[Airflow]]''' –  '''Airflow,''' or '''air flow''' is the movement of air from one area to another. The primary cause of airflow is the existence of [[pressure gradient]]s. Air behaves in a [[fluid]] manner, meaning particles naturally flow from areas of higher pressure to those where the pressure is lower. [[Atmospheric pressure|Atmospheric air pressure]] is directly related to altitude, temperature, and composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/winds-and-the-pressure-gradient-force-1434440|title=How Do Air Pressure Differences Cause Winds?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;ASHRAE, ed. ''ASHRAE Handbook of Fundamentals 2017''. Atlanta, GA: American Society of Heating, Air-Conditioning and Refrigeration Engineers, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[engineering]], airflow is a measurement of the amount of [[air]] per unit of time that flows through a particular device.
*'''[[Allowance (engineering)|Allowance]]''' – is a planned deviation between an exact dimension and a [[Real versus nominal value|nominal]] or [[theoretical]] dimension, or between an intermediate-stage dimension and an intended final dimension. The unifying abstract concept is that a certain amount of difference ''allows for'' some known factor of compensation or interference. For example, an area of excess metal may be left because it is needed to complete subsequent machining. Common cases are listed below. An ''allowance,'' which is a ''planned'' deviation from an ideal, is contrasted with a ''[[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]],'' which accounts for expected but unplanned deviations.

It also includes modification of vehicles. Manufacturing domain deals with the creation and assembling the whole parts of automobiles is also included in it.The automotive engineering field is research -intensive and involves direct application of mathematical models and formulas. The study of automotive engineering is to design, develop, fabricate, and testing vehicles or vehicle components from the concept stage to production stage. Production, development, and manufacturing are the three major functions in this field.
*'''[[Axle]]''' – is a central shaft for a [[rotation|rotating]] wheel or gear. On wheeled vehicles, the axle may be fixed to the wheels, rotating with them, or fixed to the vehicle, with the wheels rotating around the axle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanical Engineering design|date=2010|publisher=McGraw Hill|isbn=0073529281|pages=360|edition=9th|url=https://www.bookdepository.com/Shigleys-Mechanical-Engineering-Design-Richard-G-Budynas/9780073529288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the former case, [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] or [[Bushing (bearing)|bushings]] are provided at the mounting points where the axle is supported.  In the latter case, a bearing or bushing sits inside a central hole in the wheel to allow the wheel or gear to rotate around the axle.  Sometimes, especially on bicycles, the latter type axle is referred to as a ''[[spindle (tool)|spindle]]''.

*'''[[Ball detent]]''' – is a simple mechanical arrangement used to hold a moving part in a temporarily fixed position relative to another part. Usually the moving parts slide with respect to each other, or one part rotates within the other.
*'''[[Ball screw]]''' – is a mechanical [[linear actuator]] that translates rotational motion to linear motion with little [[friction]].  A threaded shaft provides a helical raceway for [[ball bearing]]s which act as a precision screw. As well as being able to apply or withstand high thrust loads, they can do so with minimum internal friction. 
*'''[[Ball spline]]''' – '''Ball splines''' (Ball Spline [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s) are a special type of [[linear motion bearing]] that are used to provide nearly frictionless linear motion while allowing the member to transmit torque simultaneously. There are [[Groove (engineering)|grooves]] ground along the length of the shaft (thus forming [[Rotating spline|splines]]) for the recirculating ground balls to run inside. The outer shell that houses the balls is called a nut rather than a [[Bushing (bearing)|bushing]], but is not a nut in the traditional sense—it is not free to rotate about the shaft, but is free to travel up and down the shaft. 
*'''[[Beale Number]]''' – is a parameter that characterizes the performance of [[Stirling engine]]s.  It is often used to estimate the power output of a Stirling engine design.  For engines operating with a high temperature differential, typical values for the Beale number range from ( 0.11 ) to ( 0.15 ); where a larger number indicates higher performance.
*'''[[Bearing (mechanical)|Bearing]]''' – is a [[machine element]] that constrains relative motion to only the desired motion, and reduces [[friction]] between [[moving parts]].
*'''[[Bearing pressure]]''' – is a particular case of [[contact mechanics]] often occurring in cases where a convex surface (male cylinder or sphere) contacts a concave surface (female cylinder or sphere: [[Boring (manufacturing)|bore]] or [[Spherical bearing|hemispherical cup]]). Excessive contact pressure can lead to a typical bearing failure such as a plastic deformation similar to [[peening]]. This problem is also referred to as '''bearing resistance'''.&lt;ref name="Eurocode3"&gt;EN 1993-1-8:2005 ''[[Eurocode 3]]: Design of steel structures - Part 1-8: Design of joints''&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Bearing surface]]''' – is the [[area]] of contact between two objects. It usually is used in reference to [[bolted joint]]s and [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]], but can be applied to a wide variety of engineering applications. On a [[screw]] the bearing area loosely refers to the underside of the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1990|p=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Strictly speaking, the bearing area refers to the area of the screw head that directly bears on the part being fastened.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Fastener terms | url = http://www.canadianstainless.ca/page9.html | accessdate = 2009-06-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For a cylindrical bearing it is the [[projected area]] perpendicular to the applied force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Low|Bevis|1908|p=115}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  On a [[spring (device)|spring]] the bearing area refers to the amount of area on the top or bottom surface of the spring in contact with the constraining part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Helical Compression Spring Terminology | url = http://www.masterspring.com/technical_resources/helical_compression_spring_terminology/default.html | accessdate = 2009-06-29}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ways of [[machine tool]]s, such as dovetail slides, box ways, prismatic ways, and other types of machine slides are also bearing surfaces. 
*'''[[Belt (mechanical) |Belt]]''' –  is a loop of flexible material used to link two or more rotating [[Drive shaft|shafts]] mechanically, most often parallel. Belts may be used as a source of motion, to [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmit power]] efficiently or to track relative movement. Belts are looped over [[pulley]]s and may have a twist between the pulleys, and the shafts need not be parallel.
*'''[[Belt friction]]''' –  is a term describing the friction forces between a [[Belt (mechanical)|belt]] and a surface, such as a belt wrapped around a [[bollard]]. When one end of the belt is being pulled only part of this force is transmitted to the other end wrapped about a surface. The friction force increases with the amount of wrap about a surface and makes it so the [[tension (physics)|tension]] in the belt can be different at both ends of the belt. Belt friction can be modeled by the [[Capstan equation|Belt friction equation]].&lt;ref name=Attaway&gt;{{cite conference | last = Attaway | first = Stephen W. | title = The Mechanics of Friction in Rope Rescue | url = http://www.jrre.org/att_frict.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = February 1, 2010 | conference = International Technical Rescue Symposium | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

  |publisher=[[NASA]]
  |url=http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2012/47/
}}&lt;/ref&gt; corresponding to the galaxy '''3C 348'''.

==Observation==

During a survey of bright radio sources in the mid-20th century, astronomers found a very bright radio source in the constellation Hercules. The radio source is strongest in the middle range frequency and emits [[synchrotron radiation]], suggesting the source of radio emission may be gravitational interaction. In 1959, astronomers from the Radio Astronomy Group (later the [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group]]) detected the radio source using the Cambridge Interferometer of the Cavendish Observatory in [[Cambridge University]] in [[United Kingdom]], including it in the [[Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Sources]] (3C) as 3C 348, the 348th object detected by the survey.

==Characteristics==

===Galaxy===

The galaxy, 3C 348, is a supergiant [[elliptical galaxy]]. It is classified as type E3 to E4 of the updated Hubble-de Vaucouleurs extended galaxy morphological classification scheme. Little else is known about the galaxy.

3C 348, the galaxy at the image center, appears to be a relatively normal elliptical galaxy in visible light. When imaged in radio waves, however, plasma jets over one million light years long appear. Detailed analyses indicate that the galaxy is actually over 1,000 times more massive (approx. 10{{sup|15}} [[solar mass]]es) than our [[Milky Way Galaxy]], and the central [[black hole]] is nearly 1,000 times more massive (approx. 4 billion [[solar mass]]es) than the black hole at our Milky Way's center, one of the [[List of most massive black holes|largest known]]. The physics that creates the jets is poorly understood, with a likely energy source being matter ejected perpendicular to the accretion disc of the central black hole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD |date=5 December 2012 |title=Plasma Jets from Radio Galaxy Hercules A |access-date=}}Portions of this [[public domain]] text are used here.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Huxley''' is a crater in the [[Hellas quadrangle]] of [[Mars]], located at 63.0°S  latitude and 259.2°W  longitude.  It is 107.0&amp;nbsp;km in diameter and was named after [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], and the name was approved in 1973 by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (WGPSN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature {{!}} Huxley|url=http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/Feature/2595|website=usgs.gov|publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]]|accessdate=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huxley is due south of the larger [[Secchi (Martian crater)|Secchi]], other nearby named craters include [[Redi (crater)|Redi]] to the northwest, Laylá to the northeast and the [[Heinlein (Martian crater)|Heinlein]]-[[Weinbaum (Martian crater)|Weinbaum]] crater pair to the east-southeast, no nearby named craters are located south but another crater named [[Gilbert (Martian crater)|Gilbert]] is in the southwest.

'''Jean Danysz''' (11 March 1884 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1914) born '''Jan Kazimierz Danysz''', was a French physicist of [[Poland|Polish]] extraction. He was an assistant of [[Maria Sklodowska-Curie|Maria Skłodowska-Curie]] and notable in the development of [[Beta decay|beta]] spectrometry.

Danysz made considerable advances on the [[Spectrometer|magnetic deflection]] techniques of [[Otto von Baeyer|Baeyer]], [[Otto Hahn|Hahn]] and [[Lise Meitner|Meitner]], placing the source (he used radium) in a capillary tube under a slit, with a photographic plate in the same horizontal plane. By this means the known number of lines (later understood to be [[Internal conversion|conversion lines]]) superimposed on the beta energy spectrum of RaB + RaC went from 9 to 27 (later work by [[Harold Roper Robinson|Robinson]] and Rutherford found 64; 16 from RaB and 48 from RaC).&lt;ref&gt;RaA was a placeholder for an isotope later identified as &lt;sup&gt;218&lt;/sup&gt;Po; RaB for an isotope later identified as &lt;sup&gt;214&lt;/sup&gt;Pb - see [[Radium series]]&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his doctoral thesis in 1913, and by 1914 he was considered by [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]] as a leading researcher into [[beta decay]],&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Carsten (editor) ''Controversy and Consensus: Nuclear Beta Decay 1911-1934'' Chapter 2.4 Deflection experiments. p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; but he did no further work. He enlisted in the French army in 1914 and  was killed in action near [[Cormicy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://vlecalvez.free.fr/Jean_Danysz.html Extract from ''Livre d'or de l'École de physique et de chimie'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lebanese Marine and Wildlife Museum'''  ({{lang-ar|المتحف اللبناني للحياة البحرية و البرية}}, al-''matḥaf al-lubnani lil-hayat al-bahriya wa al-bariya'') is a [[zoological museum]] in [[Jeita]], and is one of the largest such museums in the middle east. Over 90% of the specimens in the museum were collected from Lebanon by Dr. Jamal Younes (president and owner of the museum).

Its main goals are to study Lebanon's ecosystem, encourage preservation, and maintain a scientific archive of Lebanon's wildlife and the Mediterranean marine life.

== History ==
The Museum was first opened in Tyre in 2001 by Dr. Jamal Younes, who has been collecting and preserving specimens for more than 30 years. After the collection grew too large, there was no more space for some  specimens, so it was decided to construct a new museum large enough to display all the specimens in Jeita.

== Dr. Jamal Younes ==
Born and raised in [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], a peninsula known for its rich history and ties to the sea, and distinguished for having both sandy and rocky beaches, creating a unique and rich marine ecosystem.

While studying Dentistry in Europe, he also learned taxidermy. After his graduation, he opening a clinic for orthodontics in Tyre, where he would  go out diving every night, most of the times on his own. Looking to find something new to add to  his collection and as time passed he amassed the biggest collection of taxidermy marine and wildlife in the Middle East, which was the basis of his Museum which today contains more than 5000  specimens.

== Collections ==
The Lebanese Marine and Wildlife Museum  has over 2000 species with over 5000 specimens on display. The museum currently contains 6 Exhibits which show off Lebanon's rich and diverse ecosystems, which are:

=== Mammals  ===
Displaying over 30 of Lebanon's mammals which once roamed freely the forests of Lebanon, most of which are now critically endangered, due to deforestation, indiscriminate hunting and habitat destruction.

=== Birds ===

=== Reptiles ===
over 20 species of lizards and 30 species of snakes collected from across Lebanon are on display

=== Minerals, Gems and Fossils ===

[[File:Daniel KAHNEMAN.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Daniel Kahneman]]]]
In [[cognitive psychology]] and [[decision theory]], '''loss aversion''' refers to people's tendency to prefer avoiding [[Loss function|losses]] to acquiring equivalent gains: it is better to not lose $5 than to find $5. The principle is very prominent in the domain of [[economics]]. What distinguishes loss aversion from [[risk aversion]] is that the [[utility]] of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1992|title=Advances in prospect theory: Cumulative representation of uncertainty|journal=Journal of Risk and Uncertainty|volume=5|pages=297–323|doi=10.1007/BF00122574|author1=Kahneman, D.|author2=Tversky, A.|lastauthoramp=yes|number=4|citeseerx=10.1.1.320.8769}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss aversion was first identified by [[Amos Tversky]] and [[Daniel Kahneman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=|year=1979|title=Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision under Risk|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1914185?origin=JSTOR-pdf|journal=Econometrica|volume=47|pages=263–291|doi=10.2307/1914185|via=|author1=Kahneman, D.|author2=Tversky, A.|lastauthoramp=yes|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss aversion implies that one who loses $100 will lose more satisfaction than another person will gain satisfaction from a $100 [[Windfall gain|windfall]]. In [[marketing]], the use of [[trial period]]s and [[Rebate (marketing)|rebates]] tries to take advantage of the buyer's tendency to value the [[Good (economics)|good]] more after the buyer incorporates it in the status quo. In past [[behavioral economics]] studies, users participate up until the threat of loss equals any incurred gains.  Recent methods established by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin in [[experimental economics]] illustrates the role of expectation, wherein an individual's belief about an outcome can create an instance of loss aversion, whether or not a tangible change of state has occurred.

Note that whether a transaction is [[Framing effect (psychology)|framed]] as a loss or as a gain is very important to this calculation: would you rather get a $5 discount, or avoid a $5 surcharge? The same change in price framed differently has a significant effect on consumer behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Irwin P., Sandra L. Schneider, and Gary J. Gaeth. "All frames are not created equal: A typology and critical analysis of framing effects." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 76.2 (1998): 149-188.&lt;/ref&gt; Although traditional economists consider this "[[endowment effect]]" and all other effects of loss aversion to be completely [[Irrationality|irrational]], that is why it is so important to the fields of [[marketing]] and [[behavioral finance]]. The effect of loss aversion in a marketing setting was demonstrated in a study of consumer reaction to price changes to insurance policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dawes|first=J.|year=2004|title=Price Changes and Defection Levels in a Subscription-type Market: Can an Estimation Model Really Predict Defection Levels?|journal=Journal of Services Marketing|volume=18|issue=1|pages=35–44|doi=10.1108/08876040410520690}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found price increases had twice the effect on [[customer switching]], compared to price decreases. Similarly, users in behavioral and experimental economics studies decided to cease participation in iterative money-making games when the threat of loss was close to the expenditure of effort, even when the user stood to further their gains.

Humans may be hardwired to be loss averse due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains: for an organism operating close to the edge of survival, the loss of a day's food could cause death, whereas the gain of an extra day's food would not cause an extra day of life (unless the food could be easily and effectively stored).

Loss aversion was first proposed as an explanation for the [[endowment effect]]—the fact that people place a higher value on a good that they own than on an identical good that they do not own—by Kahneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahneman |first=D. |last2=Knetsch |first2=J. |last3=Thaler |first3=R. |year=1990 |title=Experimental Test of the endowment effect and the Coase Theorem |journal=[[Journal of Political Economy]] |volume=98 |issue=6 |pages=1325–1348 |jstor=2937761 |doi=10.1086/261737}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loss aversion and the endowment effect lead to a violation of the [[Coase theorem]]—that "the allocation of resources will be independent of the assignment of property rights when costless trades are possible" (p.&amp;nbsp;1326).

In several studies, the authors demonstrated that the endowment effect could be explained by loss aversion but not five alternatives: (1) transaction costs, (2) misunderstandings, (3) habitual [[Bargaining power|bargaining behaviors]], (4) income effects, or (5) [[trophy]] effects. In each experiment half of the subjects were randomly assigned a good and asked for the minimum amount they would be willing to sell it for while the other half of the subjects were given nothing and asked for the maximum amount they would be willing to spend to buy the good. Since the value of the good is fixed and individual valuation of the good varies from this fixed value only due to sampling variation, the supply and demand curves should be perfect mirrors of each other and thus half the goods should be traded. The authors also ruled out the explanation that lack of experience with trading would lead to the endowment effect by conducting repeated markets.

The first two alternative explanations—that under-trading was due to transaction costs or misunderstanding—were tested by comparing goods markets to induced-value markets under the same rules. If it was possible to trade to the optimal level in induced value markets, under the same rules, there should be no difference in goods markets.

The results showed drastic differences between induced-value markets and goods markets. The [[median]] prices of buyers and sellers in induced-value markets matched almost every time leading to near perfect market efficiency, but goods markets sellers had much higher selling prices than buyers' buying prices. This effect was consistent over trials, indicating that this was not due to inexperience with the procedure or the market. Since the transaction cost that could have been due to the procedure was equal in the induced-value and goods markets, transaction costs were eliminated as an explanation for the endowment effect.

The third alternative explanation was that people have habitual bargaining behaviors, such as overstating their minimum selling price or understating their maximum bargaining price, that may spill over from strategic interactions where these behaviors are useful to the laboratory setting where they are sub-optimal. An experiment was conducted to address this by having the clearing prices selected at random. Buyers who indicated a willingness-to-pay higher than the randomly drawn price got the good, and vice versa for those who indicated a lower [[Willingness to pay|WTP]]. Likewise, sellers who indicated a lower willingness-to-accept than the randomly drawn price sold the good and vice versa. This incentive compatible value elicitation method did not eliminate the endowment effect but did rule out habitual bargaining behavior as an alternative explanation.

Income effects were ruled out by giving one third of the participants mugs, one third chocolates, and one third neither mug nor chocolate. They were then given the option of trading the mug for the chocolate or vice versa and those with neither were asked to merely choose between mug and chocolate. Thus, wealth effects were controlled for those groups who received mugs and chocolate. The results showed that 86% of those starting with mugs chose mugs, 10% of those starting with chocolates chose mugs, and 56% of those with nothing chose mugs. This ruled out income effects as an explanation for the endowment effect. Also, since all participants in the group had the same good, it could not be considered a "trophy", eliminating the final alternative explanation.

Thus, the five alternative explanations were eliminated in the following ways:
* 1 &amp; 2: Induced-value market vs. consumption goods market;
* 3: Incentive compatible value elicitation procedure;
* 4 &amp; 5: Choice between endowed or alternative good.

==Questions about its existence==
Recently, studies have questioned the existence of loss aversion. In several studies examining the effect of losses in decision making under risk and uncertainty no loss aversion was found.&lt;ref&gt;Erev, Ert &amp; Yechiam, 2008; Ert &amp; Erev, 2008; Harinck, Van Dijk, Van Beest, &amp; Mersmann, 2007; Kermer, Driver-Linn, Wilson, &amp; Gilbert, 2006; Nicolau, 2012; Yechiam &amp; Telpaz, in press&lt;/ref&gt; There are several explanations for these findings: one, is that loss aversion does not exist in small payoff magnitudes; the other, is that the generality of the loss aversion pattern is lower than that thought previously. Finally, losses may have an effect on attention but not on the weighting of outcomes; as suggested, for instance, by the fact that losses lead to more autonomic arousal than gains even in the absence of loss aversion.&lt;ref&gt;Hochman &amp; Yechiam, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This latter effect is sometimes known as Loss Attention.&lt;ref&gt;Yechiam &amp; Hochman, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Even in a non-risky domain, prospective affective judgments about gains and losses show that loss aversion is magnitude dependent such that for low magnitudes there is no loss aversion &lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, S., Sahay, A., Pammi, V.S.C., &amp; Srinivasan, N. (2017). Is loss-aversion magnitude-dependent? Measuring prospective affective judgments regarding gains and losses. [http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16611/jdm16611.pdf Judgment and Decision Making], 12(1), 81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss aversion may be more salient when people compete. Gill and Prowse (2012) provide experimental evidence that people are loss averse around reference points given by their expectations in a competitive environment with real effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gill, David  |author2=Victoria Prowse  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=A structural analysis of disappointment aversion in a real effort competition |journal=American Economic Review |volume=102 |number=1 |pages=469–503 |year=2012 |ssrn=1578847 |doi=10.1257/aer.102.1.469|citeseerx=10.1.1.650.2595  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Gal]] (2006) argued that many of the phenomena commonly attributed to loss aversion, including the status quo bias, the endowment effect, and the preference for safe over risky options, are more parsimoniously explained by [[cognitive inertia|inertia]] than by a loss/gain asymmetry. Gal and Rucker (2018) made similar arguments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=David|last2=Rucker|first2=Derek D.|date=2018-04-20|title=The Loss of Loss Aversion: Will It Loom Larger Than Its Gain?|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1047|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=497–516|doi=10.1002/jcpy.1047|issn=1057-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gal|first=David|last2=Rucker|first2=Derek D.|date=2018-04-16|title=Loss Aversion, Intellectual Inertia, and a Call for a More Contrarian Science: A Reply to Simonson &amp; Kivetz and Higgins &amp; Liberman|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1044|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|language=en|volume=28|issue=3|pages=533–539|doi=10.1002/jcpy.1044|issn=1057-7408}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==In nonhuman subjects==
In 2005, experiments were conducted on the ability of [[capuchin monkey]]s to use money. After several months of training, the monkeys began showing behavior considered to reflect understanding of the concept of a medium of exchange. They exhibited the same propensity to avoid perceived losses demonstrated by human subjects and investors.&lt;ref name = "Dubner"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/05/magazine/05FREAK.html | last = Dubner | first = Stephen J. | authorlink = Stephen J.

While a subsequent study suggested that the 2005 results were not indicative of loss aversion because of timing differences in the presentation of gains and losses to the monkeys,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silberberg|first=Alan|last2=Roma|first2=Peter G|last3=Huntsberry|first3=Mary E|last4=Warren-Boulton|first4=Frederick R|last5=Sakagami|first5=Takayuki|last6=Ruggiero|first6=Angela M|last7=Suomi|first7=Stephen J|date=March 2008|title=On Loss Aversion in Capuchin Monkeys|journal=Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior|volume=89|issue=2|pages=145–155|doi=10.1901/jeab.2008-89-145|issn=0022-5002|pmc=2251327|pmid=18422015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a follow-up 2008 study by Laksminaryanan, Chen and Santos ruled out this alternative explanation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Expectation-based ==
Expectation-based loss aversion is a phenomenon in behavioral economics. When the expectations of an individual fail to match reality, they lose an amount of utility from the lack of experiencing fulfillment of these expectations. Analytical framework by Botond Kőszegi and Matthew Rabin provides a methodology through which such behavior can be classified and even predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kőszegi|first=Botond|last2=Rabin|first2=Matthew|date=2006-11-01|title=A Model of Reference-Dependent Preferences|url=http://qje.oxfordjournals.org/content/121/4/1133|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|language=en|volume=121|issue=4|pages=1133–1165|doi=10.1093/qje/121.4.1133|issn=0033-5533|citeseerx=10.1.1.197.5740}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual's most recent expectations influences loss aversion in outcomes outside the status quo; a shopper intending to buy a pair of shoes on sale experiences loss aversion when the pair she had intended to buy is no longer available.

Subsequent research performed by Johannes Abeler, [[Armin Falk]], Lorenz Goette, and David Huffman in conjunction with the [[IZA Institute of Labor Economics|Institute of Labor Economics]] used the framework of Kőszegi and Rabin to prove that people experience expectation-based loss aversion at multiple thresholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abeler|first=Johannes|last2=Falk|first2=Armin|last3=Goette|first3=Lorenz|last4=Huffman|first4=David|date=2011-04-01|title=Reference Points and Effort Provision|journal=American Economic Review|volume=101|issue=2|pages=470–492|doi=10.1257/aer.101.2.470|issn=0002-8282|citeseerx=10.1.1.472.7268}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study evinced that reference points of people causes a tendency to avoid expectations going unmet. Participants were asked to participate in an iterative money-making task given the possibilities that they would receive either an accumulated sum for each round of "work", or a predetermined amount of money. With a 50% chance of receiving the "fair" compensation, participants were more likely to quit the experiment as this amount approached the fixed payment. They chose to stop when the values were equal as no matter which random result they received, their expectations would be matched. Participants were reluctant to work for more than the fixed payment as there was an equal chance their expected compensation would not be met.

==Within education==

Loss aversion experimentation has most recently been applied within an educational setting in an effort to improve achievement within the U.S.   Recent results from Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2009 ranked the US ranks #31 in math&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/pisa2009keyfindings.htm |title=PISA 2009 Results: What Students Know and Can Do: Student Performance in Reading, Mathematics and Science (Volume I) |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201195327/http://www.oecd.org/pisa/pisaproducts/pisa2009/pisa2009keyfindings.htm |archivedate=December 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and #17 in Reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://statlinks.oecdcode.org/982010071P1T002.XLS]&lt;/ref&gt; In this latest experiment, Fryer et al. posits framing [[merit pay]] in terms of a loss in order to be most effective.  This study was performed in the city of Chicago Heights within nine K-8 urban schools, which included 3,200 students.  150 out of 160 eligible teachers participated and were assigned to one of four treatment groups or a control group.  Teachers in the incentive groups received rewards based on their students' end of the year performance on the ThinkLink Predictive Assessment and K-2 students took the Iowa Test of Basic Skills (ITBS) in March. The control group followed the traditional merit pay process of receiving "bonus pay" at the end of the year based on student performance on standardized exams.  However, the experimental groups received a lump sum given at beginning of the year, that would have to be paid back.  The bonus was equivalent to approximately 8% of the average teacher salary in Chicago Heights, approximately $8,000.

Methodology—"Gain" and "Loss" teachers received identical net payments for a given level of performance. The only difference is the timing and framing of the rewards.  An advance on the payment and the re framing of the incentive as avoidance of a loss, the researchers observed treatment effects in excess of 0.20 and some as high as 0.398 [[standard deviations]].  According to the authors, 'this suggests that there may be significant potential for exploiting loss aversion in the pursuit of both optimal public policy and the pursuit of profits'.&lt;ref&gt;Fryer et al., [http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/enhancing_teacher_incentives.pdf "Enhancing the efficacy of teacher incentives through loss aversion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915105312/http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/enhancing_teacher_incentives.pdf |date=September 15, 2012 }}, "Harvard University", 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Utilizing loss aversion, specifically within the realm of education, has gotten much notoriety in blogs and mainstream media.

The Washington Post discussed merit pay in a 2012 article and specifically the study conducted by Fryer et al.  The article discusses the positive results of the experiment and estimates the testing gains of those of the "loss" group are associated with an increase in lifetime earnings of between $37,180 and $77,740.  They also comment on the fact that it didn't matter much whether the pay was tied to the performance of a given teacher or to the team to which that teacher was assigned. They state that "a merit pay regime need not pit teachers in a given school against each other to get results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/07/23/does-teacher-merit-pay-work-a-new-study-says-yes/|publisher=Washington Post|title=Does teacher merit pay work? A new study says yes.|date=July 23, 2012|author=Dylan Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Science Daily specifically covers the Fryer study stating that the study showed that "students gained as much as a 10 percentile increase in their scores compared to students with similar backgrounds -- if their teacher received a bonus at the beginning of the year, with conditions attached."   It also explains how there was no gain for students when teachers were offered the bonus at the end of the school year.

Thomas Amadio, superintendent of Chicago Heights Elementary School District 170, where the experiment was conducted, is quoted in this article stating "the study shows the value of merit pay as an encouragement for better teacher performance".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/08/120809090335.htm|publisher=[[Science Daily]]|title=Student Scores Improve If Teachers Given Incentives Upfront|date=Aug 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education weekly also weighs in and discusses utilizing loss aversion within education, specifically merit pay.  The article states there are "few noteworthy limitations to the study, particularly relative to scope and sample size; further, the outcome measure was a 'low-stakes' diagnostic assessment, not the state test—it's unclear if findings would look the same if the test was used for accountability purposes. Still Fryer et al. have added an interesting tumbling element to the merit-pay routine".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcellence.net/commentary/education-gadfly-weekly/2012/august-2/enhancing-the-efficacy-of-teacher-incentives-through-loss-aversion.html|title=Enhancing the Efficacy of Teacher Incentives through Loss Aversion: A Field Experiment|author=Amber M. Winkler|date=August 2, 2012|publisher=Education weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sun Times interviewed John List, Chairman of the University of Chicagos' department of economics.  He stated "It's a deeply ingrained behavioral trait. .. that all human beings have—this underlying phenomenon that 'I really, really dislike losses, and I will do all I can to avoid losing something'."  The article also speaks to only one other study to enhance performance in a work environment.   The only prior field study of a "loss aversion" payment plan, they said, "occurred in Nanjing, China, where it improved productivity among factory workers who made and inspected DVD players and other consumer electronics".  The article also covers a reaction by [[Barnett Berry]], president of the Center for Teaching Quality, who stated "the study seems to suggest that districts pay 'teachers working with children and adolescents' in the same way 'Chinese factory workers' were paid for 'producing widgets'. I think this suggests a dire lack of understanding of the complexities of teaching."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/14687664-418/cash-upfront-the-way-to-get-teachers-to-rack-up-better-student-test-scores-study.html |publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |title=Cash upfront the way to get teachers to rack up better student test scores, study finds |author=ROSALIND ROSSI |date=August 24, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229135931/http://www.suntimes.com/news/education/14687664-418/cash-upfront-the-way-to-get-teachers-to-rack-up-better-student-test-scores-study.html |archivedate=December 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has also been other criticism of the notion of loss aversion as an explanation of greater effects. Indeed, all of the noted findings in education can be explained simply by the additional attention to a task when it includes losses (i.e., loss attention), independently of the weighting to gains and losses.

Larry Ferlazzo in his blog questioned what kind of positive classroom culture a "loss aversion" strategy would create with students, and what kind of effect a similar plan with teachers would have on school culture. He states that "the usual kind of teacher merit pay is bad enough, but a threatened 'take-away' strategy might even be more offensive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://larryferlazzo.edublogs.org/2012/07/21/if-you-only-have-a-hammer-you-tend-to-see-every-problem-as-a-nail-economists-go-after-schools-again/|title="If you only have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail" — Economists Go After Schools Again}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neural aspect of loss aversion ==
In earlier studies, both bidirectional [[Mesolimbic pathway|mesolimbic]] responses of activation for gains and deactivation for losses(or vica versa) and gain or loss-specific responses have been seen. While reward anticipation is associated with ventral [[striatum]] activation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/363/1511/3801.full.pdf|title=Explicit neural signals reflecting reward uncertainty|last=N.

It has later been proven that inconsistencies may only have been due to methodological issues including the utilisation of different tasks and stimuli, coupled with ranges of potential gains or losses sampled from either payoff matrices rather than parametric designs, and most of the data are reported in groups, therefore ignoring the variability amongst individuals. Thus later studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cresa.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Canessa-Motterlini-et-al.-2013-The-Functional-and-Structural-Neural-Basis-of-Individual-Differences-in-Loss-Aversion.pdf|title=The Functional and Structural Neural Basis of Individual Differences in Loss Aversion|last=Canessa|first=Nicola|date=September 4, 2013|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than focusing on subjects in groups, focus more on individual differences in the neural bases by jointly looking at behavioural analyses and neuroimaging.

[[Neuroimaging]] studies on loss aversion involves measuring brain activity with [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) to investigate whether individual variability in loss aversion were reflected in differences in brain activity through bidirectional or gain or loss specific responses, as well as multivariate source-based morphometry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908010690|title=Joint source based morphometry identifies linked gray and white matter group differences|last=|first=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2008.09.051|pmid=18992825|volume=44|issue=3|journal=NeuroImage|pages=777–789|pmc=2669793|year=2008|last1=Xu|first1=L.|last2=Pearlson|first2=G.|last3=Calhoun|first3=V. D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (SBM) to investigate a structural network of loss aversion and univariate [[Voxel-based morphometry|voxel-basedmorphometry]] (VBM) to identify specific functional regions within this network.

Brain activity in a right ventral striatum cluster increases particularly when anticipating gains. This involves the ventral [[caudate nucleus]], [[Pallium (neuroanatomy)|pallidum]], [[putamen]], bilateral [[orbitofrontal cortex]], superior frontal and middle [[Gyrus|gyri]], [[Posterior cingulate|posterior cingulate cortex]], dorsal [[anterior cingulate cortex]], and parts of the dorsomedial [[thalamus]] connecting to temporal and [[prefrontal cortex]]. There is a significant correlation between degree of loss aversion and strength of activity in both the frontomedial cortex and the ventral striatum. This is shown by the slope of brain activity deactivation for increasing losses being significantly greater than the slope of activation for increasing gains in the appetitive system involving the ventral striatum in the network of reward-based behavioural learning. On the other hand, when anticipating loss, the central and basal nuclei of amygdala, right posterior [[Insular cortex|insula]] extending into the [[supramarginal gyrus]] mediate the output to other structures involved in the expression of fear and anxiety, such as the right [[Operculum (brain)|parietal operculum]] and supramarginal gyrus. Consistent with gain anticipation, the slope of the activation for increasing losses was significantly greater than the slope of the deactivation for increasing gains.

Multiple neural mechanisms are recruited while making choices, showing functional and structural individual variability. Biased anticipation of negative outcomes leading to loss aversion involves specific [[Somatosensory system|somatosensory]] and [[Limbic system|limbic]] structures. fMRI test measuring neural responses in [[Striatum|striatal]], limbic and somatosensory brain regions help track individual differences in loss aversion. Its limbic component involved the amygdala(associated with negative emotion and plays a role in the expression of fear) and [[putamen]] in the [[right hemisphere]]. The somatosensory component included the middle [[cingulate cortex]], as well as the posterior insula and [[rolandic operculum]] bilaterally. The latter cluster partially overlaps with the right hemispheric one displaying the loss-oriented bidirectional response previously described, but, unlike that region, it mostly involved the posterior insula bilaterally. All these structures play a critical role in detecting threats and prepare the organism for appropriate action, with the connections between amygdala nuclei and the striatum controlling the avoidance of aversive events. There are functional differences between the right and left amygdala. Overall, the role of amygdala in loss anticipation suggested that loss aversion may reflect a [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian]] conditioned approach-avoidance response. Hence, there is a direct link between individual differences in the structural properties of this network and the actual consequences of its associated behavioral defense responses.

The neural activity involved in the processing of aversive experience and stimuli is not just a result of a temporary fearful overreaction prompted by choice-related information, but rather a stable component&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310649386|title=Neural markers of loss aversion in resting-state brain activity|last=Canessa|first=Nicole|date=19 November 2016|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of one's own preference function, reflecting a specific pattern of neural activity encoded in the functional and structural construction of a limbic-somatosensory neural system anticipating heightened aversive state of the brain. Even when no choice is required, individual differences in the intrinsic responsiveness of this interoceptive system reflect the impact of anticipated negative effects on evaluative processes, leading preference for avoiding losses rather than acquiring greater but riskier gains.

Individual differences in loss aversion are related to variables such as age,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929312000825|title=Behavioral and neural correlates of loss aversion and risk avoidance in adolescents and adults|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|doi=10.1016/j.dcn.2012.09.007|pmid=23245222|volume=3|journal=Dev Cogn Neurosci|pages=72–83 | last1 = Barkley-Levenson | first1 = EE | last2 = Van Leijenhorst | first2 = L | last3 = Galván | first3 = A|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; gender, and genetic factors&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=nW65CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49&amp;lpg=PA49|title=Society Organizations and the Brain: Building towards a UnifiedCognitive Neuroscience Perspective|last=|first=|date=2015-07-02|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=|isbn=9782889195800|last1=Senior|first1=Carl|last2=Lee|first2=Nick|last3=Braeutigam|first3=Sven}}&lt;/ref&gt; affecting thalamic norepinephrine transmission, as well as neural structure and activities. Outcome anticipation and ensuing loss aversion involve multiple neural systems, showing functional and structural individual variability directly related to the actual outcomes of choices.

In a study, adolescents and adults are found to be similarly loss-averse on behavioural level but they demonstrated different underlying neural responses to the process of rejecting gambles. Although adolescents rejected the same proportion of trials as adults, adolescents displayed greater caudate and frontal pole activation than adults to achieve this. These findings suggest a difference in neural development during the avoidance of risk. It is possible that adding affectively arousing factors (e.g. peer influences) may overwhelm the reward-sensitive regions of the adolescent decision making system leading to risk-seeking behaviour. On the other hand, although men and women did not differ on their behavioural task performance, men showed greater neural activation than women in various areas during the task. Loss of striatal dopamine neurons is associated with reduced risk-taking behaviour.&amp;nbsp; Acute administration of D2 dopamine agonists may cause an increase in risky choices in humans. This suggests dopamine acting on stratum and possibly other mesolimbic structures can modulate loss aversion by reducing loss prediction signalling.

[[File:EicheQuerschnitt.jpg|thumb|Transverse section of white oak, ''[[Quercus robur]]''. A ray appears diagonally, from top left to bottom middle.]]
'''Medullary rays''' are cellular structures found in some species of [[wood]]. They appear as radial planar structures, perpendicular to the growth rings, which are visible to the naked eye. In a transverse section they appear as radiating lines from the centre of the log. In an axial section they may appear as a variety of transverse markings, depending on how close the section is to the plane of the ray. In a tangential section they may be hard to see at all.

They are formed by the activity of fascicular [[cambium]]. During the process of the division of cambium, the cambium cuts out cells on both the outer and inner side. These cells are [[parenchymatous]]. Most of these cells transform into xylem and phloem. But certain cells don't transform into xylem and phloem and remain as such.{{clarify|date=October 2016}} These cells cut out by the cambium towards the periphery are phloem parenchyma while those towards the pith are xylem parenchyma. Both of these cells together work as secondary medullary rays.

These medullary or pith rays are essential for the radial conduction of the water, minerals and other organic substances.They transport the substances from centre to periphery

These rays are also known as vascular rays or pith rays.

In this context, the term refers to radial sheets or ribbons extending vertically through the tree across and perpendicular to the growth rings. Also called pith rays or wood rays, these formations of primarily [[ground_tissue#Parenchyma|parenchyma]] cells allow the radial transport of sap and are essential in the process of [[Tylosis (Botany)|tylosis]].

In [[quartersawn]] material, where the wood is cut into boards with the growth rings roughly perpendicular to the face of the board, the '''medullary rays''' often produce beautiful [[figure (wood)|figure]] such as silver grain, medullary spots, pith flecks, etc.&lt;ref name="isbn0-88029-318-7"&gt;{{cite book |author=Corkhill, Thomas |title=The Complete Dictionary of Wood |publisher=Dorset Pr |location= |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-88029-318-7 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3238">In botanical terms, '''monandrous''' simply means to have a single [[stamen]].

== In orchids ==
A distinction between monandrous and other flowers is particularly relevant in the classification of [[orchid]]s. The monandrous orchids form a [[clade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = What does morphology tell us about orchid relationships?—a cladistic analysis | author = John V. Freudenstein and Finn N.

== In animals ==
In animals, a monandrous system occurs when females have one mate at a time. For example, a female [[Speckled Wood (butterfly)|speckled wood]] butterfly will typically only mate once within her short lifetime.&lt;ref name="Lauwers 2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauwers|first=K.|author2=Van Dyck, H.|title=The Cost of Mating with a Non-Virgin Male in a Monandrous Butterfly: Experimental Evidence from the Speckled Wood, Pararge aegeria|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=2006|volume=60|issue=1|pages=69–76|doi=10.1007/s00265-005-0142-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also common in certain bee species, like ''[[Bombus terrestris]]'' and ''[[Bombus pratorum]]'', where a female will only mate with one male during her nuptial flight and use the sperm reserves for the rest of her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baer, B. and P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5111">'''Nestedness''' is a measure of structure in an [[ecosystem|ecological system]], usually applied to species-sites systems (describing the distribution of species across locations), or species-species interaction networks (describing the interactions between species, usually as bipartite networks such as hosts-parasites, plants-pollinators, etc.).

A system (usually represented as a matrix) is said to be nested when the elements that have a few items in them (locations with few species, species with few interactions) have a subset of the items of elements with more items. Imagine a series of islands that are ordered by their distance from the mainland. If the mainland has all species, the first island has a subset of mainland's species, the second island has a subset of the first island's species, and so forth, then this system is perfectly nested.

==Measures of nestedness==
One measurement unit for nestedness is a system's '[[temperature]]' offered by Atmar and Patterson in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Patterson and Atmar |year=1993 |title=The measure of order and disorder in the distribution of species in fragmented habitat |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=96 |pages=373–382 |doi=10.1007/BF00317508 |last2=Patterson |first2=Bruce D. |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measures the order in which species' extinctions would occur in the system (or from the other side - the order of colonizing a system). The 'colder' the system is, the more fixed the order of extinction would be. In a warmer system, extinctions will take a more random order. Temperatures go from 0°, coldest and absolutely fixed, to 100° absolutely random.

For various reasons, the Nestedness Temperature Calculator is not mathematically satisfying (no unique solution, not conservative enough).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rodríguez-Gironés MA, Santamaría L |year=2006 |title=A new algorithm to calculate the nestedness temperature of presence–absence matrices |journal=Journal of Biogeography |volume=33|pages=924–935 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Guimarães, P. R. , P. Guimarães |year=2006 |title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices |journal=Environmental Modelling and Software |volume=21|pages=1512–1513 |doi=10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A software (BINMATNEST) is available from the authors on request and from the Journal of Biogeography to correct these deficits &lt;ref&gt;http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2699.2006.01444.x#suppl.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ANINHADO solves problems of large matrix size and processing of a large number of randomized matrices; in addition it implements several null models to estimate the significance of nestedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.envsoft.2006.04.002 | volume=21 | title=Improving the analyses of nestedness for large sets of matrices | journal=Environmental Modelling | pages=1512–1513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iemss.org/shortcom/software/software.php?aid=201&lt;/ref&gt;

Bastolla ''et al.'' introduced a simple measure of nestedness based on the number of common neighbours for each pair of nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bastolla U, Fortuna MA, Pascual-García A, Ferrera A, Luque B, Bascompte J |year=2009 |title=The architecture of mutualistic networks minimizes competition and increases biodiversity |journal=Nature |volume=458 |pages=1018–1020 |doi=10.1038/nature07950 |pmid=19396144}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that this can help reduce the effective competition between nodes in certain situations. For instance, two insect species might "help" each other by pollinating the same subset of plants, thereby reducing the extent to which they are harmful to each other. The authors suggest that this effect is behind a correlation between nestedness and diversity in plant-pollinator ecosystems. However, Johnson ''et al.'' have shown that this measure does not, in fact, properly account for the desired effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson S, Domínguez-García V, Muñoz MA |year=2013 |title=Factors Determining Nestedness in Complex Networks |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=8 |pages=e74025 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0074025}}&lt;/ref&gt; These authors propose a refined version of the measure, and go on to show how certain network properties affect nestedness.

In [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] (especially in [[zoological nomenclature|zoological]] and [[botanical nomenclature]]), a '''''nomen nudum''''' ("naked name"; plural '''''nomina nuda''''') is a ''designation''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Turland, N. |year=2013 |volume=Regnum Vegetabile Volume 155 |title=The Code Decoded: A user's guide to the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants |publisher=Koeltz Scientific Books  |isbn=978-3-87429-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which looks exactly like a [[scientific name]] of an organism, and may have originally been intended to be a scientific name, but fails to be one because it has not (or has not yet) been published with an adequate description (or a reference to such a description). This makes it a "bare" or "naked" name, one which cannot be accepted as it stands.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; A largely equivalent but much less frequently used term is '''''nomen tantum''''' ("name only").

==In zoology==
According to the rules of zoological nomenclature a ''nomen nudum'' is [[unavailable name|unavailable]]; the glossary of the ''[[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]]'' gives this definition:&lt;ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=May 2014}}

'''''One Good Turn: A Natural History of the Screwdriver and the Screw''''' is a book published in 2000 by Canadian [[architecture|architect]], professor and writer [[Witold Rybczynski]].

The idea for the book came in 1999 when an editor at ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' asked Rybczynski to write a short essay on the best and most useful common tool of the previous 1000 years. Rybczynski took the assignment, but as he researched the history of the items in his workshop – hammers and saws, [[spirit level|levels]] and [[plane (tool)|planes]] – he found that most dated well back into antiquity. At the point of giving up, he asked his wife for ideas. She answered: "You always need a screwdriver for something."

Rybczynski discovered that the screwdriver is a relatively new addition to the toolbox, an [[invention]] of the [[Late Middle Ages]] in Europe and the only major mechanical device not independently invented by the Chinese. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was there at the start, designing a number of screw-cutting machines with interchangeable gears. Nevertheless, it took generations for the screw (and with it, the screwdriver and [[Lathe (tool)|lathe]]) to come into general use, and it was not until modern times that improvements such as slotted screws came into being. Rybczynski spends some time discussing the Canadian invention, the [[Robertson screwdriver]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2856">The '''Orion Abort Test Booster''' (ATB) is a small solid rocket launcher being developed by [[Orbital Sciences Corporation|Orbital ATK Corporation]] under contract by U.S. Air Force [[Space and Missile Systems Center]], Experimental Launch &amp; Test [SMC/LEX].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbital.com/NewsInfo/release.asp?prid=605 Orbital.com: ''Orbital To Provide Abort Test Booster For NASA Testing'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbital.com/AdvancedSystems/Publications/ATB_factsheet.pdf#search="ATB" Orbital: "Orion Abort Test Booster (ATB) Fact Sheet"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Its goal will be to demonstrate and qualify the [[Orion (spacecraft)|Orion]] [[Launch escape system|Launch Abort System]] (LAS) that will allow the astronaut crew to safely escape in the event of an emergency during launch pad operations, through the ascent phase of the Orion vehicle.

==History==
While the first test was at one point planned for 2009, in early 2013 a decision was made to postpone abort testing until after the 2018 uncrewed maiden flight of the [[Space Launch System|SLS]] vehicle.  The test is now baselined for December 2019.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacenews.com/article/civil-space/33523orion-abort-test-delayed-until-after-maiden-sls-flight SpaceNews.com: "Orion Abort Test Delayed Until After Maiden SLS Flight"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ATB can be considered the successor to [[Little Joe II]] used during similar Apollo abort testing at White Sands Missile Range, New Mexico.  It uses a single stage [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] missile first stage motor [SR118] inside an Aero-Shell to replicate the Orion Service Module 5.5 meter diameter.  Ballast plates are used to increase the weight of the vehicle to mimic ascent acceleration of the Space Launch System.  The ATB also includes an Avionics cylinder assembly mounted to the forward SR118 motor skirt, and a Thrust Reaction Structure to carry the loads from the 92" diameter motor to the larger Orion Service Module 5.5 meter diameter.

The Abort Test launch will be from Cape Canaveral SLC-46, a Navy site leased to Space Florida.  The existing Mobile Access Tower will be modified with platforms designed and built by Langley Research Center, VA to surround the ATB and Launch Abort Vehicle [comprising a Separation Ring, Boilerplate Crew Module (also built at Langley Research Center), and Launch Abort System] outer mold line.

The abort separation of the Crew Module/LAS from the ATB will occur while the SR118 is still thrusting around 30,000' altitude during the transonic regime.  Currently, no parachute system will be installed on the Crew Module.  The purpose of the test is to collect data on the separation environment.

==History==
The Part-Time Scientists team formed in June 2009, when ten teams had already entered [[Google Lunar X-Prize]] (GLXP), which had started in 2007. Later the company Part-Time Scientists GmbH (Limited) was founded.

On August 22–23, 2009, the Part-Time Scientists presented their project at the Open Doors Day of the [[Federal Ministry for Education and Research]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On December 28, 2009, the team presented their mission at the 26th annual [[Chaos Communication Congress]].   In a two-hour presentation, the team provided a detailed overview of all parts of the project.  This was the first time the European-made private [[lunar rover]] prototype had been presented to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/26C3-Wie-eine-Handvoll-Hacker-den-Mond-erobern-will-893241.html|title=26C3: Wie eine Handvoll Hacker den Mond erobern will|first=heise|last=online|website=heise online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.happytimes.ch/news-welt/264-20091228-deutsche-erobern-mond.html|title=Deutsches Team will Mond erobern und 30 Millionen Dollar gewinnen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early 2015 the team won awards in the categories Mobility and Vision, and a total of $750,000 in the Milestone Prizes of [[Google Lunar X-Prize|GLXP]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/28365-google-lunar-xprize-milestones.html Google Lunar XPrize Milestone Awards Announced] Accessed 2016-03-29&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2205">'''Pavel Kononovich Senko''' ({{lang-ru|Павел Кононович Сенько}}) (October 4, 1916 – 2000) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[polar explorer]], [[scientist]], and member and leader of numerous expeditions to [[Arctic Ocean]] and [[Antarctica]] under the auspices of the [[Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute]] and [[Soviet Antarctic Expedition]].

There is a valley at the bottom of Arctic Ocean named after him : ''Senko Valley'' from 87° 04’ N 97° 00’ W to 87° 45’ N 101° 10’ W .
There is a mountain named after him in Antarctica: ''Senko Mountain'' at 71° 25,2’ S 12° 46,8’ E on the [[Zavaritsky Ridge]].

He was leader of the winter party and officer-in-charge of [[Mirny Station]] on the [[9th Soviet Antarctic Expedition]] and lead several expeditions subsequently. His name had shown up in the 1997 edition of "The Guinness Book of records" as one of the four "first people to have indisputably reached the North Pole at ground level exactly 90°00`00" (+-300m) on April, 23, 1948" [https://books.google.ru/books?id=NRc7h5gisY8C&amp;dq=Kuznetsov%3Dfalse&amp;q=Kuznetsov&amp;redir_esc=y#v=snippet&amp;q=Kuznetsov&amp;f=false]

A '''rainout''' is the process of precipitation causing the removal of radioactive particles from the atmosphere onto the ground,  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating [[nuclear fallout]] by rain. The rainclouds of the rainout are often formed by the particles of a [[nuclear explosion]] itself and because of this, the decontamination of rainout is more difficult than a "dry" fallout.

==Factors affecting rainout==
A rainout could occur in the vicinity of [[ground zero]] or the contamination could be carried aloft before deposition depending on the current [[atmospheric]] conditions and how the explosion occurred. The explosion, or burst, can be air, surface, subsurface, or [[seawater]]. An air burst will produce less fallout than a comparable explosion near the ground due to less particulate being contaminated. Detonations at the surface will tend to produce more fallout material. In case of water surface bursts, the particles tend to be rather lighter and smaller, producing less local fallout but extending over a greater area. The particles contain mostly sea salts with some water; these can have a cloud seeding effect causing local rainout and areas of high local fallout. Fallout from a seawater burst is difficult to remove once it has soaked into porous surfaces because the fission products are present as metallic ions which become chemically bonded to many surfaces. For subsurface bursts, there is an additional phenomenon present called "base surge". The base surge is a cloud that rolls outward from the bottom of the subsiding column, which is caused by an excessive density of dust or water droplets in the air. This surge is made up of small solid particles, but it still behaves like a fluid. A soil earth medium favors base surge formation in an underground burst. Although the base surge typically contains only about 10% of the total bomb debris in a subsurface burst, it can create larger [[radiation]] doses than fallout near the detonation, because it arrives sooner than fallout, before much [[radioactive decay]] has occurred. For underwater bursts, the visible surge is, in effect, a cloud of liquid (usually water) droplets with the property of flowing almost as if it were a homogeneous fluid. After the water evaporates, an invisible base surge of small radioactive particles may persist.

Meteorogically, snow and rain will accelerate local fallout. Under special [[meteorological]] conditions, such as a local rain shower that originates above the radioactive cloud, limited areas of heavy contamination just downwind of a nuclear blast may be formed.
Rain on an area contaminated by a surface burst changes the pattern of radioactive intensities by washing off higher elevations, buildings, equipment, and vegetation. This reduces intensities in some areas and possibly increases intensities in drainage systems; on low ground; and in flat, poorly drained areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Victor George Hayward''' [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|AM]] (1887&amp;ndash;1916) was a London-born accounts clerk whose taste for adventure took him to [[Antarctica]] as a member of [[Sir Ernest Shackleton]]’s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]], 1914&amp;ndash;17. He had previously spent time working on a ranch in northern Canada and this experience, combined with his "do-anything" attitude, was sufficient for him to be engaged by Shackleton as a general assistant to the [[Ross Sea party]], a support group with a mission to lay depots for the main cross-continental party.

Hayward quickly proved himself to be hard-working and resourceful. He was one of the ten members of the shore party that was marooned when the Ross Sea party’s expedition ship ''Aurora'' broke from its [[McMurdo Sound]] moorings during a storm and was unable to return. In difficult circumstances he played a full part in the efforts of the stranded group to fulfil its mission, despite its shortages of food, proper clothing, and equipment. During the main depot-laying journey on the [[Ross Ice Shelf|Great Ice Barrier]] in 1915&amp;ndash;16 Hayward was one of the six who marched to the [[Beardmore Glacier]] to lay the last of the required chain of depots. On the return leg the party was struck with scurvy, which caused the death of [[Arnold Spencer-Smith]]. Although suffering badly himself, Hayward helped bring the rest of the party off the Barrier to the relative safety of the [[Hut Point]] shelter.

Hayward disappeared on 8 May 1916 while walking across the frozen surface of McMurdo Sound in the hopes of reaching the expedition’s base at [[Cape Evans]]. His body was never found. Seven years later Hayward was posthumously awarded the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]] for his efforts to save the lives of his stricken companions on the Barrier journey.

==Early life==
Victor George Hayward was born 23 October 1887 at 5 Manor Park Road, Harlesden, North London. He was the 12th of 14 children of Francis Checkley Hayward and Mary Jane Fairchild. His father became a senior executive of the London and North Western Railway.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hayward, Great Nephew&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward was educated at an [[Essex]] boarding school, and after attending a London business college was employed as an accounts clerk in the [[City of London|City]]. From an early age he had been fascinated by stories of adventure, a particular favourite, acquired as a [[Sunday School]] prize, being [[R M Ballantyne]]’s ''The World of Ice, or Adventures in the Polar Regions''.&lt;ref name = "Tyler-Lewis_39"&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;  Unprepared for a life of "bourgeois complacency",&lt;ref name = "Tyler-Lewis_39"&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward took leave from his employers to spend seven months working on a ranch in northern Canada. On his return he found settling back into an office routine difficult, and applied to Shackleton’s office for a position on the newly announced Trans-Antarctic expedition. His offer to "do anything" secured him his place in the Ross Sea party.&lt;ref name = "Tyler-Lewis_39"&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ross Sea party==
{{Main|Ross Sea party}}

===First season===
The Ross Sea party’s expedition ship ''Aurora'' arrived in Antarctica in January 1915. During the short season before the onset of winter Hayward volunteered for everything—helping [[Ernest Joyce]] with the dogs,&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; assisting the motor tractor party and [[manhauling|man-hauling]] depot supplies on the Barrier.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, pp. 84&amp;ndash;87&lt;/ref&gt; When the shore party was marooned after ''Aurora'' was blown from her moorings, Hayward became an accomplished seal hunter, helping to boost the party’s depleted stocks of food.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "quiet, brawny man",&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward’s closest bond was formed with the party’s leader, [[Aeneas Mackintosh]], with whom he shared a common yearning for home and loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;Mackintosh had recently married, Hayward was engaged to be married. He kept an expedition journal in the form of a series of letters to his fiancée.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second season===
The main depot-laying journey of the expedition began in September 1915. Although privately recording that he thought the programme to be followed "impossible",&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward threw his physical might into the job.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the party of six that undertook the longest stage of the depot-laying journey, from 80°S to the Beardmore Glacier. This journey was completed on 26 January 1916.&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p.480&lt;/ref&gt; On the return journey [[Aeneas Mackintosh|Mackintosh]] and parson/photographer Arnold Spencer-Smith fell victims to scurvy and had to be carried on the sledge, drawn by Joyce, [[Ernest Wild]], [[Richard W Richards|Dick Richards]] and Hayward. When the food situation became acute Hayward, by now showing scurvy symptoms himself, nevertheless went forward with Joyce and Richards to obtain life-saving food and fuel for the rest of the party.&lt;ref&gt;Bickel, pp. 156&amp;ndash;57&lt;/ref&gt;  Eventually, after suffering both physical and mental breakdown,&lt;ref&gt;Huntford, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt; Hayward was lashed to the sledge and on 18 March was hauled to the shelter at [[Hut Point]] where, since the doorway was iced up, he was hoisted in through the window.&lt;ref name="Fisher, p. 409"&gt;Fisher, p. 409&lt;/ref&gt; Spencer-Smith died and was buried in the ice; Mackintosh barely survived. Joyce had expected Hayward to die,&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; but he too survived.

===Disappearance===
[[File:Mackintosh walk.png|thumb|McMurdo Sound, frozen over. Mackintosh and Hayward set out on 8 May 1916 from [[Hut Point]] (A), intending to walk across the ice to [[Cape Evans]] (B). They disappeared in the area marked C.]]
Helped by a diet of seal—plentifully available around Hut Point—the party slowly recovered. Mackintosh was anxious that as soon as possible they make the final stage of the return journey—the {{convert|13|mi|km}} across the frozen surface of McMurdo Sound to the base at Cape Evans. The ice would not be safe until winter set in, in June or July, but Mackintosh and Hayward grew impatient. In early May they had recovered sufficiently to begin testing the ice.&lt;ref name="Fisher, p. 409"/&gt; On 8 May Mackintosh announced that he and Hayward intended to walk across to Cape Evans, and against the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Wild, they set out at 1:00&amp;nbsp;pm., carrying only light supplies. Two hours later a blizzard swept over the Sound and they were lost from view.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; They did not arrive at Cape Evans, and no trace of their bodies was ever found, nor was the nature of their fate established. They may have fallen through the ice, or been carried out to sea when the ice broke up. If by chance they had managed to reach the temporary safety of land they would have been cut off, without hope either of returning to Hut Point or reaching Cape Evans, and would have perished from hypothermia.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albert Medal==

After the remainder of the Hut Point party had crossed to Cape Evans in mid-July a series of searches instituted by Joyce failed to establish the fate of Mackintosh and Hayward.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Further searches took place when ''Aurora'' finally returned to relieve the party, in January 1917. A memorial cross was erected to Mackintosh and Hayward at Wind Vane Hill, a weather observation post near Cape Evans.&lt;ref&gt;Tyler-Lewis, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years after their struggle on the ice, in belated recognition, on 4 July 1923 Joyce, Richards, Wild and Hayward (the last two posthumously, Wild having died on active service in 1918) were awarded the [[Albert Medal (lifesaving)|Albert Medal]], in recognition of their efforts to save the lives of Mackintosh and Spencer-Smith on the Barrier.

In [[fluid dynamics]], the '''volumetric flux''' is the [[Volumetric flow rate|rate of volume flow]] across a unit area (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;·s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;·m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;). 
Volumetric flux = liters/(second*area). The density of a particular property in a fluid's volume, multiplied with the volumetric flux of the fluid, thus defines the [[Advection|advective flux]] of that property.&lt;ref name="reible1"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volumetric flux through a porous medium is often modelled using [[Darcy's law]].

Volumetric flux is not to be confused with [[volumetric flow rate]], which is the volume of fluid that passes through a ''given'' surface per unit of time (as opposed to a ''unit'' surface).

The '''''Western Livestock Journal''''' is a weekly livestock industry newspaper. Originally called the ''Farm and Ranch Market Journal'', it was started by Nelson R. Crow in 1922 and is published by Crow Publications.

==History==
The ''Farm and Ranch Market Journal'' became ''Western Livestock Journal'' in the early 1930s. In 1952, Nelson purchased ''Livestock Magazine'' from the Biggs family in [[Denver]]. The two weeklies were combined in the ’70s to create one national edition of ''Western Livestock Journal'' and the monthly magazine was renamed ''Livestock Magazine'', and split into three editorial editions. ''Livestock Magazine'' ceased publication in the early ’80s.

==Today==
Crow Publications publishes the ''Northwest American Bull Guide'' magazine (yearly), the ''Commercial Cattle Issue'' (yearly), the ''Properties Ranch &amp; Home magazine'' (quarterly), as well as the ''Western Livestock Journal'' (weekly). Crow Publications/''Western Livestock Journal'' is located in [[Greenwood Village, Colorado|Greenwood Village (CO, United States)]].
