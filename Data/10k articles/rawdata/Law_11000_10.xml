Dr. '''Abdel-Moniem ibn Ali El-Ganayni ''' ({{lang-ar|عبد المنعم بن علي الجنايني}}) is an [[Egypt]]ian-born [[United States|American]] [[nuclear physicist]], former prison [[Imam]], and an active member of the [[Pittsburgh]] [[Muslim]] community.  In 2007 El-Ganayni's U.S. [[security clearance]] was revoked, and he subsequently lost his job as a senior scientist at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]].

==Biography==
El-Ganayni was born in Minyat Samannoud, [[Egypt]] in 1950. His father, Sheikh Ali ibn Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni (الشيخ علي بن عبدالمنعم الجنايني) was educated at the prestigious [[Al-Azhar University]], where he completed his elementary, secondary, and high school studies. Sheikh Ali proceeded to the Al-Azhar Faculty of [[Islamic Law]], where he completed the equivalent of a [[bachelor’s degree]]. He continued his studies to the graduate level, obtaining the equivalent of a [[Ph.D.]] in Islamic law (العالمية), and later a certification to practice law (إجازة القضاء الشرعي).

In 1973, Dr. Abdel-Moniem El-Ganayni obtained his Bachelor of Science in [[Physics]] from [[Ain Shams University]] in [[Cairo]], Egypt. He went on to pursue a [[Master's degree|master's]] in Nuclear Physics and completed his degree in 1978.

In 1980 El-Ganayni moved to the United States to complete his Ph.D., obtaining a second master's degree in Nuclear Physics from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1983.  Between 1984 and 1989 El-Ganayni worked as a teaching assistant in the Department of Physics, and completed his Ph.D. in Atomic Physics in 1990. He became an American citizen in 1988.

Shortly after completing his graduate studies, El-Ganayni was hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Company]], working in the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory as a Senior Scientific Programmer, and later as a Senior Scientist. Throughout his employment at Bettis he received positive reviews, authored and coauthored a number of academic papers, and contributed to numerous projects.

El-Ganayni’s contributions were not limited to scientific endeavors; he is a founding member of the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, served two terms as the center’s president, and helped to establish the mosque’s current location in Schenley Heights. For close to a decade, El-Ganayni worked and volunteered as an Imam at correctional facilities in both [[Ohio]] and [[Pennsylvania]]. Part of El-Ganayni’s prison outreach included the creation of the PA DOC Monitor, a website examining the condition, and necessary reform of the Department of Corrections.

== Loss of Security Clearance, Employment ==

Dr. El-Ganayni’s work at Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory required the possession of a [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) issued security clearance, enabling him to work with [[classified information]].  In October 2007 El-Ganayni’s security clearance was suspended,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211834/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively barring him from any work at Bettis.  DOE regulations stipulate that an individual may appeal a suspension, however El-Ganayni’s right to appeal was denied in May 2008 when Jeffery F. Kupfer, deputy secretary of the DOE, invoked [[national security]], refusing to reveal the government’s allegations against Dr. El-Ganayni.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08179/893014-55.stm] - Muslim sues over loss of security clearance&lt;/ref&gt;

The suspension of El-Ganayni’s security clearance was prefaced by an interview with DOE security officials, and later the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI).  In these interviews, questions were asked regarding El-Ganayni’s political beliefs, religious views, and his work as an Imam in the prison system.  No questions related to his work or any potential breaches of security were asked in either interview.

The DOE officials instead focused on a seemingly innocent Islamic book entitled, “The Miracle of the Ant,” authored by [[Turkey|Turkish]] Islamic publisher and author [[Harun Yahya]]; unbeknownst to El-Ganayni, the content of Yahya’s book was largely, if not completely duplicated from a [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning work entitled, “[[Journey to the Ants]]” published by [[Harvard University Press]].

Dr. El-Ganayni distributed excerpts from book to prisoners (both Muslim and non-Muslim) while serving as an Imam at Forest State Correctional Institution.  DOE officials expressed concern over a purely scientific description of ants’ biological defense mechanisms in a chapter entitled, “Defense and War Tactics” insinuating that El-Ganayni distributed this material with sinister intent, and subsequently questioned his allegiance to the United States of America.  His supervisor at Forest, chaplaincy director Glenn McQuown reviewed the book and described it as “completely benign.”

The interviews also focused on El-Ganayni’s criticism of American [[foreign policy]] and the FBI’s mistreatment of Muslims after [[September 11, 2001]].  Specifically, El-Ganayni raised concern over an FBI raid of a Pittsburgh mosque during Friday prayers, where attendees were searched and forced to stand outside while being questioned.  Revocation of El-Ganayni’s security clearance also may be related to his establishment of the PA DOC Monitor, a website and prison outreach program which critically examines the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections and its policies, insisting that drastic reform of the system is required for it to truly benefit prisoners and society at large.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08034/854427-85.stm] - Nuclear physicist/Muslim cleric fights to get job back, security clearance&lt;/ref&gt;

== El-Ganayni vs. the United States Department of Energy et al.. ==

On June 26, 2008 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) with Schnader, Harrison, Segal, and Lewis as co-counsels filed a lawsuit on behalf of Dr. El-Ganayni alleging that the DOE revoked his clearance due to criticism of the FBI and U.S. foreign policy. The suit demands that the DOE reveal their allegations against El-Ganayni and restore due process, allowing him to contest any allegations made against him.  A hearing date has not been set as of July 28, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903064152/http://aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-03 |df= }} - Government Revoked Muslim Nuclear Physicist’s Security Clearance to Retaliate for Criticism of U.S. Policy, says ACLU&lt;/ref&gt;

A motion  for preliminary and permanent injunction against the U.S. Department of Energy and its acting director, Jeffrey Kupfer was filed on September 3, 2008 requesting the following:

* Assert that the court has jurisdiction over the case.
* Order the Energy Department to show Dr. El-Ganayni the evidence it claims to have against him.
* Order the Energy Department to hold a hearing where he can tell his side of the story, as provided in the agency's own rules for inquiries on sensitive security matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080903064152/http://aclupa.org/pressroom/governmentrevokedmuslimnuc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-03 |df= }} - Muslim scientist asks judge to order hearing&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, 2008 the DOE filed a motion to dismiss El-Ganayni's preliminary and permanent injunction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Govt_Motion_to_Dismiss_And_Oppose.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219125734/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Govt_Motion_to_Dismiss_And_Oppose.pdf |archivedate=2009-02-19 |df= }} - DOE Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss and in Opposition to Plaintiff's Motion for Preliminary Injunction and Permanent Injunction&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2008 Dr. El-Ganayni's attorneys filed a brief in opposition of the DOE's motion to dismiss.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_in_Opposition_to_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195257/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_in_Opposition_to_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }} - Brief in Opposition to Motion to Dismiss&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, 2008 Judge Terrence F. McVerry stated that the court "reluctantly concludes that it lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims made in Counts I and II of the Complaint" effectively granting the DOE's Motion to Dismiss in relation to Counts I and II.  However, the court requested supplemental briefing regarding Count III, specifically concerning the DOE's interpretation, application, and adherence to executive procedure.  Briefs from both the DOE and El-Ganayni's defense regarding Count III were submitted on November 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024211834/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }} -Memorandum 10-31-2008 in reference to DOE's motion to dismiss&lt;/ref&gt;

Judge McVerry ruled in favor of Dr. El-Ganayni and refused to dismiss Count III on November 20, 2008.  In his court order McVerry stated that, "[the] Defendants’ interpretation [of their own regulations] is not consistent with the actual text of the Executive Orders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Order_denying_Motion_to_Dismiss_Count_III.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002453/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Order_denying_Motion_to_Dismiss_Count_III.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This ruling was based on a DOE regulation stating that a clearance can only be revoked by a DOE agency head, not simply a Deputy Secretary.  Subsequently, November 24, 2008, a day before a scheduled hearing to discuss pending motions, future direction of the litigation, and the possible scheduling of a preliminary injunction hearing, DOE secretary Samuel Bodman signed a revocation of El-Ganayni's clearance citing national security and the government requested a dismissal of the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Notice_of_Filing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002534/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Notice_of_Filing.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This dismissal was granted ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order_11_25_08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025002852/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Memorandum_Order_11_25_08.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; however Dr. El-Ganayni appealed his case to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court.&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"&gt;http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08333/931314-52.stm&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. El-Ganayni's brief for appeal of the dismissal was filed March 19, 2009 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_for_Appeal_from_Grant_of_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025170032/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/Brief_for_Appeal_from_Grant_of_Motion_to_Dismiss.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a decision was made in the DOE's favor on January 11, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/3rd-circuit-opinion.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605000106/http://home.comcast.net/~halqahtani/abdelmoniem/3rd-circuit-opinion.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In summation, the judges stated that the DOE is by extension part of the government's Executive Branch, and therefore the 3rd Circuit has no jurisdiction over the matter.

== Leaving the United States ==

On November 26, 2008 El-Ganayni and his wife left to Egypt after residing in the United States for 28 years.  El-Ganayni stated that he would rather return to his birthplace than live in America as a second-class citizen and that he "feel[s] very sad that the American people have lost a good bit of their Constitution," quoting John Adams who said, "once you lose your rights and liberties, it's very hard to get them back."&lt;ref name="post-gazette.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1140">An '''alternate director''' is an individual who is appointed to attend a [[meeting|board meeting]] on behalf of the [[board of directors|director]] of a [[company (law)|company]] where the principal director would be otherwise unable to attend.  The law relating to alternate directors varies from country to country, but in most jurisdictions, the alternate director has the same powers to attend, speak and vote at meetings as the principal director would have had, had the alternate not been appointed.

In some jurisdictions, the alternate must also be a director in his or her own right (so in effect, there would be one less person at the meeting, but the director who had also been appointed as an alternate would carry two votes).  However such structures are not common in developed legal systems.

The appointment of a temporary alternate is one of the few exceptions to the general rule that the office of a director is not assignable and non-delegable.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in the United Kingdom, see section 308 of the Companies Act 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bergordnung''' were the [[mining]] regulations or [[law]] enacted in order to exercise the royal mining rights or ''[[Bergregal]]'' in central Europe in [[medieval]] times. 
&lt;!--
== Entwicklung und Beschreibung ==
Die Quellen, welche wir heute als Bergordnung verstehen und die sich selbst als Ordnung und Satzung bezeichnen, entstehen seit der Mitte des 15. Jahrhunderts. Wir müssen sie von den mittelalterlichen (Gewohnheits-)rechtsaufzeichnungen wie dem Goslarer (1271), Iglauer (nach 1270) und Freiberger Recht (älteres Bergrecht nach 1307, jüngeres Bergrecht nach 1346) unterscheiden. Letztere enthalten (private?) Aufzeichnungen bergmännischen Gewohnheitsrecht und können noch nicht als Gesetze betrachtet werden. Einzig das Ius regale montanorum König Wenzels II. von Böhmen zeigt - in starker Anlehnung an römische Traditionen - den Willen zur Gesetzgebung. Damit wird dieses wohl vornehmlich für das Bergrevier Kuttenberg gedachte Gesetz zum frühen Vorläufer der dann von den jeweiligen Regalherren für bestimmte Reviere erlassenen Bergordnungen der frühen Neuzeit. Der Geltungsbereich von Bergordnungen konnte landesweit sein. Zumeist galten Bergordnungen aber nur für kleine Gebiete, wenn der Inhaber des Bergregals ein Territorialfürst war. Bergordnungen konnten auch auf einzelne [[Bergstadt|Bergstädte]] beschränkt sein oder nur auf bestimmte [[Mineral]]e. Besonders den frühen Bergordnungen (z.B. für Schneeberg und Annaberg in Sachsen) war nur eine kurze Geltung beschieden.
In der Mitte des [[19. Jahrhundert]]s wurden die Bergordnungen durch landesweite [[Berggesetz]]e ersetzt. Diese Notwendigkeit lässt sich am Beispiel [[Preußen]] verdeutlichen, wo nach den Territorialgewinnen durch die Beschlüsse des [[Wiener Kongress]]es von [[1815]] ''50'' verschiedene Bergordnungen galten.

Der Inhalt einer Bergordnung bestand im Wesentlichen aus folgenden Teilen:
* das [[Bergamt]] mit seinen Bergbeamten (''Bergstaat'')
* das [[Bergwerk]] mit seinem Bergleuten
* das [[Metallurgie|Hüttenwesen]] und die Hüttenleute
* der Bergprozess und die Berggerichte
* das Münzwesen (wenn das [[Bergregal]] mit einem [[Münzrecht|Münzregal]] verbunden war)

Darin enthalten waren sowohl detaillierte Bestimmungen über den Bergbau, den landesherrlichen [[Zehnt]], den Aufbau der Bergbehörden als auch die Privilegien des [[Bergleute|Bergstandes]].

Wenn beispielsweise ein Erzsucher ein neues Vorkommen (Gang) entdeckt zu haben dachte, so musste er sich das Schürfrecht offiziell beim zuständigen Bergmeister sichern. Erwies sich der Schurf als abbauwürdig, legte er beim [[Bergamt]] eine [[Mutung]] ein. Der Bergmeister prüfte diesen Antrag durch persönliche Besichtigung, bestimmte die Maße und Lage der Grube, zu welcher dann auch ein [[Grundstück]] (Grubenfeld) als Zubehörfläche gehörte, genau. Gab es keine weiteren Mutungen auf diesen Erzgang, wurde dem neuen [[Bergwerk]] (Grube, Stollen) ein [[Eigenname]], meist ein [[Liste der Seligen und Heiligen|Heiligenname]], gegeben und eine [[Gebühr]] erhoben. Mit der Eintragung in das Lehnbuch war die Verleihung rechtskräftig.

Bedingt durch die wirtschaftliche Bedeutung des Bergbaus für den Inhaber des [[Bergregal]]s, die sich aus dem [[Zehnt]] ergab, hatte er großes Interesse an einem florierenden [[Bergbau]]. Um Berggebrechen, wie Absaufen der Gruben, Einstürze durch fehlerhaften Abbau oder das Verschütten von Gängen, vorzubeugen, war es Aufgabe der [[Bergamt|Bergämter]], die [[Bergwerk]]e regelmäßig aufzusuchen (Befahrung) und sich weiterhin über alle Vorkommnisse unterrichten zu lassen. Diese Form der Bergaufsicht, bei der das Bergamt auch die Entscheidungen über Abbau, Grubenerweiterung (Vortrieb), [[Wasserhaltung]] unter anderem traf, wird auch als ''[[Direktionsprinzip]]'' bezeichnet. Im Zuge der wirtschaftlichen Entwicklungen in der Mitte des [[19. Jahrhundert]]s erwies sich diese Bevormundung als Hemmnis, so dass das Direktionsprinzip in den späteren [[Berggesetz]]en abgeschafft wurde und die Bergämter lediglich auf tatsächliche Aufsichtsaufgaben beschränkt wurden.

'''Best interests''' or '''best interests of the child''' is a child rights principle, which derives from Article 3 of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which says that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.

According to the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the diversity of factors to consider, usually more than one profession or institution is involved in the assessment process, bringing together various perspectives and areas of expertise from the country of origin and destination and, in particular, the perspective of the child.

The following aspects are relevant for the best interests of the child: 
* The child's views and aspirations; 
* The identity of the child, including age and gender, personal history and background; 
* The care, protection and safety of the child; 
* The child's well-being; 
* The family environment, family relations and contact;
* Social contacts of the child with peers and adults; 
* Situations of vulnerability, i.e. the risks that the child is facing and the sources of protection, resiliency and empowerment;
* The child's skills and evolving capacities; 
* The rights and needs with regard to health and education; 
* The development of the child and her or his gradual transition into adulthood and an independent life; 
* Any other specific needs of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), Chapter V.A.1 and par. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessments ==
Best interests’ assessments can be conducted informally and ad hoc or as formalised processes. Assessments look at everyday matters and decisions with more or less severe implications for the child. The best interests of a child may change significantly over time as children grow and their situations and capacities evolve, so their best interests’ may need to be reassessed periodically.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determinations ==
Best interests’ determinations are formal processes conducted with the involvement of public authorities and professional decision makers. The objective of the best interests’ determination is to reach a decision based on national law that safeguards the rights of the child and promotes her or his well-being, safety and development. Decision-makers weigh and balance all the relevant factors of the case, giving due consideration to all the rights of the child and the obligations of public authorities and service providers towards the child. The objective of the best interests’ determination process is the identification of a durable solution. Best interests’ determinations are carried out when the issues at stake are expected to have significant implications on the child's present and future life.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements of a best interests’ assessment and determination process in transnational cases ==
Best interests’ assessments aim to gather all the facts needed to arrive at a conclusion about the impact of any action, measure or decision on the child and her or his future. The central perspective is that of the girl or boy concerned. A trust-based relationship and communicating effectively in the child's main language enables the child to exercise his or her [[right to be heard]]. Comprehensive assessments involve a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive best interests’ assessment and determination process addresses all of the following: 
* Establishing the child's identity and the identity of the child guardian and the quality of their relations, and any accompanying persons in [[Transnational child protection|transnational cases]]. 
* Case assessment, including the following components: 
** [[Right to be heard|Hearing the child]]; 
** Assessment of the child's situation, background and needs; 
** Social situation and family assessment;
** Gathering evidence including through forensic examinations and interviews with the child;
** Risk and security assessments;
** Mapping sources of support, skills, potentials and resources for empowerment; 
* Developing a [[Transnational child protection#Life projects|life project]]. 
* Comprehensive child impact assessment of any potential decisions. 
* Identification of a [[Transnational child protection#Durable solutions|durable solution]] in [[Transnational child protection|transnational cases]]. 
* Continued assessments during the implementation of the durable solution with due follow-up, review and monitoring, and adjustments to the durable solution arrangements, if and as required, according to the best interests of the child&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Procedural safeguards in best interests’ determinations ==
Procedural safeguards and documentation in best interests’ determinations include: 
* '''The right of the child to express her or his views and to have them taken into account:''' In a judicial or administrative procedure, children have the [[right to be heard]] and to have their views taken into account. 
**The process of hearing the child needs to be documented, with a clear description of how the child's views are balanced against other views and other information sources. The communication with the child has to be effective and child-sensitive and might require quality interpretation and cultural mediation. In cases of unaccompanied or separated children, the role of the guardian or representative is essential to facilitate the communication between the child and the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  
**The child has a right to a hearing when the decision making body is a court. The hearing should be held without delay in a child-sensitive way and prevent secondary victimisation of child victims and witnesses in judicial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration, Background Paper, Day of General Discussion, 2012, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;  
**The child's age, gender and background, the child's level of development and evolving capacities should be considered. 
**Child-friendly information in a language that the child understands, enabling the child to form an opinion and to express her or his views should be provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases]&lt;/ref&gt; 
** In transnational cases, children who do not speak the language of the country of destination have a right to translation and interpretation. Interpretation should be made available free of charge and with a neutral bearing when interpreters are directly involved.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration, Background Paper, Day of General Discussion, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Guardianship and representation: children have a right to an independent representative or guardian who is competent and equipped to represent and promote the best interests of the child.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, The Rights of All Children in the Context of International Migration, Background Paper, Day of General Discussion, 2012, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* '''Legal representation:''' When the best interests of a child are formally decided by a court or other competent body, the child is entitled to legal representation, legal information and defence, including for children applying for asylum or special protection as victims of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Council of Refugees and Exiles, Right to Justice: Quality Legal Assistance for Unaccompanied Children, Annex 1: Guiding principles for quality legal assistance for unaccompanied children, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Legal reasoning:''' Decisions need to be documented, motivated in detail, justified and explained, including how the decision is considered to relate to the best interests of the child and how the underlying considerations have been balanced to arrive at the decision.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 97&lt;/ref&gt;   
* '''Mechanisms to review or revise decisions:''' Formal mechanisms have to be in place to reopen or review decisions on the best interests of a child. Children need access to support in accessing and using these mechanisms. It has to be clearly established when a case or decision can be reopened or reviewed, as for instance when there is new evidence or when the authorities have not been able to implement the first decision.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Determining the Best Interests of the Child, 2008, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;  
* '''Right to appeal:''' Best interests’ determinations are subject to legal remedies. Children need to have access and support, such as legal assistance and representation, to appeal a decision. During the appeal procedure the implementation is suspended.&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  For decisions concerning transfer or return of a child to another county, sufficient time must be available between the decision and the execution of the decision, to enable the child to hand in an appeal or request a review of the decision.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of unaccompanied and separated children in Europe, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Balancing rights and interests in best interests’ determinations==
The  different elements considered in an assessment and determination of the best interests of a child may appear to be competing or in contradiction. 
Potential conflicts are solved on a case-by-case basis. The right of the child to have her or his best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child's interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childcentre.info/public/PROTECT/Guidelines_-_promoting_the_Human_Rights_and_the_Best_Interest_of_the_Child_in_Transnational_Child_Protection_Cases.pdf CBSS Guidelines Promoting the Human Rights and the Best Interests of the Child in Transnational Child Protection Cases]&lt;/ref&gt; A larger weight is attached to what serves the child best:
* The possibility of harm outweighs other factors;  
* The child's right to be brought up by her or his parents is a fundamental principle;
* A child's best interests can generally best be met with her or his family, except where there are safety concerns;
* The survival and development of the child are generally ensured best by remaining in or maintaining close contacts with the family and the child's social and cultural networks;
* Matters related to health, education and vulnerability are important factors; and   
* Continuity and stability of the child's situation are important.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of unaccompanied and separated children in Europe, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 on the right of the child to have his or her best interests taken as a primary consideration, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application internationally ==

=== European laws and policies ===
Reference to the best interests of the child has been introduced into relevant EU laws and policies, including in the context of migration, asylum, trafficking and potential return. The wording attached to the best interests’ principle ranges between the imperative “must” and “shall” to the less prescriptive “should”. 
&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Action Plan on Unaccompanied Minors (2010–2014), COM (2010) 213 final, Brussels, 6 May 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;2011 EU Anti-trafficking Directive, par. (8).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;EU Dublin III Council Regulation, par. (13), Article 6. 2011 Qualifications Directive, par. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;2008 Return Directive, par. 22, Article 5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Brussels II Regulation 2003, pp.1–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
The Finnish Child Welfare Act provides that the best interests of the child needs to be a primary consideration in the determination of welfare measures in response to the child's needs. The Act defines the key elements that need to be taken into consideration for a best interests’ determination: 
# Balanced development and well-being, close and continuing human relationships;  
# The opportunity to be given understanding and affection, as well as supervision and care in line with the child's age and level of development;  
# An education consistent with the child's abilities and wishes;  
# A safe environment in which to grow up, and physical and emotional freedom;  
# A sense of responsibility in becoming independent and growing up;  
# The opportunity to become involved in matters affecting the child and to influence them; and  
# The need to take account of the child's linguistic, cultural and religious background.&lt;ref&gt;Finland, Child Welfare Act (417/2007), Chapter 1, Section 4(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

This provision offers legally binding guidance to professionals on how the concept of the best interests of the child should be understood. It raises awareness of the complexity of the issues under consideration and makes reference to important rights of the child such as the right to education and development, safety and well-being, respect for the child's views and the child's cultural and other backgrounds.

=== United States ===
Since the US has not yet ratified the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which is the central instrument defining and providing the right of the best interests of the child for much of the world, a different set of laws, precedents, and applications apply.

==== History ====

The use of the best interests doctrine represented a 20th-century shift in [[public policy (law)|public policy]]. The best interests doctrine is an aspect of ''[[parens patriae]],'' and in the [[United States]] it has replaced the [[Tender Years Doctrine]], which rested on the basis that children are not resilient, and almost any change in a child's living situation would be detrimental to their well-being.

Until the early 1900s, fathers were given custody of the children in case of divorce. Many [[U.S. state]]s then shifted from this standard to one that completely favored the mother as the primary caregiver. In the 1970s, the Tender Years Doctrine was replaced by the best interests of the child as determined by family courts. Because many family courts continued to give great weight to the traditional role of the mother as the primary caregiver, application of this standard in custody historically tended to favor the mother of the children.

The "best interests of the child" doctrine is sometimes used in cases where non-parents, such as grandparents, ask a court to order non-parent visitation with a child. Some parents, usually those who are not awarded custody, say that using the "best interests of the child" doctrine in non-parent visitation cases fails to protect a fit parent's fundamental right to raise their child in the manner they see fit. [[Troxel v. Granville|Troxel v Granville, 530 US 57; 120 S Ct 2054; 147 LEd2d 49 (2000)]].

==== Use in Child Welfare Laws  ====

The "best interest of the child" doctrine is largely seen in child welfare laws and the paramount consideration of the court when making decisions with regards to abused and neglected children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/best-interest/|title=Determining the Best Interests of the Child - Child Welfare Information Gateway|website=www.childwelfare.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The A[[Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 P.L. 96-272|doption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980]] requires that, “…each child has a case plan designed to achieve placement in the least restrictive (most family like) setting available and in close proximity to the parents' home, consistent with the best interest and special needs of the child.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/96/hr3434/text/enr|title=Text of H.R. 3434 (96th): Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 (Passed Congress version) - GovTrack.us|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the satutue does not define the "best interest of the child", best interest is referenced in two other sections. Moreover, several states have chosen to statutorily define or reference the "best interest of the child", and require the courts within those jurisdictions to consider specific factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.childwelfare.gov/topics/systemwide/laws-policies/statutes/best-interest/|title=Determining the Best Interests of the Child - Child Welfare Information Gateway|website=www.childwelfare.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Use in Family Law'''

The term is used as doctrine used by [[court]]s to determine a wide range of issues relating to the well-being of [[child]]ren. In the application of family law, one of the most common of these issues concern questions that arise upon the divorce or separation of the children's parents. Examples include:

*With whom will the children live?
*How much [[contact (law)|contact]] (previously termed "access" or, in some jurisdictions, "[[contact (law)|visitation]]") will the parents, [[legal guardian]], or other parties be allowed (or required) to have?
*To whom and by whom will [[child support]] be paid and in what amount?

In proceedings involving [[divorce]] or the dissolution of a [[common-law marriage]] or a [[civil union]], family courts are directed to assess the best interests of any children of these unions. However, this doctrine is not used to settle custody matters involving urban and minority residents in cities such as Philadelphia, PA for example where the tender years doctrine is still in effect.

The determination is also used in proceedings which determine legal obligations and entitlements, such as when a child is born outside of marriage, when grandparents assert rights with respect to their grandchildren, and when biological parents assert rights with respect to a child who was given up for adoption.

It is the doctrine usually employed in cases regarding the potential [[emancipation of minors]]. Courts will use this doctrine when called upon to determine who should make [[medical]] decisions for a child where the [[parents]] disagree with healthcare providers or other [[authorities]].

In determining the best interests of the child or children in the context of a separation of the parents, the court may order various investigations to be undertaken by [[social worker]]s, [[Family proceedings court|Family Court]] Advisors from [[CAFCASS]], [[psychologist]]s and other [[forensics|forensic experts]], to determine the living conditions of the child and his custodial and non-custodial parents.  Such issues as the stability of the child's life, links with the community, and stability of the home environment provided by each parent may be considered by a court in deciding the child's residency in custody and visitation proceedings. In [[English law]], section 1(1) [[Children Act 1989]] makes the interests of any child the paramount concern of the court in all proceedings and, having indicated in s1(2) that delay is likely to prejudice the interests of any child, it requires the court to consider the "welfare checklist", i.e. the court must consider:
#The ascertainable wishes and feelings of each child concerned (considered in light of their age and understanding)
#Physical, emotional and/or educational needs now and in the future
#The likely effect on any change in the circumstances now and in the future
#Age, sex, background and any other characteristics the court considers relevant
#Any harm suffered or at risk of suffering now and in the future
#How capable each parent, and other person in relation to whom the court considers the question to be relevant, is of meeting the child's needs
#The range of powers available to the court under the Children Act 1989 in the proceedings in question

The welfare checklist considers the needs, wishes and feelings of the child and young person and this analysis is vital to ensure that the human rights of children are always in the forefront of all consideration. The welfare checklist provides a comprehensive list of issues that need to be considered to ensure that young people who come into court proceedings are safeguarded fully and their rights as citizens are promoted.

'''Use in Immigration Law'''

To a much lesser degree the principal of the "best interest of the child" has been utilized in immigration law as it relates to child migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carr|first=Bridgette, A.|date=February 2012|title=Incorporating a" Best Interests of the Child" Approach Into Immigration Law and Procedure|url=http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&amp;context=yhrdlj|journal=YALE HUMAN RIGHTS &amp; DEVELOPMENT L.J.|volume= 12|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the best interests standard ==
{{Main|Fathers' rights movement}}

The Best Interests standard has received considerable criticism by certain groups within the privacy rights and family law reform movement, particularly with regard to how it unlawfully marginalizes children from one of their parents absent a compelling government interest, and often cultivates protracted litigation. Critics argue that a higher evidentiary standard should be applied to fit parents, and that the Best Interests standard should only be applied in cases where a termination of parental rights has already occurred.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12996">The '''Bled agreement''' of 22 August 1938 revoked some of the restrictions placed on [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] by the [[Treaty of Trianon]] for its involvement on the losing side in [[World War I]]. Representatives of Hungary and three of its neighbours—the so-called "[[Little Entente]]" of [[First Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] and [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]—first met at [[Bled]] in Yugoslavia on 21 August. The next day they announced a joint renunciation of the use of force in their mutual relations, and the Little Entente recognised Hungary as having an equal right to armaments.{{sfn|Bán|2004|pp=37–38}} This gave Hungary legal cover for the re-creation of [[Hungarian Air Force|its air force]], already begun in secret, and the increase of its army in manpower, guns, and munitions.

==Background==
There had been efforts at rapprochement between Hungary and Czechoslovakia in February and June 1937, in which the latter had asked for a mutual non-aggression pact as part of any deal recognising Hungary's right to re-arm itself. As this re-armament was already occurring on a limited scale without protest from Czechoslovakia or her allies, Hungary rejected her overtures.{{sfn|Krempa|2008|p=72}} Two events convinced the Hungarians to pursue an accord with the Little Entente. The first was the [[Salonika Agreement]] of 31 July, whereby [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] had obtained permission to re-arm from the members of the [[Balkan Pact]] (including Yugoslavia and Romania).{{sfn|Roman|1974|pp=82–83}} The second was Romania's enactment in early August of minority protection statute that was more liberal than Hungary had expected. Thus, although Hungary was willing to negotiate non-aggression and re-armament with the Entente as a unit, she reserved the question of minorities to individual agreements with the member states.{{sfn|Roman|1974|pp=82–83}}

The timing of the agreement was related to the scheduled launching of the [[German cruiser Prinz Eugen|German cruiser ''Prinz Eugen'']] by the Hungarian first lady, [[Magdolna Purgly]], on 22 August. The Hungarian government believed that their position ''vis-à-vis'' Germany would be strengthened if they had a pact with the Little Entente completed when officials from both countries met in [[Kiel]] for the launch.{{sfn|Roman|1974|pp=82–83}}

==Czechoslovakia's isolation==
The accord was the biggest piece of international news in the evening papers in London the night of 22 August.{{sfn|Bán|2004|pp=37–38}} It was also praised in the press in France and the Little Entente.{{sfn|Ádám|1999|pp=92–93}} It was met with anger by the [[Nazi Germany|German government]]. The actual agreement was complicated and incomplete. Although the question of the Hungarian minority in Romania had been resolved earlier in the month, the same question with Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia was still open. On three points of dispute regarding, the Hungarians and Yugoslavs came to an understanding separate accords (appended to the general accord) were each initialed (but not signed). A final agreement between Hungary and Czechoslovakia on the minority question remained uninitialed because the latter could not satisfy the former's stronger demands against her.{{sfn|Ádám|1999|pp=92–93}}{{sfn|Krempa|2008|pp=112–14}} The Czechoslovak foreign minister, [[Kamil Krofta]], informed the Yugoslavs, before the conference, that although it was "a case of discrimination [against us] ... we wish to contribute to an agreement."{{sfn|Roman|1974|pp=82–83}}

The result was that Hungary could come to a general agreement with all three of its neighbours, while holding up implementation with respect to only one, the one also neighbouring Germany, Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Winchester|1976|p=417}} Only Italy saw the Bled pact for what it was. The Italian foreign minister, [[Galeazzo Ciano]], remarked that it "marked a new phase in the crumbling of the Little Entente. Czechoslovakia is isolated. The [[Cordon sanitaire|French system of friendships]] is completely upset."{{sfn|Ádám|1999|pp=92–93}} The Bled conference itself was held without consulting either Italy or Austria, and was thus in violation of the [[Rome Protocols]] agreed to by the three powers in 1934,{{sfn|Winchester|1976|p=417}} or of their supplementary agreements made during conferences at Rome (20–23 March 1936) and Vienna (11–12 November 1936). (At the latter, Hungary had received recognition that the Little Entente states had an interest in her rearmament.){{sfn|H. L.|1936|p=4}}

On 23 August, the Hungarian prime minister, [[Béla Imrédy]], and foreign minister, [[Kálmán Kánya]], met their German counterparts, [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]], at the naval review in Kiel. The Germans, especially Ribbentrop, were incensed at the recently published Bled agreement, since at the time Germany was contemplating war with Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Bán|2004|pp=37–38}} When on 25 August in [[Berlin]] Ribbentrop further pressured Kánya about Hungary's reaction to a German invasion of Czechoslovakia, the latter suggested that the Bled agreement could perhaps be invalidated by making demands on the Entente and that Hungary's armed forces would be sufficiently prepared to partake in a Czechoslovak conflict as early as 1 October.{{sfn|Bán|2004|pp=37–38}}{{sfn|Ádám|1999|pp=92–93}} Hitler told Kánya directly that if Hungary wanted to benefit from the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|partition of Czechoslovakia]], they must work towards making it happen, saying, "He who wants to sit at the table must at least help in the kitchen."{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=377}} Hungary's military would certainly not be ready to participate in any conflict by October 1, as both governments must have known.{{sfn|Roman|1974|pp=82–83}}

==Excessive demands==
The method proposed by Kánya to the Germans for invalidating the Bled agreement was to "make excessive demands on the matter of the [Hungarian] minorities in the Little Entente states".{{sfn|Bán|2004|pp=37–38}} On 1 September 1938, in [[Budapest]], Imrédy gave an interview to a diplomatic correspondent of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', in which (the ''Telegraph'' reported the next morning) he downplayed the significance of the agreement (as it had been reported by the London papers), because its full implementation would come about only when the question of Hungarian minorities had been settled.{{sfn|Bán|2004|p=131}}

The Bled agreement contains an early indication of the ebb of the [[League of Nations]]' prestige. The Permanent Council of the Little Entente recognised that "in existing circumstances the League of Nations cannot completely carry out the tasks entrusted to it by the authors of the Covenant."{{sfn|Oldson|1977|p=183}} A communiqué of the Yugoslav government, dated 31 August, clarified that Yugoslavia "had not renounced her prior obligations" by signing the Bled agreement, but [[Hermann Göring]] told the Hungarian government on 9 September that the Yugoslav regent, [[Prince Paul of Yugoslavia|Prince Paul]], had assured him that he would "in no circumstances intervene against Hungary, not even if the latter got involved in a conflict with Czechoslovakia."{{sfn|Roman|1974|p=86}}

==Hungarian re-armament==
Almost from its signing, the Treaty of Trianon had been contravened by "secret" re-armament under tight budgetary constraints. This was in fact general knowledge, and Hungary's neighbours and the great powers looked the other way. The official Hungarian position was that she had a right to re-arm, but with the Bled agreement she obtained legal cover and the re-armament programme could shed its nominal secrecy.{{sfn|Krempa|2008|p=72}}

Even before Trianon, Hungary had begun to plan its secret air force and lay the administrative groundwork. In the 1920s, however, the victorious powers' Aviation Supervisory Committee quashed every effort to circumvent disarmament.{{sfn|Szabó|2005|pp=194–95}} In 1932, a plan for a future air force of forty-eight squadrons was approved. In March 1935, the Director of the Aviation Office, who was ''de facto'' commander of the secret air force, urged "set[ting] the goal that we become a serious opponent towards at least one of the surrounding Little Entente states."{{sfn|Szabó|2005|pp=194–95}} By 1 October 1937, the secret air force reached a strength of 192 planes.{{sfn|Szabó|2005|p=1995|ps=: including "six fighter planes, eight day bombers, two night bombers, and two remote reconnaissance squadrons."}}

Although, as expected, Hungary was not prepared for war by 1 October, on 6 October all air force units (except for two short-range reconnaissance squadrons) were ordered to ready for deployment, but none were ready on time. In the end, the air force was not needed, as the Italo-German mediated [[First Vienna Award]] solved Hungary's revisionist claims on Czechoslovakia without war.{{sfn|Szabó|2005|pp=194–95}} There was conflict within the government over command of the air force until, on 1 January 1939, it finally came in from the cold and proclaimed a separate branch of the armed forces. It received its baptism of fire in the brief [[Slovak–Hungarian War|war with Slovakia]] from 23 March until 4 April.{{sfn|Szabó|2005|pp=194–95}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3631">The '''California Law Revision Commission''' ('''CLRC''') is an independent [[California]] state agency responsible for recommending reforms of state law.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code [http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=gov&amp;group=08001-09000&amp;file=8280-8298 §8280-8298]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asimow1999_p3"&gt;{{cite journal | title= Speed Bumps on the Road to Administrative Law Reform in California and Pennsylvania | journal= Widener Journal of Law and Public Policy | last= Asimow | first= Michael | year= 1999 | doi= 10.2139/ssrn.148700 | page= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Duties==

The CLRC makes recommendations to the [[California State Legislature]] to correct defects in California statutory law and to bring that law into harmony with modern conditions.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code § 8280&lt;/ref&gt; The CLRC may only study matters that have been expressly authorized by legislative resolution or statute.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code § 8293&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the CLRC's studies are purely technical. For example, in 2006 the CLRC was directed to recodify the Penal Code provisions relating to deadly weapons, to make them easier to use and understand without making any change in the outcomes under those laws.&lt;ref&gt;See 2006 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 128. See also Nonsubstantive Reorganization of Deadly Weapon Statutes, 38 Cal. L. Revision Comm’n Reports 217 (2009) enacted by 2010 Cal. Stat. ch. 178 and 2010 Cal. Stat. ch. 711.&lt;/ref&gt; Other CLRC studies involve significant legal and policy issues. For example, in 2013 the CLRC was directed to make recommendations to modernize California law on state and local government access to the customer records of communication service providers.&lt;ref&gt;See 2013 Cal. Stat. res. ch. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

CLRC studies vary widely in scope. Some involve the revision of a single code section, while others have created or recodified entire codes of law. For example, the CLRC drafted the California Evidence Code.&lt;ref&gt;Recommendation Proposing an Evidence Code, 7 Cal. L. Revision Comm'n Reports 1001 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staff==

Seven of the CLRC's ten members are appointed by the Governor for four year terms, with the advice and consent of the California Senate.  One Member of the Senate is appointed by the Senate Committee on Rules, one Member of the Assembly is appointed by the Speaker of the Assembly, and the Legislative Counsel serves ex officio.&lt;ref&gt;California Government Code § 8281&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission's staff consists of its Executive Director, Chief Deputy Counsel, two staff attorneys, and two administrative support staff.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clrc.ca.gov/Mbg-personnel.html Personnel Listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==

The CLRC currently maintains its main office at [[UC Davis School of Law]] and a branch office at [[Cubberley Community Center]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].

==Code Commission==

The CLRC is the successor to the California Code Commission, which itself was the successor to a series of earlier ''ad hoc'' codification commissions.  The Code Commission was established in 1929 and spent 24 years codifying the massive body of uncodified law that had piled up as of that year in the [[California Statutes]].

After the Code Commission completed the monumental task of codifying virtually all general California statutory law into the [[California Codes]], it recommended the creation of the CLRC, as a permanent law reform body.

'''Carla Cappalli''' was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. She is the daughter of the late fashion designer and artist Mili Arango and Richard Cappalli, the retired law professor and author. Cappalli was a professional model most of her life and studied acting and photography at Temple University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Rome, Italy. From 1998 through 2003 she worked as Executive Director and later as Public Relations Consultant for the Humane Society of Puerto Rico. There she promoted the proper care of pets and also their adoption and spay/neutering.

In 2003 Cappalli founded and presided over the Puerto Rico branch of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. With the SPCA of PR, Cappalli worked on animal cruelty cases such as the confiscation and relocation of seven polar bears being kept in inhumane conditions by a Mexican traveling circus. She has also filed a lawsuit against one of Puerto Rico’s biggest chicken [[intensive animal farming|factory farms]], Empresas Pollos Picú.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Undercover videos revealed company employees beating chickens to death with bats.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} In December 2005 she chained herself to a circus fence to protest the misuse of animals by Ringling Brothers Barnum and Bailey. Throughout the years Cappalli has been prominent in the media as spokesperson for animal welfare in Puerto Rico.

In October 2003 Cappalli was recognized by The Civic Club of Ladies  as one of the most distinguished women in Island society. On December 2007, Cappalli was once again honored, this time  by the publication ''Revista Imagen'' which named her “Lady of Image and Exemplary Life” for her philanthropic and humanitarian efforts.
Presently, Cappalli dedicates herself to the growth of her businesses Urban Pet by Carla Cappalli. She regularly designs collections and distributes them to some of the island’s finest pet shops. A percentage of the sales of Urban Pet is donated to help animal welfare in Puerto Rico.

As part of her efforts to promote animal welfare education in Puerto Rico, Cappalli has written and published a bi-lingual coloring book entitled “The Golden Rules for Helping Animals.”{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The book will be donated to public schools throughout Puerto Rico.

==Chronology of events==
1993-1996- Cappalli began her lifelong commitment to animals. Caring for a colony of feral cats, Cappalli and a friend began implementing the first TNR program in Puerto Rico, even standing up against the Government, which threatened to remove the cats (which had already been neutered.) Although some cats had to be euthanized, because of illness, slowly Cappalli and her friend began relocating cats, until there were none left in the original site. In 1993 Cappalli became a vegetarian.

1994-1996- Cappalli began volunteering at the San Juan Municipal shelter by photographing dogs and cats. On behalf of the shelter, she started the first free weekly column on adopting animals in Puerto Rico in a major local newspaper, El Nuevo Día, resulting in the doubling of pet adoptions at the shelter.

Cappalli began promoting adoption and neutering campaigns in major local television and radio shows, creating animal welfare media awareness for the first time in Puerto Rico.

1998-2001- Cappalli was asked to join the Humane Society of Puerto Rico (HSPR, an animal shelter) as Executive Director. At this time, the shelter was almost bankrupt and suffered from a poor public image. The Board of Directors was barely existent.

2001- 2003- As Executive Director of the HSPR and later as the President of FEPA, Cappalli began an 18-month-long battle alongside a US Animal Rights organization against the Mexican Circus Hermanos Suarez. The Circus arrived in Puerto Rico with seven polar bears. The Federation took undercover footage and was able to expose the inhumane conditions in which the polar bears were kept. After a yearlong court case, the circus was acquitted.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1221">'''Clean growth''' is a way to achieve [[economic growth]], using [[clean technology]], and allowing [[sustainable development]].

The aim is to rise standard of living with a reduced environmental impact.

Scientists and politicians use this terminology. For example, [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] said : 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Our first goal is to find the way to achieve "clean" growth and I want to defend this idea here today. We haven't got to choose between saving the planet and growth. We need to have growth and save the planet. So we need a growth that consumes less energy and fewer raw materials. A new economy must be invented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2007/62unga_sarkozy_speech_climate_change092407.asp speech] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120184856/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2007/62unga_sarkozy_speech_climate_change092407.asp |date=2008-01-20 }}, UN assembly, sept. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Clearlite Holdings Ltd v Auckland City Corp''''' [1976] 2 NZLR 729  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding land based [[nuisance]] claims in tort.&lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Auckland City arranged for their contractor to drive a tunnel under Clearlites factory in order to install a drainage pipe.

For reasons not stated, the tunnel caused the concrete floor to crack due to the soil subsiding 2 inches, which cost Clearlite $19,873.91 to fix.

After the council refused to reimburse them for the cost to fix their floor, Clearlite sued both Auckland City and the contractor for negligence as well as in nuisance.

==Held==
The court ruled that as the collapse was not the fault of the council or their contactor, the negligence claim must fail. However, the nuisance claim was successful as for nuisance cases, negligence is not required to be proved, merely foreseeability, and damages of $19,873.91 were awarded to Clearlite.

The '''Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods''' (the "Limitation Convention") is a uniform law treaty prepared by the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] (UNCITRAL). It deals with the prescription of actions relating to contracts for the international sale of goods due to the passage of time.

The Limitation Convention was originally prepared as a chapter of a broader treaty on contracts for international sale of goods. Adopted in 1974, it was amended in 1980 to be fully aligned, especially with respect to scope of application, to the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods]] (CISG), adopted in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;For an introduction to the Limitation Convention see, recently, Luca G. Castellani, An Assessment of the Convention on the Limitation Period in the International Sale of Goods Through Case Law, Villanova Law Review, vol. 58, no. 4 (2013) 645-660, available online at &lt;http://lawweb2009.law.villanova.edu/lawreview/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/VLR410.pdf&gt; and additional citations there.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==
As of February 2016, the following states have ratified, acceded to, succeeded to, or participate under the Limitation Convention:&lt;ref&gt;The status of signatories to the Limitation Convention is listed at http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/uncitral_texts/sale_goods/1974Convention_status.html, and is updated whenever the UNCITRAL Secretariat is informed of changes in status of the Limitation Convention.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Limitation Convention has been signed, but not yet ratified, acceded to, succeeded to, or participated under, by [[Brazil]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Mongolia]], [[Nicaragua]], and the [[Russian Federation]].

==Substantive provisions==
What follows is a very summary description of the content of the Limitation Convention, provided for preliminary information only. Readers are encouraged to refer to the [http://www.uncitral.org/pdf/english/texts/sales/limit/limit_conv_E_Ebook.pdf explanatory note] to that convention prepared by the UNCITRAL secretariat for further introductory information on the Limitation Convention.
 
In its original unamended version, the Limitation Convention applies when both parties have their place of business in contracting States (Article 3(1)). In the amended version, the Limitation Convention applies also when rules of private international law make the law of a Contracting State applicable to the contract of sale (Article 3(1)(b)). Hence, the Limitation Convention, as amended, applies in the same case as the CISG. It should be noted that the reference is to the rules of private international law applicable to the contract itself, and not to limitation matters.&lt;ref&gt;See Kazuaki Sono, The Limitation Convention: The Forerunner to Establish UNCITRAL Credibility, at IV.C, available online [http://www.cisg.law.pace.edu/cisg/biblio/sono3.html here].&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Likewise, other matters relating to scope of application of the Convention, especially in its amended form, are treated similarly as in the CISG. However, article 5 of the Limitation Convention contains an additional list of excluded matters that is not present in the CISG.
The limitation period is four years, starting from the date when the claim accrues (Articles 8 and 9). The limitation period stops to run when judicial or arbitral proceedings are commenced (Articles 13 and 14).

If the debtor recognizes in writing its debt before the end of the limitation period, a new limitation period runs (Article 20). The limitation period is also extended in case of force majeure (Article 21). In any case, the limitation period expires in ten years from the date on which it commenced (Article 23).

The effect of the expiration of the limitation period is that no related claim may be recognized or enforced; however, that claim may be used as a counter-claim to set off, under certain conditions (Article 25).

The expiration of the limitation period may be taken into account only if invoked by the parties to the proceedings (Article 24); however, a State may lodge a reservation to Article 24 and therefore allow for the judge to declare the expiration of the limitation period ex officio (Article 36).

==Practical relevance==
The Limitation Convention has often been considered as a lesser, and less lucky sister of the [[United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods|CISG]]. However, it is applied regularly in certain regions of the world, especially Eastern Europe. The Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts database has an increasing collection of decisions relating to the Limitation Convention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncitral.org/uncitral/en/case_law.html Case Law on UNCITRAL Texts (CLOUT)]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
While the [[United States|USA]] has been a party to the Limitation Convention for more than two decades, only one recent judicial precedent deals with the Convention.&lt;ref&gt;Maxxsonics USA, Inc. v. Fengshun Peiying Electro Acoustic Co., No. 10 C 1174, 2012 WL 962698, at *1 (N.D. Ill. Mar. 21, 2012) [CLOUT Case 1186]&lt;/ref&gt; This is unusual given that, for instance, the Limitation Convention applies to all contracts for sale of goods concluded between parties with place of business in the USA and in [[Mexico]], unless opted out of, and may indicate limited awareness of its existence.

'''Coutumes''' were the [[custom (law)|customary laws]] of [[France]].

Developed under [[feudalism]] during the [[Middle Ages]] and in the [[early modern period]], the coutumes were the laws asserted and  enforced by the French kings and their vassals, especially in the lands of the [[Île-de-France]], to the exclusion of Roman law. The area where the French customary law ''(droit coutumier)'' was in force was known as the ''pays de coutume''. In the south of France (''pays de droit écrit'') [[Roman law]] remained paramount. The line separating the two areas was generally the river [[Loire (river)|Loire]], from [[Geneva]] to the mouth of the [[Charente (river)|Charente]].  

A number of regional coutumes were compiled in the 13th and 14th centuries.  The [[Coutumes de Beauvaisis]], compiled by [[Philippe de Rémi (died 1296)|Phillipe de Remy]], had a long-lasting influence on French law. There were about 60 such regional coutumes. There were also more than 300 ''coutumes locales'' in specific towns and villages.  [[Voltaire]] said that in France a traveler changed laws as often as he changed horses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html The Civil Code: an Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the 16th century the Coutumes of Paris (first published in 1510) had been adopted in all areas except [[Normandy]], [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] and [[Brittany]]. Further development of customary law had been halted by the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.cua.edu/pennington/Law508/FranceLegalHistory.htm Legal History of France]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Napoleonic code]] entered into force in 1804 all the coutumes were abolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html The Civil Code: an Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1664, under the royal act creating the [[French East India Company]], the Custom of Paris became the only law of the land in [[New France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0001972 "Coutume de Paris" in the Canadian Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1866 the [[Civil Code of Lower Canada]] was adopted in [[Lower Canada]].

The '''Employee Involvement Directive''' 2001/86/EC is an [[EU Directive]] concerning the right of workers to elect members of the board of directors in a [[European Company]]. It is a supplement to the [[European Company Regulation]].

==Content==
EU member states differ in the degree of worker involvement in corporate management. In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the supervisory board. Other member states, such as the UK, have no such requirement, and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management.

These differing traditions of worker involvement have held back the adoption of the Statute for over a decade. States without worker involvement provisions were afraid that the SE might lead to having such provisions being imposed on their companies; and states with those provisions were afraid they might lead to those provisions being circumvented.

A compromise, contained in the Directive, was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the SE will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before the creation of the SE. If agreement cannot be reached, provisions contained in the Directive will apply. The Directive provides for worker involvement in the SE if a minimum percentage of employees from the entities coming together to form the SE enjoyed worker involvement provisions. The Directive permits Member States to not implement these default worker involvement provisions in their national law, but then an SE cannot be created in that member state if the provisions in the Directive would apply and negotiations between workers and management are unsuccessful.

===Definition===
Definition of employee participation: it does not mean participation in day-to-day decisions, which are a matter for the management, but participation in the supervision and strategic development of the company.

===Participation===
* If the two parties do not reach a satisfactory arrangement, a set of standard principles set out in the Annex to the Directive becomes applicable.
* Several models of participation are possible: firstly, a model in which the employees form part of the supervisory board or of the administrative board, as the case may be; secondly, a model in which the employees are represented by a separate body; and finally, other models to be agreed between the management or administrative boards of the founder companies and the employees or their representatives in those companies, the level of information and consultation being the same as in the case of the second model. The general meeting may not approve the formation of an SE unless one of the models of participation defined in the Directive has been chosen.
* The employees' representatives must be provided with such financial and material resources and other facilities as enable them to perform their duties properly.
* With regard to a European company formed through a merger, the standard principles relating to worker participation will apply where at least 25% of the employees had the right to participate in decisions before the merger. Here a political agreement proved impossible until the Nice summit in December 2000. The compromise adopted by the Heads of State or Governments allowed a Member State not to apply the Directive to SEs formed from a merger, in which case the SE could not be registered in the Member State in question unless an agreement had been concluded between the management and employees, or that no SE employee had the right of participation before the formation of the SE.

===Employment contracts and pensions===
Employment contracts and pensions are not covered by the Directive. With regard to occupational pension schemes, the SE is covered by the provisions laid down in the proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational schemes, presented by the Commission in October 2000, in particular in connection with the possibility of introducing a single pension scheme for all their employees in the European Union.

The '''Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission''' is an independent adjudicative agency of the [[United States government]] that provides [[administrative law|administrative trial]] and appellate review of legal disputes arising under the [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act]], or Mine Act, of 1977. 

Under the Mine Act, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] issues regulations covering health and safety in the nation's [[mining|mines]]. Federal mine inspectors employed by the Department's [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA) enforce these regulations by issuing citations and orders to mine operators. The Commission is concerned solely with the adjudication of disputes under the Mine Act, including the determination of appropriate penalties. It does not regulate mining or enforce the Mine Act. The Commission was established as an independent agency to ensure its impartiality.

Most cases deal with civil penalties assessed against mine operators and address whether the alleged safety and health violations occurred as well as the appropriateness of proposed penalties. Other types of cases include orders to close a mine, miners' charges of safety related discrimination and miners’ requests for compensation after the mine is idled by a closure order.

The Commission’s [[administrative law judge]]s (ALJs) decide cases at the trial level. The five-member Commission provides appellate review. Commissioners are appointed by the [[U.S. President|President]] and confirmed by the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Review of an ALJ decision by the Commission is not guaranteed but requires the affirmative vote of two Commissioners. Most of the cases accepted for review are generated from petitions filed by parties adversely affected by an ALJ decision. However, cases can also be accepted based on the Commission's own direction for review. An ALJ decision that is not accepted for review becomes a final, non-precedential order of the Commission. Appeals from the Commission's decisions are to the U.S. courts of appeals.

Procedures for appealing cases to the Commission are contained in its Rules of Procedure published in [http://www.fmshrc.gov/rules/prorules11-99.html 29 CFR Part 2700]. The Commission also publishes these rules in a separate pamphlet. A brochure, entitled "[http://www.fmshrc.gov/guides/howacase.html How a Case Proceeds Before the Commission]" is also available. The Commission's headquarters and Office of Administrative Law Judges are co-located in [[Washington, D.C.]], with an additional OALJ's offices in [[Denver, Colorado]] and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. Currently, the Commission has a budget of more than [[United States Dollar|US$]]7 million and a staff of 50 employees.

'''House of Representatives''' is the name of [[legislature|legislative bodies]] in many countries and sub-national entitles.  In many countries, the House of Representatives is the [[lower house]] of a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature, with the corresponding [[upper house]] often called a "[[Senate]]". In some countries, the House of Representatives is the sole chamber of a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature. 

The functioning of a house of representatives can vary greatly from country to country, and depends on whether a country has a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] or a [[presidential system]]. Members of a House of Representatives are typically apportioned according to population rather than geography.

==National legislatures==
The Indonesian [[People's Representative Council]] (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat'', DPR) is generally known in English as the "House of Representatives", as is the ''[[Dewan Rakyat]]'' of the [[Parliament of Malaysia]] and the [[Dáil Éireann]] of the Irish [[Oireachtas]] parliament.  In the 2012 draft for a new [[Constituent Assembly of Egypt|Constitution of Egypt]], the [[People's Assembly (Egypt)|People's Assembly]] is called "House of Representatives".

==Subnational legislatures==
''House of Representatives'' is the title of most, but not all, of the lower houses of [[State legislature (United States)|U.S. state legislatures]], with the exceptions usually called "[[State Assembly]]", "[[General assembly (disambiguation)#U.S. state legislatures|General Assembly]]", or more rarely, "[[House of Delegates (disambiguation)|House of Delegates]]".

In [[Germany]], the ''[[Landtag]]'' parliament of the city and [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Berlin]] (previously of [[West Berlin]]), the ''[[Abgeordnetenhaus of Berlin|Abgeordnetenhaus]]'' is known in English as the House of Representatives.

In [[Tanzania]], the semi-autonomous islands of [[Zanzibar]] has its own legislative body, the [[Zanzibar House of Representatives]].

==Defunct Houses of Representatives==
From 1867 until 1918, in [[Cisleithania]], the [[Austria]]n part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] monarchy, the lower house of the [[Imperial Council (Austria)|Imperial Council]] (''Reichsrat'') parliament, the ''Abgeordnetenhaus'' was generally known in English as "House of Representatives". Since 1855 the lower house in the ''[[Preußischer Landtag|Landtag]]'' assembly of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was called ''[[Prussian House of Representatives|Abgeordnetenhaus]]'', as distinct from the upper [[Prussian House of Lords|House of Lords]].

In 1934, the [[Nebraska]] voters approved a [[Nebraska Legislature|unicameral legislature]] dissolving the House of Representatives and granting its powers to the Senate.

The Kenyan [[House of Representatives (Kenya)|House of Representatives]] was combined with the [[Senate (Kenya)|Senate]] in 1966, to form an enlarged single chamber parliament, known as the [[National Assembly (Kenya)|National Assembly]]. The Senate was re-established as an upper house following the 2010 [[Kenyan constitutional referendum, 2010|Kenyan constitutional referendum]].

The [[House of Representatives (Ceylon)|House of Representatives]] of [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]) was the lower chamber of the [[Parliament of Ceylon|parliament]] established in 1947 according to the [[Soulbury Commission|Soulbury Constitution]]. The 1972 First Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka replaced it with the unicameral [[National State Assembly]].

Following the surrender of [[South Vietnam]] to [[North Vietnam]]ese and [[Viet Cong]] forces in 1975, a [[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|Provisional Revolutionary Government]] established itself in Saigon and disbanded the bicameral National Assembly consisting of the Senate and the House of Representatives. 

Under [[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]], the [[House of Representatives of South Africa|House of Representatives]] was the house for [[South Africa]]'s mixed race '[[Coloured]]' community, in the [[Tricameral Parliament]] of 1984 to 1994.

In 1994 the [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]] legislature of [[The Gambia]] was dissolved in a [[1994 Gambian coup d'état|coup d'état]] led by [[Yahya Jammeh]]. It was replaced by the [[The Gambia National Assembly|National Assembly]] according to the 1997 [[Constitution of The Gambia]].

'''''Humphrey's Executor v. United States''''', 295 U.S. 602 (1935),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Humphrey's Executor v. United States|295|602|1935}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case decided during the [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] presidency, regarding the powers that a [[President of the United States]] has to remove certain executive officials of a "quasi-legislative," "quasi-judicial" administrative body created by Congress, for purely political reasons and without the consent of Congress.

Roosevelt was dissatisfied with [[William E. Humphrey|William Humphrey]], a member of the [[Federal Trade Commission]], as Humphrey did not, in Roosevelt's view, support his [[New Deal]] policies vigorously enough.&lt;ref name=Mckenna&gt;{{Cite book|last=McKenna |first=Marian C. |title=Franklin Roosevelt and the Great Constitutional War: The Court-Packing Crisis of 1937 |publisher=Fordham University Press |year=2002 |pages=96–99 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=oPBjQegx8ZIC |isbn=0-8232-2154-7|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice, Roosevelt requested Humphrey to resign from the FTC, requests to which Humphrey did not yield. The third time, Roosevelt fired Humphrey: "Effective as of this date you are hereby removed from the office of Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission." Nevertheless, Humphrey continued to come to work at the FTC even after he was formally fired.&lt;ref name=Mckenna/&gt; However, the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] permitted the President to dismiss an FTC member only for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office." Roosevelt's decision to dismiss Humphrey was based solely on political differences rather than job performance or alleged acts of malfeasance.

The case went to the Supreme Court, but Humphrey died before the case could be decided. The case was then pursued by the [[executor]]s of his [[Estate (law)|estate]]; thus, the case obtained the title "Humphrey's Executor".

The Court distinguished between executive officers and quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial officers. The latter may be removed only with procedures consistent with statutory conditions enacted by Congress; the former serve at the pleasure of the President and may be removed at his discretion. The Court ruled that the Federal Trade Commission was a quasi-legislative body because of other powers it had and so the President could not fire an FTC member solely for political reasons; thus, Humphrey's firing was improper.

[[U.S. Attorney General]] [[Robert H. Jackson]], later to join the Supreme Court himself, said in his memoirs that Roosevelt was particularly annoyed by the Court's decision, as the President felt that it had been rendered in spite.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4455">A '''jobsworth'''  is a person who uses their job description in a deliberately uncooperative way, or who seemingly delights in acting in an obstructive or unhelpful manner. The term can also be applied to those who uphold petty rules even at the expense of humanity or [[common sense]]. 

"Jobsworth" is a [[British English|British]] [[colloquial]]&lt;ref name="OED" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/british/jobsworth  | title=jobsworth – definition | work=Macmillan Dictionary | publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers]] | accessdate=30 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; word derived from the phrase "I can't do that, it's more than my job's worth", meaning taking the initiative and performing an action that is beyond what the person feels is in their job description. The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines it as "A person in authority (esp. a minor official) who insists on adhering to rules and regulations or bureaucratic procedures even at the expense of common sense."&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;2nd Edition, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathon Green]] similarly defines "jobsworth" as "a minor [[wikt:factotum|factotum]] whose only status comes from enforcing otherwise petty regulations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Macmillan Dictionary of Contemporary Slang | year=1995 | isbn=0-333-63407-1 | last=Green | first=Jonathon | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | coauthor= | authorlink=Jonathon Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the phrase which gave rise to the term occurs in the 1965 [[Beatles]] movie ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', when [[Roy Kinnear]]'s character, the assistant scientist  Algernon, exclaims "Well it's more than my job's worth to stop him when he's like this, he's out to rule the world...if he can get a government grant."

Another early use was by UK [[Folk music|folk]]-singer [[Jeremy Taylor (singer)|Jeremy Taylor]], in a song he wrote in the late 1960s:
{{poemquote
|text=Jobsworth, Jobsworth, It's more than me job's worth,
I don't care, rain or snow,
whatever you want the answer's no,
I can keep you waiting for hours in the queue,
and if you don't like it you know what you can do.}}

The term became widespread in [[vernacular]] English through its use in the popular 1970s [[BBC]] [[television]] programme ''[[That's Life!]]'' which featured [[Esther Rantzen]] covering various [[human interest]] and [[Consumerism|consumer]] topics. A "Jobsworth of the Week" commissionaire's hat was awarded each week to "a startling tale of going by the book".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/597889.stm BBC News: "Your job's worth more than you are"].&lt;/ref&gt;

The term remains in use, particularly in the UK, to characterise inflexible employees, petty rule-following and excessive administration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199596/cmhansrd/vo960501/debtext/60501-10.htm House of Commons Hansard Debates for 1 May 1996 (pt 10)] "There seems to be here an element of what might qualify for Esther Rantzen's "jobsworth" award. I would certainly like to look at it more closely. I will therefore follow up the matters that my hon. Friend has raised today, and I hope to be able to write to him in due course."&lt;/ref&gt;

The slang expression "Little [[Hitler]]" is also used in Britain with a similar meaning.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/citybreaks/cities-of-culture/11394950/A-bossy-little-Hitler-is-still-making-waves-80-years-on.html "A bossy 'little Hitler’ is still making waves 80 years on"], The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bus-driver-conducted-like-little-Hitler-claims/story-19493612-detail/story.html "Bus driver conducted himself like a little Hitler, claims angry pensioner"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714161314/http://www.bristolpost.co.uk/Bus-driver-conducted-like-little-Hitler-claims/story-19493612-detail/story.html |date=2015-07-14 }}, Bristol Post&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10981">The '''Law Against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination''' ({{lang-es|Ley 045 Contra el Racismo y Toda Forma de Discriminación}}; often called the '''Law Against Racism''') is a [[statute]] passed by the [[Plurinational Legislative Assembly]] of [[Bolivia]] as '''Law 045''' and promulgated by [[Presidents of Bolivia|President]] [[Evo Morales]] into law as '''Law 737/2010''' on 10 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Plurinational Legislative Assembly. [http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/13/181602_pdf.pdf Ley 045] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004104309/http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/13/181602_pdf.pdf |date=2012-10-04 }}. October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The law prohibits discrimination and discriminatory aggression by public and private institutions and individuals, creates a governmental Committee Against Racism and All Forms of Discrimination, and bars the dissemination of racist and discriminatory ideas through the mass media. The provisions of the law applying to the media caused extensive controversy and were opposed by mainstream publications and media worker associations.

==Legislative process==
The first draft of the law was proposed by the Human Rights Committee of the Bolivian Chamber of Deputies on 24 May 2010, the anniversary of [[May 24, 2008 violence in Sucre|an incident of racist violence in Sucre in 2008]].&lt;ref name=Archondo&gt;{{Cite journal | issue = 32 | pages = 7–8 | last = Archondo | first = Rafael | title = Una historia de las "mordazas" | journal = Le Monde diplomatiqué (Bolivian edition) | date =January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following approval by the Chamber of Deputies, the Senate took up consideration of the Law in October. The law was considered first by the Constitution Committee, whose chair, Senator Eduardo Maldonado (MAS-IPSP, [[Potosí Department|Potosí]]) declared he was open to revisions in the law. On 4 October, a plenary session of the Senate replaced Maldonado with Eugenio Rojas (MAS-IPSP) as chair of the committee, assuring no changes would be made in committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Racismo: MAS destituye a presidente de Comisión | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-01-11 | date = 2010-10-05 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20101005/racismo-mas-destituye-a-presidente-de-comision_92754_178866.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law, unchanged from the version approved by the Deputies, was considered in plenary from 16:45 on 7 October to 05:15 on 8 October. The session was tumultuous and included frequent interruptions by opponents of the bill. Opposition lawmakers unsuccessfully proposed a revocation referendum on Articles 16 and 23. The bill was passed by the Senate by a greater than two-thirds majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Evo promulga cuestionada Ley Antirracismo, hay duelo en la prensa | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-01-11 | date = 2010-10-08 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20101008/evo-promulga-cuestionada-ley-antirracismo-hay-duelo-en-la_93263_179950.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Evo Morales promulgated the measure into law on 8 October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Presidente promulga dos leyes y dice que el cambio en Bolivia es irreversible | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2011-01-11 | date = 2010-10-08 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20101008/presidente-promulga-dos-leyes-y-dice-que-el-cambio-en-bolivia-es_93267_179957.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prohibitions==
===Service and public accommodations===
Article 13 penalizes the following acts by public servants:
*Racist or discriminatory verbal aggression
*Denial of service for racist or discriminatory reasons
*Physical, psychological or sexual maltreatment for racist or discriminatory reasons
The internal regulations of public agencies must prohibit such acts, accept complaints about them, and must turn over criminally culpable employees for prosecution.

Article 14 penalizes the following acts in private institutions:
*Racist or discriminatory verbal aggression
*Denial of service for racist or discriminatory reasons
*Physical, psychological or sexual maltreatment for racist or discriminatory reasons, when these are not criminal
*Denigrating actions
Private institutions must revise their internal regulations so that any of these acts by employees are considered internal faults, must share denunciations made against their employees with the Committee against Racism, and must inform prosecutors of criminal acts.

Article 15 prohibits discrimination in the right to enter establishments serving the public, including the hanging of signs advertising such discrimination. Municipalities have the responsibility to enforce this norm by three days of closure at the first offense, thirty days on the second, and definitive closure on the third.

===Criminal acts===
Article 21 of the law makes racist or discriminatory motives an aggravating factor for all crimes, many subject to a one-third increase in minimum sentence and one-half increase in maximum sentence, not exceeding the overall maximum set by the Bolivian constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Plurinational Legislative Assembly. [http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/13/181602_pdf.pdf Ley 045] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004104309/http://www.lostiempos.com/media_pdf/2010/10/13/181602_pdf.pdf |date=2012-10-04 }}. October 2010. Article 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Articles 22 and 23 create a series of "crimes against human dignity," as Chapter V of Title VIII of the Bolivian Penal Code. These are:
*The crime of '''Racism''': "to arbitrary and illegally restrict, annul, devalue or impede the exercise of individual or collective rights on the basis of race, national or ethic origin, color, ancestry, membership in a nation, indigenous originary campesino people, or the Afro-Bolivian people, or the use of the clothing or language of such people," punishable by three to seven years of deprivation of liberty. The crime is aggravated if committed by a public servant or a private individual providing public service, or committed with violence.
*The crime of '''Discrimination''': "to arbitrary and illegally obstruct, restrict, devalue, impede, or annul the exercise of individual or collective rights on the basis of sex, age, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity,  cultural identity, family background, nationality, citizenship, language, religious creed, ideology, political or philosophical opinion, civil status, economic or social condition, illness, type of occupation, grade of instruction, physical, intellectual or sensory handicap or alternate capacity, pregnancy, regional origin, physical appearance, or clothing," punishable by one to five years of deprivation of liberty. The crime is aggravated if committed by a public servant or a private individual providing public service, or committed with violence.
*The crime of '''Diffusion and incitement to racism and discrimination''': "to disseminate through any media ideas based on racial superiority or hate, or than promote and/or justify racism or discrimination" for the motives described above; and "to incite violence against or persecution of people or groups of people on the basis of racist or discriminatory motives," punishable by one to five years of deprivation of liberty. The crime is aggravated if committed by a public servant or a public authority. Media workers and media owners do not benefit from immunity or ''fuero''.
*Banning '''Racist or discriminatory organizations and associations''': Membership in organizations or associations that "promote and/or justify racism or discrimination" as defined above, or "incite to hatred of, violence against, and persecution of persons or groups of persons on the basis of racist or discriminatory motives" is criminalized, punishable by one to four years of deprivation of liberty. The crime is aggravated if committed by a public servant or a public authority.
*The crime of '''Racist or discriminatory verbal aggression''': "the realization of insults or other verbal aggression for racist or discriminatory motives," punishable by 40 days to 18 months of community service work and a fine of forty to 150 days' wages. The crime is aggravated if committed in print, manuscript or media. If an accused person who retracts the aggression at or before the time of indictment, the criminal process is extinguished; however, only one retraction may be considered. Retractions must be issued by the same medium and with the same reach as the original aggression, with the responsible party assuming the costs involved.
Article 24 also considers a variety of instances of discriminatory actions which may be considered through private, civil actions between the parties involved.

==Controversy with Bolivian media==
The law's Article 16, concerning the mass media, and part of Article 23, which states that no one is exempt from the law, were sharply opposed by Bolivian and some international media associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Racismo: más entidades de prensa alertan riesgos | work = Los Tiempos | accessdate = 2010-12-30 | date = 2010-09-23 | url = http://www.lostiempos.com/diario/actualidad/politica/20100923/racismo-mas-entidades-de-prensa-alertan-riesgos_90917_174925.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 16.''' (''Mass Media''). A medium which authorizes and publishes racist and discriminatory ideas will be subject to economic sanctions and to suspension of its license to function, subject to regulation.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Article 23''' (''Adding to the penal code'') […]  Article 281 fourth sub-part (Diffusion and Incitement to Racism or Discrimination). […] II. When the act is committed by a worker in the media, or the proprietor of one, he or she will not be able to allege immunity or fuero of any kind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[La Razón (La Paz)|La Razón]], the final version of the law softens penalties for broadcasting racist ideas and requires media outlets  to allocate spaces or scheduling time to anti-racism educational content.&lt;ref name="Maira Magro/JV"&gt;[http://knightcenter.utexas.edu/blog/bolivian-press-says-final-anti-racism-law-softens-penalties-media Bolivian press says final anti-racism law softens penalties for media] Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, [[University of Texas at Austin]], December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Razón"&gt;[http://www.la-razon.com/version.php?ArticleId=122905&amp;EditionId=2384 REGLAMENTO FIJA MULTAS, PERO NO CIERRE DE MEDIOS], [[La Razón (La Paz)|La Razón]] December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9628">This article delineates '''lawsuits involving [[Dell|Dell Inc.]]'''.

* In 1997 [[Håkan Lans]] sued Dell for infringement of his color-graphics display patent, U.S. patent no. 4,303,986.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. patent no. {{US patent|4303986|4,303,986}}, Data Processing system and apparatus for color graphics display,  Dec. 1, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Dell won the case because Lans did not have any ownership interest in the patent, having assigned it to a corporation that he owned.
* In 2005, Dell began the construction of a facility in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_25/ai_n15732802 "Dell Delivers Computer Assembly Plant to North Carolina"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206143718/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2005_Oct_25/ai_n15732802 |date=2008-12-06 }}, an advisory from Industrialinfo.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many claims emerged that Dell had used unfair practices to obtain huge incentives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/23/Dell_nc_suit The Register: Sci/Tech News for the World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310013620/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/06/23/dell_nc_suit/ |date=2010-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell Inc. fought a lawsuit which the court system later dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/438280.html "Dell wins incentives lawsuit"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104153915/http://www.newsobserver.com/104/story/438280.html |date=2009-01-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2005, Dell filed a lawsuit in a Paris court to sue [[Minorca]]-based independent website-designer Paul Dell of [http://www.Dellimages.com "Dellimages"] for engaging in "parasitism and unfair competition". This related to his company website "DellWebsites".{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} &lt;!-- what happened subsequently? --&gt;
* On January 31, 2007, some shareholders filed a [[lawsuit]] accusing Dell and Intel of conspiring, and accusing Dell executives (including Michael Dell) of [[options backdating|backdating options]] and of propped [[financial report]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://www.betanews.com/article/Inside_the_Dell_Shareholder_Lawsuit_Did_Dell_and_Intel_Conspire/1170465943 | title = Inside the Dell Shareholder Lawsuit: Did Dell and Intel Conspire? }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific allegations claimed that:
** Dell had received [[Kickback (bribery)|kickback]] from Intel to maintain Intel exclusivity
** Dell had used the funds to prop up its sales-figures
** Dell reduced the period and scope of its warranties and cut corners on manufacturing and testing in order to funnel additional funds to sales; causing the stock-price to inflate to around $40 per share
** once stock-prices had peaked, several Dell executives, including Michael Dell, sold massive amounts of their personal stock-holdings to benefit from the artificially inflated stock-price
* On February 8, 2007, seven current and former workers at a call-center in [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]], [[Oregon]] sued the computer-maker, saying the company worked its [[sales representative|sales rep]]s "off the clock", failed to provide proper rest-breaks and improperly recorded their lunch-periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-Dellsuit.pdf | archive-url=http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20070809030459/http://atwork.blogs.oregonlive.com/uploads/487501-dellsuit.pdf | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-08-09 | work=The Oregonian | title=OregonLive.com: At Work }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moves have begun to turn the case into a [[class action]]. Dell suddenly closed down the facility at Roseburg, Oregon on August 2, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oregonnews.com/article/20070803/NEWS/70803011 newsreview.info - Serving Roseburg &amp; Douglas County, Oregon - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204150629/http://www.oregonnews.com/article/20070803/NEWS/70803011 |date=2008-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The facility had consisted of computer and electronics sales-agents and of customer-service representatives.
* In March 2007 an article titled "Computer Giant Faces Consumer Lawsuit Consumers Allege They Didn't Get the Tech Support They Paid For" appeared on an ABC News website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Technology/story?id=3179394&amp;page=1 ABC News: Dell Sued Over Shoddy Tech Support&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "Part of the suit claims that though Dell gave the impression of an "award-winning service" available to consumers "24 hours a day, seven days a week", consumers faced "nightmarish obstacles" to get help and technical service for their computers. [[New York State Attorney General]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] said that New York had received 700 complaints about Dell — more than the number of complaints for any other related subject.
* In May 2007, Andrew Cuomo filed a lawsuit against Dell for "false advertising and deceptive business practices, including offering misleading financing, and failing to honor rebates, warranties and service contracts". [https://archive.is/20130120034542/http://news.com.com/8301-10784_3-9719804-7.html?part=rss&amp;subj=news&amp;tag=2547-1_3-0-20] Dell spokesman Bob Pearson portrayed the lawsuit as based on only a small portion of Dell's customers and as in no way reflecting the way the company treats its customers. Dell's hardware-warranty contract says that customers must troubleshoot over the phone — including possibly opening the computer — before Dell will send a technical service provider to replace a part. On May 27, 2008, State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Teresi required  Dell to clarify its financing and warranty criteria, saying the computer maker engaged in fraud, false advertising, deceptive business and abusive debt-collection practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=NY judge: Dell engaged in fraud, false advertising |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/wtMostRead/idUSN2739846420080527 |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-05-27 |accessdate=2008-05-28 | first=Daisuke | last=Wakabayashi}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Parties have filed more than 1,000 additional complaints with the attorney general's office since the initial filing of the lawsuit in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,359066,00.html Fox News]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On December 5, 2007, [[Typhoon Touch Technologies]] filed a lawsuit naming ''Dell inc.'' along with other defendants, and alleging patent-violations over Dell's use of [[touchscreen]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;
United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, Captioned Typhoon Touch Technologies, Inc. and Nova Mobility Systems, Inc. v. Motion Computing, Inc. and Dell, Inc., Civil Action No. 6:07cv546. [http://www.secinfo.com/d158sb.t8.htm Online copy of filing]&lt;/ref&gt;
* On June 25, 2009, Dell made a major pricing error on its Taiwan web page, labeling all of Dell's product around $30 to $220 lower or higher than the intended price. Dell spent 8 hours responding to this error. Dell announced that in consequence customers submitted about 140,000 orders for monitors and notebooks to Dell Taiwan{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. After a week, the company apologized for the error. Taiwan's Consumer Protection Commission suggested that due to pricing error Dell should at least sell each customer one product at the contract price, and then offer a discount on the additional orders. However, Dell refused to comply and continues in discussions with Taiwan's authorities{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.
* On July 5, 2009, following the previous incident, Dell again suffered from a pricing error in Taiwan. Dell labeled its Latitude E4300 laptop PCs (then normally priced at $2,101.34 in Taiwan, $45,678,450 in the U.S.A. and in Hong Kong) for sale at $563.40 on its online sales page for 8 hours, according to Taiwan's Consumer Protection Commission{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}. After notification by a reporter, Dell responded to this error 6 hours later after netting around 40,000 orders of the product. The company suspended its online sales for three days to fix the system. Dell apologized for the errors and offered $600 dated coupons on this product to people who had purchased computers at misprinted prices. However, the Taiwan Consumer Protection Commission (CPC) claimed it "cannot accept" such a response, because even if customers use the coupons, the price would still exceed the market price in Taiwan and other countries. On July 29, 2009, the CPC fined Dell  $30,000 because Dell did not establish its ''[[bona fides]]'' with its customers on this issue. The CPC stated "If Dell wouldn't have the agreement with the customers within two weeks, the company will not only be suspended its business in Taiwan but also penalized $45,000 each day"{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}.
* On June 28, 2010, [[The New York Times]] described a civil case against Dell in Federal District Court in [[North Carolina]], in which Dell shipped at least 11.8 million computers from May 2003 to July 2005 that were at risk of failing because of faulty capacitors made by the Japanese manufacturer [[Nichicon]]. The suit alleges that these faulty components in Dell's OptiPlex desktop computers, were known by Dell to cause problems or computer failure up to 97 percent of the time over a three-year period, and yet it is alleged that Dell knowingly concealed these component problems from customers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/technology/29dell.html?hp In Faulty Computer Suit, Window to Dell’s Fall, The New York Times, 28 June 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since first coming to wide notice in the late 1990s, the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' book series by [[J. K. Rowling]] has engendered a number of legal disputes. Rowling, her various publishers and [[Time Warner]], the owner of the rights to the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' films]], have taken numerous legal actions to protect their copyrights, and also have fielded accusations of copyright theft themselves.&lt;ref name="Potter author zaps court rival"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|publisher=CNN|title=Potter author zaps court rival|date=19 July 2002|accessdate=11 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629165519/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/UK/09/19/rowling.court/index.html|archivedate=29 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide popularity of the ''Harry Potter'' series has led to the appearance of a number of locally produced, unauthorised sequels and other derivative works, sparking efforts to ban or contain them.&lt;ref name=yemets&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/mpapps/pagetools/print/news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/2846105.stm|title=Rowling seeks 'Grotter' ban|publisher=BBC News|date=13 March 2003|accessdate=31 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these legal proceedings have countered a number of cases of outright piracy,&lt;ref name=walkup&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2092661.stm|publisher=BBC News|title=Fake Harry Potter novel hits China|date=4 July 2002|accessdate=11 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; other attempts have targeted not-for-profit endeavours and have been criticised.&lt;ref name=Claire&gt;{{cite web|title=Warner Brothers bullying ruins Field family Xmas|author=Kieren McCarthy|publisher=The Register|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/21/warner_brothers_bullying_ruins_field/ |date=21 December 2000|accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of legal dispute involves a series of injunctions obtained by Rowling and her publishers to prohibit anyone from distributing or reading her books before their official release dates. The sweeping powers of these injunctions have occasionally drawn fire from civil liberties and free speech campaigners and sparked debates over the "right to read".&lt;ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stallman.org/harry-potter.html|title=Don't Buy Harry Potter Books|year=2005|author=Richard Stallman|publisher=stallman.org|accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=geist&gt;{{cite web|title=Harry Potter and the Right to Read|author=Michael Geist|publisher=michaelgeist.ca|url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=896|date=17 July 2005|accessdate=12 October 2007}}{{cite news|work=The [[Toronto Star]]|date=18 July 2005|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/868524161.html?dids=868524161:868524161&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+18%2C+2005&amp;author=Michael+Geist&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.03&amp;desc=Harry+Potter+and+the+amazing+injunction|title=Appeared in|accessdate=26 September 2008 | first=Michael | last=Geist}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these injunctions was used in an unrelated trespassing case as precedent supporting the issuance of an injunction against a [[John Doe]].&lt;ref name=injunction&gt;{{cite web|title=Hampshire Waste Services Ltd v.

Outside these controversies, a number of particular incidents related to ''Harry Potter'' have also led, or almost led, to legal action. In 2005, a man was sentenced to four years in prison after firing a replica gun at a journalist during a staged deal for stolen copies of an unreleased ''Harry Potter'' novel, and attempting to blackmail the publisher with threats of releasing secrets from the book.&lt;ref name=corby&gt;{{cite news|title=Man jailed for Potter theft|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/19/pressandpublishing.ukcrime|date=19 January 2006|work=The Guardian  |location=London|accessdate=23 May 2007 | first=Mark | last=Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 2007 [[Bloomsbury Publishing]] contemplated legal action against the supermarket chain [[Asda]] for libel after the company accused them of overpricing the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Asda barred from selling seventh Harry Potter|author=Nigel Reynolds|work=The Telegraph|date=17 July 2007|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1557690/Asda-barred-from-selling-seventh-Harry-Potter.html|accessdate=1 August 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A comprehensive list of intellectual property and speech lawsuits involving ''Harry Potter'', [http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2015/07/harry-potter-lawsuits-and-where-to-find-them/ Harry Potter Lawsuits and Where to Find Them],  was compiled by attorney [http://www.foleyhoag.com/people/kluft-david David Kluft] in 2015 for the [http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/ Trademark and Copyright Law Blog].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com/2015/07/harry-potter-lawsuits-and-where-to-find-them/|title=Harry Potter Lawsuits and Where to Find Them {{!}} Trademark and Copyright Law|website=www.trademarkandcopyrightlawblog.com|access-date=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Allegations of copyright and trademark infringement against Rowling ==
{{See also|Harry Potter influences and analogues}}

=== Nancy Stouffer ===
In 1999, American author Nancy Kathleen Stouffer alleged [[copyright infringement|copyright]] and [[trademark infringement]] by Rowling of her 1984 works ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'' ({{ISBN|1-58989-400-6}}) and ''Larry Potter and His Best Friend Lilly''.&lt;ref name="Potter author zaps court rival" /&gt; The primary basis for Stouffer's case rested in her own purported invention of the word "[[Muggle]]s", the name of a race of [[mutant]] [[humanoids]] in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles'', and Larry Potter, the title character of a series of activity booklets for children. Larry Potter, like Harry Potter, is a bespectacled boy with dark hair,&lt;ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard" /&gt; though he is not a character in ''The Legend of Rah and the Muggles''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Harry Potter' Prevails In Court|author=Hillel Italie|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/19/print/main522563.shtml|publisher=CBS News|date=19 September 2002|accessdate=8 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stouffer also drew a number of other comparisons, such as a castle on a lake, a receiving room and wooden doors.&lt;ref name="Muggle Versus Wizard"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|work=The Washington Post|title=Muggle Versus Wizard|date=28 March 2001|accessdate=11 March 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518113345/http://discuss.washingtonpost.com/zforum/01/author_stouffer032801.htm|archivedate=18 May 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Portions of ''Rah'' were originally published in booklet form in 1986 by Ande Publishing Company, a company founded by Stouffer together with a group of friends and family.&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;Scholastic, Inc. v.

Rowling, along with [[Scholastic Press]] (her American publisher) and [[Warner Bros.]] (holders of the series' film rights), pre-empted Stouffer in 2002 with a suit of their own seeking a [[declaratory judgment]] that they had not infringed on any of Stouffer's works. The court found in Rowling's favour, granting summary judgment and holding that "no reasonable juror could find a likelihood of confusion as to the source of the two parties' works".&lt;ref name=opinion /&gt; During the course of the trial, it was held that Rowling proved "by clear and convincing evidence, that Stouffer has perpetrated a fraud on the Court through her submission of fraudulent documents as well as through her untruthful testimony",&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; including changing pages years after the fact to retroactively insert the word "muggle".&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Her case was dismissed with prejudice and she was fined $50,000 for her "pattern of intentional bad faith conduct" in relation to her employment of fraudulent submissions, along with being ordered to pay a portion of the plaintiffs' legal fees.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Stouffer appealed the decision in 2004, but in 2005 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit|Second Circuit Court of Appeals]] affirmed the ruling.&lt;ref&gt;''Scholastic Inc. v.

=== The Wyrd Sisters ===
In 2005, Warner Bros. offered CAD$5,000 (later CAD$50,000) to the Canadian folk band the [[Wyrd Sisters (band)|Wyrd Sisters]] for the rights to use their name in the film version of ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]''.&lt;ref name=chart&gt;{{cite web|title=Winnipeg's Wyrd Sisters Still Fighting Harry Potter |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/41504/winnipegs-wyrd-sisters-still-fighting-harry-potter |date=7 April 2006 |publisher=[[Chart (magazine)|''Chart'' magazine]] |accessdate=23 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405020832/http://www.chartattack.com/news/41504/winnipegs-wyrd-sisters-still-fighting-harry-potter |archivedate=5 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowling had written a scene in the novel in which a band called the [[The Weird Sisters (Harry Potter)|Weird Sisters]] appeared at a school dance, and the group owned the rights to the name in Canada. However, the offer was declined, and instead the band undertook a legal action against Warner Bros., as well as [[Jarvis Cocker]] of [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]] and [[Jonny Greenwood]] and [[Phil Selway]] of [[Radiohead]], who were to play the band in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/04/wyrdlawsuit_051104.html |title='Wyrd Sisters' cannot stop Harry Potter |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=4 September 2005 |accessdate=3 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527023912/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/story/2005/11/04/wyrdlawsuit_051104.html |archivedate=27 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; All plans to use the name in the movie were later abandoned. Despite that decision, the Canadian band filed a CAD$40-million ($39&amp;nbsp;million) lawsuit against Warner in Ontario court. In connection with the lawsuit, the band brought an [[interlocutory]] [[injunction]] hoping to prevent the release of the film. The injunction application was dismissed.&lt;ref name=wyrd /&gt; The entire suit was dismissed in November 2005. In June 2006, an Ontario judge decreed that the band pay Warner Bros.

In June 2009, the estate of Adrian Jacobs, a children's author who died in 1997, sued Rowling's publishers, Bloomsbury, for £500&amp;nbsp;million, accusing her of having plagiarised "substantial parts" of his work in writing the novel ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JK Rowling sued for £500m in plagiarism lawsuit by family of late ''Willy The Wizard'' author|work=Daily Mail  |location=UK |author=Ryan Kisiel|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1193283/JK-Rowling-sued-500m-plagiarism-lawsuit-family-late-Willy-The-Wizard-author.html|accessdate=16 June 2009 | date=16 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=straits&gt;{{cite web|title=Rowling didn't plagiarise |publisher=Reuters |year=2009 |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_390898.html |accessdate=16 June 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619205429/http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/Lifestyle/Story/STIStory_390898.html |archivedate=19 June 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Jacobs's family claimed that a scene in ''Goblet of Fire'' was substantially similar to Jacobs's book ''The Adventures of Willy the Wizard: Livid Land:'' "'Both Willy and Harry are required to work out the exact nature of the main task of the contest which they both achieve in a bathroom assisted by clues from helpers, in order to discover how to rescue human hostages imprisoned by a community of half-human, half-animal fantasy creatures."&lt;ref name=straits /&gt; They also launched a joint suit against Rowling and her publishers.

On 6 January 2011, the US lawsuit against Scholastic was dismissed.

In 2002, an unauthorised Chinese-language sequel titled ''Harry Potter and Bao Zoulong'' (Chinese: Simplified: 哈利波特与豹走龙, Traditional: 哈利波特與豹走龍, [[Hanyu Pinyin]]: ''Hālì Bōtè yǔ Bào Zǒulóng'') appeared for sale in the People's Republic of China.

Also in 2003, courts in the Netherlands prevented the distribution of a Dutch translation of ''[[Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass]]'', the first of [[Dmitri Yemets]]' popular Russian series about a female apprentice wizard.

== Legal injunctions ==
[[File:Harry Potter VI boxes.jpg|thumb|300 px|Boxes of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' awaiting delivery]]
Rowling and her publishers have brought a series of legal [[injunction]]s to ensure the books' secrecy before their launch. These injunctions have drawn criticism from [[civil liberties]] campaigners over their potentially sweeping powers over individual freedoms.

In 2003, in an attempt to maintain secrecy over the impending release of the fifth ''Harry Potter'' book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix]]'', Rowling and her publishers sought and received a groundbreaking injunction against "the person or persons who has or have physical possession of a copy of the said book or any part thereof without the consent of the Claimants".&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; The ruling obtained, for the first time in British law, an injunction against unnamed or unknown individuals; before then, injunctions could only be obtained against named individuals. Lawyers Winterbothams noted that, "The new ''Harry Potter'' style injunction could be used if you expected a demonstration or trespass to take place, but which had not yet begun, so long as you could find a description for the people expected which the Court was satisfied identified 'those who are included and those who are not'".&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; The "Potter injunction" was later used against a camp of [[Romani people|Roma]] travellers.&lt;ref name=injunction /&gt; In 2006, pharmaceutical company [[GlaxoSmithKline]] employed the injunction against anonymous animal rights campaigners who had sent threatening letters to their investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Animal extremists can no longer hide behind a web of secrecy |author=Dan Tench |work=The Times | location=London |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/law/article722258.ece |date= 23 May 2006 |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series garnered more controversy in 2005 with the release of the sixth book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'', when a [[Real Canadian Superstore]] grocery store accidentally sold several copies before the authorised release date. The Canadian publisher, [[Raincoast Books]], obtained an injunction from the [[Supreme Court of British Columbia]] prohibiting the purchasers from reading the books in their possession. A comment by a media lawyer that "there is no human right to read" led to a debate in the public sphere about whether free access to information was a human right. [[Michael Geist]], the [[Canada Research Chair]] of Internet and E-commerce Law at the [[University of Ottawa]], said in response, "The copyright law claim was particularly puzzling. While copyright law does provide copyright owners with a basket of exclusive rights, the right to prohibit reading is not among them. In fact, copyright law has very little to say about what people can do with a book once they have purchased it."&lt;ref name=geist /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Reading ban on leaked Harry Potter |author=Jack Malvern |work=The Times | location=London|date= 13 July 2005|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article543318.ece|accessdate=11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free-speech activist [[Richard Stallman]] posted a statement on his blog calling for a boycott until the publisher issued an apology.&lt;ref name="Don't Buy Harry Potter Books" /&gt; Solicitors Fraser Milner and Casgrain, who represented Raincoast and formulated the legal argument for the embargo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Notice: Raincoast Books |publisher=Raincoast Books |url=http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html |date= 25 August 2005|accessdate=27 October 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071018031618/http://www.raincoast.com/harrypotter/injunction-commentary.html |archivedate = 18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; have rebutted this, saying that the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] applies only to the government, not to private litigation, and does not offer any protection of the right to read in any case, and the innocent purchasers of the ''Harry Potter'' book had no more right to read it than if they had come into possession of someone's secret diary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding the Harry Potter Injunction: Protecting Copyright and Confidential Information |author=Barbara Grossman, Aaron Milrad and Annie Na |publisher=Fraser Milner and Casgrain |url=http://www.fmc-law.com/upload/en/publications/20052006/655380_HarryPotterInjunction_October21_2005.pdf |format=PDF|year=2005 |accessdate=30 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Scholastic Corporation]] threatened legal action against two booksellers, Levy Home Entertainment and DeepDiscount.com, for selling copies of the final novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', before its release date of 21 July. In an official statement, Scholastic appealed "to the ''Harry Potter'' fans who bought their books from DeepDiscount.com and may receive copies early requesting that they keep the packages hidden until midnight on 21 July."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scholastic will take action against Harry Potter distributors |publisher=Reuters |date=18 July 2007 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/industryNews/idUSWEN939320070718 |accessdate=18 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who agreed not to read the book received a special ''Harry Potter'' t-shirt and a $50 coupon for Scholastic's online store.

In June 2005, Aaron Lambert, a security guard at a book distribution centre in [[Corby]], Northamptonshire, England, stole a number of pages from ''[[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]'' six weeks before its intended publication date. He was arrested a day later after negotiations to sell them to John Askill, a journalist from ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', turned violent. Lambert reportedly fired a shot from his imitation [[Walther PPK]] pistol, but Askill was unharmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Guard admits to Harry Potter theft|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4327346.stm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124150123/http://www.jrrobertssecurity.com/security-news/security-crime-news0082.htm|archivedate=24 January 2008|date=13 October 2005|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At his trial the following October, Lambert pleaded guilty to threatening Askill and to attempting to blackmail ''Harry Potter'''s publishers, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Potter book thief admits threats|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/northamptonshire/4546164.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=20 December 2005|accessdate=23 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, Lambert was sentenced to four and a half years in prison.&lt;ref name=corby /&gt; In November 2011, in her testimony before the [[Leveson Inquiry]], Rowling said that the ''Sun'' had attempted to "blackmail" her into a photo-op in return for returning the stolen manuscript.&lt;ref name=cnn1&gt;{{cite web|title=J.K.

== Accusation of libel ==
In July 2007, a dispute arose between ''Harry Potter'''s British publisher, [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]], and [[Asda]], a British supermarket chain owned by the US corporation [[Wal-Mart]]. On 15 July, a week before the release of the final ''Harry Potter'' novel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'', Asda issued a press release accusing Bloomsbury of unfairly fixing their prices. Asda spokesman Peter Pritchard claimed that Bloomsbury was "holding children to ransom" and that, "[i]t seems like Bloomsbury need to do a [[Quidditch|quid-ditch]] as they have sent their prices up north on the [[Hogwarts Express]]. By setting the [[Suggested retail price|recommended retail price]] at this level can only be seen {{sic}} as blatant profiteering on their part." Pritchard went on to say that Asda was acting to "champion the right of young readers", and that the recommended retail price was "twice the average child's pocket money and £5 more than the average children's bestseller".&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; Asda had planned to sell the book as a [[loss leader]] at £8.87 ($16.30), or half Bloomsbury's [[recommended retail price]] of £17.99 ($33.00) and below the wholesale price of £9.89 ($18.00).

Two days later, Bloomsbury responded that the claims were "potentially libellous" and that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Asda's latest attempt to draw attention to themselves involves trying to leap on the ''Harry Potter'' bandwagon. This is just another example of their repeated efforts of appearing as Robin Hood in the face of controversy about their worldwide group, which would suggest they are perceived as more akin to the Sheriff of Nottingham. Loss leaders were invented by supermarkets and have nothing to do with Bloomsbury Publishing or ''Harry Potter'' and we deeply regret having been dragged into their price-wars.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Bloomsbury stated that the price hike of £1 from the previous ''Harry Potter'' novel was due to it having been printed on recycled paper. "There is a price to be paid by the consumer for environmental best practice", a Bloomsbury spokeswoman said.&lt;ref name=makepeace&gt;{{cite web|title=Bloomsbury: Asda must make peace|author=Katherine Rushton|publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42122-bloomsbury-asda-must-make-peace.html|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloomsbury CEO Nigel Newton said, "[They have] unleashed a very disingenuous, self-interested attack on us. This is complete nonsense and all they're doing is grandstanding as they've done on the price of aspirin and bread. They try to turn it into a big deal as though it's a moral crusade for them, but it's nothing of the kind."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

That same day, Bloomsbury cancelled all Asda's orders of ''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'', or roughly 500,000 copies, citing unpaid bills from the company totalling £38,000 ($70,000) for unauthorised returns of the sixth ''Harry Potter'' book.&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt; "The two matters are completely unrelated", said a Bloomsbury spokeswoman, "We decided today that we couldn't risk having arrears with anybody."&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; The dispute had been "going on a while – going on for weeks actually."&lt;ref name=lifestyle&gt;{{cite web|title=Asda Apologises following Potter Book Row|publisher=UK News Lifestyle Extra|url=http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&amp;news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713204528/http://www.lifestyleextra.com/ShowStory.asp?story=BZ1739815T&amp;news_headline=asda_apologises_following_potter_book_row__#|archive-date=13 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asda responded that Bloomsbury owed them £122,000 ($224,000) ("for pulping and for other book trade issues and work we have done for them"&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;) and that, as one company spokesman claimed, "It just seems funny that after we expose the potty Potter price hike, Bloomsbury are trying everything they can to stop kids getting hold of ''Harry Potter'' at a price they can afford."

Asda paid the bill within hours, and claimed that Bloomsbury would be in breach of contract if it did not allow the store to sell its books. However, Bloomsbury claimed that the block on Asda's orders was still in place as, "Unfortunately, we've now had to initiate a significant libel claim against them. That matter will have to be dealt with. If they want their 500,000 books, they'll have to come and make peace with us&amp;nbsp;... It could be good news for all their disappointed customers, because they don't have to go to a soulless Asda shed to buy their book and they can share the magic of ''Harry Potter'' at an independent or specialist bookstore instead."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

Upon receipt of Bloomsbury's legal letter, Asda responded that, "There is nothing defamatory in our press release. Everything there is factual. It is a commentary on how we see things."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt; Said another Asda spokesperson, "If they don't supply us with the books, it will have a massive implication and [be] a breach of contract – but I don't think they will do that."&lt;ref name=makepeace /&gt;

Later that day, however, Asda released a statement retracting its original comment: "We apologise unreservedly to Bloomsbury for [our] press release dated 15 July and withdraw our statement. We look forward to a good relationship with Bloomsbury going forward, including selling the latest ''Harry Potter'' book from 00:01&amp;nbsp;am BST on Saturday 21 July and many other Bloomsbury books in the future".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asda apologises to Bloomsbury|author=Philip Jones |publisher=thebookseller.com|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42186-asda-apologises-to-bloomsbury.html|date=17 July 2007|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Bloomsbury lifted the block and Asda was allowed to sell its books. The original press release was then expunged.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|title=Harry Potter and the Asda Apology|author=Graeme Warden|work=The Guardian  |location=London|date=17 July 2007|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/jul/17/harrypotter.supermarkets|accessdate=1 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rationale behind Asda's initial press release remains uncertain.  Neill Denny, commentator for thebookseller.com, opined that "the whole episode has the whiff of a badly-conceived PR stunt by ill-briefed senior executives at Asda out of touch with the subtleties of the book world."&lt;ref name=Denny&gt;{{cite web|title=Opinion: Asda's climbdown|author=Neill Denny|publisher=thebookseller.com|date=17 July 2007|url=http://www.thebookseller.com/news/42197-opinion-asdas-climbdown.html|accessdate=1 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Baxter of Publishing News concurred: "For Asda&amp;nbsp;... it may be seen as mission accomplished, a high-risk strategy to maximise publicity for its ''Harry Potter'' offer rewarded with television, radio, Internet and newspaper coverage. And the association of Asda with low prices has no doubt been entrenched in a few more minds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Great Stand-Off|author=Ralph Baxter|work=Publishing News Online|url=http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&amp;TAG=&amp;CID=&amp;PGE=&amp;sg9t=... |year=2007|accessdate=1 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113192945/http://www.publishingnews.co.uk/pn/pno-news-display.asp?K=e2007071912471094&amp;TAG=&amp;CID=&amp;PGE=&amp;sg9t=... |archivedate = 13 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Legal status of ''Salvia divinorum''}} {{Psychedelic sidebar}}
'''''[[Salvia divinorum]]''''', a [[psychoactive]] plant, is legal in most countries. Exceptions, countries where there is some form of control, include [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Armenia]] and the [[Legal status of Salvia divinorum in the United States|United States]].&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus"&gt;[[#refSiebertLegalStatus|Siebert (Legal status)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ErowidLegalStatus"&gt;[[#refErowidLegalStatus|Erowid (Legal status)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, following a local newspaper story in October 2005,&lt;ref name="Worksop20051014"&gt;[[#refWorksop20051014|Worksop 2005-10-14 (UK Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; a parliamentary [[Early Day Motion]] was raised calling for ''Salvia divinorum'' to be banned there. However, it only received 11 signatures.&lt;ref name="Mann2005"&gt;[[#refMann2005|Mann 2005]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second Early Day Motion was raised in October 2008 attracting 18 signatures.&lt;ref name="Early day motion 2235"&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/edm/2007-08/2235 Early day motion 2235].

In such places where ''Salvia divinorum'' legislation exists, it varies in prohibitive degree from country to country. Australia has imposed its strictest 'Schedule 9' (US Schedule I equivalent or equivalent to class A in the UK) classification, for example, and Italy has also placed Salvia in its 'Table I' of controlled substances (also US Schedule I and class A equivalent). In Spain there are just controls focusing on the commercial trade of ''Salvia divinorum'', and private cultivation (growing one's own plants for non-commercial use) is not targeted.

In the United States, Salvia is not regulated under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] but some states, including Delaware, Illinois, Louisiana, Missouri, Virginia, Tennessee, Texas, and others, have passed their own laws.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDEA2007|DEA 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; Several other states have proposed legislation against Salvia, including Alabama, Alaska, California, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oregon, and Pennsylvania.  Many of these proposals have not made it into law, with motions having failed, stalled or otherwise died, for example at committee review stages.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ErowidLegalStatus" /&gt;

National legislation for amendment of the Controlled Substances Act to place salvinorin A and ''Salvia divinorum'' in Schedule I at the federal level was proposed in 2002 by [[Rep. Joe Baca|Representative Joe Baca]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]- California). Those opposed to bill HR 5607 include [[Daniel Siebert (ethnobotanist)|Daniel Siebert]], who sent a letter to Congress arguing against the proposed legislation,&lt;ref name="Siebert2002"&gt;[[#refSiebert2002|Siebert 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Center for Cognitive Liberty &amp; Ethics (CCLE), who sent key members of the US Congress a report on ''Salvia divinorum'' and its active principle,&lt;ref name="Boire2002"&gt;[[#refBoire2002|Boire 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt; along with letters from an array of scientists who expressed concern that scheduling ''Salvia divinorum'' would negatively impact important research on the plant. The bill did not pass.&lt;ref name="Baca2002"&gt;[[#refBaca2002|Baca 2002]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDEA2003|DEA 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CCLE2002"&gt;[[#refCCLE2002b|CCLE 2002b]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvia cultivation may prove difficult to police. The plant has a nondescript appearance; unlike cannabis the leaves are not distinctive and it does not have a distinctive odour. ''Salvia divinorum'' looks like and can be grown as an ordinary [[houseplant]] without the need of special equipment such as [[hydroponic]]s or high-power lights.&lt;ref name="Shulgin2003"&gt;[[#refShulgin2003|Shulgin 2003]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chalmers20060506 "&gt;[[#refChalmers20060506|Chalmers 2006-05-06 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinions and arguments==
Concerns expressed by some politicians on the subject of Salvia echo those of the media. In November 2006, the morning after a story by news channel KSL was aired in Utah, warning its viewers about what it called "this dangerous herb",&lt;ref name="Dujanovic20061127"&gt;[[#refDujanovic20061127|Dujanovic 2006-11-27 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt; Utah State Representative [[Paul Ray]] (R) submitted a bill calling for its Schedule I classification in that state. KSL TV cameras were on Capitol Hill to see the paperwork filed, with KSL reporting - "Moments after our story ended, Utah Representative Paul Ray began writing a bill to ban Salvia." As he presented the bill Ray said - "It was upsetting to see we have a drug of that strength that's legal." and "We're basically going to make it illegal to possess or sell. Period."&lt;ref name="Dujanovic20061128"&gt;[[#refDujanovic20061128|Dujanovic 2006-11-28 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's action was further supported by the news channel in a subsequent KSL editorial. Viewer feedback was unanimously more critical.&lt;ref name="Cardall20061128"&gt;[[#refCardall20061212|Cardall 2006-12-12 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia State Senator John Bulloch (R) reportedly saw a report on an Atlanta television news station about the increased use of ''Salvia divinorum''. He was quoted as saying - "I thought, 'Why hasn't somebody already jumped on this?" before filing Senate Bill 295. "I hurriedly got legislative counsel to draft the bill.... Everything that I read about it is it's considered to be a hallucinogenic drug.... A lot of the reading that I've found on it says that it gives a quicker and more intense high than LSD." Senator Don Thomas (R) was reported as saying -"I just know about the publicity of the dangers of it, and the use of it, so my first impression is to ban anything of that nature."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEckenrode20070308|Eckenrode 2007-03-08 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, the day after a Fox TV local news story on Salvia had aired in Milwaukee,&lt;ref name="Sanchick20070214"&gt;[[#refSanchick20070214|Sanchick 2007-02-14 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt; Wisconsin state lawmaker [[Sheldon Wasserman]] (D), also a licensed physician, who had never heard of it before, spoke to Fox news in a follow-up report about then wanting to make it a Schedule I controlled substance.&lt;ref name="Sanchick20070215"&gt;[[#refSanchick20070215|Sanchick 2007-02-15 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparisons to LSD and particular focus on "protecting our children" are also echoed by politicians. In June 2007 the Wisconsin State Journal newspaper ran a front-page headline cover story about Salvia, reporting that Representative Wasserman had recently begun seeking sponsors for a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of ''Salvia divinorum'' for consumption in Wisconsin. Dr. Wasserman was reported as saying - "This bill is all about protecting our children" and "I want to stop the Salvia divinorum dealers who are pushing young people to experiment with a potentially dangerous substance."&lt;ref name="Martell20070618"&gt;[[#refMartell20070618|Martell 2007-06-18 (US Media).]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with his proposals to make ''Salvia divinorum'' and salvinorin A Schedule I controlled substances in Oregon, Representative [[John Lim]] (R) was quoted as saying - "From what I understand this drug is at least as dangerous as marijuana or LSD", and Seth Hatmaker, a spokesman for Lim - "I think it's only a matter of time before we find people addicted to this stuff".&lt;ref name="Clark20070305"&gt;[[#refClark20070305|Clark 2007-03-05 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of Illinois, in support of his bill for Schedule I classification of ''Salvia divinorum'', Representative [[Dennis Reboletti]] (R) wrote in his own website that Salvia is a "powerful psychoactive plant which in appearance looks like marijuana but has the psychoactive properties of LSD." and "It's important that we in the legislature are proactive in protecting our children from highly addictive substances" [...] "For a drug to be classified as a Schedule 1 substance signifies that it's a highly dangerous and potentially lethal drug for its user. Hopefully, the passage of my bill will bring attention to "Magic Mint" and help law enforcement combat the future rise of this drug."&lt;ref name="Reboletti2007Mar"&gt;[[#refReboletti2007Mar|Reboletti 2007 (Mar)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other references and sources indicate however that ''Salvia divinorum'' does not look like marijuana. Its psychoactive properties are not like those of LSD, and that Salvia divinorum is not generally understood to be either addictive or toxic.

Concerns about driving while under the influence of Salvia have also been expressed. Delaware State Senator Karen Peterson (D), who introduced Schedule I classification of ''Salvia divinorum'' in Delaware, said - "I, for one, don't want to be driving down Route 1 next to someone who is having an out-of-body experience"&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNBC1020060411|NBC10 2006-04-11 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and "I thought this is not something that I would want people using driving around the streets of Delaware."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith20070925|Smith 2007-09-25 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

There has not been any evidence to suggest that Salvia use is problematic. Some "arguments" against Salvia have been of a preventative or imitative nature. North Dakota State Senator Randy Christmann (R) stated - "we need to stop this before it gets to be a huge problem not after it gets to be a huge problem"&lt;ref name="KXMBTV20070131"&gt;[[#refKXMBTV20070131|KXMBTV 2007-01-31 (US Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey Assemblyman [[Jack Conners]] (D) argued -"Salvia divinorum use may not be a runway epidemic, but it's certainly is a phenomenon that warrants attention. We should take preventive steps now to prevent wholesale problems later on"&lt;ref name="Teel2006"&gt;[[#refTeel2006|Teel 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005 MP [[John Mann (British politician)|John Mann]] raised an ultimately unsuccessful [[Early Day Motion]] calling for ''Salvia divinorum'' to be banned in the UK, saying - "The Australians have clearly found a problem with it. There's obviously a risk in people taking it."&lt;ref name="Worksop20051014" /&gt;

The National Institute on Money in State Politics indicates the major sources of campaign contributions for US politicians. For example, Oregon State Representative John Lim's largest individual campaign sponsor in 2006 was the Oregon Beer &amp; Wine Distributors Association. Lim argued for Schedule I classification of Salvia in Oregon. Senator Karen Peterson's second largest group campaign donations in 2006 came from 'Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor' industries. Peterson introduced Schedule I classification of ''Salvia divinorum'' in Delaware. Tennessee State Senator [[Tim Burchett]] (R) sponsored Salvia legislation in Tennessee. In 2006 his second largest individual campaign donation came from the Tennessee Malt Beverage Association. In the same period alcohol and tobacco related contributions amounted to the fourth largest industry contributions for Representative Paul Ray in Utah. Alcohol related contributions also featured highly for Representative Dennis Reboletti in Illinois - 'Beer, Wine &amp; Liquor' was his seventh highest industry contributor.&lt;ref name="MiSP2006"&gt;[[#refMiSP2006|MiSP 2006]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of more prohibitive measures against Salvia argue that such reactions are largely due to an inherent prejudice and a particular cultural bias rather than any actual balance of evidence, pointing out inconsistencies in attitudes toward other more toxic and addictive drugs such as [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNutt2007|Nutt et al. 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt; The worldwide number of alcohol-related deaths is calculated at over 2,000 people per day,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLopez2005|Lopez 2005]], Table 2.&lt;/ref&gt; in the US the number is over 300 deaths per day.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNIAAA2001|NIAAA 2001]].&lt;/ref&gt; While not objecting to some form of legal control, in particular with regard to the sale to minors or sale of enhanced high-strength extracts, most Salvia proponents otherwise argue against stricter legislation.&lt;ref name="SiebertLegalStatus" /&gt;

Those advocating consideration of ''Salvia divinorum'''s potential for beneficial use in a modern context have two major arguments: First that Salvia Divinorum is a potent kappa opioid agonist and given its activity and modulatory effect on the [[kappa opioid receptor]], and therefore similarity of its profile of effect to [[ibogaine]], (used successfully to treat addiction around the world) that further research into its potential as a potent anti-addiction medication&lt;ref name="pmid15542743"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hasebe K, Kawai K, Suzuki T, Kawamura K, Tanaka T, Narita M, Nagase H, Suzuki T | title = Possible pharmacotherapy of the opioid kappa receptor agonist for drug dependence | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1025 | issue = | pages = 404–13 |date=October 2004 | pmid = 15542743 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1316.050 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; will be hindered by careless lawmaking. Secondly, advocates argue that more could be learned from Mazatec culture, where Salvia is not really associated with notions of drug taking at all and it is rather considered as a spiritual sacrament. In light of this it is argued that ''Salvia divinorum'' could be better understood more positively as an [[entheogen]] rather than pejoratively as a [[hallucinogen]].&lt;ref name="BlosserLessons"&gt;[[#refBlosserLessons|Blosser (Mazatec Lessons)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other entheogenic plants with continuing traditions principally of spiritual use include [[peyote]] (and other psychoactive cacti), [[iboga]], [[virola]], [[ayahuasca]] (an admixture of plants containing [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] + [[MAOI]]), and various types of psychoactive fungi.&lt;ref name="OtherEntheogenicPlants"&gt;see [[peyote]], [[iboga]], [[virola]], [[ayahuasca]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, US legislation as it stands specifically allows two of these to be used in a spiritual context. The [[Native American Church]] is allowed to use peyote and [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV) is permitted ayahuasca.&lt;ref name="USLegislation"&gt;see [[Native American Church]] and [[União do Vegetal]].&lt;/ref&gt; Although not consistently granted (varying from state to state), the principal grounds for such concessions are constitutional,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMadison1789|Madison 1789]].&lt;/ref&gt; with further grounds following from the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]].

| {{Flagu|New Zealand}} || {{partial|Need license}} || {{partial|Need license}} || {{partial|Need license}} || {{partial|Need license}} || In November 2007 New Zealand National party MP [[Jacqui Dean]] called for the government to take action, saying - "Salvia Divinorum is a hallucinogenic drug, which has been banned in Australia, and yet here in New Zealand it continues to be sold freely." and "We’re dealing with a dangerous drug here, with the minister's wait and see approach like playing Russian Roulette with young people's lives."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refNZNP20071105|New Zealand National Party 2007-11-05 (NZ Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Jacqui Dean has similar concerns about the 'party pill' [[benzylpiperazine]] (BZP), over which Associate Health Minister [[Jim Anderton]] ([[New Zealand Progressive Party|Progressive party]]) has accused her of indulging in political grandstanding, saying - "Perhaps Mrs Dean doesn't subscribe to the idea that any Government must balance the need to act promptly with its responsibilities to act fairly and follow due process, particularly where its actions affect those who are currently acting within existing legal constraints."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAnderton2007|Anderton 2007]].&lt;/ref&gt;
When questioned by [[Māori Party]] MP [[Tariana Turia]], on why she was unwilling to take the same prohibitory line on smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol as she took on BZP Ms Dean said "Alcohol and tobacco have been with our society for many, many years."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStuff20071010|Stuff 2007-10-10 (NZ Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;
In September 2007, the Social Tonics Association of New Zealand (STANZ) called for Jacqui Dean to step down from speaking on drug issues after she demonstrated "a lack of credibility in calling for the [[Dihydrogen monoxide hoax|ban of dihydrogen monoxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O - i.e. water.)" STANZ Chairman Matt Bowden said - "The DHMO hoax played on the member this week is not a joke, it highlights a serious issue at the heart of drug policy making. Ms Dean demonstrated a ‘ban anything moderately harmful’ reflex. This approach is just downright dangerous." - "Jacqui Dean has clearly demonstrated a lack of credibility in her requests to the Minister to consider banning water; She has also seriously embarrassed her National Party colleagues who can no longer have confidence in her petitions to ban BZP or anything else."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSTA20070915|Social Tonics Association 2007-09-15 (NZ Media)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- USAGE COMMENTS --&gt;

&lt;!-- BASIC: {{reflist}} uses information included inside article's &lt;ref&gt; tags to generate its list. Only summary info is needed for the list to work as a simple reference to the full-form references below. In other words, include the full form in the References section below, and in the article's main text use &lt;ref&gt; with only author surname(s), year of publication and (optionally) page location, for example, simply &lt;ref&gt;Marushia 2002, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;
&lt;!-- BETTER: Wikilinks can be created from citations to full references with the inclusion of appropriate identifying tags.
The value of the id parameters used in &lt;cite&gt; tags wrapped around the full references below act like anchoring bookmarks, thus allowing the inline citations within the main article's &lt;ref&gt; tags to use a wikilink (using #, like a link to a same-page section heading would).
--&gt;
&lt;!-- Remember, if you want to have the same citation cross-referring back to more than one place in the article (e.g. ^ a b c Author Year) then give first &lt;ref&gt; tag a name and refer subsequently to that with the 'trailing slash' &lt;ref&gt; form
e.g. Article text.&lt;ref name="Marushia2002p3"&gt;[[#refMarushia2002|Marushia 2002]], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; More article text.&lt;ref name="Marushia2002p3" /&gt; More article text...

The '''Lieber Code''' of April 24, 1863, also known as '''Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field''', [[General order|General Order]] № 100,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |author-link=|year=1863 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Instructions for the Government of the Armies of the United States in the Field, Prepared by Francis Lieber, LL.D. and Revised by a Board of Officers |volume= |edition= 1|publisher=D.Van Nostrand  |publication-date=1863 |publication-place=New York |pages= |url=https://archive.org/details/governarmies00unitrich|accessdate=23 August 2015 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Lieber Code can also be found in US War Department, ''The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies,'' (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1899), Series III, Volume 3, pp 148-164.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lieber Instructions''', was an instruction signed by US President [[Abraham Lincoln]] to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] Forces of the United States during the [[American Civil War]] that dictated how [[soldier]]s should conduct themselves in [[war]]time. Its name reflects its author, the German-American legal scholar and political philosopher [[Francis Lieber|Franz Lieber]].

==Historical background==
Lieber had fought for [[Prussia]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and had been wounded at the [[Battle of Waterloo]]. He had lived and taught for two decades in [[South Carolina]], where he was exposed to the horrors of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]]. Beginning in October 1861, as professor of history and political science at what became [[Columbia University]], Lieber delivered a series of lectures at the new [[Columbia Law School|Law School]] entitled "The Laws and Usages of War". He believed the methods used in war needed to align with the goals and that the ends must justify the means.

During the American Civil War, soldiers were faced with a number of ethical dilemmas. Lieber knew about some from his own European wartime experiences, as well as through his sons (two of whom fought for the Union, and another died fighting for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] [[Battle of Eltham's Landing|near Williamsburg]]). While in St. Louis searching for one of his sons, who had been wounded at [[Fort Donelson]], Lieber met Union General [[Henry Halleck]], who had been a lawyer in civilian life and had published "International Law, or, Rules Regulating the Intercourse of States in Peace and War" in early 1861.&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;Beard, Rick. [http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/ The Lieber Codes] ''New York Times'', April 24, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; As the war dragged on, the treatment of [[Espionage|spies]], [[guerrilla war]]riors, and civilian sympathizers became especially troublesome. So too was the treatment of escaped slaves, who were forbidden to return to their owners by an order of March 13, 1862. After Halleck became general-in-chief in July, 1862, he solicited Lieber's views. The professor responded with a report, "Guerilla Parties Considered With Reference to the Laws and Usages of War", and Halleck ordered 5000 copies printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/guerrillaparties00lieb#page/n5/mode/2up|title=Guerrilla parties : considered with reference to the laws and usages of war|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same summer, Lieber advised Secretary of War [[Edwin Stanton]] concerning the "military use of colored persons".

By year's end, Halleck and Stanton invited Lieber to Washington to revise the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|1806 Articles of War]]. Other members of the revision committee included Major Generals [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (general)|Ethan Allen Hitchcock]], [[George Cadwalader]], and [[George L. Hartsuff]], and Brigadier General [[John Henry Martindale]], but essentially Lieber was left to draft instructions for Union soldiers facing these situations. Halleck edited them to ensure nothing conflicted with Lincoln's [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. Then Lincoln issued them in April, 1863.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

==Main provisions==
The main sections concerned [[martial law]], military [[jurisdiction]], and the treatment of spies, [[deserter]]s, and [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]].

===Ethical treatment===
The document insisted upon the humane, ethical treatment of populations in occupied areas. It was the first codified law that expressly forbade giving "[[no quarter]]" to the enemy (i.e. killing prisoners of war), except in such cases when the survival of the unit that held these prisoners was threatened. It forbade the use of poisons, stating that use of such puts any force who uses them entirely outside the pale of the civilized nations and peoples; it forbade the use of [[torture]] to extract confessions; it described the rights and duties of prisoners of war and of capturing forces. It described the state of war, the state of [[military occupation|occupied territories]], and the ends of war, and discusses permissible and impermissible means to attain those ends; it discussed the nature of [[nation-state|states]] and [[sovereignty|sovereignties]], and insurrections, [[rebellion]]s, and wars. As such, it is widely considered to be the first written recital of the [[customary international law|customary]] [[law of war]], in force between the civilized nations and peoples since [[time immemorial]], and the precursor to the [[Hague Convention of 1907|Hague Regulations of 1907]], the treaty-based restatement of the customary law of war.

===Slavery and black prisoners of war===
The Lieber Code was {{cn span|date=November 2017|text=probably commissioned by the Lincoln Administration to deal with the crisis touched off by the [[Emancipation Proclamation]],}} which the Confederacy insisted was in violation of the customary rules of warfare. Moreover, Confederate officials such as [[Jefferson Davis]] had announced that the Confederacy would treat black Union soldiers as criminals, not as soldiers, subject to execution or re-enslavement upon capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/the-lieber-codes/|title=The Lieber Codes|date=April 24, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opil.ouplaw.com/view/10.1093/law:epil/9780199231690/law-9780199231690-e2126|title=Lieber Code|publisher=Oxford Public International Law|accessdate=November 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lieber Code defended the lawfulness of Emancipation under the laws of war and insisted that those same laws prohibited discrimination on the basis of color among combatants.&lt;ref name="documents.law.yale.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://documents.law.yale.edu/lincolns-code|title=Lincoln's Code - Document Collection Center|website=documents.law.yale.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent author says that the Code's association with Emancipation and the problem of black Union soldiers was so close that it ought to be called not Lieber's Code but Lincoln's Code since it was part and parcel of the most important decision of Lincoln's presidency.&lt;ref name="documents.law.yale.edu"/&gt;

===Sterner measures===
Both the Lieber Code and the Hague Convention of 1907, which took much of the Lieber Code and wrote it into the international treaty law, included practices that would be considered illegal or extremely questionable by today's standards. In the event of the violation of the laws of war by an enemy, the Code permitted [[reprisal]] (by [[musketry]]) against the enemy's recently captured POWs; it permitted the [[summary execution]] (by musketry) of spies, [[Sabotage|saboteurs]], [[francs-tireurs]], and guerrilla forces, if caught in the act of carrying out their missions. (These allowable practices were later abolished by the [[Third Geneva Convention|Third]] and [[Fourth Geneva Convention]]s of 1949, following [[World War II]], which saw these practices in the hands of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian]] states used as the rule rather than the exception to such.)

Such terms reflected Lieber's deep interest in the ideas of Prussian military strategist [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. They also arose out of one of the Code's central aims, which was not merely to limit the war, but to legitimate its expansion in the move to Emancipation and a more aggressive war effort.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://documents.law.yale.edu/lincolns-code Witt, Lincoln's Code, ch. 6-8.]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the code envisioned a reciprocal relationship between the population and the Army. As long as the population did not resist military authority, it was to be treated well. Should the inhabitants violate this compact by taking up arms and supporting guerrilla movements, then they were open to sterner measures. Among these were the imposition of fines, the confiscation and/or destruction of property, the imprisonment and/or expulsion of civilians who aided guerrillas, the relocation of populations, the taking of hostages, and the possible execution of guerrillas who failed to abide by the laws of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author= Birtle, Andrew J. | title=The U.S. Army's Pacification of Marinduque, Philippine Islands, April 1900 – April 1901 | journal= The Journal of Military History | year= April 1997| volume=61 | issue= 2| pages=255–282 | jstor= 2953967 | publisher= Society for Military History }}&lt;/ref&gt; It authorized the shooting on sight of all persons not in uniform acting as soldiers and those committing, or seeking to commit, sabotage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nebrida |first=Victor |author2=ed. Hector Santos |date=1997-06-15 |url=http://www.bibingka.com/phg/balangiga/ |title=The Balangiga Massacre: Getting Even |work=Philippine Centennial Series |accessdate=2006-03-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060302153846/http://www.bibingka.com/phg/balangiga/ |archivedate=2006-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the Code follows:

{{quote|14. Military necessity, as understood by modern civilized nations, consists in the necessity of those measures which are indispensable for securing the ends of the war, and which are lawful according to the modern law and usages of war.

15. Military necessity admits of all direct destruction of life or limb of armed enemies, and of other persons whose destruction is incidentally unavoidable in the armed contests of the war; it allows of the capturing of every armed enemy, and every enemy of importance to the hostile government, or of peculiar danger to the captor; it allows of all destruction of property, and obstruction of the ways and channels of traffic, travel, or communication, and of all withholding of sustenance or means of life from the enemy; of the appropriation of whatever an enemy's country affords necessary for the subsistence and safety of the Army, and of such deception as does not involve the breaking of good faith either positively pledged, regarding agreements entered into during the war, or supposed by the modern law of war to exist. (... But ...) Men who take up arms against one another in public war do not cease on this account to be moral beings, responsible to one another and to God.

16. Military necessity does not admit of cruelty—that is, the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge, nor of maiming or wounding except in fight, nor of torture to extort confessions. It does not admit of the use of poison in any way, nor of the wanton devastation of a district. It admits of deception, but disclaims acts of perfidy; and, in general, military necessity does not include any act of hostility which makes the return to peace unnecessarily difficult.}}

===In the Civil War===
Historians have often dismissed the role of the Code in the war effort. While it is true that commanders such as [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] rarely, if ever, consulted the Code in making combat decisions, the Code played a significant role nonetheless in the war's last two years. It provided a blueprint for hundreds of [[war crimes trial]]s (i.e., charging people for [[War crime|violations of the laws and customs of war]]). Also, its provisions on black soldiers bolstered the Union's unpopular decision to cease prisoner exchanges so long as the South refused to exchange black prisoners on equal terms with white ones.&lt;ref name="documents.law.yale.edu"/&gt;

===In international law===
Participants in the international Hague Peace Conferences used Lieber's text as the basis for negotiations which resulted in the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]]. These two international agreements set forth laws of land and naval warfare. Subsequently, during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], many of these laws were broken. Following World War II, jurists at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] and the [[Tokyo Trials]] ruled that by 1939 the rules for armed conflicts, particularly those concerning [[belligerent]] and [[Neutral country|neutral]] [[nationality|nationals]], had been recognized by all civilized nations and thus could apply to officials even of countries that never signed the Hague Conventions. Some features of the Lieber Code are still evident in the [[Geneva Conventions of 1949]].&lt;ref name="documents.law.yale.edu"/&gt;

===Philippine–American War===
An abridged version of the Lieber Code was published in 1899 in ''The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies''.&lt;ref&gt;United States. War Department. ''The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies''. Series 2. Vol. 5. Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1899, pp. 671-682.&lt;/ref&gt; Lieber's son, [[Guido Norman Lieber]], was [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Army|Judge Advocate General]] of the Army from 1895 until 1901, during the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[Philippine–American War]]. The Lieber Code therefore was used extensively during this period when considering and litigating actions by American forces against the native population and Philippine revolutionaries (e.g., [[J. Franklin Bell#War crimes|J. Franklin Bell]] and [[Littleton Waller#Philippine–American War and war crimes acquittal|Littleton Waller]]).

=== US ''Law of War Manual''===
In 2015, the [[United States Department of Defense]] published its ''Law of War Manual''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Office of General Counsel, Department of Defense |first= |author-link=|year=2015 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Department of Defense Law War Manual |volume= |edition= |publisher=  |publication-date=2015 |publication-place=Washington, DC|pages=iii |url=http://www.dod.mil/dodgc/images/law_war_manual15.pdf|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Savage |first=Charlie |author-link=|year=2016 |title= Pentagon Revamps Law of War Manual to Protect Journalists |work=The New York Times  |publication-date=July 22, 2016 |publication-place=|pages= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/23/us/politics/pentagon-revamps-law-of-war-manual-to-protect-journalists.html?hpw&amp;rref=politics&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=well-region&amp;region=bottom-well&amp;WT.nav=bottom-well&amp;_r=0|accessdate=July 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was updated and revised in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Office of General Counsel, Department of Defense |first= |author-link=|year=2015 |editor-last= |editor-first= |contribution= |title=Department of Defense Law War Manual |volume= |edition= |publisher=  |publication-date=2016 |publication-place=Washington, DC|pages= |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/2997317-DoD-Law-of-War-Manual-June-2015-Updated-May-2016.html#document/p1/a309613|accessdate=23 July 2016|via=DocumentCloud}} or via [http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/DoD_Law_of_War_Manual-June_2015_Updated_May_2016.pdf US Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Manual'' explicitly refers to the Lieber Code, and the Lieber Code's influence on the ''Law of War Manual'' is apparent throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/throwback-thursday-lieber-code|title=Throwback Thursday: The Lieber Code|date=23 July 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the founding of [[Communist Party of Finland|Communist Party]] in 1918 it has seen a steady number of splits and breakaway factions. Some of the breakaway organisations have thrived as independent parties, some have become defunct, while others have merged with the parent party or other political parties.

'''Luxembourgish nationality law''' is ruled by the [[Constitution of Luxembourg]]. The [[Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] is a member state of the [[European Union]] and, therefore, its citizens are also [[Citizenship of the European Union|EU citizens]].

==Nationality by Birth==
Luxembourgish law generally follows ''jus sanguinis'' with limited ''jus soli'' provisions. Citizenship is automatically given to:&lt;ref&gt;https://guichet.public.lu/en/citoyens/citoyennete/nationalite-luxembourgeoise/possession-automatique/effet-loi.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* a child of a Luxembourgish citizen parent, regardless of the place of birth;
* a child born in Luxembourg to a parent born in Luxembourg; or
* a child born in Luxembourg to parents who are stateless or unable to pass their nationality onto their child; or
* a child born in Luxembourg to unknown parents.

==Naturalization==
Naturalization is permitted under several conditions:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guichet.public.lu/entreprises/en/ressources-humaines/recrutement/nationalite/naturalisation/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* being at least eighteen years old
* five years of legal residence in the Grand Duchy, including an uninterrupted period of one year immediately before applying for citizenship
* passing an exam testing knowledge of the [[Luxembourgish language]] 
* taking a course on "living together in the Grand Duchy" and passing the associated examination

Obtaining nationality by option is permitted to, among others:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guichet.public.lu/entreprises/en/ressources-humaines/recrutement/nationalite/option/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* those married to a Luxembourgish citizen for at least three years, provided the language and "living together in the Grand Duchy" examinations are passed;
* those born in Luxembourg to non-Luxembourgish parents, upon reaching the age of 12, provided the parents legally resided in Luxembourg for the twelve months prior to their birth;
* those who have continuously lived in Luxembourg for twenty years if a language course is taken; and
* those who have had seven years of schooling in the Grand Duchy.

It is also possible to "recover" Luxembourg nationality if one can prove he had an ancestor who was Luxembourgish as of 1 January 1900. The Luxembourg diaspora at the time moved to France, Belgium and the US. As of the end of 2013, thousands of people recovered the nationality of their Luxembourgish ancestor.

==Dual citizenship==
Since 1 January 2009, Luxembourg has allowed dual citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.luxembourg-usa.org/consular6.shtml|title=Dual Citizenship|publisher=Embassy of Luxemburg|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=2009-02-12|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to "." for the cite to end in a ".", as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, many Belgians have made use of the new law to adopt Belgian-Luxembourgish citizenship, especially Belgians living in [[Arelerland]], a part of the Belgian province of [[Luxembourg (Belgium)|Luxembourg]] at the border with the Grand Duchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Dutch|url=http://www.deredactie.be/permalink/1.946200|title=Veel Belgen willen ook Luxemburger worden|date=2011-01-21|accessdate=2011-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Luxembourg forms part of the [[European Union]], Luxembourgish citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Luxembourg (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/luxembourg/index_en.htm | title=Luxembourg | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Luxembourgish embassy, Luxembourgish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state). [[Antigua and Barbuda]] (UK), [[Barbados]] (UK), [[Belize]] (UK), [[Central African Republic]] (France), [[Comoros]] (France), [[Gambia]] (UK), [[Guyana]] (UK), [[Liberia]] (Germany), [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] (UK), [[San Marino]] (Italy), [[São Tomé and Príncipe]] (Portugal), [[Solomon Islands]] (UK), [[Timor-Leste]] (Portugal), [[Vanuatu]] (France)&lt;/ref&gt; Luxembourgish citizens can live and work in any country within the EU as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in [[Treaties of the European Union|Article 21 of the EU Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF |format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union  (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel freedom of Luxembourgish citizens==

{{Main|Visa requirements for Luxembourgish citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Luxembourgish citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Luxembourgish citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Luxembourgish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Luxembourg]]. In 2015, Luxembourgish citizens had visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 171 countries and territories, ranking the Luxembourgish passport 3rd in the world according to the [[Visa (document)#Visa Restrictions Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

In 2017, The Luxembourgish nationality is ranked sixteenth in [[The Quality of Nationality Index|Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9092">'''Matrimonial regimes''', or '''marital property systems''', are systems of [[property]] [[ownership]] between [[spouse]]s providing for the creation or absence of a marital [[estate (land)|estate]], and if created, what properties are included in that estate, how and by whom it is managed, and how it will be divided and [[inheritance|inherited]] at the end of the [[marriage]]. Matrimonial regimes are applied either by operation of law or by way of [[prenuptial agreement]] in [[Civil law (legal system)|civil-law]] countries, and depend on the ''[[lex domicilii]]'' of the spouses at the time of or immediately following the [[wedding]]. (See e.g. [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec Civil Code]] and [[Civil Code of France|French Civil Code]], arts. 431-492.). In most [[Common law]] jurisdictions, the default and only matrimonial regime is separation of property, though some U.S. states, known as [[community property]] states, are an exception. Also, in England, the birthplace of [[Common law]], pre-nuptial agreements were until recently completely unrecognized, and although the principle of separation of property prevailed, Courts are enabled to make a series of orders upon divorce regulating the distribution of assets.

Civil-law and bijuridical jurisdictions, including [[Quebec]], [[Louisiana]], [[France]], [[South Africa]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], and many others, have [[statute|statutory]] default matrimonial regimes, in addition to or, in some cases, in lieu of regimes that can only be contracted by [[prenuptial agreement]]s. Generally, couples marry into some form of [[community property|community]] of property by default, or instead contract out under [[separate property|separation]] of property or some other regime through a prenuptial agreement passed before a [[civil law notary|Civil-law notary]] or other [[public officer]] solemnizing the marriage.  Five countries, including the [[Netherlands]], have signed on to the Hague Convention on the Law applicable to Matrimonial Property Regimes, which entered into force on 1 September 1992, which allows spouses to choose not only the regimes offered by their country, but also any regime in force in the country where at least one is a citizen or resident or where marital real estate is situated.

==Coverture==
[[Coverture]] (sometimes spelled ''couverture'') was a legal doctrine whereby, upon marriage, a woman's legal rights were subsumed by those of her husband. Coverture was enshrined in the [[common law]] of [[England]] and the [[United States]] throughout most of the 19th century. The idea was described in [[William Blackstone]]'s ''[[Commentaries on the Laws of England]]'' in the late 18th century.

Under traditional English common law an adult unmarried woman was considered to have the legal status of ''feme sole'', while a married woman had the status of ''feme covert''.  These are English spellings of medieval [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] phrases (the modern standard French spellings would be ''femme seule'' "single woman" and ''femme couverte'', literally "covered woman").

A feme sole had the right to own property and make contracts in her own name.  A feme covert was not recognized as having legal rights and obligations distinct from those of her husband in most respects. Instead, through marriage a woman's existence was incorporated into that of her husband, so that she had very few recognized individual rights of her own. A married woman could not own property, sign legal documents or enter into a contract, obtain an education against her husband's wishes, or keep a salary for herself. If a wife was permitted to work, under the laws of coverture she was required to relinquish her wages to her husband. 

This situation persisted until the mid-to-late 19th century, when [[Married Women's Property Act 1870|married women's property acts]] started to be passed in many English-speaking legal jurisdictions, setting the stage for further reforms.

==Separate property systems==
Separate property systems are based on the premise that marriage is solely an interpersonal union

* Separate Property: All property, pre-marital or marital, is owned separately. (French ''[[:fr:séparation de biens|séparation de biens]]'', Spanish ''separación de bienes'', Dutch ''scheiding van goederen'', ''koude uitsluiting'', German ''[[:de:Gütertrennung|Gütertrennung]]'', Italian ''[[:it:separazione dei beni|separazione dei beni]]'')

* Separate Property with Equitable Distribution:  Under this system, when substantially more property acquired during a marriage is owned by one spouse (e.g. title to all marital property is held in the husband's name only), the courts will make an equitable distribution of the richer spouse's property at death or dissolution of the marriage.  The object is to prevent widow(er)s and divorce(e)s, and their minor children, being cast into poverty by the death or divorce of the richer spouse.

* Accrual System ([[South Africa]]) or Deferred Community Property ([[Canada]]):  Marital property is separately owned during the marriage, but after marriage (divorce, death of a spouse), the net assets are lumped together as property in joint tenancy and divided. (French ''[[:fr:participation aux acquêts|participation aux acquêts]]'', Spanish ''participación'', Dutch ''deelgenootschap'', [[Afrikaans_language|Afrikaans]] ''aanwasbedeling'', German (standard) ''[[:de:Zugewinngemeinschaft|Zugewinngemeinschaft]]'', (Swiss) ''Errungenschaftsbeteiligung'', Italian ''partecipazione agli acquisti'', Portuguese (Brazil) ''participação final nos aquestos'').

* [[Concurrent estate#Tenancy by the entirety|Tenancy by the Entirety]] ([[United States]]):  "TBE" is a separate property system in which spouses are treated as one person, each having an equal ownership interest in the subject property.  In some U.S. states, tenancy by the entirety is limited to realty (e.g. the couple take title to the family home as tenants by the entirety) while other states make it available for both realty and personality (e.g. the couple can also take title to the family automobile as tenants by the entirety).

==Community property systems==
Community property is premised on the theory that marriage creates an economic community between the spouses (who may be same- or opposite-sex); and that the marital property attaches to that interpersonal community, rather than to the spouses themselves.  There are several genres of community property system.

* Community of Acquests and Gains:  Each spouse owns an undivided half-interest in all property acquired during the marriage, except for property acquired by gift or inheritance during the marriage, which is separate property; or which traces to separate property acquired before the marriage, which remains separate property; or which is acquired during a period when the couple are permanently living separately and apart (e.g. legal separation, actual or ''de facto''), which is also separate property.  This genre of community property is also called "ganancial community property." (Fr ''[[:fr:communauté réduite aux acquêts|communauté réduite aux acquêts]]'', Sp ''[[:es:sociedad de gananciales|sociedad de gananciales]]'', Du ''gemeenschap van aanwinst van goederen'', ''gemeenschap van vruchten en inkomsten'', Ger ''[[:de:Errungenschaftsgemeinschaft|Errungenschaftsgemeinschaft]]'', It ''[[:it:Comunione dei beni|comunione degli acquisti]]'')

* Community of Profit and Loss:  similar to above but liabilities ("losses") are separate property. (Du ''gemeenschap van winst en verlies'', Afrik ''gemeenskap van wins en verlies'')

* Community of Personal and Marital Property:  Community property consists of all property, personalty and realty, acquired during the marriage; and all personalty acquired before the marriage. Realty acquired before marriage is separate property.  (Fr ''[[:fr:communauté de meubles et acquêts|communauté de meubles et acquêts]]'', Du ''gemeenschap van inboedel'', Ger ''[[:de:Fahrnisgemeinschaft|Fahrnisgemeinschaft]]'').

* Limited Community Property:  Similar to community of acquests and gains but certain marital property is separate property. (Fr ''communauté de biens limitée'', Du ''beperkte gemeenschap van goederen'', Swiss Ger ''Ausschlussgemeinschaft'')

* Universal or Absolute Community Property: All pre-marital and marital property is community property. However, if there are children from a prior marriage, the property associated with that marital community may be segregated from the community property of a subsequent marriage, to ensure the children of the prior spouse have an inheritance.  (Fr ''[[:fr:communauté universelle|communauté universelle]]'', Sp ''comunidad absoluta de bienes'', Du ''algehele gemeenschap van goederen'', Ger ''[[:de:Gütergemeinschaft_(Ehe)|allgemeine Gütergemeinschaft]]'', It ''comunione universale dei beni'')

'''''MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.''''', 549 U.S. 118 (2007)&lt;ref name=opinion&gt;{{ussc|name=MedImmune, Inc. v. Genentech, Inc.|volume=549|page=118|pin=|year=2007}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] involving [[United States patent law|patent law]].  It arose from a lawsuit filed by [[MedImmune]] which challenged one of the [[Cabilly patents]] issued to [[Genentech]]. One of the central issues was whether a licensee retained the right to challenge a licensed [[patent]], or whether this right was forfeited upon signing of the license agreement. The case related indirectly to past debate over whether the US should change to a [[first to file]] patent system - in 2011, President Obama signed the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act]], which shifted the United States to a first-inventor-to-file patent system.

==Background==

The origin of the dispute was a lengthy [[interference proceeding]] between Genentech and [[Celltech]] which led to the issuance of a new patent in 2001, 18 years after the original filing. This effectively granted Genentech a patent term of 29 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carter|first=Eugenia G.|title=IP Licensing and the Supreme Court’s Medimmune v. Genentech Decision|url=http://www.wipla.org/files/events/3-22-07_Presentation_Notes2.pdf|publisher=Wisconsin Intellectual Property Law Association|accessdate=March 22, 2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  MedImmune was a licensee of the later Cabilly patent, but argued that the term had been improperly extended and that it need not continue to pay royalties past the original expiry date in March 2006. The case was decided in favor of MedImmune, and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) declared the patent invalid. Genentech appealed the USPTO the ruling and the patent remained valid and enforceable until the appeal was concluded. Genentech prevailed during the reexamination of Cabilly II(2) by the USPTO (1).  GlaxoSmithKline and Human Genome Sciences both are challenging the patent under antitrust law (1). This is based on the settlement between Genentech and Celltech and their dispute over the original Cabilly patent 4,816,567 and the Celltech's patent 4,816,397.  Both of which issued on March 28, 1989 (2),(3).  Cabilly II is patent 6331415(4) which issued December 18, 2001.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court held&lt;ref name=opinion/&gt; that:

:1 licensee adequately raised and preserved its contract claim;

:2 licensee was not required to terminate or breach license agreement prior to seeking declaratory judgment of patent invalidity, abrogating ''[[Gen–Probe Inc. v. Vysis, Inc.]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Gen–Probe Inc. v. Vysis, Inc. |vol=359 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1376 |pinpoint= |court=Fed. Cir. |date=2004 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/359/1376/577540/ |accessdate=2018-02-23 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and

:3 [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] would not address whether action was subject to dismissal on discretionary grounds.

Reversed and [[remanded]].

[[Clarence Thomas|Justice Thomas]] filed a dissenting opinion.

The '''Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer''' (a protocol to the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer]]) is an international [[treaty]] designed to protect the [[ozone layer]] by phasing out the production of numerous substances that are responsible for [[ozone depletion]]. It was agreed on 26 August 1987, and entered into force on 26 August 1989, followed by a first meeting in [[Helsinki]], May 1989. Since then, it has undergone eight revisions, in 1990 ([[London]]), 1991 ([[Nairobi]]), 1992 ([[Copenhagen]]), 1993 ([[Bangkok]]), 1995 ([[Vienna]]), 1997 ([[Montreal]]), 1998 ([[Australia]]), 1999 ([[Beijing]]) and 2016 ([[Kigali]], adopted, but not in force).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37665529 Climate change: 'Monumental' deal to cut HFCs, fastest growing greenhouse gases]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/new_site/en/Treaties/treaties_decisions-hb.php?sec_id=343 |title=Adjustments to the Montreal Protocol |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme Ozone Secretariat |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the international agreement, the ozone hole in Antarctica is slowly recovering.&lt;ref&gt;Ewenfeldt B, "Ozonlagret mår bättre", ''[[Arbetarbladet]] 12-9-2014, p. 10.''&lt;/ref&gt; Climate projections indicate that the ozone layer will return to 1980 levels between 2050 and 2070.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ozone Layer on Track to Recovery: Success Story Should Encourage Action on Climate|url=http://www.unep.org/newscentre/Default.aspx?DocumentID=2796&amp;ArticleID=10978&amp;l=en|accessdate=18 September 2014|agency=UNEP|publisher=UNEP|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Susan Solomon|author2=Anne R.

The two ozone treaties have been ratified by 197 parties, which includes 196 states and the European Union,&lt;ref name="ozone.unep.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ozone.unep.org/Ratification_status/ |title=Status of Ratification – The Ozone Secretariat |publisher=Ozone.unep.org |date= |access-date=10 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141008112847/http://ozone.unep.org/Ratification_status/ |archive-date=8 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; making them the [[List of treaties by number of parties|first universally ratified treaties]] in United Nations history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=2666&amp;ArticleID=9010&amp;l=en |title=UNEP press release: "South Sudan Joins Montreal Protocol and Commits to Phasing Out Ozone-Damaging Substances" |publisher=Unep.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These truly universal treaties have also been remarkable in the expedience of the policy-making process at the global scale, where only 14 years lapsed between a basic scientific research discovery (1973) and the international agreement signed (1985 &amp; 1987).

== Terms and purposes ==
The treaty&lt;ref&gt;The full terms are available from http://ozone.unep.org/Publications/MP_Handbook/Section_1.1_The_Montreal_Protocol/.&lt;/ref&gt; is structured around several groups of [[halogenated hydrocarbon]]s that deplete stratospheric ozone. All of the ozone depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol contain either [[chlorine]] or [[bromine]] (substances containing only [[fluorine]] do not harm the ozone layer). Some ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) are not yet controlled by the Montreal Protocol, including nitrous oxide (N2O) For a table of ozone-depleting substances controlled by the Montreal Protocol see:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/ods.html |title=Class I Ozone-depleting Substances &amp;#124; Science &amp;#124; Ozone Layer Protection &amp;#124; US EPA |publisher=Epa.gov |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For each group of ODSs, the treaty provides a timetable on which the production of those substances must be shot out and eventually eliminated. This included a 10-year phase-in for developing countries&lt;ref&gt;An Interview with Lee Thomas, EPA’s 6th Administrator. [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=28 Video], [https://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/60740780F5ACB3D5.pdf#page=1 Transcript] (see p15). April 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; identified in Article 5 of the treaty.

=== Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) Phase-out Management Plan ===

The stated purpose of the treaty is that the signatory states

"Recognizing that worldwide emissions of certain substances can significantly deplete and otherwise modify the ozone layer in a manner that is likely to result in adverse effects on human health and the environment.  Determined to protect the ozone layer by taking precautionary measures to control equitably total global emissions of substances that deplete it with the ultimate objective of their elimination on the basis of developments in scientific knowledge"

"Acknowledging that special provision is required to meet the needs of developing countries"

shall accept a series of stepped limits on [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFC]] use and production, including:

: from 1991 to 1992 its levels of consumption and production of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A do not exceed 150 percent of its calculated levels of production and consumption of those substances in 1986;

: from 1994 its calculated level of consumption and production of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed, annually, twenty-five percent of its calculated level of consumption and production in 1986.

: from 1996 its calculated level of consumption and production of the controlled substances in Group I of Annex A does not exceed zero.

There was a faster phase-out of halon-1211, -2402, -1301, There was a slower phase-out (to zero by 2010) of other substances (halon 1211, 1301, 2402; CFCs 13, 111, 112, etc.){{Contradict inline|date=January 2017}} and some chemicals were given individual attention ([[Carbon tetrachloride]]; [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|1,1,1-trichloroethane]]). The phasing-out of the less damaging [[HCFC]]s only began in 1996 and will go on until a complete phasing-out is achieved by 2030.

There were a few exceptions for "essential uses", where no acceptable substitutes were initially found (for example, in the past metered dose inhalers commonly used to treat asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were exempt) or [[Halomethane|Halon]] fire suppression systems used in submarines and aircraft (but not in general industry).

The substances in Group I of Annex A are:

* CFCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Trichlorofluoromethane|CFC-11]])
* CF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[Dichlorodifluoromethane|CFC-12]])
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[CFC-113]])
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;([[CFC-114]])
* C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl ([[CFC-115]])

The provisions of the Protocol include the requirement that the Parties to the Protocol base their future decisions on the current scientific, environmental, technical, and economic information that is assessed through panels drawn from the worldwide expert communities. To provide that input to the decision-making process, advances in understanding on these topics were assessed in 1989, 1991, 1994, 1998 and 2002 in a series of reports entitled [[Scientific assessment of ozone depletion]], by the Scientific Assessment Panel (SAP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/scientific-assessment-panel|title=Scientific Assessment Panel          {{!}} OZONE SECRETARIAT|website=ozone.unep.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1990 a Technology and Economic Assessment Panel was also established as the technology and economics advisory body to the Montreal Protocol Parties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/en/assessment-panels/technology-and-economic-assessment-panel|title=Technology and Economic Assessment Panel  {{!}} OZONE SECRETARIAT|website=ozone.unep.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Technology and Economic Assessment Panel (TEAP) provides, at the request of Parties, technical information related to the alternative technologies that have been investigated and employed to make it possible to virtually eliminate use of Ozone Depleting Substances (such as CFCs and Halons), that harm the ozone layer. The TEAP is also tasked by the Parties every year to assess and evaluate various technical issues including evaluating nominations for essential use exemptions for CFCs and halons, and nominations for critical use exemptions for methyl bromide. TEAP’s annual reports are a basis for the Parties’ informed decision-making.

Numerous reports have been published by various inter-governmental, governmental and non-governmental organizations to catalogue and assess alternatives to the ozone depleting substances, since the substances have been used in various technical sectors, like in refrigeration, air conditioning, flexible and rigid foam, fire protection, aerospace, electronics, agriculture, and laboratory measurements&lt;ref&gt;Use of ozone depleting substances in laboratories.

=== Hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP) ===

Under the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer, especially Executive Committee (ExCom) 53/37 and ExCom 54/39, Parties to this Protocol agreed to set year 2013 as the time to freeze the consumption and production of HCFCs for developing countries. For developed counties, reduction of HCFC consumption and production began in 2004 and 2010, respectively, with 100% reduction set for 2020.  Developing countries agreed to start reducing its consumption and production of HCFCs by 2015, with 100% reduction set for 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ozone.unep.org/montreal-protocol-substances-deplete-ozone-layer/32506|title=The Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Environment Programme|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 Nov 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The HCFCs are transitional CFCs replacements, used as refrigerants, solvents, blowing agents for plastic foam manufacture, and fire extinguishers. In terms of [[ozone depletion potential]] (ODP), in comparison to CFCs that have ODP 0.6 – 1.0, these HCFCs have lower ODPs (0.01 – 0.5). In terms of [[global warming potential]] (GWP), in comparison to CFCs that have GWP 4,680 – 10,720, HCFCs have lower GWPs (76 – 2,270).

=== Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) ===
{{Update|section|date=October 2016}} 
Hydrochlorofluorocarbons, commonly known as HCFCs, are a group of man-made compounds containing hydrogen, chlorine, fluorine and carbon. They are not found anywhere in nature. HCFC production began to take off after countries agreed to phase out the use of CFCs in the 1980s, which were found to be destroying the ozone layer. Like CFCs, HCFCs are used for refrigeration, aerosol propellants, foam manufacture and air conditioning. Unlike the CFCs however, most HCFCs are broken down in the lowest part of the atmosphere, and pose a much smaller risk to the ozone layer. Unfortunately HCFCs are also very potent greenhouse gases, despite their very low atmospheric concentrations, measured in parts per trillion (million million).

Produced mostly in developed countries, [[Organofluorine chemistry#Hydrofluorocarbons|hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs) replaced CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs pose no harm to the ozone layer because, unlike CFCs and HCFCs, they do not contain chlorine. They are however greenhouse gases, with a high global warming potential (GWP), [[List of refrigerants|comparable to that of CFCs and HCFCs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downtoearth.org.in/content/climate-irrationality |title=Climate of irrationality |publisher=Down To Earth |date=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in 2009, a study calculated that a fast phasedown of high-GWP HFCs could potentially prevent the equivalent of up to 8.8 Gt CO2-eq ''per year'' in emissions by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Velders GJ, Fahey DW, Daniel JS, McFarland M, Andersen SO | title = The large contribution of projected HFC emissions to future climate forcing | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 106 | issue = 27 | pages = 10949–54 | date = July 2009 | pmid = 19549868 | pmc = 2700150 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0902817106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A proposed phasedown of HFCs was hence projected to avoid up to 0.5C of warming by 2100 under the high-HFC growth scenario, and up to 0.35C under the low-HFC growth scenario.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260830030_The_role_of_HFCs_in_mitigating_21st_century_climate_change|title=The role of HFCs in mitigating 21st century climate change|last=Xu|first=Yangyang|last2=Zaelke|first2=Durwood|last3=Velders|first3=Guus J. M.|last4=Ramanathan|first4=V|date=2013-06-01|volume=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognizing the opportunity presented for fast and effective phasing down of HFCs through the Montreal Protocol, starting in 2009 the [[Federated States of Micronesia]] proposed an amendment to phase down high-GWP HFCs,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Meeting_Documents/oewg/29oewg/OEWG-29-8E.pdf|title=Proposed amendment to the Montreal Protocol|last=|first=|date=May 4, 2009|website=United Nations Environment Programme|access-date=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the U.S., Canada, and Mexico following with a similar proposal in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/Meeting_Documents/mop/22mop/MOP-22-5E.pdf|title=Proposed amendment to the Montreal Protocol|last=|first=|website=United Nations Environment Programme|date=July 30, 2010|access-date=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After seven years of negotiations, in October 2016 at the 28th Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol in [[Kigali]], the Parties to the Montreal Protocol adopted the Kigali Amendment whereby the Parties agreed to phasedown HFCs under the Montreal Protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conf.montreal-protocol.org/meeting/mop/mop-28/final-report/English/MOP-28-12E.pdf|title=Report of the Twenty-Eighth Meeting of the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer|last=|first=|date=October 2016|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment to the legally-binding Montreal Protocol will ensure that industrialised countries bring down their HFC production and consumption by at least 85 per cent compared to their annual average values in the period 2011-2013. A group of developing countries including China, Brazil and South Africa are mandated to reduce their HFC use by 85 per cent of their average value in 2020-22 by the year 2045. India and some other developing countries — Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, and some oil economies like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait — will cut down their HFCs by 85 per cent of their values in 2024-26 by the year 2047.

On 17 November 2017, ahead of the 29th Meeting of the Parties of the Montreal Protocol, Sweden became the 20th Party to ratify the Kigali Amendment, pushing the Amendment over its ratification threshold ensuring that the Amendment will enter into force 1 January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/montreal-protocol-celebrates-another-milestone-agreement-reduce|title=Montreal Protocol celebrates another milestone as agreement to reduce climate-warming gases is set to enter into force in 2019|work=UN Environment|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1973, the chemists [[Frank Sherwood Rowland]] and [[Mario Molina]], who were then at the [[University of California, Irvine]], began studying the impacts of CFCs in the Earth's atmosphere. They discovered that CFC molecules were stable enough to remain in the atmosphere until they got up into the middle of the [[stratosphere]] where they would finally (after an average of 50–100 years for two common CFCs) be broken down by [[ultraviolet radiation]] releasing a [[chlorine]] atom. Rowland and Molina then proposed that these chlorine atoms might be expected to cause the breakdown of large amounts of ozone (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the stratosphere. Their argument was based upon an analogy to contemporary work by [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and Harold Johnston, which had shown that nitric oxide (NO) could catalyze the destruction of ozone. (Several other scientists, including [[Ralph Cicerone]], Richard Stolarski, Michael McElroy, and Steven Wofsy had independently proposed that chlorine could catalyze ozone loss, but none had realized that CFCs were a potentially large source of chlorine.) Crutzen, Molina and Rowland were awarded the 1995 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for their work on this problem.

The environmental consequence of this discovery was that, since stratospheric ozone absorbs most of the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching the surface of the planet, depletion of the ozone layer by CFCs would lead to an increase in UV-B radiation at the surface, resulting in an increase in skin cancer and other impacts such as damage to crops and to marine phytoplankton.

But the Rowland-Molina hypothesis was strongly disputed by representatives of the aerosol and halocarbon industries. The chair of the board of [[DuPont]] was quoted as saying that ozone depletion theory is "a science fiction tale...a load of rubbish...utter nonsense". [[Robert Abplanalp]], the president of [[Precision Valve Corporation]] (and inventor of the first practical aerosol spray can valve), wrote to the Chancellor of UC Irvine to complain about Rowland's public statements (Roan, p.&amp;nbsp;56.)

After publishing their pivotal paper in June 1974, Rowland and Molina testified at a
hearing before the U.S. House of Representatives in December 1974. As a result, significant funding was made available to study various aspects of the problem and to confirm the initial findings. In 1976, the U.S. [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) released a report that confirmed the scientific credibility of the ozone depletion hypothesis.&lt;ref name="NAS1976"&gt;{{cite book | last = National Academy of Sciences | first = | authorlink = United States National Academy of Sciences | coauthors = | title = Halocarbons, effects on stratospheric ozone | publisher = | year = 1976 | location = Washington, DC | pages = | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a2YrAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Halocarbons:+Effects+on+Stratospheric+Ozone | doi =  | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; NAS continued to publish assessments of related science for the next decade.

Then, in 1985, [[British Antarctic Survey]] scientists [[Joe Farman]], [[Brian G. Gardiner (meteorologist)|Brian Gardiner]] and [[Jonathan Shanklin]] published results of abnormally low ozone concentrations above [[Halley Bay]] near the [[South Pole]]. They speculated that this was connected to increased levels of CFCs in the atmosphere. It took several other attempts to establish the Antarctic losses as real and significant, especially after NASA had retrieved matching data from its satellite recordings. The impact of these studies, the metaphor 'ozone hole', and the colourful visual representation in a time lapse animation proved shocking enough for negotiators in Montreal, Canada to take the issue seriously.&lt;ref&gt;Grundmann, Reiner, Transnational Environmental Policy: Reconstructing Ozone, London: Routledge, {{ISBN|0-415-22423-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1985, 20 nations, including most of the major CFC producers, signed the [[Vienna Convention for the Protection of the Ozone Layer|Vienna Convention]], which established a framework for negotiating international regulations on ozone-depleting substances. After the discovery of the ozone hole 
by SAGE 2 it only took 18 months to reach a binding agreement in Montreal, Canada.

But the CFC industry did not give up that easily. As late as 1986, the Alliance for Responsible CFC Policy (an association representing the CFC industry founded by [[DuPont]]) was still arguing that the science was too uncertain to justify any action. In 1987, DuPont testified before the US Congress that "We believe there is no imminent crisis that demands unilateral regulation."&lt;ref name=Doyle1991&gt;{{cite news|last1=Doyle|first1=Jack|title=DuPont's Disgraceful Deeds: The Environmental Record of E.I.

Heckert would write in a letter to the United States Senate, "we will not produce a product unless it can be made, used, handled and disposed of safely and consistent with appropriate safety, health and environmental quality criteria. At the moment, scientific evidence does not point to the need for dramatic CFC emission reductions. There is no available measure of the contribution of CFCs to any observed ozone change..."&lt;ref name=Greenpeace1997&gt;{{cite web|title=Du Pont: A Case Study In the 3D Corporate Strategy|url=http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/moral97/6dupont.html|publisher=Greenpeace|accessdate=8 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406093303/http://archive.greenpeace.org/ozone/greenfreeze/moral97/6dupont.html|archivedate=2012-04-06|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilateral Fund==

The main objective of the ''Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol'' is to assist developing country parties to the Montreal Protocol whose annual per capita consumption and production of ozone depleting substances (ODS) is less than 0.3&amp;nbsp;kg to comply with the control measures of the Protocol. Currently, 147 of the 196 Parties to the Montreal Protocol meet these criteria (they are referred to as Article 5 countries).

It embodies the principle agreed at the [[Earth Summit|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] in 1992 that countries have a common but differentiated responsibility to protect and manage the global commons.

The Fund is managed by an Executive Committee with an equal representation of seven industrialized and seven Article 5 countries, which are elected annually by a Meeting of the Parties. The Committee reports annually to the Meeting of the Parties on its operations. The work of the Multilateral Fund on the ground in developing countries is carried out by four Implementing Agencies, which have contractual agreements with the Executive Committee:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Creating a real change for the environment|year=2007|publisher=Secretariat of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol|url=http://www.multilateralfund.org/InformationandMedia/publications/default.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), through its [[UNEP OzonAction|OzonAction Programme]].
* [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP).
* [[United Nations Industrial Development Organization]] (UNIDO).
* [[World Bank]].

Up to 20 percent of the contributions of contributing parties can also be delivered through their bilateral agencies in the form of eligible projects and activities.

The fund is replenished on a three-year basis by the donors. Pledges amount to US$3.1 billion over the period 1991 to 2005. Funds are used, for example, to finance the conversion of existing manufacturing processes, train personnel, pay royalties and patent rights on new technologies, and establish national ozone offices.

== Parties ==	
As of 23 June 2015, all countries in the United Nations, the [[Cook Islands]], [[Holy See]], [[Niue]] as well as the [[European Union]] have ratified the original Montreal Protocol (see external link below),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XXVII-2-a&amp;chapter=27&amp;lang=en |title=2. a Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer

== Effect ==
[[File:Ozone cfc trends.png|thumb|250px|Ozone-depleting gas trends]]
Since the Montreal Protocol came into effect, the atmospheric concentrations of the most important chlorofluorocarbons and related chlorinated hydrocarbons have either leveled off or decreased.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al.noaa.gov/assessments/2002/Q&amp;As16.pdf]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060614130414/http://www.al.noaa.gov/assessments/2002/Q%26As16.pdf|date=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halon concentrations have continued to increase, as the halons presently stored in fire extinguishers are released, but their rate of increase has slowed and their abundances are expected to begin to decline by about 2020. Also, the concentration of the HCFCs increased drastically at least partly because for many uses (e.g. used as solvents or refrigerating agents) CFCs were substituted with HCFCs. While there have been reports of attempts by individuals to circumvent the ban, e.g. by smuggling CFCs from undeveloped to developed nations, the overall level of compliance has been high. Statistical analysis from 2010 show a clear positive signal from the Montreal Protocol to the stratospheric ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.org/10/12161/2010/acp-10-12161-2010.html|title=Evidence for the effectiveness of the Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer|work=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics | date=22 December 2010 | accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In consequence, the Montreal Protocol has often been called the most successful international environmental agreement to date. In a 2001 report, NASA found the ozone thinning over Antarctica had remained the same thickness for the previous three years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011016ozonelayer.html |title=Top Story – 2001 Antarctic Ozone Hole Similar in Size to Holes of Past Three Years, NOAA and NASA Report – October 16, 2001 |publisher=www.gsfc.nasa.gov |accessdate=2010-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231121817/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20011016ozonelayer.html |archivedate=31 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however in 2003 the ozone hole grew to its second largest size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s2099.htm |title=NOAA News Online (Story 2099) |publisher=www.noaanews.noaa.gov |accessdate=2010-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent (2006) scientific evaluation of the effects of the Montreal Protocol states, "The Montreal Protocol is working: There is clear evidence of a decrease in the atmospheric burden of ozone-depleting substances and some early signs of stratospheric ozone recovery."&lt;ref&gt;Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion: 2006, http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/csd/assessments/2006/report.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent study seems to point to a relative increase in CFCs due to an unknown source. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencealert.com/it-looks-like-someone-is-producing-an-internationally-banned-ozone-destroying-chemical-once-again&lt;/ref&gt;

Reported in 1997, significant production of CFCs occurred in Russia for sale on the black market to the EU throughout the 90s. Related US production and consumption was enabled by fraudulent reporting due to poor enforcement mechanisms. Similar illegal markets for CFCs were detected in Taiwan, Korea, and Hong Kong. &lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.law.uga.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1486&amp;context=gjicl&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Montreal Protocol is also expected to have effects on human health. A 2015 report by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that the protection of the ozone layer under the treaty will prevent over 280 million cases of skin cancer, 1.5 million skin cancer deaths, and 45 million cataracts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Updating Ozone Calculations and Emissions Profiles for Use in the Atmospheric and Health Effects Framework Model http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/effects/AHEF_2015_Update_Report-FINAL_508.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs, and hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, are now thought to contribute to [[anthropogenic global warming]]. On a molecule-for-molecule basis, these compounds are up to 10,000 times more potent greenhouse gases than carbon dioxide. The Montreal Protocol currently calls for a complete phase-out of HCFCs by 2030, but does not place any restriction on HFCs. Since the CFCs themselves are equally powerful greenhouse gases, the mere substitution of HFCs for CFCs does not significantly increase the rate of anthropogenic climate change, but over time a steady increase in their use could increase the danger that human activity will change the climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |title=EIA – Emissions of the Greenhouse Gases in the United States 2005 |publisher=www.eia.doe.gov |accessdate=2010-09-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110421074012/http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/1605/ggrpt/other_gases.html |archivedate=21 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Policy experts have advocated for increased efforts to link ozone protection efforts to climate protection efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Mario Molina, Durwood Zaelke, K. Madhava Sarma, Stephen O.

=== Regional detections of non-compliance ===

In 2018, scientists monitoring the atmosphere following the 2010 phaseout date have reported evidence of continuing industrial production of CFC-11, likely in eastern Asia, with detrimental global effects on the ozone layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/17/611984631/banned-ozone-depleting-chemical-is-still-being-produced-somewhere-scientists-say|title=Banned Ozone-Depleting Chemical Is Still Being Produced Somewhere, Scientists Say|website=NPR|date=May 17, 2018|accessdate=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-018-0106-2|title=An unexpected and persistent increase in global emissions of ozone-depleting CFC-11|author=Stephen A.

== 25th anniversary celebrations ==
The year 2012 marked the 25th anniversary of the signing of the Montreal Protocol. Accordingly, the Montreal Protocol community organized a range of celebrations at the national, regional and international levels to publicize its considerable success to date and to consider the work ahead for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ozone.unep.org/new_site/en/ozone_day_details.php |title=Ozone Secretariat 25th Anniversary web page |publisher=Ozone.unep.org |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Among its accomplishments are: The Montreal Protocol was the first international treaty to address a global environmental regulatory challenge; the first to embrace the "precautionary principle" in its design for science-based policymaking; the first treaty where independent experts on atmospheric science, environmental impacts, chemical technology, and economics, reported directly to Parties, without edit or censorship, functioning under norms of professionalism, peer review, and respect; the first to provide for national differences in responsibility and financial capacity to respond by establishing a multilateral fund for technology transfer; the first MEA with stringent reporting, trade, and binding chemical phase-out obligations for both developed and developing countries; and, the first treaty with a financial mechanism managed democratically by an Executive Board with equal representation by developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Canan, Penelope and Nancy Reichman (2013, forthcoming), "The Montreal Protocol" in J. Britt Holbrook (Chief Editor) Ethics, Science, Technology, and Engineering: An International Resource, 2nd Edition, Thompson Learning.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Within 25 years of signing, parties to the MP celebrate significant milestones. Significantly, the world has phased-out 98% of the Ozone-Depleting Substances (ODS) contained in nearly 100 hazardous chemicals worldwide; every country is in compliance with stringent obligations; and, the MP has achieved the status of the first global regime with universal ratification; even the newest member state, South Sudan, ratified in 2013. UNEP received accolades for achieving global consensus that "demonstrates the world’s commitment to ozone protection, and more broadly, to global environmental protection".&lt;ref&gt;ozone.unep.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Parental Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution''' is a proposed change to the [[United States Constitution]]. The amendment's advocates say that it will allow parents' rights to direct the upbringing of their children, protected from federal interference and the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. The Amendment was first proposed during the 110th Congress as House Joint Resolution 97 in July 2008, but no action was taken during that Congress. The Amendment has been described as a "[[wedge issue]]" and part of the [[culture war]]s.&lt;ref name="CBS"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/04/08/politics/politico/main4930409.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Parental Rights: The New Wedge Issue | date=April 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Amendment==
The current language (as proposed in [https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/36 S.J.Res.36]) is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
SECTION 1&lt;br/&gt;
The liberty of parents to direct the upbringing, education, and care of their children is a fundamental right.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SECTION 2&lt;br/&gt;
The parental right to direct education includes the right to choose, as an alternative to public education, private, religious, or home schools, and the right to make reasonable choices within public schools for one's child.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SECTION 3&lt;br/&gt;
Neither the United States nor any State shall infringe these rights without demonstrating that its governmental interest as applied to the person is of the highest order and not otherwise served.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;SECTION 4&lt;br/&gt;
The parental rights guaranteed by this article shall not be denied or abridged on account of disability.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SECTION 5&lt;br/&gt;
This article shall not be construed to apply to a parental action or decision that would end life.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
SECTION 6&lt;br/&gt;
No treaty may be adopted nor shall any source of international law be employed to supersede, modify, interpret, or apply to the rights guaranteed by this article.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== State Legislatures (2010 to present) ===
In 2010 the legislatures of Louisiana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legis.state.la.us/ |title=Search of SCR 38 from http://www.legi.state.la.us |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and South Dakota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://legis.state.sd.us/sessions/2010/index.aspx |title= Search for HCR1014 from http://legis.state.sd.us/session/2010/index.aspx |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted resolutions calling on the U.S. Congress to propose the Parental Rights Amendment to the States for ratification. In 2011, the legislatures in Idaho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/printedition/news/20110203/states03_st.art.htm |title=USA Today, Feb. 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 26, 2011 | date=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montana,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laws.leg.mt.gov/laws11/LAW0203W$BSRV.ActionQuery?P_BLTP_BILL_TYP_CD=SJ&amp;P_BILL_NO=9&amp;P_BILL_DFT_NO=&amp;P_CHPT_NO=&amp;Z_ACTION=Find&amp;P_SBJ_DESCR=&amp;P_SBJT_SBJ_CD=&amp;P_LST_NM1=&amp;P_ENTY_ID_SEQ= |title=laws.leg.mt.gov |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Florida&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=45417&amp;SessionIndex=-1&amp;SessionId=66&amp;BillText=&amp;BillNumber=557&amp;BillSponsorIndex=0&amp;BillListIndex=0&amp;BillStatuteText=&amp;BillTypeIndex=5&amp;BillReferredIndex=0&amp;HouseChamber=H&amp;BillSearchIndex=-1 |title=http://www.myfloridahouse.gov |accessdate=May 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; passed similar resolutions. In 2012, Wyoming passed a similar resolution.&lt;ref&gt;https://legiscan.com/WY/bill/HJ0003/2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
Support for the amendment is found at organizations such as the [[American Family Association]], [[Concerned Women for America]], [[Focus on the Family]], [[Liberty Counsel]], and the [[Traditional Values Coalition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/drive-for-parental-rights-amendment-picks-up-over-110-co-signers-39990 |title=Drive for Parental Rights Amendment Picks Up Over 110 Co-Signers, Christian News |publisher=Christianpost.com |date=2009-07-29 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the amendment at ParentalRights.org contend that it will preserve the rights of children, arguing that the question is not one of child rights versus parents' rights, but whether parents, or the government can best decide what is in a child's best interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parentalrights.org "ParentalRights.org"]  Accessed September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They contend that Section Three of their proposal will preserve the authority of the State to intercede for children who are abused or neglected, just as it exists today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parentsrights.us "Parentsrights.us"] Accessed October, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rep. Hoekstra has cited [[Antonin Scalia]]'s dissenting opinion in ''[[Troxel v. Granville]]'', where he argued that the Constitution did not confer upon judges the power to recognize parental rights not explicitly enumerated, as a motivation for the Amendment.&lt;ref name="Hoekstra2"&gt;http://hoekstra.house.gov/parentsrights/faq.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Convention on the Rights of the Child===
Proponents of the amendment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parentalrights.org ParentalRights.Org] Allied Organizations [http://www.parentalrights.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={19BD5949-BF5D-4DFE-BD34-4304C1BD923E}].&lt;/ref&gt; often cite concern over possible U.S. ratification of the United Nations' [[United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child|Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. [[Supremacy Clause|Article Six, Section Two]] of the Constitution [[Incorporation of international law|incorporates treaties]] ratified by the Senate into U.S. law, requiring state and federal judges to uphold treaty obligations. Constitutional lawyer [[Michael Farris (lawyer)|Michael Farris]], author and chief proponent of the Amendment,&lt;ref name="CBS"/&gt; expresses concern that ratifying the convention would disrupt state-level family law and shift power from the State to the federal government, leading to interference in the parent-child relationship.&lt;ref name="crary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/29/MNS317BD4O.DTL|title=Kids'-rights pact finds critics in Congress|date=2009-04-30|publisher=Sfgate.com|author=David Crary, Associated Press|accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ParentsRights.us.  [http://parentsrights.us/ FAQs].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdtbjIWyCMkC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22Parental+Rights+Amendment+to+the+United+States+Constitution%22+-wikipedia&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=plJXTsXFOofUiAL_7M2bCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Parental%20Rights%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false |title=Write these laws on your children : inside the world of conservative Christian homeschooling |location=Boston, Massachusetts | publisher= Beacon Press |year=2009

|isbn=978-0-8070-3291-6|first=Robert|last=Kunzman |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Farris and allied organizations also cite the theory of [[customary international law]] as a threat, claiming that elements of the Convention might become binding on the United States even without ratification.&lt;ref&gt;ParentalRights.org. [http://parentalrights.org/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC={4B09B4DE-0FE1-4ACA-92BE-FFAF0D79D380} "The Threat of Customary International Law."]  Accessed October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==

Tom Head of [[About.com]] contends that the proposal contains "numerous 'poison pills' that would prevent it from being supported by mainstream civil libertarians," saying that its language is overbroad and would enable abuse and neglect by parents. He describes the amendment as unserious, meant more as a "rallying point" for "ultra-conservative legislators" than as a genuine amendment to the Constitution.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civilliberty.about.com/od/equalrights/qt/parental_rights.htm |title=Parental Rights Amendment - Does the Parental Rights Amendment Make Sense? |publisher=Civilliberty.about.com |date=2010-06-11 |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sen. [[Tim Johnson (U.S. Senator)|Tim Johnson]] (D-SD) says that the amendment was crafted in response to the U.N.'s Convention on the Rights of the Child, but that the Convention is not a real threat to parental rights; therefore, an amendment is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Sen. Tim Johnson (D-SD) wrote to a constituent on July 22, 2009, "Frankly the (amendment) seems unnecessary, as the Convention does not threaten these rights."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}} [[Mary Landrieu]] (D-LA) points out that the Convention has not been ratified, and asserts that even if it is ratified, it will not infringe upon existing laws.&lt;ref&gt;Sen. [[Mary Landrieu]] wrote to a constituent on March 12, 2009, "The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child does not infringe upon any laws in the United States."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=November 2012}}

===Opposition from homeschooling advocates===

Larry Kaseman of Home Education magazine argues that the Amendment's focus on rights rather than responsibilities will empower parents to treat their children like property and shelter unfit parents from punishment for [[neglect]] and [[abuse]]. Kaseman also holds that parental rights exist separately from federal law, and expresses concern that a constitutional amendment would federalize family law, granting the government the power to give, define, limit, regulate, and take away parental rights. He argues that the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] to the United States Constitution already protects parental rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kaseman, Larry and Susan.  [http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/264/parental-rights.html "Taking Charge."], July, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Deborah Stevenson of National Home Education Legal Defense (NHELD) argues, citing the [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]], that parental rights fall within state jurisdiction and that the issue should be resolved at the state level.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, Deborah.  [http://www.nheld.com/BTN67.htm "The Parental Rights Amendment."], April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6401">'''Pomponia Graecina''' (d. 83 AD) was a noble [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] woman of the 1st century who was related to the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]]. She was the wife of [[Aulus Plautius]], the general who led the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] in 43 AD, and was renowned as one of the few people who dared to publicly mourn the death of a kinswoman killed by the Imperial family. It has been speculated that she was an early [[Christian]]. She is identified by some as Lucina or Lucy, a saint honoured by the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Family background==
Pomponia's background is not certain, but can be reconstructed as follows. Her father was probably [[Gaius Pomponius Graecinus]], who was [[Roman consul|suffect consul]] in 16 AD and a correspondent of [[Ovid]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Smith (lexicographer)|William Smith]], ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', 1870, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2826.html Vol 3 p. 492]
&lt;/ref&gt; Graecinus' wife was Asinia, sister of [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 23)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} and through her Pomponia was related to the Imperial family.

Asinia's father, [[Gaius Asinius Gallus]], was consul in 8 BC, and her mother [[Vipsania Agrippina|Vipsania]], was the daughter of the general and politician [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]].&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'', 1870, [http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2772.html Vol. 3 p. 438] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511233144/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2772.html |date=2006-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By her former husband, the future emperor [[Tiberius]], Vipsania was also the mother of [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus the Younger]]. Vipsania's half-siblings, from her father's marriage to [[Augustus]]' daughter [[Julia the Elder|Julia]], included [[Agrippina the Elder]], mother of the emperor [[Caligula]] and [[Agrippina the Younger]], who was the mother of [[Nero]] and wife of [[Claudius]].

Other notable ancestors on her mother's side include the historian and senator [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 40 BC)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]], who was consul in 40 BC.

==Biography==
Pomponia married [[Aulus Plautius]] (d. by 65 AD), the [[Roman Senate|senator]] and general who led the Roman conquest of Britain in 43 AD, for which he later received a military [[ovation]], and who governed [[Roman Britain]] until 47 AD. A younger Aulus Plautius, probably their son, was murdered by the emperor Nero, supposedly because Nero's mother Agrippina had fallen in love with him and encouraged him to bid for the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], ''Nero'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Nero*.html#35.4 35]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 43 AD Pomponia's relative [[Julia (daughter of Drusus the Younger)|Julia]], daughter of her uncle [[Drusus Julius Caesar]], was executed on the orders of her maternal uncle, the emperor [[Claudius]] at the instigation of the empress [[Valeria Messalina]]. Pomponia spent the next forty years in open mourning in defiance of successive emperors. She escaped punishment for this, possibly as a result of her own illustrious ancestry and her husband's sterling military reputation, which gave her prestige. According to [[Tacitus]], Pomponia lived a long, unhappy life, possibly as a result of her son's murder and the deaths of several relatives associated with the Imperial family. In 57 AD Pomponia was charged with practicing a "foreign superstition", which has been taken by some to mean conversion to [[Christianity]], although there were other regulated cults in ancient Rome. According to ancient Roman tradition, she was tried by her husband before her kinsmen, and acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Tac.+Ann.+13.32 13.32]&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 83 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Schaff, ''History of the Christian Church'', vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crypt of Lucina|Inscriptions in the catacombs of Saint Callistus]] in [[Rome]] suggest that later members of Pomponia’s family were indeed Christians. The archaeologist Battista de Rossi controversially identifies her with Saint Lucina, the purported donor of the part of the catacombs where the inscriptions were found, and suggests that Lucina was Pomponia's baptismal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia|wstitle=Crypt of Lucina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saint Lucina is honored by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] on the 30 June.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4331 St. Lucina - Catholic Online]&lt;/ref&gt; She is said to have visited the martyrs [[Martinian and Processus]], the two former guards at the [[Mamertine Prison]] who had been converted in the prison by their prisoner [[Saint Peter]], and buried their bodies after their execution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stlukeorthodox.com/html/saints/april/11th.cfm St. Luke Orthodox Church - Saints, April 11th]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional depictions==
Pomponia Graecina and her husband Aulus Plautius are informal adoptive parents of Ligia, the heroine of [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s 1895 historical novel ''[[Quo Vadis (novel)|Quo Vadis]]''. The novel presents both Pomponia and her adoptive daughter as secret Christians, something that Plautius either does not know or chooses to ignore. In the 1951 [[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|film adaptation]] she was played by [[Nora Swinburne]].

Pomponia is portrayed in ''[[When the Eagle Hunts]]'', a novel of historical fiction from the [[Eagle Series]] by [[Simon Scarrow]].  In the story, Pomponia and her two children are captured and held hostage by [[Druids]] resisting the [[Roman invasion of Britain]], while a rescue is attempted by the series' two main characters.

[[Giovanni Pascoli]]'s poem ''Pomponia Graecina''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mauriziopistone.it/testi/carmina/20_pomponia_graecina.html Latin text]&lt;/ref&gt; won him the gold medal at the [[:it:Certamen poeticum Hoeufftianum|Certamen Hoeufftianum]] in 1910.

She also makes an appearance in David Wishart's Family Commitments, part of the Marcus Corvinus series

In the [[legal profession]], [[solicitor]]s and [[barrister]]s may need a current practising certificate before they can offer their services.  The authority that administers the practising certificate varies by jurisdiction.

==Practising certificates for lawyers by jurisdiction==

===Australia===
{{expand list|date=November 2014}}
In Australia, the authority that issues the practising certificate depends on whether the lawyer is a barrister or solicitor (or in jurisdictions where these roles are fused, both) and the state or territory in which they are practising.  In Queensland for example, solicitors' practising certificates are issued by the Queensland Law Society, which also functions as a representative body for solicitors.  In the case of barristers, the Queensland Bar Association issues practising certificates.

===Fiji===
The Fiji Law Society issued practising certificates until 2009, when the government of [[Frank Bainimarama]] banned it from doing so.&lt;ref name=fiji&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lawyers' certificates were made to expire seven months early, and each lawyer was required to obtain a new certificate from the Chief Registrar of the High Court.&lt;ref name=fiji /&gt;  The Law Council of Australia issued a statement, expressing concern that this was part of a move for the government to control Fiji's legal profession to prevent opponents of the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état|military coup]] of 5 December 2006 from practising law.&lt;ref name=fiji /&gt;

=== Ireland ===
Solicitors in Ireland are required to have a practicing certificate in order to provide legal advice. Practicing certificates are issued by the Registrar of Solicitors at the [[Law Society of Ireland]] and solicitors must reapply annually to receive a certificate valid for one year. It is a criminal offence to practice without a certificate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lawsociety.ie/Solicitors/Practising/Practice-Notes/practising-certificate-2018-notice/|title=Practising Certificate 2018 Notice|website=www.lawsociety.ie|access-date=2018-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
The [[Solicitors Regulation Authority]] regulates solicitors and issues their certificates.

A '''registered representative''', also called a general securities representative, a [[stockbroker]], or an account executive, is an individual who is licensed to sell [[securities]] and has the legal power of an [[agent (law)|agent]] in the [[United States]].

Registered representatives usually work for [[broker/dealer]]s licensed by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and the [[Self Regulatory Organization]]s (SRO) of the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NYSE) and [[Financial Industry Regulatory Authority]] (FINRA). 

To become a registered representative in the United States, one must be sponsored by a [[broker/dealer]] firm and must pass the FINRA-administered [[General Securities Representative Exam|Series 7]] examination (known as the General Securities Representative Exam) or another Limited Representative Qualifications Exam. Some state laws and broker/dealer policies also require the [[Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam|Series 63]] examination (known as the Uniform Securities Agent State Law Exam).{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abtrainingcenter.com/Series7.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

A registered representative ("RR" or "rep" or "broker") is authorized to sell a large array of securities such as stocks, bonds, options, mutual funds, limited partnership programs and variable annuities.  Registered representatives who sell variable products such as variable annuities or [[variable universal life insurance]] policies typically also must obtain the appropriate state insurance department license(s).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6791">{{Politics of Somaliland}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Somaliland]] on 31 May 2001, an internationally recognized [[States and regions of Somalia|autonomous region]] in [[Somalia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic |publisher=[[University of Pretoria]] |date=1 February 2004 |url=http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/countries/docs/charterfeb04.pdf |accessdate=2 February 2010 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218004011/http://www.chr.up.ac.za/hr_docs/countries/docs/charterfeb04.pdf |archivedate=December 18, 2008 }} "The Somali Republic shall have the following boundaries. (a) North; Gulf of Aden. (b) North West; Djibouti. (c) West; Ethiopia. (d) South south-west; Kenya. (e) East; Indian Ocean."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[referendum]] was held on a draft [[Constitution of Somaliland|constitution]] that affirmed Somaliland's independence from [[Somalia]] as a separate state. Two-thirds of eligible voters took part in the referendum and 97.1% of them voted in favour of the constitution. However the referendum was opposed by the [[Government of Somalia]] and did not lead to any international recognition of Somaliland's separatism.

==Background==
In May 1991 after the fall of the military dictator of Somalia, [[Siad Barre]], the [[Somali National Movement]] declared the independence of Somaliland. In 1993 an [[Executive president|executive presidency]] was set up with a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[legislature]] and [[Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal]] was elected president by a council of elders. In 1997, at a Conference of Somaliland Communities in [[Hargeisa]], a constitution was adopted to last for 3 years until a referendum could take place to bring it into full effect.&lt;ref name=little&gt;{{cite web | url = http://somaliuk.com/Indepth1/country_that_could.pdf | archive-url = http://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090225023746/http://somaliuk.com/Indepth1/country_that_could.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2009-02-25 | title = Somaliland: The Little Country that Could | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | publisher = ''[[Center for Strategic and International Studies]]'' }}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution was amended in 2000 and the referendum was delayed by one year till 2001. Meanwhile, the attempts to form a national government of Somalia and the formation of the [[Transitional National Government]] of Somalia in May 2000 encouraged Somaliland to hold a referendum to try to show Somaliland's desire for independence.&lt;ref name=democracy&gt;{{cite book |title= Further Steps to Democracy |year= 2006 |publisher= CIIR |isbn= 1-85287-318-3 |page= 173 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=mYvILshSS1oC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Referendum==
The referendum in effect became a vote on the independence of Somaliland due to the inclusion in the constitution of a clause on Somaliland's independence.&lt;ref name=independence&gt;{{cite book |title= After Independence |last= Barrington |first= Lowell W. |year= 2006 |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-06898-9 |pages= 127–128 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Jp-5UtoBtFEC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=subregional&gt;{{cite book |title= Exploring Subregional Conflict |last= Sriram |first= Chandra Lekha |last2= Nielsen |first2= Zoe |year= 2004 |publisher= Lynne Rienner Publishers |isbn= 1-58826-219-7 |page= 42 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=amtY97DZ0xAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[census]] or voter lists so community elders decided who was eligible to vote in the referendum.&lt;ref name=somaliland&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/africa/1361394.stm | title = Somaliland votes on independence | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | date = 2001-05-31 | publisher = ''[[BBC Online]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Transitional Federal Government]] of Somalia opposed the referendum, describing it as illegal and said that the [[government of Somaliland]] had no authority to unilaterally separate from Somalia.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{cite book |title= Through Fire with Water |last= Doxtader |first= Erik |last2= Villa-Vicencio |first2= Charles |year= 2003 |publisher= New Africa Books |isbn= 0-86486-613-5 |page= 173 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ynrmj6yU9owC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum was also opposed by the leadership of the neighbouring region of [[Puntland]] as provocative. No [[international organisation]] or country supported the referendum.&lt;ref name=statute&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.hinduonnet.com/2001/05/31/stories/0331000f.htm | title = Referendum on statute in breakaway Somaliland | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | date = 2001-05-30 | publisher = ''[[The Hindu]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A team of ten [[Election monitoring|observers]] from the [[Initiative and Referendum Institute]] observed the referendum. They were only able to visit 57 of the 600 [[Polling place|polling station]]s and avoided the [[Sool, Somalia|Sool]] region entirely due to security concerns. However, in those stations recorded they reported that the referendum was open, fair, peaceful and any fraud was rare and insignificant.&lt;ref name=little/&gt; Nothing is known about the quality of the rest.

==Aftermath==
The President of Somaliland, Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal, described the referendum as having made Somaliland into a nation and put an end to any question of reuniting with Somalia.&lt;ref name=back&gt;{{cite web| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/world/africa/1367554.stm | title = Somaliland: No way back | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | date = 2001-06-04 | publisher = ''[[BBC Online]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the support for independence demonstrated in the referendum, no nation has recognised the independence of Somaliland since then,&lt;ref name=independence/&gt; due to fears over ever increasing numbers of unsustainable small states and the [[African Union]]'s opposition to the splitting of existing states.&lt;ref name=somaliland/&gt;&lt;ref name=forgotten&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/3627175/Worldstage.html | title = A forgotten democracy in the Horn of Africa | accessdate = 2009-02-17 | date = 2006-08-16 | publisher = ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''State Farm Arena''' (formerly '''Philips Arena''') is a multi-purpose [[list of indoor arenas|indoor arena]] located in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]. The arena serves as the home venue for the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA)'s [[Atlanta Hawks]]. It also served as home to the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Atlanta Thrashers]] from 1999 to 2011, before the team moved to [[Winnipeg]], and the [[Women's National Basketball Association]] (WNBA)'s [[Atlanta Dream]] from 2008 to 2016. It opened in 1999 at a cost of $213.5 million, replacing the [[Omni Coliseum]]. It is owned by the Atlanta Fulton County Recreation Authority and operated by the Hawks, owned by [[Tony Ressler]] along with a group of investors including Grant Hill.

==Layout==
[[File:Philips Arena-Atlanta.jpg|thumb|right|Then-Philips Arena on February 12, 2012.]]

The arena seats 19,050 for [[basketball]] and 17,624 for [[ice hockey]]. The largest crowd ever for an Atlanta Hawks basketball game at the arena was Game 6 of the 2008 Eastern Conference Quarterfinals on May 2, 2008 (against the [[Boston Celtics]]), where there was an announced attendance of 20,425.&lt;ref name="HawksMediaGuide"/&gt; The arena includes 92 luxury suites, 9 party suites, and 1,866 club seats. For concerts and other entertainment events, the arena can seat 21,000.&lt;ref name="facts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philipsarena.com/arena-info/media-guide|title=Philips Arena Media Guide|website=Philipsdarena.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arena was originally laid out in a rather unusual manner, with the club seats and luxury boxes aligned solely along one side of the playing surface, and the general admission seating along the other three sides (the arrangement was later emulated in [[Ford Field]], [[UCF Arena]], [[Soldier Field]], [[Levi's Stadium]], and other venues). This layout was a vast contrast to many of its contemporaries, which have their revenue-generating luxury boxes and club seats located in the 'belly' of the arena, thus causing the upper deck to be 2–4 stories higher. The layout at Philips was done so as to be able to bring the bulk of the seats closer to the playing surface while still making available a sufficient number of revenue-raising club seats and loges&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt;; however, the 2017–18 renovations had removed the upper levels of the suite wall in favor of premium seating spread throughout the arena. 

On the exterior, angled steel columns supporting the roof facing downtown spell out "ATLANTA." The side facing the [[Georgia World Congress Center]] originally spelled out "[[CNN]]" (whose [[CNN Center|headquarters]] adjoins the arena), but that section has since been altered to accommodate a Taco Mac restaurant. The [[Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center (MARTA station)|Dome/GWCC/Philips Arena/CNN Center]] rail station below the arena provides access to [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] public transportation.

[[Amsterdam]]-based technology company [[Philips]] purchased the initial naming rights to the arena in February 1999 for $185 million over 20 years. In February 2018, it was reported that Philips would not renew its naming rights agreement for the arena when it expires in June 2019, primarily due to Philips' withdrawal from the consumer electronics market in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Muret|first1=Don|title=Sources: Philips Won't Renew Naming Rights|url=http://www.venuesnow.com/news/detail/philips-wont-renew-naming-rights|website=Venues Today|accessdate=15 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 2018, [[State Farm]] purchased the naming rights to the arena, in a deal that will last for 20 years and cost $175 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=State Farm and Atlanta Hawks Basketball Club Announce Generational Collaboration To Transform City of Atlanta|url=https://www.nba.com/hawks/state-farm-and-atlanta-hawks-basketball-club-announce-generational-collaboration-transform-city?cid=hawks_18arenatransformation_w_h_hp_mnb_-_0829_statefarmarena|publisher=NBA Media Ventures, LLC|website=Hawks.com|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Neighborhood|url=http://www.statefarmarena.com/welcome|website=StateFarmArena.com|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vivlamore|first=Chris|title=Hawks reach arena naming rights agreement with State Farm|url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/basketball/breaking-hawks-reach-arena-naming-rights-agreement-with-state-farm/ugmOWmhYSF8C0k1igJLmON/|newspaper=Atlanta Journal-Constitution|date=August 30, 2018|accessdate=August 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 2007–2008 season, State Farm Arena utilized the new "see-through" shot clock units which allow spectators seated behind the basket to see the action without having the clocks interfere with their view, joining [[FedExForum]], [[Wells Fargo Center (Philadelphia)|Wells Fargo Center]], [[TD Garden]], [[United Center]], [[Talking Stick Resort Arena]] and the [[Spectrum Center (arena)|Spectrum Center]]. Video advertising panels replaced the traditional scrolling panels.

==History==
During the late 1980s and early 1990s, many cities started building new state-of-the-art sporting venues for their [[NBA]] and/or [[National Hockey League|NHL]] franchises, or in hopes of attaining one. Many of these arenas had modern amenities for their high-end customers, such as luxury boxes, club seats, and large, posh club-level concourses; some even had practice facilities on-site. These attractions were rarely found in arenas constructed in the early 1970s, when the [[Omni Coliseum]] was built.  However, it is likely that the Omni would have had to be replaced in any event.  It had been built using Cor-Ten [[weathering steel]] that was intended to seal itself, ensuring it would last for decades.  However, the Omni's designers didn't account for Atlanta's humid climate.  The Cor-Ten steel never stopped rusting, causing the arena to deteriorate faster than anticipated.

[[Ted Turner]], owner of the Hawks at the time, wanted to bring [[National Hockey League|NHL]] hockey back to Atlanta; the city's first NHL team, the [[Atlanta Flames]], had moved to Calgary in [[1980–81 NHL season|1980]]. However, the NHL determined that the Omni was not suitable even as a temporary facility due to its lack of amenities and structural problems.  The league told Turner that it would only grant an expansion team on condition that a new arena be in place for the prospective team's inaugural season. After much consideration of possible other sites both in Downtown Atlanta and in the suburbs, it was decided that the Omni would be demolished in 1997, and a new arena would be built in the same location; the Omni was demolished on July 26, 1997. The Hawks split their games between the [[Georgia Dome]] and [[McCamish Pavilion|Alexander Memorial Coliseum]] for the next two seasons while Philips Arena was under construction.

Philips Arena held its first event with a September 1999 concert by the musician [[Elton John|Sir Elton John]]. The Omni's "center-hung scoreboard" now hangs in the lobby of Philips Arena, where it still displays the Omni's logo along with those of Philips Arena, the Hawks, and the Thrashers (who never played in The Omni). The scoreboard still functions and displays information relevant to the game taking place in the arena.  On April 2, 2009, Philips Arena achieved [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] for Existing Building: Operations and Maintenance certification as specified by the United States Green Building Council (USGBC).  It was the world's first LEED certified NBA/NHL arena.&lt;ref name="facts"/&gt; It has been nicknamed the "Highlight Factory", due to the number of exciting plays, or highlights, that occur and Philips' history with lights and electronics.

==Events==
[[File:Philips Arena basketball.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Then-Philips Arena prior to a Hawks game vs the Phoenix Suns]]
The arena hosted the [[NBA All-Star Game]] in 2003 and the Atlantic Coast Conference Men's Basketball Tournament in 2012.

The first playoff game in any professional league played in Philips Arena was in 2005, when the Georgia Force of the [[Arena Football League]] hosted, and won, its first home playoff game. The first NHL playoff game in Philips Arena was in [[2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs|2007]], the Thrashers' only appearance in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The first NBA playoff game in Philips Arena was in 2008, when the Hawks made the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]] after an eight-season drought of missing the playoffs. On April 10, 2011, the Thrashers lost to the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], 5–2, in their final game. [[Tim Stapleton]] scored the final goal for the Thrashers in team history.

The venue had been named the site of the 2005 [[Southeastern Conference]] Women's Basketball Tournament; however, when the NHL announced in early 2004 that the 55th [[NHL All-Star Game]], scheduled for February 2005 would be held in Atlanta, arena officials withdrew the Southeastern Conference Women's Basketball Tournament – which was then moved 140 miles to the northeast along [[Interstate 85]] to the [[Bon Secours Wellness Arena|BI-LO Center]] in [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. Oddly, the arena would not even be the host of that planned All-Star Game due to the [[2004–05 NHL lockout]]. As a result, Atlanta became the second (San Jose being the first) city to lose a planned All-Star Game because of a labor dispute. Philips Arena would later be announced as home to the [[56th National Hockey League All-Star Game|56th NHL All-Star Game]] in 2008. Also, Philips Arena hosted game three of the 2010 WNBA Finals, where the [[Seattle Storm]] defeated the [[Atlanta Dream]].

In 2013, Philips Arena hosted the finals of the men's [[NCAA]] [[NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Championship|Division II]] and [[NCAA Men's Division III Basketball Championship|Division III]] college basketball championships. The events were held as an undercard to the [[2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2013 NCAA Final Four]] held at the [[Georgia Dome]], in celebration of the 75th edition of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]].

===MMA &amp; Wrestling===
The arena hosted [[UFC 88]]&lt;ref name=ufc88&gt;{{cite web|title=Liddell-Evans Headlines UFC 88 in Atlanta on September 6|publisher=UFC.com|url=http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail.fightCard&amp;eid=1461|access-date=2008-06-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619202745/http://www.ufc.com/index.cfm?fa=EventDetail.FightCard&amp;eid=1461|archive-date=2008-06-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[UFC 145]], and [[UFC 201]]&lt;ref name="UFC201"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Robbie-Lawler-vs-Tyron-Woodley-Targeted-for-UFC-201-Headliner-in-Atlanta-104485|title=Robbie Lawler vs. Tyron Woodley targeted for UFC 201 headliner in Atlanta|publisher=sherdog.com|author=Tristen Critchfield|date=2016-05-04|accessdate=2016-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008, 2012, and 2016 respectively. Philips Arena also hosted the 2011 [[WWE Hall of Fame]] induction ceremony, the night before [[WrestleMania XXVII]] which was held at the [[Georgia Dome]]. Philips Arena also hosted [[Royal Rumble (2002)]], [[Backlash (2007)]], [[Royal Rumble (2010)]], [[Hell in a Cell (2012)]], and [[Survivor Series (2015)]].

===Concerts===
State Farm Arena is among the busiest arenas for concerts in the world, having sold well over 550,000 concert tickets in 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article3134279.ece|location=London|newspaper=The Times|title=From Unwanted Empty Shell to the World's Busiest Venue|first=Will|last=Pavia|date=January 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked as the third-busiest arena in the U.S. in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Philips Arena Ranked Third Busiest in the Nation|first=Melissa|last=Ruggieri|url=http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-music-scene/2012/02/14/philips-arena-ranked-third-busiest-in-the-nation/?cxntlid=thbz_hm|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|date=February 14, 2012|accessdate=February 14, 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707201028/http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-music-scene/2012/02/14/philips-arena-ranked-third-busiest-in-the-nation/?cxntlid=thbz_hm|archive-date=July 7, 2012|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other events===
The arena hosted the 2004 [[US Figure Skating Championships]].

Every year in January, the State Farm Arena hosts one of the largest Christian college aged conferences: [[Passion Conferences|Passion Conference]]. The conference typically takes place over the first weekend in the new year and features big names in the Christian world such as Louie Gigilio, [[Chris Tomlin]], Matt Redman, Kristian Stanfill, John Piper, rap artist Lecrae and many more. The conference is typically sold out.

==Renovations==
Shortly after acquiring the Hawks and the operating rights to Philips Arena on June 24, 2015, Tony Ressler announced his intentions of remodeling the arena to keep the Hawks in Downtown Atlanta at a cost between $150 million and $250 million. The proposed renovation would rebuild the entire seating bowl to optimize its sightlines for basketball and remove the wall of suites which dominate one side of the arena and replace them with a more traditional suite configuration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trubey|first1=J. Scott|last2=Vivlamore|first2=Chris|title=Atlanta may help pay for arena remodel to keep Hawks downtown|url=http://www.myajc.com/news/news/local/atlanta-to-help-pay-for-arena-remodel-to-keep-hawk/nn757/|accessdate=August 3, 2016|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|date=October 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hawks are also in discussions with the city about building a mixed-use entertainment district similar to [[L.A. Live]] around Philips Arena, to better connect it to other nearby attractions such as [[Centennial Olympic Park]] and [[Mercedes-Benz Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bluestein|first1=Greg|last2=Trubey|first2=J. Scott|title=Hawks, city in talks for entertainment district at Philips Arena|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/hawks-city-in-talks-for-entertainment-district-at-/nqfnk/|accessdate=August 3, 2016|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal Constitution]]|date=March 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, 2016, the Hawks and the city of Atlanta reached a financing agreement on renovating Philips Arena, with the city contributing $142.5 million and the Hawks $50 million plus cost overruns to the project. With the renovation, the Hawks signed a lease extension lasting through June 30, 2046, with an early termination penalty of $200 million plus the remaining balance of the arena's bonds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Trubey|first1=J.

The first phase of renovations, completed during the Hawks' 2017 off-season, removed the upper levels of the suite wall, reducing the total number of suites from 90 to 40, and added the Courtside Club behind one of the baskets. Renovations for 2018 were described by Hawks chief operating officer Thad Sheely as a "gut rehab". The arena renovations brought new premium seating areas, connected 360-degree concourses, a new center-hung videoboard three times larger than its predecessor as well as additional videoboards in the corners of the upper decks, new dining options including a bar and grill operated by country group [[Zac Brown Band]] and other unique features including an in-arena barber shop operated by Atlanta rapper [[Killer Mike]] and [[Topgolf]] suites. Over {{convert|100000|ft2|m2|0|abbr=on}} of former office and storage space within the arena was repurposed as "fan space". The first ticketed event at the renovated State Farm Arena was [[So So Def Recordings|So So Def]]'s 25th anniversary concert on October 21, 2018, while the Hawks' first regular season home game took place on October 24 against the [[2018–19 Dallas Mavericks season|Dallas Mavericks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tucker |first1=Tim |title=Extreme makeover is transforming Philips Arena |url=https://www.ajc.com/sports/extreme-makeover-transforming-philips-arena/dyJls5VLE2Qop1OwhIvEBO/#2 |accessdate=June 9, 2018 |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Zac Brown's Social Club|url=http://transformation.hawks.com/neighborhoods/zac-browns-social-club/|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Philips Arena Entertainment|url=http://transformation.hawks.com/entertainment/|publisher=Atlanta Hawks|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Oliviero |first1=Helena |last2=Tucker |first2=Tim |title=Fans appreciate open feel of Hawks’ new home |url=https://www.ajc.com/lifestyles/fans-appreciate-open-feel-hawks-new-home/1z505aswBs5LwXRuEesqqI/ |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=October 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ruggieri |first1=Melissa |title=Concert review: So So Def 25th anniversary concert opens State Farm Arena with hits, surprise guests |url=https://www.ajc.com/blog/music/concert-review-def-25th-anniversary-concert-opens-state-farm-arena-with-hits-surprise-guests/hf4elsdJuGzr0uTDhATOaO/ |accessdate=October 26, 2018 |work=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution |date=October 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the renovations conflicting with the WNBA schedule, the Dream announced that they would move their 2017 and 2018 home schedules to [[McCamish Pavilion]] on the campus of [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], mirroring the Hawks' move to the same venue between the time the Omni was razed and State Farm Arena was built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vivlamore|first1=Chris|title=What Philips Arena renovations will mean for Hawks seasons|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/sports/basketball/renovations-to-philips-arena-wont-interrupt-hawks-/nsK2P/|accessdate=August 24, 2016|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="952">'''Terumot''' ({{lang-he|תְּרוּמוֹת}}, lit. "Donations") is the sixth tractate of ''[[Zeraim|Seder Zeraim]]'' ("Order of Seeds") of the ''[[Mishnah]]''. It discusses two type of donations; one the terumah which is generally 1/50 of one's crop given to the Kohen and 10% of the Maaser that is given to Levite, which is given to the Kohen, called "Terumat Maaser." The laws of Terumah are still applicable to produce grown in the Land of Israel. There is debate as to whether the present day obligation is Biblical or Rabbinic.&lt;ref&gt;The Mishnah, ArtScroll Mishnah Series, Seder Zeraim, Tractate Terumos(a), pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; These laws are also mentioned in detail in the tractates "[[Demai (tractate)|Demai]]" and "[[Ma'aserot]]".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2163">'''Title 47 CFR Part 68''' is a section of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] of the United States that regulate the direct [[electrical connection]] of telecommunications equipment and [[On-premises wiring|customer premises wiring]] with the [[public switched telephone network]], certain [[private line]] services, and connection of private branch exchange (PBX) equipment to certain [[telecommunication]] interfaces.

==Scope==
*The direct [[electrical connection|connection]] of telecommunications equipment and [[On-premises wiring|customer premises wiring]] with the [[public switched telephone network]] and certain [[private line]] services, such as
**foreign [[telephone exchange|exchange]] lines at the customer premises end
**the station end of off-premises stations associated with [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] and [[Centrex]] services
**[[trunking|trunk]]-to-station tie lines at the trunk end only
**switched service network station lines, ''i.e.'', [[common control]] switching arrangements
*The direct connection of
**all PBX and similar systems to private line services for [[tie trunk]] type interfaces,
**off-premises station lines, and (3) automatic identified outward dialing ([[AIOD]]) and [[message]] [[FCC registration program|registration]]. 

Part 68 rules provide the technical and procedural standards under which direct [[electrical connection]] of customer-provided [[telephone]] equipment, systems, and protective apparatus may be made to the nationwide [[Electricity distribution|network]] without causing harm and without a requirement for protective [[Electrical circuit|circuit]] arrangements in the service-provider networks.

The equivalent European regulation is called [[TBR21]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4525">'''Turkish labour law''' provides a number of protections to employees, governed by the Labor Code, Trade Union Law, and the Constitution.

== Labor unions ==
[[Labor union]]s are legal in Turkey, and have been present since 1947. The [[Constitution of Turkey]] affirms the right of workers to form unions "without obtaining permission" and "to possess the right to become a member of a union and to freely withdraw from membership" (Article 51). Articles 53 and 54 affirm the right of workers to engage in [[collective bargaining]] and to [[Strike action|strike]], respectively. However, Turkish unions do face certain restrictions. A union must represent at least 10% of Turkish employees to be recognized as a bargaining agent, and workers in the education, national defense, sanitation, and utilities industries are banned from striking.&lt;ref name=justlanded&gt;https://www.justlanded.com/english/Turkey/Turkey-Guide/Jobs/Working-in-Turkey&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terms of employment ==
The Labor Act of 2003 establishes a 45-hour workweek, and unless otherwise agreed upon, working time will be divided equally among days worked. With a written contract, work can be divided unequally among working days, but must not exceed 11 hours in a single day. Any work beyond 45 hours in a single week is considered overtime work, which is compensated with a raise of the hourly rate of the workers' salary by 50%. The total number of overtime hours worked may not exceed 270 hours a year. There are no standard workweeks or regulations for specific working hours in Turkey; employers may arrange the number of days and decide on the specific hours worked within the legal limits on work hours per week. The Labor Act bans discrimination based on sex, religion, or political affiliation, and mandates that employees should only be terminated with "valid cause". Those fired without what is deemed to be valid cause are entitled to be compensated through [[severance pay]] and "notice pay" for the employers' failure to provide adequate notice to the employee. The law also mandates that any employment arrangement lasting at least one year must be expressed in a written contract between the employer and employee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crossborderemployer.com/post/2012/11/28/Turkey-Continues-Its-Reform-Of-Labor-And-Employment-Laws-Despite-Waning-Enthusiasm-For-EU-Membership.aspx | title=Fisher Phillips: Fisher Phillips Turkey Continues its Reform of Labor and Employment Laws}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=businessculture&gt;{{cite web | url=http://businessculture.org/southern-europe/business-culture-in-turkey/work-life-balance-in-turkey/ | title=Work-life balance}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=terms&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/investmentguide/investorsguide/employeesandsocialsecurity/Pages/TermsOfEmployment.aspx | title=Terms of Employment - Invest in Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Full-time employees who have worked a minimum of one year are entitled to 14 working days' paid leave per year. This increases to 20 working days after 5 years, and 26 working days after 15 years. In addition, there are eight paid holidays per year (six public holidays and two periods of religious holidays).&lt;ref name=terms/&gt;

Turkish child labor law sets the minimum age for part-time employment at 13, on condition that it is not hard physical labor and they continue to attend school, and the minimum age for full-time employment at 15. In spite of this, illegal child labor is not uncommon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.meltingpot.org/I-don-t-have-dreams-Childhood-Lost.html#.W_ahwmhKjIU|title=I don’t have dreams - Childhood Lost.

== International cooperation ==
Turkey is a member of the [[International Labour Organization]], and a signatory to the [[Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention]] and [[Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining Convention, 1949]].

[[Image:Official VSCP logo.png|250px|right]]
The '''Very Simple Control Protocol''' ('''VSCP''') &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hedman|first1=Ake|title=YAP|url=http://www.vscp.org/docs/vscpspec|website=VSCP Specification|publisher=Grodans Paradis AB|accessdate=4 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a free automation protocol suitable for all sorts of automation task where [[Building automation|building-]] or [[Home automation|home-automation]] is in the main focus.

Its main advantage is that each VSCP-node can work completely autonomous, being part of distributed network of other nodes.

VSCP is independent from the physical layer (e.g. [[CAN bus]], [[Ethernet]], [[RS-485]], [[RS-232]], [[MiWi]]) connecting the individual nodes to form the automation network bus. On the bus there can be nodes reading switches, controlling [[Lighting control system|lighting]], [[Window Blinds|blinds]], windows or information displays, broadcasting physical measurements (e.g. [[temperature]], [[luminosity]], power consumption, etc.), [[multimedia]] control, [[Burglar alarm|burglar-]] or [[Fire alarm system|fire-alarm]], etc.

There is a subset of the protocol (Level I) that is very much tailored to the [[CAN bus]] and resource restricted [[microcontroller]]s. Protocol Level II is designed for Ethernet (UDP, TCP and own Ethernet-type ''Raw-Ethernet'') and wireless physical layers. All share the same common message fields and framework and can be connected through gateways.

==Event==
VSCP is based on ''events''. Each time an ''event'' occurs it is broadcast towards all other nodes. Each node on the network will receive the event and will decide if this event needs to be handled or not.

The example given in the diagram describes a button being pressed. This will result in node 1 sending an event message onto the bus informing all others the button is pressed. Node 2 receives the message but decides this button should not trigger an event for node 2. Node 3 receives the message and decides this button should trigger lamp 2 to turn on.

There can be ''events'' for all sorts of things happening: an event can be a button pressed, a presence sensor being triggered, or the sun setting. Events can also be sent periodically, for instance a temperature reading every minute. VSCP predefines many events that could be happening. These events are defined into classes and types. Whether or not an event received should be handled is determined by the ''decision matrix'' or DM in short. Also the DM is explained further.

==Event Class and Type==
Events are organized into ''Classes''. A class is a collection of events that somehow belong together. There are classes for ''ALARM'', ''MEASUREMENTS'', ''CONTROL'', ''INFORMATION'', etc. Currently VSCP specifies about 25 classes, but has room for many more 1. Each class is on its turn subdivided into ''types''. A type further specifies the event within the class. For instance, events of Class ''20'' (0x14) are ''INFORMATION'' events. In this class there is a subtype ''1'' (0x01) ''BUTTON'' signaling a button being pressed. In this same INFORMATION class there are also types to signal ''ON'', ''OFF'', ''BELOW LIMIT'', etc. Likewise in class ''measurements'' there are types to signal temperature, current, voltage, etc. Having all these classes and types defined makes the nodes speak the same language. For a full list of pre-defines classes &amp; types check the VSCP wiki.

==VSCP event datagram structure==
Events that are broadcast contain a number of fields together forming one VSCP datagram. Exactly how these fields are mapped onto the physical layer is specified for a number of physical layer protocols such as CAN, Ethernet, TCP, etc. For others it is not yet
defined, but it is in general not difficult to map these fields onto a physical layer protocol. There are 2 ''levels'' of the VSCP protocol called ''LEVEL I'' &amp; ''LEVEL II''. They are both basically the same protocol but differ in size of the different fields.

Level I is intended to run on nodes with more constrained resources and fields are defined a bit more conservatively. Level I is in fact a subset of level II, and with an appropriate gateway events can transverse between a Level I &amp; II network.

Level II is intended to be run on nodes that have little resource constraints and can easily cope with larger message sizes.

==Decision matrix==
[[Image:VSCP_Class_Event_mask_filter.png|350px|right|VSCP class/event mask &amp; filter]]
When events are received by a node the node needs to determine if it needs to execute a task based on that event. This is done by evaluating the ''decision matrix'' or DM in short. The DM matrix is made of a number of IF ... THEN ... conditions. Each such IF/THEN condition is called a ''line'' and multiple lines make up the decision matrix.

The Class and Type of the incoming message is always evaluated by a DM line. Evaluating Class &amp; Type is done by passing the Class/Type through a mask first and then comparing with a filter.
This method allows multiple class/Types to trigger a valid condition for 1 line of the DM. The other conditions for the DM line (SenderGUID, Zone, Subzone) are optionally evaluated.
If the DM line is valid then the ''ACTION'' is executed. Together with the ''ACTION'' there is an ''ACTION parameters''. An example ACTION would be: ''turn-on relay 6'' with ''6'' being the ''action parameter''.
Exactly which ACTIONs are possible by the receiving node is determined by the design of the node itself. It is up to the firmware developer to define which actions can be executed. By then documenting the possible action in the MDF file (see later) the configuration SW will know how to select this action.
The DM can be modified by setting the appropriate node configuration registers. A convenient way to do this is using the VSCPWorks configuration SW.

==DataPayload==
An event being sent can also carry a data payload. The content &amp; organization of this payload is depending on the class and type of the event. For example, an event of class ''10'' (measurement) and type ''6'' (temperature) will carry the temperature data (with coding determined by byte 0, degrees or Celsius) in its payload. A ''button'' event will carry information about the button &amp; button zone/subzone in its datapayload. For each class/type the data formatting is determined in the spec, please consult the wiki for details.

==Zone/subzone==
Some (quite some) events contain a field ''zone'' and a field ''subzone'' in their datapayload.
This functionality is present to make ''grouping'' of nodes possible.
For instance we could determine that all buttons controlling a certain lamp are part of the same group. This simplifies the DM for certain scenarios. Instead of having one DM line as the lamp node for each button (1 line per button: IF button x then turn-on lamp) we could have 1 DM line only saying ''IF (zone match) THEN turn-on lamp''. Making multiple node switches part of a group is done by configuring the nodes, the firmware of the node will support this functionality.

==Configuring a VSCP node==
A node needs to be configured appropriately before it will execute its function. Each VSCP node provides its own set of configuration registers tailored for its function. A button node would have some possibility to configure the zone/subzones the buttons belong to. A
temperature node would have some possibility to set trigger values. Also configuring the DM is part of configuring a node.

==Configuration registers==
[[Image:VSCP register space.png|250px|thumb|right|VSCP register space]]
Configuring a node is done by writing to ''registers''. Each (Level I) node provides access to 256 registers. The highest 128 registers are reserved for VSCP core functions. In these 128 registers we find items such as node GUID, Nickname, MDF and a paging register. The lower 128 registers are free for application specific use. If 128 registers are not sufficient then there is a 16bit paging possibility. This allows for 65536 x 128 8bit registers for application use.
Writing/reading these registers is done using ''CLASS 0'' events. ''Class 0'' events are ''VSCP protocol functionality'' messages intended for configuring and managing nodes.

==Module Description File==
Keeping track of which register serves what purpose can be a challenge, especially for the application specific registers. But this is where the module description file or MDF comes in. The MDF file is a machine-readable XML file describing the function of each register of a module, giving the configuration options for that register, etc. This file is used by configuration software (VSCPWorks) to show configuration options specific for the module addressed. The MDF file can be stored on the node itself and fetched from there by
VSCPWorks, but more commonly the MDF file will be an XML file hosted on a webserver somewhere. A node then just needs to inform VSCPWorks where (URL) the XML file can be found. This URL is present in the VSCP reserved registers 0xE0-0xFF.

==VSCPWorks==
[[File:VSCPworks screenshot.jpeg|350px|thumb|right|Screenshot of VSCPworks]]
VSCPworks is the PC (Linux &amp; Windows)-based tool to configure and manage the nodes. VSCPWorks allows reading/setting registers presenting those registers in a human-readable format by parsing the MDF file automatically. VSCPWorks also provides wizards to set the decision matrix.

==VSCP &amp; Friends==
If VSCP is the protocol ''VSCP &amp; Friends'' is used to name a software API, schema and abstraction layer built around VSCP. ''VSCP &amp; Friends'' allow for layered abstractions of legacy devices by using drivers that make them look like VSCP devices. This means any device can be controlled and monitored with the VSCP &amp; Friends framework. ''VSCP &amp; Friends'' solves four common [[Internet of Things|IoT]] and [[Machine-to-Machine|M2M]] problems

* Uniform device discovery and identification.
* Uniform device configuration.
* Autonomous/distributed device functionality.
* Uniform way to update/maintain device firmware.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2325">The '''Working Party on the Reorganisation of the Income Tax Act 1976''' was a committee appointed by the [[New Zealand]] government to advise on the appropriate reorganisation of the [[income tax]] legislation.  The Working Party was set up in 1993 as a result of recommendations made by the [[Valabh Committee]] set up to review the overall income tax system.  The Working Party comprised Arthur Valabh (Chair), Dame [[Margaret Bazley]], and Sir [[Kenneth Keith]].

The Working Party issued two reports on the reorganisation of the then [[Income Tax Act 1976]].&lt;ref&gt;http://executive.govt.nz/96-99/compliance/appendix9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Following on from these reports the government in 1995 established a review process for rewriting the income tax legislation, overseen by an advisory panel drawn from the private and public sectors.&lt;ref&gt;Core Provisions: Rewriting the Income Tax Act 1976 - A Discussion Document {{ISBN|978-0-478-10304-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Income Tax Act has since been largely rewritten in a plain English style with a radically re-organised structure, including a unique (for New Zealand) alpha-numeric section referencing system (as opposed to the more usual numeric system.  It was re-enacted as the Income Tax Act 1994 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2004/0035/latest/DLM245342.html&lt;/ref&gt; and again as the Income Tax Act 2007 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ird.govt.nz/technical-tax/legislation/2007/2007-35/&lt;/ref&gt; as the various parts of the legislation was progressively rewritten.

The Rewrite Advisory Panel was established initially to oversee the rewrite process, but from 2004 it was also tasked with determining whether there are errors (or "unintended legislative changes") in the rewriting of the Income Tax Acts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rewriteadvisory.govt.nz&lt;/ref&gt; The Panel was disestablished in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=https://www.beehive.govt.nz/release/plain-english-tax-panel-disestablished|title=Plain English tax panel disestablished|date=2 December 2014|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its chairs were Colin Blair (1995–2003), Sir [[Ivor Richardson]] (2003-08) and David McLay (2008–14).
