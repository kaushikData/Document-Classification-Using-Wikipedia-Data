'''720p''' (1280×720 [[Pixel|px]]; also called '''[[HD Ready]]''' or standard HD) is a progressive [[High-definition television|HDTV]] signal format with 720 horizontal lines and an [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] (AR) of [[16:9]], normally known as widescreen HDTV (1.78:1). All major HDTV broadcasting standards (such as [[SMPTE 292M]]) include a 720p format, which has a resolution of 1280×720; however, there are other formats, including [[HDV]] Playback and [[AVCHD]] for camcorders, that use 720p images with the standard HDTV resolution. The [[frame rate]] is standards-dependent, and for conventional broadcasting appears in 50 progressive frames per second in former PAL/SECAM countries (Europe, Australia, others), and 59.94 frames per second in former NTSC countries (North America, Japan, Brazil, others).

The number ''720'' stands for the 720 horizontal [[scan line]]s of image [[display resolution]] (also known as 720 pixels of vertical resolution).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/term.cfm/720p |title=720p - AfterDawn: Glossary of technology terms &amp; acronyms}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''p'' stands for [[progressive scan]], i.e. non-interlaced. When broadcast at 60.00 frames/s{{refn|It is however more commonly broadcast at (60/1.001), or precisely 59.{{overline|940059}} frames/sec, matching the NTSC SDTV field rate; this and the 50.00 Hz of PAL are still the second and third highest standard framerates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/60026 |title=Will the End of NTSC Be the End of 59.94? |publisher=TVTechnology |date=2008-01-09 |accessdate=2010-10-08 |first=Randy |last=Hoffner}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} frames per second, 720p features the highest [[temporal resolution]] possible under the [[ATSC (standards)|ATSC]] and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] standards. The term assumes a [[widescreen]] [[Aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of [[16:9]], thus implying a resolution of 1280×720 [[pixel|px]] (0.9 [[Pixel#Megapixel|megapixels]]).

720i (720 lines [[Interlaced video|interlaced]]) is an erroneous term found in numerous sources and publications. Typically, it is a typographical error in which the author is referring to the 720p HDTV format. However, in some cases it is incorrectly presented as an actual alternative format to 720p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=HDTV for Dummies |last=Briere |first=Daniel |author2=Patrick Hurley |year=2006 |page=13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jb62Hkrj0oYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=hdtv+for+dummies |publisher=[[For Dummies]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; No proposed or existing broadcast standard permits 720 ''interlaced'' lines in a video frame at any frame rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|format=PDF |url=http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a72/a_72_part_1.pdf |title=ATSC Standard: Video System Characteristics of AVC in the ATSC Digital Television System |date=2008-07-29 |accessdate=2011-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004122811/http://www.atsc.org/cms/standards/a72/a_72_part_1.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comparison with 1080i ==
Progressive scanning reduces the need to prevent flicker by anti-aliasing single high contrast horizontal lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.afterdawn.com/glossary/term.cfm/720p |title=720p |publisher=AfterDawn |date=2010-08-10 |accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6301006-1.html |title=720p |publisher=[[CNET Networks|CNET]] Glossary |accessdate=2010-10-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930062950/http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6301006-1.html |archivedate=2010-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also easier to perform high-quality 50↔60&amp;nbsp;Hz conversion and slow-motion clips with progressive video.

A 720p60 (720p at 59.94&amp;nbsp;Hz) video has advantage over 480i and 1080i60 (29.97/30 frame/s, 59.94/60&amp;nbsp;Hz) in that it comparably reduces the number of 3:2 artifacts introduced during transfer from 24 frame/s film. However, 576i and 1080i50 (25 frame/s, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz), which are common in Europe, generally do not suffer from [[telecine|pull down]] artifacts as film frames are simply played at 25 frames and the audio pitch corrected by 25/24ths. As a result, 720p60 is used for U.S. broadcasts while European HD broadcasts often use 1080i50 24* frame, with a horizontal resolution of 1920 or 1440 depending on bandwidth constraints. However, some European broadcasters do use the 720p50 format, such as German broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]], the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ([[NRK]]) and Spanish Radio and Television Corporation ([[TVE HD]]). [[Arte]], a dual-language French-German channel produced in collaboration by ARD, ZDF and [[France Télévisions]], broadcasts in German at 720p50 but in French at 1080i50.  The Flemish Broadcasting Company ([[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT]]) in Belgium was using 720p50, but switched to 1080i50 a few years ago.

'''''Alien 2: On Earth''''', also known as '''''Alien Terror''''', is a 1980 Italian-American science fiction horror film, written and directed by [[Ciro Ippolito]] before the [[trademark]] ''Alien'' was registered. It was released following the success of the 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' as an [[unofficial sequel]], albeit having little connection to the film.

The film features a score by [[Guido De Angelis]] and [[Maurizio De Angelis]], performed by the composers under the [[pseudonym]] Oliver Onions. {{cn|date=September 2014}} The film co-starred a young [[Michele Soavi]], years before he became a famed Italian horror film director in his own right, and a cameo appearance by Ciro Ippolito himself (in the role of "Joe"). It was filmed in [[California]], the [[Cinecittà]] studios in Rome, and in the [[Castellana Caves]].

==Plot==
As the world awaits the return of [[Alien (film)|a crew of astronauts from a deep space mission]], a young woman named Thelma Joyce appears on a television talk show to discuss caves. Soon after her interview begins, Thelma has a horrible psychic vision. After the spacecraft returns to Earth missing its occupants, a girl on a beach discovers a weird, blue, pulsating rock. Her mother soon finds her with her face ripped off.

Thelma and her husband Roy meet up with their friends for a trip to explore a cave. The group stops at a roadside café to buy food and change into their caving gear. Thelma's friend Burt discovers a blue rock that he decides to keep in his pack.

The group arrives at the cave, and quickly rappels to the bottom to set up camp for the night. Before falling asleep, Thelma tells Roy that she feels that something horrible is about to happen, but Roy calms her down.

The next day, Thelma's friend Jill discovers the blue rock that Burt found appears to be pulsating. The rock opens up and a creature attacks her face. Thelma witnesses the attack and panics. Roy calms her down, then decides to go find Jill's body.

Roy rappels down into a hole and finds Jill, alive and with her face intact. The rest of the group rappels down the hole as well and they strap Jill to a lifter so that she may be lifted out of the hole. Jill is set aside by herself, still unconscious. While the group prepares to climb out of the hole, a creature erupts from Jill's face and attacks Phil's neck. Phil is dragged upside down as the creature slices his neck repeatedly until his head falls off.

The group retreats though they are forced to initially go back to retrieve their equipment. The group splits up into teams to search for a way out, but to no avail. During the search Thelma reflects on what is happening and wonders if the disappearance of the astronauts is connected. Maurine stumbles upon a group of aliens who kill her and Burt who tries to save her. Roy hurts his ankle and is forced to sit and rest. Cliff opts to go and locate Burt and Maurine while the others rest. Thelma telepathically warns Cliff of a nearby alien after their radio goes dead, though Cliff is killed by the alien. Thelma and the others find Cliff who is actually an alien in disguise. Thelma uses her abilities to explode the imposter's head revealing the alien. The alien attacks the other member of the group while Thelma and Roy outrun the alien and escape the caves. On their way back to the city, they discover a police car, but no police officers are in sight. They stop at the roadside café again, but no one is there. Roy tries to call for help on a payphone, but no operator is available. They get back into the car and continue to drive to the city.

Thelma and Roy finally get back to the city, but strangely, they cannot find anyone. They stop at the bowling alley, only to find that it is also empty. Roy goes to the back, only to be killed by an alien waiting there. The alien chases Thelma through the bowling alley, until she hits it in the head and leaves. Thelma runs through the empty city streets, calling for help but getting no answer. She finally stops yelling and sits down in an intersection. Suddenly, text shoots at the screen, warning the audience "You may be next!", implying that the aliens have taken over Earth.

==Release==
The film was released theatrically in Italy on April 11, 1980 as ''Alien 2: Sulla Terra'' ('"Alien 2: On Earth") and in [[West Germany]] on March 19, 1982 as ''Alien, die Saat des Grauens kehrt zurück'' ("Alien, the Seed of Horror Returns").
The  [[English language|English]]-dubbed version was released theatrically in a limited way by Cinema Shares International Distribution (which distributed films such as ''[[Creature from Black Lake]]'', ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[The Pod People]]'').&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/03/22/hereafter-skyline-and-other-blu-ray-releases-of-the-week-032211/?mod=WSJBlog&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2011, Midnight Legacy re-released the English-dubbed version of the film on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] in the United States under its original title, ''Alien 2: On Earth'', in a 30,000 copy pressing. The re-release includes fully remastered picture and audio, although during the process, it was noted that some of the audio was missing and it had to be mixed from a variety of sources. This version of the film was believed to be longer than any other version, but a prior Italian television version contained additional scenes not present in the Midnight Legacy version. Midnight Legacy's release contains special effects outtakes and a Dutch trailer.

==Critical reception==
{{expand section|date=September 2015}}
Adam Tyner of ''[[DVD Talk]]'' wrote, "James Cameron once summed up his followup to Alien as 'forty miles of bad road'. Alien 2, meanwhile, is 'eighty-four minutes of bad, period'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/47613/alien-2-on-earth/ | title=Alien 2 | author=Adam Tyner | publisher=[[DVD Talk]] | accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daryl Loomis of ''[[DVD Verdict]]'' said, "Some people will say that Alien 2: On Earth is a blatant ripoff and some will say that it's a terrible movie. All of those people are right, but given my track record, nobody should be surprised that I love it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In [[professional wrestling]], '''blading''' is the practice of intentionally cutting oneself to provoke bleeding.&lt;ref name=race/&gt; It is also known as "juicing", "gigging", or "getting color".&lt;ref name=race/&gt; Similarly, a blade is an object used for blading and a bladejob is a specific act of blading. The act is usually done a good length into the match as the blood will mix with the flowing [[sweat]] to make it look like much more blood is flowing from the wound than there actually is.&lt;ref name=ecw&gt;Scott E. Williams. Hardcore History: The Extremely Unauthorized Story of ECW (p.107-108)&lt;/ref&gt; The preferred area for blading is usually the forehead, as scalp wounds bleed profusely and heal easily. Legitimate, unplanned bleeding which occurs outside the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|storyline]] is called "juicing the hard way".&lt;ref&gt;Stone Cold Steve Austin. ''The Stone Cold Truth'' (p.90)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prior to the advent of blading, most storyline blood in wrestling came from one wrestler deliberately splitting the flesh over their opponent's eyebrow bone with a well placed and forceful punch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ddtdigest.com/features/blading/ The History of Blading]&lt;/ref&gt; In his third autobiography, ''The Hardcore Diaries'', [[Mick Foley]] cites [[Terry Funk]] as one of the few remaining active wrestlers who knows how to "bust an eyebrow open" in this way. However on a most rare occasion, in the 2012 [[Extreme Rules (2012)|Extreme Rules]] event, [[Brock Lesnar]] caused [[John Cena]] to bleed without blading  with a vicious elbow to his head and further hard strikes to Cena's body, though Cena ultimately won the match.&lt;ref&gt;https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1166171-wwe-extreme-rules-results-john-cena-may-have-a-legit-injury&lt;/ref&gt; The forehead has always been the preferred blading surface, due to the abundance of blood vessels. A cut in this area will bleed freely for quite some time and will heal quickly.&lt;ref name=king/&gt; A cut in this location will allow the blood to mix in with the sweat on the wrestler's face, giving them the proverbial "crimson mask" effect. 

In modern [[North America]]n professional wrestling, blading is almost exclusively performed by and on male performers; blading of women is extremely rare due to the risk of adverse publicity and the increasing use of female performers as "[[Physical attractiveness|eye candy]]". Typically, a wrestler will use a [[razor]] blade that is hidden somewhere on their body.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;Jerry Lawler and Doug Asheville. It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes (p.83)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hardy"&gt;Matt and Jeff Hardy. The Hardy Boyz: Exist 2 Inspire (p.48-49)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wrestler always runs the risk of cutting too deeply and slicing an [[artery]] in the forehead.&lt;ref name="race" /&gt; In 2004, [[Eddie Guerrero]] accidentally did this during his match with [[John Layfield|JBL]] at ''[[Judgment Day (2004)|Judgment Day]]'', resulting in a rush of blood pouring from the bladed area. Guerrero lost so much blood because of the cut that he felt the effects from it for two weeks.

Some wrestlers like [[Abdullah the Butcher]],&lt;ref name="mf201"&gt;Foley, Mick. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.201)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], [[New Jack]], [[Steve Corino]] and [[Devon Hughes]] (Brother Devon/D-Von Dudley) have disfiguring scars on their heads from frequently blading throughout their careers. According to [[Mick Foley]], the scars in Abdullah's forehead are so deep that he enjoys holding [[coins]] or [[Poker chips|gambling chips]] in them as a macabre party trick.&lt;ref name="mf201" /&gt;

Today, blading is a lot less popular than in the past, due to the prevalence and heightened awareness of [[AIDS]] and [[hepatitis]].&lt;ref name=race&gt;Harley Race, Ricky Steamboat, Les Thatcher. The Professional Wrestlers' Workout &amp; Instructional Guide (p.106)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=king/&gt; In the 1980s, the willingness to blade was seen as an advantage of new wrestlers.&lt;ref name=mick123&gt;Mick Foley. Have A Nice Day: A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks (p.123)&lt;/ref&gt; From July 2008 onward, due to its [[TV Parental Guidelines#TV-PG|TV-PG]] rating, [[WWE]] has not allowed wrestlers to blade themselves. In most cases, any blood coming from the wrestlers is unintentional. To maintain their TV-PG rating, WWE television programs shift to [[black-and-white]] if a wrestler bleeds in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wrestlingnewsworld.com/wwes-anti-blood-policy-swagger-to-be-suspended-android-app-piledriver-banned/ |title=WWE’s Anti-Blood Policy, Swagger To Be Suspended?, Android App, Piledriver Banned |author=Gray, Richard |publisher=''Wrestling News World'' |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Impact Wrestling]], formerly known as Total Nonstop Action (TNA) Wrestling used blading frequently until adopting a new no blood policy in 2014. Wrestlers [[Abyss (wrestler)|Abyss]] and [[Raven_(wrestler)|Raven]] were famed for the matches involving the most blood in TNA before the new policy in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlingforum.com/impact-wrestling/1515233-no-more-blading-tna-contract-news.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smarkoutmoment.com/2010/08/tna-hardcore-justice-2010-results.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2014/1216/587762/news-on-changes-to-impact-wrestling/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Perhaps the most famous such incident was a bladejob performed by [[Professional wrestling in Japan|Japanese]] wrestler [[Keiji Mutoh|The Great Muta]] in a 1992 match with [[Hiroshi Hase]]; the amount of blood Muta lost was so great that many people to this day judge the severity of bladejobs on the ''[[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Muta scale|Muta Scale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.411mania.com/wrestling/video_reviews/44204|title=Complete Playbook: The Great Muta Vol. 2 Revenge of Muta Commercial Tape|first=Ryan|last=Mancuso|publisher=411mania.com|date=2006-09-11|accessdate=2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another such incident was during an [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]] [[house show]] when a young wrestler known as [[Mass Transit incident (professional wrestling)|Mass Transit]] forged documents and lied to ECW Owner/Promoter [[Paul Heyman]] about his age and amount of training. He then asked his opponent, [[New Jack]], to blade him. Jack cut through two arteries in Mass Transit's head when he bladed the young man, and fifty stitches were required to close the wound. A wrestler allowing someone else to blade him is extremely rare.{{CN|date=February 2018}}

In [[Bret Hart]]'s autobiography ''[[Hitman: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling]]'', Hart stated that he bladed [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] during the infamous [[Professional wrestling match types#Variations of singles matches|No Disqualification Submission Match]] at [[WrestleMania 13]], at a time when blading was forbidden, and Austin had never bladed during a match before. Contrary to Hart's biography, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin|Austin]] actually had bled during matches many times before. His own [[autobiography]] states that he often 'got color' during matches with earlier opponents including [[Dustin Runnels]] during his run in [[WCW]]. Video footage of the event shows Austin's wrist tape unravelling after he began to bleed, as if he had removed a blade from about his person, to use willingly on himself.{{CN|date=February 2018}}

During an interview on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', [[Mickey Rourke]] spoke about his experience with gigging himself for a scene in the 2008 movie ''[[The Wrestler (2008 film)|The Wrestler]]''. Rourke agreed to gig at the initial request of director [[Darren Aronofsky]] in hopes that he would revoke the demand come production time. Indeed, later during filming, Aronofsky admitted that Rourke needn't actually gig; however, by his own will, Rourke decided to go through with it anyway.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', January 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In the film itself, Rourke's character is seen preparing for a match by wrapping a razor blade inside his wrist tape.

There is one notable incident of blading in [[association football]]. In 1989, [[Chile]]an national team [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Roberto Rojas]] bladed himself to prevent a loss, by blaming the injury on fireworks thrown by opposing fans. [[FIFA]] saw through the ruse and ended up banning Rojas for life and banning Chile from the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. Rojas's ban was lifted in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Edwards|first1=Piers|title=World Cup scandal!

Canadian wrestler [[Devon Nicholson]] pressed charges against Abdullah the Butcher, claiming that he contracted [[hepatitis C]] after Abdullah bladed him without consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-wrestler-claims-wwe-legend-gave-him-hep-c-1.1096801|title= Ottawa wrestler claims WWE legend gave him hep C |date= July 29, 2011 | accessdate=2014-09-03|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Ontario court ruled in favor of Nicholson and ordered Abdullah to pay [[Canadian dollar|$]]2.3 million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/ottawa-wrestler-hannibal-wins-2-3m-hepatitis-c-lawsuit-1.2663253|title= Ottawa wrestler 'Hannibal' wins $2.3M hepatitis C lawsuit|date= June 3, 2014 | accessdate=2014-09-03|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During their King of the Road match at [[Uncensored (1995)|Uncensored 1995]], [[Goldust|Dustin Rhodes]] and [[Barry Darsow|The Blacktop Bully]] bladed, which was against the policy of [[World Championship Wrestling]] at the time, and they were both fired as a result.&lt;ref name="Rhodes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dustyrhodeswrestling.com/dustin_rhodes.htm|title=Dustin Rhodes|publisher=[[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|DustyRhodesWrestling.com]]|accessdate=2007-08-15|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929121730/http://www.dustyrhodeswrestling.com/dustin_rhodes.htm|archivedate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bohemia Interactive''' is a [[video game development]] studio and [[video game publisher|publisher]], based in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. The company focuses on creating military [[simulation game]]s such as ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'' and the ''[[ARMA (series)|ARMA]]'' series. It was also known for working on a game conversion of the ''[[DayZ (video game)|DayZ]]'' [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] created for ''[[ARMA 2]]''.

Founded by Marek Španěl in 1999, the studio released its first game in 2001, a military shooter titled ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'', which received critical acclaim and brought recognition for the studio. Following ''Operation Flashpoint'' was a series of downturns, such as [[port]]ing the game to [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]], which led to financial losses and the development of a sequel later abandoned by the publisher [[Codemasters]]. The studio fell into financial troubles until the [[United States Marine Corps]] employed the studio to create simulation games to train soldiers. A new division called [[Bohemia Interactive Simulations]] was created, and later spun off and become a standalone business entity. Following Codemasters' decision of not supporting the studio, Bohemia Interactive decided to develop a [[spiritual successor]] to ''Cold War Crisis'' titled ''[[ARMA: Armed Assault]]''. It was both a critical and financial success, spawning a number of sequels. Smaller projects such as ''[[Take On Helicopters]]'' were also released.

In 2012, [[Dean Hall (game designer)|Dean Hall]] produced ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' a mod for ''[[ARMA 2]]'', that prompted the studio to develop a [[DayZ (video game)|standalone game]]. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with [[espionage]] by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ''[[ARMA 3]]''{{'}}s setting to a fictional one. The company is working on several new projects, including making a survival game named ''Vigor'', preparing ''DayZ'' for an eventual full release and developing ''[[Ylands]]'', a [[sandbox game]] which was part of Bohemia Incubator, a platform for Bohemia Interactive to release small, experimental projects

==History==
===Early history===
Bohemia Interactive was founded by Marek Španěl, Ondřej Španěl and Slavomír Pavlíček. He aspired to become a game developer in the 1980s, after his brother was convinced to buy a [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A]] computer. Španěl first worked as a salesman for a game distribution company and made a 3D hovercraft simulator ''[[Gravon: Real Virtuality]]'' for [[Atari Falcon]] in 1995, which sold 400 copies only.&lt;ref name="RPS Flashpoint"/&gt; He, along with his brother and another partner, decided to develop a game in 1997 using the money given by his former employers. He officially founded Bohemia Interactive in 1999.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-29-bohemias-war-the-story-of-the-company-behind-arma-and-dayz|title=Bohemia's war: the story of the company behind Arma and DayZ|first=Robert|last=Purchese|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=July 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712082859/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-04-29-bohemias-war-the-story-of-the-company-behind-arma-and-dayz|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team initially wanted to develop a shooter named ''Rio Grande'', which was described by Španěl as "a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] clone of ''[[River Raid]]''". However, the team did not see the potential of the project and shifted their focus to make an [[open world]] game.&lt;ref name="RPS Flashpoint"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2007/10/05/making-of-flashpoint/|title=Making Of: Operation Flashpoint|first=Kieron|last=Gillen|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|date=October 5, 2007|accessdate=October 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It then became ''Poseidon'', which was a [[first-person shooter]] with a heavy focus on realism. At that time, the team expanded significantly, from having only one full-time programmer, to having 12 full-time employees by the end of the game's development. According to Španěl, the entire development team was very enthusiastic about the game and was focused on creating a game that they "wanted to play", thus opting not to study the works of another development team. ''Poseidon'' suffered from an extended development cycle of over three years, causing some of its technologies to become outdated. Original publisher [[Interactive Magic]] was sold in 1999 and another publisher which signed the project later wanted to abandon it.&lt;ref name="RPS Flashpoint"/&gt; The frequent changes of publishers caused uncertainties regarding the game's funding. Despite these development issues, ''Poseidon'' was successfully released in June 2001 under the official title ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'' by [[Codemasters]] to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-cold-war-crisis|title=Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis for PC reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=August 9, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904090638/http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/operation-flashpoint-cold-war-crisis|archivedate=4 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was shipped without any game-breaking [[Software bug|bugs]], and it became an international success, selling more than 500,000 copies in its first three months of release, as well as reaching a top position in retail sales chart across the world including US, UK, Germany and Australia.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The team was satisfied with the game's release, with Španěl describing it as a dream coming true.&lt;ref name="OF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131427/postmortem_bohemia_interactive_.php?page=3|title=Postmortem: Bohemia Interactive Studios' Operation Flashpoint|first=Markel|last=Spanel|date=December 19, 2001|accessdate=July 10, 2017|work=[[Gamasutra]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131257/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/131427/postmortem_bohemia_interactive_.php?page=3|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bohemia Interactive won Best Debut at the [[Game Developers Choice Awards]], defeating strong opponents including [[Remedy Entertainment]] (''[[Max Payne (video game)|Max Payne]]'').&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

Following the release of ''Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis'', the team intended to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a [[porting|port]] for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox console]], and create a sequel.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Elite]],'' was released in 2005, four years after the game's initial release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/30/operation-flashpoint-elite-strikes|title=Operation Flashpoint: Elite Strikes|first=Wade|last=Steel|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 30, 2015|accessdate=July 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809132911/http://www.ign.com/articles/2005/08/30/operation-flashpoint-elite-strikes|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for the long development cycle stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With the release of a new generation of hardware including [[Xbox 360|a new Xbox console]], ''Elite''{{'}}s release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with [[Black Element Software]] and [[Altar Games]]. The organization aimed at supporting other independent game development studios with services including marketing support and negotiation with publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/7567/IDEA_Independent_Developer_Association_Formed.php|title=IDEA Independent Developer Association Formed|first=Nick|last=Maragos|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=December 19, 2005|accessdate=July 13, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111110125030/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/7567/IDEA_Independent_Developer_Association_Formed.php|archivedate=10 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team started developing a sequel to ''Operation Flashpoint'', codenamed ''Game 2'', after they canceled their [[open world]] [[wild west|Western-themed]] project, which was described as "''Flashpoint'' in Western" by Španěl. The team had lots of ambition for ''Game 2'' and hoped that it would become a perfect game, thus the team began spending an excessive amount of time on small details, from doing [[3D scanning]] of real-life weapons to modeling the player character's eyeball. However, in doing so some basics were neglected by the team, and many goals remained unattained due to the team's skill and technology status. As a result, the team constantly missed the deadlines set by publisher Codemasters. Codemasters was dissatisfied with the team's work and began looking for outside help. Bohemia disagreed with the search for outside assistance, and the two studio decided to part way with each other. With Codemasters no longer supporting the studio financially, Bohemia entered a series of financial troubles. In addition, Codemasters retained the rights to ''Operation Flashpoint'' preventing Bohemia from using the title in the future.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

===''ARMA'' series===
In the early 2000s, the [[US Army]] began using a [[mod (video gaming)|mod]] of the first ''Operation Flashpoint'', named ''[[DARWARS|DARWARS Ambush!]]'', to train soldiers. In financial distress, Bohemia capitalized on its use and made a small sum of money, saving the company from falling into immediate bankruptcy. Bohemia also set up a new division called [[Bohemia Interactive Simulations]], specializing in creating military simulation games with its ''Virtual Battle Space'' titles for armies around the world to use. Meanwhile, the main studio, realizing that they should release a game as soon as possible, decided to rework on ''Elite''{{'}} engine and make a spiritual successor to ''Cold War Crisis'' called ''Armored Assault'', later renamed ''[[ARMA: Armed Assault]]''. According to Španěl, the team hated the title. Bohemia decided to self-publish the game, and launched in an [[early access]] form. The game received high critical praise and great sales, sufficient to save the company.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

{{quotebox|quote="We can't stop [[Codemasters]] from releasing a game using the words 'Operation Flashpoint'. But it is not right to promote this game as the ‘official sequel to the multi-award winning ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'' or the ‘return' of Bohemia Interactive's ‘genre-defining military conflict simulator.'

The development of a sequel to ''ARMA'' commenced afterward. The team decided to reuse some of its assets of ''Game 2'' for ''[[ARMA 2]]'', and did not hold unrealistic ambitions for the game. A [[Xbox 360]] version was planned but was later scrapped after the team thought that its power was inferior to that of [[personal computer]]s.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; During this period, Codemasters announced ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising]]'', a game falling into competition with Bohemia's own ''ARMA'' titles, as it was marketed as the true successor to ''Cold War Crisis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/02/27/bohemia-theres-only-one-real-flashpoint-sequel/|title=Bohemia: There’s Only One Real Flashpoint Sequel|first=Kieron|last=Gillen|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=July 10, 2017|work=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809051737/https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2009/02/27/bohemia-theres-only-one-real-flashpoint-sequel/|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Španěl was not happy with how ''Dragon Rising'' is being marketed as a return to the ''Operation Flashpoint'' series despite being created without the involvement of Bohemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5161328/operation-flashpoint-development-tensions-boil-over|title=Operation Flashpoint Development Tensions Boil Over|first=Luke|last=Plunkett|date=February 27, 2009|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Kotaku]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809041736/http://kotaku.com/5161328/operation-flashpoint-development-tensions-boil-over|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team became anxious, but found relief after viewing gameplay footage ''Dragon Rising''{{'}}, which they considered to be subpar and "[did] not come even close to what they promised".&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; ''ARMA 2'' was released in mid-2009 to high critical praise and high sales.

Following the release of ''Operation Arrowhead'', the company started development of a new ''ARMA'' game, this time set in the future. The game was titled ''Arma Futura'', in which players fight aliens, and its direction once shifting to [[role-playing game|role-playing]]. All of these futuristic elements were later scrapped, and were remade into a more realistic setting. The title eventually became ''[[ARMA 3]]''. The Greek media reported in 2012 that two Czechs were arrested on the Greek island [[Lemnos]], the setting for ''ARMA III'' after being charged with espionage. This was later confirmed to be Martin Pezlar and Ivan Buchta, both of them employees at Bohemia Interactive. The main reason for their charge is that they took photos of military installations, which under Greek law threatened their [[national security]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/bohemia-interactive-tells-the-story-of-arma-and-dayz|title=Bohemia Interactive Tells the Story of Arma and DayZ|first=Pete|last=Davison|work=USgamer|date=April 30, 2014|accessdate=July 10, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809130734/http://www.usgamer.net/articles/bohemia-interactive-tells-the-story-of-arma-and-dayz|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charges were refuted, and both of them insisted that they were traveling the island for entertainment only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4425362/after-a-crazy-year-bohemia-is-hoping-for-a-much-much-quieter-life|title=After a crazy year, Bohemia is hoping for a much, much quieter life|first=Colin|last=Campbell|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 13, 2013|accessdate=July 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809131240/https://www.polygon.com/2013/6/13/4425362/after-a-crazy-year-bohemia-is-hoping-for-a-much-much-quieter-life|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; If convicted, the duo faced a 20-year sentence.

During this period of time, team morale dropped.

They had created the military simulation game ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis]]'' as their debut game, and followed it with an expansion called ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Resistance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/32781-suicide-is-painless-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-review|title=Suicide Is Painless – Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb|date=August 12, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2017|work=[[Game Revolution]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809132406/http://www.gamerevolution.com/review/32781-suicide-is-painless-stop-worrying-and-love-the-bomb-review|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Codemasters developed two ''Operation Flashpoint'' sequels, ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising]]'' and ''[[Operation Flashpoint: Red River]]'', the series was put on hiatus when Codemasters announced their plans to refocus on [[racing games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-09-14-codemasters-to-close-guildford-studio|title=Codemasters to close Guildford studio|first=Rachel|last=Weber|work=Gameindustry.biz|date=September 14, 2011|accessdate=July 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809133527/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-09-14-codemasters-to-close-guildford-studio|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Bohemia followed up their first game, ''Cold War Crisis'' with a [[spiritual successor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/armed-assault/782075p1.html|title=Armed Assault: Combat Operations|first=Kuo|last=Li|work=[[GameSpy]]|date=April 19, 2007|accessdate=July 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008193346/http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/armed-assault/782075p1.html|archivedate=8 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; called ''[[ARMA: Armed Assault]]'', which was followed up by two sequels, ''[[Arma 2]]'' and ''[[Arma 3]]'', both of which have been critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt; The developer also had another simulation franchise called ''Take On'', which includes ''[[Take On Helicopters]]'', which allows players to play as a helicopter pilot, and ''[[Take On Mars]]'', in which players explore [[Mars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/02/13/take-on-mars-lands-on-the-steam-store-after-three-years-in-early-access/|title=Take on Mars lands on the Steam Store after three years in Early Access|first=Sharif|last=Arid|work=[[VG 247]]|date=February 13, 2017|accessdate=July 12, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809133709/https://www.vg247.com/2017/02/13/take-on-mars-lands-on-the-steam-store-after-three-years-in-early-access/|archivedate=9 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both titles are smaller in scope when compared with the ''ARMA'' franchise.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;

'''Bumblebee''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] robot superhero character from the [[Transformers]] franchise. In most versions, Bumblebee is a small, yellow with black stripes [[Autobot]], with most of his alternative vehicle modes inspired by several generations of the [[Chevrolet]] American [[muscle car]]s &amp;ndash; with the live-action film versions being a yellow [[Camaro]] with black racing stripes.  The original vehicle-mode design was based on a classic European Type 1 [[Volkswagen Beetle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.chicagodefender.com/article-5370-movie-review-transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-brings-incredible-visual-effects-plus-comic-relief.html |title=Movie Review: 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' brings incredible visual effects plus comic relief |newspaper=[[The Chicago Defender]] |accessdate=September 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522204517/http://www.chicagodefender.com/article-5370-movie-review-transformers-revenge-of-the-fallen-brings-incredible-visual-effects-plus-comic-relief.html |archivedate=May 22, 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is named after the [[Bumblebee]], a black-and-yellow striped [[bee]] which inspired his paint scheme.

== Transformers: Generation 1 ==

Bumblebee (known as '''Abejorro''' in [[Mexico]], '''Bumble''' in [[Japan]], '''Moscardo''' in [[Portugal]], '''Űrdongó''' in [[Hungary]], '''Maggiolino''' in [[Italy]], '''Bourdon''' in [[France]]) is the "little brother" of the heroic or protagonistic Autobot faction and a [[mascot]], constantly striving to prove himself in the eyes of the other robots—especially his leader, [[Optimus Prime]]. This often causes him to take risks that put him in danger. Although a bit of a smart aleck, he is a capable and reliable messenger and spy, his small size allowing him to go places that his larger commanders cannot. He is highly fuel-efficient, has great visual acuity, is particularly adaptable to undersea environments and transforms into a Saturn yellow [[Volkswagen Beetle]]. He was later reconstructed into a stronger, more mature form as Goldbug.

===Reception===
At [[BotCon]] 2010, Hasbro named Bumblebee as one of the first five robot inductees in the Transformers Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/discover/movie-news/Hall-Of-Fame-robots.cfm |title=Transformers Hall of Fame Robots |website=Hasbro.com |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100705131942/http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/en_US/discover/movie-news/Hall-Of-Fame-robots.cfm |archive-date=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Animated series ===
====The Transformers====
Bumblebee holds the distinction of being the second character to appear on-screen in the original ''Transformers'' animated series, while on a mission to recover a small clutch of energy conductors with [[Wheeljack]], illustrating the energy crisis holding sway over their home planet of [[Cybertron]]. These two characters were often seen together in the first season and beginning of the second season, sometimes going on missions. Bumblebee is subsequently among the Transformers aboard [[Ark (Transformers)|the ''Ark'']] as it set off searching for new worlds and new energy sources, which crashed on Earth, causing the Transformers within to be trapped in stasis for four million years. Awakening in 1984, Bumblebee helps [[Ironhide]] quell a raging river and uses his small size to help the human Autobot ally [[Sparkplug (Transformers)|Sparkplug Witwicky]] plant explosives in the midst of a Decepticon mining operation.

He later befriends Sparkplug's son [[Spike Witwicky|Spike]], but on their first adventure together they are both kidnapped by the Decepticons, and Bumblebees memory chip were altered as he unintentionally lured the other Autobots into a trap. Bumblebee recovered in time to help his fellow Autobots stop the Decepticons from sending Spike to Cybertron. After their first adventure, Bumblebee and Spike became best friends for life as they both realized that they make a good team.

Bumblebee got injured with Spike inside from a battle with the Decepticons at a rocket base. While Bumblebee gets repaired by Ratchet, Spike's mind was transferred into Autobot X, a robot created by Sparkplug, while his real body was getting fixed at the hospital, due to his injuries from the battle being more severe then his were. When Spike left base as there was a side effect of the mind transfer, Bumblebee left afterwards to go look for his best friend but his radio transmitters weren't fixed yet. After finding Spike, Bumblebee tries to get his pal to come to his senses but failed when Spike believed that he was tricking him. Bumblebee sees the Decepticons arriving at their location but they didn't see him so he was able to hear Megatron tell lies to his best friend then left to go get Optimus and the rest of his Autobot friends for help, as they were helping with repairs at the rocket base they were battling at before. Bumblebee tells Optimus, after arriving at the rocket base, that Megatron is manipulating Spike and he's starting to believe him. Bumblebee was asks to lead the way of their location by Optimus, who feared that the Decepticons would find and take adventage of Spike messed up mind, so they can help their friend. After finding Spike, Bumblebee and Optimus tried talking some sense into him but it didn't work as they hoped it would but they were both relieved when he did when Sparkplug was endangered. After the Decepticons left, Bumblebee gave his best friend a high five when he returned to his real body when it got all fixed up.

Bumblebee accompanies Spike and Sparkplug with [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] to test out his new speakers but decided to head to headquarters so wouldn't have to deal with his loud music. When Bumblebee return to headquarters he saw no one but Bluestreak there and that Telatran One was damaged then was dragged to the recharging chamber by Bluestreak, due to Megatron putting a personality destabilizer in their recharging chamber to turn all the Autobots evil. However, Bumblebee was saved when Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug arrived back just in time as Jazz knocked Bluestreak out for a while. After Sparkplug fixed Telatran One, Bumblebee, Jazz, Spike and Sparkplug became shocked when Telatran One tells them that Megatron turned their friends from good to evil. With Bumblebee and Jazz being the only ones who weren't affected from the personality destabilizer. Bumblebee decided to stop his comrades when he hears about Optimus Prime with Brawn and Prowl attacking an Air Force jet base with Spike accompanying him. Once they arrived, Bumblebee tried a few times to get through to Optimus but to no success. Bumblebee was relieved that his friends were free from the Decepticons control, after Sparkplug invented Attitude exchanger to counteract the personality destabilizer effects, except for Optimus. Bumblebee took the last one, as there was no other ones left, as he wanted to make one final attempted to get Optimus back to his senses. Bumblebee tells his friend/leader that he's not evil and he believes in him then encourages him to fight off Megatron's control also to not give in. Bumblebee quickly put the Attitude exchanger on Optimus, who heard his voice, leg which freed him from the Decepticons control. Bumblebee was given a hug by Optimus as a thank you for not giving up on him and for saving him. After stopping the Decepticons, Bumblebee was thanked again by Optimus, who also thanked everyone for their help, for what he did for him. Bumblebee with Spike gave Ratchet and Sparkplug tools as they them to fix the Air Force jets the Autobots destroyed while under Megatron's control. 

When the body of the deceased Optimus Prime is recovered from space by a pair of Transformer-hating human scientists who intend to use it to lure the Autobots into a trap, Bumblebee is part of the rescue team led by [[Rodimus Prime]] to recover it. Entering the lab, some of the Transformers are exposed to rage-inducing alien spores that could infect them with the Hate Plague, which causes them to run wild, and although Bumblebee avoids infection, he is seriously damaged by the infected rampaging [[Aerialbots|Superion]]. A member of the alien race called the [[Quintesson]]s subsequently repair and restore Optimus Prime to life, so he can stop the Hate Plague and repair Bumblebee. The little Autobot was so severely damaged, however, that he required an entire reconstruction and is rebuilt as a [[Throttlebot]]. In his new, shiny body, he comments that he has gone beyond just being plain old Bumblebee, and is now a "gold bug", prompting Optimus Prime to redub him '''Goldbug'''. Goldbug travels with Optimus Prime to the Decepticon planet of [[Chaar]] in order to secure a heat-resistant alloy that can protect him from the plague, only to be infected on the mission and later cured when Prime uses the power of the [[Matrix of Leadership]] to purge the plague. Goldbug also makes a brief appearance in the fourth and final season of the series, defending [[Autobot City]] and Cybertron against a massive Decepticon attack. Because of an animation error, Bumblebee appears in his Bumblebee incarnation during a wide shot in a celebration during the series' final episode.

====Transformers: The Headmasters====
In ''[[Transformers: The Headmasters]]'', Goldbug and the other Throttlebots were on Cybertron when [[Vector Sigma]] began to destabilize as a consequence of [[Optimus Prime]] releasing the Matrix's energy to cure the Hate Plague the previous year. The Decepticons soon invaded the planet in an attempt to take control of the computer, and Goldbug and the Throttlebots joined [[Dinobots]] [[Grimlock]] and [[Slag (Transformers)|Slag]] in holding the line against them. Unfortunately, they were knocked unconscious by the hypnotic power of the new Decepticon [[Headmaster (Transformers)|Headmaster]] [[Mindwipe (Transformers)|Mindwipe]], but they had managed to delay the Decepticons long enough for the Autobot Headmasters to arrive and take up the fight.

The Throttlebots disappeared after this encounter, suggesting they might have been destroyed, but they eventually resurfaced months later as the Decepticons were carrying out their final plan to destroy the Earth. Goldbug and the Throttlebots teamed up with [[Fastlane (Transformers)|Fastlane]] and [[Cloudraker (Transformers)|Cloudraker]] to investigate the emergence of a "Death Tower" in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]], only to find [[Predaking]] there waiting for them. Naturally, the small 'bots were no match for the powerful combiner, but they fought bravely, clinging onto his limbs before being hurled aside. Luckily, the [[Autobot]] [[Targetmaster]]s arrived in time to bail them out and take Predaking down. This is also because of the budget cut that happened in the middle of the movie.

===Comics===
Bumblebee has appeared in numerous comic books and related media printed by various publishers.

==== 3H Enterprises ====
Bumblebee appeared in the voice actor play performed at [[BotCon]] 2004, in which a device built by [[Rhinox]] to stop [[Unicron]] from pulling victims from other dimensions inadvertently transports an Autobot shuttle under Bumblebee's command into the middle of a battle between [[Rattrap (Transformers)|Rattrap]], [[Silverbolt (Beast Wars and Beast Machines)|Silverbolt]], and [[Waspinator]] and a team of Unicron's agents. Bumblebee's shuttle is able to scoop up Rattrap and company when their ship is destroyed. After saving more of Unicron's victims from the Decepticons, Bumblebee's team returns to their own time.

====Condor Verlag====
In a story called "By their Blasters you shall know them ...!" from ''[[Transformers Comic-Magazin]]'' issue #12 by German comic publisher [[Condor Verlag]] [[Optimus Prime]] instructs [[Backstreet (Transformers)|Backstreet]], Bumblebee and [[Ruckus (Transformers)|Ruckus]] on how to identify Autobots from Decepticons in battle using the Ark's computer. Pretender Bumblebee is one of those he displays to the Autobots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=Robert Mann |penciller= |inker= |story=By their Blasters you shall know them...! |title=Transformers Comic-Magazin |volume=1 |issue=12 |date=December 1990 | publisher=[[Condor Verlag]] |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Devil's Due Publishing ====
In [[Devil's Due Publishing|Devil's Due]]'s first ''G.I. Joe vs. The Transformers'' crossover, the evil terrorist organization [[Cobra Command|Cobra]] are the first to uncover the ''Ark'' and the Transformers slumbering within it, capturing and reformatting a large number of them to use them as war machines. Bumblebee and [[Wheeljack]] are able to avoid this fate, contact the team created to respond to the threat of Cobra, G.I. Joe, and help to free their fellow Autobots. Unlike most Autobots, who had new alternate modes, Bumblebee and Wheeljack had their original Generation 1 alternate modes in this series.

In the second crossover, Bumblebee is among the Autobots sent back in time due to an accident with the spacebridge computer Teletran-3. As part of a small group transported to the 1970s, Bumblebee is reformatted as a small economy car (this time, resembling an [[AMC Pacer]]) before the teamed-up Joes and Cobras return all the Transformers to present-day Cybertron.

Bumblebee takes center stage in the third crossover series, as he, Grimlock, [[Arcee]], and [[Perceptor]] are sent to Earth to aid G.I. Joe in removing the influence of Cybertronian technology on the planet. Sporting his original alternate mode again, he is shown to have something of a crush on Arcee. When Cobra attacks the base, the Autobots help repel the Cobra Battle Android Trooper armies. Journeying to Cybertron to stop [[Serpentor]], the mismatched group is ambushed first by Cannibalizers, then by Serpentor, [[Seacons|Piranacon]], [[Predacons|Predaking]] and the [[Stunticon]]s, with Bumblebee being badly injured as he runs right into Predaking's leg. He is then executed by Serpentor, who would later comment that Bumblebee's death is the only thing that ever really made him feel emotion. Despite the character being notoriously difficult to kill, it seems his death is permanent, as Serpentor comments that he felt something leave him, most likely his spark. A statue to his memory was seen in the final issue. His death would continue to have repercussions, as seen in the fourth series, in which Prime insists on journeying to Earth personally rather than expose any of his troops to the same fate.

==== Dreamwave Productions ====
When [[Dreamwave Productions]] introduced their re-imagined version of Generation 1 continuity for the 21st Century, Bumblebee was present for the Autobots' new adventures once again. ''The War Within'', set in Cybertron's past, chronicled Bumblebee's early adventures in the Battle of Altihex and the defense of Iacon in the face of an attack by [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]].

When Optimus Prime and [[Megatron]] vanish in an early spacebridge experiment, causing the Autobots and Decepticons to splinter into smaller factions, Bumblebee remains with the Autobots under [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]'s command.

As usual, Bumblebee is among the Transformers trapped in stasis aboard the crashed ''Ark'' who are reactivated on Earth in 1984. Although not depicted in fiction, the general events of the television series pilot seemed to take place in the Dreamwave continuity - with Bumblebee meeting and befriending [[Witwicky family#Spike Witwicky|Spike Witwicky]].

==== Fun Publications ====
Classic Bumblebee was featured on the cover of ''Transformers Club Magazine'' #14.

In a possible future chronicled in the exclusive comic book available at BotCon 2005, Bumblebee featured as the espionage director of the Autobots. Having been on the trail of the Decepticon agent [[Flamewar (Transformers)|Flamewar]] for a long time, Bumblebee interrupts a communication between Flamewar and the [[Tripredacus Council]] and reveals that his agent, [[Ricochet (Transformers)|Ricochet]], has installed a degenerative virus into [[Deathsaurus]]'s clone army. With Flamewar now exposed, Bumblebee points out that she was nothing more than a liability to the Council, who blow her ship up.

Based on the Transformers Classics toy line, the Timelines 2007 story is set 15 years after the end of the [[Marvel Comics]] story (ignoring all events of the [[Marvel UK]] and ''Generation 2'' comics). Megatron has survived the crash of the ''[[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]]'' on Earth, reformatted himself into a new form, and now leads [[Ramjet (Transformers)|Ramjet]], [[Skywarp]], [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], and the [[Constructicons]]. [[Optimus Prime]] has also returned to Earth commanding Bumblebee, [[Cliffjumper]], [[Grimlock]], [[Jetfire]], [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]], and [[Rodimus]] (formerly [[Rodimus|Hot Rod]]).

In ''Crossing Over'', when the Cybertronians [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] and [[Landquake]] arrive on Earth unexpectedly Megatron attempts to destroy them, but Optimus Prime and his Autobots are able to drive Megatron away.

Bumblebee appears in the story ''[[Generation 2: Redux]]'' in which he is among the reinforcements from [[Autobot City]] to respond to the Decepticon attack at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] in [[Switzerland]]. Once there, the Autobots are able to defeat the Decepticons, but during the fight the Autobots are exposed to refined [[Forestonite]], which enhances and mutates Cybertronian systems.

==== IDW Publishing ====
Fall of 2005 was the third re-launch for [[Transformers (comics)|the ''Transformers'' comic series]], this time under the management of [[IDW Publishing]].

IDW's core universe was introduced with the six-issue mini-series, ''[[The Transformers: Infiltration]]'', making it clear that the company's take on the Generation 1 universe was radically different. Bumblebee appears as a member of a small team of Autobots under the command of [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]], operating in secret on Earth out of ''Ark-19''. Still a Volkswagen Beetle, he (like the other Autobots) possesses the added ability to generate a "holo-matter" avatar of a young female to masquerade as a driver and to otherwise interact with humans. Working with [[Ratchet (Transformers)|Ratchet]] and a trio of young humans to search an abandoned Decepticon base, Bumblebee is able to take down [[Skywarp]] during a Decepticon attack, out-thinking the Decepticon and shooting him out of the sky despite his teleportation system. After [[Blitzwing]] and Skywarp bring the base down, Bumblebee helps save the humans, despite commenting previously that they would be acceptable losses. As Megatron then engages the traitorous Starscream in battle, Bumblebee does what he does best by spying on the fight; almost shot by the [[Lists of Transformers characters|Battlechargers]], he is saved by Prowl and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]]. In the follow-up, ''[[The Transformers: Escalation]]'', he is left to run the ''Ark-19'' on his own.

Bumblebee was among the Autobots who opposed the Decepticons serving the elder gods in the [[IDW Publishing]] ''Infestation 2: Transformers'' comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Joana Lafuente |date=February 2011 |editor=Bobby Curnow |inker=John Wycough |issue=1 |letterer=Chris Mowry |penciller=Guido Guidi |publisher=IDW Publishing |story=|title=Infestation 2: The Transformers |volume=1 |writer=Chuck Dixon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebee appears as one of the main Autobot characters in the live-action ''[[Transformers (film series)|Transformers]]'' film series. He retains some elements from his Generation 1 design, such as the iconic horn-like pieces in his head, which are articulated in the films. The cautious but brave Bumblebee was given a different alternate mode from his original G1 incarnation, instead of a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], he transforms into a rally yellow&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chevrolet.com/pages/open/default/camaro-special-edition.do |title=Chevy Camaro Special Editions &amp;#124; Performance Cars |website=Chevrolet.com |accessdate=November 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chevrolet Camaro]] (the model year of which is upgraded in the first film). Director [[Michael Bay]] states in the special features of disc two of the first film's DVD release, that the change of Bumblebee's alternate mode was due to the fact that a Volkswagen Beetle reminded him of [[Herbie]]. Due to a battle injury, he is rendered effectively mute, and communicates through use of selected playback of radio and television signals. Though his original voice is restored at the end of the first ''Transformers'' film, he communicates solely through his radio in ''Revenge of the Fallen'', ''Dark of the Moon'' and ''Age of Extinction''. The biography for the Decepticon [[Hardtop (Transformers)#Transformers|Hardtop]] figure states that he and Bumblebee are old rivals and it was not [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]] who damaged Bumblebee's vocal processor, but a shot from Hardtop's gun. This, however, is in almost direct opposition of the film's prequel.

Bay stated in an early interview that Bumblebee stands about {{convert|17.5|ft|m|disp=x| tall (|)|2}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latinoreview.com/news.php?id=907 |title=Transformers Set Visit Preview! |website=Latino Review |access-date=8 October 2018 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606165218/http://www.latinoreview.com/news.php?id=907 |archive-date=June 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the official guide to the ''Transformers'' video game says he is {{convert|16|ft|m|disp=x| tall (|)|2}}.

The vehicles used for Bumblebee, [[Ironhide#Transformers|Ironhide]], [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers|Jazz]] and [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers|Ratchet]] were put on display by [[General Motors]] at the 2007 [[Detroit International Riverfront|Detroit River Walk]] Festival a little over a week before the U.S. release of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transformers Movie Update: We Have An Exclusive Robogasm With Ironhide, Bumblebee, Jazz And Ratchet |publisher=Jalopnik |date=June 22, 2007 |url=http://jalopnik.com/cars/robots-in-disguise/transformers-movie-update-we-have-an-exclusive-robogasm-with-ironhide-bumblebee-jazz-and-ratchet-271505.php |accessdate=June 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hot Rod'' magazine's Nov. 2006 issue, Bumblebee was a feature article. Originally a worn-out 1969 Camaro, producers settled on a 1977 model.&lt;ref name="BumblebeeYear"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=121138 |title=Driving the Transformers Beater Bumblebee 1977 Camaro |accessdate=November 22, 2007 |last=Huffman |first=John Pearley |date=June 10, 2007 |website=[[Edmunds.com|Edmunds]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017045359/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId=121138 |archivedate=October 17, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is painted yellow with black stripes, primer and rust patches, riveted hood scoop, [[Cragar]] SS wheels up front, Eric Vaughn Real Wheels in the back, marine-grade vinyl seats, and even an [[8-track tape|eight-track]] player. The Camaro Concept model was built using a 2005 [[Holden Monaro]] by [[Saleen]], with the body built from the same GM R&amp;D molds that were used in the original 2006 Camaro Concept (the Monaro and Camaro share the same Zeta platform). Bumblebee is armed with a plasma cannon that is capable of selective fire. The 1977 Camaro movie vehicle was sold on [[eBay]] with a winning bid of U.S. $40,100.01.

As a tribute to the original form of Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle appears next to him at the car dealership. Bumblebee damages the Beetle in order to ensure that Sam purchases him. He also has a bee-shaped air freshener attached to his rear-view mirror with the words "Bee-otch". The air freshener was the subject of a lawsuit for $850,000 due to its alleged resemblance to another design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gregorian |first1=Dareh |last2=Cohen |first2=Stefanie |title=Giant robots stole my idea |newspaper=[[The New York Post]] |date=December 26, 2007 |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12262007/news/nationalnews/giant_robots_stole_my_idea_473566.htm |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his conversion from 1977 Camaro to 2006 Camaro Concept, Bumblebee's alternate mode continues to evolve throughout the film series. In ''Revenge of the Fallen'', he sports a different set of alloy wheels (apparently, in the first two films are actually hubcaps made from composite to look like a set of wheel-disc brake&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D121044 |title=Driving the Transformers Movie Camaro Concept |website=Edmunds.com |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012041509/http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Features/articleId%3D121044 |archive-date=October 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and a custom front bumper. For ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'' (now a Camaro SS), his color changes from yellow to [[Amber (color)|amber]] with thicker black stripes that run across his hood, roof and trunk. In addition, he will have dark-colored rims and side mirrors, as well as a rear spoiler. Also, in Transformers Dark of the Moon, he has a stealth force battle mode in which he can use his weapons in car mode without fully transforming and still being able to seat a driver and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-movie-just-movie-31/michaelbaycom-updates--more-transformers-3-interviews-images-and-bayhem-170293/ |title=MichaelBay.com Updates: more Transformers 3 Interviews, Images and Bayhem |website=TFW2005.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reception===
''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' named Bumblebee as their fourth-favorite computer-generated character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Our 10 Favorite CG Characters |newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |url=http://ew.com/gallery/our-10-favorite-cg-characters/7 |date=July 17, 2007 |accessdate=April 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IDW Publishing===
In ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'' #1, back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee, and [[Cliffjumper (other incarnations)#Transformers|Cliffjumper]] are tasked to watch over the AllSpark at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, Megatron learns that Optimus has broken into his room and sends Bumblebee, [[Camshaft (Transformers)#Transformers|Camshaft]], Cliffjumper, Jazz, [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers|Prowl]], and [[Smokescreen (Transformers)#Transformers|Smokescreen]] to arrest [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#The Transformers|Optimus Prime]] for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but while en route to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]], [[Brawl (Transformers)#Transformers (film)|Brawl]], [[Crankcase (Transformers)|Crankcase]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)#Transformers|Frenzy]], [[Starscream]], [[Skywarp#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Skywarp]], and [[Thundercracker#Decepticons|Thundercracker]], under orders to kill them all. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4, [[Arcee#Transformers|Arcee]], Bumblebee, Cliffjumper, Jazz, and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots. Arcee and Bumblebee later spy on the building of the Decepticon starship ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Nemesis]]''.

The ''[[Transformers: Movie Prequel]]'' reveals that in the battle of Tyger Pax, Megatron's forces attack, searching for the All Spark. Bumblebee's squad (which includes Arcee) attempts to hold off the Decepticons, but are eventually overwhelmed. They are captured and tortured by [[Swindle (Transformers)#Transformers|Swindle]], with Megatron intervening personally to torture Bumblebee for information. However, they refuse to speak long enough for Prime's secret plan to take effect—launching the AllSpark into outer space. Megatron attempts to pursue it, but Bumblebee stops him. An enraged Megatron rips Bumblebee's arms off and crushes his voice capacitor, promising to seize the AllSpark for himself eventually. Bumblebee recovers and is repaired, although his voice is damaged beyond repair. Bumblebee then volunteers to head into space to stop Megatron from acquiring the All Spark.

Eventually arriving on Mars in his protoform mode, Bumblebee then proceeds to Earth in 2003, his arrival tracked by the [[Hubble Space Telescope]].

Upon landing in [[New York City]], Bumblebee assumes the form of a beat-up Chevrolet Camaro, all the while avoiding the agents of the government organization known as Sector 7, who refer to him as NBE-2 (or Non-Biological Extraterrestrial 2). Bumblebee then downloads information on Captain [[List of The Transformers (TV series) characters|Archibald Witwicky]]. Arriving at the asylum where he had once been incarcerated, he finds it now a dilapidated ruin. Damaged by a pursuing Barricade, he then finds AllSpark-like emissions somewhere in [[New Mexico]]—unaware it is a trap set by Sector 7. However, their plan to capture him is thwarted when Starscream, Barricade and [[Blackout (Transformers)#Transformers|Blackout]] arrive. As the Decepticons shoot Sector 7's trap to pieces, Bumblebee escapes—unaware the Decepticons had let him go so that they could follow him and see what he knew about the All Spark. He is last seen in the series heading for Tranquility, [[Nevada]]—home of Captain Witwicky's descendant Sam.

In the comic adaptation of the film, Bumblebee downloads information on the internet about the Concept Camaro car and took on its form instead of driving past in a tunnel, as seen in the film.

He also appears in the official movie sequel comic called ''The Reign of Starscream''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fromthetip.blogspot.com/2008/04/rain-of-starscream-part-deux.html |title=Rain of Starscream Part Deux |date=April 2008 |website=From the Tip}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'', the Autobots aid the human soldiers after the battle in Mission City, destroying the All Spark-powered machines that were created. After Ratchet finishes repairing Bumblebee's legs, a trailer is obtained for Optimus Prime to carry the remains of Jazz. The Autobots then leave Mission City before the Sector 7 personnel arrive to claim the remains of the Decepticons. About a month later, Epps and Lennox contact Optimus Prime, Ratchet and Ironhide about aiding them in escorting the remains of the Decepticons to the naval yard. Unknowingly they are spied on by Barricade, who transmits the information to Starscream.

Bumblebee appears in ''[[Transformers: Tales of the Fallen]]'' #1, where Barricade kidnaps Sam in order to flush out Bumblebee and learn where the AllSpark fragment is. Bumblebee saves Sam and fights Barricade, who escapes in the process.

Bumblebee appears in ''[[Transformers: Nefarious]]'' #1, set months after the events of the 2009 film. Bumblebee, [[Lists of Transformers characters|Breakaway]], [[Jolt (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Jolt]], Knock Out and [[Lists of Transformers characters|Dune Runner]] are sent to investigate spark fragments detected at Kingdom Petrochemicals. Arriving first, Breakaway is warned by [[Soundwave (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Soundwave]] to leave, but unwilling to give in, the Autobot is swiftly defeated. Bumblebee and his team fire on Soundwave, who escapes.

The drone calling itself [[Brains (Transformers)|Brains]] runs into Bumblebee and Sam Witwicky in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic |writer=John Barber |penciller=Carlos Magno |inker=Aburtov &amp; Graphiksslava |story= |title=Transformers: Rising Storm |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=February 2011 |publisher=IDW Publishing |location= |page= |panel= |id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Titan Magazines===
Note: Events occurring in the alternate universe where Megatron won the battle of Mission City are in ''italics''.

''In "Twilight's Last Gleaming Part 3", Bumblebee attempts to take on Megatron in the Sector 7 base. Meanwhile, Mikaela attempts to free Optimus Prime, but she is attacked by Frenzy.''

''Bumblebee appears in issue #17 of the Titan Transformers Magazine, in a story called "Return to Cybertron Part 1". In this story, he is among the Autobots that go to Cybertron.''

''Bumblebee returns in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called "The Decepticon who Haunted Himself."''

===Books===
Bumblebee also appears in the prequel novel ''[[Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday]]''. Here, it is revealed he could still communicate with the other Autobots via digital link. Bumblebee is part of Prime's Autobot team searching for the All Spark, and is described as one of the Autobots' best scouts. He is sent after the human vessel ''Ghost-1'' (reverse-engineered from studies of Megatron) to make contact, but is ambushed and forced underground by Starscream. Encountering giant rock-chewing worms, he is saved by Optimus Prime. Heading into the atmosphere once again, he and Ratchet took on Barricade, but are unable to stop Starscream from destroying the human vessel.

===Target Robo-Vision===
According to his extended biography from the [[Target Corporation|Target store]]-exclusive Robo-Vision web site, Hardtop came to Earth and discovered the Witwicky home before any of the other Decepticons, but was unable to attack the Witwickys because Bumblebee found him first and buried him under a hundred tons of rubble in the [[Rocky Mountains]].

===Live action films===

Sam possesses the glasses of his great-great-grandfather Captain Archibald Witwicky, a famous explorer. Unknown to Sam, the glasses are engraved with the coordinates showing the location of the life-giving All Spark. Bumblebee is assigned to guard Sam from the Decepticons, and poses as a dilapidated 1977 Chevrolet Camaro as Sam and his father are buying a car for Sam. They eventually purchase Bumblebee, due in no small part to Bumblebee damaging every other car at the dealership to ensure his purchase. Later, Bumblebee drives away from Sam's home to summon the Autobots. Sam thinks Bumblebee is being stolen, and chases the car on his bike. Sam then witnesses Bumblebee transforming into robot mode and reports it to the police, who believe he is on drugs.

When Mikaela criticizes the poor condition of Bumblebee's vehicle mode, he scans a passing Camaro Concept and transforms into the same model.

They return to Sam's house and retrieve the glasses, but a secret government organization, Sector 7, arrests Sam and Mikaela. The Autobots attempt to rescue them but Bumblebee is captured and taken by Sector 7. There he is tested/tortured by the Sector 7 scientists using electric shocks that appear to hurt him. Sam eventually negotiates his release. Bumblebee survives the massive battle at the film's climax, although he loses the use of his legs after helping Ironhide deflect missiles from Starscream. With Mikaela's aid, he is able to rejoin the battle supported by a tow truck (later confirmed to be the Autobot [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers|Longarm]]), and destroys [[Brawl (Transformers)#Transformers (film)|Brawl]]. After the battle, Bumblebee is fully repaired and asks to stay with Sam and is granted permission from both Sam and Optimus Prime. He is later seen alongside Ironhide, Ratchet, and Optimus watching the sunset while Sam and Mikaela recline on his hood at the end of the movie.

Bumblebee is voiced by [[Mark Ryan (actor)|Mark Ryan]] in the films, but he mostly speaks with his radio, having had his voice processor damaged (though his actual voice squeaks and whines laboriously through much of the movie). He also speaks with quotes from television shows and movies, in a way similar to [[Wreck-Gar]] from the 1986 film and season three of the G1 cartoon series. Screenwriter [[Roberto Orci]] explained Bumblebee regained his voice through the regenerative laser Ratchet fires at his neck as they meet, and it eventually works its magic by the end of the film. He agreed this was not made clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Roberto Orci]]|title=Orci and Kurtzman Questions: Post movie|publisher=Official site|date=July 6, 2007 |url=http://boards.transformersmovie.com/showpost.php?p=384946&amp;postcount=33 |accessdate=September 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928015848/http://boards.transformersmovie.com/showpost.php?p=384946&amp;postcount=33 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frenzy is regenerated upon coming into contact with the All Spark, and so it is entirely plausible that Bumblebee's voice, along with his legs, is also healed by the AllSpark, though no mention of this is made in the film. It was said that making Bumblebee mute was to show that his bond with Sam went beyond words.

Bumblebee also appears in the film's sequel, ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''. When a fragment of the AllSpark inadvertently turns the kitchen appliances in Sam's home into feral robots, Bumblebee intervenes to save him and his family. In doing so, he nearly destroys their house. He still uses his radio to speak, despite his vocal processors being repaired in the first film. However, he does respond half-way when Sam tells him to get in the garage by saying "whatever." Bumblebee shows excitement at the thought of going with Sam to college, only to be disappointed later when Sam tells him that he can not come. Because of the incident at the Witwickys' he is also forced to leave their garage. Soon after Sam begins his semester at college, Bumblebee follows him and tries to alert him to the Decepticon [[Pretenders (Transformers)|Pretender]] (named [[Alice (Transformers)|Alice]]) that is following Sam. As both Sam and Alice are riding inside Bumblebee, the Autobot attempts to warn Sam through his radio. Having failed at this, Bumblebee intentionally brakes hard multiple times and throws Alice around the interior in an attempt to damage the Pretender. Bumblebee then proceeds to spray [[lubricant]] over Alice, thereby embarrassing Sam and forcing Alice to flee.

Soon after Megatron and [[Scalpel (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Scalpel]] begin to torture Sam, Bumblebee arrives alongside Optimus Prime to fight Megatron, Starscream and [[Grindor#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Grindor]]. After Optimus dies, Bumblebee arrives with [[Sideswipe (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Sideswipe]], Ironhide and Ratchet to cover Sam's escape. As they mourn for Optimus, Sam tells Bumblebee that he has failed the Autobots, but Bumblebee tells Sam through his radio, ... "You are the person I care for most in my life, and if there is anything you need I won't be far away..." After taking Sam, Mikaela, Leo and Simmons to the [[Smithsonian]] museum to reawaken [[Jetfire#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Jetfire]], Bumblebee then travels with the humans through a Space Bridge to Egypt (caused by Jetfire) along with Jetfire, the Twins [[Skids (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Skids]] and [[Mudflap (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Mudflap]], and [[Lists of Transformers characters|Wheelie]] to find the [[Matrix of Leadership]]. While the twins have a sibling argument (resulting in a fist fight) inside the ruins of [[Petra]] (which supposedly houses the Matrix when everyone thinks it is a dead end), Bumblebee breaks them up and tosses them out before seeing their fight. But once seeing the Tomb's entrance after the Twins' brawl reveals it, Bumblebee helps the humans enter it by blasting the rest of the wall off.

During the final confrontational battle, Sam and Mikaela inadvertently spring a trap set by [[Rampage (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Rampage]] (who uses Sam's parents as the bait). Bumblebee stays hidden from Rampage's sight, allowing Sam to put Rampage in a spot where Bumblebee can initiate a surprise attack. During the subsequent fight [[Ravage (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Ravage]] attacks him from behind and jumps on his back. After a brief struggle, Bumblebee gets a hold of Ravage and literally tears him apart with his hands, allowing him to finish off and kill Rampage. With Sam's parents free, Sam tells Bumblebee to take care of them, thus removing him from most of the final fight. After Sam is killed by Megatron, Bumblebee arrives with Sam's parents and sees Sam's body on the ground, he is heartbroken, overcome with sadness and stricken with sorrow, believing that he has failed in his duty to protect Sam, but is overjoyed to see him return. Bumblebee is among the remaining Autobots at the end of the film.

In ''[[Transformers: Dark of the Moon]]'', Bumblebee no longer lives with Sam and goes on other missions with the Autobots such as dismantling an illegal nuclear facility in the Middle East. This is the first time the stealth force upgrade is shown in the movie. When Sam arrives with Carly, Wheelie and Brains, Bumblebee saves them from the soldiers taking them captive. Bumblebee is reassigned to protect Sam and moves back in with him. Bumblebee later teams up with Sideswipe and Dino/Mirage to take out Hatchet. While Dino/Mirage clings on to hatchet with his grapplers, Bumblebee and Sideswipe shoot their stealth force weapons. While trying to protect Sentinel Prime, Bumblebee and the other Autobots are betrayed and attacked by him. Sentinel brutally kills Ironhide, but Bumblebee manages to escape. After Sentinel forces the Autobots' exile from Earth, Bumblebee sadly says goodbye to Sam, but reunites with him in Chicago where he helps him rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak. After Sam kills Starscream, Bumblebee saves him and Lennox from a great fall. Bumblebee is captured by Soundwave and is nearly executed in front of Sam (telling Sam "We gave them a hell of a run") after Barricade executes Que before Wheelie and Brains save him at the cost of their own lives, allowing him to break free and attack Soundwave. Bumblebee battles Soundwave while the other Autobots fight the other Decepticons and proves more than a match for the Decepticon spy-master, even managing to kill another Decepticon during the fight. Finally Bumblebee knocks Soundwave off-balance with a shot to the leg, knocks his sonic cannon from his hand and uppercuts his plasma cannon into his chest, firing at the same time, destroying Soundwave's head and killing him. Bumblebee fights Sentinel alongside the other Autobots and humans; he is no match for him, but avoids injury. After Sam kills [[Dylan Gould]], Bumblebee destroys the Control Pillar by crashing through it, shutting off the Space Bridge and destroying Cybertron and the remaining Decepticons. Bumblebee survives the battle and gives Sam a bunch of gaskets to use as rings while playing wedding music after Sam and Carly admit they love each other. Though Sam says to Bumblebee that he's thinking too fast. He replies by 'saying', "I'm just trying to help out." Ratchet compliments Bumblebee for his bravery.

Bumblebee returns in ''[[Transformers: Age of Extinction]]''. He has a new vehicle mode, a modified 1976 Chevrolet Camaro, before he scans a yellow 2014 Camaro and turns into a 2014 Chevrolet Camaro concept, because of this his robot mode has been changed as well and resembles one design of Bumblebee from the Generation 1 IDW comics. In the end of ''Age of Extinction'', Bumblebee assumed the Autobot leadership and protecting the Yeager family as Optimus blasts off to space along with the Seed, finding the mysterious Creators. Though Bumblebee mostly can't speak in the film and still relies on radio communication, he is shown to be able to express limited speech but in a more high-pitched voice, possibly meaning his voice box is healing.

Bumblebee returns in ''[[Transformers: The Last Knight]]'', and is scheduled to appear in his [[Bumblebee (film)|spin-off film]]. In the former, he now displays the ability to separate and reassemble himself during combat, as shown when he battles the TRF soldiers in order to protect Cade. He is also revealed to have helped the [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Force]] to fight the [[Nazi Party]] during [[World War II]], and transformed into a [[Mercedes-Benz 770]]. He also regained his voice during his battle with Optimus Prime.

The upcoming film ''[[Bumblebee (film)|Bumblebee]]'' will explore Bumblebee's past, taking place in 1987 where he takes form of a [[Volkswagen Beetle]], a reference to his classic portrayal in G1. On scouting mission tasked by [[Optimus Prime]] but traumatized by his prior experiences, the film will focus on his growing friendship with a teenage girl named Charlie Watson, in addition to evading [[Sector 7]] and going against Decepticon operatives [[Blitzwing]], Shatter, and Dropkick.

===Cyber Missions===
In [[Transformers: Cyber Missions|Cyber Missions]] 1, Bumblebee and Ironhide are protecting NEST Command when two Decepticons, Soundwave and [[Bludgeon (Transformers)#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Bludgeon]] invade the area. Ironhide goes outside to deal with Bludgeon, while Soundwave ambushes Bumblebee from inside. Bumblebee is easily thrown down by Soundwave. Bumblebee tries to fire a shot from his shoulder gun, but Soundwave redirects the acoustic energy back at him. Bumblebee deduces that he cannot deflect several rounds at once, and begins rapidly firing at Soundwave. The Decepticon is not able to take in so much, and finally falls. Later, Bumblebee traps Soundwave in a magnetically sealed bubble in ''Cyber Missions 2''.

===Video games===
Bumblebee is a playable character, and is the most-used character in the Autobot campaign, where the character uses Bumblebee in nine missions in the Autobot campaign, out of the total 18.

Bumblebee appears in the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' series in 2008 as a yellow [[hot hatch]] undercover police car (scanned from a vehicle driven by Detroit Police Captain Fanzone). The character of Bumblebee in ''Animated'' is described as a hot headed racing young Autobot who likes video games, making him more akin to ''Armada'' [[Hot Shot (Transformers)#Transformers: Armada|Hot Shot]] than the original Bumblebee. He does however retain the traditional warm-heartedness and human-friendly attitude of the original due to his friendship with [[List of Transformers: Animated characters|Sari Sumdac]] and [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bulkhead]]. Although considered childish and self-centered by many of his fellow Autobots, Bumblebee shows a loyal and caring side for his friends, and can be considered protective of Sari Sumdac, to the extent of blocking shots, blasts, and missiles from harming her. This was first shown in "Transform and Roll Out! Part 3" when he deflected a shot from Starscream that was aimed at Sari. The blast rendered him unconscious until Sari healed him with her Key. He is the kid-friendly character of the show.&lt;ref&gt;TV Review: Robots in disguise come back from '80s obscurity, January 7, 2008, [[UWIRE|University Wire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumblebee has a retractable face plate he uses when he goes into combat and a retractable weapon (called "energy stingers") in both hands. He can use the wheels on his feet in robot mode as motorized roller blades.

In the Japanese translation of ''Transformers Animated'', the story has been changed to make it a prequel to the 2007 ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' live-action film. This makes this version of Bumblebee an earlier version of the film character.

=== Animated series ===
In the episode "Autoboot Camp", Bumblebee has flashbacks to his days as an Autobot trainee. During training, he met Bulkhead, [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Longarm]], [[Ironhide#Transformers Animated|Ironhide]], and [[Thrust (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Wasp]]. The group was under the command of Drill Sergeant [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Minor]], who gave Bumblebee his name (after calling him a "bumbler"). Bumblebee would often say or do the wrong thing, resulting in the entire platoon receiving Transformation push-ups as a result, which made him unpopular with Wasp and Ironhide. One day, Bumblebee heard someone communicating with Megatron. Believing the traitor to be Wasp, Bumblebee (with help from Longarm) discovered evidence in Wasp's locker. For discovering the traitor, Sentinel was prepared to give Bumblebee Elite Guard membership. However, Bumblebee gave up that chance by taking the rap for Bulkhead, who had previously knocked a building onto Sentinel, and was about to be removed from training, joining his new friend as a Space Bridge technician. Bulkhead and Bumblebee were assigned to a Space Bridge repair ship under the command of [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]], along with [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Ratchet]]. Both he and Bulkhead were the first to encounter [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Prowl]] before he joins their group.

In the series finale, during a rescue mission to save Arcee, who was on the moon, Bumblebee manages to settle the score with Shockwave before he and Bulkhead put him under arrest. After the Autobots learn of Prowl's ultimate sacrifice, they take the sparkless body of Prowl and the captured Megatron, Lugnut, and Shockwave to Cybertron. On their arrival home, they are greeted and cheered on by the other Autobots for their victory over the evil and malevolent leader of the Decepticons.

=== Fun Publications ===
Bumblebee appeared in the 2008 BotCon voice actor play ''Bee in the City'', voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]. In this story Professor Sumdac attempted to create a teleportation system to get the Autobots to Cybertron, but an interaction with Sari's key ended up transporting Optimus Prime, Bumblebee and Sari to Transtech Cybertron, where they met [[Flareup (Transformers)|Flareup]] and his friends were detained by Shockwave while he was deemed not a threat. Bumblebee teamed up with transformer named "[[Megatron (Beast Era)|Joe]]" to help him and Flareup get their friends. But after Joe exposed himself as a Megatron and uses Sari's key to create an army to begin a reign of terror, Bumblebee pointed out the world's bureaucratic nature that resulted in a mutiny. Afterwards the Autobots and Sari returned to their own dimension.

===IDW Publishing===
Set shortly after the events of "Total Meltdown" is the ''Transformers: Animated'' comic issue #2 by [[IDW Publishing]]. In it, Bumblebee and Prowl apprehend the [[Angry Archer]] as the villain attempts to steal money from a used car salesman. In doing so, they reveal the holographic trickery of the Detroit superhero known as [[The Wraith (Transformers)|The Wraith]]. With the secret of his power revealed, The Wraith loses much of the respect he used to command in Detroit. The Wraith attempts to stop [[Cyrus "The Colossus" Rhodes]] from escaping prison, but is unable to fool the villain now that the secret is public, forcing the Autobots to stop Rhodes and making The Wraith look foolish. The Wraith then attempts to discredit Bumblebee at a college football game by trapping the Autobot with a car boot and using his holograms to make a fake Bumblebee attack the stadium. Bumblebee eventually escapes and the other Autobots help capture The Wraith before having him placed in a mental institution.

In the ''Transformers: Timelines'' series, Goldbug is an evil alternate reality version of Bumblebee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfw2005.com/resources/convention-exclusives-246/goldbug-1621/ |title=Goldbug |website=TFW2005.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his official biography, Goldbug was once a young drifter known as Bumblebee. He survived on the streets of Polyhex with no real purpose. He became skilled at sneaking around, stealing, eavesdropping and blackmailing. He eagerly joined the Autobots in hopes of finding a place to belong and where his unsavory activities would be tolerated. When the war began, Bumblebee showed extreme bravery in battle and often sought ways to be noticed by command. In time, he worked his way up the ranks of the Autobots and when the Autobot Seeker [[Drench (Transformers)|Drench]] was destroyed, Bumblebee was offered an upgraded form and a new identity as Goldbug, to take his place.

Goldbug is paranoid that one of his fellow Autobots will betray him and try to take his place, as he did to his former superiors.

Bumblebee is one of the main group of Autobots in the 2010 computer-animated series ''[[Transformers: Prime]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tfw2005.com/transformers-news/transformers-prime-39/botcon-2010-transformers-prime-panel-coverage-170054/ |title=BotCon 2010 'Transformers: Prime' Panel Coverage |website=TFW2005.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bumblebee is younger than most of the Autobots, and lost his voice box thanks to Megatron during the Great War. Bumblebee remains more playful than the other Autobots despite his lack of voice, and has come to rely on his speed as his most valuable asset in battle. Bumblebee is extremely similar to his movie counterpart, sharing the similar vehicle and robot forms, the same lack of voice, and his close relationship to a human boy. It is also revealed in the series finale episode "Deadlock" that Bumblebee's mouth was covered by a face plate vaguely resembling that of Optimus Prime's that helped him to create the alternative beeping noises he uses as his main form of communication throughout the series. Later in the series he changes his color scheme by reversing the colors, resembling Bumblebee's original 1976 paint scheme in the 2014 ''Age of Extinction'' film.

Bumblebee returns as the central character of the sequel series ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', with [[Will Friedle]] reprising his role. Set five years after the events of ''Prime'', Bumblebee becomes the leader of a group of Autobots and they return to Earth to fight a new generation of Decepticons, when the re-emerge on the planet after a prison ship crash. A constant running gag throughout the first season is Bumblebee's inability to come up with a decent command for his team to mobilize, in the vein of Optimus Prime's famous order to "roll out". Bumblebee retains a similar vehicle mode as he did in ''Prime'', now a [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|1992 Chevrolet Camaro]] (And in the films Bumblebee is a Camaro) however, his robot mode has gone through a serious redesign. Notably retaking his original primarily yellow color scheme rather than the dominantly black one he took at the end of ''Prime''.

===Books===
Bumblebee appears in the novels ''Transformers: Exodus'' and ''[[Transformers: Exiles]]''.

Bumblebee losing his voice was the focus of the short story "Bumblebee at Tyger Pax" By [[Alex Irvine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://moviesblog.mtv.com/2010/06/22/exclusive-learn-how-bumblebee-lost-his-voice-in-this-short-story-from-exodus-author-alex-irvine/ |title=Learn How Bumblebee Lost His Voice in This Short Story from 'Exodus' author Alex Irvine |date=June 22, 2010 |website=MTV.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Video games===
Bumblebee appears as a playable character in the 2010 video game ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]''. In the Autobot campaign, he is first seen racing across the war-torn streets of Iacon in search of [[Optimus Prime#Transformers: Prime|Optimus]]. Upon rendezvousing with Optimus, he relays the message of Zeta Prime's death at the hands of [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]]; after which, he joins Optimus and [[Ratchet (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Ratchet]] in their resistance against the Decepticons on the planet. He later appears in the final level of the game, where Bumblebee teams up with Optimus and [[Ironhide (Transformers)|Ironhide]] to prevent the Decepticon Titan, [[Trypticon (Transformers)|Trypticon]] from destroying Iacon.

In ''[[Transformers: Fall of Cybertron]]'', the sequel to ''War for Cybertron'', players start as Bumblebee in the first level. He appears throughout the game as well.

===Animated series===
With the exception of Optimus Prime, Bumblebee is the only character to appear in all three TV shows set within the Aligned Continuity, including ''[[Transformers: Rescue Bots]]'' and ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]''. [[Frank Welker]] recorded actual words written for Bumblebee which were later replaced with sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;Revealed in "The Autobits Edition" of Darkmount, NV.&lt;/ref&gt; When Bumblebee regains his voice, it's provided by actor, [[Will Friedle]].

====''Transformers: Prime''====
Bumblebee appears in the pilot episode of the series responding too late to a call for help from Cliffjumper, who is captured by the Decepticons and killed. Bumblebee soon is assigned to be Raf Esquivel's guardian, having grown close to the boy as he understands his language of beeps.&lt;ref&gt;''Transformers: Prime'' episode 1, "Darkness Rising - Part 1"&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Operation: Bumblebee" two-parter, Bumblebee lost his transformation cog and its ability to have him transform before eventually retrieving the cog from human terrorist group M.E.C.H. and Starscream.

Bumblebee's goal in the series is to be promoted to warrior class, as he first states in "Masters &amp; Students", however, Optimus does not believe him to be worthy of promotion at such a young age. Nevertheless, Bumblebee shows he is still a capable warrior, since he is able to fight the likes of Breakdown and Shockwave. When questioned by Smokescreen in "Project Predacon", Bumblebee admits he is holding back so that he can one day be promoted to warrior class on Cybertron.

In "Deadlock", during the final battle aboard the ''Nemesis'', Bumblebee tries to give Optimus Prime the [[Star Saber]] for him to fight Megatron, but is killed by the Decepticon. However, Bumblebee fell into the ship's Omega Lock and exposure to the Synthetic Energon powering it both revived him and restored his voice. As Megatron prepared to finish Optimus, Bumblebee used the Star Saber to stab him in his spark, killing him. Afterwards, once the Omega Lock restored Cybertron, Bumblebee gives Raf a goodbye before leaving for his home world where he is finally promoted to warrior class during the series finale ''Predacons Rising''. However, things quickly turn for the worse when Unicron appears on Cybertron in Megatron's body, and two new Predacons are cloned by Shockwave. With Optimus on a mission to retrieve the AllSpark, and Ultra Magnus having been severely wounded by the new Predacons, Bumblebee becomes Autobot leader at Ratchet's encouragement as he leads them, the newly defected Knock Out and the three Predacons in making a stand against Unicron's undead Predacon army at the Well of All Sparks, buying enough time for Optimus to return to defeat Unicron. Optimus reveals that he must sacrifice himself to restore the AllSpark to Cybertron's core, and does not pass on leadership to any one person present, stating that leadership will now be earned through actions. Bumblebee promises to keep the peace on Cybertron to Optimus, implying Bumblebee to be the new leader of the Autobots, and by extension, Cybertron's new age.

Bumblebee appears as the main character of the sequel series ''[[Transformers: Robots in Disguise (2015 TV series)|Transformers: Robots in Disguise]]'', with [[Will Friedle]] reprising his role. In the series, Bumblebee is called to Earth when a new generation of Decepticons re-emerges on the planet. After receiving a vision from Optimus Prime, Bumblebee travels to Earth via a spacebridge and discovers that a ship full of Decepticon criminals has crashed on Earth and its inmates have escaped. Initially believing that Optimus' mission is intended for him alone, Bumblebee ends up with a team of ragtag Autobots, including a rebel bad boy bot named [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]], a hyper active Mini-Con named Fixit, the bombastic ex-Decepticon and Dinobot [[Grimlock]], and an Elite Guard female cadet named Strongarm, in order to combat the Decepticons. After befriending humans Denny and his son Russell and fighting the Chompazoid Underbite, the group is greeted by the inexplicably corporeal Optimus. Unable to explain his return, Optimus expresses his confidence in Bumblebee and his new team before departing.

While leading the team, to recapture the escaped Decipticons, they come across Steeljaw, an escaped convict who has his own plan to lead the other escaped convicts. The Autobots would later receive a visit from Bumblebee's old comrade [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]], who informed Bumblebee that his actions in departing Cybertron had angered the high council. After helping apprehend a fugitive named Ped, Jazz volunteered to return to Cybertron and inform the council of what had taken place. The team then received another group of Cybertronian visitors, in the form of Autobot bounty hunter Drift, Decepticon bounty hunter Fracture, and their Mini-Con teammates. Both Cybertronians arrived to collect a bounty placed on Bumblebee by the High Council for his actions, but Drift was convinced of Bumblebee's nobility after Bee saved his life. The team managed to defeat Fracture, and though his ship was lost they gained the use of his ground bridge.

After all of them but Grimlock and Fixit were given Decepticon Hunters, Bee and his team would then be forced to deal with Steeljaw's gang again—now including Thunderhoof, Underbite, and Fracture and his Mini-Cons—as both pursued the Decepticon fugitive Clampdown. Bee's team managed to capture all the Decepticons, but were forced to let them escape when Steeljaw broke free and set an unmanned garbage barge loose in the path of a riverboat.

Drift and his Mini-Cons would later return to Earth and subsequently join the team. The team continued to capture escaped convicts. Bumblebee was once again contacted by Optimus with further warnings, shortly before Steeljaw and his pack managed to briefly seize the scrapyard; however, the Autobots managed to recover their base. The team soon gained another new ally in the form of the Primus-chosen female Autobot warrior Windblade, who aided the team in securing the fugitives Razorpaw and Zizza before departing.

Unfortunately for Bumblebee and his team, the threat that Optimus had warned them of soon revealed itself as [[Megatronus]], a disgraced member of the [[Thirteen (Transformers)|Thirteen]]. Having struck a deal with Steeljaw's pack, Megatronus instructed them to construct several devices he needed, which they did after capturing Strongarm, Sideswipe, and the returning Windblade. Bumblebee led the remainder of his team against them, only for Optimus arrive shortly before Megatronus made his appearance. Deferring to his former commander, Bumblebee became more concerned with Optimus' well-being and leadership than trusting in his own previous experiences. Fortunately, his team rallied behind him and gave him the courage to stand firm, which enabled them to capture Steeljaw's Pack after the would-be Decepticon tyrant was ejected from the battle by Megatronus. The Autobots then fought to prevent Megatronus from destroying both Earth and Cybertron, and managed it after discovering the latent powers of Bumblebee, Sideswipe, and Strongarm's Decepticon Hunters used in tandem and copying the sword form of Optimus' Prime Decepticon Hunter. With Megatronus defeated and possibly eliminated, the Autobots departed for home, with Bumblebee at last finding his rallying cry: "Rev up and roll out!"

With Megatronus defeated and most of the Pack apprehended, Bumblebee questioned whether his fellow Autobots wished to remain with him on Earth. To a one they agreed, with Windblade and Optimus formally joining the team, though Optimus did so as Bumblebee's equal rather than his superior. Turning their attention to Decepticon fugitives still scattered around the globe, Bumblebee decided to split his team by dispatching Drift, his Mini-Cons, and Windblade to seek out Decepticons in other locations while the rest of the team remained at the scrapyard. At their own insistence Optimus and Sideswipe joined the team, which ended up stranded in the Arctic after Optimus' altered state damaged their [[Spacebridge|Groundbridge]]. Unfortunately, the remainder of the team soon had to deal with another problem: [[Overload (Transformers)|Overload]], a Decepticon who had previously infiltrated the Autobot ranks and caused Bumblebee to suffer serious injuries, greatly embittering the former scout.

Bumblebee became consumed with bringing Overload in, even after the Mini-Con fugitives Backtrack and Ransack were freed during their initial battle; the two Mini-Cons subsequently joined forces with Overloard.

====''Transformers: Rescue Bots''====
Bumblebee appears in the episode "Bumblebee to the Rescue", where he helps the Rescue Bots and their human partners investigate a fallen meteor. [[Optimus Prime]] briefly assigns Bumblebee to observe how the Rescue Bots and the Burns family work together. Cody and the rest of the Burns family are unable to understand Bumblebee and requires one of the Rescue Bots to translate. The Rescue Bot Blades also happens to be a big fan of Bumblebee (who is said to be a legendary scout and war hero by the Rescue Bots). When Heatwave, Boulder, and Chase are infected by a substance contained in the meteor, Bumblebee, Blades, and the Burns family work together to destroy the meteor and obtain a sample in a hope to find a cure. Bumblebee and Blades successfully destroy the meteor and retrieve the sample, but at the cost of being infected as well, but thankfully the Burnses use an analysis of the meteor sample Bumblebee found, They are able to find a cure in the Autobots database, curing Bumblebee and the Rescue Bots. At the end of the episode, Cody is revealed to have learned how to understand Bumblebee. Before leaving, Bumblebee asks the Burnses (with Cody acting as interpreter) if they can take a picture of him and Blades.

Bumblebee returns with Optimus Prime in "It's a Bot Time" and "Bots to the Future", where they go back in time to save the Rescue Bots from Dr. Morocco. They return to an alternate present with Dr. Morocco ruling Griffin Rock. They fight Morbots, while the Rescue Bots go into the city. They find out they left Dilther behind, which is how the Morbot army exists. They go back in time to take him back to the present, which is then changed back to the regular timeline. Bumblebee later returned in "Odd Bot Out", where he was sent to search for a missing Cybertronian artifact on Griffin Rock while Optimus searched the nearby seafloor. To the dismay of his biggest fan Blades, Bumblebee teamed up with Dani, who was temporarily unable to pilot Blades due to her pilot's license expiring.

'''Cage Contender''' is a [[Europe]]an [[mixed martial arts]] promotion owned and operated by [[Belfast]] based Ferguson Sports Group LTD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joe.ie/sports/mma/mma-league-enters-a-new-era-with-cage-contender/|title=MMA League enters a new era with "Cage Contender"|work=JOE.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/contender-iv-cage-fighting-extravaganza-comes-to-belfast-28532230.html|title=Contender IV : Cage fighting extravaganza comes to Belfast|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The creation of Irish sports promoter John Ferguson, Cage Contender began as a knockout style tournament to be fought at a weight of 70–80&amp;nbsp;kg in The Cricket Club, Downpatrick, County Down, Northern Ireland. The six men were drawn by way of raffle to make up three first-round fights. The winners of these three fights progressed to the next round along with one of the losers who would be granted a golden ticket again by way of raffle. The winners of the two second-round fights would progress to the final and a winner crowned.

The fight card was made up of a mix of amateur undercard fights and the professional six-man tournament which was the main event. The main event was won by English fighter Aaron Lambourne who returned via the golden ticket system following a first-round loss after a battle with local man Mervyn Mullholland.

From the outset of the Cage Contender project Ferguson stated that he would first achieve a broadcast deal then go on to become the Irish market leader. Many{{Who|date=December 2015}} thought that this was nonsense given that he had no experience within either the television or MMA industries. The first part of his claim became reality at Cage Contender 4 in May 2010 when Cage Contender was broadcast for the first time in Ireland and the UK.

Its status as Irish market leader was confirmed on 24 July 2010 when Cage Contender 5 became the biggest non UFC event ever in Ireland being broadcast in 56 countries while 3500 fans packed Dublin's National Basketball Arena to witness the biggest Bantamweight fight in European MMA history between Paul McVeigh and Artemij Sitenkov.

On 28 August 2010 Cage Contender had its first event outside Ireland when welterweights [[Gunnar Nelson (fighter)|Gunnar Nelson]] and Danny Mitchell headlined Cage Contender 6 at the Altrincham Leisure Centre in Manchester, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherdog.com/news/news/Weekend-Rundown-Nelson-Marshall-Imanari-Victorious-26647 Weekend Rundown: Nelson, Marshall, Imanari Victorious]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gunnar Nelson also headlined Cage Contender 12 against Alexander Butenko on 25 February 2012 at Dublins' National Basketball Arena. The fight made a milestone in Nelson's native country of Iceland as it was the first ever MMA event to be shown live on Icelandic television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Nordic-Warming-Trend-41671 Nordic Warming Trend]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nordic fans got to see Nelson submit Butenko in the first round and few months later sign a deal with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mmaviking.com/exclusive-gunnar-nelson-signs-ufc-contract/ Exclusive : Gunnar Nelson Signs UFC Contract]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cage Contender was the first MMA promotion in Europe where fans were able to bet on the outcome of the fights in a historic team-up with Irish bookmaking chain Boyle Sports. This historic event led the way to more mainstream betting on MMA promotions in Europe.

Cage Contender features a mix of Irish talent combined with many UFC veterans to give wider commercial appeal.

In December 2012 Cage Contender returned to its tournament-style roots with the £10,000 Cage Contender Fight Stars event in Liverpool, England. This tournament was won by [[The Ultimate Fighter]] veteran and former [[Royal Marine Commando]] Martin Stapleton.

2013 saw Cage Contender sign international fighter Paul Daley to compete at Cage Contender 16 in Dublin, Ireland. Daley faced Frenchman Patrick Vallee and finished the fight by flying knee in the second round.

==Gameplay==
{{expand section|date=February 2015}}

==Plot==
Alicia and Greg set off with their friends one Halloween night to look for a house in the forest where they could stock up on goodies. Upon reaching the house, Greg and Alicia's friends are turned into stone by a bogeyman. To save their friends, the two heroes must enter the world of the dead. In order to find their friends and set them free, they need to make it through cemeteries, haunted houses and sinister laboratories. Only one person at a time is allowed to enter the world of the dead, so Alicia and Greg must take turns in order to make their way through the danger that awaits them. Friends like the Goblin and Jack O'Lantern will teach them magic tricks that will help them to overcome obstacles along the way. They must find the Mad Scientist's laboratory to get their friends home safe and sound.

==Characters==
*Alicia - a redheaded, blue-eyed little girl, dressed up as a witch for Halloween. She might seem quiet and polite at first, but she can be very mischievous and dynamic. She has got quite a personality.
*Greg - a rather hard-headed boy. He is dressed as a devil for Halloween. He hates school, authority and anything that is not playing with his friends. He is quite wild and rowdy and he tends to break everything in his path - this kid is a little monster.

==Reception==
The game received average reviews. IGN gave it a 5.0 out of 10 saying that it was cute and simple but had some technical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2003/10/14/spirits-spells?page=2|title=Spirits &amp; Spells|date=2003-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chariot''''' is a co-op [[platform game]] for the [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox One]], [[Wii U]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] developed and published by [[Frima Studio]], with the participation of the [[Canada Media Fund]]. It was first released on September 30, 2014 and was launched on Xbox One the next day as part of the Xbox Live Games with Gold program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://news.xbox.com/2014/09/games-gwg-chariot-battlefield |title=Two Classics Back Up Chariot in October's Games with Gold |publisher=News.xbox.com |date=2014-09-25 |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; An enhanced port entitled '''''Super Chariot''''' was released for the [[Nintendo Switch]] on May 10, 2018, and will include the Royal Gadget Pack DLC.&lt;ref name="NL cites Switch release"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Vogel |first1=Mitch |title=Super Chariot Arrives On The Switch Later This Year |url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/01/super_chariot_arrives_on_the_switch_later_this_year |work=[[Nintendo Life]] |date=16 January 2018 |accessdate=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chariot'' differs from most traditional [[Platform game]] as the objective is to lug around an object, the Chariot, to the end of each level. To do so, the players have to use physics-based mechanics such as pushing and pulling, adding a layer of [[Puzzle video game|Puzzle]] to the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chariotgame.com/faq/ |title=FAQ : Chariot |publisher=Chariot Game |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
''Chariot'' chronicles a princess' quest to fulfill her recently deceased father's final wishes and bury him in peace. As might be expected of royalty, his last request is that he be laid to rest with as much wealth as possible.&lt;ref name="destructoid1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/review-chariot-281861.phtml |title=Review: Chariot |publisher=Destructoid.com |date= |accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The entire game can be played solo or with a partner. The king's body is in a coffin and attached to it are four wheels. The player's character can push the chariot up and down small hills or attach a rope to pull it along. The rope can be extended or shortened to adequately maneuver the chariot throughout the environment. Everything behaves as it should, with real physics playing a big part in how things move.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaming-age.com/2015/01/chariot-review-wii-u/|title=Chariot review for Wii U|publisher=Gaminga-age.com|accessdate=2015-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On [[Metacritic]], ''Chariot'' scores an average metascore of 76 on [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii U]] and [[Personal computer|PC]] and 73 on [[Xbox One]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It achieved a 8.5 from [[Destructoid]], as "a memorable game that's hard not to like and recommend to others."&lt;ref name="destructoid1"/&gt;

                         IMPORTANT!!!

This article includes a list of songs compiled in September 2001.  Because it is
a historical list, it does not actually change over time; it is not something new
contributions are made to.

Don't add songs that are not listed in a reliable source as having been on the list in
September 2001, such as the Slate and Snopes pieces given in this article as references.

It is very unlikely that you have discovered a song not already in this article, although of course, if you have a new reliable source that confirms that you have, you should add the new song and the source you're citing.

Any change without a confirming reliable source WILL BE REVERTED.

--&gt;
Following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Clear Channel Communications (now [[iHeartMedia]]), the largest owner of [[radio station]]s in the United States, circulated an internal memo containing a list of songs that program directors felt were "lyrically questionable" to play in the aftermath of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml |title=Bad Transmission: Clear Channel's Hit List |publisher=''[[LiP magazine]]'' |work=Reviews |date=October 24, 2001 |accessdate=January 18, 2011 |last=Wishnia |first=Steven |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20080416014917/http://www.lipmagazine.org/articles/featwishnia_142.shtml |archivedate=April 16, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the time immediately after the attacks, many television and radio stations altered normal programming in response to the events, and the rumor spread that Clear Channel and its subsidiaries had established a list of songs with lyrics Clear Channel deemed "questionable." The list was not a demand not to play the songs listed, but rather a suggestion that they "might not want to play these songs." The list was made public by the independent newsletter ''Hits Daily Double'', which is not affiliated with iHeartMedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The list contains 165 suggestions, including a single suggestion for all songs by [[Rage Against the Machine]] as well as certain songs recorded by multiple artists (for example "[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]" by [[Guns N' Roses]] and the original version by [[Bob Dylan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Truitt|first=Eliza|title=It's the End of the World as Clear Channel Knows It|publisher=''[[Slate.com]]''|date=September 17, 2001|url=http://slate.com/id/1008314/|accessdate=September 14, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071015200337/http://slate.com/id/1008314/| archivedate= October 15, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} Slate published what it claimed was a copy of the list.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, only certain versions of songs were included on the list. For example, the [[cover version|cover]] of "[[Smooth Criminal]]" by [[Alien Ant Farm]] is on the list while the original [[Michael Jackson]] recording is not. Similarly, [[J. Frank Wilson and the Cavaliers|J. Frank Wilson]]'s version of "[[Last Kiss]]" is included, but [[Pearl Jam]]'s cover is not. Also, [[Martha and the Vandellas]]'s original version of "[[Dancing in the Street]]" and [[Van Halen]]'s version are included; [[David Bowie]] and [[Mick Jagger]]'s recording was excluded from the list. Also, the song "[[Leaving on a Jet Plane]]" by [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]] is included, but the version by the song's composer [[John Denver]] is not. [[AC/DC (band)|AC/DC]] has the most individual songs listed, with seven.

'''The Comedian''' ('''Edward Morgan Blake''') is a fictional character, a [[superhero]]/[[anti-hero]]  featured in the acclaimed 1986 [[comic book]] series ''[[Watchmen]]'', published by [[DC Comics]].  He was created by ''Watchmen'' writer [[Alan Moore]] and illustrator [[Dave Gibbons]], although, like all characters in the series, he was based on a [[Charlton Comics]] character, in this case [[Peacemaker (comics)|Peacemaker]], created by writer [[Joe Gill]] and artist [[Pat Boyette]].

==Character background==
===Events of Watchmen===
The story of ''Watchmen'' starts with the aftermath of Edward Blake's murder in 1985.  Fellow crimefighter [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]], independently investigating the murder, discovers that Blake was in fact The Comedian. The main plot of ''Watchmen'' initially involves Rorschach's suspicion of a plot to kill costumed heroes ("masks"); his continuing investigation into Blake's murder leads to a much larger, more horrifying secret. The Comedian appearances in ''Watchmen'' consist of [[flashback (literary technique)|flashback]]s of the other characters, as well mentions in ''Under The Hood'', the fictional [[autobiography]] of Hollis Mason (Nite Owl I) that appears in ''Watchmen'' issues 1-3.

The Comedian was a [[cigar]]-chomping, gun-toting [[vigilante]]-turned-[[paramilitary]] agent. When he first became a costumed adventurer in 1939, he dressed in a [[clown]]-like costume with a simple [[domino mask]]. A brutal [[vigilante]], Blake manages to expunge most [[organized crime]] from the [[New York City|New York]] harbor. He became the youngest member of The Minutemen, a prominent group of heroes. After a photography shoot, he attempts to rape fellow Minuteman [[Silk Spectre]]; she escapes only when another Minuteman, [[List_of_Watchmen_characters#Hooded_Justice|Hooded Justice]], interrupted the assault and beat Blake, breaking his nose. The Comedian was expelled from the group&amp;mdash;but Silk Spectre's agent persuaded her not to press charges against him for fear of what it would do to the group's image. He impregnated Silk Spectre with her daughter and successor, Laurie, during a secret, consensual encounter years later. In the 1940s, Blake updated his Comedian uniform, after being stabbed by a small-time hood. He adopted a leather outfit that served as light [[body armor]], adorned with short star-and-stripe-themed sleeves and a small [[smiley|happy face]] button. He retained the small domino mask and began carrying a pistol. He fought in [[World War II]], becoming a war hero in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific theater]]. It is also implied, but not directly stated, that he murdered Hooded Justice in revenge for the beating he suffered.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchmen'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1960s, Blake had begun working as a covert government operative. Hollis Mason, the original [[Nite Owl]], had published his autobiography ''Under the Hood'' by this point and in it disclosed the Comedian's sexual assault on Sally Jupiter/Silk Spectre. In 1966, he was invited to join the Crimebusters by Captain Metropolis, but he quickly ruined the older hero's hopes of a new team by mocking him, and pointing out that old fashioned crime fighting methods would not save the world from nuclear war.&lt;ref&gt;''Before Watchmen: Minuteman'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside [[Doctor Manhattan]], the Comedian played a major role in the United States' [[Vietnam War|war with]] [[Vietnam]]. Shortly after Manhattan's godlike powers forced the [[North Vietnam]]ese to surrender, Blake was confronted by his lover, a pregnant Vietnamese woman; she is referred to as "Liao Lin" in [[David Hayter]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' draft.&lt;ref name="Watchmendraft0"&gt;[[David Hayter|Hayter, David]]. ''[http://www.sendspace.com/file/dhl9pk WATCHMEN --3rd draft--]''. September 26, 2003. Accessed on December 8, 2008. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; He told her bluntly that he planned to leave the country immediately without her, and in a rage she slashed his face with a broken bottle. Blake shot and killed her, but the attack left his face permanently disfigured with a scar running from his right eye to the corner of his mouth. After this incident, he began wearing a leather [[gimp (sadomasochism)|gimp]]-style mask when dressed as the Comedian.&lt;ref&gt;''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #2. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The costumed adventurers faced massive backlash and rioting in 1977; in response, Congress passed the Keene Act, requiring all heroes to register with the government if they wished to remain active. The majority of them "retired" in anonymity; while others, such as Rorschach, continued their activities in open defiance of the law. Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian were two of the few who registered and were employed by the government. Blake enjoyed his new role in the government and the protection it offered, even going so far as to suggest to members of President Nixon's staff that he had killed [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]] before they could reveal the details of the [[Watergate scandal]], as well as being behind the execution of [[John F. Kennedy]] (on Nixon's orders). The [[Iran hostage crisis]] in 1980 was resolved when Blake freed the captives after an assault.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchmen'' #4. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was during his return from a government mission that Blake discovered the island where Adrian Veidt ([[Ozymandias (comics)|Ozymandias]]) was conducting his experiments that would ultimately destroy New York City. Shocked and appalled by what he finds, Blake realizes that no one will believe him if he reveals Veidt's plan. Veidt, to ensure that Blake does not compromise his operation, confronts Blake in his high-rise apartment and throws Blake out the window, killing him.&lt;ref&gt;''Watchmen'' #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Watchmen'' #11. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Before Watchmen===
In ''Before Watchmen: The Minutemen'' #1, additional details are revealed about Comedian while material from the main story is somewhat [[retcon]]ned. It is revealed that the Comedian got his start as a costumed adventurer at the young age of sixteen and had a prior criminal record for assault. Unlike the rest of the costumed heroes of the Minutemen, he is shown to be driven by [[greed]] and an inherent love for violence. In particular, he assaults a [[bartender]] after breaking up a bar fight and steals liquor and money from the cash register. The issue also implies Blake may have been a victim of severe [[child abuse]] as he claims that a "caseworker" told him what he suffered was the cause of his violent outbursts, though Blake's status as an [[unreliable narrator]] makes the claim uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Before Watchmen: The Minutemen #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Before Watchmen: Comedian'' #1 rewrites the character's back-story further. It is revealed that Blake was close personal friends with [[Robert Kennedy]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] as well as [[Jackie Kennedy]]. This contradicts the main ''Watchmen'' series, which cast Edward Blake as a close personal friend of [[Richard Nixon]] (for whom he had worked as an assassin). The mini-series reveals that Blake was responsible for the murder of [[Marilyn Monroe]] (ordered by Jackie Kennedy, behind her husband's back) as well as revealing that, despite strong innuendo from both Blake and Ozymandias,&lt;ref&gt;Watchmen #10, 12&lt;/ref&gt; that he did not kill John Kennedy and was attempting to confront [[Moloch (comics)|Moloch]] when he found the villain watching the live coverage of the assassination, including Kennedy's death, which caused the two foes to commiserate in their grief.&lt;ref&gt;''Before Watchmen: The Comedian'' #1. DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Events of Doomsday Clock===
In the sequel "[[Doomsday Clock (comics)|Doomsday Clock]]," Comedian turns up alive when he confronts Ozymandias at the time when he was in the DC Universe meeting with [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #2 (December 2017). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out that Comedian survived his fall from his apartment window and washes ashore outside the city where he is greeted by Doctor Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #3 (January 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian continues on the trail of Mime and Marionette.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #5 (May 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian catches up to [[Joker (character)|Joker]], Mime, and Marionette when they attend an underground villain meeting held by [[Riddler]] to discuss the Superman Theory. He makes himself known by shooting [[List of minor DC Comics characters#Typhoon|Typhoon]] in the face. While pursuing them, he evades [[Giganta]]'s attacks, shoots Riddler in the leg, and uses a grenade to defeat the other villains present. When Mime and Marionette are in bed together the next morning, Comedian catches up to them where he plans to use them to find Ozymandias. Before Comedian can do anything, Joker comes to Mime and Marionette's rescue where he uses a joy buzzer on Comedian.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #6 (July 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; As Batman gets free and fights Joker, Mime and Marionette escape with Comedian and the Lantern Battery.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday Clock'' #7 (September 2018). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of name==
In the comic, [[Rorschach (comics)|Rorschach]] explains that Blake's moniker of "The Comedian" stems from his cynical and arguably selfish world perspective that "in an insane world", one can only laugh, as if everything is "a joke".

==Powers and abilities==
The Comedian was a skilled hand-to-hand combatant in excellent physical condition, even at the time of his death at the age of 61. Blake was proficient with his [[M1911 pistol|M1911]] [[.45 ACP|.45 caliber]] [[handgun|pistol]], [[MAC-10]] [[submachine gun]] and [[pump-action]] [[shotgun]], and was shown using a variety of conventional weaponry in his adventures ([[flamethrower]]s, [[grenade launcher]]s, etc.). His government-sanctioned activities suggest that he received training in covert operations and unconventional warfare.

==The smiley face badge==
[[File:WatchmenBloodySmiley.png|thumb|right|200px|The Comedian's badge in the 2009 film]]
Throughout the work, the Comedian is typically seen wearing or in close proximity to the "[[smiley face]]" button which is closely associated with him, and has become the iconic symbol of the Watchmen series as a whole. At the beginning of the series, the button is smeared with a single drop of blood which, if the button is viewed as a clock face, is at the position of the minute hand of the [[Doomsday Clock]] at the time of the series, five minutes to midnight.

==In other media==
[[Jeffrey Dean Morgan]] portrays the character in the [[Watchmen (film)|film]] based upon the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superherohype.com/news/watchmennews.php?id=6056  Watchmen Cast Confirmed!" superherohype.com; ''[[Hollywood Reporter]]''; July 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan commented on the brutality of The Comedian's character, and implied that the scene involving the murder of the Vietnamese woman would be included in the movie, as he does appear to have gained his facial scar due to the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/media/rm1445107456/ch0048618]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the scar does not connect to his mouth in the film, taking away the visually symbolic "smile" present in the comics. Prior to Morgan being cast, [[Ron Perlman]], [[Dennis Farina]], [[Mel Gibson]], and [[Gary Busey]] were considered for the role. In [[David Hayter]]'s ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' script draft The Comedian was born in 1944 and he dies in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Stax, "[http://movies.ign.com/articles/545/545644p1.html The Stax Report: Script Review of ''Watchmen'']."

The '''Cyprus Safer Internet Helpline''' is a service provided by the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Center]] project, coordinated by the [[Cyprus Neuroscience and Technology Institute]] (CNTI).  The [[Helpline]] ensures that not only children and adolescents but also adults have the opportunity of conversing with experts in case they experienced something negative on the Internet. Educated psychologists provide support and essential advice so that the crisis is overcome and the situation is confronted with. Members of the public can reach the helpline at the number 7000 0 116, while the communication is completely confidential and anonymous.

The need for an operation of a Helpline has been stressed by the [[European Commission]], which supports the idea that the increasing rhythm of use of the Internet is disproportionate as far as the correct use and the moral education of using it is concerned. Consequently, a lot of children come into contact with pages containing inappropriate content or individuals who want to exploit them. Such cases usually cause fear and intensity, which needs equitable confrontation.

The Hotline is a member of the [[Insafe|INSAFE]] European network of Awareness Centres that promote the safe and responsible use of the Internet and mobile devices to young people. The mission of the Insafe cooperation network is to empower citizens to use the Internet, the mobile phone, as well as other online technologies, positively, safely and effectively. The network calls for shared responsibility for the protection of the rights and needs of citizens, in particular children and youngsters, by government, educators, parents, media, industry and all other relevant actors.

== History ==

The service was first established in 2009, through the [[Cyprus Internet Awareness Center]], and is co-funded  by the Safer Internet Plus Program of the [[European Commission]], under Grant Number SIP-2008-CNH-143-802.

The Safer Internet Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/activities/sip/index_en.htm Safer Internet Program]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[European Commission]] (EC) has been instrumental in developing the Helpline network in Europe.

== Visibility ==

The Helpine has run visibility events to promote Internet safety issues and has participated and contributed to various forums  with the view to developing safer internet initiatives. It has also provided support and speakers for events run by educational organisations, industry associations and child welfare organisations.  Interviews regarding the working of the Helpline are regularly given on TV, radio and the written press. It is vital that all relevant agencies work together to promote Internet safety and provide a safer Internet environment for all. The Cyprus Internet Helpline is also an active participant in the organisation of various events and activities to raise awareness in the context of the annual celebration of the International [[Safer Internet Day]].

In addition to the Helpline, the  [[Cyprus Safer Internet Center]] also operates the [[Cyprus Safer Internet Hotline]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3433">The '''Dance Notation Bureau''' ('''DNB''') is a non-profit organization founded to preserve [[Choreography (dance)|choreographic works]] through notating [[dance notation|dance scores]] in [[Labanotation]] and collaborating with dance companies to stage reconstructions of those works.&lt;ref name=IED&gt;{{cite book|author1=Cohen, Selma Jeanne|authorlink1=Organizations.|editor1-last=Cohen|editor1-first=Selma Jeanne|title=International Encyclopedia of Dance|date=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195187632}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Based in [[New York City]], DNB was founded by [[Helen Priest Rogers]], [[Eve Gentry]], [[Janey Price]], and [[Ann Hutchinson Guest|Ann Hutchinson]] in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Obituaries: Helen Priest Rogers, 85, Dance Authority|journal=Back Stage - The Performing Arts Weekly|date=19–25 March 1999|volume=40|issue=12|page=50|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has significant holdings of videotapes, photographs, programs, and production information. Its mission is to advance the art of dance through the use of a system of notation - called Labanotation. This allows the dances to be continue to be performed long after the lifetime of the artist.

In August 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/arts/dance/30nota.html Roslyn Sulcas, All the Right Moves, ''New York Times'', published August 30, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; it commenced active work on the notation of dance works following a hiatus since October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danceinsider.com/chevalier/c103105.html Paul Ben-Itzak, The Buzz, 10-31: Nightmare on W. 30th Street: Dance Notation Bureau lays off staff, ''The Dance Insider'', 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The DNB is both privately and publicly funded, including the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[New York State Council on the Arts]] and has a $500,000 endowment.

The use of notation can support the performance of dances when interpreted with DNB assisting about 150 performances each year, including 20 under license from the choreographer or their heirs.

The DNB's Extension for Education and Research is at the [[Ohio State University]].

==Online Resources==
The DNB released an online catalog of its Notated Theatrical Dances Collection, including works by [[George Balanchine]], [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]], [[Antony Tudor]], [[Bill T. Jones]], [[Doris Humphrey]], [[William Forsythe (dancer)|William Forsythe]], [[José Limón]] and [[Laura Dean (choreographer)|Laura Dean]]. In addition, the DNB is digitizing its [https://www.youtube.com/user/dancenotationbureau Moving Images Collection] as the supplement to the Notated Theatrical Dances Catalog.  These clips are available at [[YouTube]] site.

'''''DrawRace 2''''' is a [[racing game|racing]] [[video game]] developed by [[RedLynx]] and published by [[Chillingo]]. It was released September 1, 2011 for [[iOS]] devices, and serves as the sequel to [[DrawRace]]. It is played by drawing an [[Racing line|ideal racing line]] on the game's screen with a finger. The car then follows this line during a race. The game was well received by critics, and holds a four stars rating and an average score of 88/100 at review aggregator [[Metacritic]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:Drawrace2 screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|In ''DrawRace 2'' the player creates a driving path for their vehicle (shown in red) with their finger prior to each race. Their car then follows that path during the race.]]
''DrawRace 2'' is a [[racing game]] in which the player predetermines their vehicle's route around a given track by drawing an [[racing line|ideal racing line]]. The entire course is seen from a top down perspective, similar to the 1986 arcade game ''[[Super Sprint]]''. The game includes 30 tracks, 16 cars and 180 challenges for players to complete. Leaderboards and leagues are also included. Multiplayer can be played with 2-4 players.&lt;ref name="kotaku preview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/5822977/the-next-big-racer-from-the-folks-behind-trials-hd |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |title=The Next Big Racer From the Folks Behind Trials HD |date=July 20, 2011 |first=Brian |last=Crecente}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It differs from most top-down racers in that players use their finger to draw the route their car will take for all given laps. Players can draw faster or slower to have the car accelerate and brake once the race begins. Once all laps are drawn by the player the race begins, and the player's vehicle will follow the drawn path, taking into account the speed at which the player drew the route.&lt;ref name="gamezebo preview"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/drawrace-2/preview |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |publisher=[[GameZebo]] |date=May 20, 2011 |first=Mike |last=Thompson |title=DrawRace 2 Preview}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the actual race players can control a turbo boost button to give their car an increase in speed. This boost recharges over time.&lt;ref name="kotaku preview" /&gt;

GameZone's Andrew Hayward said "''DrawRace 2'' melds racing and strategy in a unique and iPad-centric sort of way".&lt;ref name="gamezone review"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=May 10, 2012 |publisher=GameZone |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/ipad-reviews-week-vidrhythm-radballs-drawrace-2-serious-sam-kamikaze-attack/?page=2 |title=iPad reviews of the week: VidRhythm, Radballs, DrawRace 2, Serious Sam: Kamikaze Attack! |date=September 17, 2011 |first=Andrew |last=Hayward}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stated that while the control scheme probably would not "evolve the racing genre", it worked well for touchscreen devices.&lt;ref name="gamezone review" /&gt; In [[Metro.co.uk|''Metro'']]'s review of the game critic Roger Hargreaves called it "the most addictive and enjoyably infuriating turn-based game of the year."&lt;ref name="metro review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/games/875208-drawrace-2-review-micro-machines |publisher=[[Metro.co.uk|''Metro'']] |first=Roger |last=Hargreaves |date=September 12, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |title=DrawRace 2 review – micro machines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hargreaves cited the large amount of content, multiplayer features, and presentation as high points of the game.&lt;ref name="metro review" /&gt; Toby Moses of ''[[Guardian.co.uk|The Guardian]]'' also praised the game. He stated that it was an improvement over the original ''DrawRace'', and felt that it "could well be the must-have app of the year."&lt;ref name="guardian review"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2011/sep/11/new-apps-drawrace2-review |publisher=''[[Guardian.co.uk|The Guardian]]'' |first=Toby |last=Moses |date=September 10, 2011 |accessdate=May 15, 2012 |title=New apps: DrawRace2 – review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slide to Play's Andrew Webster felt the game was a major improvement over its predecessor. He called it "a more fleshed out and expansive experience".&lt;ref name="slidetoplay review" /&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Kristan Reed thoroughly enjoyed the game &amp;mdash; so much so that it prompted a change the site's mobile review format. Previously all reviewed games were covered under a blanket feature known as Mobile Games Roundup. Reed stated that in the new format highly rated games would not be limited to a small review, but in the future "games as brilliant as ''DrawRace 2'' [will now] on will get the extra depth they deserve."&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{Cite web |accessdate=May 10, 2012|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-09-12-mobile-games-roundup-review?page=3 |date=September 12, 2011 |first=Kristan |last=Reed |title=Mobile Games Roundup • Page 3 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further noted that the price-to-value ratio was extremely high, and even jokingly stated that players should send RedLynx additional money past the purchase to make up for the value.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review" /&gt; The critic from ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' magazine called it the "exceptional sequel to the iOS racing line racer."

'''''Eressea''''' is an open-ended multi-player computer moderated [[fantasy]] [[turn-based strategy]] game world for any number of players. Players interact with the game via [[play-by-mail game|email]]. As of August 2006, the game has over 900 players, and has had weekly turns since August 27, 1996.

== Gameplay ==
The game world is populated by many races and monsters. It consists mainly of player-populated islands separated by oceans, and players control a growing number of units of a given race to build empires, armies and fleets.

Like most open-ended games, ''Eressea'' has no declared objective, it cannot be "won". It is possible to start playing even now, years into the game, and while some players have been playing their empire for many years, several new ones join every turn. Playing is free, although signups for German players (who make up 80% of the population of ''Eressea'') have now been tied to a donation for an animal conservation charity.

== Development ==
The game was originally based on a very early version of ''[[Atlantis PbeM|Atlantis]]'', but has been developed since 1996 independently of the original. The game is [[Internationalization and localization|internationalized]] with support for English- and German-language play. In March 2010 the [[source code]] to most of the game was made publicly available under an [[open source license]].

'''Eurovision''', founded 1954 in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], is a television network that is part of the [[European Broadcasting Union]].

Eurovision was set up for the purpose of exchanging [[TV]] programmes and, subsequently, TV news footage (via the daily Eurovision news exchange - EVN). The first official Eurovision transmission took place on 6 June 1954. It showed the Narcissus Festival in [[Montreux]], Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ebu.ch/CMSimages/en/dossiers_1_04_eurovision50_ve_tcm6-13890.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It has a radio counterpart in Euroradio.

==Background==
The name "Eurovision" was originally coined by British journalist George Campey when writing for the ''[[Evening Standard]]'', and was adopted by the EBU for its network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/music-theatre/2018/05/how-17th-century-war-queen-and-desperate-swiss-tv-executive-led |title=How a 17th century war, the Queen and a desperate Swiss TV executive led to Eurovision |last=Jefferson |first=Ed |date=11 May 2018 |website=[[New Statesman]] |access-date=12 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eurovision is managed by the European Broadcasting Union’s Eurovision Operations Department and offers permanent coverage of Europe, the Americas, the Middle East, North Africa and the Asia-Pacific region, as well as ad-hoc coverage of the African continent and the Pacific Rim.

Not confined only to [[Europe]], Eurovision currently encompasses 75 television broadcasting organizations located in 56 countries of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Furthermore, there are 61 associated broadcasting organizations in Europe, Africa, America, Asia, and Oceania.

==Events==
The EBU in co-operation with the respective host broadcaster, organises competitions and events in which its Members can participate, if they wish to do so. These include:

==News and sport==
Member broadcasting organisations also provide each other with news [[footage]] (over 30,000 separate news items per year) within the framework of the daily Eurovision News Exchanges (EVN). Eurovision also sponsors the annual broadcast news industry conference, [[News Xchange]]. Despite the similarity in name this has no direct connection with Eurovision News Exchanges.

Eurovision has offered free internet streaming of major sports events such as the [[London 2012 Olympics]] on its website, under the name Eurovision Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovisionsports.tv |title=Eurovision Sports Live |publisher=Eurovision |accessdate=27 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmission ident==
Eurovision television transmissions may be recognised by the Eurovision [[station identification|ident]] and the opening theme of [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s "[[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]" which appears before and after the programme to indicate to viewers they are connected and watching via the Eurovision network. The most famous and well known times for this to occur is before and after the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], although most contributed items, such as international relays of sports events, including the Olympics, are not thus credited and the general public is therefore mostly unaware of Eurovision's involvement.

'''Frank Farian''' (born '''Franz Reuther''' 18 July 1941, [[Kirn]], [[Germany]]) is a German [[record producer]] and [[songwriter]], best known as the founder and voice behind the 1970s' [[disco]]-pop group [[Boney M.]] and as the mastermind and voice behind the lip-syncing group [[Milli Vanilli]]. His tendency to create bands with a visual image distinct from the recorded musical performances has led to controversy throughout his career, especially in the case of Milli Vanilli. Farian is also the owner of the record label MCI and several subsidiaries.

==Career==
Farian started as a trained cook before moving into the [[music industry]]. In April 1967, he released "[[Will You Ever Be Mine]]" under the name "Frankie Farian".

===Boney M.=== 
In the early days of his career, he was keen to attain success as a solo artist, but he made little impact on the popular music scene until his song "[[Baby Do You Wanna Bump]]" (a remake of [[Prince Buster]]'s song "Al Capone" from 1967), released under the pseudonym [[Boney M.]], became successful. He also had a minor hit in 1973 with "[[Was kann schöner sein]]", a German version of "When You've Gotta Go" originally by [[Solomon King]], co-written by [[Lynsey de Paul]] and [[Ron Roker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-543979 |title=Offizielle Deutsche Charts - Offizielle Deutsche Charts |website=Offiziellecharts.de |date= |accessdate=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Shying away from the spotlight, he  hired performers to front for public performances. All records were recorded in Offenbach-Bieber, a small town in the center of West Germany. The lead vocals for songs on Boney M. albums in the 1970s were sung by Farian, [[Marcia Barrett]] and [[Liz Mitchell]], who quickly became synonymous with the group. Boney M.'s frontman, [[Bobby Farrell]], was only allowed to record vocals in the 1980s (although all four members of the group did sing live for all their concert tours). Bobby Farrell was fired from the group for unreliability in 1981.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

===Far Corporation===
Farian also started the [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] [[Far Corporation]] (named after the first syllable of his last name), which featured [[Steve Lukather]], [[David Paich]], [[Bobby Kimball]], [[Simon Phillips (drummer)|Simon Phillips]], and [[Robin McAuley]], many of [[Toto (band)|Toto]] fame. Far Corporation is notable for being the first act to [[record chart|chart]] with a [[cover version]] of [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", becoming a [[Top 40|top 10]] [[Hit record|hit]] in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]], reaching number 8 in October 1985.&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums"&gt;{{cite book

===Meat Loaf===
In 1986, Farian produced and mixed the [[Meat Loaf]] album ''[[Blind Before I Stop]]''. He also sang backing vocals on the first single from the album "[[Rock 'n' Roll Mercenaries]]", which was credited to Meat Loaf featuring [[John Parr]].&lt;ref name="British Hit Singles &amp; Albums 2"&gt;{{cite book

===Milli Vanilli===
In 1990, he admitted orchestrating the events which led to the [[Milli Vanilli]] scandal, a musical equivalent of [[Ghostwriter|ghostwriting]]. As a producer, he had assembled a group from [[session musician]]s, fronting it with visually attractive dancers [[Rob Pilatus]] and [[Fab Morvan]]. The story broke when Farian confirmed to the press that someone else had sung on the [[Gramophone record|records]].&lt;ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years"&gt;{{cite book

===Later activity===
Some other groups that Farian has been involved with are [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]] (he became a manager in 1977) and [[No Mercy (pop band)|No Mercy]].

On 15 August 2006, the [[musical theatre|musical]] ''[[Daddy Cool (musical)|Daddy Cool]]'' opened at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] in London's [[West End theatre|West End]]. The line-up included [[Michelle Collins]], [[Michael Harvey (musician)|Michael Harvey]], [[Javine Hylton]], and singer/songwriter Darvina Plante. The £3 million show was produced by Farian and Robert Mackintosh. The story, written by Stephen Plaice with Amani Naphtali, is predominantly based on the songs of Boney M., but also features songs by Milli Vanilli and No Mercy. A second show opened on 23 April 2007 in Berlin, [[Germany]] and the show also toured in the [[Netherlands]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daddycoolmusical.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519131138/http://www.daddycoolmusical.com/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-05-19|title=Daddy Cool Musical|website=Daddycoolmusical.com|accessdate=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; from August 2011 to February 2012, [[Spain]] ([[Palma de Mallorca]]) in July 2012, [[Switzerland]] from, November 2015 to January 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool |title=DADDY COOL - das Musical mit den Welthits von Boney M. im Le Théâtre Kriens-Luzern |website=Le-theatre.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404071429/http://www.le-theatre.ch/daddycool/ |archivedate=4 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anniversary tour in Germany 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |title=Daddy Cool Das Boney M Musical - Frank Serr Showservice Int. e.K |website=Showservice-international.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205023651/http://www.showservice-international.de/daddy-cool-das-boney-m-musical.html |archive-date=5 February 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2006, Farian was credited as co-writing a new song, entitled "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)#"Doin' Fine"|Doin' Fine]]", with British producers Nathan Thomas and Carl M. Cox. (Other writers involved in this song were, Chris Rudall, Baz Qureshi, [[Peter Wilson (musician)|Peter Wilson]], Chris Richards and George Reyam.) Described as paying tribute to the 'sound' of Boney M., the song was essentially a brand new composition, which featured the string [[arrangement]] from Boney M.'s 1976 number one hit, "[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]". The song was recorded by Australian pop singer, Peter Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604231424/http://www.peterwilsonmusic.com/ |date=4 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially released in the UK on 16 April 2007 in its extended format, entitled "Daddy's Cool 12" Mix", charting at number one on the EuroDanceHits EuroNRG Top 40 in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurodancehits.com/index.html |title=Euro Dance Hits : Site News |publisher=Eurodancehits.com |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original version of "Doin' Fine" featured on Peter Wilson's debut album, ''Follow Me'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015201113/http://klonerecords.com/releases/moreinfo.php?ID=281 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Klone Records! |publisher=Klone Records! |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was released in the UK on 8 October 2007. The song was also recorded in 2008 by [[Amanda Lear]].

Other acts he collaborated with include [[Gilla (singer)|Gilla]], [[Eruption (band)|Eruption]], [[La Mama (band)|La Mama]], [[Precious Wilson]], [[Gift]] and [[Daniel Lopes]].{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Popularity ==
Generalist channels as a whole are the most watched of all television channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/m2p/publications/1351591980.pdf&lt;!--http://www.academia.edu/4849268/Political_Information_Opportunities_in_Europe_A_Longitudinal_and_Comparative_Study_of_Thirteen_Television_Systems--&gt;&lt;!--http://hij.sagepub.com/content/17/3/247--&gt;|work=The International Journal of Press/Politics|title=Political Information Opportunities in Europe : A Longitudinal and Comparative Study of Thirteen Television Systems|quote=The most widely watched channels are usually “generalist” channels that cater for the whole population and follow a universal program strategy of which political information programs are an important component.|access-date=2014-10-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029003633/http://uahost.uantwerpen.be/m2p/publications/1351591980.pdf#|archive-date=2014-10-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among HD television channels in Europe, as of 2011 and 2012, generalist channels were third most numerous, losing to the ones specializing in sport and movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.promax.org/home/redirect?ID=65850e78-17f4-450a-81af-5971f423837a |title=Europe home to over 600 HD channels |date=2012-03-29 |work=PromaxbDA |publisher=Informa Telecoms &amp; Media © Informa UK Ltd }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uke.gov.pl/files/?id_plik=13745|title=EBU hits out at threat to digital-terrestrial broadcasting|publisher=[[Polsat|Cyfrowy Polsat S.A.]]|year=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Grey School of Wizardry''' is a school specializing in [[occult]] [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]], operating primarily [[online]] and as a [[non-profit]] educational institution in the State of [[California]]. It was founded by present headmaster [[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]], a founder of the [[Church of All Worlds]]. The school was reported to be "the first wizard school to be officially recognized as an academic establishment."&lt;ref name=Myash2011&gt;Myash, Jeff, (March 2, 2011), [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361852/Grey-School-Wizardry-Real-life-Dumbledore-opens-worlds-wizard-school.html "This spells trouble! Real-life Dumbledore opens world's first wizard school"], ''MailOnline'', Retrieved October 13, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[secular]] institution, not a [[religion|religious]] one, and is not affiliated with any religion or religious organization. Over 450 classes are offered in 16 magical departments. Graduates are certified as “Journeyman Wizards”, using the traditional title ''[[journeyman]]'' signifying one who has completed an apprenticeship.

== History ==
Before the school opened, the Grey Council was established in 2002 by [[Oberon Zell-Ravenheart]] as an advisory group to determine the curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caw.org/content/?q=oberon Oberon Zell], The Church of All Worlds. Retrieved on November 27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Council was composed of some two dozen authors, mystics, magicians and leaders of [[Modern paganism|neopagan]] communities around the world, including [[Raymond Buckland]], [[Raven Grimassi]], [[Patricia Telesco]], [[Frederic Lamond (Wiccan)|Frederic Lamond]], [[Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart]], [[Donald Michael Kraig]], [[Katlyn Breene]], [[Robert Lee "Skip" Ellison]], [[Jesse Wolf Hardin]], [[Nicki Scully]], [[Sam Webster (writer)|Sam Webster]], [[Trina Robbins]], [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Amber K]], [[Ellen Evert Hopman]], [[Luc Sala]] and [[Jeff McBride]].&lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Carole M. (2010) “The Church of All Worlds and Pagan Ecotheology: Uncertain Boundaries and Unlimited Possibilities,” [http://www.basr.ac.uk/diskus/diskus11/cusack.htm ''DISKUS''], Vol 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greyschool.com/index.php?module=Landing&amp;func=display&amp;page=council Grey School of Wizardry: Grey Council Membership]&lt;/ref&gt; The Grey Council worked through 2003 to produce a textbook—a [[grimoire]]—for the school, the ''Grimoire for the Apprentice Wizard'' (2004). This was followed by the ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'' in 2006.&lt;ref name="greyschool.com"&gt;[http://greyschool.com/index.php?module=Landing&amp;func=display&amp;page=school#about "About the School: The Grey School of Wizardry". Retrieved on November 27, 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grey School of Wizardry first opened on the [[pagan]] [[holiday]] of [[Lughnasadh]] on August 1, 2004. In 2011 it reported 735 students.&lt;ref name=Myash2011/&gt; The school's motto is: ''Omnia vivunt, omnia inter se conexa'' (“Everything is alive; everything is interconnected” — [[Cicero]]). It is a nonprofit educational institute for children 11–17 years of age, and also for adults of any age.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischmann, Tom (Winter, 2009), "On Alticorns," ''Indiana Review'', 31(2).&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the school may derive from the colors associated with the [[Magician (fantasy)|wizards]] in the [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] classic ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'' and, in particular, with the appendix to the name of the protagonist [[Gandalf]] (the Grey).&lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Carole M. (2010) ''Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith'' (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate), 73-79.&lt;/ref&gt; It was incorporated as a non-profit educational institution in California on March 14, 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Carole M (2009) "Science Fiction as Scripture: Robert A. Heinlein's Stranger in a Strange Land and the Church of All Worlds," ''Literature and Aesthetics: The Journal of the Sydney Society of Literature and Aesthetics'', 19(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and received a [[501(c)(3)]] tax exemption from the [[Internal Revenue Service]] on September 27, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, George (November 29, 2009), "Oberon &amp; Morning Glory Zell-Ravenheart," [http://www.prweb.com/releases/2007/10/prweb564025.htm "Controverscial.com"], Retrieved November 16, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Curriculum ==
The school provides a seven-year apprenticeship curriculum in wizardry. Faculty and students represent a wide variety of faiths, including Pagan, [[Christian]], [[Jewish]], [[Buddhist]], [[Hindu]], and [[Muslim]].&lt;ref name="greyschool.com"/&gt;

The curriculum begins with simple lessons, and increases in complexity as students progress. More than 450 classes are offered in 16 color-coded departments. These are: Wizardry (indigo), [[Nature]] Studies (silver), Magickal Practice (gold), [[Psychic]] Arts (aqua), [[Healing]] (blue), Wortcunning/[[Herbalism]] (green), [[Divination]] (yellow), [[performance arts|Performance Magics]] (orange), [[Alchemy]] &amp; Magickal Sciences (red), Lifeways (pink), Beast Mastery (brown), [[Cosmology]] (violet), Mathemagicks (clear), [[Ceremonial Magic]] (white), [[Folklore|Lore]] (grey), and [[Black Magic|Dark Arts]] (black). Although some classes address [[mythology]] and [[comparative religion]], the school's grimoire (textbook of magic), ''Companion for the Apprentice Wizard'', and the school's [[philosophy]] focus on magic rather than [[spirituality]].&lt;ref name="greyschool.com"/&gt;

The program was partially inspired by the fictitious "[[Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry]]" from the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' novels by [[J. K. Rowling]]&lt;ref name="Bonewits, Isaac 2005 p. 84"&gt;Bonewits, Isaac (2005) ''The Pagan Man: Priests, Warriors, Hunters, and Drummers'' (Citadel) {{ISBN|0-8065-2697-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2697-3}}, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; and, like Hogwarts, the Grey School hosts four youth houses: [[Salamander (legendary creature)|Salamanders]], [[Undine (alchemy)|Undines]], [[Sylph]]s, and [[Gnome]]s, that are associated with the [[Classical element|Element]]s [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Air (classical element)|Air]], and [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]]. Likewise, there are four equivalent Lodges for adults: Flames, Waters, Winds, and Stones. Houses and Lodges are moderated by faculty Heads and student Prefects. Despite this resonance with a fictional school, the Grey School of Wizardry is "an entirely serious project"; it is an institution for educational enrichment with offerings for children, as well as ongoing educational opportunities for adults. The Grey School provides an interactive social environment, with clubs, merits, challenges, awards, a quarterly student-run school magazine (“Grey Matters”), several week-long summer camps (“Conclaves”) around the US and overseas, and a virtual school which offers home schooling and a G.E.D. program.&lt;ref&gt;Cusack, Carole M. (2010) ''Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith'' (Farnham, Surrey: Ashgate), 75.&lt;/ref&gt; The virtual school was founded primarily to provide an education stream for modern Pagans and their children that is Pagan-focused.&lt;ref&gt;Possamai, Adam (2012) ''Handbook of Hyper-Real Religions'', (Boston: Brill).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Isaac Bonewits]],&lt;ref name=WVObit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witchvox.com/wren/wn_detail.html?id=22549|title=Isaac Bonewits (1949 - 2010) : A Tribute|accessdate=January 19, 2012|first=Peg|last=Aloi|work=Witchvox|date=August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Grimoire collects in one book a library of wisdom about ceremonial native and Earth-centered magic, Paleo- and Neopagan religions, the obligations of the wise to protect the defenseless, great wizards and witches of the past and present, and more."&lt;ref name="Bonewits, Isaac 2005 p. 84"/&gt; Bonewits also asserts that the school presents an opportunity for males who are unsatisfied by the teachings of the modern Wicca movement.&lt;ref name="Bonewits, Isaac 2005 p. 84"/&gt;

'''''Horestes''''' is a late [[Tudor period|Tudor]] [[morality play]] by the English [[dramatist]] John Pickering. It was first published in [[1567 in literature|1567]] and was most likely performed by Lord Rich's men as part of the Christmas revels at court that year.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 61).&lt;/ref&gt; The play's full title is '''''A new interlude of Vice containing the history of Horestes with the cruel revengement of his father's death upon his one natural mother.''''' It has been proposed that John Pickering (John Pickeryng) is likely to be the same person as lawyer and politician Sir [[John Puckering]].&lt;ref&gt;Hager (2005, 322).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Source and text==
The play dramatises the story of the [[ancient Greek]] [[Greek mythology|myth]] of [[Orestes (mythology)|Orestes]]. Rather than [[Aeschylus]]' trilogy of [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] [[Tragedy|tragedies]] ''[[Oresteia]]'' (458 BCE), however, Pickering's [[Source text|source]] for his version of the story is [[William Caxton|William Caxton's]] translation of the French [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]] ''[[Recuyell of the Historyes of Troye]]'' (translated in 1475).&lt;ref&gt;Farnham (1936, 259) and Bevington (1962, 179).&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the play's [[Theme (literature)|theme]] and [[dramatic structure]] are more [[Medieval theatre|medieval]] than [[Theatre of ancient Greece|classical]].&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 179).&lt;/ref&gt;

Only one copy of the play is [[Extant literature|extant]], which the [[British Museum]] holds.&lt;ref&gt;See the introductory note to the facsimile edition (Farmer, 1910); this edition is available online - see below.&lt;/ref&gt; It was published by William Griffith of [[Fleet Street]], [[London]] for sale at his shop in St. Dunstan's churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;See the frontispiece to the 1567 edition (above).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and genre==
Along with [[Thomas Preston (writer)|Thomas Preston's]] ''Cambises'' (c.1561), the play has been identified as a "hybrid morality", due to its articulation of classical themes, stories and characters with the medieval [[Allegory|allegorical]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Spivack (1958, 251–303), Bevington (1962, 58–61), and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt; Within this [[genre]], the central allegorical figure of the [[Vice (character)|Vice]] vies with a non-allegorical, classical [[protagonist]] (Horestes); though their roles are about the same size, Horestes controls the important action.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 81–82) and Weimann (1978, 155).&lt;/ref&gt;

The play has an [[Epic poetry|episodic]] structure, which alternates [[Comedy (drama)|comic]], [[slapstick]] scenes with serious, [[Tragedy|tragic]] ones, all unified by the theme of revenge.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 87, 183).&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the earliest examples of an English [[revenge play]], a genre that includes [[Thomas Kyd|Kyd's]] ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'' (1587), [[John Marston (poet)|Marston's]] ''[[The Malcontent]]'' (1603) and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Hamlet]]'' (1601).&lt;ref&gt;Farnham (1936, 259): "''Horestes'' can claim distinction because of its earliness in the long line of [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan]] [[Revenge play|tragedies of revenge]]."&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike traditional moralities, ''Horestes'' presents an [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] ending.&lt;ref name="potter"&gt;Potter (1975, 119–120).&lt;/ref&gt; In line with both the ''Orestia'' and the ''Historyes of Troy'', Horestes is forgiven for the [[Matricide|murder of his mother]] and her lover; despite its interrogation during the course of the play, however, the justification for the murders remains an unresolved issue at its conclusion.&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt; In a further departure from the [[Dramatic convention|conventions]] of the morality, the forgiveness of Horestes is not prompted by his [[repentance]].&lt;ref name="potter"/&gt;

==Staging demands==
As with other experimental moralities from [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth's]] reign, ''Horestes'' is longer than most of the older examples of the genre, running to 1,205 lines.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 70).&lt;/ref&gt; The play was designed to be played by a company of six [[Actor|players]], with each actor performing between three and seven roles each.&lt;ref&gt;See the title page of the play, which gives the original distribution of roles: First player – [[Vice (character)|Vice]], Nature, Duty; second player – Rusticus, [[Idomeneus|Idumeus]], Soldier, [[Menelaus]], Nobles; third player – Hodge, Counsel, Messenger, [[Nestor (mythology)|Nestor]], Commons; fourth player – [[Orestes (mythology)|Horestes]], Woman, Prologue (whose lines do not appear in the printed edition; see Bevington 1962, 82); fifth player – Haltersack, Soldier, [[Aegisthus|Egistus]], Herald, Fame, Truth, Idleness, [[Idomeneus|Idumeus]]; sixth player (probably a [[boy player]]) – Hempstring, [[Clytemnestra]], Provision, [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]]. Also see Bevington (1962, 72–73).&lt;/ref&gt; The respective size of the roles of Horestes (521 lines) and the Vice (557 lines), as well as the play's frequent alternation of [[Tragedy|tragic]] and [[burlesque]] scenes, suggest that the play demanded a [[playing company]] that included two leading actors who were adept at both serious and comic acting.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 82–83, 85, 87).&lt;/ref&gt; The actor playing Horestes also played the Woman (who appears in a brief scene between lines 626–647), while a [[Boy player|boy actor]] played [[Clytemnestra]] and [[Hermione (mythology)|Hermione]], as well as Hempstring and Provision.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 77).&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually for [[English Renaissance theatre|Elizabethan drama]], the play shares a role ([[Idomeneus|Idumeus]]) between two different actors.&lt;ref&gt;Bevington (1962, 89–90).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1171">The '''Hunnia Film Studio''' was the largest and most important [[film studio]] in [[Hungary]]. Located in the capital [[Budapest]], it was for many years under [[state ownership]]. It originally belonged to [[Alexander Korda]]'s [[Corvin Film]] company. In the closing months of the [[Second World War]] Hungary's ruling [[Arrow Cross Party|Arrow Cross]] regime planned to dismantle the studio and move it westwards, but this plan was wrecked when the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] captured [[Budapest]] and took control of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Cunningham p.60&lt;/ref&gt;

It should not be confused with the earlier similarly named [[Hunnia Studio]].

'''''Juan Bobo''''' is a comic book series of [[Folklore|folk]] stories from [[Puerto Rico]], centered on the [[Juan Bobo]] children's character. For centuries, these folk stories have been passed from generation to generation amongst Puerto Rican schoolchildren, and the Juan Bobo comic books have been published in Puerto Rico, the United States and Spain, among other countries. For nearly two centuries a vast collection of books, songs, [[riddles]] and [[Folklore|folktales]] have developed around the Juan Bobo character. Hundreds of [[children's book]]s have been written about Juan Bobo in English and Spanish.&lt;ref name="postcoloniality2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rodríguez|first=Enid Sepúlveda|title=Thesis - Juan Bobo, Postcoloniality and Frantz Fanon's Theory of Violence|year=2007|publisher=Colorado State University Press|isbn=0549285393}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zipes|first=Jack David|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature|journal=Smad - Zwer|year=2006|volume=4|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195146561}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are at least 70 Juan Bobo stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&amp;type=summary&amp;url=/journals/marvels_and_tales/v019/19.2mccarthy.html ''Juan Bobo and the Riddling Princess: A Puerto Rican Folktale.''] John Alden Mason and William Bernard McCarthy.

==The Juan Bobo character==
{{Main article|Juan Bobo (character)}}
Often a [[trickster]], sometimes a fool, ''Juan Bobo'' depicts a boy with a special way of doing things: with a good heart but little common sense. Juan Bobo tries to do exactly as his mother tells him, yet things always seem to go wrong - until they end up spectacularly right, as though Juan Bobo had an otherworldly, God-given genius. Due to this errant genius, Juan Bobo is Puerto Rico's most beloved noodlehead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://decoloresreviews.blogspot.com/2013/11/juan-bobo-four-folktales-from-puerto.html ''Juan Bobo: Four Folktales from Puerto Rico.'']&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sent off by his mother to find work, Juan Bobo causes one disaster after another and always manages to lose his payment.&lt;ref name="goesToWork"&gt;{{cite book|last=Montes|first=Marisa|title=Juan Bobo Goes to Work|date=September 2000|publisher=Rayo|isbn=0688162339}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical Juan Bobo story his mother asks him to clean up a pig, so that she will fetch a higher price in the town market. Instead, Juan Bobo dresses her for [[Church service|church]] in his mother's best Sunday clothes, complete with lipstick and [[high heels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pitre|first=Felix|title=Juan Bobo and the Pig|year=1993|publisher=Dutton Juvenile|isbn=0525674292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stories incorporate a pícaro young man who roams the Puerto Rican countryside, moving from job to job, and disaster to disaster. Though Juan and his tricks constitute the main story interest, the [[satirical]] comments on various trades and professions give a wealth of information on the social, political and religious fabric of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol19/iss2/7/ ''Juan Bobo and the Riddling Princess''.] William Bernard McCarthy. Journal of Fairy Tale Studies; Vol. 19, 2005; Wayne State University.

==First U.S. collection==
The first series of Juan Bobo stories published in the U.S. occurred in 1921.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} They appeared in the ''[[Journal of American Folklore]]'' under the title ''Porto Rican Folklore.''&lt;ref name="google143"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.wayne.edu/marvels/vol19/iss2/7/ William B. McCarthy, Wayne State University, Vol. 19, 2005. Retrieved August 2, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; The story collection consisted of 56 "Picaresque Tales" about Juan Bobo, and included such exotic titles as ''Juan Bobo Heats up his Grandmother'', ''Juan Bobo Delivers a Letter to the [[Devil]]'', ''Juan Bobo Throws his Brother Down a Well'', and ''Juan Bobo Refuses to Marry the Princess.''&lt;ref name="google143"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Journal of American Folk-lore|year=1921|volume=14|series=Memoirs|editor=American Folklore Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known publishing of the Juan Bobo stories in comic book format occurred in 1973; they were printed by the Walker and Company publishing house, authored by Bernice Chardiet and produced in hardcopy format.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bernice-adapt-chardiet/juan-bobo-and-the-pig-a-puerto-rican-folktale/ ''Kirkus Reviews'', Nov. 1, 1973.

The origin and [[authorship]] of the stories presented a [[sociological]] lesson. The editors acknowledged that the stories absorbed many versions of African and European folk tales, and that the first draft of all 56 stories had been written by Puerto Rican school children. However, none of these children were named or credited in the story collection.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Despite this open and wide-scale [[plagiarism]], the ''Journal of American Folklore'' congratulated [[J. Alden Mason]] for authoring "the most abundant and important Spanish folk-tale material collected in [[Spanish America]]."&lt;ref name="google143"/&gt;

== The King's Theatre, Glasgow – Annual Pantomime ==

The pantomime at the King's has been running annually since 1971. Before that a few pantomimes were staged from 1964/65 after Glasgow Corporation bought the theatre from [[Howard &amp; Wyndham Ltd]].
[[Pantomime]] in [[Scotland]] has always been popular, particularly in [[Glasgow]], and there has been a long tradition developed from the 1860s.
From the 1970s  pantomime productions for the King's were funded jointly by the City Councils of Glasgow and Edinburgh and staged in both cities.
[[Stanley Baxter]] one of Britain's top pantomime dames performed at the King's in the 1980s in Cinderella, written and directed by him.  The management asked him to bring back the same production the following year. He refused, but said 'maybe in eight or ten years.' He kept his promise and returned for his final pantomime appearance in 1991.
In 2005, the company [[First Family Entertainment]] took over production of the annual pantomime, and [[First Family Entertainment]] are now responsible for a dozen productions up and down the country. The current productions run during the festive period until mid January, totalling over 70 performances during the run, with two performances daily, six days a week.

[[Gerard Kelly]] was for 20 years a regular performer at the King's Theatre pantomimes, every year taking up the lead comic role.  [[Elaine C Smith]] appeared regularly between 1996 and 2005, however has since taken a break and in recent years has been involved as an Associate Producer. During her time starring in the pantomimes, she often took on the role of dame, making the King's Theatre production somewhat unusual, with a female playing the dame role, which is traditionally played by a man. Scottish comedian [[Karen Dunbar]] has taken on the leading female comic role in recent years; starting in 2007 as Nanny Begood in [[Sleeping Beauty]] she then appeared in [[Cinderella]] in 2008, [[Aladdin]] in 2009, and again as Nanny Begood in 2011, she created the role of Mrs McConkey in [[Cinderella]] in 2012 and most recently appeared as The Slave of The Ring in [[Aladdin]] in 2013.

After Kelly's death in 2010, both Gavin Mitchell and Des Clarke have taken on the lead comic role a Buttons style character. Emulating his infamous 'Hiya pals' into their own versions of 'Hiya gang' and compiling their own skits whilst still paying homage to Kelly.

The 2014/2015 Season marks 50 years since the first pantomime at the King's, however this will only be the 47th pantomime to be staged here.

''' Lifetime Entertainment Services ''' (LES) is an [[United States|American]] [[entertainment industry]] company, whose media properties are focused on women. Lifetime Entertainment Services is a subsidiary of [[A&amp;E Networks]], a joint venture of [[Hearst Communications]] (50%) and [[The Walt Disney Company]] (50%).

==Background==
===Hearst-ABC Video Services===
ABC and the [[Hearst Communications|Hearst Corporation]] in January 1981 formed a joint venture, Hearst/ABC Video Services (HAVS), to provide programming to [[Alpha Repertory Television Service]] and launch [[Lifetime (TV network)|BETA]], a women's cable service, later that year. Beta was supposed to operate four hours a day and be supported by advertising.&lt;ref name=nyt0&gt;{{cite news|title=ABC and Hearst Set Up Women's Cable TV; ABC and Hearst Set Up Cable TV Unit for Women|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/30/arts/abc-hearst-set-up-women-s-cable-tv-abc-hearst-set-up-cable-tv-unit-for-women.html|accessdate=April 13, 2015|work=New York Times|date=January 30, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; HAVS instead launched the service under the name '''Daytime''' in March 1982.&lt;ref name=idc&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/lifetime-entertainment-services-history/ Lifetime Entertainment Services History]. ''International Directory of Company Histories'', Vol. 32. St. James Press, 2000. Hosted on Funding Universe.com. Retrieved on December 4, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cable Health Network===
'''Cable Health Network''' was a 24-hour cable channel launched by [[Viacom]] with health-related programming in June 1982. In November 1983, Cable Health Network channel was renamed Lifetime Medical Television.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

In June 1983, Hearst-ABC Video Services and Viacom International agreed that each has an equal share for ABC, Hearst and Viacom held by Hearst-ABC Video Services and Cable Health Network in the joint venture, Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services, containing the merged Daytime and Lifetime Medical Television satellite channel.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;(June 15, 1983) [https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/15/business/hearst-abc-viacom-in-pact.html Hearst-ABC, Viacom in Pact]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services===
In 1984, Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services (HAVES) was formed from the merger of Daytime and Lifetime Medical Television to start and operate a new cable channel, [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime Television]].&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

Lifetime committed $25 million to produce talk show programming, but very little worked with the audience. So by the end of 1985, Lifetime was $16 million in debt. Lifetime added more original programming to diversify its audience while programming a medical block on Sunday with all the medical talk shows which attracted pharmaceutical advertisers bringing in 25% of the network's revenue. By 1986, the talk shows were canceled and the company was $36 million in debt.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

Lifetime instead refocused its programming towards women in 1987 and acquired second run syndicated programming and off-network shows.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;
Beginning in the early 1990, Lifetime began producing multiple, original telefilms each year targeting the female audience. Over the next decade, the original movies boosted Lifetime TV's ratings, and successfully launched the "Television for Women" era and brand. .&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

In September 1991, HAVES launched [[Healthlink Television]], which created health and wellness content, and provided the equipment to broadcast it into doctors' offices.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;(September 16, 1991 https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/16/business/whittle-deal-for-healthlink.html Whittle Deal For Healthlink]. New York Times (The Associated Press).&lt;/ref&gt;. Eventually, and to focus on its original content to support it's women-centric brand, HAVES agreed to sell Healthlink TV to [[Whittle Communications]] 

In October of 1991, HAVES reorganized the company to have 5 group Vice-Presidents run the company so the CEO/President can focus on new programming acquisitions, the startup of new programming ventures, and to develop growth strategies; putting plans into motion that increased budgets for original content produced in New York and California by 50%.&lt;ref&gt;(October 1, 1990) "[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-8959962.html Lifetime parent restructures to focus on expansion. (Hearst/ABC-Viacom Services).]" Multichannel News. HighBeam Research. Accessed on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1993, and to better utilize its existing NY studio facilities that independently operated at the Kaufman Astoria Studios (KAS) complex, "Lifetime Studios" was created as an anchor KAS tenant and as a stand-alone profit center for the company. The 100,000 square foot digital facility was intended to produce the network's NY-based original programming, as well as to provide studios, post-production, equipment and personnel for third party productions. During the next 12 years, the studios supported the production of thousands of hours of network content, and was simultaneously home to over 400 projects for an array of other global media companies. 

Among the many projects were long-running, award-winning children's television productions; PBS's "Where in the World is Carmen San Diego" and "Between the Lions", Jim Henson Television's "Bear in the Big Blue House", and "Out of the Box" for the Disney Channel. Additionally, many music and entertainment programs originated from the studios, including; "Top of the Pops" for the BBC, MTV's "Unplugged", A&amp;E's "Live Upon Request", and PBS's "Great Performances". For 10 years, one studio was exclusively dedicated for Lifetime's morning block of talk, cooking and craft programming, including, chef Bobby Flay's first show, "Main Ingredient". In 1995, HAVES had [[ABC News]] produce a two-hour political special for Lifetime, and then a daily live news show. &lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

By 2000, entering the first dotcom era of emerging television and internet platforms, Lifetime Studios provided the facilities and technical expertise for some of the first interactive, cross-platform projects and companies; while also pushing to the forefront of the use of tapeless, server-based hardware and software for television production. Dubbed a "studio of the future", Lifetime Studios was an industry leader until operations ceased upon the expiration of its lease in 2005.

===Lifetime Entertainment Services===
Viacom sold its stake in April 1994 to Hearst and Cap Cities/ABC becoming at some point Lifetime Entertainment Services (LES). For 1996, LES committed $100 million towards original programming. In 1996, the channel's website was launched, Lifetimetv.com. With its recent involvement in sponsoring and programming women sports, the company started a sports division.  Lifetime in fall 1998 spins off a new cable channel, [[Lifetime Movie Network]].&lt;ref name=idc/&gt;

In November 1998, it was announced that CEO Douglas McCormick's contract would not be renewed when it was up at the end of the year.Although Lifetime staff members reportedly were "dumbfounded" because the network had been so financially successful during McCormick's tenure, board members wanted someone who would "bring more vision" to the company.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Richard. [https://variety.com/1998/more/news/mccormick-exits-as-lifetime-prexy-1117488906/ "McCormick Exits as Lifetime Prexy."] ''Variety'', November 29, 1998. Retrieved July 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Board members reportedly were so insistent upon hiring a woman to replace McCormick that at one point during negotiations when his contract was about to expire, McCormick threatened to bring a sex-discrimination lawsuit against them, but decided against it.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmeister, Sallie. [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/15/business/fi-8326 "Lifetime Expected to Name Its First Female CEO."] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', February 15, 1999. Retrieved July 7, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, LES started up its own in house production unit. In 2001, LES launched another spin off channel, [[Lifetime Real Women]] and published its first Lifetime imprint book.&lt;ref name=idc/&gt; The company purchased a 4.6% equity stake in Women.com Networks Inc. in September 2000.&lt;ref&gt;(September 13, 2000) [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/13/business/fi-20257 Lifetime Buys Women.com Stake]. (Reuters). Accessed on December 9, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2004, Lifetime launched ''Lifetime Radio for Women'', a daily nationally [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] four-hour morning show mixing [[adult contemporary music]], live caller interaction, celebrity guests and lively discussions about the topics relating to women. In partnership with [[Jones Radio Networks]], the service aired Monday to Friday from 5 to 9 a.m. or 6 to 10 a.m., depending on the market.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

On March 31, 2005, Betty Cohen, previously an executive at [[Turner Broadcasting System]], was named CEO of Lifetime Entertainment Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.disney.go.com/news/corporate/2005/2005_0331_bettycohenpres.html Betty Cohen Named President and CEO of Lifetime Entertainment Services], ''Disney.com'', March 31, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, 2009, as part of a corporate restructuring [[A&amp;E Networks|A&amp;E Television Networks]] (another subsidiary of ABC and Hearst that handled cable networks) acquired Lifetime Entertainment Services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118007820.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 A&amp;E Acquires Lifetime], ''Variety.com'', August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/329151-A_E_Networks_Lifetime_Merger_Completed.php A&amp;E Networks, Lifetime Merger Completed], ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'', August 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nancy Dubuc]] became Lifetime's president and general manager in April 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-lifetime-20100428-16,0,4237851.story Lifetime Television Gets a New Chief Who Plans to Make Changes], ''Los Angeles Times'', April 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pepsi commercial features American fashion model and television personality [[Kendall Jenner]] and the song "Lions" by [[Skip Marley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/opinion/sd-kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad-20170404-htmlstory.html |title=Kendall Jenner's protest-themed Pepsi ad pulled after backlash |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ad begins silently with a person's hand cracking open a Pepsi can and then a shot of a young man playing a cello on a rooftop. The view pans backward on a city and then zooms in on the musician with sweat flying off of his face as he plays. The music soundtrack then begins, with no other sound accompanying the visual footage. The view switches to a protest with mostly young people walking displaying [[V sign]]s as gestures of peace and carrying signs, including one that says "Join the Conversation" and others with peace symbols.

The view then switches to a young woman in a [[hijab]], who appears to be a professional photographer going through her print photographs with a red marker. Then the view switches to Jenner's character, clad in a silver dress being photographed in a photo shoot, modeling but also showing a growing awareness of the protesters passing nearby. The cellist, shown indoors in a new location, notices the protest as well, then drinks a Pepsi while viewing passing marchers from a balcony. Below the balcony, two young women drink a Pepsi. Then two other women take [[Selfie|selfies]] as the march passes behind them.

The view then switches to the photographer, growing frustrated and then sending her prints flying in a gesture of irritation. She then also notices the protest outside. The view then switches to the protesters, looking cheerful. The photographer looks captivated, grabs her camera, and heads outside toward the protesters. There are images of more young people marching, then the cellist playing music alongside a guitarist as two men dance. 

Jenner's character is shown again, still modeling but increasingly focusing on the protest. The cellist passes her, and gestures with his head for her to join them. Jenner responds by pulling off her blond wig to reveal her dark brown hair, cutting to a shot of her hair being blown forward. She hands the wig to a woman assistant without looking at her, wipes off her dark lipstick, and heads toward the protest.

The camera then shows several police officers standing rigidly watching the protest, then two young protesters, then two men - one in a religious robe - and a woman, several of these characters displaying [[V sign]]s. Jenner, now in a more casual outfit, passes swiftly through the crowd and advances toward the police officers. She hands a Pepsi can to one of the police officers, as the photographer, looking riveted, snaps multiple photographs of the interaction. The police officer drinks from the can, and the crowd of protesters cheers enthusiastically. The photographer puts aside her camera and hugs a protester in celebration. The commercial ends displaying the phrases "Live Bolder", "Live Louder", and "Live for Now".

==Reaction==
The advertisement was pulled by the company one day after its distribution due to criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html?_r=0 |title=Pepsi Pulls Ad Accused of Trivializing Black Lives Matter |last=Victor |first=Daniel |website=[[The New York Times]] |publication-date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company released a statement, saying: &lt;blockquote&gt;Pepsi was trying to project a global message of unity, peace and understanding. Clearly we missed the mark, and we apologize. We did not intend to make light of any serious issue. We are removing the content and halting any further rollout. We also apologize for putting Kendall Jenner in this position.&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Libby|title=Pepsi apologizes, pulls controversial Kendall Jenner ad|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/la-et-entertainment-news-updates-april-never-mind-pepsi-s-sorry-about-that-1491416502-htmlstory.html|accessdate=April 6, 2017|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The advertisement's creators have been widely criticized on social media and by media outlets for attempting to capitalize on imagery imitating protests in the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, including ''[[Taking a Stand in Baton Rouge]]'', the iconic image of a woman, named Iesha Evans, who approached heavily armed police alone and was arrested in a Baton Rouge protest in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/05/522750764/after-uproar-pepsi-halts-rollout-of-controversial-protest-themed-ad|title=After Uproar, Pepsi Halts Rollout Of Controversial Protest-Themed Ad|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-04-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Atlantic Baton Rouge"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/notes/2016/07/a-single-photo-that-captures-race-and-policing-in-america/490664/ |title= A Single Photo From Baton Rouge That's Hard to Forget |last=Appelbaum |first=Yoni |authorlink=Yoni Appelbaum |work=[[The Atlantic]] |publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |publication-date=July 10, 2016 |access-date=April 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzalez |first=Sandra |url=http://money.cnn.com/2017/04/04/media/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad/ |title=Kendall Jenner's Pepsi ad sparks backlash - Apr. 4, 2017 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=2016-12-16 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers of branding and marketing have observed the [[identity politics]] aspect of the spot depicted by the marching masses but called into question the credibility of subverting the police towards a "[[melting pot]]" model. &lt;ref name="Kaufmann"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kaufmann|first1=Kai|title=Fizzy drinks as societal points of no return?|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fizzy-drinks-evil-world-kai-p-kaufmann|accessdate=April 7, 2017|work=[[Pulse]]|date=April 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Bernice King]], daughter of civil rights leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr]], remarked, "If only Daddy would have known about the power of #Pepsi".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tom Batchelor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/tv-radio/pepsi-advert-pulled-kendall-jenner-protest-video-cancelled-removed-a7668986.html |title=Pepsi advert with Kendall Jenner pulled after huge backlash |publisher=The Independent |date=2015-08-19 |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, Pepsi stated, "This is a global ad that reflects people from different walks of life coming together in a spirit of harmony, and we think that’s an important message to convey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Katie Serena |url=http://www.salon.com/2017/04/05/remembering-kendall-jenners-pepsi-ad-which-lasted-24-hours-longer-than-it-should-have/ |title=Remembering Kendall Jenner’s Pepsi ad, which lasted 24 hours longer than it should have |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to marketing expert Mike Jackson, part of the problem was that Pepsi did not have a history of promoting [[social justice]] causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mack Hogan |url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/04/05/kendall-jenner-ad-uproar-shows-how-far-pepsi-has-fallen-marketer.html |title=Kendall Jenner ad uproar 'shows how far Pepsi has fallen': Marketer |publisher=Cnbc.com |date= |accessdate=2017-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advertisement was parodied in a [[YouTube]] video by comedian Vito Gesualdi, who filmed himself handing out cans of Pepsi at an [[2017 Berkeley protests#April_15|April 15, 2017, protest in Berkeley, California]].  Gesualdi stated he was trying to "bridge the divide" in America with cans of Pepsi; however, almost all the cans distributed ended up being used as projectiles by the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Gesualdi, Vito (Performer) |date=15 April 2017 |title=Berkeley Protesters Take the Pepsi Challenge |medium=Videotape |language=en |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7u3uhKxNPNg |access-date=2 September 2017 |location=Berkeley, California |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Comedian Vito Gesualdi ridicules Pepsi and Kendall Jenner with video showing him trying (and failing) to calm a violent anti-Trump protest with a can of soda |first=Stephanie |last=Haney |publisher=[[Daily Mail]] |date=26 April 2017 |accessdate=2 September 2017 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4449412/Comedian-Vito-Gesualdi-ridicules-Pepsi-Kendall-Jenner.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The advertisement was also parodied in an pre-registration trailer for the mobile game ''[[Angry Birds Evolution]]'', with a blue bird named Paige and a member of the Bacon Corp's own security force replacing Jenner and the police officer, respectively.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Angry Birds Evolution Pre-Register Trailer|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EML9VkKteXY|website=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' made reference to the commercial in a skit for the April 8, 2017 episode, where the ad's writer and director, played by [[Beck Bennett]], is chastised by family and friends on the set of the commercial for the ad's content just before filming; however, when Jenner ([[Cecily Strong]]) does the same thing, she is seemingly praised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn8pwoNWseM|title=Pepsi Commercial - SNL|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=''[[Saturday Night Live]]''|date=2017-04-09|accessdate=2018-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei''''' is a [[rail shooter]] [[video game]] released exclusively for the [[Sega Saturn]] in 1996. A [[prequel]] to the first ''[[Panzer Dragoon (video game)|Panzer Dragoon]]'', it was developed by [[Team Andromeda]], one of [[Sega]]'s internal development studios. A PC version was planned for release on [[GameTap]], but was never released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/panzer-dragoon-sequel-coming-gametap|title=Panzer Dragoon and Sequel Coming to GameTap|last=Klepek|first=Patrick|date=13 April 2007|work=[[1UP.com]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot synopsis==
Jean-Luc Lundi lives in a superstitious village where mutant coolias are killed. When Lundi discovers a mutant coolia, he decides to keep it and names it Lagi. Lagi has a strange green glow in his throat. After a few years the coolia begins to grow wings. Lundi takes the coolia out to try to get him to fly.

When Lundi takes Lagi out, a huge ship called Shelcoof, controlled by the AI network Sestren, destroys Lundi's village in an attempt to kill Lagi, who is possessed by the Heresy Program. Lagi's green glow grows brighter, and Lagi fires arrows of light from his mouth, the trademark attack of dragons from the ancient age. The lasers do not reach Shelcoof. Lundi begins to chase Shelcoof on Lagi's back.

==Gameplay==
As with other ''Panzer Dragoon'' games (apart from ''[[Panzer Dragoon Saga]]''), Zwei is a [[rail shooter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=The Return of Panzer Dragoon!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=3 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=January 1996|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in the first game, enemies can be defeated with either the rider's gun or the dragon's lasers. There is also the berserk attack, which is a rain of lasers from the dragon which automatically attack all enemies on screen for several seconds, during which the dragon is invincible. To use the berserk attack, the player draws on the accumulated energy in the power meter, which is filled by killing enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Panzer Dragoon Zwei: Sprechen Sie Harden Coren?|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=5 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=April 1996|pages=102-114}}&lt;/ref&gt; A radar in the corner of the screen displays the location of nearby enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Panzer Dragoon 2 |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=16|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=April 1996|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zwei is considerably more in depth than ''Panzer Dragoon'', with alternate routes to be taken and a dragon that evolves based on the player's performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Guise |first=Tom |title=Double Dragoon|journal=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=4|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=February 1996|pages=30–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In response to player criticisms, Team Andromeda worked on making the game less difficult and more story-intensive than the first ''Panzer Dragoon''.&lt;ref name="Max6"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Panzer Dragoon: The Maximum Inquisition!|journal=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=6 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|pages=42-44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team received no help from Sega's technical division on ''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei'', and did not use any Sega-developed tools such as the Sega Graphics Library operating system; instead, Team Andromeda's programmers created all the development tools used to create the game.&lt;ref name="Max6"/&gt;

''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei'' received generally positive reviews. The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' applauded the game for its multiple routes, differing dragon transformations, and "some of the best graphics ever seen on Sega's 32-bit powerhouse". However, they criticized that the game's low difficulty leaves it with little longevity.&lt;ref name="EGM82"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Panzer Dragoon II Review|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=82|publisher=Sendai Publishing|date=May 1996|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[GamePro]]'', Scary Larry asserted that ''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei'' "blows away anything resembling a shooter on the PlayStation thus far, in both graphics and imagination." He criticized that the game is much too easy, though he noted that the ability to choose from multiple paths increases the replay value in addition to making the gameplay more interesting. He also complimented the way the music reflects what is going on in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Panzer Dragoon Zwei II|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=93|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1996|pages=62-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' said that while the gameplay makes only minimal innovations to the restrictive on-rails format, the game keeps the player hooked though its gorgeous visuals and absorbing story. He summarized, "In a surprising victory for art and plot direction, ''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei'' proves that visual sophistication and compelling storylines can sometimes overcome less than revolutionary gameplay."&lt;ref name="NGen19"&gt;{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Off the Scale |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=19|publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=July 1996|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rob Allsetter of ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]'' praised the impressive attention to detail in the graphics and the multiple routes. He concluded that it "belongs up there with [[Virtua Fighter 2|VF2]] and [[Sega Rally Championship|Sega Rally]] as the standard-bearer for its genre."&lt;ref name="SatMagrev"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Allsetter |first=Rob |title=Review: Panzer Dragoon 2|magazine=[[Sega Saturn Magazine]]|issue=7|publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|pages=70–71}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Maximum'''s Daniel Jevons concurred with Scary Larry that the game "positively laughs in the face of any competing PlayStation 3D shooters." He pointed out that the much-maligned on-rails format is necessary to create the experience the game offers, noting as an example that it allowed the developers to synchronize the soundtrack with what is going on. He also praised the animation, 3D graphics, high frame rate, absence of pixelation even on the heavily detailed bosses, precise controls, lock-on attacks, and the ability to adjust the game's difficulty by choosing different routes.&lt;ref name="Max6rev"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Jevons |first=Daniel |title=Maximum Reviews: Panzer Dragoon Zwei|magazine=Maximum: The Video Game Magazine|issue=6 |publisher=[[Emap International Limited]]|date=May 1996|pages=124-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Panzer Dragon Zwei'' was a runner-up for ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s Shooter Game of the Year (behind ''[[Alien Trilogy]]'') and Best Graphics of the Year (behind ''[[Super Mario 64]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=The Best of '96|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=92|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1997|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the game an A.&lt;ref&gt;https://ew.com/article/1996/06/14/panzer-dragoon-zwei-ii/&lt;/ref&gt;

IGN staff writer Levi Buchanan ranked ''Panzer Dragoon II Zwei'' fifth in his list of the top 10 Sega Saturn games, saying "The original ''Panzer Dragoon'' that flanked the Saturn at launch was nothing short of revelation. But this sequel improves on almost everything, offering better graphics, smoother animations, changing dragon forms, and branching routes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2008/07/29/top-10-sega-saturn-games | title = Top 10 SEGA Saturn Games | accessdate = 2013-04-03 | last = Buchanan | first = Levi | date = 2008-07-29 | work = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pin the Tail On the Donkey-example.jpg|thumb|An example of the game after it was played.]]

'''Pin the tail on the donkey''' is a [[game]] played by groups of children. The earliest version listed in a catalog of American games compiled by the American Game Collectors Association in 1998, is dated 1899, and attributed to [[Charles Zimmerling]].&lt;ref&gt;http://gamecatalog.org/gc/printed/gc8.pdf The Game Catalog, 8th Edition, October 1998 - Page 89&lt;/ref&gt; 

It is common at birthday parties and other gatherings. A picture of a [[donkey]] with a missing tail is tacked to a wall within easy reach of children.&lt;ref name="CCT"&gt;{{Cite book 
 | title=Pin the Tail on the Donkey
 | author=Joanna Cole

 | isbn= 1-58717-230-5 
 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One at a time, each child is [[blindfold]]ed and handed a paper "tail" with a push pin or thumbtack poked through it. The blindfolded child is then spun around until he or she is disoriented.&lt;ref name="CCT"/&gt; The child gropes around and tries to pin the tail on the donkey.  The player who pins their tail closest to the target, the donkey's rear, wins.&lt;ref name="CCT"/&gt;  The game, a [[Group (sociology)|group]] [[Physical_activity|activity]], is generally not competitive; "winning" is only of marginal importance. It is often seen as more entertaining, seeing the children stumble around and try to put their tail at the right place.&lt;ref name="EoPiTS483"&gt;Rodney P. Carlisle: Encyclopedia of Play in Today’s Society, Band 2, SAGE, 2009, P. 483&lt;/ref&gt;

The game is also used in child development research.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal|title=Childhood Derivatives of Inhibition and Lack of Inhibition to the Unfamiliar|journal=Childhood Development|date=December 1988|first=Jerome|last=Kagan |author2=J. Steven Reznick |author3=Nancy Snidman |author4=Jane Gibbons |author5=Maureen O. Johnson |volume=59|issue=6|pages=1580–1589|id= |format=|doi=10.2307/1130672|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|jstor=1130672 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game can also be played by teenagers and adults, especially if the "donkey" is replaced with depictions of something or someone else.  As a [[drinking game]], the person with the worst tail pinning is awarded one shot of a selected alcohol, to be determined by house rules or the loser in a friendly environment.&lt;ref name="EoPiTS483" /&gt;

Idiomatically, the term can be used derisively for any assigned activity which is pointless or for which a person has been handicapped (blindfolded){{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5531">'''''Poklad ''''' (English: '''''Treasure''''') is a 1984 Czech text adventure video game for Sinclair ZX Spectrum computers and compatible systems. it was authored by [[František Fuka]] as his first text video game. It was published by Proxima Software as part of their "Fuxoft uvádí" series. A newer version of the game (as opposed to a sequel) entitled '''''Poklad 2''''' was designed in 1985 and released in 1992.

==Production==
''Poklad '' is one of the oldest surviving games created in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name="databaze-her.cz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.databaze-her.cz/hry/poklad-2/|title=Poklad 2 – Databáze-her.cz|website=www.databaze-her.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; František Fuka had previously created several games on the VIC-20 computer, however he would sell the computer along with its software to an unknown buyer, and those games would not survive.&lt;ref name="databaze-her.cz"/&gt; Fuka, a 16-year-old computer enthusiast, programmed the game on his friend's ZX Spectrum as he didn't have a computer of his own.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://games.tiscali.cz/tema/ceske-a-slovenske-hry-pod-koly-casu-245471|title=České a slovenské hry pod koly času - Games.cz|first=|last=Tiscali|website=Games.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/43165/DPTX_2010_2__0_322733_0_97731.pdf?sequence=1 |title=Institute paper |website=dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuka first got interested in games after his uncle bought him a copy of [[Creative Computing]] magazine, which he wrote for; Fuaka began reading reviews and ads for text adventures.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/43165/DPTX_2010_2__0_322733_0_97731.pdf?sequence=1|title=Počátky české a slovenské digitální narativity: Historie textových počítačových her v Československu|last=Šidlichovský|first=Pavel|date=2012|website=UNIVERZITA KARLOVA V PRAZE|page=24|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had been inspired to make the game after playing a different game called ''Poklad'' (which the thesis ''The Beginnings of Czech and Slovak Digital Narrativity: The History of Text Computer games in Czechoslovakia'' surmises as a translation of a Western game) on the ZX81 computer.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt; Fuka programmed it entirely from memory.&lt;ref name="cuni.cz"/&gt;  

''Poklad '' is considered a beta version of ''Poklad 2'',&lt;ref name="databaze-her.cz"/&gt; for this reason Fuka himself deems ''Boxing'' (1985) his first video game and he expressly acknowledges the first game's non-existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://herniarcheolog.blogspot.com.au/2017/02/hra-2-3-poklad-1984-poklad-2-1985.html|title=Herní Archeolog: Hra 2 &amp; 3 - Poklad (1984) &amp; Poklad 2 (1985)|first=|last=Ugraugra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poklad 2 was translated into English, although Fuka does not remember who did the translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.zx-spectrum.cz/index.php?cat1=4&amp;cat2=2&amp;article_id=interview1.txt|title=ZX-Spectrum Games|first=Pavel|last=Plíva|website=www.zx-spectrum.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polka is sometimes considered the first Czechoslovak game, however depending on the definition earlier video games may have existed through the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://magazin.aktualne.cz/ceske-pocitacove-hry-jsou-fenomen-mely-by-se-archivovat-jako/r~3e9da142d03611e7b6a9ac1f6b220ee8/|title=České počítačové hry jsou fenomén, měly by se archivovat jako filmy, říká Lubor Kopecký - Aktuálně.cz|date=29 November 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Text-based adventures would become the most popular video gaming genre throughout the second half of the 1980s, with over 500 games created; this is because they were easy to make (one developer could make a game in 2-3 weeks), and easy to translate to Western languages.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; 

Fuka created the title without any expectation of financial gain. The Czechoslovak  video gaming development industry was predominantly young high school or college aged males who attended computer clubs, and who made games individually. This made it difficult for the amateur one-team developers to complete with Western professional companies. Fuka would proclaim in 1998: "The few individuals that make games in our country can naturally hardly compete with teams of specialists, for whom making games is not only fun, but also a job (a paid one, of course). One person can hardly be a good author of a game idea, a programmer, a graphic artist, a musician and also have enough time to pull it all off".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Švelch|first=Jaroslav|date=December 2013|title=Say it with a Computer Game: Hobby Computer Culture and the Non-entertainment Uses of Homebrew Games in the 1980s Czechoslovakia|url=http://gamestudies.org/1302/articles/svelch|journal=Game Studies|volume=13|issue=2|issn=1604-7982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot and gameplay==
The player finds themselves in a magical country and their task is to find five treasures. The game consists of a 4 x 5 room matrix in three levels. Gameplay consists of a classic text adventure game.

==Critical reception==
Tiscali.cz thought it was a very simple and short attempt at a game, but that it offered a great forshadowing of where Fuka's career would end up.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Sachsenhausen-Nord''' and '''Sachsenhausen-Süd''' are two city districts of [[Frankfurt am Main]], [[Germany]]. The division into a northern and a southern part is mostly for administrative purposes as '''Sachsenhausen''' is generally considered an entity. Both city districts are part of the ''[[Ortsbezirk (Frankfurt am Main)|Ortsbezirk]] Süd''.

As a whole, Sachsenhausen is the largest district by population and area in Frankfurt. It is located south of the [[Main (river)|Main river]] and borders the districts of [[Niederrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Niederrad]] and [[Flughafen (Frankfurt am Main)|Flughafen]] to the west and [[Oberrad (Frankfurt am Main)|Oberrad]] to the east. Sachsenhausen-Süd is mostly comprised by the [[Frankfurt City Forest]].

Sachsenhausen was founded as Frankfurt's [[bridgehead]] in the 12th century. The oldest documents point to the year 1193. Unlike Frankfurt's own historic city center, which burned to the ground after British bombing in 1944, Sachsenhausen's old town is partly preserved. The Frankfurt [[youth hostel]] is located on its riverside. The population of Sachsenhausen is 55,422.

The [[River Main]] embankment hosts the city's largest [[flea market]] and some of Germany's best-known [[museum]]s; it is also called the ''Museum Embankment'' (or [[Museumsufer]]). Here it is where the annual Museum-Embankment-Festival / Night of the Museums (or Museumsuferfest / Nacht der Museen), with all museums open throughout the night and discounted entrance fees as well as many open-air events in the streets, is held. Sachsenhausen is known for its vibrant nightlife sporting over two dozen bars, taverns and restaurants in the southern part's old town.

The main street of Sachsenhausen is ''Schweizer Straße'', a cosmopolitan boulevard with bars and two of Frankfurt's most traditional [[cider]] houses, ''Zum gemalten Haus'' and ''Wagner''. Ciderhouses that produce their own '[[Apfelwein]]' (applewine) can be identified by the presence of a wreath of evergreen branches hanging outside the location or a similar image included on their signpost. The ''Textorstraße'' and the old town or 'Altstadt' have the best known ciderhouses in Frankfurt, but such pubs can be found all over southern Hesse. Orchards of the Sperling apple can be seen across the countryside and, reputedly, local law requires that Apfelwein be the cheapest alcoholic beverage on sale in any public house.

In addition, there is a brand new part of Sachsenhausen, built on the grounds of the old slaughterhouse area. Try to find the area from ''Deutschherrnufer'' numbered between 40 and 50. The area is located directly opposite the new [[seat of the European Central Bank]] on the other side of the river.

Landmarks of Sachsenhausen are the [[Henninger Turm]] and the [[Goetheturm]].

Sachsenhausen is also the location of the [[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8097">'''Sean-nós dance in America''' has its roots in [[Irish culture]], but may be practiced differently from how it is danced in Ireland. When Irish people emigrated to America in great numbers during the early American Colonial period, or when escaping [[The Troubles]] in Ireland, they brought their dance culture with them.  One of the many forms of [[Irish dance]] is [[sean-nós dance]], which is an informal, spontaneous, solo form of dance.  Sean-nós dance has both modified, and in turn been modified by, similar forms of [[American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing|traditional vernacular solo dance in America]].

== Irish traditional dance ==
The most widely known form of traditional [[Irish dance]] is competition-oriented modern [[Irish stepdance]].  Other popular forms of Irish dancing are for couples and group social dancing, such as [[set dancing]] and [[Céilidh|céili dancing]]. Less known is the traditional solo dance form called [[Sean-nós dance|"sean nós"]] or "old style" dance.&lt;!--   This is a "section" used both at [[sean-nós dance]] and [[Sean-nós dance in America]]—so keep the edits coordinated. --&gt;

== Sean-nós dance ==
Sean-nós dance is characterized by its "low to the ground" footwork, free movement of the arms, improvisation, and emphasis upon a "battering step" (which sounds out the accented beat of the music). By its nature, sean-nós dance follows the music closely.  Indeed, the rhythmic nature of sean-nós dance results in a percussive music of its own. It frequently is danced by only one person, and even when danced in pairs or small groups, there is no physical contact between the dancers.  Because it is a freeform, solo type of dance, it is not necessary for a pre-arranged routine to be decided upon by the dancer; spontaneous expression is preferred in the tradition.  It is less common to see groups performing synchronized sean-nós dance (which requires choreography in advance).  Instead, the dancers may dance in turns, playing off of the energy of the other. Another more specialized form sean-nós dancing is the [[brush dance]].

== Influence on other forms of dance in America ==
Sean-nós dance has made a significant contribution to [[American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing]], which includes [[flat foot dance]] (or "flat-footing"), [[hoofing]] (or "hoofin'"), [[buck dancing]], [[soft shoe]] (casual tap dancing performed in shoes without metal taps), [[clogging]] (in its older non-show form), Irish [[sean-nós dance]], and the Irish [[jig]]. Various other names may be applied for this category of dance, depending upon the specific regional, language, cultural, or social group involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doubletoe.com/history.htm ''A Brief History of Clog Dancing'']. Jeff Driggs, Double Toe Times Clogging Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; Solo Southern dancing and solo mountain-style dancing show strong influences from sean-nós dance.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''I believe that to get some idea of the process of Southern vernacular dance development, we must consider it in parallel with its companion music and the dominant cultures that have mixed to produce it: British, African, and to some extent, Native American. These cultures began their intense musical interaction here in the 17th century, first among African-Americans and then in the 19th century among British-Americans, especially in small Southern towns and nearby rural areas. A good example of Anglo/Afro interaction in music is the introduction of the banjo, originally an African instrument. It is quite certain that the interaction between the European fiddle and African banjo changed the styles and repertoire of both. African-Americans first played these instruments together soon after being brought here, and the banjo/fiddle combination was the basis for the late 19th-century/early 20th-century mountain music to which most of our older dancers moved.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkstreams.net/context,191, ''Talking Feet'' Documentary Film, Mike Seeger]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
- Mike Seeger, Musician, Documentarian, Ethno-Musicologist
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Today ==
Sean-nós dance is not widely found in America today. Small sean-nós dancing communities exist in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Seattle, New York, and Portland, Oregon. These communities are centered around American sean-nós dance teachers — some of Irish-American heritage — who learned their dancing in the west of Ireland. This new generation of younger American dancers now teaches and performs regularly.  [[Kieran Jordan]] (Boston), [[Maldon Meehan]] (Portland, Oregon) and Shannon Dunne (Washington, DC) have produced instructional DVDs in sean-nós dance. Workshops in sean-nós dance can also be found at Irish festivals like the [[Sean-nós Northwest Festival]], the [[Milwaukee Irish Fest]] Summer School, the [[Catskills Irish Arts Week]], and the [[Minnesota Irish Fair]]. Sean-nós dancing workshops are also often incorporated into smaller workshop weekends focused on set dancing.  Occasionally, sean-nós dancers from Ireland tour in the U.S. with well-known Irish traditional bands, such as [[The Chieftains]] and [[Dervish (musical group)|Dervish]].

== Minimalist means of preserving Irish music and dance ==
The Irish people's practice of sean-nós dance, [[sean-nós song]], [[lilting]] (or "mouth music"), and [[Bones (instrument)|"the bones"]] (a simple percussion instrument) represents a minimalist{{clarify|date=June 2013}} means of preserving their musical and dance heritage — despite concerted efforts by the English authorities to usurp Irish music, dance,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071120114146/http://www.geocities.com/aer_mcr/irdance/irhist.html ''Irish Step Dancing - A Brief History'',  Don Haurin &amp; Ann Richens]&lt;/ref&gt; modes of dress, language&lt;ref&gt;[http://goireland.about.com/od/historyculture/qt/irish.htm ''Are the Irish Speaking Irish?'', Bernd Biege]&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Irish Gaelic]] and [[Hiberno-English]]), Catholic religion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/journals/EH/EH41/Cunnane41.html''Catastrophic Dimensions: The Rupture of English and Irish Identities in Early Modern Ireland'', 1534-1615, D. W. Cunnane]&lt;/ref&gt; nationality, and history — or simply due to a dearth of resources when emigrating. Accordingly, the Irish in America have been able to promulgate the dance and musical aspects of the [[Culture of Ireland]] — even after large waves of migration subsequent to highly disruptive events in Ireland, such as the [[Cromwellian conquest of Ireland]] or the [[Irish Potato Famine]].&lt;!--   This is a "section" used at [[Sean-nós dance]], [[Sean-nós dance in America]], and [[Sean-nós song]]—so keep the edits coordinated.   --&gt;

The game is unusual within the action-adventure genre in that there are no towns or [[dungeon (games)|dungeons]] to explore, no characters with whom to interact, and no enemies to defeat other than the colossi.&lt;ref name="colossalcreation"&gt;{{cite web |author1=McNamara, Andy  |author2=Berghammer, Billy  |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2006 | title=Colossal Creation: The Kenji Kaido and Fumito Ueda Interview | url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm | work=Game Informer | accessdate=July 9, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060903065641/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200602/N06.0216.1853.30213.htm |archivedate = September 3, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="behindtheshadow"&gt;{{cite news | author=Kohler, Chris | title=Behind the Shadow: Fumito Ueda | url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70286-0.html | work=Wired News | accessdate=July 9, 2006 | date=March 9, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060629071507/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,70286-0.html | archivedate=June 29, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Shadow of the Colossus'' has been described as a [[Puzzle video game|puzzle game]], as each colossus can only be killed by attacking certain weak points which require specific actions to access.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Shoemaker, Brad | date=October 17, 2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus for PlayStation 2 Review | url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/shadow-of-the-colossus-review/1900-6135831/ | work=GameSpot | accessdate=April 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web | author=Reed, Kristan | year=2005 | title=Review – Shadow of the Colossus | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=61436 | work=Euro Gamer | accessdate=July 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cited as an influential title in the video game industry and one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest games of all time]], ''Shadow of the Colossus'' is often regarded as an important example of [[video games as an art form|video game as art]] due to its [[minimalist]] landscape designs, immersive gameplay and emotional journey. It received wide critical acclaim by the media and was met with strong sales compared to ''Ico'', due in part to a larger marketing campaign. The soundtrack was also widely praised. The game won several awards for its audio, design, and overall quality. ''Shadow of the Colossus'' is also referenced numerous times in debates regarding the art quality and emotional perspectives of video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |work=Chicago Sun-Times |title=Okay, kids, play on my lawn |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100811003526/http://blogs.suntimes.com/ebert/2010/07/okay_kids_play_on_my_lawn.html |archivedate=August 11, 2010 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A remastered version for the [[PlayStation 3]] was developed by [[Bluepoint Games]] and released alongside ''Ico'' as ''[[The Ico &amp; Shadow of the Colossus Collection]]'' in September 2011. It features [[High-definition video|high-definition]] (HD) graphics, content previously missing from the North American version, [[PlayStation Network Trophies]], and 3D support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2010/09/15/ico-and-shadow-of-the-colossus-collection-hits-ps3-spring-2011-with-3d/|title=Ico and Shadow of the Colossus Collection hits PS3 Spring 2011 with 3D|date=September 15, 2010|last=Shuman|first=Sid|publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment America|SCEA]]|accessdate=September 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HD version was released separately in Japan.

==Gameplay==
Progression through ''Shadow of the Colossus'' occurs in cycles. Beginning at a central point in an expansive landscape, the player seeks out and defeats a colossus, and is then returned to the central point to repeat the process.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; To find each colossus, Wander may raise his sword while in a sunlit area to reflect beams of light, which will converge when the sword is pointed in the right direction of the next encounter.&lt;ref name="ignpreview2"&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | year=2005 | title=Pre-E3 2005: Shadow of the Colossus | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/608/608001p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=August 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey to a colossus is seldom a straightforward matter: stretches of varied terrain often require that a detour be taken along the way. Most colossi are located in remote areas, such as atop cliffs or within ancient structures.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN-Guide"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://guides.ign.com/guides/490849/index.html| title = Guides: Shadow of the Colossus Walkthrough| publisher = IGN| accessdate = April 29, 2014| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120813232259/http://guides.ign.com/guides/490849/index.html| archivedate = August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SotCglyphstab.JPG|left|thumb|Wander climbs the first colossus to stab the sigil on its forehead. The [[HUD (video gaming)|heads-up display]] shows the character's health and stamina (lower right), as well as the colossus' health (upper left).]]

Once a colossus is found, the player must discover its weaknesses to defeat it. Each colossus dwells in a unique lair, and many colossi cannot be defeated without making use of the surrounding environment.&lt;ref name="ignpreview3"&gt;{{cite web | author=Sulic, Ivan | year=2005 | title=A Colossus Falls | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/641/641470p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=August 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every colossus has at least one weak point, indicated by a glowing [[sigil (magic)|sigil]]&lt;ref name="giantleap"&gt;{{cite news | author=Kohler, Chris | title=Colossus Is Giant Leap for Games | url=https://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,69334,00.html | work=Wired News | accessdate=July 17, 2006 | date=October 26, 2005 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618123156/http://www.wired.com/news/games/0,2101,69334,00.html | archivedate=June 18, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that can be illuminated and identified by the sword's reflected light.&lt;ref name="ignpreview2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignpreview4"&gt;{{cite web | author=Dunham, Jeremy | year=2005 | title=E3 2005: Shadow of the Colossus Update | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/616/616095p1.html | work=IGN |accessdate=August 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each colossus has areas covered with fur or protruding ledges, which Wander may use to grip and scale the colossus while it thrashes about in an attempt to dislodge him.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; While scaling a colossus, the player must act quickly, as Wander has a limited stamina gauge that decreases while he hangs onto the creature.

Wander and the colossi have [[Health (game mechanism)|life bars]] to indicate their remaining health. A colossus' health will decrease significantly when its weak points are attacked, while Wander can be harmed by a colossus' attacks or a fall from great height. Throughout the game, Wander is equipped with only a sword and a bow with arrows,&lt;ref name="giantleap" /&gt; but may obtain other weapons from completing the Time Attack trials.

While the colossi are the only enemies, there are natural animals in the environment. Only one species, however, has any effect on gameplay: eating the tail of a certain kind of lizard increases Wander's stamina gauge. Likewise, the player may find fruit that increases Wander's maximum health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://guides.ign.com/guides/490849/page_5.html | title=''Shadow of the Colossus'' Guide | publisher=IGN | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120813074738/http://guides.ign.com/guides/490849/page_5.html | archivedate = August 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wander's horse, Agro,&lt;ref&gt;''Shadow of the Colossus'' instruction book. [[Sony Computer Entertainment]], 2005. pp. 14–16.&lt;/ref&gt; plays a large role in the game. In addition to serving as a means of transportation, fighting from horseback is vital to defeating some of the colossi.&lt;ref name="ignpreview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Gantayat, Anoop | year=2005 | title=Wanda and Colossus | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/546/546753p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=August 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, many environments that cannot be traversed by horse, and colossi often inhabit areas within deep water or beyond large obstacles that must be scaled. Agro cannot travel beyond these, and when separated from Wander by such obstacles, cannot participate in the following battle.&lt;ref name="ignpreview2" /&gt; Agro is referred to as a male in the English-language version of the game,&lt;ref&gt;Sony Computer Entertainment. Shadow of the Colossus. (Sony Computer Entertainment). PlayStation 2.

The environment must be used to the player's advantage more often as the game progresses. The first two battles take place on simple, large, flat areas of land, with the only goal being to discover how to scale the colossi and attack their weak points.&lt;ref name="ignpreview2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignpreview3" /&gt; However, the majority of the following fourteen battles require that some aspect of the battlefield be used.&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignreview"&gt;{{cite web | last=Roper | first=Chris | year=2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus Review | url=http://ps2.ign.com/articles/658/658991p1.html | work=IGN | accessdate=July 21, 2006}} Page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot and setting ==
During ''Shadow of the Colossus'', the player receives little information concerning the backstories of the characters and their relationships with one another.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; The game takes place in a [[fantasy]] setting,&lt;ref name="gamespyreview"&gt;{{cite web | author=McGarvey, Sterling | year=2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus Review | url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/ico-ii/658966p1.html | work= GameSpy | accessdate=August 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fantasysetting"&gt;{{cite web | author=Daultrey, Stephen | year=2004 | title=An epic called Wanda: Sony's "awesome" PS2 works uncovered | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=109139 | work=Computer and Videogames] | accessdate=August 17, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918121008/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=109139 | archive-date=September 18, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of the game's events occurring within a vast and unpopulated [[peninsula]], known as the Forbidden Land, separated from the outside world by a mountain range to its north and sea to the south and east.

The region is only accessible via a small cleft in the mountains to the north, leading to a massive stone bridge.

It is, however, forbidden to enter the land,&lt;ref name="dorminandshrine"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2 |quote = '''Emon (narrating):''' That place... began from the resonance of intersecting points...

[[File:Mono and Wander.JPG|thumb|Wander standing before Mono. Both Wander and Mono were designed with long hair from the start of the design process.]]
The [[protagonist]] of the game is {{Nihongo|Wander|ワンダ|Wanda|voiced by [[Kenji Nojima]]}}, a young man whose goal is to resurrect a girl named {{Nihongo|Mono|モノ||voiced by [[Hitomi Nabatame]]}}. Little is known about Mono other than that she was a maiden who was somehow sacrificed because she was believed to have a cursed destiny.&lt;ref name="dorminrequest"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=[[PlayStation 2]]|quote='''Wander:''' She was sacrificed, for she has a cursed fate.

The story revolves around these characters but features a small supporting cast including Lord {{Nihongo|Emon|エモン||voiced by [[Naoki Bandō]]}} and his men.

Speaking with two voices at once (one male and one female), Dormin is a mysterious, disembodied entity.  In [[legend]]s of the game's world, it is said that Dormin has the power to revive the dead;&lt;ref name="dorminandshrine" /&gt;&lt;ref name="official site" /&gt; it is for this reason that Wander enters the forbidden land, seeking its assistance in reviving Mono. Dormin offers to revive her in exchange for Wander destroying the sixteen colossi.&lt;ref name="dorminrequest"/&gt; "Dormin", which spells "Nimrod" backwards, has been speculated to be a reference to the body of the biblical King [[Nimrod]] which was cut up and scattered.&lt;ref name="ciccoricco" /&gt;

Lord Emon is a [[shamanism|shaman]] who narrates a vision in the game's introduction, vaguely explaining the origin of the land Wander has come to, and emphasizing that entry to this place is forbidden.&lt;ref name="dorminandshrine" /&gt; He is portrayed as having extensive knowledge regarding the nature and containment of Dormin, and the ability to use powerful [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. He has a small group of warriors at his command, and is pursuing Wander to prevent the use of "the forbidden spell", the ritual involving the destruction of the sixteen colossi and the restoration of Dormin's power.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Colossus"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote= '''Emon:''' Have you any idea what you've done?!

The colossi are armored, most often enormous creatures with forms ranging from various humanoids to predatory animals, and live in all manner of surroundings and environments, including beneath water and flying through the air. Their bodies are a fusion of [[organic matter|organic]] and [[Inorganic compound|inorganic]] parts such as rock, earth, fur, and [[architectural]] elements, some of which are weathered or fractured.

=== Story ===
The story of ''Shadow of the Colossus'' begins as Wander enters the forbidden land, traveling across the long bridge on his horse, Agro. Unknown to the player, prior to entering the forbidden land Wander had stolen an ancient sword, which is the only weapon capable of slaying the colossi of the forbidden land.&lt;ref name="Shadow of the Colossus"/&gt; Led to the massive Shrine of Worship at the center of the region, Wander carries with him the body of a maiden named Mono. A moment later, several man-like shadowy creatures appear and prepare to attack Wander before he easily dismisses them with a wave of the ancient sword in his possession. After vanquishing the shadow creatures, the voice of the disembodied entity known as "Dormin" echoes from above, expressing surprise that Wander possesses the weapon. Wander requests that Dormin return Mono's soul to her body, which Dormin states may be possible on the condition that Wander can destroy the sixteen [[cult image|idols]] lining the temple's hall by using the ancient sword to kill the sixteen colossi located throughout the land. Despite being warned by Dormin that he may have to pay a great price to revive Mono, Wander sets out to search the land for the colossi and destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Dormin:''' But heed this, the price you pay may be heavy indeed. / '''Wander:''' It doesn't matter. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

What Wander does not know is that the colossi contain portions of Dormin's own essence that were scattered long ago to render the entity powerless.&lt;ref name="dorminrequest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dorminsealed"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Dormin:''' Thou severed Our body into sixteen segments for an eternity in order to seal away Our power... }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Wander kills each colossus, a released fragment of Dormin enters his body. Over time, the signs of Wander's deterioration from the gathered essence become clearer—his skin becoming paler, his hair darker, and dark streaks growing across his face. After the death of the twelfth colossus, it is revealed to the player that Wander is being pursued by a group of warriors led by Emon. Urged to hurry with his task by Dormin, Wander soon heads off to defeat the sixteenth and final colossus. On the way to this confrontation, he travels on horseback across a long bridge which begins to collapse as he is halfway across. At the last second when it seems he will not make it, Wander is thrown to the other side by Agro before the horse falls into the distant river below.

Soon after, Wander goes on to defeat the final colossus as Emon's company arrives in the Shrine of Worship to witness the last temple idol crumble. Wander appears back in the temple soon after, the signs of his corruption readily apparent: his skin is clammy, his eyes are milky, and a pair of tiny [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] has sprouted from his head. Emon orders his warriors to kill the "[[Spirit possession|possessed]]" man as he approaches Mono and finally falls once stabbed through the heart by one of Emon's men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Emon:''' Eradicate the source of the evil.

It is better to put him out of his misery than to exist, cursed as he is.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a newly whole Dormin takes control of Wander's body and transforms into a shadowy giant.&lt;ref name="dorminsealed"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Dormin:''' We have borrowed the body of this warrior...  }}&lt;/ref&gt; While his men flee, Lord Emon casts the ancient sword into a small pool at the back of the temple's hall to evoke a whirlwind of light that consumes Dormin and Wander, sealing Dormin within the temple once again. After fleeing with the bridge connecting to the temple collapsing behind them, forever isolating the forbidden land from the rest of the world, Emon expresses hope that Wander may be able to atone for his crimes should he have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Shadow of the Colossus |developer=Sony Computer Entertainment |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment |date=October 18, 2005 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Emon:''' Poor ungodly soul... Now, no man shall ever trespass upon this place again. Should you be alive... If it's even possible to continue to exist in these sealed lands...one day, perhaps you will make atonement for what you've done.  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Back in the temple, Mono awakens and finds Agro limping into the temple with an injured hind leg. Mono follows Agro to the pool into which Wander and Dormin were pulled by Emon's spell, finding a male [[infant]] with tiny horns on his head.

== Development ==
With a team of thirty-five people, ''Shadow of the Colossus'' began development in 2002 under the project name ''Nico'' (a [[portmanteau]] of ''ni'', [[2]] in Japanese, and "Ico")&lt;ref name="dengeki"&gt;{{cite web | editor=Dengeki PlayStation staff | year=2005 | title=Interview Wander to Kyozō | url=http://dol.dengeki.com/soft/recommend/wander/ | work=Dengeki Online | accessdate=March 12, 2008 | language=Japanese }} Translation of paragraph 1&lt;!--trans by [[:Special:Contributions/87.231.15.102|87.231.15.102]]--&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;'''Ueda Fumihito''': ''In the first stages of development, "Wander to Kyozō" was called "Nico," short for "Next Ico." The idea for our new game was to use what we had learned in "Ico" and come up with something new. However, "Nico" was nothing more than a temporary project name and it was clear from the beginning that the title would change''.&lt;/ref&gt; and was intended to be a sequel to ''Ico''.&lt;ref name="psau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makingcolossalgames"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kosak, Dave "Fargo" | year=2006 | title=Making Colossal Games | url=http://ps2.gamespy.com/playstation-2/ico-ii/688379p2.html | work=GameSpy | accessdate=July 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early [[technology demo]] for the project shown at the [[DICE Summit]] in 2003 depicted a group of masked, horned boys riding horses while attacking and defeating a colossus.&lt;ref name="psau" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makingcolossalgames" /&gt; However, Fumito Ueda expressed that, at the time, it was simpler to reuse the character design of ''Ico''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s protagonist, and that he never explicitly desired a sequel to ''Ico''.&lt;ref name="psnz"&gt;{{cite web |editor1=PlayStation.com New Zeal |editor2=site staff | title=A Colossus Speaks | url=http://www.nz.playstation.com/news/shadow_of_the_colossus_qna.jhtml;jsessionid=PKA23GLV1NC5XS3YIXZCFE4LXBC5GIV0 | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160523184714/http://www.nz.playstation.com/news/shadow_of_the_colossus_qna.jhtml;jsessionid=PKA23GLV1NC5XS3YIXZCFE4LXBC5GIV0 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=May 23, 2016 | work=PlayStation.com New Zealand |accessdate=July 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese [[pre-order]]s of ''Shadow of the Colossus'' later included a bonus [[DVD]] with the concept video, a trailer describing ''Nico''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s plot, and an introduction the development team states they wanted to use in ''Shadow of the Colossus''.

Ueda and producer Kenji Kaido held their team to a high standard throughout production. An admitted perfectionist, Ueda felt that only one or two out of 500 artists who applied to work on ''Shadow of the Colossus'' met his criteria, and often demanded thorough changes in design until it matched his vision.&lt;ref name="makingcolossalgames" /&gt; For his part, Kaido challenged the programmers to meet the concept of realistic physics in relation to the movement of the colossi and the subsequent effect this movement would have for Wander, both in terms of how he might be displaced and how he may be able to use this movement to his advantage. For instance, if a colossus were to shake, Kaido wanted Wander's position to shift realistically in response. Additionally, if a colossus' limb was currently horizontal, Kaido wanted the player to be able to run across the limb as though it were any other flat surface. He referred to these two concepts as "player dynamics and reactions" and "organic collision deformation".&lt;ref name="makingcolossalgames" /&gt; The realistic physics engine produced as a result required that faster colossi had to be smaller as well.&lt;ref name="psnz" /&gt;

[[File:Kaido Kenji And Fumito Ueda.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kenji Kaido]], producer of the game, and [[Fumito Ueda]], lead designer of the game at Art Futura 2005]]
Ueda wished the game to have a unique presentation&lt;ref name="colossalcreation" /&gt; and change how both players and developers perceived the idea of what [[boss (video games)|bosses]] should be in video games. To achieve this, he ensured that the game's only enemies would be the sixteen colossi, that they could only be approached one at a time, and that they would have various behavior patterns.&lt;ref name="psnz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1up"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mielke, James |year=2005 |title=Shadow Talk: Interview with Fumito Ueda and Kenji Kaido |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?cId=3144673 |work=1UP.com |accessdate=July 23, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120629175723/http://www.1up.com/features/shadow-talk |archivedate=June 29, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though limiting the presence of enemies to only bosses was partly intended to differentiate the game from others, Ueda also expressed that it was to ensure that the programmers' focus was entirely on the colossi so that their quality would be as high as possible.&lt;ref name="behindtheshadow" /&gt; In accordance with this focus upon the colossi—and his preference for simple controls—he intended that one button on the [[game controller]] be used solely for targeting the colossi during battles.&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt; Ueda cited ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' as an influence on the boss design, referring to the bosses as "inverted Zelda dungeons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shadow of the Colossus|author=Tim Rogers|website=Insert Credit|url=http://archives.insertcredit.com/reviews/wanda/|date=October 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A theme of companionship between the player and an [[game artificial intelligence|AI]]-controlled partner was a concern for Ueda.&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt; In ''Ico'', this theme was presented through the protagonist and the character Yorda, whom the player was required to work with and protect while navigating the game's environments.&lt;ref name="1up2"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Mielke, James |author2=Rybicki, Joe |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005 |title=A Giant In The Making |url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=2&amp;cId=3143702 |work=1UP.com |accessdate=July 30, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130306095204/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=0&amp;cId=3143702 |archivedate=March 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a key element in ''Shadow of the Colossus'' is the relationship between Wander and his horse, Agro.&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt; Intended to be a realistic representation of a horse, Agro will occasionally ignore commands. In Ueda's words, "a real horse ... doesn't always obey. It's not like a car or a motorcycle, it won't always turn when you say 'turn!'" However, he has admitted that the team had to seek a balance in how often Agro did not respond to commands so as to not sacrifice playability in the pursuit of realism.&lt;ref name="1up" /&gt;

All elements of the game—including audio, gameplay and visuals—were used to achieve an atmosphere of a "[[loner|lonely hero]]", which Ueda considered important in the development of the game. Lighting, in particular, was used to establish a dark, fearsome setting for the forbidden land, while the protagonist's sword would provide a means of navigation that was "direct and only expressible visually".&lt;ref name="1up2" /&gt; Like ''Ico'', ''Shadow of the Colossus'' uses a distinct style of lighting. The game's [[game engine|engine]] uses elements such as [[saturation (color theory)|desaturated colors]], [[motion blur]] and partial [[high dynamic range rendering]], with a heavy emphasis on [[bloom (shader effect)|bloom lighting]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ignpreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="makingofsotc"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nishikawa |year=2005 |title=Shadow of the Colossus PS2 Preview |url=http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20051207/3dwa.htm |work=Impress Watch |accessdate=August 2, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060820162258/http://www.watch.impress.co.jp/game/docs/20051207/3dwa.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2006 |df= }} Translation available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20060216113144/http://www.dyingduck.com/sotc/making_of_sotc.html The Making of "Shadow of the Colossus"]&lt;/ref&gt;

A PlayStation 3 remastered version of ''Ico'' and ''Shadow of the Colossus'' was announced at Tokyo Game Show 2010 and released in September 2011. Developed by [[Bluepoint Games]], both were improved graphically to take advantage of the PlayStation 3's hardware and [[HDTV]]s, with numerous other improvements implemented.

=== PAL release ===
The [[PAL region|PAL]] version of the game was released in February 2006. Much like the PAL release for ''Ico'', the game came in cardboard packaging displaying various pieces of artwork from the game, and contained four art cards.&lt;ref name="extrasandico"&gt;{{cite web | editor=Wales, Matt | year=2006 | title=PAL Colossus gets exclusive content | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=133500 | work=computerandvideogames | accessdate=July 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="artcards"&gt;{{cite web | editor=Li, Felix M.C. a.k.a.

The game also came with a "making of" documentary, a trailer for ''Ico'' and a gallery of [[concept art]], accessible from the game's main menu.&lt;ref name="extrasandico" /&gt; Sony Computer Entertainment also re-released ''Ico'' in PAL territories at the time of ''Shadow of the Colossus''{{'}}s release, both to promote the game through ''Ico''{{'}}s reputation, and to allow players who did not buy ''Ico'' during its original limited release to "complete their collections".&lt;ref name="extrasandico" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icorerelease"&gt;{{cite web | editor=Wales, Matt | year=2006 | title=Fumito Ueda | url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=132780 | work=computerandvideogames | accessdate=July 17, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725002609/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/132780/interviews/fumito-ueda/ | archive-date=July 25, 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some confusion has arisen in PAL regions concerning the official name of the protagonist primarily because of the manual's usage of "Wanda", while the North American manual and the game itself uses the name "Wander". In fact, the Japanese version of the game spells the name "Wander" as ワンダ (''Wanda''), which is also the common transliteration of the English name "Wanda", hence the mistake in the manual.

While the game has an extensive orchestral soundtrack, the music is only heard during [[cut scene]]s and colossus encounters, while time spent at the Shrine of Worship and traversing the landscape is silent save for the sounds made by the protagonist, his horse and their surroundings.&lt;ref name="shadowreview"&gt;{{cite web | author=Ramsey | year=2006 | title=Review of Shadow of the Colossus | url=http://www.gamechew.com/review.php?id=2| work=GameChew | accessdate=July 29, 2006| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060621142435/http://www.gamechew.com/review.php?id=2| archivedate = June 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The open nature of the game world and lack of life, coupled with this limited use of music, aids in establishing an atmosphere of solitude,&lt;ref name="1up2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="instantreview"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rogers, Tim |year=2005 |title=Review of Shadow of the Colossus |url=http://www.insertcredit.com/reviews/wanda/ |work=insert credit |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719000400/http://www.insertcredit.com/reviews/wanda/ |archivedate=July 19, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to that of ''Ico''.&lt;ref name="ignreview" /&gt;

On December 7, 2005, a [[soundtrack album]] containing music from the game was released only in Japan, titled {{Nihongo|''Wander and the Colossus Original Soundtrack: Roar of the Earth''|ワンダと巨像　オリジナル サウンドトラック大地の咆哮|Wanda to Kyozō Original Soundtrack: Daichi no Hōkō|lead=1}}.&lt;ref name="King Record Co., Ltd"&gt;{{cite AV media notes |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/96 |title=Wander and the Colossus Original Soundtrack: Roar of the Earth |page=8 |year=2005 |publisher=King Record Co., Ltd. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120722165035/http://vgmdb.net/album/96 |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently no announced plans to release the album in other territories.

He has also worked on several of the 1990s-era [[Gamera]] films, as well as a variety of [[anime]].

=== Remake ===
{{main article|Shadow of the Colossus (2018 video game)}}

Sony announced a remake of ''Shadow of the Colossus'' for the [[PlayStation 4]] during their [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]] press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/shadow-of-the-colossus-is-getting-a-remake-441922.phtml|title=Shadow of the Colossus is getting a remake|last=Valdez|first=Nick|date=June 12, 2017|work=[[Destructoid]]|accessdate=June 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on February 6, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps4s-shadow-of-the-colossus-remaster-release-date-/1100-6454481/|title=PS4's Shadow Of The Colossus Remaster Release Date Confirmed|last=Dayus|first=Oscar|date=October 31, 2017|work=[[Gamespot]]|accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remake is led by Bluepoint, who developed the earlier PlayStation 3 remaster.

== Reception ==
''Shadow of the Colossus''{{'}}s commercial reception was positive, with sales of 140,000 copies in its first week at retail in Japan, reaching number one in the charts. Almost 80% of the initial Japanese shipment was sold within two days.&lt;ref name="sales"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fahey, Rob | year=2006 | title=Shadow of the Colossus goes in at number one | url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=12757 | work=Games Industry | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080214102739/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=12757 | archivedate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These figures compare favorably with ''Ico'', which was well received by critics but failed to sell a significant number of units.&lt;ref name="sales2"&gt;{{cite web | author=kellercl | year=2006 | title=PS2 Shadow of the Colossus | url=http://sony.controllerfreaks.com/review.asp?RevID=375 | work=ControllerFreaks | accessdate=July 24, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928121147/http://sony.controllerfreaks.com/review.asp?RevID=375 |archivedate = September 28, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was placed on Sony's list of [[List of Sony Greatest Hits games|Greatest Hits]] titles on August 6, 2006.&lt;ref name="greatesthits"&gt;{{cite web | author=Surette, Tim | year=2006 | title=Five added to PS2 Greatest Hits | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/five-added-to-ps2-greatest-hits/1100-6155274/ | work=GameSpot | accessdate=August 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="greatesthits2"&gt;{{cite web | editor=Sony Computer Entertainment staff | year=2006 | title=PlayStation 2 – Greatest Hits | url=http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/GreatestHits | work=PlayStation.com | accessdate=August 4, 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060824233031/http://www.us.playstation.com/PS2/GreatestHits |archivedate = August 24, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike ''Ico'', ''Shadow of the Colossus'' received far more exposure, due in part to Sony putting its weight behind a massive advertising campaign.&lt;ref name="kikizo"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kikizo site staff | year=2006 | title=Colossus Slays EA, Drags Ico Along | url=http://games.kikizo.com/news/200602/118.asp | work=Kikizo | accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was advertised in game magazines, on [[television advertisement|television]] and on the [[Internet marketing|internet]], including a [[viral marketing]] campaign launched in October 2005. The site posted links to several websites claiming that the remains of five giants resembling certain colossi had been discovered in various parts of the world. The website has since been taken down. Some speculate that ''Ico''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s sales figures could have been improved if similar advertising efforts were made before its release.&lt;ref name="eurogamer2"&gt;{{cite web | author=Reed, Kirstan | year=2005 | title=First Impressions – Shadow of the Colossus | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=59445 | work=Euro Gamer | accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Shadow of the Colossus'' received critical acclaim, with an average critic score of 91% at [[GameRankings]],&lt;ref name="gamerankings" /&gt; making it the 11th-highest rated game of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gamerankings: 2005 games organized by score | url=http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?site=&amp;cat=0&amp;year=2005 | accessdate=March 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'', who rated the game 37/40,&lt;ref name=famitsu_overview&gt;{{cite web|title=ワンダと巨像 (PS2)|url=http://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=5|work=Famitsu.com|accessdate=April 29, 2014|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the UK-based ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'', who awarded an 8/10,&lt;ref name="edge"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2005 | editor= of Edge magazine | title=Edge Christmas 2005; issue 157 | pages=98–99 | publisher=Future Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'', who granted 8.8/10.&lt;ref name="egmsoty" /&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s review gave it an 8.7, commenting that "the game's aesthetic presentation is unparalleled, by any standard",&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; while multimedia website [[IGN]] hailed the game as "an amazing experience" and "an absolute must-have title", rating it 9.7/10.&lt;ref name="ignreview"/&gt; [[GameSpy]] described it as "possibly the most innovative and visually arresting game of the year for the PS2".&lt;ref name="gamespyreview" /&gt; A retrospective ''Edge'' article described the game as "a fiction of unquestionable thematic richness, of riveting emotional power, whose fundamental artistic qualities are completely fused with its interactivity."&lt;ref name="edge100"&gt;{{Cite book | year=2007 | title=Edge Presents The 100 Best Videogames | publisher=Future Publishing| page=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Ciccoricco, a literature lecturer at the [[University of Otago]], praised the game for its use of long cutscenes and stretches of riding to make the player engage in self-reflection and feel immersed in the game world.&lt;ref name="ciccoricco"&gt;{{cite book | last=Ciccoricco | first=Dave. | chapter='Play, Memory': ''Shadow of the Colossus'' and Cognitive Workouts | series=Dichtung Digital, Special Edition | title=New Perspectives on Digital Literature | editors=Ennslin, A. and Bell, A. | year=2008 | url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/dichtung-digital/2007/Ciccoricco/ciccoricco.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928052422/http://www.brown.edu/Research/dichtung-digital/2007/Ciccoricco/ciccoricco.htm | archivedate=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many reviewers consider the game's soundtrack to be one of its greatest aspects. In addition to ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''{{'}}s award of "Soundtrack of the Year",&lt;ref name="egmsoty" /&gt; GameSpot commented that the musical score conveyed, and often intensified, the mood of any given situation,&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; while it was described as "one of the finest game soundtracks ever" by a reviewer from [[Eurogamer]].&lt;ref name="eurogamer" /&gt;

However, the game has been criticised for its erratic [[frame rate]], which is usually smooth while traversing the landscape, but often slows down in fast-paced situations, such as colossus battles.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt; Concern was also expressed about the game's camera, which was described by GameSpy as being "as much of an opponent as the Colossi", "manag[ing] to re-center itself at the worst and most inopportune times".&lt;ref name="gamespyreview" /&gt; Reviewers are often mixed about Agro's AI and controls; while gaming website Thunderbolt insists the realism of Agro's movement and behaviour "create[s] a videogame experience unlike any other",&lt;ref name="thunderbolt"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kramer, Josh | year=2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus Review | url=http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/viewreview.php?rid=767 | work=Thunderbolt | accessdate=April 29, 2014 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925180424/http://www.thunderboltgames.com/reviews/viewreview.php?rid=767 | archivedate=September 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Edge'' commented that the controls were "clumsy, crude, and unpredictable".&lt;ref name="edge" /&gt; Other critics like [[Game Revolution]]&lt;ref name="gamerevreview"&gt;{{cite web | first=Ben | last=Silvermen | year=2005 | title=Shadow of the Colossus Review | url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/ps2/adventure/shadow_of_the_colossus.htm | work=Game Revolution | accessdate=January 3, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060202023005/http://www.gamerevolution.com/oldsite/games/ps2/adventure/shadow_of_the_colossus.htm | archivedate=February 2, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and GameSpot felt the game was too short (average playthrough time estimated 6 to 8 hours), with little replay value given the puzzle elements to each colossus battle.&lt;ref name="gamespotreview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gamerevreview" /&gt;

=== Awards ===
''Shadow of the Colossus'' has received several awards, including recognition for "Best Character Design", "Best Game Design", "Best Visual Arts" and "Game of the Year", as well as one of three "Innovation Awards" at the 2006 Game Developers Choice Awards.&lt;ref name="eurogamer3"&gt;{{cite web | author=Fahey, Rob | year=2006 | title=Colossus looms over GDC Awards | url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=63539 | work=Euro Gamer | accessdate=July 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gdc"&gt;{{cite web | author=Thorsen, Tor | year=2006 | title=Colossus casts shadow over GDC Awards | url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/colossus-casts-shadow-over-gdc-awards/1100-6146480/| work=GameSpot | accessdate=July 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2006 [[D.I.C.E.

The game plays a significant role in the 2007 [[Mike Binder]] film ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' as one of the ways [[Adam Sandler]]'s character copes with his primary struggle – with aspects of the game mirroring the tragedy that befell Sandler's character; ''Shadow of the Colossus'' falling giants mirroring the crashing towers of the [[September 11 attacks]] in which his wife and children died, and the game's lead character trying to resurrect his deceased love are two of the main themes which strike a similarity. Sandler is said to have [[ad lib]]bed a detailed description of the control scheme in a scene with [[Don Cheadle]], who plays his old friend.&lt;ref name="reignoverme"&gt;{{cite web| author=Ashcraft, Brian |date=March 22, 2007 |title=Feature: The Colossus and the Comedian |url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/top/feature-the-colossus-and-the-comedian-246286.php |work=[[Kotaku]] |accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both actors are said to have become experts at the game during the filming.&lt;ref name="reignoverme" /&gt;

'''Television in Germany''' began in [[Berlin]] on 22 March 1935, broadcasting for 90 minutes three times a week. It was the first public television station in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=22.3.1935: Erstes Fernsehprogramm der Welt|url=http://www.kalenderblatt.de/index.php?what=thmanu&amp;lang=de&amp;manu_id=1737&amp;sdt=20090322&amp;maca=de-podcast_kalenderblatt-1086-xml-mrss|publisher=''[[Deutsche Welle]]''|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; named ''[[Fernsehsender Paul Nipkow]]''. The German television market had approximately 36.5 million television households in 2000, making it the largest television market in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/topics/telecoms/regulatory/studies/documents/dtv_euro2000.pdf|title=Digital Single Market|website=Digital Single Market|publisher=European Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, 95% of German households have at least one television receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/GesellschaftStaat/EinkommenKonsumLebensbedingungen/AusstattungGebrauchsguetern/Tabellen/Unterhaltungselektronik_D.html|title=Staat &amp; Gesellschaft - Ausstattung mit Gebrauchsgütern - Ausstattung privater Haushalte mit Unterhaltungselektronik - Deutschland - Statistisches Bundesamt (Destatis)|website=www.destatis.de|access-date=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the main German TV channels are [[free-to-air]].

==History==
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F001105-0004, Köln, WDR Fernsehstudio.jpg|thumb|Continuity announcer Gabriela Hellweg at the WDR studios in Cologne (November 1953)]]
{{main article|History of television in Germany|Deutscher Fernsehfunk}}
In 1948 the British occupation forces allowed [[NWDR]] to broadcast television programmes for the British zone. Other regional networks also started to launch television in their own areas. Meanwhile, the GDR was launching its own television service, [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]] (DFF), based on the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] model.

A regular schedule began through the cooperation of all [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] members in 1954. Basic principles in the central areas of entertainment, information and enlightenment were established and television plays developed as the medium's own specific art form. Improvements in technology and programming, as well as reduced prices, led to a steady increase in licence holders, and the number of licenses passed the 1-million mark in October 1957.

On 1 April 1963, the long-promised second TV network, the [[ZDF|Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]] (Second German Television) started. Unlike ARD, which was regionalized and had its roots in radio, ZDF was a centrally organized channel devoted solely to television. On 25 August 1967, at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on both ARD and ZDF, vice chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] started the era of colour TV in [[West Germany]] by pressing a symbolic launch button at the International Radio and TV Fair in West Berlin.

[[East Germany]] started DFF2 in 1969, and introduced colour programming on both channels. In 1972, the DFF was renamed, dropping the pretense of being an all-Germany service and becoming Fernsehen der DDR (GDR Television) or DDR-FS. Its two channels became known as DDR1 and DDR2.

The first two privately financed TV networks, [[RTL Television|RTL plus]] (short for Radio Television Luxemburg) and [[Sat.1|SAT 1]], started their programming in West Germany in 1984. (Previously RTL broadcast from [[Luxembourg]] but was only received in parts of Southwestern Germany).

After [[German reunification|reunification]], the TV stations of the [[German Democratic Republic]] were dissolved and the remnants were used to found new regional networks, e.g. the [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] (Central German Broadcasting), as part of the ARD. In addition, more private TV stations opened, becoming available through cable, satellite and in some cases, over the airwaves.

==Market==
Today, with almost 40 million TV households, 365  TV channels licensed in Germany and a total market volume of €9,615 million in 2008, Germany represents one of the biggest and most diversified TV markets in the world. The strongest revenue segment in Germany is public funding (€4,430 million in 2008), followed by advertising (€4,035 million) and subscription (1,150 € million).&lt;ref name="international-television1"&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/tv-market-germany.html German TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;  This dominant market position of public and advertisement funded free TV channels in Germany explains why the German pay TV segment is significantly underperforming in an international comparison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international-television.org/tv_market_data/international_television_market_report_2009.html Global TV Market Report 2009] International Television Expert Group&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of total TV viewing market share Germany's market leaders in 2017 were again the two biggest [[Public broadcasting|public-service broadcasters]] (ZDF with 13.0% and Das Erste with 11.3%) and the two leading commercial channels (RTL with 9.2% and SAT.1 with 6.7%).&lt;ref name=dwdl /&gt;  The leading pay TV provider was [[Sky Deutschland]] (see below). The biggest teleshopping providers in Germany are QVC and HSE24.

With 18.1 million TV households satellite is the dominant TV infrastructure in Germany, followed by cable (17.9 million TV households) and terrestrial (3.8 million TV households).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Satellitenfernsehen in Deutschland|url=http://www.kabelfernsehen-kabelanschluss.de/artikel/satellitenfernsehen-in-deutschland|publisher=kabelfernsehen-kabelanschluss.de|accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 survey half of German television viewers said they often found nothing to watch on television.&lt;ref&gt;[http://v-net.tv/NewsDisplay.aspx?id=555 Operators need an EPG+ strategy for content discovery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119162745/http://www.v-net.tv/NewsDisplay.aspx?id=555 |date=2011-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[German language|Germanophone]] sphere is the largest market for [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] in Europe. Foreign TV shows and other formats are often dubbed into German, while [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitled]] formats with the original language are also becoming more popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hollywood dubbing: The German Bruce Willis and other invisible stars|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21523643|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2013|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subscription channels===
{{main article|HD+|Sky Deutschland|Kabel Deutschland}}

Germany's sole subscription channel Premiere had its heyday around the millennium. Premiere offered telecasts of the German football league – the [[Bundesliga]], but they lost the broadcasting rights in 2006 to a newly formed competitor – [[Arena (pay television network)|Arena]]. Premiere was the brainchild of the former television czar, [[Leo Kirch]]. He went into insolvency after a decade of losing viewers from his subscription channel, DF1 (Digital TV 1). The company regained some ground with its new manager [[Georg Kofler]].{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 2005, several German cable companies created a new challenger to Premiere - ARENA. The participating companies are [[iesy]] (Hesse) and [[ish (TV)]] (North Rhine-Westphalia) through their combined partnership called "[[Unity Media]]". Arena, a rather small company, wanted to buy the pay-TV rights to the German Bundesliga and won by a decision of the marketing directorate of the [[Deutsche Fußball Liga|DFL]]. The rights to broadcast the Bundesliga is regarded as lucrative in the German television market, so previous rights holders Premiere suffered a wounding blow to their business model. Arena held the rights from 2006 to 2008. Further negotiations were due in 2008 for the broadcasting of the [[Bundesliga]].

==Public broadcasters==
[[File:ARD Karte.svg|280px|thumb|ARD member broadcaster map.]]
{{main article|ARD (broadcaster)|ZDF}}
As stated above, the ARD was the first German broadcasting station. It has a federally orientated structure. At present, nine regional TV stations cooperate to produce programs for the TV network known as ''[[Das Erste]]'' (''The First''):

* [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk]] – ''North German Broadcasting'' – [[Hamburg]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]
* [[Radio Bremen]] – also a television broadcaster – [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]
* [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg]] – ''Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting'' – [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]]
* [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk]] – ''Central German Broadcasting'' – [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]
* [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]] – ''West German Broadcasting'' – [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]
* [[Hessischer Rundfunk]] – ''Hessian Broadcasting'' – [[Hesse]]
* [[Südwestrundfunk]] – ''South Western Broadcasting'' – [[Baden-Württemberg]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]
* [[Saarländischer Rundfunk]] – ''Saarland Broadcasting'' – [[Saarland]]
* [[Bayerischer Rundfunk]] – ''Bavarian Broadcasting'' – [[Bavaria]]

Seven of these broadcasters run their own regional TV programs (''The Third''), most of them use several frequencies and show local opt-outs.
While multi-state-broadcasters NDR, RBB, MDR and SWR have state versions (e.g. RBB Berlin, MDR Sachsen, NDR Hamburg), BR and WDR have regional opt-outs below state level (BR: North and South, WDR: 11 versions).
Some small regions, such as Bremen (RB) and the Saarland (SR), have their own broadcasting stations, mainly for historical reasons. They only contribute to the nationwide TV program ''Das Erste'' and produce a state opt-out for their neighbour broadcaster (SR-Fernsehen on SWR, Radio Bremen TV on NDR).

* The ARD also owns the following channels: [[tagesschau24]], [[ARD-alpha]], [[One (German TV channel)|One]], [[Deutsche Welle]], [[EinsPlus]] (closed in 2016)
* The ZDF also owns the following channels: [[ZDFinfo]], [[ZDFneo]], [[ZDFkultur]] (closed in 2016)
* The ARD and the ZDF co-owns the following channels: [[KiKa]], [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]], [[3sat]], [[Arte]]
* The ARD and the ZDF also co-own [[Deutschlandradio]] and its channels [[Deutschlandfunk]], [[Deutschlandfunk Kultur]], Deutschlandfunk Nova, Dokumente&amp;Debatten

===Satellite===
Digital satellite television has been officially available in Germany since 1996. Prior to May 2012, most of the 30+ TV stations broadcast their ''satellite'' signal using both analogue and digital (DVB-S); however, all analogue satellite broadcasts ceased on 30 April 2012.

There is currently a single pay TV satellite operator in Germany - [[Sky Deutschland]]. Prior to being known as Sky, the service was named Premiere;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/wirtschaft/0,1518,623512,00.html|title=Premiere soll künftig Sky Deutschland heißen|date=13 February 2010|publisher=spiegel-online.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; it (along with its former owner [[Leo Kirch]]) got into serious financial trouble due to its early and proprietary usage of encryption (Betacrypt, D-box). Subsequently, Premiere was bought by [[News Corporation]] and renamed Sky, in keeping with their satellite services elsewhere in Europe ([[Sky (UK and Ireland)]] and [[Sky Italia]]).

;HDTV via satellite
In late 2004 German channel group [[ProSieben]] showed a [[BBC]] documentary and a self-produced TV movie in [[1080i]] via [[MPEG-2]] [[DVB-S]], followed by the Hollywood films ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Men in Black II]]'' in March 2005. These were intended to be a test for future commercial HD services.

Regular [[free to air]] broadcast of the HD versions of [[ProSieben]] and [[Sat.1]] began on 26 October 2005. Unlike the test broadcasts, [[DVB-S2]] and [[MPEG-4 AVC]] were used. Both ProSieben HD and Sat.1 HD ceased their unencrypted broadcasts in 2008; encrypted HD broadcasting of both channels resumed under the [[HD+]] brand (which also included other commercial channels; see below) in January 2010.

Premiere, after several delays, started broadcasting three HD channels — one each dedicated to [[film]]s, [[sport]]s and [[Documentary film|documentaries]] — in November 2005, although there were virtually no suitable, certified receivers available on the market. The content was also sparse and thus often repeated. Sky (formerly Premiere) reuses its proprietary [[digital rights management]] system embedded into its content scrambling system ([[Nagravision]]) from SD broadcasts&lt;!--probably not 100% correct--&gt; to block analogue output of the movie channel from the receiving [[set-top box]] altogether, only allowing [[HDCP]]-secured transmissions; the other channels are less restricted.

On 1 November 2009 the premium [[HD+]] service launched with two channels, RTL HD and Vox HD, with Sat.1 HD, ProSieben HD and [[Kabel eins]] HD joining the service in January 2010. DSF HD (now called Sport1 HD) began test broadcasts in August 2010 and launched fully on HD+ on 1 November 2010, followed by Sixx HD  and RTL2 HD on 1 December 2010. In June 2011, Comedy Central HD, Nickelodeon HD and N24 HD joined service, bringing the number of channels offered to 11. In April 2011, HD+ became available to Sky Deutschland subscribers without the need for an HD+ [[conditional-access module|CAM]] and viewing card (although an additional subscription is still required).

Currently (as of May 2012) all satellite HDTV channels are broadcast using the [[h.264]] codec. As of July 2014, most material is upscaled SD content.

;Free-to-air HDTV via satellite
Prior to 30 April 2012 there were eight free-to-air HDTV channels originating in Germany broadcast via satellite: Das Erste HD, ZDF HD, Arte HD, Anixe HD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadgethd.com/2008/02/16/sat-1-hd-and-prosieben-hd-go-offline-til-2010-in-germany/|title=Sat.1 HD and ProSieben HD go offline until 2010 in Germany - Engadget HD|work=Engadget HD|date=16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; EinsFestival HD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einsfestival.de/was_ist_einsfestival/hdtv_in_einsfestival.jsp|title=HDTV in Einsfestival {{!}} Einsfestival|language=German|accessdate={{Date|2012-04-08}}|publisher=ARD|work=EinsFestival|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509224155/http://www.einsfestival.de/was_ist_einsfestival/hdtv_in_einsfestival.jsp|archive-date=2012-05-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sonnenklar.TV]] HD, QVC HD and HSE24 HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalfernsehen.de/Astra-Sonnenklar-TV-ab-September-in-HD-frei-empfangbar.64105.0.html|title=Astra: Sonnenklar TV ab September in HD frei empfangbar - DIGITALFERNSEHEN.de|trans-title=Astra: Sonnenklar TV available in HD for free from September - DIGITALFERNSEHEN.de|language=German|date={{Date|2011-08-19}}|accessdate={{Date|2012-04-08}}|work=Digitalfernsehen.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 30 April 2012, when all analogue satellite broadcasts ceased, ten additional FTA HD channels became available (all of which are [[public broadcasting|public service]] channels): [[Phoenix (German TV station)|Phoenix]] HD, [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] HD, [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] HD, [[Bayerischer Rundfunk|BR]] HD, [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]] HD, [[ZDFneo]] HD, [[ZDFinfo]] HD, [[ZDFkultur]] HD, [[3sat]] HD and [[KiKa]] HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kabel-internet-telefon.de/news/36645-zdfneo-3sat-br-ndr-swr-wdr-phoenix-kika-starten-hd-kanaele|title=ZDFneo, 3sat, BR, NDR, SWR, WDR, Phoenix, KiKa starten HD Kanäle|language=German|trans-title=ZDFneo, 3sat, BR, NDR, SWR, WDR, Phoenix, KiKa launch HD channels|date={{Date|2012-03-13}}|accessdate={{Date|2012-04-08}}|work=kabel-internet-telefon.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital.t-online.de/hdtv-neue-hd-kanaele-von-ard-und-zdf-ab-30-april-2012/id_53311006/index|title=HDTV: Neue HD-Kanäle von ARD und ZDF ab 30.

From December 2013 on all PSB channels except ARD-alpha, SR Fernsehen and Radio Bremen TV are available in HD.

===Cable===
Cable transmission is still mostly analog with usually about 30 available channels. DVB-C transmission started in 2004 with [[Pay television|pay TV]] Premiere and digital versions of the analogue channels.

The rather late changeover to DVB was caused both by the long process of selling the infrastructure of former monopolist [[Deutsche Telekom]] to others and the fact that the cable network ends at the curb or property, with the in-house cable in large apartment buildings being operated by a different company. Due to this, the new owners of Deutsche Telekom's cable network were in many cases not able to offer new products directly to the viewer.

By 2006, there were three major cable operators, Unity Media in [[Hesse]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] and [[Baden-Württemberg]] and by far the largest, [[Kabel Deutschland]] in the other 13 states. Today, all companies offer about 200 TV channels by DVB-C, which includes some 70 channels at no extra charge as well as a number of [[pay-per-view]] offers and subscription-based packages (like the HD-broadcasts of privately owned channels, comparable to HD+ on satellite). In addition to that pay TV broadcaster [[Sky Deutschland]] is also available.

In some very large apartment complexes a number of local and national companies operate an in-house cable network which is fed solely by its own satellite antenna on the building, not the local cable operator. The satellite channels are either transcoded into analogue transmission, receivable by any TV set without extra equipment, or into DVB-C.

As of 2014, still 17.2% of Germany transmits television with analogue cable signals, compared to 29.1% of digital cable; this similar to the situation in the [[Netherlands]], [[Sweden]] and [[Belgium]], where analogue cable is also still widely used.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.die-medienanstalten.de/fileadmin/Download/Publikationen/Digitalisierungsbericht/2014/Digitalisierungsbericht_2014_Daten_und_Fakten.pdf Digitalisierungsbericht 2014 - Daten und Fakten&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrestrial===
Terrestrial reception had lost most of its users by the 1990s{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} due to extensive cable and satellite coverage. In a two step process analogue terrestrial TV broadcasting in the states of [[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]] was switched off in 2003 and replaced by [[DVB-T]], in 2005, about two-third of Germany's states began to replace analogue transmission. By 2006, all metropolitan and most rural areas had moved to digital transmission. Today, only foreign army bases and some local TV stations still broadcast on analogue.

While the public broadcasters [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]] transmit throughout Germany, commercial stations often are only available within metropolitan areas, so the number of available channels varies between about 10 and 30. All DVB-T1 channels were [[free-to-air]] and the broadcasters rented transmission services directly from a transmitter operator, usually [[Media Broadcast]]. ARD stations also use their own transmitters.

In June 2016, a gradual switch-over from [[DVB-T]] with [[MPEG-2]] encoding to [[DVB-T2]] with [[HEVC]] encoding has commenced. The first phase included one new multiplex broadcasting six channels in selected urban areas, in addition to the old DVB-T standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.media-broadcast.com/uploads/media/Tabelle_Senderstandorte_DVB-T2HD_Erste-Stufe_22032016.pdf|title=List of sites for the DVB-T2 HD preview mux|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DVB-T2 channels are broadcasting in 1080p50.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalfernsehen.de/DVB-T2-HD-ARD-vorerst-nur-hochskaliertes-Full-HD.138903.0.html|title=DVB-T2 HD: ARD vorerst nur hochskaliertes Full HD|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial channels are encrypted and part of the "Freenet TV"-Package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teltarif.de/dvb-t2-freenet-tv-start/news/63743.html|title=DVB-T2: Private Programme werden als Freenet-TV vermarktet|last=Weidner|first=Markus|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final switch-over to DVB-T2 occurred in steps, starting with major metropolitan areas who switched on 29 March 2017. The last transmitter is planned to switch in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dvb-t2hd.de/programme|title=DVB-T2 HD - offizielles Informationsportal|newspaper=DVB-T2 HD - offizielles Informationsportal|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Series==
Almost all fictional programs on German television are regular TV series. While the public broadcaster(s) predominantly own(s) the productions that are broadcast, the private stations/networks often put on series licensed from abroad, mainly the United States. Peaking in the 1990s, the private channels had aired self-produced series such as ''[[Der Clown]]'' (1996–2000), ''[[Alarm für Cobra 11 – Die Autobahnpolizei]]'' (Alarm for Cobra 11 - The Motorway Police) (since 1996), ''The Sentinel'' (1994–1996), ''Alpha Team - The Lifesaver in OP'' (1996–2005) or ''Wolff's Turf'' (mainly from 1992 to 2006) with great success. Since the late 2000s, the amount of original series on the private broadcasters has markedly declined.

The highest-rated series is the crime drama ''[[Tatort]]'', which airs almost every Sunday on public broadcaster [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]]. It has run since 1970 and has featured several casts, that are not related to each other.

'''''The Adventures of Pussycat''''' was a [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] [[comic book|comics magazine]] that reprinted the risqué, black-and-white feature "Pussycat" that ran throughout various [[men's adventure]] magazines published by [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s [[Magazine Management Company]] in the 1960s. The feature's creative staff came largely from Magazine Management's sister company, [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==

===Men's magazine feature===
A [[bawdy]] but non-[[pornographic]], tongue-in-cheek [[secret agent]] comics feature, "Pussycat" was launched following the success of [[Harvey Kurtzman]] and [[Will Elder]]'s color comics feature "[[Little Annie Fanny]]", published in ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' magazine from 1962 to the 1980s.&lt;ref name=hembeck&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Fred Hembeck|last=Hembeck|first=Fred|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624620p1.html|title=Marvel's Pussycat Adventures|publisher=The Fred Hembeck Show (column), Episode 14, [[IGN|IGN.com]]|page=[http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624620p2.html 2]|date=June 14, 2005|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rS787ged?url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/624/624620p1.html|archivedate=July 24, 2010|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-established comic-book artist [[Wally Wood]] &amp;mdash; whose own similar 1968-1974 ''[[Sally Forth (Wally Wood)|Sally Forth]]'' would run in [[armed services]] publications &amp;mdash; created the 1965 premiere, in which Pussycat, a secretary for S.C.O.R.E. (Secret Council of Ruthless Extroverts) is recruited to fight the agency's archenemsis, L.U.S.T.&lt;ref name=hembeck /&gt; Artist [[Jim Mooney]] retouched over Wood's work for the reprint in the 1968 stand-alone issue.&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt;

The feature premiered in ''Male Annual'' #3 (1965), and ran in at least ''Male Annual'' #4-5 (1966–1967), ''[[Stag (magazine)|Stag Annual]]'' #3 (1966), and in issues of ''Men'' and ''Stag''.&lt;ref name= gcd /&gt;

As Mooney recalled in 2000, "[I]n the early '70s, I did work for Goodman's men's magazines, a strip called 'Pussycat'. [[Stan Lee|Stan [Lee]]] wrote the first one I did, and then his brother [[Larry Lieber|Larry [Lieber]]] wrote the ones that came later".&lt;ref name="cba"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07mooney.html |title=Jim Mooney Over Marvel: From Terrytoons to Omega the Unknown, Jim talks Comics|work=[[Comic Book Artist]]|number=7|date=February 2000 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110514004526/http://www.twomorrows.com/comicbookartist/articles/07mooney.html| archivedate= May 14, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The later strips abandoned this "ditzy spy" format and turned her into a savvy investigative reporter, who continually managed to find herself in situations where her clothes were torn off, voluntarily removed, or otherwise caused to "be elsewhere" by various events and situations. Usually, this was played to her advantage, as she used the distractions to stop the nefarious plots of the bad guys and get her story.

Other talent from Goodman's [[Marvel Comics]] who contributed to the ''Pussycat'' series include writer [[Ernie Hart]], and artists [[Al Hartley]] and [[Bill Everett]]. Contributing separately was the notable "[[good girl art]]" [[cartoonist]] [[Bill Ward (cartoonist)|Bill Ward]].

===Comics magazine===
Eight five-page episodes were collected in a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]], black-and-white [[comic book|comics magazine]] [[cover-date]]d October 1968, and titled ''The Adventures of Pussycat'' on its [[trademark]]ed cover logo and simply ''Pussycat'' in the copyright information in its postal [[Indicia (publishing)|indicia]].&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/203763/ ''Pussycat''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110628221415/http://www.comics.org/issue/203763/ Archived] from the original June 28, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover price of 35 cents&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; matched that of the same publisher's black-and-white [[Marvel Comics]] magazine ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', released the same year but with an original, newly published story.

The one-shot has no ads except a back-cover advertisement for Jade East [[cologne]]. It also contains an unclothed but non-nude centerfold. In addition to seven reprinted stories, the comic included an original five-page Pussycat tale, "The Hidden Hippie Caper", by writer [[Larry Lieber]] and artist [[Jim Mooney]].&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

Larry Graber is credited as the comic book's art director, and Lew Holloway as associate art director.&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

'''The Call to Poetry''' was a one-night [[performance art]] / international poetry gathering event held April 5, 2012 in [[Istanbul]], near [[Taksim Square]], widely promoted and heavily attended by international poets to celebrate the [[history of poetry]] with a dramatic reading of the world’s oldest love poem, which is housed in the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Istanbul to host celebration of world’s oldest love poem|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-276386-istanbul-to-host-celebration-of-worlds-oldest-love-poem.html|newspaper=Today's Zaman|date=April 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem was intended for a spring fertility ritual and recited by one of his brides.&lt;ref name="Guinness World Records 2007. Guinness World Records Limited, 2006."&gt;{{cite book|title=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab Spring Poetry ==
The Call to Poetry featured readings from contemporary Egyptian poet Hesham Al-Gak, a 2011 contestant on the Arab world's popular [[American Idol]]-style TV program based in [[Abu Dhabi]] called ''[[Prince of Poets]]''. During the Egyptian revolution, Al-Gak used the competition to recite poems critical of Egyptian leaders and departed ''Prince of Poets'''s Abu Dhabi studios to visit [[Cairo]]  to compose and recite verse at the height of protests there.

== Event Organizers ==
Call to Poetry organizer, American writer Dan Boylan cited [[Beat Generation]] figure [[Allen Ginsberg]] as an influence on the evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrating the World’s Oldest Love Poem in Istanbul on April 5th, 2012|url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/news/133112/celebrating-the-world’s-oldest-love-poem-in-istanbul-on-april-5th-2012-.html|publisher=The Turkish Weekly Journal|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having met Ginsberg as a teenager, Boylan premiered Istanbul-inspired [[sound poetry]] during the event, which included music and an over-capacity crowd that listened from outside the venue. American journalist David Trilling served as the first Call to Poetry's master of ceremonies and New Zealand Poet Fred Simpon released his book of verse, “Lucky Me!” during the event.

'''''The Stereo Record Guide''''' is a series of nine classical [[discography|discographies]] published by the Long Playing Record Library in [[Blackpool]] from 1960-1974.

When volume 1 was published in late 1960, the majority of classical records issued were [[monaural]].  The authors were supportive of the new [[stereophonic sound|stereophonic recordings]]. Their first sentence stated “Let us begin by stating, unequivocally that good stereo on quite modest equipment is infinitely superior, domestically, to any other form of sound reproduction”.

The arrangement of the discographies is alphabetical by composer, except that volume 9 covers anthologies (orchestral music, instrumental music, vocal music, and humour on records) and is organised by artist.

Recordings receive brief critical reviews which consider the music, performance standards, and recorded sound.  Manufacturers catalogue numbers are included. Records are rated with a star system from *** to *.

Four reviewers compiled these books: [[Edward Greenfield]], Ivan March, [[Denis Stevens]], and [[Robert Layton (musicologist)|Robert Layton]].  Layton joined the reviewers with volume 5-6 (1968), and Stevens left the project after those volumes were published (he died in 2004).

Two volumes titled ''[[A Guide to Bargain Classics]]'' (1962-1964) were also compiled by these authors and published by the Long Playing Record Library.

[[Penguin Books]] published three volumes of guides to bargain records (1966, 1970 and 1972).

[[Penguin Books]] took over publication of these discographies in 1975, starting with the ''[[The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music|Penguin Stereo Record Guide]]''.  Four decades after the first publication; Greenfield, March, and Layton continued to review thousands of recordings.
