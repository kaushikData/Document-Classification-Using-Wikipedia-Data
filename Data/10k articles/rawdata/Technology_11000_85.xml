      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4398">'''Activation energy asymptotics''' ('''AEA''' or also known as '''Large activation energy asymptotics''') is an [[asymptotic analysis]] used in the [[combustion]] field utilizing the fact that the [[reaction rate]] is extremely sensitive to temperature changes due to the large [[activation energy]] of the chemical reaction. 

==History==
The techniques were pioneered by the [[Russian people|Russian]] scientists [[Yakov Borisovich Zel'dovich]], [[David A. Frank-Kamenetskii]] and co-workers in the 30s, in their study on [[premixed flames]]&lt;ref&gt;Y.B. Zel’dovich and D.A. Frank-Kamenetskii,Theory  of  uniform  propagation  of  flame,Zh. Fiz. Khim+. 12 (1938), pp. 100–105.&lt;/ref&gt; and thermal explosions ([[Frank-Kamenetskii theory]]), but not popular to western scientists until the 70s. In the early 70s, due to the pioneering work of Williams B. Bush, Francis E. Fendell&lt;ref&gt;Bush, W. B., &amp; Fendell, F. E. (1970). Asymptotic analysis of laminar flame propagation for general Lewis numbers. Combustion Science and Technology, 1(6), 421-428.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Forman A. Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1971). Theory of combustion in laminar flows. Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics, 3(1), 171-188.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Amable Liñán]]&lt;ref&gt;Liñán, A. (1971). A theoretical analysis of premixed flame propagation with an isothermal chain reaction. AFOSR Contract No. E00AR68-0031, 1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Linan, A. (1974). The asymptotic structure of counterflow diffusion flames for large activation energies. Acta Astronautica, 1(7-8), 1007-1039.&lt;/ref&gt;, it became popular in western community and since then it was widely used to explain more complicated problems in combustion.&lt;ref&gt;Buckmaster, J. D., &amp; Ludford, G. S. S. (1982). Theory of laminar flames. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Method overview==
In combustion processes, the reaction rate &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; in the following form ([[Arrhenius law]]),

:&lt;math&gt;v(T) \propto \mathrm{e}^{-E_{\rm a}/RT},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm a}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[activation energy]], and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gas constant]]. In general, the condition &lt;math&gt;E_{\rm a}/R \gg T_b&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied, where &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm b}&lt;/math&gt; is the burnt gas temperature. This condition forms the basis for activation energy asymptotics. Denoting &lt;math&gt;T_{\rm u}&lt;/math&gt; for unburnt gas temperature, one can define the [[Zel'dovich number]] and [[heat release parameter]] as follows

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{E_{\rm a}}{RT_{\rm b}}\frac{T_{\rm b}-T_{\rm u}}{T_{\rm b}}, \quad \alpha = \frac{T_{\rm b}-T_{\rm u}}{T_{\rm b}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, if we define a non-dimensional temperature 

:&lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{T-T_{\rm u}}{T_{\rm b}-T_{\rm u}},&lt;/math&gt;

such that &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; approaching zero in the unburnt region and approaching unity in the burnt gas region (in other words, &lt;math&gt;0\leq\theta\leq 1&lt;/math&gt;), then the ratio of reaction rate at any temperature to reaction rate at burnt gas temperature is given by&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (2018). Combustion theory. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{v(T)}{v(T_{\rm b})} \propto \frac{\mathrm{e}^{-E_{\rm a}/RT}}{\mathrm{e}^{-E_{\rm a}/RT_{\rm b}}} = \exp \left[\frac{-\beta(1-\theta)}{1-\alpha(1-\theta)}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

Now in the limit of &lt;math&gt;\beta\rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; (large activation energy) with &lt;math&gt;\alpha\sim O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, the reaction rate is exponentially small i.e., &lt;math&gt;O(e^{-\beta})&lt;/math&gt; and negligible everywhere, but non-negligible when &lt;math&gt;\beta(1-\theta) \sim O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the reaction rate is negligible everywhere, except in a small region very close to burnt gas temperature, where &lt;math&gt;1-\theta \sim O(1/\beta)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, in solving the conservation equations, one identifies two different regimes, at leading order,

*Outer convective-diffusive zone
*Inner reactive-diffusive layer

where in the convective-diffusive zone, reaction term will be neglected and in the thin reactive-diffusive layer, convective terms can be neglected and the solutions in these two regions are stitched together by matching slopes using [[method of matched asymptotic expansions]]. The above mentioned two regime are true only at leading order since the next order corrections may involve all the three transport mechanisms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5410">[[Image:Pentecost Backpack Helicopter.JPG|thumb|right|The [[Pentecost HX-1 Hoppi-Copter]], a functional backpack helicopter]]

A '''backpack helicopter''' is a [[helicopter]] motor and [[helicopter rotor|rotor]] and controls assembly that can be strapped to a person's back, so he can walk about on the ground wearing it, and can use it to fly. It uses a [[Safety harness|harness]] like a [[parachute]] harness and should have a strap between the legs (so the pilot does not fall out of the harness during flight). Some designs may use a [[ducted fan]] design to increase upward [[thrust]]. Several inventors have tried to make backpack helicopters, with mixed results.

Typically, a backpack helicopter differs from a conventional helicopter in two main ways:

First, there is no tail rotor, and the main rotors are [[contra-rotating]]. Yaw is controlled by fine adjustment of a differential gear in the rotor drive transmission. When one rotor is adjusted to spin slightly faster than the other, it induces yaw (turning motion).

Second, the rotors are fixed pitch, which assists with simplicity; this means, however, that in the event of engine failure [[autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] is impossible. Usually, a [[ballistic parachute]] would be incorporated for safety.

An edition of ''[[Popular Science]]'' magazine in 1969 featured a backpack helicopter that used small jet engines in a [[tip jet]] configuration instead of [[contra-rotating]] rotors.  This design could function in autorotation. Related are devices like a backpack helicopter which also include a seat and leg supports, which are small, open-topped  helicopters. In theory, a helicopter would be more efficient than a rocket-powered [[jetpack]], possessing a greater [[specific impulse]], and being more suited to hovering, due to the lower velocities of the propelled gases.

'''Bruker Corporation''' is a manufacturer of scientific instruments for molecular and materials research, as well as for industrial and applied analysis. It is headquartered in [[Billerica, Massachusetts]] and is the publicly traded parent company of Bruker Scientific Instruments (Bruker AXS, Bruker BioSpin, Bruker Daltonics and Bruker Optics) and Bruker Energy &amp; Supercon Technologies (BEST) divisions.

In April 2010, Bruker created a Chemical Analysis Division (headquartered in Fremont, CA) under the Bruker Daltonics subsidiary. This division contains three former Varian product lines: [[ICPMS]] systems, laboratory [[gas chromatography]] (GC), and GC-[[triple quadrupole mass spectrometer]] (originally designed by Bear Instruments and acquired by Varian in 2001).

In 2012 it sponsored the [[Fritz Feigl Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asac.at/Index.aspx?site=1&amp;main=84&amp;sub=0&amp;content=313|title=Fritz-Feigl-Preis|author=|date=|website=www.asac.at|accessdate=6 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 1999 the company has also sponsored the [[Günther Laukien Prize]].&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"/&gt;

==History==
The company was founded on September 7, 1960, in [[Karlsruhe]], Germany&lt;ref name="Burgäzy"/&gt; as ''Bruker-Physik [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]''&lt;ref name="Ernst2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ernst|first1=Richard R.|title=The Günther Laukien Prize|journal=Journal of Magnetic Resonance|volume=173|issue=2|year=2005|pages=188–191|issn=1090-7807|doi=10.1016/j.jmr.2005.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; by five people, one of them being [[Günther Laukien]], who was a professor at the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology|University of Karlsruhe]] at the time. The name ''Bruker'' originates from co-founder [[Emil Bruker]], as Günther Laukien himself was formally not allowed to commercialize his research whilst being a professor.&lt;ref name="Burgäzy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://xray.chem.wisc.edu/Resources/Meetings/Bruker18/01_welcome%20scd%20user%20meeting%20bio.pdf |format=PDF |title=17th Bruker Users' Group Meeting 2010 Single Crystal X-ray Diffraction |first=Frank |last=Burgäzy |date=21 September 2010 |publisher=Bruker AXS |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6fsZchyBg?url=http://xray.chem.wisc.edu/Resources/Meetings/Bruker18/01_welcome%20scd%20user%20meeting%20bio.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-09 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruker produced [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy]] (NMR) and [[Electromagnetic radiation|EMR]] spectroscopy equipment then. In the early 1960s, the company had around 60 employees and was growing rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gareth R Eaton|author2=Sandra S Eaton|author3=Kev M Salikhov|title=Foundations of Modern EPR|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PBjtCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA718|date=8 May 1998|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4496-81-0|page=718}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early success products was the HFX 90 NMR spectroscopy system, with three independent channels and which was also the first NMR system using only semiconductor transistors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laboratoryequipment.com/articles/2013/06/1960s|title=The 1960s|quote=Bruker ultimately introduced the first fully transistorized NMR instrument, the HFX 90, the first of which was delivered to the Technical Univ. of Berlin.|first=Michelle|last=Longo|publisher=Laboratory Equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, Bruker launched the first commercial [[Fourier transform]] NMR spectroscopy system (FT-NMR) and in the 1970s the company was the first to commercialize a [[superconducting]] FT-NMR. Later, the company would expand their product range with [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging|MRI]], [[Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy|FTIR]] and FT-[[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] spectrometers and with [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrometers]].&lt;ref name="theresonance"/&gt;

In 1968, Bruker shipped NMR systems to [[Yale University]] in [[Connecticut]]. After that, demand from the US grew, so Bruker opened an office in [[Elmsford, New York]] which marked the start of their US activities.&lt;ref name="Burgäzy"/&gt; In 2008 after a corporate reorganization lasting 8 years, all divisions were merged in a unified Bruker Corporation.&lt;ref name="Burgäzy"/&gt;

'''CLARIN''' is a European research network working in the field of archiving and processing of language-related resources in the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]]. 

CLARIN is an [[acronym]] for ''Common Language Resources and Technology Infrastructure''. CLARIN is a community of scholars of various disciplines and a network of institutions. The scholars use CLARIN as a forum for joined developments and exchange of resources. They also exchange information on [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[Standard Operating Procedure|procedure]]s for long time [[archiving]] of research data. The institutions of CLARIN offer services in the same field. 

On the European level, CLARIN is an independent body operating under [[European law]] as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium|European Research Infrastructure Community]] (ERIC). CLARIN ERIC represents the CLARIN community in the public and coordinates individual efforts in the field.

CLARIN is listed in the [[Registry of Research Data Repositories]] re3data.org.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CLARIN entry in re3data.org|url=http://service.re3data.org/repository/r3d100010209|website=www.re3data.org|accessdate=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

([https://www.clarin.eu/sites/default/files/EH%2BSK-CLARIN.bib_.txt BiBTeX])

== Objective ==
CLARIN's objective is to provide a research infrastructure for researchers of the humanities and social sciences working with language related material. The network should allow the persistent storage and access to the data in an archive, to disseminate the material and to reuse it in other research contexts. By exchanging material, effects of synergy are achieved by not duplicating work and participating at each other's development. Additionally new research questions can follow and the material can be used for quality assurance in the research process. 
By offering depositing services, tutorials and support for archiving, special search engines for language resources and web based analysis systems the infrastructure becomes usable for the research community.

'''CLARIN Vision'''

All digital language resources and tools from all over Europe and beyond are accessible through a single sign-on online environment for the support of researchers in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Mission'''

Create and maintain an infrastructure to support the sharing, use and sustainability of language data and tools for research in the humanities and social sciences.

'''CLARIN Value proposition'''

CLARIN makes digital language resources available to scholars, researchers, students, and citizen-scientists from all disciplines, especially in the humanities and social sciences, through single sign-on access. CLARIN offers long-term solutions and technology services for deploying, connecting, analysing and sustaining digital language data and tools. CLARIN supports scholars who want to engage in cutting edge data-driven research, contributing to a truly multilingual European Research Area.

For details please see: [https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition CLARIN Value proposition, 2017].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.clarin.eu/value-proposition|title=Value Proposition {{!}} CLARIN ERIC|website=www.clarin.eu|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services offered ==
CLARIN offers a wide range of services to the research community, for example:
* Virtual Language Observatory,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/vlo Virtual Language Observatory]&lt;/ref&gt; a special search engine for language resources available to the academic community via CLARIN
* Depositing services,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.clarin.eu/content/depositing-services Depositing Services]&lt;/ref&gt; where scholars can deposit their own language related materials resulting from academic research processes 
* Web based analysis tools&lt;ref&gt;[http://weblicht.sfs.uni-tuebingen.de/weblichtwiki/index.php/Main_Page Web based analysis tools]&lt;/ref&gt; (webservices), offering software from computational linguistics for the academic community.

In addition to such technical services, tutorials are prepared, standards and processes developed and implemented. Researchers receive support in the archiving process, for example by reference material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.dwds.de/clarin/userguide/text/ CLARIN User handbook by CLARIN-D]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
The majority of operations, services and centres of the CLARIN infrastructure is provided and funded by CLARIN ERICmembers (and observers). Members and observers can be countries or intergovernmental organizations. They set up a national consortium, typically consisting of universities, research institutions, libraries and public archives, of which at least one has the status of CLARIN centre (see [https://www.clarin.eu/content/overview-clarin-centres overview of CLARIN centres]). The contribution expected from members and observers is to create and provide access to digital language data collections, and digital tools and expertise for researchers to work with them.

Below is the list of current CLARIN ERIC members, observers and third parties:

'''Members:'''
* [[Austria]]
* [[Bulgaria]]
*[[Croatia]]
* [[Czech Republic]]
* [[Denmark]]
* [[Estonia]]
* [[Finland]]
* [[Germany]]
* [[Greece]]
* [[Hungary]] 
* [[Italy]]
* [[Latvia]]
* [[Lithuania]]
* [[Netherlands]]
* [[Norway]] 
* [[Poland]]
* [[Portugal]]
* [[Slovenia]]
* [[Sweden]]

The [[Dutch Language Union]] (DLU) is an [[intergovernmental organization]] and member of CLARIN as well.

'''Observers:'''
* [[France]] 
* [[United Kingdom]]

'''Third party:'''
* Carnegie Mellon University (US)

== Type of organization ==
The CLARIN consortium is organized as a [[European Research Infrastructure Consortium]] (ERIC) under [[European law]], which is a special type of organization created for [[research infrastructures]].
It is hence part of the activities in the [[European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures]] ([http://www.esfri.eu/ ESFRI]) context.

== Government ==
On the European level CLARIN is governed by the following structures:

* CLARIN General Assembly: Assembly of all members of CLARIN ERIC, represented by a delegate of the appropriate ministries. There is one delegate per country who may bring a subject matter expert.
* CLARIN Board of Directors: Assembly of the directors for coordinating the committees, serving as contact points and for the administration of the consortium. It is the highest body outside of the General Assembly. The directors are nominated by the General Assembly. The chair persons of the National Coordinators' Forum and of the Standing Committee of CLARIN Technical centers are ex officio members of the Board of Directors.
* CLARIN National Coordinators' Forum: committee of national subject matter experts with one delegate per member. 
* CLARIN Standing Committee of Technical Centers (also: ''Centre Committee'' or ''SCCTC''): Delegates of the different CLARIN centres.
* CLARIN Scientific Advisory Board: consulting body of international experts who are not part of CLARIN but nominated by the General Assembly. 
* Other consulting committees as needed. At the moment there is the CLARIN Legal Issues Committee, (CLIC) and the CLARIN Standards Committee.

The seat of CLARIN ERIC is at the [[University of Utrecht]] with the office of the Executive Director. The staff of the office and all other institutions works distributed, the participants can be from all EU countries, and the staff may work from their home institutions.

Every member has a national CLARIN partner organization, often organized as national project networks. Every member supports at least one CLARIN centre, providing a repository for the [[humanities]] and [[social sciences]] scholar working with language oriented research data. Often these centres offer additional technical services and some [[webservice]]s beyond the national community.

Scholars of the CLARIN community meet every year for the CLARIN Annual Meeting. For this every member may send delegates, experts from CLARIN centres. These meetings are also used for the committees to report on their progress and inform about new developments.

[[File:BVI 2009-273 (3692273152).jpg|right|thumb|A Raymarine chartplotter.]]
A '''Chartplotter''' is a device used in marine [[navigation]] that integrates [[GPS]] data with an [[Electronic navigational chart| electronic navigational chart (ENC)]]. 

The chartplotter displays the ENC along with the position, heading and speed of the ship, and may display additional information from [[radar]], [[Automatic Identification System|automatic information systems (AIS)]] or other sensors.

As appropriate to particular marine applications, chartplotters may also display data from other sensors, such as echolocators/[[sonar]].

==Technology==
Electronic chartplotters are by nature [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]] (and [[General-purpose computing on graphics processing units|GPU]]) intensive applications. Chartplotters need to retrieve the Navigation Signal ([[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]], GPS, [[GLONASS]], [[Wide Area Augmentation System|WAAS]] etc) signal and overlay that on a map. Map updates on dedicated hardware typically have screen refresh rates from 5hz to 30hz.

Some navigation software can run on standard computers (and mobile phones, etc) but most higher end systems are dedicated hardware. Especially when the chartplotter generates three-dimensional displays, as used for fishing, considerable processing power and video memory may be required.

As with all marine systems, chart-plotters generally are not used alone. In commercial ships, they are integrated into a full system of marine instruments that can guide the ship under any conditions. These other instruments include [[Sonar]] transducers, integration with 2 Way Radio communication devices and emergency locators ([[EPIRB]]).

The integration of these devices is very important as it becomes quite distracting to look at several different screens. Therefore, displays can often overlay charting, radar, sonar into a single system. This gives the captain unprecedented instrumentation to maneuver the ship. With digital backbones, these devices have advanced greatly in the last years. For example, the newer ones have 3D displays that allow you to see above, below and all around the ship, including overlays of satellite imaging.

== Electronic Charts ==

An individual electronic chart, or, more commonly, a database of charts, is the heart of a chartplotter. The chartplotter system can be no more accurate than its charts. While there are different formats for electronic charts, there are even more important quality and legal aspects.

Without charts that are accredited by appropriate governmental organizations, a chartplotter is an example of an Electronic Charting System (ECS). When the charts meet the technical requirements of the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and national hydrographic bodies, the chartplotter can qualify as an [[Electronic Chart Display and Information System]] (ECDIS).  ECDIS legally can be substituted for paper charts while navigating in active waterways, but vessels are required to maintain paper charts if their chartplotter does not use ECDIS.

ECDIS will use IMO-standardized formats, but some chartplotters require specific data formats. A charter may use one or both types of ENC:
* Raster Charts: The chart plotter displays a "picture" of a paper chart or map which is referenced to geographic coordinates.  A [[GPS]] position can be displayed upon the raster chart, but accuracy depends upon many factors including the type of projection (e.g. conic or mercator) used in the original chart, and the reference system used (e.g. [[North_American_Datum|NAD-27]] or [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]]).
* Vector Charts: The chart plotter constructs a facsimile of a chart using raw data from a data base.  The major advantages are a reduction in the amount of data to be stored, and the ability of the chart plotter to identify certain features (such as water depth) and act upon them (e.g. do not allow the ship to run aground)

== Human Interfaces ==
A basic navigational display is common to all chartplotters. Depending on intended use and characteristics of the specific chartplotter, they may have options to present such displays as three-dimensional fish-finding and bottom characteristics useful in fishing. 

These optional displays can be presented by commands to a single screen, causing the main display to be replaced with the one requested. Alternatively, chartplotters may offer split-screen modes on a single physical screen, or may support multiple physical displays.

Chartplotters may be programmable, and can be set to generate audible and visual alarms for conditions such as a potential collision, deviating significantly from the planned course, etc.

== Related Applications==
The principal function of a classic chartplotter is assisting a human pilot to plot and follow a course.

Safety-related [[Automatic Identification System|Automatic identification systems (AIS)]], required on all passenger vessels and vessels of 300 tons and over, also assist in piloting, and can display on the chartplotter. AIS have collision avoidance, and avoidance of known hazards such as reefs, as their primary function. AIS depend on cooperative data communications among ships. 

[[Vessel Traffic Service|Vessel traffic services (VTS)]] go even farther as safety systems, being analogous to the proactive function of air traffic control systems. VTS assist vessel traffic control in routing vessels in busy waters. Other vessel-based safety collision avoidance functions are [[Automatic Radar Plotting Aid| Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA)]], usually a component of the radar system or an accessory to it, and coupled with the radar system input to the chartplotter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1994">'''Cyberquery''' is a software product of [[Cyberscience Corporation]] Inc. Originally developed for data handling and analysis on [[Data General]] AOS and AOS/VS minicomputers, then the available platforms for '''Cyberquery''' were extended to all major [[UNIX]] platforms, [[VAX/VMS]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation]], [[personal computers]] and Microsoft Windows. 

==Description of Cyberquery==

Invented in 1980, Cyberquery is a declarative "4GL" [[fourth-generation programming language]]. Its early design was slightly influenced by RAMIS and other data access and analysis languages such as the query language on GE time sharing systems. Cyberquery automates the process of accessing files or tables and reading records or rows. This basic operation allows the user/developer to concentrate on the details of working with the data within each record, in effect working almost entirely within an implicit [[program loop]] that runs for each record. Compared to [[general-purpose programming language]]s, this automation allows the user/developer to ignore the technical details of the data and how it is stored, and concentrate on the information contained in the data.

Cyberquery has a data dictionary to describe the datasets users wish to access. This removes all the physical details of the file structure from each program and from the user/developer. The original target customers for Cyberquery were personnel departments, so ease of use by non computer specialists was an early design goal. This architecture had the advantage that Cyberquery is portable, reports written for one database run unmodified on any other provided the underlying data is logically similar. Differences are hidden in the data dictionary. Cyberquery is now widely deployed in Industries including Manufacturing, Finance, Medical and Retail.

As a major [[developed economy]], the [[United States]] is highly dependent on the [[Internet]] and therefore greatly exposed to cyber attacks. At the same time, the United States has substantial capabilities in both defense and [[power projection]] thanks to its advanced technology and large [[Military budget of the United States|military budget]]. [[Cyberwarfare|Cyber warfare]] continues to be a growing threat to more physical systems and infrastructures that are linked to the internet. Malicious hacking from domestic or foreign enemies remains a constant threat to the United States. In response to these growing threats, the United States has developed significant cyber capabilities.

The [[United States Department of Defense]] recognizes the use of computers and the Internet to conduct warfare in [[cyberspace]] as a threat to [[national security]], but also as a platform for attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cyberattack-directive-20_us_5b758f76e4b0df9b093d1b06|title=Trump Reverses Obama-Era Rules On Cyberattacks|last=Grenoble|first=Ryan|date=2018-08-16|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/us-military-cyberwar-2016-5|title=How the US military is beating hackers at their own game|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Cyber Command]] centralizes command of [[cyberspace]] operations, organizes existing cyber resources and synchronizes defense of U.S. military networks. It is an [[United States armed forces|armed forces]] [[Unified Combatant Command]].

== The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy ==
In April 2015, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) published its latest Cyber Strategy&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=US Department of Defense Cyber Strategy|last=|first=|publisher=US Department of Defense|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/features/2015/0415_cyber-strategy/Final_2015_DoD_CYBER_STRATEGY_for_web.pdf|pages=2–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; building upon the previous DoD Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace published in July 2011.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Department of Defense Strategy for Operating In Cyberspace|last=|first=|publisher=US DoD|year=2011|isbn=|location=http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/SMA/ispab/documents/DOD-Strategy-for-Operating-in-Cyberspace.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DoD Cyber strategy focuses on building capabilities to protect, secure, and defend its own DoD networks, systems and information; defend the nation against cyber attacks; and support [[contingency plan]]s. This includes being prepared to operate and continue to carry out missions in environments impacted by cyber attacks.

The DoD outlines three cyber missions:
# Defend DoD networks, systems, and information.
# Defend the United States and its interests against cyber attacks of significant consequence.
# Provide integrated cyber capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans.
In addition, the Cyber Strategy emphasizes the need to build bridges to the private sector, so that the best talent and technology the United States has to offer is at disposal to the DoD.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The Five Pillars ===
{{quote box|quote=1. Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations;

2. Defend the DoD information network, secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD missions;

3. Be prepared to defend the U.S. homeland and U.S. vital interests from disruptive or destructive cyber attacks of significant consequence;

4. Build and maintain viable cyber options and plan to use those options to control conflict escalation and to shape the conflict environment at all stages;

5. Build and maintain robust international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats and increase international security and stability.|source= —US Department of Defense Cyber Strategy, US DoD, April 2015.|align = center}}

The five pillars is the base of the Department of Defense's strategy for cyber warfare. The first pillar is to recognize that the new domain for warfare is [[cyberspace]] and that it is similar to the other elements in the [[battlespace]]. The key objectives of this pillar are to build up technical capabilities and accelerate research and development to provide the United States with a technological advantage. The second pillar is proactive defenses as opposed to passive defense. Two examples of passive defense are computer hygiene and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]]. The balance of the attacks requires active defense using sensors to provide a rapid response to detect and stop a cyber attack on a [[computer network]]. This would provide military tactics to backtrace, hunt down and attack an enemy intruder. The third pillar is [[critical infrastructure protection]] (CIP) to ensure the protection of critical infrastructure by developing warning systems to anticipate threats. The fourth pillar is the use of [[collective defense]] which would provide the ability of early detection, and incorporate it into the cyber warfare defense structure. The goal of this pillar is to explore all options in the face of a conflict, and to minimize loss of life and destruction of property. The fifth pillar is building and maintaining international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats, and to remain adaptive and flexible to build new alliances as required. This is focused on "priority regions, to include the Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Europe".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Trump Administration's National Cyber Strategy ===
Shortly after his election, U.S. President Donald Trump pledged to deliver an extensive plan to improve U.S. cybersecurity within 90 days of his inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3190735/government/trumps-cybersecurity-mystery-90-days-in-wheres-the-plan.html|title=Trump's cybersecurity mystery: 90 days in, where's the plan?|last=Williams|first=Martyn|work=Network World|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks after the designated 90-day mark, he signed an executive order that aim to strengthen government networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-parallax.com/2018/03/23/trump-cybersecurity-policy-worry/|title=Nonexistent Trump cybersecurity policy worries experts - The Parallax|date=2018-03-23|work=The Parallax|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-executive-order-strengthening-cybersecurity-federal-networks-critical-infrastructure/|title=Presidential Executive Order on Strengthening the Cybersecurity of Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure {{!}} The White House|work=The White House|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the new executive order, federal-agency leaders are to be held responsible for breaches on their networks and federal agencies are to follow the National Institute of Standards and Technology Framework for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity in consolidating risk management practices. In addition, the federal departments were to examine cybersecurity defense abilities of agencies within 90 days, focusing on "risk mitigation and acceptance choices" and evaluating needs for funding and sharing technology across departments.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.the-parallax.com/2017/05/12/trump-cybersecurity-executive-order/|title=Trump's cybersecurity order not likely to have a major impact, experts say - The Parallax|date=2017-05-12|work=The Parallax|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, President Trump finally signed the National Cyber Strategy- "the first fully articulated cyber strategy for the United States since 2003."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/president-trump-unveils-americas-first-cybersecurity-strategy-15-years/|title=President Trump Unveils America's First Cybersecurity Strategy in 15 Years {{!}} The White House|date=2018-09-20|work=The White House|access-date=2018-10-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bolton, the National Security Advisor, claimed in September 2018 that the Trump administration's new "National Cyber Strategy" has replaced restrictions on the use of offensive cyber operations with a legal regime that enables the Defense Department and other relevant agencies to operate with a greater authority to penetrate foreign networks to deter hacks on U.S. systems. Describing the new strategy as an endeavor to "create powerful deterrence structures that persuade the adversary not to strike in the first place," Bolton added that decision-making for launching attacks will be moved down the chain of command from requiring the president's approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/21/trump-has-a-new-weapon-to-cause-the-cyber-mayhem/|title=Trump Has a New Weapon to Cause 'the Cyber' Mayhem|last=Groll|first=Elias|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Defense Department, in its strategy document released in September 2018, further announced that it would "defend forward" U.S. networks by disrupting "malicious cyber activity at its source" and endeavor to "ensure there are consequences for irresponsible cyber behavior" by "preserving peace through strength."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/president-donald-j-trump-is-strengthening-americas-cybersecurity/|title=President Donald J. Trump Is Strengthening America's Cybersecurity|work=The White House|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms on the U.S. cyberdefense ==
The Trump administration was long criticized for delaying the release of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy. The executive order on which the administration relied was complained to be absent of emphasis on securing the software supply chain and of adequate personnel to implement the cybersecurity guidelines.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The new National Cyber Strategy has also garnered criticisms that evaluating acts of cyberwarfare against the United States still remains ambiguous, as the current U.S. law does not specifically define what constitutes an illegal cyberact that transcends a justifiable computer activity. The legal status of most information security research in the United States is governed by 1986 Computer Freud and Abuse Act (CFAA), which was derided to be "poorly drafted and arbitrarily enforced" by enabling prosecution of useful information security research methods such as Nmap or Shodan. As even the needed services fall into prohibition, top-level information security experts find it challenging to improve the infrastructure of cyberdefense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/09/12/in-cyberwar-there-are-no-rules-cybersecurity-war-defense/|title=In Cyberwar, There are No Rules|last=Wheeler|first=Tarah|website=Foreign Policy|language=en|access-date=2018-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyberattack as an act of war==
In 2011, [[The White House]] published an "International Strategy for Cyberspace" that reserved the right to use military force in response to a [[cyberattack]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Strategy for Cyberspace|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/International_Strategy_Cyberspace_Factsheet.pdf|website=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2014|format=PDF|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=David|title=U.S. reserves right to meet cyber attack with force|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/16/us-usa-defense-cybersecurity-idUSTRE7AF02Y20111116|website=Reuters|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote=When warranted, the United States will respond to hostile acts in cyberspace as we would to any other threat to our country. We reserve the right to use all necessary means — diplomatic, informational, military, and economic — as appropriate and consistent with applicable international law, in order to defend our Nation, our allies, our partners, and our interests. In so doing, we will exhaust all options before military force whenever we can; will carefully weigh the costs and risks of action against the costs of inaction; and will act in a way that reflects our values and strengthens our legitimacy, seeking broad international support whenever possible.|source= —International Strategy for Cyberspace, The White House, 2011}}

In 2013, the [[Defense Science Board]], an independent advisory committee to the [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]], went further, stating that "The cyber threat is serious, with potential consequences similar in some ways to the nuclear threat of the [[Cold War]]," and recommending, in response to the "most extreme case" (described as a "catastrophic full spectrum cyber attack"), that "Nuclear weapons would remain the ultimate response and anchor the deterrence ladder."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=|title=|last=|first=|date=|website=|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacks on other nations==

===Iran===
{{see also|Operation Olympic Games|Stuxnet}}
In June 2010, Iran was the victim of a cyber attack when its nuclear facility in Natanz was infiltrated by the cyber-worm 'Stuxnet', said to be the most advanced piece of malware ever discovered and significantly increases the profile of cyberwarfare.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hWP5Ga_K2k4oOosfMz39JFifrDaQ?docId=CNG.0c3a53ff7267f11501a5b3dbd9567dbf.2d1 AFP: Stuxnet worm brings cyber warfare out of virtual world].

Despite a lack of official confirmation, [[Gary Samore]], White House Coordinator for Arms Control and Weapons of Mass Destruction, made a public statement, in which he said, "we're glad they [the Iranians] are having trouble with their centrifuge machine and that we—the US and its allies—are doing everything we can to make sure that we complicate matters for them", offering "winking acknowledgement" of US involvement in Stuxnet.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/security/video-cracking-the-code-defending-against-the-superweapons-of-the-21st-century-cyberwar/9456/ Gary Samore] speaking at the 10 December 2010 Washington Forum of the [[Foundation for Defense of Democracies]] in Washington DC, reported by C-Span and contained in the PBS program Need to Know ([https://www.pbs.org/wnet/need-to-know/security/video-cracking-the-code-defending-against-the-superweapons-of-the-21st-century-cyberwar/9456/ "Cracking the code: Defending against the superweapons of the 21st century cyberwar"], 4 minutes into piece)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|PRISM (surveillance program)}}

In 2013, [[Edward Snowden]], a former systems administrator for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) and a counterintelligence trainer at the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), revealed that the United States government had hacked into Chinese mobile phone companies to collect text messages and had spied on [[Tsinghua University]], one of China's biggest research institutions, as well as home to one of China's six major backbone networks, the China Education and Research Network (CERNET), from where internet data from millions of Chinese citizens could be mined. He said U.S. spy agencies have been watching China and Hong Kong for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Rapoza |first=Kenneth |title=U.S. Hacked China Universities, Mobile Phones, Snowden Tells China Press |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2013/06/22/u-s-hacked-china-universities-mobile-phones-snowden-tells-china-press/ |publisher=Forbes |date= 2013-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to classified documents provided by [[Edward Snowden]], the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) has also infiltrated the servers in the headquarters of [[Huawei]], China's largest telecommunications company and the largest telecommunications equipment maker in the world. The plan is to exploit Huawei's technology so that when the company sold equipment to other countries—including both allies and nations that avoid buying American products—the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] could roam through their computer and telephone networks to conduct surveillance and, if ordered by the president, offensive cyberoperations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=DAVID |last1=SANGER |first2=NICOLE |last2=PERLROTH |title=N.S.A.

A number of other information sharing initiatives such as the [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]] (CISPA) and [[Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act]] (CISA) have been proposed, but failed for various reasons including over fears that they have too few limits, and could be used to spy on the general public.

*Systems in the US military and private research institutions were penetrated from March 1998 for almost two years in an incident called [[Moonlight Maze]]. The [[United States Department of Defense]] traced the trail back to a mainframe computer in the former Soviet Union but the sponsor of the attacks is unknown and Russia denies any involvement.
*[[Titan Rain]] was the [[U.S. government]]'s designation given to a series of coordinated attacks on American computer systems since 2003. The attacks were labeled as Chinese in origin, although their precise nature (i.e., [[state-sponsored espionage]], [[corporate espionage]], or random [[Hacker (computer security)|hacker]] attacks) and their real identities (i.e., masked by proxy, zombie computer, spyware/virus infected) remain unknown.
*In 2007, the United States government suffered "an espionage [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]]" in which an unknown foreign power ... broke into all of the high tech agencies, all of the military agencies, and downloaded terabytes of information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/06/60minutes/main5555565.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Cyber War: Sabotaging the System | date=6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2008, a hacking incident occurred on a U.S. Military facility in the Middle East. [[United States Deputy Secretary of Defense]] [[William J. Lynn III]] had the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] release a document, which reflected a "malicious code" on a [[USB flash drive]] spread undetected on both [[classified information|classified]] and [[unclassified]] Pentagon systems, establishing a digital [[beachhead]], from which data could be transferred to servers under foreign control.  "It was a network administrator's worst fear: a rogue program operating silently, poised to deliver operational plans into the hands of an unknown adversary.

'''DVD-Video''' is a consumer video format used to store digital video on [[DVD]] discs. DVD-Video was the dominant consumer home video format in [[Asia]], [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Anna | last=Bakalis | title = It's Unreel: DVD Rentals Overtake Videocassettes | work = [[The Washington Times]] | date = 2003-06-20 | url = http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] in the 2000s until it was supplanted by the high-definition [[Blu-Ray disc|Blu-ray disc]]. Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a [[DVD]] drive and an MPEG-2 decoder (e.&amp;nbsp;g., a DVD player, or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player). Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination MPEG-2  compressed video and audio of varying formats (often multi-channel formats as described below). Typically, the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] to 9.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and the [[bit rate]] is usually adaptive. DVD-Video was first available in Japan on November 1, 1996.

The DVD-Video specification was created by [[DVD Forum]] and can be obtained from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $5,000.&lt;ref name="dvdbook-subscribe"&gt;DVD FLLC (2009) [http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_nosbsc.html "DVD Format Book"]. Retrieved 2009-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DVD FLLC (2009) [http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/license/l_howto.html "How to Obtain DVD Format/Logo License (2005–2009)"]. Retrieved 2009-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt; The specification is not publicly available and every subscriber must sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. Certain information in the DVD Book is proprietary and confidential.&lt;ref name="dvdbook-subscribe"/&gt;

== Video data ==
To record moving pictures, DVD-Video uses either [[H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2]] compression at up to 9.8&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] (9,800&amp;nbsp;[[kbit/s]]) or [[MPEG-1#Part 2: Video|MPEG-1 Part 2]] compression at up to 1.856&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (1,856&amp;nbsp;kbit/s). DVD-Video supports video with a [[color depth|bit depth]] of 8-bits per color [[YCbCr]] with 4:2:0 [[chroma subsampling]].&lt;ref name=AudioholicsHDMIApril2008&gt;{{cite news |title=HDMI Enhanced Black Levels, xvYCC and RGB |author=Clint DeBoer |publisher=[[Audioholics]] |url=http://www.audioholics.com/tweaks/calibrate-your-system/hdmi-black-levels-xvycc-rgb |date=2008-04-16 |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TelairityDigitalColorCodingPDF&gt;{{cite news |title=Digital Color Coding |publisher=Telairity |url=http://www.telairity.com/assets/downloads/Digital%20Color%20Coding.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2013-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following formats are allowed for H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 video:&lt;ref name="videohelp"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.videohelp.com/dvd| title=What is DVD?| publisher=Videohelp.com| accessdate=2011-10-16}}{{better source|date=July 2012|reason=The currently cited source does not mention 24000/1001 fps, common among NTSC DVDs. Also, it lacks any PAR information (i.e. reference to the fact that pixels are not square on DVDs)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At a display rate of 25&amp;nbsp;[[frames per second]], [[interlaced]] (commonly used in regions with [[576i|50&amp;nbsp;Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 × 576 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]])
: 704 × 576 pixels 
: 352 × 576 pixels (same as the [[China Video Disc]] standard)
: 352 × 288 pixels
* At a display rate of 29.97&amp;nbsp;frames per second, interlaced (commonly used in regions with [[480i|60&amp;nbsp;Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 × 480 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]]).
: 704 × 480 pixels
: 352 × 480 pixels (same as the [[China Video Disc]] standard).
: 352 × 240 pixels

The following formats are allowed for MPEG-1 video:
* 352 × 288 pixels at 25&amp;nbsp;frame/s, [[Progressive scan|progressive]] (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)
* 352 × 240 pixels at 29.97&amp;nbsp;frame/s, progressive (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)

Video with [[4:3]] frame aspect ratio is supported in all video modes. [[anamorphic DVD|Widescreen]] video is supported only in D-1 resolutions.

The MPEG-1 Part 2 format does not support interlaced video. The H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 format supports both interlaced and progressive-scan content{{clarification needed|date=February 2017}}. Content with a frame rate different from one of the rates shown above can be encoded to H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 by using [[Telecine#Frame rate differences|pulldown]]. This is most commonly used to encode 23.976 frame/s content for playback at 29.97 frame/s.  Pulldown can be implemented directly while the disc is mastered, by actually encoding the data on the disc at 29.97 frames/s; however this practice is uncommon for most commercial film releases, which provide content optimized for display on progressive scan television sets.

Alternately, the content can be encoded on the disc itself at one of several alternate frame rates, and use flags that identify scanning type, field order and field repeating pattern. Such flags can be added in video stream by the H.262/MPEG-2 Part 2 encoder. A DVD player uses these flags to convert progressive content into interlaced video in real-time during playback, producing a signal suitable for interlaced TV sets. These flags also allow reproducing progressive content at their original, non-interlaced format when used with compatible DVD players and progressive-scan television sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hometheaterhifi.com/technical/technical-reviews/dvd-benchmark-part-5-progressive-scan-dvd/ "DVD Benchmark – Part 5 – Progressive Scan DVD"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_2/mrg-87-june-2002.html#A%20Beautiful%20Mind "Home Theater High Fidelity: A Beautiful Mind, Review"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio data ==

The audio data on a DVD movie can be [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[Digital Theatre System#DTS audio codec|DTS]], [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2), or [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) format. In countries using the [[PAL]] system standard DVD-Video releases must contain at least one audio track using the PCM, MP2, or AC-3 format, and all standard PAL players must support all three of these formats. A similar standard exists in countries using the [[NTSC]] system, though with no requirement mandating the use of or support for the MP2 format. DTS audio is optional for all players, as DTS was not part of the initial draft standard and was added later; thus, many early players are unable to play DTS audio tracks. Only PCM and DTS support 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate. Because PCM, being uncompressed, requires a lot of bandwidth and DTS is not universally supported by players, 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate is rare for DVDs. The official allowed formats for the audio tracks on a DVD Video are:
* PCM: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 16 bit or 24 bit [[Linear PCM]], 2 to 6 channels, up to 6,144 kbit/s; N.&amp;nbsp;B. 16-bit 48&amp;nbsp;kHz 8 channel PCM is allowed by the DVD-Video specification but is not well-supported by authoring applications or players;
* AC-3: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to 5.1 (6) channels, up to 448 kbit/s;
* DTS: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate; channel layouts = 2.0, 2.1, 5.0, 5.1, 6.1; bitrates for 2.0 and 2.1 = 377.25 and 503.25 kbit/s, bitrates for 5.x and 6.1 = 754.5 and 1509.75 kbit/s;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.audiorents.com/library/specsheets/4_dts-cae-4_cad-4_encode-decode.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* MP2: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to [[MPEG Multichannel|7.1 channels]], up to 912 kbit/s.

DVDs can contain more than one channel of audio to go together with the video content, supporting a maximum of eight simultaneous audio tracks per video. This is most commonly used for different audio formats{{spaced ndash}} DTS 5.1, AC-3 2.0 etc.{{spaced ndash}} as well as for commentary and audio tracks in different languages.

== Data rate ==
DVD-Video discs have a raw bitrate of 11.08&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, with a 1.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s overhead, leaving a payload bitrate of 10.08&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Of this, up to 3.36 Mbit/s can be used for subtitles, a maximum of 10.08 Mbit/s can be split amongst audio and video, and a maximum of 9.80 Mbit/s can be used for video alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6|title=DVD Studio Pro 4 User Manual|work=apple.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of multiple angles the data is stored interleaved, and so there is a bitrate penalty leading to a max bitrate of 8 Mbit/s per angle to compensate for additional seek time. This limit is not cumulative, so each additional angle can still have up to 8 Mbit/s of bitrate available.

Professionally encoded videos average a bitrate of 4–5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with a maximum of 7–8&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in high-action scenes. Encoding at less than the max bitrate (like this) is typically done to allow greater compatibility among players,&lt;ref&gt;https://documentation.apple.com/en/dvdstudiopro/usermanual/index.html#chapter=4%26section=6 "some dvd players cannot sustain high max bitrate" though note also they still encode video at 8 Mbps&lt;/ref&gt; and to help prevent [[buffer underrun]]s in the case of dirty or scratched discs

Aiming to improve picture quality over standard editions, [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] offered "[[Superbit]]"{{spaced ndash}} a premium line of DVD-Video titles having average bitrates closer to 6&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Audio quality was also improved by the mandatory inclusion of both Dolby Digital and DTS 5.1 surround audio tracks. Multiple languages, angles, and extra audio tracks were eliminated to free up more space for the main title and thereby to ensure the highest data rate possible. In January 2007 the Superbit line was discontinued.

== Other features ==
Some DVD hardware or software players may play discs whose MPEG files do not conform to the above standards; commonly this is used to support discs authored with formats such as [[Video CD|VCD]] and [[Super Video CD|SVCD]]. While VCD and [[China Video Disc|CVD]] video is supported by the DVD standard, neither SVCD video nor VCD, CVD, or SVCD audio is compatible with the DVD standard.

Some hardware players will also play DVD-ROMs or [[CD-ROM]]s containing "raw" MPEG video files; these are "unauthored" and lack the [[Computer file|file]] and header structure that defines DVD-Video. Standard DVD-Video files contain extra information (such as the number of video tracks, chapters and links to extra features) that DVD players use to navigate the disc.

The maximum chapters allowed per title is 99 and the maximum titles allowed per DVD is 99.

=== File system ===
Almost all DVD-Video discs use the ''UDF bridge'' format, which is a combination of the DVD MicroUDF (a subset of [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]] 1.02) and [[ISO 9660]] file systems.&lt;ref name="dvd-books-overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="demystified"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.2 |title=DVD Demystified –  What Are the Features and Speeds of DVD Drives? |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-dvds.html#AEN23376 |title=FreeBSD Handbook –  Burning a DVD-Video |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UDF bridge format provides backwards compatibility for operating systems that support only ISO 9660.&lt;ref name="demystified" /&gt; Most DVD players read the UDF filesystem from a DVD-Video disc and ignore the ISO9660 filesystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdburnerxp.se/help/Appendices/filesystem |title=CDBurnerXP Help –  File System |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directory and file structure ===
A DVD volume for the DVD-Video format has the following structure of directories and files:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html |title=DVD-Video Information –  Video Manager and Video Title Set IFO file headers |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manifest-tech.com/links/dvd_terms.htm |title=DVD Authoring Terminology |series=Terminology |author=Douglas Dixon|accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data structures recorded on a DVD-compliant disc are components of one of the four data groups called domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/domains.php |title=Domains and System Space |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpucoder.com/Muxman/mxp/pgc.shtml |title=Muxman MXP Files –  PGC Object |author=MPUCoder |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/chapters/index.html |title=Menu Features –  DVD Menu |author=Matroska |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/Helppro/vts.htm |title=VTS, VMG and other stuff |author=Mediachance |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Container ===
{{Main|VOB}}
Video, audio, subtitle and navigation streams are [[multiplexed]] and stored on a DVD-Video disc in the [[VOB]] [[container format (digital)|container format]] (Video Object). VOB is based on the [[MPEG program stream]] format, but with additional limitations and specifications in the private streams.&lt;ref name="whatisvob"&gt;[http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/vobov.html "What Is a VOB File"].

VOB files are a very strict subset of the MPEG program stream standard. While all VOB files are MPEG program streams, not all MPEG program streams comply with the definition for a VOB file.&lt;ref name="whatisvob" /&gt;

[[DVD recorder]]s can use [[DVD-VR]] or [[DVD+VR]] format instead of DVD-Video. DVD-VR format store multiplexed audiovisual content in VRO containers.&lt;ref name="VRO"&gt;DVD Demystified (July 13, 2009) [http://dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.10 "What Are .IFO, .VOB, .AOB, and .VRO files?

=== Subtitles ===
DVD Video may also include up to 32 [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] or ''subpicture'' tracks. Subtitles are usually intended as a visual help for the [[deaf]] and [[hearing impaired]] and for translating dialogs.

Subtitles can serve other purposes as well. For example, in the DVD release of ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' one of the subtitle tracks includes history notes, giving additional information timed to the events depicted in the film. In the release of ''[[For All Mankind]]'' subtitles display names of the NASA missions and names of the people shown on the screen. ''[[Shaun of the Dead]]'' also features trivia facts about the making of the film on its subtitles menu.

Subtitles are stored as [[bitmap]] images and therefore can contain messages in any language. Subtitles are restricted to four colors, including transparent "color", and thus tend to look cruder than permanent subtitles on film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonic.com/products/Consumer/CinePlayer/Technology/variability.aspx CinePlayer Variability] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226130428/http://www.sonic.com/products/Consumer/CinePlayer/Technology/variability.aspx |date=February 26, 2008 }}, Sonic.&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency allows laying subtitles over the video during playback.&lt;ref name="dvd-subtitles"&gt;MPEG.org (July 21, 1996) [http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/Book_B/Subpic.html "DVD Technical Notes{{spaced ndash}} Subpictures"].Retrieved 2009-07-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle tracks are contained within the [[VOB]] file of the DVD.

DVD Video may also contain [[closed captioning]] material which can only be viewed on a television set with a decoder.

=== Chapters and angles ===
DVD Video may contain chapters for easy navigation, and continuation of a partially watched film. If space permits, it is also possible to include several versions of certain scenes, called "angles." Today, the multi-angle feature is mostly used for internationalization. For example, it can be used to supply different language versions of images containing written text when subtitles would not do (e.&amp;nbsp;g., the Queen's spell book in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and the scrolling text in the openings of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films). Multiple angles have found a niche in markets such as [[yoga]], [[erotica]] and live performances.

=== Extra features ===
A significant selling point of DVD Video is that the storage capacity allows for a wide variety of extra, or bonus, features in addition to the feature film. These extra features can include [[audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentary]]; [[Documentary film|documentary]] features, commonly about the making of the main title; [[interview]]s; [[deleted scene|deleted footage]]; [[outtake]]s; photo galleries; [[storyboards]]; isolated [[film score|music scores]]; trivia text commentary; simple games; [[film short]]s; [[TV spots]]; [[radio spots]]; [[movie trailers|theatrical trailers]] which were used to promote the main title; and [[teaser trailer]]s advertising related movies or DVDs.

Extra features often provide entertainment or add depth and understanding to the film.  Games, [[blooper]]s, and galleries provide entertainment.  Deleted scenes and alternative endings allow the audience to view additional content which was not included in a theatrical release. Directors cuts allow the audience to see how the director envisioned the main title without the constraints which are placed on a theatrical release.

Other extras that can be included on DVDs are motion menus, still pictures, up to 32 selectable subtitles, [[seamless branching]] for multiple storylines, up to 9 camera angles, and [[DVD-ROM]] / data files that can be accessed on a computer.

Extra features require additional storage space, which often means encoding the main title with lower than possible data rate to fit both the main title and the extras on one disc. Lower data rate may decrease visual and sound quality, which manifests itself in various [[compression artifact]]s. To maintain quality the main title and the extras may be released on several discs, or the extras may be omitted completely like in the "[[Superbit]]" line of DVDs.

== Restrictions ==
DVD-Video has four complementary systems designed to restrict the DVD user in various ways: [[Macrovision]], [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), [[regional lockout|region codes]], and [[User operation prohibition|disabled user operations]] (UOPs). There are also anti-ripping techniques intended to foil [[DVD ripper|ripping software]].

=== Content Scramble System ===
Many DVD-Video titles use Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, which is intended to discourage people from copying the disc. Usually, users need to install software provided on the DVD or downloaded from the Internet such as [[MPlayer]], [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre|TotalMedia Theatre]], [[PowerDVD]], [[VLC media player|VLC]] or [[WinDVD]] to be able to view the disc in a computer system.

CSS does not make it difficult (any more) to copy the digital content now that a decoder ([[DeCSS]]) has been released, nor is it possible to distinguish between legal and illegal copies of a work, but CSS does restrict the playback software that may be used.

CSS has caused major problems for the inclusion of DVD players in any [[Open-source software|open source]] operating systems, since open source player implementations are not officially given access to the decryption keys or license to the [[patent]]s involved in CSS. [[Proprietary software]] players were also difficult to find on some platforms. However, a successful effort has been made to write a decoder by [[reverse engineering]], resulting in [[DeCSS]]. This has led to long-running legal battles and the arrest of some of those involved in creating or distributing the DeCSS code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of the controversial U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), on the grounds that such software could also be used to facilitate unauthorized copying of the data on the discs. The [[Videolan]] team, however, went on to make the [[libdvdcss]] library. Unlike DeCSS, libdvdcss can access a CSS-encrypted DVD without the need of a cracked key, thus enabling playback of such discs on opensource players without legal restraints (although DVD rippers using this library may still be subject to restrictions).

The DMCA currently affects only the [[United States]], however many other countries are signatories to the similar [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Treaty]]. In some countries it is not illegal to use de-scrambling software to bypass the DVD restrictions. A [[List of video players (software)|number of software programs]] have since appeared on the Web to view DVDs on a number of different platforms.

Other measures such as anti-ripping, as well as U.S. and non-U.S. [[copyright]] law, may be used to prevent making unauthorized copies of DVDs. CSS decrypting software, or ripping software, such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[MacTheRipper]], and [[DVD Shrink]] allows a disc to be copied to hard disk unscrambled. Some DeCSS applications also remove [[Macrovision]], [[regional lockout|region codes]], and disabled user operations (UOPs).

=== Anti-ripping ===
After DeCSS ripping software became available, companies developed techniques to introduce errors in DVD-Video discs that do not normally affect playback and navigation of a disc, but can cause problems in software that attempts to copy the entire disc. These approaches, which are not part of the official DVD-Video specification, include Sony [[ARccOS Protection]], Macrovision [[Macrovision#RipGuard|RipGuard]], [[X-protect]], ProtectDisc [[SecureBurn]], Anaho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anahoproductions.com|title=ANAHO HOME|work=anahoproductions.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fortium, and others. All of these methods have been circumvented (as might have been expected, since all standard DVD players naturally circumvent them to play and navigate the discs normally). [[Riplock]] is a feature that reduces drive noise during playback but inadvertently reduces ripping speed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Disabled user operations ===
{{Main|User operation prohibition}}
DVD-Video allows the disc to specify whether or not the user may perform any operation, such as selecting a menu, skipping chapters, forwarding or rewinding{{spaced ndash}} essentially any function on the remote control. This is known as User Operation Prohibitions, or Prohibited User Operations (UOPs or PUOs). Most DVD players respect these commands (e.&amp;nbsp;g., by preventing skipping or fast-forwarding through a copyright message or an advertisement at the beginning of a disc). However, [[grey market]] players ignore UOPs and some DVD "re-authoring" software packages allow the user to produce a copy without these restrictions. The legality of these activities varies by jurisdiction and is the subject of debate. (See [[fair use]].)

=== Region codes ===
{{Main|DVD region code}}
[[File:DVD-Regions with key-2.svg|thumb|right|300px|DVD region codes across the world]]
Each DVD-Video disc contains one or more region codes, denoting the area(s) of the world in which distribution and playback are intended. The commercial DVD player specification dictates that a player must only play discs that contain its region code. In theory, this allows the motion picture studios to control the various aspects of a release (including content, date and price) on a region-by-region basis, or ensure the success of "staggered" or delayed cinema releases from country to country. For example, the British movie ''[[28 Days Later]]'' was released on DVD in Europe several months prior to the film's release in North American movie theaters. Regional coding kept the European DVD unplayable for most North American consumers, thereby ensuring that ticket sales would be relatively unaffected. &lt;!-- Not a good example because the British DVD would be in PAL format, so most US consumers would not be able to use it in any event, regardless of region-encoding. --&gt;

In practice, many DVD players allow playback of any disc, or can be modified to do so. Entirely independent of encryption, region coding pertains to [[regional lockout]], which originated in the [[video game]] industry.

From a worldwide perspective regional coding may be seen as a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Rubens | title = Border controls crumble in DVD land | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2002-08-19 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2197548.stm | accessdate = 2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge percentage of players outside of North America can be easily modified (and are even sold pre-modified by mainstream stores such as Amazon.co.uk) to ignore the regional codes on a disc. This, coupled with the fact that almost all televisions in Europe and [[Australasia]] are capable of displaying NTSC video (at the very least, in black and white), means that consumers in these regions have a huge choice of discs. Contrary to popular belief, this practice is not illegal and in some countries that strongly support free trade it is encouraged.

A normal DVD player can only play region-coded discs designated for the player's own particular region. However, a code-free or region-free DVD player is capable of playing DVDs from any of the six regions around the world.

The [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] license prohibits manufacturing of DVD players that are not set to a single region by default. While the same license prohibits manufacturers from including prominent interfaces to change the region setting it does not clearly prevent them from including "hidden" menus that enable the player's region to be changed; as such, many high-end models in the U.S. include password-protected or otherwise hidden methods to enable multi-region playback. Conversely in the UK and Ireland many cheap DVD players are multi-region while more expensive systems, including the majority of [[home cinema]] systems, are preset to play only region 2 discs.

In China, DVD-Videos for [[television series]] are usually released in MPEG-1 video, with MP2 audio.  By forgoing Dolby standards, manufacturers cut costs considerably; encoding in lower bit-rates also allows a TV series to be squeezed onto fewer discs.  There is no region coding in such cases.

There are also two additional region codes, region 7, which is reserved, and region 8, which is used exclusively for passenger transport such as airlines and cruise ships.

== Programming interface ==
A [[virtual machine]] implemented by the DVD player runs [[bytecode]] contained on the DVD. This is used to control playback and display special effects on the menus. The [[instruction set]] is called the Virtual Machine (VM) DVD command set. There are 16 general parameter registers (GPRM) to hold temporary values and 24 system parameters (SPRM). As a result of a moderately flexible programming interface, DVD players can be used to play games, such as the DVD re-release of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'', along with more sophisticated and advanced games such as ''[[Scene It]]'', all of which can be run on standard DVD players.

== Players and recorders ==
{{Main|DVD player|DVD recorder}}
Modern [[DVD recorder]]s often support additional formats, including DVD+/-R/RW, CD-R/RW, [[MP3]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[Super Video CD|SVCD]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Karaoke|KAR]] and [[MPEG-4]] ([[DivX]]/[[Xvid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdrecorderworld.com/articles/choosing_a_dvd_recorder.php|title=DVD Recorder Formats dvdrecorderworld.com|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also include [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports or [[flash memory]] readers. Player prices range from as low as [[United States dollar|US$]]&amp;nbsp;20 ([[Pound sterling|GB£]]&amp;nbsp;10){{Citation needed|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}} to as high as US$2,700 (GB£1,350).{{Citation needed|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}}

DVD drives for computers usually come with one of two kinds of [[Regional Playback Control]] (RPC), either RPC-1 or RPC-2. This is used to enforce the publisher's restrictions on what regions of the world the DVD can be played. (See [[Regional lockout]] and [[DVD region code]]s.) While [[Open-source software|Open source]] software DVD players allow everything, commercial ones (both standalone models and software players) come further encumbered with restrictions forbidding the viewer from skipping (or in some cases fast-forwarding) certain content such as copyright warnings or advertisements. (See [[User operation prohibition]].)

Video game systems with DVD-Video playback functionality include: [[Panasonic Q]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 4]], [[Wii]] (with an unsupported hack),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On November 18, 2003, the Chinese news agency [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] reported the final standard of the Chinese government-sponsored [[Enhanced Versatile Disc]] (EVD) which is another extension of standard DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD ===
{{See also|High definition optical disc format war }}
Two competing high-definition (HD) optical-disc formats, [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], were introduced in 2006. The HD DVD format, promoted by Toshiba, had the backing by the [[DVD Forum]], which voted to make it the official successor to DVD. Opposing HD DVD was the Blu-ray format, led by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], which shares many members with the DVD forum.

With HD DVD launched in March 2006 and Blu-ray launched in June of the same year, a [[format war]] started. Industry analysts likened the situation to the [[Videotape format war|VHS/Betamax format war]] of the 1980s. At the time of their launch, consumer awareness of either high-definition format was severely limited, with the end result that most consumers avoided both formats, already content with DVD. In February 2008, Toshiba capitulated, citing low demand for HD DVD and the faster growth of Blu-ray, and the inclusion of the format in the video game system [[PlayStation 3]] (PS3), among other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E-commerce and Vídeo Distribution:DVD and Blu-ray |url=http://ecommerceandvideodistributiondvd.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format, while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June 2008.

After HD DVD was discontinued, Blu-ray became the ''de facto'' high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest that DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing. All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD. Moreover, some labels are cutting back on Blu-ray Disc releases in favor of DVD-Video, claiming that low sales do not justify the more expensive Blu-ray Disc format.&lt;ref name="region 1 s2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Americans-Season-2/20387|title=The Americans – Fox Announces DVDs for 'The Complete 2nd Season'|publisher=TVShowsOnDVD.com|first=David|last=Lambert|date=October 14, 2014|accessdate=November 16, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207121852/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Americans-Season-2/20387|archivedate=December 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a growing number of hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu-ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription-based video downloads.

=== CBHD ===
{{Main|China Blue High-definition Disc}}
China Blue High-definition Disc (CBHD) was introduced in September 2007. This format is based on [[HD DVD]]. While the Blu-ray format is marketed internationally, CBHDs have sold significantly in the Chinese market.

Parsons is a British citizen who graduated from the Kingston Polytechnic (now [[Kingston University]]) in 1987 with a BSc (hons) in [[Geography]]. In 1989, he was a part of the team that established the world's first undergraduate course in [[Geographic information system]] at [[Kingston University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sec.kingston.ac.uk/research/research-groups/cgis/ |title= Kingston Centre for GIS (CGIS)}}&lt;/ref&gt; He completed his master's degree from the [[Cranfield Institute of Technology]] with an M.S. in Applied [[Remote sensing]] in 1991.

==Career==
After completing his M.S., Parsons began teaching GIS at the Kingston University. He continued teaching there until 1998. During his tenure, he is credited with having created the first online map of general election results of 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/alumni/our-alumni/made-in-kingston/profiles/ed-parsons/ |title= Ed Parsons Geospatial Technologist, Google Geography BSc(Hons) 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, he moved to [[Autodesk]] as an EMEA Applications Manager for the Geographical Information Systems Division. He joined [[Ordnance Survey]] in 2001 as the organization’s first Chief Technology Officer and played an instrumental role in moving the course of the organization from mapping to geographical information and went on to become the youngest director of IT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2006/dec/07/guardianweeklytechnologysection.insideit  |title=Ordnance Survey comes under renewed pressure}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.directionsmag.com/entry/the-uks-ordnance-survey-slicing-and-dicing-data-and-services/123954 |title=The UK’s Ordnance Survey - Slicing and Dicing Data and Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Google Maps was launched in 2005, Parsons was quite excited, as a technology enthusiast and a geography aficionado. In his blog he described the event as ‘’In a few months Google Maps has done more to allow the individual to develop mapping based websites than the traditional GIS industry has done in 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edparsons.com/2005/08/google-planet-maps-does-it-justify-the-hype/ |title=Google Geography Apps – Do they justify the hype?}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 2005, he was one of the first observers of the typing error that Belgium had swapped places with Netherlands on Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edparsons.com/2005/06/even-google-maps-need-cartographers/ |title=Even Google Maps need cartographers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons left Ordnance Survey in December 2006 and he was offered a job by Google. Parsons began working at the London office of Google. He also set up his own company Open Goematics, a strategic consultancy firm focused on the geospatial technology tracking and [[Neogeography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://spatiallyadjusted.com/ed-parsons-is-leaving-the-ordnance-survey/ |title=Ed Parsons is leaving the Ordnance Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/30/ed-parsons-google-maps_n_2199999.html |title=Meet Ed Parsons, Google Maps’ Man Behind The Curtain}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Parsons received an honorary PhD in Science from the [[Kingston University]] in recognition of his contributions to the field of GIS and to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.kingston.ac.uk/news/article/97/18-feb-2010-doctorate-puts-google-pioneer-on-the-map/ |title=Doctorate puts Google pioneer on the map}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons oversaw the coordination of [[Google Maps]] and [[Historypin]] in 2012 in an initiative to recover lost photographs and document the Royal appearances of the Queen on an interactive map of the world provided by Google Maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/have-you-seen-the-queen-google-wants-to-know?__lsa=0802-c64d |title=Have you seen the Queen, Google Wants to know}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://eomag.eu/articles/544/interview-with-ed-parsons-representative-google-earth-europe |title= Interview with Ed Parsons Representative GOOGLE EARTH EUROPE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December, 2015, Parsons was invited to deliver a keynote address at the GSDI World Conference in Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/GSDI |title= Global Spatial Data Infrastructure Association(wiki) }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsdi15.org.tw/#KeynoteSpeakers |title=GSDI 15 World Conference in Taiwan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gsdiassociation.org/index.php/homepage/gsdi-15-world-conference/445-gsdi-15-world-conference-ed-parsons-announced-as-keynote-speaker.html |title=GSDI 15 World Conference: Ed Parsons announced as keynote speaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons is a member of the Board of Directors of the [[Open Geospatial Consortium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.opengeospatial.org/ogc/organization/bod|title=OGC Board of Directors {{!}} OGC|website=www.opengeospatial.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Parsons was appointed as Visiting Professor at University College London in the [http://www.engineering.ucl.ac.uk/departments/civil-environmental-and-geomatic-engineering/ Department of Civil Environmental and Geomatic Engineering.]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=29555166&amp;privcapId=11635776&amp;previousCapId=11635776&amp;previousTitle=Open%20Geospatial%20Consortium%20Inc.|title=Bloomberg - Are you a robot?|website=www.bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=April 2011}}
'''Enhanced-definition television''', or '''extended-definition television''' ('''EDTV''') is an American [[Consumer Electronics Association]] (CEA) marketing shorthand term for certain [[digital television]] (DTV) formats and devices. Specifically, this term defines formats that deliver a picture superior to that of [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV) but not as detailed as [[high-definition television]] (HDTV).

The term refers to devices capable of displaying 480-line or 576-line signals in [[progressive scan]], commonly referred to as [[480p]] ([[National Television System Committee|NTSC-HQ]]) and [[576p]] ([[Phase Alternating Line|PAL]]) respectively, as opposed to [[interlaced]] scanning, commonly referred to as [[480i]] (NTSC) or [[576i]] (PAL). [[High-motion]] is optional for EDTV.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNET Networks]] - [http://reviews.cnet.com/4520-6029_7-6302296-1.html Enhanced Definition Television]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other countries definitions may vary.

==Connectivity==
As EDTV signals require more [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] (due to frame doubling) than is feasible with SDTV connection standards (such as [[composite video]], [[SCART]] or [[S-Video]]), higher bandwidth media must be used to accommodate the additional data transfer. To achieve EDTV, consumer electronic devices such as a [[progressive scan DVD player]] or modern [[video game]] consoles must be connected through at least a [[component video]] cable (typically using 3 RCA cables for video), a [[VGA connector]], or a [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] connector. For over-the-air television broadcasts, EDTV content uses the same connectors as HDTV.

==Broadcast and displays ==

EDTV broadcasts use less digital bandwidth than HDTV, so TV stations can broadcast several EDTV stations at once. Like SDTV, EDTV signals are broadcast with non-[[square pixel]]s. Since the same number of horizontal pixels are used in 4:3 and 16:9 broadcasts, the 16:9 mode is sometimes referred to as [[anamorphic widescreen]]. Most EDTV displays use square pixels, yielding a resolution of 852&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;480. However, since no broadcasts use this pixel count, such displays always scale anything they show. The only sources of 852&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;480 video are Internet downloads, such as some video games. Unlike 1080i and SDTV formats, progressive displays (such as [[plasma display]]s and LCDs) can show EDTV signals without the need to de-interlace them first. This can result in a reduction of motion artifacts.  However to achieve this most progressive displays require the broadcast to be frame doubled (i.e., 25 to 50 and 30 to 60) to avoid the same motion flicker issues that interlacing fixes.

==DVDs==
The progressive output of a [[DVD player]] can be considered the baseline for EDTV. Movies shot at 24 frames-per-second (fps) are often encoded onto a DVD at 24&amp;nbsp;fps progressive, and most DVD players do the [[Telecine|2:2 or 3:2 pulldown]] conversion internally, before feeding the output to (usually) an interlaced display, or here, a progressive 576p or 480p.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hometheater.about.com/od/beforeyoubuy/a/progressivescan.htm |title=Progressive Scan - What You Need To Know About Progressive Scan and How It Affects What You See on a Television Screen |publisher=Hometheater.about.com |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progressive 24&amp;nbsp;fps DVD will have a unifying effect on [[PAL]] and [[NTSC]], just as film does, perhaps requiring conversion of the number of lines but without a conflict between field and frame rate.  The player converts the video to the more-conventional video formats, on the fly, by simply repeating each field. It converts for PAL (referring here to 625 line 575 active line used with PAL as well as the chrominance aspects), by repeating each frame twice with a corresponding interlace, or for NTSC, by repeating some 480p frames 2 times and others 3 times (3:2 pulldown), to make 24&amp;nbsp;fps material play at 30fps, or 60 ''fields'' per second.&lt;ref&gt;explanation of progressive scan http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/progressive_scan.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HiFi writer progressive scan dvd players critique and concern over lack of lines for 625 PAL resolution [http://www.hifi-writer.com/he/progscan/progscan.htm www.hifi-writer.com/he/progscan/progscan.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

On an EDTV display, or on HDTVs in 480p mode, DVD players can display progressive disc content without needing to convert it to interlaced format. Various signal processing tricks are then used to fake the progressive scan; the quality of this depends on the quality of the upconversion process.

[[Blu-ray Disc]] and [[HD DVD]] formats can encode all EDTV forms, but because HDTV is a primary selling point of Blu-ray/HD DVDs, to date, this has been used only on certain bonus content.

==Gaming==
The video resolution of video game consoles reached EDTV specifications starting with the [[Sega]] [[Dreamcast]], becoming the first mainstream console with a VGA output, supporting EDTV. The  [[PlayStation 2]], [[Nintendo]] [[GameCube]], [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and [[Wii]] are also EDTV compatible with a component connection. The [[Xbox 360]] can output 480p via [[YPbPr|YP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[Component Video|component]], [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] and [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] (newer models only) cables. The [[PlayStation 3]] outputs EDTV via its HDMI and component video (YP&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;) connections; 480p is only available on NTSC consoles while 576p is only available on PAL consoles.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15291">'''Experiments in Art and Technology''' ('''E.A.T.''') was a non-profit and tax-exempt organization established to develop collaborations between artists and engineers. The group operated by facilitating person-to-person contacts between [[artist]]s and [[engineer]]s, rather than defining a formal process for cooperation. E.A.T. initiated and carried out projects that expanded the role of the artist in contemporary society and helped explore the separation of the individual from technological change.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] (2003). ''[[Digital Art]]'' (World of Art series). London: Thames &amp; Hudson. p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
E.A.T. was officially launched in 1967 by the engineers [[Billy Klüver]] and [[Fred Waldhauer]] and the artists [[Robert Rauschenberg]] and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 453&lt;/ref&gt; These men had previously collaborated in 1966 when they together organized ''[[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]]'', a series of [[performance art]] presentations that united artists and engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering : 9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; 10 New York artists worked with 30 engineers and scientists from the world-renowned [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] to create groundbreaking performances that incorporated new technology. Artists involved with ''9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering'' include: [[John Cage]], [[Lucinda Childs]], [[Öyvind Fahlström]], Alex Hay, [[Deborah Hay]], [[Steve Paxton]], [[Yvonne Rainer]], [[Robert Rauschenberg]], [[David Tudor]], and [[Robert Whitman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=294|title=9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering Fonds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable engineers involved include: [[Bela Julesz]], [[Billy Klüver]], [[Max Mathews]], [[John R. Pierce|John Pierce]], [[Manfred R. Schroeder|Manfred Schroeder]], and [[Fred Waldhauer]].&lt;ref&gt;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering. Edited by [[Pontus Hultén]] and Frank Königsberg. New York: ''Experiments in Art and Technology: The Foundation for Contemporary Performance Arts'', 1966. 14 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Video projection]], [[wireless]] sound transmission, and [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] [[sonar]] had never been seen in the art of the 1960s. These art performances still resonate today as forerunners of the close and rapidly evolving relationship between artists and technology. The performances were held in [[New York City]]'s [[69th Regiment Armory]], on [[Lexington Avenue]] between 25th and 26th Streets as an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the original and historical 1913 [[Armory show]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1734]''Vehicle,'' online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=396] documents, history online, retrieved September 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The pinnacle of E.A.T. activity is generally considered to be the [[Pepsi]] Pavilion at Expo '70 at [[Osaka]] [[Japan]] where E.A.T. artists and engineers collaborated to design and program an [[Immersion (virtual reality)|immersive]] [[dome]] that included a [[fog]] sculpture by [[Fujiko Nakaya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal|Nechvatal, Joseph]]. (2012) ''Immersion Into Noise'', p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Organized by E.A.T. founders Billy Klüver and Robert Whitman, the project was led by a core design team that also included [[Robert Breer]], [[Forrest Myers|Frosty Myers]], [[David Tudor]],&lt;ref name="medienkunst"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/pepsi-pavillon/images/6/?desc=full|title=Media Art Net - E.A.T. – Experiments in Art and Technology: Pepsi Pavilion for the Expo '70|first=Media Art|last=Net|date=6 April 2018|website=www.medienkunstnetz.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of over 75 artists and engineers from the US and Japan. The original structure consisted of a [[Buckminster Fuller]]-style [[geodesic dome]] covered by a water vapor cloud sculpture, designed by Fujiko Nakaya, to which the architect John Pearce had devised a way to fit a [[Mylar]] mirror inside the structure.&lt;ref name="medienkunst"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Product Engineering|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bLYzAQAAIAAJ|year=1970|publisher=Morgan-Grampian Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[optical]] effect in the [[spherical]] mirror produced real images resembling that of a [[hologram]].&lt;ref name="Rieser2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Rieser|title=The Mobile Audience: Media Art and Mobile Technologies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVJIhT2rpYoC&amp;pg=PA57|year=2011|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=90-420-3128-X|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the size of the mirror, a spectator looking at an image could walk around it and see it from all sides. On the terrace surrounding the Pepsi Pavilion were seven of Robert Breer’s "Floats", six-foot high [[kinetic sculpture]]s that moved around at less than 2 feet per minute, while emitting sounds.&lt;ref name="HerathKroos2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Damith Herath|author2=Christian Kroos|author3=Stelarc|title=Robots and Art: Exploring an Unlikely Symbiosis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6_sgDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163|date=4 May 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-981-10-0321-9|pages=163–}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a ""Float"" hit an obstacle or was pushed it would reverse direction.&lt;ref name="Tomkins1976"&gt;{{cite book|author=Calvin Tomkins|title=The Scene: Reports on Post-modern Art|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QXNQAAAAMAAJ|year=1976|publisher=Viking Press|isbn=978-0-670-62035-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twenty-eight regional E.A.T. chapters were established throughout the U.S. in the late 1960s to promote [[collaboration]]s between artists and engineers and expand the artist’s role in social developments related to new technologies. In 2002 the [[University of Washington]] hosted a reunion to celebrate the history of these regional liaisons and consider the legacy of E.A.T. for artists working with [[new technologies]] in the 21st century.

E.A.T. activity has entered the canons of [[performance art]], experimental [[noise music]] and theater, bridging the gap from the eras of [[Dada]], [[Fluxus]] and the [[Happenings]]/Actions of the 1960s, through the current generation of [[digital art]]ists for whom multimedia and technology are the norm. The lineage from E.A.T. experimentations in the 1960s which led to media-art explorations of the 1990s and beyond, is the same historical pathway that has led to the ArtScience movement of the 2000s -- the latter an amalgamation of E.A.T., the environmental/ecology movements, and the expanding ontological impact scientific practice has on society. Most recently, E.A.T. included a collaboration with singer songwriter [[Beatie Wolfe]] for its 50 year anniversary, which involved the artist releasing her album as the world's first live 360˚ [[Augmented reality]] stream, from the [[Bell Labs]] anechoic chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2130155-augmented-reality-brings-beatie-wolfes-new-songs-to-life/|title=Augmented reality brings Beatie Wolfe’s new songs to life|work=New Scientist|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.de/collection/life/beatie-wolfe-interview-neues-album-raw-space-stream-ar-vinyl|title=Beatie Wolfe steht auf Vinyl – und macht deshalb Augmented Reality|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-02-01|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.siliconrepublic.com/machines/beatie-wolfe-raw-space-bell-labs|title=AR brings ceremony to Beatie Wolfe’s Raw Space from Bell Labs’ room without echoes|last=O’Dea|first=Ann|date=2017-05-11|work=Silicon Republic|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentation==
In 1972 [[Billy Klüver]], [[Barbara Rose]] and Julie Martin edited the book "Pavilion", that documented the design and construction of the E.A.T. Pepsi Pavilion for [[Expo '70]] in [[Osaka, Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vasulka.org/archive/Writings/EAT.pdf|title=Experiments in Art and Technology,a brief history of projects, Vasulka.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=1716|title=9 Evenings and Experiments in Art and Technology: A gap to fill in art history's recent chronicles|publisher=Fondation Langlois}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 [[Billy Klüver]]  produced an exhibition of photo and text panels entitled "The Story of E.A.T.: Experiments in Art and Technology, 1960 &amp;ndash; 2001 by Billy Klüver."  It was first shown in [[Rome]] and then again at [[Sonnabend Gallery]] in 2002. The exhibition went to [[Lafayette College]] in the spring 2002, then to the Evolution Festival in Leeds, England, and University of Washington, in Seattle. In 2003 it traveled to [[San Diego State University]] in San Diego, California and then to a gallery in Santa Maria, California run by Ardison Phillips &amp;ndash; who was the artist who managed the Pepsi Pavilion in 1970. From April to June 2003 a Japanese version was shown at a large exhibition at the NTT Intercommunication Center (ICC) in [[Tokyo]] which also included a number of object/artifacts and documents and E.A.T. posters, as well as works of art that Klüver and E.A.T. were involved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondation-langlois.org/html/e/page.php?NumPage=236|title=E.A.T. — The Story of Experiments in Art and Technology|website=www.fondation-langlois.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar showing took place in Norrköping Museum of Art, [[Norrköping]], Sweden in September 2004; and a small version of the panels were presented in 2008 at [[Stevens Institute of Technology]] as part of a celebration of Experiments in Art and Technology. 
In November 2017, the E.A.T. projects were part of the ''VARIATION ArtJaws media art fair and exhibition'' at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris: All the panels and some of the below mentioned documentaries were exhibited.

The [[9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering]] DVD Series (director: Barbro Schultz Lundestam) is an important documentation of the collaborations between the artists and engineers that produced innovative works using these emerging technologies.&lt;ref&gt;"9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering" {{cite web |url=http://www.9evenings.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133753/http://www.9evenings.org/ |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financial software''' or '''financial system software''' is special [[application software]] that records all the financial activity within a business organization. Basic features of this system not only includes all the modules of [[accounting software]] like accounts payable, accounts receivable, ledger, reporting modules and payroll but also to explore alternative investment choices and calculate statistical relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Finance – Page 565 | Angelico A. Groppelli, Ehsan Nikbakht – 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Features of the system may vary depending on what type of business it is being used for. Primarily, the goal of the financial software is to record, categorize, analyze, compile, interpret and then present an accurate and updated financial dates for every transaction of the business.&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Your Financial Software Assistance | www.dondosa.net/blogs/post/2021&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of financial software==

===Pipeline tracking===
Pipeline tracking is one of the key features of an accounting system and software for [[asset management]]. This provides summarized information on all the details pertaining to the potential investments that are being monitored. The system and software will organize the pipeline and record the source, execution status, approval status, feasible [[investment capital]] and the targeted purchase price. It provides an efficient analysis of the best deals, timing and price for the utilization of the investment team. Pipeline tracking provides tracking of the source, history and status. It also provides customized classifications and categories. The system can easily execute a [[cash flow]] model and create return assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Community Banker – Volume 9 – Page 83 | https://books.google.com/books?id=q60iAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asset management===
[[Asset management]] is another important feature of a financial software. It uses the updated status of the investment to provide the necessary tools in creating every possible outcome, such as future payments that are distressed, conversions for debt to equity and maturity of loans. It also provides an efficient tracking of payment dates and rates. Updated [[financial statements]] are readily available, which makes it very easy to determine credit standing and as a result make proper adjustments on the projections. Asset management can modify dates of payment, conversion of floating to fixed rates, deferred payments, [[interest rates]], maturity extensions and change schedules for repayment. It also uses various assumptions to store and run multiple cases such as downside, base and upside.&lt;ref&gt;Workforce Asset Management Book of Knowledge – Page 62 | Lisa Disselkamp – 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fund management===
The next feature is fund management, which provides an accurate projection of all the investments as well as factors of the borrowing and operating cost of the fund in order to create a view of the cash levels in the future and investment returns. This system aids in the evaluation and structuring of any fund. Fund management provides a combination of the projections of the cash flow on all investments in order to create a monthly summary. It provides customized assumptions on the leverage cost, interest income, taxes and expenses. The system also creates several scenarios concerning the cash allocation such as reinvestments, distribution of investors and fresh investments. It also creates an analysis of the leverage and call of the capital. Income statements and anticipated balance sheets can also be efficiently created with the use of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Method and system for providing financial functions | Grant – Filed 12 June 2008 – Issued 14 June 2011 – Alejandro M. Pilato – TradeRisks, Inc&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data warehousing===
Another feature of the financial software, is the [[data warehousing]]. This feature syncs the accounting system and retrieves investment transactions. It also uses a customizable category or name. This key feature allows an effortless re-categorization of the investments. The calculation of investment statistics will depend on the [[computation]] of the user at any given moment. Customized reports on the performance of the investment can be created using any of the calculations programmed in the [[database]] of the system. There are approximately more than 100 various calculations programmed in the system. If there is a need for more calculations, then it can easily be provided for the user. Several investments can be categorized into subgroups or groups and they will be used for the creation of totals. It identifies the total price of the fixed income in comparison to the equity investments.

==Uses of financial software==

===Use in pipeline tracking===
Pipeline tracking has multiple benefits and one of them is that it provides a standard layout for possible deals. It also detects the deals that have been approved but are still awaiting execution. It provides an accurate comparison of the cost of investment with the expected returns. The system can easily provide a recycle plan for investment opportunities. It also creates a manifold portfolio with potential returns by utilizing information on the target industries or regions. Pipeline tracking speeds up the decision-making of the committee for [[financial investment]].

===Use in fund management===
There are many benefits of the fund management feature of the financial software. Fund management can determine which specific investments are creating returns. It also pinpoints the availability or shortage of cash. It provides an evaluation of the leverage options as well as determines the effect on the returns. The system also creates a central and systematic modelling, management and analysis of the funds.

===Use in asset managements===
The benefits of asset management include the creation of a platform for maintaining the projection of cash flow on investments. Excel models also eliminate the possibility of manual errors. Asset management increases the scale and adds investments without the loss of analytic perspective. Through this software managers of portfolios have a better grasp on the performance level of the investment. It also provides accurate information on whether the prediction of the analysts was close to the actual performance of the investment.{{cn|date=May 2016}}

[[Image:DDS function generator.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Direct digital synthesis|DDS]] function generator]]

A '''function generator''' is usually a piece of [[electronic test equipment]] or [[software]] used to generate different types of electrical [[waveform]]s over a wide range of frequencies. Some of the most common waveforms produced by the function generator are the sine wave , square wave, triangular  wave and sawtooth shapes. These waveforms can be either repetitive or single-shot (which requires an internal or external trigger source).&lt;ref name="cnx.org"&gt;[http://cnx.org/content/m11895/latest/ cnx.org - Using a Basic Function Generator], 2005-08-21&lt;/ref&gt; [[Integrated circuit]]s used to generate waveforms may also be described as function generator ICs.

In addition to producing sine waves, function generators may typically produce other repetitive waveforms including sawtooth and triangular waveforms, square waves, and pulses. Another feature included on many function generators is the ability to add a DC offset.

Although function generators cover both audio and RF frequencies, they are usually not suitable for applications that need low distortion or stable frequency signals. When those traits are required, other [[signal generator]]s would be more appropriate.

Some function generators can be phase-locked to an external signal source (which may be a frequency reference) or another function generator.&lt;ref name=bakshi&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bakshi |first1=U. A. |last2=Bakshi |first2=A. V. |last3=Bakshi |first3=K. A. |title=Electronic Measurements and Instrumentation |year=2008 |publisher=Technical Publications |location=Pune, India |isbn=978-81-8431-435-9 |pages=3-26,3-27 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=utNfE7Rvpx4C&amp;pg=SA3-PA26&amp;dq=function+generator&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=LUaLTsf-LOSQiQeerpGFBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Function generators are used in the development, test and repair of electronic equipment. For example, they may be used as a signal source to test amplifiers or to introduce an error signal into a control loop. Function generators are primarily used for working with [[analog circuit]]s, related [[pulse generator]]s are primarily used for working with [[digital circuit]]s.

== Electronic instruments ==

=== Working ===
Simple function generators usually generate triangular waveform whose frequency can be controlled smoothly as well as in steps.&lt;ref name="Introduction to System Design Using Integrated Circuits"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sonde |first=B. S. |title=Introduction to System Design Using Integrated Circuits |year=1992 |publisher=New Age International |isbn=978-81-224-0386-2 |pages=244–246 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ICzJGftw8gC&amp;pg=PA244&amp;dq=function+generator&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=IJqiTpPKGIrWrQf3kaiBAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CGQQ6AEwBg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This triangular wave is used as the basis for all of its other outputs. The triangular wave is generated by repeatedly charging and discharging a [[capacitor]] from a constant [[current source]]. This produces a [[linear]]ly ascending and descending voltage ramp. As the output voltage reaches upper or lower limits, the charging or discharging is reversed using a [[comparator]], producing the linear triangle wave. By varying the [[current (electricity)|current]] and the size of the capacitor, different [[frequency|frequencies]] may be obtained. [[Sawtooth wave]]s can be produced by charging the capacitor slowly, using a current, but using a diode over the current source to discharge quickly - the polarity of the diode changes the polarity of the resulting sawtooth, i.e. slow rise and fast fall, or fast rise and slow fall.

A 50% [[duty cycle]] [[square wave]] is easily obtained by noting whether the capacitor is being charged or discharged, which is reflected in the current switching comparator output. Other duty cycles (theoretically from 0% to 100%) can be obtained by using a comparator and the sawtooth or triangle signal. Most function generators also contain a non-linear [[diode]] [[Waveform shaping|shaping circuit]] that can convert the triangle wave into a reasonably accurate [[sine wave]] by rounding off the corners of the triangle wave in a process similar to [[Clipping (audio)|clipping]] in audio systems.

A typical function generator can provide frequencies up to 20&amp;nbsp;MHz. RF generators for higher frequencies are not function generators in the strict sense since they typically produce pure or modulated sine signals only.

Function generators, like most [[signal generator]]s, may also contain an [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]], various means of [[modulation|modulating]] the output waveform, and often the ability to automatically and repetitively "sweep" the frequency of the output waveform (by means of a [[voltage-controlled oscillator]]) between two operator-determined limits. This capability makes it very easy to evaluate the [[frequency response]] of a given [[electronic circuit]].

Some function generators can also generate [[white noise|white]] or [[pink noise]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

More advanced function generators are called [[arbitrary waveform generator]]s (AWG). They use [[Direct digital synthesizer|direct digital synthesis]] (DDS) techniques to generate any waveform that can be described by a table of amplitudes.

=== Specifications ===
Typical specifications for a general-purpose function generator are:
* Produces sine, square, triangular, sawtooth (ramp), and pulse output. [[Arbitrary waveform generator]]s can produce waves of any shape.&lt;ref name=bakshi/&gt;
* It can generate a wide range of frequencies. For example, the Tektronix FG 502 (ca 1974) covers 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz to 11&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name="FG502"&gt;{{Citation |title=FG 502 Function Generator |year=1973 |series=Instruction Manual |publisher=Tektronix |location=Beaverton, OR |doi= }}, pp=1-7&amp;ndash;1-8&lt;/ref&gt;
* Frequency stability of 0.1 percent per hour for analog generators&lt;ref name="FG502"/&gt; or {{nowrap|500 ppm}} for a digital generator.
* Maximum sinewave [[distortion]] of about 1% (accuracy of diode shaping network) for analog generators.&lt;ref&gt;FG 502 distortion is {{nowrap|0.5 percent}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arbitrary waveform generators may have distortion less than {{nowrap|-55 dB}} below {{nowrap|50 kHz}} and less than {{nowrap|-40 dB}} above {{nowrap|50 kHz.}}
* Some function generators can be phase locked to an external signal source, which may be a frequency reference or another function generator.
* Amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or phase modulation (PM) may be supported.
* Output amplitude up to {{nowrap|10 V}} [[peak-to-peak]].
* Amplitude can be modified, usually by a calibrated [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]] with decade steps and continuous adjustment within each decade.
* Some generators provide a DC offset voltage, e.g. adjustable between -5V to +5V.&lt;ref name=bakshi/&gt;
* An output impedance of {{nowrap|50 Ω}}.

=== Software ===
A completely different approach to function generation is to use [[software]] instructions to generate a waveform, with provision for output. For example, a general-purpose [[digital computer]] can be used to generate the waveform; if frequency range and amplitude are acceptable, the [[sound card]] fitted to most computers can be used to output the generated wave.

== Circuit elements ==

===Waveform generator===
An electronic circuit element used for generating waveforms within other apparatus that can be used in communications and instrumentation circuits, and also in a function generator instrument. Examples are the [[Exar]] XR2206&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jameco.com/Jameco/Products/ProdDS/34972.pdf |publisher=Exar |title=''Exar XR-2206 Monolithic Function Generator'' |format=PDF |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Intersil]] [[8038 ic|ICL8038]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/fn28/fn2864.pdf |publisher=[[Intersil]] |title=''Intersil ICL8038 Precision Waveform Generator/Voltage Controlled Oscillator'' |format=PDF |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; integrated circuits, which can generate sine, square, triangle, ramp, and pulse waveforms at a [[Voltage-controlled oscillator|voltage-controllable frequency]].

===Function generator===
An electronic circuit element that provides an output proportional to some mathematical function (such as the square root) of its input; such devices are used in [[feedback control]] systems and in [[analog computer]]s. Examples are the [[Raytheon]] QK329 square-law tube&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiomuseum.org/forumdata/users/6435/file/varie/QK329_App.pdf |last1=Miller |first1=Joseph A. |last2=Soltes |first2=Aaron S. |last3=Scott |first3=Ronald E. |publisher=[[Electronics (magazine)|Electronics]] |date=February 1955 |title=''Wide-band Analog Function Multiplier'' |format=PDF |accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Intersil ICL8048 Log/Antilog Amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.intersil.com/content/dam/Intersil/documents/fn28/fn2864.pdf |publisher=[[Intersil]] |title=''Intersil ICL8048 Log Amplifier'' |format=PDF |accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical function generators ==

Mechanical '''function generators''' are [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]], [[cam|cam-follower mechanisms]] or [[Non-circular gear|non-circular gears]], designed to reproduce different types of functions, either periodic (like sine or cosine functions), or single-shot (logarithm, parabolic, tangent functions etc.).

[[File:Compact-Fluorescent-Bulb.jpg|thumb|A [[compact fluorescent lamp|compact fluorescent bulb]] is a household application of a gas-filled tube]]

A '''gas-filled tube''', also known as a '''discharge tube''', is an arrangement of [[electrode]]s in a [[gas]] within an [[dielectric|insulating]], temperature-resistant [[envelope]]. Gas-filled tubes exploit phenomena related to [[electric discharge in gases]], and operate by [[ionisation|ionizing]] the gas with an applied [[voltage]] sufficient to cause [[electrical conduction]] by the underlying phenomena of the [[Townsend discharge]].  A [[gas-discharge lamp]] is an [[electric light]] using a gas-filled tube; these include [[fluorescent lamp]]s, [[metal-halide lamp]]s, [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s, and [[neon light]]s.  Specialized gas-filled tubes such as [[krytron]]s, [[thyratron]]s, and [[ignitron]]s are used as switching devices in electric devices.

The voltage required to initiate and sustain discharge is dependent on the pressure and composition of the fill gas and geometry of the tube. Although the envelope is typically glass, power tubes often use [[ceramic]]s, and military tubes often use glass-lined metal. Both [[hot cathode]] and [[cold cathode]] type devices are encountered.

==Gases in use==

===Hydrogen===
[[Hydrogen]] is used in tubes used for very fast switching, e.g. some [[thyratron]]s, [[dekatron]]s, and [[krytron]]s, where very steep edges are required. The build-up and recovery times of hydrogen are much shorter than in other gases.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt; Hydrogen thyratrons are usually hot-cathode. Hydrogen (and deuterium) can be stored in the tube in the form of a metal [[hydride]], heated with an auxiliary filament;  hydrogen by heating such storage element can be used to replenish cleaned-up gas, and even to adjust the pressure as needed for a thyratron operation at a given voltage.&lt;ref name="cdvandt"&gt;C. A. Pirrie and H. Menown [http://www.cdvandt.org/Evolution%20of%20Hydrogen%20Thyratron.pdf "The Evolution of the Hydrogen Thyratron"], Marconi Applied Technologies Ltd, Chelmsford, U.K.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deuterium===
[[Deuterium]] is used in [[ultraviolet]] lamps for [[ultraviolet spectroscopy]], in [[neutron generator]] tubes, and in special tubes (e.g. [[crossatron]]). It has higher breakdown voltage than hydrogen. In fast switching tubes it is used instead of hydrogen where high voltage operation is required.&lt;ref name="pasley1"/&gt; For a comparison, the hydrogen-filled CX1140 thyratron has anode voltage rating of 25 kV, while the deuterium-filled and otherwise identical CX1159 has 33 kV. Also, at the same voltage the pressure of deuterium can be higher than of hydrogen, allowing higher rise rates of rise of current before it causes excessive anode dissipation. Significantly higher peak powers are achievable. Its recovery time is however about 40% slower than for hydrogen.&lt;ref name="cdvandt"/&gt;

===Noble gases===
[[File:Edelgase in Entladungsroehren.jpg|thumb|right|[[Noble gas]] discharge tubes; from left to right: [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], [[krypton]], [[xenon]]]]

[[Noble gas]]es are frequently used in tubes for many purposes, from lighting to switching. Pure noble gases are employed in switching tubes. Noble-gas-filled thyratrons have better electrical parameters than mercury-based ones.&lt;ref name="pasley1"&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Library/Pasley1.html "Pulse Power Switching Devices – An Overview"]&lt;/ref&gt; The electrodes undergo damage by high-velocity ions. The neutral atoms of the gas slow the ions down by collisions, and reduce the energy transferred to the electrodes by the ion impact. Gases with high molecular weight, e.g. xenon, protect the electrodes better than lighter ones, e.g. neon.&lt;ref name="lamptech"&gt;[http://www.lamptech.co.uk/Documents/FL%20Gases.htm "The Fluorescent Lamp – Gas Fillings"]. Lamptech.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Helium]] is used in [[helium–neon laser]]s and in some thyratrons rated for high currents and high voltages. Helium provides about as short deionization time as hydrogen, but can withstand lower voltage, so it is used much less often.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdvandt.org/thyratron_various.htm Thyratron various]. Cdvandt.org. Retrieved on 2011-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Neon]] has low ignition voltage and is frequently used in low-voltage tubes. Discharge in neon emits relatively bright red light; neon-filled switching tubes therefore also act as indicators, shining red when switched on. This is exploited in the [[decatron]] tubes, which act as both counters and displays. Its red light is exploited in [[neon signage]]. Used in [[fluorescent tube]]s with high power and short length, e.g. industrial lighting tubes. Has higher voltage drop in comparison with argon and krypton. Its low atomic mass provides only a little protection to the electrodes against accelerated ions; additional screening wires or plates can be used for prolonging the anode lifetime. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury.&lt;ref name="lamptech"/&gt;
*[[Argon]] was the first gas used in fluorescent tubes and is still frequently used due to its low cost, high efficiency, and very low striking voltage. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury.&lt;ref name="lamptech"/&gt; It was also used in early [[Rectifier#Argon gas electron tube|rectifier tubes]]; first thyratrons were derived from such argon-filled tubes.
*[[Krypton]] can be used in fluorescent lamps instead of argon; in that application it reduces the total energy losses on electrodes from about 15% to 7%. The voltage drop per lamp length is however lower than with argon, which can be compensated by smaller tube diameter. Krypton-filled lamps also require higher starting voltage; this can be alleviated by using e.g. 25%–75% argon-krypton mixture. In fluorescent tubes it is used in combination with mercury.&lt;ref name="lamptech"/&gt;
*[[Xenon]] in pure state has high breakdown voltage, making it useful in higher-voltage switching tubes. Xenon is also used as a component of gas mixtures when production of ultraviolet radiation is required, e.g. in [[plasma display]]s, usually to excite a [[phosphor]]. The wavelength produced is longer than with argon and krypton and penetrates the phosphors better. To lower the ionization voltage, neon-xenon or helium-xenon are used; above {{cvt|350|torr|kPa|lk=on}}, helium has lower breakdown voltage than neon and vice versa. At concentrations of 1% and less of xenon, the [[Penning effect]] becomes significant in such mixtures, as most of xenon ionization occurs by collision with excited atoms of the other noble gas; at more than few percents of xenon, the discharge ionizes xenon directly due to most energy of the electrons being spent on direct ionization of xenon.&lt;ref&gt;Po-Cheng Chen, Yu-Ting Chien, [http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/ADP011307 "Gas Discharge and Experiments for Plasma Display Panel"], Defense Technical Information Center Compilation Part Notice ADP011307&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Radon]], despite being a noble gas, is dangerously [[radioactivity|radioactive]] and its most stable isotope has a [[half-life]] of less than four days&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | first1=Cornelius |last1=Keller |first2=Walter |last2=Wolf |first3=Jashovam |last3=Shani | title = Radionuclides, 2. Radioactive Elements and Artificial Radionuclides | doi = 10.1002/14356007.o22_o15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Consequently, it is not commonly used in electronic devices.
*[[Penning mixture]]s are used where lower ionization voltage is required, e.g. in the [[neon lamp]]s, [[Geiger–Müller tube]]s and other gas-filled [[particle detector]]s. A classical combination is about 98–99.5% of neon with 0.5–2% of argon, used in, e.g. [[neon bulb]]s and in monochrome [[plasma display]]s.

===Elemental vapors (metals and nonmetals)===
*[[Mercury (element)|Mercury]] vapors are used for applications with high current, e.g. lights, [[mercury-arc valve]]s, [[ignitron]]s. Mercury is used because of its high vapor pressure and low ionization potential. Mercury mixed with an inert gas is used where the energy losses in the tube have to be low and the tube lifetime should be long. In mercury-inert gas mixtures, the discharge is initially carried primarily by the inert gas; the released heat then serves to evaporate enough mercury to reach the desired vapor pressure. Low-voltage (hundreds volts) rectifiers use saturated mercury vapor in combination with a small amount of inert gas, allowing cold start of the tubes. High-voltage (kilovolts and more) rectifiers use pure mercury vapor at low pressure, requiring maintenance of maximum temperature of the tube. The liquid mercury serves as a reservoir of mercury, replenishing the vapors that are used up during the discharge. Unsaturated mercury vapor can be used, but as it can not be replenished, the lifetime of such tubes is lower.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt; The strong dependence of vapor pressure on mercury temperature limits the environments the mercury-based tubes can operate in. In low-pressure mercury lamps, there is an optimum mercury pressure for the highest efficiency. Photons emitted by ionized mercury atoms can be absorbed by nearby nonionized atoms and either reradiated or the atom is deexcited nonradiatively, too high mercury pressure therefore causes losses of light. Too low mercury pressure leads to too few atoms present to get ionized and radiate photons. The optimum temperature for low-pressure mercury lamps is at about 42&amp;nbsp;°C, when the saturated vapor pressure of mercury (present as a drop of about 1&amp;nbsp;mg of liquid mercury in the tube, as a reservoir compensating for losses by clean-up) reaches this optimum. In lamps intended for operation at higher ambient temperatures, and at a wider temperature range, mercury is present in the form of an [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]] with e.g. [[bismuth]] and [[indium]]; the vapor pressure above amalgam is lower than above liquid mercury.&lt;ref name="handopto"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3GmcgL7Z-6YC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=gas+discharge+properties+mercury+neon+hydrogen+deuterium&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ivxVbrcyip&amp;sig=8ozlMgy-CAtNgmXRd9eTFIDioSc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WKXNS66xFYqy0gSfs4nqDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=34&amp;ved=0CH4Q6AEwIQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Handbook of optoelectronics'', Volume 1] by John Dakin, Robert G. W. Brown, p. 52, CRC Press, 2006 {{ISBN|0-7503-0646-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury is used in [[fluorescent tube]]s as a source of visible and ultraviolet light for exciting the [[phosphor]]; in that application it is usually used together with argon, or in some cases with krypton or neon. Mercury ions deionize slowly, limiting the switching speed of mercury-filled thyratrons. Ion bombardment with mercury ions of even relatively low energies also gradually destroys oxide-coated cathodes.&lt;ref name="cdvandt"/&gt;
*[[Sodium]] vapors are used in [[sodium-vapor lamp]]s.
*[[Sulfur]] vapors are used in [[sulfur lamp]]s.
*Vapors of many metals, alone or together with a noble gas, are used in many [[laser]]s.

===Other gases===
[[File:Gase-in-Entladungsroehren.jpg|thumb|right|Other gases in discharge tubes; from left to right: [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ]]
*[[Air]] can be used in some low-demanding applications.
*[[Nitrogen]] at relatively high pressure tends to be used in [[surge arrester]]s, due to its short build-up time, giving the tubes fast response time to voltage surges.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;
*[[Halogen]]s and [[alcohol]] vapors absorb ultraviolet radiation and have high electron affinity. When added to inert gases, they quench the discharge; this is exploited in e.g. [[Geiger–Müller tube]]s.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;

===Insulating gases===
{{main|Dielectric gas}}
In special cases (e.g., high-voltage switches), gases with good dielectric properties and very high breakdown voltages are needed. Highly [[electronegative]] elements, e.g., [[halogen]]s, are favored as they rapidly recombine with the ions present in the discharge channel. One of the most popular choices is [[sulfur hexafluoride]], used in special high-voltage applications. Other common options are dry pressurized [[nitrogen]] and [[halocarbon]]s.

==Gas-tube physics and technology==
{{see also |Townsend discharge}}
[[File:Glow discharge current-voltage curve English.svg|thumb|right|300px|Voltage-current characteristics of electrical discharge in neon at {{cvt|1|torr|Pa|lk=off}}, with two planar electrodes separated by 50&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;br/&gt;

J: [[electric arc]]&lt;br/&gt;

The A-D region is called a dark discharge; there is some ionization, but the current is below 10 microamperes and there is no significant amount of radiation produced.&lt;br/&gt;
The D-G region exhibits a [[Negative resistance|negative differential resistance]]&lt;br/&gt;
The F-H region is a region of glow discharge; the plasma emits a faint glow that occupies almost all the volume of the tube; most of the light is emitted by excited neutral atoms.&lt;br/&gt;
The I-K region is a region of arc discharge; the plasma is concentrated in a narrow channel along the center of the tube; a great amount of radiation is produced.]]
The fundamental mechanism is the Townsend discharge, which is the sustained multiplication of electron flow by ion impact when a critical value of electric field strength for the density of the gas is reached. As the electric field is increased various phases of discharge are encountered as shown in the accompanying plot. The gas used dramatically influences the parameters of the tube. The breakdown voltage depends on the gas composition and electrode distance; the dependencies are described by [[Paschen's law]].

===Gas pressure===
The gas pressure may range between {{cvt|0.001|and(-)|1000|torr|Pa|sigfig=2|lk=off}}; most commonly, pressures between 1–10 torr are used.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt; The gas pressure influences the following factors:&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;
*[[breakdown voltage]] (also called ignition voltage)
*[[current density]]
*operating voltage
*backfire voltage
*tube lifetime (lower pressure tubes tend to have shorter lifetimes due to using up of the gas)
*cathode [[sputtering]], reduced at higher pressures

Above a certain value, the higher the gas pressure, the higher the ignition voltage. High-pressure lighting tubes can require a few kilovolts impulse for ignition when cold, when the gas pressure is low. After warming up, when the volatile compound used for light emission is vaporized and the pressure increases, reignition of the discharge requires either significantly higher voltage or reducing the internal pressure by cooling down the lamp.&lt;ref name="handopto"/&gt; For example, many sodium vapor lamps cannot be re-lit immediately after being shut off; they must cool down before they can be lit up again.

The gas tends to be used up during the tube operation, by several phenomena collectively called '''clean-up'''. The gas atoms or molecules are [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the surfaces of the electrodes. In high voltage tubes, the accelerated ions can penetrate into the electrode materials. New surfaces, formed by sputtering of the electrodes and deposited on e.g. the inner surfaces of the tube, also readily adsorb gases. Non-inert gases can also chemically react with the tube components. Hydrogen may diffuse through some metals.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;

For removal of gas in vacuum tubes, [[getter]]s are used. For resupplying gas for gas-filled tubes, '''replenishers''' are employed. Most commonly, replenishers are used with hydrogen; a filament made from a hydrogen-absorbing metal (e.g. zirconium or titanium) is present in the tube, and by controlling its temperature the ratio of absorbed and desorbed hydrogen is adjusted, resulting in controlling of the hydrogen pressure in the tube. The metal filament acts as a hydrogen storage. This approach is used in e.g. hydrogen thyratrons or neutron tubes. Usage of saturated mercury vapor allows using a pool of liquid mercury as a large storage of material; the atoms lost by clean-up are automatically replenished by evaporation of more mercury. The pressure in the tube is however strongly dependent on the mercury temperature, which has to be controlled carefully.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;

Large rectifiers use saturated mercury vapor with a small amount of an inert gas. The inert gas supports the discharge when the tube is cold.

The mercury arc valve current-voltage characteristics are highly dependent on the temperature of the liquid mercury. The voltage drop in forward bias decreases from about 60 volts at 0&amp;nbsp;°C to somewhat above 10 volts at 50&amp;nbsp;°C and then stays constant; the reverse bias breakdown ("arc-back") voltage drops dramatically with temperature, from 36&amp;nbsp;kV at 60&amp;nbsp;°C to 12&amp;nbsp;kV at 80&amp;nbsp;°C to even less at higher temperatures. The operating range is therefore usually between 18–65&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="refeng"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=R67HARlhisYC&amp;pg=PA2-IA342&amp;dq=gas+filled+tube+hydrogen+neon+argon+mercury&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=gas%20filled%20tube%20hydrogen%20neon%20argon%20mercury&amp;f=false ''Reference Data for Engineers: Radio, Electronics, Computers and Communications''] by Wendy Middleton, Mac E. Van Valkenburg, p. 16-42, Newnes, 2002 {{ISBN|0-7506-7291-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gas purity===
The gas in the tube has to be kept pure to maintain the desired properties; even small amount of impurities can dramatically change the tube values; presence of non-inert gases generally increases the breakdown and burning voltages. The presence of impurities can be observed by changes in the glow color of the gas. Air leaking into the tube introduces oxygen, which is highly electronegative and inhibits the production of electron avalanches. This makes the discharge look pale, milky, or reddish. Traces of mercury vapors glow bluish, obscuring the original gas color. Magnesium vapor colors the discharge green. To prevent [[outgassing]] of the tube components during operation, a [[bake-out]] is required before filling with gas and sealing. Thorough degassing is required for high-quality tubes; even as little as 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;torr&amp;nbsp;(≈1&amp;nbsp;μPa) of oxygen is sufficient for covering the electrodes with monomolecular oxide layer in few hours. Non-inert gases can be removed by suitable [[getter]]s. for mercury-containing tubes, getters that do not form [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]]s with mercury (e.g. [[zirconium]], but not [[barium]]) have to be used. Cathode sputtering may be used intentionally for gettering non-inert gases; some reference tubes use [[molybdenum]] cathodes for this purpose.&lt;ref name="ch2"/&gt;

Pure inert gases are used where the difference between the ignition voltage and the burning voltage has to be high, e.g. in switching tubes. Tubes for indication and stabilization, where the difference has to be lower, tend to be filled with [[Penning mixture]]s; the lower difference between ignition and burning voltages allows using lower power supply voltages and smaller series resistances.&lt;ref name="ch2"&gt;Hajo Lorens van der Horst, [http://www.electricstuff.co.uk/ch2.pdf Chapter 2: The construction of a gas-discharge tube] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225112615/http://electricstuff.co.uk/ch2.pdf |date=2010-12-25 }} ''1964 Philips Gas-Discharge Tubes book''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lighting and display gas-filled tubes==
[[Fluorescent lamp|Fluorescent lighting]], [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL lamps]], [[Mercury-vapor lamp|mercury]] and [[sodium-vapor lamp|sodium discharge lamps]] and [[Metal-halide lamp|HID lamps]] are all gas-filled tubes used for lighting.

[[Neon lamp]]s and [[neon signage]] (most of which is not neon based these days) are also low-pressure gas-filled tubes.

Specialized historic low-pressure gas-filled tube devices include the [[Nixie tube]] (used to display numerals) and the [[Decatron]] (used to count or divide pulses, with display as a secondary function).

[[Xenon flash lamp]]s are gas-filled tubes used in [[camera]]s and [[strobe light]]s to produce bright flashes of light.

The recently developed [[sulfur lamp]]s are also gas-filled tubes when hot.

==Gas-filled tubes in electronics==
Since the ignition voltage depends on the ion concentration which may drop to zero after a long period of inactivity, many tubes are primed for ion availability:
* optically, by ambient light or by a 2-watt incandescent lamp, or by a glow discharge in the same envelope, 
* radioactively, by adding [[tritium]] to the gas, or by coating the envelope inside,
* electrically, with a ''keep-alive'' or ''primer'' electrode

===Power devices===
Some important examples include the [[thyratron]], [[krytron]], and [[ignitron]] tubes, which are used to switch high-voltage currents. A specialized type of gas-filled tube called a [[Surge protector#Gas discharge tube .28GDT.29|Gas Discharge Tube (GDT)]] is fabricated for use as [[surge protector]]s, to limit voltage surges in electrical and electronic circuits.

===Computing tubes===
The [[Schmitt trigger]] effect of the [[Negative resistance|negative differential resistance]]-region can be exploited to realize timers, [[Relaxation oscillator#Pearson–Anson electronic relaxation oscillator|relaxation oscillator]]s and [[Digital electronics|digital circuits]] with [[neon lamp]]s, ''trigger tubes'', ''relay tubes'', [[dekatron]]s and [[nixie tube]]s.

Thyratrons can also be used as [[triode]]s by operating them below their ignition voltage, allowing them to amplify analog signals as a [[Regenerative circuit|self-quenching superregenerative detector]] in [[radio control]] receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/138/r/RK61.pdf |title=''Subminiature gas triode type RK61'' data sheet |publisher=[[Raytheon|Raytheon Company]] |format=PDF |accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indicators===
There were special neon lamps besides nixie tubes:
*''Tuneon'' early tuning indicator, a glass tube with a short wire anode and a long wire cathode that glows partially; the glow length is proportional to the tube current
*[[Phosphor]]ed neon lamp
*Luminiscent trigger tube, used as latching indicators, or [[pixel]]s of [[dot-matrix display]]s
**Direct-glow trigger tube
**Phosphored trigger tube

===Noise diodes===
[[Hot-cathode]], gas-discharge [[Noise generator|noise diodes]] were available in normal [[Vacuum tube|radio tube]] glass envelopes for frequencies up to [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]], and as long, thin glass tubes with a normal [[Bayonet mount|bayonet light bulb mount]] for the filament and an anode [[top cap]], for [[Super high frequency|SHF]] frequencies and diagonal insertion into a [[waveguide]].

They were filled with a pure inert gas such as [[neon]] because [[Penning mixture|mixtures]] made the output temperature-dependent. Their burning voltage was under 200&amp;nbsp;V, but they needed optical priming by an incandescent 2-watt lamp and a voltage surge in the 5-kV range for ignition.

One miniature [[thyratron]] found an additional use as a noise source, when operated as a diode in a transverse magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/137/6/6D4.pdf |title=''6D4 Miniature triode thyratron'' data sheet |publisher=[[Sylvania Electric Products|Sylvania]] |format=PDF |accessdate=25 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage-regulator tubes===
In the mid-20th century, [[voltage-regulator tube]]s were commonly used.

===Elapsed-time measurement===
Cathode sputtering is taken advantage of in the ''Time Totalizer'', a metal-vapor [[coulometer]]-based elapsed time meter where the sputtered metal is deposited on a collector element whose resistance therefore decreases slowly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mif.pg.gda.pl/homepages/frank/sheets/201/7/7414.pdf |publisher=[[Bendix Corporation]] |title= ''7414 Subminiature Time Totalizer'' data sheet |date=14 March 1959 |format=PDF |accessdate=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geosteering is the optimal placement of a wellbore based on the results of realtime downhole geological and geophysical logging measurements rather than three-dimensional targets in space. The objective is usually to keep a directional wellbore within a hydrocarbon pay zone defined in terms of its resistivity, density or even biostratigraphy. In mature areas, geosteering may be used to keep a wellbore in a particular section of a reservoir to minimize gas or water breakthrough and maximize economic production from the well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/g/geosteering.aspx|title=geosteering - Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary|author=|date=|website=www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171014183345/http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Terms/g/geosteering.aspx|archivedate=14 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the process of [[well drilling|drilling a borehole]], '''geosteering''' is the act of adjusting the borehole position ([[inclination]] and [[azimuth]] angles) ''on the fly'' to reach one or more geological targets. These changes are based on geological information gathered while drilling.
Originally only a projected target would be aimed for with crude directional tools. Now the advent of rotary steerable tools and an ever increasing arsenal of geophysical tools enables well placement with ever increasing accuracy. Typically a basic tool configuration with have directional and inclination sensors, along with a gamma ray tool. Other options are neutron density, look ahead seismic, downhole pressure readings et al. Due to the vast volume of data generated, especially by imaging tools, the data transmitted to surface is a carefully selected fraction of what is available. Data is collected in memory for a data dump when back on surface with the tool. 
==History==

Geosteering only practically became possible with the advent of deep reading 2 MHz resistivity LWD tools from the major LWD vendors (BakerHughes Reservoir Navigation Tool, SperrySun and Schlumberger) and other tools in the early 90's, and the forward modeling software from a number of vendors capable of predicting resistivity tool responses for different relative angles and formation resistivities. Prior to this, Gamma ray gave some bed information, but was rarely used to dynamically adjust the well path in relation to the best oil saturation and porosity. The advent of nuclear tools for porosity and azimuthally sensitive gamma and resistivity tools, improved the ability to infer whether the wellbore should be steered up or down. The development of the Troll Oilfield by Norsk Hydro (Later Statoil and Equinor) would not have been possible without the ability to precisely geosteer within a 4 meter thick horizon to avoid gas above and water below.

From 2D and 3D models of underground substructures, deviated wells (2D and 3D) are planned in advance to achieve specific goals: exploration, fluids production, fluids injection or technical.

A ''well plan'' is a continuous succession of straight and curved lines representing the geometrical figure of the expected well path. A well plan is always projected on vertical and horizontal maps.

While the borehole is being drilled according to the well plan, new geological information is gathered from [[Mudlogger|mud logging]], [[measurement while drilling]] (MWD) and [[logging while drilling]] (LWD). These usually show some differences from what is expected from the model. As the model is continuously updated with the new geological information ([[formation evaluation]]) and the borehole position (''well deviation survey''), changes start to appear in the geological substructures and can lead to the well plan being updated to reach the corrected geological targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=geosteering|title=Oilfield Glossary|accessdate=April 27, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607145302/http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=geosteering|archivedate=June 7, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following data can be used for the geosteering: MWD, LWD, Image logs, 2D and 3D seismic data, geological models.

'''GreenRight Certified''' ('''GreenRighting''') is a certification program rewarding commercial and industrial [[green building]]s that meet a defined set of energy efficiency standards relating to lighting equipment, lighting systems, lighting power density (LPD), and associated [[building code]] compliance.

Developed by CandleRay, the GreenRight Certification is intended to provide business and facility owners with a simple framework for implementing [[energy conservation]] through highly efficient, innovative, and more practical lighting systems.  This platform is intended to ultimately streamline the adoption of more energy efficient technology, while also helping businesses improve cash flow over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DUNCAN|first=WALKER|title=CandleRay Wants to Help You Join the ‘Lighting Revolution’|url=http://southernalpha.com/general/candleray-lights-the-way-for-companies-to-join-the-lighting-revolution/|accessdate=29 July 2013|newspaper=Southern Alpha|date=7/9/2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A before and after audit process determines the [[lighting power density]] (LPD) and the decrease in total facility [[electric load]] as it applies to the lighting system.  The audit provides various improvements designed to qualify the facility for GreenRight Certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Energy Star Campaign Resources|url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=join_change_the_world.showPledgeDriverDetails&amp;cpd_id=23952|accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a ''[[frequency domain]]'' method for calculating the steady state, as opposed to the various ''[[time-domain]]'' steady state methods.  The name "harmonic balance" is descriptive of the method, which starts with Kirchhoff's Current Law written in the frequency domain and a chosen number of harmonics.  A sinusoidal signal applied to a nonlinear component in a system will generate [[harmonics]] of the fundamental frequency.   Effectively the method assumes the solution can be represented by a linear combination of sinusoids, then balances current and voltage sinusoids to satisfy Kirchhoff's law. The method is commonly used to simulate circuits which include [[nonlinear]] elements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Microwave circuits were the original application for harmonic balance methods in electrical engineering. Microwave circuits were well-suited because, historically, microwave circuits consist of many linear components which can be directly represented in the frequency domain, plus a few nonlinear components.  System sizes were typically small. For more general circuits, the method was considered impractical for all but these very small circuits until the mid-1990s, when [[Krylov subspace|Krylov subspace methods]] were applied to the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The application of preconditioned Krylov subspace methods allowed much larger systems to be solved, both in size of circuit and in numbers of harmonics. This made practical the present-day use of harmonic balance methods to analyze radio-frequency integrated circuits (RFICs).

==Algorithm==

The harmonic balance algorithm is a special version of [[:Galerkin method|Galerkin's method]]. It is used for the calculation of periodic solutions of autonomous and non-autonomous [[:Differential algebraic equation|differential-algebraic systems of equations]]. The treatment of non-autonomous systems is slightly simpler than the treatment of autonomous ones. A non-autonomous DAE system has the representation
:&lt;math&gt;
0=F(t,x,\dot x)
&lt;/math&gt;
with a sufficiently smooth function &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{C}^n\times\mathbb{C}^n\rightarrow\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of equations and &lt;math&gt;t,x,\dot x&lt;/math&gt; are placeholders for time, the vector of unknowns and the vector of time-derivatives.

The system is non-autonomous if the function &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto F(t,x,\dot x)&lt;/math&gt; is not constant for (some) fixed &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot x&lt;/math&gt;. Nevertheless, we require that there is a known ''excitation period'' &lt;math&gt;T&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;t\in\mathbb{R}\mapsto F(t,x,\dot x)&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-periodic.

A natural candidate set for the &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;-periodic solutions of the system equations is the Sobolev space &lt;math&gt;H^1_{\rm per}((0,T),\mathbb{C}^n)&lt;/math&gt; of weakly differentiable functions on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,T]&lt;/math&gt; with periodic boundary conditions &lt;math&gt;x(0)=x(T)&lt;/math&gt;.
We assume that the smoothness and the structure of &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; ensures that &lt;math&gt;F(t,x(t),\dot x(t))&lt;/math&gt; is [[Square-integrable function|square-integrable]] for all &lt;math&gt;x\in H^1_{\rm per}((0,T),\mathbb{C}^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

The system &lt;math&gt;B:=\left\{\psi_k \mid k\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}&lt;/math&gt; of harmonic functions &lt;math&gt;\psi_k:=\exp\left(i k\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Schauder basis]] of &lt;math&gt;H^1_{\rm per}((0,T),\mathbb{C}^n)&lt;/math&gt; and forms a [[Hilbert basis (linear programming)|:Hilbert basis]] of the [[Hilbert space]] &lt;math&gt;H:=L^2([0,T],\mathbb{C})&lt;/math&gt; of square-integrable functions. Therefore, each solution candidate &lt;math&gt;x\in H^1_{\rm per}((0,T),\mathbb{C}^n)&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by a Fourier-series &lt;math&gt;x(t)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty \hat x_k \exp\left(i k\frac{2\pi t}{T}\right) &lt;/math&gt; with Fourier-coefficients &lt;math&gt;\hat x_k:=\frac1T\int_0^T\psi^*_k(t)\cdot x(t)dt&lt;/math&gt; and the system equation is satisfied in the weak sense if for every base function &lt;math&gt;\psi\in B&lt;/math&gt; the variational equation
:&lt;math&gt;
0=\langle \psi, F(t,x,\dot x)\rangle_H := \frac 1 T \int_0^T \psi^*(t) \cdot F(t,x,\dot x) dt
&lt;/math&gt;
is fulfilled. This variational equation represents an infinite sequence of scalar equations since it has to be tested for the infinite number of base functions &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

The Galerkin approach to the harmonic balance is to project the candidat set as well as the test space for the variational equation to the finitely dimensional sub-space spanned by the finite base &lt;math&gt;B_N:=\{\psi_k \mid k\in\mathbb{N}\text{ with } -N \leq k \leq N\}&lt;/math&gt;.

This gives the finite-dimensional solution ansatz &lt;math&gt; x(t) = \sum_{k=-N}^N \hat x_k \psi_k(t) = \sum_{k=-N}^N \hat x_k \exp\left(i k \frac{2\pi t}{T}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and the finite set of equations
:&lt;math&gt;
0 = \langle \psi_k , F(t,x,\dot x)\rangle\quad\text{ with }k=-N,\ldots,N
&lt;/math&gt;
which can be solved numerically.

In the special context of electronics the algorithm starts with Kirchhoff's current law written in the [[frequency-domain]]. To increase the efficiency of the procedure, the circuit may be partitioned into its linear and nonlinear parts, since the linear part is readily described and calculated using [[nodal analysis]] directly in the frequency domain.

First, an initial guess is made for the solution, then an iterative process continues:

# Voltages &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are used to calculate the currents of the linear part, &lt;math&gt;I_\text{linear}&lt;/math&gt; in the frequency domain.
# Voltages &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are then used to calculate the currents in the nonlinear part, &lt;math&gt;I_\text{nonlinear}&lt;/math&gt;. Since nonlinear devices are described in the time domain, the frequency-domain voltages &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; are transformed into the time domain, typically using inverse Fast Fourier transforms. The nonlinear devices are then evaluated using the time-domain voltage waveforms to produce their time-domain currents. The currents are then transformed back into the frequency domain.
# According to [[Kirchhoff's current law|Kirchhoff's circuit laws]], the sum of the currents must be zero, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = I_\text{linear} + I_\text{nonlinear} = 0&lt;/math&gt;. An iterative process, usually [[Newton iteration]], is used to update the network voltages &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; such that the current residual &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is reduced. This step requires formulation of the [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{d\epsilon}{dV}&lt;/math&gt;.

Convergence is reached when &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; is acceptably small, at which point all voltages and currents of the steady-state solution are known, most often represented as Fourier coefficients.

==Causes==

===Biological===
{{see also|Hyperthermia#Causes}}
Heat stroke occurs when thermoregulation is overwhelmed by a combination of excessive metabolic production of heat (exertion), excessive environmental heat, and insufficient or impaired heat loss, resulting in an abnormally high body temperature. Substances that inhibit cooling and cause dehydration such as [[alcohol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Heat emergencies: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000056.htm|website = www.nlm.nih.gov|access-date = 2016-01-19|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160105060818/https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000056.htm|archivedate = January 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[stimulants]], [[medications]], and [[Ageing#Effects of ageing|age-related]] physiological changes predispose to so-called "classic" or non-exertional heat stroke (NEHS), most often in elderly and infirm individuals in summer situations with insufficient ventilation. Exertional heat stroke (EHS) can happen in young people without health problems or medications{{snd}} most often in [[athlete]]s, outdoor [[laborer]]s, or [[military personnel]] engaged in [[Exercise intensity|strenuous hot-weather activity]] or in [[certified first responder]]s wearing heavy [[personal protective equipment]]. In environments that are not only hot but also humid, it is important to recognize that [[Humidity#Human comfort|humidity]] reduces the degree to which the body can cool itself by perspiration and evaporation. For humans and other [[warm-blooded]] animals, excessive body temperature can disrupt enzymes regulating biochemical reactions that are essential for cellular respiration and the functioning of major organs.&lt;ref name=Harrisons/&gt;

===Cars===
When the outside temperature is {{convert|21|C|F}}, the temperature inside a car parked in direct sunlight can quickly exceed {{convert|49|C|F}}. Young children or elderly adults left alone in a vehicle are at particular risk of succumbing to heat stroke. "Heat stroke in children and in the elderly can occur within minutes, even if a car window is opened slightly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA116734855&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=pcc&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=5ea3436f092cfd2b9740e6d9a3b7d2e8|title = A primer on summer safety|last = Meadows|first = Michelle|date = 2014|journal = Academic OneFile|doi = |pmid = |access-date = January 18, 2016|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161005095654/http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA116734855&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=pcc&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=5ea3436f092cfd2b9740e6d9a3b7d2e8|archivedate = October 5, 2016|df = mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these groups of individuals may not be able to open car doors or to express discomfort verbally (or audibly, inside a closed car), their plight may not be immediately noticed by others in the vicinity.

Dogs are even more susceptible than humans to heat stroke in cars, as dogs cannot produce whole-body sweat to cool themselves. Leaving the dog at home with plenty of water on hot days is recommended instead, or, if a dog must be brought along, it can be [[Leash|tied up]] outside the destination and provided with a full water bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_HotCars.php |title=Dogs in Hot Cars |publisher=Partnership for Animal Welfare |accessdate=February 11, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210200108/http://www.paw-rescue.org/PAW/PETTIPS/DogTip_HotCars.php |archivedate=February 10, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
The risk of heat stroke can be reduced by observing precautions to avoid overheating and dehydration. Light, loose-fitting clothes will allow perspiration to evaporate and cool the body. Wide-brimmed hats in light colors help prevent the sun from warming the head and neck. Vents on a hat will help cool the head, as will sweatbands wetted with cool water. Strenuous exercise should be avoided during hot weather, especially in the sun peak hours. Also do not remaining in [[confined space]]s (such as automobiles) without [[air-conditioning]] or adequate [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]].

In hot weather, people need to drink plenty of cool liquids and [[mineral salt]]s to replace fluids lost from [[Perspiration|sweating]]. [[Thirst]] is not a reliable sign that a person needs fluids. A better indicator is the color of [[urine]]. A dark yellow color may indicate dehydration.&lt;ref name=OSH&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-174/pdfs/2011-174.pdf |title=InfoSheet: Protecting Workers from Heat Illness |publisher=OSHA–NIOSH |date=2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616084925/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2011-174/pdfs/2011-174.pdf |archivedate=June 16, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] in the United States publishes a QuickCard with a checklist designed to help protect from heat stress:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3154.pdf |title=QuickCard: Protecting Workers from Heat Stress |publisher=OSHA |date=2014 |accessdate=February 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117222652/https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3154.pdf |archivedate=January 17, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Know signs/symptoms of heat-related illnesses.
* Block out direct sun and other heat sources.
* Drink fluids often, and ''before'' you are thirsty.
* Wear lightweight, light-colored, loose-fitting clothes.
* Avoid beverages containing alcohol or caffeine.

==Treatment==
Treatment of heat stroke involves rapid mechanical cooling along with standard resuscitation measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide | edition =6th |last=Tintinalli |first=Judith |authorlink=|year=2004 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=|isbn=0-07-138875-3 |page=1188 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The body temperature must be lowered quickly. The person should be moved to a cool area (indoors, or at least in the shade) and clothing removed to promote heat loss (passive cooling). Active cooling methods should also be used, if possible: The person is bathed in cold water, or a hyperthermia vest can be applied. (However, wrapping the person in wet towels or clothes can actually act as insulation and increase the body temperature.) Cold compresses to the [[torso]], head, neck, and [[groin]] will help cool the victim. A fan or dehumidifying air-conditioning unit may be used to aid in evaporation of the water (evaporative method).

Immersing a person into a tub of cold water (immersion method) is a widely recognized method of cooling. This method may require the effort of several people and the person should be monitored carefully during the treatment process. Immersion should be avoided for an unconscious person, but if there is no alternative, the person's head must be held above water.

Immersion in very cold water was once thought to be counterproductive by reducing blood flow to the skin and thereby preventing heat from escaping the body core. However, this hypothesis has been challenged in experimental studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12937427 |year=2002 |last1=Clements |first1=JM |last2=Casa |first2=DJ |last3=Knight |first3=J |last4=McClung |first4=JM |last5=Blake |first5=AS |last6=Meenen |first6=PM |last7=Gilmer |first7=AM |last8=Caldwell |first8=KA |title=Ice-Water Immersion and Cold-Water Immersion Provide Similar Cooling Rates in Runners with Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia |volume=37 |issue=2 |pages=146–150 |pmc=164337 |journal=Journal of Athletic Training}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=12626467 |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12626467 |doi=10.1152/japplphysiol.00541.2002 |year=2003 |last1=Proulx |first1=CI |last2=Ducharme |first2=MB |last3=Kenny |first3=GP |title=Effect of water temperature on cooling efficiency during hyperthermia in humans |volume=94 |issue=4 |pages=1317–1323 |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as by systematic reviews of the clinical data,&lt;ref name=J-Athl&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4085/1062-6050-44.1.84 |title=Acute Whole-Body Cooling for Exercise-Induced Hyperthermia: A Systematic Review |year=2009 |last1=McDermott |first1=Brendon P. |last2=Casa |first2=Douglas J. |last3=Ganio |first3=Matthew S. |last4=Lopez |first4=Rebecca M. |last5=Yeargin |first5=Susan W. |last6=Armstrong |first6=Lawrence E. |last7=Maresh |first7=Carl M. |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=44 |pages=84–93 |pmid=19180223 |issue=1 |pmc=2629045}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4085/1062-6050-45.5.439 |title=Cold-Water Immersion and the Treatment of Hyperthermia: Using 38.6°C as a Safe Rectal Temperature Cooling Limit |year=2010 |last1=Gagnon |first1=Daniel |last2=Lemire |first2=Bruno B. |last3=Casa |first3=Douglas J. |last4=Kenny |first4=Glen P. |journal=Journal of Athletic Training |volume=45 |issue=5 |pages=439–444 |pmid=20831387 |pmc=2938313}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that cutaneous [[vasoconstriction]] and [[shivering|shivering thermogenesis]] do not play a dominant role in the decrease in core body temperature brought on by cold water immersion. This can be seen in the effect of submersion [[hypothermia]], where the body temperature decrease is directly related to environmental temperature, and though [[Cold shock response|bodily defenses]] slow the decrease in temperature for a time, they ultimately fail to maintain endothermic homeostasis. [[Dantrolene]], a direct-acting paralytic which abolishes shuddering and is effective in many other forms of hyperthermia, including [[serotonin syndrome|centrally-]], [[malignant hyperthermia|peripherally-]] and [[2,4-dinitrophenol|cellularly-mediated]] thermogenesis, has no individual or additive effects to cooling in the context of heat stroke,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1186/cc2939 |year=2004 |last1=Hausfater |first1=Pierre |journal=Critical Care |volume=9 |pages=23–24 |pmid=15693976 |title=Dantrolene and heatstroke: A good molecule applied in an unsuitable situation |issue=1 |pmc=1065093}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a lack of endogenous thermogenic response to cold water immersion. Thus, aggressive ice-water immersion remains the [[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]] for life-threatening heat stroke.&lt;ref name=J-Athl/&gt;

Hydration is important in cooling the person. In mild cases of concomitant dehydration, this can be achieved by drinking water, or commercial isotonic [[sports drink]]s may be used as a substitute. In exercise- or heat-induced dehydration, [[electrolyte imbalance]] can result, and can be worsened by [[water intoxication|excess consumption of water]]. [[Hyponatremia]] can be corrected by intake of [[hypertonic]] fluids. Absorption is rapid and complete in most people but if the person is confused, unconscious, or unable to tolerate oral fluid, then an [[intravenous drip]] may be necessary for rehydration and electrolyte replacement.

The person's condition should be reassessed and stabilized by [[Medic|trained medical personnel]]. The person's heart rate and breathing should be monitored, and [[CPR]] may be necessary if the person goes into [[cardiac arrest]].

==Prognosis==
It was long believed that heat strokes lead only rarely to permanent deficits and that [[convalescence]] is almost complete. However, following the [[1995 Chicago heat wave]], researchers from the [[University of Chicago Medical Center]] studied all 58 patients with heat stroke severe enough to require intensive care at 12 area hospitals between July 12 and 20, 1995, ranging in age from 25 to 95 years. Nearly half of these patients died within a year{{snd}} 21 percent before and 28 percent after release from the hospital. Many of the survivors had permanent loss of independent function; one-third had severe functional impairment at discharge, and none of them had improved after one year. The study also recognized that because of overcrowded conditions in all the participating hospitals during the crisis, the immediate care{{snd}} which is critical{{snd}} was not as comprehensive as it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1998/19980801-heatstroke-aim.html |title=Classic heat stroke during Chicago 1995 heat wave |publisher=University of Chicago Medicine |date=August 1, 1998 |accessdate=July 22, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604114740/http://www.uchospitals.edu/news/1998/19980801-heatstroke-aim.html |archivedate=June 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other animals==
Heatstroke can affect livestock, especially in hot, humid weather; or if the horse, cow, sheep or other is unfit, overweight, has a dense coat, is overworked, or is left in a horsebox in full sun. Symptoms include drooling, panting, high temperature, sweating, and rapid pulse.

The animal should be moved to shade, drenched in cold water and offered water or electrolyte to drink.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horse and Hound]], 'First Aid: Handling Heatstroke', 2/8/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2008-04-25 Netpliance i-Opener main menu.jpg|thumb|right|An i-Opener showing the main menu after a fresh boot-up]]
The '''i-Opener''' was a low-cost [[internet appliance]] produced by Netpliance (now known as [[TippingPoint]]) between the years 1999 and 2002. The hardware, cheaply available, became popular among collectors who modified the appliance to run as a normal [[Personal Computer|PC]]. This made the [[Computer hardware|device]] capable of running [[Personal computer|PC]] [[operating system]]s, such as [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

The original retail price was $99. The actual cost of the device was roughly estimated between $300 and $400. The devices were sold as a [[loss leader]] for monthly Internet service. However, as soon as a [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacking]] method became available on the Internet (in 2000), many customers canceled the monthly service, which eventually made the business model unsustainable. Similar [[business model]]s and failures were also seen with the [[3Com Audrey]] and [[Virgin Webplayer]].

==Hacking==
[[File:2008-04-25 Netpliance i-Opener RAM modules.jpg|thumb|left|View of the SO-DIMM RAM module inside the i-Opener]]
James Kmetz, a [[hacker]] from [[Indiana]], discovered that the i-Opener was simply an x86 compatible PC inside a custom enclosure.  When he removed the back cover of the device, he found a [[Socket 7]] [[CPU socket]] with a 180&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Integrated Device Technology|IDT]] [[WinChip|WinChip C6]] CPU, a [[SO-DIMM]] socket, an [[Integrated Drive Electronics|IDE]] plug (which allowed adding a [[hard drive]] and [[CD drive|CD-ROM]], making the device nothing less than a $99 PC with an [[LCD screen]]), and a 16 MB [[SanDisk]] memory chip. However, the pins on the IDE connector were reversed, requiring the making or ordering of special cables and adapters to connect a hard drive to the unit. Attempts by Netpliance to thwart hacking included gluing the [[BIOS]] chip into its socket with [[epoxy]] and modifying its settings (rendering it unable to detect hard drives), limiting the type of CPU one could use to that included with the unit, and even cutting the pins on the IDE [[Electrical connector|connector]].

'''Intelligence Node''' is a global [[technology]] company that specializes in the development of analytical products and services using a [[Software as a service|SaaS]]-based delivery model focused on [[price optimization]]. The company generates analytics from [[Big data|Big Data]] pertaining to the [[retail industry]]. Intelligence Node was constituted in 2012 as a consulting firm and since then has evolved into the retail space as the provider of an analytics platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intelligencenode.com/about-us.php About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History/Background ==

Intelligence Node was incepted in 2012 as a consulting company that focused on providing expert consulting to the retailers in the [[e-commerce]] [[apparel]] domain. The company was co-founded by Sanjeev Sularia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaikh|first1=Shadma|title=How technology is helping e-commerce players solve recurrent problems|url=http://retail.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/e-commerce/e-tailing/how-technology-is-helping-e-commerce-players-solve-recurrent-problems/54517009|website=economictimes|accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO of Intelligence Node and Yasen Dimitrov, COO of Intelligence Node. Sularia previously worked as the CFO for Exclusively.in (an e-commerce portal for upscale fashion), now acquired by Snapdeal, and CFO for Shersingh.com (a private label e-commerce [[fast fashion]] portal), now under Myntra. While Yasen was the Practice Leader at the Boston Consulting Group (BCG) in their London office. Prior to this, he was the Head of Research and Analytics in a boutique financial research lab in London. Intelligence Node began its operations with seven members at [[Mumbai]], [[India]]. The company currently has offices in [[London]], [[New York City]], and [[Dubai]] along with Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itroadmap.in/feature/IntelligenceNode-Big-Data-Analytics|website=IT Roadmap|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enterprise expanded its consulting business into retail analytics that provides real-time information to the retailers by enabling them to gain access to pools of data generated globally, and also resources to synthesize them.  Retailers can use the products as trading platforms where they can implement a [[dynamic pricing]] model based on accurate and reliable insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sularia|first1=Sanjeev|title=Turn Your e-Commerce Platform Into Real-Time Trading Desk|url=http://saas.cioreviewindia.com/cxoinsight/turn-your-ecommerce-platform-into-realtime-trading-desk-nid-1929-cid-53.html|website=CIO Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The technology engaged by the company encompasses a SaaS-based platform that scans the [[internet]] for the [[pricing strategies]] and cataloging models of over 1 billion products of more than 130,000 brands sold in around 1,100 categories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://intimohub.com/blog/lingerie-brand-prettysecrets-to-use-intelligence-node-to-maximize-its-online-competitiveness-48.html|website=Intimo Hub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Intelligence Node raised $4 million in [[Series A funding]] from [[New Enterprise Associates]] and Orios Venture Partners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retail Analytics Startup IntelligenceNODE Raises $4M From NEA And Orios|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/19/intelligencenode/|website=Tech Crunch|accessdate=19 August 2015|publisher=Catherine Shu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and now plans to expand its operations in the US and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Having already secured significant investor backing, IntelligenceNODE looks to take retailer analytics to the next level|url=http://startupbeat.com/2015/02/featured-startup-pitch-intelligencenode-id5010/|website=Startup Beat|accessdate=17 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the company offers two products- Incompetitor which is a SaaS based offering that helps in competitor price assortment and benchmarking, and Inoptimizer, a rules-based optimization engine, which enables price optimization. The products make it possible for the retailers to offer everyday low pricing instead of specific period discounts.The analytics take into consideration the pricing variances based on the geographical locations of the customers allowing merchants to streamline the pricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In my opinion: retailers need basket-based, real-time, strategizing, says Intelligence Node|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/opinion-retailers-need-basket-based-real-time-strategizing-says-intelligence-node/|website=Retail Times|publisher=Fiona Briggs|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence Node seeks  to fill the gap in the retail industry through its Big Data Analytics by enabling retailers to get details of what their competitors are offering.  Intelligence Node’s solutions also analyze the product turnover rate of the global [[fashion industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dimitrov|first1=Yasen|title=3 areas where rivals beat Amazon|url=https://www.internetretailer.com/2015/10/16/3-areas-where-rivals-beat-amazon|website=Internet retailer|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the products are offered a subscription-based licensing service to the users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In my opinion: retailers need basket-based, real-time, strategizing, says Intelligence Node|url=http://www.retailtimes.co.uk/opinion-retailers-need-basket-based-real-time-strategizing-says-intelligence-node/|website=Retail Times|publisher=Fiona Briggs|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a part of its global expansion strategy, Intelligence Node has integrated multilingual support&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intelligence Node Takes e-Businesses Global With Multilingual Support|url=https://www.internetretailer.com/2016/04/14/intelligence-node-takes-e-businesses-global|website=Internet Retailer|accessdate=14 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; into its applications.  Currently, the platforms support 29 major languages, which represent around 95% of the total global GDP.  It will enable the company to serve a global clientele and make its processes internationally scalable.
 
In 2016, Indonesian lifestyle retail giant Mitra Adiperska (MAP) entered into a contract with Intelligence Node for its analytical services. MAP operates across a range of retail products including apparel, food and sports equipment, and is the Indonesian master franchise partner for prominent brands that include [[Zara (retailer)|Zara]], [[Starbucks]], [[New Balance]] and [[Marks &amp; Spencer|M&amp;S]]. Another major organization that has partnered with Intelligence Node is Bfashion, a Bulgarian fashion retailer.

In Feb 2017, Intelligence Node announced &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading Retail Analytics Firm Intelligence Node Secures Three New Premium Retail Customers|url=https://finance.yahoo.com/news/leading-retail-analytics-firm-intelligence-201500478.html|website=Finance Yahoo |accessdate=2 Feb 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the recent acquisition of three new global customers. The new wins include the UK's MADE.com, Brazil's Mobly, and India's Tata CLiQ.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2930">[[Image:Optical-dichrotic-filter-0.5inch.jpg|thumb|Band-pass interference filter for laser experiments]]
An '''interference filter''' or '''[[dichroic filter]]''' is an [[optical filter]] that reflects one or more spectral bands or lines and transmits others, while maintaining a nearly zero coefficient of [[absorption (optics)|absorption]] for all wavelengths of interest. An interference filter may be [[high-pass]], [[low-pass]], [[bandpass]], or band-rejection.

An interference filter consists of multiple thin layers of [[dielectric]] material having different refractive indices. There also may be metallic layers. In its broadest meaning, interference filters comprise also etalons that could be implemented as tunable interference filters. Interference filters are [[wavelength]]-selective by virtue of the [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] effects that take place between the incident and reflected waves at the thin-film boundaries. The important characteristic of the filter is the form of the leaving signal. It is considered that the best form is a rectangle.

Bandpass filters are normally designed for normal incidence. However, when the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the incoming light is increased from zero, the central wavelength of the filter decreases, resulting in partial tunability.  The transmission band widens and the maximum transmission decreases.&lt;ref&gt;P. H. Lissberger and W. L. Wilcock, ''J. Opt. Soc. Am.'', '''49''' p. 126-130, (February 1959).&lt;/ref&gt; If λ&lt;sub&gt;''c''&lt;/sub&gt; is the central wavelength, λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the central wavelength at normal incidence, and ''n''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is the filter effective index of refraction, then:&lt;ref&gt;X. Baillard, A. Gauguet, S. Bize, P. Lemonde, Ph. Laurent, A. Clairon, P. Rosenbusch, Interference-filter-stabilized external-cavity diode lasers, Optics Communications, Volume 266, Issue 2, 15 October 2006, Pages 609-613&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\lambda_c = \lambda_0  \sqrt{1-\frac{\sin^2\theta}{{n^*}^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

For example, for λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;=1550&amp;nbsp;nm, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;=1.5, Δλ = λ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;−λ&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;=32&amp;nbsp;nm, the rotation angle is
θ = 17.7°. This corresponds to [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]] or [[L-band]] in 1550&amp;nbsp;nm [[fiber-optic]] [[Telecommunication|communications]] window. Equipped with a [[stepper motor]] and electronics, a tunable optical filter that tunes center transmission wavelength over C-band or L-band by remote control can be achieved. See diagram below for its working principle and tunable optical filter devices.

It also defines "internationalized" versions corresponding to other constructs from [RFC3986], such as URI references.  The syntax of IRIs is defined in section 2, and the relationship between IRIs and URIs in section 3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in 2005 as a new internet standard to extend the existing URI scheme. The primary standard is defined by the RFC 3987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987|title=Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)|last=Suignard|first=Michel|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987#section-1.3|title=Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)|last=Suignard|first=Michel|website=tools.ietf.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; While URIs are limited to a subset of the ASCII character set, IRIs may contain characters from the [[Universal Character Set]] (Unicode/[[ISO 10646]]), including Chinese or Japanese [[kanji]], [[Korean alphabet|Korean]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] characters, and so forth.

== Syntax ==
IRIs extend URIs by using the [[Universal Character Set]], where URIs were limited to [[ASCII]], with far fewer characters.  IRIs may be represented by a sequence of octets but by definition are defined as a sequence of characters, because IRIs may be spoken or written by hand.&lt;ref name="rfc3987" /&gt;&lt;!-- section 2.0 --&gt;

== Compatibility ==
IRIs are mapped to URIs to retain backwards-compatibility with systems that do not support the new format.&lt;ref name=rfc3987&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duerst|first1=M.|title=RFC 3987|journal=Network Working Group|date=2005|volume=Standards Track|url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3987|accessdate=12 October 2014|publisher=Internet Engineering Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For applications and protocols that do not allow direct consumption of IRIs, the IRI should first be converted to Unicode using [[Unicode equivalence|canonical composition normalization (NFC)]], if not already in Unicode format.

All non-ASCII code points in the IRI should next be encoded as [[UTF-8]], and the resulting bytes [[Percent-encoding|percent-encoded]], to produce a valid URI.

Example: The IRI https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Ῥόδος becomes the URI https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BF%AC%CF%8C%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%82

ASCII code points that are invalid URI characters ''may'' be encoded the same way, depending on implementation.&lt;ref name="rfc3987" /&gt;

This conversion is easily reversible; by definition, converting an IRI to an URI and back again will yield an IRI that is semantically equivalent to the original IRI, even though it may differ in exact representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hendler|first1=Hrsg. Dieter Fensel; Hrsg. John Domingue; Hrsg. James A.|title=Handbook of Semantic Web Technologies|date=2010|publisher=Springer-Verlag GmbH|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-92912-3|edition=1. Aufl.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sdEFvSb9WNsC&amp;dq|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some protocols may impose further transformations; e.g. [[Punycode]] for [[Domain Name System|DNS]] labels.

== Advantages ==
There are reasons to see URIs displayed in different languages; mostly, it makes it easier for users who are unfamiliar with the Latin (A-Z) alphabet. Assuming that it isn't too difficult for anyone to replicate arbitrary Unicode on their keyboards, this can make the [[URI]] system more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clark|first1=Kendall|title=Internationalizing the URI|url=http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2003/05/07/deviant.html|publisher=O’Reilly Media, Inc.|accessdate=12 October 2014|date=2003-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==
Mixing IRIs and [[ASCII]] [[uniform resource identifier|URIs]] can make it much easier to execute [[phishing]] attacks that trick someone into believing they are on a different site that they really are. For example, one can replace an ASCII "a" in &lt;code&gt;www.myfictionalbank.com&lt;/code&gt; with the Unicode look-alike "[[α]]", and point that IRI to a malicious site. This is known as an [[IDN homograph attack]].

While a URI does not provide people with a way to specify Web resources using their own alphabets, an IRI does not make clear how Web resources can be accessed with keyboards that are not capable of generating the requisite internationalized characters. This does mean that IRIs are now handled in a way very similar to many other software which might require the use of a non-keyboard [[input method]] when dealing with texts in various languages.

The winner team was suju.online, who created a tool for event organizers and public transportation decision makers that allows them to design dynamic routing for the self-driving bus. The team originated from the local [[Aalto University]] and the hack was part of the Future of Mobility-track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tekniikkatalous.fi/tekniikka/suomalaiset-koodarit-veivat-voiton-suuressa-hackathonissa-itseohjautuvien-bussien-palvelu-toi-20-000-euroa-6602929|title=Suomalaiset koodarit veivät voiton suuressa hackathonissa – itseohjautuvien bussien palvelu toi 20 000 euroa|website=www.tekniikkatalous.fi|access-date=2017-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Liquid Elastomer Molding''' (LEM) [[gasket]] consists of a metallic core, coated in selected areas on both sides with a thin layer of [[silicone]] with molded-in sealing beads. These beads have differing heights and widths dependent on the clamping load distribution and application requirements. The base [[elastomer]] coating provides a good overall micro-seal with the silicone beads ensuring optimum sealing in the critical areas. LEM can also include molding on its edge either for sealing of high pressure fluids or for [[T joint]]s between mating [[flange]]s.&lt;ref name=lem&gt;{{cite web|title=Liquid Elastomer Molding Home|url=http://www.lem-technology.com/|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fedmog&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal-Mogul Corporation Home|url=http://www.federal-mogul.com/|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Mammals and Birds Excluder Device or MBED''' (also named '''Cachalotera''') is a fishing gear device that avoids the depredation of the fish caught in the line for [[Marine Mammal]]s, and avoids the entanglement of [[seabirds]] when is setting the line and hauling.  This device was designed mainly for the interactions with toothed whales: [[Sperm Whale]]s and [[Killer Whale]]s. {{ref|Moreno}}{{ref|Pin}}{{ref|Rojas}}

== Mechanism ==

The Mammals and Birds Excluder Device (MBED) consists in a modification to the traditional Spanish bottom [[longline fishing|longline]] used in the fishery of [[Patagonian toothfish]] (''Dissostichus eleginoides''). Several configurations are in use depending on the country, and fishermen. The first descriptions were issued in [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]], starting the tests in 2006. 

The main bottom longline is set in a simple way with a main line rigging from which many secondary or branch lines are hanging, of about 12 to 15 m long. On each of these lines, a cone-shaped device or protection net is placed in each secondary line, made by two metallic rings on the edge covered by a mesh net: the upper ring of 20&amp;nbsp;cm of diameter consisting in encased wire ending in retention rigging; and a lower ring of 100&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, with a separation distance between both rings of 180&amp;nbsp;cm. The mesh net composing the device is 7.5&amp;nbsp;cm, and on the upper ring, it ends in a knot allowing movement through the branch lines. Such branch lines are separated from 55 m to 70 m between them, and may be set in variable styles according to the hauling speed. One set contains 6 hooks, and such sets are prepared on the basis of 4 per box. This device as a whole has less density than the end weights (5 to 10&amp;nbsp;kg) and consequently, it rises up to the retention when hauling, and the hooks are uncovered when it reaches the bottom. When the longline is hauled back, the cone-shaped device is moved to the lower part of the branch lines, covering the hooks and consequently protecting the catch. The hooks are rigged in a piece divided into two bunches of 6 hooks each, being the main piece of 170&amp;nbsp;cm long and a diameter of 6&amp;nbsp;mm, and the two bunches are separated at 50&amp;nbsp;cm one from the other, the secondary lines (12 per piece) are 30&amp;nbsp;cm long and made of 4&amp;nbsp;mm diameter [[Multifilament fishing line|multifilament lines]].{{ref|Pin}}

== History ==

First tests were carried out in 2006 in Chile and Uruguay in the longline fisherie of Toothfish (''D. eleginoides'') in the case of Uruguay the main assessment were carried out in the FV Banzare operating in two different fishing areas at 40° and 50° latitudes in the Southwestern Atlantic from March to May 2007.  The development of this fishing gear was monitored by [[Fisheries observer]]s on board in all the cases{{ref|Moreno}}{{ref|Pin}}{{ref|Rojas}}

== Achievements ==

In all the cases, the incidental capture of birds registered was absolute: no bird was captured when the MBED was used on the fishing gear, no marine bird mortalities were due to gear captures during this study. 
The MBED works in two aspects: 
*1) the weight attached gives a superior sinking rate,
*2) the mesh sleeve that surrounds the captured piece, avoids the access from mammals and marine birds to the fish or the hooks during the hauling of the gear. While using the MBED, with the weight average of 8.5&amp;nbsp;kg and approximately 40 meters distance between the next, the overall average sinking rate of the longline gear was 1.03&amp;nbsp;m/s (Uruguayan tests FV Banzare){{ref|Pin}}, this rate is markedly superior to the 0.3&amp;nbsp;m/s demanded by the  [[CCAMLR]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080722064220/http://www.ccamlr.org/pu/E/e_pubs/cm/07-08/toc.htm Conservation Measure 24-02 (2004).]

The MTBO is calculated by the equation,

&lt;math&gt;MTBO = \frac{MTBF}{1-FFAS}&lt;/math&gt;

where MTBF is the nonredundant [[mean time between failures]] and FFAS is the fraction of failures for which the failed equipment is automatically bypassed.

{{In popular culture|section|date=January 2017}}
The original [[Wonder Woman]] comic book character carried a medical bag (as a Lt. Nurse) in which she carried her costume and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wonder Woman (TV series)#Season 1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, the [[MV Joyita]] charter boat was found partially submerged after being missing for 5 weeks. Among the items found onboard was a doctor's bag containing a stethoscope, a scalpel, and four lengths of blood-stained bandages.

In the television sitcom ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' (1962–1971), Granny Clampett is a backwoods doctor who has a medical bag.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvacres.com/medical_supplies_granny.htm Granny's Medical Bag], [[TV Acres]], retrieved 27 June 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Doctor Ross]] (Charles Isaiah Ross, 1925–1993) was an American blues musician nicknamed "Doctor" because of his habit of carrying his harmonicas in a black bag that resembled a doctor's bag.

"[[The Little Black Bag]]" is a short story by American science fiction author [[Cyril M. Kornbluth]], first published in July 1950, about a disgraced doctor who comes across a medical bag from over a century in the future. It is the basis for a segment by the same name of Rod Serling’s ''[[Night Gallery]]'' which aired December 23, 1970.

In 1956, [[Lynn Pressman Raymond]] (of the [[Pressman Toy Corporation]]) created the "Doctor Bag" [[toy]] to help children feel more comfortable with visits to the doctor. Seeing the anxiety of her children on visits to the doctor due to ill health or for vaccinations, she created the Doctor Bag—which included a [[stethoscope]], [[syringe]], and other pretend medical supplies—to help kids deal with their fears.

In the 1984 film ''[[Crimes of Passion (1984 film)|Crimes of Passion]]'', the "Reverend" Peter Shayne (played by Anthony Perkins) carries a doctor's bag full of sex toys.

The main character of 1990s television series ''[[Northern Exposure]]'', Dr. Joel Fleishman, carries a medical bag when making housecalls.

Books about doctor's bags include ''What's in a Doctor's Bag?'' by [[Neil B. Shulman]] and [[Sibley Fleming]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=What's in a Doctor's Bag? |last1=Shulman |first1=Neil B. |last2=Fleming |first2=Sibley|date=October 1994 |publisher=Rx Humor |isbn=0-9639002-3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''My Doctor's Bag'' (2002, {{ISBN|978-0-7894-8520-5}}) by [[Anne Millard]].

Some video games, such as the [[Battlefield (video game series)|''Battlefield'' series]] (2002–present) and ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'' (2010), use medical bags to increase the player's [[health (gaming)|health]].

The ITV British police drama ''[[Heartbeat (UK TV series)|Heartbeat]]'' 2006 episode [[List of Heartbeat episodes#Series Sixteen (2006–2007)|"Dead Men Do Tell Tales"]] is about a nurse, Carol Cassidy (played by Lisa Kay), who rushes off to treat an emergency, but absent-mindedly leaves her medical bag in her car which contains dangerous drugs; Carol has to fight for her career when local boys steal the bag.

Throughout the series [[House (TV series)|House M.D.]], each time that Dr. House had his fellows break-into a patient's home to check for environmental toxins they each brought a medical bag with them containing (in addition to medical testing supplies), [[burglary|breaking and entering]] equipment. 

In 2011, the [[New York Times]] reported that the [[Susan B. Anthony House]] museum had sold a large quantity of "a $250 [[handbag]] made of fake alligator that was inspired by one of Anthony’s own club bags, similar to a doctor’s bag," noting that for Anthony, "a bag was not a fashion statement but a symbol of independence at a time when women were not allowed to [[Freedom of contract|enter into a contract]] or even open a bank account."&lt;ref&gt;

In the 2014 TV series, Constantine, John Constantine carries around a medical bag filled with an assortment of supernatural tools.

'''Metco 308''' is a [[graphite]] [[cermet]] powder used to lubricate [[gas turbine engine|gas turbine]] and [[jet engine]]s. It is applied using a [[combustion gas]] [[spray gun]] such as the Metco 6p gun or equivalent. It operates in service temperatures up to {{convert|900|F|C}}. It is composed of 85% [[nickel]] and 15% graphite, Metco 308 produces what is essentially an [[oxide]]-free machine element seal.

Both Metco 307 and 308 have the same chemical structure, but the particle sizes are different. Metco 307 is more [[abradable]] and less [[erosion]]-resistant than 308.

A '''military satellite''' is an [[artificial satellite]] used for a [[military]] purpose. The most common missions are [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] gathering, navigation and military [[communications satellite|communications]]. The first military satellites were photographic reconnaissance missions. Some attempts were made to develop satellite based weapons but this work was halted in 1967 following the ratification of international treaties banning the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in orbit. As of 2013, there are 950 satellites of all types in Earth orbit. It is not possible to identify the exact number of these that are military satellites partly due to secrecy and partly due to dual purpose missions such as [[GPS]] satellites that serve both civilian and military purposes.

==Military reconnaissance satellites==
[[File:CORONA film recovery maneuvar.jpg|thumb|left|Image showing the recovery process for a Discoverer film canister.]]
The first military use of satellites was for reconnaissance.

In the United States the first formal military satellite programs, Weapon System 117L, was developed in the mid 1950s.&lt;ref name=milsatmag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.milsatmagazine.com/story.php?number=1811044549|title=Military Satellite Systems: A History — Part One|date=May 2008|accessdate=2014-01-21|publisher=MilsatMagazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this program a number of sub-programs were developed including [[Corona (satellite)|Corona]].&lt;ref name=milsatmag/&gt;  Satellites within the Corona program carried different code names. The first launches were code named Discoverer. This mission was a series of [[reconnaissance satellite]]s, designed to enter orbit, take high-resolution photographs and then return the payload to Earth via parachute.&lt;ref name=milsatmag/&gt; [[Discoverer 1]], the first mission, was launched on 28 February 1959 although it didn't carry a payload being intended as a test flight to prove the technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[NASA]]|title=This Week in NASA History: Discoverer 1|date=23 February 2007|accessdate=2014-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corona program continued until 25 May 1972.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} It was abandoned after a Soviet Navy submarine was detected waiting beneath a mid-air retrieval zone in the Pacific Ocean.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} Corona was followed by other programs including [[Canyon (satellite)|Canyon]] (seven launches between 1968 and 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/back/news.369 |format=TXT |title=Jonathan's Space Report : No. 369 |website=Planet4589.org |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Aquacade (satellite)|Aquacade]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[James Bamford]]|title=[[The Shadow Factory]]|year=2008|publisher=Doubleday|page=176}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Orion (satellite)|Orion]] (stated by US Government sources to be extremely large&lt;ref name="afa100913"&gt;{{cite web | title=National Reconnaissance Office Update| url=http://www.afa.org/events/conference/2010/scripts/AFA-100913-Carlson.pdf | author=Bruce Carlson |publisher = Air &amp; Space Conference and Technology Exposition 2010 | accessdate=2010-11-25 | date=2010-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;). There have also been a number of subsequent programs including [[Magnum (satellite)|Magnum]] and [[Trumpet (satellite)|Trumpet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/1995/31/Riesige_Lauscher_am_Himmel|title=Riesige Lauscher am Himmel|publisher=Die Zeit|date=28 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these remain classified and therefore many details remain speculative.

The [[Soviet Union]] began the [[Almaz]] ({{lang-ru|Алмаз}}) program in the early 1960s. This program involved placing space stations in Earth orbit as an alternative to satellites. Three stations were launched between 1973 and 1976: [[Salyut 2]], [[Salyut 3]] and [[Salyut 5]]. Following Salyut 5, the Soviet Ministry of Defence judged in 1978 that the time consumed by station maintenance outweighed the benefits relative to automatic reconnaissance satellites.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 2015, United States military space units, and commercial satellite operator [[Intelsat]], became concerned about apparent reconnaissance test maneuvers by [[Government of Russia|Russian]] [[Luch (satellite)|Luch]] (or [[Olymp-K|Olymp]]) satellite which was launched in September 2014, when it maneuvered between the [[Intelsat 7]] and [[Intelsat 901]] satellites which are located only half a degree from one another in [[geosynchronous orbit]].&lt;ref name="sn20151009"&gt;

==Navigation satellites==
[[File:ConstellationGPS.gif|thumb|right|A simulation of the original design of the GPS space segment, with 24 GPS satellites (4 satellites in each of 6 orbits)]]
The first satellite navigation system, Transit, used by the [[United States Navy]], was tested in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howell|first=Elizabeth|title=Navstar: GPS Satellite Network|url=http://www.space.com/19794-navstar.html|publisher=SPACE.com|accessdate=February 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It used a [[satellite constellation|constellation]] of five satellites and could provide a navigational fix approximately once per hour.

During the [[Cold War]] [[arms race]], the nuclear threat was used to justify the cost of providing a more capable system. These developments led eventually to the deployment of the [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS). The US Navy required precise navigation to enable  [[submarine]]s to get an accurate fix of their positions before they launched their SLBMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018151253/http://www.trimble.com/gps/whygps.shtml#0|archivedate=October 18, 2007|title=Why Did the Department of Defense Develop GPS?|publisher=Trimble Navigation Ltd|accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The USAF had requirements for a more accurate and reliable navigation system, as did the [[United States Army]] for geodetic surveying &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19660002550_1966002550.pdf |format=PDF |title=Release No: 65-333 : Project Geodetic Explorer-A |date=1965-10-29 |website=Ntrs.nasa.gov |accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which purpose they had developed the SECOR system. SECOR used ground-based transmitters from known locations that sent signals to satellite transponder in orbit. A fourth ground-based station, at an undetermined position, could then use those signals to fix its location precisely. The last SECOR satellite was launched in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm|title=SECOR Chronology|work=Mark Wade's Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=January 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116213013/http://astronautix.com/craft/secor.htm|archivedate=January 16, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the first experimental Block-I GPS satellite was launched&lt;ref name="ieee2008"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Evolution of the Global Navigation SatelliteSystem (GNSS) | first1 = Christopher J. | last1 = Hegarty | first2 = Eric | last2 = Chatre | journal = Proceedings of the IEEE | date = December 2008 | pages = 1902–1917 | doi = 10.1109/JPROC.2008.2006090 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by December 1993, GPS achieved initial operational capability (IOC), indicating a full constellation (24 satellites) was available and providing the Standard Positioning Service (SPS).&lt;ref name="IOCFOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/gpsinfo.html|title=USNO NAVSTAR Global Positioning System|publisher=U.S. Naval Observatory|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Full Operational Capability (FOC) was declared by [[Air Force Space Command]] (AFSPC) in April 1995, signifying full availability of the military's secure Precise Positioning Service (PPS).&lt;ref name="IOCFOC"/&gt;

==Early warning systems==
A number of nations have developed satellite based [[missile defense|early warning]] systems designed to detect ICBMs during different flight phases. In the United States these satellites are operated by the [[Defense Support Program]] (DSP). The first launch of a DSP satellite was on 6 November 1970 with the 23rd and last launched 10 November 2007. This program has been superseded by the Space-Based Infrared System ([[SBIRS]]).

==Satellite weapons==
In the United States, research into satellite based weapons was initiated by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in the 1950s. In 1958, the United States initiated Project Defender to develop an anti-[[ICBM]] solution launched from satellites. The satellites would have deployed a huge wire mesh to disable ICBMs during their early launch phase. The project floundered due to the lack of any mechanism to protect the satellites from attack resulting in the cancellation of Defender in 1968.&lt;ref name=NYtimes&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Wars Traced to Eisenhower Era|date=28 October 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/science/star-wars-traced-to-eisenhower-era.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|author=William J. Broad|accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since October 1967 satellite based weapons systems have been limited by international treaty to conventional weapons only. [[wikisource:Outer Space Treaty of 1967#Article IV|Art.IV]] of the [[Outer Space Treaty]] specifically prohibits signatories from installing [[weapons of mass destruction]] in Earth orbit. The treaty became effective on 10 October 1967 and, as of May 2013, 102 countries are parties to the treaty with a further 27 pending full ratification.&lt;ref name=UNtreatydatabase&gt;{{cite web  | url=http://disarmament.un.org/treaties/t/outer_space  | title = Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies  | accessdate = 2013-04-18 | publisher= [[United Nations Office for Disarmament Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=az&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.trend.az/regions/scaucasus/azerbaijan/2149769.html|title=Azerbaijan improves legal framework for space cooperation|date=13 May 2013|accessdate=2013-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military communication satellites==
Communications satellites are used for [military communications] applications. Typically military satellites operate in the [[UHF]], [[Super high frequency|SHF]] (also known as [[X-band]]) or [[Extremely high frequency|EHF]] (also known as [[Ka band|K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; band]]) frequency bands.

The US Armed Forces maintains international networks of satellites with ground stations located in various continents. 
[[Latency (engineering)#Satellite transmission|Signal latency]] is a major concern in satellite communications, so geographic and meteorological factors play an important role in choosing teleports. Since some of the major military activities of the U.S. army is in foreign territories, the U.S. government needs to subcontract satellite services to foreign carriers headquartered in areas with favorable climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsat.com/Case-Studies/proactive-communications.html/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120402124047/http://www.newsat.com/Case-Studies/proactive-communications.html/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |accessdate=September 16, 2011 |df= |title=Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military Strategic and Tactical Relay, or Milstar, is a constellation of military satellites managed by the [[United States Air Force]]. Six spacecraft were launched between 1994 and 2003, of which five are operational, with the sixth lost in a launch failure. They are deployed in [[geostationary orbit]] and provide wideband, narrowband and protected military communication systems. [[Wideband]] systems support high-bandwidth transfers. Protected systems offer more sophisticated security protection like antijam features and nuclear survivability, while [[narrowband]] systems are intended for basic communications services that do not require high bandwidth.

The [[United Kingdom]] also operates military communication satellites through its [[Skynet (satellite)|Skynet]] system. This is currently operated with support from [[Astrium Services]] and provides near worldwide coverage with both [[X band]] and [[Ultra high frequency]] services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skynet Coverage|url=http://www.satcom-airbusds.com/products-solutions/government-satcom/products-systems/bandwidth/skynet-5-x-band/#satellite-coverage-skynet-5-x-band|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516082649/http://www.satcom-airbusds.com/products-solutions/government-satcom/products-systems/bandwidth/skynet-5-x-band/#satellite-coverage-skynet-5-x-band|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-05-16|website=Satcom-airbusds.com|accessdate=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Skynet (satellite)|Skynet 5]] is the United Kingdom's most recent military communications satellite system. There are four Skynet satellites in orbit, with the latest launch completed in December 2012.&lt;ref name=Skynet&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-20781625|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2014-04-11|title=UK's Skynet military satellite launched|author=Jonathan Amos|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is provided by a private contractor, Astrium, with the UK government paying service charges based on bandwidth consumption.&lt;ref name=Skynet/&gt;

A '''nail file''' is a tool used to gently grind down and shape the edges of [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]]. They are often used in [[manicure]]s and [[pedicure]]s after the nail has been trimmed using appropriate [[nail clipper]]s.  Nail files may either be emery boards, ceramic, glass, crystal, plain metal files or metal [[File (tool)|file]]s coated with [[corundum]].

&lt;!-- Nail drill redirects here --&gt;
A '''nail drill''' is a powered rotary tool, which is used by a nail technician to file nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Remove Acrylic Nails Without Wrecking Your Real Nails |author=Marci Robin |date=December 19, 2017 |publisher=Good Housekeeping |url=https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/beauty/nails/a47362/how-to-remove-acrylic-nails/ |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;

==Materials==

===Emery board===
[[Image:Emeryboard.jpg|left|thumb|An emery board]]

Emery boards are small flat objects which have [[Emery (mineral)|emery]] or [[emery paper]] glued to them, making them both abrasive and flexible, used for [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernail and toenail]] care.  They are used by manicurists to shape and smooth the nail during manicure and pedicure sessions.  Emery boards are inexpensive and disposable, making them a sanitary alternative to metal nail files. The emery board was first patented by J. Parker Pray of New York in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;{{US patent|D15041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery boards are generally less abrasive than the metal nail files, and hence, emery boards may take longer to file down nails than metal nail files.  However, nail files may play a role in [[Transmission (medicine)|disease transmission]] if they are used on more than one person without adequate [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]]. Emery boards are usually less expensive than metal nail files, therefore emery boards can be economically disposed of after use on a single person.
The nail can be smoothed and shaped accurately by taking light, even strokes in one direction across the top of the nail. Twenty to thirty easy strokes can typically shorten excessively long fingernails, while five to ten strokes are sufficient for shaping the nails.

[[Guitar]] players have also been known to use emery boards to smooth out [[callus]]es which may snag the strings of their guitars.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edgenails.co.uk Using Nail Files&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emery pitches====
[[Baseball]] pitchers and [[cricket]] bowlers have been known to use emery boards to scuff the outside of the ball. The roughness can offer more grip and hand control. Surface scratches also alter the ball's [[aerodynamics]] making it more susceptible to spin and movement when in flight.  However, the deliberate manipulation of the ball using an emery board is classified as cheating in baseball and cricket.

In an infamous 1987 [[Major League Baseball]] incident, [[Joe Niekro]] of the [[Minnesota Twins]] was caught with an emery board in his pocket and suspended for ten games. He claimed it was for filing his nails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Terbush|first1=Jon|title=Spitballs, nail files, and other ways pitchers cheat|url=http://theweek.com/articles/464750/spitballs-nail-files-other-ways-pitchers-cheat|date=3 May 2013|publisher=theweek.com|accessdate=6 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Penner|first1=Mike|title=Embarrassing Night for Niekro and Angels : Twins' Pitcher Ejected When Emery Board Is Found; Minnesota Romps|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-08-04/sports/sp-1130_1_emery-board|accessdate=6 May 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=4 August 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Glass===
[[Glass nail file]]s are more recently available. Since glass nail files have a smoother and more even surface they do not splinter the nail like emery boards or metal nail files.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This makes them a preferred instrument by manicurists, although they are sometimes difficult to find in stores. Glass nail files come in very different qualities, some of them solid glass, others merely glass covered with an abrasive surface.

==History==
Although the modern nail file only appeared at the end of the 19th century, evidence of nail file-like tools exist even further back in history. [[Marie Antoinette]] was known for her obsession with the ''lime à ongles'', which was a nail file-like tool made of [[pumice]] stone. When her perfectly shaped nails were seen, it became the latest female trend in the French Court of Versailles. The pumice stone was carved into a pencil like shape, which was used to trim and shape the edges of the nail. This tool would not be disposed after use, but would be hand washed by the maids and placed by the bathtub to be used again.

A '''nav/attack system''' (short for [[navigation]]/attack system) is an integrated suite of [[sensor]]s and navigation equipment that allows a [[military aircraft]] to locate and attack specific ground targets or conduct aerial reconnaissance with a high degree of precision.

Since the late 1950s, nav/attack systems helped pilots increase the accuracy of releasing ordnance. A computer program would record the aircraft's velocity and use it to pinpoint their location in relationship with the target's location. Early integrated nav/attack systems suffered from poor reliability. Improvements in [[computing|digital computing]] technology, advent of the [[integrated circuit|microchip]], have resulted in substantially more sophisticated and effective equipment.

A typical modern nav/attack system is based around an [[inertial navigation]] system (INS) that allows the aircrew to locate the target area without relying on active sensors such as [[radar]] that might alert enemy combatants. INS can help calculate "drift", changes in course that deviate from the target, the nav/attack system can guide the aircraft to the target or be used as a tool to help guide the pilot to the target.

Modern systems typically provide an automatic weapons release; the aircraft can be programmed to release the ordnance before it misses the target. 
The aircraft's computer system will release the ordnance unless the pilot chooses to override that command and release it instead. 
The navigation program accounts for factors such as wind and velocity.
Early nav/attack systems were primitive but paved the way for the systems we have today. Today's systems give pilots deadlier accuracy because of technological advances that have developed since the first model.

==Overview==
NPWT promotes wound healing by applying a vacuum through a special sealed dressing. The continued vacuum draws out [[edema|fluid]] from the wound and increases blood flow to the area.&lt;ref name=Moody/&gt; The vacuum may be applied continuously or intermittently, depending on the type of wound being treated and the clinical objectives. Typically, the dressing is changed two to three times per week.&lt;ref name=Fogg/&gt; The dressings used for the technique include open-cell foam dressings and gauze, sealed with an [[occlusive dressing]] intended to contain the vacuum at the wound site.&lt;ref name=Lillis /&gt; Where NPWT devices allow delivery of fluids, such as saline or [[antibiotics]] to irrigate the wound,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Silver-impregnated vacuum-assisted closure in the treatment of recalcitrant venous stasis ulcers |vauthors=Gerry R, Kwei S, Bayer L, Breuing KH |journal=Ann Plast Surg. |date=July 2007 |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=58–62 |pmid=17589262 |doi=10.1097/01.sap.0000263420.70303.cc}}{{Unreliable medical source|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wendling&gt;{{cite news | title=Vacuum-assisted wound therapy uses expanded | first=Patrice | last=Wendling | url=http://skin.gcnpublishing.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/archive_pdf/vol39iss4/70254_main.pdf | publisher=Skin &amp; Allergy News | date=April 2008 | accessdate=11 January 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827094427/http://skin.gcnpublishing.com/fileadmin/content_pdf/archive_pdf/vol39iss4/70254_main.pdf | archive-date=27 August 2011 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; intermittent removal of used fluid supports the cleaning and drainage of the wound bed.&lt;ref name="pmid9931834"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Moch D, Fleischmann W, Westhauser A |title=Instillationsvakuumversiegelung: ein erster Erfahrungsbericht |trans-title=Instillation vacuum sealing—report of initial experiences |language=German |journal=Langenbecks Archiv für Chirurgie |volume=115 |issue= |pages=1197–9 |year=1998 |pmid=9931834 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-45774-6_279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three types of filler material are used over the wound surface: open-cell [[foam]], [[gauze]] and transparent film, or honeycombed textiles with a dimpled wound contact surface.  
* Foam dressings are used to fill open cavity wounds and can be cut to size to fit wounds. The foam dressing is applied, filling the wound and then a film drape is applied over the top to create a seal around the dressing. 
* Open weave cotton gauze can be covered with a transparent film, and a flat drain is sandwiched in gauze and placed onto the wound.

# Malignancy in the wound
# Untreated [[osteomyelitis]]
# Non enteric and unexplored [[fistula]]s
# Necrotic tissue with [[eschar]] present
# Exposed blood vessels, anastomotic sites, organs and nerves in the periwound area (must avoid direct foam contact with these structures)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.activactherapy.com/cs/Satellite?c=KCI_General_C&amp;childpagename=KCI1/KCILayout&amp;cid=1229624973260&amp;pagename=KCI1Wrapper|title=V.A.C.

== Effectiveness ==
A 2007 [[Cochrane Library|Cochrane Review]] stated that the evidence comparing NPWT to alternative care was flawed and required more study, but the evidence did support improved healing and called for more, better quality research to be conducted.&lt;ref name="ubbink2008" /&gt; A 2010 [[systematic review]] found "consistent evidence of the benefit of NPWT" in the treatment of [[diabetic ulcer]]s of the feet.  Results for [[bedsore]]s were "conflicting" and research on  "mixed wounds" was of poor quality, but promising.  The review did not find evidence of increased [[Complication (medicine)|significant complications]].  The review concluded "There is now sufficient evidence to show that NPWT is safe, and will accelerate healing, to justify its use in the treatment of diabetes-associated chronic leg wounds. There is also evidence, though of poor quality, to suggest that healing of other wounds may also be accelerated."&lt;ref name=Xie /&gt;

Pellet mills are unlike [[mill (grinding)|grinding mills]], in that they combine small materials into a larger, homogeneous mass, rather than break large materials into smaller pieces.

==Types==
There are many types of pellet mills that can be generally grouped into ''large-scale'' and ''small-scale'' types. According to the production capacity, pellet mills also can be divided into flat die pellet mill and ring die pellet mill. 

===Large-scale===
[[File:Pellet mills.JPG|thumb|Pellet mills]]

There are two common types of large-scale pellet mills: ''flat die'' mills and ''ring die'' mills. Flat die mills use a flat die with slots. The powder is introduced to the top of the die and as the die rotates a roller presses the powder through the holes in the die. A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the die.&lt;ref name="pietsch"/&gt; In the ring die there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Matz | first = Samuel A. | title = The chemistry and technology of cereals as food and feed | page = 328 | publisher = Springer | year = 1991 | edition = 2nd | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WKY0h5YrQVwC&amp;pg=PA328 | isbn = 978-0-442-30830-8 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large scale pellet mills are usually used to produce [[Fodder|animal feed]],&lt;ref name="pietsch"/&gt; [[wood pellets]], and [[fuel]] pellets for use in a [[pellet stove]].

===Small-scale===
[[File:Screw pellet mill.jpg|thumb|A screw-type pellet mill]]

Small-scale mills are usually variations of [[screw press]]es or [[hydraulic press]]es. The same basic process is used for both types. A die, also known as a mold, holds the uncompressed powder in a shaped pocket. The pocket shape defined the final pellet shape. A [[platen]] is attached to the end of the screw (in a screw press) or the ram (in a hydraulic press) which compresses the powder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station | title = Tenth Annual Report of the Storrs Agricultural Experiment Station, Storrs, Conn. 1897 | pages = 208–209 | publisher = Pelton &amp; King | year = 1898 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=A0MgAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA208 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some platens are heated to speed up the time it takes and improve the overall structure of the pellet. They may also have water ports for quick cooling between uses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

== Applications ==
One of the more common applications is to produce [[KBr]] pellets which are used in [[infrared spectroscopy]] applications.

Animal feed pellets are usually a mixture of dry powdered feedstock, such as [[flour]], [[sawdust]], or [[grass]], and a wet ingredient, such as [[molasses]] or [[steam]]. Feedstocks for pellet mills can sometimes break down and then re-form, or [[polymerization|polymerize]], under the extreme heat and pressure of the pellet mill.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

[[File:pin-artsy.jpg|right|thumb|A collection of push-pins in a [[Cork (material)|cork board]]]]
[[File:Bobby pin.jpg|right|thumb|A bobby pin]]
A '''pin''' is a device used for fastening objects or material together, and can have three sorts of body:  a shaft of a rigid inflexible material meant to be inserted in a slot, groove, or hole (as with pivots, [[hinge|hinges]], and jigs); a shaft connected to a head and ending in a sharp tip meant to pierce one or more pieces of soft materials like cloth or paper (the straight or push pin); a single strip of a rigid but flexible material (e.g. a [[wire]]) whose length has been folded into parallel prongs in such fashion that the middle length of each curves towards the other so that, when anything is inserted between them, they act as a clamp (e.g. the bobby pin), or two strips of a rigid material bound together by a spring at one end so that, when the spring held open, one can insert some material between the prongs at the other end that, the spring allowed to close, then clamp the inserted material.  According to their function, pins can be made of metals (e.g. [[steel]], [[copper]], or [[brass]]), wood, or [[plastic]].  

==Sewing and fashion pins==
The development of the pin closely paralleled that of its perforated counterpart, the [[Sewing needle|needle]].  Archaeological evidence suggests that curved sewing pins have been used for over four thousand years. Originally, these were fashioned out of iron and bone by the [[Sumer]]ians and were used to hold clothes together. Later, pins were also used to hold pages of books together by threading the [[Sewing needle|needle]] through their top corner.&lt;ref&gt;Petroski, Henry, "From Pins to Paper Clips", The Evolution of Useful Things, Knopf, New York, 1993, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Many later pins were made of brass, a relatively hard and [[ductile]] metal that became available during the [[Bronze Age]]. This development was followed by the use of steel which was much stronger but tended to [[rust]] when exposed to humid air. The development of inexpensive [[electroplating]] techniques allowed the steel to be plated with [[nickel]]. Nickel did not rust, but tended to flake off the steel in humid weather, again allowing it to rust. However, this took many months or even years to happen, and as nickel plated steel pins were usually used only temporarily to hold fabric in place prior to sewing, no further refinement has been considered necessary.  Note, however, that some modern specialty pins are made out of rust-proof and very strong [[titanium]].&lt;ref&gt;Bridgman, Roger. 1000 Inventions &amp; Discoveries. New York: Dorling Kindersley Publishing [http://www.put-a-pin.pt.vu ], 2002, p.126&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adam Smith]] described the manufacture of pins using extensive [[Division of labour|division of labor]] in his Wealth of Nations. [[John Ireland Howe]] invented a pin-making machine in 1832, and an improved machine in 1841; his Howe Manufacturing Company of Derby, Connecticut, used three machines to produce 72,000 pins per day in 1839.

[[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]] invented the [[safety pin]] by forming an eight-inch brass pin into a bent pin with a spring and guard.  He sold the rights to his invention to pay a debt to a friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Alfred | first=R | title=April 10, 1849: Safety Tech Gets to the Point, Baby | publisher=Wired | date=2008-10-04 | url=https://www.wired.com/2012/04/april-10-1849-safety-tech-gets-to-the-point-baby/ | accessdate=2008-10-23 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140430012029/http://www.wired.com/2012/04/april-10-1849-safety-tech-gets-to-the-point-baby/ | archivedate=April 30, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; not knowing that he could have made millions of dollars.

==General purpose pins==
The [[push pin]] was invented in 1900 by [[Edwin Moore (inventor)|Edwin Moore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent |country=US |number=654319 |status=patent |title=Push-pin |pubdate=Jul 24, 1900 |gdate= |fdate=Jul 24, 1900 |pridate=Jul 24, 1900 |inventor=Edwin Moore |class=F16B15/00}}&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly became a success. These pins are also called "[[thumbtack]]s". There is also a new push pin called a "[[paper cricket]]".

==Steel pins without heads==
Thin, hardened pins can be driven into wood with a hammer with the goal of not being seen.

== Mechanical fasteners ==
In engineering and machine design, a pin is a machine element that secures the position of two or more parts of a machine relative to each other. A large variety of types has been known for a long time; the most commonly used are solid cylindrical pins, solid tapered pins, groove pins, slotted spring pins and spirally [[coiled spring pins]].

===2010 House election===
Saujani challenged incumbent Democratic Representative [[Carolyn Maloney]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in New York, 2010|2010 House elections]]. Saujani's previous work for and link to [[Wall Street]] firms was seen as a liability to her credibility and acceptance by Democratic primary voters.&lt;ref&gt;Halbfinger, David.

A poll commissioned in the spring of 2010 by the Maloney campaign showed Saujani trailing Maloney by more than 68 points. The same poll found Maloney to hold a favorable rating of 86%.&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Michael Howard. [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704912004575252651898777186 "Rep.

Saujani's campaign was the first political campaign to use technology tools such as [[Square, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/03/18/square-now-being-used-for-mobile-payments-at-political-fundraisers/ |title=Square Now Being Used For Mobile Payments At Political Fundraisers |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2011-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 Public Advocate election===
Saujani ran for the role of [[New York Public Advocate]] in 2013, coming third in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hernández|first1=Javier C.|title=Democratic Runoff Is Likely in Contest for Public Advocate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/nyregion/democratic-runoff-is-likely-in-contest-for-public-advocate.html?_r=0|work=The New York Times|date=September 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her [[campaign manager]] in 2013 was [[Michael Blake (politician)|Michael Blake]], who later served as a [[New York State Assembly]]man, and then ran for the Public Advocate seat himself in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/city-hall/2015/12/8585392/hilltop-hires-sitting-democratic-assemblyman-michael-blake |title=Hilltop hires sitting Democratic assemblyman Michael Blake |work=Politico |date=December 11, 2015 |accessdate=January 23, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/8013-in-run-for-public-advocate-blake-offers-federal-and-state-experience|title=In Run for New York City Public Advocate, Blake Offers Federal and State Experience|first=Ben|last=Max|date=|publisher=|accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, Saujani's [[Wikipedia]] page was heavily edited to remove traces of Saujani working for Wall Street firms such as hedge funds. Her campaign admitted to this,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2013/04/11/wall_street_dem_covers_up_her_past_and_runs_again/ Wall Street Dem covers up her past and runs again] Salon, April 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; arguing they did it because they disagreed with the stated facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20130206/BLOGS04/302069997 Saujani's campaign wipes hedge fund history from her Wiki page] Crain's New York Business, February 11, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The three battens are shown in the primary colours red, blue and yellow, where the yellow batten is oriented orthogonal to the screen. The locations of the dowels are shown in gray; the dowel connecting the yellow batten to the blue batten is the third and final one.]]

A '''Rietveld joint''', also called a [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] node in furniture-making, is an overlapping joint of three [[batten]]s in the three orthogonal directions. It was a prominent feature in the [[Red and Blue Chair]] that was designed by [[Gerrit Rietveld]].

Rietveld joints are inextricably linked with the early 20th century Dutch artistic movement called [[De Stijl]] (of which Gerrit Rietveld was a member), a movement whose aims included ultimate simplicity and abstraction. This led to the movement's three-dimensional works having vertical and horizontal lines that are positioned in layers or planes that do not intersect, thereby allowing each element to exist independently and unobstructed by other elements and giving a piece a visually raw and simplified look.

In Gerrit Rietveld's furniture, many of these joints were doweled, meaning that the adjoining faces were connected with glued wooden pins. The first two connections were made by boring a hole about 1&amp;nbsp;mm deeper than the dowel length, but the third connection was made with
a longer dowel, boring through a batten, leaving a circular mark that had to be painted over.&lt;ref&gt;Drijver et Niemeijer: ''How to construct Rietveld furniture'', p 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">'''Sodablasting''' is a mild form of [[abrasive blasting]] in which [[sodium bicarbonate]] particles are blasted against a surface using [[compressed air]]. It has a much milder abrasive effect than sandblasting. An early use was in the [[conservation-restoration of the Statue of Liberty]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Brian Waple |title=Sodium Bicarbonate: The User-Friendly Blasting Abrasive |url=https://www.randrmagonline.com/articles/87459-sodium-bicarbonate-the-user-friendly-blasting-abrasive |magazine=Restoration &amp; Remediation |date=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodablasting is a non-destructive method for many applications in cleaning, paint and varnish stripping, [[automotive restoration]], industrial equipment maintenance, [[rust]] removal, [[graffiti]] removal, molecular steel [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] against [[rust]], oil removal by [[saponification]] and translocation, masonry cleaning and restoration, soot remediation, boat hull cleaning and for food processing facilities and equipment and tooth cleaning at the dental laboratory.

==Applications==
Sodablasting can be used for cleaning timber, wood, oak beams, oak floors, doors, stairs &amp; bannisters,  cars, boat hulls, masonry, and food processing equipment. Sodablasting can also be used to remove [[graffiti]]&lt;!-- no longer available &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =  New Graffiti Cleaner Is Greener | url = http://www.ksat.com/video/16605354/index.html?taf=ibs | accessdate = 2009-09-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; and to clean [[structural steel]].  Sodablasting is very effective for mold and fire/smoke damage cleanup as it cleans and deodorizes.

==Equipment==
A '''sodablaster''' is a self-contained system that includes a blast generator, high pressure compressed air, moisture decontamination system, blast hose, and a blast nozzle. The blasting material consists of formulated [[sodium bicarbonate]] (also known as baking soda). Blasting soda is an extremely [[friable]] material that undergoes micro fragmentation on impact, literally exploding away surface materials without damage to the substrate. Since sodium bicarbonate is much softer than the [[silicon carbide]] or [[aluminium oxide]] used in sandblasting, the blast nozzle used for sodablasting applications can be made of soft metals such as brass or steel.  The pressures used are very low compared to those used in sandblasting, e.g. 20psi as opposed to 120psi.

The '''sonic screwdriver''' is a multifunctional [[fictional]] tool&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tellmenothing.com/2017/03/28/sonic-screwdriver-uses-device-doctor/|title=Sonic Screwdriver: 50 Uses Of This Device From Doctor Who|last=Malankar|first=Nikhil|date=2017-03-28|website=Tell Me Nothing|access-date=2017-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[British television science fiction|British]] [[science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and its spin-offs, used by [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]]. Like the [[TARDIS]], it has become one of the icons of the programme, and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off media]] such as ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' have replicated its functions in devices such as the sonic lipstick, sonic blaster, sonic probe, and sonic modulator.

The sonic screwdriver was first introduced in 1968 in the story ''Fury from the Deep'', and used twice more (''The Dominators'' and ''The War Games'') during the [[Second Doctor]]'s tenure. It became a popular tool for the [[Third Doctor]] and [[Fourth Doctor]]. It was finally written out of the series in 1982 due to the limitations it caused when writing for the show. It then featured briefly in the 1996 [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|''Doctor Who'' television movie]], before making a full return in the 2005 continuation of the series.

Throughout the programme, there have been many different versions of the sonic screwdriver, as with subsequent Doctors the design of it was changed. It has also been destroyed on a number of occasions, thus leading to the introduction of the next model. Not all iterations of the Doctor have used the sonic screwdriver on screen; the [[Fifth Doctor]] in fact opted not to replace his after it was destroyed.

The [[Twelfth Doctor]] loses his sonic screwdriver to the creator of the [[Dalek]]s, [[Davros]], after lending it to him when he was a child. In the last episode of Series 9, the Doctor received a new sonic screwdriver from the [[TARDIS]] in place of the temporary sonic glasses.

Despite the Doctor's claim not to give his screwdriver to anyone, he gives one to his own doppelgänger in "[[The Rebel Flesh]]", and gives his to [[Rory Williams]] in "[[The Girl Who Waited]]" after having either given or loaned one to him for use in "[[A Good Man Goes to War]]" and loaning him one in "[[The Big Bang (Doctor Who)|The Big Bang]]". He also gives one to [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] in "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" which is then used by the [[Tenth Doctor]] to save her life in "[[Forest of the Dead]]".

== Functions ==
{{or-section|date=January 2018}}
The functions of a sonic screwdriver are based on its power over sound waves, radiation, wavelengths, frequencies, signals, and electro-magnetism. It is shown to hack, disable, activate, and otherwise control technology from almost everything, allowing it to remotely control almost any machinery, mechanisms and computers it is applied to, allowing it to open locks, detonate explosives, remotely activate electronics, override most systems, activate computers, and cause some energy weapons to burst into flames or sparks. There is technology the sonic is unable to interface with, such as the isomorphic controls seen in "A Christmas Carol". It also is capable of causing chemical reactions that allowed the Doctor to turn eye glass lenses black like sunglasses and causing cut barbed wire to regenerate (setting 2428B). It is also capable of detecting, amplifying and controlling certain energies, sound, signals, frequencies, and waves, allowing the Doctor to intercept a teleporting individual and send them where he chooses, scan and identify matter, send out communications, enhance sounds, signals and frequencies, and acting as a catalyst or conduit for energies. Sonics are also capable of calculations, such as ''[[The Day of the Doctor]]'' (2013), when the [[War Doctor]] used calculations to allow the sonic to work on wood, the calculations of which appeared partly done on the Tenth Doctor's sonic and completed in the Eleventh's. The War Doctor also used his sonic in tandem with the Tenth and Eleventh's to create a force field wave to repel a Dalek.

These are more specific functions of the sonic screwdriver:
* Unlocking or locking a door
* Burning or cutting any kind of substance
* Remotely detonate certain machines or explosives
* Amplify sound-waves and the power of an X-ray machine beyond its normal capacity
* Disarm weapons and electronics 
* [[Flashlight]]
* Intercept and conduct teleportation
* Hack an [[Automated_teller_machine|ATM]]
* Regenerating razor wire on a fence
* Darken eyeglass lenses to transform them into sunglasses
* [[Microphone]] (when connected to an audio amplifier)
* Detect and interpret signals
* Conducting medical scans
* Locking the coordinates of the TARDIS
* Tracking alien life
* Using red setting or dampers
* Control the properties of atoms and molecules on a small scale
* Operate computers, whether their origin is alien or human
* Provide Geo-location
* Light [[candles]]
* Creating a force field wave with two other sonic to physically repel a Dalek
* Modification of a mobile phone
* Disclosure and deactivating camouflage
* Disarm Robotics
* Scan and classify matter
* Shatter glass
* Create an "acoustic corridor" for speaking with someone far away
* Shocking neural centers of a living creature
* Tighten and loosen screws
* Download a person's consciousness and transfer it into a computer hard drive (only a special model created by The Doctor as a gift to [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]].)

Aside from being a tool, the sonic screwdriver can be used and considered as a defensive weapon, which is effective for a few types of assault weapons, but not designed to kill or injure living things as the only way it can really hurt or incapacitate a creature is by emitting painful bursts of sound, or, as of "[[Day of the Moon]]" (2011) by blasting a green wave of energy to incapacitate a target, though only the Eleventh and Twelfth's sonic has been shown to do the latter.

== History ==
=== 1968–1982 and 1996 ===
[[File:1st sonic screwdriver.jpg|thumb|right|The first sonic screwdriver from Season 6, Episode 3 of ''[[The War Games]]'' (1969)]]
The sonic screwdriver made its first appearance in the serial ''[[Fury from the Deep]]'' (1968), written by [[Victor Pemberton]]. It was used thereafter by the [[Second Doctor]] as a multi-purpose tool, with occasional variations in appearance over the course of the series.

Its abilities and overall appearance varied greatly during the classic series. The name implies that it operates through the use of sound waves to exert physical forces on objects remotely. During the Second Doctor's tenure, it functioned much as its name implied—using sonic waves to dismantle equipment or to bypass locks. In addition, it was used as a welding torch in Episode Five of ''[[The Dominators]]'' (1968). In the audio commentary for ''[[The Sea Devils]]'' (1972), [[Michael E. Briant|Michael Briant]] claims to have suggested it as a one-off gadget in 1968.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on DVD of ''The Sea Devils''&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Third Doctor]]'s tenure, producer [[Barry Letts]] was adamant that the device not become a cure-all for the series, and limited its use to avoid writers becoming over-reliant on it. During this time, the device underwent significant design changes. In ''The Sea Devils'', the Doctor used it to detonate landmines; Michael E. Briant explains that this was feasible, stating that the sonic waves shook the mines. In ''[[The Three Doctors (Doctor Who)|The Three Doctors]]'' (1972–73), the sonic screwdriver is almost unrecognisable, being a unique, one-use prop with a plastic red spherical head. In the DVD commentary, Letts himself remarks on the thickness of the prop and the fact that it belies the idea that it was the regular one, prompting [[Katy Manning]] to question whether it was indeed a sonic screwdriver.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on DVD of ''The Three Doctors''&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the serial being produced out of transmission order: the original sonic screwdriver prop went missing during the recording of ''[[Carnival of Monsters]]'' (1973), requiring a new prop to be built for the rest of the season;&lt;ref&gt;http://doctorwho.org.nz/archive/tsv31/sonicscrewdriver.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Three Doctors'' was recorded after ''Carnival'', but set before it, so the screwdriver could be seen to revert to its previous appearance for one story after ''The Three Doctors'' before receiving a more permanent redesign thereafter.

During the first three years of the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s tenure, producer [[Philip Hinchcliffe]] further reduced the use of the sonic screwdriver. Exceptions include ''[[Robot (Doctor Who)|Robot]]'' (which was the last story to be produced by Barry Letts), where it was again used to detonate mines, and as a "miniature sonic lance"&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Sixth Doctor uses a hand tool he calls a "sonic lance" in ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]''&lt;/ref&gt; to cut out a lock. Aside from unlocking doors, the device was greatly downplayed during the Fourth Doctor's second and third seasons. It saw a resurgence once [[Graham Williams (television producer)|Graham Williams]] took over as producer in 1977. In the final story of season 15, ''[[The Invasion of Time]]'', the Fourth Doctor conceded, "Not even the sonic screwdriver can get me out of this one."

It featured regularly in season 16 during the Key to Time saga. The Doctor's [[Time Lord|Time Lady]] companion [[Romana (Doctor Who)|Romana]] constructed a sonic screwdriver of her own similar to the Doctor's. It is depicted as being smaller and sleeker than the Doctor's, and he was sufficiently impressed with her design that he attempted to swap screwdrivers with her in ''[[The Horns of Nimon]]'' (1979–80). By season 18, both script editor [[Christopher H Bidmead]] and producer [[John Nathan-Turner]] were eager to downplay the device as much as possible.

The sonic screwdriver was written out of the series late in season 19, in the [[Fifth Doctor]] serial ''[[The Visitation (Doctor Who)|The Visitation]]'' (1982). It is destroyed by a [[List of Doctor Who monsters and aliens#Terileptil|Terileptil]] to prevent the Doctor from escaping a holding cell; in response, the Doctor sorrowfully remarked, "I feel as if you've just killed an old friend." [[Eric Saward]] later explained in a 2005 DVD interview&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on DVD of ''The Visitation''&lt;/ref&gt; that this was done on the instructions of producer John Nathan-Turner. Saward had written out the sonic screwdriver, believing that the Doctor had "a cupboard full of them" in the [[TARDIS]]. On the basis that [[Deus ex machina|a device that could help in any situation]] was very limiting for the script, Nathan-Turner decided that it would not return.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on DVD of ''Castrovalva''&lt;/ref&gt; The Tenth Doctor joked about the Fifth Doctor's lack of sonic screwdriver in the mini-episode "[[Time Crash]]" (2007), commenting that he "went hands-free" and could "save the universe using a kettle and some string." The device did not appear again for the remainder of the original series.

In the  [[Doctor Who (1996 film)|''Doctor Who'' TV Movie]] (1996) and "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" (2013), the Seventh (TVM), Eighth (both), &amp; the [[War Doctor]] ("The Night of the Doctor") were seen to have a new sonic screwdriver with a telescopic mechanism: similar to its predecessors but with subtle differences such as a gold/brass band on the handle, a flat base and a red emitter tip.

=== 2005–2010 ===
{{overly detailed|section|date=November 2013}}
A redesigned sonic screwdriver appears in the new series, with a blue light in addition to the sound effect. In its first incarnation, the prop used in the new series was fragile and prone to breakage. Over the course of the next two years, the props were continually repaired and modified, with some additions being a new thumb slider design and different colours of wires used in the clear channel when extended.

For [[Doctor Who (series 4)|series 4]] (2008), a new design of Screwdriver was commissioned by the BBC. [[Nick Robatto]] was hired to make two new props. These featured the final slider design, and redesigned body ridges, among other smaller changes. This design debuted in 2008's "[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]" and continued to be used until the Screwdriver's ultimate destruction in 2010's "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]". This later design has gained the nickname "Series 3–4 Sonic" (relating to the fact that at the start of Series 3, in "Smith and Jones", the first Sonic Screwdriver was supposedly destroyed), even though strictly speaking it first appeared in Series 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Toys and Games | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/07/26/20763.shtml | publisher=BBC | date=26 July 2005 | accessdate=29 October 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061216031526/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2005/07/26/20763.shtml | archivedate=16 December 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with Nathan-Turner's attitude that the sonic screwdriver should not be used as a cure-all, the new production team gave it even more functionality than previous versions which has given the series some criticism as it seems to be a [[deus ex machina]], a literary device that is generally avoided.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Some of the uses in the new series include: repairing electronic equipment; re-attaching materials such as barbed wire; detecting, intercepting and sending signals; remotely operating the TARDIS; burning, cutting, or igniting substances; fusing metal; scanning and identifying substances; amplifying or augmenting sound; modifying mobile phones to enable "universal roaming"; disabling alien disguises; resonating concrete; reversing teleportation of another entity. It is sometimes used to disassemble robotic enemies or turn other objects into weapons; healing cuts and wounds. In "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005) and "[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]" (2007), it is used to operate the TARDIS controls remotely; when the Doctor attempts to counteract the Master's theft of the TARDIS, it is used to limit the TARDIS' destination. In "[[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|Doomsday]]" (2006), the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver does not kill, wound or maim; however, it is sometimes brandished in a threatening manner, such as in "[[The Christmas Invasion]]" (2005), "[[The Impossible Planet]]" (2006), "[[The Runaway Bride (Doctor Who)|The Runaway Bride]]" (2006), "[[The Lazarus Experiment]]" (2007), "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" (2013) and ''[[The Infinite Quest]]'' (2007). In "[[World War Three (Doctor Who)|World War Three]]" (2005), when confronted by a group of [[Slitheen]], the Doctor threatens to "triplicate the flammability" of a bottle of [[port wine]] with the sonic screwdriver, though one of the Slitheen realises he is bluffing. In "[[Closing Time (Doctor Who)|Closing Time]]" (2011), ringed energy beams are seen emitted from the device, giving it a more weapon-like appearance, particularly when used to disable a weakened [[Cyberman]] at a distance.

In "Smith and Jones", the sonic screwdriver burns out after the Doctor uses it to amplify the radiation output of a hospital [[x-ray generator|X-ray machine]]. In the "Series Three concept Artwork Gallery",[https://web.archive.org/web/20080227031917/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/index.shtml] [https://web.archive.org/web/20080227182534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/2.shtml] when referring to the burnt out sonic screwdriver, Peter McKinstry says "the green crystal structure visible under the shattered dome refers back to the TARDIS console crystal. It's the same technology – the TARDIS's little brother."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/2.shtml BBC – Doctor Who – Series Three concept Artwork Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227182534/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/2.shtml |date=27 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though initially saddened at the loss of the screwdriver, the Doctor obtains a new one at the conclusion of the episode.

The sonic screwdriver is unable to open a "deadlock seal", used as a [[plot device]] to prevent an easy solution. Russell T Davies once mentioned that he would never make the sonic screwdriver the solution to an episode. In "[[Silence in the Library]]" (2008), while trying to open a wooden door, the Doctor tells Donna that the sonic screwdriver won't work because the door is made of wood, a fact later restated in "[[The Hungry Earth]]" (2010); when Rory complains about this, the Doctor counters to not "diss the sonic." The sonic screwdriver's inability to work on wood is clarified in "[[In the Forest of the Night]]" (2014), when the Doctor states that the sonic screwdriver works by manipulating the moving parts in various machinery: since plant tissue lacks said moving parts, it is unaffected by the sonic screwdriver (though this claim is slightly inconsistent with its visible ability to repair human tissue). In "[[The Parting of the Ways]]" (2005), the Doctor mentions that when Emergency Program One was activated, the sonic screwdriver would receive a signal from the TARDIS. In "[[Forest of the Dead]]" (2008), he claims that a few hair-dryers can interfere with the device, though he states that he is "working on that".

=== 2010–2015 ===
In "[[The Eleventh Hour (Doctor Who)|The Eleventh Hour]]" (2010), the malfunctioning sonic screwdriver is destroyed when the Doctor tries to signal the Atraxi ships. The Doctor later receives a new one, which emerges from the newly regenerated TARDIS console. The [[Eleventh Doctor]]'s sonic screwdriver is larger than its predecessor; it has a green light and metal claws that extend with a flick of the wrist. It is shown to have been created by the TARDIS as part of its automatic regeneration.

In "[[A Christmas Carol (Doctor Who)|A Christmas Carol]]" (2010), the Doctor advises a young Kazran Sardick to pursue romance while implying that in a similar situation in his own past he had instead gone to his room to "design a new kind of screwdriver."
Also in that episode, the sonic screwdriver gets split into two pieces, one of which ends up inside a flying shark. The remaining piece is said to be signalling its other half in an effort to repair itself. The Doctor uses this to send a signal through the half inside the sky shark to open up the clouds. Afterwards, the half not in the shark is left with Kazran Sardick. The Doctor tells Kazran that he can call him for help using the Sonic; though Kazran declines to do so. The Doctor had duplicates of this screwdriver, which he continued to use throughout his travels.

In "[[Let's Kill Hitler]]" (2011), it is explained that instead of having settings, this version operates through a psychic interface, basically doing whatever the user thinks of while pointing and holding down the button. This version of the screwdriver also appears, although never officially announced, to have a flashlight setting, as the Doctor is seen to have it emitting a continuous glow while not uttering the classic sonic noise. Also in the episode, the Doctor uses another modified version of his sonic, which he calls a "Sonic Cane". It is similar to a Tuxedo cane, except the top replaced with the upper portion of his screwdriver, with a metal ball cut in fourths attached to the claws.

Ahead of the 50th anniversary special, a mini-episode entitled "[[The Night of the Doctor]]" (2013) was produced in which the Eighth Doctor uses the sonic screwdriver twice. The Doctor uses his telescopic screwdriver previously seen in the [[Doctor Who (film)|TV Movie]], rather than his updated steampunk version which had been used in numerous [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] audio dramas.

For the 50th anniversary special, "[[The Day of the Doctor]]" (2013), another version was seen in the hands of John Hurt's [[War Doctor]]. The design was similar to the one used by Tom Baker's Fourth Doctor. This time the halo and bullet tip had been removed, replaced by a red light as well as a large red dial added to the base. Character Options released a version of this sonic screwdriver on 23 November 2013 at London's ExCel labelling it "The Other Doctor's Sonic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://merchandise.thedoctorwhosite.co.uk/doctor-who-london-excel-convention-pictures/|title=Doctor Who London Excel Convention Pictures|work=The Doctor Who Site}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established as a plot point in that episode that the sonic screwdrivers employed by various Doctor incarnations all use the same software, something the War Doctor exploited by running a calculation over a course of several centuries with the Tenth and Eleventh Doctors seeing the calculation completed through their models. It is also directly implied after the fact that the sonic screwdriver has actually been a part of every doctor's retinue, despite its disappearance for doctors six &amp; seven; the Tenth Doctor says to the Gallifreyan high command, as all thirteen doctors are about to change history by saving the planet, that the calculations for doing what's about to be done have been "running all my lives." In addition, when combined, the screwdrivers of the War, Tenth, and Eleventh Doctor could create a sonic force field blast to repel and destroy a Dalek.

"[[The Magician's Apprentice]]" (2015) shows that the sonic screwdriver can create "an acoustic corridor" so that the [[Twelfth Doctor]] can communicate with a boy trapped in an extraterrestrial mine field.  However, when the Doctor discovers that the boy is actually a young [[Davros]], he abandons the boy, leaving the screwdriver behind, though it is revealed that he did save young Davros after all. Davros is shown to have kept the screwdriver in his possession ever since, and the Doctor tells [[Clara Oswald|Clara]] that he no longer has a screwdriver. By that time, the screwdriver had been withered and damaged by time and was seemingly useless.

==== Sonic sunglasses ====
In his first appearance at the beginning of [[Doctor Who (series 9)|series nine]] of ''Doctor Who'', the Doctor is seen wearing black [[Ray-Ban]] [[sunglasses]] ("[[The Magician's Apprentice (Doctor Who)|The Magician's Apprentice]]"), and he says that he no longer has his sonic screwdriver. Later, in "[[The Witch's Familiar]]", he unveils that the sunglasses are actually a wearable version of the screwdriver, claiming that he is "over" screwdrivers: "They spoil the line of your jacket." The glasses are used by the Doctor, and Clara on occasion, throughout the ninth series.

The sonic sunglasses appears to have the same basic functions as the traditional sonic screwdriver, such as scanning objects, while having features not seen before:

* Allowing the Doctor to hear people talking, even if they are several yards away and surrounded by loud noises ("The Magician's Apprentice").
* Reassembling the TARDIS after it has used its Hostile Action Dispersal System to avoid destruction by the [[Dalek]]s ("The Witch's Familiar").
* Creating and controlling a sophisticated hologram of the Doctor through a [[WiFi]] system ("[[Before the Flood (Doctor Who)|Before the Flood]]").
* Erasing alien encoding inside people's brains by having them don the glasses for a few minutes ("Before the Flood").
* Reading [[Internet]] pages and [[e-mail]] ("[[The Zygon Inversion]]" and "[[Extremis (Doctor Who)|Extremis]]").
* Communicating with [[Gallifrey]]an battle cruisers ("[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]").

The glasses appear to be more susceptible to damage than the screwdriver; in "[[The Girl Who Died]]", a [[Vikings|Viking]] warrior takes the glasses off the Doctor's face and easily breaks them in half. Nevertheless, the glasses continue to appear via replacement or repair until the end of the season. They return the following season during the Doctor's temporary period of blindness, showing the ability to scan his surroundings and transmit the information to his brain, as well as transmit any data recorded to them. However, while he is able to tell things about a person such as height, weight, gender, age, and even heart rate, he doesn't get enough detail to know faces, clothing, etc. ("Extremis") He was once able to tell that a person was holding a computer tablet, but not what was written on it, as well as 'see' a combination lock but not the numbers. ("[[The Pyramid at the End of the World]]")

=== 2015–2017 ===
In "[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]", the TARDIS gives the Doctor a brand new sonic screwdriver. The new screwdriver has a TARDIS-blue shaft with gold and silver highlights. The upper half is a rectangular light grid that, when switched on, has four different functions: green light with low-pitched sound, blue light with high-pitched sound, green lights that pulse with a pulsing sound, and a blue light chasing pattern with a pulsing sound. The new sonic screwdriver is meant to represent the TARDIS. The Doctor first uses it in "The Husbands of River Song" (although he also employs the sonic sunglasses earlier in the episode). The new screwdriver has seen use in the spin-off show ''[[Class (2016 TV series)|Class]]'', where the Doctor increases the voltage of flood lights to expel the Shadow Kin and partially close a rift in space-time. He is shown to have working copies of every version of the Sonic Screwdriver ever seen before in a cup on his desk in "The Pilot." Nardole uses the Fifth Doctor's version when sealing bulkhead doors to keep out Daleks later in the episode.

=== 2018 ===
In "[[The Woman Who Fell to Earth]]", the [[Thirteenth Doctor]] is depicted constructing a new sonic screwdriver. She proudly proclaims that the new screwdriver is forged out of "Sheffield Steel".

==== BBC Books ====
*The [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''The Murder Game'', set after ''The Power of the Daleks'', has the Second Doctor escaping from a locked room with a box-shaped sonic device, in which he muses on the advantages of building a smaller model. The novel ''Dreams of Empire'' by Justin Richards, set after ''The Ice Warriors'' and before ''Fury from the Deep'', features the Second Doctor using the device to break through a concrete wall. Stories with the device used by the Second Doctor before the screwdriver's first on-screen appearance are plausible as the Doctor in that story indicates that the machine "never fails", implying its successful use before that adventure.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*The [[BBC Short Trips|''More Short Trips'']] short story "Special Weapons", set late in season 24, indicates that the Seventh Doctor has a sonic screwdriver.
*The [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel, ''[[Father Time (Doctor Who)|Father Time]]'', features an amnesiac Doctor attempting to recreate the sonic screwdriver with 1980s technology, eventually producing a bulky device nicknamed the "sonic suitcase".
*In the [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|Ninth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[The Clockwise Man]]'' the sonic screwdriver is used to cauterise wounds, as a soldering iron, and to stop a clockwork mechanism. In ''[[The Monsters Inside (Doctor Who)|The Monsters Inside]]'' it is used to provide light, but runs out of power in the process. In ''[[Winner Takes All (Doctor Who)|Winner Takes All]]'' the Doctor fails to open a lock with it and concludes that it "hints at alien involvement". It is used to examine electronic [[standing stone]]s in ''[[The Deviant Strain]]''. In ''[[Only Human (Doctor Who)|Only Human]]'' it is used to restrain someone by welding wires to a chair; in the same novel the Doctor informs Quelly that the device contains 29 computers.
*In the Tenth Doctor Adventures novel ''[[The Stone Rose]]'', the sonic screwdriver is used to sedate animals. In ''[[The Nightmare of Black Island]]'' it is used to provide light. In ''[[The Last Dodo]]'' it is used to distract animals, and to liquefy and re-solidify tarmac. In ''[[Peacemaker (Doctor Who)|Peacemaker]]'', it is used to stop bullets and to dismantle guns.

====Big Finish audio dramas====
*In the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] [[List of Doctor Who audio plays by Big Finish|audio drama]] ''[[Pier Pressure (Doctor Who audio)|Pier Pressure]]'', [[Evelyn Smythe]] mentions that although the Sixth Doctor didn't possess a sonic screwdriver, he fondly remembered it as his "door key". The Sixth Doctor uses his fingernails as a stand-in for the screwdriver as an escape method in ''[[The Nowhere Place]]''.
*The Seventh Doctor uses the device in ''The Harvest'' and ''Dreamtime''. His companions Ace and Hex use the device in the Doctorless audio drama, ''The Veiled Leopard''.
*In ''[[Sword of Orion]],'' the Eighth Doctor reveals that his sonic screwdriver has a [[flashlight|torch]] built into the handle. In ''[[The Dying Days]]'' he uses the device to reflect the sonic cannon of an [[Ice Warrior]] back at his attacker. In ''[[Blood of the Daleks]]'' he uses it to trace a transmission beam.

====''Doctor Who'' comics====
*In an untitled story by [[Gary Russell]] featured in the first issue of [[IDW Publishing]]'s ''Doctor Who'' comic book (published February 2008), the Tenth Doctor uses his sonic screwdriver to destroy a sword and later sacrifices it in order to defeat a [[Sycorax]] hunter. Later, he indicates that he needs time to "grow" a new sonic screwdriver.

====Virgin Adventures====
*The Seventh Doctor regained his sonic screwdriver in the [[Virgin New Adventures]] novels, with its first reappearance in ''[[The Pit (Doctor Who)|The Pit]]''.
*The [[Virgin Missing Adventures]] novel ''[[Venusian Lullaby]]'' established that the [[First Doctor]] had a sonic screwdriver.

===Red Nose Day===
*In the [[Red Nose Day]] special, ''[[Doctor Who and the Curse of Fatal Death|The Curse of Fatal Death]]'', the final regeneration of the Doctor, played by [[Joanna Lumley]], enthusiastically remarks that the sonic screwdriver "has ''three'' settings" when it starts vibrating.
*In a comic ''[[The Catherine Tate Show]]'' sketch, [[Catherine Tate]]'s teenage character [[Lauren Cooper]] accuses her English teacher (played by [[David Tennant]]) of being "the Doctor". After much provocation, the teacher uses the sonic screwdriver to transform Lauren into a [[Rose Tyler]] action figure.

*The unlicensed [[fan fiction]] novel ''[[Time's Champion]]'' speculates that the Sixth Doctor has re-built the sonic screwdriver.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He used a similar device in ''[[The Nightmare Fair]]'', a script which was never produced for television but has been adapted twice.
*In the video game ''[[Robots (1984 video game)#Other versions|Daleks]]'' (published for operating systems of the early 1980s), the Doctor can use the sonic screwdriver to teleport and to defend himself against the Daleks.

===Public appearances===
*[[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] used the Eleventh Doctor's sonic screwdriver to turn on the Christmas Lights in [[Cardiff]] in November 2010. Its appearance was cheered by the crowd.

===''Doctor Who''===
*The Doctor has used other sonic devices similar to the sonic screwdriver, including the "door handle" of ''[[Inferno (Doctor Who)|Inferno]]'' ([[Liz Shaw]] having one of her own) and a pen-sized [[white noise]] generator in ''[[Four to Doomsday]]''.
*In the 1965 episode ''[[Galaxy 4|Trap of Steel]]'', the Doctor uses an apparently ''ordinary'' screwdriver to examine the metal of the Drahvin spaceship and other tasks.
*In the 1979 serial ''[[City of Death]]'', [[List of Doctor Who villains#Scaroth|Count Scarlioni]]'s henchmen use a "sonic knife" to cut the glass in front of the [[Mona Lisa]].
*In the 1985 serial ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]'', the Sixth Doctor uses a "sonic lance".
*In the 2005 episodes "[[The Empty Child]]" and "[[The Doctor Dances]]", [[Jack Harkness]] uses a "[[List of Doctor Who items#Sonic blaster|sonic blaster]]", referred to by Rose Tyler as a "squareness gun", capable of "digitising" structures by disintegrating them and then reversing the process, among other functions. The device resurfaces in "[[Silence in the Library]]" and "[[Forest of the Dead]]", now wielded by [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]]. Steven Moffat confirmed in an episode of ''Doctor Who Confidential'' that the device was the same one.
*In "[[Smith and Jones (Doctor Who)|Smith and Jones]]", Martha Jones sarcastically asks if he's got a "laser spanner" as well as a sonic screwdriver, which he apparently did until it was stolen by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]], described by the Doctor as a "cheeky woman".
*In "[[The Sound of Drums]]", [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] reveals his [[Master (Doctor Who)#Handheld weaponry|laser screwdriver]]. Unlike the sonic screwdriver, it is used as a weapon that can kill as well as artificially age its target, using technology developed by Lazarus Laboratories originally seen in "[[The Lazarus Experiment]]". It includes [[isomorphic]] controls, allowing only the Master to use the device. The design of the prop was meant to imply that the Master constructed it on Earth, and it was deliberately made larger than the Doctor's sonic screwdriver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/51.shtml BBC – Doctor Who – Series Three concept Artwork Gallery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227142654/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/gallery/concept_2007/51.shtml |date=27 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Doctor's screwdriver and Sarah Jane's lipstick, the Master's laser screwdriver was also created as a children's toy with sound effects. The laser screwdriver reappears in [[The Doctor Falls]] when the Master encounters his later female incarnation, Missy. Again, his screwdriver acts as a weapon, the Master using it to destroy a Cyberman and to kill Missy, shooting her in the back after she stabbed him in the back.
*In the series 4 episode "[[Partners in Crime (Doctor Who)|Partners in Crime]]", the antagonist Miss Foster is shown using a sonic device identified as a sonic pen, which the Doctor describes as having identical functionality to his screwdriver. It could, however, open deadlocked windows and compartments in the Adipose building that the sonic screwdriver couldn't. After confiscating and briefly using it, the Doctor throws the sonic pen into a bin. The sonic pen took the form of a sleek, black and silver fountain pen with a blue light at the top and was made into a toy version which was paired with the sonic screwdriver.
*In "Silence in the Library", Professor [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]] possesses a slightly bulkier sonic screwdriver, which she claims the Doctor gave to her in his future. The Doctor mentioned that he does not give his screwdriver to anyone. In the following episode, Professor Song mentions that her screwdriver is augmented with a "red setting" and "dampers". It also contains a hidden neural relay linked to River Song, saving her at the episode's conclusion—the purpose for which the future Doctor gave Professor Song the device. A toy version is available. It was revealed in "[[The Husbands of River Song]]" that it was the Twelfth Doctor who gave it to River. 
*In "Journey's End", Sarah Jane Smith is seen using her own sonic screwdriver, or ''sonic lipstick'' to open a door on the Dalek Crucible.
*In the Christmas special ''[[The Next Doctor]]'', Jackson Lake, who believes himself to be the Doctor, carries a regular screwdriver which he claims to be sonic. When the Doctor asks "How is it sonic?", Lake replies, "It makes a noise," which he demonstrates by tapping it against a door frame.
*In the series 6 episode "[[Let's Kill Hitler]]", the Doctor has a sonic cane which appears to have the same functions as the sonic screwdriver.
*In the series 6 episode "[[The Girl Who Waited]]", future [[Amy Pond]] has a "Sonic Probe" that she made herself. She claims she calls it a probe and not a screwdriver because that's what it is, and to signify that she has come to hate the Doctor. Later after she has forgiven him, she calls it a sonic screwdriver.
*[[Blue Peter]] announced that there will be three Sonic devices that will feature in Series 8 of Doctor Who, designed by Blue Peter watchers.&lt;ref name="Series 8 Sonics"&gt;{{cite web|title=Series 8 Sonic Devices for Paternoster Gang Revealed|url=http://www.doctorwhotv.co.uk/series-8-sonic-devices-for-paternoster-gang-revealed-57049.htm|publisher=doctorwhotv.co.uk|accessdate=21 December 2013|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first device is a Sonic Gauntlet for Jenny Flint that will feature making locks fall apart, radioactivity counter and receiver dish, that will allow you to watch shows.&lt;ref name="Series 8 Sonics"/&gt; The Second device is a Sonic Lorgnette for Commander Strax that has medical applications, such as X-ray, diagnostic lens (check for illness) and thermal lens.&lt;ref name="Series 8 Sonics"/&gt; The third device is Sonic Hat Pin for Madame Vastra that can be used as a remote control for her carriage and it can also be turned into a Sonic Sword with the flick of a switch.&lt;ref name="Series 8 Sonics"/&gt;

===''The Sarah Jane Adventures''===
In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off series, ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]'', [[Sarah Jane Smith]] uses a "sonic lipstick", which is a gift the [[Tenth Doctor]] gave her alongside a new model of [[K9 (Doctor Who)|K9]] and her scanner watch. It functions much like the sonic screwdriver, used primarily for opening and closing locked doors, and for disabling and re-enabling machines; like the sonic screwdriver, it remains ineffective against deadlock seals and wooden objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Sarah Jane Adventures – The Official Site| work = Alien Objects| publisher = BBC| url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/sja/theattic/alienobjects/| accessdate = 21 December 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090906074306/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/sja/theattic/alienobjects/| archivedate = 6 September 2009| df = dmy-all}} (UK Access Only)&lt;/ref&gt; A toy version is available.
*In ''[[Enemy of the Bane]]'', Mrs Wormwood ([[Samantha Bond]]) possesses a sonic device disguised as a ring called the "Phonic disruptor".

=== ''Torchwood'' ===
*In the ''Doctor Who'' spin-off series ''[[Torchwood]]'' episode "[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]", genius [[Toshiko Sato]]'s backstory reveals that she stole faulty designs from the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] and [[UNIT]], which she used to construct a sonic device, referred to as a "sonic modulator", to trade to a terrorist organisation in exchange for her mother. The device is confiscated by UNIT, which imprisons Sato until she is pardoned and recruited into [[Torchwood Institute|Torchwood]] by Jack Harkness.
*In the episodes "[[Day One (Torchwood)|Day One]]" and "[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]", Captain [[Jack Harkness]] uses a green device somewhat similar to a sonic screwdriver. Its origins and function are unknown.
*In "[[Greeks Bearing Gifts (Torchwood)|Greeks Bearing Gifts]]" a replica of the Doctor's sonic screwdriver can be seen on [[Toshiko Sato]]'s desk. Toshiko also uses a "lockpick" device in a number of episodes which replicates the door-opening function of the screwdriver.
*In ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', [[Gwen Cooper]] uses a similar device, which she refers to as a [[List of Torchwood items#G|Gizmo]], to deactivate CCTV cameras.

=== BBC books ===
*In the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Alien Bodies]]'', the Time Lord Homunculette has a sonic [[monkey wrench]].

== Commercial product ==
Ownership of the sonic screwdriver was retained by the BBC. [[Victor Pemberton]] told an interviewer for ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'', "I'm very cross that the sonic screwdriver—which I invented—has been marketed with no credit to myself. … It's one thing not to receive any payment, but another not to receive any credit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first=Benjamin| last=Cook| title=Friend of the Earth:-)| journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]]| issue=318| pages=10–14| date=26 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The toy version of the new series design (made by Character Options Ltd.) was slightly larger than the on screen version to accommodate a working sound chip. It also includes an ultraviolet [[Flashlight|light]] and changeable invisible ink nib for viewing messages written in the ultraviolet ink.

A metal version of the sonic screwdriver produced by [[Wow Stuff]] mounts a functional set of changeable flat and Phillips heads under a removable cover as well as providing light and sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wowstuff.co.uk/product/Sonic-Screwdriver/14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207065713/http://www.wowstuff.co.uk/product/Sonic-Screwdriver/14|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2011-02-07|title=Sonic Screwdriver|work=wowstuff.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=January 2018}}

The spaser is a proposed [[nanoscale]] source of [[optical field]]s that is being investigated in a number of leading laboratories around the world. Spasers could find a wide range of applications, including [[nanolithography|nanoscale lithography]], fabrication of ultra-fast [[Photonics|photonic]] nano circuits, single-molecule biochemical sensing, and microscopy.

From ''Nature Photonics'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nphoton/journal/v2/n6/full/nphoton.2008.85.html Spasers explained], Mark I. Stockman, ''Nature Photonics, 2, June, 327, (2008)''&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A spaser is the nanoplasmonic counterpart of a [[laser]], but it (ideally) does not emit [[photons]]. It is analogous to the conventional laser, but in a spaser photons are replaced by surface plasmons and the resonant cavity is replaced by a nanoparticle, which supports the plasmonic modes. Similarly to a laser, the energy source for the spasing mechanism is an active (gain) medium that is excited externally. This excitation field may be optical and unrelated to the spaser’s operating frequency; for instance, a spaser can operate in the near-[[infrared]] but the excitation of the gain medium can be achieved using an [[ultraviolet]] pulse.

The reason that surface plasmons in a spaser can work analogously to photons in a laser is that their relevant physical properties are the same. First, surface plasmons are [[bosons]]: they are vector excitations and have [[spin (physics)|spin]] 1, just as photons do. Second, surface plasmons are electrically neutral excitations. And third, surface plasmons are the most collective material oscillations known in nature, which implies they are the most harmonic (that is, they interact very weakly with one another). As such, surface plasmons can undergo stimulated emission, accumulating in a single mode in large numbers, which is the physical foundation of both the laser and the spaser.}}

Study of the quantum mechanical model of the spaser suggests that it should be possible to manufacture a spasing device analogous in function to the [[MOSFET]] transistor,&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/0908.3559 Spaser as Nanoscale Quantum Generator and Ultrafast Amplifier], Mark I. Stockman, ''arXiv.org &gt; Condensed Matter &gt; Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics, submitted 25 Aug 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; but this has not yet been experimentally verified.

[[File:SheddingBlade.jpg|thumb|A shedding blade has dull metal teeth that help remove the shedding winter hair coat of a horse or other short-haired animal. The shedding blade may be flipped over and the smooth side used as a sweat scraper in warm weather]]

A '''sweat scraper''' is a tool used in [[horse grooming]] and with other animals, such as [[Dog grooming|dogs]]. It consists of a [[Handle (grip)|handle]] and a [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[blade]]. Sweat scrapers are available in both metal and plastic form, and also traditionally in wood (as seen in [[Horse culture in Mongolia|Mongolia]]). It is used to remove sweat and/or excess hair from larger pets. It is used in much the same manner as a [[window cleaner]] would scrape water or foam from a window with a rubber blade. The typical use of a sweat scraper is now actually to remove excess water after washing a horse to help it cool down rather than for just sweat.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equisearch.com/farm_ranch/equipment/scraping-sweat/Scraping |title=Sweat by Equisearch - A brief article explaining popular sweat scrapers types currently used within the horse community |publisher=Equisearch.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without the use of a sweat scraper, it would take more effort and additional rags to remove the same amount of excess water therefore the proper use of a sweat scraper helps to ensure an effective cool down process.

In Section 203(a) of the [[Central Utah Project Completion Act]], the United States Congress authorized a federally authorized and funded replacement project to replace the Uinta and Upalco Units of the [[Central Utah Project]] (CUP) which were not constructed. The replacement project is the '''Uinta Basin Replacement Project''' (UBRP). The UBRP will provide: {{convert|2500|acre.ft|lk=in}} of irrigation water; {{convert|3000|acre.ft|lk=in}} of municipal and industrial water; reduced wilderness impacts; increased instream flows; and improved recreation. Design work began in 2002. Construction began in 2004 and is anticipated to be completed in 2011. The [[Central Utah Water Conservancy District]] is responsible for construction. The United States [[Department of the Interior]] oversees funding and compliance with law and environmental regulation.

==Description of the [[Uinta Basin]]==
The [[Uinta Mountains]] are the only major mountain range running east to west in [[North America]]. The Uinta Basin lies to the south of the Uinta Mountains and is fed by creeks and rivers flowing south from those mountains.  Many of the principal rivers (Strawberry River, Currant Creek, Rock Creek, Lake Fork River, and Uinta River) flow into the Duchesne River which feeds the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]]—a tributary of the [[Colorado River]].

The basin is the location of the [[Ute Tribe]] of the Uinta and Ouray Reservation (Tribe) which is commonly referred to as the Northern Ute Tribe, as well as the cities of Duchesne, Roosevelt, and Vernal. When oil prices are sufficiently high to overcome the cost of transportation to areas outside the basin, the area’s oil industry roars to life (as it has in the past two years). Ordinarily, agriculture (chiefly cattle operations) is the lifeblood of the basin economy; and, in the basin, irrigation is the lifeblood of agriculture. It is important to note also that wilderness designation protects much of the Uinta Mountains. The mountains and associated streams are an important ecological resource.
At the sabres game the fan in the section 203 seat 4 said the above

==Water Development in the Uinta Basin==
Interests competing for Uinta Basin water include: non-Indian irrigators, the Tribe, the cities, the oil industry, and the natural environment. All water development in the basin has been intended to serve one or more of these interests.

The UBRP is founded on and entwined with other water development in the basin. Key stages in that development are the establishment of the Northern Ute Reservation, homesteading and early water development, the Uinta Indian Irrigation Project, the Moon Lake Project, the CUP as originally planned (with the Uinta and Upalco Units), and the current UBRP.

* The Northern Ute Reservation&amp;nbsp;— The Northern Ute Reservation was established in 1861 and tribal water rights associated with the creation of the reservation share that filing date. To date, the Tribe has not fully asserted its water right claims. An adjudication of Uinta Basin water rights begun by the Utah state engineer in 1956 was placed in abeyance while the Tribe, the State of Utah, and the Secretary of the Interior negotiated a water rights compact. These negotiations, in one form or another, have continued for over forty years, although progress toward agreement has occurred since 2007.
* Homesteading and Early Water Development&amp;nbsp;— The reservation was opened for homesteading by non-Indians in 1905. During the early decades of the twentieth century, both Indian and non-Indian irrigation systems were constructed, including the construction of the High Mountain Lakes.
* The [[Uinta Indian Irrigation Project]] - The principal Indian irrigation project in the Basin is the Uinta Indian Irrigation Project. The [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) designed and constructed this project. By 1935, it was irrigating over {{convert|77000|acre|km2}} of Indian land. Today, the UIIP continues to serve Indian and non-Indian irrigators in the Lake Fork drainage and elsewhere in the Basin. It continues to be owned and operated by BIA.
* The [[Moon Lake Project]] - In the 1930s, the [[Bureau of Reclamation]] designed and constructed the Moon Lake Project on the Lake Fork River. The Association operates and maintains the Moon Lake Project on behalf of the Bureau of Reclamation and will operate and maintain the enlarged Big Sand Wash Dam and Reservoir.
* The Central Utah Project&amp;nbsp;–

In 1956, congress created the [[Colorado River Storage Project]], authorizing the CUP (as well as other Reclamation projects). The CUP provided for the trans-basin diversion of Uinta Basin water to the [[Wasatch Front]]. The Wasatch Front is the most populous area of Utah and includes [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] and [[Salt Lake City]]. The project mitigated for the trans-basin diversion by creating the Uinta and Upalco Units. These units would have provided new storage in the Uinta Basin—on the Uinta and Lake Fork Rivers respectively.

For a variety of reasons, the Uinta and Upalco Units were never constructed. Section 203 (a) of the Central Utah Project Completion Act authorized funding for UBRP—a project intended to provide similar benefits, in some measure, to those that were promised by the units that were not constructed. Originally, the UBRP project planned under the authority of Section 203 (a) was to serve both Indian and non-Indian needs using Indian and non-Indian water. Although planning continued for several years, the Tribe withdrew its support at the eleventh hour—as contracts were being executed. The departure of the Tribe made a reformulation of the plan necessary. Eventually, a scaled-down version was developed. The scaled-down project intentionally avoided interference with tribal water rights, lands, and interests.

The Central Utah Water Conservancy District (District) is the sponsor and entity responsible for repayment of the federal obligation associated with the Bonneville Unit of the CUP and UBRP.

==Stages==
Each stage in the Uinta Basin water development brought with it new water facilities. Each stage served a different bundle of water right interests and a different set of constituents. The result is a complex layering of economic interests, water rights, land ownership, management objectives, and politics.

Perhaps nowhere in the Basin is this layering and the accompanying actual and potential conflict more focused than the Lake Fork River. The river begins in the [[High Uintas Wilderness]] area and feeds thirteen small, high-elevation lakes-turned-reservoirs (High Mountain Lakes). It then provides early-priority Tribe flow rights though a portion of the UIIP, feeds Reclamation’s Moon Lake Project (serving non-Indian irrigators), and provides additional irrigation water by exchange with Starvation Reservoir (a CUP feature).  Because it diverts Lake Fork River water, integrating UBRP into this already complex and contentious water environment was difficult and problematic.

The Feasibility Study and Environmental Assessment for UBRP were published in 2001. As a partial replacement for the Uinta and Upalco Units, UBRP is intended to serve the following purposes: stabilizing the aging and unsafe High Mountain Lakes on the Lake Fork River drainage and restoring ecological values compatible with the High Uintas Wilderness; providing replacement water for the late season irrigation water stored in the High Mountain Lakes; providing {{convert|3000|acre.ft|lk=in}} of water per year to Roosevelt City for municipal and industrial (M&amp;I) purposes; providing {{convert|2500|acre.ft|lk=in}} of water per year to Lake Fork River irrigators; facilitating improved water resources management and water conservation in the Uinta Basin by increasing water efficiency, enhancing beneficial use, and developing water storage; and enhancing environmental, fish, wildlife, and recreation resources.

The project purposes are to be accomplished by construction (or upgrade) of the following facilities.

* High Mountain Lakes&amp;nbsp;— The stabilization of the thirteen High Mountain Lakes will eliminate the reservoir storage and will return the lakes to their natural levels. As a result, flows originating in the High Mountain Lakes’ watersheds will return to natural hydraulic runoff patterns and thereby restore fishery and recreational resources in the High Mountain Lakes. In addition, the wilderness impacts associated with operation and maintenance of the High Mountain Lakes will be eliminated.
* Big Sand Wash Diversion and Feeder Pipeline&amp;nbsp;— Construction of the Big Sand Wash Diversion and Feeder Pipeline has been completed. The Diversion diverts flows from the Lake Fork River into the Feeder Pipeline. The Feeder Pipeline transports the water to Big Sand Wash Reservoir—an existing off-stream reservoir that is being enlarged as part of the project.
* Enlarged Big Sand Wash Reservoir&amp;nbsp;— The enlargement of the Big Sand Wash Reservoir (by raising the level of the dam and associated dikes and saddle dams) will provide additional water storage capacity and regulation capability. The enlarged reservoir will allow for the storage of water that had been stored in the High Mountain Lakes. This transfer also results in improved instream flow in certain reaches of the Lake Fork River and its principal tributary—the Yellowstone River. The water stored in the enlarged reservoir will serve irrigation and M&amp;I purposes. Increasing the height of the new dam is being accomplished by removing about two-thirds of the downstream side of the old dam, excavating a new keyway immediately downstream of the remaining structure, constructing the new dam, and integrating the remnants of the old dam into the upstream fill of the new, taller structure.
* Big Sand Wash&amp;nbsp;– Roosevelt Pipeline&amp;nbsp;— The Big Sand Wash&amp;nbsp;– Roosevelt Pipeline will deliver project M&amp;I water to [[Roosevelt, Utah]] as well as project irrigation water to the lower portions of Lake Fork drainage systems.

'''Vitaphone''' was a [[sound film]] system used for [[feature film]]s and nearly 1,000 [[short subject]]s made by [[Warner Bros.]] and its sister studio [[First National Pictures|First National]] from 1926 to 1931.&lt;!-- 1930 widely stated as abandonment date, but dig deep and you will find that WB was still doing at least some mastering to disc in early 1931. Neither date takes into account the fact that discs were still being made and supplied to theaters that needed them for a few more years. --&gt; Vitaphone was the last major analog [[sound-on-disc]] system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on [[Gramophone record|phonograph records]]. The discs, recorded at {{frac|33|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] (a speed first used for this system) and typically {{convert|16|in|cm}} in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected, achieving a [[frequency response]] of 4300 Hz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aes.org/aeshc/docs/recording.technology.history/motionpicture1.html|title=AES Historical Committee|author=|date=|website=www.aes.org|accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many early [[sound film|talkies]], such as ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name "Vitaphone" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for "living" and "sound".

The "Vitaphone" trademark was later associated with cartoons and other short subjects that had [[sound-on-film|optical soundtracks]] and did not use discs.

==Early history==
In the early 1920s, [[Western Electric]] was developing both sound-on-film and sound-on-disc systems, aided by the purchase of [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Audion tube|Audion amplifier tube]] in 1913, consequent advances in [[public address]] systems, and the first practical [[condenser microphone]], which Western Electric engineer E.C. Wente had created in 1916 and greatly improved in 1922. De Forest debuted his own [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film system in New York City on April&amp;nbsp;15, 1923, but due to the relatively poor sound quality of Phonofilm and the impressive state-of-the-art sound heard in Western Electric's private demonstrations, the Warner Brothers decided to go forward with the industrial giant and the more familiar disc technology.

The business was established at Western Electric's [[Bell Laboratories]] in New York City and acquired by Warner Bros. in April 1925.&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA1-04143"&gt;Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;  Warner Bros. introduced Vitaphone on August 5, 1926 with the premiere of their silent feature ''[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]]''&lt;ref name=afi&gt;{{AFI film|3803}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which had been retrofitted with a symphonic musical score and sound effects. There was no spoken dialog. The feature was preceded by a program of short subjects with live-recorded sound, nearly all featuring classical instrumentalists and [[opera]] stars. The only "pop music" artist was guitarist [[Roy Smeck]] and the only actual "talkie" was the short film that opened the program: four minutes of introductory remarks by motion picture industry spokesman [[Will H. Hays|Will Hays]].

''Don Juan'' was able to draw huge sums of money at the box office,&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA1-04143"/&gt; but was not able to match the expensive budget Warner Bros. put into the film's production.&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA14143"&gt;Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; After its financial failure, Paramount head [[Adolph Zukor]] offered [[Sam Warner]] a deal as an executive producer for Paramount if he brought Vitaphone with him.&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA1414"&gt;Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Sam, not wanting to take any more of [[Harry Warner]]'s refusal to move forward with using sound in future Warner films, agreed to accept Zukor's offer,&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA1414" /&gt; but the deal died after Paramount lost money in the wake of [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s death.&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA1414" /&gt;  Harry eventually agreed to accept Sam's demands.&lt;ref name="HBTHYNA116"&gt;Sperling, Millner, and Warner (1998), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Sam then pushed ahead with a new Vitaphone feature starring [[Al Jolson]], the Broadway dynamo who had already scored a big hit with early Vitaphone audiences in ''[[A Plantation Act]]'', a musical short released on October&amp;nbsp;7, 1926. On October&amp;nbsp;6, 1927, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' premiered at the Warner Theater in New York City, broke box-office records, established Warner Bros. as a major player in Hollywood, and is traditionally credited with single-handedly launching the talkie revolution.

At first, the production of Vitaphone shorts and the recording of orchestral scores was strictly a New York phenomenon, taking advantage of the bountiful supply of stage and concert hall talent there, but the Warners soon migrated some of this activity to their more spacious facilities on the West Coast. Dance band leader [[Henry Halstead]] is given credit for starring in the first Vitaphone short subject filmed in Hollywood instead of New York. ''Carnival Night in Paris'' (1927) featured the Henry Halstead Orchestra and a cast of hundreds of costumed dancers in a Carnival atmosphere.

==Process==
From the perspective of the cast and crew on the sound stage, there was little difference between filming with Vitaphone and a sound-on-film system. In the early years of sound, the noisy cameras and their operators were enclosed in soundproofed booths with small windows made of thick glass. Cables suspended the microphones in fixed positions just above camera range, and sometimes they were hidden behind objects in the scene. The recording machines were usually located in a separate building to completely isolate them from sound stage floor vibrations and other undesirable influences. The audio signal was sent from an on-stage monitoring and control booth to the recording room over a heavy shielded cable. Synchronization was maintained by driving all the cameras and recorders with synchronous electric motors powered from a common source. When music and sound effects were being recorded to accompany existing film footage, the film was projected so that the conductor could synchronize the music with the visual cues and it was the projector, rather than a camera, that was electrically interlocked with the recording machine.

Except for the unusual disc size and speed, the physical record-making process was the same one employed by contemporary record companies to make smaller discs for home use. The recording lathe cut an audio-signal-modulated spiral groove into the polished surface of a thick round slab of wax-like material rotating on a turntable. The wax was much too soft to be played in the usual way, but a specially supported and guided pickup could be used to play it back immediately in order to detect any sound problems that might have gone unnoticed during the filming. If problems were found, the scene could then be re-shot while everything was still in place, minimizing additional expense. Even the lightest playback caused some damage to the wax master, so it was customary to employ two recorders and simultaneously record two waxes, one to play and the other to be sent for processing if that "take" of the scene was approved. At the processing plant, the surface of the wax was rendered electrically conductive and electroplated to produce a metal mold or "stamper" with a ridge instead of a groove, and this was used to [[record press|press]] hard shellac discs from molten "biscuits" of the raw material.

Because of the universal desirability of an immediate playback capability, even studios using sound-on-film systems employed a wax disc "playback machine" in tandem with their film recorders, as it was impossible to play an optical recording until it had made the round trip to the film processing laboratory.

A Vitaphone-equipped theater had normal [[Movie projector|projectors]] which had been furnished with special [[phonograph]] turntables and [[Magnetic cartridge|pickups]]; a [[Fade (audio engineering)|fader]]; an [[amplifier]]; and a [[loudspeaker]] system. The projectors operated just as motorized silent projectors did, but at a fixed speed of 24 [[Frame rate|frames per second]] and mechanically [[interlock (engineering)|interlocked]] with the attached turntables. When each projector was threaded, the projectionist would align a start mark on the film with the [[film gate]], then cue up the corresponding soundtrack disc on the turntable, being careful to place the phonograph needle at a point indicated by an arrow scribed on the record's surface. When the projector was started, it rotated the linked turntable and (in theory) automatically kept the record "in sync" (correctly synchronized) with the projected image.

The Vitaphone process made several improvements over previous systems:
* '''Amplification''' – The Vitaphone system used electronic amplification based on [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Audion tube]]. This allowed the sound to be played to a large audience at a comfortable volume. Vitaphone was far from the first sound film system to use this technology, but it had amplifiers and loudspeakers, developed by Western Electric, which were state-of-the-art. Their performance was greatly superior to anything else of the kind then available, including the equipment used by De Forest to present his own [[Phonofilm]] sound-on-film exhibitions.
* '''Fidelity''' – Contrary to conventional wisdom, neither Vitaphone's ability to fill a theater with an adequate volume of sound nor its success in maintaining synchronization was unprecedented. [[Léon Gaumont]]'s sound-on-disc films, which were being shown twenty years earlier, were successfully synchronized by the use of electrically interlinked multi-pole synchronous motors, and a pneumatic amplification system more than sufficed to fill Gaumont's 3,400-seat flagship theater in Paris with the recorded sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |authorlink=Douglas Self 
  |url=http://www.douglas-self.com/MUSEUM/COMMS/auxetophone/auxetoph.htm|title=The Auxetophone
  |accessdate=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; That sound, however, had to be recorded by the same insensitive non-electronic method introduced by [[Thomas Edison]] in 1877, or alternatively by a very crude microphone-based variant which had logistical advantages but did not offer improved fidelity. The resulting sound, however greatly amplified it might be, was tinny and unclear and speech was difficult to understand. The footsteps and other incidental sounds that audiences instinctively expected to hear were missing. It did not sound "natural". The Vitaphone system derived from extensive work on electronically recording and reproducing sound that had been carried out at [[Western Electric]] during the first half of the 1920s. Western Electric's engineers had developed a highly sensitive full-frequency-range condenser microphone, capable of capturing a whisper from several feet away, along with the electronic and mechanical equipment necessary to adequately record the audio signal it produced. As a result, the quality of Vitaphone sound in the theater came as a revelation to the audience at its public debut in 1926. It easily and dramatically surpassed anything previously achieved. It even surpassed the sound quality of Western Electric's own sound-on-film system, developed concurrently with the sound-on-disc system but still in the laboratory at that time, because at first the discs yielded better fidelity than an optical sound track.

These innovations notwithstanding, the Vitaphone process lost the early [[format war]] with sound-on-film processes for many reasons:
* '''Distribution''' – Vitaphone records had to be distributed along with film prints, and shipping the records required a whole infrastructure apart from the already-existing film distribution system. The records would start to suffer from audible wear after an estimated 20 playings (a check box system on the label was used to keep count) and were then supposed to be replaced with a fresh set. Damage and breakage were inherent dangers, so a spare set of discs was usually kept on hand, further adding to the costs.
* '''Synchronization''' – Vitaphone was vulnerable to severe synchronization problems, famously spoofed in MGM's 1952 musical ''[[Singin' in the Rain]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The initial garbling of image and sound simulated in the ''Singin' in the Rain'' scene are a far better depiction of a major foul-up in sound-on-film projection than of a sound-on-disc glitch, but the following comical mismatches are a fair depiction of the sort of memorable problem that could disrupt a Vitaphone presentation on a bad day.&lt;/ref&gt; If a record was improperly cued up,&lt;!--Skipping was spotlighted here. Discs not like "modern" vinyl LPs. Large groove, multi-ounce pickup weight. A skip required a major disturbance or a damaged disc--&gt; it would start out of sync with the picture and the projectionist would have to try to manually acquire sync. If the wrong record had been cued up there was no realistic option but to pause the show for a few minutes while swapping in the correct disc, resetting everything and starting that reel again. If the film print became damaged and was not precisely repaired, the relationship between the record and the print would be thrown off, also causing a loss of sync. Vitaphone projectors had special levers and linkages to advance and retard sync, but only within certain limits. Scrupulous care and attention were demanded from the projectionist. In the absence of [[human error]] and the occasional malfunction that can befall any complicated machine, the Vitaphone system worked as intended, but when a problem did occur it could be an embarrassing disaster.
* '''Editing''' – A phonograph record cannot be physically edited, and this significantly limited the creative potential of Vitaphone films. Warner Bros. went to great expense to develop a highly complex phonograph-based dubbing system, using synchronous motors and [[Strowger switch]]-triggered playback phonographs. Multiple source discs would be carefully cued up, then parts of each in turn were dubbed to a new master disc. The cutting of the new wax master could not be paused, so each playback turntable had to be started at just the right moment and each signal switched to the recorder at just the right moment. The system worked, but imprecisely enough that the reel of film often required some adjustment, by adding or removing one or more [[film frame]]s at imperfectly matched edit points, to conform it to the disc of edited sound. This discouraged frequent changes of scene in the film and the lively pace that they created. Editing sound on disc was a nightmare for the editor, and it was increasingly obvious to everyone that while the system sufficed for musical shorts and a synchronized musical accompaniment for otherwise silent films (the only applications originally planned), it was a clumsy way to make a feature-length film with "live" sound. By the middle of 1931, Warner Bros.-First National had thrown in the towel and was recording and editing optical sound on film, like all the other studios, and only then dubbing the completed soundtrack to discs for use with the Vitaphone projection system.
* '''Fidelity versus Sound-on-Film''' – The fidelity of sound-on-film processes was improved considerably after the early work by Lee De Forest on his [[Phonofilm]] system and that of his former associate [[Theodore Case]] on what eventually became the [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]] [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] system, introduced in 1927. The De Forest and Case-Fox systems used variable-density soundtracks, but the variable-area soundtrack used by [[RCA Photophone]], introduced in 1928, eventually predominated. Although the fidelity of optical sound never quite caught up with ongoing improvements in disc recording technology, for practical purposes the early quality advantage of discs had been overcome within a few years.

After the improvement of the competing sound-on-film systems, Vitaphone's disadvantages led to its retirement early in the sound era. Warner Bros. and First National stopped recording directly to disc and switched to Photophone sound-on-film recording. Warner Bros. had to publicly concede that Vitaphone was being retired, but put a positive spin on it by announcing that Warner films would now be available in ''both'' sound-on-film and sound-on-disc versions. Thus, instead of making a grudging admission that its technology had become obsolete, Warner Bros. purported to be doing the entire movie industry a favor.

A significant number of theater owners, who had invested heavily in Vitaphone equipment only a short time before, were financially unable or unwilling to replace their sound-on-disc-only equipment. Their continuing need for discs compelled most Hollywood studios to prepare sets of soundtrack discs for their new films, made by dubbing from the optical soundtracks, and supply them as required. This practice continued, although on an ever-dwindling scale, into the mid-1930s.

==Vitaphone soundtrack discs==
In 1924–1925, when Western Electric established the format of the system which would eventually be named Vitaphone, they settled on a {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter disc rotating at {{frac|33|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] as a good practical compromise of disc size and speed. The slow speed permitted the 11-minute playing time needed to match the maximum running time of a then-standard 1000 foot (300 meter) reel of film projected at 24&amp;nbsp;[[frame rate|fps]], yet the increased diameter preserved the average effective groove velocity, and therefore the sound quality, of a smaller, shorter-playing record rotating at the then-standard speed of about 78&amp;nbsp;rpm.

Like ordinary pre-[[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]] records, Vitaphone discs were made of a [[shellac]] compound rendered lightly abrasive by its major constituent, finely pulverized rock. Such records were played with a very inexpensive, imprecisely mass-produced steel needle with a point that quickly wore to fit the contour of the groove, but then went on to wear out in the course of playing one disc side, after which it was meant to be discarded and replaced. Unlike ordinary records, Vitaphone discs were recorded inside out, so that the groove started near the synchronization arrow scribed in the blank area around the label and proceeded outward. During playback, the needle would therefore be fresh where the groove's undulations were most closely packed and needed the most accurate tracing, and suffering from wear only as the much more widely spaced and easily traced undulations toward the edge of the disc were encountered.

Initially, Vitaphone discs had a recording on one side only, each reel of film having its own disc. As the sound-on-disc method was slowly relegated to second-class status, cost-cutting changes were instituted, first by making use of both sides of each disc for non-consecutive reels of film, then by reducing the discs to {{convert|14|or|12|in|cm}} in diameter. The use of RCA Victor's new "Vitrolac", a lightweight, flexible and less abrasive vinyl-based compound, made it possible to downsize the discs while actually improving their sound quality.&lt;ref&gt;Barton, F.C. (1932 [1931]). ''Victrolac Motion Picture Records''. Journal of the Society of Motion Picture Engineers, April 1932 '''18'''(4):452–460 (accessed at archive.org on 5 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

There were exceptions to the {{convert|16|in|cm|adj=on}} standard size of 1920s Vitaphone discs. In the case of very short films, such as [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] and some of the earliest musical shorts, the recording, still cut at {{frac|33|1|3}}&amp;nbsp;[[Revolutions per minute|rpm]] and working outward from a minimum diameter of about {{convert|7+1/2|in|cm}}, was pressed on a {{convert|12|or|10|in|cm|adj=on}} disc when the smaller size sufficed.

==The Vitaphone Project==

In 1991, The Vitaphone Project was started by a group of five vintage record collectors and movie enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="IndieWire"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maltin|first1=Leonard|title=The Vitaphone Project Turns 20|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2011/08/the-vitaphone-project-turns-20-178992/|website=IndieWire|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the soundtrack discs and film prints of Vitaphone productions often became separated, The Vitaphone Project searches for original 16-inch soundtrack discs and mute film elements that go with surviving soundtrack discs. The Vitaphone Project borrows or purchases soundtrack discs from private collectors and often works with the restoration labs at the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] to create new 35mm preservation prints that combine the original picture and sound elements. The Vitaphone Project also often partners with the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[British Film Institute]].&lt;ref name="Archive"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monaghan|first1=Peter|title=A Resounding 25 Years of Reviving Early Film|url=http://www.movingimagearchivenews.org/a-resounding-25-years-of-reviving-early-film/|website=Moving Image Archive News|accessdate=11 December 2017|date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of December 2016, The Vitaphone Project had located about 6,500 soundtrack discs in private collections and helped preserve 125 films, 12 of which were feature-length films. They have also raised $400,000 in donations, with [[Hugh Hefner]] being a notable donor.&lt;ref name="Archive" /&gt;

The Vitaphone Project has been able to help restore films featuring stars such as [[Rose Marie]] and [[Al Jolson]]. They also worked with Warner Brothers to restore 1929's ''[[Why Be Good?]]'', the final silent film made by [[Colleen Moore]].&lt;ref name="Archive" /&gt; Funding raised by The Vitaphone Project was used to restore 1928's ''[[The Beau Brummels (film)|The Beau Brummels]]'', starring vaudeville duo Al Shaw and Sam Lee, which was added to the [[National Film Registry]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shaw &amp; Lee 1928 Vitaphone Short Chosen for 2016 National Film Registry by Library of Congress|url=http://www.picking.com/vitaphone141.html|website=The Vitaphone Project|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 additions to the National Film Registry|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/national-film-registry-additions-2016/5/|website=CBS News|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=11 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Warner Bros. kept the "Vitaphone" trademark alive in the name of its short subjects division, '''The Vitaphone Corporation''' (officially dissolved at the end of 1959), most famous for releasing the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' and ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' cartoons. In the 1950s, the Warner Bros. record label boasted "Vitaphonic" high-fidelity recording. In the 1960s, the end titles of ''Merrie Melodies'' cartoons (beginning with ''[[From Hare to Heir]]'' (1960)) carried the legend "A Vitaphone Release". ''Looney Tunes'' of the same period (beginning with that same year's ''[[Hopalong Casualty]]'') were credited as "A Vitagraph Release", making further use of the name of the venerable [[Vitagraph Studios]] in Brooklyn, which the Warners had bought in 1925, used as a facility for working out practical sound film production techniques and filming some early musical shorts, and from which a name for the previously nameless Western Electric sound-on-disc system had been derived.

Vitaphone was among the first 25 inductees into the [[TEC Awards#TECnology Hall of Fame|TECnology Hall of Fame]] at its establishment in 2004, an honor given to "products and innovations that have had an enduring impact on the development of audio technology." The award notes that Vitaphone, though short-lived, helped in popularizing theater sound and was critical in stimulating the development of the modern [[sound reinforcement system]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mixfoundation.org/hof/04techof.html#4 Mix Foundation. ''TECnology Hall of Fame, 2004'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Though operating on principles so different as to make it unrecognizable to a Vitaphone engineer, [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] is a sound-on-disc system, the first to gain wide adoption since the abandonment of Vitaphone.

{{Electromagnetism|Network}}

In [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetics]] and [[communications system engineering|communications engineering]], the term '''waveguide''' may refer to any linear structure that conveys electromagnetic waves between its endpoints. However, the original&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"&gt;Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, “The IEEE standard dictionary of electrical and electronics terms”; 6th ed. New York, N.Y., Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, c1997. IEEE Std 100-1996. {{ISBN|1-55937-833-6}} [ed. Standards Coordinating Committee 10, Terms and Definitions; Jane Radatz, (chair)]&lt;/ref&gt; and most common&lt;ref name="IEEEdict1997"/&gt; meaning is a hollow metal pipe used to carry [[radio wave]]s.  This type of waveguide is used as a [[transmission line]] mostly at [[microwave]] frequencies, for such purposes as connecting microwave [[transmitter]]s and [[Radio receiver|receivers]] to their [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, in equipment such as [[microwave oven]]s, [[radar]] sets, [[satellite communications]], and microwave radio links.

A '''dielectric waveguide''' employs a solid [[dielectric]] rod rather than a hollow pipe. An [[optical fibre]] is a dielectric guide designed to work at optical frequencies. [[Transmission lines]] such as [[microstrip]], [[coplanar waveguide]], [[stripline]] or [[coaxial cable]] may also be considered to be waveguides.

The electromagnetic waves in a (metal-pipe) waveguide may be imagined as travelling down the guide in a zig-zag path, being repeatedly reflected between opposite walls of the guide. For the particular case of '''rectangular waveguide''', it is possible to base an exact analysis on this view. Propagation in a dielectric waveguide may be viewed in the same way, with the waves confined to the dielectric by [[total internal reflection]] at its surface. Some structures, such as [[non-radiative dielectric waveguide]]s and the [[Goubau line]], use both metal walls and dielectric surfaces to confine the wave.

==History==

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He showed that the waves could travel without attenuation only in specific [[normal mode]]s  with either the [[electric field]] ([[TE mode]]s)  or [[magnetic field]] ([[TM mode]]s), or both, perpendicular to the direction of propagation.  He also showed each mode had a [[cutoff frequency]] below which waves would not propagate.  Since the cutoff wavelength for a given tube was of the same order as its width, it was clear that a hollow conducting tube could not carry radio wavelengths much larger than its diameter. In 1902 R. H. Weber observed that electromagnetic waves travel at a slower speed in tubes than in free space, and deduced the reason; that the waves travel in a "zigzag" path as they reflect from the walls.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kizer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal | last1  = Weber | first1 = R.

Prior to the 1920s, practical work on radio waves concentrated on the low frequency end of the radio spectrum, as these frequencies were better for long-range communication.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  These were far below the frequencies that could propagate in even large waveguides, so there was little experimental work on waveguides during this period, although a few experiments were done.   In a June 1, 1894 lecture, "The work of Hertz", before the [[Royal Society]], [[Oliver Lodge]] demonstrated the transmission of 3 inch radio waves from a [[spark gap]] through a short cylindrical copper duct.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lodge"&gt;{{cite journal

During the 1920s the first continuous sources of high frequency radio waves were developed:  the [[Barkhausen-Kurz tube]],&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first oscillator which could produce power at [[ultrahigh frequency|UHF]] frequencies; and the [[cavity magnetron|split-anode magnetron]] which by the 1930s had generated radio waves at up to 10&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  These made possible the first systematic research on microwaves in the 1930s. It was discovered that [[transmission line]]s used to carry lower frequency radio waves, [[Twin lead|parallel line]] and [[coaxial cable]], had excessive power losses at microwave frequencies, creating a need for a new transmission method.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;

The waveguide was developed independently between 1932 and 1936 by [[George C. Southworth]] at [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]]&lt;ref name="Southworth"&gt;{{cite journal

Barrow]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], who worked without knowledge of one another.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kizer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lee" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  Southworth's interest was sparked during his 1920s doctoral work in which he measured the [[dielectric constant]] of water with a radio frequency [[Lecher line]] in a long tank of water.  He found that if he removed the Lecher line, the tank of water still showed resonance peaks, indicating it was acting as a [[dielectric waveguide]].&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  At Bell Labs in 1931 he resumed work in dielectric waveguides.  By March 1932 he observed waves in water-filled copper pipes.  Rayleigh's previous work had been forgotten, and [[Sergei A. Schelkunoff]], a Bell Labs mathematician, did theoretical analyses of waveguides&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schelkunoff"&gt;{{cite journal

Barrow had become interested in high frequencies in 1930 studying under [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] in Germany.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  At MIT beginning in 1932 he worked on high frequency antennas to generate narrow beams of radio waves to locate aircraft in fog.  He invented a [[horn antenna]] and hit on the idea of using a hollow pipe as a feedline to feed radio waves to the antenna.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;  By March 1936 he had derived the propagation modes and cutoff frequency in a rectangular waveguide.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  The source he was using had a large wavelength of 40&amp;nbsp;cm, so for his first successful waveguide experiments he used a 16-foot section of air duct, 18 inches in diameter.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;

Barrow and Southworth became aware of each other's work a few weeks before both were scheduled to present papers on waveguides to a combined meeting of the [[American Physical Society]] and the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]] in May 1936.&lt;ref name="Packard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;  They amicably worked out credit sharing and patent division arrangements.

The development of centimeter [[radar]] during World War 2 and the first high power microwave tubes, the [[klystron]] (1938) and [[cavity magnetron]] (1940), resulted in the first widespread use of waveguide.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;       Standard waveguide "plumbing" components were manufactured, with flanges on the end which could be bolted together.  After the war in the 1950s and 60s waveguides became common in commercial microwave systems, such as airport radar and [[microwave relay]] networks which were built to transmit telephone calls and television programs between cities.

==Principle of operation==
[[Image:Diplexer1.jpg|thumb|Example of waveguides and a [[diplexer]] in an air traffic control radar]]

Depending on the frequency, waveguides can be constructed from either conductive or [[dielectric]] materials. Generally, the lower the frequency to be passed the larger the waveguide is. For example, the natural waveguide the earth forms given by the dimensions between the conductive ionosphere and the ground as well as the circumference at the median altitude of the Earth is resonant at 7.83&amp;nbsp;Hz. This is known as [[Schumann resonance]]. On the other hand, waveguides used in [[extremely high frequency]] (EHF) communications can be less than a millimeter in width.

==Analysis==

Electromagnetic waveguides are analyzed by solving [[Maxwell's equations]], or their reduced form, the [[electromagnetic wave equation]], with [[boundary conditions]] determined by the properties of the materials and their interfaces. These equations have multiple solutions, or modes, which are [[eigenfunction]]s of the equation system. Each mode is characterized by a [[cutoff frequency]] below which the mode cannot exist in the guide.  Waveguide propagation modes depend on the operating [[wavelength]] and [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] and the shape and size of the guide. The [[longitudinal mode]] of a waveguide is a particular [[standing wave]] pattern formed by waves confined in the cavity. The [[transverse mode]]s are classified into different types:
* TE modes (transverse electric) have no electric field in the direction of propagation.
* TM modes (transverse magnetic) have no magnetic field in the direction of propagation.
* TEM modes (transverse electromagnetic) have no electric nor magnetic field in the direction of propagation.
* Hybrid modes have both electric and magnetic field components in the direction of propagation.
In hollow waveguides (single conductor), TEM waves are not possible, since [[Maxwell's Equations]] will give that the electric field must then have zero divergence and zero curl and be equal to zero at boundaries, resulting in a zero field (or, equivalently, &lt;math&gt;\nabla ^2 \Phi=0&lt;/math&gt; with boundary conditions guaranteeing only the trivial solution).  This contrasts with two-conductor [[transmission line]]s used at lower frequencies; [[coaxial cable]], [[twin lead|parallel wire line]] and [[stripline]], in which TEM mode is possible.   Additionally, the propagating modes (i.e. TE and TM) inside the waveguide can be mathematically expressed as the superposition of TEM waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chakravorty | first1 = Pragnan | year = 2015| title = Analysis of Rectangular Waveguides – An Intuitive Approach | url = | journal = IETE Journal of Education | volume = 55 | issue = 2| pages = 76–80 | doi = 10.1080/09747338.2014.1002819 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mode with the lowest cutoff frequency is termed the '''dominant mode''' of the guide. It is common to choose the size of the guide such that only this one mode can exist in the frequency band of operation. In rectangular and circular (hollow pipe) waveguides, the dominant modes are designated the TE&lt;sub&gt;1,0&lt;/sub&gt; mode and TE&lt;sub&gt;1,1&lt;/sub&gt; modes respectively.&lt;ref&gt;A. Y. Modi and C. A.

In the [[microwave]] region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], a waveguide normally consists of a hollow metallic conductor.  These waveguides can take the form of single conductors with or without a dielectric coating, e.g. the [[Goubau line]] and helical waveguides.  Hollow waveguides must be one-half wavelength or more in diameter in order to support one or more transverse wave modes.

Waveguides may be filled with pressurized gas to inhibit arcing and prevent [[multipaction]], allowing higher power transmission. Conversely, waveguides may be required to be evacuated as part of evacuated systems (e.g. electron beam systems).

A [[slotted waveguide]] is generally used for [[radar]] and other similar applications. The waveguide serves as a feed path, and each slot is a separate radiator, thus forming an antenna.  This structure has the capability of generating a radiation pattern to launch an [[electromagnetic wave]] in a specific relatively narrow and controllable direction.

A '''closed waveguide''' is an electromagnetic waveguide (a) that is tubular, usually with a circular or rectangular cross section, (b) that has electrically conducting walls, (c) that may be hollow or filled with a [[dielectric]] material, (d) that can support a large number of discrete propagating modes, though only a few may be practical, (e) in which each discrete mode defines the [[propagation constant]] for that mode, (f) in which the [[field (physics)|field]] at any point is describable in terms of the supported modes, (g) in which there is no [[radiation]] field, and (h) in which discontinuities and bends may cause mode conversion but not radiation.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The dimensions of a hollow metallic waveguide determine which wavelengths it can support, and in which modes. Typically the waveguide is operated so that only a single mode is present.  The lowest order mode possible is generally selected. Frequencies below the guide's cutoff frequency will not propagate. It is possible to operate waveguides at higher order modes, or with multiple modes present, but this is usually impractical.

Waveguides are almost exclusively made of metal and mostly rigid structures. There are certain types of "corrugated" waveguides that have the ability to flex and bend but only used where essential since they degrade propagation properties. Due to propagation of energy in mostly air or space within the waveguide, it is one of the lowest loss transmission line types and highly preferred for high frequency applications where most other types of transmission structures introduce large losses. Due to the [[skin effect]] at high frequencies, electric current along the walls penetrates typically only a few [[micrometre|micrometers]] into the metal of the inner surface. Since this is where most of the resistive loss occurs, it is important that the conductivity of interior surface be kept as high as possible. For this reason, most waveguide interior surfaces are plated with [[copper]], [[silver]], or [[gold]].
  
Voltage standing wave ratio ([[VSWR]]) measurements may be taken to ensure that a waveguide is contiguous and has no leaks or sharp bends. If such bends or holes in the waveguide surface are present, this may diminish the performance of both transmitter and receiver equipment connected at either end. Poor transmission through the waveguide may also occur as a result of moisture build up which corrodes and degrades conductivity of the inner surfaces, which is crucial for low loss propagation. For this reason, waveguides are nominally fitted with [[microwave windows]] at the outer end that will not interfere with propagation but keep the elements out. Moisture can also cause [[fungus]] build up or arcing in high power systems such as radio or radar transmitters. Moisture in waveguides can typically be prevented with [[silica gel]], a [[desiccant]], or slight pressurization of the waveguide cavities with dry [[nitrogen]] or [[argon]]. Desiccant silica gel canisters may be attached with screw-on nibs and higher power systems will have pressurized tanks for maintaining pressure including leakage monitors. Arcing may also occur if there is a hole, tear or bump in the conducting walls, if transmitting at high power (usually 200 watts or more)&lt;!-- (Need reference for the power statement) --&gt;.

Voltage standing waves occur when impedance mismatches in the waveguide cause energy to reflect back in the opposite direction of propagation. In addition to limiting the effective transfer of energy, these reflections can cause higher voltages in the waveguide and damage equipment.

===Waveguide in practice===
In practice, waveguides act as the equivalent of cables for [[super high frequency]] (SHF) systems. For such applications, it is desired to operate waveguides with only one mode propagating through the waveguide. With rectangular waveguides, it is possible to design the waveguide such that the frequency band over which only one mode propagates is as high as 2:1 (i.e. the ratio of the upper band edge to lower band edge is two).  The relation between the waveguide dimensions and the lowest frequency is simple: if &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle W&lt;/math&gt; is the greater of its two dimensions, then the longest wavelength that will propagate is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \lambda\;=\;2W&lt;/math&gt; and the lowest frequency is thus &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle f\;=\; c/\lambda\;=\;c/2W&lt;/math&gt;

With circular waveguides, the highest possible bandwidth allowing only a single mode to propagate is only 1.3601:1.&lt;ref&gt;For bandwidths lower than 2:1 it is more common to express them as a percentage of the center frequency, which in the case of 1.360:1 is 26.55&amp;nbsp;%. For reference, a 2:1 bandwidth corresponds to a 66.67&amp;nbsp;% bandwidth. The reason for expressing bandwidths as a ratio of upper to lower band edges for bandwidths greater than 66.67&amp;nbsp;% is that in the limiting case that the lower edge goes to zero (or the upper edge goes to infinity), the bandwidth approaches 200&amp;nbsp;%, which means that the entire range of 3:1 to infinity:1 map into the range 100&amp;nbsp;% to 200&amp;nbsp;%.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because rectangular waveguides have a much larger bandwidth over which only a single mode can propagate, standards exist for rectangular waveguides, but not for circular waveguides. In general (but not always), standard waveguides are designed such that
* one band starts where another band ends, with another band that overlaps the two bands&lt;ref name="Harvey"/&gt;
* the lower edge of the band is approximately 30% higher than the waveguide's [[cutoff frequency]]
* the upper edge of the band is approximately 5% lower than the cutoff frequency of the next higher order mode
* the waveguide height is half the waveguide width

The first condition is to allow for applications near band edges. The second condition limits [[Dispersion (optics)|dispersion]], a phenomenon in which the velocity of propagation is a function of frequency. It also limits the loss per unit length. The third condition is to avoid [[Evanescent wave#Evanescent-wave coupling|evanescent-wave coupling]] via higher order modes. The fourth condition is that which allows a 2:1 operation bandwidth. Although it is possible to have a 2:1 operating bandwidth when the height is less than half the width, having the height exactly half the width maximizes the power that can propagate inside the waveguide before [[dielectric breakdown]] occurs.

Below is a table of standard waveguides. The waveguide name ''WR'' stands for ''waveguide rectangular'', and the number is the inner dimension width of the waveguide in hundredths of an [[inch]] (0.01&amp;nbsp;inch = 0.254&amp;nbsp;mm) rounded to the nearest hundredth of an inch.

For the frequencies in the table above, the main advantage of waveguides over [[coax cable|coaxial cable]]s is that waveguides support propagation with lower loss. For lower frequencies, the waveguide dimensions become impractically large, and for higher frequencies the dimensions become impractically small (the manufacturing tolerance becomes a significant portion of the waveguide size).

At these wavelengths dielectric waveguides can have lower losses than metal waveguides.   [[Optical fiber]] is a form of dielectric waveguide used at optical wavelengths.

One difference between dielectric and metal waveguides is that at a metal surface the electromagnetic waves are tightly confined; at high frequencies the electric and magnetic fields penetrate a very short distance into the metal.  In contrast, the surface of the dielectric waveguide is an interface between two dielectrics, so the fields of the wave penetrate outside the dielectric in the form of an [[evanescent wave|evanescent]] (non-propagating) wave.&lt;ref name="Rana" /&gt;
