The '''1987 Rheindahlen bombing''' was a [[car bomb]] attack on 23 March 1987 at [[JHQ Rheindahlen]] military barracks, the [[British Army]] headquarters in [[West Germany]], injuring thirty-one. The large 300&amp;nbsp;lb (140&amp;nbsp;kg) car bomb exploded near the visitors officers' mess of the barracks. The [[Provisional IRA]] later stated it had carried out the bombing. It was the start of the IRA's campaign on mainland Europe from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. Although British soldiers were targeted, most of the injured were actually German officers and their wives.

==Background==
Other than attacks in Northern Ireland &amp; mainland [[Great Britain|Britain]] the Provisional IRA also carried out attacks in other countries such as West Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, where British soldiers were based. Between 1979 and 1990, eight unarmed soldiers and six civilians died in these attacks. It was the first IRA attack in West Germany since a British Army officer, Colonel Mark Coe, was shot dead by an IRA unit outside his home in, [[Bielefeld]] in February 1980. Coe's assassination was one of the first high-profile killings by the IRA in Germany and on mainland Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=16&amp;month=02&amp;year=1980|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year before, British Ambassador to the Netherlands Sir [[Richard Sykes (diplomat)|Richard Sykes]] was assassinated, whilst four British soldiers were hurt in the [[1979 Brussels bombing]] in Belgium, just one day after the killing of [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] and the [[Warrenpoint ambush]], which killed 18 British soldiers. In November 1981 the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) bombed a British Army base in [[Herford]], West Germany. There were no injuries in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch81.htm#Nov|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1981|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&amp;day=22&amp;month=03&amp;year=1979|title=CAIN: Sutton Index of Deaths|first=Malcolm|last=Sutton|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a mortar attack on British Army base in Germany in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch96.htm#Jun|title=CAIN: Chronology of the Conflict 1996|first=Dr Martin|last=Melaugh|website=cain.ulst.ac.uk|accessdate=17 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author Ed Moloney's "The Secret History of the IRA", IRA Chief of Staff Kevin McKenna before the capture of the ''Eksund'' (a ship that was to ship heavy weaponry to the IRA from [[Libya]]) envisaged a three-pronged offensive that would start in the Northern Ireland and then spread to British targets in mainland Europe.

==The bombing==
The IRA planted a 300-pound car bomb inside the JHQ Rheindahlen British Army military base, near the officers' mess. When the large car bomb exploded 31 people was injured, some of them badly. Twenty-seven West Germans and four Britons were hurt in the bombing at 22:30 local time. More than 12,000 service personnel were stationed at the base. It was the joint headquarters of the British Army of the Rhine and the [[Royal Air Force]] ([[RAF Rheindahlen]]).

The force of the blast ripped up the road and caused extensive damage to parked cars and surrounding buildings. The injured were taken to the RAF hospital at [[Wegberg]], a few miles south of Rheindahlen, near the Dutch border. The bomb caused parts of the ceiling to collapse and doors were ripped from their frames. A police spokesman said the blast blew out windows in buildings several hundred yards away.

It looked like it was a reasonably successful attack from the IRA's point of view but the IRA actually had a close escape. The only reason people had not been killed was that the IRA [[active service unit|ASU]] was unable to position the car bomb closer to the mess, because the car park was full of vehicles. Unknown to the IRA unit, most of the vehicles were owned by West German military officers who had been invited to spend a social evening with their British counterparts. Had the IRA's operation plan been carried out fully many of these German officers could have been killed and the start of the IRA's Europe campaign would have been a diplomatic and military disaster and a big blow to any of the IRA's international support.

==Aftermath==
The IRA later said it had carried out the bombing of the Rheindahlen barracks. A statement from the IRA said: "Our unit's brief was to inflict a devastating blow but was ordered to be careful to avoid civilian casualties."

The National Democratic Front for the Liberation of West Germany, a previously unheard of group, also claimed to have been behind the attack, but this was dismissed by police investigators. 

The British Army of the Rhine was renamed British Forces Germany (BFG) in 1994.

{{History of the Basque people}}
{{Refimprove|date=January 2012}}

The [[Basque Country (greater region)|greater Basque Country]] comprises the [[Autonomous Communities]] of the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and [[Navarre]] in Spain and the [[Northern Basque Country]] in France. The Prehistory of the region begins with the arrival of the first [[hominin]] settlers during the [[Paleolithic]] and lasts until the [[Roman conquest of Hispania|conquest]] and colonisation of [[Hispania]] by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] after the [[Second Punic War]], who introduced comprehensive administration, writing and regular recordings.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.heritage-history.com/index.php?c=resources&amp;s=war-dir&amp;f=wars_hispania |title = Conquest of Hispania  |author =  |accessdate = December 30, 2017 |publisher = Heritage History }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Basque people are the only Western Europeans that speak a non-Indo-European language - [[Basque language|Euskera]] - without having any known contemporary European ethnic or linguistic relatives.&lt;ref name=“BBC“&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-34175224 |title = Ancient DNA cracks puzzle of Basque origins  |author =  |date = September 7, 2015 |accessdate = December 30, 2017 |publisher = BBC }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 DNA study supports the idea that the Basques descend from Neolithic farmers who mixed with local hunters and were subsequently isolated for millennia.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.pnas.org/content/112/38/11917 |title = Ancient genomes link early farmers from Atapuerca in Spain to modern-day Basques  |author =  |date = July 29, 2015 |accessdate = December 30, 2017 |publisher = National Academy of Sciences. }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Author ''Ellen Levy-Coffman'' summarizes in the ''Journal of Genetic Genealogy'': "The Basques are generally depicted not only genetic vestiges of the most ancient inhabitants of Europe, but also one of the oldest human isolates, receiving no significant genetic contributions from outsiders. This isolation is supposedly reflected by Basque cultural/linguistic uniqueness, a high level of [[endogamy]], and geographic protection among the [[Pyrenees]] Mountains."&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jogg.info/pages/22/Coffman.pdf |title = We Are Not Our Ancestors: Evidence for Discontinuity between Prehistoric and Modern Europeans - The Basque: Reflections of a Paleolithic Past?  |author = Ellen Levy-Coffman |date =  |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |publisher = Journal of Genetic Genealogy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lower and Middle Paleolithic==
[[Image:Homo antecessor male.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Model of male ''Homo antecessor'']]
The earliest [[Homo erectus]] migration events into Western Europe and the Basque Country had very little impact on history, culture and settlement forms. Notable is nonetheless the [[Atapuerca Mountains]] complex in northern Spain, that was inhabited in sizable communities by ''[[Homo antecessor]]'' (or ''Homo erectus antecessor'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and Neanderthals for many generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E05E2D9113BF933A1575AC0A9619C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=dmanisi%201.8%20million&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Fossils Reveal Clues on Human Ancestor | date=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first substantial settler groups have arrived during the [[Eemian interglacial|Riss-Würm interglacial period]], between 150,000 and 75,000 BP, who left traces of [[Acheulean]] culture and technology. These groups usually settled in the riverine lowlands, near the rivers [[Ebro]] and [[Adour]] in the regions of [[Álava|Araba]], [[Navarre]], [[Labourd]] and [[Lower Navarre]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.kondaira.net/eng/Historia0002.html |title = HISTORY OF THE BASQUE COUNTRY - PREHISTORY  |author =  |date =  |accessdate = December 30, 2017 |publisher = Kondaira }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homo neanderthalensis]] [[Mousterian]] culture is introduced during the [[Middle Paleolithic]]. Neanderthals left a rather rich and long cultural sequence in northern Spain, who in the Basque Country populated the high coastal lands of [[Biscay]] and [[Gipuzkoa]]. Neanderthal remains have also been found in the Lezetxiki and [[Axlor]] caves.&lt;ref name=″Zilh″&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.ffzg.unizg.hr/arheo/ska/tekstovi/extinction.pdf |title = The Extinction of Iberian Neandertals and Its Implications for the Origins of Modern Humans in Europe |author = João Zilhão |date = 22 December 1998 |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |work = Studentski klub arheologa |publisher = [[Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upper Paleolithic==
[[Image:Early_Upper_Paleolithic_in_the_Basque_Country.png|thumb|250px|Main Early Upper Paleolithic sites in the Basque Country]]
[[Cro-Magnon|Homo sapiens]] first arrived on the [[Iberian peninsula]] during the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period that starts the process of replacement of Mousterian industries by the Aurignacian culture. A number of researchers suggest that the Ebro river functioned for extended periods of time as a major biological/cultural frontier that separated the anatomically modern humans in the [[Franco-Cantabrian region]] to the north from the rest of the Iberian peninsula which is occupied by Neandertals for several thousand years longer. As modern humans settled in the northern territories from around 40,000 years BCE, earliest evidence from the south dates to between 34,000 and 32,000 years BCE.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = https://phys.org/news/2010-03-modern-human-iberian-peninsula.html |title = When did the first 'modern' human beings appear in the Iberian Peninsula?  |author =  |date = March 15, 2010  |accessdate = December 30, 2017 |publisher = Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=″Zilh″/&gt;  The term [[Vasco-Cantabrian]] is now often used for the coastal area of the modern Basque Country and neighbouring [[Cantabria]].

===Châtelperronian culture===

Whether Homo sapiens or Neanderthal are to be attributed to the [[Châtelperronian]] (also called Lower [[Périgordian]]) culture is debated among specialists. Nonetheless there are Châtelperronian remains (deposited between 33,000 and 29,000 BCE) that were found in the Basque Country in caves such as [[Santimamiñe]] (Biscay), [[Labeko Koba]], Ekain (Gipuzkoa), [[Isturitz]] (Lower Navarre) and Gatzarria ([[Soule]]) as well as the open-air site of Le Basté (Labourd).

===Aurignacian culture===

Artefacts of the [[Aurignacian]] culture, in particular ''Proto-Aurignacian'' objects have been found in Gatzarria and Labeko Koba.

The ''Aurignacian II'' is found in a few sites in Labourd: Le Basté and Bidart.

The ''Evolved Aurignacian'' is found mainly in Biscay and Gipuzkoa, at the sites of [[Lezetxiki]], Aiztbitaterte IV, Koskobilo, [[Benta Laperra]], Kurtzia and Lumentxa.

===Gravettian culture===

The [[Gravettian]] period (also known as [[Périgordian]]) according to the classical French sequence, assimilates Chatelperronian and Gravettian in one single cultural complex.

Most of the findings belong to the upper and final Périgordian (V and VI): Santimamiñe, Atxurra, Bolinkoba, Amalda, Aitzbitarte III, Lezia, Isturitz and Gatzarria. The final phase of Périgordian VII is only found in Amalda (Gipuzkoa).

===Solutrean culture===
[[File:Solutrean tools 22000 17000 Crot du Charnier Solutre Pouilly Saone et Loire France.jpg|thumb|230px|Solutrean tools from Crot du Charnier Solutre Pouilly, Saone et Loire, France.]]

The [[Solutrean]] culture spans between around 18,000 to 15,000 BCE and only exists in the European south west, being coincident with the [[Last glacial maximum]], a specially dry and cold period. Studies suggest that the higher regions of the western Pyrenees and massifs of the eastern Cantabrian Cordillera were only sparsely populated as glaciers descended to very low elevations and maximum sea level regression exposed another {{convert|5 |to|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the surrounding continental shelf. In fact Human population seems to have increased in these areas of Cantabria/Asturias, the result of a gradual influx of people, forced to abandon territories
in north-western Europe that have become off limits due to maximum glacial conditions. ″The Solutrean represents technological developments in weaponry, presumably for increased efficiency and effectiveness in hunting in the face of worsening environmental conditions and increased regional human population density. In the Basque Country, Solutrean points were added onto an extant lithic technology usually characterizable as Gravettian with Noailles burins.″&lt;ref name="Solutrian"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aranzadi.eus/fileadmin/docs/Munibe/1990033040AA.pdf |title = Human occupation of Euskalerria during the Last Glacial Maximum: the Basque Solutrean |author = Lawrence Guy STRAUS |date =  |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |publisher = Aranzadi - Zientzia Elkartea · Society of Sciences · Sociedad de Ciencias · Societé de Sciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Basque Solutrean facies is intermediate between the Cantabrian and Pyrenean ones and is found specially in Aitzbitarte IV, Bolinkoba, Santimamiñe, Koskobilo, Isturitz, Hareguy, Ermittia and Amalda.&lt;ref name="Solutrian"/&gt;&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aranzadi.eus/fileadmin/docs/Munibe/2004061078AA.pdf |title = Postglacial Coast &amp; Inland: The Epipaleolithic-Mesolithic-Neolithic Transitions in the Vasco-Cantabrian Region   |author =    |date =December 12, 2002  |accessdate = December 31, 2017 |publisher = S. C. Aranzadi. Z. E. Donostia/San Sebastián }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magdalenian culture===
The [[Magdalenian]] culture can be found between around 15,000 and 8500 BCE and is widespread in Western - and later, Central Europe. Modern humans recolonize territories lost during the [[Last Glacial Maximum]] (LGM) and push into northern Europe for the first time, coming from the comparatively warmer Franco-Cantabrian region, where the [[Magdalenian]] originated.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url =http://leseyzies-tourist.info/the-magdalenian |title =  History of the Magdalenian | publisher = Les Eyzies Tourist | accessdate = December 29, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magdelenian culture and its characteristic fine art is widespread in the Basque Country. Some of the most representative sites are Santimamiñe, Lumentxa, Aitzbitarte IV, urtiaga, Ermittia, Erralla, Ekain and Berroberria. Researchers have argued, that the original Basque people have their genetic and ethnic origins in the Magdalenian paleo-human population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://aboutbasquecountry.eus/en/2016/10/15/the-discovery-of-prehistory-etchings-in-armintxe-has-become-a-global-headline/ |title = The discovery of prehistory etchings in Armintxe has become a global headline |author = John R.

===Paleolithic art===
[[Image:Franco-Cantabrian region.gif|thumb|300px|Map of the Franco-Cantabrian region, showing the main sites of cave art (red dots).]]

The oldest expression of [[Cave painting|cave art]] in the Basque country could be in Venta La Perra (Biscay) showing animals like bear and bison, as well as abstract signs.

Nevertheless, most of the artistic expressions belong to the Magdalenian period. The most important sites are:
* Arenaza (Biscay): deer.
* Santimamiñe (Biscay): bison, horse, goat and deer.
* Ekain (Gipuzkoa) is one of the most outstanding, with 33 horses dominating the gallery. Also has bisons, deers, goats, fish, bears and some abstract signs.
* Altxerri (Gipuzkoa): bison, [[aurochs]], goat, ibex, reindeer, deer, horse, carnivores, birds, fish and a serpent-like drawing.
* Isturitz (Low Navarre): dominated again by the horse, also includes bison, deer, goat, reindeer, a feline and negative hand impressions.

Additionally 13 sites have yielded portable art, being most notable that of Isturitz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://blog.nationalgeographic.org/2011/05/13/prehistoric-cave-art-discovered-in-basque-country/ |title = Prehistoric Cave Art Discovered in Basque Country |author = Andrew Howley |date = May 13, 2011 |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |publisher = National Geographic Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.basquecountrymagazine.com/en/prehistory |title = PREHISTORY |author = |date =  |accessdate = December 29, 2017 |publisher = BASQUE COUNTRY MAGAZINE }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epipaleolithic==
[[Image:Magdalenian and Azilian in the Basque Country.gif|thumb|250px|Main Magdalenian and Azilian sites in the Basque Country]]

In the [[Epipaleolithic]] period, as the [[Last glacial period|Last Ice Age]] came to an end, Magdalenian culture experienced a regionalization all around Europe, producing new localized cultural complexes. In the case of the Basque Country and the Franco-Cantabrian region as a whole, this product was [[Azilian]], that in alter period would incorporate the geometric microliths associated with [[Tardenoisian]] and related cultures.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.academia.edu/28671207/Epipalaeolithic_assemblages_in_the_Western_Ebro_Basin_Spain_The_difficult_identification_of_cultural_entities |title = Epipalaeolithic assemblages in the Western Ebro Basin (Spain): The difﬁcult identiﬁcation of cultural entities   |author = Alfonso Alday   |date =  |accessdate = December 31, 2017 |publisher = Academia Edu }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the climate improved gradually, population increased and colonized areas that before were out of reach. The regions of Araba and most of Navarre were hence colonized in this period.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00974733 |title = Epipaleolithic and Mesolithic adaptations in Cantabrian Spain and Pyrenean France   |author =   |date =  |accessdate = December 31, 2017 |publisher = Journal of World Prehistory }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period shows two phases, related to climatic conditions:
* The first one, of cold climate is largely a continuation of Magdalenian, with same sites and same hunt (deer mostly, but also bison, horse, goat, etc.).
* The second period, of warmer climate is that of the colonization of the South and the vanishing of reindeer. While deers were still the main capture, wild boar became more and more important. It also very noticeable the relevance acquired by [[seafood]], with a most noticeable case in Santimamiñe, where more than 18,000 shells have been found, fish and even terrestrial snails.

As in other post-Magdalenian areas, the disappearance of realistic cave art is quite noticeable. Instead the typical Azilian decorated pebbles have been found, as well as some geometrically decorated bones and plates. Additionally personal ornaments, made up of teeth or shells, are common as well.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web |url = https://books.google.de/books?id=W_bxBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA93&amp;lpg=PA93&amp;dq=Basque+Epipaleolithic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=626sKm_dG9&amp;sig=S0M6xtzZxOvaVL2c4cYGYOj1M0w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiYjM_wkbXYAhXRKVAKHZDZCfMQ6AEIVjAK#v=onepage&amp;q=Basque%20Epipaleolithic&amp;f=false |title = Humans at the End of the Ice Age: The Archaeology of the Pleistocene    |author =   |date =  |accessdate = December 31, 2017 |publisher = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neolithic==
[[Image:Neolithic in the Basque Country.gif|thumb|250px|Main Neolithic sites in the Basque Country]]

The [[Neolithic]] is characterized by [[agriculture]] and [[animal husbandry]]. In the Basque Country it was a late arrival, leaving its inhabitants in a [[subneolithic]] situation almost until the beginning of metallurgy in most of the territory.

The earliest evidence of contact with Neolithic peoples is in [[Zatoia]], northern Navarre, with pottery remains dated to c. 6000 BP. The first evidence of domestication appears in Marizulo (Gipuzkoa) c. 5300 BP. These innovations gradually expanded, though hunter-gathering activities remained being important.

Overall the vast majority of important Neolithic sites are placed in the southern part of the country (Ebro valley): Fuente Hoz, Peña Larga, Berniollo and La Renke in Araba; Zatoia, Abauntz, Peña, Padre Areso and [[Urbasa]] 11 in Navarre; Herriko Barra in Gipuzkoa.

In the early phases there is only evidence of domestication of dogs. In the advanced Neolithic, remains of [[ovis]] and [[Capra (genus)|capra]] are found in sites like Fuente Hoz (Araba) and Abauntz (Navarre). In the late phase, oxen and pig are found as well. Seafood gathering remained being an important source of food in the coast.

Lithic industry shows total continuity with the Epipaleolithic (geometric microliths) but some new elements, like [[sickle]]s and hand [[gristmill|mill]]s, begin to appear as well. [[Polished stone|Stone polishing]] makes in this period its first appearance, becoming more frequent at later dates.

Pottery was initially scarce, yet it became more common and variegated at the end of Neolithic (c. 3000 BCE).

Burial customs became more defined in this period, using specific burial spots like [[dolmens]], mounds or caves. A remarkable case is the massive burial site under rock of San Juan Ante Porta Latinam (Araba) that included 8,000 bone remains, belonging to at least 100 individuals.

The human type is sometimes defined as ''Western Pyrenean''.&lt;ref name="Peñalver"&gt;Xabier Peñalver, ''Euskal Herria en la Prehistoria'', 1996. {{ISBN|84-89077-58-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chalcolithic==
The [[Chalcolithic]] (''Copper and Stone'') period, also known as Eneolithic or Copper Age, lasts in the Basque Country from c. 2500 to c. 1700 BCE.

While hunting was still of some importance, especially in mountain areas, food production became finally dominant.

Lithic industry persists but some tools were already made of copper (axes, knives, etc.). Gold is also used for ornaments.

An important phenomenon in the late Chalcolithic is the [[Beaker culture|Bell Beaker phenomenon]] of pan-European extension. Also through all the period Megalithism, specially in the form of burials in dolmens, was widespread.

===Megalithism===
[[Image:Megawal31.jpg|thumb|250px|Extension of Megalithism in Europe and nearby areas]]

The Basque Country has multitude of [[megalith]]s, described as [[dolmen]]s or [[mound]]s, sometimes confusingly. They are in any case burials of collective nature, placed in spots of great visibility, often on top of mountain ridges. The materials used are always of local origin.

Dolmens are the most typical, being formed by a chamber delimited by flat stones, often quite large, covered by another stone as roof. The monument was then covered by stones and earth, making up a mound.

The chambers are of two types: simple or with corridor. The first are more common, while the latter are limited to the Ebro valley area. Dolmens are also classified by their size, normally the largest ones being in lowland areas and the smaller ones in mountain zones. This was probably a function of the number of people available to build the monument.

[[Image:Rocks Navara dolmen, Spain 02-2005 01.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Basque dolmen of Elvillar, Araba]]

The burial classified as mounds lack of chamber but were otherwise used like dolmens for collective burials. There are around 800 dolmens known in The Basque Country and c. 500 mounds, though some of these could be dolmens as well, in wait of excavation.

Only a few Basque dolmens have clear stratigraphies, due to the usage of removing older remains to make room for new burials. In spite of this difficulty, it's known that megalithic burial customs arrived to the Basque Country in the late Neolithic being very frequently used in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age, and, in the case of some mounds, as late as the Iron Age.

Other megalithic structures, such as [[standing stones]] (''menhirs'') and [[stone circles]] (''cromlechs'') seem to belong to later periods, specifically the Iron Age.

==Bronze Age==
[[Image:Chalcolithic and Early Bronze in the Basque Country.png|thumb|250px|Chalcolithic and Early-Middle Bronze Age sites in the Basque Country]]

The [[Bronze Age]] spanned from c. 1700 to c. 700 BCE. It is largely a continuity of the previous period. Gradually bronze tools replaced stone and copper ones and we can find the first fortifications, that would become very common in the last centuries of this period.

This age is divided in three subperiods:
* Early Bronze Age (c. 1700-1500 BCE): occasional use of bronze, larger pots.
* Middle Bronze Age (c. 1500-1300 BCE): generalization of bronze tools, first fortifications, first decoration of pottery (cordons).
* Late Bronze Age (c. 1300-700 BCE): bronze arrow points, variety of pottery decoration, spread of fortifications.

Megalithism continued for most of the period, yet external influences became increasingly noticeable since the Middle Bronze Age. In Araba the influence of [[Cogotas|Cogotas I]] is quite remarkable, while in the copper mine of Urbiola (Navarre) brachicephallic types, surely original from continental Europe, make up a 30% of all remains.&lt;ref name="Peñalver"/&gt;

==Iron Age==
[[Image:Late Bronze and Iron Age in the Basque Country.gif|thumb|250px|Late Bronze and Iron Age sites in the Basque Country]]

During the [[Iron Age]] in the 1st millennium BCE, with the arrival of [[Urnfield culture]] (proto-[[Celts]]) to the southern edge of the Basque Country (Ebro valley), there are some findings of iron tools and weapons. In the rest of the country it seems, from the few remains found, that the people remained in the cultural context of the [[Atlantic Bronze Age]] for some time.

Urnfield influence is limited to the Ebro valley, penetrating the Basque Country specially in Araba, where a peculiar facies of this culture, influenced as well by pre-Indo-European cultures of [[Aquitani|Aquitaine]] and the Iberian plateau (Cogotas I), exists.&lt;ref name="Jordá"&gt;F. Jordá Cerdá et al., Historia de España I: Prehistoria, 1989. {{ISBN|84-249-1015-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since c. 400 BCE, there is a noticeable [[Iberi]]an influence in the Ebro valley and central Navarre. Iron then became widespread, along with other advances such as the [[potter's wheel]] and an increase of production of cereal agriculture, that would allow for a larger population. Urbanization became more elaborated as well, with reticular street design in sites like [[La Hoya, Alava|La Hoya]] (Biasteri, Araba).

The Atlantic basin remains less developed and purely rural but there are many coincidences with the south. There are many sites, especially in the [[Northern Basque Country]], that are awaiting archaeological excavation.

The economy became more and more centered in agriculture, specially cereals, with less importance of cattle and a marginal role for hunt. There is evidence of growing importance of bovine cattle (oxen).

Burial customs also changed, with a clear dominance of [[cremation]] in the Iron Age. The treatment of the ashes varies instead with burials in [[stone circle]]s (''cromlechs''), mounds, caves, cists or urn fields.

[[Image:Harrespil Okabe.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Cromlech of Okabe, Lower Navarre]]

The individual burial in ''cromlech'' is the most aboundant but limited to the Pyrenean region, where 851 of these funerary monuments are documented. These ''cromlechs'' have diameters of 3–7 meters, with the burial located in the middle. Corpses were not cremated inside the ''cromlech'' but in a nearby spot, with only a handful of ashes being carried to the monument in fact.

Cave, cist and urn field burials were rare, the latter are only found in two sites at the Ebro valley. Cist burials, surely related to Iberian customs, have been found at La Hoya. Additionally many young children have been found bruied inside homes.

Art was mostly limited to decorative purposes, especially in pottery. Some cases of painted geometric decorations in homes, with an occasional human figure as well, have been found in the prolific sites of southern Araba (La Hoya, Alto de la Cruz). Some alleged ''idols'' and carved wooden boxes are also known of. Schematic mural painting, in caves or exposed rocky walls, dates, according to some authors, from this period as well.

On this substrate, an irregular Romanization would take place at the beginning of our age. Some towns like La Custodia ([[Viana, Spain|Biana]], Navarre) would become clearly romanized, while others not far away, like La Hoya, would retain their original native character fully.

'''''Calendar of Regrets''''' is a [[postmodern novel]] by [[Lance Olsen]], published by [[Fiction Collective Two]] in 2010.

==Plot &amp; Structure==
''Calendar of Regrets'' is a collage novel comprising twelve interconnected narratives, one for each month of the year, all pertaining to notions of travel—through time, space, narrative, and death.

The narratives involve: 1) the poisoning of the painter [[Hieronymus Bosch]]; 2) former CBS anchorman [[Dan Rather]]'s mysterious mugging on Park Avenue as he strolled home alone one evening; 3) a series of postcard meditations on the idea of travel from a young American journalist visiting Burma; 4) a high school teacher who videos her own auto-erotic asphyxiation and sends them to strangers across the U.S.;  5) a husband-and-wife team of fundamentalist Christian suicide bombers in London; 6) a terrorist commandeering a family's car on the Italian Autostrada; 7) the myth of [[Iphigenia]] from [[Agamemnon]]’s daughter’s point of view; 8) a series of pirate podcasts by a young drifter along the shores of the [[Salton Sea]] in southern California; 9) an interview between forensic psychiatrist [[Park Dietz]] and the man who assaulted Dan Rather; 10) an angel (based on the one appearing in symbolist [[Hugo Simberg]]'s famous painting titled ''[[The Wounded Angel]]'') discovered by two boys in the Finnish countryside; 11) a man built of borrowed organs, each with its own story; 12) a boy born as a notebook.

Each narrative is composed in a unique style and genre, breaks off in the middle, and is nested inside the one that preceded it. The twelfth forms the mid-point of the novel.  Each interrupted narrative then concludes. Reminiscent of [[David Mitchell (author)|David Mitchell]]'s [[Cloud Atlas (novel)|''Cloud Atlas'']], they form a mosaic, connected through a pattern of musical motifs, transposed scenes, and recurring characters. ''Calendar of Regrets'' is a narrative about narrativity itself, the human obsession with telling ourselves and our worlds over and over again in an attempt to stabilize a truth that, as [[Vladimir Nabokov]] once said, should only exist within quotation marks.

==Reception==
''Review of Contemporary Fiction'' wrote "these stories explore the perplexity about ways of knowing and how knowledge is made manifest through storytelling,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar of Regrets|url=http://www.readperiodicals.com/201104/2321643991.html|accessdate=7 December 2012|journal=Review of Contemporary Fiction|date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Rain Taxi]]'' said Olsen's novel "ultimately reminds us of the ways that art and narrative doggedly navigate that thin line between the drive for order and the deep-seated realization that the universe that greets us each morning has only increased its entropy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Calendar of Regrets|url=http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2011summer/print.shtml|accessdate=7 December 2012|journal=Rain Taxi|date=Summer 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102133249/http://www.raintaxi.com/online/2011summer/print.shtml#|archive-date=2012-11-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Casamance conflict''' is an ongoing low-level conflict that has been waged between the [[Politics of Senegal|Government of Senegal]] and the [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance]] (MFDC) since 1982. On May 1, 2014 the leader of the MFDC sued for peace and declared a unilateral ceasefire.

The MFDC has called for the independence of the [[Casamance]] region, whose population is religiously and ethnically distinct from the rest of Senegal.&lt;ref name=JuT&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucdp.uu.se/#country/433|title=Database - Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP)|publisher=Ucdp.uu.se}}{{verification needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodiest years of the conflict were during the 1992–2001 period and resulted in over a thousand battle related deaths.&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt;

On December 30, 2004 an agreement was reached between the MFDC and the government which promised to provide the voluntary integration of MFDC fighters into the country's paramilitary forces, economic recovery programmes for Casamance, de-mining and aid to returning refugees.&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt; Nevertheless, some hard-line factions of the MFDC soon defected from elements of the MFDC who had signed the agreement and no negotiations took place following the breakdown of talks in [[Foundiougne]] on 2 February 2005.&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt;

Fighting again emerged in 2010 and 2011 but waned following the April 2012 election of [[Macky Sall]]. Peace negotiations under the auspices of [[Community of Sant'Egidio|Saint Egidio community]] took place in [[Rome]] and on 14 December 2012, President Sall announced that Casamance would be a test-case for advanced decentralization policy.&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Senegal Casamance.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Casamance]] region (dark red) as part of wider [[Senegal]] ]]
The [[Casamance]] region is the southern region of Senegal which, although connected in the East to Senegal, is separated from the rest of Senegal by [[the Gambia]]. The principal inhabitants of the region are members of the [[Jola people|Jola]] ethnic group and many are [[Christians]] or [[animists]], unlike the majority of Senegalese who are [[Muslims]].&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt; The sentiment has existed amongst Diola that they do not benefit sufficiently from the region's richness and that Dakar, the capital, reaps most of the profit from the region's products.&lt;ref name=JuT/&gt;

==Timeline==

===1980s===
In the 1980s, resentment about the marginalization and exploitation of Casamance by the Senegalese central government gave rise to an independence movement in form of the MFDC, which was officially founded in 1982. This initial movement managed to unite Jola and other ethnic groups in the region, such as [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] and [[Bainuk people|Bainuk]], and led to rising popular resistance against the government and northerners. The MFDC began to organise demonstrations, and tensions eventually escalated in massive riots in December 1983. The Senegalese government answered by dividing the Casamance province into two smaller regions, probably in order to split and weaken the independence movement. This only heightened tensions, and the government began to jail MFDC leaders such as [[Augustin Diamacoune Senghor]].{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}

Another factor in the growing independence movement was the failure of the [[Senegambia Confederation]] in 1989, which had economically benefited Casamance and whose end only worsened the situation of Casamance's population.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=399}}

===1990s===
[[File:Flag of Casamance.svg|thumb|left|The [[Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance|MFDC]] and other separatist groups originally used this horizontal white-green-red tricolor as [[Casamance]]'s national flag{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=396}} ]]

The discovery of oil in the region emboldened the MFDC to organise mass demonstrations for immediate independence in 1990, which were brutally suppressed by the Senegalese military. This pushed the MFDC into armed rebellion. The following fighting was vicious, and 30,000 civilians were displaced by 1994. Several [[ceasefire]]s were agreed during the 1990s, but none lasted, often also due to splits within the MFDC along ethnic lines and between those ready negotiate and those who refused to lay down their weapons. In 1992 the MFDC divided into two main groups, Front Sud and Front Nord. Whereas Front Sud was dominated by Jola and called for full independence, Front Nord included both Jola as well as non-Jola tribesmen and was ready to work with the government based on a failed agreement of 1991.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=399, 400}} Another ceasefire in 1993 led to the break-off of hardline rebel groups from the MFDC. These continued to attack the military.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}}

The Senegalese military relocated thousands of soldiers from the northern provinces to Casamance in 1995 in an attempt to finally crush the uprising. The northern soldiers often mistreated the local population and did not differentiate between those who supported the rebels and government loyalists. By this time, the rebels had established bases in [[Guinea-Bissau]], reportedly being supplied with arms by Bissau-Guinean [[Military of Guinea-Bissau|military commander]] [[Ansumane Mané]]. Mané's alleged support for the separatists was one factor which led to the [[Guinea-Bissau Civil War]] that erupted in 1998. When Senegal decided to send its military into Guinea-Bissau to fight for the local government against Mané's forces, the latter and the MFDC formed a full alliance. The two rebel movements started to fight side by side in both Senegal as well as Guinea-Bissau.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=400}} Although the Senegal-supported government of Guinea-Bissau collapsed, the following MFDC-sympathetic regime was also overthrown in May 1999.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|pp=400, 401}}

In an renwed offensive against the separatists between April and June 1999, the Senegalese military shelled Casamance's ''de facto'' capital [[Ziguinchor]] for the first time, causing numerous civilian casualties and the displacement of 20,000 people along the Senegal–Guinea-Bissau border. From then on, fighting mostly took place in the eastern [[Kolda Region]]. Another attempt at peace talks started in December 1999, with Senegalese and MFDC representatives meeting in [[Banjul]]. Both sides agreed to a ceasefire.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=401}}

===2000s===
Peace talks resumed in January 2000, with both sides attempting to end the military conflict and aiming at restoring political and economic normality to Casamance. Discussions were held about the MFDC transforming into a political party, but the talks were hindered by the MFDC's factionalism, and the refusal of the Senegalese government to even consider Casamance's independence. As result, the peace talks collapsed in November 2000, with MFDC leader Augustin Diamacoune Senghor declaring that his group would continue to fight until achieving independence. A new ceasefire was agreed to in March 2001, but failed to stop the conflict. Meanwhile, internal divisions deepened among the MFDC about the movement's aims and Senghor's leadership.{{sfnp|Minahan|2002|p=401}}

On 30 December 2004, the two sides of the conflict signed a truce, which lasted until August 2006.&lt;ref name=Yari&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAKAR2012_a.html|title=THE 2004 TRUCE HAS ENDED|work=Wikileaks|date=21 August 2006|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the split, low-level fighting has continued in the region. Another round of negotiations took place in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4133881.stm|title=Senegal to sign Casamance accord|work=BBC|date=30 December 2004|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its results were, however, proved partial and armed clashes between MFDC factions and the army continued in 2006, prompting thousands of civilians to flee across the border to [[The Gambia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irinnews.org/news/2006/12/05/attacks-casamance-despite-peace-move|title=Attacks in Casamance despite peace move|work=Irin News|date=5 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 2 January 2006, anti-talk MFDC insurgents committed several armed robberies and killed a senior Diouloulou official.  The insurgents notoriously adopted [[Rick Derringer]]'s "Rock 'n' Roll Hoochie Koo" as an anthem of sorts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAKAR43_a.html|title=ARE HARDLINERS TRYING TO SABOTAGE THE PEACE PROCESS?|work=Wikileaks|date=6 January 2006|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2006, rebels attacked a Senegalese army outpost in Nyassia. The incident came after Guinea Bissauan troops shelled insurgent positions in Baraca Mandioca, Bazere, Koumere, Kassou and other areas, earlier in April.&lt;ref name=MoT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/06DAKAR1005_a.html|title=CHIEF REBEL STRONGER THAN ANTICIPATED|work=Wikileaks|date=26 April 2006|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 December 2006, a Senegalese army vehicle triggered a landmine in the outskirts of Sindian.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;

On 20 December 2006, rebels attacked a Senegalese army vehicle near the village of Kagnaru, killing 2 and wounding 14 soldiers.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;

The attacks came as a response to the demining process launched by  the Senegalese army without consultations with the rebels. The demining operation was led by [[Royal Moroccan Army|Moroccan army]] experts.&lt;ref name="Wikileaks" /&gt;

On 13 January 2007, [[Augustin Diamacoune Senghor]], the charismatic leader of MDFC died in [[Paris]]. His death hastened the split of the MDFC, which divided into three major armed factions, led by Salif Sadio, Caesar Badiatte, and Mamadou Niantang Diatta respectively.&lt;ref name="Boundaries"/&gt;

On 31 July 2007, one rebel was killed and one injured, after opposing factions of MDFC engaged in a skirmish outside the Bai Pol village, Gambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/07BANJUL449_a.html|title=

On 7 June 2009, MDFC gunmen killed 3 people in the area of Dailoulou.&lt;ref name=TalK&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09DAKAR948_a.html|title=WAR AND BANDITRY IN THE CASAMANCE|work=Wikileaks|date=27 July 2009|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2009, radical MDFC militants killed a former  MFDC member, who at the time was serving as a peace process mediator.&lt;ref name=TalK/&gt;

On 25 August 2009, MFDC insurgents engaged in heavy clashes with security forces in the city of [[Ziguinchor]]; the [[University of Ziguinchor]] was among the buildings damaged during the firefight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/51/5104995_-africa-senegal-ct-heaviest-fighting-in-years-hits-casamance.html|title=Heaviest fighting in years hits Casamance|work=Wikileaks|date=26 August 2009|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2009, one soldier was killed after MFDC rebels fired at an army outpost in Diabir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/51/5125079_-os-senegal-ct-soldier-killed-in-senegal-s-casamance.html|title=Soldier killed in Senegal's Casamance province |work=Wikileaks|date=4 September 2009|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 October 2009, MFDC insurgents ambushed an army vehicle in the Kolda region. The insurgents attacked the troops in the vehicle with guns and [[rocket propelled grenades]] after they became stuck on a muddy road. Seven Senegalese troops, including a captain, were killed and a further four were wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09DAKAR1261_a.html|title=CASAMANCE REBELS KILL SEVEN SENEGALESE SOLDIERS|work=Wikileaks|date=6 October 2009|accessdate=2 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, an illegal shipment of arms from [[Iran]] was seized in [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]. The Senegalese government suspected that the arms were destined for the Casamance, and recalled its ambassador to [[Tehran]] over the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-11998752|title=BBC News - Senegal recalls Tehran ambassador over arms shipment|work=BBC News|accessdate=12 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy fighting occurred in December 2010 when about 100 MDFC fighters attempted to take Bignona south of the Gambian border supported by heavy weapons, such as mortars and machine guns. They were repulsed with several casualties by Senegalese soldiers who suffered seven dead in the engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20101228-senegalese-army-sweeps-casamance-after-fight-separatists |title=Senegalese army sweeps Casamance after fight with separatists|publisher=RFI|date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2011, MFDC rebels robbed several people, on the Senoba-Ziguinchor road in northern Casamance, and later exchanged fire with soldiers outside the village of Diango.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/22/2291869_-africa-fwd-os-senegal-army-clashes-with-suspected-rebels-in.html|title=Army clashes with suspected rebels in Casamance|work=Wikileaks|date=26 August 2011|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 December 2011, Senegal media reported that 12 soldiers were killed in Senegal's Casamance region following a separatist rebel attack on an army base near the town of Bignona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/e0c16e804980f20b85999f63aa8ce1bf/12-Soldiers-killed-as-violence-in-Senegal-continues-20111221|title=12 Soldiers killed as violence in Senegal continues|publisher=Sabc.co.za|accessdate=12 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018165519/http://www.sabc.co.za/news/a/e0c16e804980f20b85999f63aa8ce1bf/12-Soldiers-killed-as-violence-in-Senegal-continues-20111221|archivedate=18 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three soldiers were killed during a clash 50 kilometers (31 mi) north of [[Ziguinchor]]. The Senegalese government blamed the conflict on separatists in the region on February 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2012/02/2012214134754565909.html|agency=Al Jazeera|date=14 February 2012|title=Senegalese troops 'killed in attack'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two attacks occurred on 11 and 23 March 2012, leaving 4 soldiers killed and 8 injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/385189/1/soldier-killed-four-wounded-in-senegal-rebel-attac.html|agency=Modern Ghana|date=23 March 2012|title=Soldier Killed, Four Wounded In Senegal Rebel Attack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 2012, peace in the Casamance has been a top priority for the administration of [[Senegalese President]] [[Macky Sall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hdcentre.org/activities/senegal/|agency=Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue|title=Activities - Senegal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 February 2013, four people were killed during a bank robbery perpetrated by the MFDC in the town of Kafoutine; the rebels stole a total of $8,400.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africajournalismtheworld.com/2013/02/03/senegal-casamance-separatist-insurgency-kills-four/|title=Casamance separatist insurgency kills four|work=Reuters|date=3 February 2013|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2014, one of the leaders of the Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance, Salif Sadio, sued for peace and declared a unilateral cease-fire after secret talks held at the Vatican between his forces and the Government of Senegal led by Macky Sall.&lt;ref name="Warsintheworld.com"/&gt;

[[Yahya Jammeh]] has been known to recruit MFDC fighters into the Gambian military, reportedly since they are more inclined to be loyal to Jammeh's regime than the people of [[the Gambia]].&lt;ref name="African Arguments 2016"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gambia: Why the army may be the key to getting Jammeh to step down | website=African Arguments | date=2016-12-16 | url=http://africanarguments.org/2016/12/16/gambia-why-the-army-may-be-the-key-to-getting-jammeh-to-step-down/ | access-date=2018-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2017 [[ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia]], MFDC rebels supported pro-Jammeh forces.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201701180043.html|title=Gambia: Jammeh 'Imports Rebels'|first=C.

'''[[Mardin]]''' was a [[diocese]] of the [[Chaldean Church]] from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. The diocese lapsed in 1941. Prior to this, it was a diocese of the [[Assyrian Church of the East]], from which the Chaldean Catholic Church originated.&lt;ref&gt;Fiey, POCN, 107–8; Tfinkdji, ''EC'', 505–11; Wilmshurst, ''EOCE'', 72–5&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Mardin old town.JPG|thumb|right|260px|The old town of Mardin]]
Fiey’s list of the [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] bishops of [[Mardin]] is derived principally from the list compiled by Tfinkdji in 1913.  Tfinkdji's treatment of the diocese of Mardin, where he was himself an Assyrian Chaldean Catholic [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]], is more than usually detailed, but although containing much valuable information is not free from error. From the middle of the eighteenth century onward, most of the Chaldean bishops of Mardin were buried in the city's church of [[Rabban Hormizd]] and the dates of their deaths were recorded in their epitaphs. These dates were used by Tfinkdji, and most of them also appear in an undated note made around the end of the nineteenth century in a manuscript in the Mardin collection, which lists the bishops of Mardin from Basil Hesro (''ob.'' 1738) to Peter Timothy {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Attar (''ob.'' 1891), giving wherever known the dates of their consecration and death. The author of the note is not known, but may have been Tfinkdji himself, despite occasional discrepancies in some of the dates given. Details of this kind, based on first-hand knowledge and personal recollection, can probably be trusted. Elsewhere, particularly for the early history of the diocese, his evidence is contradicted by other sources, and cannot be relied upon.

The Chaldean diocese of Mardin appears to have been founded in the second half of the sixteenth-century, either by [[Yohannan Sulaqa]] or (more probably) his successor [[Abdisho IV Maron|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV Maron]], after Saluqa broke from the [[Assyrian Church of the East]] in 1553 AD. Tfinkdji gave the following list of supposed bishops of Mardin from 1194 to 1512, apparently contained in an [[evangelary]] copied in 1621:  Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob of Amid (1194–1227); Isaac of Nisibis (1229–51); Marqos of Mardin (1252–75); Denha of [[Maiperqat]] (1280–1301); Quriaqos of Dunaysir [according to Tfinkdji the old name of the Mardin village of Tel Armen] (1305–17); Stephen of Mardin (1319–40); Giwargis of Resh {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïna (1345–61); Eleazar of Kfartutha (1364–75); Samuel of Edessa (1378–95); Yohannan of Seert (1397–1400); Yahballaha of Gazarta (1400–09); Yalda of Amid (1410–29); Peter of Mardin (1431–45); Sabrisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} of Gazarta (1448–68); Eliya of Mosul (1470–86); and Timothy of Hesna d'Kifa (1488–1512).

This list is of very doubtful authenticity. Firstly, although some of its names are plausible, it is surprising to find [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] bishops from the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac]] centres of Resh {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Aïna, Kfartutha and [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], and the names Eleazar and Samuel are also rarely found in the [[Assyrian Church of the East]]. Secondly, none of the bishops named is mentioned elsewhere. Finally, the list conflicts with other evidence indicating that Mardin was not a separate diocese until after the schism of 1552.

In the literary sources Mardin appears three times{{OR|date=July 2015}} in the title of the Assyrian Church of the East bishops of Maiperqat, but not as a separate diocese.  The patriarch Yahballaha II (1190–1222) was bishop 'of Maiperqat and Mardin' before becoming [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of [[Nisibis]] in 1176;  the bishop Yohannan 'of Maiperqat, [[Amid]] and Mardin' was present at the consecration of Makkikha II in 1257;  and the bishop Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}dnah of 'Maiperqat, Amid and Mardin' was present at the consecration of Denha I in 1265.   Furthermore, the dating formulas of manuscripts copied in Mardin in 1502 and 1540/1 mention the patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb and, respectively, the metropolitan Eliya of Amid and the metropolitan and ''natar kursya'' Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}. Neither [[Colophon (publishing)|colophon]] mentions a bishop of Mardin.

The metropolitan Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb of Nisibis, a supporter of Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho‘yahb and his successor [[Eliya VII]], is styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis, Mardin, Amid and all [[Armenia]]' in a colophon of 1554, and 'metropolitan of Nisibis, Mardin and Armenia' in colophons of 1558 and 1560. The earlier title may have been intended to challenge the authority of Sulaqa's metropolitan Eliya of Amid, and both styles may be evidence that Mardin was at this period loyal to Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on VII Isho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}yahb and did not yet have its own bishop.

== The Chaldean bishops of Mardin ==
[[Mardin]] was ranked as a suffragan diocese of [[Nisibis]] in the list of [[Abdisho IV Maron|{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV Maron]] in 1562, together with the dioceses of 'Tallescani' and 'Macchazin'. Presumably these were [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] villages near Mardin and Nisibis, but they have not been localised.

This reference is of some interest. The first indisputable [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] of Mardin was Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}, a native of the Mardin village of Tabyatha, who copied at least seven [[manuscripts]] between 1564 and 1586. According to Tfinkdji, he was one of the five bishops consecrated by [[Yohannan Sulaqa]] after his return from [[Rome]] in 1553 and this may well be true, though Tfinkdji's authority for this claim is not clear. Alternatively, as he is not mentioned before 1564, it is perhaps more likely that he was consecrated by Sulaqa's successor {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV Maron. He was certainly a supporter of the union with Rome, as the catholicus {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV is mentioned in the colophon of his earliest manuscript. He also copied a manuscript in the monastery of Mar Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob near [[Seert]] in 1569, the patriarchal residence of {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abdisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} IV.

Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} was one of the signatories of a letter of 1580 from the fourth Catholic patriarch Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on IX Denha to [[pope Gregory XIII]]. In 1582, he visited [[Jerusalem]], where he celebrated the [[Easter|feast of the Resurrection]] on 15 April. He completed a copy of a manuscript at Mardin on 10 December 1586, and was not among the metropolitans who witnessed the profession of faith of [[Eliya VII]] at [[Alqosh]] a fortnight later on 23 December 1586. An archbishop Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} 'of Mansuriya', probably the same man, is included in Leonard Abel's 1587 list of 'the most literate men in the Nestorian nation'.

Hnanisho{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}} may have died shortly afterwards. Thereafter, until 1615, Mardin appears to have been under the jurisdiction of Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob, metropolitan of Nisibis. Ya{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}qob is mentioned in the report of 1607 as 'metropolitan of Mardin', and in 1614 is styled 'metropolitan of Nisibis and Mardin' in a letter of Peter Strozza.

According to Tfinkdji, the next three seventeenth-century metropolitans of Mardin were Yohannan (1615–41), Joseph (1641–78), and Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Amid (1682–95). The source for some of these dates is not clear, and the evidence from the dating formulas of manuscripts is contradictory.  The title of Timothy, metropolitan of Amid between 1615 and his death in 1621/2, also included Mardin, suggesting that Yohannan's reign began in 1622 or later. The metropolitan Yohannan of Mardin, said by Tfinkdji to have died in Nisibis in 1641, is mentioned in the dating formulas of manuscripts of 1635 and 1645. The name and (presumably incorrect) reign-dates of the metropolitan Joseph were contained in a note in an [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] manuscript copied in 1679 and seen by Tfinkji in a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobite]] church.  Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Amid is said to have been consecrated by [[Joseph I (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph I]], and to have died at Mardin in 1695.

According to Tfinkdji [[Joseph III (Chaldean Patriarch)|Timothy Maroge]], who succeeded [[Joseph II (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph II]] as [[List of Chaldean Catholic Patriarchs of Babylon|patriarch of the Chaldeans]] in 1714, was metropolitan of Mardin between 1696 and 1713. According to his own account, however, which has been preserved in the [[Vatican Library|Vatican]] archives, he was metropolitan of [[Amid]], though he also ministered to the Chaldeans of Mardin.

The bishop Basil Hesro of Mardin was one of three bishops (with Basil of Amid and Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Seert) consecrated by [[Joseph III (Chaldean Patriarch)|Joseph III]] before his departure for Rome in 1731.  According to Fiey, following Tfinkdji, he was consecrated in 1714, but in the patriarch's own account the two Basils were consecrated 'one after the death of the other'. Since Basil of Amid died in 1728, Basil Hesro must have been consecrated between 1728 and 1731. He seems to have died in September 1738. In March 1739, the patriarchal administrator Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on Kemo and the clergy and people of Amid and Mardin wrote several letters to Joseph III at Rome to inform him of Basil's death and to plead for Joseph's return. These letters state that he died on 26 September 1738 and mention that he had been appointed patriarchal vicar by the [[Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples|Sacred Congregation]]. He was the first bishop of Mardin to be buried in the church of Rabban Hormizd, and according to his epitaph in the church died on 25 September 1738, a day earlier than the date given in the Vatican correspondence.  A note in a manuscript in the [[Diyarbakr]] collection gives the date of his death as 10 January 1739, probably incorrectly.

Basil Hesro was succeeded shortly after his death by the priest Yohannan of Mardin, who was consecrated by Joseph III and also took the name Basil in honour of his predecessor (Tfinkdji). He cannot have been consecrated in 1738, as Tfinkdji stated, as Joseph III only returned to Amid at the end of 1741. He is probably to be identified with the 95-year-old metropolitan of Mardin mentioned by Cardinal Tamburini at the beginning of 1757 as the sole surviving Catholic bishop in the Amid patriarchate (following the recent deaths of the patriarch Joseph III and the metropolitan Timothy Masaji of Amid).  He consecrated [[Joseph IV (Chaldean Patriarch)|La{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}zar Hindi]] metropolitan of Amid on 8 February 1857, and according to his epitaph he died shortly afterwards, on 25 February 1758.

Yohannan was succeeded by the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on of Amid, apparently consecrated by Joseph III in 1758. In 1782, he intervened to secure protection for the [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac Catholic]] patriarch [[Ignatius Michael III Jarweh|Michael III Jarweh]], who was persecuted by the [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Jacobites]] of Mardin after his conversion to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. According to his epitaph, he died on 19 November 1788.

Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}on was succeeded in 1795 by the priest Mikha'il Shawriz of Seert, the brother of the metropolitan Peter Shawriz of Seert.  According to the patriarch [[Yohannan VIII Hormizd]], whose account is quoted by the [[Anglican]] missionary [[George Percy Badger]], he was consecrated between November 1793 and 14 February 1794 in an irregular manner on the initiative of [[Augustine Hindi]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
All this time I had received no letters from Diarbekir or Mardeen, for it appears that they would not receive the orders of our lord the Pope; on the contrary, Kasha Agostîn went to Sert, where there was a presbyter named Michael. Him he took to one of the Tcawâlakha [Jilu] Metropolitans and got him consecrated Metropolitan, and set him over Mardeen without the consent of our lord the Pope.&lt;ref&gt;Badger, ''Nestorians'', i. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Because of the irregularity of his consecration, Mikha'il was excommunicated by the Vatican but was absolved by [[pope Pius VI]] in 1795 and confirmed as bishop of Mardin. Tfinkdji, followed by Fiey, gives the date of his death as 3 April 1810.

Mikha'il was succeeded by Ignatius Dashto of [[Alqosh]], a monk of the monaster of [[Alqosh#The monastery of Notre-Dame des Semences (Rabban Hormizd)|Rabban Hormizd]], who was born in 1794 and ordained a priest in 1821. According to Tfinkdji, he was consecrated by [[Augustine Hindi]] in 1824 but according to another source, he was consecrated in 1827 and died on 12 July 1868. According to Badger, he was consecrated by Augustine Hindi (who liked to style himself Mar Joseph V) along with four other monks and was sent to Mardin to embarrass [[Yohannan Hormizd]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mar Yoosef took upon himself to send Mutran Michael to Sert, and Mutran Ignatius to Mardeen, though this latter town had been placed under the jurisdiction of Mutran Hanna by the Pope himself.&lt;ref&gt;Badger, ''Nestorians'', i. 158&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ignatius Dashto was succeeded by Gabriel Farso, who was consecrated in 1870 and died on 27 June 1873. He was succeeded by Peter Timothy {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Attar, who was consecrated metropolitan of Amid in 1870 and transferred to Mardin in 1873 on Farso's premature death. He died on 1 November 1891, but seems to have been succeeded as metropolitan of Mardin some years before his death by [[Elias Mellus|Yohannan Eliya Mellus]], ''c.''1887–1908.

A number of manuscripts in the Mardin collection, some of which were later donated to the Vatican, formed part of the personal collection of the metropolitan Yohannan Eliya Mellus in the 1880s.

In 1910, Israel Audo became metropolitan of Mardin, but the 1918 [[Assyrian Genocide]] eliminated the Chaldean presence in Mardin, and the diocese was abolished after his death in 1941.

== Population ==
The modern day Chaldean population of Mardin is said to include only one family, and they hold the key to the Chaldean Catholic Church of Mardin, which is still maintained but inactive. The Church is now under the control of the [[Chaldean Catholic Archeparchy of Amida]].

===Historic censuses===
In 1842, the diocese of Mardin consisted only of the town itself, which had a church, four priests, and 60 Chaldean families (Badger).  In 1852 the diocese of Mardin and Nisibis contained 500 Chaldeans (Marchi). In 1867, the diocese contained 2 villages and had a population of 1,000 Chaldeans, served by 2 priests (Martin).

In 1896, the diocese of Mardin had 850 Chaldeans, with a parish for Mardin itself, and four stations, one of which was near Nisibis (Chabot). There were then 3 priests, assisted by a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] house in the diocese.

In 1913, the diocese of Mardin consisted of 1,670 believers, with 6 priests, a church, 2 chapels, 3 schools, and 2 mission stations (Tfinkdji). The majority lived in [[Mardin]] itself. There were also small Chaldean communities living alongside much larger groups of [[Syriac Orthodox Church|West Syriac]] and [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian]] Christians in [[Midyat]], [[Nisibis]], [[Derik]], [[Viransehir]], and the village of Tel Armen. The only significant Chaldean settlement left in the vicinity of Mardin was the village of Issadeir, several miles to the north.

In 2005 the Chaldean Catholic Church was reopened, and served 5 Chaldean families. Due to the absence of a Chaldean Catholic priest, the church is managed by a local Syriac Orthodox priest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.urmi.org/english/AncientChaldeanChurchreopenedinTurkey.Mgr.WarduniSignofunity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franz Heinrich Hieronymus Valentin Graf von Lützow''' or '''Hrabě František Lützow''' or '''Count Francis Lützow''' (21 Mar 1849 [[Hamburg]] – 13 Jan 1916 Territet, [[Vaud]], [[Switzerland]]) was a [[Bohemia]]n ([[Czech Republic|Czech]]) author, historian, critic and revivalist.

==Biography==
Hrabe František Lützow&lt;ref&gt;(alternative spellings [Ger] Count Franz Von Lützow, [Eng] Count Francis von Lutzow, [Czech] Hrabe Frantisek Lützow)&lt;/ref&gt; was the son of Franz Joseph Johann Nepomuk Gottfried von Lützow and Henriette Seymour. He was educated at [[Vienna]] and [[Innsbruck]] and followed a diplomatic career. He was active in Bohemian politics and became a member of the [[Austrian parliament]] and [[Chamberlain (office)|Chamberlain]] to the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]] from 1881.  He married Anna Gustava von Bornemann (6 Jan 1853 [[Paris]] – 18 Apr 1932 [[London]]) on 18 Jan 1881 in London. 

A tireless champion of Bohemian independence from the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], he was a member of the Royal Society of Sciences in Bohemia, and of the Bohemian Academy. 

He was [[Ilchester Lectures|Ilchester lecturer]] at Oxford (1904), and in 1912 lectured at American universities.

==Works==
Perhaps his greatest accomplishments are his various books regarding the [[Bohemia#History|history of Bohemia]], [[Prague]], Slavic poetry, [[Historiography]] and Literature.  His works were intentionally written in the English language and were thus more easily accessible to Western decision-makers who would eventually agree to the formation of an independent [[Czechoslovakia]] after the end of World War I.  The first president of Czechoslovakia, [[Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]] wrote a touching introduction to Lützow's 1939 edition of 'Bohemia, An Historical Sketch' and expressed gratitude for Lützow's various contributions to Czechoslovakia's independence.

'''''D'Alembert’s Dream''''' ( or '''The Dream of D'Alembert''', {{lang-fr|'''Le Rêve de d'Alembert'''}}) is an ensemble of three philosophical dialogues authored by [[Denis Diderot]] in 1769, which first appeared in Grimm's ''Correspondance Littéraire'' in 1782, but was not published in its own right until 1830:

* Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot
* D’Alembert’s Dream
* Continuation of the Conversation between d’Alembert and Diderot

In this work, Diderot is at the zenith of his development of [[materialism|materialist]] theories. It is here that he introduces his theory on life and nature, indicating that matter is not fixed but that, on the contrary, subject to [[evolution]]. Each species in existence transforms itself and gives birth to a new species.

He would later create a special version for his patroness, [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]] of Russia, replacing the certain character names.

Both [[Julie de Lespinasse]] and [[D’Alembert]] took poorly to being used as protagonists of the conversations.

The '''Day of ''Songun''''' ({{Korean|hangul=선군절|mr=Sŏn'gun-jŏl|context=north}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = A Tale of Two and a Half Visits: Wu Dawei, and Rodman vs. The King | first = Adam |last=Cathcart  | work = Sino-NK | date = 3 September 2013 | accessdate = 19 August 2016 | url = http://sinonk.com/2013/09/03/a-tale-of-two-and-a-half-visits-wu-dawei-and-rodman-vs-the-king/}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Public holidays in North Korea|public holiday in North Korea]] celebrated on 25 August annually to commemorate the beginning of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s ''[[Songun]]'' (military-first) leadership in 1960.

In 2013, [[Kim Jong-un]] elevated the holiday to an official status on the [[North Korean calendar]], on par with the [[Day of the Sun]] (birth anniversary of [[Kim Il-sung]]). Thus it became the holiday associated with Kim Jong-un, with his own birthday still missing from the official calendar. This has helped to further Kim Jong-un's charismatic rule.&lt;ref name="Sino-NK2013"/&gt; According to North Korea analyst Adam Cathcart,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Adam Cathcart | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 19 August 2016 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/profile/adam-cathcart}}&lt;/ref&gt; the purpose of the holiday is "to reinforce Kim Jong-un's legitimacy to rule, confirm the principle of very early succession and young leadership, and emphasize the preternatural military abilities of the sons in the Kim family."&lt;ref name="Cathcart2015"/&gt;

On the calendar, the 25 August holiday takes place after the [[National Liberation Day of Korea|Liberation Day]] (15 August) and before the [[Day of the Foundation of the Republic (North Korea)|Day of the Foundation of the Republic]] (인민정권_창건일) (9 September). Day of ''Songun'' is one of three days celebrating Kim Jong-il on the calendar, the other two being the [[Day of the Shining Star]] (his birth anniversary) and [[Generalissimo Day]] (commemorating his accession to the rank of ''[[Taewonsu]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = 2014 Calendar Reveals Few Surprises | trans-title =  | author = Cho Jong Ik  | date= 25 December 2013 | work = Daily NK | accessdate = 19 August 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=11312&amp;cataId=nk01700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
''[[Songun]]'' (military-first) is the political ideology peculiar to [[North Korea]] that all problems in society can be corrected by giving priority to military affairs. Its roots are traced to [[Kim Il-sung]]'s activities during the [[anti-Japanese struggle]] of the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoare|first=James E.|title=Historical Dictionary of Democratic People's Republic of Korea|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rh5h4bZgkhEC&amp;pg=PA352|year=2012|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham|isbn=978-0-8108-7987-4|page=352|chapter=Songun ('Army First' Policy)}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is especially identified with [[Kim Jong-il]]. Lately, ''Songun'' has been associated with [[Kim Jong-un]] in his effort balance the interests of the ruling [[Workers' Party of Korea]] and the [[Korean People's Army]] (KPA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong|first1=Charles|editor1-first=Kyung-Ae|editor1-last=Park|editor2-last=Snyder|editor2-first=Scott|title=North Korea in Transition: Politics, Economy, and Society|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JOOi64jEcakC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2013|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham|isbn=978-1-4422-1812-3|pages=5–6|chapter=The Role and Influence of Idelogy}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Fyodor Tertitskiy]], the term has largely lost its original meaning and now simply means anything "good". Consequentially, Day of ''Songun'' is not so much about the army as it is about the person of Kim Jong-il.&lt;ref name="nkne_Them"&gt;{{Cite web |title=The meaning of North Korea's "Songun Day" |last=Tertitskiy |first=Fyodor |work=NK News |date=24 August 2018 |access-date=3 September 2018 |url= https://www.nknews.org/2018/08/the-meaning-of-north-koreas-songun-day/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 2005, the history of [[Kim Jong-il]]'s ''Songun'' leadership was presented as having begun on 1 January 1995 with his visit to a guard-post. After 2005, the date was backtracked to 1960 to suggest a much longer held tradition.&lt;ref name="Moon2014"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Defectors Say Day of Songun Is No Holiday| author = Moon Eun Ju| date= 28 August 2014 | work = Daily NK | accessdate = 19 August 2016 | url = http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?num=12251&amp;cataId=nk02900}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Day of ''Songun'' commemorates his supposed 25 August 1960 inspection of the [[Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Guards 105th Tank Division]] with his father Kim Il-sung. The visit is considered the beginning of his ''Songun'' leadership. Although Jong-il would have been 18 then and not yet started his studies at [[Kim Il-sung University]],&lt;ref name="Cathcart2015"/&gt; according to, Tertitskiy, "[t]he date looks right, as it seemingly the date when Kim Jong Il made his first steps up the political ladder".&lt;ref name="nkne_Them"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Standard of the Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.svg|thumb|Military units fly the Standard of the [[Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army|Supreme Commander of the KPA]] on the day.]]

'''Dongdan Kingdom''' (926–936) (東丹, [[Khitan language]]: '''Dan Gur''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apu.ac.jp/~yoshim/dan%20gur.pdf 契丹文dan gur本義考 あわせて「東丹国」の国号を論ず]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simplified Chinese]]: 东丹, [[Korean language|Korean]]: 동란) was the [[Puppet state|puppet kingdom]] established by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] to rule the realm of the [[Balhae]] in Eastern [[Manchuria]] (now partially in North Eastern China). 

After conquering the Dan Gur (Balhae in Khitan language) in 926, the Khitan crown prince [[Prince Bei|Yelü Bei]] ascended to the throne of it at the Holhan fortress, the capital of Balhae, today's [[Mudanjiang]], [[Heilongjiang Province]]. It used Dongdan as its Chinese name, which means the east Dan Gur, in respect to the West [[Liao dynasty]].

However, political tension soon evolved between Yelü Bei and his younger brother [[Emperor Taizong of Liao|Yelü Deguang]], who took the imperial throne of Khitan after their father [[Emperor Taizu of Liao|Yelü Abaoji]] died, en route to his homeland from a relatively successful campaign against the [[Later Tang]]. The new emperor ordered his elder brother to move his capital from Huhan in Eastern Manchuria to [[Liaoyang]] in Western Manchuria.

Bei obeyed the imperial order but soon fled to North China to avoid possible assassination in 930. Bei's son was elevated to the new king of Dongdan, but the kingdom was annexed by the [[Liao Dynasty]] in 936.

To continue Balhae's friendly relations with [[Japan]], Dongdan sent a diplomatic mission over the [[Sea of Japan]] (East Sea) in 929. But the Japanese court in [[Kyoto]] rejected the mission from Dongdan, due to loyalty for the old Balhae regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/110009479720 The Kitai Dynasty’s governance of Bohai and the structure of Dongdanguo as seen from Yelu-Yuzu’s Epitaph]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early modern Europe''' is the period of [[European history]] between the end of the [[Middle Ages]] and the beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]], roughly the late 15th century to the late 18th century. Historians variously mark the beginning of the [[early modern period]] with the invention of [[moveable type]] printing in the 1450s, the [[Fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, the end of the [[Wars of the Roses]] in 1487, the beginning of the [[High Renaissance]] in Italy in the 1490s, the end of the [[Reconquista]] and subsequent [[voyages of Christopher Columbus]] to the Americas in 1492, or the start of the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1517. The precise dates of its end point also vary and are usually linked with either the start of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 or with the more vaguely defined beginning of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in late 18th century England.

Some of the more notable trends and events of the early modern period included the Reformation and the religious conflicts it provoked (including the [[French Wars of Religion]] and the [[Thirty Years' War]]), the rise of [[History of capitalism|capitalism]] and modern [[nation state]]s, widespread [[Witch trials in the early modern period|witch hunts]] and [[European colonization of the Americas]].

==Characteristics==
The early modern period was characterized by profound changes in many realms of human endeavor. Among the most important include the development of [[science]] as a formalized practice, increasingly rapid [[History of technology|technological progress]], and the establishment of [[secular]]ized civic [[politics]], [[law court]]s and the [[nation state]].  [[capitalist economy|Capitalist economies]] began to develop in a nascent form, first in the northern [[Italy|Italian]] [[republic]]s such as [[Genoa]] and [[Venice]] and in the cities of the [[Low Countries]], later in [[France]], [[Germany]] and [[England]]. The early modern period also saw the rise and dominance of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]]. As such, the early modern period is often associated with the decline and eventual disappearance (at least in [[Western Europe]]) of [[feudalism]] and [[serf]]dom.  The Protestant [[Reformation]] greatly altered the religious balance of [[Christendom]], creating a formidable new opposition to the dominance of the [[Catholic Church]], especially in [[Northern Europe]]. The early modern period also witnessed the [[circumnavigation]] of the Earth and the establishment of regular European contact with the [[Americas]] and [[South Asia|South]] and [[East Asia]]. The ensuing rise of global systems of international economic, cultural and intellectual exchange played an important role in the development of [[capitalism]] and represents the earliest phase of [[globalization]].

== Periodization ==
[[File:Europe about 1560.jpg|thumb|Europe about 1560, as in the 1923 [[William Robert Shepherd|William Shepherd]] Atlas]]
Regardless of the precise dates used to define its beginning and end points, the early modern period is generally agreed to have comprised the [[Renaissance]], the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the [[Scientific Revolution]], and the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. As such, historians have attributed a number of fundamental changes to the period, notably the increasingly rapid progress of  [[science]] and [[technology]], the [[secular]]ization of [[politics]], and the diminution of the absolute authority of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] as well as the lessening of the influence of all faiths upon national governments. Many historians have identified the early modern period as the epoch in which individuals began to think of themselves as belonging to a national polity—a notable break from medieval modes of self-identification, which had been largely based upon [[religion]] (belonging to a universal [[Christendom]]), language, or feudal allegiance (belonging to the manor or extended household of a particular [[magnate]] or [[lord]]). 

The beginning of the early modern period is not clear-cut, but is generally accepted to be in the late 15th century or early 16th century. Significant dates in this transitional phase from medieval to early modern Europe can be noted:

* 1450
: The invention of the first European [[movable type]] printing process by [[Johannes Gutenberg]], a device that fundamentally changed the circulation of information. Movable type, which allowed individual characters to be arranged to form words and which is an invention separate from the printing press, had been invented earlier in [[China]].
* 1453
: [[Fall of Constantinople|The conquest of Constantinople]] by the [[Ottomans]] signalled the end of the [[Byzantine empire]]; the [[Battle of Castillon]] concluded the [[Hundred Years' War]].
* 1485
: The last [[Plantagenet]] king of England, [[Richard III of England|Richard III]], was killed at [[Battle of Bosworth Field|Bosworth]] and the [[medieval]] civil wars of aristocratic factions gave way to early modern [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] monarchy, in the person of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]].
* 1492
: The first documented European voyage to the [[Americas]] by the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] explorer [[Christopher Columbus]]; the end of the [[Reconquista]], with the final expulsion of the [[Moors]] from the [[Iberian Peninsula]]; the Spanish government [[Alhambra Decree|expels the Jews]].
* 1494
: French king [[Charles VIII of France|Charles VIII]] invaded Italy, drastically altering the status quo and beginning a [[Italian Wars|series of wars]] which would punctuate the [[Italian Renaissance]].
* 1513
: First formulation of modern [[politics]] with the publication of [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]''.
* 1517
: The [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] begins with [[Martin Luther]] nailing his [[95 theses|ninety-five theses]] to the door of the church in [[Wittenberg]], [[Germany]].
* 1526
: [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] gains the crowns of [[Bohemia]] and [[Hungary]].
* 1545
: The [[Council of Trent]] marks the end of the medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The end date of the early modern period is variously associated with the [[Industrial Revolution]], which began in Britain in about 1750, or the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, which drastically transformed the state of [[European politics]] and ushered in the [[Napoleonic Era]] and modern Europe.

The role of nobles in the [[feudalism|Feudal System]] had yielded to the notion of the [[Divine Right of Kings]] during the [[Middle Ages]] (in fact, this consolidation of power from the land-owning nobles to the titular monarchs was one of the most prominent themes of the Middle Ages). Among the most notable political changes included the abolition of [[serfdom]] and the crystallization of kingdoms into nation-states. Perhaps even more significantly, with the advent of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the notion of [[Christendom]] as a unified political entity was destroyed. Many kings and rulers used this radical shift in the understanding of the world to further consolidate their sovereignty over their territories. For instance, many of the Germanic states (as well as [[England|English Reformation]]) converted to [[Protestantism]] in an attempt to slip out of the grasp of the [[Pope]].

The intellectual developments of the period included the creation of the economic theory of [[mercantilism]] and the publication of enduringly influential works of political and social [[philosophy]], such as [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' (1513) and [[Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1515).

==Reformation==
{{Main|Reformation}}
The Protestant Reformation was a reform-oriented [[schism]] from the [[Roman Catholic Church]] initiated by [[Martin Luther]] and continued by [[John Calvin]], [[Huldrych Zwingli]], and other early [[Protestant Reformers]]. It is typically dated from 1517, lasting until the end of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618-1648) with the [[Peace of Westphalia]] in 1648.   It was launched on 31 October 1517 by [[Martin Luther]], who posted his [[95 Theses]] criticizing the practice of indulgences to the door of the Castle Church in [[Wittenberg]], Germany, commonly used to post notices to the University community. In was very widely publicized across Europe and caught fire.  Luther began by criticizing the sale of [[indulgences]], insisting that the [[Pope]] had no authority over [[purgatory]] and that the Catholic doctrine of the [[Treasury of Merit|merits of the saints]] had no foundation in the gospel. The Protestant position, however, would come to incorporate doctrinal changes such as ''[[sola scriptura]]'' and ''[[sola fide]]''.

The Reformation ended in division and the establishment of new church movements. The four most important traditions to emerge directly from the Reformation were [[Lutheran]]ism, the [[Reformed]] (also called [[Calvinist]] or [[Presbyterian]]) tradition, [[Anglicanism]], and the [[Anabaptist]]s. Subsequent Protestant churches generally trace their roots back to these initial four schools of the Reformation. It also led to the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic or Counter Reformation]] within the Roman Catholic Church through a variety of new spiritual movements, reforms of religious communities, the founding of seminaries, the clarification of Catholic theology as well as structural changes in the institution of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth G. Appold, ''The Reformation: A Brief History'' (2011) [https://www.questia.com/library/120083934/the-reformation-a-brief-history online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest Protestant groups were the [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] and [[Calvinism|Calvinists]]. Lutheran churches were founded mostly in Germany, the Baltics and Scandinavia, while the Reformed ones were founded in Switzerland, Hungary, France, the Netherlands and Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Johnston, ''The protestant reformation in Europe'' (Routledge, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial movement within Germany diversified, and other reform impulses arose independently of Luther. The availability of the  [[printing press]] provided the means for the rapid dissemination of religious materials in the vernacular.  The core motivation behind the Reformation was [[Christian theology|theological]], though many other factors played a part, including the rise of [[nationalism]], the [[Western Schism]] that eroded faith in the [[Papacy]], the perceived corruption of the [[Roman Curia]], the impact of [[humanism]], and the new learning of the [[Renaissance]] that questioned much traditional thought.&lt;ref&gt;For a wide range of causes see G.R.  Elton, ed. ''The New Cambridge Modern History, Vol. 2: The Reformation, 1520–1559'' (1st ed. 1958) [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.111462 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also reformation movements throughout continental Europe known as the [[Radical Reformation]], which gave rise to the [[Anabaptist]], [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] and other [[Pietism|Pietistic]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;George Huntston Williams, ''The Radical Reformation'' (3rd ed, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Roman Catholic Church responded with a [[Counter-Reformation]] initiated by the [[Council of Trent]]. Much work in battling Protestantism was done by the well-organised new order of the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. In general, [[Northern Europe]], with the exception of most of [[Ireland]], came under the influence of Protestantism. [[Southern Europe]] remained Roman Catholic, while [[Central Europe]] was a site of a fierce conflict, culminating in the [[Thirty Years' War]], which left it devastated.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Wright, ''The Counter-Reformation: Catholic Europe and the Non-Christian World'' (Ashgate, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Church of England ===
{{main article|Church of England|Anglicanism}}
[[File:Workshop of Hans Holbein the Younger - Portrait of Henry VIII - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] broke England's ties with the Catholic Church, becoming the sole head of the English Church.]]
The Reformation reshaped the [[Church of England]] decisively after 1547. The separation of the [[Church of England]] (or Anglican Church) from Rome under [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], beginning in 1529 and completed in 1537, brought England alongside this broad Reformation movement; however, religious changes in the English national church proceeded more conservatively than elsewhere in Europe. Reformers in the Church of England alternated, for decades, between sympathies for ancient Catholic tradition and more Reformed principles, gradually developing, within the context of robustly Protestant doctrine, a tradition considered a middle way (''[[via media]]'') between the Roman Catholic and Protestant traditions.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Dickens, ''The English Reformation'' (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consequences of the Protestant Reformation ===
The following outcomes of the Protestant Reformation regarding [[human capital]] formation, the [[Protestant work ethic|Protestant ethic]], [[economic development]], [[governance]], and "dark" outcomes have been identified by scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Collinson, ''The Reformation: A History'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historiography ===
Margaret C. Jacob argues that there has been a dramatic shift in the historiography of the Reformation.  Until the 1960s, historians focused their attention largely on the great leaders and theologians of the 16th century, especially Luther, Calvin, and Zwingli.  Their ideas were studied in depth. However, the rise of the [[social history|new social history]] in the 1960s look at history from the bottom up, not from the top down. Historians began to concentrate on the values, beliefs and behavior of the people at large. She finds, "in contemporary scholarship, the Reformation is now seen as a vast cultural upheaval, a social and popular movement, textured and rich because of its diversity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Margaret C. Jacob|title=Living the Enlightenment: Freemasonry and Politics in Eighteenth-Century Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9y1pF-Na3UC&amp;pg=PA215|year=1991|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of Enlightenment===

The [[Age of Enlightenment]] refers to the 18th century in [[Europe|European philosophy]], and is often thought of as part of a period which includes the Age of Reason. The term also more specifically refers to a historical intellectual movement, ''The Enlightenment''. This movement advocated [[rationalism|rationality]] as a means to establish an authoritative system of [[aesthetics]], [[ethics]], and [[logic]].  The intellectual leaders of this movement regarded themselves as a courageous elite, and regarded their purpose as one of leading the world toward progress and out of a long period of doubtful [[tradition]], full of irrationality, superstition, and tyranny, which they believed began during a historical period they called the ''[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]''.  This movement also provided a framework for the [[American Revolution|American]] and [[French Revolution]]s, the Latin American independence movement, and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] [[Constitution of May 3]], and also led to the rise of [[liberalism]] and the birth of [[socialism]] and [[communism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bax, Ernest Belfort. "Gracchus Babeuf and the Conspiracy of the Equals", 1911 [http://www.marxists.org/archive/bax/1911/babeuf/index.htm], accessed June 12, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is matched by the high [[baroque]] and classical eras in music, and the [[Neoclassicism|neo-classical]] period in the arts, and receives contemporary application in the unity of science movement which includes [[logical positivism]].

==Difference between 'early modern' and the Renaissance==

The expression "early modern" is sometimes used as a substitute for the term [[Renaissance]], and vice versa. However, "Renaissance" is properly used in relation to a diverse series of cultural developments; which occurred over several hundred years in many different parts of [[Europe]]—especially central and northern [[Italy]]—and span the transition from late [[Medieval]] civilization and the opening of the early modern period.

The term early modern is most often applied to Europe, and its overseas empire.  However, it has also been employed in the history of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In the historiography of [[Japan]], the [[Edo period]] from 1590 to 1868 is also sometimes referred to as the early modern period.

== Diplomacy and warfare==

Mears, "The Emergence Of The Standing Professional Army In Seventeenth-Century Europe," ''Social Science Quarterly'' (1969) 50#1 pp. 106-115 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42858465 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   The wars were unusually ugly. Europe in the late 17th century, 1648 to 1700, was an age of great intellectual, scientific, artistic and cultural achievement.  Historian Frederick Nussbaum says it was:
:prolific in genius, in common sense, and in organizing ability.  It could properly have been expected that intelligence, comprehension and high purpose would be applied to the control of human relations in general and to the relations between states and peoples in particular. The fact was almost completely opposite.  It was a period of marked unintelligence, immorality and frivolity in the conduct of international relations, marked by wars undertaken for dimly conceived purposes, waged with the utmost brutality and conducted by reckless betrayals of allies.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick L. Nussbaum, ''The triumph of science and reason, 1660-1685'' (1953) pp 147-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The worst came during the [[Thirty Years' War]], 1618-1648, which had an extremely negative impact on the civilian population of Germany and surrounding areas, with massive loss of life and disruption of the economy and society.

=== Thirty Years' War: 1618–1648 ===
[[File:Westfaelischer Friede in Muenster (Gerard Terborch 1648).jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Treaty of Westphalia]] allowed [[Calvinism]] to be freely exercised.]]
The Reformation led to a [[European wars of religion|series of religious wars]] that culminated in the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648), which devastated much of [[Early Modern history of Germany|Germany]], killing between 25% and 40% of its entire population.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/195896/history-of-Europe/58335/Demographics#ref=ref310375 History of Europe – Demographics]". Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholic [[House of Habsburg]] and its allies fought against the Protestant princes of Germany, supported at various times by Denmark, Sweden and France. The Habsburgs, who ruled Spain, Austria, the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Crown of Bohemia]], [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], [[Slovene Lands]], the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and much of Germany and Italy, were staunch defenders of the Roman Catholic Church. Some historians believe that the era of the Reformation came to a close when Roman Catholic France allied itself with Protestant states against the Habsburg dynasty. For the first time since the days of Martin Luther, political and national convictions again outweighed religious convictions in Europe.

Two main tenets of the [[Peace of Westphalia]], which ended the Thirty Years' War, were:

* All parties would now recognise the [[Peace of Augsburg]] of 1555, by which each prince would have the right to determine the religion of his own state, the options being Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism, and now Calvinism (the principle of ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]'').
* Christians living in principalities where their denomination was ''not'' the established church were guaranteed the right to practice their faith in public during allotted hours and in private at their will.

The treaty also effectively ended the Papacy's pan-European political power. [[Pope Innocent X]] declared the treaty "null, void, invalid, iniquitous, unjust, damnable, reprobate, inane, empty of meaning and effect for all times" in his bull ''Zelo Domus Dei''. European sovereigns, Roman Catholic and Protestant alike, ignored his verdict.&lt;ref name=ODCCWestphalia&gt;Cross, (ed.) "Westphalia, Peace of" ''Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church''&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars taking a [[Realism (international relations)|"realist" perspective]] on wars and diplomacy have emphasized the [[Peace of Westphalia]] (1648) as a dividing line. It ended the [[Thirty Years War]] (1618-1648), where religion and ideology had been powerful motivating forces for warfare.   Westphalia, in the realist view, ushered in a new international system of sovereign states of roughly equal strength, dedicated not to ideology or religion but to enhance status, and territorial gains. The Catholic Church, for example, no longer devoted its energies to the very difficult task of reclaiming dioceses lost to Protestantism, but to build large-scale missions in overseas colonial possessions that could convert the natives by the thousands Using devoted members of society such as the Jesuits.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''Europe: A History'' (1996) p 593-94.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Scott Hamish, the realist model assumes that "foreign policies were guided entirely by "Realpolitik," by the resulting struggle for resources and, eventually, by the search for what became known as a 'balance of power.'&lt;ref&gt;Scott Hamish, book review in ''English Historical Review'' (Oct 2013) pp 1239-1241.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diplomacy before 1700 was not well developed, and chances to avoid wars were too often squandered.  In England, for example, King Charles II paid little attention to diplomacy, which proved disastrous.  During the Dutch war of 1665-67, England had no diplomats stationed in  Denmark or Sweden.  When King Charles realized he needed them as allies, he sent special missions that were uninformed about local political, military, and diplomatic situations, and were ignorant of personalities and political factionalism.  Ignorance produced a series of blunders that ruined their efforts to find allies.&lt;ref&gt;J.R. Jones, ''Britain and the World: 1649-1815''  (1980), pp 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; King Louis XIV of France, by contrast, developed the most sophisticated diplomatic service, with permanent ambassadors and lesser ministers in major and minor capitals, all preparing steady streams of information and advice to Paris. Diplomacy became a career that proved highly attack attractive to rich senior aristocrats who enjoyed very high society at royal courts, especially because they carried the status of the most powerful nation in Europe. Increasingly, other nations copied the French model; French became the language of diplomacy, replacing Latin.&lt;ref&gt;Gaston Zeller,  "French diplomacy and foreign policy in their European setting." in Carsten, ed., ''The New Cambridge Modern History'' vol 5 (1961) p 198-99, 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1700, the British and the Dutch, with small land armies, large navies, and large treasuries, used astute diplomacy to build alliances, subsidizing as needed land powers to fight on their side, or as in the case of the Hessians, hiring regiments of soldiers from mercenary princes in small countries.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Ingrao, ''The Hessian mercenary state: ideas, institutions, and reform under Frederick II, 1760-1785'' (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; The balance of power was very delicately calculated, so that winning a battle here was worth the slice of territory there, with no regard to the wishes of the inhabitants.  Important peacemaking conferences at Utrecht (1713), Vienna (1738), Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) and Paris (1763) had a cheerful, cynical, game-like atmosphere in which professional diplomats cashed in victories like casino chips in exchange for territory.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, ''Europe'' (1996) pp 581-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major states==
===France===
{{Further|History of France|Early Modern France|Kingdom of France|Ancien Régime}}
The [[Ancien Régime]] (French for "old regime") was the political and social system of the [[Kingdom of France]] from the about 1450 until the |[[French Revolution]] that started in  1789.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=Ancien Regime|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/modern-europe/ancient-history-middle-ages-and-feudalism/ancien-regime|work=Europe, 1450 to 1789: Encyclopedia of the Early Modern World|publisher=The Gale Group Inc.|accessdate=26 February 2017|language=en|date=2004|via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ancien Régime was ruled by the [[House of Valois|late Valois]] and [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]] dynasties.   Much of the medieval political centralization of France had been lost in the [[Hundred Years' War]], and the Valois Dynasty's attempts at re-establishing control over the scattered political centres of the country were hindered by the [[Huguenot Wars]] (or Wars of Religion). Much of the reigns of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]], [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] and the early years of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] were focused on administrative centralisation. Despite, however, the notion of "[[absolute monarchy]]" (typified by the king's right to issue [[lettre de cachet|lettres de cachet]]) and the efforts by the kings to create a centralized state, Ancien Régime France remained a country of systemic irregularities: administrative (including taxation), legal, judicial, and ecclesiastic divisions and prerogatives frequently overlapped, while the French nobility struggled to maintain their own rights in the matters of local government and justice, and powerful internal conflicts (like the [[Fronde]]) protested against this centralization.&lt;ref&gt;See William Doyle, ed. ''The Oxford Handbook of the Ancien Régime'' (2012) 656pp [https://www.amazon.com/Oxford-Handbook-Ancien-Handbooks-History/dp/0199291209/  excerpt and text search].&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for centralization in this period was directly linked to the question of royal finances and the ability to wage war. The internal conflicts and dynastic crises of the 16th and 17th centuries (the Huguenot Wars between Catholics and Protestants and the [[Habsburg]]'s internal family conflict) and the territorial expansion of France in the 17th century demanded great sums which needed to be raised through taxes, such as the land tax (''{{lang|fr|[[taille]]}}'') and the tax on salt (''{{lang|fr|[[Gabelle of salt|gabelle]]}}'') and by contributions of men and service from the nobility. Tne key to this centralization was the replacing of personal [[patronage]] systems organized around the king and other nobles by institutional systems around the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Major|1994|pp=xx–xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creation of [[intendant]]s—representatives of royal power in the provinces—did much to undermine local control by regional nobles. The same was true of the greater reliance shown by the royal court on the "noblesse de robe" as judges and royal counselors. The creation of regional [[parlement]]s had initially the same goal of facilitating the introduction of royal power into newly assimilated territories, but as the parlements gained in self-assurance, they began to be sources of disunity.&lt;ref&gt;Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie,  ''The Ancien Regime: A History of France 1610–1774'' (1999), political survey [https://www.amazon.com/dp/0631211969 excerpt and text search].&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
{{Further|Early Modern Britain|Kingdom of England|Kingdom of Scotland|Commonwealth of England|Kingdom of Great Britain}}
[[File:Elizabeth succession allegory.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Elizabeth ushers in Peace and Plenty.'''  Detail from ''The Family of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]: An Allegory of the Tudor Succession'', c. 1572, attributed to [[Lucas de Heere]].]]

This period refers to England 1558–1603. The [[Elizabethan Era]] is the period associated with the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) and was a [[golden age]] in English cultural history. It was the height of the [[English Renaissance]], and saw the flowering of [[English literature]] and [[English poetry|poetry]]. This was also the time during which [[Elizabethan theatre]] grew.  [[William Shakespeare]], among others, composed highly innovative and powerful plays. It was an age of expansion and exploration abroad. At home the [[Protestant Reformation]] was established and successfully defended against the Catholic powers of Spain and France.&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England Under the Later Tudors, 1547–1603'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Jacobean era]]'' was the reign  [[James I of England]] (1603–1625). Overseas exploration and establishment of trading factories sped up, with the first permanent settlements in North America at [[Jamestown, Virginia]] in 1607, in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] in 1610, and at [[Plymouth Colony]] in Massachusetts in 1620. One king now ruled England and Scotland; the latter was fully absorbed by the [[Acts of Union 1707]].&lt;ref&gt;Barry Coward, and Peter Gaunt. ''The Stuart Age: England, 1603-1714'' (5th ed. 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=GjElDwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;ots=EyFN0R9frj&amp;sig=-FfCepat0QB__34rWv8LxRAlOCw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false excerpt]&lt;/ref&gt;

The tumultuous [[Caroline era]] was the reign of  [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] (1625–1645), followed by his beheading by [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s regime  in 1649 . The Caroline era was dominated by the growing religious, political, and social conflict between the King and his supporters, termed the Royalist party, and the [[Puritan]] opposition that evolved in response to particular aspects of Charles' rule. The colonization of North America continued apace, with new colonies in [[Maryland]] (1634), [[Connecticut]] (1635), and [[Rhode Island]] (1636).&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Davies, ''The Early Stuarts, 1603-1660'' (Oxford UP, 1959).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gender ==

=== Spain ===
Much like the rest of Europe in the early modern period Spain followed clearly differentiated gender roles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ambiguous Gender in Early Modern Spain and Portugal: Inquisitors, Doctors and the Transgression of Gender Norms|last=Soyer|first=Francois|publisher=Brill|year=2012|isbn=9789004225299|location=Boston|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; These roles came from many places, such as biblical references, church practices, and in the case of women, manuals such as Fray Luis de León's ''La Perfecta Casada.''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biblioteca.org.ar/libros/131489.pdf|title=La Perfecta Casada|last=de Leon|first=Fray Luis|date=|website=Biblioteca Virtual Universal|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== England ===

==== Knights and Tournaments ====
Under the rule of Elizabeth, gender dynamics were altered. The masculine tournaments of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]]'s rule were "transformed into a vehicle for spectacular display and expanded the masque-like elements." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Sara Ruth|date=1935-01-01|title=An Elizabethan Tournament|jstor=458230|journal=PMLA|volume=50|issue=3|pages=920–922|doi=10.2307/458230}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was generally regarded as a show rather than an actual military practice as they were viewed under Henry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schulze|first=Ivan L.|year=1933|title=Notes on Elizabethan Chivalry and "The Faerie Queene"|jstor=4172200|journal=Studies in Philology|volume=30|pages=148–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Howard Llewellyn Swisher''' (September 21, 1870 – August 27, 1945) was an American businessperson, real estate developer, orchardist, editor, writer, and historian. As a prominent businessman, he established several companies responsible for the development of businesses and real estate in [[Morgantown, West Virginia|Morgantown]], [[West Virginia]].

Swisher was born in 1870 near [[Levels, West Virginia|Levels]], West Virginia. He became a schoolteacher there at the age of 18, then graduated from [[Fairmont State University|Fairmont State Normal School]] (present-day Fairmont State University) and [[West Virginia University]]. He then remained in Morgantown, where he established a bookstore and stationery shop. Following the success of his bookstore, Swisher organized the Main Street Building Company, the Howard L. Swisher Company, and the Morgantown Building Association, each of which constructed a large number of residences in the city. He was also the inaugural secretary-treasurer of the West Virginia Real Estate Dealers' Association.

Swisher was secretary of the Royalty Oil Company, which owned mining rights for approximately {{convert|16000|acre|km2|}} of prospective oil lands throughout the United States. In addition, he also held prominent leadership and management roles in the Valley Wood Working Company, the Monongahela Valley Posting and Distributing Plant, the Federal Savings and Trust Company, and the West Virginia Tri-Products Company. In [[Hampshire County, West Virginia|Hampshire County]], Swisher maintained fruit growing interests and served as the president of the South Branch Merchandising Company. He was an active member of the [[West Virginia Democratic Party]] and was selected as a delegate from West Virginia to the [[1936 Democratic National Convention]].

In 1897, Swisher co-authored ''History of Hampshire County, West Virginia: From Its Earliest Settlement to the Present'' with West Virginia historian [[Hu Maxwell]]. The book was the first comprehensive history of Hampshire County ever compiled. He composed a collection of poetry and short stories, ''Briar Blossoms'', in 1899, and was the editor of ''The Ghourki'', a [[Literary magazine|literary journal]] of poetry, short stories, and [[aphorism]]s. In 1908, Swisher published ''Book of Harangues'', a selection of passages from ''The Ghourki''.

Located in the historical region of [[Moldavia]], Iași has traditionally been one of the leading centres of Romanian social, cultural, academic and artistic life. The city was the capital of the [[Principality of Moldavia]] from 1564 to 1859, then of the [[United Principalities]] from 1859 to 1862, and the capital of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]] from 1916 to 1918.

Known as ''The Cultural Capital of Romania'', Iași is a symbol in Romanian history. The historian [[Nicolae Iorga]] said "There should be no Romanian who does not know of it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feaa.uaic.ro/geba/Tourism.html|title=GEBA 2017 -Tourism|first=|last=http://www.festivaprods.com|website=www.feaa.uaic.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still referred to as ''The Moldavian Capital'', Iași is the main economic and business centre of the [[Western Moldavia|Moldavian region]] of Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primaria-iasi.ro/content.aspx?item=1612&amp;lang=EN About Iași City] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715232455/http://www.primaria-iasi.ro/content.aspx?item=1612&amp;lang=EN |date=2011-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2011 census, the city proper had a population of 290,422 (making it the fourth [[Cities in Romania|most populous]] in Romania at the time). With 474,035 residents ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}), the Iași [[larger urban zone|urban area]] is the second most populous in Romania (after Bucharest),&lt;ref name="luz"/&gt; whereas more than 500,000 people live within its [[peri-urbanisation|peri-urban area]].&lt;ref name="INSSER"/&gt;&lt;ref name="periurban"&gt;{{cite web

Home to the [[University of Iași|oldest Romanian university]] and to the [[Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iași|first engineering school]], Iași is one of the most important education and research centres of the country, and accommodates over 60,000 students in 5 public universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study-in-romania.ro/historyofeducation.htm|title=Study in Romanian - Learn &amp; Live Freely|first=|last=ionut@xtra-net.ro|website=www.study-in-romania.ro|access-date=2015-07-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611181940/http://www.study-in-romania.ro/historyofeducation.htm|archive-date=2015-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pidpc"&gt;[http://www.zmi.ro/downloads/PIDPC%20IASI%201.pdf Metropolitan Area Iași] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social and cultural life revolves around the [[Iași National Theatre|Vasile Alecsandri National Theater]] (the oldest in Romania), the [[Iași "Moldova" Philharmonic Orchestra|Moldova State Philharmonic]], the [[Iaşi Romanian National Opera|Opera House]], the [[Iași Athenaeum]], a famous [[Iași Botanical Garden|Botanical Garden]] (the oldest and largest in Romania), the [[Central University Library of Iaşi|Central University Library]] (the oldest in Romania), the high quality cultural centres and festivals, an array of museums, memorial houses, religious and historical monuments. The city is also known as the site of the largest Romanian pilgrimage which takes place each year, in October.&lt;ref name="pilgrim"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/large-pilgrimage-starts-in-eastern-romania-10-09-2015|title=Romanian Pilgrims Flock to Saint's Shrine|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have different theories on the origin of the name "Iași".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/local/inceputurile-iasului-o-incursiune-in-istoria-timpurie-a-orasului~ni4i2v The beginnings of Iași] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the name originates with the [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] tribe [[Iazyges]] (of Iranian origin), one mentioned by [[Ovid]] as {{lang-la|"Ipse vides onerata ferox ut ducata '''Iasyx'''/ Per media Histri plaustra bubulcus aquas" and "'''Iazyges''' et Colchi Metereaque turba Getaque/ Danubii mediis vix prohibentur aquis"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Ovid]]|title=Ovid: Tristia Book III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qmZEAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA60|page=60|edition=2nd, rev.|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1893|editor=Sidney George Owen|origyear=c. 8 a.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other explanations show that the name originated from the Iranian [[Alans|Alanic]] tribe of '''Jassi''', having same origin with Yazyges tribes [[Jassic people]]. The Prut river was known as ''Alanus fluvius'' and the city as ''Forum Philistinorum''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandru I. Gonța, Românii și hoarda de aur, Editura Demiurg, Iași, 2010, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C.C. Giurescu, Târguri sau orașe și cetăti moldovene, București, 1967, p.242-245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gh. Ghibănescu, Originile Iașilor, în "Arhiva", Iași,1904, p.42-46&lt;/ref&gt; From this population derived the plural of town name, "Iașii".

Another historian wrote that the '''Iasians''' lived among the Cumans and that they left the Caucasus after the first Mongolian campaign in the West, settling temporarily near the Prut. He asserts that the ethnic name of Jasz which is given to Iasians by Hungarians has been erroneously identified with the Jazyges; also he shows that the word jasz is a Slavic loan word.&lt;ref&gt;A.P. Horvath, Pechenegs, Cumans, Iașians, Hereditas, Budapest, 1989, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hungarian name of the city (''Jászvásár'') literally means "Jassic Market"; the antiquated Romanian name, ''Târgul Ieșilor'' (and the once-favoured ''Iașii''), and the German ''Jassenmarkt'', may indicate the same meaning.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Iași}}
[[File:Mănăstirea Cetăţuia23.jpg|thumb|right|Coat of arms of the Principality of Moldavia at [[Cetăţuia Monastery|Cetățuia Monastery]]]]

===Ancient times===
Archaeological investigations attest to the presence of human communities on the present territory of the city and around it as far back as the prehistoric age.&lt;ref name="Mono"/&gt; Later settlements included those of the [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture]], a late [[Neolithic]] [[archaeological culture]].

There is archaeological evidence of human settlements in the area of Iași dating from the 6th to 7th centuries (Curtea Domnească) and 7th to 10th centuries; these settlements contained rectangular houses with semicircular ovens.&lt;ref&gt;C. Cihodaru, G. Platon, Istoria orașului Iași, Editura Junimea, 1980, pp 30–50&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many of the vessels (9th–11th centuries) found in Iași had a cross, potentially indicating that the inhabitants were Christians.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Gh. Teodor, Creștinismul la est de Carpați, Editura Mitopoliei Moldovei și Bucovinei, Iași, 1984, p.91,93,136&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early development===
The name of the city is first found in a document from 1408. This is a grant of certain commercial privileges by the Moldavian [[List of Moldavian rulers|Prince]] [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander]] to the Polish merchants of [[Lviv|Lvov]]. However, as buildings older than 1408 still exist, e.g. the Armenian Church believed to be originally built in 1395, it is certain that the city existed before its first surviving written mention.

===Capital of Moldavia===
Around 1564, Prince [[Alexandru Lăpuşneanu|Alexandru Lăpușneanu]] moved the Moldavian capital from [[Suceava]] to Iași. Between 1561 and 1563, a school and a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church were founded by the [[Greeks|Greek]] adventurer Prince, [[Ioan Iacob Heraclid]].
[[File:Iglesia_Trei_Ierarhi_(acabada).jpg|thumb|left|[[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (1639)]]
[[File:Iassy-1701.jpg|thumb|Iași in the 1700s]]
[[File:Princely Court of Jassy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palace of Culture (Iaşi)|Princely Court of Moldavia]]]]
In 1640, [[Vasile Lupu]] established the first school in which the Romanian language replaced Greek, and set up a printing press in the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] [[Trei Ierarhi Monastery]] (''Monastery of the [[Three Holy Hierarchs|Three Hierarchs]]''; built 1635–39). Between 15 September - 27 October 1642, the city hosted the [[Synod of Jassy]] (also referred to as the Council of Jassy). In 1643, the first volume ever printed in [[Moldavia]] was published in Iași.

The city was burned down by the [[Nogais|Tatars]] in 1513, by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1538, and by [[Imperial Russia]]n troops in 1686. In 1734, it was hit by the [[Bubonic plague|plague]].

It was through the [[Peace of Iaşi|Peace of Iași]] that the sixth [[Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792|Russo-Turkish War]] was brought to a close in 1792. A Greek revolutionary manoeuvre and occupation under [[Alexander Ypsilantis (1792–1828)|Alexander Ypsilanti]] (Αλέξανδρος Υψηλάντης) and the [[Filiki Eteria]] (Φιλική Εταιρία) (1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek War of Independence]]) led to the storming of the city by the Turks in 1822. In 1844 a severe fire affected much of the city.

===Mid–19th century to 20th century===

Between 1564 and 1859, the city was the capital of Moldavia; then, between 1859 and 1862, both Iași and [[Bucharest]] were de facto capitals of the [[United Principalities]] of Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1862, when the union of the two principalities was recognised under the name of ''Romania'', the national capital was established in Bucharest. For the loss caused to the city in 1861 by the removal of the seat of government to Bucharest the [[Constituent Assembly|constituent assembly]] voted 148,150 [[Romanian leu|lei]] to be paid in ten annual instalments, but no payment was ever made.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During [[World War I]], Iași was the capital of a much reduced Romania for two years, following the [[Central Powers]]' occupation of Bucharest on 6 December 1916. The capital was returned to Bucharest after the defeat of [[Imperial Germany]] and its allies in November 1918. In November–December 1918 Iași hosted the [[Jassy Conference]].

===Jewish community===
{{See also|History of the Jews in Romania}}
Iași also figures prominently in [[Jew]]ish history, with the first documented presence of [[Sephardi Jews]] from the late 16th century. The oldest tomb inscription in the local cemetery probably dates to 1610.&lt;ref name="yivo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Iasi|title=YIVO - Iaşi|website=www.yivoencyclopedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-19th century, owing to widespread [[History of the Jews in the Soviet Union|Russian Jewish]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|Galician Jewish]] [[immigration]] into Moldavia, the city was at least one-third Jewish.
[[File:Sinagoga Mare Iasi Dec 2015.jpg|thumb|left|[[Great Synagogue (Iaşi)|Great Synagogue]] (1671)]]

In 1855, Iași was the home of the first-ever [[Yiddish]]-language newspaper, ''Korot Haitim'', and, in 1876, the site of what was arguably the first-ever professional [[Yiddish theatre]] performance, established by [[Abraham Goldfaden|Avraham Goldfaden]]. The words of [[HaTikvah]], the national anthem of [[Israel]], were written in Iași by [[Naftali Herz Imber]]. Jewish musicians in Iași played an important role as preservers of Yiddish folklore, as performers and composers.

According to the 1930 census, with a population of 34,662 (some 34% of the city's population), Jews were the second largest ethnic group in Iași. There were over 127 [[synagogue]]s. 
After [[World War II]], in 1947, there were about 38,000 Jews living in Iași. Because of massive emigration to Israel, in 1975 there were about 3,000 Jews living in Iași and four synagogues were active.&lt;ref name="yivo"/&gt;

Currently, Iași has a dwindling Jewish population of ca. 300 to 600 members and two working synagogues, one of which, the 1671 [[Great Synagogue (Iaşi)|Great Synagogue]], is the [[Oldest synagogues in the world|oldest surviving synagogue]] in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wmf.org/project/great-synagogue-ia%C5%9Fi Great Synagogue of Iași] at wmf.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
{{Main article|Iași pogrom}}
During the war, while the full scale of [[the Holocaust]] remained generally unknown to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]], the [[Iaşi pogrom|Iași pogrom]] stood as one of the known examples of [[Axis Powers|Axis]] brutality toward the Jews.

The pogrom lasted from 29 June to 6 July 1941, and over 13,266 people,&lt;ref name="Iasipogrom"&gt;[http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0099_Iasi.html Jewishgen]&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=9&amp;art=149652 The Iași Pogrom] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518231651/http://www.rri.ro/art.shtml?lang=1&amp;sec=9&amp;art=149652 |date=2012-05-18 }} at Radio Romania International&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.zionism-israel.com/dic/iasi_pogrom.htm Iași Pogrom] quotes 13,266 or 14,850 Jews killed.&lt;/ref&gt; or one third of the Jewish population, were massacred in the pogrom itself or in its aftermath, and many were deported.

In May 1944, the Iași area became the scene of ferocious fighting between Romanian-[[Germany|German]] forces and the advancing [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Red Army]] and the city was partially destroyed. The German [[Grossdeutschland Division|Panzergrenadier Division ''Großdeutschland'']] won a defensive victory at the [[First Battle of Târgu Frumos|Battle of Târgu Frumos]], near Iași, which was the object of several [[NATO]] studies during the [[Cold War]]. By 20 August, Iași had been taken by Soviet forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziarullumina.ro/articole;1985;1;2005;0;20-august-1944-ultima-zi-de-razboi-la-Iasi.html The last day of the war in Iași]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-World War II era===
Iași experienced a major wave of industrialisation, in 1955–1975.&lt;ref name="monumente"&gt;[http://www.monumenteiasi.ro/pagina.php?v=iasi_prezentare General View-The historical and architectural Iași] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of time, it received numerous migrants from rural regions, and the urban area expanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.humangeographies.org.ro/articles/51/5_1_11_9_paftala.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Socialist Republic of Romania|socialist period]] saw a growth of 235% in population and 69% in area in Iași; however, the urban planning was sometimes arbitrary and followed by dysfunctions.&lt;ref name="Spatial Evolution Iași Stoleriu and Stoleriu"&gt;"THE SPATIAL EVOLUTION OF IAȘI CITY:
TRADITION AND TRENDS" by O. Stoleriu and C. Stoleriu&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1989, Iași had become highly industrialised, with 108,000 employees (representing 47% of the total workforce) active in 46 large [[state-owned enterprise]]s, in various industries: chemical, pharmaceutical, metallurgical, heavy equipment, electronics, textile, food, energy, building materials, furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioge.ubbcluj.ro/maegs16/volume/6%20urban%20geology%20and%20impact%20of%20geohazards.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - 6 urban geology and impact of geohazards.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508144635/http://bioge.ubbcluj.ro/maegs16/volume/6%20urban%20geology%20and%20impact%20of%20geohazards.pdf |archivedate=2015-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="industria"&gt;[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/stiri/metalurgica-tepro-sau-delphi-cum-s-a-transformat-industria-din-iasi-fata-de-1989--84145.html Studiu comparativ de caz despre industria ieșeană] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

===Topography===
{{See also|Seven hills of Iași}}
[[File:RO IS Iaşi , panoramic view 4.JPG|thumb|Panoramic view of the Copou Hill]]
Located in the North-East of Romania, at the contact between the [[Jijia Plain]] and the [[Bârlad Plateau]], Iași used to be the crossroads place of the historic trade routes that passed through Moldavia coming from the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Kingdom of Poland]], [[Habsburg Monarchy]], [[Tsardom of Russia]], and [[Constantinople]]. 

The city lies on the [[Bahlui River]] valley, a tributary of the [[Jijia River (Prut)|Jijia River]] (tributary of the [[Prut River]]). The surrounding country is one of uplands and woods, featuring monasteries and parks. Iași itself stands amid vineyards and gardens, partly on hills, partly in the in-between valley.

The central part of the city is located on the {{convert|25|m|abbr=on|lk=out}} fluvial terrace of the Bahlui River (the so called Palat Terrace).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martiniuc|first=C|date=1959|title=Harta geomorfologică a orașului Iași|url=|journal=Analele Științifice ale Universității "Al. I. Cuza" din Iași (serie nouă), secțiunea II (Științe naturale)|volume=5|pages=183-190|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this nucleus, the city evolved after the medieval times toward south and north on the Bahlui River floodplain and on the adjacent hills. The southern part of the city lies on the [[Iași Ridge]] ({{lang-ro|Coasta Iașilor}}) (the northern-most hill of the Bârlad Plateau). Considering the present day extension of the administrative boundaries, the city territory has an altitudinal extension of {{convert|320|m|abbr=on}}, between the 34.5 [[Metres above sea level|m a.s.l.]] (113.19 ft) in the Bahlui River floodplain, at the Holboca bridge, and 354.77 m a.s.l. (1,163.94 ft), at the edge of the [[Repedea Hill Fossil Site|Repedea Hill]]. 

It is a common belief that Iași is built on seven hills ({{lang-ro|coline}}): Breazu, Bucium, Cetățuia, Copou, Galata, Repedea and Șorogari, thus triggering comparisons with [[Rome]].

====Pilgrimage====
The city has become a major Christian pilgrimage site since the [[early modern period]]. In 1641, the relics of [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Saint Parascheva]] were brought to Iași. Each year, around 14 October, hundreds of thousands of pilgrims gather to commemorate Saint Parascheva, while the city itself established its Celebration Days at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curierul-Iasi.ro/iasul-istoric-pelerinaj-la-sfanta-in-iasii-de-odinioara-6872|title=Iasul istoric – Pelerinaj la Sfânta, în Iaşii de odinioară|website=curierul-iasi.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt; The October pilgrimage is one of the largest in Europe, drawing people all over Romania as well as from neighboring Orthodox countries.&lt;ref name="pilgrim"/&gt;

During the entire year, pilgrimages to Iași can also involve visits to a large number of religious sites, both within and around the city.

===Gardens, parks and natural landmarks===
[[File:Barajul Ciric II.jpg|thumb|left|Ciric Park]]
Iași has a diverse array of public spaces, from city squares to public parks.

Begun in 1833, at the time when Iași was the capital of [[Moldavia]], by Prince [[Mihail Sturdza]] and under the plans of Gheorghe Asachi and Mihail Singurov, [[Copou Park]] was integrated into the city and marks one of the first Romanian coordinated public parks. The oldest monument in Romania stands in the middle of the park, the [[Obelisk of Lions]] (1834), a {{convert|13.5|m|2|abbr=on|lk=out}} tall [[obelisk]], dedicated to the ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', the first law on political, administrative and juridical organisation in Romanian Principalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turism-iasi.ro/index.php?id=157&amp;sid=22|title=::Turism in orasul Iasi : It all started at Iasi|website=www.turism-iasi.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1856, the [[Botanical Garden of Iaşi|Botanical Garden of Iași]], the first botanical garden in Romania, has an area of over 100 hectares, and more than 10,000 species of plants.

[[Iași Exhibition Park]] was opened in 1923 and built under the co-ordination of the architect [[Ghica family|N. Ghica Budești]].

The [[Ciric Park]], located in the north-eastern part of Iași, consists of parkland and four lakes.

[[Eminescu's Linden Tree]] ({{lang-ro|Teiul lui Eminescu}}) is a 500-year-old silver lime (''Tilia tomentosa Moench'') situated in [[Copou Park]]. [[Mihai Eminescu]] reportedly wrote some of his best works underneath this lime, rendering the tree one of Romania's most important [[natural monument]]s and a notable Iași landmark.&lt;ref&gt;Pettersen, L. &amp; Baker, M. . Romania. Lonely Planet Travel Guide. p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Odd Poplers Alley]], in Bucium neighbourhood, is another spot where Mihai Eminescu sought inspiration (the poem "Down Where the Lonely Poplars Grow"). In 1973, the 15 white poplars still left (with the age ranges between 233 and 371 years) were declared natural monuments.

Iași County has 387 centuries-old trees, of which 224 were declared monument trees and 160 got the [[Romanian Academy]]'s approval and are proposed for such a classification. Most of them are oak or linden trees. The oldest tree in the county is the 675-year-old hybrid lime tree located in the courtyard of [[Bârnova Monastery]], in the vicinity of Iași. When the lime was about 57 years old and about {{convert|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} in diameter, Iași was mentioned as an urban settlement, during the reign of Prince [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]] (1408).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agerpres.ro/engleza-destinatie-romania/2014/09/04/destination-romania-iasi-the-county-of-centuries-old-trees-13-57-22|title=DESTINATION/ROMANIA: Iasi - the county of centuries-old trees|first=|last=AGERPRES|website=www.agerpres.ro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Central University Library Jan 1st 2016.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central University Library of Iași|Central University Library]]]]
The first institute of higher learning that functioned on the territory of Romania was [[Vasilian College|Academia Vasiliană]] (1640) founded by Prince [[Vasile Lupu]] as a "higher school for Latin and Slavonic languages", followed by the [[Princely Academy, Iaşi|Princely Academy]] in 1707.

The first high education structure in [[Romanian language]] was established in the autumn of 1813, when engineer [[Gheorghe Asachi]] laid the foundations of a class of engineers, its activities taking place within the [[Greek language|Greek]] Princely Academy.

After 1813, other moments marked the development of higher education in Romanian language, regarding both [[humanities]] and the technical science.

==Transport==

===Public transport===
Iași's public transportation system is served by the [[CTP Iași]] which operates an extensive network using 123 [[tram]]s (electric trams began operating in Iași in 1900) and 150 [[bus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sctpiasi.ro/despre/regie About CTP Iași] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the CTP (former RATP) carried 50,358,000 passengers, an average of 140,000 passengers per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ziaruldeiasi.ro/stiri/tot-mai-putini-ieseni-merg-cu-ratp-ul-numarul-calatoriilor-a-scazut-cu-100-000--93412.html Tot mai puțini ieșeni merg cu RATP-ul] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air===
[[File:Iaşi Airport.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iași International Airport|Iași Airport]]]]
Iași is served by the [[Iași International Airport]] (IAS) located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of the city centre. The airport is the 4th busiest in Romania and offers direct domestic, [[European Union|European]], and [[Middle East]]ern scheduled or charter connections. After extensive modernisation works, the number of connections  and traffic volumes have seen a significant increase, in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeroport.ro/comunicat-de-presa/ Aeroportul Iasi doboara un nou record propriu] {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rail===
[[File:Gara Iasi3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Iaşi railway station|Great Railway Station]]]]
Iași-[[Pașcani]] railway was opened on {{OldStyleDate|1 June|1870|20 May}}, Iași-[[Ungheni]] on 1 August 1874 and Iași-[[Chișinău]] railway was opened on 1 June 1875 by the [[Russian Empire]] in preparation for the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]].

Nowadays, three railway stations, [[Iaşi railway station|Great Railway Station]], [[Nicolina International Rail Station]] and [[Socola Rail Station]] serve the city and are operated by [[Căile Ferate Române|Romanian Railways]] (CFR). [[Calea Ferată din Moldova|Moldovan railway]] also serves these stations for travel into [[Moldova]].

The Great Railway Station, located about {{convert|1|km|1|abbr=on}} from the city centre, provides direct rail connections to all the major Romanian cities and to [[Chișinău]]. The rail stations are very well connected to all the parts of the city by the [[tram]]s and [[bus]]es of the local public transport companies.

===Road===
Iași is connected by European routes E583/[[European route E85|E85]] with [[Bucharest]] through a four lane road, by [[European route E58]] with Central Europe and [[Chișinău]] in [[Moldova]], and by [[Roads in Romania|DN National Roads]] with all major cities of Romania. A planned [[East–West Motorway (Romania)|East–West freeway]] would connect the city to the [[A3 (Romania)|A3 Transylvania Motorway]].

The Iași Coach Station is used by several private transport companies to provide [[Coach (vehicle)|coach]] connections from Iași to a large number of locations from all over the country.

==Health care==
Iași is home to at least 15  hospitals, including the [[St. Spiridon Hospital]], the second largest and one of the oldest in Romania (1755),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iasi.mednet.ro/institutii/spiridon/istoric.html St. Spiridon Hospital History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081212205650/http://www.iasi.mednet.ro/institutii/spiridon/istoric.html |date=2008-12-12 }} {{Ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Maria Clinic Children's Hospital, Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases, Regional Oncology Institute, and [[Socola Psychiatric Institute]] (1905 – first psychiatric hospital in Romania).

===Air pollution concerns===
Iași has the second-worse air quality in Romania, after [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="ro_2016-05-13"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.romaniacurata.ro/iasul-este-al-doilea-cel-mai-poluat-oras-din-romania-nu-se-pot-amenaja-noi-spatii-verzi-dar-se-cheltuie-bani-pe-studii-de-calitate-a-aerului/| title=Iaşul este al doilea cel mai poluat oraş din România. Nu se pot amenaja noi spaţii verzi, dar se cheltuie bani pe studii de calitate a aerului| newspaper=Romania Curata| date= | author=| accessdate=13 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the [[European Commission]] started environmental law [[infringement procedure]]s against Romania, citing Bucharest, Iași, and [[Brașov]] cases as examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandul.info/stiri/comisia-europeana-lanseaza-un-infringement-impotriva-romaniei-pentru-ca-nu-isi-protejeaza-cetatenii-de-poluare-13346370|title=Comisia Europeană lansează un infringement împotriva României pentru că nu îşi protejează cetăţenii de poluare|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, [[particulates|atmospheric particulate matter]] has repeatedly reached and exceeded legal thresholds for PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;. Pollution from vehicular traffic, construction works, and a lack of green spaces (the city only has about {{convert|11|sqm|abbr=on|0}} of public green spaces per capita) make up some of the reasons behind these problems.&lt;ref name="ro_2016-05-13"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9105">'''Lisan Al-Din Ibn Al-Khatib''' ({{lang-ar|لسان الدين ابن الخطيب}}) (Born 16 November 1313, [[Loja, Granada|Loja]]– died 1374, [[Fes]], [[Morocco]]; full name in {{lang-ar|محمد بن عبد الله بن سعيد بن عبد الله بن سعيد بن علي بن أحمدالسّلماني|links=no}} ''Muhammad ibn Abd Allah ibn Said ibn Ali ibn Ahmad al-Salmani'') was an [[Arab people|Arab]]&lt;ref&gt;Farhad Daftary, ''The Assassin Legends: Myths of the Isma'ilis'', (I.B.Tauris, 1994), 160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] [[polymath]]&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Knysh, ''Ibn 'Arabi in the Later Islamic Tradition'', SUNY Press (1999), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arabic poetry|poet]], [[Arabic literature|writer]], [[List of Muslim historians|historian]], [[Islamic philosophy|philosopher]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]] and [[Political aspects of Islam|politician]] from [[Emirate of Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Medieval Iberia, ed. Michael Gerli. (New York: Routledge, 2003), 416–417&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his poems decorate the walls of the palace of [[Alhambra]] in [[Granada]].
[[File:Lojafez.jpg|thumbnail|Ibn al-Khatib memorial]]
Al-Khatib was born at [[Loja, Granada|Loja]], near [[Granada]]. For much of his life he was [[vizir]] at the court of the Sultan of Granada, [[Muhammed V, Sultan of Granada|Muhammed V]].  He spent two periods in exile in the [[Marinid]] empire in [[Morocco]]; (between 1360–62, and 1371–74, he resided variously at [[Ceuta]], [[Tlemcen]] and [[Fes, Morocco|Fes]]). In 1374, he was imprisoned for '[[Zindīq|Zandaqa]]' (heresy) and atheism. He was sentenced to death by suffocation. Earlier and modern historians have speculated that his many private and political feuds in Granada with the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrid Kings of Granada]], were probably the main factors in his treatment and execution. His body was burned before being buried at "Bab Mahruq", a city gate in [[Fes]].&lt;ref&gt;Awasaf an-Nas fi Tawarikh wa Silat, pp19, Mohamed Kamal Chabana&lt;/ref&gt;

He is highly esteemed both as an historian and as a poet.  Some of his poems were put to music as ''[[muwashshah]]at''.

His great historical work, ''al-Ihata fi akhbar Gharnata'' (''The Complete Source on the History of Granada''),&lt;ref&gt;ed. Muhammad Abd Allah Inan (Cairo: Maktabat al-Khanji, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=AlIehataFeyAkhbarGernata_الإحاطة في أخبار غرناطة |url=https://archive.org/stream/AlIehataFeyAkhbarGernata01#page}}&lt;/ref&gt;  written in 1369, includes his autobiography. This work has yet to be translated into English.

==''On the Plague''==
In his treatise about the plague (Muqni'at al-Sā'il 'an al-Maraḍ al-Hā'il), (ca.753/1362),
Ibn al-Khatib explores the idea of transmission of [[infectious|disease]] through [[Contagious disease|contagion]], centuries before [[Louis Pasteur]] conducted his experiments in Europe. 
The original Arabic text is preserved in the ''Biblioteca del Real Monasterio de El Escorial'', MS Arabic 1785.&lt;ref&gt;M. W. Dols, ''The black death in the Middle East'', New Jersey, 1977, 322. M. Aguiar Aguilar, "Aproximación al léxico árabe medieval de la epidemia y de la peste", ''Medicina e Historia'' (2014) http://issuu.com/fundacionuriach/docs/m_h_2_2014_v7_r&lt;/ref&gt; Of the estimated deaths due to the outbreak of [[bubonic plague]], known as the [[Black Death]], that swept through [[al-Andalus]] in the 14th century, the numbers range to as high as a third of the Muslim population worldwide.&lt;ref name=kadri&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kadri|first1=Sadakat|title=Heaven on Earth: A Journey Through Shari'a Law from the Deserts of Ancient Arabia ...|date=2012|publisher=macmillan|isbn=9780099523277|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztCRZOhJ10wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Heaven+on+Earth:+A+Journey+Through+Shari%27a+Law&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIob7syrnZxwIVhg6SCh0fYg3Z#v=onepage&amp;q=Heaven%20on%20Earth%3A%20A%20Journey%20Through%20Shari'a%20Law&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his treatise ''On the Plague'', Ibn al-Khatib  writes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne|first=Joseph P.|title=Encyclopedia of the Black Death|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1598842536|page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The existence of contagion is established by experience  [and] by trustworthy reports on transmission by garments, vessels, ear-rings; by the spread of it by persons from one house, by infection of a healthy sea-port by an arrival from an infected land [and] by the immunity of isolated individuals."&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
While the plague [[hadith]] indicated that the Prophet suggested otherwise, &lt;blockquote&gt;"a proof taken from the traditions has to undergo modification when in manifest contradiction with the evidence of the perception of the senses."&lt;ref name=kadri/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Thomas W. and A. Guillaume,  ''Legacy of Islam'', Oxford, 1931, p.340&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Ober, William B.,  and Nabil Alloush, "[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1808550/?page=1 Plague at Granada, 1348-1349: Ibn al-Khatib and Ideas of Contagion]." ''Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine'', v.58, n.4 (1982), pp.422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This may have led to his execution by strangulation for "heresy".&lt;ref name=kadri/&gt;

'''Joan Druett''' is a New Zealand historian and novelist, specialising in [[maritime history]].

==Life==
Joan Druett was born in [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], and raised in [[Palmerston North]], moving to New Zealand's capital city, [[Wellington]], when she was 16. She gained her Bachelor of Arts in English literature from the [[Victoria University of Wellington]], and then worked as a teacher of biology and English literature for many years before publishing her first full-length book when she was 40. She travelled extensively in her 20s – including to Canada, where she lived for a while, Britain and the Middle East.

She went to America as a [[Fulbright Scholar]] in 1986, and returned there in 1992 as historian/writer for a museum exhibit, "The Sailing Circle: Seafaring Women of New York," living in [[Orient, New York|Orient]], [[Long Island]], where she and her husband, Ron, a maritime artist, were artists in residence at the William Steeple Davis Trust house and studio. While Ron painted and exhibited at galleries such as [[Mystic Seaport]] Gallery, she researched and wrote historical novels and books on maritime history. In late 1996, she and Ron returned to New Zealand, and set up house in Wellington in 1997. In 2001, she was the John David Stout Fellow at the Stout Research Centre for New Zealand Studies, Victoria University, and is still an associate.

She is married to Ron Druett and has two sons, with also six amazing grandchildren.

.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.members.authorsguild.net/druettjo/bio.htm author's website biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Ron is a well-regarded maritime artist and has illustrated many of her histories.&lt;ref name = "Dann16"&gt;Dann (2007) p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing career==
While her first novel wasn't published until she was 40 years old, Druett always wanted to write and had written professionally from her teen years.&lt;ref name = "Dann15"&gt;Dann (2007) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote science fiction stories for American magazines, and stories for a [[Māori people|Māori]] magazine using the pseudonym Jo Friday.&lt;ref name = "Dann15"/&gt; She also did some freelance travel-writing.

Her first book, ''Exotic Intruders'', was the result of a publisher's request for a book about the introduction to New Zealand of plants and animals by sailing ships. Since then she has written extensively in maritime history – particularly looking at wives at sea – and also historical and maritime novels.

In her later career, she has become best known for her Wiki novels, historical mysteries with a half-Maori seaman protagonist named Wiki Coffin. The Wiki character grew out of her research into real people, including descriptions of a Maori sailor in a midshipman's journal from the first half of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name = "Dann16"/&gt; In addition to the novels, Druett has also published several short stories featuring Wiki Coffin in ''[[Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2651">'''Joseph Ferdinand Damberger''' (1 March 1795 – 1 April 1859) was a historian of the Catholic Church.

Damberger was born in [[Passau]], Bavaria.  After completing his earlier studies in the public schools of his native town, he pursued the study of law at [[Landshut]], then studied theology at [[Salzburg]], [[Landshut]], and [[Munich]], and was ordained a priest in 1818. While at the Munich Lyceum he had also devoted himself to historical studies. Until 1837 he was particularly active as a preacher at Landshut and at St. Cajetan's, Munich. His first historical works appeared in [[Ratisbon]] in 1831, three closely related narratives: ''Fürstentafel der Staatengeschichte''; ''Fürstenbuch zur Fürstentafel der europäischen Staatengeschichte''; ''Sechzig genealogische, chronologische und statistische Tabellen zur Fürstentafel und Fürstenbuch''.&lt;ref name=CE&gt;{{Cite Catholic Encyclopedia |noicon=1 |last=Kirsch |first=J.P.|wstitle=Joseph Ferdinand Damberger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1837 he joined the [[Society of Jesus]], completed his novitiate at [[Brig-Glis|Brieg]], canton of [[Valais]], Switzerland, where he spent about ten years, partly as a mission-preacher and partly as professor of ecclesiastical history at [[Lucerne]]. A collection of his mission sermons was printed (Lucerne, 1842; 2nd ed., 1852), but was violently attacked (Missionsunfug der Jesuiten; Bern, 1842). The defeat of the [[Sonderbund]] (1847) brought with it the expulsion of the Jesuits from Switzerland. Damberger then spent several years in [[Innsbruck]] and [[Regensburg]], and in 1853 became confessor at the [[Schäftlarn Abbey|Convent of Schäftlarn]] in Bavaria, where he died.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd126176035.html#adbcontent Damberger, Joseph Ferdinand] at [[Neue Deutsche Biographie]]&lt;/ref&gt; He was working on ''Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirche und der Welt im Mittelalter'' (Ratisbon, 1850–63). The last volume was finished and published after his death by Father Daniel Rattinger. The narrative reaches the year 1378.&lt;ref&gt;[https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006135068 Synchronistische Geschichte der Kirke und der Welt] HathiTrust Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; In its day it was considered an important piece of work.&lt;ref name=CE/&gt;

==Events of the ''Kanpyō'' era==
* '''889''' (''Kanpyō 1, 10th month''):  The former-[[Emperor Yōzei]] was newly attacked by the mental illness. Yōzei would enter the palace and address courtiers he would meet with the greatest rudeness. He became increasingly furious.  He garroted women with the strings of musical instruments and then threw the bodies into a lake.  While riding on horseback, he directed his mount to run over people.  Sometimes he simply disappeared into the mountains where he chased wild boars and red deer.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA127,M1  p. 127.]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3911">'''Morton J. Horwitz''' (born 1938) is an American [[legal history|legal historian]] and [[law]] [[professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]].  The recent past [[dean (education)|dean]] of Harvard Law School, [[Elena Kagan]], relates that during her time at [[Law school in the United States|law school]], students often [[nickname]]d him as "Mort the Tort" since he taught the first-year subject [[Tort]]s.

==Career==
Horwitz obtained an [[bachelor's degree|A.B.]] from the [[City College of New York]] (1959), an [[Master's degree|A.M.]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] (1962 and 1964), and an [[Bachelor_of_Laws#Alternative_titles_and_formats|LL.B.]] from Harvard Law School (1967).

He became an Associate Professor of Law at Harvard Law School in 1970 and gained [[tenure]] as a full professor in 1974.  In 1981, he was appointed the [[Charles Warren (U.S. author)|Charles Warren]] Professor of American Legal History.

==Transformation work==
His first book, ''The Transformation of American Law, 1780-1860'', was published in 1977, and is widely regarded as one of the most important books in modern American legal [[historiography]].  It won the [[Bancroft Prize]], the preeminent prize in American history in the United States.  A product of its time, this book sought to give a "thick description" (à la [[Clifford Geertz]]) of the transformation of American law in the period, without appealing to "covering laws" (à la [[Carl Gustav Hempel]]).  The book was conceived as an attack on the so-called "Consensus School" of American Legal History, which had dominated the field of [[Legal history|Legal History]] in the 1950s and minimized the role of [[social class|class]] dimensions in American legal history.  The main argument of his book is that in the first half of the 19th century, many [[judge]]s self-consciously allied themselves with a rapidly growing class of mercantile [[capitalism|capitalists]] and promoted a series of legal rules which favored those capitalists. 

In ''The Transformation of American Law, 1870-1960: The Crisis of Legal Orthodoxy'' (1992), the sequel to his first book, Horwitz focused on the critics of the system which he described in his first book, especially [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]], [[Roscoe Pound]], and [[Karl Llewellyn]].  He frames this change in the law as a debate between "[[Legal formalism|Legal Formalists]]" and "[[Legal realism|Legal Realists]]".  He argues that in this period, the victors from his first book tried to present the current state of the law as the natural and necessary consequence of the application of the rules of [[reason]].  In their critique of Legal Formalism, the Legal Realists argued that the [[induction (philosophy)|inductive]] and [[analogy|analogical]] model applied by the Legal Formalists was logically incoherent; that all law was ultimately a [[power (sociology)|power relationship]]; and that, therefore, law was basically a form of public policy which should be decided on [[public policy]] grounds rather than by recourse to abstract categories like "[[reason]]".


In 1998, Horwitz published his third book, an [[encomium]] on the [[Earl Warren|Warren Court]] entitled ''The Warren Court and the Pursuit of Justice''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6513">'''Pierre Grimal''' (November 21, 1912 in [[Paris]] – October 11, 1996 in Paris) was a French historian, [[classicist]] and [[Latinist]].  Fascinated by the [[Greco-Roman world|Greek and Roman civilizations]], he did much to promote the cultural inheritance of the [[classical world]], both among specialists and the general public.

== Biography ==
Admitted to the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in 1933, and received third at the "[[Agrégation in France|agrégation de lettres]]" in 1935, he was member of the [[École française de Rome]] (1935-1937) then taught Latin at a [[Rennes]] lycée.  Then he was active as a professor of Roman civilization at the faculties of Caen and Bordeaux, and finally at the [[Sorbonne]] for thirty years.

He published studies on the Roman civilization, of which many volumes to the "[[Que sais-je?]]" series, and translations of Latin classical authors (Cicero, Seneca the Younger, Tacitus, Plautus, Terence).  On his retirement, he also published biographies and fictionalized histories (''Mémoires d’Agrippine'', ''le procès Néron''), more intended for the general public.

At the end of his life, he campaigned for the safeguarding of literary teaching.

'''Revolutionary Catalonia''' (July 21, 1936 – 1939) was the part of [[Catalonia]] (an autonomous region in northeast Spain) controlled by various [[anarchism|anarchist]], [[Communism|communist]], and [[socialism|socialist]] [[trade union]]s, [[Political party|parties]], and [[militia]]s of the [[Spanish Civil War]] period. Although the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] was nominally in power, the trade unions were ''de facto'' in command of most of the economy and military forces, which includes the [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT, National Confederation of Labor) which was the dominant labor union at the time and the closely associated [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI, Iberian Anarchist Federation). The [[Unión General de Trabajadores]] (General Worker's Union), the [[POUM]] and the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (which included the [[Communist Party of Catalonia]]) were also involved.

Socialist rule of the region began with the [[Spanish Revolution of 1936]], resulting in [[workers' control]] of businesses and factories, [[collective farming]] in the countryside, and attacks against [[Spanish nationalism|Spanish nationalists]] and the [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|Catholic clergy]]. The growing influence of the [[Communist Party of Spain]]'s (PCE) Popular Front government and their desire to nationalize revolutionary committees and militias brought it into conflict with the CNT and POUM, resulting in the [[May Days]] and the eventual replacement of the CNT by the PCE as the major political force in Catalonia until the arrival of the fascists.

== History ==

===Background===
{{main|Anarchism in Spain}}
In the early 20th century, the popularity of [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]] grew throughout Spain. There was widespread discontent in Catalonia, which was heavily industrialized and was a stronghold of the [[anarcho-syndicalism|anarcho-syndicalist]] trade unions. A series of strikes due to wage cuts and in response to military [[conscription]] for the [[Second Rif War]] in [[Morocco]] culminated in the [[Tragic Week (Catalonia)|Setmana Tràgica]] (Tragic Week), July 25 – August 2, 1909, in which workers rose up in revolt and were suppressed by the army. The anarcho-syndicalist [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]] (CNT) was formed in October 1910 and immediately called for a [[general strike]], which was suppressed by the military. Further strikes followed in 1917 and 1919 amidst growing violence between the police and trade unions. With the CNT outlawed, the [[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] (FAI) was formed in 1927 as a clandestine alliance of [[affinity group]]s during the dictatorship of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]]. Its radical members, who were also part of the CNT, exerted considerable influence on the other members of the trade union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spanish Civil war: Revolution and counter-revolution. |last=Bolloten |first=Burnett |authorlink=Burnett Bolloten |coauthors= |year=1991 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |location= |page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second Spanish Republic]], anarchists continued to lead uprisings such as the [[Benalup-Casas Viejas|Casas Viejas]] revolt in 1933 and the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]] which was brutally put down by [[Francisco Franco]] with the aid of Moorish troops.

===Beginning of the war===

During the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]], anarchist and socialist militias, along with Republican forces including the Assault and Civil Guards, defeated the forces controlled by Nationalist army officers in Catalonia and parts of eastern [[Aragon]]. The [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo]]-[[Federación Anarquista Ibérica]] now came to the forefront as the most powerful organization in [[Barcelona]], seizing many arms and strategic buildings such as the telephone exchange and post offices. Through the various factory and transport committees, they dominated the economy of Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=388}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of their militant [[anti-statism]], they decided not to overthrow the Catalan government. The president of the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]] and head of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC), [[Lluís Companys]], was generally accommodating with the CNT but was wary of their appropriation of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=388–389}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CNT and Companys worked together to set up the [[Central Anti-Fascist Militia Committee]], which became the main governing body in the region.

===Anarchists enter the government===
[[File:LargoCaballeroCabinetMinisters.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Caballero government ministers (November 1936). From left to right: [[:ca:Jaume Aiguader i Miró|Jaume Aguadé i Miró]] ([[Republican Left of Catalonia]]), [[Federica Montseny]] (CNT-FAI), [[Juan García Oliver]] (CNT-FAI) and [[Anastasio de Gracia]] (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party)]]

In spite of the fact that anarchist philosophy was against centralized government of any form and that the CNT-FAI had always shunned parliamentary politics while attacking the Socialists for collaborating with the state, by September 1936 they had decided to join the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]]. The CNT feared that arms would be withheld and that they would be isolated if the Generalitat under Lluís Companys formed a government with the [[Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia]] (PSUC).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p202-203}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNT members filled the Ministries of Health, Supplies and Economy and the Central Anti-Fascist Militia Committee was dissolved.

Soon after, the CNT also joined the national government. On October 18 a CNT plenary session of the regional federations granted the national committee secretary [[:es:Horacio Martínez Prieto|Horacio Martínez Prieto]] full powers to conduct negotiations with prime minister [[Francisco Largo Caballero]]. CNT representatives [[Juan García Oliver]], [[Joan Peiró]], [[Federica Montseny]] and Juan López filled seats in Caballero's cabinet. They took control of the national ministry of justice, industry, health and commerce, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CNT saw this "maximum concession compatible with its antiauthoritarian spirit" as crucial to winning the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was widespread friction and debate between the "collaborationist" and "abstentionist" anarchists in the CNT. Many anarchists outside of Spain (such as [[Alexander Schapiro]]) criticized CNT-FAI for entering into the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also concern among anarchists with the growing power of [[Marxism|Marxist]] communists within the government. Anarchist Minister of Health [[Federica Montseny]] later explained: "At that time we only saw the reality of the situation created for us: the communists in the government and ourselves outside, the manifold possibilities, and all our achievements endangered."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some anarchists outside of Spain viewed their concessions as necessary considering the possibility of the Nationalists winning the war. [[Emma Goldman]] said, "With Franco at the gate of Madrid, I could hardly blame the CNT-FAI for choosing a lesser evil: participation in government rather than dictatorship, the most deadly evil."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/goldman/addressiwa.html Address to the International Working Men's Association Congress by Emma Goldman.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936 Revolution and worker's self management===
{{main|Spanish Revolution of 1936}}
[[File:36cine capitol.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Cinema ticket from a venue run by the CNT.]]

Throughout Catalonia many sectors of the economy fell under the control of the anarchist CNT and the socialist UGT [[trade union]]s, where [[workers' self-management]] was implemented. These included railways, streetcars, buses, taxicabs, shipping, electric light and power companies, gasworks and waterworks, engineering and automobile assembly plants, mines, mills, factories, food-processing plants, theaters, newspapers, bars, hotels, restaurants, department stores, and thousands of dwellings previously owned by the upper classes.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=55}} While the CNT was the leading organization in Catalonia, it often shared power with the UGT. For example, control of the Spanish National telephone company, was put under a joint CNT-UGT committee.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=55}}

[[File:Textil.jpg|thumb|200px|right|CNT poster promoting collectivized Textiles]]

[[George Orwell]] describes the scene as he arrived in Barcelona.

{{quote|It was the first time I had ever been in a town where the working class was in the saddle. Practically every building of any size had been seized by the workers and was draped with red flags or with the red and black flag of the Anarchists; every wall was scrawled with the [[hammer and sickle]] and with the initials of the revolutionary parties; almost every church had been gutted and its images burnt. Churches here and there were being systematically demolished by gangs of workmen. Every shop and café had an inscription saying that it had been collectivised; even the bootblacks had been collectivised and their boxes painted red and black. Waiters and shop-walkers looked you in the face and treated you as an equal.|George Orwell|''[[Homage to Catalonia]], ch. I''{{sfn|Orwell|2012}}}}

Trade union control also spread to small businesses of the middle class handicraft men and tradesmen. In Barcelona, the CNT collectivized the sale of fish and eggs, slaughterhouses, milk processing and the fruit and vegetable markets, suppressing all dealers and sellers that were not part of the collective. Many retailers joined the collectives but others refused, wanting higher wages than the workers.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=57}} Throughout the region, the CNT committees replaced the middle class distributors and traders in many businesses including retailers and wholesalers, hotel, café, and bar owners, opticians and doctors, barbers and bakers.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=57}} Though the CNT tried to persuade the members of the middle class and small bourgeoisie to join the revolution, they were generally unwelcoming to the revolutionary changes wanting more than just expropriation of their businesses under force or threat of force and a worker's wage.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=60}}

Initially, the newly collectivized factories encountered various problems. CNT member Albert Pérez-Baró describes the initial economic confusion:

{{quote|After the first few days of euphoria, the workers returned to work and found themselves without responsible management. This resulted in the creation of workers' committees in factories, workshops and warehouses, which tried to resume production with all the problems that a transformation of this kind entailed. Owing to inadequate training and the sabotage of some of the technicians who remained many others had fled with the owners the workers' committees and other bodies that were improvised had to rely on the guidance of the unions.... Lacking training in economic matters, the union leaders, with more good will than success, began to issue directives that spread confusion in the factory committees and enormous chaos in production. This was aggravated by the fact that each union... gave different and often contradictory instruction.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|pp=223–224}}}}

In response to these problems, the [[Generalitat of Catalonia]], backed by the CNT approved a decree on "Collectivization and Workers' Control" on 24 October 1936. Under this decree all firms with more than 100 workers were to be collectivized and those with 100 or less could be collectivized if a majority of workers agreed.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=224}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fabregas |first=Joan P |last2=Tarradellas |first2=Josep |authorlink2=Josep Tarradellas |title=Col·lectivitzacions i Control Obrer |url=https://www.llibertat.cat/2013/11/colect-69514.jpg |date=24 October 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tarradellas |first=Josep |authorlink=Josep Tarradellas |last2=Fabregas |first2=Joan P |date=28 October 1936 |title=Diari Oficial de la Generalitat de Catalunya |url=https://www.gencat.cat/eadop/imatges/republica/1936/19360302.pdf#page=5 |pages=373–376}}&lt;/ref&gt; All collectivized enterprises were to join general industrial councils, which would be represented in a [[decentralized planning]] agency, the Economic Council of Catalonia. Representatives of the Generalitat would be appointed by the CNT to these regional councils.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|223-224}} The goal of this new form of organization would be to allow economic planning for civilian and military needs and stop the selfishness of more prosperous industries by using their profits to help others. However these plans for libertarian socialism based on trade unions was opposed by the socialists and communists who wanted a [[nationalized]] industry, as well as by unions which did not want to give up their profits to other businesses.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=225}} Another problem faced by the CNT was that while many collectivized firms were bankrupt, they refused to use the banks because the financial institutions were under the control of the socialist [[Unión General de Trabajadores|UGT]]. As a result of this, many were forced to seek government aid, appealing to Juan Peiró, the CNT minister of industry. Socialists and Communists in the government however, prevented Peiró from making any move which promoted collectivization.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=227}}

After the initial disruption, the unions soon began an overall reorganization of all trades, closing down hundreds of smaller plants and focusing on those few better equipped ones, improving working conditions. In the region of Catalonia, more than seventy foundries were closed down, and production concentrated around twenty four larger foundries.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=58}} The CNT argued that the smaller plants were less efficient and secure. In Barcelona, 905 smaller beauty shops and barbershops were closed down, their equipment and workers being focused on 212 larger shops.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=58}}

Although there were early issues with production in certain instances, however, Emma Goldman attested that industrial productivity doubled almost everywhere across the country, with agricultural yields increased "30-50%".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://libcom.org/files/Goldman%20-%20Vision%20on%20Fire%20-%20Emma%20Goldman%20on%20the%20Spanish%20Revolution.pdf|title=Vision on Fire: Emma Goldman on the Spanish Revolution|last=Goldman|first=Emma|publisher=AK Press|year=2006|isbn=978-1904859574|pages=81, 84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- possibly also Augustin Souchy, Chris Ealham, Eddie Conlon, Daniel Guerin and others, see sources --&gt;

Anarchic communes often produced more than before the collectivization. The newly liberated zones worked on entirely libertarian principles; decisions were made through councils of ordinary citizens without any sort of bureaucracy. (The CNT-FAI leadership was at this time not nearly as radical as the rank and file members responsible for these sweeping changes.)

As Eddie Conlon wrote in a publication for the Workers' Solidarity Movement:

{{quote|If you didn't want to join the collective you were given some land but only as much as you could work yourself. You were not allowed to employ workers. Not only production was affected, distribution was on the basis of what people needed. In many areas money was abolished. People come to the collective store (often churches which had been turned into warehouses) and got what was available. If there were shortages rationing would be introduced to ensure that everyone got their fair share. But it was usually the case that increased production under the new system eliminated shortages.

In agricultural terms the revolution occurred at a good time. Harvests that were gathered in and being sold off to make big profits for a few landowners were instead distributed to those in need. Doctors, bakers, barbers, etc. were given what they needed in return for their services. Where money was not abolished a 'family wage' was introduced so that payment was on the basis of need and not the number of hours worked.

Production greatly increased. Technicians and agronomists helped the peasants to make better use of the land. Modern scientific methods were introduced and in some areas yields increased by as much as 50%. There was enough to feed the collectivists and the militias in their areas. Often there was enough for exchange with other collectives in the cities for machinery. In addition food was handed over to the supply committees who looked after distribution in the urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/scw/anarchist.htm&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Another aspect of the revolution was the rise of an [[anarcha-feminism|anarcha-feminist]] women's movement, the [[Mujeres Libres]]. The organization, with 30,000 members at its disposal, set up schools to educate women and worked to persuade prostitutes to give up their way of life.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=107}} The anarcho-feminists argued that overthrow of patriarchal society was just as necessary for personal freedom, as the creation of a classless society. To demonstrate this new sexual equality, some women even fought at the front (no more than one thousand) and several more joined women's battalions in the rear.{{sfn|Beevor|2006|p=107}}

====Rural collectivization====
Just as in the cities, peasant revolutionaries seized land in the countryside and organized collective farms. According to professor Edward E. Malefakis, between half and two-thirds of all cultivated land in Republican Spain was seized. The targets were mainly small and medium landholders, since most of the large landholdings had fallen to the nationalists.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p62}}

Collectivization in the countryside generally began with the establishment of CNT-FAI committees. These committees collectivized the soil of the rich and in some cases the soil of the poor as well. Farm buildings, machinery, transport and livestock were also collectivized. Food reserves and other amenities were stored in a communal depot under committee control.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p65-66}} In many localities, the local committee issued its own inconvertible paper money; wages were paid with this money, the size of which was determined the size of the family. Locally produced goods were free if abundant, or bought at the communal storage. State issued convertible money was only used in trade with regions that had not adopted this system, and trade with other anarchist regions was done by [[barter]].{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p66}} Since the committee controlled all the money supply, travel to another region required getting permission and convertible money from the committee.

For the CNT, collectivization was a key component of the revolution, they feared that the [[smallholding|small holders]] and [[tenant farmers]] would form the core of a new landholding class and act as an obstacle to the revolution. The Anarchists also believed that private ownership of land created a [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois mentality]] and led to exploitation.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p63-64}} While the official policy of the CNT was that of peaceful voluntary collectivization and many small farmers and peasant proprietors voluntarily joined the collectives, a larger proportion of them opposed collectivization or joined only after extreme duress.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p75}} The presence of armed CNT militiamen also had the effect of imposing fear on those who opposed collectivization. Those smallholders who refused collectivization were prevented from hiring any laborers and usually were forced to sell their crops directly to the committees, on their terms. They were also often denied the services of the collectivized businesses such as the barbershops and bakeries, use of communal transport, farm equipment and food supplies from communal warehouses.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p75}} All of these economic pressures combined caused many tenant farmers and smallholders to give up their land and join the collectives.

While some joined voluntarily, others, especially in the beginning of the revolution, were forced to join the collectives by anarchist militias. The anarcho-syndicalist periodical ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]'' reported that: "Certain abuses have been committed that we consider counterproductive. We know that certain irresponsible elements have frightened the small peasants and that up to now a certain apathy has been noted in their daily labors."{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p76}}

The voluntary nature of the rural collectivization varied from region to region. According to [[Ralph Bates (writer)|Ralph Bates]]: "While there were plenty of abuses, forced collectivization, etc., there were plenty of good collectives, i.e., voluntary ones."{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=242}}

A number of scholars and writers on the subject of the Spanish Civil War counter that the presence of a "coercive climate" was an unavoidable aspect of the war that the anarchists cannot be fairly blamed for, and that the presence of deliberate coercion or direct force was minimal, as evidenced by a generally peaceful mixture of collectivists and individualist dissenters who had opted not to participate in collective organization. The latter sentiment is expressed by historian [[Antony Beevor]] in his ''Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |title=Battle for Spain the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939 |year=2006 |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |isbn=0-14-303765-X |page=295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The justification for this operation (whose 'very harsh measures' shocked even some Party members) was that since all the collectives had been established by force, [[Enrique Líster|Líster]] was merely liberating the peasants. There had undoubtedly been pressure, and no doubt force was used on some occasions in the fervor after the rising. But the very fact that every village was a mixture of collectivists and individualists shows that the peasants had not been forced into communal farming at the point of a gun.}}

Historian Graham Kelsey also maintains that the anarchist collectives were primarily maintained through libertarian principles of voluntary association and organization, and that the decision to join and participate was generally based on a rational and balanced choice made after the destabilization and effective absence of capitalism as a powerful factor in the region.&lt;ref name=Kelsey&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelsey |first=Graham |title=Anarchosyndicalism, Libertarian Communism, and the State: The CNT in Zaragoza and Aragon, 1930-1937 |year=1991 |publisher=Kluwer Academic, International Institute of Social History |location=Dordrecht |isbn=0-7923-0275-3 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Libertarian communism and agrarian collectivization were not economic terms or social principles enforced upon a hostile population by special teams of urban anarchosyndicalists, but a pattern of existence and a means of rural organization adopted from agricultural experience by rural anarchists and adopted by local committees as the single most sensible alternative to the part-feudal, part-capitalist mode of organization that had just collapsed.{{r|Kelsey}}}}

There is also focus placed by pro-anarchist analysts on the many decades of organization and shorter period of CNT-FAI agitation that was to serve as a foundation for high membership levels throughout anarchist Spain, which is often referred to as a basis for the popularity of the anarchist collectives, rather than any presence of force or coercion that allegedly compelled unwilling persons to involuntarily participate.

The disillusioned middle classes soon found allies in the Communist party which was quite moderate in comparison to the CNT, was generally against the mass collectivization of the revolution and called for the property of smallholders and tradesmen to be respected. They defended the right of the small proprietor to hire laborers and to control the sale of his crops without interference from the local committees.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p83-84}} This moderate Communist appeal to the middle classes was in line with the Comintern strategy for a popular front alliance with the liberal and republican center parties.

==== Revolutionary militias and the regular army ====
[[File:Milicianas em 1936 por Gerda Taro.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Women training for a Republican militia outside Barcelona, August 1936.]]
After the military rebellion, the Republic was left with a decimated officer corps and a severely weakened army in the regions it still controlled. Since the army was unable to resist the rebellion, the fighting mainly fell to the militia units organized by the various labor unions. While army officers joined these columns, they were under the control of whichever organization had formed them.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=250}} The militias suffered from a wide variety of problems. They were inexperienced and lacked discipline and unity of action. Rivalry between the various organizations exacerbated the lack of any centralized command and [[Staff (military)|general staff]]. The appointed professional officers were not always respected. They also lacked heavy weapons.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=254}} Militiamen would often leave the front whenever they wished. Republican officer Major Aberri said of the militiamen he encountered at the Aragon front: "It was the most natural thing in the world for them to leave the front when it was quiet. They knew nothing of discipline, and it was clear that nobody had bothered to instruct them on the subject. After a forty-hour week at the front they got bored and left it...."{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=256}}

In the initial months the ministry of war had little authority over transport and was forced to rely on the National Committee of Road Transport controlled by the CNT and UGT. The committees, unions and parties widely disregarded demands from the ministry of war and retained equipment and vehicles for themselves and their own militia forces.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=259}} In the CNT militias especially, there was no hierarchy, no saluting, no titles, uniforms or distinction in pay and quartering. They were organized into centuries with democratically elected leaders that had no permanent authority.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=261}}

While the militias had their defects, they were instrumental in holding the line at the front and their discipline slowly improved over time, [[George Orwell]] who served in the POUM explains:

{{quote|Later it became the fashion to decry the militias, and therefore to pretend that the faults which were due to lack of training and weapons were the result of the equalitarian system. Actually, a newly raised draft 'of militia was an undisciplined mob not because the officers called the private 'Comrade' but because raw troops are always an undisciplined mob. In practice the democratic 'revolutionary' type of discipline is more reliable than might be expected. In a workers' army discipline is theoretically voluntary. It is based on class-loyalty, whereas the discipline of a bourgeois conscript army is based ultimately on fear. (The Popular Army that replaced the militias was midway between the two types.) In the militias the bullying and abuse that go on in an ordinary army would never have been tolerated for a moment. The normal military punishments existed, but they were only invoked for very serious offences. When a man refused to obey an order you did not immediately get him punished; you first appealed to him in the name of comradeship. Cynical people with no experience of handling men will say instantly that this would never 'work', but as a matter of fact it does 'work' in the long run. The discipline of even the worst drafts of militia visibly improved as time went on. In January the job of keeping a dozen raw recruits up to the mark almost turned my hair grey. In May for a short while I was acting-lieutenant in command of about thirty men, English and Spanish. We had all been under fire for months, and I never had the slightest difficulty in getting an order obeyed or in getting men to volunteer for a dangerous job. 'Revolutionary' discipline depends on political consciousness--on an understanding of why orders must be obeyed; it takes time to diffuse this, but it also takes time to drill a man into an automaton on the barrack-square. The journalists who sneered at the militia-system seldom remembered that the militias had to hold the line while the Popular Army was training in the rear. And it is a tribute to the strength of 'revolutionary' discipline that the militias stayed in the field-at all.|George Orwell|''[[Homage to Catalonia]], ch. 3''}}

The most effective Anarchist unit in Catalonia was the [[Durruti Column]], led by the militant [[Buenaventura Durruti]], it fought mainly in the [[Aragon]] front. It was the only anarchist unit which managed to gain respect from otherwise fiercely hostile political opponents. In a section of her memoirs which otherwise lambasts the anarchists, Communist militant [[Dolores Ibárruri]] states, "The [Spanish Civil] war developed with minimal participation from the anarchists in its fundamental operations. One exception was Durruti...."{{sfn|Ibárruri|1984|p=382}}

The column began with 3,000 troops but at its peak, was made up of about 8,000 people. They had a difficult time getting arms from a suspicious [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]], so Durruti and his men compensated by seizing unused arms from government [[stockpile]]s. Durruti's death on November 20, 1936, weakened the Column in spirit and tactical ability; they were eventually incorporated, by decree, into the regular army. Over a quarter of the population of [[Barcelona]] attended Durruti's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.illinois.edu/Maps/scw/durruti.html About Buenaventura Durruti] by [[Peter E. Newell]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still uncertain how Durruti died. Modern historians tend to agree that it was an accident, perhaps a malfunction with his own [[gun]]. Widespread rumors at the time claimed treachery by his men. Anarchists tended to claim that he died heroically and was shot by a fascist [[sniper]].

Because of the need to create a centralized military, the Communist party was in favor of establishing a regular army and integrating the militias into this new force. They were the first party to dissolve their militia forces, including the fifth regiment, one of the most effective units in the war, and create mixed brigades, forming the core of the new Popular Army.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|pp=273–275}} These units were firmly under the oversight of Communist party [[commissar]]s and under the command of experienced army officers. The Communist party eventually came to dominate the leadership of the new army through their commissars, who used any means at their disposal, including violence and death threats, to increase party membership. Soviet army advisers and [[NKVD]] agents also exercised considerable influence within the new armed forces.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=277}}

[[File:428px-Aragon 1936.PNG|thumb|200px|left|Map of the Aragon front.]]

The [[Confederación Nacional del Trabajo|CNT]], POUM and other socialist militias initially resisted the integration. The CNT saw the militias as representing the will of the people while a centralized army was against its [[Anti-authoritarianism|anti-authoritarian principles]]. They also feared the army as an organ of the Communist party, and these fears were backed up by the historical suppression of [[Anarchism in Russia|Russian anarchists]] by the [[Bolsheviks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]].{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|pp=322–4}} However, the CNT were eventually forced to yield to militarization, since the government refused to supply and arm its militias unless they joined the regular army. The experiences of CNT leaders in the front with the badly organized militias and the examples of better structured units such as the [[International Brigades]] also made them change their minds and support the creation of a regular army.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|pp=326-7}} The CNT conducted its own militarization. Helmut Ruediger of the [[International Workers' Association]] (AIT) reported on May 1937: "There is now in the central zone a CNT army of thirty-three thousand men perfectly armed, well-organized, and with membership cards of the CNT from the first to the last man, under the control of officers also belonging to the CNT."{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=330}} Militarization was still resisted by the most radical Anarchists within the CNT-FAI who were extremely passionate about their libertarian ideals. More than any other unit, the famous and notorious [[Iron Column]] fiercely resisted militarization. Composed of anarchists from [[Valencia]] and freed convicts, the Iron Column was critical of the CNT-FAI for joining the national government and defended the militia system in their periodical Linea de Fuego.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=333}} The CNT refused to supply them with arms and in March 1937 they were incorporated into the regular army.

After the fall of the government of Francisco Largo Caballero  and the rise of the Communist party to dominance in the armed forces, the integration of the militias was accelerated and most units were coerced into joining the regular army.{{sfn|Bolloten|1991|p=488}}

===The May Events===
During the Civil War, the Spanish Communist Party gained considerable influence due to the Republican force's reliance on weapons, supplies and military advisers from the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the Communist party (now working as the dominant force within the PSUC) constantly proclaimed that it was promoting "bourgeois democracy" and was fighting in defense of the Republic, not for proletarian revolution. Opposition to [[collectivization]] and the camouflaging of the true nature of the Spanish revolution by the Communist party was mainly due to the fear that the establishment of a revolutionary socialist state would antagonize Western Democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=111–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSUC had also become the major defender of the Catalan middle classes against collectivization, organizing 18,000 tradesmen and artisans into the Catalan Federation of Small Businessmen and Manufacturers (GEPCI).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=396}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's attacks on the revolution, particularly the replacement of revolutionary committees with regular organs of state power brought it into conflict with the CNT-FAI, a major supporter of the revolutionary committees and the most powerful working class organization in Catalonia. The revolutionary Boletín de Información declared that: "The thousands of proletarian combatants at the battle fronts are not fighting for the 'democratic Republic.' They are proletarian revolutionaries, who have taken up arms in order to make the Revolution. To postpone the triumph of the latter until after we win the war would weaken considerably the fighting spirit of the working class.... The Revolution and the war are inseparable. Everything that is said to the contrary is reformist counterrevolution."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, CNT ministers in the government also acquiesced to decrees which dissolved revolutionary committees, largely because they believed this would lead to closer ties with Britain and France.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Catalan [[Generalitat]], power was divided between the CNT, PSUC and [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC). Another influential party in Barcelona was the [[POUM]] (Workers' Party of Marxist Unification) which espoused an anti-[[Stalinist]] far left ideology, and was thus denounced by the PSUC as [[Trotskyist]] and [[Fascist]]. In turn, the POUM newspaper La Batalla accused the Communists of being counterrevolutionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=405, 409}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1936 the CNT and PSUC agreed to remove the POUM from the Catalan government. This was possibly influenced by Soviet consul Vladimir A. Antonov-Ovseenko who threatened to withdraw arm shipments.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=411}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSUC now sought to weaken the CNT committees through an alliance with the urban middle classes and the rural tenant farmers in the Unió de Rabassaires. They passed a decree banning the committees, but could not effectively enforce it. This was because police power in Barcelona was divided between the CNT controlled patrols under the Junta de seguridad and the Assault and National Republican guards, under police commissioner Rodríguez Salas, a PSUC member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=416–417}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The PSUC and ERC then passed a set of decrees to dissolve the patrols and create a single unified security corps. CNT representatives in the Generalitat did not object, but there was widespread discontent among Anarchists and the POUM.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=417}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further decrees by the Generalitat which called up conscripts, dissolved military committees and provided for the integration of the militias into a regular army caused a crisis in which CNT ministers walked out of the government in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=419–420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The POUM also opposed the decrees. Tensions where only exacerbated following the well publicized murders of PSUC secretary Roldán Cortada and Anarchist committee president Antonio Martín. Armed raids and attempts by the Republican guards to disarm the Anarchists and the seizure of towns along the French border from revolutionary committees led the CNT to mobilize and arm its workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=426–428}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:GeoreOrwell.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[George Orwell]].]]

In what became known as the [[Barcelona May Days]] of 1937, fighting broke out after civil guards attempted to take over a CNT-run telephone building in Barcelona's [[Plaça de Catalunya]]. [[George Orwell]] who was in the POUM militia at the time described the events leading up to the fighting:

{{quote| The immediate cause of friction was the Government's order to surrender all private weapons, coinciding with the decision to build up a heavily-armed 'non-political' police-force from which trade union members were to be excluded. The meaning of this was obvious to everyone; and it was also obvious that the next move would be the taking over of some of the key industries controlled by the C.N.T. In addition there was a certain amount of resentment among the working classes because of the growing contrast of wealth and poverty and a general vague feeling that the revolution had been sabotaged. Many people were agreeably surprised when there was no rioting on I May. On 3 May the Government decided to take over the Telephone Exchange, which had been operated since the beginning of the war mainly by C.N.T. workers; it was alleged that it was badly run and that official calls were being tapped. Salas, the Chief of Police (who may or may not have been exceeding his orders), sent three lorry-loads of armed Civil Guards to seize the building, while the streets outside were cleared by armed police in civilian clothes. At about the same time bands of Civil Guards seized various other buildings in strategic spots. Whatever the real intention may have been, there was a widespread belief that this was the signal for a general attack on the C.N.T. by the Civil Guards and the P.S.U.C. (Communists and Socialists). The word flew round the town that the workers' buildings were being attacked, armed Anarchists appeared on the streets, work ceased, and fighting broke out immediately.|George Orwell|''[[Homage to Catalonia]], ch. 11''}}

[[File:Barcelona-Plaça de Catalunya.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Plaça de Catalunya]] (Catalonia square)]]

The Civil guards took the ground floor of the telephone building, but were prevented from taking the upper levels. Soon, trucks carrying armed anarchists arrived. CNT councilors demanded the removal of police commissioner Rodríguez Salas, but [[Lluís Companys]] refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=431}}&lt;/ref&gt; The POUM stood by the CNT and advised them to take control of the city, but the CNT appealed to the workers to cease fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=433–434}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the situation deteriorating, a meeting of CNT delegates from [[Valencia]] and the Generalitat under Companys agreed on a ceasefire and a new provisional government, but despite of this, the fighting continued. Dissenting anarchists such as the "Friends of Durruti" and radical members of the POUM along with Bolshevik Leninists spread propaganda to continue to the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=441}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday, May 5, prime minister [[Largo Caballero]], under constant pressure from the PSUC to take control of public order in Catalonia, appointed Colonel Antonio Escobar of the Republican Guard as delegate of public order, but on his arrival in Barcelona, Escobar was shot and seriously wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=441, 450, 453}}&lt;/ref&gt; After constant appeals by the CNT, POUM and UGT for a ceasefire, the fighting abated on the morning of May 6. In the evening, news reached Barcelona that 1,500 assault guards were approaching the city. The CNT agreed on a truce after negotiations with the minister of interior back in Valencia. They agreed that the assault guards would not be attacked as long as they refrained from violence and that the CNT would order its members to abandon the barricades and go back to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=441, 457}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 7, the assault guards entered Barcelona unopposed, and soon there were twelve thousand government troops in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=441, 460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repression of the CNT and POUM===
In the days following the fighting in Barcelona, various Communist newspapers engaged in a massive [[propaganda]] campaign against the anarchists and the POUM. ''[[Pravda]]'' and the American communist ''[[Daily Worker]]'' claimed that Trotskyists and Fascists were behind the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Communist party newspapers also viciously attacked the POUM, denouncing members as traitors and fascists. The Communists, supported by the [[Centrist Marxism|centrist]] faction of the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) under [[Indalecio Prieto]] now called for the POUM to be dissolved, but PM [[Largo Caballero]] resisted this move, and the Communists, along with their allies in the PSOE, then left the government in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=465}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following crisis led to the removal of Largo Caballero by President [[Manuel Azaña]]. Azaña then appointed [[Juan Negrín]] (a centrist socialist and ally of the Communists and the [[Kremlin]]) as the new premier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new cabinet was dominated by the Communists, center socialists and republicans, the CNT and left wing of the PSOE were not represented. The [[Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE) had now come to the fore as the most influential force in the Republican government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Catalonia, now controlled by troops under the Command of Communist General Sebastián Pozas and newly appointed Barcelona chief of Police Ricardo Burillo, the CNT independent police patrols were dissolved and disarmed. Furthermore, the CNT were completely removed from their positions at the Franco-Spanish border posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=490–493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another major blow to the CNT was the dissolution of countless revolutionary committees throughout Catalonia by the army and assault guards. When a new cabinet was formed by President Companys, the CNT decided not to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=495}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the months that followed, the Communists carried out a campaign of arrests, tortures and assassinations against the CNT. The imprisonment of many Anarchists caused a wave of dissent in working class quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=498}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Communists working with Soviet agents seized most of the POUM leadership along with many of its members. The POUM secretary [[Andrés Nin]] was also arrested, sent to a secret prison in Alcalá de Henares and eventually murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=501, 506}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nin's disappearance, and the repression of the POUM, caused an international outcry from various left wing organizations and further deepened the divisions within the Republic.

By the end of May 1937, the Communists were conducting a campaign to destroy the rural collectives. The PCE used the Popular army and the National Guard to dissolve CNT committees and aid tenant farmers and sharecroppers recover land lost in the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=522–523}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 11 August, the Eleventh popular army division dissolved the CNT dominated Regional Defense Council of Aragon by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=526}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of the army and the assault guards, the tenant farmers and small owners who had lost their land in the beginning of the revolution now divided up the land confiscated from the collectives. Even those collectives that had been created voluntarily were raided.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=529}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused widespread discontent amongst the peasants, the situation became so dire that the Communist party agrarian commission admitted that "agricultural work was paralyzed" and was forced to restore some of the collectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Divisions in the Government and anarchist movement===
In spite of the continued attacks by the PCE, the CNT eventually agreed to sign a pact of cooperation with the now Communist dominated UGT (the PCE had infiltrated the UGT and ousted Largo Caballero from his position in its executive). The pact was supposed to guarantee the legality of the remaining collectives and of worker's control, while at the same time recognizing the authority of the state on matters such as nationalization of industry and the armed forces. In reality, the collectives were never granted legal status, while the agreement served the further divide the anarchist movement between the anti-statist and collaborationist camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=568}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Map of the Spanish Civil War in July 1938.png|thumb|right|200px| Spain, July 1938]]

On March 7, 1938, the Nationalist forces launched a massive [[Aragon Offensive|offensive in Aragon]]. They succeeded in smashing the Republican defenses so thoroughly that their forces had reached the Mediterranean coast by 15 April, splitting the Republican territory in two. Catalonia was now cut off from the rest of the Republican territory.

By 1938 the Communist party was also in control of the newly created Military Investigation Service. The SIM was virtually dominated by Communist party members, allies and Soviet agents such as [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov]] and used as a tool of political repression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Basque nationalist [[Manuel de Irujo]], "hundreds and thousands of citizens" were prosecuted by SIM tribunals and tortured in the SIM's secret prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=605–606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Repression by the SIM as well as decrees which eroded Catalan autonomy by nationalizing the Catalan war industry, ports and courts caused widespread discontent in Catalonia amongst all social classes. Relations worsened between the [[Generalitat]] and the central government of Negrín, now based in Barcelona with the resignation of Jaime Aiguadé, representative of the [[Republican Left of Catalonia]] (ERC) party in the government and [[Manuel de Irujo]], the [[Basque Nationalist]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=614–615}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was now widespread hostility amongst Republicans, Catalans, Basques and Socialists towards the Negrin government. As the Communists were forced to rely more and more on their dominance of the military and police, morale declined at the front as countless dissenting anarchists, republicans and socialists were arrested or shot by commissars and SIM agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|pp=633–634}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, there was now a growing schism within the CNT and the FAI. Leading figures such as Horacio Prieto and minister of education Segundo Blanco argued for collaboration with the national government. Dissenting anarchists such as Jacinto Toryho, the director of [[Solidaridad Obrera (historical union)|Solidaridad Obrera]] and FAI delegate Pedro Herrera were harshly critical of this policy. Toryho was removed from his position by the CNT national committee on May 7, 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=623}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months before the fall of Catalonia, a national plenum of the libertarian socialists was held in Barcelona between 16 and 30 October 1938. [[Emma Goldman]] was in attendance and she defended the FAI in "opposition to the growing encroachment of the Negrín government on the libertarian achievements".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to José Peirats, Horacio Prieto argued for an "undisguised reformism bordering on Marxism," and that "truly effective action" was only possible through "organs of power."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=625}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also criticized the naivete of the anarchists and its "lack of concrete plans."

===Fall of Catalonia===
{{main|Catalonia Offensive}}
Between July and November 1938 the Republican forces launched their largest offensive yet which was designed to reconnect their divided territory with Catalonia. Lacking in air support, [[Armoured warfare|armor]] and heavy artillery, the Popular army was soundly defeated in the disastrous [[Battle of the Ebro]]. According to Beevor, losses were as high as 30,000 on the Republican side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Popular army was practically destroyed. It was the last action of the [[International Brigades]] and the Republican air force. 
On December 23, Nationalist forces launched their assault on Catalonia. By now, most Catalans were demoralized and tired of the fighting. Alienated by the [[Juan Negrín#Prime minister|Negrin government]] and the Communist party's nationalization of industry, the CNT was filled with defeatism and internal division. Pi Sunyer, mayor of Barcelona and a leader of the ERC, told President Azaña that "the Catalans no longer knew why they were fighting, because of Negrín's anti-Catalan policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=667}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catalonia was swiftly conquered by Nationalist troops. After 4 days of aerial bombardment (between 21 and 25 January),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=376 and 484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barcelona fell on January 26. Afterwards there followed five days of looting and extrajudicial killings by the Nationalist troops. Between 400,000&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=681}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|p=382}}&lt;/ref&gt; refugees including the defeated Army of Catalonia crossed the border into France. With the Nationalists now in control, [[Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia|Catalan autonomy]] was abolished. The [[Catalan language]], the [[Sardana]] and Catalan Christian names were forbidden. All the Catalan newspapers were requisitioned and the forbidden books retired and burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Beevor|2006|pp=378–379}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The Austrian author [[Franz Borkenau]] was sharply critical of the anarchists in Catalonia. In a book which was also very critical of the USSR-backed Communists, he described the terror which they had inflicted on Barcelona residents and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Spanish Cockpit |last=Borkenau |first=Franz |authorlink=Franz Borkenau |coauthors= |year=1974 |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |location= |isbn= |page=178 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crimes===
{{more|Red Terror (Spain)}}
During the first weeks of the war, courts of law were replaced by revolutionary tribunals. [[Extrajudicial killing]]s by militants and [[vigilante]]s soon followed.

{{quote|Everybody created his own justice and administered it himself...Some used to call this 'taking a person for a ride' [paseo] but I maintain that it was justice administered directly by the people in the complete absence of the regular judicial bodies."| [[Juan García Oliver]], Anarchist minister of justice, 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=388-50}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the initial fighting several thousand individuals were executed by anarchist and socialist militants based on their assumed political allegiance and social class.

{{quote|We do not wish  to deny that the nineteenth of July brought with it an overflowing of passions and abuses, a natural phenomenon of the transfer of power from the hands of privileged to the hands of the people. It is possible that our victory resulted in the death by violence of four or five thousand inhabitants of Catalonia who were listed as rightists and were linked to political or ecclesiastical reaction."| [[Diego Abad de Santillán]], editor of ''[[Solidaridad Obrera (periodical)|Solidaridad Obrera]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bolloten|1991|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Antony Beevor]] estimates the total number of people killed in Catalonia in the summer and autumn of 1936 at 8,352 (out of a total of 38,000 victims of the Red Terror in all of Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Battle for Spain, the Spanish Civil War, 1936-1939|last=Beevor |first=Antony |authorlink=Antony Beevor |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |location= |page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8041">'''Rudolf of Fulda''' (d. March 8, 865) was a monk of the [[Benedictine]] order during the [[Carolingian]] period in the ninth century. Rudolf was active at the [[monastery of Fulda]] in the present-day German state of [[Hesse]]. Many of his works have been lost. However, his [[Annals of Fulda]] and Life of St. [[Leoba]]) survive.

==Life==
It is uncertain when Rudolf of Fulda was born. There exists no surviving record of his early ecclesiastical life. Furthermore, there exists no record of his familia lineage. Only the date of his death is known from a reference made to the late monk of Fulda in a passage from the Annals of Fulda dated 865. He was a monk of the Benedictine monastery of Fulda. By the year 821, Rudolf was made subdeacon of the monastery. A position which is recognized as, “... a cleric in the lowest of the former major orders of the Roman Catholic Church”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/subdeacon&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf was a devoted [[theologian]], [[historian]], [[poet]] and, “...a most notable practitioner of all the arts”.&lt;ref&gt;Reuter, Timothy. The Annals of Fulda: Ninth-Century histories. Volume II. New York: Manchester University Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf of Fulda was a pupil of [[Rhabanus Maurus]] and together they would oversee a collection of two-thousand [[manuscripts]] which signified the monastery’s importance as not only a place of worship, but also a highly important library in which they also had in their possession a copy of Tacitus’ Germania. The monastery of Fulda also required such works as the Res Gestae by the fourth century Roman historian [[Ammianus Marcellinus]] and the [[Codex Fuldensis]]. The Monastery of Fulda also had in its possession works composed by [[Cicero]], [[Servius]], [[Bede]] and [[Supicius Severus]].

==Work==
Rudolf is considered to be one of the most important writers of his time and has written several works:

*''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' (''The Annals of Fulda'') were started by [[Einhard]] and continued by Rudolf (838–863).{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} Most notable of Rudolf’s work are the Annals of Fulda, composed between 838 and 901. First contributed by Einhard, Rudolf of Fulda continued the work from 838 to 863. The Annals of Fulda are considered to be one of the most fundamental primary sources of the ninth-century Carolingian period with works dating from 838 to 901. Within this work, Rudolf of Fulda makes direct reference to Tacitus’ Germania.
*''[[Vita Leobae Abbatissae Biscofesheimensis']]'', a biography of Saint [[Leoba]] of [[Tauberbischofsheim]] (most likely written in 836). Written and composed in the year 836. The Life of St. Leoba represents the first known biography of a Saxon woman. The Life of St. Leoba is one of Rudolf’s most debated works. Scholarly critique surrounding this work has focused on the gender-roles. The hagiography of St. Leoba is seen as a tool of reinforcing gendered roles, as Rudolf of Fulda alters St. Leoba’s accomplishments and actions to reinforce the Benedictine Reforms which occurred after her death.
*''[[Miracula sanctorum in Fuldenses ecclesias translatorum]]'' (843–847):  This record is said to have been composed between 842 and completed before 847. In the introduction to the text, Rudolf of Fulda states that, “he wanted to write about the virtues and miracles, which God considered worthy to happen through his saints in the present day, of whom the holy relics were brought to our region, are brought out today for the faithful for their well being”.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janneke Raaijmakers|Raaijmakers, Janneke]]. ''The Making of the Monastic Community of Fulda c.744 - c.900''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of this text, scholars and historians have been able to retrace the movement and arrival of relics which were brought to the monastery of Fulda. Rudolf of Fulda is diligent in recording the names of the individuals transporting the relics, the dates, as well as the routes travelled. With this information in hand, historians have at their disposal a well-written, first-hand account of relics acquired by the monastery of Fulda.
*''[[Translatio sancti Alexandri Wildeshusam anno 851]]'' covers the conversion of the [[Saxons]] to [[Christianity]] and was begun in 863 at the request of [[Waltbraht]], a grandson of [[Widukin]]. When Rudolf died in 865, the work was completed by [[Meginhart]]. Begun in 863, this text covers the conversion of the Saxons to Christianity, at the request of Walkbraht, the grandson of Widukin. Taken on in his final years of life, Rudolf of Fulda would not oversee the completion of his text. After his death, the work was continued and finally completed by Meginhart. The Translatio Sancti Alexandri Wildeshusam anno text of 851 conveys the conversion of the Saxon peoples to Christianity in Germany. Rudolf of Fulda once more makes reference to the works of Tacitus’ De Germania’ in the Annals of 852.
*A commentary on the [[gospel of John]], which is presumed to have been lost.

==Textual Analysis==

The study of Rudolf of Fulda’s surviving work provides modern day scholars an insight into his personal beliefs and opinions. Through careful textual analysis, scholars, such as Margaret Cotter-Lynch, have provided a deeper rooted insight into his work. Textual analysis begins with two of his most prominent works: The Life of Leoba, (composed in 836), and the Annals of Fulda, (for which Rudalf of Fulda contributed to between 836 until his death in 865). Under the orders of Rhabanus Maurus, Rudolf of Fulda was given the task of compsing the hagiography of St. Leoba (b.710 - d. 28 September 782), a Saxon nun whom achieved sainthood. This textual record represents a step in a new direction during the Carolingian period in which led to hagiography. This textual source provides us with a glimpse into the mindset of Rudolf of Fulda.

Scholars such as Margaret Cotter-Lynch, author of Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as a Compromise and Valerie L. Garver, author of Women and Aristocratic Culture in the Carolingian World have pointed to the agenda interwoven within Rudolf of Fulda’s Life of Leoba. The Life of St. Leoba was completed by Rudolf of Fulda at the request of Hrabanus. Most apparent in this text are the gender stereotypes of the ninth-century. In the Life of Leoba, Rudolf of Fulda clearly addresses what he believes to be the appropriate role of women in the ninth century. As Margaret Cotter-Lynch, author of Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as Compromise, states, 
“Rudolf’s ideals concerning religious women’s behavior seem to align with the official positions of the ninth-century Carolingian church after the Benedictine reforms: religious women are to be strictly cloistered, focused on internal piety and prayer, with very limited if any engagement with either the ecclesiastical or secular worlds beyond the covent’s walls”.&lt;ref&gt;Cotter-Lynch, Margaret. Reading Leoba, or Hagiography as Compromise. Oklahoma: Southeastern Oklahoma State University, Web. &lt;http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Rudolf of Leoba’s opinions coincide with a period in which “large male communities dominated local religious, and also social, economical and political life”&lt;ref&gt;Raaijmakers, Janneke. The Making of the Monastic Community of Fulda c.744 - c.900. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2012. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sikandar''''' or '''''Sikander''''' ([[Hindi]]: सिकंदर, [[Urdu]]: سِکندر) is a [[Bollywood films of 1941|1941]] epic  [[Bollywood]] film directed by [[Sohrab Modi]] and starring [[Prithviraj Kapoor]] as [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=100 Bollywood Films|isbn=9788174369901|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=tk5gBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT165&amp;dq=Sikandar+1941+Prithviraj+Kapoor&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBmoVChMIsq2M8pr2yAIVyhmOCh3DdwEc#v=onepage&amp;q=Sikandar%201941%20Prithviraj%20Kapoor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

The battle sequences featuring thousands of extras along with horses, elephants and chariots were filmed in Kolhapur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Grandly picturised battle scenes|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-sohrab-modi-won-over-prithviraj-kapoor/20130425.htm#5|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story is set in 326 B.C. The film begins after Alexander the Great (Sikander in [[Hindi]]/[[Urdu]]) conquers [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] and the [[Kabul]] valley and approaches the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] border at [[Jhelum]]. He respects Aristotle and loves Persian Rukhsana (known in the west as [[Roxana]]). [[Sohrab Modi]] plays the Indian king Puru ([[King Porus|Porus]] to the Greeks). Puru requests neighbouring kingdoms to unite against a common foreign enemy.

The story goes that when Sikander defeated Porus and imprisoned him, he asked Porus how would he like to be treated. Porus replied: "the same way a king is treated by another king". Sikander was impressed by his answer and set him free.

== Release ==
The release of the film coincided with [[World War II]] and the quest for [[Swaraj]] or [[Quit India]] at its peak. In [[British India|India]], the political atmosphere was tense, following [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]'s call to [[civil disobedience]]. Sikander further aroused patriotic feelings and nationalistic sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=101 Hit Films of Indian Cinema|isbn=9789350836538|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFW8AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT14&amp;dq=Sikandar+(1941)&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAWoVChMI8-Sb35X2yAIVRJCOCh106gwc#v=onepage&amp;q=Sikandar%20(1941)&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, though ''Sikander'' was approved by the [[Mumbai|Bombay]] censor board, it was later banned from some of the theatres serving [[British Indian Army]] [[cantonments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sikandar (1941)|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-fridayreview/sikandar-1941/article1820216.ece|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, its appeal to nationalism was so great and direct, it remained popular for years. It was revived in [[Delhi]] in 1961 during the Indian march into [[Goa]]. After the movie was a huge box office success, it was dubbed and released in Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Sohrab Modi won over Prithviraj Kapoor|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/slide-show/slide-show-1-how-sohrab-modi-won-over-prithviraj-kapoor/20130425.htm#1|publisher=Rediff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music of ''Sikandar'' was composed by Meer Sahib. A prominent song was "Zindagi Hai Pyar Se, Pyar Se Bitaye Ja".

The '''Soviet–Afghan War''' lasted over nine years, from December&amp;nbsp;1979 to February&amp;nbsp;1989. Insurgent groups known collectively as the [[mujahideen]], as well as smaller [[Maoist]] groups, fought a [[guerrilla war]] against the [[Soviet Army]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] government, mostly in the rural countryside. The mujahideen groups were backed primarily by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan, making it a [[Cold War (1979–1985)|Cold War]] [[proxy war]].

Prior to the arrival of Soviet troops, [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|Afghanistan's communist party]] took power after a [[Saur Revolution|1978 coup]], installing [[Nur Mohammad Taraki]] as president. The party initiated a series of radical modernization reforms throughout the country that were deeply unpopular, particularly among the more traditional rural population and the established traditional power structures.&lt;ref name="law.upenn.edu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070614165958/http://law.upenn.edu/~ekohlman/afghanistan.pdf Bennett Andrew (1999); ''A bitter harvest: Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and its effects on Afghan political movements''](Retrieved February 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The government's [[Stalinist]]-like nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Raymond Whitaker |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-babrak-karmal-1313192.html |title=Obituary: Babrak Karmal |publisher=The Independent |date= |accessdate=2018-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; of vigorously suppressing opposition, executing thousands of political prisoners and ordering massacres against unarmed civilians, led to the rise of anti-government armed groups, and by April 1979 large parts of the country were in open rebellion.&lt;ref name=kepel-2002-138&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris.|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA138 |isbn=978-1-84511-257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government itself experienced in-party rivalry, and in September 1979 Taraki was murdered under orders of his rival and Minister of Foreign Affairs, [[Hafizullah Amin]], which soured relations with the Soviet Union.

The military intervention was sharply and almost immediately denounced by the international community, with numerous sanctions and embargoes being imposed against the Soviet Union and the U.S.-led [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] against Moscow, which was holding the event; the boycott and sanctions exacerbated [[Cold War]] tensions and enraged the Soviet government which later began and led a [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|revenge boycott]] of the 1984 Olympics held in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americanforeignrelations.com/E-N/Embargoes-and-Sanctions-Cold-war-sanctions.html |title=Cold War sanctions |website=Encyclopedia of the New American Nation |accessdate=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets initially planned to secure towns and roads, stabilize the government under new leader Karmal, and withdraw within six months or a year.

==Background==
In 1885, Russian forces seized the disputed oasis at [[Panjdeh]] south of the [[Oxus River]] from Afghan forces, which became known as the [[Panjdeh Incident]]. The border was agreed by the joint Anglo-Russian [[Afghan Boundary Commission]] of 1885–87. The Russian interest in the region continued on through the [[Military history of the Soviet Union|Soviet era]], with billions in economic and military aid sent to Afghanistan between 1955 and 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin, Barnett R. ''The Fragmentation of Afghanistan''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Saur Revolution]] in 1978, the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]] was formed on April 27, 1978. The government was one with a pro-poor, pro-farmer socialist agenda. It had close relations with the [[Soviet Union]]. On December 5, 1978, a treaty of friendship was signed between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N_hfPrIMYuEC|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|page=146|last=Gates|first=Robert|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|isbn=978-1-4165-4336-7|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1979, the United States Ambassador to Afghanistan, [[Adolph Dubs]], was kidnapped by [[Setami Milli]] militants and was later killed during an assault carried out by the Afghan police, assisted by Soviet advisers. Dubs' death led to a major deterioration in [[Afghanistan–United States relations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harrison|first=Selig|author2=Cordovez, Diego|title=Out of Afghanistan: The Inside Story of the Soviet Withdrawal|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506294-9|pages=34–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Southwestern Asia]], drastic changes were taking place concurrent with the upheavals in Afghanistan. In February 1979, the [[Iranian Revolution]] ousted the American-backed [[Shah]] from Iran, losing the United States as one of its most powerful allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brown.edu/Research/Understanding_the_Iran_Contra_Affair/i-background.php|title=Understanding the Iran Contra Affairs|accessdate=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States then deployed twenty ships in the [[Persian Gulf]] and the [[Arabian Sea]] including two aircraft carriers, and there was a constant stream of threats of warfare between the [[Iran–United States relations|U.S. and Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Jiri|last=Valenta|year=1980|title=From Prague to Kabul: The Soviet Style of Invasion}}&lt;/ref&gt;
March 1979 marked the signing of the U.S.-backed [[Egypt–Israel Peace Treaty|peace agreement between Israel and Egypt]]. The Soviet leadership saw the agreement as giving a major advantage to the United States. A Soviet newspaper stated that Egypt and Israel were now "[[Gendarme (historical)|gendarmes]] of [[the Pentagon]]". The Soviets viewed the treaty not only as a peace agreement between their erstwhile allies in Egypt and the US-supported Israelis but also as a military pact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Minton|last=Goldman|year=1984|title=Soviet Military Intervention in Afghanistan: Roots &amp; Causes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the US sold more than 5,000 [[List of missiles by nation#United States|missiles]] to [[Saudi Arabia]]. Also, the Soviet Union's previously strong relations with [[Iraq]] had recently soured. In June 1978, Iraq began entering into friendlier relations with the Western world and buying French and Italian-made weapons, though the vast majority still came from the Soviet Union, its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, and China.

===Saur Revolution===
{{Main|Saur Revolution}}

King [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] ascended to [[Reigns of Nadir Shah and Zahir Shah|the throne]] and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Zahir's cousin, [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]], served as [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] from 1954 to 1963. The [[Marxist]] [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan]]'s (PDPA's) strength grew considerably in these years. In 1967, the PDPA split into two rival factions, the [[Khalq]] (Masses) faction headed by [[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] and [[Hafizullah Amin]] and the [[Parcham]] (Flag) faction led by [[Babrak Karmal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barfield|first1=Thomas|title=Afghanistan: A Cultural and Political History (Princeton Studies in Muslim Politics)|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691154411|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqRFCkpTdUcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Prime Minister Daoud seized power in a military [[1973 Afghan coup d'état|coup on July 17, 1973]] after allegations of corruption and poor economic conditions against the king's government. Daoud put an end to the monarchy, and his time in power was widely popular among the general populace but unpopular among PDPA supporters.

Intense opposition from factions of the PDPA was sparked by the repression imposed on them by Daoud's regime and the death of a leading PDPA member, [[Mir Akbar Khyber]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradsher|first=Henry S.|title=Afghanistan and the Soviet Union|location=Durham|publisher=Duke Press Policy Studies|year=1983|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mysterious circumstances of Khyber's death sparked massive anti-Daoud demonstrations in [[Kabul]], which resulted in the arrest of several prominent PDPA leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hilali|first=A.

On April 27, 1978, the [[Afghan army]], which had been sympathetic to the PDPA cause, overthrew and executed Daoud along with members of his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Garthoff|first=Raymond L.|title=Détente and Confrontation|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=The Brookings Institution|year=1994|page=986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nur Muhammad Taraki, Secretary General of the PDPA, became President of the Revolutionary Council and Prime Minister of the newly established Democratic Republic of Afghanistan.

===Factions inside the PDPA===
After the revolution, Taraki assumed the [[Presidency]], Prime Ministership and General Secretaryship of the PDPA. The government was divided along factional lines, with President Taraki and Deputy Prime Minister [[Hafizullah Amin]] of the Khalq faction against Parcham leaders such as Babrak Karmal and [[Mohammad Najibullah]]. Within the PDPA, conflicts resulted in [[exile]]s, [[purge]]s and executions of Parcham members.&lt;ref name="lcweb2"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0087) ''The April 1978 Coup d'état and the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan'' – Library of congress country studies](Retrieved February 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; The PDPA executed between 10,000 and 27,000 people, mostly at [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]] prior to the Soviet intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Valentino2005FinalSolutions|Valentino (2005) ''Final solutions'']] p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, Robert D., ''Soldiers of God: With Islamic Warriors in Afghanistan and Pakistan'', New York, Vintage Departures, (2001), p.115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4756480.stm Kabul's prison of death] [[BBC]], February 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During its first 18 months of rule, the PDPA applied a Soviet-style program of modernizing reforms, many of which were viewed by conservatives as opposing Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.onwar.com/aced/chrono/c1900s/yr75/fafghan1978.htm|title=Afghanistan Marxist Coup 1978|publisher=Onwar.com|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Decrees setting forth changes in marriage customs and [[land reform]] were not received well by a population deeply immersed in tradition and Islam, particularly by the powerful landowners who were harmed economically by the abolition of [[usury]] (although usury is prohibited in Islam) and the cancellation of farmers' debts. The new government also enhanced women's rights, sought a rapid eradication of [[illiteracy]] and promoted Afghanistan's ethnic minorities, although these programs appear to have had an effect only in the urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUSNyMH1aFQC|title=Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation|last=Amstutz|first=J.

In September 1979, [[Deputy Prime Minister]] Hafizullah Amin seized power, arresting and killing President Taraki. Over two months of instability overwhelmed Amin's regime as he moved against his opponents in the PDPA and the growing rebellion.

The [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR) had been a major power broker and influential mentor in the [[Politics of Afghanistan|politics]] of its poorer and much smaller neighbor.

Economic assistance and aid had been provided to Afghanistan as early as 1919, shortly after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and when the regime was facing the [[Russian Civil War]]. Provisions were given in the form of [[small arms]], ammunition, a few aircraft, and (according to debated Soviet sources) a million gold [[ruble]]s to support the resistance during the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919. In 1942, the USSR again moved to strengthen the [[Afghan Armed Forces]], by providing small arms and aircraft, and establishing training centers in [[Tashkent]] ([[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]). Soviet-Afghan military cooperation began on a regular basis in 1956, and further agreements were made in the 1970s, which saw the USSR send advisers and specialists.

In 1978, after witnessing India's nuclear test, ''[[Smiling Buddha]]'', President [[Mohammed Daoud Khan|Daud Khan]] initiated a military buildup to counter Pakistan's [[Pakistan Armed Forces|armed forces]] and Iranian [[Iranian military|military influence]] in Afghan politics. A final pre-war treaty, signed in December 1978, allowed the PDPA to call upon the Soviet Union for military support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Soviet Afghan-War: How a Superpower Fought and Lost|author=The Russian General Staff|editor1=Lestwer W.

Following the [[1979 Herat uprising|Herat uprising]], President [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|Taraki]] contacted [[Alexei Kosygin]], [[Premier of the Soviet Union|chairman]] of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|USSR Council of Ministers]], and asked for "practical and technical assistance with men and armament". Kosygin was unfavorable to the proposal on the basis of the negative political repercussions such an action would have for his country, and he rejected all further attempts by Taraki to solicit Soviet military aid in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Misdaq, Nabi|title=Afghanistan: Political Frailty and External Interference|publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]|year=2006|isbn=978-0-415-70205-8 |page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Kosygin's rejection, Taraki requested aid from [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|general secretary]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and [[List of heads of state of the Soviet Union|Soviet head of state]], who warned Taraki that full Soviet intervention "would only play into the hands of our enemies – both yours and ours". Brezhnev also advised Taraki to ease up on the drastic social reforms and to seek broader support for his regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Grigory, Paul|title=Lenin's Brain and Other Tales from the Secret Soviet Archives|publisher=[[Hoover Press]]|year=2008|isbn=978-0-8179-4812-2|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Taraki attended a conference of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] in [[Havana]], Cuba. On his way back, he stopped in Moscow on March 20 and met with Brezhnev, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Soviet Union)|Soviet Foreign Minister]] [[Andrei Gromyko]] and other Soviet officials. It was rumoured that Karmal was present at the meeting in an attempt to reconcile Taraki's Khalq faction and the Parcham against Amin and his followers. At the meeting, Taraki was successful in negotiating some Soviet support, including the redeployment of two Soviet armed divisions at the Soviet-Afghan border, the sending of 500 military and civilian advisers and specialists and the immediate delivery of Soviet armed equipment sold at 25 percent below the original price; however, the Soviets were not pleased about the developments in Afghanistan and Brezhnev impressed upon Taraki the need for party unity. Despite reaching this agreement with Taraki, the Soviets continued to be reluctant to intervene further in Afghanistan and repeatedly refused Soviet military intervention within Afghan borders during Taraki's rule as well as later during Amin's short rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rasanayagam, Angelo|title=Afghanistan: A Modern History|publisher=[[I.B.Tauris]]|year=2005|isbn=978-1-85043-857-1 |pages=86–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1975, militants from the [[Jamiat Islami]] party attempted to overthrow the government. They started their rebellion in the [[Panjshir valley]] (a part of the greater [[Parwan province]]), in the present day [[Panjshir province]], some 100 kilometers north of [[Kabul]], and in a number of other [[Provinces of Afghanistan|provinces]] of the country. However, government forces easily defeated the insurgency and a sizable portion of the insurgents sought [[Afghan refugees|refuge]] in Pakistan where they enjoyed the support of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s government, which had been alarmed by Daoud's revival of the [[Pashtunistan]] issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0106) ''Pakistan's Support of Afghan Islamists, 1975–79'' – Library of congress country studies](Retrieved February 4, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the Taraki government initiated a series of reforms, including a radical modernization of the traditional Islamic civil and especially marriage law, aimed at "uprooting [[feudalism]]" in Afghan society.&lt;ref name="law.upenn.edu"/&gt; The government brooked no opposition to the reforms&lt;ref name="lcweb2"/&gt; and responded with violence to unrest. Between April 1978 and the Soviet Intervention of December 1979, thousands of prisoners, perhaps as many as 27,000, were executed at the notorious&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"/&gt; [[Pul-e-Charkhi prison]], including many village [[mullah]]s and headmen.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=115}} Other members of the traditional elite, the religious establishment and [[intelligentsia]] fled the country.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=115}}

====Killing of the U.S. ambassador====
In February 1979, the contentious law and order situation led to a serious diplomatic incident involving United States, Soviet Union and Afghanistan when [[United States Ambassador to Afghanistan|U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan]] [[Adolph Dubs|Adolph "Spike" Dubs]] was kidnapped by a mysterious group of militants. They are sometimes alleged to have been part of the radical communist faction, ''[[Settam-e-Melli]]'' (lit.

The government refused categorically to negotiate with the militants, in spite of the U.S. embassy's demands.&lt;ref name="Oxford University Press, Cordovez"/&gt; The U.S. increased pressure on the Afghan government and the Soviet Union, forcefully demanding peaceful negotiations for the release of their ambassador.&lt;ref name="The New York Times, 2001"&gt;{{cite news|last=Harwood|first=William L.|title=The Murder of Adolph Dubs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/28/opinion/28iht-edlet_ed3__59.html|accessdate=February 28, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times, 2001|date=December 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. aid to insurgents====
{{main|Operation Cyclone}}
In the mid-1970s, Pakistani intelligence officials began privately lobbying the U.S. and its allies to send material assistance to the Islamist insurgents. Pakistani President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]]'s ties with the U.S. had been strained during [[Jimmy Carter]]'s [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|presidency]] due to Pakistan's nuclear program and the execution of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in April 1979, but Carter told National Security Adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] and Secretary of State [[Cyrus Vance]] as early as January 1979 that it was vital to "repair our relationships with Pakistan" in light of the [[Iranian Revolution|unrest in Iran]].&lt;ref name="Riedel"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Bruce Riedel|last=Riedel|first=Bruce|title=What We Won: America's Secret War in Afghanistan, 1979–1989|publisher=[[Brookings Institution]] Press|year=2014|isbn=978-0815725954|pp=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) official [[Robert Gates]], "the Carter administration turned to CIA&amp;nbsp;... to counter Soviet and Cuban aggression in the Third World, particularly beginning in mid-1979." In March 1979, "CIA sent several covert action options relating to Afghanistan to the SCC &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Oversight of United States covert operations#NSC Special Coordination Committee|Special Coordination Committee]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;" of the [[United States National Security Council]]. At a March 30 meeting, U.S. [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] representative [[Walter B. Slocombe]] "asked if there was value in keeping the Afghan insurgency going, 'sucking the Soviets into a Vietnamese quagmire?'"&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Robert Gates|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2007|isbn=9781416543367|pp=142, 144–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked to clarify this remark, Slocombe explained: "Well, the whole idea was that if the Soviets decided to strike at this tar baby [Afghanistan] we had every interest in making sure that they got stuck."&lt;ref name="White"&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=John Bernell|url=http://digitalcommons.lsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4790&amp;context=gradschool_theses|title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland|date=May 2012|accessdate=2017-10-10|pp=7–8, 12, 29, 45–46, 80–83, 97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet an April 5 memo from National Intelligence Officer Arnold Horelick warned: "Covert action would raise the costs to the Soviets and inflame Moslem opinion against them in many countries. The risk was that a substantial U.S. covert aid program could raise the stakes and induce the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended."&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

In May 1979, U.S. officials secretly began meeting with rebel leaders through Pakistani government contacts. A former Pakistani military official claimed that he personally introduced a CIA official to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]] that month (Freedom of Information Act requests for records describing these meetings have been denied).&lt;ref name="nsarchive.gwu.edu"&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB57/essay.html Steve Galster "AFGHANISTAN: THE MAKING OF U.S. POLICY, 1973–1990" National Security Archive, October 9, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; After additional meetings on April 6 and July 3, Carter signed a "presidential 'finding'" that "authorized the CIA to spend just over $500,000" on "non-lethal" aid to the mujahideen, which "seemed at the time a small beginning."&lt;ref name="Riedel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Coll"/&gt; Brzezinski later claimed that "We didn't push the Russians to intervene, but we knowingly increased the probability that they would."&lt;ref&gt;[http://dgibbs.faculty.arizona.edu/sites/dgibbs.faculty.arizona.edu/files/afghan-ip.pdf David N.

The full significance of the U.S. sending aid to the mujahideen prior to the invasion is debated among scholars.

Although Gates described [[Director of Central Intelligence]] (DCI) [[Stansfield Turner]] and the CIA's [[Directorate of Operations (CIA)|Directorate of Operations]] (DO) as contemplating "several enhancement options"—up to and including the direct provision of arms from the U.S. to the mujahideen through the ISI—as early as late August 1979,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Robert Gates|last=Gates|first=Robert|title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|year=2007|isbn=9781416543367|pp=146–147|quote=By the end of August, Pakistani President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq was pressuring the United States for arms and equipment for the insurgents in Afghanistan.&amp;nbsp;...

Brzezinski deliberately avoided saying whether the upgraded program included weapons, since Moscow has long sought to justify its invasion by accusing Washington of destabilizing Afghanistan during 1978 and 1979.

The Afghan government, having secured a treaty in December 1978 that allowed them to call on Soviet forces, repeatedly requested the introduction of troops in Afghanistan in the spring and summer of 1979. They requested Soviet troops to provide security and to assist in the fight against the mujaheddin rebels.  After the killing of Soviet technicians in Herat by rioting mobs, the Soviet government sold several Mi-24 helicopters to the Afghan military, and increased the number of military advisers in country to 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/soviet-afghan_compound-warfare.htm|title=Compound War Case Study:  The Soviets in Afghanistan|last=Bauman|first=Dr. Robert F.|date=2001|website=Global Security.org|access-date=April 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 14, 1979, the Afghan government requested that the USSR send 15 to 20 helicopters with their crews to Afghanistan, and on June 16, the Soviet government responded and sent a detachment of tanks, [[BMP-1|BMPs]], and crews to guard the government in Kabul and to secure the [[Bagram]] and [[Shindand, Herat|Shindand]] [[airfield]]s. In response to this request, an airborne battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel A. Lomakin, arrived at the [[Bagram Air Base]] on July 7. They arrived without their combat gear, disguised as technical specialists. They were the personal bodyguards for President Taraki. The paratroopers were directly subordinate to the senior Soviet military advisor and did not interfere in Afghan politics. Several leading politicians at the time such as [[Alexei Kosygin]] and [[Andrei Gromyko]] were against intervention.

After a month, the Afghan requests were no longer for individual crews and subunits, but for regiments and larger units. In July, the Afghan government requested that two motorized rifle divisions be sent to Afghanistan. The following day, they requested an airborne division in addition to the earlier requests. They repeated these requests and variants to these requests over the following months right up to December 1979. However, the Soviet government was in no hurry to grant them.

Based on information from the [[KGB]], Soviet leaders felt that Prime Minister [[Hafizullah Amin]]'s actions had destabilized the situation in Afghanistan. Following his initial coup against and killing of [[Nur Muhammad Taraki|President Taraki]], the KGB station in Kabul warned Moscow that Amin's leadership would lead to "harsh repressions, and as a result, the activation and consolidation of the opposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Martin|last=Walker|year=1994|title=The Cold War – A History|publisher=Stoddart|location=Toronto, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets established a special commission on Afghanistan, comprising KGB chairman [[Yuri Andropov]], [[Boris Ponomarev]] from the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] and [[Dmitriy Ustinov]], the [[Ministry of Defence (Soviet Union)|Minister of Defence]]. In late April 1978, the committee reported that Amin was purging his opponents, including Soviet loyalists, that his loyalty to Moscow was in question and that he was seeking diplomatic links with Pakistan and possibly the People's Republic of China (which at the time had [[Sino-Soviet split|poor relations with the Soviet Union]]). Of specific concern were Amin's secret meetings with the U.S. chargé d'affaires, J. Bruce Amstutz, which, while never amounting to any agreement between Amin and the United States, sowed suspicion in the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;Coll, Steven. ''Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Intervention to September 10, 2001''. New York: Penguin Books, 2004. p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Information obtained by the KGB from its agents in Kabul provided the last arguments to eliminate Amin. Supposedly, two of Amin's guards killed the former president Nur Muhammad Taraki with a pillow, and Amin, himself, was suspected to be a CIA agent. The latter, however, is still disputed with Amin repeatedly demonstrating friendliness toward the various delegates of the Soviet Union who would arrive in Afghanistan. Soviet General [[Vasily Zaplatin]], a political advisor of Premier Brezhnev at the time, claimed that four of President Taraki's ministers were responsible for the destabilization. However, Zaplatin failed to emphasize this in discussions and was not heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ru icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20001021025053/http://zavtra.ru/cgi/veil/data/zavtra/99/316/61.html ДО ШТУРМА ДВОРЦА АМИНА]&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1970s, rapprochement between the USSR and the US had been well-established, which had led to growing tendencies toward [[détente]] and as such, attempts toward [[disarmament]].{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Of note was the [[SALT I#SALT I|SALT I]] treaty, which was created to encourage cooperation in matters of nuclear weaponry and technology between the two nations. A second round of talks between Soviet premier Brezhnev and President Carter yielded the [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks|SALT II treaty]] in June 1979. (the [[United States Senate]] later failed to ratify the treaty due to the Soviet-Afghan conflict). Conservatives believe that this process was reflective of growing Soviet political influence in the world and that Soviet intervention in Afghanistan in December 1979 was an attempt to preserve, stabilize and militarily intervene on behalf of the communist regime there and thus, their own political standing.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

During meetings between President Taraki and Soviet leaders in March 1979, the Soviets promised political support and to send military equipment and technical specialists, but upon repeated requests by Taraki for direct Soviet intervention, the leadership adamantly opposed him; reasons included that they would be met with "bitter resentment" from the Afghan people, that intervening in another country's civil war would hand a propaganda victory to their opponents, and Afghanistan's overall inconsequential weight in international affairs, in essence realizing they had little to gain by taking over a country with a poor economy, unstable government, and population hostile to outsiders.  However, as the situation continued to deteriorate from May–December 1979, Moscow changed its mind on dispatching Soviet troops.  The reasons for this complete turnabout are not entirely clear, and several speculative arguments include the grave internal situation and inability for the Afghan government, headed by Amin from 14 September 1979 after a successful coup, to quell the rebellion, the effects of the [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought an Islamic theocracy into power, leading to fears that religious fanaticism would spread through Afghanistan and into Soviet Muslim Central Asian republics, and the deteriorating ties with the United States with the failure of Congress to ratify the SALT II treaty and the impression that détente was "already effectively dead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/e-dossier_4.pdf |title=Documents on the Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan e-Dossier No. 4. p. 70-75 |date=November 2001 |website= |publisher=Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars |accessdate=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet intervention and coup===
[[File:SovietInvasionAfghanistanMap.png|thumb|upright=2.05|right|The Soviet intervention]]

On October 31, 1979 Soviet informants to the [[Afghan Armed Forces]] who were under orders from the inner circle of advisors under Soviet president Brezhnev, relayed information for them to undergo maintenance cycles for their tanks and other crucial equipment. Meanwhile, telecommunications links to areas outside of Kabul were severed, isolating the capital. With a deteriorating security situation, large numbers of [[Soviet Airborne Forces]] joined stationed ground troops and began to land in Kabul on December 25. Simultaneously, Amin moved the offices of the president to the [[Tajbeg Palace]], believing this location to be more secure from possible threats. According to Colonel General Tukharinov and Merimsky, Amin was fully informed of the military movements, having requested Soviet military assistance to northern Afghanistan on December 17.&lt;ref name="GarthoffPage s1017-1018"&gt;{{cite book|last=Garthoff|first=Raymond L.|title=Détente and Confrontation|location=Washington D.C.|publisher=The Brookings Institution|year=1994|pages=1017–1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arnold|first=Anthony|title=Afghanistan's Two-Party Communism: Parcham and Khalq|location=Stanford|publisher=Hoover Institution Press|year=1983|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother and General Dmitry Chiangov met with the commander of the [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th Army]] before Soviet troops entered the country, to work out initial routes and locations for Soviet troops.&lt;ref name="GarthoffPage s1017-1018" /&gt;

On December 27, 1979, 700 Soviet troops dressed in Afghan uniforms, including [[KGB]] and [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]] [[special forces]] officers from the ''[[Alpha Group]]'' and ''Zenith Group'', occupied major governmental, military and media buildings in Kabul, including their primary target – the [[Tajbeg Palace|Tajbeg Presidential Palace]].

[[File:BMD-1 in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|Soviet [[paratroopers]] aboard a [[BMD-1]] in Kabul]]
That operation began at 19:00 hr., when the KGB-led Soviet ''Zenith Group'' destroyed Kabul's communications hub, paralyzing Afghan military command. At 19:15, [[Operation Storm-333|the assault on Tajbeg Palace]] began; as planned, president Hafizullah Amin was killed. Simultaneously, other objectives were occupied (e.g., the [[Ministry of Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of Interior]] at 19:15). The operation was fully complete by the morning of December 28, 1979.

The Soviet military command at [[Termez]], [[Uzbek SSR]], announced on [[Radio Kabul]] that Afghanistan had been liberated from Amin's rule. According to the Soviet [[Politburo]] they were complying with the 1978 ''Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Good Neighborliness'' and Amin had been "executed by a tribunal for his crimes" by the Afghan Revolutionary Central Committee. That [[committee]] then elected as head of government former Deputy Prime Minister [[Babrak Karmal]], who had been demoted to the relatively insignificant post of ambassador to [[Czechoslovakia]] following the Khalq takeover, and announced that it had requested Soviet military assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/isd/Afghan_1_WR_group.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Soviet Invasion of Afghanistan in 1979: Failure of Intelligence or of the Policy Process? |page=7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060722123446/http://www12.georgetown.edu/sfs/isd/Afghan_1_WR_group.pdf |archivedate=July 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet ground forces, under the command of [[Marshal]] [[Sergei Sokolov (Marshal)|Sergei Sokolov]], entered Afghanistan from the north on December 27. In the morning, the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division|103rd Guards 'Vitebsk' Airborne Division]] landed at the airport at Bagram and the deployment of Soviet troops in Afghanistan was underway. The force that entered Afghanistan, in addition to the 103rd Guards Airborne Division, was under command of the [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|40th Army]] and consisted of the [[108th Motor Rifle Division|108th]] and [[5th Guards Motor Rifle Division]]s, the 860th Separate Motor Rifle Regiment, the [[56th Guards Air Assault Brigade|56th Separate Airborne Assault Brigade]], the 36th Mixed Air Corps. Later on the [[201st Motor Rifle Division|201st]] and [[68th Motor Rifle Division]]s also entered the country, along with other smaller units.&lt;ref&gt;Ye. I.

In the second week alone, Soviet aircraft had made a total of 4,000 flights into Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisk|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Fisk|title=The Great War for Civilisation: the Conquest of the Middle East|location=London|publisher=Alfred Knopf|year=2005|pages=40–41|isbn=1-84115-007-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of the two later divisions, the total Soviet force rose to over 100,000 personnel.

====International positions on Soviet intervention====
Foreign ministers from 34 Islamic nations adopted a resolution which condemned the Soviet intervention and demanded "the immediate, urgent and unconditional withdrawal of Soviet troops" from the Muslim nation of Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="news.google.co.nz"/&gt; The UN General Assembly passed a resolution protesting the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan by a vote of 104–18.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to political scientist Gilles Kepel, the Soviet intervention or "invasion" was "viewed with horror" in the West, considered to be a "fresh twist" on the geo-political "[[The Great Game|Great Game]]" of the 19th Century in which Britain feared that Russia sought access to the [[Indian Ocean]] and posed "a threat to Western security", explicitly violating "the world balance of power agreed upon at [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]]" in 1945.&lt;ref name=kepel-2002-138/&gt;

Weapons supplies were made available through numerous countries; the United States purchased all of Israel's captured Soviet weapons clandestinely, and then funnelled the weapons to the Mujahideen, while Egypt upgraded their own army's weapons, and sent the older weapons to the militants, Turkey sold their [[World War II]] stockpiles to the warlords, and the British and Swiss provided [[Blowpipe missile|Blowpipe]] missiles and [[Oerlikon 20 mm cannon|Oerlikon]] anti-aircraft guns respectively, after they were found to be poor models for their own forces.&lt;ref name="unholy"&gt;Kinsella, Warren. "Unholy Alliances", Lester Publishing, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; China provided the most relevant weapons, likely due to their own experience with [[guerrilla warfare]], and kept meticulous record of all the shipments.&lt;ref name="unholy"/&gt;

===December 1979 – February 1980: Occupation===
The first phase began with the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan and their first battles with various opposition groups.&lt;ref name="news.google.co.nz"/&gt; Soviet troops entered Afghanistan along two ground routes and one [[air corridor]], quickly taking control of the major urban centers, military bases and strategic installations. However, the presence of Soviet troops did not have the desired effect of pacifying the country. On the contrary, it exacerbated a [[Nationalism|nationalistic]] feeling, causing the rebellion to spread further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Olivier|authorlink=Olivier Roy (professor)|title=Islam and resistance in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Babrak Karmal, Afghanistan's new president, charged the Soviets with causing an increase in the unrest, and demanded that the 40th Army step in and quell the rebellion, as his own army had proved untrustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Russian General Staff, Grau &amp; Gress, ''The Soviet-Afghan War'', p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Soviet troops found themselves drawn into fighting against urban uprisings, tribal armies (called ''lashkar''), and sometimes against mutinying Afghan Army units. These forces mostly fought in the open, and Soviet airpower and artillery made short work of them.&lt;ref name="mired"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leav-www.army.mil/fmso/documents/miredinmount.htm|title=The Soviet-Afghan war: a superpower mired in the mountains|accessdate=September 15, 2007|last=Grau|first=Lester|date=March 2004|publisher=[[Foreign Military Studies Office]] Publications}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March 1980 – April 1985: Soviet offensives===
{{Main|Panjshir offensives}}
[[File:Muja on radio in Munda Dir.jpg|thumb|A [[mujahideen]] fighter in [[Kunar Province|Kunar]] uses a communications receiver.]]
The war now developed into a new pattern: the Soviets occupied the cities and main axis of communication, while the mujahideen, (which the Soviet Army soldiers called 'Dushman,' meaning 'enemy')&lt;ref name="Schofield, The Russian Elite"&gt;Schofield, The Russian Elite&lt;/ref&gt; divided into small groups, waged a [[guerrilla war]]. Almost 80 percent of the country escaped government control.&lt;ref name="Amstutz, J. Bruce 1986 p. 127"/&gt; Soviet troops were deployed in strategic areas in the northeast, especially along the road from [[Termez]] to Kabul. In the west, a strong Soviet presence was maintained to counter [[Iran]]ian influence. Incidentally, special Soviet units would have{{clarify|date=February 2011}} also performed secret attacks on Iranian territory to destroy suspected mujahideen bases, and their helicopters then got engaged in shootings with Iranian jets.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Feifer ''The Great Gamble'', pp. 169–170&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some regions such as [[Nuristan]], in the northeast, and [[Hazarajat]], in the central mountains of Afghanistan, were virtually untouched by the fighting, and lived in almost complete independence.
[[File:August 1984 - captured field guns in Jaji, Paktia.jpg|thumb|left|Mujahideen with two captured artillery field guns in [[Jaji District|Jaji]], 1984.]]
Periodically the Soviet Army undertook multi-[[division (military)|divisional]] offensives into mujahideen-controlled areas. Between 1980 and 1985, nine [[Panjshir offensives|offensives]] were launched into the strategically important [[Panjshir Valley]], but government control of the area did not improve.&lt;ref&gt;Russian General Staff, Grau &amp; Gress, ''The Soviet-Afghan War'', p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy fighting also occurred in the provinces neighbouring Pakistan, where cities and government outposts were constantly under siege by the mujahideen. Massive Soviet operations would regularly break these sieges, but the mujahideen would return as soon as the Soviets left.&lt;ref name="bear"/&gt; In the west and south, fighting was more sporadic, except in the cities of [[Herat]] and [[Kandahar]], that were always partly controlled by the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|title= Islam and resistance in Afghanistan|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets did not, at first, foresee taking on such an active role in fighting the rebels and attempted to play down their role there as giving light assistance to the Afghan army. However, the arrival of the Soviets had the opposite effect as it incensed instead of pacified the people, causing the mujahideen to gain in strength and numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Klass, Rosanne|title=Afghanistan: The Great Game Revisited|year=1987|publisher=Freedom House|page=244}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the Soviets thought that their forces would strengthen the backbone of the Afghan army and provide assistance by securing major cities, lines of communication and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amstutz, J. Bruce|title=Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation|year=1986|publisher=National Defense University Press|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Afghan army forces had a high desertion rate and were loath to fight, especially since the Soviet forces pushed them into infantry roles while they manned the armored vehicles and artillery. The main reason though that the Afghan soldiers were so ineffective was their lack of morale as many of them were not truly loyal to the communist government but simply collecting a paycheck. Once it became apparent that the Soviets would have to get their hands dirty, they followed three main strategies aimed at quelling the uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Amstutz, J. Bruce|title=Afghanistan: The First Five Years of Soviet Occupation|year=1986|publisher=National Defense University Press|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimidation was the first strategy, in which the Soviets would use airborne attacks as well as armored ground attacks to destroy villages, livestock and crops in trouble areas. The Soviets would bomb villages that were near sites of guerrilla attacks on Soviet convoys or known to support resistance groups. Local peoples were forced to either flee their homes or die as daily Soviet attacks made it impossible to live in these areas. By forcing the people of Afghanistan to flee their homes, the Soviets hoped to deprive the guerrillas of resources and safe havens.  The second strategy consisted of subversion which entailed sending spies to join resistance groups and report information as well as bribing local tribes or guerrilla leaders into ceasing operations. Finally, the Soviets used military forays into contested territories in an effort to root out the [[guerrillas]] and limit their options. Classic [[search and destroy]] operations were implemented using [[Mil Mi-24]] helicopter gunships that would provide cover for ground forces in armored vehicles. Once the villages were occupied by Soviet forces, inhabitants who remained were frequently interrogated and tortured for information or killed.&lt;ref name="Report from Afghanistan"&gt;[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/left/afghan/report.pdf Report from Afghanistan] Claude Malhuret&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Afghan village destroyed by the Soviets.jpg|thumb|right|An Afghan village left in ruins after being destroyed by [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet forces]]]]
To complement their brute force approach to weeding out the [[insurgency]], the Soviets used [[KHAD]] (Afghan secret police) to gather intelligence, infiltrate the mujahideen, spread false information, bribe tribal militias into fighting and organize a government [[militia]]. While it is impossible to know exactly how successful the KHAD was in infiltrating mujahideen groups, it is thought that they succeeded in penetrating a good many resistance groups based in [[Afghanistan]], Pakistan and [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; KHAD is thought to have had particular success in igniting internal rivalries and political divisions amongst the resistance groups, rendering some of them completely useless because of infighting.&lt;ref name="Girardet, Edward 1985 129"&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardet, Edward|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet War|year=1985|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; The KHAD had some success in securing tribal loyalties but many of these relationships were fickle and temporary. Often KHAD secured neutrality agreements rather than committed political alignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Girardet, Edward|title=Afghanistan: The Soviet War|year=1985|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sarandoy]], a KHAD controlled government militia, had mixed success in the war. Large salaries and proper weapons attracted a good number of recruits to the cause, even if they were not necessarily "pro-communist". The problem was that many of the recruits they attracted were in fact mujahideen who would join up to procure arms, ammunition and money while also gathering information about forthcoming military operations.&lt;ref name="Girardet, Edward 1985 129"/&gt;

In 1985, the size of the LCOSF (Limited Contingent of Soviet Forces) was increased to 108,800 and fighting increased throughout the country, making 1985 the bloodiest year of the war. However, despite suffering heavily, the mujahideen were able to remain in the field, mostly because they received thousands of new volunteers daily, and continue resisting the Soviets.

===Mujahedin raid inside Soviet Union===
In an effort to foment unrest and rebellion by the Islamic populations of the Soviet Union, starting in late 1984 [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|Director of CIA]] [[William Casey]] encouraged Mujahedin militants to mount violent sabotage raids inside the Soviet Union, according [[Robert Gates]], Casey's executive assistant and Mohammed Yousef, the Pakistani [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]] brigadier general who was the chief for Afghan operations. The rebels began cross-border raids into the Soviet Union in Spring 1985.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Coll, "Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan and Bin Laden" (New York: Penguin Putnam, 2003), p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==1980s: Insurrection==
In the mid-1980s, the Afghan [[resistance movement]], assisted by the United States, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom, Egypt,&lt;ref name=crile1/&gt; the People's Republic of China and others, contributed to Moscow's high military costs and strained international relations. The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan as an integral [[Cold War]] struggle, and the [[CIA]] provided assistance to [[anti-Soviet]] forces through the [[Pakistani intelligence services]], in a program called [[Operation Cyclone]].&lt;ref name=1986-1992-CIA-AND-BRITISH-RECRUIT-AND-TRAIN-MILITANTS-WORLDWIDE-TO-HELP-FIGHT-AFGHAN-WAR&gt;{{cite web|title=1986–1992: CIA and British Recruit and Train Militants Worldwide to Help Fight Afghan War|url=http://www.historycommons.org/context.jsp?item=a86operationcyclone|publisher=History Commons|accessdate=January 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-West Frontier Province]] became a base for the Afghan resistance fighters and the [[Deobandi]] ulama of that province played a significant role in the Afghan 'jihad', with Madrasa Haqqaniyya becoming a prominent organisational and networking base for the anti-Soviet Afghan fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haroon|first=Sana|year=2008|title=The Rise of Deobandi Islam in the North-West Frontier Province and Its Implications in Colonial India and Pakistan 1914–1996|jstor=27755911|journal=Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society|volume=18|pages=66–67|via=|doi=10.1017/s1356186307007778}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as money, Muslim countries provided thousands of volunteer fighters known as "[[Afghan Arabs]]", who wished to wage [[jihad]] against the [[Atheism|atheist]] communists.

In the course of the guerrilla war, leadership came to be distinctively associated with the title of "commander". It applied to independent leaders, eschewing identification with elaborate military [[bureaucracy]] associated with such ranks as general. As the war produced leaders of reputation, "commander" was conferred on leaders of fighting units of all sizes, signifying pride in independence, self-sufficiency, and distinct ties to local communities. The title epitomized Afghan pride in their struggle against a powerful foe. Segmentation of power and religious leadership were the two values evoked by nomenclature generated in the war. Neither had been favored in the ideology of the former Afghan state.

Afghanistan's resistance movement was born in chaos, spread and triumphed chaotically, and did not find a way to govern differently. Virtually all of its war was waged locally by regional [[warlord]]s. As warfare became more sophisticated, outside support and regional coordination grew. Even so, the basic units of mujahideen organization and action continued to reflect the highly segmented nature of Afghan society.&lt;ref name="loc1"&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+af0101) The Path to Victory and Chaos: 1979–92 – Library of Congress country studies](Retrieved Thursday 31, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Olivier Roy (professor)|Olivier Roy]] estimates that after four years of war, there were at least 4,000 bases from which mujahideen units operated. Most of these were affiliated with the seven expatriate parties headquartered in Pakistan, which served as sources of supply and varying degrees of supervision. Significant commanders typically led 300 or more men, controlled several bases and dominated a district or a sub-division of a province. Hierarchies of organization above the bases were attempted. Their operations varied greatly in scope, the most ambitious being achieved by [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]] of the [[Panjshir valley]] north of [[Kabul]]. He led at least 10,000 trained troopers at the end of the Soviet war and had expanded his political control of [[Tajiks|Tajik]]-dominated areas to Afghanistan's northeastern provinces under the Supervisory Council of the North.&lt;ref name="loc1" /&gt;

Roy also describes regional, ethnic and sectarian variations in mujahideen organization. In the [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] areas of the east, south and southwest, tribal structure, with its many rival sub-divisions, provided the basis for military organization and leadership. Mobilization could be readily linked to traditional fighting allegiances of the tribal ''lashkar'' (fighting force). In favorable circumstances such formations could quickly reach more than 10,000, as happened when large Soviet assaults were launched in the eastern provinces, or when the mujahideen besieged towns, such as [[Khost]] in [[Paktia]] province in July 1983.&lt;ref&gt;The siege was ended only in November 1987 through the conduct of Operation Magistal'&lt;/ref&gt; But in campaigns of the latter type the traditional explosions of manpower—customarily common immediately after the completion of harvest—proved obsolete when confronted by well dug-in defenders with modern weapons. Lashkar durability was notoriously short; few sieges succeeded.&lt;ref name="loc1"/&gt;

Mujahideen mobilization in non-Pashtun regions faced very different obstacles. Prior to the intervention, few non-Pashtuns possessed firearms. Early in the war they were most readily available from army troops or [[gendarmerie]] who defected or were ambushed. The international arms market and foreign military support tended to reach the minority areas last. In the northern regions, little military tradition had survived upon which to build an armed resistance. Mobilization mostly came from political leadership closely tied to Islam. Roy contrasts the social leadership of religious figures in the [[Persian language|Persian]]- and [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]-speaking regions of Afghanistan with that of the Pashtuns. Lacking a strong political representation in a state dominated by Pashtuns, minority communities commonly looked to pious learned or charismatically revered ''[[pir (Sufism)|pirs]]'' (saints) for leadership. Extensive [[Sufi]] and [[maraboutic]] networks were spread through the minority communities, readily available as foundations for leadership, organization, communication and indoctrination. These networks also provided for political mobilization, which led to some of the most effective of the resistance operations during the war.&lt;ref name="loc1" /&gt;

The mujahideen favoured [[sabotage]] operations. The more common types of sabotage included damaging [[electric power transmission|power lines]], knocking out [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] and radio stations, blowing up government [[office building]]s, [[air terminal]]s, hotels, cinemas, and so on. In the border region with Pakistan, the mujahideen would often launch 800 [[rocket]]s per day. Between April 1985 and January 1987, they carried out over 23,500 [[shell (projectile)|shelling]] attacks on government targets. The mujahideen surveyed firing positions that they normally located near villages within the range of Soviet artillery posts, putting the villagers in danger of death from Soviet retaliation. The mujahideen used [[land mines]] heavily. Often, they would enlist the services of the local inhabitants, even children.
[[File:Mujahideen prayer in Shultan Valley Kunar, 1987.jpg|thumb|left|Mujahideen praying in Shultan Valley, 1987]]
They concentrated on both civilian and military targets, knocking out bridges, closing major roads, attacking [[convoy]]s, disrupting the electric power system and industrial production, and attacking police stations and Soviet military installations and air bases. They assassinated government officials and PDPA members, and laid siege to small rural [[outpost (civilian)|outposts]]. In March 1982, a bomb exploded at the [[Ministry (government department)|Ministry]] of Education, damaging several buildings. In the same month, a widespread [[power failure]] darkened Kabul when a pylon on the transmission line from the Naghlu power station was blown up. In June 1982 a column of about 1,000 young [[communist party]] members sent out to work in the Panjshir valley were ambushed within 30&amp;nbsp;km of Kabul, with heavy loss of life. On September 4, 1985, insurgents shot down a domestic Bakhtar Airlines plane as it took off from Kandahar airport, killing all 52 people aboard.

Mujahideen groups used for assassination had three to five men in each. After they received their mission to kill certain government officials, they busied themselves with studying his pattern of life and its details and then selecting the method of fulfilling their established mission. They practiced shooting at automobiles, [[drive by|shooting out of automobiles]], laying mines in government accommodation or houses, using poison, and rigging explosive charges in transport.
[[File:Afghanistan insurgency 1985.png|thumb|right|The areas where the different mujahideen forces operated in 1985]]
In May 1985, the seven principal rebel organizations formed the [[Seven Party Mujahideen Alliance]] to coordinate their military operations against the Soviet army. Late in 1985, the groups were active in and around Kabul, unleashing rocket attacks and conducting operations against the communist government.

International journalistic perception of the war varied. Major American television journalists were sympathetic to the mujahideen. Most visible was CBS news correspondent Dan Rather who in 1982 accused the Soviets of "genocide," comparing them to Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0403/040360.html Arthur Unger, "Dan Rather: more Soviet killing looms in Afghanistan" Christian Science Monitor APRIL 3, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather was [[Embedded journalism|embedded]] with the mujahideen for a [[60 Minutes]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1980/04/07/gunga-dan/88e47b5f-49cd-4934-ae0d-aedda4a9d282/ Tom Shales, "Gunga Dan"  Washington Post, April 7, 1980]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, CBS produced a full documentary special on the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1989-10-05/news/mn-926_1_cbs-evening-news Jane Hall, "Cameraman, CBS Deny Afghanistan Scenes Were Faked" The Los Angeles Times, October 05, 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; A retrospective commentary for [[Niemen Reports]] criticized mainstream television for biased presentation of a "[[Rambo III|Ramboesque]] struggle of holy warriors against the evil empire." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&amp;backgroundid=411 Paul Fitzgerald and Elizabeth Gould, "A history of failed press coverage of Afghanistan" The Nieman Watchdog, Oct 27, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Reader's Digest]]'' took a highly positive view of the mujahideen, a reversal of their usual view of Islamic fighters. The publication praised their martyrdom and their role in entrapping the Soviets in a Vietnam War-style disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joanne P.

At least some, such as leftist journalist [[Alexander Cockburn]], were unsympathetic, criticizing Afghanistan as "an unspeakable country filled with unspeakable people, sheepshaggers and smugglers, who have furnished in their leisure hours some of the worst arts and crafts ever to penetrate the occidental world. I yield to none in my sympathy to those prostrate beneath the Russian jackboot, but if ever a country deserved rape it's Afghanistan."&lt;ref name=Robin-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robin|first1=Corey|title=Radical writer Alexander Cockburn dead at 71|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2012/07/201272310391240304.html|accessdate=16 July 2015|agency=Al jazeera|date=23 Jul 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert D. Kaplan]] on the other hand, thought any perception of mujahideen as "barbaric" was unfair: "Documented accounts of mujahidin savagery were relatively rare and involved enemy troops only. Their cruelty toward civilians was unheard of during the war, while Soviet cruelty toward civilians was common."{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=120}} Lack of interest in the mujahideen cause, Kaplan believed, was not the lack of intrinsic interest to be found in a war between a small, poor country and a superpower were a million civilians were killed, but the result of the great difficulty and unprofitability of media coverage. Kaplan note that "none of the American TV networks had a bureau for a war",{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} and television cameramen venturing to follow the mujahideen "trekked for weeks on little food, only to return ill and half starved".{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=14}} In October 1984 the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, Vitaly Smirnov, told [[Agence France Presse]] "that journalists traveling with the mujahidin 'will be killed. And our units in Afghanistan will help the Afghan forces to do it.'"{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=10}} Unlike Vietnam and Lebanon, Afghanistan had "absolutely no clash between the strange and the familiar", no "rock-video quality" of "zonked-out GIs in headbands" or "rifle-wielding Shiite terrorists wearing Michael Jackson T-shirts" that provided interesting "visual materials" for newscasts.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=15}}

===1986: Stinger Missile and "Stinger effect"===
{{See also|List of Soviet aircraft losses during the Soviet–Afghan War}}
Whether the introduction of the personal, portable, infrared-homing surface-to-air "[[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]]" missile in September 1986 was a turning point in the war is disputed.
Many Western military analysts credit the Stinger with a kill ratio of about 70% and with responsibility for most of the over 350 Soviet or Afghan government aircraft and helicopters downed in the last two years of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Phillips|first=Michael M.|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204138204576598851109446780|title="Launching the Missile That Made History," by Michael M. Phillips, Wall Street Journal, October 1, 2011|publisher=wsj.com|accessdate=February 15, 2012|date=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some military analysts considered it a "game changer" coined the term "Stinger effect" to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schroeder|first=Matthew|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/28/The_Taliban_Doesn%E2%80%99t_Have_Stingers|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731223411/http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2010/07/28/The_Taliban_Doesn%E2%80%99t_Have_Stingers|archivedate=2010-07-31|title="Stop Panicking About the Stingers," by Matthew Schroeder, Foreign Policy, July 28, 2010|publisher=foreignpolicy.com|accessdate=February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to US Congressman [[Charlie Wilson (Texas politician)|Charlie Wilson]] who was instrumental in funding the Stingers for the Mujahideen, before the Stinger the Mujahideen never won a set piece battle with the Soviets but after it was introduced, the Mujahideen never again lost one.

However, these statistics are based on Mujahedin self-reporting, which is of unknown reliability. [[Selig Harrison]] rejects such figures, quoting a Russian general who claims the United States "greatly exaggerated" Soviet and Afghan aircraft losses during the war. According to Soviet figures, in 1987-1988, only 35 aircraft and 63 helicopters were destroyed by all causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hammerich | first = Helmut | title = Die Grenzen des Militärischen | publisher = Hartmann, Miles-Verl | location = Berlin | year = 2010 | isbn = 9783937885308 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hWuwxZeYsZQC&amp;pg=PA195 | page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pakistan Army]] fired twenty-eight Stingers at enemy aircraft without a single kill.&lt;ref name="dtic.mil"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a413880.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Stinger missile and U.S. intervention in Afghanistan |author=Alan J.

Many Russian military analysts tend to be dismissive of the impact to the Stinger.  According to [[Alan J. Kuperman]], Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev decided to withdraw from Afghanistan a year before the mujahideen fired their first Stinger missiles, motivated by U.S. sanctions, not military losses. The stingers did make an impact at first but within a few months flares, beacons, and exhaust baffles were installed to disorient the missiles, along with night operation and terrain-hugging tactics to prevent the rebels from getting a clear shot. By 1988, Kuperman states, the mujahideen had all but stopped firing them.&lt;ref name=Kuperman-2002-CFR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuperman|first1=Alan J.|title=Stinging Rebukes|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=January–February 2002|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/afghanistan/2002-01-01/stinging-rebukes|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source (Jonathan Steele) states that Stingers forced Soviet helicopters and ground attack planes to bomb from higher altitudes with less accuracy, but did not bring down many more aircraft than Chinese heavy machine guns and other less sophisticated antiaircraft weaponry.&lt;ref name=Steele-2010&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Steele|first1=Jonathan|title=Afghan Ghosts: American Myths|journal=World affairs journal|year=2010|url=http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/afghan-ghosts-american-myths|accessdate=16 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1983, Pakistan's [[Foreign Ministry of Pakistan|Foreign ministry]] began working with the [[Soviet Union]] to provide them an exit from the [[Afghanistan]], initiatives led by [[Foreign Minister of Pakistan|Foreign Minister]] [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Ali Khan]] and [[Khurshid Mahmud Kasuri|Khurshid Kasuri]]. Despite an active support for [[Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen|insurgent groups]], Pakistanis remained sympathetic to the challenges faced by the Russians in restoring the peace, eventually exploring the idea towards the possibility of setting-up the interim [[system of government]] under former [[King of Afghanistan|monarch]] [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]] but this was not authorized by President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]] due to his stance on issue of [[Durand line]].{{rp|247–248}}&lt;ref name="Yale University Press, Rubin"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rubin |first=Barnett R. |date=2002 |title=The Fragmentation of Afghanistan: State Formation and Collapse in the International System |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=laG03iJF7t8C&amp;pg=PA248 |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=248–|isbn=978-0-300-09519-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984–85, Foreign Minister [[Sahabzada Yaqub Khan|Yaqub Ali Khan]] paid state visits to China, [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Soviet Union]], France, United States and the United Kingdom in order to develop framework for the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]] which was signed in 1988 between Pakistan and Afghanistan.{{rp|335}}&lt;ref name="DIANE Publishing, Amstutz"&gt;{{cite book |last=Amstutz |first=J.

===April 1985 – January 1987: Exit strategy===
[[File:9thCompanyAwarded.png|thumb|Awards ceremony for the [[Battle for Hill 3234|9th Company]]]]
[[File:Evstafiev-Soviet-soldier-Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Soviet soldier in Afghanistan, 1988]]

The first step of the Soviet Union's exit strategy was to transfer the burden of fighting the mujahideen to the Afghan armed forces, with the aim of preparing them to operate without Soviet help. During this phase, the Soviet contingent was restricted to supporting the DRA forces by providing [[artillery]], air support and technical assistance, though some large-scale operations were still carried out by Soviet troops.

Under Soviet guidance, the DRA armed forces were built up to an official strength of 302,000 in 1986. To minimize the risk of a coup d'état, they were divided into different branches, each modeled on its Soviet counterpart. The ministry of defence forces numbered 132,000, the ministry of interior 70,000 and the ministry of state security ([[KHAD]]) 80,000. However, these were theoretical figures: in reality each service was plagued with [[desertion]]s, the army alone suffering 32,000 per year.

The decision to engage primarily Afghan forces was taken by the Soviets, but was resented by the PDPA, who viewed the departure of their protectors without enthusiasm. In May 1987 a DRA force attacked well-entrenched mujahideen positions in the [[Arghandab District]], but the mujahideen held their ground, and the attackers suffered heavy casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; In the spring of 1986, an offensive into [[Paktia Province]] briefly occupied the mujahideen base at [[Battles of Zhawar|Zhawar]] only at the cost of heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grau, Lester &amp; [[Ali Ahmad Jalali|Jalali, Ali Ahmad]]|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/2001/010900-zhawar.htm|title=The campaign for the caves: the battles for Zhawar in the Soviet-Afghan War|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=March 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the mujahideen benefited from expanded foreign military support from the United States, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and other Muslim nations. The US tended to favor the Afghan resistance forces led by [[Ahmed Shah Massoud]], and US support for Massoud's forces increased considerably during the [[Reagan administration]] in what [[US military]] and [[CIA|intelligence]] forces called "[[Operation Cyclone]]". Primary advocates for supporting Massoud included two [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analysts, Michael Johns and James A.

===January 1987 – February 1989: Withdrawal===
{{Main|Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan}}
[[File:T-62 withdraws from Afghanistan.JPEG|thumb|Soviet [[T-62]]M main battle tank withdraws from Afghanistan]]

The arrival of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] on the scene in 1985 and his 'new thinking' on foreign and domestic policy was likely  an important factor in the Soviets' decision to withdraw. Gorbachev had been attempting to remove the Soviet Union from the economic stagnation that had set in, under the leadership of Premier Brezhnev, and reform the Soviet Union's economy and image across the board with [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]]. Gorbachev had also been attempting to ease cold war tensions by signing the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty]] in 1987 with the U.S. and withdrawing the troops from Afghanistan whose presence had garnered so much international condemnation. Gorbachev regarded confrontation with China and resulting military build ups on that border as one of Brezhnev's biggest mistakes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Beijing had stipulated that a normalization of relations would have to wait until Moscow withdrew its army from Afghanistan (among other things) and in 1989 the first Sino-Soviet summit in 30 years took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Gorbachev pressured his Cuban allies in Angola to scale down activities and withdraw even though Soviet allies were faring somewhat better there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Urban, Mark|title=War in Afghanistan|year=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|page= 300}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets also pulled many of their troops out of [[Mongolia]] in 1987 where they were also having a far easier time than in Afghanistan and restrained the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War|Vietnamese invasion of Kampuchea]] to the point of an all out withdrawal in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Maley, William  |author2=Saikal, Amin |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Soviet Withdrawal from Afghanistan|year=1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; This massive withdrawal of Soviet forces from such highly contested areas shows that the Soviet government's decision to leave Afghanistan was based upon a general change in Soviet foreign policy- from that of confrontation to avoidance of conflict wherever possible.

In the last phase, Soviet troops prepared and executed their withdrawal from Afghanistan, whilst limiting the launching of offensive operations by those who hadn't withdrawn yet.

By mid-1987 the Soviet Union announced that it would start withdrawing its forces. [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] was selected as the head of the Interim Islamic State of Afghanistan, in an attempt to reassert its legitimacy against the Moscow-sponsored Kabul regime. Mojaddedi, as head of the Interim Afghan Government, met with then Vice President of the United States [[George H. W. Bush]], achieving a critical diplomatic victory for the Afghan resistance. Defeat of the Kabul government was their solution for peace. This confidence, sharpened by their distrust of the United Nations, virtually guaranteed their refusal to accept a political compromise.

In September 1988, Soviet MiG-23 fighters shot down one Pakistani [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] and two Iranian [[Bell AH-1 SuperCobra|AH-1J Cobra]], who intruded in Afghan airspace.&lt;ref&gt;"The Aviation History", Florian Ion Petrescu, Relly Victoria Petrescu, 2012, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Operation Magistral]]'', has been one of the final offensive operations undertaken by the Soviets; a successful sweep operation that cleared the road between [[Gardez]] and [[Khost]]. This operation did not have any lasting effect on the outcome of the conflict nor the soiled political and military status of the Soviets in the eyes of the West, but was a symbolic gesture that marked the end of their widely condemned presence in the country with a victory.&lt;ref&gt;Isby, ''War in a Distant Country'', p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The first half of the Soviet contingent was withdrawn from May 15 to August 16, 1988 and the second from November 15 to February 15, 1989. In order to ensure a safe passage the Soviets had negotiated ceasefires with local mujahideen commanders, so the withdrawal was generally executed peacefully,&lt;ref&gt;Urban, ''War in Afghanistan'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; except for the operation "Typhoon".

After the withdrawal of the Soviets the DRA forces were left fighting alone and had to abandon some provincial capitals, and it was widely believed that they would not be able to resist the mujahideen for long. However, in the spring of 1989 DRA forces inflicted a sharp defeat on the mujahideen at [[Jalalabad]].

The government of President Karmal, a [[puppet regime]], was largely ineffective. It was weakened by divisions within the PDPA and the Parcham faction, and the regime's efforts to expand its base of support proved futile. Moscow came to regard Karmal as a failure and blamed him for the problems. Years later, when Karmal's inability to consolidate his government had become obvious, Mikhail Gorbachev, then General Secretary of the [[Soviet Communist Party]], said:

{{quote|The main reason that there has been no national consolidation so far is that Comrade Karmal is hoping to continue sitting in Kabul with our help.}}

In November 1986, [[Mohammad Najibullah]], former chief of the Afghan [[secret police]] ([[KHAD]]), was elected president and a new constitution was adopted.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} He also introduced in 1987 a policy of "national reconciliation," devised by experts of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and later used in other regions of the world.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Despite high expectations, the new policy neither made the Moscow-backed Kabul regime more popular, nor did it convince the insurgents to negotiate with the ruling government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Informal negotiations for a Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan had been underway since 1982.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In 1988, the governments of Pakistan and Afghanistan, with the United States and Soviet Union serving as guarantors, signed an agreement settling the major differences between them known as the [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]]. The United Nations set up a special [[United Nations Good Offices Mission in Afghanistan and Pakistan|Mission]] to oversee the process. In this way, Najibullah had stabilized his political position enough to begin matching Moscow's moves toward withdrawal. On July 20, 1987, the withdrawal of Soviet troops from the country was announced. The withdrawal of Soviet forces was planned out by Lt. Gen. [[Boris Gromov]], who, at the time, was the commander of the [[40th Army]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Among other things the Geneva accords identified the US and Soviet non-intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan and Afghanistan and a timetable for full Soviet withdrawal. The agreement on withdrawal held, and on February 15, 1989, the last Soviet troops departed on schedule from Afghanistan.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Impact==

===International reaction===
President [[Jimmy Carter]] placed a trade [[embargo]] against the Soviet Union on shipments of commodities such as grain. This resulted in newly increased tensions between the two nations. On top of recently sparked apprehensions in the West directed toward the tens of thousands of Soviet troops which were of close proximity to oil-rich regions in the [[Persian Gulf]], the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan effectively brought about the end of [[détente]].

The international diplomatic response was severe, ranging from stern warnings from the UN to a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|US-led boycott]] of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]]. The intervention, along with other events, such as the [[Iranian revolution]] and the US hostage stand-off that accompanied it, the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[1982 Lebanon War]] and the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India, contributed to the volatility of the Middle East and South Asian regions in the 1980s.

The [[Non-Aligned Movement]] was sharply divided between those who believed the Soviet deployment to be a legitimate police action and others who considered the deployment an illegal invasion. Among the [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, the intervention was condemned only by [[Communist Romania|Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/ceausescu.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030919012700/http://www.moreorless.au.com/killers/ceausescu.html|archivedate=2003-09-19|title=Nicolae Andruta Ceausescu|publisher=Moreorless.au.com|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; India, a close ally of the Soviet Union, refused to support the Afghan war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=evtXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wvYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6840,1286312&amp;dq=india+afghanistan&amp;hl=en|title=The Bulletin – Google News Archive Search|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; though by the end of the hostilities, offered to provide humanitarian assistance to the Afghan government.&lt;ref name="nytimes1989"&gt;{{cite news|last=CROSSETTE|first=BARBARA|title=India to Provide Aid to Government in Afghanistan|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/07/world/india-to-provide-aid-to-government-in-afghanistan.html|accessdate=December 5, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 7, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=van Dijk|first=Ruud|title=Encyclopedia of the Cold War, Volume 1|year=2008|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-97515-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=July 2012}}

The US was also worried about the USSR gaining access to the Indian Ocean by coming to an arrangement with Pakistan.  (The Soviet air base outside of [[Kandahar]] was "30 minutes flying time by strike aircraft or naval bomber" to the Persian Gulf according to Robert Kaplan.

National Security Advisor [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], known for his hardline policies on the Soviet Union, initiated in 1979 a campaign supporting mujahideen in Pakistan and [[Afghanistan]], which was run by [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani security services]] with financial support from the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and Britain's [[MI6]].&lt;ref name="Brzezinski"/&gt; Years later, in a 1997 [[CNN]]/[[National Security Archive]] interview, Brzezinski detailed the strategy taken by the Carter administration against the Soviets in 1979:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We immediately launched a twofold process when we heard that the Soviets had entered Afghanistan. The first involved direct reactions and [[International sanctions|sanctions]] focused on the Soviet Union, and both the State Department and the National Security Council prepared long lists of sanctions to be adopted, of steps to be taken to increase the international costs to the Soviet Union of their actions. And the second course of action led to my going to Pakistan a month or so after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, for the purpose of coordinating with the Pakistanis a joint response, the purpose of which would be to make the Soviets bleed for as much and as long as is possible; and we engaged in that effort in a collaborative sense with the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudis]], the Egyptians, the British, the Chinese, and we started providing weapons to the Mujaheddin, from various sources again – for example, some Soviet arms from the Egyptians and the Chinese. We even got Soviet arms from the [[Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] communist government, since it was obviously susceptible to material incentives; and at some point we started buying arms for the Mujaheddin from the Soviet army in Afghanistan, because that army was increasingly corrupt.&lt;ref name="Full Text of Interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000829032721/http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski1.html|archivedate=2000-08-29|title=Full Text of Interview|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The supplying of billions of dollars in arms to the Afghan mujahideen militants was one of the CIA's longest and most expensive covert operations.&lt;ref name="time.com"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=''Time''|date= May 13, 2003|title= The Oily Americans|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,450997-2,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA provided assistance to the fundamentalist insurgents through the Pakistani secret services, [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI), in a program called [[Operation Cyclone]]. At least 3 billion in U.S. dollars were funneled into the country to train and equip troops with weapons. Together with similar programs by Saudi Arabia, Britain's [[MI6]] and [[Special Air Service|SAS]], Egypt, Iran, and the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref name="gwu.edu"&gt;[http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/coldwar/interviews/episode-17/brzezinski2.html Interview with Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski] – (June 13, 1997).

Pakistan's ''ISI'' and [[Special Service Group]] (SSG) were actively involved in the conflict. The SSG are widely suspected of participating in [[Battle for Hill 3234|Operation Hill 3234]], near the Pakistani border where nearly 200 suspected SSG personnel were killed in a futile attempt to assault the Soviet held hill.

The theft of large sums of aid spurred Pakistan's economic growth, but along with the war in general had devastating side effects for that country. The siphoning off of aid weapons, in which the weapons logistics and coordination were put under the [[Pakistan Navy]] in the [[Karachi Port|port city]] of [[Karachi]], contributed to disorder and violence there, while heroin entering from Afghanistan to pay for arms contributed to addiction problems.&lt;ref&gt;Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002), pp. 143–4&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy went into covert war and coordinated the foreign weapons into Afghanistan, while some of its high-ranking admirals were responsible for storing the weapons in the Navy depot, later coordinated the weapons supply to mujahideen.

In retaliation for Pakistan's assistance to the insurgents, the [[KHAD]] Afghan security service, under leader [[Mohammad Najibullah]], carried out (according to the [[Mitrokhin Archive]]s and other sources) a large number of operations against Pakistan. In 1987, 127 incidents resulted in 234 deaths in Pakistan. In April 1988, an ammunition depot outside the Pakistani capital of [[Islamabad]] was blown up killing 100 and injuring more than 1000 people. The KHAD and [[KGB]] were suspected in the perpetration of these acts.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=12}} Soviet and Afghan fighters and bombers occasionally bombed Pakistani villages along the Pakistani-Afghan border. These attacks are known to have caused at least 300 civilian deaths and extensive damage. Sometimes they got involved in shootings with the Pakistani jets defending the airspace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/02/world/afghans-down-a-pakistani-f-16-saying-fighter-jet-crossed-border.html|work=The New York Times|title=Afghans Down A Pakistani F-16, Saying Fighter Jet Crossed Border|first=Steven R.|last=Weisman|date=May 2, 1987|accessdate=March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan took in millions of [[Afghan refugee]]s (mostly Pashtun) fleeing the Soviet occupation. Although the [[refugee]]s were controlled within Pakistan's largest province, [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] under then-[[martial law]] ruler General [[Rahimuddin Khan]], the influx of so many refugees – believed to be the largest refugee population in the world &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA110161999|title=Amnesty International - Library - Afghanistan: Refugees from Afghanistan: The world's largest single refugee group|date=2003-07-11|access-date=2018-05-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030711014619/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA110161999|archivedate=July 11, 2003|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;– spread into several other regions.

All of this had a heavy impact on Pakistan and its effects continue to this day. Pakistan, through its support for the mujahideen, played a significant role in the eventual withdrawal of Soviet military personnel from Afghanistan.

During the [[Sino-Soviet split]], strained relations between China and the USSR resulted in bloody border clashes and mutual backing for the opponent's enemies. China and Afghanistan had neutral relations with each other during the King's rule. When the pro-Soviet Afghan Communists seized power in Afghanistan in 1978, relations between China and the Afghan communists quickly turned hostile. The Afghan pro-Soviet communists supported China's then-enemy Vietnam and blamed China for supporting Afghan anticommunist militants. China responded to the Soviet war in Afghanistan by supporting the [[Afghan mujahideen]] and ramping up their military presence near Afghanistan in Xinjiang. China acquired military equipment from America to defend itself from Soviet attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starriditor=S.

The Chinese [[People's Liberation Army]] trained and supported the Afghan mujahideen during the war. The training camps were moved from Pakistan into China itself. Anti-aircraft missiles, rocket launchers and machine guns, valued at hundreds of millions, were given to the mujahideen by the Chinese. Chinese military advisors and army troops were present with the Mujahidin during training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Frederick Starr|year=2004|edition=illustrated|publisher=M.E.

===Soviet personnel strengths and casualties===
[[File:RIAN archive 476785 Soviet Army soldiers return from Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|Soviet soldiers return from Afghanistan, October 1986]]
[[File:AfghanAirForce1.jpg|thumb|Afghans commemorating [[Mujahideen Victory Day]]]]

Between December 25, 1979, and February 15, 1989, a total of 620,000{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} soldiers served with the forces in Afghanistan (though there were only 80,000–104,000 serving at one time): 525,000 in the Army, 90,000 with border troops and other [[KGB]] sub-units, 5,000 in independent formations of [[MVD]] [[Internal Troops]], and police forces. A further 21,000 personnel were with the Soviet troop contingent over the same period doing various white collar and blue collar jobs.

The total irrecoverable personnel losses of the Soviet Armed Forces, frontier, and internal security troops came to 14,453. Soviet Army formations, units, and HQ elements lost 13,833, KGB sub-units lost 572, MVD formations lost 28, and other ministries and departments lost 20 men. During this period 312 servicemen were missing in action or taken prisoner; 119 were later freed, of whom 97 returned to the USSR and 22 went to other countries.

Of the troops deployed, 53,753 were wounded, injured, or sustained concussion and 415,932 fell sick. A high proportion of casualties were those who fell ill. This was because of local climatic and sanitary conditions, which were such that acute infections spread rapidly among the troops. There were 115,308 cases of infectious [[hepatitis]], 31,080 of [[typhoid]] fever, and 140,665 of other diseases. Of the 11,654 who were discharged from the army after being wounded, maimed, or contracting serious diseases, 10,751 men, were left disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=G.

===Use of chemical weapons===
There have also been numerous reports of chemical weapons being used by Soviet forces in Afghanistan, often indiscriminately against civilians.&lt;ref name="Report from Afghanistan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 20671950|title = Chemical Warfare in Afghanistan: An Independent Assessment|last = Schwartzstein|first = Stuart j. d.|date = Winter 1982–83|journal = World Affairs|doi = |pmid =|volume=145|pages=267–272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft7b69p12h&amp;chunk.id=ch013&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch013&amp;brand=eschol The Story of Genocide in Afghanistan] Hassan Kakar&lt;/ref&gt; A declassified CIA report from 1982 states that between 1979 and 1982 there were 43 separate chemical weapons attacks which caused more than 3000 deaths.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000284013.pdf|title = Use of toxins and other lethal agents in Southeast Asia and Afghanistan|date = 2 February 1982|accessdate = 21 October 2014|website = |publisher = CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; By early 1980, attacks with chemical weapons were reported in "all areas with concentrated resistance activity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Causes of withdrawal===
Some of the causes of the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan leading to the Afghanistan regime's eventual defeat include&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fremont-Barnes|first1=Gregory|title=The Soviet–Afghan War 1979–89|date=2012|publisher=Osprey Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LH55BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT89|isbn=978-1-4728-1038-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Soviet Army of 1980 was trained and equipped for large scale, conventional warfare in Central Europe against a similar opponent, i.e. it used armored and motor-rifle formations. This was notably ineffective against small scale guerrilla groups using hit-and-run tactics in the rough terrain of Afghanistan.  The large Red Army formations weren't mobile enough to engage small groups of Muj fighters that easily merged back into the terrain.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt; The set strategy also meant that troops were discouraged from "tactical initiative", essential in counter insurgency, because it "tended to upset operational timing".&lt;ref name=Grau-201/&gt;
* The Russians used large scale offensives against Mujahideen strongholds, such as in the Panjshir Valley, which temporarily clearing those sectors and killed many civilians in addition to enemy combatants. The biggest shortcoming here was the fact that once the Russians did engage the enemy in force, they failed to hold the ground by withdrawing once their operation was completed. The killing of civilians further alienated the population from the Soviets, with bad long-term effects.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt;
* The Soviets didn't have enough men to fight a counter-insurgency war (COIN),&lt;ref name=Grau-201&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grau|first1=Lester W.|title=The Bear Went Over the Mountain: Soviet Combat Tactics in Afghanistan|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing. |pages=201–2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=yOtThPNqKP8C&amp;pg=PA197|isbn=978-0-7881-4665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their troops were not motivated. The peak number of Soviet troops during the war was 115,000. The bulk of these troops were conscripts, which led to poor combat performance in their Motor-Rifle Formations. However, the Russians did have their elite infantry units, such as the famed Spetsnaz, the VDV, and their recon infantry. The problem with their elite units was not combat effectiveness, but the fact that there were not enough of them and that they were employed incorrectly.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt;
* Intelligence gathering, essential for successful COIN, was inadequate. The Soviets over-relied on less-than-accurate aerial recon and radio intercepts rather than their recon infantry and special forces. Although their special forces and recon infantry units performed very well in combat against the Mujahideen, they would have better served in intelligence gathering.&lt;ref name=Fremont-Barnes/&gt;
* The concept of a "war of national liberation" against a Soviet-sponsored "revolutionary" regime was so alien to the Soviet dogma, the leadership could not "come to grips" with it. This led to, among other things, a suppression by the Soviet media for several years of the truth how bad the war was going, which caused a backlash when it was unable to hide it further.&lt;ref name=Grau-201/&gt;

===Destruction in Afghanistan===

Civilian death and destruction from the war was considerable.
Estimates of Afghan civilian deaths vary from 562,000&lt;ref name="562k"/&gt; to 2,000,000.&lt;ref name="Khalidi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sliwinski"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 5–10 million Afghans fled to Pakistan and Iran, 1/3 of the prewar population of the country, and another 2 million were displaced within the country. In the 1980s, half of all refugees in the world were Afghan.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=11}}

[[Felix Ermacora]], the [[UN Special Rapporteur]] to Afghanistan, said that heavy fighting in combat areas cost the lives of more than 35,000 civilians in 1985, 15,000 in 1986, and around 14,000 in 1987.  [[R.J.

[[Irrigation]] systems, crucial to agriculture in Afghanistan's [[arid climate]], were destroyed by [[strategic bombing|aerial bombing]] and [[strafing]] by Soviet or government forces. In the worst year of the war, 1985, well over half of all the farmers who remained in Afghanistan had their fields bombed, and over one quarter had their irrigation systems destroyed and their livestock shot by Soviet or government troops, according to a survey conducted by Swedish relief experts{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=11}}

The population of Afghanistan's second largest city, Kandahar, was reduced from 200,000 before the war to no more than 25,000 inhabitants, following a months-long campaign of [[carpet bombing]] and [[bulldozing]] by the Soviets and Afghan communist soldiers in 1987.{{sfn|Kaplan|2008|p=188}} [[Land mine]]s had killed 25,000 Afghans during the war and another 10–15 million land mines, most planted by Soviet and government forces, were left scattered throughout the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mines Put Afghans in Peril on Return|first=Robert|last=Pear|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=August 14, 1988|page=9|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/world/mines-put-afghans-in-peril-on-return.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] estimated in 1994 that it would take 4,300 years to remove all the Soviet land mines in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-21061568/reversing-gun-sights-transnational.html |work=International Organization |title=Reversing the gun sights: transnational civil society targets land mines |date=June 22, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928001109/http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-21061568/reversing-gun-sights-transnational.html |archivedate=September 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of Soviet and Afghan government forces describe their effect on [[Afghan culture]] as working in three stages: first, the center of customary Afghan culture, Islam, was pushed aside; second, Soviet patterns of life, especially amongst the young, were imported; third, shared Afghan cultural characteristics were destroyed by the emphasis on so-called nationalities, with the outcome that the country was split into different ethnic groups, with no language, religion, or culture in common.&lt;ref&gt;Hauner, M. (1989). ''Afghanistan and the Soviet Union: Collision and Transformation''. Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press. (p.40)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geneva Accords (1988)|Geneva Accords]] of 1988, which ultimately led to the withdrawal of the Soviet forces in early 1989, left the Afghan government in ruins. The accords had failed to address adequately the issue of the post-occupation period and the future governance of Afghanistan. The assumption among most Western diplomats was that the Soviet-backed government in Kabul would soon collapse; however, this was not to happen for another three years. During this time the Interim Islamic Government of Afghanistan (IIGA) was established in exile. The exclusion of key groups such as refugees and [[Shia]]s, combined with major disagreements between the different mujahideen factions, meant that the IIGA never succeeded in acting as a functional government.&lt;ref&gt;Barakat, S. (2004). ''Reconstructing War-Torn Societies: Afghanistan''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan (p. 5)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:AfghanGuerillainUS1986e.JPEG|thumb|left|Afghan guerrillas that were chosen to receive medical treatment in the United States, [[Norton Air Force Base]], California, 1986]]
Before the war, Afghanistan was already one of the world's poorest nations. The prolonged conflict left Afghanistan ranked 170 out of 174 in the UNDP's ''Human Development Index'', making Afghanistan one of the least developed countries in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Barakat, S. (2004). ''Reconstructing War-Torn Societies: Afghanistan''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan (p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Soviets withdrew, US interest in Afghanistan slowly decreased over the following four years, much of it administered through the DoD Office of Humanitarian Assistance, under the then Director of HA, George M. Dykes III. With the first years of the Clinton Administration in Washington, DC, all aid ceased. The US decided not to help with reconstruction of the country, instead handing the interests of the country over to US allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Pakistan quickly took advantage of this opportunity and forged relations with [[warlord]]s and later the [[Taliban]], to secure trade interests and routes. The ten years following the war saw much ecological and agrarian destruction—from wiping out the country's trees through logging practices, which has destroyed all but 2% of forest cover country-wide, to substantial uprooting of wild [[pistachio]] trees for the exportation of their roots for therapeutic uses, to [[opium]] agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Panetta |first=L. |year=2007 |title=Collateral damage and the uncertainty of Afghanistan... |url=http://www.opticalrealities.org/Afghanistan02/CollateralDamage.html |location=San Francisco |work=opticalrealities.org |accessdate=August 17, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090922015906/http://www.opticalrealities.org/Afghanistan02/CollateralDamage.html |archivedate=September 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Tarlan Eyvazov, a soldier in the Soviet forces during the war, stated that the Afghan children's future is destined for war. Eyvazov said, "Children born in Afghanistan at the start of the war... have been brought up in war conditions, this is their way of life." Eyvazov's theory was later strengthened when the Taliban movement developed and formed from orphans or refugee children who were forced by the Soviets to flee their homes and relocate their lives in Pakistan. The swift rise to power, from the young Taliban in 1996, was the result of the disorder and civil war that had warlords running wild because of the complete breakdown of law and order in Afghanistan after the departure of the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kirby|first= A. |year=2003|title= War has ruined Afghan environment|accessdate=November 27, 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/2704989.stm|work=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1122273|year=2002|author1=Bhutta|first1=Z.

==Aftermath==

===Weakening of the Soviet Union===
According to scholars Rafael Reuveny and Aseem Prakash, the war contributed to the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] by undermining the image of the Red Army as invincible, undermining Soviet legitimacy, and by creating new forms of political participation.

The war created a cleavage between the party and the military in the Soviet Union where the efficacy of using the Soviet military to maintain the USSR's overseas interests was now put in doubt. In the non-Russian republics, those interested in independence were emboldened by the army's defeat. In Russia the war created cleavage between the party and the military, changing the perceptions of leaders about the ability to put down anti-Soviet resistance militarily (as it had in [[Prague Spring#Invasion|Czechoslovakia in 1968]], [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]], and [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|East Germany in 1953]]). As the war was viewed as "a Russian war fought by non Russians against Afghans", outside of Russia it undermined the legitimacy of the Soviet Union as a trans-national political union. The war created new forms of political participation, in the form of new civil organizations of war veterans (Afghansti) which weakened the political hegemony of the communist party. It also started the transformation of the press/media which continued under [[glasnost]].&lt;ref name=REUVENY-1999/&gt;

===Civil war===
[[File:T-54A and T-55 at Bagram Air Base.jpg|thumb|left|Two Soviet [[T-55]] tanks left by the Soviet army during their withdrawal lie rusting in a field near [[Bagram Airfield]], in 2002]]
{{Main|Conflict in Afghanistan (1978–present)|Civil war in Afghanistan (1989–1992)}}
The war did not end with the withdrawal of the Soviet Army. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan deep in winter, with intimations of panic among Kabul officials. The Afghan mujahideen were poised to attack provincial towns and cities and eventually Kabul, if necessary. Najibullah's government, though failing to win popular support, territory, or international recognition, was able to remain in power until 1992.

Civil war between the Afghan army and mujahideen continued and about 400,000 Afghan civilians had lost their lives in the chaos and civil war of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.csmonitor.com/2001/0920/p1s3-wosc.html/(page)/4 Life under Taliban cuts two ways]". ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. September 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, until demoralized by the defections of its senior officers, the Afghan Army had achieved a level of performance it had never reached under direct Soviet tutelage. Kabul had achieved a stalemate that exposed the mujahideen's weaknesses, political and military. But for nearly three years, while Najibullah's government successfully defended itself against mujahideen attacks, factions within the government had also developed connections with its opponents.

According to Russian publicist [[Andrey Karaulov]], the main trigger for Najibullah losing power was Russia's refusal to sell oil products to Afghanistan in 1992 for political reasons (the new Yeltsin government did not want to support the former communists), which effectively triggered an embargo.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The defection of General [[Abdul Rashid Dostam]] and his Uzbek [[militia]], in March 1992, further undermined Najibullah's control of the state.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} In April, Najibullah and his communist government fell to the mujahideen, who replaced Najibullah with a new governing council for the country.

Grain production declined an average of 3.5% per year between 1978 and 1990 due to sustained fighting, instability in rural areas, prolonged drought, and deteriorated infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Soviet efforts to disrupt production in rebel-dominated areas also contributed to this decline. During the withdrawal of Soviet troops, Afghanistan's natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} Restoration of gas production has been hampered by internal strife and the disruption of traditional trading relationships following the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)#Dissolution of the USSR|dissolution of the Soviet Union]].

===Extremism and "blowback"===
Following the Soviet withdrawal, some of the foreign volunteers (including [[Osama bin Laden]]'s [[al-Qaeda]])&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-137/&gt;&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:8/&gt; and young Afghan refugees, went on to continue violent jihad in Afghanistan, Pakistan and abroad.  Some of the thousands of Afghan Arabs who left Afghanistan went on to become "capable leaders, religious ideologues and military commanders," who played "vital roles" as insurgents or terrorists in places such as [[Algeria]], Egypt, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Chechnya]].&lt;ref name=hafez&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hafez|first1=Mohammed M.|title=Jihad After Iraq: Lessons from the Arab Afghans Phenomenon|url=https://www.ctc.usma.edu/posts/jihad-after-iraq-lessons-from-the-arab-afghans-phenomenon|publisher=Combating Terrorism Center|accessdate=22 July 2015|date=March 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tens of thousands of Afghan refugee children in Pakistan were educated in [[Madrassas in Pakistan|madrasses]] "in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor", and went on to fill the ranks and leadership of the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan|Sipah-e-Sahaba]] in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:142-3&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002)]]: p.142-3&lt;/ref&gt; The groups embodied new varieties of [[Political Islam]] – "[[Salafi jihadism]]" among the foreign volunteers,&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-137/&gt;&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:8/&gt; and a "hybrid" [[Deobandi]] jihadism among the madrassa-educated.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:142-3"/&gt;

As many as 35,000 non-Afghan Muslim fighters went to Afghanistan between 1982 and 1992.&lt;ref name=Commins-174/&gt; Thousands more came and did not fight but attended schools with "former and future fighters".&lt;ref name="Commins-174"/&gt;
These "Afghan-Arabs" had a marginal impact on the jihad against the Soviets, but a much greater effect after the Soviets left and in other countries. (After the Soviets left, training continued and "tens of thousands" from "some 40 nations" came to prepare for armed insurrections "to bring the struggle back home".&lt;ref name=NYT-Weiner&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weiner;|first1=Tim|title=Blowback From the Afghan Battlefieldl|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/13/magazine/blowback-from-the-afghan-battlefield.html|accessdate=23 July 2015|agency=New York Times|date=March 13, 1994|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; )

The man instrumental not only in generating international support but also in inspiring these volunteers to travel to Afghanistan for the jihad was a Palestinian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] cleric, [[Abdullah Azzam]]. Touring the [[Muslim world]] and the United States, he inspired young Muslims with stories of miraculous deeds, such as mujahideen who defeated vast columns of Soviet troops virtually single-handedly, angels riding into battle on horseback, and falling bombs intercepted by birds.&lt;ref&gt;examples can be found in "The Signs of ar-Rahmaan in the Jihad of the Afghan," www.Islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=877&amp; accessed 2006, and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, "Abul-Mundhir ash-Shareef," www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=30&amp; accessed 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

When back in the volunteer camps and training centers that he helped set up around Peshawar, Pakistan, Azzam exercised a "strong influence."&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-145&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|date=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris.|page=145|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=978-1-84511-257-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He  preached the importance of jihad: "those who believe that Islam can flourish [and] be victorious without Jihad, fighting, and blood are deluded and have no understanding of the nature of this religion";&lt;ref name=Scheuer-68&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scheuer|first1=Michael|title=Through Our Enemies' Eyes: Osama Bin Laden, Radical Islam, and the Future of America|date=2002|publisher=Potomac Books|isbn=978-1-57488-967-3|page=68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMu742Y4tuMC&amp;pg=PA68}}&lt;/ref&gt; of not compromising: "Jihad and the rifle alone: no negotiations, no conferences and no dialogues";&lt;ref name=McGregor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGregor|first1=Andrew|title="Jihad and the Rifle Alone": 'Abdullah 'Azzam and the Islamist Revolution|journal=Journal of Conflict Studies|date=Fall 2003|volume=XXIII|issue=2|url=https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/jcs/article/view/219/377|accessdate=7 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that Afghanistan was only the beginning: jihad would "remain an individual obligation" for Muslims until all other formerly-Muslim lands—"[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Bukhara]], [[Lebanon]], [[Chad]], [[Eritrea]], [[Somalia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Burma]], [[South Yemen]], [[Tashkent]], [[Andalusia]]"—were reconquered.&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-147&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=147|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA145|isbn=978-1-84511-257-8|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The volunteers  also influenced each other. Many "unexpected" religious-political ideas resulted from the "cross-pollination"  during the "great gathering" of Islamists from dozens of countries in the camps and training centers.&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-137&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=137|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA145|quote=In the camps and training centers around Peshawar ...

[In this] great gathering of international Islamists ... many unexpected ideological cross fertilizations and grafts emerged.|isbn=978-1-84511-257-8|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; One in particular was a "variant of Islamist ideology based on armed struggle and extreme religious vigour", known as [[Salafi jihadism]].&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:8&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002)]]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Soviet Union fell shortly after their withdrawal from Afghanistan, the volunteers were "exultant",&lt;ref name=GKJTPI2002:10&gt;[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', (2002)]]: p.10&lt;/ref&gt; believing that—in the words of [[Osama bin Laden]]—the credit for "the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] ... goes to God and the mujahideen in Afghanistan ... the US had no mentionable role,"&lt;ref&gt;''Messages to the World'', 2006, p. 50. (March 1997 interview with Peter Arnett)&lt;/ref&gt; (Soviet economic troubles and United States aid to mujahideen notwithstanding). They eagerly sought to duplicate their jihad in other countries.&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:10"/&gt;

Three such countries were [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], [[Algerian Civil War|Algeria]] and [[Terrorism in Egypt#Attacks during the 1990s|Egypt]]. In Bosnia the Salafi jihadist Afghan Arabs fought against [[War in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb and Croat]] militias but failed to establish a Salafi state.

====Spread of extremism in Pakistan====
{{further|Sectarianism in Pakistan|War in North-West Pakistan}}
Among the approximately three million Afghan refugees in Pakistan, thousands of children were educated in madrasa boarding schools financed by aid from the US and Gulf monarchies. Since that aid was distributed according to the conservative Islamist ideological criteria of Pakistan's President [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] and Saudi Arabia (and ignoring native Afghan traditions), the schools were part of networks of the favored [[Hizb-e-Islami]] party and the Pakistan [[Deobandi]].&lt;ref name="GKJTPI2002:142-3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=TCA-92&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Crews,|editor1-first=Robert D.|editor2-last=Tarzi|editor2-first=Amin|title=The Taliban and the Crisis of Afghanistan|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press.|pages=92–93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wUEMBOA4BbsC&amp;pg=PA92|quote=Hizb-e Islami received the largest portion of U.S. assistance, which helped the group open ... a large network of religious schools, where Islamic extremism became an integral part of the curriculum. ....

Cut off from families and local traditions, the madrassa students were "educated to put Deobandi doctrines into action through obedience to the fatwas produced in the madrasses in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor." As the Afghan students came of age, they formed "the mainstay" of the [[Taliban]] in Afghanistan and of the anti-Shia [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan|Sipah-e-Sahaba]] Sunni terror group in Pakistan. But unlike the traditionally non-violent Deobandi, this "hybrid movement" embraced the violence of jihad, and unlike the Islamists of [[Hizb-e-Islami]] they were uninterested in "islamizing modernity" of western knowledge or in western knowledge at all.&lt;ref name=kepel-jihad-143&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|publisher=I.B.Tauris|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OLvTNk75hUoC&amp;pg=PA145|quote=refugee children taken in as boarders to the madrasses were "cut off from their families and traditional environments, [and]  ... crucially, ... were educated to put Deobandi doctrines into action through obedience to the fatwas produced in the madrasses in a spirit of conservatism and religious rigor.

Commemorating the intervention of December 25, 1979, in December 2009, veterans of the Soviet war in Afghanistan were honoured by the [[Duma]] or Parliament of the Russian Federation. On December 25, the lower house of the parliament defended the Soviet war in Afghanistan on the 30th anniversary of its start, and praised the veterans of the conflict.

==George Stott==
[[File:No 1 mill, Shaw 2004.jpg|thumb|Lily No.1 Mill, Shaw,George Stott]]
The only son of Joseph Stott, George was born in Oldham in 1876. He was educated at Mr Binns' Highfield Academy and [[Manchester Grammar School]]. On Joseph Stott's death in 1894 George Stott took over his father's practice, trading as Joseph Stott and Son.
George Stott adopted the triple brick arch system of flooring. His mills are known for their proportions and the meticulous detail of their facades. [[Manor Mill, Chadderton|Manor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1244330|desc= Manor Mill|accessdate= 6 January 2014  |mode=cs2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kent Mill, Chadderton|Kent]] Mills in Chadderton are two good examples. Another two are the Pine Mill and the Elm Mill (Newby). Stott designed mills in Ramleh Egypt and Brazil. He was a donor to the British Conservative Party. He died in December 1936.&lt;ref name="Oldham"/&gt;

==Abraham Henthorn Stott==
{{details|Stott and Sons}}
[[File:Reddish Mill 1.jpg|thumb|[[Houldsworth Mill, Reddish]], A H Stott, 1865]]
Abraham Henthorn Stott was born on 25 April 1822 in the parish of [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]]. He served a seven-year apprenticeship with [[Sir Charles Barry]], the architect of the [[Houses of Parliament]] and [[Manchester Art Gallery]]. He returned to Oldham in 1847 and founded the architectural practice of A H Stott and Sons, and was known for his innovative structural engineering. His brother Joseph Stott started his career here before leaving to start his own practice. After his retirement, the practice was renamed [[Stott and Sons]]. Three of his 9 children worked in the practice.&lt;ref name="Oldham"/&gt;{{Clear}}

==Philip Sydney Stott==
[[File:Dee Mill - Shaw.jpg|thumb|Dee Mill, Shaw,1907, P.S.Stott]]
{{Main|Philip Sydney Stott}}
Philip Sydney Stott (Sydney Stott) was the third son of A H Stott. He is regarded as Oldham's greatest architect. He established his own practice, P.S.Stott, in 1883. He was known as Sydney Stott until 1920, but adopted the title [[Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet|Sir Philip Stott]] on being made a baronet. He benefitted from the innovations made by his father and [[Edward Potts (architect)|Edward Potts]], another Oldham architect. His first mill design was for Chadderton Mill in 1885. Sydney designed 22 mills in Oldham and 55 elsewhere in Lancashire. His last design was the [[Maple Mill, Oldham|Maple No 2]] in 1915, The mills accounted for 44% of the increase in the spinning capacity of the county between 1887 and 1925, and for 40% of the new spindles laid down in Oldham between 1887 and 1914. His mills accounted for 9 million spindles.  He relied on the triple brick arches supported on steel beams favoured by George Stott, rather than concrete.

Stott was a Conservative and a freemason, he was president of the Oldham Lyceum and played rugby for Oldham Football Club. He held several directorships in the cotton-spinning industry. He moved to [[Stanton Court]], [[Gloucestershire]] (near [[Broadway, Worcestershire]]), in 1913, where he became a Justice of the Peace and, in 1925, High Sheriff of Gloucester. He died in 1937.&lt;ref name="Oldham"/&gt;

==James Stott==
James was a younger brother of Abraham Henthorn Stott, the son of James Stott. He set up a heating, ventilation, and catering equipment business that trades as ''Stotts of Oldham''.&lt;ref name="Schoterdijk"&gt;{{Harvnb|Holden|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abraham Stott and Son==
[[File:Osborne Mills, Chadderton 695142-by-Chris-Allen.jpg|thumb|Osborne Mills, Chadderton. No. 1 to the rear was by A H Stott (1873), extended (1891, 1900), No. 2 was by P S Stott (1912) both closed 1968.]]
Abraham Stott and Son, set up by Abraham Stott, a cousin of Abraham Henthorn Stott, was a cotton-spinning company operating Osborne mill. Abraham Stott had a reputation for fairness and was nicknamed 'Honest Abe'. He invested in a clipper ship that traded with the confederate forces during the [[cotton famine]]; it was captured by the Union forces.&lt;ref name="Family"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stott}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Evil Dead''''' is a 1981 American [[supernatural horror film]] written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and executive produced by Raimi and [[Bruce Campbell]], who also stars alongside [[Ellen Sandweiss]] and [[Betsy Baker]]. The film focuses on five college students vacationing in an isolated cabin in a remote wooded area. After they find an audio tape that releases a legion of [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s, members of the group suffer from [[demonic possession]], leading to increasingly gory mayhem. Raimi and the cast produced the [[short film]] ''[[Within the Woods]]'' as a "prototype" to build the interest of potential investors, which secured Raimi US$90,000 to produce ''The Evil Dead''. The film was shot on location in a remote cabin located in [[Morristown, Tennessee]], in a difficult filming process that proved extremely uncomfortable for the cast and crew.

The low-budget horror film attracted the interest of producer [[Irvin Shapiro]], who helped screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival]]. Horror author [[Stephen King]] gave a rave review of the film, which helped convince [[New Line Cinema]] to serve as its distributor. Though a modest commercial success in the United States, grossing just $2.4 million, it was a bigger success internationally, grossing more than $27 million for a worldwide gross of $29.4 million. Both early and later critical reception were universally positive and in the years since its release, ''The Evil Dead'' has developed a reputation as one of the largest [[cult film]]s and has been cited among the greatest horror films of all time. ''The Evil Dead'' launched the careers of Campbell and Raimi, who would collaborate on several films together throughout the years, including Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]].

The film has spawned a [[Evil Dead (franchise)|media franchise]], beginning with two [[sequel]]s written and directed by Raimi, ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' (1987) and ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' (1992), as well as video games, [[Army of Darkness (comics)|comic books]], and a television series. The film's protagonist [[Ash Williams]] (Campbell) is regarded as a cult icon. The fourth film, serving as reboot, remake and sequel, was titled ''[[Evil Dead (2013 film)|Evil Dead]]'' and was released in 2013. Raimi co-produced the film alongside Campbell and the franchise producer, [[Robert Tapert]]. As with the other films, the follow-up television series ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'' was created and produced by [[Sam Raimi|Sam]] and [[Ivan Raimi]], with Campbell also executive producing.

==Plot==
Five [[Michigan State University]] students—[[Ash Williams]], his girlfriend, Linda; Ash's sister, Cheryl; their friend Scott; and his girlfriend Shelly—are vacationing at an isolated cabin in rural [[Tennessee]]. On their first night there, Cheryl hears a faint, demonic voice telling her to "join us" just before her hand seems to become possessed and draw a picture of a book with a deformed face on its cover. Shaken and confused,  she decides not to mention the incident to the others.

When the trapdoor to the cellar mysteriously flies open during dinner, Ash and Scott go down to investigate and find the ''[[Necronomicon#In popular culture|Naturan Demanto]]'', a [[Sumer]]ian version of the Egyptian ''[[Book of the Dead]]'', along with a [[tape recorder]] belonging to the archaeologist who owned it. Scott plays plays a tape of the archaeologist reciting a series of [[incantation]]s that resurrect a mysterious, demonic entity. Agitated, Cheryl goes outside to investigate strange noises she hears. In the woods, she is raped by [[Demonic possession|demonically possessed]] trees. When she returns to the cabin bruised and anguished, Ash agrees to take her into town for the night. However, they soon discovers that the bridge to the cabin has been destroyed. Back at the cabin, Ash listens to more of the tape, learning that the only way to kill the entity is to dismember the body when it possesses a host. Cheryl succumbs to the entity and attacks the others, stabbing Linda in the ankle with a pencil before Scott is able to lock her in the cellar.

Shelly becomes possessed as well, forcing Scott to chop up her body with an axe and bury the remains. Shaken by the experience, he leaves to find a way back to town but soon returns mortally wounded; he dies while warning Ash that the trees will not let them escape alive. When Ash goes to check on Linda, he is horrified to find that she too has become possessed by the demon. She attacks him, but he stabs her with a Sumerian dagger. Unwilling to dismember her, he buries her instead. But when she revives and attacks him, he is forced to decapitate her. 

Back in the cabin, Ash is attacked by Cheryl—who has escaped the cellar—and the reanimated Scott. Ash manages to throw the Naturan Demanto into the fireplace. As the book burns, Scott and Cheryl gruesomely decompose, leaving the disgusted Ash covered in their blood and entrails. As day breaks, Ash stumbles outside. While still standing outside, the entity attacks him from behind, causing Ash to turn and scream.

[[File:Sam Raimi by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=A man sitting next to a microphone placed on a table.|[[Sam Raimi]] directed the short film ''[[Within the Woods]]'' to generate the interest of investors for ''The Evil Dead''. |thumb|right|upright]]

===Background and writing===
Raimi and Campbell grew up together, and have been friends from an early age.&lt;ref name="early2"&gt;[[#Winston Dixon|Winston Dixon (2010)]], p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; The duo directed several low-budget [[Super 8 mm film]] projects together.&lt;ref name="early"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Several were comedies, including ''[[Clockwork (film)|Clockwork]]'' and ''[[It's Murder!]]''.&lt;ref name="def"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; Shooting a suspense scene in ''It's Murder!'' inspired Raimi to approach a career in the horror genre, and after researching horror cinema at [[drive-in theater]]s, Raimi was set on directing a horror film. The idea was to shoot a short film first, which would attract the interest of producers, and then use the money gained from that to shoot a full-length project.&lt;ref name="writing"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="becker"&gt;[[#Becker|Becker (2002)]], p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; The [[short film]] that Raimi created was called ''[[Within the Woods]]''.&lt;ref name="proto"&gt;[[#Lamberson|Lamberson (2008)]], p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced for $1,600, but for ''The Evil Dead'', Raimi needed over $100,000.&lt;ref name="money"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;85–88&lt;/ref&gt;

To generate funds for the film, Raimi approached Phil Gillis, a lawyer to one of his friends.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reinforced"/&gt; Raimi showed him ''Within the Woods'', and although Gillis was not impressed by the short film, he offered Raimi legal advice on how to produce ''The Evil Dead''. With his advice in mind, Raimi asked a variety of people for donations, and even eventually "begged" some.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; Campbell had to ask several of his own family members, and Raimi asked every individual he thought might be interested.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt; He eventually raised enough money to produce a full-length film, though not the full amount he originally wanted.&lt;ref name="money"/&gt;

With enough money to produce the film, Raimi and Campbell set out to make what was then titled ''Book of the Dead'', a name inspired by Raimi's interest in the fiction of [[H. P. Lovecraft]].&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thingstoknow"/&gt; The film was supposed to be a remake of ''Within the Woods'', with higher production values and a full-length running time. Raimi turned 20 just before shooting began, and he considered the project his "[[rite of passage]]".&lt;ref name="ninety five"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Betsy Baker, Ellen Sandweiss, and Theresa Tilly.jpg|thumb|[[Betsy Baker]], [[Ellen Sandweiss]], and [[Theresa Tilly]] in 2009]]
Raimi asked for help and assistance from several of his friends and past collaborators to make ''The Evil Dead''.&lt;ref name="ninety five"/&gt; Campbell was cast as [[Ash Williams]], the main character.&lt;ref name="EVIL2"&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;23–24&lt;/ref&gt; To acquire more actors for the project, Raimi put an ad in ''[[The Detroit News]]''. [[Betsy Baker]] was one of the actresses who responded, and [[Ellen Sandweiss]], who appeared in ''Within the Woods'', was also cast.&lt;ref name="ninety five"/&gt; The crew consisted almost entirely of Raimi and Campbell's friends and family. The make-up adviser for ''Within the Woods'', Tom Sullivan, was brought on to compose the effects after expressing a positive reaction to working with Raimi.&lt;ref name="EVIL2"/&gt;

Without any formal assistance from location scouts, the cast had to find filming locations on their own. The crew initially attempted to shoot the film in Raimi's hometown of [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], but instead chose [[Morristown, Tennessee]], as it was the only state that expressed enthusiasm for the project. The crew quickly found a remote cabin located several miles away from any other buildings.  During pre-production, the 13 crew members had to stay at the cabin, leading to several people sleeping in the same room. The living conditions were notoriously difficult, with several arguments breaking out between crew members.&lt;ref name="cabin"/&gt;

Steve Frankel was the only carpenter on set, which made him the art direction's sole contributor.&lt;ref name="weird"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;93–94&lt;/ref&gt; For exterior shots, Frankel had to produce several elaborate props with a circular saw. Otherwise, the cabin mostly remained the way it was found during production. The cabin had no plumbing, but phone lines were connected to it.&lt;ref name="cabin"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;96–98&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Principal cinematography===
Because of the crew's inexperience, filming was a "comedy of errors".&lt;ref name="errors"/&gt; The first day of filming led to them getting lost in the woods during a scene shot on a bridge.&lt;ref name="errors"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Several crew members were injured during the shoot, and because of the cabin's remoteness, securing medical assistance was difficult.&lt;ref name="reinforced2"&gt;[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;419–422&lt;/ref&gt; One notably gruesome moment on set involved ripping off Baker's eyelashes during removal of her face-mask.&lt;ref name="weird"/&gt; Because of the low budget, contact lenses as thick as glass had to be applied to the actors to achieve the "demonic eyes" effect.&lt;ref name="weird"/&gt; The lenses took 10 minutes to apply, and could only be left on for about 15 minutes because eyes could not "breathe" with them applied.&lt;ref name="weird"/&gt; Campbell later commented that to get the effect of wearing these lenses, they had to put "[[Tupperware]]" over their eyes.&lt;ref name="weird"/&gt;

Raimi developed a sense of ''[[mise en scène]]'', coming up with ideas for scenes at a fast rate.&lt;ref name="reinforced"/&gt; He had drawn several crude illustrations to help him break down the flow of scenes. The crew was surprised when Raimi began using [[dutch angle]]s during shots to build atmosphere during scenes.&lt;ref name="raimi"/&gt; To accommodate Raimi's style of direction, several elaborate, low-budget rigs had to be built, since the crew could not afford a [[camera dolly]]. One involved the "vas-o-cam", which relied on a mounted camera that was slid down long wooden platforms to create a more fluid sense of motion.&lt;ref name="raimi"/&gt;

[[File:WW Chicago 2015 - Evil Dead 15 (21037548012).jpg|Sam Raimi's brother [[Ted Raimi]] was the "[[fake shemp]]" in several scenes.|thumb|left|upright]]

A camera trick used to emulate a [[Steadicam]] inexpensively was the "[[shaky camera|shaky cam]]", which involved mounting the camera to a piece of wood and having two camera operators sprint around the swamp.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/454928-low-budget-camera-tech-sam-raimis-evil-dead/|title=The Low Budget Camera Tech of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead|author=Konow, David|date=2013-04-18|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During scenes involving the unseen force in the woods watching the characters, Raimi had to run through the woods with the makeshift rig, jumping over logs and stones.&lt;ref name="raimi"/&gt; This often proved difficult due to mist in the swamp.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; The film's final scene was shot with the camera mounted to a bike, while it was quickly driven through the cabin to create a seamless [[long take]].&lt;ref name="raimi"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p.&amp;nbsp;102–103&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi had been a big fan of ''[[The Three Stooges]]'' franchise during his youth, and it inspired him to use "[[Fake Shemp]]s" during production.&lt;ref name="def"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reinforced"&gt;[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;412–413&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; In any scene that required a background shot of a character, he would use another actor as a substitute to save time if the original actor was preoccupied.&lt;ref name="shemp"/&gt; During a [[close-up]] involving Richard DeManicor's hand opening a curtain, Raimi used his own hand in the scene since it was more convenient. His brother [[Ted Raimi]] was used as a substitute in many scenes when the original actor was either busy or preoccupied.&lt;ref name="shemp"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p.&amp;nbsp;111–112&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi famously enjoyed "torturing" his actors.&lt;ref name="ouch"&gt;{{cite video|title=One by One We Will Take You: The Untold Saga of The Evil Dead|type=documentary|location=''The Evil Dead'' Ultimate Edition DVD|year=2007|publisher=Anchor Bay Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir2|Kenneth Muir (2007)]], p. 507&lt;/ref&gt; Raimi believed that to capture pain and anger in his actors, he had to abuse them a little at times, saying, "if everyone was in extreme pain and misery, that would translate into a horror."&lt;ref name="ouch"/&gt; Producer [[Robert Tapert]] agreed with Raimi, commenting that he "enjoyed when an actor bleeds."&lt;ref name="ouch"/&gt; While shooting a scene with Campbell running down a hill, Campbell tripped and injured his leg.&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt; Raimi enjoyed poking Campbell's injury with a stick he found in the woods. Because of the copious amounts of blood in the film, the crew produced gallons of fake blood with [[Associated British Foods|karo syrup]].&lt;ref name="reinforced2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt; It took Campbell hours to remove the sticky substance from himself.&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt; Several actors had inadvertently been stabbed or thrown into objects during production.&lt;ref name="ouch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="torture"/&gt;

On the last few days on set, the conditions had become so poor that the crew began burning furniture to stay warm. Since only exterior shots needed to be filmed at that point, they burned nearly every piece of furniture left.&lt;ref name="furniture"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Several actors went days without showering, and because of the freezing conditions, several caught colds and other illnesses. Campbell later described the filming process as nearly "twelve weeks of mirthless exercise in agony", though he allowed that he did manage to have fun while on set.&lt;ref name="torture"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;107–109&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 1980, filming was finished and almost every crew member left the set to return home, with Campbell staying with Raimi.&lt;ref name="furniture"/&gt; While looking over the footage that had been shot, Raimi discovered that a few [[Pick-up (filmmaking)|pick-ups]] were required to fill in missing shots. Four days of re-shoots were then done to complete the film.&lt;ref name="reshot"/&gt; The final moment involved Campbell having "monster-guts" splattered on him in the basement.&lt;ref name="reshot"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editing===
[[File:COEN Brothers (cannesPH).jpg|alt=Two men in button-up shirts smiling.|Joel Coen ''(pictured right'') of the [[Coen brothers]] helped to edit the film.|thumb|right]]
After the extensive filming process, Raimi had a "mountain of footage" that he had to put together.&lt;ref name="reinforced2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt; He chose a Detroit editing association, where he met Edna Paul, to cut the film. Paul's assistant was Joel Coen of the [[Coen brothers]], who helped with the film's editing.&lt;ref name="editing"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;129–132&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eddie"&gt;[[#Eddie|Eddie (2010)]], p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; Paul edited a majority of the film, although Coen notably edited the shed sequence. Coen had been inspired by Raimi's ''Within the Woods'' and liked the idea of producing a prototype film to help build the interest of investors.&lt;ref name="eddie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pool"/&gt; Joel used the concept to help make ''[[Blood Simple]]'' with his brother Ethan, and he and Raimi became friends following the editing process.&lt;ref name="thingstoknow"&gt;{{cite web|author=AMC staff |date=2008-10-28 |url=http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/10/evil-dead-facts.php |title=Ten Things You Might Not Know About the Evil Dead Trilogy |publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]] |accessdate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227054237/http://blogs.amctv.com/movie-blog/2010/10/evil-dead-facts.php |archivedate=2011-12-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pool"&gt;[[#Pooley|Pooley (1987)]], p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's first cut ran at around 117 minutes, which Campbell called an impressive achievement in light of the 65-minute length of the screenplay. It was then edited down to a more marketable 85 minutes.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt;  Raimi was inspired by the fact that [[Brian De Palma]] was editing his own film ''[[Blow Out]]'' with [[John Travolta]] at the same sound facility.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt; One of the most intricate moments during editing was the [[stop-motion]] sequence where the corpses "melted", which took hours to cut properly.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt; The film had unique sounds that required extensive recording from the crew.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kawin"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Several sounds were not recorded properly during shooting, which meant the effects had to be redone in the editing rooms. Dead chickens were stabbed to replicate the sounds of mutilated flesh, and Campbell had to scream into a microphone for several hours.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt;

Much like ''Within the Woods'', ''The Evil Dead'' needed to be blown up to 35mm, then the industry standard, to be played at movie theaters.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt; The relatively large budget made this a much simpler process with ''The Evil Dead'' than it had been with the short film.&lt;ref name="editing"/&gt;

==Promotion and distribution rights==
[[File:RedfordTheatreMarquee.jpg|alt=View of a movie theater marquee.|thumb|right|''The Evil Dead'' premiered at the [[Redford Theatre]] because Bruce Campbell watched films there as a child.]]
With the film completed, Raimi and the crew decided to celebrate with a "big premiere".&lt;ref name="premiere"/&gt; They chose to screen the film at Detroit's [[Redford Theatre]], which Campbell had often visited as a child.&lt;ref name="reinforced2"/&gt; Raimi opted to have the most theatrical premiere possible, using custom tickets and wind tracks set in the theater, and ordering ambulances outside the theater to build atmosphere.&lt;ref name="premiere"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#F. Kawin|F. Kawin (2012)]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere setup was inspired by horror director [[William Castle]], who would often attempt to scare his audiences by using gimmicks. Local turnout for the premiere exceeded the cast's expectations, with a thousand patrons showing up. The audiences responded enthusiastically to the premiere, which led to Raimi's idea of "touring" the film to build hype.&lt;ref name="premiere"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126&lt;/ref&gt;

Raimi showed the film to anyone willing to watch it, booking meetings with distribution agents and anyone with experience in the film industry.&lt;ref name="casa"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;136–137&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually Raimi came across [[Irvin Shapiro]], the man who was responsible for the distribution of [[George A. Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' and other famous horror films.&lt;ref name="reinforced3"&gt;[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;422–425&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Warren|Warren (2000)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;125–126&lt;/ref&gt; Upon first viewing the film, he joked that while it "wasn't ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]''", it had commercial potential, and he expressed an interest in distributing it.&lt;ref name="casa"/&gt; It was his idea not to use the then-title ''Book of the Dead'', because it made the film sound boring. Raimi brainstormed several ideas, eventually going with ''The Evil Dead'', deemed the "least worst" title.&lt;ref name="casa"/&gt; Shapiro also advised distributing the film worldwide to garner a larger income, though it required a further financial investment by Raimi, who managed to scrape together what little money he had.&lt;ref name="casa"/&gt;

[[File:Stephen King, Comicon.jpg|alt=Close-up of a man wearing glasses.|thumb|left|upright|[[Stephen King]] cited ''The Evil Dead'' as one of his favorite films, which brought the interest of [[New Line Cinema]].]]
Shapiro was a founder of the [[Cannes Film Festival]], and allowed Raimi to screen the film at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|1982 festival]] out of competition.&lt;ref name="fuckyeah"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cannes"/&gt; [[Stephen King]] was present at its screening and gave the film a rave review. ''[[USA Today]]'' released an article about King's favorite horror films; the author cited ''The Evil Dead'' as his fifth favorite film of the genre.&lt;ref name="cannes"&gt;[[#R. Collings|R. Collings (2008)]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The film severely affected King, who commented that while watching the film at Cannes, he was "registering things [he] had never seen in a movie before".&lt;ref name="gyu"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; He became one of the film's largest supporters during the early efforts to find a distributor, eventually describing it as the "most ferociously original film of the year", a quote used in the film's promotional pieces.&lt;ref name="thingstoknow"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#R. Collings|R. Collings (2007)]], p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; King's comments attracted the interest of critics, who otherwise would likely have dismissed the low-budget thriller.&lt;ref name="gyu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LATIMES"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;151–152&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's press attracted the attention of British film distribution agent [[Stephen Woolley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finney|Finney (1997)]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bannedyo"&gt;[[#Chibnall|Chibnall (2001)]], p. 184&lt;/ref&gt; Though he considered the film a big risk, Woolley decided to take on the job of releasing the film in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Finney|Finney (1997)]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The film was promoted in an unconventional manner for a film of its budget, receiving marketing on par with that of larger budget films.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="charming"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of promotional pieces, including film posters and trailers, were showcased in the UK, heavy promotion rarely expended on such a low-budget film.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Woolley was impressed by Raimi, whom he called "charming", and was an admirer of the film, which led to his taking more risks with the film's promotion than he normally would have.&lt;ref name="charming"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Newman|Newman (2011)]], p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Fangoria]]'' started covering the film in late 1982, writing several articles about the film's long production history.&lt;ref name="twentyone"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; Early critical reception at the time was very positive, and along with ''Fangoria'', King, and Shapiro's approval, the film generated an impressive amount of interest before its commercial premiere.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt; [[New Line Cinema]], one of the distributors interested in the film, negotiated an agreement to distribute it domestically.&lt;ref name="reinforced3"/&gt; The film had several "sneak previews" before its commercial release, including screenings in New York and Detroit. Audience reception at both screenings was widely enthusiastic, and interest was built for the film to such an extent that wider distribution was planned. New Line Cinema wrote Raimi a check large enough to pay off all the investors, and decided to release the film in a unique manner:&lt;ref name="reinforced3"/&gt; simultaneously into both cinemas and onto [[VHS]], with substantial domestic promotion.&lt;ref name="fuckyeah"/&gt;

==Commercial release==
===Theaters===
Because of its large promotional campaign, the film performed above expectations at the box office.&lt;ref name="fuckyeah"/&gt; It grossed a total of $2,400,000 in the United States, nearly eight times its production budget.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Evil Dead|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=evildead.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2012-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the initial domestic gross was described as "disappointing."&lt;ref name="stacks"/&gt; It opened in 15 theaters and grossed $108,000 in its opening weekend.&lt;ref name="stacks"/&gt; Word of mouth later spread, and the film became a "[[sleeper hit]]", making over $600,000 domestically and nearly $27,000,000 overseas, for a worldwide gross of $29,400,000.&lt;ref name="stacks"/&gt; In its first week of video release in 1983 two years later, the film made £100,000 in the UK. It quickly became that week's best-selling video release, and later became the year's best-selling video in the UK, out-grossing large-budget horror releases such as ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''.&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt; Its impressive European performance was chalked up to its heavy promotion there and the more open-minded nature of European audiences.&lt;ref name="stacks"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rating===
The film's release was met with controversy. Raimi made the film as gruesome as possible with neither interest in nor fear of censorship, which led to the film's receiving an [[X rating]] and being named a "[[video nasty]]".&lt;ref name="nasty"/&gt; Films with this label were quite violent and disturbing, and the rating was often held by [[pornographic film|pornographic]] and other X-rated films.&lt;ref name="nasty"&gt;[[#Hantke|Hantke (2004)]] p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; While ''The Evil Dead'' was not pornographic in nature, it was considered one of the most violent films of its time, and censors had issues with the film's content, which impacted some of its commercial potential.&lt;ref name="stacks"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kerekes|Kerekes (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt; The film was called the "number one nasty" in a nod to its status as both a nasty and the year's best-selling video release.&lt;ref name="bannedyo"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hantke|Hantke (2004)]] p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Bruce Kawin described ''The Evil Dead'' as one of the most notorious [[splatter film]]s of its day, along with ''[[Cannibal Holocaust]]'' and ''[[I Spit on Your Grave]]''.&lt;ref name="kawin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Staiger|Staiger (2005)]], p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; The film was and is still [[List of banned films|banned]] either theatrically or on video in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Davis, Laura|title=BANNED: The most controversial films|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/banned-the-most-controversial-films-1768299.html?action=gallery&amp;ino=10|date=2010-10-05|work=The Independent|accessdate=2012-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Xavier|Xavier (2004)]], p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Home video release===
The first VHS release of ''The Evil Dead'' was by [[Thorn EMI]] in 1983, and Thorn's successor company [[HBO]] &lt;small&gt;([[WarnerMedia]])&lt;/small&gt; / [[The Cannon Group, Inc.|Cannon]] &lt;small&gt;([[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]])&lt;/small&gt; Video later repackaged the film. Congress Video, a company notable for [[public domain]] films, issued its version in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The gorehound's guide to splatter films of the 1980s|author=Stine, Scott Aaron|publisher=McFarland|year=2003|page=114|isbn=0-7864-1532-0|quote=The Evil Dead (ABE; 85m); The Evil Dead (CNG; 89(85)m); The Evil Dead (EMI; 85m)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bowker's Complete Video Directory 1994|publisher=[[R.R.

The resurgence of ''The Evil Dead'' in the home-video market came through two companies that restored the film from its negatives and issued special editions in 1998: [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] on VHS, and Elite Entertainment on [[laserdisc]]. Anchor Bay was responsible for the film's first [[DVD]] release in 1999, and between them, Elite and Anchor Bay have released six different DVD versions of ''The Evil Dead'', most notably the 2002 "Book Of The Dead" edition, packaged in a latex replica of the ''Necronomicon'' sculpted by Tom Sullivan and the 2007 three disc "Ultimate Edition" which contained the widescreen and original full frame versions of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 52-3&lt;/ref&gt; The film's high-definition debut was in a 2010 [[Blu-ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/09/03/the-evil-dead-blu-ray-review|title=The Evil Dead Blu-ray Review|publisher=[[IGN]]|author=White, Cindy|date=2010-09-03|accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Early reception===
Upon its release, contemporary critical opinion was largely positive.&lt;ref name="reinforced3"/&gt; Bob Martin, editor of ''Fangoria'', reviewed the film before its formal premiere and proclaimed that it "might be the exception to the usual run of low-budget horror films".&lt;ref name="twentyone"/&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film an "instant classic", proclaiming it as "probably the grisliest well-made movie ever."&lt;ref name="LATIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; In a 1982 review, staff from the [[trade magazine]] ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' wrote that the film "emerges as the ''[[ne plus ultra]]'' of low-budget gore and shock effect", commenting that the "powerful" and inventive camerawork was key to creating a sense of dread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117790757?refcatid=31|title=The Evil Dead|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=1982-12-31|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British press for the film was positive; Kim Newman of ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', Richard Cook of ''[[NME]]'', and Julian Petley of ''Film and Filming'' all gave the film good reviews during its early release.&lt;ref name="bloody"&gt;[[#Egan|Egan (2011)]], p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; Petley and Cook compared the film to other contemporary horror films, writing that the film expressed more imagination and "youthful enthusiasm" than an average horror film.&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; Cook described the camera work by Raimi as "audacious", stating that the film's visceral nature was greatly helped by the style of direction.&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; Woolley, Newman, and several critics complimented the film for its unexpected use of [[black comedy]], which elevated the film above its genre's potential trappings.&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; All three critics compared the film to the surrealistic work of [[Georges Franju]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], noting the cinephilic references to Cocteau's film ''[[Orpheus (film)|Orpheus]]''.&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; Writer Lynn Schofield Clark in his novel ''From Angels to Aliens'' compared the film to better-known horror films such as ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and ''[[The Omen]]'', citing it as a key supernatural thriller.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Schofield Clark|Schofield Clark (2005)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;26–28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reception===
The [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports a 95% approval rating and an average rating of 8/10 based on an aggregation of 56 reviews. It summarizes the film: "This classic low budget horror film combines just the right amount of gore and black humor, giving ''The Evil Dead'' an equal amount of thrills and laughs."&lt;ref name="RottenTomatoes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the-evil-dead/ |title=The Evil Dead |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine stated the film's "reputation was deserved", writing that the film was impressive considering its low budget and the cast's inexperience. He commented that the film successfully blended the "bizarre" combination of ''Night of the Living Dead'', ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' and ''The Three Stooges''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Empire Staff|url=http://www.empireonline.com/reviews/reviewcomplete.asp?DVDID=7240|title=The Evil Dead|work=[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]|date=2007-09-24|accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for [[Film4]] rated ''The Evil Dead'' four-and-a-half stars out of five, musing that the film was "energetic, original and icky" and concluding that Raimi's "splat-stick debut is a tight little horror classic that deserves its cult reputation, despite the best efforts of the censors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.film4.com/reviews/1983/the-evil-dead |title=The Evil Dead review |work=[[Film4]] |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Slant Magazine]]''{{'}}s Ed Gonzales compared the film to [[Dario Argento]]'s work, citing Raimi's "unnerving wide angle work" as an important factor to the film's atmosphere. He mused that Raimi possessed an "almost unreal ability to suggest the presence of intangible evil", which was what prevented the movie from being "B-movie schlock".&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Ed (2002-03-06). [http://www.slantmagazine.com/film/review/the-evil-dead/112 Review: ''The Evil Dead'']. [[Slant Magazine]]. Retrieved on 2010-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC]] critic Martyn Glanville awarded the film four stars out of five, writing that for Raimi, it served as a better debut film than Tobe Hooper's ''The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'' or [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''. Glanville noted that other than the "ill-advised trees-that-rape scene", the film is "one of the great modern horror films, and even more impressive when one considers its modest production values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glanville|first=Martyn|date=2001-03-05|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/02/the_evil_dead_1982_review.shtml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010305142803/http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/03/02/the_evil_dead_1982_review.shtml|title=The Evil Dead (1982)|publisher=[[BBC]]|archivedate=2001-03-05|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]]'s [[Christopher Null]] gave the film the same rating as Glanville, writing that "Raimi's biggest grossout is schlock horror done the right way" and comparing it to Romero's ''Night of the Living Dead'' in its ability to create stark atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Null|first=Christopher|date=2001-01-01|url=http://movies.amctv.com/movie/1983/The+Evil+Dead|title=The Evil Dead (1983)|publisher=[[AMC (TV channel)|Filmcritic.com]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' writer Pat Graham commented that the film featured several "clever" turns on the standard horror formula, adding that Raimi's "anything-for-an-effect enthusiasm pays off in lots of formally inventive bits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Pat|date=2001-01-01|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-evil-dead/Film?oid=1736507|title=The Evil Dead|publisher=Wrapports|work=[[Chicago Reader]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The make-up effects in one of the final scenes was called "amazing" by ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' critic Stephen Garrett, who commented that although the film was light on character development, the "relentless" barrage of violent imagery made for an entertaining film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Graham|first=Pat|date=2005-01-26|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64080/the_evil_dead.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120629112310/http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/64080/the_evil_dead.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-06-29|title=The Evil Dead (1981)|work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same site later cited the film as the 41st greatest horror movie ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff|url=http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2420/100-best-horror-films-the-list/6|title=The 100 best horror films|work=Time Out|accessdate=2012-07-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629120148/http://www.timeout.com/london/feature/2420/100-best-horror-films-the-list/6|archivedate=2012-06-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phelim O'Neill of ''[[The Guardian]]'' combined ''The Evil Dead'' and its sequel ''[[Evil Dead II]]'' and listed them as the 23rd best horror film ever made, announcing that the former film "stands above its mostly forgotten peers in the 80s horror boom."&lt;ref&gt;O'Neill, Phelim (2010-10-22).

J.C. Maçek III of ''[[PopMatters]]'' said, "What is unquestionable is that the Raimis and their pals created a monster in ''The Evil Dead''. It started as a disastrous failure to obtain a big break with a too long, too perilous shoot (note Campbell's changing hairstyle in the various scenes of the one-day plot). The film went through name changes and bannings only to survive as not only 'the ultimate experience in grueling horror' but as an oft-imitated and cashed-in-on classic, with 30 years of positive reviews to prove it."&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Bruce Campbell .jpg|alt=A man sitting at a table with a VHS on the table.|[[Bruce Campbell]] at a fan convention, signing a [[VHS]] copy of ''The Evil Dead''. |thumb|right|upright]]
While ''The Evil Dead'' received favorable critical comment when it was initially released, it failed to establish Raimi's reputation.&lt;ref name="bloody"/&gt; It was, however, a box-office success, which led to Campbell and Raimi teaming up again for the release of another movie.&lt;ref name="flop"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;161–163&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Coen Brothers|Joel Coen]] and his brother [[The Coen Brothers|Ethan]] had collaborated as directors and released the film ''Blood Simple'', to critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Žižek|Žižek (2000)]], p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; According to Campbell, Ethan, then an accountant, expressed surprise when the duo succeeded.&lt;ref name="flop"/&gt; The Coen brothers and Raimi collaborated on a screenplay, which was released shortly after ''The Evil Dead''. The film, ''[[Crimewave]]'', was a box-office failure.&lt;ref name="flop"/&gt; The film's production was a "disaster" according to Campbell, who stated that "missteps" like ''Crimewave'' usually lead to the end of a director's career.&lt;ref name="flop2"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; Other people involved with the film expressed similar disappointment with the project.&lt;ref name="flop"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Paul|Paul (2007)]], p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Fortunately, Raimi had the studio support to make a sequel to ''The Evil Dead'', which he initially decided to make out of desperation.&lt;ref name="flop2"/&gt;

===Sequels===
''[[Evil Dead II]]'' was filmed and released in 1987, and was also a box-office success.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; A second, and currently final, sequel was released in 1993, ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell returned as the lead character Ash Williams in both films.&lt;ref name="sequel"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reinforced4"/&gt; At that time, Raimi had become a successful director, attracting Hollywood's interest.&lt;ref name="sequel"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; His 1990 [[superhero film]] ''[[Darkman]]'' was another box-office success, which led to an increased budget for ''Army of Darkness''.&lt;ref name="reinforced4"&gt;[[#Konow|Konow (2012)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;429–434&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harris|Harris (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;51–52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; ''Army of Darkness'' had 22.8 times the budget of the original ''Evil Dead'', though it was not considered to be a box-office success like its two predecessors.&lt;ref name="sequel"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;217–218&lt;/ref&gt; ''Evil Dead II'' received general acclaim from critics and is often considered to be better than the original, and ''Army of Darkness'' received mostly positive reviews.&lt;ref name="reinforced4"/&gt; The series has often attracted attention because each sequel featured more comedic qualities than the last, progressing into "weirder" territory with each film.&lt;ref name="reinforced4"/&gt;

Unofficial sequels were also made in Italy—where the film was known as ''La Casa'' ("The House")—by [[Joe D'Amato]]'s Filmirage. In 1988, D'Amato produced two films labeled as sequels to ''Evil Dead II'', [[Umberto Lenzi]]'s ''[[Ghosthouse (film)|Ghosthouse]]'' (''La Casa 3''),  and ''[[Witchery (film)|Witchery]]'' (''La Casa 4''), starring [[Linda Blair]] and [[David Hasselhoff]]. In 1990, D'Amato produced his final ''La Casa'' film, ''[[Beyond Darkness]]'' (''La Casa 5'').&lt;ref name="PM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Erotismo, orrore e pornografia secondo Joe D'Amato|language=Italian|page=168|first=Gordiano|last=Lupi|publisher=Mondo Ignoto|year=2004|isbn=88-89084-49-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[House II: The Second Story|House II]]'' was reissued in Italy as ''La Casa 6'', and ''[[The Horror Show]]'' was then released in Italy as ''La Casa 7''.&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|title=Books of the Dead: The Followers and Clones of 'The Evil Dead'|first=J.

Critics have often compared Campbell's later performances to his role in ''Evil Dead'', which has been called his defining role.&lt;ref name="EVIL"&gt;[[#Kenneth Muir|Kenneth Muir (2004)]], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BLEND&gt;{{cite web | author =Wharton, David |url=http://www.cinemablend.com/dvdnews/FlixWorthy-Celebrates-Ash-Wednesday-With-Best-Streaming-Bruce-Campbell-30581.html |title=FlixWorthy Celebrates Ash Wednesday With The Best Of Streaming Bruce Campbell |work=Cinema Blend|publisher=Joshua Tyler |date=2011-03-09|accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell's performance as Ash has been compared to roles ranging from his performance of [[Elvis Presley]] in the film ''[[Bubba Ho-tep]]'' to the bigamous demon in ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Terms of Endearment (The X-Files)|Terms of Endearment]]".&lt;ref name=sixth&gt;{{cite web | author =Seghers, Christine |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2008/07/18/top-10-x-files-guest-stars?page=3 |title=Top 10 X-Files Guest Stars |work=[[IGN]] |date=2008-07-17|accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Russell|first=Jamie|date=2001-10-04|title=Bubba Ho-Tep (2004)|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2012-07-12|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/09/20/bubba_ho_tep_2004_review.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell's fan base gradually developed after the release of ''Evil Dead II'' and his short-lived series ''[[The Adventures of Brisco County, Jr.]]''.&lt;ref name="fan"/&gt; He is a regular favorite at most fan conventions and often draws sold-out auditoriums at his public appearances.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], pp.19–21&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Evil Dead'' developed a substantial cult following throughout the years, and has often been cited as a defining cult classic.&lt;ref name="stacks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fan"&gt;[[#Campbell|Campbell (2002)]], pp.&amp;nbsp;245–248&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Evil Dead'' has spawned a media empire. A video game adaptation [[The Evil Dead (video game)|of the same name]] was for the [[Commodore 64]] in 1984, as was a trilogy of survival horror games in the 1990s and early 2000s: ''[[Evil Dead: Hail to the King]]'', ''[[Evil Dead: A Fistful of Boomstick]]'' and ''[[Evil Dead: Regeneration]]''.&lt;ref name="retro"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Horror Movie Licenses |journal=[[Retro Gamer]] |author=Staff |page=71 |issue=1 |date=January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Raimi did voices for the trilogy, and Campbell returned as the voice of Ash. The character Ash became the main character of a [[Army of Darkness (comics)|comic book franchise]].&lt;ref name="what"&gt;[http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=125014 WW: Chicago – ''Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash'' Coming in November] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925035550/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=125014 |date=2007-09-25 }}, 2007-08-12, [[Newsarama]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ash has fought both [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Jason Voorhees]] in the ''[[Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash]]'' series, [[Herbert West]] in ''Army of Darkness vs. Re-Animator'', zombie versions of the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero team ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' in ''Marvel Zombies vs. The Army of Darkness'', and has even saved the life of a [[Barack Obama in comics|fictional]] [[Barack Obama]] in ''[[Army of Darkness (comics)#Army of Darkness: Ash Saves Obama (#1-4)|Army of Darkness: Ash Saves Obama]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kiel |last=Phegley|date=2009-05-27|url=http://splashpage.mtv.com/2009/05/27/army-of-darkness-ash-saves-obama-artist-todd-nauck-on-spider-man-barack-celebrity-team-ups/|title='Army Of Darkness: Ash Saves Obama' Artist Todd Nauck On Spider-Man, Barack &amp; Celebrity Team-Ups|publisher=[[MTV]]|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-03-27|url=http://marvel.com/news/story/922/marvel_zombies_vs_army_of_darkness_1_goes_back_to_press|title=Marvel Zombies vs. Army of Darkness #1 Goes Back to Press|publisher=Marvel.com|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2008, [[Dark Horse Comics]] began releasing a four-part monthly comic book [[Limited series (comics)|mini-series]], written by [[Mark Verheiden]] and drawn by [[John Bolton (comics)|John Bolton]], based on ''The Evil Dead''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heroesassemble.com/the-evil-dead-1-movie-adaptation-dark-horse-comics-1606-p.asp|title=The Evil Dead #1 Movie Adaptation Dark Horse Comics|publisher=Hero Assemble|accessdate=2012-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the film has inspired a [[Broadway musical|stage musical]], ''[[Evil Dead: The Musical]]'', which was produced with the permission of Raimi and Campbell.

In 2015, an ongoing television continuation of the films called ''[[Ash vs Evil Dead]]'' premiered on the Starz Network. The first episode was directed by Raimi, and Campbell is reprising his role as Ash. The series is being produced by Renaissance, and follows an older Ash as he encounters the Kandarian Demon again.

'''''The Putin Interviews''''' is a four-part, four-hour television series by [[Oliver Stone]]. It was first broadcast in 2017.

The series was created from several interviews of [[Vladimir Putin]] by Stone between 2015 and 2017.

==Summary==
Stone's interview starts with a biography of Putin. Putin explains that he attended law school in the Soviet Union straight out of high school. Next, he was required to take a job with the [[KGB]] due to the job distribution system in place for college graduates in the [[Soviet Union]]. However, he acknowledges that he hoped to get this particular job. Putin tries to explain many aspects of how things in the former USSR worked, and has much criticism of the communist era in his country 1917–1991. He also thinks that the West must understand that today's Russia cannot function exactly as the West does, already. Putin also explains his views on [[NATO]], and cannot see any reason to why this military alliance has grown after the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Communism in Europe]]. When Stone asks about Putin's views on [[Edward Snowden]] and whether he is a traitor or not, Putin replies, "No he is not, as he never has worked for any foreign country," and also claims that Russian intelligence does not know anything more than what Snowden already had leaked before he arrived at Moscow's [[Sheremetyevo International Airport|Sheremetyevo Airport]]. Stone asks, "What about if an [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] employee had done something similar?", and Putin replies "To spy on ones own allies, really is very dirty." Putin had never watched [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s 1963 black comedy satire about the [[Cold War]], ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', and they watch the film together.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
The documentary series is rated "Fresh" on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] with an 88% score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Putin Interviews: Season 1|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/the_putin_interviews/s01|website=Rotten Tomatoes|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Metacritic]], a review aggregator that weights its scores differently, presents a more mixed response with a "mixed or average" review score of 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Putin Interviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-putin-interviews/critic-reviews|website=Metacritic|accessdate=17 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However both websites draw from essentially the same pool of critical reviews, with many of these reviewers offering nuanced responses that include both praise as well as points of criticism.

A common thread among the criticism is that in interviewing Vladimir Putin, Oliver Stone failed to adequately challenge or press Putin with tough questions on a variety of subjects, such as "Russia's propaganda law aimed at gays or his [Putin's] treatment of political foes."&lt;ref name=BLowry&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lowry|first1=Brian|title='Putin Interviews' as much about Oliver Stone as Russian leader|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/09/entertainment/the-putin-interviews-review/|website=CNN|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Poniewozik]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' writes that despite being "revealing" and offering a "break from the usual news media vantages on Russia, either tough-talk centrism or the defenses of Putin enablers-come-lately in the conservative media," Stone's interviewing is "embarrassingly generous."&lt;ref name=JPoniewozik&gt;{{cite web|last1=Poniewozik|first1=James|title=Oliver Stone’s ‘Putin Interviews’: Flattery, but Little Skepticism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/arts/television/review-the-putin-interviews-showtime-oliver-stone.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Ftelevision&amp;_r=1|website=The New York Times|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poniewozik's charge that the interview is "solicitous, even obsequious" mirrors criticism leveled by Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', who summarizes the series as consisting mostly of "softball questions," and by Brian Lowry of [[CNN]] who writes that "Stone's idle chitchat and solicitous tone will surely leave many journalists and Putin critics gnashing their teeth."&lt;ref name=BLowry /&gt;&lt;ref name=JPoniewozik /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hornaday|first1=Ann|title=Oliver Stone, ‘The Putin Interviews’ and when cinematic events are outrun by events themselves|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/oliver-stone-the-putin-interviews-and-when-cinematic-events-are-outrun-by-events-themselves/2017/06/09/273c9c20-4c73-11e7-bc1b-fddbd8359dee_story.html|website=Washington Post|date=9 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Marlow Stern of ''[[The Daily Beast]]'' even goes so far as to claim that the interview series intentionally sets out to "humanize Putin and demonize America," and similarly concludes that "Stone not only fails to challenge Putin, but essentially cedes him the floor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=‘The Putin Interviews’: Oliver Stone’s Wildly Irresponsible Love Letter to Vladimir Putin|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/the-putin-interviews-oliver-stones-wildly-irresponsible-love-letter-to-vladimir-putin|website=The Daily Beast|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the series also evoked praise and more thoroughly positive responses from a number of critics.  Verne Gay of ''[[Newsday]]'', who rates the series a B+, acknowledges points raised by critics in the preceding paragraph writing that "not once does Stone push back, or harsh the mellow with phrases like 'the facts say otherwise'."&lt;ref name=VGay&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gay|first1=Verne|title=‘The Putin Interviews’ review: Oliver Stone humanizes Russia’s Vladimir Putin|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/tv/the-putin-interviews-review-oliver-stone-humanizes-russia-s-vladimir-putin-1.13730784|website=Newsday|date=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But he also points out that "[d]uring an extraordinary career, Stone has never pretended to be an unbiased journalist — or journalist, period — and he’s not about to feign pretense now."&lt;ref name=VGay /&gt; Gay's point blunts the import of the above criticism by claiming that Stone never intended to offer the interview series as "balanced" and journalism: {{quote|As journalism, this is scattershot at best, but as a conversation that covers a vast span of Russian history, culture, and politics as refracted through the mind of Russia’s president — it’s often remarkable. Putin has a lot to say. Stone lets him say it. While the many points he makes are impossible to summarize here, Putin’s motives for this interview are not: He emerges as an intelligent, sane, reasonable leader caught in the vortex of an occasionally feckless, often contradictory superpower called the United States. Touché.&lt;ref name=VGay /&gt;}}
[[Ken Tucker]] of [[Yahoo!|Yahoo TV]] describes Stone's non-combative interview approach as "the flexible way," and counters many critics desire for hard-hitting critical questions by pointing out that "Putin would not respond well to aggression," and that "one senses Putin would have shut down the interview if anything agitated him too much."&lt;ref name=KTucker&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tucker|first1=Ken|title=Oliver Stone’s ‘Putin Interviews’ Are Fascinating Ego Trips|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/putin-oliver-stone-showtime-review-162809170.html|website=Yahoo|date=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tucker in fact praises Stone's interview style as being effective for this particular subject: {{quote|Stone is quietly persistent and ready with a follow-up question he has scribbled down on an always-present yellow legal pad. Stone offers a scoffing expression if he feels Putin is being evasive — body language Putin picks up on. It’s a method that works, to the extent that Stone is invited back, time after time, to continue the chats.&lt;ref name=KTucker /&gt;}}
Sonia Saraiya of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' also offers praise of the series writing that: "''The Putin Interviews'' is a destabilizing documentary that challenges Americans’ narratives about ourselves and asks the viewer to engage in a conversation with a slippery subject. It’s riveting in how dangerous and intimate it feels, leveraging its multiple camera-angles and hand-held shots to make the viewer feel as if they, too, are in the room with Vladimir Putin."&lt;ref name=SSaraiya&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saraiya|first1=Sonia|title=TV Review: Oliver Stone’s ‘The Putin Interviews’|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/reviews/putin-interviews-review-oliver-stone-1202453720/|website=Variety|date=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
During a scene in Stone’s interview series with Putin, the president took out his phone to show Stone a clip of how “our aviation” was firing at militants in Syria. “That’s how our forces are operating,” Putin told the director. “These militants are running with arms, not just machine guns.” 
However, a Russian video published on June 20th, 2017 pointed out strong similarities between the clip Putin played and footage from 2013 of a U.S. Apache helicopter firing at militants in Afghanistan. The striking similarities led people on social media to call the clip “fake” and suggest that the Russian president didn’t realize what he was showing was not his own forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://meduza.io/en/news/2017/06/20/putin-showed-oliver-stone-a-video-where-russia-s-air-force-supposedly-attacked-terrorists-in-syria-it-was-actually-footage-of-americans-fighting-the-taliban-in-afghanistan|title=Putin showed Oliver Stone a video where Russia's Air Force supposedly attacked terrorists in Syria.

'''Ven''' ({{lang-da|Hven}}, older Swedish spelling '''Hven''') is a small [[Sweden|Swedish]] island in the [[Øresund]] strait, between [[Scania]] and [[Zealand (Denmark)|Zealand]] ([[Denmark]]). It is part of [[Landskrona Municipality]], [[Skåne County]]. The island has 371 inhabitants and an area of {{convert|7.5|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}. During the 1930s, the population was at its peak, with approximately 1,300 inhabitants. There are four villages on the island: Bäckviken, Tuna By, Norreborg and Kyrkbacken.

==Geography==
Unlike the relatively flat islands [[Amager]] and [[Saltholm]], Ven rises from the Øresund with steep and dramatic coastlines. This makes the island easily visible from both Zealand and Scania, as well as from all ships that sail in and out of the [[Baltic Sea]]. Its southern coastline resembles the [[White Cliffs of Dover]], [[Møns Klint]] and [[Cape Arkona]], but owing to a higher degree of sand and lower of chalk, the {{convert|50|m|ft|abbr=off|adj=mid|-high}} cliffs are more yellow than white. Almost the entire island consists of a flat agricultural landscape, but elevated like a plateau. Owing to the slightly higher altitude, the climate on the island in general is similar to that of the lower terrain coastal areas around Øresund.

The island has three smaller fishing ports: ''Bäckviken'' (where small ferries depart to [[Landskrona]]), ''Norreborg'' and ''Kyrkbacken''. The latter is located at the south-western coast just beneath the old church ''Sankt Ibb''. This coast is known as ''Backafall.''

==History==
The island was historically under Danish rule. Danish astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] (1546&amp;ndash;1601) built two [[observatory|observatories]] there, [[Uraniborg]] and [[Stjerneborg]], during 1576–1596. The observatories were built by the inhabitants of the island with Tycho Brahe as their Lord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Christianson|first1=John Robert|title=On Tycho's Island|date=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=052165081X}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Swedish took over control in 1658, as the rest of [[Scania]] was ceded to Sweden by the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. The island was not specifically mentioned in the treaty, and according to the Danes it was not part of Scania, but of Zealand and therefore still under Danish rule. The Swedes did not agree with that interpretation, and sent troops to occupy the island on 6 May 1658. The transfer to Sweden was confirmed in 1660 by the [[Treaty of Copenhagen (1660)|Treaty of Copenhagen]]. The 350th anniversary of this transfer was commemorated on the island in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Jubileum på Ven 2010 | trans-title = Ven Commemorative Celebration 2010 | url = http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/landskrona_stad/pressrelease/view/jubileum-paa-ven-2010-393609 | publisher = Landskrona Stad (town of Landskrona) | date = 2010-04-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two churches are located on this island. The older one, St Ibb's Church, is located at the top of a hill in the churchyard close to the west coast of the island, overlooking the Danish town of [[Rungsted]]. It was built in the 13th century and is a popular church for weddings. The younger church, which has been converted into a museum, is located in the middle of the island, near [[Uraniborg]], one of the two observatories built by the astronomer Tycho Brahe.

Ven has ferries to [[Landskrona]], and, in the summer only, to [[Helsingborg]] and [[Copenhagen]]. The ferries dock at Bäckviken. The island is a popular tourist place, especially in summer. It is sometimes called "The pearl of Øresund". As the earth is rich in [[till]], it is good for agriculture. [[Durum]] wheat and [[grapes]] are grown there.

==Representation in culture==
Backafall on Ven is named in [[Gabriel Jönsson]]'s poem ''Vid vakten''. He also wrote the song ''"Flicka från Backafall"'' ("Girl from Backafall").

'''Wilhelm Tomaschek''', or '''Vilém Tomášek''' (May 26, 1841, [[Olomouc]] – September 9, 1901, [[Vienna]]) was a [[Czech people|Czech]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]] [[geographer]] and [[oriental studies|orientalist]]. He is known for his work in the fields of historical [[topography]] and historical [[ethnography]].&lt;ref name=DG&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1NVRfl4gCw0C&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=%22Tomaschek,+Wilhelm%22+1841&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JjqNVyV4Re&amp;sig=pH9iw3anXEiLQAK8IDAxNNIy3nk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CFgbVe-JJ8XtoATf44DoAw&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tomaschek%2C%20Wilhelm%22%201841&amp;f=false Thibaut - Zycha, Volume 10] by K. G. Saur Verlag GmbH &amp; Company, Walter De Gruyter Incorporated&lt;/ref&gt;

Born at [[Olmütz]], in [[Moravia]], he received his education at the [[University of Vienna]] (1860–64), afterwards working as a teacher in gymnasiums at [[Sankt Pölten]] and Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=VdoAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Wilhelm+Tomaschek%22+P%C3%B6lten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SitEe2nutL&amp;sig=6Pl08sSXnYFOdTSzkGoDLCb7zRI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=klwbVe27HtfooATo-IDgDw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Wilhelm%20Tomaschek%22%20P%C3%B6lten&amp;f=false Die feierliche inauguration des rektors der Wiener universität] by Universität Wien&lt;/ref&gt; On the strength of the first volume of ''Centralasiatische Studien'', he was named an associate professor of geography at the [[University of Graz]] in 1877. In 1881 he became a "full professor", and in 1885, was appointed chair of [[historical geography]] at the University of Vienna. In 1899 he became a regular member of the [[Vienna Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name=DG/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Geographical Journal, 1901, Volume 18, Page 544.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the thoroughfare ''Tomaschekstraße'', in the district of [[Floridsdorf]] (Vienna), was named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wien.gv.at/wiki/index.php/Tomaschekstra%C3%9Fe Wien Geschichte] Tomaschekstraße&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Zola River''', also known as the '''Zola Chai''' is a river in [[Iran]], flowing into [[Lake Urmia]]. It runs north of [[Urmia]] and west of [[Salmas]]. Rising in the mountains along the border with [[Turkey]], it flows southwest along the [[Salmas Plain]]. The river has a [[catchment area]] of 846&amp;nbsp;km².&lt;ref&gt;Jamshid Yarahmadi, [http://www.itc.nl/library/papers_2003/msc/wrem/yarahmadi.pdf   The integration of Satellite Images, GIS and CROPWAT model to investigateion of water balance in irrigated areas:A case stude of Salmas and Tassoj Plains Iran]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkey in Asia, Transcaucasia. 1861 (GFB).jpg|thumb|300px| The Zola River near Korsova &amp; [[Salmas|Dilman]]]]The river has also been dammed&lt;ref&gt;[http://dup.esrin.esa.it/files/m310/14-%20WL%20hydrology%20and%20modelling%20-%20Vekerdy.pdf   wetland hydrology and modelling at water basin level - Data User ...].&lt;/ref&gt; for irrigation. The dam has a height of 83m and a width of 287[[meter|m]] and is constructed of an Earth-rock dam with central clay core. The dam holds 85 million m³ of water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zistab.com/projectdetail2-61-en.html  Conducting of Zola Dam's Construction] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207105947/http://www.zistab.com/projectdetail2-61-en.html |date=February 7, 2015 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ecology ==
The Zola river is an important component of the ecosystem of the Lake Urmia Basin.&lt;ref&gt;Mohammad Amir Rahmani and Mahdi Zarghami, [http://www.civilica.com/EnPaper-NCHP03-NCHP03_118.html Studying Climate Change Condition by Wavelet-Ann and System Dynamics Approaches; Zola Reservoir, Iran].&lt;/ref&gt; Lake Urmia is drying out and has taken on a red color due to [[phytoplankton]] in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lake-urmia.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/on-red-coloration-of-lake-urmia.html On the red coloration of Lake Urmia].&lt;/ref&gt; The health of this river is a key indicator of the health of the whole basin and is therefore the subject of much study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ir.undp.org/content/dam/iran/docs/News/2014/March%202014/Towards%20a%20solution%20for%20Iran's%20dying%20wetlands/Lake%20Uromiyeh/LU%20Baseline%20Studies.pdf Lake Uromiyeh Baseline Studies - UNDP in Iran].&lt;/ref&gt;
