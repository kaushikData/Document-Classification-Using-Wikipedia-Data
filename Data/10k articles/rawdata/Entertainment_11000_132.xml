      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">"'''81 Words'''" is an episode of the popular [[public radio]] program, ''[[This American Life]]'', which is broadcast from [[Chicago Public Radio]]. This episode was originally aired January 18, 2002.  The episode is narrated by [[Alix Spiegel]], who was the recipient of the [[George Foster Peabody Award]], the [[Livingston Award]], and the Dupont Award.  She won the 2002 Livingston Award in National Reporting for the 204th episode of ''This American Life'', "81 Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livawards.org/ |title=Livingston Awards |publisher=Livawards.org |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program is hosted by Ira Glass, who gives the introduction for the episode stating, &lt;blockquote&gt;
"It's just uncanny, I think that's the word.  It's just uncanny when something so small, for a moment, for the length of time it takes to sign [he is referring to a pen used to sign major U.S. legal documents] can carry the entire weight of history of a nation.  Today's radio program is about something small like that, that was at the epicenter of massive social change in our country for a brief moment."&lt;ref name="thisamericanlife1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?episode=204 |title=81 Words |publisher=This American Life |date=2002-01-18 |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;  This narrative tale falls into the category of [[healing narrative]].  It is the healing narrative of Dr. [[John Patrick Spiegel]], Alix Spiegel's grandfather.  Dr. John P. Spiegel was a psychiatrist and the former president of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/allinthemind/stories/2007/1992653.htm |title=81 Words: the inside story of psychiatry and homosexuality [Part 1 of 2&amp;#93; - All In The Mind - ABC Radio National (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Summary ==
The episode is split into two acts.  The first act explains that in 1973, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) declared that homosexuality was not a disease, by changing the 81-word definition of sexual deviance in its own reference manual. It was a change that attracted a lot of attention at the time, but the story of what led up to that change is one that was reported by Spiegel. Part one of Spiegel's story details the activities of a closeted group of gay psychiatrists within the APA who met in secret and called themselves the GAYPA ... and another, even more secret group of gay psychiatrists among the political echelons of the APA. Spiegel's own grandfather was among these psychiatrists, and the president-elect of the APA at the time of the change.&lt;ref name="thisamericanlife1"/&gt; Alix Spiegel states in the beginning of the story that, "...I know this story not because I read it in a book or learned it in any class, but because it's one of those stories that my family uses to explain itself."  The story begins with a recording of John P. Spiegel interviewing himself in which he talks about how he has been asked to travel to Ireland to work with a gay activist who is trying to change the Irish constitution.  Spiegel was asked to testify as an expert in mental health.  Dr. Spiegel was asked to testify about the mental health of homosexuals.  Oddly enough he was a homosexual who had not told anyone.  He was asked to do this because he was the president elect of the American Psychiatric Association in 1973.  It stated in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM) that homosexuality was termed sexual deviance and that homosexuals were pathological.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler RC, Chiu WT, Demler O, Merikangas KR, Walters EE (June 2005). "Prevalence, severity, and comorbidity of Sexual Deviance DSM disorders". Arch. Gen. Psychiatry 62 (6): 617–27.&lt;/ref&gt;  This gave the country the right to treat homosexuals differently.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart H (September 2006). "Mental illness and employment discrimination". Curr Opin Psychiatry 19 (5): 522–6.&lt;/ref&gt;  Alix Spiegel's family had always told the story of Dr. Spiegel as one that expressed him as the sole person to abolish the 81 word definition of homosexuality from the DSM, until a family vacation after Dr. Spiegel's wife had died, when he emerged from a beach bungalow with a much younger man that was later introduced to a shocked family as his lover.

The second act of the radio program explains the history of homosexuality in psychological terms and gives the conclusion to the story.  At the same time that Dr. Spiegel is working in Ireland, a few gay activists began to make protests to try to get the designation of homosexuality changed.  The story from this point gives a history of homosexuality, from its original state as a crime against the will of God, to it being a form of insanity, then stating it was just faulty wiring.  The story continues by talking about Dr. [[Irving Bieber]], who started doing a lot of tests with homosexuals.  Dr. Bieber tried to find the cause for homosexuality in a psychological sense.  The story continues to talk about the group of gay activists that worked inside of the APA, that had a large part to do with the changing of the 81 word definition.  The GAYPA worked in the APA to get Dr. [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] (the head of the APA) to rewrite the 81 word definition. The story ends with Dr. John P. Spiegel, president-elect of the APA, accepting the new definition of homosexuality.

'''''Birthright''''' is an [[American comic book]] series written by Joshua Williamson and drawn by Andrei Bressan, announced July 14, 2014 and released October 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Skybound Series BIRTHRIGHT Announced! |url=https://www.skybound.com/comics/new-skybound-series-birthright-announced/ |website=Skybound Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt; This monthly [[comic book]] series is produced by [[Skybound Entertainment]] and published by [[Image Comics]].

When asked about where the idea for ''Birthright'' came from, Williamson says, "Destiny. I thought a lot about life and life goals. What do you do after you get what you want. If you set a big goal and then accomplish it… what happens next. Again, when I would watch movies, or TV shows, I always found myself interested in what came after."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with Josh Williamson! |url=https://www.skybound.com/comics/interview-with-josh-williamson/ |website=Skybound Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, Skybound Entertainment and [[Universal Pictures]] announced that a feature film adaptation was underway being headed up by [[Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=

==Plot==
Days before his surprise birthday party, young Mikey Rhodes goes missing. No one is sure what happened — his father is accused of murder, his mother breaks down at the realization of her deepest fears, and his older brother watches as his family falls to pieces. All seems to be lost for the Rhodes until Mikey’s miraculous return one year later.

But something is different; Mikey is back, but he’s not the same boy they once knew. He's returned as an adult, having ventured into another world called Terrenos and being raised as a warrior, a savior. Filled with an extraordinary purpose, Mikey is now on a path to fulfilling a destiny larger, darker, and more dangerous than his family can imagine. Can Mikey be fully trusted? What happened in Terrenos, and what horrors have followed him back?

'''''Breaking Away''''' is a 1980 American [[comedy-drama]] television series that was based on the [[Breaking Away|1979 film of the same name]]. It was created by [[Steve Tesich]], who wrote the original film, and the film's director [[Peter Yates]] served as Executive Producer.

As a prequel, the series was set during the year prior to the events of the film. [[Shaun Cassidy]] took over the role of Dave Stohler (played by [[Dennis Christopher]] in the film),&lt;ref name="miaminews-28nov1980"/&gt; a young man mad about [[bicycle racing]] and all things Italian. [[Barbara Barrie]], [[Jackie Earle Haley]] and [[John Ashton (actor)|John Ashton]] reprised their roles from the film.&lt;ref name="ocalastarbanner-4oct1986"/&gt; The television series was set in [[Bloomington, Indiana]], but was actually shot in [[Athens, Georgia]].

The show was caught up in the 1980 Screen Actors Guild Strike and did not begin production until that fall.  While heavily promoted by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], it was overlooked by TV audiences once it got on the air and suffered low ratings. It was cancelled after eight episodes were filmed, though only seven episodes aired during its original run.&lt;ref name="calgaryherald-23jan1981"/&gt; ABC showed reruns of the show during the summer of 1981, and it was also rerun by the [[Arts &amp; Entertainment]] cable channel during 1985–1987.

'''Cinema of Austria''' refers to the [[film industry]] based in [[Austria]]. Austria has had an active [[film|cinema]] industry since the early 20th century when it was the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and that has continued to the present day. Producer [[Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky]], producer-director-writer [[Luise Kolm]] and the [[Austro-Hungarian]] directors [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[Alexander Korda]] were among the pioneers of early Austrian cinema. Several Austrian directors pursued careers in [[Weimar Germany]] and later in the [[United States]], among them [[Fritz Lang]], [[G. W. Pabst]], [[Josef von Sternberg]], [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fred Zinnemann]], and [[Otto Preminger]].

Between the two World Wars, directors like [[E. W. Emo]] and [[Henry Koster]] - the latter of whom had emigrated from Austria, provided examples of Austrian film comedies. At the same time, [[Willi Forst]] and [[Walter Reisch]] founded the ''[[Wiener Film]]'' genre. After Austria had become a part of Nazi Germany in 1938, Vienna's [[Wien-Film]] production company became an important studio for seemingly non-political productions. In the aftermath of World War II, Austria's film production soon restarted, partially supported by the Allied Forces. Veteran and new directors such as [[Ernst Marischka]], [[Franz Antel]], [[Geza von Cziffra]], [[Geza von Bolvary]] and [[Walter Kolm-Veltee]] revised the comedy, provincial [[Heimatfilm]], and biopic traditions, and began a new genre of the opulent imperial epic (e.g. Marischka's ''[[Sissi (film)|Sissi]]'' films and Antel's imperial era musicals) which rivaled Hollywood entertainment at the international box office.

The 1950s brought Austria the largest film production boom in its history, but without a [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] or [[French New Wave|New Wave]] school, which had revitalized other European cinemas during this era, and with no national subsidies, the commercial Austrian film industry collapsed by 1968 and experimental film remained very limited. By the 1970s, television had become the medium for entertainment film, the short films of the radical [[Viennese Actionism]] movement rejected narrative structure completely, and Austria's alpine landscape as well some of its directors and actors were used for [[West German]] [[sex comedy]] productions.

With national subsidy arriving in 1981, a new generation of Austrian filmmakers established themselves at home and international festivals in the 1980s and 90s, among them [[Axel Corti]], [[Niki List]], [[Paul Harather]], [[Michael Haneke]], [[Barbara Albert]], [[Harald Sicheritz]], [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]] and [[Ulrich Seidl]]. In the first decade of the 21st century, Austrian cinema found its long-delayed New Wave and international critical success.

Austrian or Austrian-identifying actors who have achieved international success from the 1920s to the present include [[Erich von Stroheim]], [[Elisabeth Bergner]], [[Joseph Schildkraut]], [[Paul Henreid]], [[Hedy Lamarr]], [[Walter Slezak]], [[Oskar Homolka]], [[Nadja Tiller]], [[Senta Berger]], [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]], [[Maximilian Schell]], [[Maria Schell]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Oskar Werner]], [[Vanessa Brown]], [[Gusti Huber]], [[Curd Jürgens]], [[Lotte Lenya]], [[Kurt Kasznar]], [[Marisa Mell]], [[Helmut Berger]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], and [[Christoph Waltz]].

== History ==

=== Before 1918 ===
[[File:Kinoprogramm Wien 1896.jpg|thumb|left|An advertisement for films by the French [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Brothers Lumière]] in [[Vienna]] from 1896.]]
[[File:Alhambra-Theater KarlJuhasz 1906.jpg|thumb|left|Advertisement for "Pariser-Abend" ''(Paris evening)'' and "Herren-Abend" ''(gentlemen's evening)'' with erotic movie screenings of the "wandering cinema", Alhambra-Theater, 1906.]]
{{Austria film list}}
Between 1896 and about 1905 the only films produced in Austria were [[newsreel]]s, mostly by French companies such as [[Pathé Frères]] and [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont]]. The first films by an Austrian filmmaker were a series of short erotic movies such as ''[[Am Sklavenmarkt]]'' produced by the photographer [[Johann Schwarzer]], who founded the ''[[Saturn-Film]]'' company in 1906. Some of his productions have been found and restored in recent years by the [[Filmarchiv Austria]].

Mainstream film production began in 1910 when the company "Erste österreichische Kinofilms-Industrie", later [[Wiener Kunstfilm]]) was founded by [[Anton Kolm]], his wife [[Luise Fleck|Luise Kolm]], and [[Jacob Fleck]]. They started with newsreels but soon began to produce fiction films. In 1912 Count [[Alexander Kolowrat|Sascha Kolowrat-Krakowsky]], a wealthy nobleman from [[Bohemia]], founded the [[Sascha-Film]] company. In the period before 1918 it grew into the largest production company in Austria; its main competitor was Wiener Kunstfilm. After the start of [[World War I]] the Austrian film industry grew in strength, as many foreign companies, including those of France's powerful film industry, were no longer allowed to produce or distribute films in Austria. In the period 1914 to 1918, nearly 200 movies were produced in Austria - twice as many as in all the years before.

Some Austrian filmmakers had already emigrated and begun careers in the United States by this time. [[Erich von Stroheim]] and [[Josef von Sternberg]] were just two of the natives of Austria who contributed to the early success of Hollywood. Lesser known filmmakers who began their career in the US were for example [[Henry Lehrman]], who staged a few hundred slapstick movies, including the first four movies starring [[Charlie Chaplin]]. The founder of [[20th Century Fox|Fox Film Corporation]], [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] (born as Wilhelm Fuchs) and the first independent producer in Hollywood, [[Sam Spiegel]], were also native Austrians, born as German speaking Jews in [[Austria-Hungary]]. The co-founder of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]], [[Marcus Loew]], was born as son of Jewish emigrants of Austria-Hungary.

=== 1918 to 1936 ===
After the end of World War I, film production continued to grow, because the then Austrian currency, the [[Austro-Hungarian krone|Krone]], was very weak. As a result, Austrian films were cheaper than those from other countries. In the years 1919 to 1922 Austrian film production reached its all-time peak with a yearly output of 100 to 140 films.

Many of the films produced in this period were of a lower quality than those of established film-producing nations like France, Great Britain, Denmark, Germany and Italy. But among the mass of low-grade productions there were also films by producers and directors who attached importance to quality. Consequently, the [[German Expressionism|expressionist]] style of film-making had its beginnings not only in German but also in Austrian cinema, for example in [[Paul Czinner]]'s ''[[Inferno (1920 film)|Inferno]]'' (1920). The script of one of the most important German expressionist films, ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920), was written by two Austrians, [[Carl Mayer]] and [[Hans Janowitz]]. They, along with [[Fritz Lang]] and Paul Czinner, also worked in Berlin at that time as Berlin was the centre of the German-language film industry. The Austrian [[Fritz Kortner]], who worked in both Germany and Austria - for example in Austrian pre-expressionist productions such as ''[[Der Mandarin]]'' (1918) - was one of the most noted expressionist actors. The best known Austrian expressionist film is ''[[The Hands of Orlac (1924 film)|The Hands of Orlac]]'' (1924) by German director [[Robert Wiene]] which starred [[Conrad Veidt]] and Fritz Kortner.

Around 1923 the whole European film industry went into decline due to growing competition from the United States. American films could be exported to Europe very cheaply, because the production costs had already been earned back at the American box-office. The European film industry, divided into many different countries and many different languages, could not produce quality films at a low enough price to compete with the American imports. Another issue which affected Germany and Austria was the successful reining in of hyperinflation. Austrian films were no longer especially cheap and exports fell. As a result, Austrian film production had reduced by the mid-twenties to between 20 and 30 films per year, a level commensurate with its new greatly reduced size after World War I. In the whole silent movie era around 1,000 films were produced in Austria.

The 1920s were also the age of the [[epic film]], on the model of films of the pre-war period from the United States (for example those of [[D.W. Griffith]]) and Italy. In Austria the Austro-Hungarian filmmakers [[Michael Curtiz]] and [[Alexander Korda]] produced epic films for ''[[Sascha-Film]]'' and ''[[Vita-Film]]'' (the successor company of ''Wiener Kunstfilm''), among them ''[[Prinz und Bettelknabe]]'' (1920), ''[[Samson und Delila]]'' (1922), ''[[Sodom und Gomorrha]]'' (1922), ''[[Der Junge Medardus]]'' (1923), ''[[Die Sklavenkönigin]]'' (1924), ''[[Harun al Raschid (film)|Harun al Rashid]]'' (1924) and ''Salammbo'' (1925). These films were the biggest ever produced in Austria, with enormous production costs, up to 10,000 costumed extras, and huge sets such as the "Temple of Sodom" which were designed and built by Austria's top [[set designer]]s of the period, [[Emil Stepanek]], [[Artur Berger]] and [[Julius von Borsody]]. The who's-who of the Austrian film scene worked on these films. Leading cinematographers like [[Franz Planer]] and [[Hans Theyer]] photographed the films, and the directors' wives, [[Lucy Doraine]] (Michael Curtiz) and [[Maria Corda]] (Alexander Korda), were the films' leading ladies. The casts were completed by Austrian film and theatre stars like [[Hans Thimig]], [[Walter Slezak]], [[Oscar Beregi (actor, born 1876)|Oskar Beregi]], [[Hans Marr]]. Some film stars of later years, [[Willi Forst]] for example, appeared in some of these movies as extras.

Between 1933 and 1936 Austria was a refuge for many German filmmakers who had emigrated from [[Nazi Germany]], among them directors [[Erich Engel]] and [[Werner Hochbaum]].

=== 1936 to 1945 ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Ungeküsst.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Ungeküsst soll man nicht schlafen gehn]]'' (1936) by [[E. W. Emo]] with [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]], [[Theo Lingen]] and [[Heinz Rühmann]]]]  --&gt;
Although Austria was not annexed by Germany until 1938, Jews were forbidden to work in the Austrian film industry from 1936 onwards due to pressure from Nazi Germany where Jews had been banned from film work within months of the Nazis taking power. Germany was the most important export market for Austrian films and  Germany had threatened a total ban on Austrian film imports unless the Austrians complied with their demands. The only exception to this ban was, for unknown reasons, the  film ''[[Episode (film)|Episode]]'' (1935) directed by the Jewish [[Walter Reisch]]. The majority of Jewish Austrian directors, actors and other employees of the film industry, along with many non-Jewish opponents of the Nazis emigrated in the following years to France, Czechoslovakia, Great Britain and the United States. Some Jewish filmmakers, however, did not emigrate and many died in the [[Holocaust]]. Many of the Austrian emigrants went on to successful careers in the United States, notably the directors [[Billy Wilder]], [[Fred Zinnemann]], [[Otto Preminger]], [[Joe May]] and [[Edgar G. Ulmer]].

After the ''[[Anschluss]]'' some filmmakers came to arrangements with the new Nazi leadership, whilst others chose to leave the film business under the Nazis or to hide in the underground - for example the famous costume designer [[Gerdago]] who went on to create the costumes for the ''[[Elisabeth of Bavaria#In film and television|Sissi films]]'' of the 1950s.

The whole Austrian film industry was quickly integrated into one company ''[[Wien-Film]]'', which was the new name of ''Sascha-Film'' following its confiscation by the Nazis with the help of the ''[[Creditanstalt]]'' bank. ''Wien-Film'' produced few openly propagandistic films; the majority of its output was apparently harmless comedies, which often had an antidemocratic and anti-semitic subtext. Although Nazi censorship was strict, a few films contained criticism hidden at a metaphorical level, for example the musical comedies of Willi Forst.

=== 1945 to 1970 ===
The period between 1945 and 1970 was the age of musical comedies, which had already become popular in the 1930s, and of ''[[Heimatfilm]]e'', sentimental films with a rural setting. In the aftermath of [[World War II]] Austria's cities were devastated and filmmakers set their works in the countryside to show the population the "good and beautiful" Austria. In the 1950s, the age of the ''[[Wirtschaftswunder]]'' there was little popular call for serious or critical films; the public preference was for films that displayed a safe environment, an escape from the destruction of recent history. Many of the comedies of the period were set at the time of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] as this period is identified with luxury, elegance, romance and a vision of Austria as large, powerful and peaceful. This explains the popularity of the ''Sissi'' films starring [[Romy Schneider]] as the [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Empress Elizabeth]] which found not only domestic but international success. These films were the model for many other Austrian films of the period. Apart from Schneider other Austrian film stars of the 1950s and 1960s were [[Peter Alexander (Austrian actor and singer)|Peter Alexander]], [[Attila Hörbiger]], [[Magda Schneider]], [[Wolf Albach-Retty]] and [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]. Among the directors, the highly prolific [[Franz Antel]] became a household name with his popular comedies.

=== 1970 to 1990 − era of structural changes ===
[[File:Viennale-04-Stadtkino.jpg|thumb|left|The Viennese ''Stadtkino'' at the ''[[Viennale]]'' film-festival 2004]]
The 1970s was the period in which Austrian film production reached its lowest ebb with only five to ten films being produced each year. The reactionary Austrian film industry succumbed to the rise of television whilst at the same time, a new, young, and critical generation of filmmakers - the Austrian avant-garde movement - emerged with productions that were often [[Experimental film|experimental]]. Notable avant-garde filmmakers, some of whom had begun working in the late 1950s, included [[Peter Kubelka]], [[Franz Novotny]], [[Ernst Schmid Jr.]], [[Ferry Radax]], [[Kurt Kren]], [[Valie Export]], [[Otto Muehl]], and [[Peter Weibel]].

By around 1980 a new wave of mainstream film production had begun in Austria. With the modern industry having to compete with leisure pursuits like television and computers which did not exist in its heyday of the interwar period and the 1950s, a return to the production levels of those times seems most unlikely. However, the Austrian industry did begin to rediscover different film genres which had been largely forgotten from the 1930s through to the 1960s when sentimental comedies dominated the domestic scene. Whilst comedies remain popular in Austria to this day, the nature of the comedy has changed and dramas have returned to popularity. Other genres such as the [[action movie]], the [[thriller (genre)|thriller]], the [[fantasy film]] and the [[horror film]] have not become established in Austria, not least because of their high production costs and reliance on expensive special effects. Austrian films of the 21st Century seldom cost more than 1 to 2 million [[euro]]s to produce as higher costs could not be earned back in the domestic market and few Austrian films enjoy successful overseas distribution. Simultaneously almost the entire distribution system within Austria is in the hands of the major American film companies who have their own productions to sell. As a result, there is little marketing and publicity for Austrian-made films.

In the 1990s, the Austrian film industry underwent a number of structural changes. Some directors, both established and upcoming have created their own film-companies to share resources and learn from each other. The other film companies, the biggest of which are ''[[Dor-Film]]'' and ''[[Allegro-Film]]'', both producing at least two theatrically released films a year, concentrate  on commercially oriented productions such as comedies with cabaret stars who enjoy a high profile in the Austrian market. Such comedies, notably [[Hinterholz 8]] and [[Poppitz]], both directed by [[Harald Sicheritz]], have had the highest box-office of any Austrian films in the last 25 years. These companies also produce more challenging films, but only in limited numbers as productions other than comedies are financially risky in Austria unless foreign distribution can be secured.

Austrian films' share of the domestic box-office is one of the lowest in Europe, with only about 3% of cinema admissions going to domestic productions. Every year the annual top ten films at the Austrian box-office are usually all American.

High-quality Austrian films, which have won more and more critical acclaim in recent years, are usually produced by small production companies, often in co-production with other countries. Examples of this are ''[[The Piano Teacher (2001 film)|The Piano Teacher]]'' and ''[[Caché (film)|Caché]]'' by [[Michael Haneke]], probably the most famous Austrian director at the current time. Other successful Austrian films (wholly Austrian and co-productions) since 2000 are [[We Feed the World]] ([[Erwin Wagenhofer]]), [[Darwin's Nightmare]] ([[Hubert Sauper]]), [[Calling Hedy Lamarr]] ([[Georg Misch]]), ''[[Grbavica (film)|Grbavica]]'' ([[Jasmila Žbanić]]), [[Slumming (film)|Slumming]] ([[Michael Glawogger]]), [[Silentium (film)|Silentium]] and [[Komm, süßer Tod (film)|Komm, süßer Tod]] (both [[Wolfgang Murnberger]]), [[The Edukators]] ([[Hans Weingartner]]) and [[Hundstage|Dog Days]] ([[Ulrich Seidl]]). Other notable contemporary directors are [[Barbara Albert]], [[Andrea Maria Dusl]], [[Elisabeth Scharang]], [[Jessica Hausner]], [[Stefan Ruzowitzky]], [[Ruth Mader]], [[Kurt Palm]], [[Nikolaus Geyrhalter]] and, resident in the U.S., [[Robert Dornhelm]].

Contemporary Austrian film making is internationally well known for its realistic social dramas, which enjoyed high attention and many awards on international film festivals since the late 1990s. On the occasion of a film row of Austrian films in the [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts|Lincoln Center]], where films like ''Dog Days'' or Barbara Alberts ''[[Northern Skirts]] (Nordrand)'' were shown, ''[[The New York Times]]'' came to the point, that Austria is currently the ''world capital of feel-bad cinema''.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'', Dennis Lim, november 27, 2006([http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/27/news/ausfilm.php article online])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocaust narrative ''[[The Counterfeiters (2007 film)|Die Fälscher]]'' (''The Counterfeiters'') won the [[Academy Award]] or "Oscar" for Best Foreign Language Film in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[[imdb.com]], Awards for Fälscher, Die ([https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0813547/awards])&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Revanche (film)|Revanche]]'' was nominated for the same award in 2009.  Critical recognition of Austria's new wave film has continued and in 2013 Michael Haneke's French-language film representing Austria, ''[[Amour (2012 film)|Amour]]'', received both the Oscar and the [[BAFTA Award]] for Best Foreign Language Film.

{{Clint Eastwood sidebar}}
On Thursday, August 30, 2012, American actor and director [[Clint Eastwood]] gave a speech at the [[2012 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]].  Eastwood had endorsed [[Mitt Romney]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 United States presidential election]] earlier that month, and spent much of his speech's running time on a largely improvised routine in which he addressed an empty chair that represented President [[Barack Obama]]. The speech, broadcast in a [[prime time]] slot, was viewed live by around 30 million people. It generated many responses and much discussion.

==Background==
[[Political life of Clint Eastwood|Eastwood had a political background]], as the non-partisan mayor of [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California]],&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt; and serving on various state commissions on parks and the film industry.&lt;ref name="CSPRC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC04162004"/&gt;  He also previously endorsed Republican candidate [[John McCain]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref name="Aguilar"/&gt;  On August 3, 2012, Eastwood had [[Endorsements for the Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012#Tier 3 (Statesmen, former politicians, and celebrities)|formally endorsed]] former Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] for the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], speaking at a fundraiser for the candidate.&lt;ref name="Peoples"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Daunt"/&gt;

The three broadcast networks each devoted one hour of coverage to the convention per night, during the prime 10:00 to 11:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. time slot.&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hinckley"/&gt;  In response to criticism that conventions are over-scripted, organizers did not disclose the identity of the first speaker who had been given the high profile speaking slot.&lt;ref name="MolloyAnderson"/&gt;  On August 30, CNN reported that Eastwood was the "mystery guest".&lt;ref name="Walsh"/&gt;

==Speech==

Eastwood made an unannounced appearance at the convention, speaking at the top of the final hour.  The speech was scheduled to last five minutes.&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArgetsingerRucker"/&gt;  Eastwood spent much of his speech time on a largely improvised routine addressing an empty chair representing President [[Barack Obama]].  The speech lasted about 12 minutes, and was characterized by multiple news sources as "rambling."&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ArgetsingerRucker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cassata"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rainey"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Murray"/&gt;  In at least two instances, Eastwood implied the President had uttered profanities directed both at Romney and himself, saying "What do you want me to tell Romney? I can't tell him to do that, he can't do that to himself."&lt;ref name="McNamara"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Following his conversation with the empty chair, Eastwood turned his focus to the delegates and the audience at home, stating in part "But I'd just like to say something&amp;nbsp;... that I think is very important. It is that, you, we, we own this country.&amp;nbsp;... it's not politicians owning it; politicians are employees of ours&amp;nbsp;... And whether you're Democrat or whether you're a Republican or whether you're Libertarian or whatever, you're the best. And we should not ever forget that. And when somebody does not do the job, we got to let 'em go." The speech ends with a reference to "[[Go ahead, make my day]]", spoken by Eastwood character [[Harry Callahan (character)|"Dirty Harry" Callahan]] from the 1983 film ''[[Sudden Impact]]''.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;

Eastwood's speech was viewed live by 30.3 million people, across at least 11 television networks which were broadcasting coverage of the convention. (Those numbers do not count those watching on [[C-SPAN]], whose audience is not measured.)&lt;ref name="deMoraes"/&gt;

}}

Eastwood's remarks were well-received within the convention hall, but responses were mixed outside the hall.&lt;ref name="ArgetsingerRucker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lavender"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zakarin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rainey2"/&gt; His ex-partner [[Frances Fisher]] posted an essay on [[Facebook]] criticizing the speech, and suggested his appearance was a [[publicity stunt]] to sell tickets for his then-upcoming film ''[[Trouble with the Curve]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/frances.fisher.129/posts/10151208629741098|title=Frances Fisher - So I've been asked by numerous friends my... - Facebook|author=|date=|work=facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Film critic [[Roger Ebert]], an Obama supporter, commented, "Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic. He didn't need to do this to himself. It's unworthy of him,"&lt;ref name="McDevitt"/&gt; and later elaborated that while he continues to revere Eastwood as an artist, he opined that Eastwood was "handed the wrong sheet music".&lt;ref name="Ebert"/&gt;  [[Bill Maher]], a comedian and talk show host who has been highly critical of the Republican Party, praised Eastwood's performance and his decision to go off-script during a heavily scripted affair: "As a performer, as a stand-up comedian for 30 years who knows how hard it is to get laughs&amp;nbsp;... he went up there&amp;nbsp;... without a net, on a tightrope. There was no teleprompter. He did a bit with just an empty chair and ''killed''."&lt;ref name="McDevitt2"/&gt; [[Mark Steyn]] spoke particularly favorably of Eastwood's closing statement, referring to it as "some of the hardest lines of the convention".&lt;ref name="Steyn"/&gt; [[Jon Stewart]] commented on the August 31 episode of ''[[The Daily Show]]'' that Eastwood's performance could be understood as a metaphor for the existence of "a President Obama that only Republicans can see", who bears "so little resemblance to the world and the President that I experience."&lt;ref name="DailyShow"/&gt;

Republican Wisconsin Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] described the speech as "that one moment, which I cringed about".&lt;ref name="Sands"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paskin"/&gt; Former Romney adviser [[Mike Murphy (political consultant)|Mike Murphy]] tweeted: "Note to file: Actors need a script."&lt;ref name="Lang"/&gt; Meanwhile, [[Ann Romney]] commented to ''[[CBS This Morning]]'' that Eastwood is "a unique guy and he did a unique thing last night. We appreciated Clint's support. I didn't know it was coming."&lt;ref name="CBSNews08312012"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' quoted unnamed Romney aides describing the Eastwood speech as "strange" and "weird."&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt; One Romney aide described it as "theater of the absurd."&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt; According to ''Double Down'', a book by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann recounting the 2012 Republican campaign, one of Romney's senior strategists, [[Stuart Stevens]], excused himself during Eastwood's performance to vomit in another room in reaction to it.&lt;ref name=vomit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/nov/05/clint-eastwood-odd-obama-speech-republican-romney-convention|title=How Clint Eastwood's odd Obama speech turned Republican stomachs|date= 5 November 2013|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=17 January 2015|author=Xan Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Times'', the Eastwood appearance was cleared by Stevens and another senior campaign leader, [[Russell Schriefer]], who drew up a rough set of talking points for Eastwood.&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt; Staffers reported that unlike other speakers at the convention, there were no rehearsals for Eastwood's speech, nor did they require Eastwood to be on script.&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vomit /&gt;

Staffers also reported that Eastwood's use of the chair was a last-minute decision by the actor himself.&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"/&gt;  Eastwood confirmed this in a September 4 interview with ''The Carmel Pine Cone'': "There was a stool there, and some fella kept asking me if I wanted to sit down. When I saw the stool sitting there, it gave me the idea." Eastwood further elaborated that he purposely avoided preparing for the speech to make it appear unpolished and more appealing to the average citizen.&lt;ref name="Mak"/&gt;

During his speech, Eastwood said, "See, I never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyway," apparently referencing President Obama. Amy Argetsinger of the ''Washington Post'' and Joe Palazzolo of ''The Wall Street Journal'' both noted that Romney has a [[Juris Doctor]];&lt;ref name="Argetsinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Palazzolo"/&gt; as Palazzolo wrote, Romney "is a trained lawyer and a businessman. He earned both his J.D. and his MBA at Harvard University, in a [[Double degree|dual-degree program]]."&lt;ref name="Palazzolo"/&gt; Romney passed the [[Admission to the bar in the United States|Michigan bar exam]], but has never practiced as an attorney, instead pursuing a career in [[management consulting]].&lt;ref name="Hruby"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KranishHelman97"/&gt;

The incident led to the "Eastwooding" [[Internet meme]] spreading via [[Twitter]] whereby people would pose next to empty chairs, sometimes pointing at the chairs.&lt;ref name="Reisinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ngak"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ortiz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tsukayama"/&gt; The episode was also lampooned in ''[[The Onion]]''.&lt;ref name="Onion"/&gt;  The model of chair, designed in 1992 by the Italian architect/designer Sergio Mian, was profiled as well.&lt;ref name="AR"/&gt;  Inspired by the Eastwood speech, a Texas man hanged an empty chair in [[effigy]].&lt;ref name="Gupta"/&gt;

The speech follows a long-standing American tradition of [[empty chair debating]], dating back to at least 1924, as pioneered by [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] vice presidential nominee [[Burton K. Wheeler]].&lt;ref name="Schultz"/&gt; The style of the conversation was noticeably similar to the humorous one-sided conversations popularized by [[Bob Newhart]] in the 1960s; Newhart himself joked in a tweet: "I heard that Clint Eastwood was channeling me at the RNC.  My lawyers and I are drafting our lawsuit."&lt;ref name="Lang2"/&gt; Bloggers have suggested that Eastwood was attempting a form of [[Empty-chair technique|Gestalt therapy]] either for himself or for the Republican Party generally.&lt;ref name="DAILYKOS"/&gt;

In a September 7, 2012, interview with his hometown newspaper, ''The Carmel Pine Cone'', following his speech at the Republican Nation Convention, Eastwood said that "President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people," and "Romney and Ryan would do a much better job running the country, and that's what everybody needs to know. I may have irritated a lot of the lefties, but I was aiming for people in the middle."&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;

Following Obama's poor performance in the [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|first general presidential debate of the 2012 cycle]], Eastwood's empty chair symbol was revived. ''[[The New Yorker]]'' featured a caricature of Romney debating Eastwood's chair (drawn by [[Barry Blitt]]) for its October 15, 2012, edition.&lt;ref name="Mouly"/&gt;

In response to Clint Eastwood's speech, President Obama tweeted a photo himself sitting in the presidential chair at the Cabinet's Table with the caption "This seat's taken."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/clint-eastwood-speech-republican-convention-barack-obama-twitter-367140|title=President Obama Zings Clint Eastwood Via Twitter|author=Aaron Couch|date=30 August 2012|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 2012, the day after President [[Barack Obama]] won reelection, [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] brought a chair onstage at the 2012 BAFTA Britannia Awards and congratulated it. Day-Lewis added: "I love Clint Eastwood, this is no satirical comment on him or his politics...When I saw him talking to a chair in front of a roomful of strangers, I thought: 'I've got to try that.{{'"}}&lt;ref name="Daniel Day Lewis"/&gt;

Several months later, following the election, Eastwood revealed to [[CNBC]] anchor [[Becky Quick]] that his infamous "empty chair" skit had been inspired by a [[Neil Diamond]] song ("I Am... I Said") that had come over the radio in his Tampa hotel room and that included a lyric about an empty chair not hearing the singer's laments.&lt;ref name="McDevitt"/&gt; Eastwood said that the skit was made up on the spot right before he gave it and that if he could, he would say something different if he could have a do-over: "My only message was [that] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked." I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's the way to do it in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yamato|first=Jen|title=Clint Eastwood Says He'd 'Say Something Else' If He Could Have RNC Re-Do|url=http://movieline.com/2012/09/14/clint-eastwood-republican-national-convention-invisible-president-obama-chair/|newspaper=Movieline|date=September 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair prop itself was transported from Florida to the offices of [[Reince Priebus]], the former Chairman of the Republican National Committee.&lt;ref name="Levy"/&gt; While the chair is among many pieces of political memorabilia in Priebus' office, it is the first item he points out to reporters.&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt;

===Notes===
&lt;small&gt;
{{note|1|1}} John and Kerry were yellow-carded without being voted off on the beginning of day 7 for timekeeping issues, for example if timekeeping issues continue they would have been removed with a second yellow card and a red card on following days.

{{note|2|2}} Alan and Lorenzo were removed with a red card on Day 14 because of the pair not bothering to get out of bed in the morning. The pair had a hangover because they were partying with recent leavers Kat and Clare the night before and felt it was time to walk coinciding with the departure of their friends. Brendan had no choice but to give the pair a red card and to leave them with a £374 hotel bill amid complaints from other guests regarding the previous night's revelry.

{{note|3|3}} Doris &amp; Ann were banned from voting, but they were eligible to being voted for, due to them coming last in the quiz and then didn't receive any votes on that day but Ivor &amp; Andrea were immune from any votes, but they could vote, due to them winning the quiz.

{{note|4|4}} Votes were cancelled due to the news of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|7 July 2005]].

{{note|5|5}} Victoria and Jackson were removed with a red card on Day 21 for not wanting to continue on the tour.

{{note|6|6}} Ivor and Andrea were removed with a red card on Day 23 for overtaking Day 22's vote and refusing to continue into the final day.

'''Commerce''' is a 19th-century gambling French [[card game]] akin to [[Thirty-one (card game)|Thirty-one]] and perhaps ancestral to Whisky [[Poker]] and [[Stop the Bus (card game)|Bastard Brag]]. It aggregates a variety of games with the same game mechanics. '''Trade and Barter''', the English equivalent, has the same combinations, but a different way of acquiring them. '''Trentuno''', ''Trent-et-Uno'', applies basically to the same method of play, but also has slightly different combinations.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, p. 70 - Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Object==
Like any other game of the Commerce group, the aim is to finish with the best three-card combination in hand. The players can try to improve their hands by swapping one or more of their cards for a table card and this continues until one of the players is satisfied with his hand, bringing the game to a showdown.

==Gameplay==
Commerce is usually played by 3-10 players, although any number can play. The game is played with a complete pack of 52 cards ranking A K Q J T 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2. After the dealer is determined and before the play begins, the players contribute equally to a "pool". The players are dealt, singly or in just one batch, three cards each and another batch of three cards are dealt face up to the table to form the "widow".

Before looking at his own cards, the dealer may exchange one or two of his cards for one or two of the exposed cards on the table, putting his own, face upwards, in their place. His object is to "make his hand", but if he exchanges all three cards at once he cannot do it again. Thereafter, each in turn, starting with the eldest, can do likewise.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle's Card Games, Lawrence H. Dawson, p. 231 - Routledge {{ISBN|978-0-415-00880-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually there are as many rounds in the game as there are players, and a fresh card is added to the "widow" at the beginning of each. A player who is satisfied with his cards then knocks on the table instead of playing, and play ceases as soon as two players have knocked. When the rounds are finished the players show their cards and the holder of the best combination receives the stake deposited in the "pool", while the player with the worst hand puts one counter called "Going up" therein. The player whose three are first gone off may purchase one more, called "Buying a horse", for a sum usually one third of the original stake, or as agreed, to be put into the pool. After that, every player, whose counters are gone must wait until the game comes to an end, which is concluded by the player who continues longer in the game, thereby gaining the final sweep.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle's improved edition for playing fashionable games, Edmond Hoyle, p. 137 - Thomas, Cowperthwait &amp; Co. Philadelphia 1838&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinations==
The best combinations are, from high to low:

# Tricon - three of a kind being Ace best, and so on down to the 2.
# Sequence - three cards of the same suit and sequence, being A K Q best down to 3 2 A.
# Flush - three cards of the same suit, the highest "point" wins.
# Pair - two similar cards, the highest pair winning.
# Point - the greatest value of cards regardless of their suit, counting Ace 11, Courts 10 each, and numerals their face value.

In case of a tie between two or more of the players in any round, the highest Tricon wins, coming Aces first, then Kings, Queens, down to Twos. If the tie happens to be in a sequence,  the highest wins, reckoning the A K Q sequence as the best and the 3 2 A sequence as the lowest. If with Flushes, the one making the best "point" wins. If Pairs, the highest wins and if two hands are alike, then the holder of the highest third card has the preference. With Point a tie is very rare, but if that does happen, the holder of the first highest card different from the opponent's wins.

==Variations==

===&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;Pounce&lt;/span&gt;===

There are several variations of the game and Pounce, or ''Pounce Coommerce'', seems to be the most popular variation of Commerce. In this, if a player has already three similar cards, e.g. three Nines, and the fourth Nine comes into the pool, he says "Pounce" and takes it, thus obtaining a hand of four, which is higher than any hand of three: whenever a pounce occurs, a new card is turned up from the pack.

===&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;Trade and Barter&lt;/span&gt;===

The game is played the same way as in the original Commerce, only that there is no "widow". The aim is to have the best Commerce hand, that is, a tricon, sequence or point. Starting with the eldest, each in turn must exchange one card by announcing "trade" or "barter". If the player says "trade", he passes a card face down to the dealer and receives another from the stock, paying the dealer one chip for this privilege. If he says "barter", he exchanges one card sight unseen with his right-hand neighbour, but without payment. The play continues until one of the players knocks.

If two players show a hand with the same point value, a three-card beats a two-card flush and if still equal, the winning hand is that of the dealer if he is still involved in the play, otherwise that of the first in order of play after the dealer.

===&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;Trentuno&lt;/span&gt;===

In this variation a 40-card deck is used. The best hand when someone knocks is that of the player containing cards of the same suit totaling 31 points or the nearest below it. Three of a kind is a special hand ranking between 30 and 31 points.

===&lt;span style="color:black;"&gt;Extended Commerce&lt;/span&gt;===

This is only applicable to the modern mode of playing the game, which is extended until all the players are satisfied with their hands. They may keep on trading until they all receive cards good enough to stand upon. The great objection to this variation of the game is that it is wearisome because the players have to wait until all the others are satisfied with their cards.

The combinations "pair" and "point" are not recognized.

A '''source''' or '''sender''' is one of the basic concepts of [[communication]] and [[information processing]]. Sources  are objects which [[wikt:encode|encode]] [[message]] [[data]] and [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmit]] the [[information]], via a [[channel (communications)|channel]], to one or more [[observation|observer]]s (or [[receiver (information theory)|receivers]]).

In the strictest sense of the word, particularly in [[information theory]], a ''source'' is a process that generates message data that one would like to communicate, or reproduce as exactly as possible elsewhere in space or time.  A source may be modelled as memoryless, [[ergodic]], [[Stationary process|stationary]], or [[stochastic]], in order of increasing generality.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2690">'''Dimestore soldiers''' are a name first given by collector and author Don Pielin to American made [[toy soldier]]s sold individually in [[five and dime store]]s from the 1930s to the 1950s before being replaced by plastic toy soldiers called [[army men]]. Though most figures were [[hollowcast]] metal, [[Composite material|composition]] and plastic dimestore figures were also made. The popularity of the toy soldier reflected public interest in wars around the world and America's own military [[preparedness]] of the era.

==Rise and fall==
As opposed to the standard 54mm size popularised by [[W. Britain|Britains]] figures, the minimally painted dimestore figures were 3&amp;nbsp;inches/7&amp;nbsp;cm in size to correspond with the American made standard gauge [[toy train]]s of the time.&lt;ref&gt;p.5 Pielin, Don, Joplin, Norman &amp; Johnson, Verne ''American Dimestore Toy Soldiers &amp; Figures'' 2000 Schiffer Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; Though they had made smaller sized figures previously, Barclay began their 3&amp;nbsp;inch size in 1924 with the figures made of 87% lead and 13% [[antimony]].

The largest manufacture of toy soldier in the United States in the 1930s and early 1940s was the [[Barclay Manufacturing Company]].&lt;ref&gt;p.61 O'Brien, Richard ''Collecting American Made Toy Soldiers Edition #3'' 1997 Books Americana&lt;/ref&gt; Prices of the soldiers were mostly kept to five cents, a [[Nickel (United States coin)|nickel]] during this time, making them affordable to children. Other manufacturers made similar figures in mostly comparable sizes. The soldier's uniforms changed with military fashion, going from high collar to open collar and from [[puttees]] to [[leggings]].

In 1942 lead toy production ceased with American toy soldiers being manufactured in composition, plastic and paper. Production resumed in 1945 with moulds reconfigured to the [[M1 Helmet]] but prices rose to 10 and later 15 cents. In the early 1950s Barclay conserved metal by designing new figures with a large "pod foot" instead of the usual base. However the low cost of mass amounts of unpainted plastic figures, the increasing cost of the price of metal and scares of the dangers of metal toys lead to the demise of the dimestore soldier.

Barclay's biggest rival the [[Manoil Manufacturing Co.]] ceased trading in 1959. Barclay ceased trading in 1971.

== Background ==
The series is presented by Algerian singer, actress, TV presenter and producer Rym Ghazali, alongside the YouTuber Chemseddine Lamrani, better known as DZjoker.

The idea of the program is to invite guests to different locations, and record them on [[hidden camera]] while they get in a frightening situation. The show mixes the actual images with scenes in which the participant views the hidden camera footage and comments on it.&lt;ref name="algpress.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elhiwardz.com"&gt;[http://elhiwardz.com/?p=85564 Artists News – El Wa3ra Program.](in Arabic).

'''Foley''' (named after sound-effects artist [[Jack Foley (sound effects artist)|Jack Foley]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinemontage.org/2016/02/called-foley-anyway/ |title=Why Is It Called ‘Foley’ Anyway? |last=Almo |first=Laura |date=February 1, 2016 |website=Cinemontage |access-date=June 13, 2018 |quote=The art remained in the shadows for many years. A function of history and tradition, Foley artists, as they came to be named, never received screen credit. Around the 1970s, sound editors were doing their own syncing (as it was called before becoming officially known as Foley), and realized they could hire outsiders to do this time- consuming and specialized work.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the reproduction of everyday [[sound effect]]s that are added to film, video, and other media in [[post-production]] to enhance audio quality.&lt;ref name="videomaker1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.videomaker.com/article/7220/ |title=Stinson, Jim.

The best Foley art is so well integrated into a [[film]] that it goes unnoticed by the [[audience]].&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger"&gt;Singer, Philip R. "Art Of Foley". Marblehead Publishing Co. Web. 1 July 2010. {{cite web |url=http://www.marblehead.net/foley |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809070842/http://www.marblehead.net/foley/ |archivedate=9 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It helps to create a sense of reality within a scene. Without these crucial [[background noise]]s, movies feel unnaturally quiet and uncomfortable.

Foley artists recreate the realistic [[Background noise|ambient sounds]] that the film portrays. The props and sets of a film often do not react the same way acoustically as their real life counterparts.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; Foley sounds are used to enhance the auditory experience of the movie. Foley can also be used to cover up unwanted sounds captured on the set of a movie during filming, such as overflying airplanes or passing traffic.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;

The term "Foley" also means a place, such as '''Foley-stage''' or '''Foley-studio''', where the Foley process takes place.

==History==
[[Image:Broadcasting a radio play at NBC studio.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|An early sound effects man (right) adding effects to a live radio play in the 1920s. He holds an effects board with which he can simulate ringing telephones and closing doors.]]
What is now called Foley originated as sound effects added to live broadcasts of radio drama from radio studios around the world in the early 1920s. Phonograph recordings of the era were not of sufficient quality or flexibility to faithfully reproduce most sound effects on cue, so a sound effects person had to create all sounds for radio plays live. [[Jack Foley (sound effects artist)|Jack Donovan Foley]]&lt;ref name="AllThingsConsidered"&gt;Considered, All Things. "[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3207126 Jack Foley: Feet to the Stars] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170915220717/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3207126 |date=15 September 2017 }}: NPR." NPR : National Public Radio : News &amp; Analysis, World, US, Music &amp; Arts : NPR. Mar.-Apr. 2000. Web. 2 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; started working with [[Universal Pictures|Universal Studios]] in 1914 during the silent movie era. When Warner studios released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', its first film to include sound, Universal knew it needed to stay competitive and called for any employees who had radio experience to come forward.&lt;ref name="AllThingsConsidered" /&gt; Foley became part of the sound crew that turned Universal's then-upcoming "silent" musical ''[[Show Boat (1929 film)|Show Boat]]'' into a musical. Because [[microphone]]s of the time could not pick up more than [[dialogue]], other sounds had to be added in after the film was shot.&lt;ref name="AllThingsConsidered" /&gt; Foley and his small crew projected the film on a screen while recording a single track of audio that captured their live [[sound effect]]s.&lt;ref name="AllThingsConsidered" /&gt; Their timing had to be perfect, so that footsteps and closing doors synchronized with the actors' motions in the film. Jack Foley created sounds for films until his death in 1967.&lt;ref name="AllThingsConsidered" /&gt; His basic methods are still used today.

Modern Foley art has progressed as recording technology has progressed. Today, sounds do not have to be recorded live on a single track of audio. They can be captured separately on individual tracks and carefully synchronized with their visual counterpart.&lt;ref name="LeslieBloom"&gt;Bloom, Leslie. "YouTube – Leslie Bloome – Foley Artist." YouTube – Broadcast Yourself. Nov.-Dec. 2009. Web. 1 July 2010. {{YouTube|wx32-L9tJcE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley studios employ hundreds of props and digital effects to recreate the ambient sounds of their films.

== Uses ==
Foley complements or replaces sound recorded on set at the time of the filming, known as [[field recording]]. The [[soundscape]] of most films uses a combination of both. A Foley artist is the person who creates this sound art. Foley artists use creativity to make viewers believe that the sound effects are actually real. The viewers should not be able to realize that the sound was not actually part of the filming process itself. Foley sounds are added to the film in post production after the film has been shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sound Ideas |url=http://www.sound-ideas.com/foleymavart.html |title=What is Foley? by Skevos Mavros |publisher=Sound Ideas |date= |access-date=2010-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603120229/http://www.sound-ideas.com/foleymavart.html |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for replacing or enhancing sounds in a film production arises from the fact that, very often, the original sounds captured during shooting are obstructed by noise or are not convincing enough to underscore the visual effect or action. For example, fist-fighting scenes in an action movie are usually staged by the stunt actors and therefore do not have the actual sounds of blows landing. Crashes and explosions are often added or enhanced at the post-production stage. The desired effect is to add back to the original soundtrack the sounds that were excluded during recording. By excluding these sounds during field recording, and then adding them back into the soundtrack during post-production, the editors have complete control over how each noise sounds, its quality, and the relative volume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sound Ideas |url=http://www.sound-ideas.com/foleymavart.html |title=Mavros, Skevos.

MavArt Productions 2000 Web.10 Jul 2009 |publisher=Sound-ideas.com |date= |access-date=2010-05-20 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603120229/http://www.sound-ideas.com/foleymavart.html |archivedate=3 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foley effects add depth and realism to the audio quality for multimedia sources.&lt;ref name="videomaker1999" /&gt;

Foley artists review the film as it runs to figure out what sounds they need to achieve the desired sound and results. Once they gather the material and prepare for use, they practice the sounds. When they accomplish the desired sound, they watch the film and add in the sound effects at the same time. This is similar to the way actors re-record dialogue, lip-syncing to the video or film image.

Scenes where dialogue is replaced using [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbing]] also feature Foley sounds. [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|Automatic dialogue replacement]] (ADR) is the process in which voice sounds are recorded in post production. This is done by a machine that runs the voice sounds with the film forward and backward to get the sound to run with the film.{{citation needed|reason=what does this refer to?|date=January 2016}} The objective of the ADR technique is to add sound effects into the film after filming, so the voice sounds are synchronized. Many sounds are not added at the time of filming, and microphones might not capture a sound the way the audience expects to hear it.&lt;ref&gt;Pramaggiore, Maria, and Tom Wallis. Film: A Critical Introduction. 2 ed. London: Laurence King Publishing Ltd., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The need for Foley rose dramatically when studios began to distribute films internationally, dubbed in other languages. As dialogue is replaced, all sound effects recorded at the time of the dialogue are lost as well.

==Creation==
Foley is created by the sound artist mimicking the actual sound source in a [[recording studio]].&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; Often there are many little sound effects that happen within any given scene of a movie. The process of recording them all can be time-consuming.

Foley art can be broken down into three main categories&amp;nbsp;— '''feet''', '''moves''', and '''specifics'''.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;

===Feet===
The category entails the sound of footsteps.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; To make the sound of walking down a staircase, Foley artists stomp their feet on a marble slab while watching the footage. Foley studios carry many different types of shoes and several different types of floors to create footstep sounds.&lt;ref name="LeslieBloom" /&gt; These floors, known as Foley Pits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://npbonds.com/?page_id=5|title=Foley Construction – Noah Bonds|author=|date=|website=npbonds.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208154522/http://npbonds.com/?page_id=5|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; vary from marble squares to gravel and rock pits. Creating just the right sound of footsteps can greatly enhance the feel of a scene. Foley Artists are often referred to as "Foley Walkers" or "Steppers" when working in the "feet" subset of Foley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marblehead.net/foley/feet.html|title=The Art of Foley - Feet|author=|date=|website=www.marblehead.net|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117044547/http://www.marblehead.net/foley/feet.html|archivedate=17 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moves===
The “moves” category makes up many of the more subtle sounds heard in films, for example, the swishing of clothing when two actors walk past each other.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; This sound is created by rubbing two pieces of the same material together near the microphone at the same rate that the actor’s legs cross.&lt;ref name="LeslieBloom" /&gt; Cloth is not always used and tends to be recorded at the discretion of the dubbing mixer who ultimately controls the final outcome of the audio post-production process.

===Specifics===
Foley can also include other sounds, such as doors closing and doorbells ringing; however, these tend to be done more efficiently using stock sound effects, arranged by sound editors.

Foley effects help the viewer judge the size of a space. For example, a large hall has strong reverberation, while a small room may have only slight reverberation.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; Open outdoor spaces usually have no reverberation at all.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===Common tricks===
{{prose|date=October 2015}}
*Corn starch in a leather pouch makes the sound of snow crunching.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;†
*A pair of gloves sounds like bird wings flapping.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*An arrow or thin stick makes a whoosh.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*An old chair makes a controllable creaking sound.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*A water-soaked rusty hinge when placed against different surfaces makes a creaking sound. Different surfaces change the sound considerably.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*A heavy staple gun combined with other small metal sounds make good gun noises.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*A metal rake makes the rattle/squeak sound of chain-link fence; it can also make a metallic screech when dragged across a piece of metal.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*A heavy car door and fender can create most of the car sounds needed, but having a whole car in the studio is better.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*Burning plastic garbage bags cut into strips makes a realistic sounding candle or soft non-crackling fire when the bag melts and drips to the ground.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*¼-inch audio tape balled up sounds like grass or brush when walked upon.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*Gelatin and hand soap make squishing noises.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*Frozen romaine lettuce makes bone or head injury noises.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*Coconut shells cut in half and stuffed with padding makes horse hoof noises;&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt; this is parodied in ''[[Monty Python and the Holy Grail]]'' and in ''[[Shrek the Third]]''.
*Cellophane creates crackling fire effects.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;†
*A selection of wooden and metal doors is needed to create all sorts of door noises, but also can be used for creaking boat sounds.&lt;ref name="PhilipSinger" /&gt;
*Acorns, small apples and walnuts on a wooden parquet surface can be used for bones breaking
*Canned dog food can be used for alien pod embryo expulsions and monster vocalizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Epic Sound |url=http://www.epicsound.com/sfx |title=The Guide To Sound Effects by David Filskov |publisher=Epic Sound |date= |access-date=2013-11-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113142047/http://www.epicsound.com/sfx/ |archivedate=13 November 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=January 2010}}
'''''Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Food Chain''''' is a trade paperback collecting comic stories based on the ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' television series. 'Food Chain'' was the largest ''Buffy'' graphic novel to come out before the ''Buffy: Omnibus'' volumes.

==Story description==
===General synopsis===

''Food Chain'' contains a collection of several ''Buffy'' stories that take place across three years.

===Food Chain (Part 1)===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer #12'' (under the title "A Nice Girl Like You").

A new girl has arrived in [[Sunnydale]]. She seems to the school to be a sweet and intelligent high-school senior. However, strangely, she decides to spend time with delinquents. [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] believes there is something odd about her.

===Food Chain (Part 2)===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer #16'' (under the title "Food Chain").

Buffy Summers hopes to relax with her friends, but a demonic force strikes Sunnydale and leads to a number of deaths. Even though she disliked those who have died, she must get to the bottom of the mystery.

===Double Cross===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer #20''.

Set directly after [[Graduation Day, Part Two (Buffy episode)|Graduation Day, Part Two]] when Angel had left for L.A., and Buffy was preparing for life without him in Sunnydale. Demonic forces had hoped to exploit the separation of these two powerful enemies, but Buffy and Angel are closer than such forces could imagine.

===Bad Dog===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer Annual 1999''.

It's that time of the month for Oz, but the wolf escapes from the library. Buffy eventually tracks down werewolf-Oz, then uses him to track Willow. Willow has been kidnapped by Alan Duffy, a normal kid with a desperate taste for the supernatural.

===The Latest Craze===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer Annual 1999''.

What happens when owning miniature demons becomes a fad for the rich and snooty.

===Punish Me With Kisses===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Lovers' Walk''.

Willow and Tara, on their way to find a powerful flower, meet a ghostly couple and help them to resolve their differences.

===One Small Promise===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Lovers' Walk''.

Buffy gives Riley a present, Riley is surprised by the offer of jewelry, then the two dispose of a group of vampires.

===City of Despair===

:Originally appeared in ''Buffy/Angel #½'' (published jointly by [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] and [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]).

Buffy and Angel confront each other in another dimension, and seemingly battle against each other.

==Continuity==

Supposed to be set in ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'''s third and fourth seasons.

===Canonical issues===
{{Main|Buffyverse canon}}

[[Buffy comics]] such as this one are not usually considered by fans as [[Buffyverse canon#Canon|canonical]]. Some fans consider them stories from the imaginations of authors and artists, while other fans consider them as taking place in an alternative fictional reality. However unlike [[fan fiction]], overviews summarising their story, written early in the writing process, were 'approved' by both Fox and [[Joss Whedon]] (or his office), and the books were therefore later published as officially Buffy merchandise.

However, two of the stories in the ''Food Chain'' collection – "Bad Dog" and "Double Cross" – were written by ''Buffy'' television writer [[Doug Petrie]].

In ''City of Despair'', the character [[Hellboy]] makes a background appearance as one of the captured demons. Hellboy also made a cameo in ''[[Past Lives (comics)|Past Lives]]'' as a bust in Giles' office.

For example, a chess-playing computer program cannot play [[Draughts|checkers]]. A general game playing system, if well designed, would be able to help in other areas, such as in providing intelligence for search and rescue missions.

== Stanford project ==
''General Game Playing'' is a project of the Stanford Logic Group of [[Stanford University]], California, which aims to create a platform for general game playing. It is the most well-known effort at standardizing GGP AI, and generally seen as the standard for GGP systems. The games are defined by sets of rules represented in the [[Game Description Language]]. In order to play the games, players interact with a game hosting server&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/ggpserver/ GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://130.208.241.192/ggpserver/ Dresden GGP Server], platform for competition of general game playing systems with automatic scheduling of matches.&lt;/ref&gt; that monitors moves for legality and keeps players informed of state changes.

Since 2005, there have been annual General Game Playing competitions at the [[AAAI]] Conference. The competition judges competitor AI's abilities to play a variety of different games, by recording their performance on each individual game. In the first stage of the competition, entrants are judged on their ability to perform legal moves, gain the upper hand, and complete games faster. In the following runoff round, the AIs face off against each other in increasingly complex games. The AI that wins the most games at this stage wins the competition, and until 2013 its creator used to win a $10,000 prize.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; So far, the following programs were victorious:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.general-game-playing.de/|title=General Game Playing|website=www.general-game-playing.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other approaches ==
There are other general game playing systems, which use their own languages for defining the game rules. In 1992, [[Barney Pell]] defined the concept of Meta-Game Playing, and developed the "MetaGame" system. This was the first program to automatically generate game rules of chess-like games, and one of the earliest programs to use automated game generation.  Pell then developed the system ''Metagamer''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barneypell.com/games_research.html Barney Pell's research on computer game playing].&lt;/ref&gt; This system was able to play a number of chess-like games, given game rules definition in a special language called Game Description Language, without any human interaction once the games were generated.&lt;ref name="satirist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satirist.org/learn-game/projects/metagame.html|website=Metagame and General Game Playing|title=Metagame and General Game Playing|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the commercial system [[Zillions of Games]] was developed by Jeff Mallett and Mark Lefler. The system used a LISP-like language to define the game rules. Zillions of Games derived the [[evaluation function]] automatically from the game rules based on piece mobility, board structure and game goals. It also employed usual algorithms as found in [[computer chess]] systems: [[alpha-beta pruning]] with move ordering, [[transposition table]]s, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/comp.ai.games/browse_thread/thread/c3f734729a107d22/a25c735d6a0693db?&amp;hl=en#a25c735d6a0693db  Available: Universal Game Engine] email to comp.ai.games by Jeff Mallett, 10-Dec-1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  The package was extended in 2007 by the addition of the Axiom plug-in, an alternate metagame engine that incorporates a complete Forth-based programming language.

The [[General video game playing|General Video Game AI Competition]] ([http://gvgai.net/ GVGAI]) has been running since 2014. In this competition, two-dimensional video games similar to (and sometimes based on) 80s-era arcade and console games are used instead of the board games used in the GGP competition.

== Algorithms ==
Since GGP AI must be designed to play multiple games, its design cannot rely on algorithms created specifically for certain games. Instead, the AI must be designed using algorithms whose methods can be applied to a wide range of games. The AI must also be an ongoing process, that can adapt to its current state rather than the output of previous states. For this reason, [[Open-loop controller|open loop]] techniques are often most effective.

A popular method for developing GGP AI is the [[Monte Carlo tree search]] (MCTS) algorithm.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228393769_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search_for_General_Game_Playing|title=Monte-Carlo Tree Search for General Game Playing|website=ResearchGate|access-date=2016-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often used together with the UCT method (''Upper Confidence Bound applied to Trees''), variations of MCTS have been proposed to better play certain games, as well as to make it compatible with video game playing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Finnsson|first=Hilmar|date=2012|title=Generalized Monte-Carlo Tree Search Extensions for General Game Playing|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI12/paper/viewFile/4935/5300|journal=Proceedings of the Twenty-Sixth AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Frydenberg2015Investigating.pdf|title=Investigating MCTS Modifications in General Video Game Playing|last=Frydenberg|first=Frederik|last2=Anderson|first2=Kasper R.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Risi|first3=Sebastian|last4=Togelius|first4=Julian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Swiechowski; J. Mandziuk; Y. S. Ong, "Specialization of a UCT-based General Game Playing Program to Single-Player Games," in ''IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games'', vol.PP, no.99, pp.1-1 doi: 10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2391232&lt;/ref&gt; Another variation of tree search algorithms used is the Directed [[Breadth-first search|Breadth First Search]] (DBS), in which a child node to the current state is created for each available action, and visits each child ordered by highest average reward, until either the game ends or runs out of time.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/OpenLoopGVG.pdf|title=Open Loop Search for General Video Game Playing|last=Perez|first=Diego|last2=Dieskau|first2=Jens|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Hünermund|first3=Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each tree search method, the AI simulates potential actions and ranks each based on the average highest reward of each path, in terms of points earned.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Assumptions ===
In order to interact with games, algorithms must operate under the assumption that games all share common characteristics. In the book ''Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Worlds and Fictional Worlds'', Jesper Juul gives the following definition of games: Games are based on rules, they have variable outcomes, different outcomes give different values, player effort influences outcomes, the player is attached to the outcomes, and the game has negotiable consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Jesper Juul. Half-Real: Video Games Between Real Rules and Fictional Worlds. MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  Using these assumptions, game playing AI can be created by quantifying the player input, the game outcomes, and how the various rules apply, and using algorithms to compute the most favorable path.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy|first8=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GVGP could potentially be used to create real [[video game AI]] automatically, as well as "to test game environments, including those created automatically using procedural content generation and to find potential loopholes in the gameplay that a human player could exploit".&lt;ref name="gvgp" /&gt; GVGP has also been used to generate game rules, and estimate a game's quality based on Relative Algorithm Performance Profiles (RAPP), which compare the skill differentiation that a game allows between good AI and bad AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://julian.togelius.com/Nielsen2015Towards.pdf|title=Towards generating arcade game rules with VGDL|last=Nielsen|first=Thorbjørn S.|last2=Barros|first2=Gabriella A. B.|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Togelius|first3=Julian|last4=Nelson|first4=Mark J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2014, the General Video Game Playing Competition ([http://gvgai.net/ GVGAI]) has offered a way for researchers and practitioners to test and compare their best general video game playing algorithms. The competition has an associated software framework including a large number of games written in the Video Game Description Language (VGDL). VGDL can be used to describe a game specifically for procedural generation of levels, using Answer Set Programming (ASP) and an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). GVGP can then be used to test the validity of procedural levels, as well as the difficulty or quality of levels based on how an agent performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.diego-perez.net/papers/PLG_ASP_GVG.pdf|title=Procedural Level Generation with Answer Set Programming for General Video Game Playing|last=Neufeld|first=Xenija|last2=Mostaghim|first2=Sanaz|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Perez-Liebana|first3=Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The games used in GVGP are, for now, often 2 dimensional arcade games, as they are the simplest and easiest to quantify.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://people.idsia.ch/~tom/publications/dagstuhl-gvgp.pdf|title=General Video Game Playing|last=Levine|first=John|last2=Congdon|first2=Clare Bates|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=|last3=Ebner|first3=Marc|last4=Kendall|first4=Graham|last5=Lucas|first5=Simon M.|last6=Miikkulainen Risto|first6=Schaul|last7=Tom|first7=Thompson|last8=Tommy|first8=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To simplify the process of creating an AI that can interpret video games, games for this purpose are written in [[Game Description Language|Video Game Description Language]] (VGDL), which is a coding language using simple semantics and commands that can easily be parsed.

'''George Joseph Hrab''' (born June 8, 1971 in [[Belleville, New Jersey]]) is a drummer, guitarist, composer and [[podcaster]] known for performing rock, [[funk]] and [[jazz]] and for exploring [[atheist]],&lt;ref name="Press2008"/&gt; [[scientific skepticism|skeptic]] and science themes in his work.&lt;ref name=GerbicCSICOP2016 /&gt;  He has released six albums as a solo artist.

Hrab was born in [[Belleville, New Jersey]] and grew up speaking [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and surrounded by [[Ukrainian culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Howell, Dave. [http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-george-hrab-bethlehem-ice-house-20160121-story.html "George Hrab to perform his 'Broad Street Score' in Bethlehem"], ''[[The Morning Call]]'', January 21, 2016. Accessed December 3, 2017. "The 44-year-old Hrab (pronounced with a near silent 'h') was born in Belleville, N.J. His parents immigrated to the United States as youngsters. 'I grew up speaking Ukrainian, went to Ukrainian Saturday school, ski and canoe trips, and scouts. You were given demerits if you spoke English,' he says."&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated from [[Montclair Kimberley Academy]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mka.org/mobile.cfm?p=734&amp;newsid=445 MKA Alumni Return to Campus for Career Day], [[Montclair Kimberley Academy]]. Accessed December 3, 2017. "Representing the arts, George Hrab ’89 returned to talk about a life in the music industry, Amanda Englander ’04 discussed her work as an editor in book publishing and Christian Langbein ’00 explained how to navigate the world of fashion."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical career==
Hrab performs in several genres of music, but most often in rock and funk.  His lyrics are often witty&lt;ref name="Wacker"&gt;{{Citation | title=Geological Orchestra packs Ice House | newspaper=The Bethlehem News | date=November 16, 2006 | page=13 | author=Wacker, George }}&lt;/ref&gt; and his songs often reflect his interest in science and skepticism.&lt;ref name="GerbicCSICOP2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerbic|first1=Susan|authorlink=Susan Gerbic|title=A Conversation with George Hrab|url=http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/a_conversation_with_george_hrab|website=CSICOP.org|accessdate=26 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023657/http://www.csicop.org/specialarticles/show/a_conversation_with_george_hrab|archivedate=8 November 2016|date=28 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrab lists [[Frank Zappa]] and [[David Byrne]] as key influences. "You can shake your ass to it, but it's still really smart and interesting," he says.&lt;ref name="Merge2005"&gt;{{Citation | title=George Hrab: To the (naked) beat of his own drum | author=Salerno, Gabrielle | date=November 9–15, 2005 | magazine=Merge | publisher=[[The Morning Call]] | volume=1 | issue=33 | pages=14–15 | url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/me-hrab1109,0,1043424.story | accessdate=April 21, 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629144234/http://www.baltimoresun.com/topic/me-hrab1109,0,1043424.story | archivedate=June 29, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has described his style of music with one word: Philosophunk! "I’m a big fan of [[Frank Zappa]], [[Talking Heads]], [[XTC]], the [[Beatles]], and things like that.  Those are my influences, but at the same time, I’m a huge fan of [[Stan Freberg]] and [[James Randi]] and [[Michael Shermer]] and those kinda guys. So it’s sort of like philosophy and music… What I do is I coalesce the vapors of the universe."&lt;ref name="skepticality_14" /&gt;

Hrab has released six albums since 1997 as an [[independent music]]ian. One of Hrab's unique approaches as an indie is to customize the packaging of each his albums. One features a tin box, one in a DVD case, etc. "Each one stands out as a piece of art, giving his fans a genuine reason to buy the physical disc as merchandise, not just a music holder."&lt;ref name="indie"&gt;{{cite book | author=Chertkow, Randy | author2=Feehan, Jason | year=2008 | title=The Indie Band Survival Guide: The Complete Manual for the Do-It-Yourself Musician | location=New York City | publisher=[[St. Martin's Griffin]] | isbn=978-0-312-37768-7 | oclc=184822902 | pages=147–148, 227 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Aside from his solo work, Hrab has been a member of many bands over the course of his career, he listed the entire history in one episode of his podcast.&lt;ref name="podcast085"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_85 | title=Episode #85 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=October 2, 2008 | accessdate=September 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable groups are listed below.

===Eric Mintel Quartet===
In 1998 Hrab was the touring drummer for the Eric Mintel [[Quartet]], and recorded one jazz album with them. The highlight of this tour was when the group played "cool '50s swing" at the [[Kennedy Center]]&lt;ref name="Terlesky"&gt;{{Citation | title=Drummer digs his own groove with the Geologic Orchestra | author=Terlesky, John | date=November 2002 | magazine=Go Guide | publisher=[[The Morning Call]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[White House]] Christmas party.&lt;ref name="ModernDrummer"/&gt;

===Philadelphia Funk Authority===
Hrab's "day job" is playing drums for a [[Philadelphia]]-area band called the Philadelphia Funk Authority.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Terlesky"/&gt; The nine-member band was formed in 1999 and plays corporate, private and club gigs in the region around Philadelphia and also tours nationwide. The group has shared the stage with [[Elton John]] and other acts.&lt;ref name="Funky"&gt;{{Citation | title=It's funky time with Philadelphia Funk Authority | newspaper=The Express-Times | date=August 12, 2005 | page=E-20 | author=Kalan, Susan }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being featured on the podcast [[Skepticality]]&lt;ref name="skepticality_14"&gt;{{Citation | title=Ep. #014 – Philosophunk! Interview: George Hrab (Musical Guest) | date=August 1, 2005 | url=http://www.skepticality.com/philosophunk/

There he performed and met many podcasters who became interested in featuring his music.  He credits this exposure for worldwide interest in his music. "Folks from Australia and Singapore who should have no idea who I am have downloaded songs and bought albums. That is purely due to podcasts," Hrab said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Morris, Tee | authorlink=Tee Morris | author2=Evo Terra | author2-link=Evo Terra | author3=Williams, Ryan | year=2008 | title=Expert Podcasting Practices for Dummies | series= —For dummies | location=[[Hoboken, New Jersey]] | publisher=Wiley Publications | page=168 | url=http://proquest.safaribooksonline.com/9780470149263 | isbn=978-0-470-14926-3 | oclc=243693217 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Hrab.jpg|left|thumb|George Hrab with fans at [[JREF]]'s [[The Amazing Meeting]] July 7, 2009]]
Around the same time (summer of 2006),&lt;ref&gt;Geologic Radio Hour ran on WLVR from May 23, 2006 to September 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hrab hosted a weekly program called ''The Geologic Radio Hour'' on the [[Lehigh University]] radio station [[WLVR]]. Listed as "free form eclectic" and running at midnight on Tuesdays, it featured spoken word segments and a number of comedy sketches developed by Hrab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060709010549/http://www.wlvr.org/schedule.html | url=http://www.wlvr.org/schedule.html | archivedate=July 9, 2006 | accessdate=April 23, 2010 | title=WLVR Summer Break 2006 Community Staff Schedule | publisher=WLVR 91.3 FM Bethlehem }}&lt;/ref&gt; (a segment of one of the programs is available on Hrab's website)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Geologic Podcast First Run | date=January 23, 2007 | work=The Geologic Podcast | url=http://geologicpodcast.com/geologic_podcast_first_run | accessdate=September 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the experience of the radio program and the contacts made in podcasting in 2006, and encouraged by his friend and producer [[Slau]],&lt;ref name="mc500" /&gt; Hrab launched his own podcast in February 2007.&lt;ref name="podcast001"&gt;{{cite web | title= A Geologic Valentine: Episode #1 | url=http://geologicpodcast.com/a_geologic_valentine_episode_1 | author=Hrab, George | work=The Geologic Podcast | date=February 14, 2007 | accessdate=September 30, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Geologic Podcast''===
The ''Geologic Podcast'' is a weekly podcast consisting of personal stories, comedy sketches, news commentary, music and interviews, starring Hrab. The content often draws from Hrab's musical career, the music industry in general and from topics that relate to skepticism, atheism, [[rationalism]] and [[humanism]].  The title is a pun on Hrab's first name and his interest in rationalism; the podcast contains "not a hint of geology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Geologic Podcast: George Hrab and the Geologic Universe | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com | publisher=Geologic Podcast | accessdate=April 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New episodes of the program are posted on Thursday or Friday.

The podcast content varies from week to week, but often includes several of a number of recurring segments. Some are Hrab speaking on a particular topic or relating a story, others are comedy sketches in which Hrab plays characters.  Occasionally the podcast will take the form of a concert, with Hrab singing and playing guitar.&lt;ref name="podcast60"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_60 | title=Episode #60 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=April 3, 2008 | accessdate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="podcast169"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_169 | title=Episode #169 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=June 8, 2010 | accessdate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In one such example, Hrab celebrated his 44th birthday by covering [[Yes (band)|Yes]]' album ''[[90125]]'' in its entirety.&lt;ref name="tampa90125"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spears|first1=Steve|title=George Hrab covers Yes' 90125 album|url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/80s/george-hrab-covers-yes-90125-album/2235593|website=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=1 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hrab has also conducted interviews with musicians such as [[Slau]]&lt;ref name="podcast133"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_133 | title=Episode #133 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=September 24, 2009 | accessdate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Milton Mermikides,&lt;ref name="podcast153"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_153 | title=Episode #153 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=February 18, 2010 | accessdate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as others.&lt;ref name="podcast76"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_76 | title=Episode #76 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=July 31, 2008 | accessdate=June 12, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2017 Hrab celebrated 10 years of the podcast with an eight-hour 500th episode which was broadcast as video on [[Facebook Live]]. The broadcast featured interviews with [[Steven Novella]], [[Phil Plait]] and [[Paul Provenza]], among others.&lt;ref name="mc500"&gt;{{cite news|title=500th episode on Saturday: Geologic Podcast by Bethlehem's George Hrab |author=Howell, Dave |date=February 23, 2017 |newspaper=[[The Morning Call]] |url=http://www.mcall.com/entertainment/music/mc-george-hrab-geologic-podcast-500-20170223-story.html |access-date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="underground"&gt;{{cite web|title=20 Years of Diligence: A Conversation with George Hrab | author=Longo, Gerard | date=February 23, 2017 | work=Lehigh Valley Underground | url=https://lehighvalleyunderground.com/2017/02/23/20-years-of-diligence-a-conversation-with-george-hrab/ |access-date=March 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
After the release of ''[sic]'', Hrab's self-published first album, he was sued for invasion of privacy by a former supervisor from his job at [[Moravian College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Song Defames Her, Moravian College Staffer Says * An Assistant Dean Sues Lyricist, Asking Damages And End To Sale of Cd Cut.|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1998-01-23/news/3189541_1_sour-note-discs-clark-s-attorney|work=The Morning Call|accessdate=December 14, 2012|author=LAURI RICE-MAUE|date=January 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claimed that a short phrase written in [[Cyrillic]] script in the liner notes as well as one short track on the album were intended as a disparaging remark directed at her, which embarrassed her in front of her coworkers. Hrab denied the charges and the case went to trial in January 1999. Hrab lost the case and had to pay a small amount of damages, and the album was removed from distribution.

Later, Hrab documented the entire affair (including re-enacting all of the testimony at trial) on his podcast.&lt;ref name="podcast42"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_42 | title=Episode #42 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=November 28, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="podcast43"&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.geologicpodcast.com/the_geologic_podcast_episode_43 | title=Episode #43 | work=The Geologic Podcast | author=Hrab, George | date=December 5, 2007 | accessdate=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the album was re-released with the offending material removed.

{{nihongo|'''''Gradius ReBirth'''''|グラディウス ReBirth|''Guradiusu Ribāsu''}} is a [[shoot 'em up]] [[video game]] for [[WiiWare]] developed by [[M2 (game developer)|M2]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtwo.co.jp/|title=有限会社エムツー |website=Mtwo.co.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Konami]]. It is the latest installment in the [[Gradius]] series, and was released in Japan on September 2, 2008,&lt;ref name=www&gt;{{cite news|last=McFerran|first=Damien|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/08/gradius_rebirth_hitting_japan_next_week|title=Gradius ReBirth Hitting Japan Next Week|website=[[Nintendo Life]]|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in North America on March 9, 2009, and in the PAL regions on July 3, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McFerran|first=Damien|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2009/03/usa_wiiware_update_gradius_rebirth|title=USA WiiWare Update: Gradius Rebirth|website=Nintendo Life|date=2009-03-09|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''Gradius ReBirth'' is a side-scrolling 2D shooter much like previous ''Gradius'' games, and has been described as a "remix" of levels from past games rather than an entirely new game. The game features two modes: a standard game with unlimited credits and a Score Attack mode where players are only given a single credit to beat the game. Score Attack also supports online leaderboards.&lt;ref name=impressions&gt;{{cite news|last=Bazin|first=Robert|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2008/09/first_impressions_gradius_rebirth|title=First Impressions: Gradius Rebirth|website=Nintendo Life|date=2008-09-03|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features five different types of ships to choose from, and five stages in total, with each (except the first stage) having its own original [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end.

==Plot==
This game takes place in the Gradian Year 6664, two years before "The Silent Nightmare Incident". The planet Antichthon, a protectorate of the Gradian Empire, suddenly and mysteriously falls silent. A report was made by the Director General of the Space Science Agency, Dr. Venom, which mentions that Antichthon's mother computer was now under the control of the Bacterians.

Realizing that a threat from the Bacterians may be imminent, the Gradian Government deploys its Gradian forces to combat the threat. Among them is Special Colonel James Burton, who had defeated the Bacterians a few years ago. Armed with an A.I. program called Gaudie, James Burton sets out in the hyperspace fighter known as the Vic Viper, in the hopes that he can combat the new Bacterian threat. But little does James know that there's much more in store for him...

==Development==
''Gradius ReBirth'' uses the ''Nemesis'' titles for the [[MSX]] as its basis. The power meter and text display have also been updated. The music was composed by [[Manabu Namiki]] and consists of remixed music from previous ''Gradius'' games.

An update to the game was released on the Wii Shop Channel for free of charge. It improves some of the visuals and adds a new ranking board for the adjustments made to the score system. In addition to this, there are new music tracks and a few changes to the game's levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konami.jp/products/dl_wii_gradius_re_ww/index.html|title=GRADIUS ReBirth|website=Konami.jp|date=2014-03-26|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Gradius ReBirth'' garnered positive reviews. [[IGN]] gave the game 7/10, praising the nostalgic retro design but finding the game to be punishingly hard for most players and the lack of multiplayer disappointing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daemon|last=Hatfield|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/10/gradius-rebirth-review|title=Gradius ReBirth Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|date=2009-03-09|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite also praising the retro visuals and soundtrack, NintendoLife gave ''Gradius ReBirth'' 6/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2009/03/gradius_rebirth|title=Gradius ReBirth Review|last=Dillard|first=Corbie|website=Nintendo Life|date=2009-03-10|accessdate=2018-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''#HappyHolograms'''" is the tenth and final episode in the [[South Park (season 18)|eighteenth season]] of the American animated television series ''[[South Park]]''.  The 257th episode overall, it was written and directed by series co-creator and co-star [[Trey Parker]]. The episode premiered on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on December 10 2014. It is the second part of the two-part season finale which began with the previous episode, "[[Rehash (South Park)|#REHASH]]". The episode makes multiple references to earlier episodes over the season, as well as to previous seasons, while mainly lampooning the trend of culture constantly making [[Twitter#Trending topics|trending topics]] with no actual relevance. It also lampoons news events such as the [[death of Eric Garner]], the [[shooting of Michael Brown]], the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby]], and the use of celebrity holograms. [[YouTube]] celebrity [[PewDiePie]] appeared as himself, continuing his story line from the previous episode.

==Plot==
Continuing from the previous episode, "Rehash", [[Kyle Broflovski]] laments how his younger brother [[Ike Broflovski|Ike]]'s generation's preoccupation with [[Twitter#Trending topics|trending topics]] and [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] videos has led him to be seen as an out-of-touch "grandpa" by younger kids. Kyle sends out a Twitter message to help families come together. In response, [[Bill Cosby]] appears at Kyle's home to invite him to participate in a television special to be watched by families together. Kyle agrees, but after Cosby leaves, he is revealed to be a hologram.

[[Randy and Sharon Marsh]] go to the police to report about the hologram of Randy created by his ex-manager to replace his stage persona [[Lorde]], but the police are skeptical. Meanwhile, a patrolman brings in the rogue [[Michael Jackson]] hologram, but despite the fact that the patrolman says he [[Shooting of Michael Brown|shot the hologram]] and used a [[Death of Eric Garner|chokehold]] on him, the hologram's light skin and features present a problem for the police, as they can only use such harsh tactics on black people.

The television special will feature various celebrities, holograms of deceased celebrities, and LP commentary by [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]]. The special is the brainchild of Randy's ex-producer and Cartman. The producer's staff, however, feel he has given too much power to Cartman, whose growing popularity results in his commentary window appearing not only on computers and other devices, but in thin air throughout the episode. Upon seeing a TV commercial for the special, Kyle is angered that his idea has been turned into a [[social media]] project, while his best friend, [[Stan Marsh]], is upset because he thinks his father, Randy, is performing again as Lorde.

Randy and the Jackson hologram learn about the television special and its intent, and agree to work together to stop it. When the [[Tupac Shakur]] hologram sent to capture the Jackson hologram appears at the police station, Randy and the Jackson hologram flee to the Marsh home. Randy then learns that Stan and Kyle have been taken hostage by his ex-producer, and is confronted by the Shakur hologram in his home.

When Kyle asks the producer why he is doing this, the producer explains that when he became a grandfather, one day he asked his grandson who his favorite celebrity was, and his grandson said it was [[PewDiePie]]. Bewildered that his grandson worshiped an insignificant Internet personality, and was unimpressed with anyone to whom he tried to introduce him, the producer says that with the television special, he will assimilate the younger generation's culture into his own. Stan is astonished that the producer is "such a grandpa".

The Shakur hologram and the Jackson hologram decide to team up against the producer. When Cartman's window appears before the producer, he tries to have him shut down, but Cartman is trending so much and has grown so powerful that he has reached "trend-scendence", "[[Transcendence (2014 film)|like Johnny Depp]], but cool".  As Cartman continues to appear on screens all around the world, he states that he is now "trends-gender" and therefore must be given his own bathroom, which was his motivation for being involved in this plan. The Shakur and Jackson holograms appear at the restaurant where the producer is hiding with the hostages. As Jackson fatally shoots the producer, Kyle, realizing that everyone on the planet can see everyone else on their computers, speaks out to his brother, Ike, apologizing for being a "grandpa". He accepts that Ike will develop his own generational interests, and admits that he was merely sore that Ike was a fan of Cartman in particular. He says that he just wants to be a family again. Ike and his friends resolve to get the public to "believe" again, and create a new trend which Kyle, breaking the [[fourth wall]], urges the home audience to spread. In response, PewDiePie's window appears, and his commentary is so powerful that Cartman's window is eliminated.

In an epilogue, Kyle says he managed to get their family to use the living room again for one hour each night, though Stan is still confused over the events that have just concluded. Kyle suggests that perhaps they are not going to understand it, and further says that at least [[YouTube]] celebrities are authentic, and have not been marketed to the public by corporations. PewDiePie's window then appears, and he thanks ''South Park'' for being on ''his'' show.

==Production==
The episode contains numerous references to previous episodes in the series, mostly in connection to Randy Marsh's double life as Lorde. Customer service employee "Steve" returns from "[[Grounded Vindaloop]]", as does the [[Washington Redskins]] logo from "[[Go Fund Yourself]]", while Cartman's desire for his own bathroom is from "[[The Cissy]]".&lt;ref name="IGN review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nicholson|first1=Max|title=South Park: '#HappyHolograms' Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/11/south-park-happyholograms-review|website=[[IGN]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014|date=December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the DVD audio commentary, [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], in hindsight, thought the story would have been better off split up into three episodes and not two, mainly because there was a lot of content left that they wanted to use but not enough time. The original plan was to make the story three episodes long but they settled for two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial|title= [[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode=[[Rehash (South Park)|#REHASH]]|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial|title= [[South Park (season 18)|South Park: Season 18]]|episode=#HappyHolograms|series=[[South Park]]|last=Parker|first=Trey|authorlink=Trey Parker|last2=Stone|first2=Matt|authorlink2=Matt Stone|network=[[Comedy Central]]|airdate=September 24 – December 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode makes numerous references to the deaths of [[death of Eric Garner|Eric Garner]] and [[shooting of Michael Brown|Michael Brown]], as well as the [[Bill Cosby sexual assault allegations|sexual assault allegations against Bill Cosby]].&lt;ref name="Den of Geek Review"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Longo|first1=Matt|title=South Park: #HolidayHolograms Review|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/tv/south-park/242045/south-park-holidayholograms-review|website=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The episode received a B rating from ''[[The A.V. Club]]''{{'}}s Dan Caffrey, though he stated that "It was rushed, it was messy, and it may have been just a bit too much story for ''South Park'', even for a two-parter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Caffrey|first1=Dan|title=Review: South Park: '#HappyHolograms'|url=http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/south-park-happyholograms-212874|website=[[The A.V. Club]]|accessdate=December 11, 2014|date=December 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Max Nicholson of [[IGN]] gave it a 6.8 out of 10, and stated "the climax of the entire episode (and arguably the season)...didn't tie everything together in the way that it could (and should) have."&lt;ref name="IGN review" /&gt;

Chris Longo from [[Den of Geek]] gave the episode 4 out of 5 stars, stating the episode "was incoherent, hilarious madness—its own artform." Longo's article also noted that, in [[real life]], the topic #IHateCartmanBrah became the top trending topic worldwide on Twitter.&lt;ref name="Den of Geek Review" /&gt;

A '''hard disk recorder''' ('''HDR''') is a system that uses a high-capacity [[hard disk]] to record [[digital audio]] or [[digital video]].  Hard disk recording systems represent an alternative to [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]] and [[video tape recorder]]s, and provide editing capabilities unavailable to tape recorders.  Audio HDR systems, which can be standalone or computer-based, typically include provisions for digital mixing and processing of the audio signal.

'''Direct-to-disk recording''' ('''DDR''') refers to methods which may also use [[optical disc recording technologies]] such as [[DVD]], and [[Compact disc]].

==History==
Prior to the 1980s, most [[recording studio]]s used [[Analog recording|analog]] [[multitrack recorder]]s, typically based on [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel tape]]. The first commercial hard disk recording system was the Sample-to-Disk 16-bit, 50&amp;nbsp;kHz [[digital recording]] option for the [[New England Digital]] [[Synclavier II]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.500sound.com/synclavierhistory.html |title=Synclavier early history |access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high cost and limited capacity of these solutions limited their use to large [[professional audio]] recording studios, and even then, they were usually reserved for specific applications such as [[film]] [[post-production]]. [[Stereo]] audio was not immediately available due to data input and output limitations on hard drives of that time.

With the arrival of the [[compact disc]] in 1982, digital recording became a major area of development by equipment makers.  Several affordable solutions were released during the late 1980s and early 90s; many of these continued to use tape, either in reels, or in more manageable [[videocassette]]s.  In 1993, iZ Technology Corporation developed [[RADAR (audio recorder)|RADAR]] (Random Access Digital Audio Recorder distributed by [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]]), designed to replace 24-track tape machines.  By the mid-1990s, with the steady decline of hard disk prices and the corresponding increases in capacity and portability, the cost of hard disk recording systems had dropped to the point where they became affordable for even smaller studios.  Hard disk systems have since become the preferred method for studio recording.

On January 14, 2004, Engineers from Fairlight, [[WaveFrame]] and [[AMS (Advanced Music Systems)|AMS]] were awarded [[Academy Scientific and Technical Award]]s for the development of hard disk recording technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oscars.org/sci-tech/ceremonies/2004 |title=The 76th Scientific &amp; Technical Awards 2003, 2004 |publisher=The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
One major advantage of recording audio to a [[hard disk]] is that it allows for [[non-linear editing]].  Audio data can be [[random access|accessed randomly]] and therefore can be [[Non-destructive editing|edited non-destructively]], that is, the original material is not changed in any way. Non-linear editing is not inherent to every hard-disk recording system, however.  Different manufacturers implement different degrees of this facility.

Hard disk recorders are often combined with a digital [[mixing console]] and are an integral part of a [[digital audio workstation]] (DAW).  In this form, complex tasks can be automated, freeing the [[audio engineer]] from [[Performance|performing]] a final mix in real time.

A [[personal computer]] can be used as a hard disk recorder with appropriate [[software]]; nowadays this solution is often preferred, as it provides a more flexible interface to the studio engineer.  Many studio-grade systems provide external hardware, particularly for the [[Analog to digital converter|analog to digital conversion]] stages, while less expensive software systems can use the [[sound card]] included with any modern computer.

The major constraints on any hard disk recording system are the [[Computer data storage|storage capacity]], [[transfer rate]], and processor speed.  Some systems use [[lossy audio compression]] to minimize the first two factors.  This solution is becoming increasingly rare, thanks to rapid increases in hard disk capacity.

==Products==
Stand-alone hard disk recorders are able to record audio or video without requiring a computer. Examples of notable stand-alone hard disk recorders and manufacturers include [[Alesis]], [[Akai]], [[Fostex]], [[Korg]], [[Mackie]], [[TASCAM]], [[Roland Corporation]], [[Yamaha Pro Audio]], [[RADAR (audio recorder)|RADAR]] and [[Zoom HD8 and HD16]].

[[Miniaturization]] of recording and storage technology for consumer video already allows the non-professional user to directly record [[home movies]] to a permanent storage medium like [[DVD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

DDRs have replaced [[Magnetic tape]] based [[DV]], [[Digital8]], [[8mm Video Format]], [[VHS]] and [[MicroMV]] [[video tape]] recorders.

Professional [[television studio]] DDRs [[video server]]s are being used to replace [[video tape recorder]]s ([[VTR]])s and VTR Cart machines, that [[playout]] [[television commercials]] and [[TV shows]].  [[Digital audio workstation]]s (DAW) are used in [[professional audio]] [[recording studio]]s. Computer software can implement a hard disk recorder function.

==Applications==
Consumer applications include [[camcorder]]s to high-end [[tapeless camcorder]]s, [[digital video recorder]] (DVR) and [[set top box]] models like [[TiVo]] and [[personal computer]] based recorders. More professional applications include [[non-linear editing]] (NLE) systems like [[Avid Technology]] [[video editing]] systems, recording [[television production]]s/[[filmmaking]] in the field with [[professional video camera]]s in [[digital cinematography]] for [[digital cinema]] productions. Hard disk recorders are used in professional [[television studio]] from small systems able to record 2 hours to large multi port [[playout]] systems supporting hundreds of hours of material.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2744">'''Hypsos''' is a [[Greek people|Greek]] [[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept comparable to the modern concept of the [[Sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], or a moment that brings oral [[speech]] to an astonishing and monumental pause.  Its [[Word root|root]] ''hypso-'' literally means "aloft", "height", or "on high". However, a distinguishing feature of hypsos in [[rhetoric]]al studies is that it “combines conflicting [[emotion]]s: fear and [[awe]], [[wikt:Special:Search/horror|horror]] and fascinations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;” It is a [[Climax (rhetoric)|climactic]] moment in speech that generates uncertainty for the audience.

==Longinus and hypsos==
The ancient Greek rhetoric teacher [[Longinus (literature)|Longinus]] introduced the concept of hypsos in the only significant piece of literature that he is known for having written during his lifetime, ''[[On the Sublime#The Treatise On the Sublime|On the Sublime]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Longinus|first=Cassius|title=Longinus On the Sublime|year=1867|publisher=T. &amp; G. Shrimpton|location=The University of Michigan|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. In his work, Longinus prompted the possibilities and freedom that [[speech]] could possess by presenting hypsos. Longinus’ theories and concepts differed greatly from other Greek rhetoricians and [[philosopher]]s, and challenged the traditional rigid structure of rhetorical practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=O'Gorman|first=Ned|title=Longinus's Sublime Rhetoric, or How Rhetoric Game into Its Own|journal=Rhetoric Society Quarterly|year=2004|issue=34.2|pages=71–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term effects of hypsos==
Hypsos is studied by present-day [[rhetorician]]s, and is often referred to through the publication of ''Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus: [[On the Sublime|Peri Hupsous]] in Rhetoric, the [[Visual Arts]], Architecture, and the Theatre''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Eck|first=Caroline van|title=Translations of the Sublime: The Early Modern Reception and Dissemination of Longinus' Peri Hupsous in Rhetoric, the Visual Arts, Architecture and the Theatre|year=2012|publisher=BRILL|pages=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a collection of volumes of Longinus’ [[essay]]s. It stands as one of few pieces that explore the ways in which hypsos (which Longinus refers to as “the sublime in one single thought”) is used not only in rhetoric and literature, but also in the visual arts, architecture, and theater.

'''Illustrated Tarock''' ({{lang-de|Illustriertes Tarock}}) or '''Illustrated Dreiertarock'''&lt;ref name=M&amp;S&gt;Mayr and Sedlaczek (2016), pp. 368-370&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[card game]] for three players from the Austrian branch of the [[Tarock]] family. It was thought by Mayr and Sedlaczek to be extinct but, in 2009, when the two Tarock authors were guests on an [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]] radio programme, players from Vienna called in who confirmed they still played the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100313134400/http://www.wienerzeitung.at/DesktopDefault.aspx?TabID=4392&amp;Alias=spiele&amp;cob=395911 ''Illustriertes Tarock 1: Ein interessantes und herausforderndes Spiel zu Dritt''] by Wolfgang Mayr &amp; Robert Sedlaczek in ''[[Wiener Zeitung]]'', 7 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes called [[Point Tarock]]&lt;ref name=Dummett&gt;Dummett, ''Twelve Tarot Games'', pp. 131-146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bamberger&gt;Bamberger (1983), pp. 43-48&lt;/ref&gt; which, however, is a different game, albeit a close cousin. Although it has "a reputation for being a little more convoluted than the others", Furr, who calls it Point Tarock, maintains that this is not so.&lt;ref name=Tarocchi&gt;Furr (2009), p. 133-138.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he recommends that players become familiar with [[Tapp Tarock]] before attempting this game.&lt;ref name=Tarocchi/&gt;

== Name ==
There is no consensus over the meaning of the name. The Tarock game described here is occasionally called ''Point Tarock'',&lt;ref name="alscher"&gt;Alscher (2003), p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt; or it is given both names.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr and Sedlaczek (2001), pp. 111–114.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Point Tarock]] is actually a different form of game,&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1972), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; which also appears under the name ''Illustriertes Tarock''.&lt;ref name="alscher" /&gt;

== General rules ==
As in other Tarock games there are no official rules. Instead the rules vary from game to game and publication to publication. The rules given here follow those of Fritz Beck.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1972), pp. 69–93&lt;/ref&gt; These instructions also offer occasional variations. In places, other variants from a set of rules used in [[Graz]] are mentioned; they are indicated in the test with (G).&lt;ref&gt;Spielweise Grazer Tarockrunden&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cards ===
Like other Tarock games in Austria and other lands of the former [[Habsburg Empire]], Illustrated Tarock uses a 54-card deck of the type described in the article on [[Königrufen]]. This deck contains 22 tarocks as trumps (I – XXI + Sküs) and 32 suit cards in the four French suits of [[Hearts (card suit)|Hearts]], [[Diamonds (card suit)|Diamonds]], [[Spades (card suit)|Spades]] and [[Clubs (card suit)|Clubs]].

=== Card values ===
The game uses the same values as other Austrian tarock games like [[Königrufen]].

5 Points – Kings, I, XXI, Sküs; 4 Points – Queens; 3 Points – Cavaliers; 2 Points – Valets; 1 Point – remaining tarocks and pip cards

=== Counting ===
Counting is carried out in groups of 3 cards. From the points in each group, 2 are deducted e.g. King + Cavalier + X = 9 points, minus 2 points gives 7 points. If fewer than 3 cards remain, 2/3 points are deducted from the total. 1/3 or 2/3 points are rounded up or down at the end to the nearest whole number.

=== Trick-taking rules ===
Higher suit cards beat lower ones of the same suit; tarocks beat suit cards and lower tarocks. Players must follow suit (''Farbzwang'') but do not have to win the trick (no ''Stichzwang''). If the lead suit cannot be followed, a tarock card must be played.

=== Shuffling and dealing ===
As in most Tarock games, play proceeds anti-clockwise.

A player is nominated as the dealer by lots; in one variant (G), a recorder (''Schreiber'') is also chosen by lots. [[Rearhand]] deals; [[middlehand]] sitting to his left cuts or knocks.

Six cards are laid face down to for a [[talon (cards)|talon]]. The rest of the cards, even if they have been 'knocked', are dealt in four packets of four cards. In one variant (G), if the cards have been knocked, after the talon three packets of 16 cards are dealt. [[Forehand (card player)|Forehand]] and middlehand decide which packet to take up, the third is left for rearhand.

== Playing ==
=== Auction ===
During the auction (''Lizitation''), players look to see if there is a contract that they can bid for.

The value of the contract depends on the number of [[talon card]]s to be used. ''Dreiblatt'' is a contract using 3 of the talon cards, ''Zweiblatt'' uses two, ''Einblatt'' uses one and Solo none.

Forehand names a contract or says "pass" (''Weiter''), whereupon the right to bid passes to middlehand, etc.

A declared game may be confirmed by the next player as follows:
* "Good" (''Gut heißen'')
* "Unteren", i. e. they want to play this contract themselves (''das Spiel lösen'')
* Naming a higher value contract

Next, forehand decides, if necessary, whether to accept a declared "Unteren" or not ("hold the contract" – ''das Spiel halten''). The contract 'held' could then be outbid by rearhand declaring a higher value contract.

=== Procedure if no contracts bid ===
In this case (three "passes") there are three options for reaching an agreement:
# The dealer re-deals the cards.
# ''Trischaken''. Each player plays against the others and the one who scores the most points within the tricks, loses the game. In Trischaken, players must take the trick if they are able to (''Stichzwang''). Tarock I must be played as the last tarock in a player's hand. The talon is not used and no bonuses are awarded.
# (G) After three "passes" the hand cards are placed back on the table together. Rearhand picks up the talon without looking at it and may either put it back or keep up to six cards from it for the next game. At the start of the next game, the next dealer either deals rearhand no cards or correspondingly fewer cards. If cards are taken from the talon, rearhand is obliged to declare a contract no lower than ''Dreiblatt'' in the next game.

=== Next stage ===
After the [[Illustrated Tarock#Playing|auction]] and declaration of any [[Illustrated Tarock#Bonuses|bonuses]] have been made, the talon is uncovered (except in Trishaken and Solo) without changing the order of the cards. In a variant (G), however, bonuses are ''not'' declared before the talon is uncovered. Depending on the outcome of the auction, the player takes three, two or one card into his hand, whereby only adjacent cards may be selected. After evaluating the hand, a corresponding number of cards are dealt face down. These are counted at the end together with the cards in the player's tricks.

The soloist then declares ''"Ich liege"'' and makes any [[Illustrated Tarock#Scoring|bonus declarations]]. The defenders, in clockwise order, say "''good''" (''Gut'') or [[Illustrated Tarock#Kontras|''"Kontra"'']]. When the ''[[Kontra (cards)|Kontra]]'' process has finished, forehand leads to the first trick. Subsequently, the player who wins a trick leads to the next trick.

At the end of the game the card points gained are counted up. To win the contract at least 36 points (rounded up or down as need be) are required.

== Scoring ==
This describes how points are awarded for games won and the [[Illustrated Tarock#Scoring|multiplication factors]] depending on the number of cards drawn from the talon. See [[Illustrated Tarock#Bonuses|Bonuses]] for the settlement of bonus declarations and [[Illustrated Tarock#Valat|Valat]].

=== Game points and excess points ===
The following game points apply:
* ''Dreier'': 3 points
* ''Unteren'': 4 points
* ''Held'' game: 5 points

To these game points are added "excess points", i.e. the number of points above 35, the number needed to win. For example, a declared contract won with 40 points counts 3 + 5 = 8 points.

Trischaken scores as follows:
* Win: 5 points
* Lost: 10 point deduction
* Win with no tricks: 5 additional points

=== Multiplication factors ===
The scoring of contracts and bonuses depends in the number of cards taken from the talon, as follows:
* Dreiblatt: scores the basic game value
* Zweiblatt: scores double
* Einblatt: scores triple
* Solo: scores quadruple

So a contract of ''Zweiblatt'' won with 39 card points scores (3 + 4) × 2 = 16 game points.

In the literature slightly different scoring schemes may be found.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr and Sedlaczek (2001), p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bonuses ==
=== General ===
A number of bonuses (declarations) may be awarded in Illustrated Tarock. These are bonuses for certain card combinations, bonuses for points earned, bonuses for last trick declarations and bonuses for the Valat. There are several declaration options:
* ''Still'' (declared only when the game is finished and being scored): basic game value (for last trick declarations)
* After talon exchange, before the game starts: counts double for last trick declarations, basic  value for other bonuses
* Before talon exchange: scores quadruple for last trick declarations, scores double for other premiums

=== Bonuses and their scoring ===
The respective basic values for ''Still'' contracts are given.

==== Card combinations ====
Bonuses for card combinations do not depend on the outcome of the game, they are always awarded. Beck assigns the basic value when the declaration has been made after talon cards have been exchanged, at G only the basic value is assigned for a declaration after the game has ended
.
* Royal Trull (all four Kings in the hand): 5 points
* Tarock Trull (I, XXI, Sküs in the hand): 4 points
* Heads (two trull cards in the hand): 2 points

These bonuses can be won both by the soloist and by a defender. Here, too, Beck assigns the basic value when the declaration has been madke after talon cards have been exchanged, at G only the basic value is awarded for a declaration after the end of the game.

* Without Kings (no king in the hand): 5 points
* Without Trull (no trull cards in the hand): 4 points

These bonuses can only be earned by the soloist.

==== Card point bonuses ====
* "With Forty" ("Absolute") i.e. 40 card points scored: 5 points
* "With Fifty" ("Panzer"): i.e. 50 card points scored: 10 points

For these bonuses, too, Beck doubles the basic value doubled for declarations made after the talon exchange. G only awards a bonus for "With 50", 10 points, awarded at the end of the game.

==== Ultimo bonuses ====
* Pagat Ultimo, winning the last trick with Tarock I: 5 points (''Still'', declared after talon pick-up 10 pts., before talon pick-up, 20 pts.)
* Owl Pre-Ultimo, winning the penultimate trick with Tarock II: 5 points (as for Pagat Ultimo)

Ow Pre-Ultimo (''Uhu Pre-Ultimo'') is a variation that needs to be pre-agreed.

==== Mondfang bonus ====
Beck is silent about any ''Mondfang'' ("Moon capture") bonus. The Graz rules state:

If Tarock XXI is take by the Sküs, the winner of the Mond gets an extra 5 points and the player who lost the Mond has 5 points deducted.

=== Valat ===
Valat is when a player wins all the tricks in a game.

In this game of three, there is very rarely a distribution of cards that enables Valat to be achieved. The possibility of declaring Valat is even rarer.

==== Beck scoring ====
Valat is scored, according to Beck,&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1972), pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:
Variant A:
* Undeclared Valat (''Still''): 12 points
* Valat declared after talon pick-up: 24 points
* Valat declared before talon pick-up: 48 points

Values apply to Dreiblatt; in addition to other in-game points and bonuses.

Variant B:
The numbers 12/24/48 above are considered multiplying factors for the points scored in the game and for bonuses. Beck writes: "However, this method of calculation is controversial [...] and we do not necessarily recommend it either." &lt;ref&gt;Beck (1972), p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Graz scoring ====
In this variant, multiplication factors are used.
* Undeclared Valat (''Still''): 6 x basic value
* Valat (declared after talon pick-up): 12 x basic value

Multiplication basis: points for declared/'taken'/'held' contract; surplus points; bonuses for card combinations; bonuses for last trick declarations. The multiplication factors for ''Zweiblatt'' etc. are applied.

If Valat is not achieved, the game is won by the defenders with the points of the cards that were in play, i.e. 70 minus the remaining cards in the talon.

=== Kontra ===
Both contract and bonus declarations may be responded to with ''Kontra'' ("double!") and the first declarer may reply with ''Rekontra''.

==== Beck variant ====
Kontras may be declared before or after the talon pick-up, and always double the game points and bonuses.&lt;ref&gt;Beck (1972), pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Beck is silent as to whether Kontra is only valid for the defender who says it or whether it is also valid for his partner.

==== Graz variant ====
Kontras always take place after the player has said ''"Ich liege!"''. Game and bonus declarations are treated separately (if necessary only one of them). Kontra also applies to a defending partner.

=== Revoking ===
Revoking is a violation of the rules. If the soloist 'revokes', his game and bonus declarations are considered lost, the game is scored with ten surplus points, and they are awarded to the defenders. In the case of revoking by a defender, the game awarded to the soloist, he receives all points for game (including ten excess points) and bonuses credited.

== Notation ==
=== Basics ===
Illustrated Tarock is played in series. A series ends as soon as at least one player reaches 100 game points. Players who earn 100 points will receive 10 extra points. This does not happen if it was the result of a revoking.

For each player, the total points achieved after each game are recorded. It is quite possible that player A gets points for the game won, player B and C get points for a Pagat Ultimo that player A did not get through.

The notation is done line by line. Either each player can write down their own series or a player (the ''Schreiber'') is drawn by lot and records the results of all players.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8627">'''Incanti''' is a yearly theatre festival held in [[Turin|Torino]], Italy, since 1994. Amongst the main patrons are the [[Ministry of Cultural Heritage and Activities and Tourism (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Cultural Heritage]], the [[Piedmont|Piemonte Region]], the Municipality of Torino, and the foundations {{Interlanguage link multi|Compagnia di San Paolo Foundation|it|3=Compagnia di San Paolo|lt=Compagnia di San Paolo}} and [[Fondazione CRT]].
The festival was created in 1994 by the cultural association Controluce Teatro d’Ombre&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.controluce.org/ Controluce Teatro d'Ombre, in Italian-English-Spanish] ''controluce.org''&lt;/ref&gt; as an experiment hosted in the small theatre at the {{Interlanguage link multi|Museum of Contemporary Art Castello di Rivoli|it|3=Museo d'arte contemporanea del castello di Rivoli|lt=Castello di Rivoli museum of contemporary art}}; it bore the name ''Incanti, International Festival of Figure Theatre''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,44/articleid,0757_01_1994_0273_0054_10749065/ Article from Italian daily La Stampa of 6 October 1994 entitled “A shadow company to stage a dream”] ''archiviolastampa.it''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,24/articleid,0758_01_1994_0278_0024_10756967/ “Ample proof of such charming power has been given in the first festival of this theatrical genre held at the Castello di Rivoli’s small theatre,” quotation from Italian daily La Stampa of 11 October 1994, article entitled “Life hangs by a shadow: How lovely!”] ''archiviolastampa.it''&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from 2002, the press acknowledged how ''Incanti'', “from a refined niche festival, a precious gem for a selected audience, has converted to one among the most reputed {{Interlanguage link multi|Figure Theatre|it|3=Teatro di figura|lt=figure-theatre}} shows across Europe,” addressing mainly an adult audience and featuring a programme that includes both tradition and experimentation, where multi-media shows highlighting the links between performance, music, visual arts and poetry play a key role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archiviolastampa.it/component/option,com_lastampa/task,search/mod,libera/action,viewer/Itemid,3/page,55/articleid,0170_01_2003_0259_0055_1198008/ Article from Italian daily La Stampa of 21 September 2003 entitled “The shadows’ spell”] ''archiviolastampa.it''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giacomo Inaudi''' (13 October 1867&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnum.cnam.fr/CGI/fpage.cgi?4KY28.38/221/100/536/0/0 Cnum.cnam.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; – 10 November 1950), also known as '''Jacques Inaudi''' in [[France]], was an Italian [[calculating prodigy]].

He was born in [[Onorato]], [[Piedmont (Italy)|Piedmont, Italy]]. As a child he was a shepherd but showed aptitude for [[mental calculation]]. Inaudi's abilities attracted interest of showmen and he toured around the world.

French scientists like [[Jean-Martin Charcot]] investigated his abilities, French astronomer [[Camille Flammarion]] praised him in strong terms, and [[Alfred Binet]] wrote a book on him. Inaudi would repeat the numbers he was given before he began his mental calculations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nicholas, S.|author2=Gounden, Y.|author3=Levine, Z.|year=2011|title=The memory of two great mental calculators: Charcot and Binet’s neglected 1893 experiments|journal=American Journal of Psychology|volume=124|issue=2|pages=235–242|doi=10.5406/amerjpsyc.124.2.0235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inaudi was referred to by the Nobel-prize-winning immunologist, [[Élie Metchnikoff]] (Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov), in his book ''[https://archive.org/details/naturemanstudie00mitcgoog The Nature of Man: Studies in Optimistic Philosophy]'' (1905). Metchnikoff regarded Inaudi as an example of a mutation, in the sense announced by the Dutch botanist [[Hugo de Vries]] (''Die Mutationstheorie'', Vol. 1, Leipzig, 1901), i.e. a sudden leap to a distinct new type that might be regarded as a new species. Metchnikoff argued that this kind of abrupt leap in evolution might explain how humans had emerged from apes and that Inaudi was proof that such a mutation was possible.&lt;ref&gt;Metchnikoff, É., 1905.

==Biography==
Mander was born in [[the Bronx]], New York City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://history.sffs.org/media_assets/pdf/Jerry_Mander_Oral_History_Interview.pdf|title= Jerry Mander Oral History Interview|first= Lee|last= Amazonas|date= 2006-12-22|publisher= [[San Francisco Film Society]]|accessdate= 2010-11-22|quote= I was born in the Bronx.

&lt;/ref&gt; to Harry and Eva Mander,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |title= [[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]|last= Mander|first= Jerry|authorlink= Jerry Mander|year= 1978|origyear= First copyright 1977|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-688-08274-1|page= 5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
an immigrant Jewish couple who struggled to achieve success in America.  In his ''Four Arguments'' he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
My parents carried the immigrants' fears. Security was their primary value: all else was secondary. Both of them had escaped pogroms in Eastern Europe. My father's career had followed the path familiar to so many New York immigrants. Lower East Side. Scant schooling. Street hustling. Hard work at anything to keep life together. Early marriage. Struggling out of poverty.

Curiously, success came to him during the Depression. He founded what later became Harry Mander and Company, a small service business to the garment industry, manufacturing pipings, waist bands, pocketing and collar canvas.

One of the reasons for my father's success during hard times was World War II. He was beyond draft age and so was free to do a successful trade in servicing the manufacture of military uniforms. After the war, the business grew in new directions as the economy spurted forward into an era of rapid growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[Four Arguments for the Elimination of Television]]|last= Mander|first= Jerry|authorlink= Jerry Mander|year= 1978|origyear= First copyright 1977|publisher= [[HarperCollins]]|location= [[New York City|New York, New York]]|isbn= 978-0-688-08274-1|page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At an early age, Jerry Mander moved with his family from the Bronx to a semi-rural area of [[Yonkers, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jadecricket.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/scattered-disorganized-thoughts-about-technology/|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718101049/http://jadecricket.wordpress.com/2008/06/30/scattered-disorganized-thoughts-about-technology/|dead-url= yes|archive-date= 2011-07-18|title= Scattered (disorganized?) thoughts about technology|first= Quin Aaron|last= Shakra|date= 2008-06-30|publisher= [[WordPress.com]]|accessdate= 2010-11-24|quote= Having moved from the Bronx to Yonkers, New York, at an early age, Mander describes the destruction of wild nature and the arrival of apartment buildings and the New York Thruway.}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
He grew up there, and says: "I was a golf star throughout my youth and that was what I wanted to be, a professional golfer when I was very young."

&lt;/ref&gt;

After receiving his M.S., Mander worked in [[advertising]] for 15 years, including five as partner and president of Freeman, Mander &amp; Gossage in San Francisco. Mander worked with the noted [[environmentalism|environmentalist]], [[David Brower]], managing the [[Sierra Club]]'s advertising campaigns to prevent the construction of dams in the [[Grand Canyon]], to establish [[Redwood National Park]], and to stop the U.S. [[Supersonic transport|Supersonic Transport]] (SST) project. In 1971 he founded the first non-profit [[advertising agency]] in the United States, Public Interest Communications.

Mander served as the executive director of the [[International Forum on Globalization]], which he founded in 1994, until 2009 and continues on its staff as a Distinguished Fellow.  He is also the program director for Megatechnology and Globalization at the [[Foundation for Deep Ecology]].

In 2007 Jerry Mander appeared in the full-length documentary film, ''[[What a Way to Go: Life at the End of Empire]]''.

In an interview with Nancho.net's W. David Kubiak,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |title=Nancho Consults Jerry Mander |author=W. David Kubiak |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120908003052/http://www.nancho.net/advisors/mander.html |archivedate=2012-09-08 |accessdate=2010-11-09 |quote=I became involved using those techniques to help, you know, environmental groups and anti-war groups and civil rights groups, using advertising as a technique to help them. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Mander describes how he got into advertising and how he turned it to the service of social causes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Well, I wasn't a rebel when I got into advertising. I became a rebel through advertising. It was by being in advertising and realizing what advertising does in the system. I mean I can't explain why I, unlike other advertising men, saw that as a big problem. But I became involved using those techniques to help, you know, environmental groups and anti-war groups and civil rights groups, using advertising as a technique to help them. Advertising and also public relations work. So using that medium is what awoke me in many ways to the power of the medium and the power to use it in the reverse, against the system as well. Although the main problem is that those who are in power have so much more power and more money than those who are trying to resist it. And so we're always up against a heavy ratio, and the fact the opposite side has more power than we do.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1965, Mander married feminist author Anica Vesel Mander (b. 1934, d. 2002-06-19). They had two sons, Kai Maxim Mander and Yari David Mander. Although the Manders divorced in 1982, they remained close friends for the rest of Anica's life. Jerry Mander has lived in [[Bolinas, California]] since 1977.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Joged''' is a style of [[dance]] from the Island of [[Bali]]. The term ''Joged'' or ''Joget'' is also a common word for [[dance]] in [[Indonesia]]. The dance is typically accompanied by a [[gamelan]] ensemble of bamboo instruments called a [[gamelan joged bumbung]]. [[Balinese dance|Balinese]] Joged dance is not a religious and ritual one, it is social dance for entertainment purposes only. During a Joged performance, a single or several female dancers will perform and invited male audience to dance with them. The dance often involving erotic movements and teasing, ranged from humorous to seducement interactions between the dancers with their male counterpart. The dance is quite comparable with other [[Indonesian dance]] traditions; such as those of [[Javanese dance|Javanese]] [[Ronggeng]] and [[Sundanese dance|Sundanese]] [[Jaipongan]].

The organization has stated that the policy is a national identity issue, not a religious issue.

[[File:Baraque.JPG|thumb|A table for ''Le Multicolore'']]
'''Le multicolore''' is a [[game of chance]] from [[France]] and [[Catalonia]] that features characteristics of both [[roulette]] and [[bagatelle]]. In the game, a ball is rolled into a basin-shaped wheel, which is divided into twenty-five shallow cups. Each cup is assigned one of five colours, with a value ascribed. The game consists in predicting on which colour the ball will rest.

The game is played at several ''cercles de jeu''{{clarify|date=October 2011|reason=What is that supposed to mean? This is the English-language Wikipedia. And this term doesn't exist at the French one: [[:fr:Cercle_de_jeu]] = REDLINK.}} in [[France]], where conventional roulette is not allowed.

==Description and rules==
The game is composed of a large [[Billiard table|gaming table]] provided with a circular disc on one of its extremes. This wheel has twenty-five identical cups of five different colours: six red, six green, six yellow, six white and one blue. Of the six cups of identical colour one is numbered 4, three 3 and the last two 2, while the blue cup is numbered 24. The wheel may spin, or be statical.

Surrounding the table there is a layout divided and painted with these five colours, where the players can place their wagers.

To determine the winning colour, a croupier strikes, with a cue stick, an ivory ball into a rail, then the ball runs along the cloth, goes up a ramp and enters the circumference of the wheel. The ball eventually falls into one of 25 cups on the wheel.
The odds paid on the winning colour are 2, 3, 4 or 24 to 1, depending on the cup where the ball has fallen.

'''Lieder line by line''' (subtitled '''Lieder line by line and word for word''') is a book by [[Lois Phillips]], a professor of song at the [[Royal Academy of Music]].  The book gives the full texts of most of the important lieder by [[Beethoven]], [[Schubert]], [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]], [[Wagner]], [[Brahms]], [[Hugo Wolf|Wolf]], [[Mahler]] and [[Strauss]]. Under each line of the original German is a literal word-by-word translation, while alongside is a prose transliteration of the verse. Phillips thus combines two of the common strategies used in song translation.&lt;ref&gt;Translating poetic songs: An attempt at a functional account of strategies, Low P, Target, Volume 15, Number 1, 2003 , pp. 91-110(20), Publisher: John Benjamins Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

First published in 1979 and updated in 1996, it is considered indispensable by many Anglophone students of [[lieder]]. It is cited in the bibliography of the ''[[Harvard Dictionary of Music]]'' article on the lied form, and it is a frequently cited source of English translations of the popular German lieder and has been endorsed by such authorities as [[Dame Janet Baker]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8054">[[Game theory]] studies strategic interaction between individuals in situations called games.  Classes of these games have been given names.  This is a list of the most commonly studied games

==Explanation of features==

Games can have several features, a few of the most common are listed here.
*'''Number of players''':  Each person who makes a choice in a game or who receives a payoff from the outcome of those choices is a player.
*'''Strategies per player''':  In a game each player chooses from a set of possible actions, known as pure strategies.  If the number is the same for all players, it is listed here.
*'''Number of [[pure strategy]] [[Nash equilibria]]''': A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies which represents mutual [[best response]]s to the other strategies.  In other words, if every player is playing their part of a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to unilaterally change his or her strategy.  Considering only situations where players play a single strategy without randomizing (a pure strategy) a game can have any number of Nash equilibria.
*'''[[Sequential game]]''': A game is sequential if one player performs her/his actions after another player; otherwise, the game is a [[simultaneous game|simultaneous move game]].
*'''[[Perfect information]]''': A game has perfect information if it is a sequential game and every player knows the strategies chosen by the players who preceded them.
*'''[[Constant sum]]''': A game is constant sum if the sum of the payoffs to every player are the same for every single set of strategies.  In these games one player gains if and only if another player loses. A constant sum game can be converted into a '''[[zero sum]] game''' by subtracting a fixed value from all payoffs, leaving their relative order unchanged.

The term "nursery rhyme" emerged in the third decade of the nineteenth century although this type of children's literature previously existed with different names such as ''Tommy Thumb Songs'' and ''Mother Goose Songs''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Twinkle, Twinkle, Southern Cross: The Forgotten Folklore of Australian Nursery Rhymes|last=Holden|first=Robert|publisher=National Library Australia|year=1992|isbn=064210560X|location=Canberra|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first known book containing a collection of these texts was ''[[Tommy Thumb's Pretty Song Book]]'', which was written by M. Cooper and was published in 1744.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Uncle John's Endlessly Engrossing Bathroom Reader|last=Bathroom Readers' Institute|first=|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2011|isbn=9781607104599|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works of several scholars and collectors helped document and preserve these [[Oral tradition|oral traditions]] as well as their histories. These include [[Iona and Peter Opie]], [[Joseph Ritson]], [[James Halliwell-Phillipps|James Orchard Halliwell]], and [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Garden to the Street: Three Hundred Years of Poetry for Children|last=Styles|first=Morag|publisher=Cassell|year=1997|isbn=0304332240|location=London|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice''''' is a blank verse tragedy in five acts by [[Lord Byron]], published and first performed in 1821.

== Synopsis ==

The play is set in [[Venice]] in 1355. [[Marino Faliero]], recently elected [[Doge of Venice]], offends one of the chief officers of state, Michel Steno. Steno retaliates by writing on the Doge's throne an indecent libel on Faliero's wife. For this he is tried by the [[Council of the Forty|Council of Forty]] and convicted, but is only sentenced to a month's imprisonment. Faliero is so outraged by this, as he believes, inadequate punishment that he secretly joins in the conspiracy of a group of malcontents to overthrow the constitution of Venice, thinking thereby to gain revenge on his enemies. The plot is discovered and Faliero is executed.

== Composition and publication ==

Byron was inspired to take on this subject when, on examining the portraits of the Doges in the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Palazzo Ducale]] in Venice, he discovered that the portrait of Faliero had been blacked out.{{sfn|Plant|2002|p=91}} The main historical source he drew on was [[Marino Sanuto the Younger|Marino Sanuto]]'s ''Vite dei Doge'' (published posthumously 1733).{{sfn|Marchand|1977|p=131}}{{sfn|Marchand|1978|p=161}} He completed the play in July 1820, by which time he was living in [[Ravenna]], and published it in April 1821, along with his ''The Prophecy of Dante''.{{sfn|Quennell|1990|p=596}}{{sfn|Marchand|1978|pp=66–69}} He intended to dedicate it to [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], but delays in the post between Italy and England resulted in the play being published without a dedication.{{sfn|Marchand|1977|p=206}} The posthumous 1832 edition of Byron's collected works included a later dedication of the play by Byron to his friend [[Douglas Kinnaird]].{{sfn|Marchand|1978|p=195}} ''Marino Faliero'' was translated into French in 1830 and into Italian in 1838.{{sfn|Plant|2002|p=91}}

== First performance ==

Byron intended his play to be read rather than acted, and when he heard that the actor-manager [[Robert William Elliston]] intended to stage it he caused his publisher, [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]], to obtain an injunction to prevent him. Elliston nevertheless performed it, in a version cut almost by half, at [[Drury Lane]] four days after the play was published. The reaction from both audiences and critics was lukewarm; perhaps, as Byron thought, because of the play's [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] form and lack of sensationalism and love interest.{{sfn|Quennell|1990|p=653}}{{sfn|Smith|2005|pp=139–41}}{{sfn|Marchand|1978|p=66}}

The subject of [[Eugène Delacroix]]' painting ''The Execution of the Doge Marino Faliero'' (1825–26), now in the [[Wallace Collection]] in London, was suggested by Byron's play.{{sfn|Duffy|2004|p=240}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T021888?q=byron+faliero+delacroix&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=1&amp;_start=1#firsthit |title=Delacroix, (Ferdinand-)Eugène(-Victor) |author=Harrison, Colin |work=Grove Art Online |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tragedy by [[Casimir Delavigne]] on the same subject is believed to have drawn on Byron, as well as on a story by [[E.

Hoffmann]], and Delavigne's play itself inspired [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s opera ''[[Marino Faliero (opera)|Marino Faliero]]''.{{sfn|Plant|2002|p=91}} [[Algernon Charles Swinburne|Swinburne]] was impelled to write his own ''Marino Faliero'' by what he considered shortcomings in Byron's play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/223/0510.html |title=The Rossettis, William Morris, Swinburne, and Others.  § 10.

[[File:M. B. Leavitt portrait.jpeg|thumb|right|Michael B. Leavitt]]

'''Michael B. Leavitt''' (1843–1935) was an American theater entrepreneur, [[theatre manager|manager]], and [[theatre producer|producer]]. He entered show business as a [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]] singer.&lt;ref&gt;Beasley 192.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1860s, Leavitt had made the leap to management and, following the precedent set by others, was touring [[variety show]] troupes in rural areas, billing them as authentic city entertainment.&lt;ref name="Barth 198"&gt;Barth 198.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1870, Leavitt had made a name in the theater industry by importing acts to North America from Europe.&lt;ref name="Allen 163"&gt;Allen 163.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt's companies toured both the United States and Mexico; he had a corner on the best theaters in the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Steinmeyer 106.&lt;/ref&gt; He sometimes worked in partnership with his brother, [[Abraham Leavitt]].&lt;ref name="Business Man 104"&gt;Grau, ''The Business Man'', 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Acts he managed include magicians [[Alexander Herrmann]] and [[Harry Kellar]].&lt;ref&gt;Steinmeyer 103.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his memoirs, Leavitt claimed to have made several innovations in American show business.&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he credited himself with the introduction of [[lithograph]]ic theater posters to the United States in 1872 after he had brought some back from Europe. By the end of the 1870s, lithographic printing had begun to supplant block printing for theater advertising. Leavitt claimed that in the late 1870s, his six to eight touring burlesque companies required $8,000 to $20,000 worth of lithographs posters each season.&lt;ref&gt;Allen 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Leavitt's claims was that he was the first to use "all star" as a billing description.&lt;ref&gt;Leavitt 189.&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that in 1880, he was the first to use the term ''[[vaudeville]]'' to describe a variety show.&lt;ref name="Barth 198"/&gt;

Historians usually cite Leavitt's greatest innovation as the creation of the first touring [[burlesque]] company and of the burlesque style in general.&lt;ref name="Allen 163"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilmeth and Miller 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Leavitt had witnessed a European troupe known as Rentz's Circus sometime in the 1870s. He then decided to form an all-woman blackface minstrel troupe, which he named [[Madame Rentz's Female Minstrels]].&lt;ref name="Allen 163"/&gt; The format of its shows, which Leavitt introduced, merged the three-act blackface minstrel show with aspects of [[Lydia Thompson]]'s all-female troupe's show, vaudeville, and [[musical travesty]]. He called the new genre "[[burlesque]]".&lt;ref name="L&amp;W 226"&gt;Londré and Watermeier 226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shteir 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The troupe, later renamed the Rentz-Stantley Company and then the Rentz-Stantley Novelty and Burlesque Company, was a success,&lt;ref name="Business Man 104"/&gt; and it set the standard for burlesque companies through the 1880s and 1890s.&lt;ref name="L&amp;W 226"/&gt;

Leavitt had a taste for [[sensationalism]].&lt;ref name="Allen 163"/&gt; For example, in 1884, he bought the rights to ''[[The Danites]]'', a play by [[McKee Rankin]] that was quite critical of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (Mormons). Leavitt then decided to stage the play in [[Salt Lake City]], historical center of Mormonism, as a [[publicity stunt]].&lt;ref&gt;Beasley 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Leavitt also handled magicians [[Alexander Herrmann]] and [[Harry Kellar]].  "Whenever I open a new theatre, " Leavitt once said, "I want to insure of large crowds, I will have Herrmann the Great play the date."  Herrmann was always a drawing card where ever he played, receiving fifty percent of the gross receipt earning $75,000 a year (about $3 million in today's figures).

Aged 70 in 1914, Leavitt came out of retirement to enter the [[motion picture]] business. He secured the rights to present the film ''[[Sixty Years a Queen]]'' in the Canadian [[Maritimes]]. Despite his advanced age, show business chronicler Robert Grau described Leavitt as "yet as spry and apparently as youthful as he was in his palmy days".&lt;ref&gt;Grau, ''The Theatre of Science'', 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Speed Freaks''''' ('''''Speed Punks''''' in North America), is a [[racing video game]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] for up to two players (four with a multi-tap for PlayStation).

The game involves racing around a variety of tracks while using several weapons; including items that make the racer's speed increase, missiles, and slime. The game was developed by [[Funcom]] and released in Europe in September 15, 1999 and in North America on March 31, 2000.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Speed Freaks PSX Screenshot.png|thumb|Single player Tournament mode. The green cubes are the pick-up icons and the purple hexagons are speed boost tokens.]]
Speed Freaks is a kart racing game featuring several single and multiplayer modes. During the game, players take control of one of nine characters and drive karts around tracks with various themes. During a race, the player's viewpoint is from behind his or her kart. The goal of the game is to either finish a race ahead of other racers, who are [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|controlled by the computer]] and other players, or complete a circuit in the fastest time.

Icons marked with question marks are arrayed on the race tracks; they give weapons (pick-ups) to a player's kart if the vehicle passes over them. Pick-ups, such as missiles and slime, allow racers to hit others with the objects, causing them to spin and lose control. A kart that obtains the stealth mode pick-up is temporarily invulnerable to attack. Lines of speed boost tokens are found on the tracks. By running through these tokens, a kart collects them and fills cells on its speed boost bar. The player can use accumulated speed boost to increase speed at a faster rate than under normal acceleration.

===Modes===

''Speed Freaks'' has three single player modes, Tournament, Single Race and Time attack. In Tournament one player races against five computer-controlled characters in a series of four races called leagues. There are three leagues available, titled Easy, Medium and Hard. Initially only the Easy league is available, by finishing this league, the Medium league is unlocked, which in turn unlocks the Hard league when finished. In order to continue through a league a position of third or higher must be achieved in each race. If a player finishes in fourth to sixth position, the race must be retry – at the cost of one of a limited number of retries – until a placing of third or above is achieved. Points are accrued by finishing in the top three positions in a race; first to third place receive ten, seven and five points. Computer controlled characters are also awarded three points for fourth place and one point for fifth place. The racer with the highest number of points after all four races have been completed wins the league. winning all of the races in a league unlocks one of Three Challenges. In each challenge a player races against one computer-controlled character in a single race, where if the player wins the race, their opponent becomes a playable character. In single race mode, players compete against five computer-controlled characters at a track of the players' choosing from those that are present in Tournament mode. In time attack mode, players race against the clock through the same tracks that are present in Tournament mode, attempting to set the fastest time possible.

''Speed Freaks'' also has two multiplayer modes; Vs. and Multiplayer. In Vs. mode two players race against each other either in a single race or through a league, on the same tracks as are present in the Tournament mode, with the screen split in half. In Multiplayer mode three or four players race against each other, on one of 12 additional tracks. The tracks featured in this mode have lower detail than those in single player and Vs. mode.&lt;ref name="powerpreview" /&gt; This game mode requires the [[Multitap]] peripheral in order for four controllers to be connected to the PlayStation.

===Characters===

''Speed Freaks'' features nine original characters from which the player can choose to compete as or against. Six characters are available immediately at the start of the game and three further characters can be unlocked by beating them in a challenge. Each character's kart has different capabilities with differing levels of top speed, acceleration and handling.

== Development ==
''Speed Freaks'' was produced by Padraig Crowley and designed and developed by the SD Team at Funcom Dublin in Ireland.&lt;ref name="manualcredits"&gt;{{cite book |title=Speed Freaks Manual |publisher=Sony Computer Entertainment Europe |article=Credits |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game took over two years to develop. Working titles used included "Project SDR" and "Wheelnuts".&lt;ref name="powerpreview"&gt;{{cite news| title = Speed Freaks (Preview) | work = Playstation Power Issue 40 | pages = 32–35 | publisher = Future Publishing|date=June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was released in North America under the title ''Speed Punks''. Sony acquired the rights to publish the game in the region as early as the summer of 1999, but held back as to avoid competing with ''[[Crash Team Racing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=IGN staff | date=April 13, 2000 | title=Speed Punks | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/14/speed-punks-2 | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Travelling Without Moving]]" by [[Jamiroquai]] is used in the introduction video of this videogame. Other music within the game is by Martin Schioler.&lt;ref name="manualcredits" /&gt;

==Reception==
The game received mostly positive reviews. [[IGN]] gave it a 9/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Bishop, Sam | date=April 19, 2000 | title=Speed Punks | url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2000/04/20/speed-punks | publisher=[[IGN]] | accessdate=December 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic''''' is a 2015 essay collection by music critic [[Jessica Hopper]].&lt;ref name="Voice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Potts|first1=Dianca|title=Jessica Hopper Compiles Greatest Hits for Her First Collection of Rock Criticism|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/jessica-hopper-compiles-greatest-hits-for-her-first-collection-of-rock-criticism-6628420|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=Village Voice|date=May 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=Eliza|title=Jessica Hopper: Stop Telling Girls the Way They Listen to Music Is Wrong|url=http://time.com/3847346/jessica-hopper-music-critic/|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=Time Magazine|date=May 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and publication==
The idea of collecting her columns into a book had been suggested to Hopper some years earlier by [[Akashic Books|Akashic]] publisher [[Johnny Temple (bassist)|Johnny Temple]]; the project ultimately came to fruition when her friend, musician [[Tim Kinsella]], became head of [[Featherproof Books]] in 2014 and asked Hopper to make a book of her criticism his first project with the publishing house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/2015/05/12/rock_critic_jessica_hopper_on_being_young_female_and_unapologetic_about_her_place_in_the_canon_if_i_dont_fit_in_it_then_who_the_fk_does/|title=Rock critic Jessica Hopper on being young, female and unapologetic about her place in the canon: "If I don’t fit in it, then who the f**k does?"|date=May 12, 2015|work=Salon|last1=Zaleski|first1=Annie|accessdate=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jessica Hopper.jpg|thumb|left|Jessica Hopper in 2015]]
Featherproof published the book on May 12, 2015.

==Content==
The book contains 42 pieces of Hopper's work, organized thematically into eight chapters.&lt;ref name="Snapes Guardian" /&gt; They are drawn from reviews, interviews, and essays in a range of publications from mainstream to fanzines.

==Reception==
''The First Collection'''s popularity prompted three print runs from presales alone.&lt;ref name="Snapes Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Snapes|first1=Laura|title=Jessica Hopper: 'I can't mute my moral self when listening to a record'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/14/jessica-hopper-new-book-macho-world-of-rock-writing|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=The Guardian|date=May 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing the book in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Kathleen Rooney compared Hopper to critics like [[Pauline Kael]] and [[Susan Sontag]], saying "Every piece...is powerfully written, wittily observed and unafraid to argue. Taken individually...and as a whole, they make an airtight case for why the professional critic still matters, and why it is a thrill to spend time in the presence of someone whose job it is to care so much and so intelligently."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-prj-first-collection-rock-criticism-jessica-hopper-20150514-story.html|title=Review: 'The First Collection of Criticism by a Living Female Rock Critic' by Jessica Hopper|last=Rooney|first=Kathleen|date=May 14, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2017-07-07|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' book critic [[Dwight Garner (critic)|Dwight Garner]] described ''The First Collection'' as "by turns loose and warm and finicky and outraged, and its best pieces are more observant than 94 percent of the first novels that have come my way this year."&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Garner|first1=Dwight|title=Review: Jessica Hopper Looks Beyond the Boys and Their Bands in a New Book|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/18/books/review-jessica-hopper-looks-beyond-the-boys-and-their-bands-in-a-new-book.html|accessdate=11 March 2016|work=New York Times|date=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Girl with the Whooping Cough''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|play]] written by [[Stanislaus Stange]] in 1910. Adapted from a French farce, the show featured [[dialogue]] that was condemned as indecent by many contemporary reviewers. The play's appearance on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] was suppressed when [[New York City]] officials threatened not to renew the operating license of the theater.

==Plot==
The story follows the misbehaviors of Regina ([[Valeska Suratt]]) as she passes [[whooping cough]] to the numerous men she kisses. In the final act, her amours land her in divorce court, where she performs a dance routine borrowed from Suratt's [[vaudeville]] act.&lt;ref name="boardman"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gerald |last=Bordman |title=American Theatre: A Chronicle of Comedy and Drama, 1869-1914 |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1994 |isbn=0-19-503764-2 |page=672}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytreview"&gt;{{cite news |title=Whooping Cough Girl Stupid |work=The New York Times |date=April 26, 1910 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/04/26/104931199.pdf |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadway production and suppression==
After early performances in [[Trenton, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name="trenton"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor Closes N.Y. Theater |work=Trenton True American |date=May 11, 1910 |page=1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=eXRFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=l7wMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1464,1425323&amp;dq=girl-with-the-whooping-cough&amp;hl=en |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; producer [[Albert H. Woods|Al Woods]] brought the play to [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], with sultry vaudeville actress [[Valeska Suratt]] in the lead role. It opened at the [[Olympia Theatre (New York City)|New York Theatre]] on April 25, 1910. Trenton police had attended a rehearsal and declared the play fit for performance after some mild [[censorship]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Censor Today's Show |work=Trenton True American |date=March 26, 1910 |page=1 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2mdgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DHINAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3088,3937067 |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when it came to New York, Mayor [[William Jay Gaynor]] viewed it less favorably. Hearing rumors about the play's content, he reviewed a script beforehand and found nothing objectionable in it. When the production went live, he received complaints that made him suspect he had not been given an accurate script. He decided to send [[stenographers]] to take notes on its content. They reported back that the actors had "interpolated" salacious elements into the performance.&lt;ref name="blue"&gt;{{cite book |title=Blue Vaudeville: Sex, Morals and the Mass Marketing of Amusement, 1895-1915 |first=Andrew L. |last=Erdman |publisher=McFarland |location=Jefferson, North Carolina |year=2004 |isbn=0-7864-1827-3 |page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this evidence, Gaynor asked [[New York City Police Commissioner]] William F. Baker to suppress the play. On May 6, 1910, Baker contacted the theater's management company, [[Klaw &amp; Erlanger]]. He threatened that if the play was not stopped, he would refuse to renew the theater's operating license, which expired at the end of April. [[Abraham L. Erlanger]] promised to cancel the show, but Woods did not agree. After unsatisfactory meetings with Baker and Gaynor, Woods went to the [[New York Supreme Court]] on May 9, 1910, to get an [[injunction]] preventing the police from closing down the play. The judge gave Woods the order he requested, but while it prevented the authorities from interfering with the show directly, it did not compel them to renew the license for the theater. Left with no home for his production, Woods was forced to shut it down.&lt;ref name="mayor"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mayor Cuts Off an Indecent Play |work=The New York Times |date=May 11, 1910 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/11/104933700.pdf |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding the objections from Woods, Gaynor's actions garnered a positive response from the press. A column in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said his actions were guided by "common sense and good taste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Topics of the Week: New York's Censor |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 1910 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/14/104934647.pdf |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the show headed to other cities, Gaynor threatened to write other mayors to warn them against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Valeska Suratt, Actress Who Has Been Suppressed |work=The Day |date=May 12, 1910 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CPQgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=hXQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4130,1040946  |accessdate=August 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The play was "unmercifully damned by the critics", according to theater scholar [[Gerald Bordman]].&lt;ref name="boardman" /&gt; The ''Trenton True American'' described the performances there as "disgustingly vulgar".&lt;ref name="trenton" /&gt; A brief review of the Broadway opening from ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it "stupid", although the reviewer found some humor in the performance of supporting player Dallas Welford.&lt;ref name="nytreview" /&gt; Drama critic [[George Jean Nathan]] called it "nauseating and ... disgusting in its futile efforts to be risqué".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=George Jean |last=Nathan |authorlink=George Jean Nathan |title=The Dramatic Valedictory |work=[[The Smart Set]] |volume=31 |number=1 |date=May 1910 |page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the play went on the road after being shut down in New York, the ''Philadelphia Times'' declared it "coarse", "vulgar" and not worthy of any "self-respecting person".&lt;ref name="blue" /&gt;

'''''The Illusionist''''' is a 2006 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[mystery film]] written and directed by [[Neil Burger]] and starring [[Edward Norton]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Jessica Biel]]. It is based loosely on [[Steven Millhauser]]'s short story, "Eisenheim the Illusionist". The film tells the story of Eisenheim, a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]] in turn-of-the-century [[Vienna]], who reunites with his childhood love, a woman far above his social standing. The film also depicts a fictionalized version of the [[Mayerling incident]].

The film premiered at the [[2006 Sundance Film Festival]] and opened the 2006 [[Seattle International Film Festival]]; it was distributed in limited release to theaters on August 18, 2006, and expanded nationwide on September 1. The film was a commercial and critical success.

==Plot==

In [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]], 1889, a magician named Eisenheim is arrested by Chief Inspector Walter Uhl of the Vienna Police during a magic show involving [[necromancy]]. Later, Uhl explains the story of Eisenheim's life to Crown Prince Leopold.

Eisenheim was born to a cabinet-maker and became interested in magic after meeting a travelling magician. He also fell in love with Sophie, the [[Duchy of Teschen|Duchess von Teschen]], but the two were forbidden to see each other on account of the former being a peasant. They kept meeting secretly but were caught one day and separated by force. Eisenheim proceeded to study magic by travelling the world, and fifteen years later returned to Vienna to perform. During one performance, he encounters the adult Sophie and learns that she is expected to marry the Crown Prince Leopold, who, it is rumored, is brutal towards women and in the past even murdered one. Eisenheim conducts a private show for the Crown Prince and humiliates him in the course of it. In response, he is banned from performing again in Vienna. Eisenheim asks Sophie to flee with him, but Sophie is afraid that they will be hunted down and executed. Sophie also reveals that the Crown Prince is planning a ''[[coup d'etat]]'' against his elderly father, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]].

At the [[Mayerling]] hunting lodge, Sophie tries to end her engagement with Leopold. He reacts by chasing her into the stables with a sword, in full view of the servants. Sophie's body is discovered the next morning in the [[Vienna Woods]], an unknown man blamed for her assassination. This throws Eisenheim into a deep depression. He eventually buys a theatre and begins a new series of magic shows, this time focusing exclusively on the summoning of dead spirits. Leopold secretly attends one of them, during which Eisenheim summons the spirit of Sophie, who says that someone in the theater is her murderer. Leopold, highly unnerved, orders Uhl to arrest Eisenheim for fraud, but Eisenheim manages to avoid jail by openly confessing to the public that his show is a mere illusion.

Eisenheim is threatened that if he summons Sophie in his next performance, he will be arrested and likely imprisoned. Uhl attends the packed performance with dozens of officers, and in spite of the warnings, Eisenheim brings Sophie's spirit to life again. Uhl storms the stage with his officers, but to the shock and horror of the audience, Eisenheim is revealed to be a spirit when Uhl's hand passes through him. Eisenheim then fades away in front of everyone.

Uhl reveals to Leopold that he has found evidence - a jewel from Leopold's sword and Sophie's distinctive locket - which could implicate Leopold in Sophie's murder. Uhl has already informed the Emperor and the [[General Staff]] of Leopold's conspiracy to seize the throne. Leopold points a [[revolver]] at Uhl, threatening to kill him, but as officers of the imperial guard of the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] arrive, Leopold shoots himself in the head. Later, as Uhl leaves the palace, he places Sophie's locket in his pocket. He is now no longer Chief Inspector of Police. As a boy approaches him, he is jostled by a bearded man in a long coat. The boy gives him a package containing Eisenheim's notebook about the Orange Tree trick, which Uhl had been unable to figure out. He asks the boy who it was that gave him the notebook, and the boy replies "Herr Eisenheim."  He checks his pocket and realizes the person who jostled him stole the locket. He sees the man and chases after him, but the man boards a train and escapes. Uhl realizes the jostling and the notebook are a message from the illusionist, and begins to rethink recent events. He concludes that Sophie and Eisenheim staged her death so that she could be free of Leopold. Uhl laughs delightedly at the brilliance of their plan. Later, and far away, Sophie and Eisenheim start a new life together in a cabin at the foot of a beautiful mountain. Eisenheim places Sophie's locket in her palm.

==Production==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2017}}
The script was based loosely on "Eisenheim the Illusionist", a [[short story]] by [[Steven Millhauser]] from Millhauser's 1990 collection ''[[The Barnum Museum]]''. Together with ''[[The Prestige (film)|The Prestige]]'' and ''[[Scoop (2006 film)|Scoop]]'', ''The Illusionist'' was one of three films in 2006 to explore the world of [[Magic (illusion)|stage magicians]].

Magic consultancy and technical advice during the production was supplied by [[James Freedman (pickpocket)|James Freedman]], [[Ricky Jay]], Michael Weber and [[Scott Penrose]]. Director [[Neil Burger]] wrote, "Starting in pre-production, James (Freedman) became a major collaborator; brainstorming, designing and refining everything from small sleight of hand tricks to major narrative set pieces. He worked with [[Edward Norton]] preparing him for his stage performances and acted as a hand double in various scenes. His contribution was enormous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.magicweek.co.uk/backissues_0250-0299/0292.htm | title= News (Number 292) | date=28 January 2006| publisher=magicweek.co.uk | accessdate=2009-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aaron Johnson]], who plays the teenage Eduard in the beginning of the film, also learned how to do the ball trick seen in those scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people= Screenwriter/director [[Neil Burger]] |date=  |title= [[Audio commentary]] for ''The Illusionist'' |medium= DVD |publisher=  |accessdate =  |time=?{{When|date=December 2010}}  |id=  |isbn=  |oclc=  |quote=  |ref= }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The original story, on which the movie is based, does not include the artifice of the [[protagonist]] framing the Archduke for murder.

Although the film is set in [[Austria]], it was filmed mostly in the [[Czech Republic]]. The city of [[Vienna]] is represented in the film by [[Tábor]] and [[Prague]], while the scenes set in Eisenheim's childhood village were shot in [[Český Krumlov]]. The Crown Prince's castle is actually the historical fortress of [[Konopiště]] (located near [[Benešov]]), formerly the home of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]. The front gates of Leopold's Vienna palace (the [[Hofburg]]) were actually the front gates of [[Prague Castle]]. All other shots were at [[Barrandov Studios]] in Prague.

==Reception==

As of June 29, 2008 the film has earned worldwide box office receipts of $87,892,388, including $39,868,642 in the United States, exceeding its reported $16.5 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{mojo title|id=illusionist}}.  Retrieved 2009-12-25.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first five months after it was released on DVD in January 2007, the film earned $35.99 million in rental revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=homevideo&amp;id=illusionist.htm The Illusionist (2006) - DVD / Home Video Rentals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from [[Box Office Mojo]].

''The Illusionist'' received mostly positive reviews. [[Rotten Tomatoes]] classified it as 73% "certified fresh" with 190 reviews (as of March 4, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|id=illusionist|title=The Illusionist}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]'s review in ''The Chicago Reader'' praised Paul Giamatti's performance of "a character who feels sympathy for the magician but owes allegiance to Leopold and is therefore divided and compromised ... Giamatti's performance is subtle, expressive, and richly nuanced."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/060818/ Chicago Reader: Movie Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019042454/http://www.chicagoreader.com/features/stories/moviereviews/060818/ |date=2006-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stephen Holden]], in his review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', praised Edward Norton's role, which, according to him, "perfectly fits his disturbing inscrutability".&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/08/18/movies/18illu.html?ref=movies The Illusionist - Movie - Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] from ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Variety'' wrote that [[Jessica Biel]] "is entirely stunning enough to fight to the death over".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117929353.html?categoryId=31&amp;cs=1 ''The Illusionist'' Review from Sundance] from ''Variety'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|List of theatre personnel}}

A ''theatrical technician'', (variably known as a '''tech''', '''techie''', '''technician''', '''theatre tech''' or '''theatre technician''') is a person who operates technical equipment and systems in the [[performing arts]] and [[entertainment industry]].  In contrast to [[Performing arts|performers]], this broad category contains all "unseen" theatrical personnel who practice [[stagecraft]] and are responsible for the logistic and production-related aspects of a performance including designers, operators, and supervisors.  Many professional designers and technicians consider the diminutive "techie" to be offensive.

==Typical positions==
Theatrical responsibilities taken by technicians include:
* [[Set construction]] and [[Carpenter (theater)|theatrical carpentry]]
* [[Sound reinforcement system|Sound system]] configuration and [[Sound operator|operation]]
* [[Lighting design]] and [[Light board operator|light board operation]], [[Followspot operator|Followspot operation]], hanging and maintenance of [[stage lighting instrument]]s as well as [[Electrician (theater)|various other electrical jobs]]  
* [[Fly system|Flying]] of [[theatrical scenery|scenery]] and occasionally even [[actors]] by [[Fly crew|fly men]]
* Rigging of moveable and stationary set pieces by [[Rigger (entertainment)|rigger]]s
* [[Stage management]]
* [[Costume]] and [[Theatrical property|prop]] management
* Operation of [[Special effects]] including [[fog machines]] and [[pyrotechnics]]


A single theatrical technician may regularly do one or more of the above jobs during load in, load outs (strike), [[rehearsal]] and performance. Performance technicians are generally divided between those [[Theater (structure)#Basic elements of a theater structure|backstage]] (stagehands, Stage Managers) and those in a [[control room]] (lighting and audio technicians).  During load in and load out additional crew members may be needed due to the amount of work required to be completed in a short time span. Larger and more complex shows require larger crews and often personnel with specialized advanced skills to perform these job functions.

The position may be [[Volunteering|volunteer]] or a paid position. It is not uncommon to receive [[Remuneration|compensation]] (such as comp/free tickets to the current or future productions or items used in the show) in other forms than [[money]] for [[Wage|pay]]. This type of compensation allows the person working to receive value for their services while not costing the [[Theatrical producer|producer]] more out-of-pocket [[expenses]].  Theatrical technicians are represented by the [[International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees]] in the United States.

==Stagecraft classifications==
Stagecraft and technicians can be classified into departments and jobs as follows. Not all productions will have all departments or jobs filled, and, in many cases, one technician will perform multiple jobs (even if only possessing one title).

* [[Technical director|Technical Director]] – This person will typically oversee the carpentry, rigging, lighting and props departments as a liaison to the performance's primary [[theatre director|director]].  Depending on the production, a "TD" may also supervise the audio and pyrotechnics departments.  In smaller performances and venues, this position is commonly taken by the show's director, assistant director, or [[stage manager]].  In addition, non-resident venues (those that host touring or temporary performances rather than long-term productions) generally have an [[in-house]] Technical Director who oversees incoming event load-in, and a technical liaison between the venue's owner/manager and the director of the performance.

===Carpentry===
This is the general name for all work involving scenery, including the deck (floor) of the stage.
* [[Carpenter (theater)|Master Carpenter]] – Although there may be multiple Master Carpenters in a scene shop, typically a performance or tour will only have one. This technician will typically report directly to the Technical Director.
* Carpenter – Multiple carpenters may be attached to a single show, and report to the Master Carpenter. These technicians are responsible both for assembling and building the scenery as well as moving scenic elements during scene shifts.  Often these technicians also function as [[stagehand]]s.

===Electrics===
This department is responsible for all of the onstage lighting for a show including, but not limited to, practicals, stage lighting and [[followspots]]. Electricians are responsible for the assembly, installation, operation and maintenance of the lighting for a production.  The Electrics department is also typically in charge of any fog or haze machines used during a production, as well as the configuration of pyrotechnics and other special hardware.

* [[Master electrician|Master Electrician]] – The head of the Electrics department on a show, who typically reports directly to the Technical Director, but also sometimes to the Lighting Designer during the development phase of a show.  
** Head [[Spotlight operator|Followspot Operator]] – In some shows, a separate technician gives all cues to the follow spot operators to reduce the stage manager's workload.
** [[Light board operator]] – The person who operates the [[light board]] and controls all the stage lights during a show.  In smaller performances and venues, may be the Lighting Designer or the Master Electrician.
** [[Electrician (theater)|Electrician]] – Multiple electricians may be assigned to a single show. On touring shows, this can be a general designation, with specific positions as follows:
*** Deck Electrician – Responsible for all electric elements on the stage floor, including roving instruments, fog machines, practicals or lighting installed into scenic pieces. Also, in some shows (usually dance productions), where it is sometimes necessary to swap the color media on lighting instruments during the performance or re-focus lights that a performer may have bumped into, the Deck electrician may be responsible for these swaps. 
*** Followspot Operators – These technicians operate one or more [[followspots]] to track performers during a show.

===Rigging===

{{see also|Rigging (theatre)}}
This department is responsible for all equipment hung (flown) in the theater space. This department varies greatly from show to show, sometimes being absorbed into the Electrics or Carpentry departments. If the production incorporates personnel flying (such as in the staging of [[Peter Pan]]), there will usually be designated riggers specifically trained in flying actors. Rigging techniques and traditions come from sailing. Sailors were considered the earliest stagehands in history and many techniques used today for rigging in the theater are from standard uses on boats. Theater technicians today have also incorporated techniques from mountain climbers as well to improve the capabilities of flying equipment in the air. 
* Rigger – The general term for persons in this department. If a rigger is specifically assigned to a certain department, they will have a title referencing that department (Electrics Rigger).
* Flyman – Specific term normally used with counterweight rigging system for an operator of the linesets for those systems.
* Head Flyman – The senior technician in charge of the operations of a counterweight rigging system.

===Rigging systems===

A theater consists of four basic rigging systems such as: hemp house, single purchase, double purchase and truss. Proper knowledge of the basic rigging systems by theater technicians is how scenery is properly built and hung over people's heads for productions. The hemp house is where all the ropes are housed in the theater and are counterweighted with sandbags. Whereas a single purchase is where the loading floor is on the stage floor in order to reduce the amount of staged space in the wings. A double purchase system works quite differently compared to a single purchase because it puts the loading floor halfway between the stage floor and the loft blocks. The truss is considered as to be the most important rigging system in theater because it consists of two or more pieces of pipe fabricated together with cross bracing. The purpose of the truss is to replace standard pipes for extremely heavy loads to be lifted. &lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Kogler Carver|Carver, Rita Kogler]](2012). "Stagecraft Fundamentals Second Edition: A Guide and Reference for Theatrical Production", p. 256-262. Focal Press, MA. {{ISBN|9780240808574}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties===
The properties department is responsible for all hand and scenic [[Theatrical property|props]] for a show. This usually includes furniture, weaponry and consumables (paper, food and drink) for a production.  In addition to the above duties, the props department is responsible for the cleanliness of the stage floor, including sweeping and mopping of the stage surface.
* Propsmaster/Propsmistress – The head of the Properties department. Will also usually be in charge of purchasing or building the props for a show.
* Prop Runner – Those who must move scenic props on (and off) stage or supply actors with their props during the show. This job is often unnecessary in small shows.
* This position may also be referred to as a [[set dresser]].

===Audio===
The audio department is responsible for all sound production for a show, including the configuration of microphones, speakers and control equipment, as well as the production of any necessary audio tracks.  Personnel in this department include:

*[[Sound designer]] or [[audio engineer]], responsible for the configuration of the venue's sound system as a whole, including the placement and designation of microphones, monitors, loudspeakers, and control hardware.  This position is often held by an [[acoustician]], especially in large performances requiring musical or orchestral sound reinforcement.
*[[Sound operator]], responsible for the [[Audio mixing (live audio)|live mixing]] of the performance's audio at a master [[Mixing console|sound board]].  Often referred to as '''A-1''' to designate the first (highest) position of the production '''A'''udio department.  This technician is generally positioned in the back of the audience space, so as to hear the performance's audio directly rather than be forced to use a monitoring system, and is responsible for maintaining volume for performers and musicians while avoiding [[feedback]] and other problems.
**[[A2 (theater)|A-2]], or audio assistant, responsible for the maintenance and monitoring of audio equipment used by the sound operator (specifically any [[lavalier]] microphones used in the performance).  Depending on performance size, this technician may perform other duties, including the operation of audio media devices.  In smaller performances, this position is often taken by a [[stagehand]] rather than a technician trained in audio.

===Pyrotechnics/special effects===
A rarely seen department in theatre due to the heavy restrictions on the use of true pyrotechnics and is sometimes combined with other tech departments (usually the Electrics department) is referred to as special effects. Theatrical technicians are responsible for the production and operation of explosives, special effects and illusions on sufficiently large theatrical productions. Today many of the special effects used on stage have been modernized and are extremely advanced the most commonly used effects are nature, fire, fog and haze. In order to make special effects seem more realistic on stage technicians use innovative techniques and special equipment to bring the production to life across the stage. For nature effects like wind, fans are commonly used to bring movement on stage by adjusting the speed and direction of the fan. For effects like fire, equipment is brought in to create flames and smoke and is usually operated by a licensed special effects operator. Whereas fog and haze machines are easy and accessible for technicians to use and only require fluid to be placed inside the machine to vaporize into fog and haze. These machines also have functions where the flow and speed of the fog and haze can be adjusted to control how its distributed throughout a production.&lt;ref&gt;Carver, Rita Kogler(2012).

'''Triboulet''' (1479–1536) was a [[jester]] of kings [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] and [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] of [[France]].

He appears in Book 3 of [[François Rabelais]]' Pantagrueline chronicles.  He appears in [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[Le Roi s'amuse]]'' and its opera version, [[Giuseppe Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'', a blend of "Triboulet" and French ''rigoler'' (to laugh), intended to deflect the censorship that Hugo's work had received. A ''triboulet'', a jester dressed entirely in red, is a character associated with the carnival of [[Monthey]] in [[Switzerland]].

==Attributed famous quotes==
* Triboulet once came to the Monarch with a complaint. 
:Triboulet: "A noble has threatened to hang me!"
:The Monarch: "Don't worry! If he hangs you I'll have him beheaded fifteen minutes later."
:Triboulet: "Well, would it be possible to behead him 15 minutes before?"
* Once, Triboulet could not contain himself and slapped the monarch on the bum. The monarch lost his temper and threatened to execute Triboulet. A little later, the monarch calmed down a little and promised to forgive Triboulet if he could think of an apology more insulting than the offending deed. A few seconds later, Triboulet responded: "I'm so sorry, your majesty, that I didn't recognize you! I mistook you for the Queen!"{{Citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=Could not find any mention of that story elsewhere.}}

==Death==
Having broken an order from Francis I forbidding Triboulet from making jokes on the queen and courtesans, the king ordered that he should be put to death. Having served particularly well the king for many years, Francis I granted Triboulet the right to choose the way he would die. Triboulet, with his sharp mind, said the following: "Bon sire, par sainte Nitouche et saint Pansard, patrons de la folie, je demande à  mourir de vieillesse." which translates to: "Sir, for Saint Nitouche's and Saint Pansard's sake, patrons of insanity, I choose to die from old age." Having no other choice than to laugh, the king ordered that Triboulet must not be executed, but rather instead be banished from the realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.triboulet.eu/pages/fou.htm|title = TRIBOULET : le fou des rois|date = 23 October 2014|accessdate = 28 December 2014|website = Triboulet|publisher = |last = |first = |language = fr|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228070723/http://www.triboulet.eu/pages/fou.htm|archivedate = 28 December 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.historia.fr/web/complement-mensuel/la-cour-triboulet-le-fou-du-roi-24-01-2008-44965|title = LA COUR : Triboulet, le fou du roi|date = 24 January 2008|accessdate = 28 December 2014|website = Historia|publisher = |last = |first = |language = fr|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141228070538/http://www.historia.fr/web/complement-mensuel/la-cour-triboulet-le-fou-du-roi-24-01-2008-44965|archivedate = 28 December 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
