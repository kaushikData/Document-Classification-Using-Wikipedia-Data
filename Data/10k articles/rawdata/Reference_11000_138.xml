      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13203">The following is a list of common non-native [[pronounce|pronunciations]] that [[English language|English]] speakers make when trying to speak foreign languages. Many of these are due to transfer of [[phonology|phonological]] rules from English to the new language as well as differences in [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] that they encounter.

This article uses [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] pronunciation. See [[Help:IPA pronunciation key]] and [[IPA chart for English]] for an introduction.

== Esperanto ==
{{See also|Esperanto phonology}}
*While English speakers tend to assimilate {{IPA|/m/}} to {{IPA|[ɱ]}} before {{IPA|/f/}} or {{IPA|/v/}}, as well {{IPA|/n/}} to {{IPA|[ŋ]}} before {{IPA|/k/}} or {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, neither of which occurs in "strictly regular" Esperanto.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|pp=41, 330–331}} However, since Zamenhof himself recognized [[Esperanto phonology#Assimilation|this type of assimilation]], there is debate over whether this is actually an error.
*Speakers tend to pronounce Esperanto {{IPA|/ɛ/}} as {{IPA|[eɪ]}}, the vowel of ''pay''.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=37}}
*Speakers tend to reduce unstressed vowels.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=38}}
*Speakers tend to pronounce {{IPA|/x/}} as {{IPA|[k]}} or otherwise have a hard time pronouncing it.  This sort of difficulty is behind the gradual shift from {{angbr|ĥ}} to {{angbr|k}} (see [[Esperanto phonology#Loss of phonemic ĥ]]).{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=39}}
*Speakers tend to pronounce the [[rhotic consonant]] as {{IPA|[ɹ]}}, rather than an [[alveolar trill]].  Speakers of [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|non-rhotic]] accents tend to mute the r when at end of a word or before consonant.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=40}}
*Other pronunciation difficulties are related to spelling pronunciations of digraphs. The digraph {{angbr|sc}} represents {{IPA|/st͡s/}}, though speakers may substitute {{IPA|[s]}} or {{IPA|[sk]}}. The digraph {{angbr|kn}} represents {{IPA|/kn/}}, though speakers may mute the {{IPA|/k/}}. The {{angbr|g}} in the digraph {{angbr|ng}} is always pronounced.{{sfnp|Blanke|2001|p=41}}

== German ==
{{See also|Standard German phonology}}
* There are several German vowels that create problems for English speakers:
** One of the most difficult is German {{IPA|/eː/}} as it is further forward in the mouth than in varieties of Standard English so that speakers may pronounce German ''Geht'' as if it were English ''gate''.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=81}}
** Similarly, speakers may pronounce German {{IPA|/oː/}} with the vowel of ''goat'' so that ''ohne'' is pronounced {{IPA|[ˈəʊnə]}}.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=91}}
** English speakers tend to have difficulty with the front rounded vowels, {{IPA|/øː/}}, {{IPA|/œ/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}}, and {{IPA|/ʏ/}}{{sfnp|Hall|2003|pp=92-97}} (written {{angbr|ö}} and {{angbr|ü}}).
** Speakers have some difficulty with German {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/aː/}}, which may be pronounced as {{IPA|[æ]}} and {{IPA|[ɑː]}}, respectively.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|pp=85-87}} 
* English speakers also have difficulty with the two sounds represented by ''ch'' ({{IPA|[x]}} and {{IPA|[ç]}}) in German, particularly the latter.{{sfnp|Hall|2003|p=46}} Often both are replaced with {{IPA|[k]}}; replacement of {{IPA|[ç]}} with {{IPA|[ʃ]}} is also common. They also have difficulty with the [[guttural r]] of most German dialects.&lt;ref&gt;http://joycep.myweb.port.ac.uk/pronounce/consonch.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=December 2012}}

== Mandarin Chinese ==
{{see also|Standard Chinese phonology}}
*English speakers have difficulty with the 4 lexical [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]].{{sfnp|Gottfried|Suiter|1997}}

== Russian ==
{{See also|Russian phonology}}
* Some speakers have difficulty with the trilled {{IPA|[r]}} in Russian, especially the palatalized {{IPA|[rʲ]}} since neither are sounds of English.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=185}}
** Non-rhotic speakers, even after learning the rolled-r, are prone to omit {{IPA|/r/}} in such Russian words as удар {{IPA|[ʊˈdar]}} ('blow') and горка {{IPA|[ˈɡorkə]}} ('hillock').
* Depending on the speaker's dialect, they may have difficulty with "dark l" {{IPA|[ɫ]}} (that is, velarized {{IPA|[l]}}, which in Russian contrasts with a palatalized {{IPA|[lʲ]}}) in positions other than in the syllable coda.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=168}}
* Difficulty with Russian vowels:
** Most English speakers have no {{IPA|[ɨ]}} (although it is an allophone in some dialects, see [[weak vowel merger]]) and speakers generally have difficulty producing the sound.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=33}} They may instead produce {{IPA|[ɪ]}}.
** Speakers may replace {{IPA|/e/}} with the diphthong in ''day''.  e.g. {{IPA|[ˈdeɪlə]}} instead of {{IPA|[ˈdʲelə]}} дело ('affair').{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=41}}
** Speakers are likely to diphthongize {{IPA|/u/}}, making сижу {{IPA|[sʲɪˈʐu]}}  ('I sit') sound more like {{IPA|[sɪˈʒʊu]}}.  Some speakers may also universally front it to {{IPA|[ʉ]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=64}}
** Speakers may also diphthongize {{IPA|/i/}} in a similar fashion, especially in open syllables.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=30}}
** Speakers may have difficulty with Russian {{IPA|/o/}}, pronouncing it as either {{IPA|[ɔ]}} or {{IPA|[oʊ]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=56}}
** It is likely that speakers will make the second element of Russian diphthongs insufficiently close, making them resemble English diphthongs (e.g., {{IPA|[druzʲeɪ]}} instead of {{IPA|[druzʲej]}}) or pronounce it too long.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=75}}
** Speakers may pronounce {{IPA|/a/}} as {{IPA|[æ]}} in closed syllables так ('so') and {{IPA|[ɑ]}} in open syllables два ('two').{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=47}}
* Speakers may also have difficulty with the [[Russian vowel reduction]] system as well as other allophonic vowels.
** Tendency to reverse the distribution of {{IPA|[ɐ]}} and {{IPA|[ə]}}. English speakers tend to pronounce {{IPA|[ə]}} in the pretonic position, right where {{IPA|[ɐ]}} is required in Russian, while they pronounce {{IPA|[ɐ]}} in pre-pretonic positions, where {{IPA|[ə]}} occurs. Thus, speakers may say  голова ('head') as {{IPA|[ɡɐləˈva]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɡəlɐˈva]}} and сторона ('side') as {{IPA|[stɐrəˈna]}} instead of {{IPA|[stərɐˈna]}}.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=55}}
* There are no cues to indicate correct stress in Russian. Speakers must memorize where primary and secondary stress resides in each word and are likely to make mistakes.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=212}}
* Speakers tend to fail to geminate double consonants.{{sfnp|Jones|Ward|1969|p=214}}

== Serbo-Croatian ==
{{See also|Serbo-Croatian phonology}}
* Speakers may have a difficulty with Serbo-Croatian pitch accent and vowel length. This rarely leads to loss of intelligibility as long as the word stress is correct.{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=8}}{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=4}}
** Speakers may transfer vowel length from English, producing longer vowels before voiced consonants (such as {{IPA|/b/}} or {{IPA|/z/}}) and shorter vowels before the voiceless ones (such as {{IPA|/p/}} or {{IPA|/s/}}) - see [[pre-fortis clipping]]. In Serbo-Croatian, vowels can be long or short in any environment; in fact, there are minimal pairs based only on length: compare ''grad'' {{nowrap|{{IPA|/ɡrâd/}}}} ('city') with ''grad'' {{IPA|/ɡrâːd/}} ('hall').{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=10}}
** If speakers learn to produce correct vowel length, they may diphthongize long {{IPA|/iː, uː, eː, oː/}} to {{IPA|[ɪi, ʊu, eɪ, oʊ]}} instead of the correct {{IPA|[{{IPA link|iː}}, {{IPA link|uː}}, {{IPA link|e̞|eː}}, {{IPA link|o̞|oː}}]}}.{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=3}}{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=12, 20}}
* Speakers may incorrectly reduce unstressed vowels to {{IPAblink|ə}}, yielding pronunciations such as {{IPA|[ləpǒtə]}} instead of {{IPA|[lepǒta]}} for ''lepota'' ('beauty'). In Serbo-Croatian, vowels do not change their quality in unstressed positions.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=10}}{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=4}}
* Voiced consonants ({{IPA|/b, d, ɡ, dʒ, dʑ, z, ʒ/}}) can be only partially {{IPA|[b̥, d̥, ɡ̊, d̥ʒ̊, d̥ʑ̊, z̥, ʒ̊]}} rather than fully voiced {{IPA|[{{IPA link|b}}, {{IPA link|d̪|d}}, {{IPA link|ɡ}}, {{IPA link|dʐ|dʒ}}, {{IPA link|dʑ}}, {{IPA link|z}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʒ}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=30−31}}
** Similarly, {{IPA|/ʋ/}} (which phonologically is an approximant and therefore not the voiced counterpart of {{IPA|/f/}}) can also be realized as a partially voiced fricative {{IPA|[v̥]}} instead of a fully voiced weak fricative {{IPAblink|v|ʋ̝}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=30}}{{sfnp|Morén|2005|pp=5–6}}
* Speakers may incorrectly realize the voiceless stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} as aspirated {{IPA|[pʰ, tʰ, kʰ]}}.{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|p=3}}{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=30−31, 33}}
* Speakers may realize {{IPA|/n, t, d/}} as alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n}}, {{IPA link|t}}, {{IPA link|d}}]}} rather than dental {{IPA|[{{IPA link|n̪}}, {{IPA link|t̪}}, {{IPA link|d̪}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=31, 34}}
** Speakers may incorrectly transfer allophones of English {{IPA|/t/}} to Serbo-Croatian, yielding pronunciations such as {{IPA|[tʃûɾi]}} instead of {{IPA|[tʃûti]}} for ''čuti'' ('to hear') or {{IPA|[ɲûʔn̩]}} instead of {{IPA|[ɲûtn̩]}} for ''njutn'' ('newton'), all of which sound strange to native ears and might not even be understood as belonging to the {{IPA|/t/}} phoneme, potentially leading to a serious loss of intelligibility.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=31}}
* Speakers may have a difficulty distinguishing {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}} from {{IPA|/tɕ, dʑ/}}. This does not lead to loss of intelligibility as many natives merge them as well.{{sfnp|Kordić|1997|p=5}}{{sfnp|Alexander|2006|pp=3−4}}
** Speakers who try to distinguish {{IPA|/tʃ, dʒ/}} from {{IPA|/tɕ, dʑ/}} may realize the former with inappropriate palatalization, i.e. as palato-alveolar {{IPA|[{{IPA link|tʃ}}, {{IPA link|dʒ}}]}} instead of flat postalveolar (laminal retroflex) {{IPA|[{{IPA link|tʂ|t̻ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|dʐ|d̻ʐ̻}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=32}}
** The same applies to {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}}, which can be realized as {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʃ}}, {{IPA link|ʒ}}]}} instead of {{IPA|[{{IPA link|ʂ|ʂ̻}}, {{IPA link|ʐ|ʐ̻}}]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=32}}
* Speakers may realize {{IPA|/x/}} as glottal {{IPAblink|h}}, rather than a weak velar fricative {{IPAblink|x|x̞}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=33}}
* The palatal sounds {{IPA|/ɲ, ʎ/}} may be realized as sequences {{IPA|[nj, lj]}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=34}}
* Instead of a trill {{IPAblink|r}}, {{IPA|/r/}} can be realized as a postalveolar approximant {{IPAblink|ɹ̠}}.{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|pp=32–33}}
* {{IPA|/j/}} preceded within the same word by a vowel (as in ''gaj'' {{IPA|/ɡâːj/}} ('grove')) can be articulated with an insufficiently raised tongue ({{IPA|[ɪ̯]}} instead of {{IPA|[i̯]}} or {{IPAblink|j}}).{{sfnp|Hodge|Janković|1965|p=29}}

[[File:Odo bayeux tapestry.png|thumb|upright=1.3|A scene from the Bayeux Tapestry depicting [[Odo, Bishop of Bayeux]], rallying Duke [[William the Conqueror|William's]] troops during the [[Battle of Hastings]] in 1066]]

The '''Bayeux Tapestry''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|b|aɪ|ˈ|j|ɜː|,_|b|eɪ|-}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|b|eɪ|j|uː|,_|ˈ|b|aɪ|-}}; {{lang-fr|Tapisserie de Bayeux}} {{IPA-fr|tapisʁi də bajø|}} or {{lang|fr|La telle du conquest}}; {{lang-la|Tapete Baiocense}}) is an [[embroidery|embroidered]] cloth nearly {{convert|70|m|ft}} long and {{convert|50|cm|in}} tall,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reframing Medieval Art: Difference, Margins, Boundaries|last=Caviness|first=Madeline H.|publisher=Tufts University|year=2001|isbn=|location=Medford, MA|pages=|quote=|via=http://dca.lib.tufts.edu/caviness/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koslin|first=Desirée|year=1990|title=Turning Time in the Bayeux Embroidery|url=|journal=Textile &amp; Text|volume=13|pages=28–29|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=La tapisserie de Bayeux|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|publisher=Zodiaque|year=1966|isbn=|location=La Pierre-qui-Vire|page=23|quote=et combien pauvre alors ce nom de broderie nous apparaît-il!|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts the events leading up to the [[Norman conquest of England]] concerning [[William the Conqueror|William, Duke of Normandy]], and [[Harold Godwinson|Harold, Earl of Wessex, later King of England]], and culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. It is thought to date to the 11th century, within a few years after the battle. It tells the story from the point of view of the conquering Normans, but is now agreed to have been made in England.

According to Sylvette Lemagnen, conservator of the tapestry, in her 2005 book ''La Tapisserie de Bayeux'':

{{quote|The Bayeux tapestry is one of the supreme achievements of the Norman [[Romanesque art|Romanesque]]&amp;nbsp;.... Its survival almost intact over nine centuries is little short of miraculous&amp;nbsp;... Its exceptional length, the harmony and freshness of its colours, its exquisite workmanship, and the genius of its guiding spirit combine to make it endlessly fascinating.&lt;ref&gt;Sylvette Lemagnen, Preface, p. 9; {{cite book |last1=Musset  |first1=Lucien |last2=Rex |first2=Richard  (translator); |title=La Tapisserie de Bayeux: œuvre d'art et document historique |trans-title=The Bayeux Tapestry |type=annotated edition |edition=First |date=1 November 2005 |origyear=1989 |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer Ltd |location=Woodbridge, United Kingdom |isbn=978-1-84383-163-1 |page=272 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The cloth consists of some fifty scenes with Latin ''[[tituli]]'', embroidered on linen with coloured woollen yarns. It is likely that it was commissioned by [[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]], William's half-brother, and made in England—not Bayeux—in the 1070s. In 1729 the hanging was rediscovered by scholars at a time when it was being displayed annually in [[Bayeux Cathedral]]. The tapestry is now exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux in [[Bayeux]], [[Normandy]], France {{nowrap|({{coord|49.2744|N|0.7003|W|type:landmark_region:FR_source:wikidata|display=inline}}).}}

The designs on the Bayeux Tapestry are embroidered rather than woven, so that it is not technically a [[tapestry]].&lt;ref&gt;Saul, Nigel. "Bayeux Tapestry". ''A Companion to Medieval England''. Stroud, UK: Tempus.  pp. 32–33. {{ISBN|0-7524-2969-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it has always been referred to as a tapestry until recent years when the name "Bayeux Embroidery" has gained ground among certain art historians.  It can be seen as a rare example of secular [[Romanesque art]].  Tapestries adorned both churches and wealthy houses in Medieval Western Europe, though at 0.5 by 68.38 metres (1.6 by 224.3&amp;nbsp;ft, and apparently incomplete) the Bayeux Tapestry is exceptionally large.  Only the figures and decoration are embroidered, on a background left plain, which shows the subject very clearly and was necessary to cover large areas.

On 18 January 2018, [[President of France|French President]] [[Emmanuel Macron]] announced that the Bayeux Tapestry would be loaned to Britain for public display. It is expected to be exhibited at the [[British Museum]] in London from 2022. It will be the first time that it has left France in 950 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britain-to-get-bayeux-tapestry-as-macron-agrees-loan-n5brflnjx|title=Bayeux Tapestry to be displayed in Britain|website=The Times|date=17 January 2018|accessdate=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:Odo of Bayeux.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Odo, Earl of Kent|Bishop Odo]] of Bayeux]]
[[File:Bayeux - Cathédrale 6.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Bayeux Cathedral]], home of the tapestry in the Middle Ages and until the beginning of the 19th century]]
The earliest known written reference to the tapestry is a 1476 inventory of [[Bayeux Cathedral]],&lt;ref&gt;Fowke, Frank Rede. ''The Bayeux Tapestry&amp;nbsp;– A History and Description'', London: G. Bell &amp; Sons, 1913.&lt;/ref&gt; but its origins have been the subject of much speculation and controversy.

French legend maintained the tapestry was commissioned and created by [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]], [[William I of England|William the Conqueror's]] wife, and her [[lady-in-waiting|ladies-in-waiting]]. Indeed, in France, it is occasionally known as "La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde" (Tapestry of Queen Matilda). However, scholarly analysis&lt;ref&gt;Sir Frank Stenton (ed) et al, ''The Bayeux Tapestry. A comprehensive survey'' London: Phaidon, 1957 revised 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; in the 20th century concluded it was probably commissioned by William's half-brother, [[Odo of Bayeux|Bishop Odo]], who, after the Conquest, became [[Earl of Kent]] and, when William was absent in Normandy, [[regent]] of England.

The reasons for the Odo commission theory include: 1) three of the bishop's followers mentioned in the ''[[Domesday Book]]'' appear on the tapestry; 2) it was found in Bayeux Cathedral, built by Odo; and 3) it may have been commissioned at the same time as the cathedral's construction in the 1070s, possibly completed by 1077 in time for display on the cathedral's dedication.

Assuming Odo commissioned the tapestry, it was probably designed and constructed in England by [[Anglo-Saxon art]]ists (Odo's main power base being by then in [[Kent]]); the Latin text contains hints of Anglo-Saxon; other embroideries originate from England at this time; and the vegetable dyes can be found in cloth traditionally woven there.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712134414/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=22472&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html UNESCO World Heritage nomination form], in English and French.

Clarke has proposed that the designer of the tapestry was [[Scolland]], the abbot of [[St Augustine's Abbey]] in [[Canterbury]], because of his previous position as head of the scriptorium at [[Mont Saint-Michel]] (famed for its illumination), his travels to [[Trajan's Column]], and his connections to [[Wadard]] and Vital, two individuals identified in the tapestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Clarke|first=Howard B.|title=The Identity of the Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry|journal=Anglo-Norman Studies|year=2013|volume=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Designer of the Bayeux Tapestry identified|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2013/10/29/designer-of-the-bayeux-tapestry-identified/|publisher=Medievalists.net|accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual physical work of stitching was most likely undertaken by female needleworkers. [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon]] needlework of the more detailed type known as [[Opus Anglicanum]] was famous across Europe.  It was perhaps commissioned for display in the hall of his palace and then bequeathed to the cathedral he built, following the pattern of the documented but lost hanging of [[Byrhtnoth]].&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp. 134–36&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternative theories exist. [[Carola Hicks]] has suggested it could possibly have been commissioned by [[Edith of Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/04/2006_21_mon.shtml "New Contender for The Bayeux Tapestry?"], from the BBC, 22 May 2006. ''The Bayeux Tapestry: The Life Story of a Masterpiece'', by [[Carola Hicks]] (2006). {{ISBN|0-7011-7463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wolfgang Grape has challenged the consensus that the embroidery is Anglo-Saxon, distinguishing between Anglo-Saxon and other Northern European techniques;&lt;ref&gt;See Grape, Wolfgang, ''The Bayeux Tapestry: Monument to a Norman Triumph'', Prestel Publishing, 3791313657&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval material authority Elizabeth Coatsworth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/ViewContributor/document/obo-9780195396584/obo-9780195396584-0133.xml?id=con2432 |title=Oxford Bibliographies Online&amp;nbsp;– Author (Contributor: Elizabeth Coatsworth) |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=4 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; contradicted this: "The attempt to distinguish Anglo-Saxon from other Northern European embroideries before 1100 on the grounds of technique cannot be upheld on the basis of present knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Coatsworth, "Stitches in Time: Establishing a History of Anglo-Saxon Embroidery", p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; George Beech suggests the tapestry was executed at the [[Abbey of Saint-Florent de Saumur|Abbey of St. Florent]] in the Loire Valley, and says the detailed depiction of the Breton campaign argues for additional sources in France.&lt;ref&gt;Beech, George: ''Was the Bayeux Tapestry Made in France?: The Case for St. Florent of Saumur''.

== Construction, design and technique ==
[[File:Bayeux tapestry laid work detail..jpg|thumb|Detail of [[Backstitch|stem stitching]] and laid work.]]

In common with other embroidered hangings of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval period]], this piece is conventionally referred to as a "tapestry", although it is not a true [[tapestry]] in which the design is [[weaving|woven]] into the cloth; it is in fact an [[embroidery]].

The Bayeux tapestry is embroidered in [[crewel]] ([[wool]] [[yarn]]) on a [[plain weave|tabby-woven]] [[linen]] ground 68.38 metres long and 0.5 metres wide ({{convert|68.38|x|0.5|m|ft|disp=output only}}) and using two methods of stitching: [[backstitch|outline or stem stitch]] for lettering and the outlines of figures, and [[couching (embroidery)|couching or laid work]] for filling in figures.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Coatsworth" /&gt; Nine linen panels, between fourteen and three metres in length, were sewn together after each was embroidered and the joins were disguised with subsequent embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; At the first join (start of [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#14|scene 14]]) the borders do not line up properly but the technique was improved so that the later joins are practically invisible.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The design involved a broad central zone with narrow decorative borders top and bottom.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; By inspecting the woollen threads behind the linen it is apparent all these aspects were embroidered together at a session and the awkward placing of the ''tituli'' is not due to them being added later.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Later generations have patched the hanging in numerous places and some of the embroidery (especially in the [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|final scene]]) has been reworked.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The tapestry may well have maintained much of its original appearance—it now compares closely with a careful drawing made in 1730.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

The main yarn colours are terracotta or russet, blue-green, dull gold, olive green, and blue, with small amounts of dark blue or black and sage green. Later repairs are worked in light yellow, orange, and light greens.&lt;ref name="Wilson" /&gt; Laid yarns are couched in place with yarn of the same or contrasting colour.

The tapestry's central zone contains most of the action, which sometimes overflows into the borders either for dramatic effect or because depictions would otherwise be very cramped (for example at Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#27|death scene]]). Events take place in a long series of scenes which are generally separated by highly stylised trees. However, the trees are not placed consistently and the greatest scene shift, between Harold's audience with Edward after his return to England and Edward's [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#26|burial scene]], is not marked in any way at all.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

The ''tituli'' are normally in the central zone but occasionally use the top border. The borders are otherwise mostly purely decorative and only sometimes does the decoration complement the action in the central zone. The decoration consists of birds, beasts, fish and scenes from fables, agriculture, and hunting. There are frequent oblique bands separating the vignettes. There are nude figures, some of corpses from battle, others of a ribald nature.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A [[Harrow (tool)|harrow]], a newly invented implement, is depicted ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#10|scene 10]]) and this is the earliest known depiction. The picture of [[Halley's Comet]], which appears in the upper border ([[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#32|scene 32]]), is the first known picture of this comet.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#58|end of the tapestry]] has been missing from time immemorial and the final ''titulus'' "Et fuga verterunt Angli" ("and the English left fleeing") is said to be "entirely spurious", added shortly before 1814 at a time of anti-English sentiment.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; [[Lucien Musset|Musset]]  speculates the hanging was originally about 1.5 metres longer.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; At the last section still remaining the embroidery has been almost completely restored but this seems to have been done with at least some regard to the original stitching.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The stylised tree is quite unlike any other tree in the tapestry.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|start of the tapestry]] has also been restored but to a much lesser extent.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

In 1724 a linen backing cloth was sewn on comparatively crudely and, in around the year 1800, large ink numerals were written on the backing which broadly enumerate each scene and which are still commonly used for reference.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;

== Background to the events depicted ==
In a series of pictures supported by a written commentary the tapestry tells the story of the events of 1064–1066 culminating in the [[Battle of Hastings]]. The two main protagonists are [[Harold Godwinson]], recently crowned King of England, leading the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] English, and [[William I of England|William, Duke of Normandy]], leading a mainly [[Normans|Norman]] army, sometimes called the [[companions of William the Conqueror]].&lt;ref name=musset /&gt;
[[File:Tapisserie agriculture.JPG|thumb|The [[courier|messengers]] with [[Guy I, Count of Ponthieu|Guy]], with a portrayal of medieval agriculture in the border]]
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene1 Edward.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward the Confessor]] sends Harold to Normandy]]

William was the [[illegitimate]] son of [[Robert the Magnificent]], [[Duke of Normandy]], and [[Herleva]] (or Arlette), a [[tanner (occupation)|tanner]]'s daughter. William became Duke of Normandy at the age of seven and was in control of Normandy by the age of nineteen. His half-brother was Bishop [[Odo of Bayeux]].

King [[Edward the Confessor]], king of England and about sixty years old at the time the tapestry starts its narration, had no children or any clear successor. Edward's mother, [[Emma of Normandy]], was William's great aunt. At that time [[Succession to the British throne#England|succession to the English throne]] was not by [[primogeniture]] but was decided jointly by the king and by an assembly of nobility, the [[Witenagemot]].

[[Harold Godwinson]], [[Earl of Wessex]] and the most powerful noble in England, was Edward's brother-in-law. The Norman chronicler [[William of Poitiers]]&lt;ref&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Edward had previously determined that William would succeed him on the throne, and Harold had sworn to honour this, and yet later that Harold had claimed Edward, on his deathbed, had made him heir over William. However, other sources, such as [[Eadmer]] dispute this claim.

== Events depicted in the tapestry ==
The tapestry begins with a panel of Edward the Confessor sending Harold to Normandy.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#1|(scene 1)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Later Norman sources say that the mission was for Harold to pledge loyalty to William but the tapestry does not suggest any specific purpose.&lt;ref name=hicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Hicks|first=Carola|author-link=Carola Hicks|title=The Bayeux Tapestry. The Life Story of a Masterpiece|year=2006|publisher=Chatto and Windus|isbn=0-7011-7463-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; By mischance, Harold arrives at the wrong location in France and is taken prisoner by [[Guy I, Count of Ponthieu|Guy, Count of Ponthieu]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#7|(scene 7)]]&lt;/sup&gt; After exchanges of messages borne by mounted messengers, Harold is released to William who then invites Harold to accompany him on a campaign against [[Conan II, Duke of Brittany]]. On the way, just outside the monastery of [[Mont Saint-Michel]], the army become mired in quicksand and Harold saves two Norman soldiers.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#17|(scene 17)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William's army chases Conan from [[Dol de Bretagne]] to [[Rennes]], and Conan finally surrenders at [[Battle of Dinan|Dinan]].&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#20|(scene 20)]]&lt;/sup&gt; William gives Harold arms and armour (possibly [[knight]]ing him) and Harold takes an oath on [[saint]]ly [[relic]]s.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#23|(scene 23)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Although the writing on the tapestry explicitly states an oath is taken there is no clue as to what is being promised.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

Harold leaves for home and meets again with the old king Edward, who appears to be remonstrating with him.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#25|(scene 25)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Harold is in a somewhat submissive posture and seems to be in disgrace.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; However, possibly deliberately, the king's intentions are not made clear.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; The scene then shifts by about one year to when Edward has become mortally ill and the tapestry strongly suggests that, on his deathbed, he bequeaths the crown to Harold.&lt;ref group=note&gt;5 January 1066.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; What is probably the [[coronation]] ceremony&lt;ref group=note&gt;6 January 1066.&lt;/ref&gt; is attended by [[Stigand]], whose position as Archbishop of Canterbury was controversial.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#31|(scene 31)]]&lt;/sup&gt; Stigand is performing a liturgical function, possibly not the crowning itself.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The tapestry labels the celebrant as "Stigant Archieps" (Stigand the archbishop) although by that time he had been [[excommunication|excommunicated]] by the [[papacy]] who considered his appointment unlawful.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

[[File:Comete Tapisserie Bayeux.jpg|thumb|left|Detail of [[Comet Halley|comet]]]]
A star with a streaming tail, probably [[Halley's Comet]], then appears.&lt;ref group=note&gt; A comet was believed to be a bad omen at this time and Halley's comet would have first appeared in 1066 around 24 April, nearly four months after Harold's coronation.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, the lower border of the tapestry shows a fleet of ghost-like ships thus hinting at a future invasion.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#33|(scene 33)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The news of Harold's coronation is taken to Normandy, whereupon we are told that William is ordering a fleet of ships to be built although it is Bishop Odo shown issuing the instructions.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#35|(scene 35)]]&lt;/sup&gt; The invaders reach England, and land unopposed. William orders his men to find food, and a meal is cooked.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#43|(scene 43)]]&lt;/sup&gt; A house is burnt by two soldiers, which may indicate some ravaging of the local countryside on the part of the invaders, and underneath, on a smaller scale than the arsonists, a woman holds her boy's hand as she asks for humanity.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#47|(scene 47)]]&lt;/sup&gt; News is brought to William.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Possibly about Harold's victory in the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]], although the Tapestry does not specify this.&lt;/ref&gt; The Normans build a [[motte and bailey]] at Hastings to defend their position. Messengers are sent between the two armies, and William makes a speech to prepare his army for battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#51|(scene 51)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

[[File:Normans Bayeux.jpg|thumb|right|[[Battle of Hastings]]]]
The [[Battle of Hastings]] was fought on 14 October 1066 less than three weeks after the [[Battle of Stamford Bridge]] but the tapestry does not provide this context. The English fight on foot behind a [[shield wall]], whilst the Normans are on horses.&lt;ref group=note&gt;This reflected the military reality.&lt;/ref&gt; Two fallen knights are named as [[Leofwine Godwinson|Leofwine]] and [[Gyrth Godwinson|Gyrth]], Harold's brothers, but both armies are shown fighting bravely.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; Bishop Odo brandishes his baton or mace and rallies the Norman troops in battle.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#54|(scene 54)]]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Clerics were not supposed to shed blood, hence Odo has no sword. Rather than just praying for the Norman knights, however, which ought to have been his role, Odo seems militarily active.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt; To reassure his knights that he is still alive and well, William raises his helmet to show his face.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The battle becomes very bloody with troops being slaughtered and dismembered corpses littering the ground. King Harold is killed.&lt;sup&gt;[[Bayeux Tapestry tituli#57|(scene 57)]]&lt;/sup&gt; This scene can be interpreted in different ways, as the name "Harold" appears above a number of knights, making it difficult to identify which character is Harold, since one character appears with an arrow shot in his head under the name "Harold" while another character is slain by a sword underneath the words "he is slain". The final remaining scene shows unarmoured English troops fleeing the battlefield. The last part of the tapestry is missing but it is thought that the story contained only one additional scene.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

== Latin text ==
{{Main article|Bayeux Tapestry tituli}}

''[[Tituli]]'' are included in many scenes to point out names of people and places or to explain briefly the event being depicted.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The text is in Latin but at times the style of words and spelling shows an English influence.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A dark blue wool, almost black, is mostly used but towards the end of the tapestry other colours are used, sometimes for each word and other times for each letter.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; The complete text and English translation are displayed beside images of each scene at [[Bayeux Tapestry tituli]].

== Recorded history ==
The first reference to the tapestry is from 1476 when it was listed in an inventory of the treasures of Bayeux Cathedral. It survived the sack of Bayeux by the [[Huguenots]] in 1562; and the next certain reference is from 1724.&lt;ref name=musset&gt;{{cite book|last=Musset|first=Lucien|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=2005|publisher=Boydell Press|isbn=1-84383-163-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine Lancelot sent a report to the ''Académie Royale des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres'' concerning a sketch he had received about a work concerning William the Conqueror. He had no idea where or what the original was, although he suggested it could have been a tapestry.&lt;ref name=stenton&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertrand|first=Simone|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=1965|publisher=Phaedon Press|chapter=The History of the Tapestry|editor=Frank Stenton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite further enquiries he discovered no more.

[[File:MontfauconHaroldEye.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard de Montfaucon|Montfaucon]] / Benoît drawing showing Harold's death]]

The Benedictine scholar [[Bernard de Montfaucon]] made more successful investigations and found that the sketch was of a small portion of a tapestry preserved at Bayeux Cathedral. In 1729 and 1730 he published drawings and a detailed description of the complete work in the first two volumes of his ''Les Monuments de la Monarchie française''. The drawings were by [[Antoine Benoît]], one of the ablest draughtsmen of that time.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

The tapestry was first briefly noted in English in 1743 by [[William Stukeley]], in his ''Palaeographia Britannica''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; The first detailed account in English was written by [[Smart Lethieullier]], who was living in Paris in 1732–3, and was acquainted with Lancelot and de Montfaucon: it was not published, however, until 1767, as an appendix to [[Andrew Ducarel]]'s ''Anglo-Norman Antiquities''.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[French Revolution]], in 1792, the tapestry was confiscated as public property to be used for covering military wagons.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It was rescued from a wagon by a local lawyer who stored it in his house until the troubles were over, whereupon he sent it to the city administrators for safekeeping.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; After [[Reign of Terror|the Terror]] the Fine Arts Commission, set up to safeguard national treasures in 1803, required it to be removed to Paris for display at the [[Musée Napoléon]].&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; When [[Napoleon]] abandoned his planned invasion of Britain the tapestry's propaganda value was lost and it was returned to Bayeux where the council displayed it on a winding apparatus of two cylinders.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; Despite scholars' concern that the tapestry was becoming damaged the council refused to return it to the Cathedral.&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt;

In 1816 the [[Society of Antiquaries of London]] commissioned its historical draughtsman, [[Charles Alfred Stothard|Charles Stothard]], to visit Bayeux to make an accurate hand-coloured [[facsimile]] of the tapestry. His drawings were subsequently engraved by [[James Basire]] jr. and published by the Society in 1819–23.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Stothard's images are still of value as a record of the tapestry as it was before 19th-century restoration.

By 1842 the tapestry was displayed in a special-purpose room in the Bibliothèque Publique. It required special storage in 1870 with the threatened invasion of Normandy in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and again in 1939–1944 by the [[Ahnenerbe]] during the [[German occupation of France during World War II|German Occupation of France]] and the [[Normandy landings]]. On 27 June 1944 the [[Gestapo]] took the tapestry to the [[Louvre]] and on 18 August, three days before the [[Wehrmacht]] withdrew from Paris, [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] sent a message (intercepted by [[Government Code and Cypher School|Bletchley Park]]) ordering it to be taken to "a place of safety", thought to be Berlin.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It was only on 22 August that the [[SS]] attempted to take possession of the tapestry by which time the Louvre was again in French hands.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; After the [[liberation of Paris]], on 25 August, the tapestry was again put on public display in the Louvre, and in 1945 it was returned to Bayeux&lt;ref name=stenton /&gt; where it is exhibited at the Musée de la Tapisserie de Bayeux.

== Later reputation ==
The inventory listing of 1476 shows that the tapestry was being hung annually in Bayeux Cathedral for the week of the [[Nativity of St. John the Baptist|Feast of St. John the Baptist]]; and this was still the case in 1728, although by that time the purpose was merely to air the hanging, which was otherwise stored in a chest.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; Clearly, the work was being well cared for. In the eighteenth century, the artistry was regarded as crude or even barbarous—red and yellow multi-coloured horses upset some critics. It was thought to be unfinished because the linen was not covered with embroidery.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; However, its exhibition in the Louvre in 1797 caused a sensation, with ''[[Le Moniteur Universel|Le Moniteur]]'', which normally dealt with foreign affairs, reporting on it on its first two pages.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; It inspired a popular musical, ''La Tapisserie de la Reine Mathilde''. It was because the tapestry was regarded as an antiquity rather than a work of art that in 1804 it was returned to Bayeux, wherein 1823 one commentator, A. L. Léchaudé d'Anisy, reported that "there is a sort of purity in its primitive forms, especially considering the state of the arts in the eleventh century".&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

The tapestry was becoming a tourist attraction, with [[Robert Southey]] complaining of the need to queue to see the work. In the 1843 ''Hand-book for Travellers in France'' by [[John Murray III]], a visit was included on "Recommended Route 26 (Caen to Cherbourg via Bayeux)", and this guidebook led [[John Ruskin]] to go there; he would describe the tapestry as "the most interesting thing in its way conceivable". [[Charles Dickens]], however, was not impressed: "It is certainly the work of amateurs; very feeble amateurs at the beginning and very heedless some of them too."&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

During the Second World War [[Heinrich Himmler]] coveted the work, regarding it as "important for our glorious and cultured Germanic history".&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt;

== Mysteries ==
[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene57 Harold death.jpg|thumb|Harold's death. Legend above: ''Harold rex interfectus est'', "King Harold is killed"]]
[[File:Harold arrow, Bayeux tapestry detail.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of arrow]]
[[File:Aelfgyva.jpg|thumb|''Ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva'']]

The depiction of events on the tapestry raises several mysteries:
* The identification of [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II of England]] in the vignette depicting his death is disputed. Some recent historians disagree with the traditional view that Harold is the figure struck in the eye with an arrow. The view that it is Harold is supported by the fact that the words ''Harold Rex'' (King Harold) appear right above the figure's head. However, the arrow is a later addition following a period of repair,&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; as can be seen by comparison with [[Bernard de Montfaucon]]'s engravings of the tapestry as it was in 1729, in which the arrow is absent (see illustration above). However, needle holes in the linen do suggest that something had originally been in the place of the arrow, though it may have been a lance rather than an arrow.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; A figure is slain with a sword in the subsequent plate, and the phrase above the figure refers to Harold's death (''interfectus est'', "he is slain"). This would appear to be more consistent with the labeling used elsewhere in the work. It was common medieval [[iconography]] that a [[perjurer]] was to die with a weapon through the eye. Therefore, the tapestry might be said to emphasize William's rightful claim to the throne by depicting Harold as an oath breaker. Whether he actually died in this way remains a mystery and is much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Foys|first=Martin|title=Pulling the Arrow Out: The Legend of Harold's Death and the Bayeux Tapestry|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Woodbridge, UK|year=2009|pages=158–75|isbn=978-1-84383-470-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There is a panel with what appears to be a [[clergy]]man touching or possibly striking a woman's face. No one knows the significance of this scene or the caption above it: ''ubi unus clericus et Ælfgyva'' ("where [or ''in which''] a certain cleric and Ælfgyva"), where Ælfgyva is the Latinised spelling of [[Ælfgifu]], a popular Anglo-Saxon woman's name (literally "elf-gift").&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The use of the [[grapheme]] [[Æ]] shows familiarity with English spelling.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; There are two naked male figures in the border below this figure; the one directly below the figure is squatting and displaying [[genitalia]], a scene that was frequently censored in former reproductions. However, similar naked figures appear elsewhere in the lower border where there seems to be no connection at all with the main action.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Harold had a younger sister named Ælfgifu (her name is spelt Alveva in the [[Domesday book]]) who was possibly promised to William by Harold or even betrothed to him, but she died c. 1066, prior to the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mason |first=Emma |title=The House of Godwine: the history of a dynasty |place=London |publisher=Hambledon and London |year=2004 |isbn=1852853891 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* At least two panels of the tapestry are missing, perhaps even another {{convert|6.4|m|yd|abbr=on}} in total. This missing area may have included William's coronation.&lt;ref name=hicks/&gt;

== Reliability ==
The Bayeux Tapestry was probably commissioned by the [[House of Normandy]] and essentially depicts a Norman viewpoint. However, Harold is shown as brave, and his soldiers are not belittled. Throughout, William is described as ''dux'' ("duke"), whereas Harold, also called ''dux'' up to his coronation, is subsequently called ''rex'' ("king").&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; The fact that the narrative extensively covers Harold's activities in Normandy (in 1064) indicates that the intention was to show a strong relationship between that expedition and the Norman Conquest starting two years later. It is for this reason that the tapestry is generally seen by modern scholars as an [[apologia]] for the Norman Conquest.

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene29-30-31 Harold coronation.jpg|thumb|[[Coronation]] of Harold]]
The tapestry's narration seems to place stress on Harold's oath to William, although its rationale is not made clear.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Norman sources claim that the English succession was being pledged to William, but English sources give varied accounts.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; Today it is thought that the Norman sources are to be preferred.&lt;ref name=bates&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Bates, David | publisher = Oxford University Press | encyclopedia= Oxford Dictionary of National Biography | title= William I  | year = 2004 | url = http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/29448?docPos=2 |doi= 10.1093/ref:odnb/29448 }} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the tapestry and Norman sources&lt;ref name=poitiers&gt;William of Poitiers: ''Gesta Willelmi ducis Normannorum et regis Anglorum'', c.1071.

Contemporary scholarship has not decided the matter, although it is generally thought that Ealdred performed the coronation.&lt;ref name=gibbs&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibbs-Smith|first=Charles|title=The Bayeux Tapestry|year=1965|publisher=Phaedon Press|chapter=Notes on the Plates|editor=Frank Stenton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cowdrey&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Cowdrey, H.

Although political propaganda or personal emphasis may have somewhat distorted the historical accuracy of the story, the Bayeux Tapestry constitutes a visual record of medieval arms, apparel, and other objects unlike any other artifact surviving from this period. There is no attempt at continuity between scenes, either in individuals' appearance or clothing. The knights carry shields, but show no system of hereditary [[coats of arms]]—the beginnings of modern heraldic structure were in place, but would not become standard until the middle of the 12th century.&lt;ref name=musset /&gt; It has been noted that the warriors are depicted fighting with bare hands, while other sources indicate the general use of gloves in battle and hunt.

== Artistic context ==
Tapestry fragments have been found in Scandinavia dating from the ninth century and it is thought that Norman and Anglo-Saxon embroidery developed from this sort of work. Examples are to be found in the [[Oseberg ship#Grave goods|grave goods of the Oseberg ship]] and the [[Överhogdal tapestries]].&lt;ref name=musset/&gt;

A monastic text from [[Ely, Cambridgeshire|Ely]], the ''[[Liber Eliensis]]'', mentions a woven narrative wall-hanging commemorating the deeds of [[Byrhtnoth]], killed in 991. Wall-hangings were common by the tenth century with English and Norman texts particularly commending the skill of Anglo-Saxon seamstresses. Mural paintings imitating draperies still exist in France and Italy and there are twelfth-century mentions of other wall-hangings in Normandy and France. A poem by [[Baldric of Dol]] might even describe the Bayeux Tapestry itself.&lt;ref name=musset/&gt; The Bayeux Tapestry was therefore not unique at the time it was created: rather it is remarkable for being the sole surviving example of medieval narrative needlework.&lt;ref name=digby&gt;{{cite book |last=Wingfield Digby|first=George |title=The Bayeux Tapestry |year=1965 |edition=2nd |publisher=Phaidon Press|chapter=Technique and Production|editor-first=Frank |editor-last=Stenton |editor-link=Frank Stenton |pages=37–55 (37, 45–48) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bayeux Tapestry replica in Reading Museum.jpg|thumb|Start of the Bayeux Tapestry replica in [[Reading Museum]]]]
A number of replicas of the Bayeux Tapestry have been created. Through the collaboration of [[William Morris]] with textile manufacturer [[Thomas Wardle (industrialist)|Thomas Wardle]], Wardle's wife [[Elizabeth Wardle|Elizabeth]], who was an accomplished seamstress, embarked on creating a reproduction in 1885.&lt;ref name=hicks /&gt; She organised some 37 women in her ''Leek School of Art Embroidery''&lt;ref group=note&gt;See [[Leek, Staffordshire]] and [[Art needlework]].&lt;/ref&gt; to collaborate working from a full-scale water-colour facsimile drawing provided by the [[South Kensington Museum]].

Dr. E. D. Wheeler, former judge and former dean at [[Oglethorpe University]], commissioned a hand-painted, full-size replica of the Bayeux Tapestry and donated it to the [[University of West Georgia]] in [[Carrollton, Georgia|Carrollton]] in 1994. In 2014, the replica was acquired by the [[University of North Georgia]] in [[Dahlonega, Georgia|Dahlonega]].

Jason Welch, a woodcarver from [[North Creake]], Norfolk, England, created a replica of the Tapestry between 2011 and 2014 in carved and painted wooden relief on 25 five-foot planks. He undertook the project to help cope with the grief of losing his 16-year-old son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Hall |title=Grandfather hand-carved 230 FOOT wooden scale model of Bayeux Tapestry to help get over the death of his teenage son (despite missing three fingers on his left hand) |newspaper=Mail Online |date=12 January 2014 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2538110/Grandfather-hand-carved-230FOOT-wooden-scale-model-Bayeux-Tapestry-help-death-teenage-son-despite-missing-three-fingers-left-hand.html |accessdate=11 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other modern artists have attempted to complete the work by creating panels depicting subsequent events up to William's coronation, though the actual content of the missing panels is unknown.

== In popular culture ==
[[Image:Street art in Bayeux about tapestry.jpg|upright|thumb|Street art in Bayeux referring to the Tapestry]]
Because it resembles a modern [[comic strip]] or movie [[storyboard]], is widely recognised, and is so distinctive in its artistic style, the Bayeux Tapestry has frequently been used or reimagined in a variety of different popular culture contexts. George Wingfield Digby wrote in 1957:
{{quote|It was designed to tell a story to a largely illiterate public; it is like a strip cartoon, racy, emphatic, colourful, with a good deal of blood and thunder and some ribaldry.&lt;ref&gt;Wingfield Digby, "Technique and Production", p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It has been cited by [[Scott McCloud]] in ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' as an example of early [[Sequential art|sequential-narrative art]];&lt;ref&gt;McCloud 1993. ''[[Understanding Comics]]'' pp. 11–14&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryan Talbot]], a British comic book artist, has called it "the first known [[History of the British comic|British comic strip]]".&lt;ref&gt;The History of the British Comic, [[Bryan Talbot]], ''[[The Guardian]] Guide'', 8 September 2007, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has inspired many modern [[Editorial cartoon|political]] and other [[cartoon]]s, including:
* [[John Hassall (illustrator)|John Hassall]]'s satirical pastiche ''Ye Berlyn Tapestrie'', published in 1915, which tells the story of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Hassall |authorlink=John Hassall (illustrator) |title=Ye Berlyn Tapestrie |origyear=1915 |year=2014 |place=Oxford |publisher=Bodleian Library |isbn=978-1-85124-416-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rea Irvin]]'s cover for the ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' magazine of 15 July 1944 marking [[Normandy landings|D-Day]]&lt;ref name="newyorker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=1944-07-15#folio=CV1 |title=The New Yorker |publisher=Condé Nast |date=15 July 1944 | accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[George Gale (cartoonist)|George Gale]]'s pastiche chronicling the saga leading up to Britain's entry into the [[European Economic Community]], published across six pages in ''[[The Times]]'''s "Europa" supplement on 1 January 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/george_gale_1_665795 |first=Alasdair |last=Steven |title=George Gale: Obituary |newspaper=The Scotsman |date=24 September 2003 |accessdate=3 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapestry has also inspired modern embroideries, notably:
* The [[Overlord embroidery]] commemorating the [[D-Day|Normandy landings]] invasion, now at [[Portsmouth]]
* The [[Prestonpans Tapestry]], which chronicles the events surrounding the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] in 1745

A number of films have used sections of the tapestry in their opening credits or closing titles, including [[Disney]]'s ''[[Bedknobs and Broomsticks]]'', Anthony Mann's ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'', Franco Zeffirelli's ''[[Hamlet]]'', Frank Cassenti's ''[[La Chanson de Roland]]'', Kevin Reynolds' ''[[Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves]]'', and Richard Fleischer's ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Re-embroidering the Bayeux Tapestry in Film and Media: The Flip Side of History in Opening and End Title Sequences | publisher = Richard Burt, University of Florida | date = 18 August 2007 | url = http://www.clas.ufl.edu/~rburt/middleagesonfilm/bayeux1.html | accessdate = 31 August 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908114843/http://www.english.ufl.edu/exemplaria/movie/RBBT.pdf | archivedate=8 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design and embroidery of the tapestry form one of the narrative strands of [[Marta Morazzoni]]'s 1988 novella ''The Invention of Truth''.

The tapestry is referred to in [[Tony Kushner]]'s play ''[[Angels in America: A Gay Fantasia on National Themes|Angels in America]]''. The apocryphal account of Queen Matilda's creation of the tapestry is used, perhaps in order to demonstrate that Louis, one of the main characters, holds himself to mythological standards.&lt;ref name="sparknote_angels"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/angels/section3.rhtml | title=SparkNote on Angels in America | publisher=SparkNotes LLC | work=SparkNotes.com | accessdate=30 October 2014 | author=SparkNotes Editors | quote=Louis's problem is exacerbated by his tendency towards abstraction and his unreasonably high standards for himself. In Scene Three, he tells Emily about La Reine Mathilde, who supposedly created the Bayeux Tapestry. Louis describes La Reine's unceasing devotion to William the Conqueror and laments his own comparative lack of devotion. But as critic Allen J. Frantzen has pointed out, this popular story about Mathilde and the tapestry is wrong—it was actually created in England decades after the conquest. Louis, then, is holding himself to a mythological standard of loyalty, and he curses himself based on a positively unreal example. This is part of a larger pattern of excessive guilt and harshness toward himself, which, paradoxically, prevents him from judging his own weaknesses accurately and trying to correct them. Because no one could possibly live up to Mathilde's example, Louis initially justifies his moral failure. Later, in Perestroika, he will arrive at a more genuine remorse and an honest understanding of what he has done.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ulster Museum]] in [[Northern Ireland]] currently hosts a ''[[Game of Thrones]]'' tapestry inspired by the Bayeux tapestry, depicting the events of the television show.

'''Benjamin Ives Gilman''' (1852–1933) was the Secretary of the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]] from 1893 to 1925.

Benjamin Ives Gilman was born in New York in 1852, the son of [[Winthrop Sargent Gilman]] and the former Abia Swift Lippincott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Searches Into the History of the Gillman Or Gilman Family |author=Alexander William Gillman,  Gillman |year=1895 |publisher=E.

He then joined his family’s banking business. In 1880 he received a Masters from Williams and the next year he entered the Ph.D. program at [[Johns Hopkins University]] as a philosophy student, focusing on mathematics and logic. He studied with [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], one of the founders of modern mathematical logic. As "B.I. Gilman" he authored a paper published in Peirce's 1883 ''Studies in Logic''.

Gilman left Johns Hopkins after one year to study in Germany, and did not return, citing health reasons.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} He became a student of [[William James]] at the Philosophy Department of [[Harvard University]], enrolling there 1883-1885, and specializing in aesthetics, and especially the aesthetics of music. Between 1890 and 1892, he taught courses in the psychology of music at [[Colorado College]], Harvard,&lt;ref&gt;Harvard University.

He also wrote on Chinese music, visiting New York's Chinatown to make recordings. His [https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2015/04/honoring-vernacular-sounds/ recordings] of music from  Fijian, Samoan, Uvean, Javanese, Turkish and other performers at the Columbian Exposition are at the Library of Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Ives Gilman, Jesse Walter Fewkes, and Hemenway Southwestern Archaeological Expedition, Zuni Melodies (Boston: Houghton, Mifflin and Co., 1891), 68; Benjamin Ives Gilman, “On Some Psychological Aspects of the Chinese Musical System,” The Philosophical Review 1, no. 1 (1892): 54–78.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1892 Gilman became an instructor in [[psychology]] at [[Clark University]]. There he taught a course on the Psychology of Pain and Pleasure.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Ives Gilman, “Syllabus of Lectures on the Psychology of Pain and Pleasure,” The American Journal of Psychology 6, no. 1 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893 Gilman was hired as Curator and Librarian at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, where he would work for his entire career. He held a variety of titles, including curator (1893-1894?); Librarian (1893-1904); Assistant Director, 1901-1903); and Temporary Director (1907); but for almost the entire time he had the title Secretary (1894-1925), with responsibility for publications and advising the Director and the Board. In his remarks to the board and in his publications he would urge art museums to display masterpieces of art, not reproductions, and make it easy for the visitor to engage with them; to consider the visitor's comfort (he coined the term "[[museum fatigue]]"); and to focus on aesthetics, not on art history. He also introduced docents to the museum, coining that word. His major publication ''Museum Ideals of Purpose and Method'' (1918) is an extended argument for this idea of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lubar|first1=Steven|title=Looking through the Skiascope: Benjamin Gilman and the Invention of the Modern Museum Gallery|journal=Panorama|date=Summer 2017|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://journalpanorama.org/looking-through-the-skiascope-benjamin-gilman-and-the-invention-of-the-modern-museum-gallery/|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Best Current Practice''' ('''BCP''')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1818|title=Best Current Practices |publisher=ietf.org |accessdate=2015-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a ''de facto'' level of performance in engineering and information technology. It is more flexible than a [[Technical standard|standard]], since techniques and tools are continually evolving.

The [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] publishes Best Current Practice documents in a numbered document series.  Each document in this series is paired with the currently valid [[Request for Comments]] (RFC) document. BCP was introduced in [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1818 RFC-1818].

BCPs are document guidelines, processes, methods, and other matters not suitable for standardization. The [[Internet standard#Standardization process|Internet standards process]] itself is defined in a series of BCPs, as is the formal organizational structure of the IETF, [[Internet Engineering Steering Group]], [[Internet Architecture Board]], and other groups involved in that process.  

IETF's separate [[Internet Standard |Standard Track]] (STD) document series defines the fully standardized network protocols of the Internet, such as the [[Internet Protocol]], the [[Transmission Control Protocol]], and the [[Domain Name System]].

Each RFC number refers to a specific version of a document Standard Track, but the BCP number refers to the most recent revision of the document. Thus, citations often reference both the BCP number and the RFC number.

Example citations for BCPs are: [[BCP 38]], [[RFC 2827]].

'''Bibliotheca Corviniana''' was one of the most renowned libraries of the [[Renaissance]] world, established by [[Matthias Corvinus]], King of [[Hungary]], in [[Buda Castle]] between 1458 and 1490. It was destroyed after the Hungarian defeat by the Ottomans in the [[Battle of Mohács]] in 1526.

==History==
Matthias, one of the most powerful rulers of the age, started to collect the books from about 1460. At the king's death in 1490, the library consisted of about 3,000 [[codices]] or "Corvinae" which included about four to five thousand various works, many of classical Greek and Latin authors. It represented the literary production and reflected the state of knowledge and arts of the [[Renaissance]] and included works of philosophy, theology, history, law, literature, geography, natural sciences, medicine, architecture, and many others. The [[Ottoman Hungary| Turkish invasion of Hungary]] in the 16th century destroyed the codices.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Landrus, ''Leonardo Da Vinci's Giant Crossbow'', (Springer Verlag, 2010), 49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Alfred Burns, ''The Power of the Written Word: The Role of Literacy in the History of Western Civilization'', (Peter Lang, 1989), 228.&lt;/ref&gt; Only about 216 Corvinae survived, today preserved in several libraries in Hungary and Europe.

North of the Alps, Matthias' library was the largest in Europe, and its vast contents was only second to the [[Vatican Library]] in the whole of Europe, according to contemporary accounts. It was the greatest collection of science writings in its time. In 1489, [[Bartolomeo della Fonte]] of [[Florence]] wrote that [[Lorenzo de Medici]] founded his own Greek-Latin library encouraged by the example of the Hungarian king.

Nearly two thirds of the surviving volumes had not been printed before the king's death. Some of them contained the sole copy of the works in them, like the book of [[Constantine Porphyrogennetos]] on the habits in the court of the Byzantine emperor, or the church history of [[Nikephoros Kallistos Xanthopoulos|Nikephoros Kallistos]]. Some lost Corvinae works are also known, with which the only copy of ancient books perished, including the full works of [[Hypereides]], and writings by [[Flavius Cresconius Corippus]], [[Cuspinianus]] and [[Procopius]].

Hungary's [[National Széchényi Library]] is working on projects to restore the Corvina library in digital form.

Items from the Bibliotheca Corviniana were inscribed on [[UNESCO]]’s [[Memory of the World Register]] in 2005 in recognition of their historical significance.&lt;ref name=mow&gt;{{Cite web |title= The Bibliotheca Corviniana Collection |url= http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23277&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20151117161250/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=23277&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2015-11-17 |date= 2009-08-12 |publisher= UNESCO Memory of the World Programme |accessdate= 2009-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Báb''', born '''Siyyid `Alí Muhammad Shírází''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|eɪ|j|ə|d|_|ˈ|æ|l|i|_|m|oʊ|ˈ|h|æ|m|ə|d|_|ʃ|ɪ|ˈ|r|ɑː|z|i}}; {{lang-fa|سيد علی ‌محمد شیرازی}}; October 20, 1819 – July 9, 1850) was the founder of [[Bábism]], and one of the central figures of the [[Bahá'í Faith]].

The Báb was a merchant from [[Shiraz]] in [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]] who in 1844, at the age of twenty-four, claimed to be a messenger of God. He took on the title of the ''Báb'' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɑː|b}}; {{lang-ar|باب}}), meaning "Gate" or "Door", a reference associated with the promised Twelver [[Mahdi]] or [[Al-Qa'im (person)|al-Qá'im]]. He faced opposition from the Persian government, which eventually executed him and thousands of his followers, who were known as Bábís.

The Báb composed numerous letters and books in which he stated his claims and defined his teachings. He introduced the idea of [[He whom God shall make manifest]], a messianic figure who would bring a greater message than his own.&lt;ref name="buck_eschatologic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Modern Religions, Religious Movements and the Bābī-Bahā'ī Faiths |editor=Sharon, Moshe |chapter=The eschatology of Globalization: The multiple-messiahship of Bahā'u'llāh revisited |first=Christopher |last=Buck |isbn=90-04-13904-4 |pages=143–178 |location=Boston |publisher=Brill |year=2004 |url=http://bahai-library.com/buck_eschatology_globalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]], the  Báb fills a similar role as [[Elijah]] or [[John the Baptist]]; a predecessor or forerunner who paved the way for their own religion. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, was a follower of the Báb and claimed in 1863 to be the fulfillment of the Báb's prophecy, 13 years after the former's death.

==Life==

===Early life===
[[File:Bab-calligraphic-exercise.jpg|left|thumb|Calligraphic exercise of the Báb written before ten years old.]]
The Bab was born on October 20, 1819 (1 Muharram 1235 [[Hijri year|AH]]) in [[Shiraz]] to a middle-class [[merchant]] of the city and given the name Ali Muhammad. His father was Muhammad Ridá, and his mother was Fátimih (1800–1881), a daughter of a prominent merchant in Shiraz. She later became a Bahá'í. He was orphaned when his father died while he was quite young and his maternal uncle [[Seven Martyrs of Tehran#Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí|Hájí Mírzá Siyyid `Alí]], a merchant, raised him.&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Islam |year= 1999 |article= Bāb |publisher= Koninklijke Brill NV |location= Leiden, The Netherlands |first= A. |last= Bausani}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balyuzi"&gt;{{cite book |last= Balyuzi |first= H.M. |authorlink= Hasan M.

He did not even answer our questions. He was constantly absorbed in his own thoughts, and was preoccupied with repetition of his prayers and verses. He is described as a handsome man with a thin beard, dressed in clean clothes, wearing a green shawl and a black turban."&lt;ref&gt;Hajji Muhammad Husayn, quoted in {{cite book |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |title=Resurrection and Renewal: The making of the Babi Movement in Iran, 1844–1850 |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1989 |pages=132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An English physician described the young man by saying: "He was a very mild and delicate-looking man, rather small in stature and very fair for a Persian, with a melodious soft voice, which struck me much".&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Balyuzi, ''The Bab – The Herald of the Day of Days'', p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage===
In 1842 he married [[Khadíjih-Bagum]] (1822–1882); he was 23 and she was 20.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; She was the daughter of a prominent merchant in Shíráz. The marriage proved a happy one,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;H.M. Balyuzi, ''Khadijih Bagum – Wife of the Bab''&lt;/ref&gt; and they had one child, a boy named Ahmad who died the year he was born - 1843.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The pregnancy jeopardized Khadijih's life and she never conceived again. The young couple occupied a modest house in Shiraz along with the Báb's mother. Later, Khadijih became a Bahá'í.

===The Shaykhi movement===
In the 1790s in Persia, [[Shaykh Ahmad]] (1753–1826) began a religious movement within Twelver [[Shia Islam]]. His followers, who became known as [[Shaykhism|Shaykhis]], were expecting the imminent appearance of the ''al-Qa'im'' of the [[Ahl al-Bayt]] also called "the Mahdi". After the death of Shaykh Ahmad, leadership was passed on to [[Kazim Rashti]] (1793–1843).

In 1841 the Báb went on pilgrimage to [[Iraq]], and for seven months stayed mostly in and around [[Karbala]].&lt;ref&gt;Balyuzi, H.M. (1973). The Báb: The Herald of the Day of Days. Oxford, UK: George Ronald. p. 41. {{ISBN|0-85398-048-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There he may have met Kazim Rashti, who showed a high regard for him.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt; He is believed to have attended some of Kazim Rashti's lectures; however, this period is almost entirely undocumented.&lt;ref name = "iranica_bab" /&gt;

As of his death in December 1843, Kazim Rashti counselled his followers to leave their homes to seek the Mahdi, who, according to his prophecies, would soon appear.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt; One of these followers, [[Mullá Husayn]], after keeping vigil for forty days in a [[mosque]], travelled to Shiraz, where he met the Báb.&lt;ref name="balyuzi13"&gt;Balyuzi, pp. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration to Mullá Husayn===

[[File:Room-bab.jpg|thumb|left|The room where the Declaration of the Báb took place on the evening of 22 May 1844, in his house in [[Shiraz]].]]
The Báb's first religious inspiration experience claimed, and witnessed by his wife, is dated to about the evening of 3 April 1844.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Mirza Habibu'llah Afnan |author2=trans. by Ahang Rabbani |title=The Genesis of the Bâbí-Bahá'í Faiths in Shíráz and Fárs |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0xKgJI7wBv0C&amp;pg=PA22 |year=2008 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=90-04-17054-5 |pages=20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Báb's first public connection with his sense of a mission came with the arrival of Mullá Husayn in Shiraz. On the night of 22 May  Mullá Husayn was invited by the Báb to his home where Mullá Husayn told him of his search for the possible successor to Kazim Rashti, the Promised One. The Báb claimed this, and the bearer of divine knowledge.&lt;ref name= "iranica_bab" /&gt; Mullá Husayn became the first to accept the Báb's claims to be an inspired figure and a likely successor to Kazim Rashti.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "iranica_bab" /&gt; The Báb had replied satisfactorily to all of Mullá Husayn's questions and had written in his presence, with extreme rapidity, a long [[tafsir]], commentary, on [[surah]] "[[Yusuf (surah)|Yusuf]]", known as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']] and considered the Báb's first revealed work.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt;

===Letters of the Living===
Mullá Husayn became the Báb's first disciple. Within five months, seventeen other disciples of Kazim Rashti recognized the Báb as a Manifestation of God.&lt;ref name="BBCHistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Time of the Báb |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/bahai/history/bab_2.shtml |publisher=BBC |accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, one woman, Fátimih Zarrín Táj Bara&lt;u&gt;gh&lt;/u&gt;áni, a poet, who later received the name of [[Táhirih]], the Pure. These 18 disciples later became known as the [[Letters of the Living]] (each soul containing one letter of the Spirit of God, which combine to form the Word) and given the task of spreading the new faith (understood as the return or continuation of the one Faith of Abraham) across Iran and Iraq.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; The Báb emphasized the spiritual station of these 18 individuals, who, along with himself, made the first "Unity" of his religion&lt;ref name="amanat191"&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 191.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the Arabic term ''wāhid'', unity, that has a numerical value of 19 using [[abjad numerals]]. The Báb's book, the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', gives the metaphorical identity of the Letters of the Living as [[the Fourteen Infallibles]] of Twelver Shi'i Islam: [[Muhammad]], [[the Twelve Imams]], and [[Fatimah]], and the four [[archangel]]s.&lt;ref name="amanat191" /&gt; Paralleling the [[Twelve Apostles|first followers of Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Moojan |last=Momen |title=Bahá’u’lláh’s prophetology: archetypal patterns in the lives of the founders of the world religions |volume=5 |issue=1 |year=1995 |journal=Bahá'í Studies Review |url=http://bahai-library.com/momen_prophetology_archetypes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proclamation===
In his early writings, the Báb appears to identify himself as the gate (''báb'') to the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Hidden Twelfth Imam]], and later begins explicitly to proclaim his station as that of the Hidden Imam and a new messenger from God.&lt;ref name="saiedi19"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gate of the Heart |first=Nader |last=Saiedi |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, ON |pages=19 |isbn=978-1-55458-035-4 |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than being a discontinued or evolving consciousness, Saiedi states that the works of the Báb are unitary throughout, and that the gradual disclosure of the Báb's identity is defined by the principle of unity in diversity.&lt;ref name="saiedi19" /&gt;

[[File:Masjidivakil2008.JPG|thumb|left|250px|The Báb stood on this pulpit in the Masjid-i-Vakíl, addressing the populace of Shiraz in September 1846]]
In the Báb's early writings, the exalted identity he was claiming was unmistakable, but because of the reception of the people, his writings appear to convey the impression that he is only the gate to the Hidden Twelfth Imam.&lt;ref name="saiedi19" /&gt; To his circle of early believers, the Báb was equivocal about his exact status, gradually confiding in them as not merely a gate to the Hidden Imam, but the Manifestation of the Hidden Imam and the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa'im]] himself.&lt;ref name="EoA"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Resurgence of Apocalyptic in Modern Islam |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |editor=Stein, Stephen J. |title=The Encyclopedia of Apocalypticism, vol. III: Apocalypticism in the Modern Period and the Contemporary Age. |location=New York |publisher=Continuum |year=2000 |pages=241–242 |isbn=0-8264-1255-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his early meetings with Mullá Husayn, the Báb described himself as the Master and the Promised One. He did not consider himself as simply Kazim Rashti's successor, but claimed a prophetic status, a kind of deputy, delegated not just by the Hidden Imam but through Divine authority.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, Resurrection and Renewal, 171.&lt;/ref&gt; His early texts such as the [[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|"Commentary on the Surih of Joseph"]] used Quranic language that implied divine authority and identified himself effectively with the Imam.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;&lt;ref name="amanat230"&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 230-31.&lt;/ref&gt; When Mullá `Alí Basṭámí, the second Letter of the Living, was put on trial in [[Baghdad]] for preaching about the Báb, clerics studied the "Commentary on the Surih of Joseph," recognized in it a claim to divine revelation, and quoted from it in opposition to prove he had done so.&lt;ref name="amanat230" /&gt;

However, in the early phase of his declaration to the public, the title ''báb'' was emphasized as that of the gate leading to the Hidden Imam, as the Báb had told his early believers not to fully disclose his claims or reveal his name.&lt;ref name="manuchehri"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Manuchehri |first=Sepehr |title=The Practice of Taqiyyah (Dissimulation) in the Babi and Bahai Religions |journal=Research Notes in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies |year=1999 |volume=3 |issue=3 |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol3/taqiya.htm |accessdate=September 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of laying claim to a lower position was intended to create a sense of anticipation for the appearance of the Hidden Imam, as well to avoid persecution and imprisonment, because a public proclamation of [[mahdi]] status could bring a swift penalty of death.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt;  After a couple of months, as the Báb observed further acceptance and readiness among his believers and the public, he gradually shifted his public claim to that of the Hidden Imam.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt; Then in his final years he publicly announced his station as a [[Manifestation of God]]. In his [[#Trial|trial]], he boldly proclaimed himself, in the presence of the Heir to the Throne of [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and other notables, the Promised One.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt;&lt;ref name="trial"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Trial of the Bab: Shi'ite Orthodoxy Confronts its Mirror Image |first=Denis |last=MacEoin |journal=Occasional Papers in Shaykhi, Babi and Baha'i Studies |volume=1 |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/bhpapers/babtrial.htm |date=May 1997 |accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in his last authored work, the Haykal al-din,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEoin |first1=Denis |title=The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History: A Survey |date=1992 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed the "essence of God", dhātu’llāh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=MacEoin |first1=Denis Martin |title=The Messiah of Shiraz |date=2009 |publisher=Bril |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-17035-3 |page=345 (footnote 108)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early months of his public declarations, the adoption of a cautious policy had essentially achieved maximum attention with minimum controversy.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt;

However, the gradual unfolding of his claims caused some confusion, both among the public and for some of his believers. A number of his early followers had instantly recognized his station as a messenger from God with divine authority, and this resulted in disagreement within the Bábi community.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt;  Even though the Báb had intended to convey his message with discretion, many of his followers such as [[Táhirih]] openly declared the coming of the promised Hidden Imam and Mahdi.&lt;ref name="manuchehri" /&gt;

===Travels and imprisonment===
After the eighteen Letters of the Living recognized him, the Báb and the eighteenth Letter of the Living, [[Quddús]], left on a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]], the sacred cities of Islam.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; At the [[Kaaba]] in Mecca, the Báb publicly claimed the [[Al-Qa'im (person)|Qa'im]].,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Balyuzi|1973|pp=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote to the [[Sharif of Mecca]], the Custodian of the Kaaba, proclaiming his mission.  After their pilgrimage, the Báb and Quddús returned to [[Bushehr]], Iran.&lt;ref name="balyuzi" /&gt;

After some time, preaching by the Letters of the Living led to opposition by the Islamic clergy, prompting the Governor of Shiraz to order the Báb's arrest. The Báb, upon hearing of the arrest order, left Bushehr for Shiraz in June 1845 and presented himself to the authorities and placed under house arrest at the home of his uncle until a cholera epidemic broke out in the city in September 1846.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; Once released he departed for [[Isfahan]]. There, many came to see him at the house of the ''imam jum'a'', head of the local clergy, who became sympathetic. After an informal gathering where the Báb debated the local clergy and displayed his speed in producing instantaneous verses, his popularity soared.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 257.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of the governor of Isfahan, [[Manouchehr Khan Gorji]], his supporter, pressure from the clergy of the province led to [[Mohammad Shah Qajar]] ordering the Báb to [[Tehran]] in January 1847.&lt;ref&gt;Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 258.&lt;/ref&gt; After spending several months in a camp outside Tehran, and before the Báb could meet the Shah, the Prime Minister sent the Báb to [[Tabriz]] in the northwestern corner of the country, to his confinement.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;

[[File:Mahku2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Fortress of [[Maku, Iran]] (2008)]]
After forty days in Tabriz, the Báb transferred to the fortress of [[Maku, Iran]] in the [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|province of Azerbaijian]] close to the Turkish border. During his incarceration there, the Báb began his most important work, the ''[[Persian Bayán]]'', that he never finished. Because of the Báb's growing popularity in Maku, even the governor of Maku converting, the prime minister transferred him to the fortress of [[Chehriq]] in April 1848.&lt;ref name="EoI" /&gt; There too the Báb's popularity grew and his jailors relaxed restrictions on him. It was at this time that Áqa Bálá Big Shíshvání Naqshbandí painted the portrait of the Báb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Denis MacEoin |year=1992 |title=The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-09462-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xqV9-zmMxsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |pages=177}} Muhammad 'Alí Faydí's ''Hadrat-i Nuqta-yi Ulá'' (Tehran, 132 B.E./1976-77): "This work contains an interesting account of the single portrait of the Báb painted by Áqa Bálá Big Shíshvání Naqshbandí during Shírazí's stay in Urúmiyya in 1848 (pp. 367–74). This painting is now kept in the Bahá'í archives in Haifa..."&lt;/ref&gt; Then the Prime Minister ordered the Báb back to Tabriz, where the government called on religious authorities to put the Báb on trial for blasphemy and apostasy.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt;

===Trial===
The trial, attended by the Crown Prince, occurred in July 1848 and involved numerous local clergy. They questioned the Báb about the nature of his claims, his teachings, and demanded that he produce miracles to prove his divine authority. They admonished him to recant his claims. There are nine extant eyewitness reports of the trial, of which several may originate from an earlier source. Six of the reports are from Muslim accounts, and portray the Báb in an unfavourable light.&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt; There are 62 questions found in the nine sources, however eighteen occur in one source, fifteen in two, eight in three, five in four, thirteen in five, and three in six. Not including "yes" and "he did not answer", only thirty-five answers remain, of which ten occur in one source, eight in two, six in three, three in four, two in five, five in six. Only one answer is found in all nine eyewitness sources, where the Báb states that "I am that person you have been awaiting for one thousand years."&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt;

The trial did not bring a decisive result. Some clergy called for capital punishment, but the government pressured them to issue a lenient judgement because the Báb was popular. The government asked medical experts to declare the Báb insane in order to prevent his execution. To appease the religious clergy, the government may have spread rumours that the Báb recanted.&lt;ref name="amanat"&gt;{{cite book |first=Abbas |last=Amanat |title=Resurrection and Renewal: The Making of the Babi Movement in Iran |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca |year=1989 |pages=390–393}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shaykh al-Islām]], a champion of the anti-Bábist campaign, not at the Báb's trial, issued a conditional death sentence if the Báb was found to be sane. A [[fatwa]] was issued establishing the Báb's [[apostasy in Islam|apostasy]] and stated "The repentance of an incorrigible apostate is not accepted, and the only thing which has caused the postponement of thy execution is a doubt as to thy sanity of mind."&lt;ref name="amanat" /&gt;

The crown prince's physician, [[William Cormick]], examined the Báb and complied with the government's request to find grounds for clemency.&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt; The physician's opinion saved the Báb from execution for a time, but the clergy insisted that he face corporal punishment instead, so the Báb suffered [[foot whipping]] - twenty lashes to the bottoms of his feet.&lt;ref name="amanat" /&gt;

The unsigned and undated official government report states that because of his harsh beating, the Báb orally and in writing recanted, apologized, and stated that he would not continue to advance claims of divinity.&lt;ref name="msbr"&gt;{{cite book |first=E.G. |last=Browne |title=Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion |year=1918 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |url=https://bahai-library.com/browne_materials_study_babi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document of his alleged recantation was written shortly after his trial in Tabriz.&lt;ref name="trial" /&gt;
Some authors theorise that the assertions were made to embarrass the Báb and undermine his credibility with the public and that the language of this document is very different from the Báb's usual style, and so prepared by the authorities.&lt;ref name="amanat" /&gt;

Orientalist [[Edward Granville Browne]] received copies of the trial documents from {{Interlanguage link multi|Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney|fr|3=Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney}}, the first French Baha'i. A facsimile of the recantation is published in Browne's ''Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion'', where he states, "[The document], unsigned and undated, was claimed to be in the Báb's handwriting and consists of a complete recantation and renunciation of any superhuman claim which he may have advanced or have appeared to advance. There is nothing to show to whom it is addressed, or whether it is the recantation referred to in the last paragraph of the [government report] or another. The handwriting, though graceful, is not easily legible..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E.G. |last=Browne |title=Materials for the Study of the Babi Religion |year=1918 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |url=https://bahai-library.com/browne_materials_study_babi |pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a translation of the relevant section of the document:
{{Quote|text=Never have I desired aught contrary to the Will of God, and, if words contrary to His good pleasure have flowed from my pen, my object was not disobedience, and in any case I repent and ask forgiveness of Him.

After the trial, the Báb was ordered back to the fortress of Chehríq.

== Execution ==
{{main|Execution of the Báb}}
[[File:Where Bab executed.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The barrack square in [[Tabriz]], where the Báb was executed]]
In mid-1850 a new prime-minister, [[Amir Kabir]],&lt;ref name="gpb_52"&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-5.html#pg52 |pages=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the execution of the Báb, probably because various Bábí insurrections' defeats and the movement's popularity appeared waning. The Báb was brought back to Tabriz from Chehriq for an [[execution by firing squad]]. The night before his execution, while being conducted to his cell, a young Bábí, Muhammad-Ali "Anis" from [[Zonuz]], threw himself at the feet of the Báb and begged martyrdom with him, then was immediately arrested and placed in the same cell as the Báb.

On the morning of July 9, 1850 (28 Sha'ban 1266 [[Hijri year|AH]]), taken to the courtyard of the barracks where held, there appeared thousands of people gathered to watch his execution. The Báb and Anís were suspended on a wall and a large firing squad of [[Christian]] soldiers prepared to shoot.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; Numerous eye-witness reports, including those of Western diplomats, recount the result.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Justin Shiel, [[Queen Victoria]]'s Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary in Tehran, wrote to [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston]], the British Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, on July 22, 1850, regarding the execution. The [[Execution of the Báb#Western accounts|letter]], is found in its original form as document F.O. 60/152/88 in the archives of the Foreign Office at the Public Records Office in London.&lt;/ref&gt; The order was given to fire and the barracks square filled with musket smoke. When it cleared, the Báb was no longer in the courtyard and his companion stood there unharmed; the bullets apparently had not harmed either man, but had cut the rope suspending them from the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Some accounts say Anís succumbed to death on the first volley, another that the Báb was dispatched by a sword. See [[Firuz Kazemzadeh]], Kazem Kazemzadeh, and Howard Garey, "The Báb: Accounts of His Martyrdom", in ''World Order'', vol. 8, no. 1 (Fall, 1973), 32. All accounts, even the Muslim ones, concur that the Báb survived the first volley.&lt;/ref&gt; There was a great commotion, many in the crowd believing the Báb had ascended to heaven or simply disappeared. But the soldiers subsequently found the Báb in another part of the barracks, completely unharmed, giving his final instructions to his [[Letters of the Living#Siyyid H.CC.A3usayn Yazd.C3.AD|secretary]]. He and Anis were tied up for execution a second time, and a second firing squad of [[Muslim]] soldiers ranged in front of them. A second order to fire was given. This time the Báb and his companion were killed.&lt;ref name="iranica_bab" /&gt; In Bábí and Bahá'í tradition, the failure of the first firing to kill the Báb is believed a miracle. Their remains were dumped outside the gates of the town to be eaten by animals.

However, their remains were clandestinely rescued by a handful of Bábis and then hidden. Over time the remains secretly transported according to the instructions of Bahá'u'lláh and then `Abdu'l-Bahá by way of Isfahan, Kirmanshah, [[Baghdad]], [[Damascus]], [[Beirut]], and then by sea to [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] on the plain below [[Mount Carmel]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="gpb_18"&gt;{{cite book |first=Effendi |last=Shoghi |authorlink=Shoghi Effendi |year=1944 |title=God Passes By |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=0-87743-020-9 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-19.html |pages=273–289}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, 1909, the remains were interred in a special tomb, the [[Shrine of the Báb]], erected for this purpose by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], on Mount Carmel in present-day [[Haifa]], Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brian D.

== Succession ==
{{main|Bahá'í/Bábí split}}
[[File:shrine of the Báb, Haifa.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Shrine of the Báb]], Haifa]]
In most of his prominent writings, the Báb alluded to a Promised One, most commonly referred to as ''man yazhiruhu'lláh'', "[[He whom God shall make manifest|Him Whom God shall make manifest]]", and that he himself was "but a ring upon the hand of Him Whom God shall make manifest." Within 20 years of the Báb's death, over 25 people claimed to be the Promised One, most significantly [[Bahá'u'lláh]].

Before the Báb's death, he sent a letter to Mírzá Yahyá, [[Subh-i-Azal]], that some consider a will and testament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm |title=The Primal Point’s Will and Testament |website=www.h-net.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recognized the appointing of Subh-i-Azal as the leader of the Bábí community after the death of the Báb, and ordered to obey the Promised One when he appears.&lt;ref name="Manuchehri (2004)"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm |title=The Primal Point’s Will and Testament |website=www.h-net.msu.edu |access-date=February 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213234108/http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~bahai/notes/vol7/BABWILL.htm |archive-date=February 13, 2006 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time Subh-i-Azal, still a teenager, had never demonstrated leadership in the Bábí movement, and was still living in the house of his older brother, Bahá'u'lláh. All of this lends credence to the Bahá'í claim that the Báb appointed Subh-i-Azal the head of the Bábí Faith so as to divert attention away from Bahá'u'lláh, while allowing Bábís to visit Bahá'u'lláh and consult with him freely, and allowing Bahá'u'lláh to write to Bábís easily and freely. Shia Islam includes a vast history of hidden leaders, and their deputies wielding the true power.  The first examples of this are the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi#Minor Occultation|four bábs]] as is Ali-Muhammad's choice of the title "the Báb".

In 1852 Bahá'u'lláh, while a prisoner in Tehran, was visited by a "[[Maid of Heaven]]", that symbolically marked the beginning of his mission as a Messenger of God. Eleven years later in Baghdad, he made his first public declaration and eventually was recognized by the vast majority of Bábís as "He Whom God shall make manifest". His followers began calling themselves [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]].&lt;ref name="cole_bahabio"&gt;{{cite web |title=A Brief Biography of Baha'u'llah |last=Cole |first=Juan |accessdate=June 22, 2006 |url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jrcole/bahabio.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subh-i-Azal continued to live with or close to Bahá'u'lláh throughout the latter's exiles from Iran to [[Baghdad]] and then to [[Istanbul]] and [[Edirne]], though Bahá'u'lláh's claim as a Manifestation of God in 1863 theoretically rendered moot Subh-i-Azal's authority as the head of the Bábí community. In September 1867, in Edirne, the rival claims to authority came to a head. Subh-i-Azal challenged Bahá'u'lláh to a test of the divine will in a local mosque in Edirne such that "God would strike down the impostor". Bahá'u'lláh agreed and went to the [[Yavuz Selim Mosque]] at the appointed time, but Subh-i-Azal failed to show up.&lt;ref name = "Browne (1918) p. 18 &amp; Salmání (1982) pp. 94-95"&gt;Browne (1918) [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/B/browne/material/qazvini.htm p. 18.] &amp; Salmání (1982) [http://bahai-library.com/salmani_memories_bahaullah pp. 94–95]&lt;/ref&gt;

Subh-i-Azal's followers became known as [[Azali]]s or Azali Bábís. For the Bábís who did not recognize Bahá'u'lláh, Subh-i-Azal remained their leader until his death in 1912, and Azali successorship remains disputed. Bahá'í sources report that 11 of the 18 "witnesses" appointed by Subh-i-Azal to oversee the Bábí community became Bahá'ís, as his son did. The man allegedly appointed by Subh-i-Azal to succeed him, Hadíy-i-Dawlat-Abádí, later publicly recanted his faith in the Báb and Subh-i-Azal.&lt;ref name = "GPB, p. 233 &amp; Momen (1991)"&gt;Shoghi Effendi (1944) [http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/se/GPB/gpb-7.html#pg233 p. 233] &amp; Momen (1991) [http://bahai-library.com/momen_cyprus_exiles pp. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bahá'u'llah emerged more successful and nearly all of the Báb's followers abandoned Subh-i-Azal and became Bahá'ís. Today Bahá'ís have several million followers, while estimates of the number of Azalís are generally around one thousand in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Azali |publisher=Britannica Concise |url=http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264 |accessdate=October 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014214910/http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9356264 |archive-date=October 14, 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teachings ==
{{main|Teachings of the Báb}}
The Báb's teachings have three broad stages, each with a dominant thematic focus. His earliest teachings are primarily defined by his interpretation of the [[Quran]] and [[hadith]]. This interpretive mode continues throughout all three stages of his teachings, but a shift takes place where his emphasis moves to philosophical elucidation, and finally to [[legislation|legislative]] pronouncements. In the second philosophical stage, the Báb gives an explanation of the [[metaphysics]] of being and creation, and in the third legislative stage his mystical and historical principles unite.&lt;ref name="saiedi27"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gate of the Heart |first=Nader |last=Saiedi |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, ON |pages=27–28 |isbn=978-1-55458-035-4 |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of the Báb's writings throughout these stages show his teachings were animated by a common principle with multiple dimensions and forms.&lt;ref name="saiedi49"&gt;{{cite book |title=Gate of the Heart |first=Nader |last=Saiedi |publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press |location=Waterloo, ON |pages=49 |isbn=978-1-55458-035-4 |year=2008 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XTfoaK15t64C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Understanding+the+Writings+of+the+B%C3%A1b&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings ==
{{wikiquote}}

Most of the writings of the Báb have been lost. The Báb himself stated they exceeded five hundred thousand verses in length; the Qur'an, in contrast, is 6300 verses in length. If one assumes 25 verses per page, that would equal 20,000 pages of text.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, in ''The Dawn-breakers'', mentions nine complete commentaries on the Qur'an, revealed during the Báb's imprisonment at Maku, which have been lost without a trace.&lt;ref&gt;Denis MacEoin, ''The Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'' (Leiden: Brill, 1992), 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Establishing the true text of the works that are still extant, as already noted, is not always easy, and some texts will require considerable work. Others, however, are in good shape; several of the Báb's major works are available in the handwriting of his trusted secretaries.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most works were revealed in response to specific questions by Bábís. This is not unusual; the genre of the letter has been a venerable medium for composing authoritative texts as far back as [[Paul the Apostle]]. Three quarters of the chapters of the [[New Testament]] are letters, were composed to imitate letters, or contain letters within them.&lt;ref&gt;On letters as a medium of composition of the New Testament, see Norman Perrin, ''The New Testament: An Introduction, Proclamation and Parenesis, Myth and History'' (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovitch, 1974), 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the Báb revealed works very rapidly by chanting them in the presence of a secretary and eyewitnesses.

The Archives Department at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] currently holds about 190 [[Tablet (religious)|Tablets]] of the Báb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Unpublished letter from the Universal House of Justice |title=Numbers and Classifications of Sacred Writings Texts |url=http://bahai-library.com/uhj_numbers_sacred_writings |accessdate=December 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts from several principal works have been published in the only English-language compilation of the Báb's writings: ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb]]''. Denis MacEoin, in his ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', gives a description of many works; much of the following summary is derived from that source. In addition to major works, the Báb revealed numerous letters to his wife and followers, many prayers for various purposes, numerous commentaries on verses or chapters of the Qur'an, and many ''khutbihs'' or sermons (most of which were never delivered). Many of these have been lost; others have survived in compilations.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 15–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Báb has been criticized for his inconsistent use of correct and incorrect [[Arabic grammar]] in his religious works, though in his Arabic letters made very few mistakes.&lt;ref name="grammar"&gt;{{cite web |author=William F. McCants |title=Arabic Grammar of the Bab, The |url=http://bahai-library.com/mccants_arabic_grammar_bab |accessdate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reason for this inconsistency could be to distinguish those who could not see past the outer form of the words from those that could understand the deeper meaning of his message.&lt;ref name="grammar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Todd Lawson |title=Qur'an Commentary of Sayyid 'Alí Muhammad, the Báb, The (Doctoral dissertation) |url=http://bahai-library.com/lawson_quran_commentary_bab |accessdate=March 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writings before his declaration===
[[File:Selectionfromthebab.jpg|right|120px]]
Todd Lawson noted this in his doctoral dissertation about the Báb's ''[[Tafsir]] on Surah [[al-Baqara]]''.&lt;ref&gt;B. Todd Lawson, ''The Qur'an Commentary of Sayyid `Alî Muḥammad, the Bab'', PhD diss, Institute of Islamic Studies, McGill Univ., Montreal, 1987, 250–51.&lt;/ref&gt; This tafsir was started by the Báb in November or December 1843, some six months before declaring his mission. The first half was completed by February or March 1844; the second half was revealed after the Báb's declaration. It is the only work of the Báb's revealed before his declaration that has survived intact. It also sheds light on the Báb's attitude toward Twelver beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt; His wife also refers to important episodes before his declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Momen |first=Moojan |title=Messianic Concealment and Theophanic Disclosure |journal=Online Journal of Bahá’í Studies |volume=1 |pages=71–88 |publisher= |location= |year=2007 |url=http://oj.bahaistudies.net/OJBS_1_Momen_Messianic_Concealment.pdf |issn=1177-8547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shiraz, May – September 1844===
*The first chapter of the ''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Qayyúmu'l-Asmá'|Qayyúmu'l-Asmá']]'' ("Tafsir on the Surah ''[[Yusuf (surah)|Yusuf]]''")&lt;ref name="listofwritings"&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land, Ed |url=http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63&amp;chapter=1#13 |title=''Bahá'í Faith, The: 1844–1963'' |pages=13 |accessdate=July 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was written by the Báb on the evening of his declaration to [[Mullá Husayn]], on the evening of May 22, 1844. The entire work, which is several hundred pages in length and is considered to be revelation by Bahá'ís, required forty days to write; it is one of the Báb's longer Arabic works. It was widely distributed in the first year of the Bábí movement, functioning as something of a Qur'an or Bible for the Bábís. In the book the Báb states his claim to be a [[Manifestation of God]], though the claim is disguised with other statements that he is the servant of the Hidden Imám.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 55–57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Táhirih]] translated the work into Persian.
*''Sahífih-yi-makhzúnih'', revealed before his departure for Mecca in September 1844, and consists of a collection of fourteen prayers, mostly to be recited on specific holy days and festivals. Its content remained within the expectations of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pilgrimage, September 1844 – June 1845===
During his {{frac|9|1|2}}-month pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], the Báb composed many works:

*''Khasá'il-i-sab`ih'': A work composed by the Báb on his sea journey back to [[Bushehr]] after his pilgrimage, which listed some regulations to be followed by the Bábí community. A copy of the manuscript probably still exists in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kitáb-i-Rúḥ'' ("Book of the Spirit"): This book contains 700 or 900 verses and was written while the Báb was sailing back to Bushehr from pilgrimage. The original was nearly destroyed when the Báb was arrested. Several manuscript copies are extant.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 61.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sahífih baynu'l-haramayn'' ("Treatise Between the Two Sanctuaries"): This Arabic work was written while the Báb traveled from Mecca to Medina in early 1845 and is in response to questions posed to him by a prominent Shaykhí leader.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kitáb-i-Fihrist'' ("The Book of the Catalogue"): A list of the Báb's works, composed by the Báb himself after he returned from pilgrimage to Mecca, June 21, 1845. It is a bibliography of his earliest writings.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bushehr and Shiraz, March 1845 – September 1846===
The Báb was in Bushehr March through June 1845, then in Shiraz.

*''Sahífih-yi-Ja`fariyyih'': The Báb wrote this treatise to an unknown correspondent in 1845. Over a hundred pages in length, it states many of his basic teachings, especially in relation to some Shaykhi beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tafsír-i-Súrih-i-Kawthar'' ("Tafsir on the Surah [[al-Kawthar]]"): The Báb wrote this commentary for Yahyá Dárábí Vahíd while he was in Shiraz; it is the most important work revealed during the Shiraz period. Though the surah is only three verses in length, being the shortest in the Qur'an, the commentary on it is over two hundred pages in length. The work was widely distributed, and at least a dozen early manuscripts are extant.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 71; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, ''The Dawn-breakers'', 174-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isfahan, September 1846 – March 1847===
*''Nubuvvih khásish'': This work, of fifty pages' length, was revealed in two hours in response to a question by Governor Manouchehr Khan Gorji. It discusses the [[Prophecy (Shia Islam)|special prophethood of Muhammad]], an important subject discussed in debates between Muslims and Christians.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 76–77; Amanat, ''Resurrection and Renewal'', 257; Nabíl-i-Zarandí, ''The Dawn-breakers'', 202-04.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tafsír-i-Súrih-i-va'l-`asr'' (Commentary on the Surah [[al-Asr|al-‘Aṣr]]): This is one of the two important works the Báb penned in Isfahan. It was written spontaneously and publicly in response to a request by Mir Sayyid Muhammad, the chief cleric of the city; much of it was written in one evening, to the astonishment to those present.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maku, late summer 1847 – May 1848===
The Báb left Isfahan in March 1847, sojourned outside Tehran several months, then was sent to a fortress at Maku, Iran, close to the Turkish border. It witnessed the composition of some of the Báb's most important works.

*''[[Persian Bayán]]'': This is undoubtedly the most important work of the Báb and contains a mature summary of his teachings. It was composed in Maku in late 1847 or early 1848. The work consists of nine chapters titled váhids or "unities", which in turn are usually subdivided into nineteen bábs or "gates"; the one exception is the last unity, which has only ten bábs. The Báb explained that it would be the task of "He Whom God shall make manifest" to complete the work; Bahá'ís believe Bahá'u'lláh's ''[[Kitáb-i-Íqán]]'' to be the completion of the Bayán. Each unity begins with an Arabic summary of its contents, which makes it easier to read than many of the Báb's works. Extracts of this work are published in ''Selections from the Writings of the Báb''; A. L. M. Nicolas translated the entire work into French in four 150-page volumes.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 83–85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Arabic Bayán]]'': This is the shorter and less important of the two Bayáns. It consists of eleven váhids or "unities", each with nineteen bábs or "gates". It offers a succinct summary of the Báb's teachings and laws. It was composed at Maku in late 1847 or early 1848.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 85.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Selections from the Writings of the Báb#Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih (The Seven Proofs)|Dalá'il-i-Sab'ih]]'' ("Seven Proofs"): There are two works by this name, the longer one in Persian, the shorter one in Arabic; both were composed in Maku in late 1847 or early 1848. Nicholas called the Persian Seven Proofs "the most important of the polemical works that issued from the pen of Sayyid `Alí Muhammad".&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 85–88.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was written to either a non-Bábí or to a follower whose faith had been shaken, but the recipient's identity is unknown.{{citation needed|date=May 2008}} The Arabic text summarizes the seven proofs found in the Persian text.

===&lt;u&gt;Ch&lt;/u&gt;ihríq, May 1848 – July 1850===
The Báb spent two years in Chehriq, except for his brief visit to [[Tabriz]] for his trial. The works he produced there were more esoteric or mystical and less thematically organized.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 88–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Two major books were produced, in addition to many minor works:

*''[[Kitabu'l-Asmá']]'' ("The Book of Names"): This is an extremely long book about the names of God. It was penned during the Báb's last days at Chehriq, before his execution. The various manuscript copies contain numerous variations in the text; the book will require considerable work to reconstruct its original text.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 91–92.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Kitáb-i-panj sha'n'' ("Book of Five Grades"): Having been composed in March and April 1850, this is one of the Báb's last works. The book consists of eighty-five sections arranged in seventeen groups, each under the heading of a different name of God. Within each group are five "grades", that is, five different sorts of sections: verses, prayers, homilies, commentaries, and Persian language pieces. Each group was sent to a different person and was composed on a different day. Thus the work is a kind of miscellany of unrelated material. Some of the sections represent further exposition of basic themes in the Báb's teachings; others consists of lengthy iterations of the names of God, and variations on their roots.&lt;ref&gt;MacEoin, ''Sources for Early Bābī Doctrine and History'', 93–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commemorations in the Bahá'í calendar==
In the [[Bahá'í calendar]] the events of the birth, declaration and death of the Báb are commemorated by Bahá'í communities on a yearly basis.&lt;ref name="holy-days"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Smith (historian) |encyclopedia=A concise encyclopedia of the Bahá'í Faith |title=holy days |year=2000 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |location=Oxford |isbn=1-85168-184-1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pYfrAQAAQBAJ |pages=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the centennial of the declaration of the Báb to Mulla Husayn in May, 1944, the Bahá'ís had a viewing of the portrait of the Báb during the celebrations held at the [[Bahá'í House of Worship (Wilmette, Illinois)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=John Astley-Cock |title=Baha'i Temple is dedicated at Centennial |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |location=Chicago, IL |pages=15 |date=23 May 1944 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14639468/bahai_centenary_dorothy_baker/  | access-date = Oct 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the event were [[Dorothy Beecher Baker]], [[Horace Holley (Bahá'í)|Horace Holley]], and others.

'''Community Boards''' is a [[community]] based [[mediation]] program, established in 1976, in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States by [[Raymond Shonholtz]]. The program utilizes [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s from the [[neighbourhood]]s of the city, who work with people involved in disagreements toward the end of resolving the dispute, repairing the relationship, and healing or preventing rifts in the community.

The Community Boards program promotes a model of mediation that emphasizes the collective involvement of members of the community, recruiting mediators who are representative of their neighbourhoods—with direct awareness of local needs and concerns. The program utilizes a form of case management in which "case developers" make in–person contact with potential parties in order to encourage participation. Once the parties involved have consented to participate, they are assisted by a panel (usually 3) of mediators.

The program is among the most distant approach to formal legal process among the various models of community mediation. The most dramatic example of this viewpoint is the contention by the program's mediators that any agreement reached should be enforceable only by the good will and voluntary compliance of the parties. Proponents have asserted that the program's impact is much broader than the resolution of individual disputes—reaching into issues of tolerance, acceptance and social justice.

Community Boards has also been active in the promotion of [[K-12]] school-based peer mediation programs since 1982.

This article details various versions of [[DOS]]-compatible operating systems.

== Historical and licensing information ==
Originally MS-DOS was designed to be an operating system that could run on ''any'' computer with a [[x86|8086-family]] [[microprocessor]]. It competed with other [[operating system]]s written for such computers, such as [[CP/M-86]] and [[UCSD Pascal]]. Each computer would have its own distinct hardware and its own version of MS-DOS, a situation similar to the one that existed for [[CP/M]], with MS-DOS emulating the [[CP/M#Basic Input Output System|same solution]] as CP/M to adapt for different hardware platforms. So there were many different [[original equipment manufacturer]] (OEM) versions of ''MS-DOS'' for different hardware. But the greater speed attainable by direct control of hardware was of particular importance, especially when running computer games. So very soon an IBM-compatible architecture became the goal, and before long all 8086-family computers [[influence of the IBM PC on the personal computer market#Domination of the clones|closely emulated IBM hardware]], and only a single version of MS-DOS for a fixed hardware platform was all that was needed for the market. This specific version of MS-DOS is the version that is discussed here, as all other versions of MS-DOS died out with their respective systems. One version of such a ''generic MS-DOS'' (Z-DOS) is mentioned here, but there were dozens more. All these were for personal computers that used an 8086-family microprocessor, but which were not fully [[IBM PC compatible]].

! {{rh}} | [[MS-DOS&amp;nbsp;8.0]] (Windows ME and later)&lt;ref name="msdos8"&gt;MS-DOS&amp;nbsp;8.0 has most of the functionality of prior versions, but with significant losses of usability, e.g., the loss of &lt;code&gt;FORMAT /S&lt;/code&gt; command, that can be substituted by formatting HDD/FDD and then copying [[IO.SYS]] from [[CD-ROM]] boot A: image, as first ever file onto drive; loss of &lt;code&gt;SYS A:&lt;/code&gt; (or &lt;code&gt;SYS B:&lt;/code&gt;) command for floppies, that can be substituted too in the same way as &lt;code&gt;FORMAT /S&lt;/code&gt;; inability to boot to a command prompt without substitution/modification of IO.SYS (other than CD-ROM boot version) and [[COMMAND.COM]]. For purpose of booting from C: drive, an unmodified IO.SYS from simulated A: boot diskette image, that is placed on Windows&amp;nbsp;Me OEM CD-ROM, from which that CD boots, can be used, and English COMMAND.COM can be modified by replacing in this file at hex offset &lt;tt&gt;00006510h&lt;/tt&gt; byte &lt;tt&gt;75h&lt;/tt&gt; by byte &lt;tt&gt;EBh&lt;/tt&gt;, or substituted by (now [[freeware]]) [[4DOS]] http://www.jpsoft.com/download.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--outdated link? i.e. it seems to have unrelated content now, maybe right one is in archive.org--&gt;

| {{No|Support ended by Microsoft}}&lt;ref name="winme"&gt;While Windows ME support ended, a version of its underlying DOS is included with {{nowrap|[[Windows XP]]}}. When one formats a floppy in Windows&amp;nbsp;XP and selects "Create an MS-DOS startup disk", the floppy is formatted with a DOS version that identifies itself as "Windows Millennium Version 4.90.3000".&lt;/ref&gt;

Other DOS versions supporting FAT32 may allow a larger partition size closer to the theoretical 2&amp;nbsp;TB/16&amp;nbsp;TB maximum suggested by FAT32's specifications.  Windows&amp;nbsp;2000 and XP can mount and use a FAT32 partition larger than 32 GB, but they cannot natively create one, which according to Microsoft is by design.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11807">This is a comparison of the [[Open XML Paper Specification|OpenXPS]] [[document file format]] with the [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] [[file format]]. Both file format standards are essentially [[Container format (digital)|containers]] for representing [[Content (media and publishing)|digital content]] in a paper-like fashion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/business_applications/pdf_and_xps_when_acronyms_compete.html Microsoft Watch - Business Applications - PDF and XPS: When Acronyms Compete&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Note that OpenXPS is incompatible with .xps files generated by Windows 7 and Vista. Windows versions from Windows 8 onward generate .oxps, OpenXPS compliant files (see [[Open XML Paper Specification]]).

==Design aims==
The differences between Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS) and the Portable Document Format (PDF) can be traced to their [[Virtual Heritage|heritage]] and the manner of their development, as they have different design goals and different groups providing input.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole section|date=April 2014}}

The different goals in the development of OpenXPS and PDF resulted in different principles and design tradeoffs between the file formats.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=April 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2559">The '''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium''' is an important multilingual collection of [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian]] texts with over 600 volumes published since its foundation in 1903 by [[Louvain Catholic University]] in [[Belgium]] and [[The Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The present Secretary General is Andrea Schmidt of Louvain University (French Section in Louvain-la-Neuve).

240 volumes are devoted to [[Syriac language|Syriac]] writers. There are also sections for works in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. The total number of publications also includes just over a hundred monographs.

The series is characterized by publications presenting a critical edition of the original texts in one volume and a translation in a second volume (there are some exceptions though).

The series was originally printed by different printing offices, each specialized in representing ancient characters in print. Today, only one of these specialized printers is responsible for the production and publication of the volumes. Peeters&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peeters-leuven.be Peeters-leuven.be]&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly known as 'Orientaliste'), who established also an international academic publishing house in the 20th century, is responsible for the distribution of the books. All volumes of the series are still in print.

'''CycleStreets''' is not-for-profit [[United Kingdom]] organisation that provides a free-to-use national cycle journey planner for the [[United Kingdom]]. The planner uses [[OpenStreetMap]] data for routing, [[Shuttle Radar Topography Mission]] for height data and official [[Postal code|postcode]] data. It was launched in March 2009 and by January 2010 had planned 100,000 journeys. As of August 2015, the site has planned over 45 million itineraries. It was 'Highly Commended' at the 2009 ACT Travelwise awards. It provides worldwide routing using OpenStreetMap data.

==History==
CycleStreets is a development of the [[Cambridge Cycle Campaign Journey Planner]], which was launched in 2006.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/about/| title=About| publisher=CycleStreets| accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; CycleStreets itself was launched on 20 March 2009;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/03/20/welcome/|title=Welcome to CycleStreets!|date=2009-03-20|publisher=CycleStreets|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was by co-incidence the same day that it was announced that the [[Transport Direct Portal]] was about to introduce cycle routing for a small number of trial locations including [[Manchester]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://road.cc/content/news/3081-manchester-cyclists-first-benefit-pioneering-online-route-planner?quicktabs_1=0|title=Manchester cyclists first to benefit from pioneering online route planner|date=2009-03-20|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, a feature to plan circular routes was added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/07/13/planning-a-circular-route/|title=Planning a circular route|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2009-07-13|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the project was featured in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/pda/2009/jun/10/london-transport|title=Tube strike chaos? Get on your bike — with CycleStreets|work=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Peter | last=Robins | date=2009-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009 functionality was added to export routes for use in [[GPS]] device&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/08/14/exporting-cycle-routes-to-gps/|title=Exporting cycle routes to GPS|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2009-08-14|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ability to route via ferry services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/08/05/ferry-crossings-and-more/|title=Ferry Crossings and more|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2009-08-05|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in October 2009 the project released elevation profiles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/10/08/elevation-profiles/|title=Elevation Profiles in CycleStreets|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2009-10-08|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Balanced routes'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/10/08/balanced-routes/|title=Balanced routes|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2009-10-08|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, CycleStreets was 'Highly Commended' in the [[ACT Travelwise]] annual awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2009/12/02/act-travelwise-award/|title=CycleStreets ‘Highly Commended’ at the ACT Travelwise Awards 2009|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, the ability to share short video clips was added&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2010/02/02/photomap-shares-video/|title=Photomap shares video| publisher=CycleStreets| date=2010-02-02|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in March 2010 CycleStreets added [[Google Streetview]] images to the route description pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2010/01/17/street-view-in-itineraries/|title=View from the Street – in itinerary listings|date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[post code]] look-up function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2010/03/14/postcode-searching-added/|title=Postcode searching added|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2010-03-14|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They reported their 100,000th journey plan itinerary the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2010/01/16/100000-cycle-journeys-planned-on-cyclestreets/|title=100,000 cycle journeys planned on CycleStreets|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2010-01-16|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In 2007, during the development of CycleStreets, Simon Nuttall and Martin Lucas-Smith advised Transport Direct on the [[CycleNetXChange]] data exchange standard for cycle route data which was later used in the [[Transport Direct Portal]] cycle journey planner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/location/11157/|title=A meeting of the Department for Transport's Mapping Working Party, which map developers Simon and Martin attended|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2007-07-03|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclenetxchange/schema/0.3a/CycleNetXChange.xsd|title=schema targetNamespace="http://www.cyclenetxchange.org.uk/cnm"|publisher=Department for Transport|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, CycleStreets was presented at the OpenStreetMap annual 'State of the Map' Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/cyclestreets/cyclestreets-quickfire-presentation-to-osm-state-of-the-map|title=CycleStreets quickfire presentation to OSM State of the Map 2009|publisher=Slideshare|date=2009-07-10|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, Martin Lucas Smith of CycleStreets presented the project at the School of Cartography Summer School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slideshare.net/cyclestreets/cyclestreets-presentation-to-society-of-cartographers|title=CycleStreets presentation to Society of Cartographers|publisher=SlideShare|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project held its first 'Developer Day' in March 2010, where technical issues relating to the project were discussed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclestreets.net/blog/2010/03/10/lessons-from-the-developer-day/|title=Lessons from the Developer Day|publisher=CycleStreets|date=2010-03-10|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there was a session on cycle routing at WhereCampEU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialtext.net/wherecamp/index.cgi?wherecamp_eu_session_cyclestreets_cycle_routing|title=WhereCamp.EU session - CycleStreets cycle routing|work=WhereCampEU|accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
CycleStreets is a not-for-profit project and has been largely self-funded. It has received grants from the following organisations (in chronological order):

*Cycling Scotland (£5,000): To develop a version of the site for Edinburgh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://changingpace.info/2009/07/15/now-it-can-be-revealed|title=Now It Can Be Revealed|work=Changing pace|date=2009-07-15|accessdate=2010-04-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120708164456/http://changingpace.info/2009/07/15/now-it-can-be-revealed|archivedate=2012-07-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Cycling Scotland are now promoting as a Scotland-wide system&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingscotland.org/|title=Cycling Scotland (homepage)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor '''Dionysius Lardner''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] (3 April 1793{{snd}}29 April 1859) was an Irish scientific writer who popularised science and technology, and edited the 133-volume ''[[List of works in Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia|Cabinet Cyclopædia]]''.

==Early life in Dublin==
He was born in [[Dublin]] on 3 April 1793 the son of William Lardner, a solicitor in Dublin, who wished his son to follow the same calling. After some years of uncongenial desk work, Lardner entered [[Trinity College, Dublin]], in 1812, and obtained a B.A. in 1817&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|wstitle=Lardner, Dionysius |volume=16 |page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an M.A. in 1819, winning many prizes. He married Cecilia Flood on 19 December 1815, but they separated in 1820 and were divorced in 1835. About the time of the separation, he began a relationship with a married woman, Anne Maria Darley Boursiquot, the wife of a Dublin wine merchant. It is believed that he fathered her son, [[Dion Boucicault]], the actor and dramatist. Lardner provided him with financial support until 1840. Whilst in Dublin, Lardner began to write and lecture on scientific and mathematical matters, and to contribute articles for publication by the Irish Academy.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16068?docPos=2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in London==
In 1828 Lardner was elected professor of [[natural philosophy]] and [[astronomy]] at [[University College, London]], a position he held until he resigned his professorship in 1831.

Lardner showed himself to be a successful populariser of science, giving talks on contemporary topics such as [[Charles Babbage|Babbage]]'s [[Difference Engine]] (1834).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/babbage/dionysiuslardner/ |title=Dionysius Lardner |publisher=Computer History Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of numerous mathematical and physical treatises on such subjects as [[algebraic geometry]] (1823), the differential and integral [[calculus]] (1825), and the [[steam engine]] (1828).  He also wrote hand-books on various departments of natural philosophy (1854–1856); but it is as the editor of Lardner's ''[[List of works in Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia|Cabinet Cyclopædia]]'' (1830–1844) that he is best remembered.

The ''Cabinet Cyclopædia'' eventually comprised 133 volumes, and many of the ablest savants of the day contributed to it. [[Sir Walter Scott]] contributed a history of [[Scotland]] and [[Thomas Moore]] contributed a history of Ireland. [[Connop Thirlwall]] provided a history of [[Ancient Greece]], whilst [[Robert Southey]] provided a section on naval history. Many eminent scientists contributed as well. Lardner himself was the author of the treatises on arithmetic, geometry, heat, [[hydrostatics]] and [[pneumatics]], mechanics (in conjunction with [[Henry Kater]]) and electricity (in conjunction with [[Charles Vincent Walker|C.V. Walker]]).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

The ''Cabinet Library'' (12 vols., 1830–1832) and the ''Museum of Science and Art'' (12 vols., 1854–1856) were his other chief undertakings. A few original papers appear in the Royal Irish Academy's ''Transactions'' (1824), in the [[Royal Society]]'s ''Proceedings'' (1831–1836) and in the Astronomical Society's ''Monthly Notices'' (1852–1853); and two ''Reports'' to the British Association on railway constants (1838, 1841) are from his pen.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

==Involvement in scandal==
In 1840 Lardner's career received a major setback as a result of his involvement with Mary Spicer Heaviside, the wife of Captain Richard Heaviside, of the [[Dragoon Guards]]. He had previously been married to Cecilia Flood in 1815, but had separated in 1820. Lardner ran off to Paris with Mrs Heaviside, pursued by her husband. When he caught up with them, Heaviside subjected Lardner to a flogging; he was unable to persuade his wife to return with him. Later that year he successfully sued Lardner for "[[criminal conversation]]" (adultery) and received a judgment of £8,000. The Heavisides were divorced in 1845, and in 1846 Lardner was able to marry Mary Heaviside. The scandal caused by his affair with a married woman effectively ended his career in England, so Lardner and his wife remained in Paris until shortly before his death in 1859. He was able to maintain his career by lecturing in the United States between 1841 and 1844, which proved financially rewarding,&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; realising £40,000.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

He died in [[Naples]], Italy, and is buried in the [[English Cemetery, Naples|Cimitero degli Inglesi]] there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boylan|first= Henry |year=1998|title=A Dictionary of Irish Biography, 3rd Edition|page=215|location=Dublin|publisher= Gill and MacMillan|isbn= 0-7171-2945-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disagreements with Brunel==
Lardner became involved in a number of ill-advised public disagreements with [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] regarding technical matters, in which he came off the worse.

During the 1833 Parliamentary hearings discussing the proposal of the Great Western Railway, Lardner criticised Brunel's design of the [[Box Tunnel]]. The tunnel had a 1-in-100 gradient from the east end to the west end. Lardner asserted that if a train's brakes were to fail in the tunnel, it would accelerate to over  {{convert|120|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, at which speed the train would break up and kill the passengers. Brunel pointed out that Lardner's calculations totally disregarded air-resistance and friction, a basic error.&lt;ref name=christopher/&gt;

In 1836, when Brunel was proposing to build ''[[SS Great Western]]'' for the {{convert|3500|mi|km|abbr=on}} transatlantic passage to New York, at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, Lardner stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, it was perfectly chimerical, and they might as well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon... {{convert|2080|mi|km|abbr=on}} is the longest run that a steamer could encounter – at the end of that distance she would require a relay of coals.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Again, Brunel was able to show that Lardner's calculations were too simplistic. The principle that Brunel understood, which Lardner did not, was that the carrying capacity of a ship increases as the cube of its dimensions, whilst the water-resistance only increases as the square of its dimensions. This meant that large ships were more fuel efficient, and could carry sufficient coal for the long voyage across the Atlantic. Brunel was proved right when the ''Great Western'' steamed into New York harbour with {{convert|200|LT|t|abbr=off}}  of coal to spare.&lt;ref name=christopher/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article31722240&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838 while Brunel was building the [[Broad gauge|broad-gauge]] [[Great Western Railway]], Lardner carried out some experiments with the company's flagship locomotive, ''[[GWR Star Class|North Star]]''. He asserted that, whilst the engine was capable of hauling {{convert|82|LT|t|abbr=off}}  at {{convert|33|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, it was only capable of hauling {{convert|16|LT|t|abbr=off}} at {{convert|41|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. He also recorded excessive fuel consumption at higher speeds. Lardner attributed this to the greater wind resistance of broad-gauge engines. Brunel and his assistant [[Daniel Gooch]] carried out their own experiments on the same locomotive and found that the only problem was that the [[blast pipe]] was too small. This was easily rectified and the North Star's performance immediately improved. At the next meeting of the company's directors, Brunel triumphantly dismissed Lardner's evidence.&lt;ref name=christopher&gt;Christopher, John, "Brunel's Kingdom", 2006, Tempus Publishing Limited, {{ISBN|0-7524-3697-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contemporary influence==
Lardner is mentioned in [[Karl Marx]]'s ''[[Das Kapital]]'' and was well respected as an economist. He mixed with the rich and famous.  He was involved in the founding of the [[University of London]] and the first person to hold the post of Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy there.  He was influential in publicising [[Charles Babbage]]'s [[Difference Engine]].

Whilst lecturing in America Lardner was paid by Norris Brothers, the largest firm of locomotive builders, to investigate a fatal accident in Reading, near Philadelphia, where a [[boiler]] had exploded on a newly made train. Lardner pronounced that the accident had been caused by lightning, which meant that Norris brothers were not personally liable for the accident. A committee of the Franklin Institute pointed out that there was no lightning present at that time and that the pumps had been faulty, the water indicator was ill-designed and the bridge-bands made of cast iron rather than wrought iron. The Coroner's inquest jury were persuaded by Lardner that the accident was an 'act of God' but the company were careful to design their later locomotives with wrought-iron bands.&lt;ref&gt;John Brockmann "Twisted Rails, sunken ships, the rhetoric of nineteenth century Steamboat and Railroad Accident Investigation Reports, 1833–1879" New York, Baywood,2005 p. 41-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia.jpg|thumb|right|The [[title page]] of the first draft{{sfn|Lloyd|2017}}]]
The '''''Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia''''' was a medical guide consisting of recipes and methods for making medicine. It was first published by the [[Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh]] in 1699 as the '''''Pharmacopoea Collegii Regii Medicorum Edimburgensium'''''.{{sfn|Cowen|1957}} The Edinburgh Pharmacopeia merged with the London and Dublin Pharmacopoeia's in 1864 creating the [[British Pharmacopoeia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowen|first=David|year=|title=The Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1034260/pdf/medhist00187-0041.pdf|journal=Medical History|volume=1|pages=123–39|via=|pmc=1034260|pmid=13417895|doi=10.1017/s0025727300021049}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The precedence for creating a pharmacopoeia went back to 1618 when the College of Physicians of London created their own London Pharmacopoeia to regulate the manufacture of medicine.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rcpe.ac.uk/heritage/manual-medicine-edinburgh-pharmacopoeia|title=A Manual for Medicine: The Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia was created in a period of tension between physicians and surgeons and the College of Physicians in Edinburgh sought to regulate the practice of medicine by providing standardized recipes. The first item in the College of Physician's minutes in 1682 note the need for a committee for creating a pharmacopoeia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The committee for the creation of the pharmacopoeia struggled for the next seventeen years, finally agreeing upon a text and publishing the first edition of the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia in 1699. The first edition was rife with dispute amongst the College of Physicians. [[Robert Sibbald]] was a main figure in its eventual publication, however the College divided into two camps; the 'new science' and Sibbald's dated faction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Members of the College not only disagreed on content of the pharmacopoeia, but style and structure as well.

== Revision ==
Unlike the London Pharmacopoeia, the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia went through many editions and revisions. In the 142 years from initial publication to the merging into the British Pharmacopoeia, the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia had twelve acknowledged editions, the last two in English.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Opposition to revision argued that it made the pharmacopoeia appear unstable but proponents argued it kept the pharmacopoeia relevant with scientific and medical developments. The last two editions were published in English under the title ''The Pharmacopoeia of the Royal College of Physicians of Edinburgh''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; From 1864, the Edinburgh Pharmacopoeia combined with the London and Dublin editions to create the [[British Pharmacopoeia]], which is still in circulation today.

A '''feuilleton''' ({{IPA-fr|fœjtɔ̃}}; a [[diminutive]] of {{lang-fr|[[wikt:feuillet|feuillet]]}}, the leaf of a book) was originally a kind of supplement attached to the [[politics|political]] portion of [[List of newspapers in France|French newspapers]], consisting chiefly of non-political news and gossip, [[literature]] and [[art criticism]], a chronicle of the latest fashions, and epigrams, charades and other literary trifles. The term ''feuilleton'' was invented by the editors of the French ''[[Journal des débats]]''; [[Julien Louis Geoffroy]] and [[Bertin the Elder]], in 1800. The feuilleton has been described as a "talk of the town",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6f3gwMbvz-sC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;dq=Feuilleton+%22talk+of+the+town%22 248]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and a contemporary English-language example of the form is the "Talk of the Town" section of ''[[The New Yorker]].''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/mar/08/featuresreviews.guardianreview5 Walter Benjamin meets Monsieur Hulot], James Buchan, The Guardian, 8 March 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In English newspapers, the term instead came to refer to an installment of a [[Serial (literature)|serial story]] printed in one part of a newspaper. The genre of the feuilleton in its French sense was eventually included in English newspapers, but was not referred to as a feuilleton.

In contemporary French, ''feuilleton'' has taken on the meaning "[[soap opera]]".

[[Germany|German]] and [[Poland|Polish]] newspapers still use the term for their literary and arts sections.

== History ==
[[File:Helsingfors-Dagblad-17-02-1889-P-2.jpg|thumb|right|A page from the Finnish newspaper ''Helsingfors Dagblad'' (1889), showing a "ground floor" feuilleton.]]
A supplement called "Feuilleton" appeared for the first time of 28 January 1800 in the ''[[Journal des Debats]]'' magazine. The word "feuilleton" meant "a leaf", or, in this sense, "a scrap of paper". Soon the supplement became the regular column devoted to entertainment and cultural issues. It is important to note that the English term "column" means both a part of a paper and the kind of press genre.

The original ''feuilletons'' were not usually printed on a separate sheet, but merely separated from the political part of the newspaper by a line, and printed in smaller type. The slot was therefore nicknamed, throughout the 19th century in France, as the "ground floor".

In 1836 the Paris newspaper ''[[La Presse (French newspaper)|La Presse]]'' first began to circulate a separate sheet from the paper entitled "Feuilleton" in which cultural items were included. This  French development of the idea was then subsequently taken up by the Director of ''[[Die Presse]]'' of [[Vienna]] and the "Feuilleton" soon became commonly used in several other newspapers in Vienna.

At the turn of 19th and 20th century the traditional connection between the name "feuilleton" and the specific place in the magazine became weaker. From that point the term "feuilleton" has been associated only with the textual properties of the publication.

The changes in the functioning of the term "feuilleton" did not have much influence on the traditional features of the genre. Newspapers, for their part, have preserved its cyclical nature and the mark of it is the publication of a series of articles always in the same part of a magazine with additional use of different ways of signaling its cyclical nature (''e.g.'', permanent vignettes, titles of columns, established forms of typesetting, etc.).

Prominent exterior features are an additional way for readers to identify the ''feuilleton'' as a particular genre, even when its structural features seem to be insufficient to defining it as such.

The radio equivalent of a ''feuilleton'' is a fixed position of a slot in the time layout of the transmitted programme and the use of different kinds of conventionalized signals, like the author’s own voice, the same title of a slot, etc.

The French form remains quite popular in Continental Europe, as witness the works of many popular Czech authors, such as [[Jan Neruda]], [[Karel Čapek]] and [[Ludvík Vaculík]].

Besides France, [[Russia]] in particular cultivated the ''feuilleton'' genre since the 19th century, and the word ''фельетон'' {{IPA-ru|fʲɪlʲjɪˈton|}} acquired the general meaning of satirical piece in the Russian language.

In [[Poland|Polish]] press terminology the term ''feuilleton'' (Polish: ''felieton'') meant a regular, permanent column in a magazine where episodes of novels, serial press publications (e.g., "Chronicles" by [[Boleslaw Prus]] in "Kurier Warszawski") and other items on entertainment and cultural issues were published.

Such a definition and use of a column still function in German and French press terminology.

In Yiddish a ''feuilleton'' was generally humorous and informal in tone. Two famous writers of Yiddish feuilletons were [[Sholem Aleichem]] and the Tunkeler, [[Yosef Tunkel]].

==Style ==
The ''feuilleton'' is a writing genre that allows for much journalistic freedom as far as its content, composition and style are concerned; the text is hybrid which means that it makes use of different genre structures, both journalistic and literary. The characteristic of a column is also the lack of the group of fixed features in strong structural relation.

Thematic domain of a ''feuilleton'' column tends to be always up-to-date, focusing specifically on cultural, social and moral issues. An accented and active role by the columnist as the subject of the narration is also very important characteristic of this genre. The tone of its writing is usually reflexive, humorous, ironic and above all very subjective in drawing conclusions, assessments and comments on a particular subject.

Unlike other common journalistic genres, the ''feuilleton'' style is very close to literary. Its characteristic feature is lightness and wit evidenced by wordplay, parody, paradox and humorous hyperboles. The vocabulary is usually not neutral, and strongly emotionally loaded words and phrases prevail.

A contemporary example of the form can be found at the online literary magazine PANK, in their column ''A Forsley Feuilleton''.

==References in literary works==

In the novel ''[[The Glass Bead Game]]'' (1943), by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning novelist [[Hermann Hesse]], the current era is characterised and described as "The Age of the Feuilleton".&lt;ref&gt;Hesse, Hermann. ''Das Glasperlenspiel: Versuch einer Lebensbeschreibung des Magister Ludi Josef Knecht samt Knechts hinterlassenen Schriftens''. Frankfurt am Main: Suhrkamp, 2003. {{ISBN|3-518-41335-X}}. p. 16-17. "Die geistige Bewegung, deren Früchte unter vielen anderen die Einrichtung des Ordens und das Glasperlenspiel sind, hat ihre Anfänge in einer Geschichtsperiode, welcher seit der grundlegenden Untersuchungen des Literarhistorikers Plinius Ziegenhals den von ihm geprägten Namen 'Das Feuilletonistische Zeitalter' trägt." &lt;/ref&gt;  In Hesse's novel, this so-called age of the feuilleton, viewed retrospectively from a future scholarly society called [[Castalia]], is generally but not simply portrayed as having an overweening, trivializing or obfuscating character such as is associated with the arbitrary and primitive nature of social production prior to the historical denouement that resulted in the creation of Castalia. The bourgeois feuilleton of the [[Belle Époque]], especially in France during the period of the [[Dreyfus affair]], as well as those of Fascist Germany, served to effect ''Kulturpolitik''; they established norms and tastes, contributed to the formation of social identity, and often expressed an underlying antisemitism. ''Glasperlenspiel'' was written during World War II, and Hesse would have been reacting in part to these real historical developments.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
In Maxim Gorky's novel "Foma Gordeev" the character Ezhóff is described as a feuilleton writer.

==Trivia==
* ''Feuilleton'', op. 293, is a waltz by [[Johann Strauss II]]. It was composed for the third annual dance of the association of authors and journalists of Vienna, which took place in Sofienbad-Saal on January&amp;nbsp;24, 1865.
* [[Felix Salten|Felix Salten’s]] books ''[[Bambi, a Life in the Woods|Bambi]]'', ''[[Neue Menschen auf alter Erde]]'', and ''[[Fünf Minuten Amerika]]'' were first published as feuilletons in ''Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung'' and ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.
* Feuilleton was the winning word for Ansun Sujoe in the 2014 [[Scripps National Spelling Bee]]. He was announced co-champion along with Sriram Hathwar; a feat that had not happened since 1962.
* In the novel ''[[Against the Day]]'' by [[Thomas Pynchon]], the Chums of Chance's pet [[dog]] Pugnax reads a roman-feuilleton by M. Eugene Sue "in the original French".

'''Greenfield Village''' was an [[Amtrak]] station in [[Dearborn, Michigan]] served by the ''[[Wolverine (train)|Wolverine]]''. It closed to regular seasonal service in 2006 and to all service in 2014. The station had a single [[side platform]] serving one of the two tracks of the [[Michigan Line]]. A pedestrian crossing from the platform led to the [[The Henry Ford]] at Smiths Creek Depot on the parallel [[Weiser Railroad]].

==History==
[[File:Platform at Greenfield Village station, August 10, 2015.jpg|thumb|left|The closed platform in 2015]]
Prior to 2006, the station was a regular, but seasonal stop (summer only).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timetables.org/full.php?group=20050425&amp;item=0083|title=Amtrak System Timetable: Spring 2005 - Summer 2005|page=80|date=25 Apr 2005|accessdate=19 Nov 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 2006, the station was only used for reserved tour groups of 20 or more people, similar to [[Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park#Amtrak station|Colonel Allensworth State Historic Park station]] in California.

Amtrak's main station in Dearborn, opened in 1978, was located well east of the downtown area, thus requiring a separate stop to serve The Henry Ford. Dearborn station and Greenfield Village station were replaced by the new [[John D. Dingell Transit Center]], located {{convert|0.4|miles}} to the west of Greenfield Village station at a different entrance to The Henry Ford. The new station opened on December 10, 2014, and Greenfield Village station was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawrence|first1=Eric|title=First train pulls out of new Dearborn Amtrak station|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2014/12/10/amtrak-opens-new-train-station-dearborn/20195409/|accessdate=11 December 2014|work=[[The Detroit Free Press]]|date=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Guajona''' ({{IPA-xx|ɡwaˈhona|[[Cantabrian dialect|Cantabrian]]}}; {{IPA-es|ɡwaˈxona|lang}}) or '''Lumia''' is a [[hematophagy|blood-sucking]] creature of [[Cantabrian people|Cantabrian]] legends, resembling a disfigured human female, resembling to an extent the witches and hags of medieval European folklore, with features specific to her feeding habits. 
She is covered from head to toe in an old thin black cloak, her hands and feet are gnarled bird legs, her face is yellow with consumed, rough and hairy warts, her eyes are tiny and bright as stars, aquiline nose and mouth provided with a single black razor sharp tooth that is so long it reach down to her under chin and used to suck blood. Only comes out at night and hides in the shadows but it is unknown where she sleeps during the day although it is suspected to be hiding underground. Guajona come in homes without getting noticed and walks silently toward healthy young children to suck their blood in their sleep by sticking her tooth into their veins. She does not kill them, instead leaves them almost bloodless so when they wake up in the morning they will be tired, pale and discolored. Guajona also attacks adults. This is one of the few myths or legends about vampires that exist in Spain, next to the [[Conde Estruch]].

==Etymology==
Guajona is an augmentative of Guaja, present also in the neighbour Asturian mythology as [[Guaxa]]. The origin of Guaja or Guaxa could be in classical Arabic وحش ''wahsh'', meaning "beast".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=García Arias|first=Xosé Lluis|title=Arabismos nel dominiu llingüísticu Ástur|year=2006|publisher=Academia de la Llingua Asturiana|location=Uviéu|isbn=84-8168-405-8|pages=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tNWSLSNEq20C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Henry Bradshaw Society''' is a British-based [[text publication society]] founded in 1890 for the scholarly editing and publication of rare liturgical texts.

==Foundation==
An initial meeting to plan the Henry Bradshaw Society took place in London on 3 July 1890, after which provisional subscriptions were solicited. The general meeting to inaugurate the Society took place on 25 November 1890 in the [[Jerusalem Chamber]] at [[Westminster Abbey]]. A committee was finalised and a programme of publications worked out.

One of the models for the society was the Durham-based [[Surtees Society]], formed in 1834, which in turn received assistance from officers of the [[Bannatyne Club]]. The foundation of the new society was also linked, more by overlapping interests than organizational models, to the body then known as the [[Cambridge Camden Society|St Paul's Ecclesiological Society]]. [[John Wickham Legg]], who had played a significant role in the re-establishment of that society in 1879 after a decade or so of limbo, also became an important founding member of the Henry Bradshaw Society.

The Society was named after [[Henry Bradshaw (scholar)|Henry Bradshaw]] (1831–1886), Librarian of the [[Cambridge University Library]], who had been interested in early printing and in bibliographic description. This latter passion led to his becoming familiar with many European libraries, where he also became aware of holdings of early English liturgical manuscripts.

The promised subscribers including many Anglican bishops and other dignitaries, but also [[Léopold Delisle]] of the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris, [[Antonio Maria Ceriani]] of the [[Ambrosian Library]], [[Milan]] and others Catholics such as [[W.H. James Weale]], [[Edmund Bishop]], Dom [[Aidan Gasquet]], the abbé [[Louis Duchesne]], and Dom [[Hildebrand de Hemptinne]], abbot of [[Maredsous Abbey|Maredsous]]. The first volumes were to be printed in 500 copies and at the next meeting the Council fixed the individual subscription rate as 12 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (£12 12[[Shilling|s]]).

==Editions==
By the end of the 19th century some 19 volumes had been issued, three of which contained an edition of the ''Westminster Missal'', given to the abbey by Abbot [[Nicholas Lytlington]], abbot 1362-1386, and builder of the Jerusalem Chamber, where the Society was publicly launched.

Other early editions were of the coronation rites of King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1892), the ''Martiloge in Englysshe'' (1893), the ''[[Antiphonary of Bangor]]'' (1893–6; from the Ambrosian Library), the ''Tracts of [[Clement Maydeston]]'' (1894), the ''[[Winchester Troper]]'', the ''Martyrology of Gorman'' (1895; from the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], Brussels), the ''Missal of [[Robert of Jumièges]]'' (1896; from Rouen public library), the ''Irish [[Liber Hymnorum]]'' (1898; from [[Trinity College Library]], Dublin),  the ''Rosslyn Missal'' (1899; from the [[Advocates Library]], Edinburgh), the ''Coronation Book of [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] of France'' (1899; [[British Library]], Cotton Tiberius MS B.VIII), the ''Missale Romanum'', printed in Milan in 1474 (1899–1907) and the fifteenth-century ''Processional of the Nuns of Chester'' (1899).

Although the Society fell into something of a slump after the Second World War, it was revived with some vigour in the 1980s. The latest volume to be published, in 2013, is numbered 120.

==Current officers==
The Society's principal honorary officers currently include: 
*President: the Right Reverend Abbot Dom [[Cuthbert Johnson]], OSB
*Chairman of Council: Professor Susan Rankin

He was the fifth and last child of [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]] and [[Hyacinthe-Gabrielle Roland]].  His parents married, but after all their children were born, so Wellesley's sons could not inherit his titles.&lt;ref name=Compendium/&gt;

Wellesley was Principal of Oxford University's [[New Inn Hall]], curator of the [[Bodleian Library]], curator of [[Ashmolean Museum]] and [[Taylor Institute]].&lt;ref name=Compendium/&gt;

Two of the books he is known for are ''Anthologica Polyglotta'' (1849) and ''Stray Notes of Shakespeare'' (1865).&lt;ref name=BiblicalCyclopaedia/&gt;

== History ==
The company was established in August 2002 after [[Patrick Spain]], who had just sold [[Hoover's]], which he had co-founded, bought [[eLibrary]] and [[Encyclopedia.com]] from [[Tucows]]. The new company was called Alacritude, LLC (a combination of Alacrity and Attitude). ELibrary had a library of 1,200 newspaper, magazine and radio/TV transcript archives that were generally not freely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/about-us|title=About Us|website=HighBeam Research|accessdate=March 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Original investors included Prism Opportunity Fund of Chicago and 1 to 1 Ventures of [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Connecticut]].

Spain stated, "There was a glaring gap between free search like [[Google]] and high-end offerings like [[LexisNexis]] and [[Factiva]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetnews.com/fina-news/article.php/3315981|title=Q&amp;A: Patrick Spain, Founder HighBeam|work=[[InterNetNews]]|date=February 20, 2004|accessdate=October 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1577 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|right|x300px|The title page of the 1577 first edition of Holinshed's ''Chronicles'']]

'''''Holinshed's Chronicles''''', also known as '''''Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland''''', is a collaborative work published in several volumes and two editions, the first in 1577, and the second in 1587. It was a large, comprehensive description of [[British history]]. 

The ''Chronicles'' are a source of interest to many because of their extensive links to [[Shakespeare]]'s plays.

== Description ==
In 1548, [[Reginald Wolfe]], a London printer, conceived the idea of creating a "Universal Cosmography of the whole world, and therewith also certain particular histories of every known nation". He wanted the work to be printed in English and he wanted maps and illustrations in the book as well. Wolfe acquired many of [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]]'s works, and with these he constructed chronologies and drew maps that were up-to-date. When Wolfe realised he could not complete this project on his own, he hired [[Raphael Holinshed]] and [[William Harrison (priest)|William Harrison]] to assist him.

[[File:1587 printing of Holinshed's Chronicles.jpg|thumb|right|x300px|Title page of the second edition]]
Wolfe died with the work still uncompleted in 1573, and the project—changed to a work specifically about the British Isles—was run by a consortium of three members of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|London stationers]]. They retained Holinshed, who employed Harrison, [[Richard Stanyhurst]], [[Edmund Campion]] and [[John Hooker (English constitutionalist)|John Hooker]]. In 1577, the work was published in two volumes after some censorship by the [[Privy Council]] of some of Stanyhurst's contribution on Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomfeb05.html (King's College London) Holinshed's ''Chronicles''] February 2005. Accessed 1 June 2008. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706031438/http://www.kcl.ac.uk/depsta/iss/library/speccoll/bomarch/bomfeb05.html |date=July 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence on Shakespeare ==
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is widely believed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/holinsheds-chronicles-1577 |title=Holinshed's Chronicles, 1577 - The British Library |website=Bl.uk |date=2015-11-23 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; to have used the revised second edition of the ''Chronicles'' (published in 1587) as the source for most of his [[Shakespearean history|history plays]], the plot of ''[[Macbeth]]'', and for portions of ''[[King Lear]]'' and ''[[Cymbeline]]''.

Several other playwrights, such as [[Christopher Marlowe]], used the ''Chronicles'' as a source.

=== The ''Chronicles'' and ''Macbeth'' ===
[[File:Macbeth and Banquo encountering the witches - Holinshed Chronicles.gif|thumb|left|A generic picture of Lords meeting Ladies, used amongst other things for illustrating "[[Macbeth, King of Scotland|Macbeth]] and [[Banquo]] encountering the witches" in the first edition of ''Holinshed's Chronicles'']]

Shakespeare used Holinshed's work extensively in ''Macbeth'', but in modified form. An instance is the [[Three Witches]], whom Holinshed describes as "creatures of the elderwood ... nymphs or fairies". Nymphs and fairies are generally viewed as beautiful and youthful, but Shakespeare's three witches in ''Macbeth'' are ugly, dark, and bizarre. It is believed that he made the change to heighten the suspense and darkness of the play.&lt;ref name="shakespeare-online1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare-online.com/sources/macbethsources2.html |title=Shakespeare's Sources for Macbeth: Holinshed and Witches |website=Shakespeare-online.com |date=2000-08-20 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Chronicles'' lacked any description of Macbeth's character, so Shakespeare improvised on several points.&lt;ref name="shakespeare-online1"/&gt; The characters [[Banquo]] and [[Fleance]] were also taken from Holinshed’s works, but they are now considered to be inventions of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakespeare.nowheres.com/faq/faq37.php |title=shakespeare.com FAQ |website=Shakespeare.nowheres.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They allow a better visual association between the codes and the country names than the two-letter [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|alpha-2]] codes (the third set of codes is [[ISO 3166-1 numeric|numeric]] and hence offers no visual association).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/iso_3166-faqs/iso_3166_faqs_general.htm| title=ISO 3166 –  FAQs –  General questions| publisher=International Organization for Standardization (ISO)}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were first included as part of the ISO 3166 standard in its first edition in 1974.

==Uses and applications==
The ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 codes are used most prominently in ISO/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] 7501-1 for [[machine-readable passport]]s, as standardized by the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]], with a number of additional codes for special passports; some of these codes are currently [[#Codes currently agreed not to use|reserved and not used at the present stage]] in ISO 3166-1.&lt;ref name="icao"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.airports.org/aci/aci/file/ACI_Priorities/Security/ICAO%20State%203%20letter%20codes.pdf| title=Appendix 7 to Section IV –  Three-letter codes| work=Doc 9303, Machine Readable Travel Documents, Part I –  Machine Readable Passports, Volume I –  Passports with Machine Readable Data Stored in Optical Character Recognition Format| pages=IV-43–IV-46| publisher=International Civil Aviation Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] uses a combination of ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 and alpha-3 codes, along with codes that pre-date the creation of ISO 3166, for [[List of international vehicle registration codes|international vehicle registration codes]], which are codes used to identify the issuing country of a vehicle registration plate; some of these codes are currently [[#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminately reserved]] in ISO 3166-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unece.org/trans/conventn/Distsigns.pdf| title=Distinguishing signs used on vehicles in international traffic| publisher=United Nations Economic Commission for Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User-assigned code elements===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
User-assigned code elements are codes at the disposal of users who need to add further names of countries, territories, or other geographical entities to their in-house application of ISO 3166-1, and the ISO 3166/MA will never use these codes in the updating process of the standard. The following alpha-3 codes can be user-assigned: {{mono|AAA}} to {{mono|AAZ}}, {{mono|QMA}} to {{mono|QZZ}}, {{mono|XAA}} to {{mono|XZZ}}, and {{mono|ZZA}} to {{mono|ZZZ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html| title=Glossary for ISO 3166 - Codes for countries and their subdivisions| publisher=ISO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Examples ====
The following codes are used in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for special [[machine-readable passport]]s:&lt;ref name="icao" /&gt;

* {{mono|EUE}}  is used for the [[European Union laissez-passer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.laissez-passer.eu|title=European Union laissez-passer (video at 0:47)|website=Laissez-passer.eu|accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{mono|XOM}} is used to represent the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]
* {{mono|XPO}} is used for [[Interpol passport|Interpol travel documents]]
* {{mono|XXA}} is used to represent a [[statelessness|stateless person]], as defined in Article 1 of the [[1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]]
* {{mono|XXB}} is used to represent a [[refugee]], as defined in Article 1 of the 1951 [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] as amended by the 1967 Protocol
* {{mono|XXC}} is used to represent a refugee, other than as defined above
* {{mono|XXX}} is used to represent a person of unspecified nationality
* {{mono|WSA}} is used for the [[World Service Authority]] [[World Passport]] (The World Service Authority World Passport contains "WSA" as the authority code. It has been filed with the International Civil Aviation Organization, but does not appear in official ICAO documents as valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/9303_p2_cons_en.pdf|format=PDF|title=Doc 9303 : Machine Readable Travel Documents|page=III-1-4|website=Icao.int|accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

[[List of NATO country codes|NATO STANAG 1059 INT]] is built upon ISO alpha-3 codes, but also defines alpha-2 codes incompatible with ISO 3166-1. It introduces several private use codes for fictional countries and organizational entities:

* {{mono|XXB}} "Brownland"
* {{mono|XXG}} "Greyland"
* {{mono|XXI}} "Indigoland"
* {{mono|XXL}} "Limeland"
* {{mono|XXP}} "Purpleland"
* {{mono|XXR}} "Redland"
* {{mono|XXW}} "Whiteland"
* {{mono|XXY}} "Yellowland"
* {{mono|XXE}} [[SHAPE]]
* {{mono|XXM}} NATO
* {{mono|XXN}} NATO "Blue" Command

* {{mono|EEE}} Europe
* {{mono|FFF}} Africa
* {{mono|NNN}} North America
* {{mono|SRR}} South America
* {{mono|UUU}} Oceania
* {{mono|NTT}} NATO countries

There are also three differences:

* {{mono|FYR}} vs. {{mono|MKD}} Macedonia
* {{mono|MAL}} vs. {{mono|MLI}} Mali
* {{mono|TZA}} vs. {{mono|TZN}} Tanzania
&lt;!--
Differences and omissions from 9th edition (2005) due to subsequent updates to ISO 3166-1:

* ALA, BLM, GGY, IMN, JEY, MAF, MYT, SSD not present
* {{mono|ACI}} Ashmore and Cartier Islands
* {{mono|ANT}} Netherland Antilles vs. BES Caribbean Netherlands: Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, Saba + CUW Curaçao + SXM Sint Maarten

===Reserved code elements===&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Reserved code elements are codes which have become obsolete, or are required in order to enable a particular user application of the standard but do not qualify for inclusion in ISO 3166-1. To avoid transitional application problems and to aid users who require specific additional code elements for the functioning of their coding systems, the ISO 3166/MA, when justified, reserves these codes which it undertakes not to use for other than specified purposes during a limited or indeterminate period of time. The reserved alpha-3 codes can be divided into the following four categories: [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptional reservations]], [[#Transitional reservations|transitional reservations]], [[#Indeterminate reservations|indeterminate reservations]], and [[#Codes currently agreed not to use|codes currently agreed not to use]].

====Exceptional reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Exceptionally reserved code elements are codes reserved at the request of national ISO member bodies, governments and international organizations, which are required in order to support a particular application, as specified by the requesting body and limited to such use; any further use of such code elements is subject to approval by the ISO 3166/MA. The following alpha-3 codes are currently exceptionally reserved:

* {{mono|ASC}} [[Ascension Island]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[Universal Postal Union|Universal Postal Union (UPU)]], also used by [[International Telecommunication Union|International Telecommunication Union (ITU)]]
* {{mono|CPT}} [[Clipperton Island]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]
* {{mono|DGA}} [[Diego Garcia]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]
* {{mono|FXX}} [[Metropolitan France|France, Metropolitan]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[France]]; Officially assigned before being deleted from ISO 3166-1
* {{mono|SUN}} [[Soviet Union|USSR]]{{snd}} From June 2008; Transitionally reserved from September 1992; Officially assigned before being deleted from ISO 3166-1
* {{mono|TAA}} [[Tristan da Cunha]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]]

The following alpha-3 codes were previously exceptionally reserved, but are now officially assigned:

* {{mono|GGY}} [[Guernsey]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]]
* {{mono|IMN}} [[Isle of Man]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]]
* {{mono|JEY}} [[Jersey]]{{snd}} Reserved on request of [[Universal Postal Union|UPU]]

====Transitional reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Transitional reserved code elements are codes reserved after their deletion from ISO 3166-1. These codes may be used only during a transitional period of at least five years while new code elements that may have replaced them are taken into use. These codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA after the expiration of the transitional period. The following alpha-3 codes are currently transitionally reserved:

* {{mono|ANT}} [[Netherlands Antilles]]{{snd}} From December 2010
* {{mono|BUR}} [[Burma]]{{snd}} From December 1989
* {{mono|BYS}} [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]]{{snd}} From June 1992
* {{mono|CSK}} [[Czechoslovakia]]{{snd}} From June 1993
* {{mono|NTZ}} [[Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone|Neutral Zone]]{{snd}} From July 1993
* {{mono|ROM}} [[Romania]]{{snd}} From February 2002; Code changed to {{mono|ROU}}&lt;ref name="Romania"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_v-3_romania.pdf |title = RE: Change of alpha-3 Code Element |author = ISO International Organization for Standardization, ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency |date = 1 February 2002 |work = ISO 3166-1 NEWSLETTER No. V-3 |accessdate = 26 June 2017 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110722001502/http://www.iso.org/iso/newsletter_v-3_romania.pdf |archivedate = 2011-07-22 |quote = Description of change: Change of the alpha-3 Code element for Romania from ROM to ROU following a request of the Government of Romania.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{mono|SCG}} [[Serbia and Montenegro]]{{snd}} From September 2006
* {{mono|TMP}} [[East Timor]]{{snd}} From May 2002
* {{mono|YUG}} [[Yugoslavia]]{{snd}} From July 2003
* {{mono|ZAR}} [[Zaire]]{{snd}} From July 1997

====Indeterminate reservations====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
Indeterminately reserved code elements are [[List of international vehicle registration codes|codes used to designate road vehicles]] under the 1949 and [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic|1968 United Nations Conventions on Road Traffic]] but differing from those contained in ISO 3166-1. These code elements are expected eventually to be either eliminated or replaced by code elements within ISO 3166-1. In the meantime, the ISO 3166/MA has reserved such code elements for an indeterminate period. Any use beyond the application of the two Conventions is discouraged and will not be approved by the ISO 3166/MA. Moreover, these codes may be reassigned by the ISO 3166/MA at any time. The following alpha-3 codes are currently indeterminately reserved:

* {{mono|ADN}} [[Aden Protectorate|Aden]]
* {{mono|BDS}} [[Barbados]]
* {{mono|BRU}} [[Brunei]]
* {{mono|CDN}} [[Canada]]
* {{mono|EAK}} [[Kenya]]

* {{mono|RSM}} [[San Marino]]
* {{mono|RSR}} [[Rhodesia|Southern Rhodesia]] [now Zimbabwe]
* {{mono|SLO}} [[Slovenia]]

* {{mono|WAG}} [[The Gambia|Gambia]]
* {{mono|WAL}} [[Sierra Leone]]
* {{mono|WAN}} [[Nigeria]]
* {{mono|ZRE}} [[Zaire|Zaire, People's Republic of]]

The following alpha-3 code was previously indeterminately reserved, but has been reassigned to another country as its official code:

* {{mono|ROU}} [[Uruguay]]{{snd}} Code reassigned to [[Romania]]

====Codes currently agreed not to use====&lt;!--This section is linked from [[ISO 3166-1]]--&gt;
In addition, the ISO 3166/MA will not use the following alpha-3 codes at the present stage, as they are used in ISO/IEC 7501-1 for special [[machine-readable passport]]s:

* {{mono|GBD}} identifies a British Passport holder who is a [[British Overseas Territories citizen]]
* {{mono|GBN}} identifies a British Passport holder who is a [[British National (Overseas)]]
* {{mono|GBO}} identifies a British Passport holder who is a [[British Overseas citizen]]
* {{mono|GBP}} identifies a British Passport holder who is a [[British protected person]]
* {{mono|GBS}} identifies a British Passport holder who is a [[British subject]]
* {{mono|UNA}} is used as a substitute for nationality where the holder is an Official of a [[List of specialized agencies of the United Nations|Specialized Agency of the UN Organization]]
* {{mono|UNK}} identifies [[Kosovo]] residents to whom [[UNMIK Travel Document|travel documents]] were issued by the [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|United Nations Interim Administration in Kosovo]] (UNMIK)
* {{mono|UNO}} is used to designate the [[United Nations|UN Organization]] as the issuer and used as a substitute for nationality where the holder is an Official of the UN Organization

==Deleted codes==
Besides the codes currently [[#Transitional reservations|transitionally reserved]] and two other codes currently [[#Exceptional reservations|exceptionally reserved]] ({{mono|FXX}} for [[Metropolitan France|France, Metropolitan]] and {{mono|SUN}} for [[Soviet Union|USSR]]), the following alpha-3 codes have also been deleted from ISO 3166-1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.davros.org/misc/iso3166.html#disused| title=Country codes in ISO 3166 (Table 2: codes withdrawn from use)| author=Clive Feather|website=Davros.org| date=2003-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Pintard, Jr.''' (May 18, 1759 – June 21, 1844) was an American [[merchant]] and [[philanthropist]].

==Biography==
He was a descendant of [[Antoine Pintard]], a [[Huguenot]] from La Rochelle, [[France]]. He was orphaned when his mother died when he was "a fortnight old" and his father died when he was about eighteen months old.&lt;ref&gt;according to p 102 of "Letters from John Pintard".&lt;/ref&gt; His father, John, was a seagoing merchant, and his mother was Mary Cannon. He was raised by his uncle, Lewis Pintard, and attended grammar school under the Reverend [[Leonard Cutting]] at [[Hempstead, New York]].
[[File:John and Elizabeth Pintard, by John Ramage.jpg|thumb|left|John and Elizabeth Pintard ([[John Ramage (artist)|John Ramage]], 1787)]]
He attended the College at New Jersey (which later became [[Princeton University]]), but left school to join the patriot forces when the British arrived at [[New York (state)|New York]]. He went on various expeditions to harass the enemy. He returned to school briefly and received the degree of A.B. in 1776. He served as deputy commissary of prisoners at New York under his uncle Lewis. His duties were to examine and relieve the wants of the prisoners. On November 12, 1784, he married Elizabeth Brashear, daughter of Colonel [[Abraham Brashear]] of [[Paramus, New Jersey]].

Pintard had inherited a legacy from his maternal grandfather, John Cannon, and this allowed him to go into the [[China]] and East India trade. Like his father and his grandfather before him, John served as an alderman to the City of New York. He was rated as one of New York's most successful and prosperous merchants when in 1792 he lost his fortune by engaging with William Duer in [[Alexander Hamilton]]’s scheme to fund the national debt. He had personally endorsed notes for over a million dollars and was imprisoned for the debt. John Pintard resided in [[Newark, New Jersey]] for eight years and declared bankruptcy in New York. He never recovered his old fortune, but his position and respect in the community enabled him to contribute generously to the projects he sponsored.

In 1803, John Pintard went to [[New Orleans]] to seek his fortune but decided not to settle there. He filed a very favorable report of the French colony to [[Albert Gallatin]], secretary of the treasury, and minister to France [[James Monroe]], a relative by marriage to his wife's aunt. Pintard's report was instrumental in convincing [[Thomas Jefferson]] to purchase the [[Louisiana Territory]]. He served as first city inspector of New York City for many years after 1804,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WtFm4qA0eJQC&amp;pg=PA506&amp;lpg=PA506&amp;dq=%22first+city+inspector%22+of+new+orleans&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y-RwAHSb8V&amp;sig=0RMpMCxMzzoSr0BeUY4FHgEjvgU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OxPjT-mIHc6r2AXW293jCw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22first%20city%20inspector%22%20of%20new%20orleans&amp;f=false ''History of the City of New York; Its Origin Rise, and Progress''  by Mrs. Martha J. Lamb and Mrs. Burton Harrison, p.506]&lt;/ref&gt; and was authorized by the corporation of New York to issue fractional notes during the War of 1812.

John was secretary of the Mutual Assurance Company from 1809 to 1829. From 1819 to 1829 he served as secretary of the New York Chamber of Commerce. He served as treasurer of the Sailor's Snug Harbor from 1819 to 1823 and was instrumental in the purchase of the property on [[Staten Island]] where the home is now located. He also was a founder of the [[New York Historical Society]] and the [[Massachusetts Historical Society]]. John Pintard served as manager of the state lotteries and was first sagamore of the [[Tammany Society]].  He was also elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistp American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1832 he was in [[New York City]] during the [[second cholera pandemic (1829–51)|second cholera pandemic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[John Noble Wilford]] |coauthors= |title=How Epidemics Helped Shape the Modern Metropolis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/15/science/15chol.html?&amp;module=Search&amp;mabReward=relbias%3Ar%2C%7B%222%22%3A%22RI%3A17%22%7D |quote=Unlike most upper-class residents, John Pintard, the respected civic leader who was the historical society’s founder, remained in the stricken city. ... |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 15, 2008 |accessdate=2014-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 19, 1805 he began the efforts which became the present free school system in New York. He was also active in the movement that resulted in the building and completion of the [[Erie Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/knickerbocker/&lt;/ref&gt; John Pintard surveyed the plans for the streets and avenues in upper New York City. A deeply religious man, he was one of the chief supporters of the General Theological Seminary and helped found the American Bible Society, which he always called his "brat." He was vestryman for the Huguenot Church of New York City for thirty-four years and his translation of the "Book of Common Prayer" from English to French is still used today. In 1822, the degree of LL.D. was conferred on him by [[Allegheny College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionarywararchives.org/pintard.html John Pintard Witness to the Revolution by Kerry J. Davidson, Sr.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pintard was an active Freemason, serving as Master for his Lodge in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Bicentenial Commemorative Volume of Holland Lodge No. 8, Published by the Lodge, New York, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:St Nicholas by John Pintard (1810).jpg|thumb|St. Nicholas by John Pintard (1810)]]

Perhaps his greatest contribution to American society, however, was his role in establishing the modern popular conception of [[Santa Claus]] based upon the Dutch legend of [[Sinterklaas]]. His papers demonstrate that he personally observed the feast of [[St. Nicholas]] in an era when such remembrances were still frequently considered "hagiolatry" in America and when almanacs of the day omitted reference to such a feast day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stnicholascenter.org/pages/knickerbocker/ Knickerbocker Santa Claus]&lt;/ref&gt; His publication in 1810 of a pamphlet proposing St. Nicholas as the [[patron saint]] of New York City, and Patron Saint of his newly established New York Historical Society became a theme just following his friend [[Washington Irving]] publishing  The History of Old New York in 1809, (itself coming from Irving's January 25, 1808 article in Salmagundi magazine).  Irving's publication being the first widely published record of Santa Claus as St. Nicholas in New Amsterdam (old New York City), and Pintard lending gravitas to the cause of St. Nicholas for many years to follow.

According to Dr. [[Niels Henry Sonne]], former director of the library, John Pintard also was a patron of the library of the [[General Theological Seminary]] in New York, and helped establish their first collection of books.&lt;ref&gt;Sonne, Niels H. John Pintard and the Early Years of the General Theological Seminary Library. New York: s.n.], 1961. Reprinted with revisions from the Bulletin of the General Theological Seminary, v. 47, no. 1 (February, 1961).&lt;/ref&gt;

Blind in his later years, he died at the home of his daughter, Louise, in New York on June 21, 1844.

===Art collection===
Wilmerding began collecting art while still a student at Harvard, purchasing the 1857 painting ''Stage Rocks and Western Shore of Gloucester Outer Harbor'' by [[Fitz Hugh Lane]] during his senior year for $3,500.&lt;ref name="Vogel2004"/&gt;  His second purchase was the 1850 painting ''Mississippi Boatman'' by [[George Caleb Bingham]] "which shows a pipe-smoking boatman sitting on top of a crate," followed by "The Newbury Marshes" by [[Martin Johnson Heade]], circa 1890, which were all donated by Wilmerding to the [[National Gallery of Art]].&lt;ref name="Vogel2004"/&gt;  By 2004, he built a collection of 51 paintings and drawings by acknowledged masters.&lt;ref name="Genocchio2004"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Genocchio|first1=Benjamin|title=Small, But Beautiful|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/11/nyregion/small-but-beautiful.html|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=11 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the May 2004 opening of the [[National Gallery of Art]]'s exhibit "American Masters From Bingham to Eakins: The John Wilmerding Collection," Wilmerding announced that his entire collection would remain at the Gallery in perpetuity,&lt;ref name="Vogel2004"/&gt; including works by such artists as [[Martin Johnson Heade]], [[Fitz Henry Lane]], [[John F. Peto]], [[Joseph Decker]], [[Winslow Homer]], [[Thomas Eakins]], [[Frederic Edwin Church]], [[George Caleb Bingham]], and [[John F. Kensett]], and featuring certain of his favorite works by artists who visited and painted [[Maine]]'s [[Mount Desert Island]] in Acadia National Park, where he has summered for many years.&lt;ref name="Genocchio2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WaPo2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=John Wilmerding, Giving His Awe for American Art|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8644-2004May7_2.html|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=May 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His contribution broadened the Gallery's holdings by adding many examples of types of works that the Gallery had not yet managed to acquire.&lt;ref name="NGA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kramer2004"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kramer|first1=Hilton|title=Some Born to Collect, And John Wilmerding Apparently Was One|url=https://observer.com/2004/09/some-born-to-collect-and-john-wilmerding-apparently-was-one/|accessdate=6 March 2018|work=[[The Observer]]|date=13 September 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Livonian Rhymed Chronicle'''''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=v6CEAAAAIAAJ&amp;q The Livonian Rhymed Chronicle Published 1977, Indiana University]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-de|Livländische Reimchronik}}) is a [[chronicle]] written in [[Middle High German]] by an anonymous author. It covers the period 1180 – 1343 and contains a wealth of detail about Livonia — modern South [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]].

== The old Chronicle ==
The ''Rhymed Chronicle'' was composed to be read to the crusading knights of the [[Livonian Order]] during their meals. Its primary function was to inspire the knights and legitimise the [[Northern crusades]]. As such, it is infused with elements of romance and exaggerated for the purpose of drama. However, this is debated by A. Murray. He suggests that during mealtimes the knights were read sections of the bible or the word of God, so that they could 'receive spiritual as well as corporal nourishment'. There was little of this in the ''Chronicle''. There is also the fact that the ''Chronicle'' is written in high German, and the majority of the knights who were in Livonia at that time would have spoken low German. This would mean that they would have struggled to have understood what was being read to them anyway. Murray argues that due to its imagery used to describe the battles and its focus on military expeditions it is more likely to have served a purpose to appeal to the mentality of those who may have volunteered for service with the Sword Brothers and Teutonic Knights to encourage them to join the orders. 

== The Younger Chronicle ==
A second rhyme chronicle, known as the ''Younger Livonian Rhymed Chronicle'', was written in Low German by Bartholomäus Hoeneke, chaplain of the Master of the Livonian Order, around the end of the 1340s. It is this chronicle that narrates&lt;!--must be a joke--&gt; how Estonians slaughtered their own nobility and called the [[Livonian Order]] to Estonia, which, in turn, butchered them, on 1343. The original is lost but prose paraphrases survive.

'''Alfred George James Hayes''' (8 August 1928 – 21 July 2005) was an English [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]], [[manager (professional wrestling)|manager]] and [[Announcer|commentator]], best known for his appearances in the United States with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] between 1982 and 1995 where he was known as '''Lord Alfred Hayes'''. Hayes was distinguished by his "[[Masterpiece (TV series)|Masterpiece Theatre]] [[diction]]" and "[[Received Pronunciation|Oxford accent]]".&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{ cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2005/08/16/db1603.xml | title = Alfred Hayes | publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph]] | accessdate = 10 February 2008 | date = 16 August 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt;

==Professional wrestling career==
Born in London, Hayes attended the [[University of North London|North-Western Polytechnic]], which was evacuated to Luton Modern School during [[World War II]]. He attained a [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in judo before training as a wrestler under [[Atholl Oakley|Sir Atholl Oakley]], [[Baronet|Bt]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Wrestling as "Judo" Al Hayes, he appeared on the British circuit from the late 1950s to the late 1960s, when he left the United Kingdom and travelled to the United States.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; He was a [[Face (professional wrestling)|blue-eye]] who battled all of the heavyweight heels of his time, and held the Southern Area Heavyweight Championship for a number of years. He traded heavily on his judo background, and specialised with judo chops and nerve holds. His most famous period was when he fought for Paul Lincoln Promotions as The White Angel, with a massive feud against Dr Death. Death eventually won, and unmasked Hayes.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

===America (1970s)===
Hayes later went to wrestle in America.  In 1972, he defeated [[Dory Funk Jr.]] for the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] but the decision was changed when Funk's father [[Dory Funk|Dory Funk Sr]] attacked the referee after the match. In a fit of anger, the official disqualified Funk Jr, thus inadvertently returning the title to the champion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/13/guardianobituaries.sport|title=Obituary: 'Judo' Al Hayes|last=Morton|first=James|date=2005-08-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cauli" /&gt; Hayes also wrestled in brief stints for his future employer the WWWF, battling [[Bruno Sammartino]] for the World Heavyweight Championship on occasion.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt;

While wrestling for [[Sam Muchnick]] in [[St. Louis]] during the mid 1970s, Hayes turned heel and adopted the gimmick of the aristocratic "Lord Alfred" Hayes.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; Hayes adopted the role as a manager after he had decided wrestling was taking a toll on his knees.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; As this character, Hayes later became a manager in the [[American Wrestling Association|AWA]], [[Championship Wrestling from Florida|Florida]] and later [[Lutte Internationale|Montreal]], managing fellow Brit [[Billy Robinson]], [[Baron von Raschke]], [[Jimmy Valiant]] (whom he rebranded as "King James" Valiant) and the Super Destroyers. He became notorious for delivering TV interviews in a sneering aristocratic English accent, often sipping cups of tea and wearing a bow tie and frilly shirt.

During this period, Hayes also made a homecoming tour of the United Kingdom, including televised matches. During these bouts, he remained a heel and fought his way through most of his former tag partners. [[kayfabe|It was explained]] that Hayes had inherited the dreaded "American style" in his adopted country.

Hayes reverted to [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] and began a feud with fellow manager [[Bobby Heenan]] after an incident in November 1979 where [[Sgt. Slaughter|Super Destroyer II]] fired Hayes and replaced him with Heenan. In other territories however, Hayes remained a heel. In Florida in 1980, Hayes began managing [[Bobby Jaggers]] while his regular manager [[Oliver Humperdink]] was busy acting as [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]]' servant for thirty days (after another protege of his, [[Ivan Koloff]] lost a match to Rhodes with that stipulation.) When "Rooster" Humperdink, who had become a figure of sympathy during his thirty days servitude, returned to management and attempted to claim back Jaggers, Hayes and another protege [[Nikolai Volkoff]] brutally beat on Humperdink, thus starting a feud with Humperdink and Rhodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CWF75|title=CWF - 30 Days in the Hole - The Beatdown|date=2016-01-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n_f6up7mvA|access-date=2018-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cauli"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.caulifloweralleyclub.org/cac_finishes_alfredhayes.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305160842/http://www2.caulifloweralleyclub.org/cac_finishes_alfredhayes.htm |archivedate=5 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hayes later worked again as a heel manager for Robinson in [[Lutte Internationale]] in the early 1980s during Robinson's reign with the [[Canadian International Heavyweight Championship]].&lt;ref name="KM-14b"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/intlwrestlingmont/intlwrestlingmon14-2.htm |title=Int'l Wrestling – Montreal #14 Page #2 |author=Gleason, Daren |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oklafan.com/v4/news/7202/article.html |title=BREAKING NEWS: Legendary UK shooter Billy Robinson Dies At Age 75 |author=Magee, Bob |date=March 3, 2014 |website=Oklafan.com |publisher= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208071751/http://www.oklafan.com/v4/news/7202/article.html |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hayes also managed [[Bill Eadie|Masked Superstar]], around this time.&lt;ref name="KM-18b"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kayfabememories.com/Regions/intlwrestlingmont/intlwrestlingmon18-2.htm |title=Int'l Wrestling – Montreal #18 Page #2 |author=Gleason, Daren |date=2004 |website=KayfabeMemories.com |publisher= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Wrestling Federation (1982–1995)===
Hayes joined the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="Oliver" /&gt; Hayes started as a road agent but then started doing television for McMahon as well, starting work as an interviewer during the December 26, 1983 edition of wrestling at Madison Square Garden. He was a sidekick to [[Vince McMahon]] on ''[[Tuesday Night Titans]]'', a WWF-style talk show from 1984 to 1986.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"&gt;Figure Four Weekly #528: Lord Alfred Hayes Passes Away - August 8 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Hayes became familiar to WWF viewers as a light-spoken Englishman (using a softer accent than during his period as a heel manager) with an uproarious laugh.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; On ''TNT'', Hayes usually was the victim of several slapsticks; some instances included getting a face-full of powder, being slopped with pumpkin-innards by [[Lou Albano|"Captain" Lou Albano]], drinking one of [[Hulk Hogan]]'s diet shakes, then promptly vomiting, being nearly bitten by one of [[Hillbilly Jim]]'s goats, and getting slapped in the face by [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]]. He would later become the introductory announcer on ''Prime Time Wrestling'', on which he would give rousing and complimentary introductions to the face hosts and slightly less flattering but coolly worded intros to [[Bobby Heenan|Bobby "The Brain" Heenan]]. He was once "taken hostage" from the show by [[Sgt. Slaughter]] and his "Iraqi" allies.

Hayes appeared at [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]] in 1985 where he was the backstage commentator introducing matches and pre-recorded comments by the wrestlers. As Hayes was announcing the upcoming [[WWF Women's Championship]] match to the TV audience, he was affectionately kissed on the cheek by his real life friend [[The Fabulous Moolah]] as she and her charge, WWF Women's Champion [[Leilani Kai]] walked to the ring for Kai's title defence against [[Wendi Richter]] (Kai also kissed a visibly blushing Hayes). Moolah would also kiss Hayes full on the lips during an episode of ''Tuesday Night Titans''. At [[WrestleMania 2]], he served as commentator alongside [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]] and the [[Cassandra Peterson|"Mistress of the Dark" Elvira]] for the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena|Los Angeles]] portion of the event. This was the only WWF [[pay-per-view]] on which Hayes commentated on the main event (Hulk Hogan vs [[King Kong Bundy]] in a steel cage for Hogan's [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]] belt). For the [[WWE Home Video|Coliseum Video]] release of [[WrestleMania III]], Hayes briefly appeared alongside [[Gorilla Monsoon]] hyping the event.

As the [[WWE Video Library|WWF's video library]] began to expand, Hayes became a mainstay in many of the releases; such as "Etiquette With Lord Alfred Hayes", a short segment on the WWF World Tour 1991 tape, where he attempted to teach [[table manners]] to [[Sherri Martel|Sensational Sherri]] and [[Steve Lombardi|The Brooklyn Brawler]]. Another great segment on the tape collections took place on the "Supertape" series when Lord Alfred Hayes would voice "The Call of the Action" in which a match or two would be slowed down and each manoeuvre named and explained (for instance, the audience could learn what a reverse crescent kick was, long before it became more famously known as "Sweet Chin Music"). It was also an example of how as late as 1990 or so, professional wrestling was still presented with "[[Kayfabe]]", the veneer of reality. He later appeared on the video releases of [[WrestleMania VII]] where he had a corny [[Love Story (1970 film)|''Love Story'']]-like part regarding the reunion of [[Randy Savage|"Macho Man" Randy Savage]] and his former manager [[Miss Elizabeth]] following Savage's career-ending loss to [[The Ultimate Warrior]], [[WrestleMania VIII]], and [[Royal Rumble (1993)|Royal Rumble 1993]] where he famously asked to watch Sensational Sherri put on her stockings while interviewing her in her dressing room, prompting Sherri to mockingly call him a "dirty old man". He also appeared on some early episodes of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night RAW]]''). Wrestlemania VII also saw the last Wrestlemania match called by Hayes when he joined Monsoon in calling the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match between champion [[Mr Perfect]] and challenger the [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]]. This was due to Monsoon's co-commentator for the event Bobby Heenan being Perfect's manager at the time and he was required to be at ringside.

Lord Alfred also appeared on many episodes of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'', often performing silly recorded acts with fellow WWF commentator/interviewer [[Gene Okerlund|"Mean" Gene Okerlund]]. One skit involved Hayes and Okerlund (referred to as "Jim" by Hayes despite Okerlund protesting his name was "Gene") taking a safari through Africa, encountering many strange sights along the way ([[One Man Gang|Akeem]] "The African Dream" and his manager [[Slick (wrestling)|Slick]], [[Koko B. Ware]] and his parrot "Frankie", [[The Bushwhackers]], and [[Jake Roberts|Jake "The Snake" Roberts]] and his pet python "Damien").

Hayes is known for having spoken the phrase "Promotional consideration paid for by the following", which was heard at the end of ''Superstars of Wrestling'' and ''Wrestling Challenge'' syndicated shows.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; At WrestleMania fan access, fans would ask him to repeat his line.

As a commentator, Hayes maintained his reserved mannerisms; though not specifically a heel, he would be quicker to give praise to heelish characters, though disapproving of underhanded methods (in one match, after being told by Gorilla Monsoon that [[the Hart Foundation]] had "broken every rule in the book," he replied with a conceding "yes, they've done that").&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; He was jokingly referred to by Hulk Hogan as "Awful Alfred" during interviews. It was during this time that his hearty uproarious laugh would become his trademark, bursting into laughter after a witty comment by his regular broadcast partner Gorilla Monsoon.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; He would quietly absorb criticism and insults from heel commentators such as Heenan and [[The Honky Tonk Man]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; However, toward the end of his WWF run he quietly shifted to a more heelish style, where he would be quicker to take the sides of heels (such as Owen Hart after he turned on Bret) and quicker to insult the faces (calling Paul Bearer a "little toad"). His final famous WWF promo took place in November 1994, when the [[Headshrinkers]] did a promo for "Left Guard Sport stick (a parody of [[Right Guard]] Sport Stick)" and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Fatu]] and [[Sione Vailahi|Sione]] ([[The Headshrinkers]]) ate the deodorant causing Alfred to keep telling them to stop.

Hayes' various roles for the WWF included co-hosting ''[[WWF All American Wrestling (show)|All American Wrestling]]'' with Gene Okerlund and doing commentary for shows at Madison Square Garden with [[Gorilla Monsoon]] sporadically from 1984–1990. Hayes' most common broadcast partner was [[Sean Mooney]], whom was paired with Hayes on ''[[Prime Time Wrestling]]'', ''[[WWF Mania]]'', as well as most all releases for Coliseum Video starting in 1989 until 1993. Hayes and Mooney often participated in comedic skits together, including a ''[[Star Trek]]'' parody. Hayes was also the announcer for [[Bobby Heenan]]'s ''The Bobby Heenan Show'', which aired briefly in the Summer of 1989.

At one point, he also assisted [[Edouard Carpentier]], [[Raymond Rougeau]] and Guy Hauray as a commentator on the French-language broadcasts of the WWF on [[Réseau des sports|RDS]] (Réseau des Sports) in the province of Québec and throughout Canada.

After leaving the WWF, Hayes would later appear as a full-on heel commentator alongside Mick Karch, calling the action in 1996 for the short-lived [[American Wrestling Federation]].

==Retirement and death==
Hayes retired from the WWF in 1995 after enduring a series of pay cuts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;"Wrestlers Are Like Seagulls: From McMahon To McMahon" by James J. Dillon&lt;/ref&gt; McMahon and the rest of the office were reportedly very upset at the news as Hayes was someone that they didn't want to lose.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Around this time he was also involved in a serious car accident. As a result of the accident he suffered [[gangrene]] and part of a leg had to be amputated. Hayes was a wheelchair user for the remainder of his life. He spent the last few years of his life in a retirement home, only venturing out of the home to make appearances at wrestling conventions sporadically.&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; He later suffered a series of strokes and died on 21 July 2005 at his home in [[Texas]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez"/&gt; On the first episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night RAW]]'' to air after his death, WWE paid tribute to Hayes with a [[ten-bell salute]] and a video memorial.&lt;ref name="Oliver"&gt;{{ cite web | url = http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/2005/07/21/1141424.html | author = Oliver, G.| title = Lord Al Hayes dead at 76 | publisher=[[Canoe.ca|Canadian Online Explorer]] | accessdate = 10 February 2008 | date = 21 July 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 November 2010 "Old School" edition of ''Raw'', his voice-over was a part of the broadcast.

The '''''New International Encyclopedia''''' was an American encyclopedia first published in 1902 by [[Dodd, Mead and Company]].&lt;ref name=NIE&gt;New International Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; It descended from the ''International Cyclopaedia'' (1884) and was updated in 1906, 1914 and 1926.

==History==
The ''New International Encyclopedia'' was the successor of the ''International Cyclopaedia'' (1884). Initially, the ''International Cyclopaedia'' was largely a reprint of Alden's ''Library of Universal Knowledge'', which was a reprint of the British ''[[Chambers's Encyclopaedia]]''. The title was changed to ''New International Encyclopedia'' in 1902, with editors [[Harry Thurston Peck]], [[Daniel Coit Gilman]], and [[Frank Moore Colby]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, S. Padraig, 1922- Anglo-American general encyclopedias: a historical bibliography, 1703-1967 New York : Bowker, p.120&lt;/ref&gt;

The encyclopedia was popular and reprints were made in 1904, 1905, 1907 (corrected and expanded to 20 volumes), 1909 and 1911. The 2nd edition appeared from 1914 to 1917 in 24 volumes. With Peck and Gilman deceased, Colby was joined by a new editor, [[Talcott Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.120&lt;/ref&gt; This edition was set up from new type and thoroughly revised. It was very strong in biography.&lt;ref&gt;"Encyclopedias," in ''The Encyclopedia Americana,'' (1988)  Volume 10, Page 333&lt;/ref&gt;

A third edition was published in 1923, however this was mostly a reprint with the addition of a history of the [[First World War]] in Vol. 24, which had previously been a reading and study guide. A two volume supplement was published in 1925, and this was incorporated into the 1927 reprint, which had 25 vols. A further 2 vol. supplement in 1930 along with another reprint.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

The final edition was published in 1935, now under the [[Funk and Wagnall's]] label. This edition included another updating supplement, authored by [[Herbert Treadwell Wade]]. Some material from the ''New International'' would be incorporated into future books published by Funk and Wagnall's books such as ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Encyclopaedia|Funk &amp; Wagnalls Standard Reference Encyclopaedia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.121&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1926 material was printed in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], by [[Yale University Press]]. Boston Bookbinding Company of Cambridge produced the covers. Thirteen books enclosing twenty-three volumes comprise the encyclopedia, which includes a supplement after Volume 23. Each book contains about 1600 pages.&lt;ref&gt;Bessie Graham, ''Bookman's manual'' (1928) – Page 28&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''New International Yearbook'' ==

Like other encyclopedias of the time, ''New International'' had a yearly supplement, the ''New International Yearbook'', beginning in 1908. Like the encyclopedia itself, this publication was sold to Funk and Wagnalls in 1931. It was edited by Frank Moore Colby until his death in 1925, and then by Wade. In 1937 [[Frank Horace Vizetelly]] became editor.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh p.121&lt;/ref&gt; The yearbook outlasted the parent encyclopedia, running to 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/183333553  The New International Yearbook : a compendium of the world's progress for the year....]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributors and office editors==
More than 500 men, and some women, submitted and composed the information contained in the ''New International Encyclopedia''.

'''Editors of the First Edition'''
*Daniel Coit Gilman, LL.D., President of Johns Hopkins University (1876–1901), President of Carnegie Institution.

*Frank Moore Colby, M.A., formerly Professor in [[New York University]].

The '''''Oxford Dictionary of English''''' ('''''ODE''''') is a single-volume English [[dictionary]] published by [[Oxford University Press]], first published in 1998 as '''''The New Oxford Dictionary of English''''' ('''''NODE'''''). The word "new" was dropped from the title with the Second Edition in 2003.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; This dictionary is not based on the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' and should not be mistaken for a new or updated version of the OED.  It is a completely new dictionary which strives to represent as faithfully as possible the current usage of English words.

The Revised Second Edition contains 355,000 words, phrases, and definitions, including biographical references and thousands of encyclopaedic entries. The Third Edition was published in August 2010, with some new words, including "[[vuvuzela]]".

It is currently the largest single-volume English-language dictionary published by Oxford University Press.

==Editorial principles and practices==
The first editor, Judy Pearsall, wrote in the introduction that it is based on a modern understanding of [[language]] and is derived from a [[corpus linguistics|corpus]] of contemporary English usage. For example, the editors did not discourage [[split infinitive]]s, but instead justified their use in some contexts.  The first edition was based on bodies of texts such as the [[British National Corpus]] and the citation [[database]] of the Oxford Reading Programme.

The dictionary "views the language from the perspective that English is a world language".  A network of consultants provide extensive coverage of English usage from the United States to the [[Caribbean]] and New Zealand.

A more unusual decision was to omit pronunciations of common, everyday words, contrary to the practice of most large dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"Generally speaking, native speakers of English do not need information about the pronunciation of ordinary, everyday words....For this reason, no pronunciations are given for such words (or their compounds or derivatives)....the principle followed is that pronunciations are given where they are likely to cause problems for the native speaker of English", ''The New Oxford Dictionary of English'', Oxford University Press, 1998, ed. Judy Pearsall ''et al'', Introduction, p xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Phonetic Alphabet]] (IPA) is used to present pronunciations, which are in turn based on the [[Received Pronunciation]].

The Second Edition added over 3,000 new words, senses and phrases drawn from the [[Oxford English Corpus]].&lt;ref name=hughes&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hughes |first=H.G.A. |date=2004 |title=Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd edition) |journal=Reference Reviews |publisher= |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=36–37 |doi=10.1108/09504120410535407 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New Oxford American Dictionary]]'' is the American version of the ''Oxford Dictionary of English'', with substantial editing and uses a [[Pronunciation respelling for English|diacritical respelling scheme]] rather than the IPA system.

The '''Prague City Archives''' ({{lang-cs|Archiv hlavního města Prahy}}) is one of the departments of the [[Prague City Hall]]. It collects, preserves, processes and makes available archival materials documenting the historical development of [[Prague]] since the [[Middle Ages]] up to the present.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.ahmp.cz/eng/index.html?mid=1&amp;wstyle=0&amp;page=%27%27|website=www.ahmp.cz|publisher=Prague City Archives|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the [[National Archives of the Czech Republic]] the Prague City Archives is one of the largest and most important [[archive|archives]] in [[Bohemia]]. 

== History ==
[[File:Palais Clam-Gallas (straircase).JPG|thumb|Staircase of [[Clam-Gallas Palace]] in the Old Town of Prague, which serves as the venue for cultural events of the Archives]]
The Prague City Archives was founded as an independent specialized institution in 1851. Since that time it was located on the ground floor of the [[Old Town Hall (Prague)|Old Town Hall]]. During the fire of the Old Town Hall on 8 May 1945 a part of the archive funds were destroyed, but fortunately the majority of the historical documents were evacuated outside Prague. After the end of the [[World War II|war]] the archives was housed in the [[Clam-Gallas Palace]] in the [[Old Town of Prague]]. The palace was soon unable to accommodate the wealth of material, therefore the archives were housed in eight different buildings, some of them were located outside Prague. The new archive building was built in 1997 in the Prague district of [[Chodov (Prague)|Chodov]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.ahmp.cz/eng/index.html?mid=7&amp;wstyle=0&amp;page=%27%27|website=www.ahmp.cz|publisher=Prague City Archives|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Clam-Gallas Palace serves today as venue for cultural event and conferences organized by the Prague City Archives.

== Archival collections ==
The archives currently administers 19,000 meters in length of archive material and 3,000 meters of books, newspapers and magazines. The collection of [[Manuscript|manuscripts]] contains 8,427 official books relating to the four medieval Prague towns and several hundred literary, religious and scientific or academic manuscripts. It has a collection of over 200,000 [[Parchment|parchments]] and paper documents. The archives has also a large library containing over 150,000 oriented chiefly towards the history of Prague and its present-day life.

The oldest document kept in the archives is the so-called ''[[Bohnice]] Authentica'' from 1158.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4952">In the [[software development process]],  a '''reference implementation''' (or, less frequently, '''sample implementation''' or '''model implementation''') is the standard from which all other implementations and corresponding customizations are derived. An improvement to a reference implementation reflects an unchanging [[specification (technical standard)|specification]]. Conversely, a failed attempt at an implementation may prove that the specification is not suitable and needs improvement itself. [[Software testing|Testing]] the implementation-vs.-specification relationship further enhances the [[Product family engineering|production]]'s inter-process efficiencies:

{{quote|A reference implementation is, in general, an implementation of a specification to be used as a definitive interpretation for that specification (This definition is a bit grandiloquent but works).  During the development of the ... conformance test suite, at least one relatively trusted implementation of each interface is necessary to (1) discover errors or ambiguities in the specification, and (2) validate the correct functioning of the test suite.&lt;ref&gt;Dalci, Eric; Fong, Elizabeth; Goldfine, Alan (2003). ''Requirements for GSC-IS Reference Implementations''.  National Institute of Standards and Technology, Information Technology Laboratory.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20060928231404/http://xw2k.sdct.itl.nist.gov/smartcard/document/ref-imp51.pdf 
Requirements for GSC-IS Reference Implementations]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{quote|Characteristics of a Reference Implementation: 
# Developed concurrently with the specification and test suite; 
# Verifies that specification is implementable; 
# Enables the test suite to be tested; 
# Serves as a Gold Standard against which other implementations can be measured; 
# Helps to clarify the intent of the specification in situations where [[Conformance testing|conformance tests]] are inadequate&lt;ref&gt;Curran, Patrick (2003). ''Conformance Testing: An Industry Perspective''.  Sun Microsystems.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120303000051/http://vote.nist.gov/speeches/1%20-%20Specification%20Panel/6%20-%20Curran.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Reference implementations of algorithms, for instance [[cryptographic algorithm]]s, are often the result or the input of [[standardization]] processes. In this function they are often dedicated to the [[public domain]] with their [[source code]] as [[public domain software]]. Examples are the first [[CERN HTTPd|CERN's httpd]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140817185526/http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/birth-web/licensing-web The birth of the web Licensing the web] on cern.ch (2014)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]] cipher, [[base64]] variants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://libb64.sourceforge.net/ libb64] on sourceforge&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SHA-3]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170630041850/http://keccak.noekeon.org/KeccakReferenceAndOptimized-3.2.zip KeccakReferenceAndOptimized-3.2.zip] mainReference.c ''"The Keccak sponge function, designed by Guido Bertoni, Joan Daemen, Michaël Peeters and Gilles Van Assche.

To the extent possible under law, the implementer has waived all copyright and related or neighboring rights to the source code in this file. https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Openwall Project]] maintains a list of several algorithms with their reference [[source code]] in the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://openwall.info/wiki/people/solar/software/public-domain-source-code Source code snippets and frameworks placed in the public domain] on [[Openwall Project|openwall.info]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A reference implementation may or may not be production quality. For example, the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] reference implementation of the [[MP3]] standard usually does not compare favorably to other common implementations, such as [[LAME]], in listening tests that determine sound quality.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} In contrast, [[CPython]], the reference implementation of the [[Python programming language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snow|first1=Eric|title=PEP 421 -- Adding sys.implementation|url=&lt;!-- FIXME: captcha is broken. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0421/#motivation --&gt;|website=Python.org|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=6 January 2017|date=2012-01-26|quote=For a number of years now, the distinction between Python-the-language and CPython (the reference implementation) has been growing.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|reason=Please fix URL here. Captcha is broken so I can't add it.|date=January 2017}} is also the implementation most widely used in production.

'''Rose Seidler House''' is a heritage-listed former residence and now house museum located at 69-71 Clissold Road in the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Wahroonga, New South Wales|Wahroonga]] in the [[Ku-ring-gai Council]] local government area of [[New South Wales]], Australia. It was designed by [[Harry Seidler]] and built from 1948 to 1950 by Bret R. Lake. It is also known as In neighbourhood precinct with Marcus Seidler House and Teplitzky House or Rose House. The property is owned by the [[Office of Environment and Heritage (New South Wales)|NSW Office of Environment and Heritage]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 2 April 1999.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261&gt;{{cite NSW SHR|5045033|Rose Seidler House|hr=00261|fn=S90/05313; S96/00465 [S170]|accessdate=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bauhaus]]-styled house was designed for both of Seidler's parents &amp;ndash; Rose and Max Seidler,&lt;ref&gt;The plans list client as M. Seidler&amp;ndash;see plan in footage at 11-12 sec of online film entitled "Harry Seidler's 1950s houses - Wahroonga"&lt;/ref&gt; however since Rose Seidler was the person who initiated and drove the commission, making all the main client decisions, the house is named after only her.

== History ==
In 1855 to 1856 the NSW Lands Department put up for Crown land auction a large area from St Ives Public School  to the present Clissold road, Wahroonga that included the Rose Seidler House site.  For twenty years not one lot was sold and in 1877 the whole area was bought by William Billyard.  After passing through several hands undeveloped, the mortgagee, The Sydney Land Bank and Financial Agency Co came into possession of it and subdivided the whole area into 38 allotments of {{convert|2|-|10|acre|ha|0|order=flip}} in 1893 and was called the "Pymble View Estate."&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

During the turn of the century the more accessible areas attracted the attention of the developing middle class who were seeking property suitable for large houses and generous gardens in bushland settings.  In the more  inaccessible pockets such as Clissold Road, tradespeople and gardeners established market and flower gardens, orchards, dairies and poultry frams with an array of homebuilt shacks and sheds.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

The gazettal of the [[Cumberland County Plan]] in 1951 led to the promoting of neighbourhood areas whilst retaining open space and green belts.  This planning scheme led to a new wave of developers and middle class professionals who were attracted to the bushland settings and vistas for architect-designed homes.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

In 1948 Harry Seidler arrived in Sydney to build a house for his parents and decided upon Clissold Road.  The Seidler family purchased {{convert|16|acre|ha|order=flip}} for [[Australian pound|A£]]500.  Seidler had envisaged a family estate.  He strategically sited three houses which were flanked by an S shaped driveway.  There was provision for a swimming pool and communal areas in the centre of the triangle formed by the houses.  The communal housing estate was surrounded by vegetable gardens and indigenous bush.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

Rose Seidler house was built between 1948 and 1950. By 1952 the {{convert|16|acre|ha|order=flip}} had been divided into three lots and by 1956 Marcus Seidler House and Rose House had been completed.  The Seidler family lived here for the next twenty years. During this time subdivisions occurred and in the late 1960s Harry Seidlers parents passed away.  Rose Seidler House was leased out until 1980.  In 1981 Harry Seidler renovated the interior and exterior of the house.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

In 1988 Harry Seidler officially handed over Rose Seidler House to the Minister Administering the Heritage Act. The property was leased to the [[Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales]] (now called Sydney Living Museums) for use as a public house museum.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1520&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1989:11-29&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt; The museum is open to the public each Sunday since 1991.

== Description ==
===Setting and garden===
Rose Seidler House is part of Harry Seidler's conceptual planning of a family compound of three modernist houses, inspired by north-east American prototypes. The relationship of architecture with landscape, the house in a cleared space with few, deliberately-retained eucalypts, demonstrates one of the principal tenets of modernism - the contrast between man-made object and nature (order/disorder) - the built form set against space and time.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1521&gt;Morris, 2007, 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

However the garden that evolved around one of Australia's iconic prototypal modernist houes became an expression of the recent immigrant Rose Seidler's personal creativity. It was both typically suburban in the choice of planting and idiosyncrathic in the integration of terraced citrus orchard with ornamental plants. Mrs Seidler particularly delighted in growing plants that she could not possibly have grown in Vienna or in England: frangipani ([[Plumeria rubra|''Plumeria rubra'']]), oranges, port wine magnolia ([[Michelia figo|''Michelia figo'']]) and Queensland firewheel tree (''Stenocarpus sinuatus''). The story of the garden adds a layer of richness to the interpretation of the house.&lt;ref name="nswshr-261-1521" /&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

Three garden characteristics are present on the site.  There is indigenous bushland still covering large sections of the site.  But modern landscaping of the [[driveway]] and the immediate area around the house, rough stone [[retaining wall]]s and ramp.  The resident gardening of Rose Seidler permeates the site and subtlety infiltrates both the native bushland and the modern landscaping.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1523&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1989:48-56&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

===House===
Rose Seidler House is a modern two-storey, 12 room house sited on {{convert|1|ha|spell=on}} of suburban bushland with intact gardens.  The house is constructed of four basic materials; natural bush stone, reinforced concrete, timber and glass.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

Built in 1949-1950 in the [[Australian residential architectural styles#International style|International modernist]] style, it was futuristic and modern for Australia at that time, and is an outstanding example of mid-century-modern domestic architecture. In 1991, Harry Seidler described the house's spatial design which was characteristic of his approach in the rest of his life's work:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Rose Seidler House – the House that Harry built |work=Review |publisher=ABC TV |location=Australia |date=14 April 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{blockquote|"...this house explodes the surfaces that enclose a normal house or space, and turns it into a continuum of free standing planes, through which the eye can never see an end, you are always intrigued what’s beyond, you can always see something floating into the distance, there is never an obstruction to your vision, it is a continuum (of space), that I believe 20th century man’s eye and senses respond positively to.}}

Following the example of the houses he had worked on in Breuer's office in 1946-48 which were located on compounds next to a public nature reserve in North-East USA, Seidler picked the site for the house because it was next to [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park|Ku-Ring-Gai Chase reserve]]. In 1948, the site had been used to mine pottery clay,&lt;ref&gt;(pottery clay mining) Cassette "Rose Seidler House : furniture / Harry Seidler interviewed by Peter Watts (and Linda Rektor) about the furniture at Rose Seidler House - May 1987 [sound recording]" Caroline Simpson Library, The Mint, Sydney Living Museums, catalogue 749.20495 SEI. Transcript in suspension file.&lt;/ref&gt; and was considered very remote - being at the end of a dirt road through market gardens.&lt;ref&gt;(site like Breuer houses and market gardens) Interview with Harry and Penelope Seidler on 12 May 2001 at Rose Seidler House. With Colleen Morris, Andrew Mitchell and Linda Rector at page 1. Transcript at Caroline Simpson Library, The Mint, Sydney Living Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was long after the house was finished that the surrounding streets were paved and developed as a residential suburb.

The ground floor is elevated to the north and east sides.  The stone [[Foundation (engineering)|foundations]] provide three walls of the double garage.  A large recreation area on the north side is partially sheltered by the ramp and sundeck of the first floor.  The two storey open well filters light through to this area.  A caretaker's flat is located at the end of the recreation area.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

The main entrance door is via a small foyer.  Stairs lead up to the first floor and the comforts of a fireplace and a magnificent vista of the Ku-ring-gai bushland through a wall of glass.  There are four inter-related features of the interior planning scheme.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

Each room except the main bathroom has a full view, bringing the outside, inside.  There are full glass walls in the living, dining, playroom and 3 bedrooms; above waist height windows in the kitchen, laundry and main bedroom and above shoulder height in the en-suite bathroom.  Direct or close contact to related outdoor areas is available for each room.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

The bi-nuclear plan clearly separates living areas from sleeping and bathrooms.  These are connected by the flexible transitional zones of the playroom and deck.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

Spatial freedom and flexibility of spaces is maximised and achieved by the arrangement of functional and temporary dividers that redefine spaces according to their use.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

The minimal interiors aim to produce visual tension or counterpoint through "tensional opposition" of recurrent elements, forms, planes, colours, and materials.  The smooth neutral plaster walls counterpoint the rough texture of the [[sandstone]].&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1523/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

=== Condition ===

As at 24 September 1997, the physical condition was excellent.  Archaeological potential is low.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

=== Modifications and dates ===
In 1948 structural plans were completed and construction commenced.  Completed in 1950.  First major renovations were undertaken in 1971 including recarpeting, repainting and some new electrical and bathroom fittings.  A second major renovation was undertaken in 1981 which included exterior maintenance and interior redecorating.  The third major renovation was  undertaken in 1988.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1524&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1989:41-43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

== Heritage listing ==
As at 8 December 2008, Rose Seidler House is historically significant as a resource to demonstrate the many features of Modernist art, architecture and design theory and practice.  It is one of the finest and purest examples of mid-century modern domestic architecture in Australia  as designed by the second generation of twentieth century Modern architects.  It also contains intact contents of  late 1940s furniture by such renown designers as Eames, Saarinen and Hardoy.  Rose Seidler House is socially significant because of its influence on the character of domestic architecture in New South Wales, not only by direct imitators in the 1950s but on the thinking of architects and architectural practice in subsequent decades.  It is technically significant for its design detailing and choice of construction methods and materials which highlight aspects of postwar housing construction in a period of conservative building regulations, scarcity of materials, skills and industrial processes.  The house incorporates many examples of modern domestic technology and commercial products which were introduced into Australia at this time.  These include electric appliances, labour saving devices, materials, fittings and storage systems.&lt;ref name=nswshr-261-1525&gt;Historic Houses Trust 1989:9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-261/&gt;

[[File:Table of Contents PANARCHIE published in 1860.JPG|thumb|A table of contents]]
A '''table of contents,''' usually headed simply '''Contents''' and abbreviated informally as '''TOC,''' is a list, usually found on a page before the start of a written work, of its chapter or section titles or brief descriptions with their commencing page numbers.

==Earliest use==
[[Pliny the Elder]] credits [[Quintus Valerius Soranus]] (d. 82 B.C.) as the first author to provide a table of contents to help readers navigate a lengthy work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], preface 33, ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Historia naturalis]]''; John Henderson, “Knowing Someone Through Their Books: [[Pliny the Younger|Pliny]] on Uncle Pliny (''Epistles'' 3.5),” ''Classical Philology'' 97 (2002), p. 275.&lt;/ref&gt; Pliny's own table of contents for his encyclopedic [[Natural History (Pliny)|''Historia naturalis'']] ("Natural History") may be viewed online [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/1*.html in Latin] and [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0137 in English] (following dedication).

==Form==
A table of contents usually includes the titles or descriptions of first-level headings (''chapters'' in longer works), and often includes second-level headings (''sections'' or ''A-heads'') within the chapters as well, and occasionally even includes third-level headings (''subsections'' or ''B-heads'') within the sections as well. The depth of detail in tables of contents depends on the length of the work, with longer works having less. Formal reports (ten or more pages and being too long to put into a [[memorandum|memo]] or letter) also have a table of contents. Within an English-language book, the table of contents usually appears after the [[title page]], [[copyright notice]]s, and, in technical journals, the [[abstract (summary)|abstract]]; and before any lists of tables or [[figure (publishing)|figures]], the [[foreword]], and the [[preface]].

Printed tables of contents indicate page numbers where each part starts, while digital ones offer [[Hyperlink|links]] to go to each part. The format and location of the page numbers is a matter of style for the publisher. If the page numbers appear after the heading text, they might be preceded by characters called ''[[leader (typography)|leaders]]'', usually dots or [[full stop|periods]], that run from the chapter or section titles on the opposite side of the page, or the page numbers might remain closer to the titles. In some cases, the page number appears before the text.

If a book or document contains chapters, articles, or stories by different authors, their names usually appear in the table of contents.

Matter preceding the table of contents is generally not listed there. However, all pages except the outside cover are counted, and the table of contents is often numbered with a lowercase Roman numeral page number. Many popular [[word processor]]s, such as [[Microsoft Word]], [[WordPerfect]], and [[StarOffice Writer|StarWriter]] are capable of automatically generating a table of contents if the author of the text uses specific styles for chapters, sections, subsections, etc.

==Examples==
Example with leaders:
 Chapter 1: Getting Started . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1
    Introduction  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2
    Next Steps  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 3

Example without leaders:
 Chapter 1: Getting Started   1
    Introduction   2
    Next Steps   3

Example with authors:
 1. Introduction to Biology  ''Arthur C. Smith''   1
 2. Microbiology  ''Susan Jones''   10
 3. Advances in Biotechnology  ''T.C. Chang''   24

Example with descriptive text:
 Chapter 1                                           3
    In which we first meet our hero and heroine, attend
    a gala feast, and begin an unexpected journey.

 Chapter 2                                          12
    The journey takes an unusual turn, and new villains
     are discovered.

'''''Theorizing about Myth''''' is a 1999 book by the [[University of Aberdeen]] religious studies scholar Robert A. Segal that offers an alternative interpretation of the [[Adonis]] myth. In Chapter VII,  "Adonis: A Greek Eternal Child", he puts forth his theory of Adonis, not as a vegetation god but as an archetype of the eternal child, the [[Jungian psychology|Jungian]] [[Puer Aeternus|puer]]. 

In Segal's interpretation, based on the work of [[Carl Jung]], Adonis lives as "a psychological infant, ultimately, as a fetus".{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=106}} He lives under the spell of the Great Mother archetype and can only live through her. His ego is weak and he seeks to remain surrendered to her.{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=106}}

He can put down no roots of his own. He is unable to take on the institutions of work and family which connects one to the community because he is retarded psychologically.{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=107}} He is childlike and a childish puer won't be tied down. He avoids commitment and craves excitement. He is sexually promiscuous because he can never find his fantasy mate. Ultimately he is attached to the archetype of The Great Mother. All women are either manifestations of the mother or unworthy and inferior.{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=108}}  

Segal mentions [[Elvis Presley]] as the "consummate mamma's boy who lived the last twenty years as a recluse in a womblike, infantile world in which all of his wishes were immediately satisfied yet who deemed himself entirely normal, in fact 'all-American'".{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=109}}

In Segal's view, the puer is the opposite archetype of the hero: the hero succeeds where the puer fails, finds a wife and a job, takes risks for those things to which he is committed.  The puer commits to nothing so he risks nothing. He has no independent ego so he cannot lose it.{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=109}}

Turning to the myth itself, Segal notes that immediately after his birth when Adonis emerges from the tree, Aphrodite puts him into a chest thereby undoing his birth so that she can possess him. Next, Persephone opens the chest, sees him and wants him for herself. Each gets him for four months of the year Zeus grants him freedom for the remaining four months.  However, Adonis immediately gives up his freedom to Aphrodite, placing himself in the custody of the mother archetypes.{{sfn|Segal|1999|p=110}}

Segal says that a Jungian interpretation of the myth could face the same difficulty as the Frazerian interpretation which is that it must take into account the fact that he eventually dies permanently. Says Segal, "Where a normal child needs to be born only once to liberate himself from the mother, Adonis, as puer, continually returns to the mother and so must be born again and again. His final death is simply his permanent rather temporary return to her".{{sfn|Segal|1999|pp=110–111}}

Segal goes on to explain how Adonis speaks of a distinctively Greek society in which the goal of young men was to become active, participating citizens.  Adonis is the archetype of what not to become.

The '''''Zilin''''' ({{zh|c=字林}}; c. 350) or '''Forest of Characters''' was a [[Chinese dictionary]] compiled by the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] (265–420) lexicographer Lü Chen (呂忱). It contained 12,824 [[Chinese character|character]] [[headword|head entries]], organized by the 540-[[Radical (Chinese characters)|radical]] system of the ''[[Shuowen Jiezi]]''. In the history of Chinese [[lexicography]], the ''Zilin'' followed the ''Shuowen Jiezi'' (121; with 9,353 character entries) and preceded the ''[[Yupian]]'' (c. 543; with 12,158 entries).

==Text==
Lü Chen compiled the ''Zilin'' to supplement the ''Shuowen jiezi'', and included more the 3,000 uncommon and [[Variant Chinese character|variant]] Chinese characters. Yong and Peng (2008: 186) describe the ''Zilin'' as a "more influential character dictionary" than the ''Shuowen jiezi''.
 
Lü Chen's younger brother Lü Jing (呂靜) was also a lexicographer, who compiled the  ''[[Shenglei#History|Yunji]]'' (韻集; "Assembly of Rimes"; c. 280). Other than their dictionaries, little is known about either brother.

The title ''Zilin'', translated as "Forest of Characters" (Zhou and Zhang 2003: 72) or "The Character Forest" (Yong and Peng 2008), combines ''zì'' [[wikt:字|字]] "character; script; writing; graph" and ''lín'' [[wikt:林|林]] "forest; woods; grove; group; collection of literary works; many; numerous". Titles of several [[Japanese dictionaries]] adapted this ''rin'' 林 "forest" metaphor, such as ''[[Daijirin]]'' (大辞林; "Great Forest of Words", 1988) and ''Dai Kangorin'' (大漢語林; "Great Forest of Chinese"; 1992).

==History==
The ''Zilin'' was popular in the [[Northern and Southern dynasties]] period (420–589), when "lexicography in China entered the stage of exploration and development. There were more new dictionary types coming into being and discoveries were waiting to be made in format and style, in mode of definition, and in phonetic notation." (Yong and Peng 2008: 275).

During the [[Liu Song dynasty]] (420-479), Wu Gongceng (吳恭曾) from [[Yang Province]] compiled the first commentary to the ''Zilin'', the ''Zilin yinyi'' (字林音義; "Pronunciations and Meanings in the ''Zilin''") in 5 volumes. 

Jiang Shi (江式) was a renowned [[Chinese calligraphy|calligrapher]] and [[epigraphist]] during the [[Northern Wei]] (386–535) dynasty. His biography in the ''[[Book of Wei]]'' (554) history included the ''Lunshu biao'' (論書表; "Memorial on Calligraphy"; 514), in which Jiang Shi described the ''Zilin''. When [[Shi Jian|Prince of Yiyang]] (r. 349-350) was enfeoffed at Rencheng (任城) [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (present-day [[Yanzhou District]]), Lü Chen presented the ''Zilin'' in 6 volumes. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It generally follows the example of the [''Shuowen jiezi'']. It cites extensively and identifies and differentiates ancient characters, characters of the ''zhou'' style, odd characters, and characters easily confusable. Its writing style is the standardized official script of the Han Dynasty. It has, to a large extent, captured the essence of ''xiaozhuan''. (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 186) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Zhòuwén'' (籀文; "[[Large Seal Script]]") and ''xiǎozhuàn'' (小篆; "[[Small Seal Script]]") were archaic forms of [[Chinese calligraphy]]. Thus, the ''Zilin'' followed the ''Shuowen jiezi'' format of giving the head character entry in Small Seal Script and the definition in [[clerical script]].

The [[Northern Qi]] dynasty (550-577) scholar [[Yan Zhitui]]'s (581) ''Yanshi jiaxun'' (顏氏家訓; "Family Instructions of the Yan Clan") referred to the usefulness of consulting the ''Zilin''. After accompanying the Emperor on a tour, Yan Zhitui wanted to look up the origins and archaic pronunciations of two obscure [[place names]], but could not find the answers in any books, until he checked the ''Zilin'' and ''Yunji'' character dictionaries (Yong and Peng 2008: 186). Yan Zhitui also referred to Lü Chen (without the ''Zilin'' title) in stressing the importance of character dictionaries (tr. Yong and Peng 2008: 186-187). "Words and characters are fundamental. For students nowadays, they rarely have a better knowledge of characters: when they read the Five Classics" they follow the civil official [[Xu Miao]] rather than the lexicographer [[Xu Shen]], "and when they practice writing ''fu''-poems," they believed in the ''[[Chuci]]'' poet [[Qu Yuan]]'s interpretations but neglected Lü Chen's. 

The ''[[Book of Sui]]'' (636), the official [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618) history, "Biography of Pan Hui" (潘徽) criticized the ''[[Cangjiepian]]'' and ''[[Jijiupian]]'' character primers and ''Shuowen jiezi'' and ''Zilin'' character dictionaries and praised the ''Shenglei'' and ''Yunji'' [[rime dictionaries]].
&lt;blockquote&gt;Previous works like ''Three Cang Primer'' [三蒼] and ''The Instant Primer'' [急就] have merely retained some texts and quotations; those like ''An Explanatory Dictionary of Chinese Characters'' [說文] and ''The Character Forest'' [字林] only focus on differentiating the form and structure of characters. As for the study of speech sounds and rhymes, there is much doubt and confusion. Either through speculation on ancient characters or interpretation of contemporary ones, the investigations have mostly missed the target. It is in ''The Dictionary of Initial Consonants'' [聲類] and ''The Collection of Rhymes'' [韻集] that the voiceless is differentiated from the voiced and the tones are demarcated in five scales [始判清濁才分宮羽]. (76, tr. Yong and Feng 2008: 161) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Book of Sui'' "[[Yiwenzhi|Bibliography]]" section includes Lü Chen's ''Zilin'' in 7 volumes and Wu Gongceng's ''Zilin yinyi'' (字林音義) in 5 volumes.

Up through the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907), the ''Zilin'' "was considered as important as the ''Shuowen jiezi'', but it was later lost (McNair 1995: 264). Yan Yuansun (顏元孫; d. 732), the Tang author of ''[[Ganlu Zishu]]'' "Lexicon for Seeking a Salary", used the ''Zilin'' as a source for determining the ''zheng'' 正 "correct" (suitable for government examinations) forms of characters.

The ''Fengshi wenjianji'' (封氏聞見記; "Master Feng's Record of Knowledge"; c. 770), written by the Tang dynasty scholar Feng Yan (封演), described the ''Zilin'' in a list of early Chinese dictionaries ([[:s:zh: 封氏聞見記/卷二|2]], cf. Yong and Feng 2008: 244). During the Jin dynasty, Lü Chen sought out unusual characters and compiled the ''Zilin'' in 7 volumes, following the [''Shuowen jiezi'' system of] 540 radicals, it included 12,824 characters. Among all the ''Shuowen jiezi''-based dictionaries, Lü Chen's was the most beneficial.

The last remaining copies of the ''Zilin'' were lost before the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279). The ''[[Book of Song]]'' (1493) only mentions this dictionary once. A discussion of different vehicle types (18, 禮五) quotes the ''Zilin'' that a ''píngchē'' (軿車; "curtained carriage") had cloth curtains but no rear ''yuán'' (轅; "(cart/carriage) shaft"), while a ''zīchē'' (輜車; "ancient covered wagon") had a rear shaft.

During the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911), scholars collected surviving fragments of the ''Zilin'' and quotations in other books. For example, the ''[[Kangxi Dictionary]]'' (1716) quotes its definitions and pronunciations over 180 times. Ren Dazhuang (任大樁；1738-1789) compiled the 8-volume ''Zilin kaoyi'' (字林考逸; "Examining the Lost ''Zilin''") in, and Tao Fangqi (陶方琦; 1845-1884) compiled the ''Zilin kaoyi buben'' (字林考逸補本; "Supplement to Examining the Lost ''Zilin''").
