      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2875">'''Advancing Secondary Science Education thru Tetrahymena''' ([[Asset (disambiguation)|ASSET]]) is an [[organization]] at [[Cornell University]] that is dedicated to expanding the use of the protist ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' in K-12 classrooms.  They are funded by the [[National Institutes of Health]] through the SEPA (Science Education Partnership Award) Program.  Although their name includes the word "secondary," they have worked in recent years to develop materials for students in elementary, middle and high schools.  The group develops modules, which are stand-alone labs or lessons that can be inserted into the curriculum of a class at the discretion of the teacher.

==Modules==

Modules are designed to be stand-alone lessons that fit into and compliment a life [[science]] curriculum.  The ASSET program ships all the equipment that is needed to complete the modules to the [[teacher]] in a reusable plastic container, at ASSET's expense. The teacher who requested the materials can use them for up to two weeks.  At the end of the two weeks, the teacher uses a pre-paid return label to send the materials back in the same container.  Some materials, such as live cells, may be sent separately to provide for a chance for the [[culture]] to be established in the teacher's classroom.

===Science Modules===

ASSET has created fifteen science modules, each of which addresses a particular topic relevant to life science education in [[United States]] school curricula.

====Cannibalism and Interspecefic Predation====

This module utilizes two species of ''[[Tetrahymena]]'':  ''Tetrahymena thermophilia'' and ''Tetrahymena vorax''.   In the lab, an extract, called [[stomatin]], is made from the thermophilia, then placed into the vorax culture.  There, it induces a transformation from the microstome form to the macrostome form in T. vorax.  This transformation is most notable by a marked increase in the size of the cell (doubling or sometimes more), the resorption of the microstomal oral apparatus and the construction of a much larger macrostomal oral apparatus.  This transformation allows the macrostomal T. vorax cells to prey on T. thermophilia, but also to cannibalize the microstomes of their own species.&lt;ref name="vorax paper"&gt;[http://jeb.biologists.org/content/205/14/2089.long] In the polymorphic ciliate Tetrahymena vorax, the non-selective phagocytosis seen in microstomes changes to a highly selective process in macrostomes&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science and Society Modules===

ASSET has also created five science and society modules, which are designed to integrate social studies and science education into one unit.

===Elementary School Modules===

'''''Agequake: Riding the Demographic Rollercoaster Shaking Business, Finance and our World ''''' is a book written by Paul Wallace and published in 1999, that investigates what possible ramifications are likely as a significant and unprecedented portion of the human population [[ageing|age]].&lt;ref name=KR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/paul-wallace/agequake/|title=Agequake|work=[[Kirkus Reviews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that rising [[longevity]] and lower [[fertility]] is causing a seismic shift in the profile of populations worldwide, and will be a fundamental force to that will shake business and finance, along with lifestyles and attitudes. Wallace suggests the old bogey of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]] is being replaced by a population "implosion".

Through using [[dependency ratio]]s (the ratio of non-working dependents to the working population) will lead to a point where workers will be burdened with the fiscal and practical responsibilities of supporting a ballooning population of aged retirees.  Society and economy will be affected as the proportion of youth declines - typically the most entrepreneurial, creating and risk taking segment of society.  Along with the liquidation of [[baby boomer]] assets to pay for their retirements, this is likely to halt economic growth in the future, and  [[economic stagnation]] may be a more likely prospect.  Housing prices will plummet, and the world may experience the greatest [[bear market]] in history.

Internationally the relationship between youthful and aggressive [[developing world]] and the rich older [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) countries (where elderly women will become an influential constituency) will change.

'''Alfred Thomas Elwes''' (bapt. 1 August 1841 – 1917) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] artist and [[natural history]] [[illustrator]] of mammals and birds. For most of his life he lived and worked in England, illustrating various natural history books of the nineteenth century as well as for [[Illustrated London News]].&lt;ref name="Antique 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jackson|first1=Christine E.|title=Dictionary of bird artists of the world.|date=1999|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=1851492038|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Houfe 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Houfe|first1=Simon|title=The dictionary of 19th century British book illustrators and caricaturists|date=1996|publisher=Antique Collector's Club|location=Woodbridge|isbn=1851491937|pages=295|edition=Rev.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==
Elwes was born in [[Livorno|Leghorn]], Italy, where he was baptised 1 August 1841. His parents were Alfred Elwes and Louisa Anne Elwes.&lt;ref&gt;''Great Britain, Select Births and Baptisms, 1571-1977''&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a professor of languages.&lt;ref&gt; ''1851 England Census''&lt;/ref&gt; From 1872 to 1877 he was employed by the [[Illustrated London News]] as the chief draftsman of natural history subjects.&lt;ref name="Antique 1999" /&gt;  In 1882 Elwes wrote ''How to draw animals, birds and dogs''.  He died sometime after 1911&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reynard the Fox|url=http://metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/338343|website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; probably around 1917 in Willesden, Middlesex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Terry|first1=John|title=Elwes Chart 0500|url=http://www.terrys.org.uk/charts/e/elwes500.htm|website=Terrys|publisher=John Terry|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==
Elwes was married in Gravesend, Kent on 15 October 1873 to Kate Barnard.&lt;ref name=V&amp;A&gt;{{cite web|title=Drawing|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O112656/drawing-elwes-alfred-thomas/|website=Victoria and Albert Museum|publisher=Victoria and Albert Museum|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barnett Glacier''' ({{Coord|70|59|S|167|30|E|source:GNIS|display=inline,title}}) is a large [[glacier]] in the [[Anare Mountains]] that flows east along the south side of [[Tapsell Foreland]] into [[Smith Inlet (Victoria Land)|Smith Inlet]], northern [[Victoria Land]], [[Antarctica]]. It was mapped by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) from surveys and from [[U.S. Navy]] air photos, 1960–63, and named by the [[Advisory Committee on Antarctic Names]] after [[Donald C. Barnett]], USGS topographic engineer, a member of [[USGS Topo East and West]], 1962–63, in which the expedition extended geodetic control from the area of [[Cape Hallett]] to the [[Wilson Hills]]&lt;!-- sic --&gt; (Topo West) and from the foot of [[Beardmore Glacier]] through the [[Horlick Mountains]] (Topo East). The glacier lies on the [[Pennell Coast]], a portion of Antarctica lying between [[Cape Williams]] and [[Cape Adare]].

The '''Bear Valley Strip Mine''' is an abandoned coal [[Surface mining|strip mine]] located in [[Coal Township, Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Coal Township, Northumberland County]], to the southwest of the town of [[Shamokin, Pennsylvania|Shamokin]], Pennsylvania.  It lies in the Western Middle Field of the [[Anthracite]] belt in the [[Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians]], where the [[Pennsylvanian (geology)|Pennsylvanian]] [[Llewellyn Formation]] is exposed.  The property is owned by the [[Reading Anthracite Company]].

==[[Structural geology]]==
The coal and other overlying rock has been removed by mining down to a resistant sandstone bed, revealing the three-dimensional structures of [[Fold (geology)|folding]] and [[Fault (geology)|faulting]] caused by the [[Alleghenian orogeny|Alleghany Orogeny]].  Students of geology have visited the location for decades due to the quality of exposures.

The central [[anticline]] in the valley is often called the "Whaleback".

'''''Black Sky: The Race For Space''''' is a 2005 [[Discovery Channel]] documentary about [[Space Ship One]], and how a small team backed by [[Paul Allen]] achieved human suborbital spaceflight and won the [[Ansari X Prize]].  It contains insights about how the rocketplane was built, the challenges they faced when they flew it, the vision of [[Burt Rutan]] about the future of this technology (tier two and three), and his thoughts about NASA and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Review - Black Sky: The Race For Space and Winning The X-Prize DVDs|url= http://www.collectspace.com/resources/reviews/dvd/black_sky.html|publisher= collectspace|date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peabodyawards.com/award-profile/black-sky-the-race-for-space 64th Annual Peabody Awards], May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

The galaxy cluster appears to be undergoing the transformation from a galaxy cluster that is still forming, a proto-cluster, to a mature cluster, and it is the first such cluster observed in this stage of its evolution. The cluster consists of seventeen galaxies, and nine of the eleven massive galaxies closest to its centre are [[starburst galaxies]], forming new stars at the rate of about 3,400 [[Sun]]s per year. In contrast, the [[Milky Way]] produces only the equivalent of one [[Sun]] per year, so these galaxies at the core of the cluster are producing stars at a rate three hundred times greater than the Milky Way on average. Other galaxy clusters at ten billion light years and closer have far less star formation, and this suggests that star formation slows down in large galaxies within clusters after the galaxies have already come together during the development of a galaxy cluster.

'''''Classical Mechanics''''' is a [[textbook]] about [[Classical mechanics|the subject of that name]] written by [[Herbert Goldstein]]. Intended for advanced [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] and beginning [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] students, it has been one of the standard references in its subject around the world since its first publication in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Herbert|last2=Twersky|first2=Vic|date=September 1952|title=Classical Mechanics|url=http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.3067728|journal=[[Physics Today]]|language=en|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1063/1.3067728|via=|bibcode=1952PhT.....5i..19G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tiersten|first=Martin|date=2003-01-10|title=Errors in Goldstein’s Classical Mechanics|url=http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.1533731|journal=[[American Journal of Physics]]|volume=71|issue=2|pages=103–103|doi=10.1119/1.1533731|issn=0002-9505|via=|bibcode=2003AmJPh..71..103T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the death of its primary author in 2005, a new (third) edition of the book was released, with the collaboration of Charles P. Poole and John L. Safko.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goldstein|first=Herbert|last2=Poole|first2=Charles|last3=Safko|first3=John|date=2002-06-13|title=Classical Mechanics, 3rd ed.|url=http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/10.1119/1.1484149|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=70|issue=7|pages=782–783|doi=10.1119/1.1484149|issn=0002-9505|bibcode=2002AmJPh..70..782G}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the third edition, the book discusses at length various mathematically sophisticated reformations of Newtonian mechanics, namely [[analytical mechanics]], as applied to particles, rigid bodies and continua. In addition, it covers in some detail [[classical electromagnetism]], [[special relativity]], classical and relativistic field theory, [[chaos theory]] and [[fractal geometry]]. A brief discussion on [[general relativity]] is also included. There is an appendix on [[group theory]].

The '''Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty''' ({{lang-da|Udvalgene vedrørende Videnskabelig Uredelighed}}, or '''UVVU''')  are a set of three committees under the [[Danish Ministry of Research and Information Technology]]: a committee for natural science, agricultural and veterinary science and technical science; a committee for health and medical science; and a committee for social science and the humanities.   They have a common chairman.

Previously obscure, the DCSD became embroiled in controversy after its January 2003 decision that the 2001 book ''[[The Skeptical Environmentalist]]'' by [[Bjørn Lomborg]] was "clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice", due to the author's systematically biased choice of data, and ''objectively'' was scientifically irredeemable, but Lomborg himself could not be ''subjectively'' convicted of intentional or gross negligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rendtorff|first=Jacob Dahl|title=Videnskabsetik|year=2003|publisher=Samfundslitteratur|location=Frederiksberg|isbn=87-7867-182-5|edition=1. udgave.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lomborg had argued in his book that claims by [[environmentalist]]s about [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[deforestation]], and other matters are not scientifically substantiated. The DCSD further held that because of Lomborg's lack of scientific expertise, he had not shown intentional or gross negligence, and acquitted him of the accusations of scientific dishonesty.

In February 2003, Lomborg filed a complaint with the Ministry, and in December 2003, the Ministry found that the DCSD's handling of the investigation in the case had been improper, and remitted it for re-examination.  In March 2004, the DCSD stated that since its finding had been to acquit Lomborg of the charges of scientific dishonesty (although they had criticized his biased selection of data), there was no basis to re-open the investigation, and dismissed the case.

The original DCSD decision about Lomborg provoked a [[petition]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825145806/http://www.math.ku.dk/~dlando/indsamling.htm |date=August 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; among Danish academics. 308 scientists, many of them from the social sciences, criticised the DCSD's methods in the case and called for the DCSD to be disbanded.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v421/n6924/full/421681b.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Minister of Science, Technology, and Innovation then asked the Danish Research Agency to form an independent working group to review DCSD practices.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20071025142432/http://fi.dk/site/english/publications/2003/annual-report-2002-danish-committees-scientific-dishonesty ]&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, another group of Danish scientists collected over 600 signatures (primarily from the medical and [[natural science]]s community) to support the continued existence of the DCSD and presented their petition to the Danish Research Agency.&lt;ref name=disbandDCSD /&gt;

The DCSD was involved in another controversy investigating a paper on [[sex and intelligence]] authored by [[Helmuth Nyborg]]. After the DCSD cleared Nyborg of the charges of [[scientific misconduct]], two [[Aarhus University]] professors, Lise Togeby and Jens Mammen resigned from their positions in the DCSD, citing that the DCSD operated from too narrow of a framework. Togeby explained that "Roughly speaking, these committees can only decide whether a researcher has cheated or not. We cannot consider the issue of academic quality, or decide whether research has been carried out in accordance with good academic standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.au.dk/en/univers/campuslife/campuslife2007/dishonesty/ |title=Disagreement regarding academic dishonesty |publisher=Au.dk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="932">'''Electrochemical dualism''' is an [[obsolete scientific theory]] in [[chemistry]] relevant between around 1800 and around 1830 and pioneered by [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius]].&lt;ref&gt;''Jöns Jacob Berzelius'', Richard A. Pizzi, Today's Chemist At Work, 2004, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; The theory held that all molecules are salts composed of basic and acidic oxides. The compound [[potassium sulphate]] for example was viewed as a salt of K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Berzelius based his theory on investigations he conducted in collaboration with [[Wilhelm Hisinger]] on certain salts with the newly discovered [[voltaic pile]]. They observed that many compounds could be decomposed by an electric current in an acidic component at the positive pole and a basic component at the negative pole. The theory was ultimately challenged and made redundant by [[radical theory]].

[[File:Electron energy loss spectrum feature overview.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|Experimental electron energy loss spectrum, showing the major features: zero-loss peak, plasmon peaks and core loss edge.]]

In '''electron energy loss spectroscopy''' ('''EELS''') a material is exposed to a beam of [[electron]]s with a known, narrow range of [[kinetic energy|kinetic energies]]. Some of the electrons will undergo inelastic scattering, which means that they lose energy and have their paths slightly and randomly deflected.  The amount of energy loss can be measured via an [[electron spectrometer]] and interpreted in terms of what caused the energy loss.  Inelastic interactions include [[phonon]] excitations, inter- and intra-band transitions, [[plasmon]] excitations, inner shell [[ionization]]s, and [[Cherenkov radiation]].  The inner-shell ionizations are particularly useful for detecting the elemental components of a material.  For example, one might find that a larger-than-expected number of electrons comes through the material with 285&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]] less energy than they had when they entered the material.  This is approximately the amount of energy needed to remove an inner-shell electron from a carbon atom,  which can be taken as evidence that there is a significant amount of [[carbon]] present in the sample.  With some care, and looking at a wide range of energy losses, one can determine the types of atoms, and the numbers of atoms of each type, being struck by the beam.  The scattering angle (that is, the amount that the electron's path is deflected) can also be measured, giving information about the [[dispersion relation]] of whatever material excitation caused the inelastic scattering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Egerton |first1=R. F. |year=2009 |title=Electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the TEM |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |volume=72 |page=016502 |bibcode=2009RPPh...72a6502E |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/72/1/016502}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The technique was developed by [[James Hillier]] and RF Baker in the mid-1940s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last2=Hillier |first1=J. |last1=Baker |first2=R. F. |date=September 1944 |title=Microanalysis by means of electrons |journal=J. Appl. Phys. |volume=15 |issue=9 |pages=663–675 |doi=10.1063/1.1707491 |bibcode=1944JAP....15..663H}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was not widely used over the next 50 years, only becoming more widespread in research in the 1990s due to advances in microscope instrumentation and vacuum technology.  With modern instrumentation becoming widely available in laboratories worldwide, the technical and scientific developments from the mid-1990s have been rapid.  The technique is able to take advantage of modern aberration-corrected probe forming systems to attain spatial resolutions down to  ~0.1&amp;nbsp;nm, while with a monochromated electron source and/or careful deconvolution the energy resolution can be 0.1 eV or better.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rose |first=H.

==EELS and EDX==
EELS is spoken of as being complementary to [[Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy|energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy]] (variously called EDX, EDS, XEDS, etc.), which is another common spectroscopy technique available on many electron microscopes.  EDX excels at identifying the atomic composition of a material, is quite easy to use, and is particularly sensitive to heavier elements.  EELS has historically been a more difficult technique but is in principle capable of measuring atomic composition, chemical bonding, valence and conduction band electronic properties, surface properties, and element-specific pair distance distribution functions.{{sfn|Egerton|1996}} EELS tends to work best at relatively low atomic numbers, where the excitation edges tend to be sharp, well-defined, and at experimentally accessible energy losses (the signal being very weak beyond about 3 keV energy loss).  EELS is perhaps best developed for the elements ranging from carbon through the 3d transition metals (from scandium to zinc).&lt;ref&gt;Ahn C C (ed.) (2004) ''Transmission electron energy loss spectrometry in material science and the EELS Atlas'', Wiley, Weinheim, Germany, {{DOI|10.1002/3527605495}}, {{ISBN|3527405658}}&lt;/ref&gt; For carbon, an experienced spectroscopist can tell at a glance the differences between diamond, graphite, amorphous carbon, and "mineral" carbon (such as the carbon appearing in carbonates).  The spectra of 3d transition metals can be analyzed to identify the oxidation states of the atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.micron.2006.06.017|volume=38|issue=3|pages=224–230|last=Riedl|first=T.|author2=T. Gemming |author3=W. Gruner |author4=J. Acker |author5=K. Wetzig |title=Determination of manganese valency in La1−xSrxMnO3 using ELNES in the (S)TEM|journal=Micron|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cu(I), for instance, has a different so-called "white-line" intensity ratio than does Cu(II).  This ability to "fingerprint" different forms of the same element is a strong advantage of EELS over EDX.  The difference is mainly due to the difference in energy resolution between the two techniques (~1 eV or better for EELS, perhaps a few tens of eV for EDX).

==Variants==
[[File:Electron energy loss spectroscopy coreloss lsmo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Example of inner shell ionization edge (core loss) EELS data from La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, acquired on a [[scanning transmission electron microscopy|scanning transmission electron microscope]].]]
There are several basic flavors of EELS, primarily classified by the geometry and by the kinetic energy of the incident electrons (typically measured in kiloelectron-volts, or keV).  Probably the most common today is transmission EELS, in which the kinetic energies are typically 100 to 300 keV and the incident electrons pass entirely through the material sample.  Usually this occurs in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), although some dedicated systems exist which enable extreme resolution in terms of energy and momentum transfer at the expense of spatial resolution.

Other flavors include reflection EELS (including reflection high-energy electron energy-loss spectroscopy (RHEELS)), typically at 10 to 30 keV, and aloof EELS (sometimes called near-field EELS), in which the electron beam does not in fact strike the sample but instead interacts with it via the long-ranged Coulomb interaction. Aloof EELS is particularly sensitive to surface properties but is limited to very small energy losses such as those associated with surface plasmons or direct interband transitions.

Within transmission EELS, the technique is further subdivided into valence EELS (which measures plasmons and interband transitions) and inner-shell ionization EELS (which provides much the same information as [[x-ray absorption spectroscopy]], but from much smaller volumes of material). The dividing line between the two, while somewhat ill-defined, is in the vicinity of 50 eV energy loss.

== The Electron Energy Loss (EEL) spectrum ==
The EEL spectrum can be roughly split into two different regions: the low-loss spectrum (up until about 50eV in energy loss) and the high-loss spectrum. The low-loss spectrum contains the zero-loss peak as well as the plasmon peaks, and contains information about the band structure and dielectric properties of the sample. The high-loss spectrum contains the ionisation edges that arise due to inner shell ionisations in the sample. These are characteristic to the species present in the sample, and as such can be used to obtain accurate information about the chemistry of a sample.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hofer|first=F. et. al|date=2016|title=Fundamentals of electron energy loss spectroscopy|url=http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1757-899X/109/1/012007/pdf|journal=IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering|volume=109|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Thickness measurements==
EELS allows quick and reliable measurement of local thickness in [[transmission electron microscopy]].{{sfn|Egerton|1996}} The most efficient procedure is the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iakoubovskii |first1=K. |last2=Mitsuishi |first2=K. |last3=Nakayama |first3=Y. |last4=Furuya |first4=K. |year=2008 |title=Thickness measurements with electron energy loss spectroscopy |journal=Microscopy Research and Technique |volume=71 |issue=8 |pages=626–31 |doi=10.1002/jemt.20597 |pmid=18454473 |url=http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587374:1/component/escidoc:1587373/mrt626.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Measure the energy loss spectrum in the energy range about −5..200 eV (wider better). Such measurement is quick (milliseconds) and thus can be applied to materials normally unstable under electron beams.
* Analyse the spectrum: (i) extract zero-loss peak (ZLP) using standard routines; (ii) calculate integrals under the ZLP (''I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'') and under the whole spectrum (''I'').
* The thickness ''t'' is calculated as mfp*''ln(I/I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)''. Here mfp is the mean free path of electron inelastic scattering, which has recently been tabulated for most elemental solids and oxides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iakoubovskii |first1=Konstantin |last2=Mitsuishi |first2=Kazutaka |last3=Nakayama |first3=Yoshiko |last4=Furuya |first4=Kazuo |year=2008 |title=Mean free path of inelastic electron scattering in elemental solids and oxides using transmission electron microscopy: Atomic number dependent oscillatory behavior |journal=Physical Review B |volume=77 |issue=10 |bibcode=2008PhRvB..77j4102I |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.77.104102 |url=http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587372:1/component/escidoc:1587371/Prb104102.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spatial resolution of this procedure is limited by the plasmon localization and is about 1&amp;nbsp;nm,{{sfn|Egerton|1996}} meaning that spatial thickness maps can be measured in [[scanning transmission electron microscopy]] with ~1&amp;nbsp;nm resolution.

==Pressure measurements==
The intensity and position of low-energy EELS peaks are affected by pressure. This fact allows mapping local pressure with ~1&amp;nbsp;nm spatial resolution.
* ''Peak shift method'' is reliable and straightforward. The peak position is calibrated by independent (usually optical) measurement using a [[diamond anvil cell]]. However, the spectral resolution of most EEL spectrometers (0.3-2 eV, typically 1 eV) is often too crude for the small pressure-induced shifts. Therefore, the sensitivity and accuracy of this method is relatively poor. Nevertheless, pressures as small as 0.2 GPa inside helium bubbles in aluminum have been measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taverna |first1=D. |last2=Kociak |first2=M. |last3=Stéphan |first3=O. |last4=Fabre |first4=A. |last5=Finot |first5=E. |last6=Décamps |first6=B. |last7=Colliex |first7=C. |year=2008 |title=Probing Physical Properties of Confined Fluids within Individual Nanobubbles |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=100 |issue=3 |arxiv=0704.2306 |bibcode = 2008PhRvL.100c5301T |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.035301 |pmid=18232994 |page=035301}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Peak intensity method'' relies on pressure-induced change in the intensity of dipole-forbidden transitions. Because this intensity is zero for zero pressure the method is relatively sensitive and accurate. However, it requires existence of allowed and forbidden transitions of similar energies and thus is only applicable to specific systems, e.g., Xe bubbles in aluminum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Iakoubovskii |first1=Konstantin |last2=Mitsuishi |first2=Kazutaka |last3=Furuya |first3=Kazuo |year=2008 |title=Structure and pressure inside Xe nanoparticles embedded in Al |journal=Physical Review B |volume=78 |issue=6 |bibcode=2008PhRvB..78f4105I |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.78.064105 |url=http://pubman.nims.go.jp/pubman/item/escidoc:1587370:1/component/escidoc:1587369/Prb64105.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EELS in confocal geometry==
[[Scanning confocal electron energy loss microscopy]] (SCEELM) is a new analytical microscopy tool that enables a double corrected transmission electron microscope to achieve sub-10&amp;nbsp;nm depth resolution in depth sectioning imaging of nanomaterials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Xin |first1=Huolin L. |display-authors=etal |title=Scanning Confocal Electron Energy-Loss Microscopy Using Valence-Loss Signals|year=2013 |journal=Microscopy and Microanalysis |volume=19|issue=4 |doi=10.1017/S1431927613001438 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1017/S1431927613001438|bibcode = 2013MiMic..19.1036X |pages=1036–1049}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously termed as energy filtered scanning confocal electron microscopy due to the lack to full spectrum acquisition capability (only a small energy window on the order of 5 eV can be used at a time). SCEELM takes advantages of the newly developed chromatic aberration corrector which allows electrons of more than 100 eV of energy spread to be focused to roughly the same focal plane. It has been demonstrated that a simultaneous acquisition of the zero loss, low-loss, and core loss signals up to 400 eV in the confocal geometry with depth discrimination capability.

[[File:Infans Philosophicus tres agnoscit patres, ut Orion.png|thumb|The conception of the philosophical child, allegorized as the conception of [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]] by three fathers.]]

The '''{{lang|la|filius philosophorum}}''' ([[Latin]] for "the philosophers' child", i.e. made by the true students of philosophy) is a symbol in [[alchemy]].  In some texts it is equated with the [[philosopher's stone]] ({{lang|la|lapis philosophorum}}), but in others it assumes its own symbolic meanings.  Other terms for the {{lang|la|filius philosophorum}} include '''{{lang|la|filius sapientiae}}''' ("child of wisdom"), '''{{lang|la|infans noster}}''' ("our child"),  '''{{lang|la|infans solaris}}''' ("sun child"), '''{{lang|la|infans lunaris}}''' ("moon child"), and '''{{lang|la|infans solaris lunaris}}''' ("sun moon child").

There are several images that have been used to represent the {{lang|la|filius philosophorum}}.  Among these are the transformed hermaphroditic [[Hermes Trismegistus|Hermes]], the child of the Red King and the White Queen (the Sun and Moon), the child of the egg, and the three-fathered [[Orion (mythology)|Orion]].

The {{lang|la|filius philosophorum}} was also one of the [[Jungian archetypes]] analyzed by the Swiss psychologist.

'''Flower induction''' is the physiological process in the plant by which the [[meristem|shoot apical meristem]] becomes competent to develop [[flower]]s. Biochemical changes at the apex, particularly those caused by [[cytokinins]], accompany this process. Usually flower induction is followed by [[flower differentiation]], with some notable exceptions such as in [[kiwifruit]], where the two processes are separated. Flower induction can be reversed, but flower differentiation is irreversible, because anatomical changes are in place.

[[File:Giuseppa Eleonora Barbapiccola.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Giuseppa Barbapiccola, engraved by Neapolitan artist [[Francesco De Grado]]]]

'''Giuseppa Eleonora Barbapiccola''' (1702 – ca 1740) was an Italian natural philosopher, poet and translator. She is best known for her translation of [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' to [[Italian language|Italian]] in 1722.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=M.B.|last=Oglive|year=2000|title=The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century|isbn=0-415-92040-X|publisher=Routledge|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her preface to her translation of ''Principles of Philosophy'', Barbapiccola claimed that women, in contrast to the belief of her contemporaries, were not intellectually inferior out of nature, but because of their lack of education. Neapolitan scholars credited Barbapiccola as the individual who brought [[Cartesianism]] thought to Italy.

==Background==
Barbapiccola was probably born in Naples, and her family seemed to have originally come from Salerno. Her uncle was Tommaso Maria Alfani, an acclaimed Dominican preacher in Naples and a correspondent of [[Giambattista Vico]]. Although nothing is known of her parents, it is arguable that her uncle influenced her upbringing in education and learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agnesi|first=Maria Gaetana|title=The Contest for Knowledge|isbn=0-226-01055-4|date=2005|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was a member of the [[Accademia degli Arcadi]] in Bologna under the name ''Myristic''. She often published her poems in collaboration with her friend, the poet Luisa Vico. 

==Education==
There is no known information on Barbapiccola’s formal education. However, it is suggested that much of her knowledge accumulated by means of conversations in Neapolitan salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ogilvie|first=Marilyn Bailey|title=Women in Science: Antiquity through the Nineteenth Century|isbn=0-262-15031-X|date=1986|publisher=The Massachusetts Institute of Technology|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In particular, it was most likely in the home of Italian philosopher [[Giambattista Vico]] where she obtained most of her knowledge, as Vico was the father of her close friend, Luisa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kersey|first=Ethel M.|title=Women Philosophers: A Bio-Critical Source Book|isbn=0-313-25720-5|date=1989|publisher=Greenwood Press|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; From her correspondence with Vico's daughter and with Vico himself it can be deducted that she was a close friend of the Vico family and a noted member of the Neapolitan intellectual circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Feminist Encyclopedia of Italian Literature |author=Rinaldina Russell |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997 |isbn=9780313294358|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preface: The role for women and education==
In the lengthy preface to her translation of [[René Descartes]]' ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' to [[Italian language|Italian]], published in 1722, Barbapiccola defended women's intellectual ability, their right to meaningful education, and their claim to a voice in an intellectual discourse dominated by men. She starts with an apology and defends her translation against the arguments for women's intellectual inferiority, such as those advanced by [[Homer]], [[Herodotus]], and [[Claude Fleury]]. Barbapiccola subsequently provides an account of women's achievements throughout history, citing among others [[Daphne]], [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] and [[Anne Lefevre]]. She also seeks to disseminate the [[Cartesianism|Cartesian philosophy]] of Descartes, who accorded intellectual authority to women. She dedicated the translation to [[Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia|Queen Elizabeth Stuart of Bohemia]], with whom Descartes maintained an extended philosophical exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Feminist Encyclopedia of Italian Literature |author=Rinaldina Russell |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997 |isbn=9780313294358|pages=27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box

Barbapiccola identified women as the beneficiaries of her translation. As she seeks to counterbalance the deficiencies of women's traditional education in "the [[Catechism]], sewing, diverse little works, singing, dance, fashion dress, courteous behaviour, and polite speech". Instead she seeks to impart the clear and coherent method of intellectual inquiry of Cartesian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= The Feminist Encyclopedia of Italian Literature |author=Rinaldina Russell |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1997 |isbn=9780313294358|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VFPt horseshoe-magnet.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|Horseshoe magnet with computed magnetic field lines. The two magnetic poles are in close vicinity, which concentrates the field lines and creates a strong magnetic field.]]

A '''horseshoe magnet''' is a [[magnet]] made in the shape of a [[horseshoe]]. The magnet has two magnetic poles close together. This shape creates a strong [[magnetic field]] between the poles. 

It is one type of permanent magnet, meaning that it stays magnetized, as opposed to an [[electromagnet]], the magnetic field of which can be started and stopped.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wisegeek.org/what-is-a-horseshoe-magnet.htm|title=What is a Horseshoe Magnet? (with pictures)|newspaper=wiseGEEK|access-date=2016-11-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of a horseshoe magnet's shape is to place the poles as close together as possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYIwT_dD77cC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=horseshoe+magnet+created+by+bending+a+bar+magnet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik6rHm6LvUAhVdHGMKHTwhCtMQ6AEIODAD#v=onepage&amp;q=horseshoe%20magnet%20created%20by%20bending%20a%20bar%20magnet&amp;f=false|title=Magnets: Magnetism|last=Lynette|first=Rachel|date=2008|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree Library|isbn=9781432910976|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total [[magnetic flux]] is the same,{{efn-lr|This flux depends on the amount of magnetised material.|group=Notes}} but the [[magnetic field|field]] is greater, as it is spread over a smaller volume. A horseshoe is used, rather than a simpler C-shaped magnet, which is also used, because this places the maximum amount of magnetised material into the magnet, for given dimensions around the poles. A particularly large horseshoe magnet is U-shaped with long parallel sides, rather than the classical horseshoe.

Electromagnets are also constructed as horseshoes. They may have either one or two coils wound on them. As most coils are wound by machine, the coil formers are straight. They are thus usually placed as two coils, one on each side of a U-shaped horseshoe.

A horseshoe magnet can be created by bending a [[bar magnet]] into a horseshoe shape.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcAKAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA669&amp;dq=A+horseshoe+magnet+is+a+magnet+made+in+the+shape+of+a+horseshoe.&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwm5Oz6LvUAhUIwGMKHTeGChIQ6AEIJjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=A%20horseshoe%20magnet%20is%20a%20magnet%20made%20in%20the%20shape%20of%20a%20horseshoe.&amp;f=false|title=College Physics: Reasoning and Relationships|last=Giordano|first=Nicholas|date=2012-07-27|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1285225341|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Index Catalogue|IC]] 4970''' is an [[unbarred lenticular galaxy]] of [[galaxy morphological classification|type]] ''{{abbr|SA0^- pec:|early unbarred lenticular, peculiar}}'' in the constellation [[Pavo (constellation)|Pavo]]. It is {{convert|212|e6ly|Mpc|lk=on}} from Earth and is [[interacting galaxy|interacting]] with the barred spiral galaxy {{nowrap|[[NGC 6872]]}}.&lt;ref name="nasa20130110"/&gt; It was discovered on 21 September 1900 by American astronomer [[DeLisle Stewart]].&lt;ref name="seligman"/&gt;

== Interaction with NGC 6872 ==
[[File:An interacting colossus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|IC 4970 and NGC 6872]]

IC 4970 is located a few [[arcsecond]]s away from the much larger [[barred spiral galaxy]] [[NGC 6872]], and the two are known to be interacting with each other. Horrelou and Koribalski (2007) reported on a computer simulation used to determine how the two galaxies were interacting. The study concluded that {{nowrap|IC 4970}} approached {{nowrap|NGC 6872}} nearly along the plane of its spiral disk, making a closest approach approximately 130 million years ago resulting in the latter's current highly elongated shape.&lt;ref name="Horellou2007"/&gt;

An [[ultraviolet]]-to-[[infrared]] study by Eufrasio, ''et al.'' (2013), using data from [[GALEX]], [[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]], and other resources found that the interaction between the two galaxies appears to have triggered significant star formation in the northeastern arm of {{nowrap|NGC 6872}} beginning about {{convert|40|kpc|e3ly|disp=flip}} from its nucleus.&lt;ref name="Eufrasio2013"/&gt; The same appears to have also occurred in the southwestern arm.&lt;ref name="nasa20130110"/&gt; A bright ultraviolet source was discovered at the end of the northeastern arm, around {{convert|90|kpc|e3ly|disp=flip}} from the nucleus, which may be a [[dwarf galaxy|tidal dwarf galaxy]] formed out of the interaction between {{nowrap|IC 4970}} and {{nowrap|NGC 6872}}.&lt;ref name="Eufrasio2013"/&gt; The bright ultraviolet nature of this cluster indicates that it contains stars less than 200 million years old, which roughly coincides with the timeframe of the collision.&lt;ref name="nasa20130110"/&gt;

'''Johann Andreas Wagner''' (21 March 1797 &amp;ndash; 17 December 1861) was a [[Germany|German]] [[palaeontologist]], [[zoologist]] and [[archaeologist]] who wrote several important works on palaeontology.

==Career==

Wagner was a professor at the [[University of Munich]], and curator of the [[Zoologische Staatssammlung]] (State Zoology Collection).
He was the author of ''Die Geographische Verbreitung der Säugethiere Dargestellt'' (1844–46).

Wagner was a Christian [[Creationism|creationist]].&lt;ref&gt;Rupke, Nicolaas A. (2005). ''Neither Creation nor Evolution: The Third Way in Mid-Nineteenth-Century Thinking about the Origin of Species''. Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 10: 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pikermi==
In his travels to the fossil beds of [[Pikermi]], Wagner discovered and described fossil remains of [[mastodon]], ''[[Dinotherium]]'', ''[[Hipparion]]'', two species of giraffe, antelope and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://geology.com/publications/lyell/ch14.shtml Upper Miocene Formations of Greece at Pikermi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603205713/http://geology.com/publications/lyell/ch14.shtml |date=2012-06-03 }} on Geology.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mqxAAAAAcAAJ Neue Beiträge zur Kenntniss der fossilen Säugthier-Überreste von Pikermi] on [[Google books]], by Wagner, Munich, 1857&lt;/ref&gt; His collaboration with [[Johannes Roth]] on these fossils became a major textbook in palaeontology, known as "Roth &amp; Wagner", in which the "bones were much broken, and no complete skeleton was found with all the parts united".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3KpAAAAAcAAJ Die fossilen Knochenüberreste von Pikermi in Griechenland] on [[Google books]], by Johannes Rudolf Roth and Johann Andreas Wagner, Munich, 1854&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mF5KAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA182 "bones were much broken"] in the [[Edinburgh New Philosophical Journal]], Volume 6, 1857, page 182&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Wagner is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of South American snake, ''[[Diaphorolepis wagneri]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011). ''The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. {{ISBN|978-1-4214-0135-5}}. ("Wagner, J.A.", p. 278).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing 747-8 N747EX First Flight.jpg|thumb|right|275px|The wings of the [[Boeing 747-8F]] generate many tonnes of lift.]]

A [[fluid]] flowing past the surface of a body exerts a [[force]] on it. '''Lift''' is the [[Vector (geometric)#Vector components|component]] of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction.&lt;ref name="What is Lift"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center|title=What is Lift?|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/lift1.html|accessdate=March 4, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309130515/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/lift1.html|archivedate=March 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contrasts with the [[drag (physics)|drag]] force, which is the component of the force parallel to the flow direction. Lift conventionally acts in an upward direction in order to counter the force of [[gravity]], but it can act in any direction at right angles to the flow.

If the surrounding fluid is air, the force is called an [[aerodynamic force]]. In water or any other liquid, it is called a [[Fluid dynamics|hydrodynamic force]].

Dynamic lift is distinguished from other kinds of lift in fluids. [[Aerostatics|Aerostatic]] lift or [[buoyancy]], in which an internal fluid is lighter than the surrounding fluid, does not require movement and is used by balloons, blimps, dirigibles, boats, and submarines. [[Planing (boat)|Planing lift]], in which only the lower portion of the body is immersed in a liquid flow, is used by motorboats, surfboards, and water-skis.

==Overview==
[[File:Airfoil lift and drag.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Lift is defined as the component of the total aerodynamic force perpendicular to the flow direction, and drag is the component parallel to the flow direction.]]

A [[fluid]] flowing past the surface of a body exerts a [[surface force|force]] on it. It makes no difference whether the fluid is flowing past a stationary body or the body is moving through a stationary volume of fluid. '''Lift''' is the [[Vector (geometric)#Vector components|component]] of this force that is perpendicular to the oncoming flow direction.&lt;ref name="What is Lift"/&gt; Lift is always accompanied by a [[drag (physics)|drag]] force, which is the component of the surface force parallel to the flow direction.

Lift is most commonly associated with the [[wing]]s of [[fixed-wing aircraft]], although it is more generally generated by many other [[streamlined]] bodies such as [[propeller]]s, [[Kite types|kites]], [[helicopter rotor]]s, [[wing (automotive)|racing car wings]], maritime [[sail]]s, and [[wind turbine]]s in air, and by [[sailboat]] [[keel]]s, ship's [[rudder]]s, and [[hydrofoil]]s in water. Lift is also exploited in the animal world, especially by [[bird]]s, [[bat]]s, and [[insect]]s, and even in the plant world by the seeds of certain trees.&lt;ref&gt;Kulfan (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

While the common meaning of the word "[[wikt:lift#English|lift]]" assumes that lift opposes weight, lift can be in any direction with respect to gravity, since it is defined with respect to the direction of flow rather than to the direction of gravity. When an aircraft is [[cruise (flight)|cruising]] in straight and level flight, most of the lift opposes gravity.&lt;ref&gt;The ''amount'' of aerodynamic lift will be (usually slightly) more or less than gravity depending on the thrust level and vertical alignment of the thrust line. A side thrust line will result in some lift opposing side thrust as well.&lt;/ref&gt; However, when an aircraft is [[climb (aeronautics)|climbing]], [[Descent (aircraft)|descending]], or [[Banked turn#Aviation|banking]] in a turn the lift is tilted with respect to the vertical.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 14.6&lt;/ref&gt; Lift may also act as [[downforce]] in some [[Aerobatics|aerobatic manoeuvres]], or on the wing on a racing car. Lift may also be largely horizontal, for instance on a sailing ship.

The Lift discussed in this article is mainly in relation to airfoils, although marine [[hydrofoils]] and propellers share the same physical principles and work in the same way, despite differences between air and water such as density, compressibility, and viscosity.

==Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil==
[[Image:Airfoil cross section.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A cross-section of a wing defines an airfoil shape.]]

An [[airfoil]] is a streamlined shape that is capable of generating significantly more lift than drag.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J., ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.2&lt;/ref&gt; A flat plate can generate lift, but not as much as a streamlined airfoil, and with somewhat higher drag.

There are several ways to explain how an airfoil generates lift. Some are more complicated or more physically rigorous than others; some have been shown to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;"There are many theories of how lift is generated. Unfortunately, many of the theories found in encyclopedias, on web sites, and even in some textbooks are incorrect, causing unnecessary confusion for students."

That's where the complexity enters in because we are dealing with a fluid. ...The cause for the flow turning is the simultaneous conservation of mass, momentum (both linear and angular), and energy by the fluid. And it's confusing for a fluid because the mass can move and redistribute itself (unlike a solid), but can only do so in ways that conserve momentum (mass times velocity) and energy (mass times velocity squared)... A change in velocity in one direction can cause a change in velocity in a perpendicular direction in a fluid, which doesn't occur in solid mechanics... So exactly describing how the flow turns is a complex problem; too complex for most people to visualize. So we make up simplified "models". And when we simplify, we leave something out.

===Flow deflection and Newton's laws===
[[File:AirfoilDeflectionLift_W3C.svg|thumb|240px|right|When an airfoil deflects air downwards, Newton's third law requires that the air must exert an equal upward reaction on the airfoil.]]

An airfoil generates lift by exerting a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to [[Newton's third law]], the air must exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is lift.&lt;ref&gt;"...the effect of the wing is to give the air stream a downward velocity component. The reaction force of the deflected air mass must then act on the wing to give it an equal and opposite upward component." In: {{citation|first1=David|last1=Halliday|first2=Robert|last2=Resnick|title=Fundamentals of Physics 3rd Ed.|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=378}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson and Eberhardt 2001"&gt;Anderson and Eberhardt (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Langewiesche 1944"&gt;Langewiesche (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"When air flows over and under an airfoil inclined at a small angle to its direction, the air is turned from its course. Now, when a body is moving in a uniform speed in a straight line, it requires force to alter either its direction or speed. Therefore, the sails exert a force on the wind and, since action and reaction are equal and opposite, the wind exerts a force on the sails." In: {{citation|first1=John|last1=Morwood|title=Sailing Aerodynamics|publisher=Adlard Coles Limited|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The airflow changes direction as it passes the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then Newton's third law requires the air to exert an upward force on the airfoil; thus a reaction force, lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In the case of an airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward force on the air and the air exerts an upward force on the wing.&lt;ref&gt;"Lift is a force generated by turning a moving fluid... If the body is shaped, moved, or inclined in such a way as to produce a net deflection or turning of the flow, the local velocity is changed in magnitude, direction, or both. Changing the velocity creates a net force on the body." {{cite web|publisher=NASA Glenn Research Center|title=Lift from Flow Turning|url=http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html|accessdate=July 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110705131653/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/right2.html|archivedate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Essentially, due to the presence of the wing (its shape and inclination to the incoming flow, the so-called angle of attack), the flow is given a downward deflection. It is Newton’s third law at work here, with the flow then exerting a reaction force on the wing in an upward direction, thus generating lift."

J.; ''Aerodynamics'', Pitman 1975, p. 76: "This lift force has its reaction in the downward momentum which is imparted to the air as it flows over the wing. Thus the lift of the wing is equal to the rate of transport of downward momentum of this air."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"...if the air is to produce an upward force on the wing, the wing must produce a downward force on the air. Because under these circumstances air cannot sustain a force, it is deflected, or accelerated, downward. Newton's second law gives us the means for quantifying the lift force: F&lt;sub&gt;lift&lt;/sub&gt; = m∆v/∆t = ∆(mv)/∆t. The lift force is equal to the time rate of change of momentum of the air." {{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Norman F.|year=1972|title=Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics|journal=The Physics Teacher|volume=|page=451|doi=10.1119/1.2352317|bibcode=1972PhTea..10..451S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The downward turning of the flow is not produced solely by the lower surface of the airfoil, and the air flow above the airfoil accounts for much of the downward-turning action.

===Increased flow speed and Bernoulli's principle===

[[Bernoulli's principle]] states: "In a flow where no energy is being added or taken away, the sum of its various energies is a constant: consequently where the velocity increases the pressure decreases and vice versa."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Norman F.|title=Bernoulli, Newton and Dynamic Lift Part I|journal=School Science and Mathematics|volume=73|issue=3|page=181|doi=10.1111/j.1949-8594.1973.tb08998.x|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, there is a direct mathematical relationship between the pressure and the speed, so if one knows the speed at all points within the airflow one can calculate the pressure, and vice versa. For any airfoil generating lift, there must be a pressure imbalance, i.e. lower average air pressure on the top than on the bottom. Bernoulli's principle states that this pressure difference must be accompanied by a speed difference.

====Conservation of mass====
[[File:Streamlines around a NACA 0012.svg|thumb|300px|Streamlines and streamtubes around an airfoil generating lift. Note the narrower streamtubes above and the wider streamtubes below.]]

Starting with the flow pattern observed in both theory and experiments, the increased flow speed over the upper surface can be explained in terms of streamtube pinching and [[conservation of mass]].&lt;ref name=Anderson&gt;Anderson (2004) - Section 5.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

For incompressible flow, the rate of volume flow (e.g. volume units per minute) must be constant within each streamtube since matter is not created or destroyed. If a streamtube becomes narrower, the flow speed must increase in the narrower region to maintain the constant flow rate, to satisfy the principle of [[conservation of mass]].&lt;ref&gt;"The effect of squeezing streamlines together as they divert around the front of an airfoil shape is that the velocity must increase to keep the mass flow constant since the area between the streamlines has become smaller." Charles N. Eastlake ''An Aerodynamicist’s View of Lift, Bernoulli, and Newton'' THE PHYSICS TEACHER Vol. 40, March 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=10 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411055333/http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf|archivedate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper streamtubes constrict as they flow up and around the airfoil. Conservation of mass says that the flow speed must increase as the stream tube area decreases.&lt;ref name=Anderson/&gt; Similarly, the lower streamtubes expand and their flowrate slows.

From Bernoulli's principle, the pressure on the upper surface where the flow is moving faster is lower than the pressure on the lower surface where it is moving slower. This pressure difference creates a net aerodynamic force, pointing upward.

===Limitations of the simplified explanations===

As explained below under [[#A more comprehensive physical explanation|A more comprehensive physical explanation]], producing a lift force requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli's principle. The simplified explanations given above are therefore incomplete because they define lift in terms of only one or the other. And depending on the details, they have other shortcomings as well.

The explanation based on [[#Flow deflection and Newton's laws|Flow deflection and Newton's laws]] is correct but is incomplete. It does not explain how the airfoil can impart downward turning to a much deeper swath of the flow than it actually touches. Further, it doesn't explain how the pressure differences in the horizontal direction are sustained. That is, it leaves out the Bernoulli part of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.12&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanations based on [[#Increased flow speed and Bernoulli's principle|Increased flow speed and Bernoulli's principle]] first try to establish that there is higher flow speed over the upper surface, but they fail to explain correctly what causes the flow to speed up:

*The [[#Conservation of mass|Conservation of mass]] explanation that relies on narrowing of the streamtubes over the upper surface does not explain why the streamtubes change size. To see why the air flows the way it does requires more sophisticated analysis.&lt;ref&gt;"There is no way to predict, from Bernoulli's equation alone, what the pattern of streamlines will be for a particular wing." Halliday and Resnick ''Fundamentals of Physics'' 3rd Ed. Extended p. 378&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The generation of lift may be explained by starting from the shape of streamtubes above and below an airfoil. With a constriction above and an expansion below, it is easy to demonstrate lift, again via the Bernoulli equation. However, the reason for the shape of the streamtubes remains obscure..."

But, as the above discussion suggests, our understanding is not complete with this explanation. The problem is that we are missing a vital piece when we apply Bernoulli’s principle. We can calculate the pressures around the wing if we know the speed of the air over and under the wing, but how do we determine the speed?"

*Sometimes a geometrical argument is offered to demonstrate why the streamtubes change size: it is asserted that the top "obstructs" or "constricts" the air more than the bottom, hence narrower streamtubes. For conventional wings that are flat on the bottom and curved on top this makes some intuitive sense. But it does not explain how flat plates, symmetric airfoils, sailboat sails, or conventional airfoils flying upside down can generate lift, and attempts to calculate lift based on the amount of constriction do not predict experimental results.&lt;ref&gt;"The problem with the 'Venturi' theory is that it attempts to provide us with the velocity based on an incorrect assumption (the constriction of the flow produces the velocity field). We can calculate a velocity based on this assumption, and use Bernoulli's equation to compute the pressure, and perform the pressure-area calculation and the answer we get does not agree with the lift that we measure for a given airfoil."

*A common version that relies on equal-transit-time is simply wrong, as explained below under [[#False explanation based on equal transit-time|False explanation based on equal transit-time]]. 

Bernoulli-only explanations imply that a speed difference arises from causes other than a pressure difference, and that the speed difference then leads to a pressure difference by Bernoulli’s principle. This implied one-way causation is a misconception. The real cause-and-effect relationship between pressure and velocity is reciprocal. Finally, Bernoulli-only explanations don't explain how the pressure differences in the vertical direction are sustained. That is, they leave out the downward-turning part of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt; McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.12 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative explanations, misconceptions, and controversies===

Many alternative explanations for the generation of lift by an airfoil have been put forward, most intended to explain the phenomenon of lift to a general audience. Although the explanations may share features in common with the explanations above, additional assumptions and simplifications may be introduced. Some explanations introduce assumptions which proved to be wrong, such as ''equal transit-time'', and some used controversial terminology, such as "Coanda effect".

====False explanation based on equal transit-time====
[[File:Equal transit-time NASA wrong1.gif|thumb|right|586px|An illustration of the incorrect equal transit-time explanation of airfoil lift.]]

Basic or popular sources often describe the "equal transit-time" theory of lift, which incorrectly assumes that the parcels of air that divide at the leading edge of an airfoil must rejoin at the trailing edge, forcing the air traveling along the longer upper surface to go faster. Bernoulli's principle is then cited to conclude that since the air moves slower along the bottom of the wing, the air pressure must be higher, pushing the wing up.&lt;ref&gt;"The airfoil of the airplane wing, according to the textbook explanation that is more or less standard in the United States, has a special shape with more curvature on top than on the bottom; consequently, the air must travel farther over the top surface than over the bottom surface. Because the air must make the trip over the top and bottom surfaces in the same elapsed time ..., the velocity over the top surface will be greater than over the bottom. According to Bernoulli's theorem, this velocity difference produces a pressure difference which is lift." ''Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics'' Norman F. Smith ''The Physics Teacher'' November 1972 Volume 10, Issue 8, p. 451 [http://scitation.aip.org/getpdf/servlet/GetPDFServlet?filetype=pdf&amp;id=PHTEAH000010000008000451000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;doi=10.1119/1.2352317&amp;prog=normal] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is no physical principle that requires equal transit time and experimental results show that this assumption is false.&lt;ref&gt;"Unfortunately, this explanation [fails] on three counts. First, an airfoil need not have more curvature on its top than on its bottom. Airplanes can and do fly with perfectly symmetrical airfoils; that is with airfoils that have the ''same'' curvature top and bottom. Second, even if a humped-up (cambered) shape is used, the claim that the air must traverse the curved top surface in the same time as it does the flat bottom surface...is fictional. We can quote no physical law that tells us this. Third—and this is the most serious—the common textbook explanation, and the diagrams that accompany it, describe a force on the wing with no net disturbance to the airstream. This constitutes a violation of Newton's third law." ''Bernoulli and Newton in Fluid Mechanics'' Norman F.

The assertion that the air must arrive simultaneously at the trailing edge is sometimes referred to as the "equal transit-time fallacy".&lt;ref&gt;A false explanation for lift has been put forward in mainstream books, and even in scientific exhibitions. Known as the "equal transit-time" explanation, it states that the parcels of air which are divided by an airfoil must rejoin again; because of the greater curvature (and hence longer path) of the upper surface of an aerofoil, the air going over the top must go faster in order to 'catch up' with the air flowing around the bottom. Therefore, because of its higher speed the pressure of the air above the airfoil must be lower. Despite the fact that this 'explanation' is probably the most common of all, it is false. It has recently been dubbed the "Equal transit-time fallacy".{{cite web|url=http://www.aviationexplorer.com/fixed_wing_aircraft.htm|title=Fixed-wing aircraft facts and how aircraft fly|accessdate=July 7, 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603043832/http://aviationexplorer.com/fixed_wing_aircraft.htm|archivedate=June 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;...it leaves the impression that Professor Bernoulli is somehow to blame for the "equal transit time" fallacy... {{cite web|url=http://www.av8n.com/fly/lift.htm|author=John S.

====Controversy regarding the Coandă effect====
{{Main article|Coandă effect}}

In its original sense, the ''Coandă effect'' refers to the tendency of a [[Jet (fluid)|fluid jet]] to stay attached to an adjacent surface that curves away from the flow, and the resultant [[Entrainment (hydrodynamics)|entrainment]] of ambient air into the flow. The effect is named for [[Henri Coandă]], the [[Romania]]n aerodynamicist who exploited it in many of his patents.

More broadly, some consider the effect to include the tendency of any fluid [[boundary layer]] to adhere to a curved surface, not just the boundary layer accompanying a fluid jet. It is in this broader sense that the Coandă effect is used by some to explain why airflow remains attached to the top side of an airfoil.&lt;ref name="scotteberhart"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/AERO/airflylvl3.htm|last=Anderson|first=David|last2=Eberhart|first2=Scott|title=How Airplanes Fly: A Physical Description of Lift|year=1999|accessdate=June 4, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126200755/http://www.allstar.fiu.edu/aero/airflylvl3.htm|archivedate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jef Raskin]],&lt;ref name="raskin"&gt;{{Citation|url=http://jef.raskincenter.org/published/coanda_effect.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928072421/http://jef.raskincenter.org/published/coanda_effect.html|archivedate=September 28, 2007|title=Coanda Effect: Understanding Why Wings Work|last=Raskin|first=Jef|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, describes a simple demonstration, using a straw to blow over the upper surface of a wing. The wing deflects upwards, thus demonstrating that the Coandă effect creates lift. This demonstration correctly demonstrates the Coandă effect as a fluid jet (the exhaust from a straw) adhering to a curved surface (the wing). However, the upper surface in this flow is a complicated, vortex-laden mixing layer, while on the lower surface the flow is [[wikt:quiescence|quiescent]].

==Basic attributes of lift==

Lift is a result of pressure differences and depends on angle of attack, airfoil shape, air density, and airspeed.

===Pressure differences===

[[Pressure]] is the [[Stress (mechanics)#Normal and shear stresses|normal force]] per unit area exerted by the air on itself and on surfaces that it touches. The lift force is transmitted through the pressure, which acts perpendicular to the surface of the airfoil. Thus, the net force manifests itself as pressure differences. The direction of the net force implies that the average pressure on the upper surface of the airfoil is lower than the average pressure on the underside.&lt;ref&gt;A uniform pressure surrounding a body does not create a net force. (See [[buoyancy]]). Therefore pressure differences are needed to exert a force on a body immersed in a fluid. For example, see: {{Citation|first=G.K.|last=Batchelor|authorlink=George Batchelor|title=An Introduction to Fluid Dynamics|year=1967|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-66396-2|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These pressure differences arise in conjunction with the curved airflow. When a fluid follows a curved path, there is a pressure [[gradient]] perpendicular to the flow direction with higher pressure on the outside of the curve and lower pressure on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;"''...if a streamline is curved, there must be a pressure gradient across the streamline...''"{{citation|journal=Physics Education|first=Holger|last=Babinsky|date=November 2003|url=http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/0031-9120/38/6/001/pe3_6_001.pdf|title=How do wings work?|doi=10.1088/0031-9120/38/6/001|bibcode=2003PhyEd..38..497B|volume=38|page=497}}&lt;/ref&gt; This direct relationship between curved streamlines and pressure differences, sometimes called the [[Euler_equations_(fluid_dynamics)#Streamline_curvature_theorem|streamline curvature theorem]], was derived from Newton's second law by [[Leonhard Euler]] in 1754:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\operatorname{d}p}{\operatorname{d}R}= \rho \frac{v^2}{R} &lt;/math&gt;

The left side of this equation represents the pressure difference perpendicular to the fluid flow. On the right hand side ρ is the density, v is the velocity, and R is the radius of curvature. This formula shows that higher velocities and tighter curvatures create larger pressure differentials and that for straight flow (R → ∞) the pressure difference is zero.&lt;ref&gt;Thus a distribution of the pressure is created which is given in Euler's equation. The physical reason is the aerofoil which forces the streamline to follow its curved surface. The low pressure at the upper side of the aerofoil is a consequence of the curved surface." ''A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force'' Klaus Weltner Am. J. Phys. Vol.55 No.January 1, 1987 p. 53 [http://aapt.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1119/1.14960]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angle of attack===
[[Image:Airfoil angle of attack.jpg|thumb|300px|Angle of attack of an airfoil]]

The [[angle of attack]] is the angle between the [[Chord (aeronautics)|chord line]] of an airfoil and the oncoming airflow. A symmetrical airfoil will generate zero lift at zero angle of attack. But as the angle of attack increases, the air is deflected through a larger angle and the vertical component of the airstream velocity increases, resulting in more lift. For small angles a symmetrical airfoil will generate a lift force roughly proportional to the angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;"You can argue that the main lift comes from the fact that the wing is angled slightly upward so that air striking the underside of the wing is forced downward. The Newton's 3rd law reaction force upward on the wing provides the lift. Increasing the angle of attack can increase the lift, but it also increases drag so that you have to provide more thrust with the aircraft engines" ''Hyperphysics'' Georgia State University Dept. of Physics and Astronomy {{cite web|url=http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/angatt.html|title=Archived copy|accessdate=26 July 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014185450/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/angatt.html|archivedate=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"If we enlarge the angle of attack we enlarge the deflection of the airstream by the airfoil. This results in the enlargement of the vertical component of the velocity of the airstream... we may expect that the lifting force depends linearly on the angle of attack. This dependency is in complete agreement with the results of experiments..." Klaus Weltner ''A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force'' Am. J. Phys. 55(1), January 1987 p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

As the angle of attack increases, the lift reaches a maximum at some angle; increasing the angle of attack beyond this [[Angle of attack#Critical angle of attack|critical angle of attack]] causes the upper-surface flow to separate from the wing; there is less deflection downward so the airfoil generates less lift. The airfoil is said to be [[Stall (flight)|stalled]].&lt;ref&gt;"The decrease[d lift] of angles exceeding 25° is plausible. For large angles of attack we get turbulence and thus less deflection downward." Klaus Weltner ''A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force'' ''Am. J. Phys.'' 55(1), January 1987 p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airfoil shape===
[[Image:Airfoil camber.jpg|thumb|right|300px|An airfoil with camber compared to a symmetrical airfoil]]

The lift force depends on the shape of the airfoil, especially the amount of [[Camber (aerodynamics)|camber]] (curvature such that the upper surface is more convex than the lower surface, as illustrated at right). Increasing the camber generally increases lift.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy (1975), Section 5.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, and von Doenhoff (1958), Section 4.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Cambered airfoils will generate lift at zero angle of attack. When the chord line is horizontal, the trailing edge has a downward direction and since the air follows the trailing edge it is deflected downward.&lt;ref&gt;"With an angle of attack of 0°, we can explain why we already have a lifting force. The air stream behind the aerofoil follows the trailing edge. The trailing edge already has a downward direction, if the chord to the middle line of the profile is horizontal." Klaus Weltner ''A comparison of explanations of the aerodynamic lifting force'' ''Am. J. Phys.'' 55(1), January 1987 p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; When a cambered airfoil is upside down, the angle of attack can be adjusted so that the lift force is upwards. This explains how a plane can fly upside down.&lt;ref&gt;"...the important thing about an aerofoil . . is not so much that its upper surface is humped and its lower surface is nearly flat, but simply that it moves through the air at an angle. This also avoids the otherwise difficult paradox that an aircraft can fly upside down!" N. H. Fletcher ''Mechanics of Flight'' Physics Education July 1975 [http://iopscience.iop.org/0031-9120/10/5/009/pdf/0031-9120_10_5_009.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It requires adjustment of the angle of attack, but as clearly demonstrated in almost every air show, it can be done." ''Hyperphysics'' GSU Dept. of Physics and Astronomy [http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/airfoil.html#c2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708102756/http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/fluids/airfoil.html|date=July 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flow conditions===
The ambient flow conditions which affect lift include the fluid density, viscosity and speed of flow. Density is affected by temperature, and by the medium's acoustic velocity - i.e. by compressibility effects.

===Air speed and density===
Lift is proportional to the density of the air and approximately proportional to the square of the flow speed. Lift also depends on the size of the wing, being generally proportional to the wing's area projected in the lift direction. In calculations it is convenient to quantify lift in terms of a "Lift coefficient" based on these factors.

===Boundary layer and profile drag===
[[File:1915ca abger fluegel (cropped and mirrored).jpg|thumb|300px|Airflow separating from a wing at a high angle of attack]]

No matter how smooth the surface of an airfoil seems, any surface is rough on the scale of air molecules. Air molecules flying into the surface bounce off the rough surface in random directions relative to their original velocities. The result is that when the air is viewed as a continuous material, it is seen to be unable to slide along the surface, and the air's velocity relative to the airfoil decreases to nearly zero at the surface (i.e., the air molecules "stick" to the surface instead of sliding along it), something known as the [[no-slip condition]].&lt;ref&gt;White (1991), Section 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Because the air at the surface has near-zero velocity but the air away from the surface is moving, there is a thin [[boundary layer]] in which air close to the surface is subjected to a [[shear force|shearing]] motion.&lt;ref&gt;White (1991), Section 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anderson 1991, Chapter 17"&gt;Anderson (1991), Chapter 17&lt;/ref&gt; The air's [[viscosity]] resists the shearing, giving rise to a shear stress at the airfoil's surface called [[Skin friction#Skin friction|skin-friction drag]]. Over most of the surface of most airfoils, the boundary layer is naturally turbulent, which increases skin-friction drag.&lt;ref name="Anderson 1991, Chapter 17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Doenhoff 1958"&gt;Abbott and von Doenhoff (1958), Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Under usual flight conditions, the boundary layer remains attached to both the upper and lower surfaces all the way to the trailing edge, and its effect on the rest of the flow is modest. Compared to the predictions of [[inviscid flow]] theory, in which there is no boundary layer, the attached boundary layer reduces the lift by a modest amount and modifies the pressure distribution somewhat, which results in a viscosity-related pressure drag over and above the skin-friction drag. The total of the skin-friction drag and the viscosity-related pressure drag is usually called the [[Profile drag#Form drag|profile drag]].&lt;ref name="Doenhoff 1958"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting (1979), Chapter XXIV&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stalling===
An airfoil's maximum lift at a given airspeed is limited by [[Boundary layer separation|boundary-layer separation]]. As the angle of attack is increased, a point is reached where the boundary layer can no longer remain attached to the upper surface. When the boundary layer separates, it leaves a region of recirculating flow above the upper surface, as illustrated in the flow-visualization photo at right. This is known as the ''stall'', or ''stalling''. At angles of attack above the stall, lift is significantly reduced, though it does not drop to zero. The maximum lift that can be achieved before stall, in terms of the [[lift coefficient]], is generally less than 1.5 for single-element airfoils and can be more than 3.0 for airfoils with high-lift slotted flaps and leading-edge devices deployed.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott and Doenhoff (1958), Chapter 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bluff bodies===
{{further information|Vortex shedding|Vortex-induced vibration}}
The flow around [[:wikt:bluff#Adjective|bluff]] bodies – i.e. without a [[:wikt:streamline|streamlined]] shape, or [[stall (flight)|stall]]ing airfoils – may also generate lift, in addition to a strong drag force. This lift may be steady, or it may [[oscillation|oscillate]] due to [[vortex shedding]]. Interaction of the object's flexibility with the vortex shedding may enhance the effects of fluctuating lift and cause [[vortex-induced vibration]]s.&lt;ref name=Williamson&gt;{{citation|journal=Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics|volume=36|pages=413–455|year=2004|doi=10.1146/annurev.fluid.36.050802.122128|title=Vortex-induced vibrations|first1=C.H.K.|last1=Williamson|first2=R.|last2=Govardhan|bibcode=2004AnRFM..36..413W}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the flow around a circular cylinder generates a [[Kármán vortex street]]: [[vortex|vortices]] being shed in an alternating fashion from the cylinder's sides. The oscillatory nature of the flow produces a fluctuating lift force on the cylinder, even though the net (mean) force is negligible. The lift force [[frequency]] is characterised by the [[dimensionless]] [[Strouhal number]], which depends on the [[Reynolds number]] of the flow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Hydrodynamics around cylindrical structures|first1=B. Mutlu|last1=Sumer|first2=Jørgen|last2=Fredsøe|edition=revised|publisher=World Scientific|year=2006|isbn=981-270-039-0|pages=6–13, 42–45 &amp; 50–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Flow around circular cylinders|first=M.M.|last=Zdravkovich|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2003|isbn=0-19-856561-5|volume=2|pages=850–855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a flexible structure, this oscillatory lift force may induce [[vortex-induced vibration]]s. Under certain conditions – for instance [[resonance]] or strong spanwise [[correlation]] of the lift force – the resulting motion of the structure due to the lift fluctuations may be strongly enhanced. Such vibrations may pose problems and threaten collapse in tall man-made structures like industrial [[chimney]]s.&lt;ref name=Williamson/&gt;

In the [[Magnus effect]], a lift force is generated by a spinning cylinder in a freestream. Here the mechanical rotation acts on the boundary layer, causing it to separate at different locations on the two sides of the cylinder. The asymmetric separation changes the effective shape of the cylinder as far as the flow is concerned such that the cylinder acts like a lifting airfoil with circulation in the outer flow.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L. J., ''Aerodynamics'', Sections 4.5, 4.6&lt;/ref&gt;

==A more comprehensive physical explanation==

As described above under "[[#Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil|Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil]]", there are two main popular explanations: one based on downward deflection of the flow (Newton's laws), and one based on pressure differences accompanied by changes in flow speed (Bernoulli's principle). Either of these, by itself, correctly identifies some aspects of the lifting flow but leaves other important aspects of the phenomenon unexplained. A more comprehensive explanation involves both downward deflection and pressure differences (including changes in flow speed associated with the pressure differences), and requires looking at the flow in more detail.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 7.3.3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lift at the airfoil surface===

The airfoil shape and angle of attack work together so that the airfoil exerts a downward force on the air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) force on the airfoil, which is the lift.&lt;ref name="Langewiesche 1944"/&gt;

The net force exerted by the air occurs as a pressure difference over the airfoil's surfaces.&lt;ref name="Milne-Thomson 1966, Section 1.41"&gt;Milne-Thomson (1966), Section 1.41&lt;/ref&gt; Pressure in a fluid is always positive in an absolute sense,&lt;ref&gt;Jeans (1967), Section 33.&lt;/ref&gt; so that pressure must always be thought of as pushing, and never as pulling. The pressure thus pushes inward on the airfoil everywhere on both the upper and lower surfaces.  The flowing air reacts to the presence of the wing by reducing the pressure on the wing's upper surface and increasing the pressure on the lower surface. The pressure on the lower surface pushes up harder than the reduced pressure on the upper surface pushes down, and the net result is upward lift.&lt;ref name="Milne-Thomson 1966, Section 1.41"/&gt;

The pressure difference which results in Lift acts directly on the airfoil surfaces; however, understanding how the pressure difference is produced requires understanding what the flow does over a wider area.

===The wider flow around the airfoil===
[[File:Karman trefftz.gif|frame|right|Flow around an airfoil: the dots move with the flow. The black dots are on [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|time slices]], which split into two – an upper and lower part – at the leading edge. A marked speed difference between the upper-and lower-surface streamlines is shown most clearly in the image animation, with the upper markers arriving at the trailing edge long before the lower ones. Colors of the dots indicate [[Streamlines, streaklines, and pathlines|streamlines]].]]

[[File:Airfoil isobars.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Pressure distribution with [[Isobar (meteorology)|isobars]] around a lifting airfoil. The plus sign indicates pressure higher than ambient, and the minus sign indicates pressure lower than ambient (NOT negative pressure in the absolute sense). The block arrows indicate the directions of net forces on fluid parcels in different parts of the flowfield.]]

An airfoil affects the speed and direction of the flow over a wide area, producing a pattern called a ''velocity field''. When an airfoil produces lift, the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, the flow above and below the airfoil is deflected downward, and the flow behind the airfoil is deflected upward again, leaving the air far behind the airfoil in the same state as the oncoming flow far ahead. The flow above the upper surface is sped up, while the flow below the airfoil is slowed down. Together with the upward deflection of air in front and the downward deflection of the air immediately behind, this establishes a net circulatory component of the flow. The downward deflection and the changes in flow speed are pronounced and extend over a wide area, as can be seen in the flow animation on the right. These differences in the direction and speed of the flow are greatest close to the airfoil and decrease  gradually far above and below.  All of these features of the velocity field also appear in theoretical models for lifting flows.&lt;ref name="Clancy 1975, Section 4.5"&gt;Clancy (1975), Section 4.5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Thomson (1966.), Section 5.31&lt;/ref&gt;

The pressure is also affected over a wide area, in a pattern of non-uniform pressure called a ''pressure field''. When an airfoil produces lift, there is a diffuse region of low pressure above the airfoil, and usually a diffuse region of high pressure below, as illustrated by the isobars (curves of constant pressure) in the drawing. The pressure difference that acts on the surface is just part of this pressure field.&lt;ref&gt;McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.7&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mutual interaction of pressure differences and changes in flow velocity===

The non-uniform pressure exerts forces on the air in the direction from higher pressure to lower pressure. The direction of the force is different at different locations around the airfoil, as indicated by the block arrows in the ''pressure distribution with isobars'' figure. Air above the airfoil is pushed toward the center of the low-pressure region, and air below the airfoil is pushed outward from the center of the high-pressure region.

According to ''Newton's second law'', a force causes air to accelerate in the direction of the force. Thus the vertical arrows in the ''pressure distribution with isobars'' figure indicate that air above and below the airfoil is accelerated, or turned downward, and that the non-uniform pressure is thus the cause of the downward deflection of the flow visible in the flow animation. To produce this downward turning, the airfoil must have a positive angle of attack or have its rear portion curved downward as on an airfoil with camber. Note that the downward turning of the flow over the upper surface is the result of the air being pushed downward by higher pressure above it than below it. Some explanations that refer to the "Coandă effect" suggest that viscosity plays a key role in the downward turning, but this is false. (see below under "[[#Controversy regarding the Coandă effect|Controversy regarding the Coandă effect]]").

The arrows ahead of the airfoil indicate that the flow ahead of the airfoil is deflected upward, and the arrows behind the airfoil indicate that the flow behind is deflected upward again, after being deflected downward over the airfoil.  These deflections are also visible in the flow animation.

The arrows ahead of the airfoil and behind also indicate that air passing through the low-pressure region above the airfoil is sped up as it enters, and slowed back down as it leaves. Air passing through the high-pressure region below the airfoil sees the opposite - it is slowed down and then sped up. Thus the non-uniform pressure is also the cause of the changes in flow speed visible in the flow animation. The changes in flow speed are consistent with ''Bernoulli's principle'', which states that in a steady flow without viscosity, lower pressure means higher speed, and higher pressure means lower speed.

Thus changes in flow direction and speed are directly caused by the non-uniform pressure. But this cause-and-effect relationship is not just one-way; it works in both directions simultaneously. The air's motion is affected by the pressure differences, but the existence of the pressure differences depends on the air's motion. The relationship is thus a mutual, or reciprocal, interaction: Air flow changes speed or direction in response to pressure differences, and the pressure differences are sustained by the air's resistance to changing speed or direction.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 3.5&lt;/ref&gt; A pressure difference can exist only if something is there for it to push against.  In aerodynamic flow, the pressure difference pushes against the air's inertia, as the air is accelerated by the pressure difference.&lt;ref&gt;McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.9"&lt;/ref&gt; This is why the air's mass is part of the calculation, and why lift depends on air density.

Sustaining the pressure difference that exerts the lift force on the airfoil surfaces requires sustaining a pattern of non-uniform pressure in a wide area around the airfoil. This requires maintaining pressure differences in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and thus requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed according to Bernoulli's principle. The pressure differences and the changes in flow direction and speed sustain each other in a mutual interaction. The pressure differences follow naturally from Newton's second law and from the fact that flow along the surface follows the predominantly downward-sloping contours of the airfoil. And the fact that the air has mass is crucial to the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.9&lt;/ref&gt;

===How simpler explanations fall short===

Producing a lift force requires both downward turning of the flow and changes in flow speed consistent with Bernoulli's principle.  Each of the simplified explanations given above in [[#Simplified_physical_explanations_of_lift_on_an_airfoil|Simplified physical explanations of lift on an airfoil]] falls short by trying to explain lift in terms of only one or the other, thus explaining only part of the phenomenon and leaving other parts unexplained. &lt;ref&gt; McLean 2012, Section 7.3.3.12 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Quantifying lift==

===Pressure integration===

When the pressure distribution on the airfoil surface is known, determining the total lift requires adding up the contributions to the pressure force from local elements of the surface, each with its own local value of pressure. The total lift is thus the [[integral]] of the pressure, in the direction perpendicular to the farfield flow, over the airfoil surface.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (2008), Section 5.7&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L = \oint p\mathbf{n} \cdot\mathbf{k} \; \mathrm{d}S, &lt;/math&gt;

where:
* '''S''' is the projected (planform) area of the airfoil, measured normal to the mean airflow;
* '''n''' is the normal unit vector pointing into the wing;
* '''k''' is the vertical unit vector, normal to the freestream direction.

The above lift equation neglects the [[skin friction]] forces, which are small compared to the pressure forces.

By using the streamwise vector '''i''' parallel to the freestream in place of '''k''' in the integral, we obtain an expression for the [[pressure drag]] ''D&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' (which includes the pressure portion of the profile drag and, if the wing is three-dimensional, the [[lift-induced drag|induced drag]]). If we use the spanwise vector '''j''', we obtain the side force ''Y''.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  D_p &amp;= \oint p\mathbf{n} \cdot\mathbf{i} \; \mathrm{d}S,
  \\[1.2ex]
  Y   &amp;= \oint p\mathbf{n} \cdot\mathbf{j} \; \mathrm{d}S.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The validity of this integration generally requires the airfoil shape to be a closed curve that is piecewise smooth.

===Lift coefficient===
{{Main article|lift coefficient}}

Lift depends on the size of the wing, being approximately proportional to the wing area. It is often convenient to quantify the lift of a given airfoil by its ''lift coefficient'' &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt;, which defines its overall lift in terms of a unit area of the wing.

If the value of &lt;math&gt;C_L&lt;/math&gt; for a wing at a specified angle of attack is given, then the lift produced for specific flow conditions can be determined:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Anderson|first=John D.|year=2004|title=Introduction to Flight|edition=5th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=0-07-282569-3|page=257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical theories of lift==
Mathematical theories of lift are based on continuum fluid mechanics, assuming that air flows as a continuous fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967), Section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thwaites (1958), Section I.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Mises (1959), Section I.1&lt;/ref&gt; Lift is generated in accordance with the fundamental principles of physics, the most relevant being the following three principles:&lt;ref&gt;"Analysis of fluid flow is typically presented to engineering students in terms of three fundamental principles: conservation of mass, conservation of momentum, and conservation of energy." Charles N. Eastlake ''An Aerodynamicist’s View of Lift, Bernoulli, and Newton'' THE PHYSICS TEACHER  Vol. 40, March 2002 {{cite web|url=http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf|title=Archived copy|accessdate=10 September 2009|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411055333/http://www.df.uba.ar/users/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/Bernoulli_Newton_lift.pdf|archivedate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Conservation of momentum]], which is a consequence of [[Newton's laws of motion]], especially Newton's second law which relates the net [[force]] on an element of air to its rate of [[momentum]] change,
* [[Continuity equation#Fluid dynamics|Conservation of mass]], including the assumption that the airfoil's surface is impermeable for the air flowing around, and
* [[Conservation of energy]], which says that energy is neither created nor destroyed.

Because an airfoil affects the flow in a wide area around it, the conservation laws of mechanics are embodied in the form of [[Partial differential equations|partial-differential equations]] combined with a set of [[boundary condition]] requirements which the flow has to satisfy at the airfoil surface and far away from the airfoil.&lt;ref&gt;White (1991), Chapter 1&lt;/ref&gt;

To predict lift requires solving the equations for a particular airfoil shape and flow condition, which generally requires calculations that are so voluminous that they are practical only on a computer, through the methods of [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD). Determining the net aerodynamic force from a CFD solution requires "adding up" ([[integration (mathematics)|integrating]]) the forces due to pressure and shear determined by the CFD over every surface element of the airfoil as described under "[[#Pressure_integration|pressure integration]]".

The [[Navier-Stokes equations]] (NS) provide the potentially most accurate theory of lift, but in practice, capturing the effects of turbulence in the boundary layer on the airfoil surface requires sacrificing some accuracy, and requires use of the [[Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes equations|Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations]] (RANS). Simpler but less accurate theories have also been developed.

===Navier-Stokes (NS) equations===

These equations represent conservation of mass, Newton's second law (conservation of momentum), conservation of energy, the [[Viscosity#Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids|Newtonian law for the action of viscosity]], the [[Fourier heat conduction equation#Fourier.27s law|Fourier heat conduction law]], an [[equation of state]] relating density, temperature, and pressure, and formulas for the viscosity and thermal conductivity of the fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967), Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aris (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, the NS equations, combined with boundary conditions of no through-flow and [[No-slip condition|no slip]] at the airfoil surface, could be used to predict lift in any situation in ordinary atmospheric flight with high accuracy. However, airflows in practical situations always involve turbulence in the boundary layer next to the airfoil surface, at least over the aft portion of the airfoil. Predicting lift by solving the NS equations in their raw form would require the calculations to resolve the details of the turbulence, down to the smallest eddy. This is not yet possible, even on the most powerful current computer.&lt;ref name=Spalart&gt;Spalart (2000) Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  Elsevier Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; So in principle the NS equations provide a complete and very accurate theory of lift, but practical prediction of lift requires that the effects of turbulence be modeled in the RANS equations rather than computed directly.

===Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations===

These are the NS equations with the turbulence motions averaged over time, and the effects of the turbulence on the time-averaged flow represented by [[turbulence modeling]] (an additional set of equations based on a combination of [[dimensional analysis]] and empirical information on how turbulence affects a boundary layer in a time-averaged average sense).&lt;ref&gt;White (1991), Section 6-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schlichting(1979), Chapter XVIII&lt;/ref&gt; A RANS solution consists of the time-averaged velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil.

The amount of computation required is a minuscule fraction (billionths)&lt;ref name=Spalart/&gt; of what would be required to resolve all of the turbulence motions in a raw NS calculation, and with large computers available it is now practical to carry out RANS calculations for complete airplanes in three dimensions. Because turbulence models are not perfect, the accuracy of RANS calculations is imperfect, but it is adequate for practical aircraft design. Lift predicted by RANS is usually within a few percent of the actual lift.

===Inviscid-flow equations (Euler or potential)===

The [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] are the NS equations without the viscosity, heat conduction, and turbulence effects.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; As with a RANS solution, an Euler solution consists of the velocity vector, pressure, density, and temperature defined at a dense grid of points surrounding the airfoil. While the Euler equations are simpler than the NS equations, they do not lend themselves to exact analytic solutions.

Further simplification is available through [[potential flow]] theory, which reduces the number of unknowns to be determined, and makes analytic solutions possible in some cases, as described below.

Either Euler or potential-flow calculations predict the pressure distribution on the airfoil surfaces roughly correctly for angles of attack below stall, where they might miss the total lift by as much as 10-20%. At angles of attack above stall, inviscid calculations do not predict that stall has happened, and as a result they grossly overestimate the lift.

In potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be [[irrotational]], i.e. that small fluid parcels have no net rate of rotation. Mathematically, this is expressed by the statement that the [[Curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the velocity vector field is everywhere equal to zero. Irrotational flows have the convenient property that the velocity can be expressed as the [[gradient]] of a scalar function called a [[potential]]. A flow represented in this way is called [[potential flow]].&lt;ref&gt;"...whenever the velocity field is irrotational, it can be expressed as the gradient of a scalar function we
call a velocity potential φ:  V = ∇φ. The existence of a velocity potential can greatly simplify the analysis of inviscid flows by way of potential-flow theory..."

In potential-flow theory, the flow is assumed to be incompressible. Incompressible potential-flow theory has the advantage that the equation ([[Laplace's equation]]) to be solved for the potential is [[Linear#Physics|linear]], which allows solutions to be constructed by [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of other known solutions. The incompressible-potential-flow equation can also be solved by [[conformal mapping]], a method based on the theory of functions of a complex variable. In the early 20th century, before computers were available, conformal mapping was used to generate solutions to the incompressible potential-flow equation for a class of idealized airfoil shapes, providing some of the first practical theoretical predictions of the pressure distribution on a lifting airfoil.

A solution of the potential equation directly determines only the velocity field. The pressure field is deduced from the velocity field through Bernoulli's equation.

[[Image:Airfoil Kutta condition.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Comparison of a non-lifting flow pattern around an airfoil and a lifting flow pattern consistent with the Kutta condition, in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly]]

Applying potential-flow theory to a lifting flow requires special treatment and an additional assumption. The problem arises because lift on an airfoil in inviscid flow requires [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] in the flow around the airfoil (See "[[#Circulation_and_the_Kutta-Joukowski_theorem|Circulation and the Kutta-Joukowski theorem]]" below), but a single potential function that is continuous throughout the domain around the airfoil cannot represent a flow with nonzero circulation. The solution to this problem is to introduce a [[branch cut]], a curve or line from some point on the airfoil surface out to infinite distance, and to allow a jump in the value of the potential across the cut. The jump in the potential imposes circulation in the flow equal to the potential jump and thus allows nonzero circulation to be represented. However, the potential jump is a free parameter that is not determined by the potential equation or the other boundary conditions, and the solution is thus indeterminate. A potential-flow solution exists for any value of the circulation and any value of the lift. One way to resolve this indeterminacy is to impose the [[Kutta condition]],&lt;ref&gt;Clancy (1975), Section 4.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson(1991), Section 4.5&lt;/ref&gt; which is that, of all the possible solutions, the physically reasonable solution is the one in which the flow leaves the trailing edge smoothly. The streamline sketches illustrate one flow pattern with zero lift, in which the flow goes around the trailing edge and leaves the upper surface ahead of the trailing edge, and another flow pattern with positive lift, in which the flow leaves smoothly at the trailing edge in accordance with the Kutta condition.

===Linearized potential flow===

This is potential-flow theory with the further assumptions that the airfoil is very thin and the angle of attack is small.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy(1975), Sections 8.1-8	&lt;/ref&gt; The linearized theory predicts the general character of the airfoil pressure distribution and how it is influenced by airfoil shape and angle of attack, but is not accurate enough for design work. For a 2D airfoil, such calculations can be done in a fraction of a second in a spreadsheet on a PC.

===Circulation and the Kutta-Joukowski theorem===
[[Image:Circulation-around-aerofoil.svg|thumb|right|300px|Circulation component of the flow around an airfoil]]

When an airfoil generates lift, several components of the overall velocity field contribute to a net circulation of air around it: the upward flow ahead of the airfoil, the accelerated flow above, the decelerated flow below, and the downward flow behind.

The circulation can be understood as the total amount of "spinning" (or [[vorticity]]) of an inviscid fluid around the airfoil.

The [[Kutta–Joukowski theorem]] relates the lift per unit width of span of a two-dimensional airfoil to this [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] component of the flow.&lt;ref name="Clancy 1975, Section 4.5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Mises (1959), Section VIII.2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson(1991), Section 3.15&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it requires the [[Kutta condition]] to be met, in which the rear stagnation point moves to the airfoil trailing edge and attaches there for the duration of flight.

The Kutta-Joukowski theorem is a key element in an explanation of lift that follows the development of the flow around an airfoil as the airfoil starts its motion from rest and a [[starting vortex]] is formed and left behind, leading to the formation of circulation around the airfoil.&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl and Tietjens (1934)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967), Section 6.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentry (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Lift is then inferred from the Kutta-Joukowski theorem. This explanation is largely mathematical, and its general progression is based on logical inference, not physical cause-and-effect.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 7.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kutta-Joukowski model does not predict how much circulation or lift a two-dimensional airfoil will produce. Calculating the lift per unit span using Kutta-Joukowski requires a known value for the circulation.

The lift generated by a conventional airfoil is dictated by both its design and the flight conditions, such as forward velocity, angle of attack and air density. Lift can be increased by artificially increasing the circulation, for example by boundary-layer blowing or the use of [[blown flap]]s. In the [[Flettner rotor]] the entire airfoil is circular and spins about a spanwise axis to create the circulation.

==Three-dimensional flow==
[[Image:Wing isobars.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of an airplane wing-body combination showing the isobars of the three-dimensional lifting flow]]
 
[[Image:Wing velocity vectors.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cross-section of an airplane wing-body combination showing velocity vectors of the three-dimensional lifting flow]]

The flow around a three-dimensional wing involves significant additional issues, especially relating to the wing tips. For a wing of low aspect ratio, such as a typical [[delta wing]], two-dimensional theories may provide a poor model and three-dimensional flow effects can dominate.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Thomson (1966), Section 12.3&lt;/ref&gt; Even for wings of high aspect ratio, the three-dimensional effects associated with finite span can affect the whole span, not just close to the tips.

===Wing tips and spanwise distribution===

The vertical pressure gradient at the wing tips causes air to flow sideways, out from under the wing then up and back over the upper surface. This reduces the pressure gradient at the wing tip, therefore also reducing lift. The lift tends to decrease in the spanwise direction from root to tip, and the pressure distributions around the airfoil sections change accordingly in the spanwise direction. Pressure distributions in planes perpendicular to the flight direction tend to look like the illustration at right.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 8.1.3&lt;/ref&gt; This spanwise-varying pressure distribution is sustained by a mutual interaction with the velocity field. Flow below the wing is accelerated outboard, flow outboard of the tips is accelerated upward, and flow above the wing is accelerated inboard, which results in the flow pattern illustrated at right.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 8.1.1&lt;/ref&gt;

There is more downward turning of the flow than there would be in a two-dimensional flow with the same airfoil shape and sectional lift, and a higher sectional angle of attack is required to achieve the same lift compared to a two-dimensional flow.&lt;ref&gt;Hurt, H. H. (1965) ''Aerodynamics for Naval Aviators'', Figure 1.30, NAVWEPS 00-80T-80&lt;/ref&gt; The wing is effectively flying in a downdraft of its own making, as if the freestream flow were tilted downward, with the result that the total aerodynamic force vector is tilted backward slightly compared to what it would be in two dimensions. The additional backward component of the force vector is called [[lift-induced drag]].

[[Image:Tip vortex rollup.png|thumb|300px|Euler computation of a tip vortex rolling up from the trailed vorticity sheet]]

The difference in the spanwise component of velocity above and below the wing (between being in the inboard direction above and in the outboard direction below) persists at the trailing edge and into the wake downstream. After the flow leaves the trailing edge, this difference in velocity takes place across a relatively thin shear layer called a vortex sheet.

===Horseshoe vortex system===
[[Image:Wing horseshoe vortex.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Planview of a wing showing the horseshoe vortex system]]
The wingtip flow leaving the wing creates a tip vortex. As the main vortex sheet passes downstream from the trailing edge, it rolls up at its outer edges, merging with the tip vortices. The combination of the [[wingtip vortices]] and the vortex sheets feeding them is called the vortex wake.

In addition to the vorticity in the trailing vortex wake there is vorticity in the wing's boundary layer, called 'bound vorticity', which connects the trailing sheets from the two sides of the wing into a vortex system in the general form of a horseshoe. The horseshoe form of the vortex system was recognized by the British aeronautical pioneer Lanchester in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;Lanchester (1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

Given the distribution of bound vorticity and the vorticity in the wake, the [[Biot-Savart law]] (a vector-calculus relation) can be used to calculate the velocity perturbation anywhere in the field, caused by the lift on the wing. Approximate theories for the lift distribution and lift-induced drag of three-dimensional wings are based on such analysis applied to the wing's horseshoe vortex system.&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Thomson (1966), Section 10.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy (1975), Section 8.9&lt;/ref&gt; In these theories, the bound vorticity is usually idealized and assumed to reside at the camber surface inside the wing.

Because the velocity is deduced from the vorticity in such theories, some authors describe the situation to imply that the vorticity is the cause of the velocity perturbations, using terms such as "the velocity induced by the vortex," for example.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson (1991), Section 5.2&lt;/ref&gt; But attributing mechanical cause-and-effect between  the vorticity and the velocity in this way is not consistent with the physics.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor (1967), Section 2.4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milne-Thomson (1966), Section 9.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Durand (1932), Section III.2&lt;/ref&gt; The velocity perturbations in the flow around a wing are in fact produced by the pressure field.&lt;ref&gt;McLean (2012), Section 8.1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manifestations of lift in the farfield==

===Integrated force/momentum balance in lifting flows===
[[File:Airfoil control volumes.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Control volumes of different shapes that have been used in analyzing the momentum balance in the 2D flow around a lifting airfoil. The airfoil is assumed to exert a downward force -L' per unit span on the air, and the proportions in which that force is manifested as momentum fluxes and pressure differences at the outer boundary are indicated for each different shape of control volume.]]

The flow around a lifting airfoil must satisfy Newton's second law regarding conservation of momentum, both locally at every point in the flow field, and in an integrated sense over any extended region of the flow. For an extended region, Newton's second law takes the form of the ''momentum theorem for a control volume'', where a [[control volume]] can be any region of the flow chosen for analysis. The momentum theorem states that the integrated force exerted at the boundaries of the control volume (a surface integral), is equal to the integrated time rate of change ([[material derivative]]) of the momentum of fluid parcels passing through the interior of the control volume. For a steady flow, this can be expressed in the form of the net surface integral of the flux of momentum through the boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro (1953), Section 1.5, equation 1.15&lt;/ref&gt;

The lifting flow around a 2D airfoil is usually analyzed in a control volume that completely surrounds the airfoil, so that the inner boundary of the control volume is the airfoil surface, where the downward force per unit span &lt;math&gt;-L'&lt;/math&gt; is exerted on the fluid by the airfoil. The outer boundary is usually either a large circle or a large rectangle. At this outer boundary distant from the airfoil, the velocity and pressure are well represented by the velocity and pressure associated with a uniform flow plus a vortex, and viscous stress is negligible, so that the only force that must be integrated over the outer boundary is the pressure.&lt;ref name="Lissaman 1996"&gt;Lissaman (1996), "Lift in thin slices: the two dimensional case"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand 1932"&gt;Durand (1932), Sections B.V.6, B.V.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 407"&gt;Batchelor (1967), Section 6.4, p. 407&lt;/ref&gt; The free-stream velocity is usually assumed to be horizontal, with lift vertically upward, so that the vertical momentum is the component of interest.

For the free-air case (no ground plane), the force &lt;math&gt;-L'&lt;/math&gt; exerted by the airfoil on the fluid is manifested partly as momentum fluxes and partly as pressure differences at the outer boundary, in proportions that depend on the shape of the outer boundary, as shown in the diagram at right. For a flat horizontal rectangle that is much longer than it is tall, the fluxes of vertical momentum through the front and back are negligible, and the lift is accounted for entirely by the integrated pressure differences on the top and bottom.&lt;ref name="Lissaman 1996"/&gt; For a square or circle, the momentum fluxes and pressure differences account for half the lift each.&lt;ref name="Lissaman 1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Durand 1932"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 407"/&gt; For a vertical rectangle that is much taller than it is wide, the unbalanced pressure forces on the top and bottom are negligible, and lift is accounted for entirely by momentum fluxes, with a flux of upward momentum that enters the control volume through the front accounting for half the lift, and a flux of downward momentum that exits the control volume through the back accounting for the other half.&lt;ref name="Lissaman 1996"/&gt;

The results of all of the control-volume analyses described above are consistent with the Kutta-Joukowski theorem described above. Both the tall rectangle and circle control volumes have been used in derivations of the theorem.&lt;ref name="Durand 1932"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Batchelor 1967 p. 407"/&gt;

===Lift reacted by overpressure on the ground under an airplane===
[[File:Pressure footprint isometric b.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Illustration of the distribution of higher-than-ambient pressure on the ground under an airplane in flight]]

An airfoil produces a pressure field in the surrounding air, as explained under "[[#The wider flow around the airfoil|The wider flow around the airfoil]]" above. The pressure differences associated with this field die off gradually, becoming very small at large distances, but never disappearing altogether. Below the airplane, the pressure field persists as a positive pressure disturbance that reaches the ground, forming a pattern of slightly-higher-than-ambient pressure on the ground, as shown on the right.&lt;ref&gt;Prandtl and Tietjens (1934), Figure 150&lt;/ref&gt; Although the pressure differences are very small far below the airplane, they are spread over a wide area and add up to a substantial force. For steady, level flight, the integrated force due to the pressure differences is equal to the total aerodynamic lift of the airplane and to the airplane's weight. According to Newton's third law, this pressure force exerted on the ground by the air is matched by an equal-and-opposite upward force exerted on the air by the ground, which offsets all of the downward force exerted on the air by the airplane. The net force due to the lift, acting on the atmosphere as a whole, is therefore zero, and thus there is no integrated accumulation of vertical momentum in the atmosphere, as was noted by Lanchester early in the development of modern aerodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;Lanchester (1907), Sections 5 and 112&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Pi box}}

The following is a list of significant formulae involving the [[mathematical constant]] [[pi|{{pi}}]]. The list contains only formulae whose significance is established either in the article on the formula itself, the article [[Pi]], or the article [[Approximations of π|Approximations of {{pi}}]].

==Euclidean geometry==
:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac Cd &lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''C''}} is the [[circumference]] of a [[circle]], {{math|''d''}} is the [[diameter]].

:&lt;math&gt;A = \pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|A}} is the [[area of a circle]] and {{math|''r''}} is the [[radius]].

:&lt;math&gt;V = {4 \over 3}\pi r^3&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''V''}} is the volume of a [[sphere]] and {{math|''r''}} is the radius.

:&lt;math&gt;SA = 4\pi r^2&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''SA''}} is the surface area of a sphere and {{math|''r''}} is the radius.

==Physics==
*The [[cosmological constant]]:
::&lt;math&gt;\Lambda = {{8\pi G} \over {3c^2}} \rho&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Uncertainty principle|Heisenberg's uncertainty principle]]:
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta x\, \Delta p \ge \frac h {4\pi} &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Einstein's field equation]] of [[general relativity]]:
::&lt;math&gt; R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

*[[Coulomb's law]] for the [[electric force]]:
:: &lt;math&gt; F = \frac{|q_1q_2|}{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

*[[Permeability (electromagnetism)|Magnetic permeability of free space]]:
::&lt;math&gt; \mu_0 = 4 \pi \cdot 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{N/A^2}&lt;/math&gt;

*Period of a simple [[pendulum]] with small amplitude:
::&lt;math&gt;T \approx 2\pi \sqrt\frac L g &lt;/math&gt;

*The [[buckling]] formula:
::&lt;math&gt;F =\frac{\pi^2EI}{L^2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Formulae yielding {{pi}}==
===Integrals===
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \operatorname{sech}(x) \, dx = \pi &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_t^\infty e^{-1/2t^2-x^2+xt} \, dx \, dt = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \int_t^\infty e^{-t^2-1/2x^2+xt} \, dx \, dt = \pi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1 \sqrt{1-x^2}\,dx = \frac \pi 2 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{-1}^1\frac{dx}{\sqrt{1-x^2}} = \pi&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty\frac{dx}{1+x^2} = \pi&lt;/math&gt; (integral form of [[arctan]] over its entire domain, giving the period of [[Trigonometric functions#tangent|tan]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty e^{-x^2}\,dx = \sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Gaussian integral]]).

: &lt;math&gt;\oint\frac{dz} z = 2\pi i&lt;/math&gt; (when the path of integration winds once counterclockwise around 0. See also [[Cauchy's integral formula]]).

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^\infty \frac{\sin x} x \,dx=\pi &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 {x^4(1-x)^4 \over 1+x^2}\,dx = {22 \over 7} - \pi&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Proof that 22/7 exceeds π]]).

===Efficient infinite series===
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{k!}{(2k+1)!!} = \sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{2^k k!^2}{(2k+1)!} = \frac \pi 2 &lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Double factorial]])

:&lt;math&gt;12 \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(-1)^k (6k)! (13591409 + 545140134k)}{(3k)!(k!)^3 640320^{3k + 3/2}}=\frac 1 \pi &lt;/math&gt; (see [[Chudnovsky algorithm]])

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{9801} \sum^\infty_{k=0} \frac{(4k)!(1103+26390k)}{(k!)^4 396^{4k}}=\frac 1 \pi &lt;/math&gt; (see [[Srinivasa Ramanujan#Mathematical achievements|Srinivasa Ramanujan]], [[Ramanujan–Sato series]])

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt{3}}{6^5} \sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{((4k)!)^2(6k)!}{9^{k+1}(12k)!(2k)!} \left( \frac{127169}{12k + 1} - \frac{1070}{12k + 5} - \frac{131}{12k + 7} + \frac{2}{12k + 11}\right)=\pi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cetin Hakimoglu-Brown [http://iamned.com/math/infiniteseries.pdf Derivation of Rapidly Converging Infinite Series]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are efficient for calculating arbitrary binary digits of {{pi}}:
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k = 0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{16^k} \left( \frac{4}{8k + 1} - \frac{2}{8k + 4} - \frac{1}{8k + 5} - \frac{1}{8k + 6}\right)=\pi&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula]])

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2^6} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{{(-1)}^n}{2^{10n}} \left( - \frac{2^5}{4n+1} - \frac{1}{4n+3} + \frac{2^8}{10n+1} - \frac{2^6}{10n+3} - \frac{2^2}{10n+5} - \frac{2^2}{10n+7} + \frac{1}{10n+9} \right)=\pi&lt;/math&gt;

===Other infinite series===
:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2) = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (see also [[Basel problem]] and [[Riemann zeta function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(4)= \frac{1}{1^4} + \frac{1}{2^4} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \frac{1}{4^4} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^4}{90}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2n) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k^{2n}}\, = \frac{1}{1^{2n}} + \frac{1}{2^{2n}} + \frac{1}{3^{2n}} + \frac{1}{4^{2n}} + \cdots = (-1)^{n+1}\frac{B_{2n}(2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt; , where ''B''&lt;sub&gt;2''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[Bernoulli number]].

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{3^n - 1}{4^n}\, \zeta(n+1) = \pi&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PiFormulas.html Weisstein, Eric W. "Pi Formulas", MathWorld]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^1 = \frac{1}{1} - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{9} - \cdots = \arctan{1} = \frac{\pi}{4}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (see [[Leibniz formula for pi]])

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{(-1)^{n+1}}{n^2}=\frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} - \frac{1}{4^2} + \cdots=\frac{\pi^2}{12}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac1{(2n)^2} = \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{4^2} + \frac{1}{6^2} + \frac{1}{8^2} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{24}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^2 = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \frac{1}{5^2} + \frac{1}{7^2} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^2}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^3 = \frac{1}{1^3} - \frac{1}{3^3} + \frac{1}{5^3} - \frac{1}{7^3} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^3}{32}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^4 = \frac{1}{1^4} + \frac{1}{3^4} + \frac{1}{5^4} + \frac{1}{7^4} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^4}{96}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^5 = \frac{1}{1^5} - \frac{1}{3^5} + \frac{1}{5^5} - \frac{1}{7^5} + \cdots = \frac{5\pi^5}{1536}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {\left( \frac{(-1)^{n}}{2n+1} \right) }^6 = \frac{1}{1^6} + \frac{1}{3^6} + \frac{1}{5^6} + \frac{1}{7^6} + \cdots = \frac{\pi^6}{960}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(4n+1)(4n+3)} = \frac{1}{1\cdot 3}+\frac{1}{5\cdot 7} +\frac{1}{9\cdot 11} +\cdots=\frac{\pi}{8}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = {{1}} + \frac{{1}}{{2}} + \frac{{1}}{{3}} + \frac{{1}}{{4}} - \frac{{1}}{{5}} + \frac{{1}}{{6}} + \frac{{1}}{{7}} + \frac{{1}}{{8}} + \frac{{1}}{{9}} - \frac{{1}}{{10}} + \frac{{1}}{{11}} + \frac{{1}}{{12}} - \frac{{1}}{{13}} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; (Euler, 1748)

:After the first two terms, the signs are determined as follows: If the denominator is a prime of the form 4''m'' - 1, the sign is positive; if the denominator is a prime of the form 4''m'' + 1, the sign is negative; for composite numbers, the sign is equal the product of the signs of its factors.&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl B. Boyer]], ''A History of Mathematics'', Chapter 21., p. 488-489&lt;/ref&gt;

:Also:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{F_{2n}}{n^2 \binom{2n}{n}}=\frac{4\pi^2}{25\sqrt5}&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is the n-th [[Fibonacci number]].

:Some formulas relating π and harmonic numbers are given [[Harmonic number#Identities involving π|here]].

===Machin-like formulae===
{{See also|Machin-like formula}}
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan 1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 2 \arctan\frac{1}{2} - \arctan\frac{1}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 2 \arctan\frac{1}{3} + \arctan\frac{1}{7}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 4 \arctan\frac{1}{5} - \arctan\frac{1}{239} &lt;/math&gt; (the original [[John Machin|Machin's]] formula)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 5 \arctan\frac{1}{7} + 2 \arctan\frac{3}{79}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 6 \arctan\frac{1}{8} + 2 \arctan\frac{1}{57} + \arctan\frac{1}{239}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 12 \arctan\frac{1}{49} + 32 \arctan\frac{1}{57} - 5 \arctan\frac{1}{239} + 12 \arctan\frac{1}{110443}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{4} = 44 \arctan\frac{1}{57} + 7 \arctan\frac{1}{239} - 12 \arctan\frac{1}{682} + 24 \arctan\frac{1}{12943}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\pi}{2} = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \arctan\frac{1}{F_{2n+1}} = \arctan\frac{1}{1} + \arctan\frac{1}{2} + \arctan\frac{1}{5} + \arctan\frac{1}{13} + \cdots &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;F_n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''n''-th [[Fibonacci number]].

where &lt;math&gt;(x)_n &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Pochhammer symbol]] for the rising factorial. See also [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].

===Infinite products===
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\pi}{4} = \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{4} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdot \frac{11}{12} \cdot \frac{13}{12} \cdot \frac{17}{16} \cdot \frac{19}{20} \cdot \frac{23}{24} \cdot \frac{29}{28} \cdot \frac{31}{32}  \cdots &lt;/math&gt; ([[Leonhard Euler|Euler]])
:where the numerators are the odd primes; each denominator is the multiple of four nearest to the numerator.

:&lt;math&gt; \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4n^2}{4n^2-1} = \frac{2}{1} \cdot \frac{2}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{4}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{5} \cdot \frac{6}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{7} \cdot \frac{8}{9} \cdots = \frac{4}{3} \cdot \frac{16}{15} \cdot \frac{36}{35} \cdot \frac{64}{63} \cdots = \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Wallis product]])

[[Viète's formula]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sqrt2}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}2 \cdot \frac{\sqrt{2+\sqrt{2+\sqrt2}}}2 \cdot \cdots = \frac2\pi&lt;/math&gt;

===Continued fractions===
:&lt;math&gt;
\pi= {3 + \cfrac{1^2}{6 + \cfrac{3^2}{6 + \cfrac{5^2}{6 + \cfrac{7^2}{6 + \ddots\,}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi = \cfrac{4}{1 + \cfrac{1^2}{3 + \cfrac{2^2}{5 + \cfrac{3^2}{7 + \cfrac{4^2}{9 + \ddots}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\pi = \cfrac{4}{1 + \cfrac{1^2}{2 + \cfrac{3^2}{2 + \cfrac{5^2}{2 + \cfrac{7^2}{2 + \ddots}}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
2\pi = {6 + \cfrac{2^2}{12 + \cfrac{6^2}{12 + \cfrac{10^2}{12+ \cfrac{14^2}{12 + \cfrac{18^2}{12 + \ddots}}}}}}
&lt;/math&gt;
For more on the third identity, see [[Euler's continued fraction formula]].

(See also [[Continued fraction]] and [[Generalized continued fraction]].)

===Miscellaneous===
:&lt;math&gt;n! \sim \sqrt{2 \pi n} \left(\frac{n}{e}\right)^n&lt;/math&gt; ([[Stirling's approximation]])

:&lt;math&gt;e^{i \pi} +1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; ([[Euler's identity]])

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} \varphi (k) \sim \frac{3n^2}{\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Euler's totient function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac {\varphi (k)} {k} \sim \frac{6n}{\pi^2}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[Euler's totient function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma\left({1 \over 2}\right)=\sqrt{\pi}&lt;/math&gt; (see also [[Gamma function]])

:&lt;math&gt;\pi = \frac{\Gamma\left({1/4}\right)^{4/3} \operatorname{agm}(1, \sqrt{2})^{2/3}}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (where agm is the [[arithmetic–geometric mean]])

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{1}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n (n\;\bmod\;k) = 1-\frac{\pi^2}{12}&lt;/math&gt; (where mod is the modulo function which gives the rest of a division this formula is getting better for higher n)

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{4}{n^2} \sum_{k=1}^n \sqrt{n^2 - k^2} &lt;/math&gt; ([[Riemann sum]] to evaluate the area of the unit circle)

:&lt;math&gt; \pi = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{2^{4n}}{n {2n\choose n}^2} &lt;/math&gt; (by [[Stirling's approximation]])

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2608">The following is a '''list of information systems journals''', containing [[academic journal]]s that cover [[information systems]]. The list given here contains the most influential, currently publishing journals in the field.

To understand which are the best journals for a particular Information Systems (IS) field of study, one needs to understand that IS is a multidisciplinary research area and that the "IS discipline draws on the social science as well as the engineering research traditions.  The social science tradition is represented by the economics-based and behavioral research, whereas the engineering tradition is epitomized by the design science approach in IS research." &lt;ref&gt;Sidorova, Anna, Nicholas Evangelopoulos, Russell Torres, and Vess Johnson. A survey of core research in information systems. Springer New York, 2013, pg. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of lakes in Michigan'''. The [[United States|American]] state of [[Michigan]] borders four of the [[Great Lake]]s.
The number of inland lakes in Michigan depends on the minimum size: there are 62,798 lakes ≥ 0.1 acres, 26,266 lakes ≥ 1.0 acres, 6,537 lakes ≥ 10.0 acres, 1,148 lakes ≥ 100 acres, 98 lakes ≥ 1,000 acres, and 10 lakes ≥ 10,000 acres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michigandnr.com/PUBLICATIONS/PDFS/ifr/ifrlibra/technical/reports/2004-2tr.pdf |title=Compilation of Databases on Michigan Lakes |accessdate=2009-04-18 |format=PDF |publisher=MichiganDNR.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many lakes share names, some of the most common are [[Clear Lake (Michigan)|Clear Lake]], [[Long Lake (Michigan)|Long Lake]], [[Mud Lake (Michigan)|Mud Lake]], [[Round Lake (Michigan)|Round Lake]] and [[Silver Lake (Michigan)|Silver Lake]].

'''Madagascar''' is a software package for multidimensional data analysis and [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] computational experiments. Its mission is to provide
* a convenient and powerful environment
* a convenient technology transfer tool
for researchers working with digital image and data processing in geophysics and related fields. Technology developed using the Madagascar project management system is transferred in the form of recorded processing histories, which become "computational recipes" to be verified, exchanged, and modified by users of the system.

== Features ==
The Madagascar environment consists of:
# Standalone programs for out-of-core data analysis;
# Standalone programs for geophysical data processing and imaging;
# A development kit for C, C++, Java, Fortran-77, Fortran-90, Python, Matlab, and Octave;
# A framework for reproducible numerical experiments, based on [[SCons]];
# A framework for scientific publications, based on [[SCons]] and [[LaTeX]];
# A collection of reproducible scientific articles also used as usage examples and regression tests for the standalone programs;
# A collection of datasets used as input to reproducible numerical experiments.

== Example script ==
An example &lt;tt&gt;SConstruct&lt;/tt&gt; file is shown below&lt;ref&gt;&lt;tt&gt;bei/sg/denmark&lt;/tt&gt; example https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/book/bei/sg/denmark/SConstruct&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang='python'&gt;
from rsf.proj import *

Fetch('wz.35.H','wz')

Flow('wind','wz.35.H','dd form=native | window n1=400 j1=2 | smooth rect1=3')
Plot('wind','pow pow1=2 | grey')

Flow('mute','wind','mutter v0=0.31 half=n')
Plot('mute','pow pow1=2 | grey')

Result('denmark','wind mute','SideBySideAniso')

End()
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that &lt;tt&gt;SConstruct&lt;/tt&gt; by itself does not do any job other than setting rules for building different targets. The targets get built when one executes &lt;tt&gt;scons&lt;/tt&gt; on the command line.&lt;ref&gt;S. Fomel and G. Hennenfent, 2007, Reproducible computational experiments using SCons: 32nd International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP), IV/1257-1260.&lt;/ref&gt; Running &lt;tt&gt;scons&lt;/tt&gt; produces
&lt;pre&gt;
bash$ scons
scons: Reading SConscript files ...

scons: Building targets ...

== License ==

'''Madagascar''' is [[free software]] and is licensed under the [[GPL]].

== History ==

Madagascar was first publicly presented at the EAGE Workshop in Vienna in June 2006. The work on the package (previously named RSF) was started by Sergey Fomel in 2003. Since then, many people have contributed to it.&lt;ref&gt;AUTHORS.txt file https://github.com/ahay/src/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

While being written mostly from scratch, Madagascar borrows ideas from the design of SEPlib, an open-source package maintained by Bob Clapp at the [[Stanford Exploration Project]] (SEP). Generations of SEP students and researchers contributed to SEPlib. Most important contributions came from Rob Clayton, [[Jon Claerbout]], Dave Hale, Stew Levin, Rick Ottolini, Joe Dellinger, Steve Cole, Dave Nichols, Martin Karrenbach, Biondo Biondi, and Bob Clapp.

Madagascar also borrows ideas from [[Seismic Unix]] (SU), a package maintained by John Stockwell at the Center for Wave Phenomenon (CWP) at the Colorado School of Mines (Stockwell, 1997;&lt;ref&gt;Stockwell, J. W.,  1997, Free software in education: A case study of CWP/SU: Seismic Unix: The Leading Edge, '''16''', 1045--1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockwell, 1999&lt;ref&gt;--------, 1999, The CWP/SU: Seismic Un*x package: Computers and  Geosciences, '''25''', 415--419.&lt;/ref&gt;). Main contributors to SU included Einar Kjartansson, Shuki Ronen, Jack Cohen, Chris Liner, Dave Hale, and John Stockwell. SU adopted an open-source BSD-style license starting with release 40 (April 10, 2007).

== Madagascar Schools ==

A '''malunion''' is when a [[Bone fracture|fractured bone]] doesn’t heal properly.  Some ways that it shows is by having the bone being twisted, shorter, or bent. Malunions can occur by having the bones improperly aligned when immobilized, having the [[orthopedic cast|cast]] taken off too early, or never seeking medical treatment after the break.&lt;ref name="test 6"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malunion|url=https://www.floridahospital.com/malunion|website=floridahospital.com|publisher=florida hospital|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malunions are painful and commonly produce [[swelling (medical)|swelling]] around the area, possible immobilization, and [[:wikt:deterioration|deterioration]] of the [[bone]] and [[tissue (biology)|tissue]].&lt;ref name="test 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foot and Ankle Malunion|url=http://my.clevelandclinic.org/services/orthopaedics-rheumatology/diseases-conditions/foot-ankle-fractures-malunion|website=clevelandclinic.org|accessdate=20 March 2015|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
Malunions are presented by excessive swelling, twisting, bending, and possibly shortening of the bone.&lt;ref name="test 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malunion Fracture|url=http://www.uofmhealth.org/medical-services/cmc/fracture/malunion|website=uofmhealth.org|accessdate=20 March 2015|ref=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients may have trouble placing weight on or near the malunion.&lt;ref name="test 5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malunion|url=http://www.llila.com/malunions-correction.php|website=llila.com|accessdate=20 March 2015|ref=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most commonly the presentation of a bend in the bone exhibits the diagnosis of a malunion.

==Diagnosis==
An [[X-ray]] is essential for the proper diagnosis of a malunion. The doctor will look into the patient’s history and the treatment process for the bone fracture. Oftentimes a [[CT scan]] and probably a [[MRI]] are also used in diagnosis. [[MRI]] are used to check of cartilage and ligament issues that developed due to the malunion and misalignment. [[CT scans]] are used to locate normal or abnormal structures within the body and to help during procedures to guide the placement of instruments and/or treatments.&lt;ref name="test 3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CT Scan (Computerized Tomography, CAT Scan)|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/cat_scan/article.htm|website=http://www.medicinenet.com/|publisher=MedicineNet.com|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="test 7"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malunion and Nonunion of Fracture|url=http://www.mdguidelines.com/malunion-and-nonunion-of-fracture|website=mdguidelines.com|publisher=mdguidelines|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
Once diagnosed and located, surgery is the most common treatment for a malunion. The surgery consists of the surgeon re-breaking the bone and realigning it to the anatomically correct position. There are different types and levels of severity for malunions which helps determine the treatment. Most often, either screws, plates or pins are used secure the new alignment. In some cases, the bone may be trimmed to allow full orientation at the fractured spot. It is also possible that a [[bone graft]] could be used to help with healing.

During follow ups an [[X-ray]] or a [[CT scan]] may be used to verify that the fracture is healing properly and is now in the anatomically correct position.

'''Microturbulence''' is a form of [[turbulence]] that varies over small distance scales. (Large-scale turbulence is called macroturbulence.)

==Stellar==

Microturbulence is one of several mechanisms that can cause [[Spectral line|broadening]] of the [[absorption line]]s in the stellar spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

with the effective temperature and the surface gravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The microturbulent velocity is defined as the microscale
non-thermal component of the gas velocity in the region of spectral
line formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
 | last=Cantiello | first=M. et al. (2008)
 | title= On the origin of Microturbulence in hot stars
 | url=http://www.astro.uu.nl/~cantiell/articles/liege1.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Convection is the mechanism believed to be responsible for the observed turbulent velocity field, both in low mass stars and massive stars.
When examined by a [[spectroscope]], the velocity of the convective gas along the line of sight produces [[Doppler shift]]s in the absorption bands. It is the distribution of these velocities along the line of sight that produces the microturbulence broadening of the absorption lines in low mass stars that have convective envelopes. In massive stars convection can be present only in small regions below the surface; these sub-surface convection zones can excite turbulence at the stellar surface through the emission of acoustic and gravity waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In [[microbiology]], [[genetics]], [[cell biology]], and [[molecular biology]], '''competence''' is the ability of a [[cell (biology)|cell]] to alter its genetics by taking up extracellular ("naked") [[DNA]] from its environment in the process called [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]]. Competence may be differentiated between ''natural competence'', a genetically specified ability of [[bacteria]] which is thought to occur under natural conditions as well as in the laboratory, and ''induced'' or ''artificial competence'', which arises when cells in laboratory cultures are treated to make them transiently permeable to DNA.  Competence allows for rapid adaptation and DNA repair of the cell. This article primarily deals with natural competence in bacteria, although information about artificial competence is also provided.

==History==
Natural competence was discovered by [[Frederick Griffith]] in 1928, when he showed that a preparation of killed cells of a pathogenic bacterium contained something that could transform related non-pathogenic cells into the pathogenic type.  In 1944 [[Oswald Avery]], [[Colin Munro MacLeod|Colin MacLeod]], and [[Maclyn McCarty]] demonstrated that this 'transforming factor' was pure [[DNA]]&lt;ref name="pmid19871359"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Avery OT, Macleod CM, McCarty M |title=STUDIES ON THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE SUBSTANCE INDUCING TRANSFORMATION OF PNEUMOCOCCAL TYPES : INDUCTION OF TRANSFORMATION BY A DESOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID FRACTION ISOLATED FROM PNEUMOCOCCUS TYPE III |journal=J. Exp. Med. |volume=79 |issue=2 |pages=137–58 |year=1944 |pmid=19871359 |pmc=2135445 |doi= 10.1084/jem.79.2.137|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
.  This was the first compelling evidence that DNA carries the genetic information of the cell.

Since then, natural competence has been studied in a number of different bacteria, particularly ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' (Griffith's "pneumococcus"), ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.  Areas of active research include the mechanisms of DNA transport, the regulation of competence in different bacteria, and the evolutionary function of competence.

==Mechanisms of DNA uptake==
In the natural world DNA usually becomes available by death and [[lysis]] of other cells, but in the laboratory it is provided by the researcher, often as a genetically engineered fragment or [[plasmid]].  During uptake, DNA is transported across the [[cell membrane|cell membrane(s)]], and the [[cell wall]] if one is present.  Once the DNA is inside the cell it may be degraded to [[nucleotides]], which are reused for [[DNA synthesis|DNA replication]] and other [[metabolism|metabolic]] functions.  Alternatively it may be [[genetic recombination|recombined]] into the cell’s [[genome]] by its [[DNA repair]] enzymes.  If this recombination changes the cell’s [[genotype]] the cell is said to have been transformed. Artificial competence and transformation are used as research tools in many organisms (''see [[Transformation (genetics)]]'').&lt;ref name="dubnau"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chen I, Dubnau D |title=DNA uptake during bacterial transformation |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=241–9 |year=2004 |pmid=15083159 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In almost all naturally competent bacteria components of extracellular filaments called type 4 pili (a type of [[pilus|fimbria]]) bind extracellular double stranded DNA. The DNA is then translocated across the membrane (or membranes for [[gram negative]] bacteria) through multi-component protein complexes driven by the degradation of one strand of the DNA. Single stranded DNA in the cell is bound by a well-conserved protein, DprA, which loads the DNA onto RecA, which mediates homologous recombination through the classic [[DNA repair]] pathway.&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnston C, Martin B, Fichant G, Polard P, Claverys J |title=Bacterial transformation: distribution, shared mechanisms and divergent control |journal=Nat. Rev. Microbiol. |volume=12  |pages=181–96 |year=2014 |doi=10.1038/nrmicro3199 |pmid=24509783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation of competence==
In laboratory cultures, natural competence is usually tightly regulated and often triggered by nutritional shortages or adverse conditions.  However the specific inducing signals and regulatory machinery are much more variable than the uptake machinery, and little is known about the regulation of competence in the natural environments of these bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Solomon JM, Grossman AD |title=Who's competent and when: regulation of natural genetic competence in bacteria |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=150–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8901420 |doi=10.1016/0168-9525(96)10014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transcription factor]]s have been discovered which regulate competence; an example is sxy (also known as tfoX) which has been found to be regulated in turn by a [[Sxy 5' UTR element|5' non-coding RNA element]].&lt;ref name="pmid1653215"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Redfield RJ |title=sxy-1, a Haemophilus influenzae mutation causing greatly enhanced spontaneous competence |journal=J. Bacteriol. |volume=173 |issue=18 |pages=5612–8 |date=September 1991 |pmid=1653215 |pmc=208288 |doi= |url=http://jb.asm.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=1653215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In bacteria capable of forming [[endospore|spores]], conditions inducing sporulation often overlap with those inducing competence.  Thus cultures or colonies containing sporulating cells  often also contain competent cells.  Recent research by Süel ''et al.'' has identified an excitable core module of genes which can explain entry into and exit from competence when [[cellular noise]] is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Süel GM, Garcia-Ojalvo J, Liberman LM, Elowitz MB |title=An excitable gene regulatory circuit induces transient cellular differentiation |journal=Nature |volume=440 |pages=545–50 |year=2006|doi=10.1038/nature04588 |pmid=16554821 |issue=7083}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most competent bacteria are thought to take up all DNA molecules with roughly equal efficiencies, but bacteria in the families [[Neisseriaceae]] and [[Pasteurellaceae]] preferentially take up DNA fragments containing [[Uptake signal sequence|short DNA sequences]], termed DNA uptake sequence (DUS) in Neisseriaceae and uptake signal sequence (USS) in Pasteurellaceae, that are very frequent in their own genomes.  Neisserial genomes contain thousands of copies of the preferred sequence GCCGTCTGAA, and [[Pasteurellaceae|Pasteurellacean]] genomes contain either AAGTGCGGT or ACAAGCGGT.&lt;ref name="dubnau"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| pmc=2817400|pmid=20333176| year=2009| last1=Findlay| first1=WA| last2=Redfield| first2=RJ| title=Coevolution of DNA uptake sequences and bacterial proteomes| volume=1| pages=45–55| doi=10.1093/gbe/evp005| journal=Genome Biology and Evolution }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolutionary functions and consequences of competence==

Most proposals made for the primary [[evolution]]ary function of natural competence as a part of natural bacterial transformation fall into three categories:  (1) the selective advantage of genetic diversity; (2) DNA uptake as a source of nucleotides (DNA as “food”); and (3) the selective advantage of a new strand of DNA to promote homologous recombinational repair of damaged DNA (DNA repair). A secondary suggestion has also been made, noting the occasional advantage of [[horizontal gene transfer]].

===Hypothesis of genetic diversity===

Arguments to support genetic diversity as the primary evolutionary function of sex (including bacterial transformation) are given by Barton and Charleworth .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Barton NH, Charlesworth B |title= Why sex and recombination?  |journal=Science |volume=281 |issue= 5385 |pages=1986–1990 |year=1998 |pmid=9748151 |doi= 10.1126/science.281.5385.1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and by Otto and Gerstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Otto SP, Gerstein AC |title= Why have sex? The population genetics of sex and recombination |journal= Biochem Soc Trans |volume= 34 |issue= Pt 4 |pages= 519–522 |date=Aug 2006 |pmid= 16856849 |doi= 10.1042/BST0340519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the theoretical difficulties associated with the  [[evolution of sexual reproduction|evolution of sex]] suggest that sex for genetic diversity is problematic.  Specifically with respect to bacterial transformation, competence requires the high cost of a global protein synthesis switch, with, for example, more than 16 genes that are switched on only during competence of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peterson S, Cline RT, Tettelin H, Sharov V, Morrison DA |title= Gene expression analysis of the Streptococcus pneumoniae competence regulons by use of DNA microarrays |journal= J. Bacteriol.|volume= 182 |issue= 21|pages= 6192–6202|date=Nov 2000 |pmid= 11029442 |pmc=94756 |doi= 10.1128/JB.182.21.6192-6202.2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, since bacteria tend to grow in clones, the DNA available for transformation would generally have the same genotype as that of the recipient cells.  Thus, there is always a high cost in protein expression without, in general, an increase in diversity.  Other differences between competence and sex have been considered in models of the evolution of genes causing competence; these models found that competence's postulated recombinational benefits were even more elusive than those of sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Redfield R|title=Is sex with dead cells ever better than no sex at all? |journal= Genetics|volume= 119 |pages= 213–21|year= 1988 |pmid=3396864 |issue=1 |pmc=1203342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothesis of DNA as food===

The second hypothesis, DNA as food, relies on the fact that cells that take up DNA inevitably acquire the nucleotides the DNA consists of, and, because nucleotides are needed for DNA and  [[RNA]] synthesis and are expensive to synthesize, these may make a significant contribution to the cell's energy budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Redfield RJ |title=Do bacteria have sex? |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=634–9 |year=2001 |pmid=11483988 |doi=10.1038/35084593|url=https://zenodo.org/record/889964/files/article.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Some naturally competent bacteria also secrete nucleases into their surroundings, and all bacteria can take up the free nucleotides these nucleases generate from environmental DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dubnau D|title=DNA uptake in bacteria |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol|volume=53 |pages=217–44|year=1999 |pmid=10547691 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.53.1.217 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energetics of DNA uptake are not understood in any system, so it is difficult to compare the efficiency of nuclease secretion to that of DNA uptake and internal degradation. In principle the cost of nuclease production and the uncertainty of nucleotide recovery must be balanced against the energy needed to synthesize the uptake machinery and to pull DNA in. Other important factors are the likelihoods that nucleases and competent cells will encounter DNA molecules, the relative inefficiencies of nucleotide uptake from the environment and from the periplasm (where one strand is degraded by competent cells), and the advantage of producing ready-to-use nucleotide monophosphates from the other strand in the cytoplasm.  Another complicating factor is the self-bias of the DNA uptake systems of species in the family ''Pasteurellaceae'' and the genus ''Neisseria'', which could reflect either selection for recombination or for mechanistically efficient uptake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Maughan H|title=Bacterial DNA uptake sequences can accumulate by molecular drive alone |journal=Genetics|volume=186 |pages=613–27|year=2010 |pmc=2954483 |doi=10.1534/genetics.110.119438 |pmid=20628039 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Redfield R, Schrag M, Dead A |title=The evolution of bacterial transformation: sex with poor relations. |journal=Genetics|volume=146 |pages=27–38|year=1997 |pmid=9135998 |issue=1 |pmc=1207942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hypothesis of repair of DNA damage===
In bacteria, the problem of DNA damage is most pronounced during periods of stress, particularly oxidative stress, that occur during crowding or starvation conditions.  Under such conditions there is often only a single chromosome present.  The finding that some bacteria induce competence under such stress conditions, supports the third hypothesis, that transformation exists to permit DNA repair.  In experimental tests, bacterial cells exposed to agents damaging their DNA, and then undergoing transformation, survived better than cells exposed to DNA damage that did not undergo transformation (Hoelzer and Michod, 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hoelzer MA, Michod RE |title=DNA repair and the evolution of transformation in ''Bacillus subtilis''. III. Sex with damaged DNA|journal=Genetics |volume=128 |issue=2 |pages=215–23|year=1991 |pmid=1906416 |pmc=1204460}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, competence to undergo transformation is often inducible by known DNA damaging agents (reviewed by Michod ''et al''., 2008 and Bernstein ''et al''., 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM |title=Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens |journal=Infect Genet Evol|volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=267–85 |year=2008 |pmid=18295550 |doi=10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002}}  http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Bernstein | first =Harris |author2=Carol Bernstein |author3=Richard E. Michod  | year =2012 |url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 | title = DNA Repair: New Research |chapter=Chapter 1 - DNA Repair as the Primary Adaptive Function of Sex in Bacteria and Eukaryotes | publisher = NOVA Publishers | isbn = 978-1-62100-756-2 | pages = 1–50 }} https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, a strong short-term selective advantage for natural competence and transformation would be its ability to promote homologous recombinational DNA repair under conditions of stress. Such stress conditions might be incurred during bacterial infection of a susceptible host.  Consistent with this idea, Li et al.&lt;ref name="pmid27068094"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li G, Liang Z, Wang X, Yang Y, Shao Z, Li M, Ma Y, Qu F, Morrison DA, Zhang JR |title=Addiction of Hypertransformable Pneumococcal Isolates to Natural Transformation for In Vivo Fitness and Virulence |journal=Infect. Immun. |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=1887–901 |year=2016 |pmid=27068094 |doi=10.1128/IAI.00097-16 |pmc=4907133}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that, among different highly transformable ''[[S. pneumoniae]]'' isolates, nasal colonization fitness and virulence (lung infectivity) depends on an intact competence system.

A counter argument was made based on the 1993 report of Redfield who found that single-stranded and double-stranded damage to chromosomal DNA did not induce or enhance competence or transformation in ''B. subtilis'' or ''H. influenzae'', suggesting that selection for repair has played little or no role in the evolution of competence in these species&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Redfield R|title=Evolution of natural transformation: testing the DNA repair hypothesis in ''Bacillus subtilis'' and ''Haemophilus influenzae'' |journal=Genetics|volume=133 |pages=755–61|year=1993 |pmid=8462839 |issue=4 |pmc=1205397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However more recent evidence indicates that competence for transformation is, indeed, specifically induced by DNA damaging conditions.  For instance, Claverys ''et al''. in 2006&lt;ref name=Claverys&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Claverys | first1 = JP | last2 = Prudhomme | first2 = M | last3 = Martin | first3 = B | year = 2006 | title = Induction of competence regulons as a general response to stress in [[gram-positive]] bacteria | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 60 | issue = 1| pages = 451–475 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.60.080805.142139 | pmid = 16771651 }}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the DNA damaging agents mitomycin C (a DNA cross-linking agent) and fluoroquinolone (a topoisomerase inhibitor that causes double-strand breaks) induce transformation in ''Streptococcus pneumoniae''.  In addition, Engelmoer and Rozen&lt;ref name=Engelmoer&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Engelmoer | first1 = D J | last2 = Rozen | first2 = D E | year = 2011 | title = Competence increases survival during stress in ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' | url = | journal = Evolution | volume = 65 | issue = 12| pages = 3475–3485 | doi = 10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01402.x | pmid = 22133219 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011 demonstrated that in ''S. pneumoniae'' transformation protects against the bactericidal effect of mitomycin C.  Induction of competence further protected against the antibiotics kanomycin and streptomycin.&lt;ref name=Claverys /&gt;&lt;ref name=Engelmoer /&gt; Although these aminoglycoside antibiotics were previously regarded as non-DNA damaging, recent studies in 2012 of Foti ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foti | first1 = JJ | last2 = Devadoss | first2 = B | last3 = Winkler | first3 = JA | last4 = Collins | first4 = JJ | last5 = Walker | first5 = GC | year = 2012 | title = Oxidation of the guanine nucleotide pool underlies cell death by bactericidal antibiotics | url = | journal = Science | volume = 336 | issue = 6079| pages = 315–319 | doi = 10.1126/science.1219192 | pmid = 22517853 | pmc=3357493}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that a substantial portion of their bactericidal activity results from release of the [[hydroxyl radical]] and induction of DNA damages, including double-strand breaks.

Dorer ''et al''.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dorer | first1 = MS | last2 = Fero | first2 = J | last3 = Salama | first3 = NR | year = 2010 | title = DNA damage triggers genetic exchange in ''Helicobacter pylori'' | url = | journal = PLoS Pathog | volume = 6 | issue = 7| page = e1001026 | doi = 10.1371/journal.ppat.1001026 | pmid = 20686662 | pmc=2912397}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2010, showed that ciprofloxacin, which interacts with DNA gyrase and causes production of double-strand breaks, induces expression of competence genes in ''Helicobacter pylori'', leading to increased transformation.  In 2011 studies of ''Legionella pneumophila'', Charpentier ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Charpentier&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Charpentier | first1 = X | last2 = Kay | first2 = E | last3 = Schneider | first3 = D | last4 = Shuman | first4 = HA | year = 2011 | title = Antibiotics and UV radiation induce competence for natural transformation in ''Legionella pneumophila'' | url = | journal = J Bacteriol | volume = 193 | issue = 5| pages = 1114–1121 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01146-10 | pmid = 21169481 | pmc=3067580}}&lt;/ref&gt; tested 64 toxic molecules to determine which ones induce competence.  Only six of these molecules, all DNA damaging agents, strongly induced competence.  These molecules were [[norfloxacin]], [[ofloxacin]] and [[nalidixic acid]] (inhibitors of [[DNA gyrase]] that produce double strand breaks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Albertini | first1 = S | last2 = Chételat | first2 = A A | last3 = Miller | first3 = B | last4 = Muster | first4 = W | last5 = Pujadas | first5 = E | last6 = Strobel | first6 = R | last7 = Gocke | first7 = E | year = 1995 | title = Genotoxicity of 17 gyrase- and four mammalian topoisomerase II-poisons in prokaryotic and eukaryotic test systems | url = | journal = Mutagenesis | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 343–351 | pmid = 7476271 | doi=10.1093/mutage/10.4.343}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[mitomycin C]] (which produces inter-strand cross-links), [[bicyclomycin]] (causes single- and double-strand breaks&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Washburn | first1 = R S | last2 = Gottesman | first2 = M E | year = 2011 | title = Transcription termination maintains chromosome integrity | url = | journal = Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A | volume = 108 | issue = 2| pages = 792–7 | doi =  10.1073/pnas.1009564108 | pmid = 21183718 | pmc=3021005}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[hydroxyurea]] (causes oxidation of DNA bases&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sakano | first1 = K | last2 = Oikawa | first2 = S | last3 = Hasegawa | first3 = K | last4 = Kawanishi | first4 = S | year = 2001 | title = Hydroxyurea induces site-specific DNA damage via formation of hydrogen peroxide and nitric oxide | url = | journal = Jpn J Cancer Res | volume = 92 | issue = 11| pages = 1166–1174 | pmid = 11714440 | doi=10.1111/j.1349-7006.2001.tb02136.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Charpentier ''et al''.&lt;ref name=Charpentier /&gt; also showed that [[UV irradiation]] induces competence in ''L. pneumophila'' and further suggested that competence for transformation evolved as a response to DNA damage.

===Horizontal gene transfer===

A long-term advantage may occasionally be conferred by occasional instances of [[horizontal gene transfer]] also called ''lateral gene transfer'',  (which might result from [[non-homologous recombination]] after competence is induced), that could provide for antibiotic resistance or other advantages.

Regardless of the nature of selection for competence, the composite nature of bacterial genomes provides abundant evidence that the horizontal gene transfer caused by competence contributes to the genetic diversity that makes evolution possible.

'''Notarikon''' ({{lang-he-n|נוטריקון}} ''Noṭariqōn'') is a method of deriving a word, by using each of its initial (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|ראשי תיבות}}) or final letters ({{Hebrew|סופי תיבות}}) to stand for another, to form a sentence or idea out of the words.  Another variation uses the first ''and'' last letters, or the two middle letters of a word, in order to form another word.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_14926.html&lt;/ref&gt; The word "notarikon" is borrowed from the Greek language (νοταρικόν)), and was derived from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word "notarius" meaning "shorthand writer."&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Jewish usage: a guide to the use of Jewish terms,  By Sol Steinmetz, {{ISBN|0-7425-4387-0}}, 2005, [article "Notarikon"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Notarikon is one of the three ancient methods used by the Kabbalists (the other two are [[gematria]] and [[temurah (Kabbalah)|temurah]]) to rearrange words and sentences. These methods were used in order to derive the esoteric substratum and deeper spiritual meaning of the words in the Bible. Notarikon was also used in [[alchemy]].

== Usage by Rashi ==

[[Rashi]] uses notarikon seven times in his [[pirush]] ({{Hebrew|פירוש}}, "explanation") on [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]]:
*Bereishith (Genesis) 15:2 "{{Hebrew|וּבַגְּמָרָא שֶׁלָּנוּ דָּרְשׁוּ נוֹטְרִיקוֹן, דּוֹלֶה וּמַשְׁקֶה מִתּוֹרַת רַבּוֹ לַאֲחֵרִים}}"
*Bereishith (Genesis) 17:2 "{{Hebrew|כִּי אַב הֲמוֹן גּוֹיִם. לְשׁוֹן נוֹטְרִיקוֹן שֶׁל שְׁמוֹ}}"
*Bereishith (Genesis) 30:2 "{{Hebrew|וּמִדְרַשׁ אַגָּדָה יֵשׁ רַבִּים בִּלְשׁוֹן נוֹטָרִיקוֹן}}"
*Bereishith (Genesis) 49:22 "{{Hebrew|אֶבֶן יִשְׂרָאֵל. לְשׁוֹן נוֹטְרִיקוֹן אָב וּבֵן, ’אֲבָהָן וּבְנִין‘, יַעֲקֹב וּבָנָיו}}"
*Shemoth (Exodus) 20:12 "{{Hebrew|אִם תְּכַבֵּד יַאֲרִיכוּן יָמֶיךָ וְאִם לָאו יִקְצְרוּן. שֶׁדִּבְרֵי תוֹרָה נוֹטְרִיקוֹן הֵם נִדְרָשִׁים, מִכְּלָל הֵן לַאו וּמִכְּלָל לַאו הֵן}}" ''(The [[chiddush]] ("novel teaching") here is that the word {{Hebrew|{{noitalics|נוטריקון}}}} in [[gematria]]: {{Noitalic|{{Hebrew| מכלל הן לאו ומכלל לאו הן}}}}.)''
*Bamidbar (Numbers) 11:8 "{{Hebrew|דָּבָר אַחֵר, 'לְשַׁד' לְשׁוֹן נוֹטָרִיקוֹן לַ'יִשׁ שֶׁ'מֶן דְּ'בַשׁ, כְּעִסָּה הַנִּלּוֹשָׁה בְשֶׁמֶן וּקְטוּפָה בִדְבַשׁ.}}"
*Bamidbar (Numbers) 22:32 "{{Hebrew|כִּי יָרַט הַדֶּרֶךְ לְנֶגְדִּי. רַבּוֹתֵינוּ חַכְמֵי הַמִּשְׁנָה דְּרָשׁוּהוּ נוֹטָרִיקוֹן, יָרְאָה, רָאֲתָה, נָטְתָה}}"

== Usage in magic ==
A common usage of Notarikon in the practice of Kabbalah, either for magic or ritual, was to form secret names of God derived from religious or biblical verses. Agla, an acronym for ''Atah Gibor Le-olam Adonai'', translated, "You, O Lord, are mighty forever," is one of the most famous examples of Notarikon.  Dozens of examples are found in the [[Berit Menuchah]], as is referenced in the following passage:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And it was discovered that the Malachim were created from the wind and the fine and enlightening air, and that the name of their origin עַמַרֻמְאֵליוְהָ was derived from the verse (Psalms 104:4): ‘Who makest the winds thy messengers, fire and flame thy ministers’ (.....) And when the lights reach this Sefira, they unite and receive a name that is derived from the central letters of the following verse (Genesis 6:2): ‘The sons of God saw that the daughters of men were fair; and they took to wife such of them as they chose.’ And this valiant name, which is drawn in the Gevura, is {{Hebrew|רְנֵלבֺנקְהֵכשְיִהְ}}.&lt;ref&gt;''Brit Menucha - Covenant of Rest'', Providence University Press 2007, pg. 133&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sefer Gematriot, is another example where many Notarikons for usage on talismans, are given from Biblical verses.&lt;ref&gt;Theodore Schrire, ''Hebrew Amulets: Their Decipherment and Interpretation'' Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19125">'''Paul Anton Cibis''', [[M.D.]] (26 June 1911 – 30 April 1965) was a clinical [[ophthalmologist]], [[surgeon]] and pioneer of modern [[Eye surgery|vitreoretinal surgery]]. As part of [[Operation Paperclip]] Cibis came to the United States and performed research for the [[U.S. Air Force]] and studied the effects of [[atomic weapons]] testing on the [[eye]]. He was an internationally recognized expert in retinal detachment surgery and pioneered the use of liquid [[silicon]] for this procedure.

==Life and times==
Cibis was born in 1911 at [[Rybnik]], [[Silesia]], Germany. In 1921, this became part of Poland. Prior to entry into university, he studied in [[Rybnik]] and [[Racibórz]] [[Silesia]]. Cibis then studied medicine at the [[University of Breslau]] and at [[Munich]]. He attended [[University of Berlin]] for [[medical school]]. He interned at Berlin and completed residency at Heidelberg. At Heidelberg he met his future wife Lisa, a medical student who became an ophthalmologist. The couple married in 1939. Lisa held membership in the German Ophthalmological Society. Later, they had a daughter, Andrea and son, Gerhart and both children pursued careers in ophthalmology after studying medicine in the United States at [[Washington University, St. Louis]]. From 1940 to 1944, he held the position of research and clinical assistant in the University Eye Clinic at Heidelberg. Upon appointment to Heidelberg, and at the outbreak of [[World War II]], Cibis was quickly drafted into the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)]]. He served on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian front]] for two years, as an [[ophthalmologist]] and medical administrator. From 1944 to 1949, Cibis was Oberarzt (senior physician) and [[Docent]] for Ophthalmology at Heidelberg.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;Post, M. Hayward. (1965).

From 1 June 1955 to 1 June 1956, Cibis was an instructor in ophthalmology at [[Washington University in Saint Louis]], [[Missouri]]. From 1956 to 1965, he held the position of associate professor of ophthalmology at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. In 1965, he died of a heart attack at [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] shortly after his return from England where he had attended the Annual Meeting of the Ophthalmological Society of the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=BJO-Editor&gt;Editor. (November 1965). Paul Anton Cibis. British Journal of Ophthalmology. 49(11): 608–609.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
His initial education was in [[Rybnik]] and then in [[Racibórz]] Silesia. In 1931, Cibis began studies in [[medicine]] at the [[University of Breslau]] and continued for two additional years in [[Munich]]. Upon completion, he attended [[medical school]] at the [[University of Berlin]] and graduated on 4 December 1936. His [[internship]] was at Berlin in 1937. In 1938, he went to Heidelberg for [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] at the University Eye Clinic. In 1940, Cibis completed [[Residency (medicine)|residency]] in [[ophthalmology]] at the [[University Hospital Heidelberg|University of Heidelberg Eye Clinic]]. Until 1949, he was chief assistant in ophthalmology at the Eye Clinic.&lt;ref name=BJO-Editor/&gt;

==School of Aviation Medicine==
In June 1949, he came to the United States as a research ophthalmologist at the [[United States Air Force]] [[Randolph Air Force Base#School of Aviation Medicine|School of Aviation Medicine]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]] in [[Texas]] under [[Operation Paperclip]].   The work involved the visual and physiological problems of aviation, space travel and atomic weapons testing, including [[Flash blindness|flashblindness]].&lt;ref name=BJO-Editor/&gt; Cibis worked with Werner K. Noell to study the [[ocular]] effects from high intensity [[x-radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cibis, Paul A., Noell, Werner K. and Eichel, Bertram. (1955). "Ocular effects produced by high-intensity x-radiation." AMA Archives of Ophthalmology. 53(5): 651-663.&lt;/ref&gt; He paired with David V.L. Brown to analyze the retinal changes as a result of [[ionizing radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;Cibis, P. A., &amp; Brown, David V.L. (1955). Retinal changes following ionizing radiation. American Journal of Ophthalmology. 40(5): 84-88.&lt;/ref&gt; The team of Cibis, Brown and [[John E. Pickering]] utilized [[Rhesus monkeys]] to study the effect of [[gamma radiation]] on the [[retina]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, D. V., Cibis, P. A., &amp; Pickering, J. E. (1955). Radiation Studies on the Monkey Eye: I. Effects of Gamma Radiation on the Retina. AMA Archives of Ophthalmology. 54(2): 249-256.&lt;/ref&gt; The joint efforts from Byrnes, Brown, Rose and Cibis studied retinal burns, [[chorioretinal]] burns and [[flashblindness]] that resulted from atomic weapons tests. The group was interested in the biological effects of atomic weapons. Much of this work was performed as part of [[Operation Redwing]].&lt;ref&gt;Byrnes, Victor Allen, Brown, D. V., Rose, H.

In 1955, Dr. [[Bernard Becker]] offered Cibis a position in the Department of Ophthalmology at [[Washington University, St. Louis]].&lt;ref name=Feibel2014&gt;Feibel, Robert M. (10 April 2014). Paul A. Cibis, MD:  A St. Louis Pioneer of Modern Vitreoretinal Surgery. Historia Medica Lecture on Paul A. Cibis, MD. Becker Medical Library. Washington University School of Medicine. St. Louis, Missouri.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Washington University in St. Louis==
In 1955, he was recruited by Dr. [[Bernard Becker]] to become a member of the Department of Ophthalmology at [[Washington University, St. Louis]]. From 1 June 1955 to 1 June 1956, Cibis was an instructor in ophthalmology at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri. From 1956 until 1965, he was associate professor of ophthalmology at Washington University. Cibis became an international authority for the treatment of disease of the [[vitreous humor|vitreous]] and [[retina]].  The surgical techniques he pioneered and developed, involved directly operating on the vitreous to repair retinal detachments. The techniques were innovative and ground breaking.&lt;ref name=Feibel2014/&gt; In St. Louis, Cibis teamed with [[Bernard Becker]], [[Michel Ter-Pogossian]], M.A. Constant and M.R. Smith to continue work on the [[ocular]] effects from [[x-radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Becker|Becker, Bernard]], Constant, M. A., Cibis, P. A., [[Michel Ter-Pogossian|Ter-Pogossian, Michel]], &amp; Smith, M. R. (1956). The effect of moderate doses of X-ray irradiation on ocular tissue. American Journal of Ophthalmology. 42(4): 51-58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cibis was an internationally recognized expert in retinal detachment surgery. He pioneered this procedure. The most significant contribution to ophthalmologic surgery being: 
"the demonstration of the technique of injecting liquid [[silicon]] into the [[vitreous chamber]] to replace lost or shrunken vitreous thus forcing the [[retina]] back into apposition with the [[choroid]]."&lt;ref name=BJO-Editor/&gt;

==Professional affiliations==
Cibis was an active member of several professional societies. These include the German Ophthalmological Society, the [[The Optical Society|Optical Society of America]], the Association for Research in Ophthalmology and Otolaryngology, the [[American Medical Association]], the [[Jules Gonin]] Club, the German Medical Society of Chicago, the Pan-American Ophthalmological Association, and the Pan-Pacific Surgical Association. Shortly after his death, the [[American Ophthalmological Society]] elected Cibis as a member.&lt;ref name=Post/&gt;&lt;ref name=Okun/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feibel/&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 1949, [[Docent]] Dr. Paul Cibis was granted the [[Albrecht von Graefe]] Award by the German Ophthalmological Society of Heidelberg for the years 1940 to 1948 inclusive.&lt;ref&gt;Editor. (2015). 1949 Graefe Award. Deutsche Ophthalmologische Gesellschaft. D.O.G. Munich, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; He singly authored numerous papers, was coauthor on numerous other publications, and produced one textbook titled, ''Vitreoretinal pathology and surgery in retinal detachment''.&lt;ref&gt;Cibis, P. A. (1965). Vitreoretinal pathology and surgery in retinal detachment. St. Louis: CV Mosby.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reference work on ophthamology by Dr. Anand Shroff, ''An Eye on Numbers: A Ready Reckoner in Ophthalmology'', lists in the contributions section on vitreoretinal surgery, in 1962 Cibis is credited with utilizing silicon oil used for the repair of retinal detachments. In 1965, he was recognized as being the first to describe intraocular cryotherapy, in addition to being the first to cut vitreous adhesions and traction bands.&lt;ref&gt;Shroff, Anand. (2011). An Eye on Numbers: A Ready Reckoner in Ophthalmology. PostScript Media Pvt.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Paul A. Cibis Distinguished Professorship of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences was established by an anonymous donor at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].&lt;ref name=Feibel2014/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15634">[[Image:Robonaut 2 working.jpg|thumb|350px|R2s in July 2009]]

A '''robonaut''' is a [[humanoid robot]], part of a development project conducted by the Dexterous Robotics Laboratory at [[NASA]]'s [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) in [[Houston]], [[Texas]]. Robonaut differs from other current space-faring robots in that, while most current space robotic systems (such as robotic arms, cranes and exploration rovers) are designed to move large objects, Robonaut's tasks require more dexterity.

The core idea behind the Robonaut series is to have a humanoid machine work alongside [[astronauts]]. Its [[Design|form factor]] and dexterity are designed such that Robonaut can use space tools and work in similar environments suited to astronauts.

The latest Robonaut version, R2, the first US-built robot on the ISS,&lt;ref name="robonaut.default"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut home page|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=Nasa}}&lt;/ref&gt; delivered by STS-133 in Feb 2011, is a robotic torso designed to assist with crew [[Extravehicular activity|EVA's]] and can hold tools used by the crew.&lt;ref name="ROBOISS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/ISS/|title=Robonaut Robonaut ISS Mission|accessdate=27 May 2011|publisher=Nasa|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531075031/http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/iss/|archivedate=31 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Robonaut 2 does not have adequate protection needed to exist outside the space station and enhancements and modifications would be required to allow it to move around the station's interior.&lt;ref name="ROBOISS"/&gt; NASA states "Robonauts are essential to NASA's future as we go beyond [[low Earth orbit]]",&lt;ref name="robonaut.default"/&gt; and R2 will provide performance data about how a robot may work side-by-side with astronauts.&lt;ref name="ROBOISS"/&gt;

==Robonaut 1==
'''Robonaut 1 (R1)''' was the first model. The two Robonaut versions (R1A and R1B) had many partners including [[DARPA]]. None were flown to space. Other designs for Robonaut propose uses for [[teleoperation]] on planetary surfaces, where Robonaut could explore a planetary surface while receiving instructions from orbiting astronauts above.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholos Wethington, Universe Today, "[http://www.universetoday.com/2007/12/03/future-mars-explorers-might-only-see-the-planet-from-orbit/ Future Mars Explorers Might Only See the Planet from Orbit]" December 3rd, 2007 (accessed 12 August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Robonaut B was introduced in 2002, R1B is a portable version of R1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Eng-26.pdf Robonaut] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721052911/http://research.jsc.nasa.gov/PDF/Eng-26.pdf |date=2011-07-21 }}, Robert Ambrose, Johnson Space Center&lt;/ref&gt; R1 had several lower bodies.  One of these was the Zero-G Leg, which if Robonaut was working on the space station he would climb using the external handrails and then use his zero-g leg to latch onto the station using a WIF socket. Another was the Robotic Mobility Platform (RMP), developed in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/16-899/papers/hands/RobonautHand/robonautMobile.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624223753/http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/16-899/papers/hands/RobonautHand/robonautMobile.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2010-06-24|title=Mobile Manipulation using NASA’s Robonaut|date=April 2004|publisher=International Conference on Robotics &amp; Automation|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a base with two wheels using a [[Segway PT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Segway platform puts robots in motion |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/robotics/2004-10-20-rise-of-robots_x.htm |quote=Segway's self-balancing robot platform takes up about 2 square feet and comes equipped with software and interface electronics necessary to receive, process and execute commands from an onboard robot payload. |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 20, 2004 |accessdate=2010-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; And the four wheeled Centaur 1, which was developed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/m-whitepaper.asp|title=Robonaut: Project M Whitepaper|work=nasa.gov|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527111733/http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/m-whitepaper.asp|archivedate=2010-05-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Robonaut has participated in NASA's [[Desert Research and Technology Studies]] field trials in the Arizona desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Berger|first=Brian|title=NASA auditions robots for lunar exploration|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15923720/ns/technology_and_science-space/t/nasa-auditions-robots-lunar-missions/|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the automotive company [[General Motors]] expressed interest in the project and proposed to team up with NASA. In 2007 a Space Act Agreement was signed that allowed GM and NASA to work together on the next generation of Robonaut.&lt;ref name=Fact&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/469616main_Robonaut2_factsheet.pdf|title=Robonaut 2: Fact Sheet|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

== Robonaut 2 ==
[[File:Robonaut2 - first movement aboard ISS.jpg|thumb|R2 moves for the first time aboard the ISS|250 px]]
In February 2010, '''Robonaut 2 (R2)''' was revealed to the public. R2 is capable of speeds more than four times faster than R1, is more compact, more dexterous, and includes a deeper and wider range of sensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robonaut.jsc.nasa.gov/default.asp|title=Robonaut 2|publisher=NASA|accessdate=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can move its arms up to 2&amp;nbsp;m/s, has a 40&amp;nbsp;lb payload capacity and its hands have a grasping force of roughly 5&amp;nbsp;lbs. per finger. There are over 350 sensors and 38 [[PowerPC]] processors in the robot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/116741904.html|title=NASA’s First Robot Astronaut|work=Sky &amp; Telescope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Station crew members will be able to operate R2, as will controllers on the ground; both will do so using [[telepresence]]. One of the improvements over the previous Robonaut generation is that R2 doesn’t need constant supervision. In anticipation of a future destination in which distance and time delays would make continuous management problematic, R2 was designed to be set to tasks and then carry them through [[Autonomous robot|autonomously]] with periodic status checks.&lt;ref name=Fact/&gt; While not all human range of motion and sensitivity has been duplicated, the robot's hand has 12 [[Degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] as well as 2 degrees of freedom in wrist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://er.jsc.nasa.gov/SEH/Robotics/index.html|title=Robonaut Hand Subsystem|work=nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lovchik and M. A. Diftler, "The Robonaut hand: a dexterous robot hand for space," 1999 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation,
Vol. 2, pp. 907-912, {{doi|10.1109/ROBOT.1999.772420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R2 model also uses [[touch sensor]]s at the tips of its fingers.&lt;ref&gt;M.K. O'Malley and R.O. Ambrose, "Haptic feedback applications for Robonaut," ''Industrial Robot: An International Journal, Vol. 30,'' pp. 531-542 (2003) {{doi|10.1108/01439910310506800}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R2 was designed as a prototype to be used on Earth but mission managers were impressed by R2 and chose to send it to the ISS.&lt;ref name=Fact/&gt; Various upgrades were made to qualify it for use inside the station. The outer skin materials were exchanged to meet the station’s flammability requirements, shielding was added to reduce electromagnetic interference, processors were upgraded to increase the robot’s radiation tolerance, the original fans were replaced with quieter ones to accommodate the station’s noise requirements, and the power system was rewired to run on the station’s direct current system rather than the alternating current used on the ground.&lt;ref name=Fact/&gt;

[[File:Robonaut upgrade.jpg|thumbnail|Robonaut being upgraded on-orbit|250 px]]
Robonaut 2 was launched on [[STS-133]] on February 24, 2011, and delivered to the [[ISS]]. On August 22, R2 was powered up for the first time while in low earth orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyHZpczl9fo|title=Welcome Aboard Robonaut 2 |date=2011-09-19|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was called a "power soak" which is a power system test only with no movement. On October 13, R2 moved for the first time while in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=glLX_sKTU2I|title=First Movement of Robonaut 2 on ISS |date=2011-11-02|publisher=NASA|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conditions aboard the space station provide a proving ground for robots to work shoulder to shoulder with people in microgravity. Once this has been demonstrated inside the station, software upgrades and lower bodies may be added, allowing R2 to move around the interior of the station and perform maintenance tasks, such as vacuuming or cleaning filters.&lt;ref name=Fact/&gt; A pair of legs were delivered to the ISS on [[SpaceX CRS-3|SpX-3]] in April 2014. The battery backpack was planned to be launched on a later flight in Summer/Fall 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/AstroRobonaut/status/443814031355174912|title=Twitter- AstroRobonaut|date=12 March 2014|publisher=NASA|accessdate=29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the design of the R2 robot, a 3D time of flight imager will be used in conjunction with a stereo camera pair to provide depth information and visible stereo images to the system. This allows the R2 to "see", which is one of the basic preconditions to fulfill its tasks. To integrate the various sensor data types in a single development environment the image processing software [[Halcon (software)|Halcon]] 9.0 from MVTec Software (Munich, Germany [http://www.mvtec.com]) is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photonics.com/Article.aspx?AID=50769|title=Vision Software Enables NASA Robonaut to See|author=Dr. Lutz Kreutzer, Mvtec Software GmbH|date=1 May 2012|work=Photonics Spectra}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further upgrades could be added to allow R2 to work outside in the vacuum of space, where R2 could help space walkers perform repairs, make additions to the station or conduct scientific experiments. While there were initially no plans to return the launched R2 back to earth&lt;ref name=Fact/&gt;, NASA announced on 1 April 2018 that R2 would return to Earth in May 2018 with CRS-14 Dragon for repair and eventual relaunch in about a year's time.&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/ChrisG_NSF/status/980518676024758272&lt;/ref&gt;
NASA's experience with R2 on the station will help them understand its capabilities for possible deep space missions.

&lt;/center&gt;

=== Project M ===
In late 2009, a proposed mission called [[Project M (NASA)|Project M]] was announced by [[Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center|Johnson Space Center]] that, if it had been approved, would have had the objective of landing an R2 robot on the Moon within 1,000 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universetoday.com/2010/02/05/will-nasa-send-robots-to-the-moon-with-project-m/|title=Will NASA Send Robots to the Moon with "Project M?"|author=Nancy Atkinson|date=5 February 2010|work=Universe Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m&gt;{{cite news |title=At NASA, a Quiet Quest to Send a Humanoid Robot to the Moon |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/02/science/space/02robot.html |quote=A humanoid dextrous robot — at least the top half — already exists: Robonaut 2, developed by NASA and General Motors, is packed on the shuttle Discovery, scheduled for liftoff on Wednesday.|work=[[New York Times]] |date=November 1, 2010 |accessdate=2010-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Actually, I'm just going to take the unreferenced claim out of here because it doesn't have anything to do with the "history" of the facility (despite being in the history section), and the website doesn't support this claim. Why would something closed to the public have a gift shop?</comment>

[[Image:Science Center of Pinellas County (exterior view).jpg|frame|The Science Center of Pinellas County]]
The '''Science and Technology Education Innovation Center''', formerly known as the Science Center of Pinellas County, is an educational center in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]], United States.  It occupies {{convert|7|acre|m2}} of land located on 22nd Avenue North, in West St. Petersburg, located near the Tyrone Mall.

==History==
[[File:St Petersburg FL Science Center02.jpg|thumb]]
The Science Center is a non-profit organization founded in St. Petersburg in 1959 by [[William Guild (scientist)|William Guild]] and [[Nell Rodgers Croley]].  It was the first science center of its kind in the world , and it operates on donations and grants.  Its mission is to inspire interest in and to promoting the understanding of all sciences.

In 1966 the present main building was completed.  During the 1960s and early 70s, the center offered after-school and weekend classes for students from Kindergarten through middle school in such subjects as biology, chemistry, electronics and astronautics. Today about 22,000 children visit the building each school year during field trips.  The Science Center frequently works with Pinellas County schools, and all summer camp classes and science camps taught at the Science Center meet FCAT guidelines.  



==Features==

=== Margaret Ewell Dickins Marine Exhibit ===
In 2000 the Margaret Ewell Dickins Marine Room opened. The exhibit includes numerous [[aquarium]]s filled with marine creatures such as a [[snowflake moray]] and a [[black sea bass]]. The most popular feature is a 600-gallon touch tank where visitors can touch [[starfish]], [[horseshoe crab]]s, [[guitarfish]], [[slipper lobster]]s, [[hermit crab]]s and [[sea urchin]]s. In addition, the Science Center holds marine biology classes for children in this room during science summer camps and school breaks.

=== Observatory ===
In 1997, the [[Carol Samuels Observatory]] opened.  The observatory provides visitors with a view of cosmic events and features through a {{convert|16|in|mm|adj=on}} Meade telescope.  The research-grade telescope is the only one available to the public in Pinellas County in a non-university setting.  The [[St. Petersburg Astronomy Club]] holds a handful of events at the Science Center throughout the year, and helps the public use the Meade Telescope to view comets, eclipses, or planets.

===White Gardens===
The idea for the White Gardens came from [[Starley M. White]], Chairman of the Board of the former [[National Bank]].  Surrounding the White Gardens is a "Walk of States", a [[mosaic]] tile walkway made up of more than 50 sections, one section for each state in the United States. A segment of the walk is dedicated to the [[Seminole]] tribe and [[Andrew Jackson]].  Each of the 50 states are displayed in order of their admission into the union. The walkway shows an image of the state, including the state's bird and flower. Beside each state's tile walk the state's rock is on display.  The Walk of States was created by [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]] artist [[Attillio Puglisi]]. It was moved to the Science Center in 1971.

==Planetarium==
In 1971 the Discovery Center was built. This building houses the Columbia Planetarium.  In 2003 the Spirit of Columbia Theater and [[Planetarium]] opened.  The Planetarium offers a showing daily which is included in the $5 admission fee.  The Science Center's digital planetarium is the only one available to the public in Pinellas County.  It can show the sky as it was on any specific date in history and when the Center is rented out for birthday parties or anniversaries, it is often set to show the night sky as it appeared the night of the event commemorated.

==Optical lab==
The Science Center houses the only optical lab for the public to grind [[telescope]] [[mirror]]s in the southeastern United States.  The lab is operated by the St. Petersburg Astronomy Club.  The club welcomes the public to visit the optical lab on Saturdays between 1 p.m. and 4 p.m. to build a homemade telescope from scratch.

==Gift shop==
A small gift shop features science and space-themed toys which are available to purchase at reasonable prices.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">A '''slime layer''' in [[bacteria]] is an easily removable (e.g. by [[centrifugation]]), unorganized layer of [[extracellular]] material that surrounds bacteria cells. Specifically, this consists mostly of [[exopolysaccharide]]s, [[glycoprotein]]s, and [[glycolipid]]s.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bacterial Glycocalyx - Capsule &amp; Slime Layer|url = http://www.scienceprofonline.com/cell-biology/bacterial-glycocalyx-capsule-slime-layer.html|website = www.scienceprofonline.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The slime layer is not to be confused with the [[S-layer]], a separate and highly organised glycoprotein layer surrounding many bacterial cells.

The function of the slime layer is to protect the bacteria cells from environmental dangers such as [[antibiotic]]s and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The slime layer also allows bacteria to adhere to smooth surfaces such as [[prosthetic]] medical devices and [[catheter]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Microbial World :: A look at all things small|url = http://www.microbiologytext.com/index.php?module=Book&amp;func=displayarticle&amp;art_id=67|website = www.microbiologytext.com|access-date = 2016-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may permit bacterial colonies to survive chemical [[sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]] with [[chlorine]], [[iodine]], and other chemicals, leaving [[autoclaving]] or flushing with boiling water as the only certain methods of [[decontamination|decontaminating]].

A bacterial [[capsule (microbiology)|capsule]] is similar, but is an organized structure that does not wash off as easily as slime layers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Sergei Korolev]] initially promoted the Soyuz A-B-V circumlunar complex (''7K-9K-11K'') concept (also known as L1) in which a two-man craft Soyuz 7K would rendezvous with other components (9K and 11K) in Earth orbit to assemble a lunar excursion vehicle, the components being delivered by the proven [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] rocket. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/mwade/craft/soyuza.htm | title = Soyuz A | publisher = Mark Wade | work = astronautix.com | date = 2001-10-31 | accessdate = 2010-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/russia/lunar-l-1.htm|title=L-1 Lunar Circumnavigation Mission|first=John|last=Pike|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides the Soyuz 7K spacecraft, the complex would feature a [[Soyuz 9K]] booster and a [[Soyuz 11K]] tanker with twin whip antennas.

The 7K would have been equipped with cameras and sensors to study the lunar surface during the flyby, at a distance of 1,000 to 20,000 km from the Moon's surface. Total flight time would have been 7 to 8 days.

The '''Svalbard Global Seed Vault''' ({{lang-no|Svalbard globale frøhvelv}}) is a secure [[seed bank]] on the [[Norway|Norwegian]] island of [[Spitsbergen]] near [[Longyearbyen]] in the remote [[Arctic]] [[Svalbard]] [[archipelago]], about {{convert|1300|km}} from the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name="Charles2006"/&gt; Conservationist [[Cary Fowler]], in association with the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research ([[CGIAR]]),&lt;ref name="natgeo201107"/&gt; started the vault to preserve a wide variety of plant seeds that are duplicate samples, or "spare" copies, of seeds held in [[gene bank]]s worldwide. The seed vault is an attempt to insure against the loss of seeds in other genebanks during large-scale regional or [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|global crises]]. The seed vault is managed under terms spelled out in a tripartite agreement between the [[Politics of Norway|Norwegian government]], the [[Crop Trust]] and the [[Nordic Genetic Resource Center]] (NordGen).&lt;ref name="whatisnordgen"/&gt;

The Norwegian government entirely funded the vault's approximately {{NOK|45 million}} ({{US$|8.8 million}} in 2008) construction.&lt;ref name="nature20080326" /&gt; Storing seeds in the vault is free to end users, with Norway and the Crop Trust paying for operational costs. Primary funding for the Trust comes from organisations such as the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] and from various governments worldwide.&lt;ref name="trustdonors"/&gt;

==History==
The Nordic Gene Bank (NGB) has, since 1984, stored backup Nordic plant [[germplasm]] via frozen seeds in an abandoned coal mine at Svalbard. In January 2008, the Nordic Gene Bank merged with two other Nordic conservation groups to form [[NordGen]].&lt;ref name="nordgen-about"/&gt; The Svalbard Global Seed Vault officially opened on 26 February 2008,&lt;ref name="Mellgren2008"/&gt; although the first seeds arrived in January 2008.&lt;ref name="Kinver2008"/&gt; Five percent of the seeds in the vault, about 18,000 samples with 500 seeds each, came from the Centre for Genetic Resources of the Netherlands (CGN), part of [[Wageningen University]], Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Aarden2008"/&gt;

As part of the vault's first anniversary, more than 90,000 food crop seed samples were placed into storage, bringing the total number of seed samples to 400,000.&lt;ref name="time20090227"/&gt; Among the new seeds are included 32 varieties of potatoes from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s national gene banks and 20,000 new samples from the U.S. [[Agricultural Research Service]].&lt;ref name="HPJ2009"/&gt; Other seed samples came from [[Canada]] and [[Switzerland]], as well as international seed researchers from [[Colombia]], [[Mexico]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Young2009"/&gt; This {{convert|4|t|adj=on}} shipment brought the total number of seeds stored in the vault to over 20 million.&lt;ref name="time20090227"/&gt; As of this anniversary, the vault contained samples from approximately one-third of the world's most important food crop varieties.&lt;ref name="Young2009" /&gt; Also part of the anniversary, experts on food production and climate change met for a three-day conference in [[Longyearbyen]].&lt;ref name="bbc20090226"/&gt;

Japanese sculptor [[Mitsuaki Tanabe]] ([[:ja:田辺光彰|田辺光彰]])  presented a work to the vault named "The Seed 2009 / Momi In-Situ Conservation".&lt;ref name="norwayjp2009"/&gt; In 2010 a delegation of seven [[United States Congress|U.S. congressmen]] handed over a number of different varieties of [[chili pepper]].&lt;ref name="bbc20100713"/&gt;

By 2013, approximately one-third of the [[genus|genera]] diversity stored in gene banks globally was represented at the Seed Vault.&lt;ref name="Westengen2013"/&gt;

In October 2016, the seed vault experienced an unusually large degree of water intrusion due to higher than average temperatures and heavy rainfall. While it is common for some water to seep into the vault's {{convert|100|m|ft|0|adj=on}} entrance tunnel during the warmer spring months, in this case the water encroached {{convert|15|m|ft}} into the tunnel before freezing.&lt;ref name="popsci20170522"/&gt; The vault was designed for water intrusion and as such the seeds were not at risk.&lt;ref name="popsci20170522" /&gt; As a result, however, Norwegian public works agency [[Statsbygg]] plans to make improvements to the tunnel to prevent any such intrusion in the future, including waterproofing the tunnel walls, removing heat sources from the tunnel, and digging exterior drainage ditches.&lt;ref name="statsbygg20170520"/&gt;

For the seed vault's 10th anniversary on 26 February 2018 a shipment of 70,000 samples was delivered to the facility, bringing the number of samples received to more than one million (not counting withdrawals).&lt;ref name="newfood20180226"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/65063/seed-vault-marks-10th-anniversary/ |title=Seed Vault marks 10th anniversary with 70,000 new samples |work=New Food |first=George |last=Smith |date=26 February 2018 |accessdate=22 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, the total number of samples held at the vault was 967,216,&lt;ref name="newfood20180226" /&gt; representing over 13,000 years of [[History of agriculture|agricultural history]].&lt;ref name="time201704"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://time.com/doomsday-vault/ |title=Inside the 'Doomsday' Vault |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |first=Jennifer |last=Duggan |date=April 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408091443/http://time.com/doomsday-vault/ |archivedate=8 April 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Cary Fowler 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Cary Fowler at the Seed Vault during its construction]]

[[Prime Minister of Norway|Norway]], [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Sweden]], [[Prime Minister of Finland|Finland]], [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Denmark]], and [[Prime Minister of Iceland|Iceland]]'s [[prime minister]]s ceremonially laid "the first stone" on 19 June 2006.&lt;ref name="bbc20060619"/&gt;

The [[seedbank]] is {{convert|120|m}} inside a [[sandstone]] mountain on Spitsbergen Island,&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; and employs robust security systems. Seeds are packaged in special three-ply foil packets and heat sealed to exclude moisture.&lt;ref name="croptrust"/&gt; The facility is managed by the [[Nordic Genetic Resource Center]], though there are no permanent staff on-site.

Spitsbergen was considered ideal because it lacked [[Plate tectonics|tectonic activity]] and had [[permafrost]], which aids preservation. Its being {{convert|130|m}} above [[sea level]] will keep the site dry even if the [[ice cap]]s melt.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; Locally mined coal provides power for refrigeration units that further cool the seeds to the internationally recommended standard of {{convert|-18|C|F|1}}.&lt;ref name="regjeringen"/&gt; If the equipment fails, at least several weeks will elapse before the facility rises to the surrounding sandstone bedrock's temperature of {{convert|-3|C|F}},&lt;ref name="Charles2006" /&gt; and is estimated to take two centuries to warm to {{convert|0|C|F}}.&lt;ref name="economist2012"/&gt;

A feasibility study prior to construction determined that the vault could preserve most major food crops' seeds for hundreds of years. Some, including those of important grains, could potentially remain viable for thousands of years.&lt;ref name="Fowler2008"/&gt;

[[File:Svalbard Global Seed Vault (23273281972) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Entrance to the Seed Vault at dusk, highlighting its illuminated artwork]]
Running the length of the facility's roof and down the front face to the entryway is an illuminated artwork named ''Perpetual Repercussion'' by Norwegian artist Dyveke Sanne that marks the location of the vault from a distance.&lt;ref name="pubartnorway"/&gt; In Norway, government-funded construction projects exceeding a certain cost must include artwork. [[:no:Kunst i offentlige rom|KORO]], the Norwegian State agency overseeing art in public spaces, engaged the artist to install lighting that highlights the importance and qualities of Arctic light. The roof and vault entrance are filled with highly reflective stainless steel, mirrors, and prisms. The installation reflects polar light in the summer months, while in the winter, a network of 200 [[fibre-optic cable]]s gives the piece a muted greenish-turquoise and white light.&lt;ref name="croptrust-lighting"/&gt;

==Mission==
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault's mission is to provide a safety net against accidental loss of diversity in traditional genebanks. While the popular press has emphasized its possible utility in the event of a major regional or global catastrophe, it will be more frequently accessed when genebanks lose samples due to mismanagement, accident, equipment failures, funding cuts, and [[natural disaster]]s. These events occur with some regularity. War and civil strife have a history of destroying some genebanks. The national seed bank of the Philippines was damaged by flooding and later destroyed by a fire; the seed banks of Afghanistan and Iraq have been lost completely.&lt;ref name="economist2012"/&gt; According to ''[[The Economist]]'', "the Svalbard vault is a backup for the world's 1,750 seed banks, storehouses of [[crop diversity|agricultural biodiversity]]."&lt;ref name="economist2012"/&gt; Norwegian law has prohibited the storing of genetically modified seeds at the vault.&lt;ref name="sgsv-faq"/&gt;

The adjacent Arctic World Archive provides a similar service for data, which is etched as code into reels of film. Project lead Piql of Norway states that the film, when properly preserved, should last for 1,000 years.&lt;ref name="livesci20170401"/&gt;

==Access to seeds==
Vault seed samples are copies of samples stored in the depositing genebanks. Researchers, plant breeders, and other groups wishing to access seed samples cannot do so through the seed vault; they must instead request samples from the depositing genebanks. The samples stored in the genebanks will, in most cases, be accessible in accordance with the terms and conditions of the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], approved by 118 countries or parties.&lt;ref name="Fowler2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="planttreatymembers"/&gt;

The seed vault functions like a safe deposit box in a bank. The bank owns the building and the depositor owns the contents of his or her box. The Government of Norway owns the facility and the depositing genebanks own the seeds they send. The deposit of samples in Svalbard does not constitute a legal transfer of genetic resources. In genebank terminology this is called a "black box" arrangement.  Each depositor signs a Deposit Agreement with NordGen, acting on behalf of [[Norway]]. The Agreement makes clear that Norway does not claim ownership over the deposited samples and that ownership remains with the depositor, who has the sole right of access to those materials in the seed vault. No one has access to anyone else's seeds from the seed vault.&lt;ref name="Fowler2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="regjeringen-mo"/&gt; The database of samples and depositors is maintained by NordGen.&lt;ref name="nordgendatabase"/&gt;

The [[Syrian Civil War]] caused another seed bank, the [[International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas]] (ICARDA), to move its headquarters from [[Aleppo]] to [[Beirut]]. Due to difficulties by ICARDA in transferring its collection, in 2015 the Svalbard Vault authorized the first withdrawal of seeds in its history.&lt;ref name="reuters20150921"/&gt;&lt;ref name="huffpost20150922"/&gt;&lt;ref name="npr20150924"/&gt;

==Seed storage==
[[File:Storage containers in Svalbard Global Seed Vault 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Seed storage containers on metal shelving inside the vault]]

The seeds are stored in sealed three-ply foil packages,&lt;ref name="croptrust"/&gt; then placed into plastic tote containers on metal shelving racks. The storage rooms are kept at {{convert|-18|C|F|1}}. The low temperature and limited access to oxygen will ensure low metabolic activity and delay seed aging. The permafrost surrounding the facility will help maintain the low temperature of the seeds if the electricity supply fails.&lt;ref name="regjeringen-faq" /&gt;&lt;ref name="regjeringen-mo" /&gt; In the years since its opening, the vault saw minor water intrusion at its entrance during the annual spring permafrost thawing; warmer temperatures and heavy rainfall in October 2016 caused significantly greater amounts of water to inundate the entrance, but the facility's design ensured that the water froze after several meters and the seeds were not endangered.&lt;ref name="popsci20170522" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn20170521"/&gt;

==Crop Trust==
The [[Crop Trust]], officially known as the Global Crop Diversity Trust, plays a key role in the planning of the seed vault and coordinating shipments of seed samples to the Vault in conjunction with the Nordic Genetic Resource Center. The Trust provides most of the annual operating costs for the facility, and has set aside endowment funds to do so, while the Norwegian government finances upkeep of the structure itself. With support from the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] and other donors, the Crop Trust assists selected genebanks in developing countries as well as the international agricultural research centers in packaging and shipping seeds to the seed vault. An International Advisory Council provides guidance and advice. It includes representatives from the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]], [[CGIAR]], the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources and other institutions.&lt;ref name="jia2014"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/files/2014/10/141-146_Fowler_Feature.pdf |title=A 'Doomsday' Seed Vault to Protect the World's Diversity — An interview with Cary Fowler |journal=Journal of International Affairs |first=Cary |last=Fowler |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=141-146 |date=Spring–Summer 2014 |jstor=24461740 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209012746/https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/files/2014/10/141-146_Fowler_Feature.pdf |archivedate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Svalbard Global Seed Vault ranked at No. 6 on ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'}}s Best Inventions of 2008.&lt;ref name="time2008"/&gt;  It was awarded the Norwegian Lighting Prize for 2009.&lt;ref name="nor-light-prize"/&gt;

==Capacity==
Each seed sample consists of approximately 500 seeds sealed in an airtight aluminum bag. The facility has a storage capacity of 4.5 million seed samples.&lt;ref name="regjeringen20150223-about"/&gt;

'''Telexistence'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Susumu Tachi]], Telexistence, World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-283-633-5}}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is fundamentally a concept named for the general [[technology]] that enables a [[human]] being to have a real-time sensation of being at a place other than where he or she actually exists, and being able to interact with the remote environment, which may be real, virtual, or a combination of both. It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the control to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate [[robot]] working in a remote environment. Telexistence in the real environment through a virtual environment is also possible. This concept was first proposed by [[Susumu Tachi]] in Japan in 1980 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Evaluation device of mobility aids for the blind,
 Japanese Patent 1462696 filed on December 26, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1981 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Operation method of manipulators with sensoryinformation display functions, Japanese Patent 1458263 filed on January 14, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; as patents and the first report was published in Japanese in 1982 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi and M.Abe: Study on Telexistence (I) -Desigan of Visual Display-, Proceedings of the 21st SICE Annual Conference, pp.167-168, Tokyo, July 28–30, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;S. Tachi, K. Tanie, K. Komoriya and M. Kaneko, Tele-existence (I): Design and Evaluation of a Visual Display with Sensation of Presence, ''RoManSy 84 The Fifth CISM-IFToMM Symposium.'' 1984: 206–215.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''virino''' is a [[hypothesis|hypothetical]] [[infection|infectious]] particle that was once theorized to be the cause of [[scrapie]] and other [[degenerative disease]]s of the central [[nervous system]]; it was thought to consist of [[nucleic acid]]s in a protective coat of host cell [[protein]]s.  The hypothesis was never widely accepted, and the causative agents responsible for these diseases are now widely accepted to be [[prion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=3044709 | volume=135 | title=Genetic aspects of unconventional virus infections: the basis of the virino hypothesis. | year=1988 | journal=Ciba Found Symp | pages=63–83 | doi=10.1002/9780470513613.ch5 | author=Dickinson AG, Outram GW}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2016}}

==Origin of the concept==
The virino was described partially to protect the [[central dogma of molecular biology]], which was threatened by the existence of a series of degenerative neurological TSE diseases including [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease|CJD]], scrapie in sheep, and [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] in cattle.{{original research inline|date=July 2015}}  The central dogma states that nucleic acids act as the information carriers, and [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] make proteins.  Proteins alone cannot make DNA.  However, studies searching for the transmission agent of scrapie and other TSEs have failed to culture [[bacteria]], and tests attacking nucleic acids strands have little effect on the infectivity of TSE solutions.  These failures largely rule out a [[virus]] as the infective agent.  Experiments using [[electron]] beams designed to disrupt large [[molecule]]s have been performed to investigate the size of the agent show that it is very small: much smaller than the smallest known virus.

The virino also has the benefit of explaining the traits of TSEs which resemble nucleic acids: for example, their occurrence in strains, which positively indicates the TSE agent is information carrying,{{dubious|date=July 2015}} and not merely a [[toxin]].

==History of description==
In 1971, [[Dickinson, AG]] and [[Meikle, VM]] provided a hypothesis for the replication of the scrapie agent.  This hypothesis was based on the discovery of a single autosomal [[gene]] controlling the scrapie incubation period in [[mouse|mice]] and on observations about strains of the scrapie agent.  They dubbed the gene '''''sinc''''' for '''s'''crapie '''inc'''ubator.  This hypothesis proposed that the gene products of each sinc [[allele]] contributed to a multimeric protein structure, which then formed a 'replication site' for the scrapie agent. The replication of the agent would depend on how the particular strain interacted with the replication site and of what the site was composed.  The fact that different strains of scrapie were known had suggested the agent was similar to conventional viruses in that it carried a [[genome]] composed of nucleic acids.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Thus, variants could arise during [[Incubation period|incubation]], giving rise to new strains. No host-encoded properties were found to determine scrapie agent strain differences. This was thought to prove that the genome of the agent could vary independently and, although replicated by normal host mechanisms, was not coded by the host. The term 'virino' was coined to reflect the small size, [[immunology|immunological neutrality]], and virus-like nature of the infectious particles.

Thus, in the nucleotide model proposed by Dickinson, AG, and [[George W. Outram|Outram, GW]] in 1979, the [[biological life cycle|lifecycle]] of the scrapie agent included a stage where the genome was bound to host protein, probably a multimeric protein complex (now commonly known as a [[prion]]), derived from the ''sinc'' gene. Recalling [[Enrico Fermi]]'s word play on a neutron-like particle, Outram coined the term 'virino' to describe a small virus.  In the virino model, the host protein protects the scrapie agent nucleic acids from degradation and prevents the host from raising an [[immune response]], since the protein/nucleic acid complex is seen as a legitimate part of the host. However, the presumed scrapie-associated nucleic acid has not been identified, and physical or chemical evidence for its presence is lacking.

[[Stanley B. Prusiner]] also discovered a genetic control which he dubbed '''prii''', for '''pri'''on '''i'''ncubator.  This discovery was later shown to be interchangeable with ''sinc''.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

'''William King''' [[Fellow of the Geological Society|FGS]] (1834? - ?) was the son of the Irish geologist [[William King (geologist)|William King]] who also became a geologist and worked in India with the [[Geological Survey of India|Geological Survey of India,]] serving as its director from 1887 to 1894.

King studied civil engineering at [[Queen's College, Galway|Queen's College]], Galway and at Queen's University before joining the Geological Survey of India on 4th March 1857. His first work was in southern India with [[Henry Francis Blanford|H.F.Blanford]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2348">In [[psychology]], [[game theory]], [[statistics]], and [[machine learning]], '''win–stay, lose–switch''' (also '''win–stay, lose–shift''') is a [[heuristic]] learning strategy used to model learning in decision situations.  It was first invented as an improvement over randomization in [[bandit problem]]s.&lt;ref name="Robbins"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robbins |first=H. |year=1952 |title=Some aspects of the sequential design of experiments |journal=Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society |volume=58 |pages=527–535 |doi=10.1090/s0002-9904-1952-09620-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was later applied to the [[prisoner's dilemma]] in order to model the [[evolutionary game theory|evolution]] of [[altruism]].&lt;ref name="Nowak"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nowak |first=M. |first2=K. |last2=Sigmund |date=July 1, 1993 |title=A strategy of win-stay, lose-shift that outperforms tit-for-tat in the Prisoner’s Dilemma game |journal=Nature |volume=364 |pages=56–58 |doi=10.1038/364056a0 |pmid=8316296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The learning rule bases its decision only on the outcome of the previous play.  Outcomes are divided into successes (wins) and failures (losses).  If the play on the previous round resulted in a success, then the agent plays the same strategy on the next round.  Alternatively, if the play resulted in a failure the agent switches to another action.

A large-scale empirical study of players of the game [[rock, paper, scissors]] shows that a variation of this strategy is adopted by real-world players of the game, instead of the [[Nash equilibrium]] strategy of choosing entirely at random between the three options.&lt;ref name="bbc.27228416"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-27228416 |title=How to win at rock-paper-scissors |first=James |last=Morgan |work=BBC News |date=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="arxiv.5199"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wang |first=Zhijian |last2=Xu |first2=Bin |last3=Zhou |first3=Hai-Jun |title=Social cycling and conditional responses in the Rock-Paper-Scissors game |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=4 |pages=5830 |doi=10.1038/srep05830 |date=July 25, 2014 |pmid=25060115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
