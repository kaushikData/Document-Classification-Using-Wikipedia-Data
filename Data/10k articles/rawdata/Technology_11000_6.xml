[[File:GEM corn.jpg|thumb|right|Unusual strains of [[maize]] are collected to increase the [[crop diversity]] when selectively breeding domestic corn.]]

'''Agricultural biodiversity''' is a sub-set of general [[biodiversity]]. The [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD)]] defines it as

''Agricultural biodiversity is a broad term that includes all components of biological diversity of relevance to food and agriculture, and all components of biological diversity that constitute the agricultural ecosystems, also named agro-ecosystems: the variety and variability of animals, plants and micro-organisms, at the genetic, species and ecosystem levels, which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agro-ecosystem, its structure and processes'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbd.int/decision/cop/default.shtml?id=7147|title=CBD / COP 5 Decision V/5|last=|first=|date=|website=|accessdate=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It includes all forms of life directly relevant to [[agriculture]]: rare [[seed]] varieties and [[animal breed]]s (farm biodiversity), but also many other organisms such as [[soil fauna]], [[Weed|weeds]], pests, predators, and all of the native plants and animals (wild biodiversity) existing on and flowing through the farm.  It also includes diversity of ecosystems.  Agricultural biodiversity is essential to cope with the predicted impacts of [[climate change]], not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frison | first1 = E.A. | last2 = Cherfas | first2 = J. | last3 = Hodgkin | first3 = T. | year = 2011 | title = Agricultural Biodiversity Is Essential for a Sustainable Improvement in Food and Nutrition Security | url = http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/agricultural-biodiversity-is-essential-for-a-sustainable-improvement-in-food-and-nutrition-security | journal = Sustainability | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 238–253 | doi=10.3390/su3010238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agricultural biodiversity is the basis of our agricultural [[food chain]], developed and safeguarded by farmers, livestock breeders, forest workers, fishermen and indigenous peoples throughout the world.  The use of agricultural biodiversity (as opposed to non diverse production methods) can contribute to [[food security]], nutrition security and livelihood security.

==Scope==
Although the term ''agricultural biodiversity'' is relatively new - it has come into wide use in recent years as evidenced by bibliographic references - the concept itself is quite old. It is the result of the careful [[Selection (biology)|selection]] and inventive developments of farmers, herders and fishers over millennia. Agricultural biodiversity is a vital sub-set of [[biodiversity]]. It is a use of life, i.e. ancillary biotechnologies, by Mankind whose food and livelihood security depend on the sustained management of those diverse biological resources that are important for food and [[agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1996). Global Plan of Action for the Conservation and Sustainable Utilization of Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPS/GpaEN/gpatoc.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920040427/http://www.fao.org/ag/AGP/AGPS/GpaEN/gpatoc.htm |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As for everything, agricultural biodiversity can be used, not used, misused and even abused. Agricultural biodiversity includes:

*Domesticated [[agriculture|crop]] and 'wild' [[plant]]s (called: [[crop wild relative]]s), including woody perennials (see: [[forest genetic resources]]) and [[aquatic plant]]s (used for food and other natural resources based products), domestic and wild [[animal]]s (used for food, fibre, milk, hides, furs, power, organic fertilizer), fish and other aquatic animals, within field, [[forest]], [[rangeland]] and aquatic ecosystems
*Domesticated livestock species and their wild relatives
*Non-harvested species within production [[agroecosystem]]s that support food provision, including soil micro-biota, [[pollinator]]s and so on
*Non-harvested species in the wider environment that support food production [[agroecosystem]]s (agricultural, pastoral, forest and aquatic ecosystems)

However, agricultural biodiversity, sometimes called Agrobiodiversity, "''encompasses the variety and variability of animals, plants and [[microorganism|micro-organisms]] which are necessary to sustain key functions of the agroecosystem, its structure and processes for, and in support of, food production and [[food security]]''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/sd/EPdirect/EPre0080.htm FAO : SD Dimensions : Environment : Environmental conventions and agreements&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213233609/http://www.fao.org/sd/EPdirect/EPre0080.htm |date=December 13, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It further "''comprises genetic, population, species, community, ecosystem, and landscape components and human interactions with all these.''"&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, L., Bawa, K.,
Pascual, U., and Perrings, C. (2005).agroBIODIVERSITY: A new science agenda for biodiversity in support of sustainable agroecosystems. DIVERSITAS Report N°4. 40 pp. {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most attention in this field is given to crop varieties and to crop wild relatives. Cultivated varieties can be broadly classified into “modern varieties” and “farmer's or traditional varieties”. Modern varieties are the outcome of formal breeding and are often characterized as '[[High-yielding variety|high yielding]]'. For example, the short straw wheat and rice varieties of the [[Green Revolution]]. In contrast, farmer's varieties (also known as [[landrace]]s) are the product of (breeding and) selection carried out by farmers. Together, these varieties represent high levels of genetic diversity and are therefore the focus of most crop genetic resources conservation efforts.

Aquatic diversity is also an important component of agricultural biodiversity. The [[conservation biology|conservation]] and [[sustainable]] use of local aquatic ecosystems, ponds, rivers, coastal commons by artisanal fisherfolk and smallholder farmers is important to the survival of both humans and the environment. Since aquatic organisms, including fish, provide much of our food supply as well as underpinning the income of coastal peoples, it is critical that fisherfolk and smallholder farmers have genetic reserves and sustainable ecosystems to draw upon as [[aquaculture]] and marine fisheries management continue to evolve.

==Genetic erosion in agricultural and livestock biodiversity==

[[Genetic erosion]] in [[agricultural]] and [[livestock]] biodiversity is the loss of genetic diversity, including the loss of individual genes, and the loss of particular combinations of genes (or gene complexes) such as those manifested in locally adapted [[landraces]] or breeds. The term genetic erosion is sometimes used in a narrow sense, such as for the loss of alleles or genes, as well as more broadly, referring to the loss of varieties or even species. The major driving forces behind genetic erosion in crops are: variety replacement, land clearing, [[overexploitation]] of species, population pressure, [[environmental degradation]], [[overgrazing]], policy and changing agricultural systems.&lt;ref&gt;FAO, (1997). The State of the World's Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FAOINFO/AGRICULT/AGP/AGPS/Pgrfa/pdf/swrfull.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061027225556/http://www.fao.org/WAICENT/FaoInfo/Agricult/AGP/AGPS/pgrfa/pdf/SWRFULL.PDF |archivedate=2006-10-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main factor, however, is the replacement of local varieties by high yielding or exotic varieties or species. A large number of varieties can also often be dramatically reduced when commercial varieties (including [[Genetically Modified Organism|GMO]]s) are introduced into traditional farming systems. Many researchers believe that the main problem related to agro-ecosystem management is the general tendency towards genetic and ecological uniformity imposed by the development of modern agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gao | first1 = L.Z. | year = 2003 | title = The conservation of rice biodiversity in China: significance, genetic erosion, ethnobotany and prospect | url = | journal = Genetic Resources and Crop Evolution | volume = 50 | issue = | pages = 17–32 | doi=10.1023/a:1022933230689}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guarino, L., (1995). Assessing the threat of genetic erosion. In: Collecting Plant Genetic Diversity: Technical Guidelines (eds. Guarino L, Rao VR, Reid R) pp. 67-74. CAB International, Wallingford.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pressures for that ecological uniformity on farmers and breeders is caused by the food industry demand for more and more raw materials consistency.

In the case of [[Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]], major causes of genetic erosion are reported to include indiscriminate cross-breeding, increased use of exotic breeds, weak policies and institutions in animal genetic resources management, neglect of certain breeds because of a lack of profitability or competitiveness,  the intensification of production systems, the effects of diseases and disease management, loss of pastures or other elements of the production environment, and poor control of inbreeding.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015. The Second Report on the State of the World's Animal Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. Rome.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetic vulnerability==
In [[plant breeding]], a population of plants is considered genetically vulnerable if there is little 
genetic diversity within the population, and this lack of diversity makes the population as a whole particularly vulnerable to disease, pests, or other factors. The problem of genetic vulnerability often arises with modern crop varieties, which are uniform by design.&lt;ref&gt;Virchow, Detlef. ''Conservation of genetic resources: Costs and implications for a sustainable utilization of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture'' Springer, 1999. p22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plantbreeding.coe.uga.edu/index.php?title=7._Genetic_Resources_and_Genetic_Diversity|title=Genetic Resources and Genetic Diversity |author =Eric Elsner |accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the consequences of genetic vulnerability occurred in 1970 when [[Southern corn leaf blight|corn blight]] struck the US corn belt, destroying 15% of the harvest. A particular plant cell characteristic known as Texas male sterile cytoplasm conferred vulnerability to the blight - a subsequent study by the National Academy of Sciences found that 90% of American maize plants carried this trait.&lt;ref&gt;Kloppenburg, Jack Ralph Jr. "First the Seed: The political economy of plant biotechnology, 2nd edition" University of Wisconsin Press 2004. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change in agricultural biodiversity in human diets==
Since 1961, human diets across the world have become more diverse in the consumption of major commodity staple crops, with a corollary decline in consumption of local or regionally important crops, and thus have become more homogeneous globally.&lt;ref name=Khoury&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Khoury, C.K. |author2=Bjorkman, A.D. |author3=Dempewolf, H. |author4=Ramirez-Villegas, J. |author5=Guarino, L. |author6=Jarvis, A. |author7=Rieseberg, L.H. |author8=Struik, P.C. |title=Increasing homogeneity in global food supplies and the implications for food security |journal=PNAS |date=2014 |volume=111 |issue=11 |pages=4001–4006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1313490111 |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1313490111 |pmid=24591623 |pmc=3964121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The differences between the foods eaten in different countries were reduced by 68% between 1961 and 2009. The modern "global standard"&lt;ref name=Khoury/&gt; diet contains an increasingly large percentage of a relatively small number of major staple commodity crops, which have increased substantially in the share of the total food energy (calories), protein, fat, and food weight that they provide to the world's human population, including [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugar]], [[maize]], [[soybean]] (by +284%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[palm oil]] (by +173%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), and [[sunflower]] (by +246%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;). Whereas nations used to consume greater proportions of locally or regionally important crops, wheat has become a staple in over 97% of countries, with the other global staples showing similar dominance worldwide. Other crops have declined sharply over the same period, including [[rye]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[sweet potato]] (by -45%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[cassava]] (by -38%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;), [[coconut]], [[sorghum]] (by -52%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;) and [[millet]]s (by -45%&lt;ref name=Kinver/&gt;).&lt;ref name=Khoury/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kinver&gt;{{cite web |last1=Kinver |first1=Mark |title=Crop diversity decline 'threatens food security' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-26382067|publisher=BBC |accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SciAm&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fischetti |first1=Mark |title=Diets around the world are becoming more similar |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diets-around-the-world-are-becoming-more-similar/|publisher=Scientific American |accessdate=13 June 2016 |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human dependency==
Agricultural biodiversity is not only the result of human activity but human life is dependent on it not just for the immediate provision of food and other natural resources based goods, but for the maintenance of areas of land and waters that will sustain production and maintain agroecosystems and the wider biological and environmental services ([[biosphere]]).

Agricultural Biodiversity provides:

* [[Sustainable production]] of food and other agricultural products emphasising both strengthening [[sustainability]] in production systems at all levels of intensity and improving the conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the diversity of all genetic resources for food and agriculture, especially plant and animal genetic resources, in all types of production systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Thrupp | first1 = L. A. | year = 2000 | title = Linking agricultural biodiversity and food security: the valuable role of agrobiodiversity for sustainable agriculture | url = http://users.unimi.it/agroecol/pdf/coop_int/bocchi/linking_agricultural_biodiversity.pdf | format = PDF | journal = International Affairs | volume = 76 | issue = 2| pages = 265–281 | doi = 10.1111/1468-2346.00133 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Biological or life support to production emphasising conservation, sustainable use and enhancement of the biological resources that support sustainable production systems, particularly [[soil biota]], [[pollinator]]s and predators
* Ecological and [[social services]] provided by agro-ecosystems such as landscape and [[wildlife protection]], [[soil protection]] and health (fertility, structure and function), [[water cycle]] and [[water quality]], [[air quality]], [[carbon sequestration|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sequestration]], etc.

The general trend noticed by the analysis of biodiversity present in different cropping systems (e.g., [[industrial agriculture]] and [[organic farming]]) was that a greater the diversity of crops (temporally and spacially) resulted in a greater overall biodiversity of the [[agroecosystem]], though this is not always the case. A meta-analysis of studies comparing biodiversity noted that, when compared to organic cropping systems, conventional systems had significantly lower species richness and abundance (30% greater richness and 50% greater abundance in organic systems, on average), though 16% of studies did find a greater level of species richness in conventional systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bengtsoon | first1 = J. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2005 | title = The effects of organic agriculture on biodiversity and abundance: a metaanalysis | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01005.x | journal = Journal of Applied Ecology | volume = 42 | issue = | pages = 261–269 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that cropping systems that required heavy use of chemical amendments (e.g., the widespread broadcasting of pesticides and [[glyphosate]], a practice ubiquitously found throughout the United States and Canada) had significantly greater levels of pollination deficits, whereas organic fields of the same crop (Canola) witnessed no pollination deficits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Morandin | first1 = Lora A. | last2 = Winston | first2 = Mark L. | year = 2005 | title = WILD BEE ABUNDANCE AND SEED PRODUCTION IN CONVENTIONAL, ORGANIC, AND GENETICALLY MODIFIED CANOLA | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 871–881 | doi=10.1890/03-5271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other cropping systems like [[permaculture]] have undergone little study to determine relative levels of biodiversity compared to other cropping systems, but because they continue to reinforce the goals of increasing overall crop [[biodiversity]], it can be extrapolated that an even greater level of biodiversity would be observed.

==Agroecosystems vs natural ecosystems==
Agricultural biodiversity has spatial, temporal and scale dimensions especially at agroecosystem levels. These [[agroecosystem]]s - ecosystems that are used for agriculture - are determined by three sets of factors: the genetic resources ([[biodiversity]]), the physical [[natural environment|environment]] and the human management practices. There are not many ecosystems in the world that are "natural" in the sense of having escaped human influence. Most ecosystems have been to some extent modified or cultivated by human activity for the production of food and income and for livelihood security. However, most agricultural areas can be returned to their [[natural landscape]] after subsequent generations.

'''ApprenNet''' is a Philadelphia-based educational technology [[startup company]] founded in 2011 by Emily Foote and [[Drexel University School of Law]] Professor Karl Okamoto. The company provides apprenticeship-like job experiences online.&lt;ref name=McBride&gt;{{cite news|last1=McBride|first1=Dara|title=Drexel law professor creates a virtual venue for getting real-world experience|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-08-14/news/33183315_1_law-school-users-new-program|accessdate=19 May 2015|website=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AppreNet's first release was LawMeets, an online experience similar to a [[moot court]] competition.&lt;ref name=ReyesJuliana&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Juliana|title=ApprenNet: online law education startup to build open web course on M&amp;A with $500k from National Science Foundation|url=http://technical.ly/philly/2012/07/26/apprennet-online-law-education-startup-to-build-open-web-course-on-ma-with-500k-from-national-science-foundation/|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Technically Philly|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;  With LawMeets, students enact their response to a legal problem, and can not only then review their own performance, but also receive feedback, including critiques by experts.&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonough|first1=Molly|title=Drexel Law Prof to Use $500K Grant to Expand LawMeets, an Online Lawyering Skills Platform|url=http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/drexel_law_prof_to_use_500k_grant_to_expand_lawmeets_an_online_lawyering/|accessdate=19 May 2015|agency=American Bar Association|publisher=ABA Journal|date=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''[[ABA Journal|Journal of the American Bar Association]]'', LawMeets "quickly [became] a very big deal."&lt;ref name=Carter&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Terry|title=You know about moot court—but Karl Okamoto wants students to practice moot deals|url=http://www.abajournal.com/legalrebels/article/2013_legal_rebel_profile_karl_okamoto|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=ABA Journal|date=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ApprenNet next added K12Meets, a program enabling teachers to practice their classroom techniques, and created a training program for employees at a Philadelphia restaurant.&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;

In 2013 ApprenNet was one of five [[startup company|startup companies]] selected to participate in the [[University of Pennsylvania]]'s  Education Design Studio Inc. (EDSi), an innovation incubator dedicated to funding and launching education technology companies.&lt;ref name=Schaffhauser&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schaffhauser|first1=Dian|title=U Penn School of Ed Launches Ed Tech Incubator|url=http://campustechnology.com/articles/2013/10/31/u-penn-school-of-ed-launches-education-tech-incubator.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Campus Technology|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;{{cite news|last1=Baker |first1=Brandon |title=ApprenNet Takes Teaching to a Higher Level |url=http://philadelphia.regionsbusiness.com/apprennet-takes-teaching-to-a-higher-level/ |accessdate=20 May 2015 |publisher=Philadelphia Region's Business |date=7 November 2013 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Grants ==

In 2012 the [[National Science Foundation]] awarded Okamoto a $500,000 grant to expand LawMeets' approach to learning in other disciplines.&lt;ref name=McBride/&gt;&lt;ref name=McDonough/&gt;  Okamoto told an interviewer that ApprenNet technology could be applied to many fields, not only training teachers and restaurant employees, but even musical training. "We'll take care of law first," said Okamoto, "and then use it in lots of different places. Why can't we crowdsource violin?"&lt;ref name=Spolan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Spolan|first1=Sue|title=Transforming the law school experience with ApprenNet out of Drexel|url=http://www.flyingkitemedia.com/innovationnews/apprennet0320.aspx|accessdate=19 May 2015|publisher=Flying Kite Media|date=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, after ApprenNet hired [[Columbia Business School]] graduate [[Rachel Jacobs]] as CEO, the start-up had received more than a million dollars in Small Business Innovation Research grants.&lt;ref name=Reyes&gt;{{cite news|last1=Reyes|first1=Juliana|url=http://technical.ly/philly/2015/04/06/apprennet-rachel-jacobs/|title=ApprenNet just hired a new CEO.

==Merger==

Following Jacobs's death in May 2015, ApprenNet merged with Handsfree Learning of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://technical.ly/philly/2015/07/23/apprennet-merges-sf-edtech-startup-philly-office-stay/|title=ApprenNet merges with SF edtech startup, but Philly office is here to stay - Technical.ly Philly|date=2015-07-23|work=Technical.ly Philly|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BlumenthalMerge&gt;{{cite news|last1=Blumenthal|first1=Jeff|title=Local tech firm that lost CEO in Amtrak crash merges with California firm|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/philadelphia/news/2015/07/22/appernet-rachel-jacobs-amtrak-merge-handsfree.html|accessdate=27 July 2015|publisher=Philadelphia Business Journal|date=22 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, ApprenNet changed its name to [https://www.practice.xyz/ Practice] and announced a $4 million Series A fundraising round. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-06-08-video-learning-platform-apprennet-gets-a-name-change-and-a-4m-series-a&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Automate This: How Algorithms Came to Rule Our World''''' is a book written by Christopher Steiner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chrissteiner.com/ |title=Christopher Steiner |publisher=Chrissteiner.com |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214110417/http://www.chrissteiner.com/ |archivedate=2014-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and published by [[Penguin Group]]. Steiner begins his study of algorithms on Wall Street in the 1980s &lt;ref name=Bloomberg2012-09-06&gt;{{cite web|last=Vance |first=Ashlee |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-06/book-review-automate-this-by-christopher-steiner#p1 |title=Book Review: 'Automate This,' by Christopher Steiner |work=[[Bloomberg BusinessWeek]] |date=2012-09-06 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109145459/http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-09-06/book-review-automate-this-by-christopher-steiner |archivedate=2014-01-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also provides examples from other industries.  For example, he explains the history of [[Pandora Radio]] and the use of algorithms in music identification.  He expresses concern that such use of algorithms may lead to the homogenization of music over time.&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;{{cite web|last=Morozov |first=Evgeny |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443686004577633491013088640 |title=Book Review: Automate This |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=2012-09-20 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521095137/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443686004577633491013088640.html |archivedate=2013-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Steiner also discusses the algorithms that eLoyalty (now owned by [[Mattersight Corporation]] following divestiture of the technology) was created by dissecting 2 million speech patterns and can now identify a caller's personality style and direct the caller with a compatible customer support representative.&lt;ref name=Fortune&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/tag/automate-this/ |title=Automate This - FORTUNE Features |publisher=CNN |date=2012-08-24 |accessdate=2013-05-17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105010743/http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/tag/automate-this/ |archivedate=2013-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steiner's book shares both the warning and the opportunity that algorithms bring to just about every industry in the world, and the pros and cons of the societal impact of automation (e.g. impact on employment).&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2012-09-06/&gt;&lt;ref name=WSJ/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune/&gt;

'''Bomb disposal''' is the process by which hazardous explosive devices are rendered safe. ''Bomb disposal'' is an all-encompassing term to describe the separate, but interrelated functions in the military fields of '''explosive ordnance disposal''' ('''EOD''') and '''improvised explosive device disposal''' ('''IEDD'''), and the [[public safety]] roles of '''public safety bomb disposal '''('''PSBD''') and the '''bomb squad'''.

"Bomb disposal" does not encompass the [[Environmental remediation|remediation of soils polluted with explosive materials]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==History==
The first professional civilian bomb squad was established by Sir [[Vivian Dering Majendie]].&lt;ref name="Brodie"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtGDHunq9zEC|title=Bombs and Bombings: A Handbook to Protection, Security, Disposal, and Investigation for Industry, Police and Fire Departments|author=Thomas G. Brodie|year=2005|publisher=Charles C Thomas Publisher|page=102}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a [[Major]] in the [[Royal Artillery]], Majendie investigated an explosion on 2 October 1874 in the [[Regent's Canal]], when the [[barge]] 'Tilbury', carrying six barrels of petroleum and five tons of gunpowder, blew up, killing the crew and destroying Macclesfield Bridge and cages at nearby [[London Zoo]].

In 1875, he framed The Explosives [[Bill (proposed law)|Act]], the first modern legislation for explosives control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/26639/pages/3740 2 July 1895]&lt;/ref&gt; He also pioneered many bomb disposal techniques, including remote methods for the handling and dismantling of explosives.&lt;ref name="Brodie" /&gt; His advice during the [[Fenian dynamite campaign]] of 1881–85&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200508080038 Armitage, Tom 'Bombing trains is nothing new - it is what 19th-century anarchists did' - The ''[[New Statesman]]'' 8 August 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; was officially recognised as having contributed to the saving of lives. After [[London Victoria station|Victoria Station]] was bombed on 26 February 1884 he defused a bomb with a [[clockwork]] mechanism which might have gone off at any moment.&lt;ref name=Obit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP18980625.2.74&amp;zto=1|title=Death Of A Distinguished Officer|date=25 June 1898|publisher=|pages=3|via=Papers Past}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York City Police Department]] established its first bomb squad in 1903. Known as the "Italian Squad", its primary mission was to deal with [[dynamite]] bombs used by the [[Italian-American Mafia|Mafia]] to intimidate immigrant Italian merchants and residents. It would later be known as the "Anarchist Squad" and the "Radical Squad".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kareem Fahim|title=Bomb Squad Has Hard-Won Expertise |work=New York Times |date=2010-05-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/03/nyregion/03squad.html?scp=2&amp;sq=bomb%20squad&amp;st=Search|accessdate=2010-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWI: Military bomb disposal units===
[[File:1918 German UXOs2.JPG|thumb|A British NCO prepares to dispose of an unexploded bomb, during the First World War.]]
Bomb Disposal became a formalized practice in the [[First World War]]. The swift mass production of munitions led to many manufacturing defects, and a large proportion of shells fired by both sides were found to be "duds".&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;{{cite web |author=David Payne |title=Duds On The Western Front In The Great War |publisher=The Western Front Association |year= |work=westernfrontassociation.com |url=http://www.westernfront.co.uk/thegreatwar/articles/research/dudswestern.htm |accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were hazardous to attacker and defender alike.  In response, the British dedicated a section of Ordnance Examiners from the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]] to handle the growing problem.

In 1918, the Germans developed [[delayed-action fuze]]s that would later develop into more sophisticated versions during the 1930s, as [[Nazi Germany]] began its secret course of arms development. These tests led to the development of UXBs ([[unexploded bombs]]), pioneered by Herbert Ruehlemann of [[Rheinmetall]], and first employed during the [[Spanish Civil War]] of 1936–37. Such delayed-action bombs provoked terror in the civilian population because of the uncertainty of time, and also complicated the task of disarming them. The Germans saw that unexploded bombs caused far more chaos and disruption than bombs that exploded immediately. This caused them to increase their usage of delayed-action bombs in [[World War II]].

Initially there were no specialized tools, training, or core knowledge available, and as Ammunition Technicians learned how to safely neutralize one variant of munition, the enemy would add or change parts to make neutralization efforts more hazardous. This trend of cat-and-mouse extends even to the present day, and the various techniques used to disarm munitions are not publicized.

===WWII: Modern techniques===
[[File:Bomb disposal 1940.jpg|thumb|left|A bomb disposal team in 1940.]]

Modern EOD Technicians across the world can trace their heritage to [[the Blitz]], when the United Kingdom's cities were subjected to extensive bombing raids by [[Nazi Germany]].  In addition to conventional [[airstrike|air raids]], [[unexploded ordnance|unexploded bombs]] (UXBs) took their toll on population and morale, paralyzing vital services and communications. Bombs fitted with delayed-action [[fuze]]s provoked fear and uncertainty in the civilian population.

The first UXBs were encountered in the autumn of 1939 before the Blitz and were for the most part easily dealt with, mostly by [[Royal Air Force]] or [[Air Raid Precautions]] personnel. In the spring of 1940, when the [[Phony War]] ended, the British realized that they were going to need professionals in numbers to deal with the coming problem. 25 sections were authorized for the Royal Engineers in May 1940, another 109 in June, and 220 by August. Organization was needed, and as the Blitz began, 25 "Bomb Disposal Companies" were created between August 1940 and January 1941. Each company had ten sections, each section having a bomb disposal officer and 14 other ranks to assist. Six companies were deployed in London by January 1941.

The problem of UXBs was further complicated when Royal Engineer bomb disposal personnel began to encounter munitions fitted with [[anti-handling device]]s e.g. the [[Luftwaffe]]'s ZUS40 [[Anti-handling device|anti-removal]] bomb [[fuze]] of 1940. Bomb fuzes incorporating anti-handling devices were specifically designed to kill bomb disposal personnel. Scientists and technical staff responded by devising methods and equipment to render them safe, including the work of [[Eric Moxey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/205049825|title=THE WORK OF RAF BOMB DISPOSAL SQUADS IN THE UK AND GERMANY DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR.|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States War Department]] felt the British Bomb Disposal experience could be a valuable asset, based on reports from [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] observers at RAF Melksham in [[Wiltshire, England]] in 1940. The next year, the [[Office of Civilian Defense]] (OCD) and War Department both sponsored a bomb disposal program. After the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], the British sent instructors to [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], where the U.S. Army would inaugurate a formal bomb disposal school under the [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance Corps]]. Col. Thomas J. Kane became the U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal School commandant, and later served as ETO Director of Bomb Disposal under [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref&gt;Leatherwood, Jeffrey M. (2012). ''[[Nine From Aberdeen]]: U.S. Army Ordnance Bomb Disposal in World War II''. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. {{ISBN|978-1-4438-3786-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1941, British colleagues helped establish the Naval Mine Disposal School at the [[Washington Navy Yard|Naval Gun Factory]], [[Washington, D.C.]] Not to be outdone, the U.S. Navy, under the command of Lt. [[Draper L. Kauffman]] (who would go on to found the [[Underwater Demolition Team]]s{{spaced ndash}} better known as UDTs or the U.S. Navy Frogmen), created the Naval Bomb Disposal School at University Campus, [[Washington, D.C.]].

The first US Army Bomb Disposal companies were deployed in [[North Africa]] and [[Sicily]], but proved cumbersome and were replaced with mobile seven-man squads in 1943. Wartime errors were rectified in 1947 when Army personnel started attending a new school at [[Indian Head, Maryland]], under U.S. Navy direction. That same year, the forerunner of the EOD Technology Center, the USN Bureau of Naval Weapons, charged with research, development, test, and evaluation of EOD tools, tactics and procedures was born.

===Northern Ireland===
The [[Ammunition Technicians]] of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] (formerly [[RAOC]]) became highly experienced in bomb disposal, after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (PIRA) and other groups. The bombs employed by the PIRA ranged from simple pipe bombs to sophisticated victim-triggered devices and [[infrared]] switches.  The roadside bomb was in use by PIRA from the early 1970s onwards, evolving over time with different types of explosives and triggers. Improvised mortars were also developed by the IRA, usually placed in static vehicles, with self-destruct mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Steve ''3-2-1 Bomb Gone : Fighting Terrorist Bombers in Northern Ireland'', Sutton Publishing 2006 pp. 131–149 {{ISBN|0-7509-4205-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 38-year campaign in Northern Ireland, 23 British ATO bomb disposal specialists were killed in action.&lt;ref&gt;Rayment, Sean  ''Bomb Hunters: In Afghanistan with Britain's Elite Bomb Disposal Unit'' London HarperCollins 2011 p.58 {{ISBN|9780007374786}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A specialist Army unit, [[321 EOD]] Unit (later 321 EOD Company, and now part of [[11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal Regiment RLC]]), was deployed to tackle increased IRA violence and willingness to use bombs against both economic and military targets. The unit's radio call-sign was Felix. Many{{who|date=September 2015}} believe this to be an allusion to the cat with [[Cat#History and mythology|nine lives]] and led to the phrase "Fetch Felix" whenever a suspect device was encountered, which later became the title of the 1981 book ''Fetch Felix''. However, the real reason could be either of two possibilities.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} All units in Northern Ireland had a callsign to be used over the radios. 321 Company, a newly formed unit, didn't have such a callsign, so a young signaller was sent to the OC of 321 Coy. The OC, having lost two technicians that morning, decided on "[[Phoenix (mythology)|Phoenix]]". This was misheard as "Felix" by the signaller and was never changed. The other possible reason is that the callsign for RAOC was "Rickshaw"; however, the 321 EOD felt it needed its own callsign, hence the deliberate choice of "Felix the Cat with nine lives". 321 Coy RAOC (now 321 EOD Sqn RLC) is unique in that it is the most decorated unit (in peace time) in the British Army with over 200 gallantry awards, notably for acts of great bravery during [[Operation Banner]] (1969–2007) in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name="Fetch Felix"&gt;{{cite book |last=Patrick |first=Derrick |year=1981 |title=Fetch Felix: The Fight Against the Ulster Bombers, 1976–1977 |publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-241-10371-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Ammunition Technicians of 11 EOD Regiment RLC were requested by the US Forces commanders to operate in support of the US Marine Corps in clearing the Iraqi oilfields of booby traps and were among the first British service personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 prior to the actual ground invasion.

===Low intensity conflicts===
[[File:3rd Battalion 3rd Marines controlled detonation.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] conducting a controlled detonation of [[improvised explosive device]]s in [[Afghanistan]].]]
The eruption of [[low intensity conflict]]s and [[terrorism]] waves at the beginning of the 21st century caused further development in the techniques and methods of bomb disposal. EOD Operators and Technicians had to adapt to rapidly evolving methods of constructing improvised explosive devices ranging from [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]]-filled [[explosive belts]] to 100&amp;nbsp;kg bombs. Since improvised explosives are generally unreliable and very unstable they pose great risk to the public and especially to the EOD Operator trying to render them safe. Therefore, new methods like greater reliance on remote techniques such as advanced remotely operated vehicles similar to the British [[Wheelbarrow (EOD)|Wheelbarrow]] or [[armored bulldozer]]s evolved. Many nations have developed their own versions such as the [[Caterpillar D7|D7 MCAP]] and the [[Caterpillar D9|armored D9R]].

[[File:US Navy explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) divers.jpg|thumb|left|[[U.S. Navy]] explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) divers.]]
The British Armed Forces have become experts in bomb disposal after many years of dealing with bombs planted by the IRA. These came in many different forms, particularly car bombs rigged to detonate via a variety of manners including command wire and remote trigger. Some of the first personnel sent into Iraq in 2003 were British bomb disposal experts of 11 EOD Regiment [[Royal Logistic Corps|RLC]]. Besides large mine-clearing vehicles such as [[Trojan (vehicle)|the Trojan]], the British Army also uses small remote controlled vehicles such as [[Dragon Runner]] and Chevette.&lt;ref&gt;Frontline Battle Machines with Mike Brewer&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=December 2010|reason=&lt;nowiki&gt;This is not a proper reference citation.

During the [[al-Aqsa Intifada]], Israeli EOD forces have disarmed and detonated thousands of explosive charges, lab bombs and explosive [[ammunition]] (such as rockets). Two Israeli EOD teams gained high reputation for leading the efforts in that area: the Army's [[Israeli Engineering Corps]]' [[Sayeret Yahalom]] and the [[Magav|Israeli Border Guard]] Gaza-area EOD team.

In the [[Iraq War]], the International coalition [[multinational force in Iraq]] forces have faced many bombs on travel routes. Such charges can easily destroy light vehicles such as the [[Humvee]], and large ones can even destroy [[main battle tank]]s. Such charges caused many casualties and along with [[car bomb]]s and [[suicide bomber]]s were a major cause of [[Casualty (person)|casualties]] in Iraq.

In Spain's autonomous [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], where bombings by [[Basque nationalist|Basque separatist]] groups were common during the 1980s and 1990s, there are three corps in charge of bomb disposal: [[Cuerpo Nacional de Policía (Spain)|Policia Nacional]], [[Civil Guard (Spain)|Guardia Civil]], and [[Ertzaintza]]. The Ertzaintza handle general civilian threats, while the Policia Nacional and Guardia Civil maintain capabilities mainly to defend their own assets and personnel. In other parts of the country, the Guardia Civil and Policia Nacional develop their tasks within their own abilities, with the exception of [[Mossos d'Esquadra]] in Catalonia (where the situation is the same as in the Basque Country).

==Fields of operations==

In the United Kingdom, EOD Operators are held within all three Services. Each Service has differing responsibilities for UXO, however they will often work closely on operations.

[[Ammunition Technical Officer]]s and [[Ammunition Technician]]s of the [[Royal Logistic Corps]] deal with many aspects of EOD, including conventional munitions and homemade bombs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/8731.aspx 11 EOD Regiment - British Army Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118050728/http://www.army.mod.uk/rlc/regiments/8731.aspx |date=January 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also trained in [[chemical weapons|chemical]], [[biological weapons|biological]], incendiary, radiological ("[[dirty bomb]]s"), and [[nuclear weapons]]. They provide support to [[Very Important Person (person)|VIP]]s, help civilian authorities with bomb problems, teach personnel from all three services about bomb safety, and a variety of other tasks.

The [[Royal Engineers]] of [[33 Engineer Regiment (EOD)]]  provide EOD expertise for air dropped munitions in peace time and conventional munitions on operations, as well as battle area clearance and High Risk Search in support of improvised explosive device disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5011A2EB-8ADD-4E1D-87EA-E7C40D61B2DA/0/20071218_jdp2_02_U_DCDCIMAPPS.pdf UK Joint Doctrine Publication 2-02 - Joint Service Explosive Ordnance Disposal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608002417/http://www.mod.uk/NR/rdonlyres/5011A2EB-8ADD-4E1D-87EA-E7C40D61B2DA/0/20071218_jdp2_02_U_DCDCIMAPPS.pdf |date=June 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also provide expertise in Advanced IEDD and in the investigation of accidents and incidents involving ammunition and explosives, where they are seen as Subject Matter Experts (SMEs).

Weapons Intelligence is supplied by [[Royal Military Police]], [[Intelligence Corps (United Kingdom)|Intelligence Corps]] and Ammunition Technical Personnel who tap into the CEXC units of the USA.

All prospective Ammunition Technicians attend a gruelling course of instruction at [[Army School of Ammunition|The Army School of Ammunition]] and the [[Felix Centre]], United Kingdom.  The time frame for an RLC Ammunition Technician to complete all necessary courses prior to finally being placed on an EOD team is around 36 months.  Whereas the Engineer EOD training period although shorter in total is spread over a number of years and interspersed with operational experience, RE personnel may be posted to core trades such as carpentry or bridge building within their time as engineers.

[[Royal Air Force]] [[armourers]] from [[No. 5131 (BD) Squadron RAF|5131 (BD) Squadron]] and [[Royal Navy]] [[clearance diver]]s also deploy teams both in the UK and on operations working on both IEDD ([[Improvised Explosive Device]] Disposal) teams as well as the disposal of conventional munitions. Both the RAF and Royal Navy personnel spend their entire service working with and around explosives, and associated sciences. As such are given responsibilities relevant to their roles when it comes to conventional weapons;
* RAF: Any air-dropped munitions (with the exception of [[World War II]] German weapons) and aircraft crash sites.
* Royal Navy: Anything of an explosive nature found below the [[high water mark]] or deemed to be of a naval origin.

===PSBT===
[[Image:Sept05leb img 5.jpg|thumb|right|An [[FBI agent]] in a [[bomb suit]] performing a training mission]]

US EOD covers both on and off base calls in the US unless there is a local PSBT or "Public Safety Bomb Technician" that can handle the bomb - ordnance should only be handled by the EOD experts. Also called a "Hazardous Devices Technician", PSBTs are usually members of a [[Police]] department, although there are teams formed by [[fire department]]s or emergency management agencies.

To be certified, PSBTs must attend the joint U.S. Army-[[FBI]] Hazardous Devices School at [[Redstone Arsenal]], [[Alabama]] which is modeled on the International IEDD Training school at The [[Army School of Ammunition]], known as the [[Felix Centre]]. This school helps them to become knowledgeable in the detection, diagnosis and disposal of hazardous devices. They are further trained to collect evidence in hazardous devices, and present expert witness testimony in [[court]] on bombing cases.

===UXO===
{{Main|Unexploded ordnance}}
Before bombing ranges can be re utilized for other purposes, these ranges must be cleared of all unexploded ordnance. This is usually performed by civilian specialists trained in the field, often with prior military service in explosive ordnance disposal. These technicians use specialized tools for subsurface examination of the sites. When munitions are found, they safely neutralize them and remove them from the site.

=== Other (training, mining, fireworks) ===
In addition to neutralizing munitions or [[bomb]]s, conducting training and presenting evidence, EOD Technicians and Engineers also respond to other problems.

EOD Technicians help dispose old or unstable explosives, such as ones used in [[quarry]]ing, [[mining]], or old/unstable [[firework]]s and [[ammunition]]. They also assist specialist police units, raid and entry teams with boobytrap detection and avoidance, and they help in conducting post-blast investigations.

The EOD technician's training and experience with bombs make them an integral part of any bombing investigation. Another part of an EOD technician's job involves supporting the government intelligence units. This involves searching all places that the high ranking government officers or other protected dignitaries travel, stay or visit.

==Techniques==

Generally, EOD ''[[render safe procedure]]s'' (RSP) are a type of [[tradecraft]] protected from public dissemination in order to limit access and knowledge, depriving the enemy of specific technical procedures used to render safe ordnance or an improvised device. Another reason for keeping tradecraft secret is to hinder the development of new [[anti-handling device]]s by their opponents: if the enemy has thorough knowledge of specific EOD techniques, they can develop [[fuze]] designs which are more resistant to existing render-safe procedures.

Many techniques exist for the making safe of a bomb or munition. Selection of a technique depends on several variables. The greatest variable is the proximity of the munition or device to people or critical facilities. Explosives in remote localities are handled very differently from those in densely populated areas. Contrary to the image portrayed in modern-day movies, the role of the modern Bomb Disposal Operator is to accomplish their task as remotely as possible. Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be reduced.

[[Image:Remotely controlled bomb disposal tool.JPG|thumb|right|[[Wheelbarrow (robot)|Wheelbarrow]] remotely controlled bomb disposal tool]]

[[Ammunition technician|Ammunition technicians]] have many tools for remote operations, one of which is the RCV, or remotely controlled vehicle, also known as the "[[EODWheelbarrow|Wheelbarrow]]". Outfitted with cameras, microphones, and sensors for chemical, biological, or nuclear agents, the Wheelbarrow can help the technician get an excellent idea of what the munition or device is. Many of these [[robot]]s even have hand-like manipulators in case a door needs to be opened, or a munition or bomb requires handling or moving.  The first ever [[EODWheelbarrow|Wheelbarrow]] was conceived by Major Robert John Wilson 'Pat' Patterson RAOC and his team at the Bomb Disposal School, CAD Kineton in 1972 and used by [[ammunition technicians|Ammunition technicians]] in the battle against [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] bombs.

Punsalan attached to the 69th Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Team, Philippine Army, wears the SRS-5 light weight explosive protection suit while uses a long pole and disruptor on a.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Placing a disruption charge while wearing a protective suit]]
Also of great use are items that allow ammunition technicians to remotely diagnose the innards of a munition or bomb. These include devices similar to the [[X-ray]] used by medical personnel, and high-performance sensors that can detect and help interpret sounds, odors, or even images from within the munition or bomb. Once the technicians determine what the munition or device is, and what state it is in, they will formulate a procedure to disarm it. This may include things as simple as replacing safety features, or as difficult as using high-powered explosive-actuated devices to shear, jam, bind, or remove parts of the item's firing train. Preferably, this will be accomplished remotely, but there are still circumstances when a robot won't do, and a technician must put themself at risk by personally going near the bomb. The technician will don a specialized [[bombsuit|protective suit]], using flame and fragmentation-resistant material similar to [[bulletproof vest]]s. Some suits have advanced features such as internal cooling, amplified hearing, and communications back to the control area. This suit is designed to increase the odds of survival for the technician should the munition or bomb function while they are near it.

Rarely, the specifics of a munition or bomb will allow the technician to first remove it from the area. In these cases, a containment vessel is used. Some are shaped like small water tanks, others like large [[sphere]]s. Using remote methods, the technician places the item in the container and retires to an uninhabited area to complete the neutralization. Because of the instability and complexity of modern bombs, this is rarely done. After the munition or bomb has been rendered safe, the technicians will assist in the removal of the remaining parts so the area can be returned to normal. All of this, called a Render Safe Procedure, can take a great deal of time. Because of the construction of devices, a waiting period must be taken to ensure that whatever render-safe method was used worked as intended.

Another technique is Trepanation, in which a bore is cut into the sidewall of a bomb and the explosive contents are extracted through a combination of steam and acid bath liquification of bomb contents.&lt;ref name="Jane's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Van Trepan{TM} Mk 3 explosive trepanning tool for vehicles (United Kingdom), Equipment - EOD weapons|url=http://www.janes.com/articles/Janes-Explosive-Ordnance-Disposal/Van-Trepan-TM-Mk-3-explosive-trepanning-tool-for-vehicles-United-Kingdom.html|work=Jane's Explosive Ordnance Disposal|publisher=Janes.com|accessdate=22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although professional EOD personnel have expert knowledge, skills and equipment, they are not immune to misfortune because of the inherent dangers: in June 2010, construction workers in [[Göttingen]] discovered an Allied 500 kilogram bomb dating from [[World War II]] buried approximately 7 metres below the ground. German EOD experts were notified and attended the scene. Whilst residents living nearby were being evacuated and the EOD personnel were preparing to disarm the bomb, it [[detonated]], killing three of them and injuring 6 others. The dead and injured each had over 20 years of hands-on experience, and had previously rendered safe between 600 and 700 unexploded bombs. The bomb which killed and injured the EOD personnel was of a particularly dangerous type because it was fitted with a delayed-action chemical [[fuze]], which had become highly unstable after over 65 years under ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=International |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,698245,00.html |title=Spiegel.de |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10212890.stm | work=BBC News | title=World War II bomb kills three in Germany | date=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/7795709/Three-dead-as-Second-World-War-bomb-explodes-in-Germany.html |title=Three dead as Second World War bomb explodes in Germany |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/178648/Bomb-kills-German-explosive-experts/ |title=Bomb kills German explosive experts |publisher=Dailyexpress.co.uk |date=2010-06-02 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==EOD equipment==

===Portable X-ray systems===
[[File:EOD training.jpg|thumb|EOD training and material testing. A 105 mm shell is radiographied with battery powered portable X-ray generator and flat panel detector.]]

Portable X-ray systems are used to radiograph the bomb before intervention. The purpose is for example to determine if a chemical charge is present or to check the status of the detonator. High steel thickness require high energy and high power sources.

===Projected water disruptors===
[[Image:US Navy 090114-N-8730P-037 The detonation of a Boot Banger water charge demonstrates its destructive power.jpg|thumb|right|Boot Banger water charge disrupts simulated bomb]]
[[File:Bottler.jpg|thumb|Bottler Lite against a small suspect device]]
Projected water disruptors use a water-projectile [[shaped charge]] to destroy bombs, blasting the device apart and severing any detonating connections faster than any fuse or anti-tampering device on the bomb can react. One example is the BootBanger, deployed under the rear compartment of cars suspected to be carrying bombs.&lt;ref name="BootBangerJanes"&gt;{{Cite web

====Pigstick====
'''Pigstick''' is the British Army term for the waterjet disruptor commonly deployed on the [[wheelbarrow (EOD)|Wheelbarrow]] remotely operated vehicle against IRA bombs in the 1970s. It fires a jet of water driven by a propellent charge to disrupt the [[Electrical network|circuitry]] of a [[bomb]] and disabling it with a low risk of detonation. The modern pigstick is reliable and can be fired many times with minimal maintenance. It is now used worldwide. It is 485&amp;nbsp;mm long and weighs 2.95&amp;nbsp;kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pigstick Disruptor |url=http://www.chemringeod.com/Download.aspx?ResourceId=14270|publisher=Chemring EOD|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is made of hardened steel, and can be mounted on a [[remotely operated vehicle]] (ROV). These factors make it an effective way to render IEDs safe. It is not a panacea however, it can not deal with IEDs packed in hard containers like industrial gas bottles or beer kegs, for instance, and other disruptors have been designed to deal with those and a range of other situations including car bombs.

The name ''pigstick'' is an odd analogy coming from the verb meaning "to hunt the wild boar on horseback with a spear."

The device was developed by the scientists Mike Barker MBE and Peter Hubbard OBE at [[RARDE]] [[Fort Halstead]] in late 1971 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard OBE|first1=Peter|title=the Exploding Kind|publisher=Peter J Hubbard|pages=1 to 6|url=http://www.racheldavid.plus.com/share/The_Exploding_Kind.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; working under great pressure over a period of several weeks after an [[Ammunition Technical Officer|ATO]] lost his life in Northern Ireland attempting to render safe the first IED in the theatre to contain anti-handling devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoeuCAAAQBAJ|title=Operation Banner: The British Army in Northern Ireland 1969–2007|first=Nick Van der|last=Bijl|date=19 October 2009|publisher=Pen and Sword|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2507&amp;dat=19710910&amp;id=j-Y9AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iEgMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2209,1701851|work=The Glasgow Herald |title=Cahill freed after brief stay in Dublin jail|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They started with a prototype equipment designed to disrupt [[limpet mines]] attached to a ship's hull and through a process of many trials and error developed a disruptor that could deal with the crop of IEDs with anti-handling devices prevalent at the time. Barker used the device operationally for the first time in Northern Ireland during a visit there to demonstrate their prototype to [[George Styles]] and his team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard OBE|first1=Peter|title=the Exploding Kind|publisher=Peter J Hubbard|pages=5 |url=http://www.racheldavid.plus.com/share/The_Exploding_Kind.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pigstick prototype was re-engineered by a member of Hubbard's team, Bob White MBE, down from its original 20&amp;nbsp;kg to its current 2.95&amp;nbsp;kg form but its internal ballistic design remained true to the original.

In many of these cases, it can be assumed that the loss of a machine represented the saving of an EOD man's life.|House of Commons Hansard Debates for 21 Oct 1998&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=((Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Commons, Westminster)) |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm199798/cmhansrd/vo981021/debtext/81021-17.htm |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 21 Oct 1998 (pt 17) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=1998-10-21 |accessdate=2013-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===ZEUS===
The [[ZEUS-HLONS (HMMWV Laser Ordnance Neutralization System)]], commonly known as ZEUS, was developed for surface land mines and unexploded ordnance (UXO) neutralization by the U.S. Naval Explosive Ordnance Disposal Technology Division (NAVEODTECHDIV). It uses a moderate-power commercial solid state laser (SSL) and beam control system, integrated onto a Humvee (HMMWV), to clear surface mines, improvised bombs, or unexploded ordnance (UXO) from supply routes and minefields.

===Bomb containment chamber===
[[File:ACFD-Bomb-Disposal-Unit.jpg|thumb|A bomb containment chamber]]
There are a wide range of containment chambers available.  The simplest are sometimes danger suppression vessels that merely contain some of the fragments generated by the explosion. The other end of the spectrum features top-of-the-line gas-tight chambers that can withstand multiple shots while remaining able to contain [[CBRNe|chemical, biological, or radioactive agents]]. Containment chambers of all types may be fitted onto towed trailers, or specialised EOD vehicles.

===EOD suits===
{{Main|Bomb suit}}
There is a long history of IEDD within the UK and protection for this role has evolved over the years. Starting with the Mk1 in 1969, in response to the Maoist Terrorist threat in Hong Kong, through to the Mk 2 in 1974, in response to the IRA threat in Northern Ireland (NI), with further developments of the Mk3 in 1980 to include a new helmet.  The Mk4 EOD Suit, introduced into service in 1993, combines fragmentation and blast protection that is prioritised over the most vulnerable parts of the body (head, face and torso).  The current system, MKV/VI, was introduced in 2004, and was a combined MOD/NP Aerospace project. The only part of the body that has no protection at all is the hands.

'''Chris Andrews''' has been an important figure in the evolution of today's Information Society. He is a pioneer in digital media, electronic publishing, and the Internet. He was the world's first CD-ROM producer, launched the first CD-Recordable system which began the "user generated content" revolution, and has developed new technologies in other areas including live [[webcast]]ing, use of audio and video on the internet, and intellectual property.

Chris is the author of the twice-published book "The Education of a CD-ROM Publisher - An Insiders History of Electronic Publishing." {{ISBN|978-0-9664586-0-2}} &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.infotoday.com/books/EduCDPub.shtml Books {{!}} The Education of a CD-ROM Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris' life story has been featured in the media including profiles on CBS' ''[[60 Minutes]]'' and other international media. In 2001, he began to pursue the restitution of a building in [[Vienna, Austria]] that was taken from his family by the Nazis in World War II. This became a life-changing experience for him, making him an activist in particular in World War II restitution. (See Resources)

Chris also worked at [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[NewsBank]], [[Meridian Data]], and the [[National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences]]. He launched several companies including the webcast software company [[Livecast]], the multimedia publishing company UniDisc, and [[VentureMakers LLC]] - an intellectual property development company.

As of 10th July 2018, [https://codesignal.com/ CodeFights] has been renamed to [https://codesignal.com/ CodeSignal] with additional features as per the company blog.

== History ==
CodeSignal was founded in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#7e22446c7912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-site-helps-outsiders-land-tech-jobs-1479232236|title=New Site Helps Outsiders Land Tech Jobs|last=Simons|first=John|date=2016-11-16|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Tigran Sloyan, Aram Shatakhtsyan, and Felix Desroches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2c631d487912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea for CodeSignal was developed from Sloyan and Shatakhtsyan’s experiences of participating in international coding and mathematics competitions including the International Olympiad in Informatics and Mathematics. Sloyan even used this concept of a game-based teaching platform for his Computer Science master’s thesis at MIT, but abandoned the idea to work in established Silicon Valley companies including Oracle, Google, and Premise (backed by Google Ventures).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/premise|title=Premise Data {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal first launched with challenges only for JavaScript and were based on “code battles”, a 3-minute person versus person competition to determine who can more quickly and accurately debug existing code.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9?r=US&amp;IR=T|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before each game, players can either choose to race against the clock, or let CodeSignal automatically match them with other online players to complete the challenge head-to-head. Successful challengers level up and earn badges towards language fluency. Even though players are first presented with short challenges that take only a few minutes to solve, each challenge increases in difficulty and the amount of time given to solve the problem.

Soon, CodeSignal expanded to support Java, C++ and Python challenges. Today, CodeSignal supports 38 programming languages and has also expanded to include more types of challenges, interview practice, and access to companies with open software engineering positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://qz.com/806782/a-startup-is-gaming-bias-in-tech-recruitment-by-organizing-coding-matches/|title=CodeFights aims to remove hiring bias in Silicon Valley with Code Arcade and competitions against coding bots — Quartz|last=Bhattacharya|first=Ananya|website=qz.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though CodeSignal launched as a platform to help users learn and improve their coding skills, CodeSignal has also taken on changing recruiting all together. CodeFight’s main goal is to help programmers get hired based on their skills, not their resume.

== CodeSignal for Developers ==
CodeSignal originally launched as an online community where developers can practice their skills through a series of Head-to-Head coding challenges,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/01/09/startups-are-making-the-rejection-letter-a-thing-of-the-past/|title=Startups are making the rejection letter a thing of the past – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which appealed to competitive programmers.&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-thinks-competitive-programming-can-be-a-spectator-sport-2015-9|title=This startup thinks competitive programming could be more popular than college football|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal was to help developers build their coding skills by solving and discussing programming challenges with other developers on the platform.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3057218/you-might-apply-for-your-next-job-by-playing-a-mobile-game|title=You Might Apply For Your Next Job By Playing A Mobile Game|date=2016-02-29|work=Fast Company|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first 2 years, the CodeSignal platform had 6 distinct game modes: Interview Practice, Company Bots, Arcade, Tournaments, Head-to-Head, and Challenges; all geared towards helping developers build skills and getting prepared for technical real-world jobs. In all of these modes, the CodeSignal system runs a user’s solution to a coding challenge against tests, and the solution is only accepted when all test cases are satisfied.&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; All CodeFight modes for developers are free of charge.

As of August 2017, CodeSignal has reported that it had nearly 1 million developers using CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Interview Practice ===
Interview Practice is the newest and most popular mode on CodeSignal for Developers.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/22/codefights-new-practice-mode-helps-developers-prepare-for-job-interviews/|title=CodeFights launches a new practice mode to help developers prepare for job interviews – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mode first launched in beta in February 2017, and then launched the expanded the version in June 2017.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt; The Interview Practice game mode is specifically targeted towards job seekers who are preparing for engineering technical interviews. Developers can use Interview Practice to solve real interview questions, master key computer science topics, and learn by reviewing solutions provided within the community.

=== Company Bots ===
Launched in November 2015, Company Bots&lt;ref name="Fast Company"/&gt; are curated challenges that simulate real-world problems that companies are facing. This type of assessment is based on the premise that solving on-the-job coding challenges can allow companies to better assess the skills of a potential candidate.

During a Company Bot challenge, participants are faced with multiple rounds of challenges of varying difficulty. Both the bot and the challenger are attempting to solve the coding challenge side by side. Each participant gains points based on speed and accuracy. After the participant submits their solution, it is evaluated and only accepted if it passes all the tests. Only after winning the Bot challenge, can the participant be provided with the opportunity to submit their information to the recruiter of the company running the Company Bot challenge.

CodeSignal launched Company Bots with a partnership with [[Uber]] to create Uberbot, a Uber-branded gaming challenge&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2015/11/05/uber-teams-with-codefights-to-create-uberbot-a-game-to-test-coding-skills-of-potential-hires/|title=Uber teams with CodeFights to create UberBot, a game to test coding skills of potential hires|date=2015-11-05|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; on CodeSignal that would help Uber find and evaluate the programming skills of candidates. Candidates who attempted the Uberbot coding game are challenged to solve real-world problems facing Uber’s engineering team, such as finding the most optimal route for a Uber ride, or the most efficient method of matching riders for an [[uberPOOL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://eng.uber.com/uberbot/|title=Building the #UberBot on CodeFights for Uber Engineering {{!}} Uber Engineering Blog|date=2015-10-20|work=Uber Engineering Blog|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CodeSignal now has 15 company bots including bots from [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Quora]],&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt; [[Instacart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.itbusinessedge.com/blogs/from-under-the-rug/how-competing-against-a-bot-could-land-you-a-developer-job.html|title=How Competing Against a ‘Bot’ Could Land You a Developer Job|website=www.itbusinessedge.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SpaceX]], [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/codefights-has-a-new-service-to-help-companies-find-job-candidates-2017-10|title=This startup wants to help programmers get hired based on their coding skills rather than their résumés|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CodeSignal for Recruiters ==
In addition to being a learning tool for developers, CodeSignal Recruiter (previously known as CodeSignalR)  is also a skills-based recruiting platform that uses a data-driven approach to help companies improve their hiring process, find better qualified candidates, and make more objective hiring decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/eilenezimmerman/2016/01/20/uber-hires-programmers-who-can-win-a-fight-with-their-robot/#2a36b1967912|title=Uber Hires Programmers Who Can Win A Fight With Their Robot|last=Zimmerman|first=Eilene|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;

Launched in October 2017, CodeSignal Recruiter&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-codefightsr-to-deliver-data-driven-skills-based-recruiting-300543663.html|title=CodeFights Launches CodeFightsR To Deliver Data-Driven Skills-Based Recruiting|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the sourcing, testing, and interview platform for technical recruiters. Companies with a CodeSignal Recruiter account can contact developers within the CodeSignal community who have done well on challenges &lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; and have signalled that they are open to new jobs. Once contacted, recruiters can use CodeSignal to send out custom programming tests to candidates that include plagiarism checks, live recordings, timed assessments, all within a developer-focused IDE (integrated development environment).

CodeSignal Recruiter is also integrated with Applicant Tracking System (ATS) software including Greenhouse, Lever and SmartRecruiters, which allows recruiters to manage and sync candidate data between CodeSignal and their recruiting platform including send coding tests, evaluating results and managing candidate lifecycles.

Some of CodeFight’s Recruiter customers include [[Evernote]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/16/the-hiring-game/|title=The hiring game – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uber]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Thumbtack (website)|Thumbtack]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt; [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Asana (software)|Asana]],&lt;ref name="The hiring game – TechCrunch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Simons"/&gt; [[Ascend Communications|Ascend]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/codefights-customer-stories-ascend-io/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Ascend.io {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-23|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [https://www.wizeline.com/ Wizeline]&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.codefights.com/customer-stories-wizeline/|title=CodeFights Customer Stories: Wizeline {{!}} CodeFights|date=2018-03-08|work=CodeFights|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quora]].&lt;ref name="uk.businessinsider.com"/&gt;

=== CodeSignal Coding Score ===
CodeSignal launched their rating system, called Coding Score, on July 10, 2018. The Coding Score is a measure of a developer's overall implementation and problem-solving ability. It is a predictor of how well a developer will perform in technical interviews. To get a initial Coding Score on CodeSignal, each developer has to solve at least 3 tasks on CodeSignal. To get a more accurate score, developers are asked to vary the difficulty of the tasks that they solve.

=== Testing&lt;ref name="The New Stack"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thenewstack.io/helping-engineers-assess-their-skills/|title=CodeFights: A Platform to Test Coding Skills, Prepare for Interviews and Apply for Jobs - The New Stack|date=2017-05-09|work=The New Stack|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; ===
CodeSignal Recruiter also has a testing feature that allows recruiters to send out technical assessments to their potential candidates. These tests can be customized to simulate real-world challenges that the candidate may face on the job, which has been reported to be a better measurement for competency than regular interview questions or theoretical programming tests. The testing suite also has a built in plagiarism checker that predicts the probability of plagiarism by comparing to other completed tests on the CodeSignal platform and solutions from known sites. During the on-boarding process CodeSignal works with customers to create custom tests so the online tests are calibrated with the interview process and job responsibilities.&lt;ref name="The New Stack"/&gt;

=== Interviewing ===
The CodeSignal Recruiter Interview feature allows recruiters to conduct online and in-person interviews in a shared coding environment that supports 38 programming languages. The interview environment allows for timed assessments, live recordings, and an extensive library of skills-based coding tasks. During each live interview, the hiring manager can watch and conduct a coding skills assessment using pre-defined coding tasks while also talking to the candidate over a live video stream. Each live interview is also recorded so that other hiring managers in the recruitment process can review and share the candidates live assessment.&lt;ref name="techcrunch.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/codefights-launches-interview-practice-to-help-coders-ace-technical-job-interviews-at-top-tech-companies-300407220.html|title=CodeFights Launches Interview Practice To Help Coders Ace Technical Job Interviews At Top Tech Companies|last=CodeFights|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
As of July 2017, CodeSignal has raised a total of $12.5 million in 2 rounds from 23 investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/codefights#/entity|title=CodeFights {{!}} Crunchbase|website=Crunchbase|language=en|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company raised an initial $2.5 million in seed funding in April 2015,&lt;ref name="VentureBeat"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/11/17/codefights-raises-10m-series-a-round-for-its-skills-based-recruiting-platform/|title=CodeFights raises $10M Series A round for its skills-based recruiting platform – TechCrunch|website=techcrunch.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included investments by Felicis Ventures (Aydin Senkut), Sutter Hill Ventures (Mike Speiser), LiveRamp CEO Auren Hoffman, Google Shopping Express founder Tom Fallows, Twitter VP of Engineering Raffi Krikorian, [[Quora]] CEO [[Adam D'Angelo]] and [[GoDaddy]] VP of Engineering Marek Olszewski.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"/&gt; CodeSignal raised $10 million in November 2016. The Series A funding round was led by [[e.ventures]]. Other investors in that round included SV Angel, A Capital, Granatus Ventures,&lt;ref name="Simons20162"&gt;Simons, John.

'''[[Cyberstalking]]''' and '''[[cyberbullying]]''' are relatively new phenomena, but that does not mean that crimes committed through the network are not punishable under '''[[legislation]]''' drafted for that purpose. Although there are often existing laws that prohibit stalking or harassment in a general sense, legislators sometimes believe that such laws are inadequate or do not go far enough, and thus bring forward new legislation to address this perceived shortcoming. In the [[United States]], for example, nearly every state has laws that address cyberstalking, cyberbullying, or both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ssl.csg.org/dockets/2012cycle/32B/32Bdocmins/Cyberstalking,%20Cyberharassment%20and%20Cyberbullying%20Laws.pdf |title=Cyberstalking, Cyberharassment and Cyberbullying Laws |publisher=[[Council of State Governments]] |date=2010-12-10 |accessdate=2016-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319052033/http://ssl.csg.org/dockets/2012cycle/32B/32Bdocmins/Cyberstalking%2C%20Cyberharassment%20and%20Cyberbullying%20Laws.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues at stake==
Cyberbullying and cyberstalking, by their nature, define adversarial relationships. One person (or group), the provocateur, is exerting a view or opinion that the other person (or group), the target, finds offensive, hurtful, or damaging in some way. In a general sense, it would seem simple to legislate this type of behavior; [[slander]] and [[libel]] laws exist to tackle these situations. However, just as with slander and libel, it is important to balance the protection of freedom of speech of both parties with the need for protection of the target. Thus, something that may be deemed cyberbullying at first glance may, in fact, be more akin to something like [[parody]] or similar.

A 2006 National Crime Prevention Council survey found that some 40% of teens had experienced cyberbullying at some point in their lives, making the problem particularly widespread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/on-education/2009/01/07/california-law-targets-cyberbullying |title=California Law Targets Cyberbullying |publisher=US News |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is the issue of cyberbullying extensive, it has adverse effects on adolescents: increased depression, suicidal behavior, anxiety, and increased susceptibility of drug use and aggressive behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Charisse L|date=2014-08-01|title=Current perspectives: the impact of cyberbullying on adolescent health|journal=Adolescent Health, Medicine and Therapeutics|volume=5|pages=143–158|doi=10.2147/AHMT.S36456|issn=1179-318X|pmc=4126576|pmid=25177157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation by country==

===Australia===
Australia does not have specific cyberbullying legislation, although the scope of existing laws can be extended to deal with cyberbullying.

State laws can deal with some forms of cyberbullying, such as documents containing threats,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s31.html |title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 31 Documents containing threats |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and threats to destroy and damage property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s199.html |title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 199 Threatening to destroy or damage property |publisher=Austlii.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonwealth offences that criminalise the misuse of telecommunication services are also relevant when technology is used to communicate harassment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00793/Html/Volume_2#_Toc405466347 |title=Criminal Code Act 1995 |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; or threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00793/Html/Volume_2#_Toc405466345 |title=Criminal Code Act 1995 |publisher=Comlaw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Family Law Act 1975|Family Law Act 1975 (Cth)]] protects individuals from harassment, including harassment that occurs via electronic communications.  However, this is limited to the victims of family violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.alrc.gov.au/publications/3-overview-current-law/harassment-and-stalking-offences#_ftn45|title=Harassment and stalking offences|last=Australian Law Reform Commission|first=|date=2014-03-27|website=www.alrc.gov.au|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian government has proposed specific cyberbullying laws to protect children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulfletcher.com.au/media-centre/media-releases/item/1211-government-reveals-further-details-on-cyberbullying-laws.html |title=Government reveals further details on cyberbullying laws - Paul Fletcher MP |publisher=Paulfletcher.com.au |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

===="Cyberbullying" versus "cyberstalking"====

In the US, in practice, there is little legislative difference between the concepts of "cyberbullying" and "cyberstalking." The primary distinction is one of age; if adults are involved, the act is usually termed ''[http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cyberstalking cyberstalking],'' while among children it is usually referred to as ''[[wiktionary:cyberbullying|cyberbullying]].'' However, this distinction is one of semantics, and many laws treat ''bullying'' and ''stalking'' as much the same issue.

====Freedom of speech issues====
[[Free Speech Clause|First Amendment]] concerns often arise when questionable speech is uttered or posted online. This is equally true when dealing with cyberbullying. Particularly in instances where there are no laws explicitly against cyberbullying, it is not uncommon for defendants to argue that their conduct amounts to an exercise of their freedom of speech.

The courts have variously come down on either side of that debate, even within the same state. For example, a student in California who was suspended from school based on cyberbullying claims took the school district to court, citing a breach of her First Amendment rights; the court agreed with the student and found the school district had overstepped its authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/12/14/judge_rules_students_cruel_remarks_online_are_not_unconstitutional/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Victoria | last=Kim | title=Judge backs student's First Amendment rights | date=14 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another California case, in which a student was harassed after posting personal information online, the court found that threatening posts were ''not'' protected speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/03/cyberbullying-not-protected/ | work=Wired | first=Kim | last=Zetter | title=Court: Cyberbullying Threats Are Not Protected Speech | date=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That said, ''true'' threats are '''not''' considered to be protected speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Nate |url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/02/8903.ars |title=Cyberbullying and schools: where does a principal’s authority end? |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2007-02-22 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Organizations such as the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] have taken the view that cyberbullying is an overly expansive term, and that the First Amendment protects all speech, even the reprehensible; this protection would extend to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker |first=James |url=https://www.aclu.org/2008/01/16/free-speech-and-cyber-bullying |title=Free Speech and "Cyber-bullying" &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, such organizations argue that while the need for legislation against cyberbullying may exist, legislators must take a cautious, reasoned approach to enacting laws, and not rush into creating laws that would curtail speech too much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=18:27&amp;nbsp;GMT |url=http://advox.globalvoices.org/2010/01/12/first-amendment-and-cyber-bullying/ |title=First Amendment and cyber bullying - Global Voices Advocacy |publisher=Advox.globalvoices.org |date=2016-02-09 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet free speech issues have certainly made their way through the court systems, even as far back as cases from the mid-90s. In the case of [[United States v. Baker]], for example, an undergraduate at the [[University of Michigan]] was charged with crimes related to snuff stories he had posted on Internet newsgroups, stories that named one of his fellow students. After progressing through the courts, the charges against Baker were dismissed primarily on grounds that there was no evidence that Baker would actually act out the fantasies contained in those stories. This case is now considered a landmark in the realm of First Amendment issues on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Terry fisher |url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/ilaw/Speech/Baker1.html |title=United States v. Baker |publisher=Cyber.law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The need for new laws====
The focus on legislating cyberbullying and cyberstalking has largely come about as a result of the perceived inadequacy, generally by legislators and parents of bullying victims, of existing laws, whether those existing laws cover stalking, unauthorized use of computer resources, or the like.
The motivation behind the bill in 1990 where 50 U.S. states and the federal government passed a bill to "criminalize" stalking was due to the cases of stalking against celebrities (Spitzberg &amp; Hoobler, 2002).

For example, in the case of ''[[United States v. Lori Drew]]'', in which [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]] had committed suicide after being bullied on [[Myspace|MySpace]], three of the four charges against the defendant (Drew) were actually in response to alleged violations of the [[Computer Fraud and Abuse Act]], since specific statues against cyberbullying were not on the books. The jury eventually found Drew innocent of the charges (but guilty of a misdemeanor), a verdict that was later set aside by the judge. In this situation, legislators in Missouri, at the urging of the public and Meier's parents, passed "Megan's Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c500-599/5650000090.htm |accessdate=May 1, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717000924/http://www.moga.mo.gov/statutes/c500-599/5650000090.htm |archivedate=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pantagraph.com/news/article_6ade6d44-a162-54d1-9be0-88bebf181f6d.html |title=Bill targets adults who cyberbully &amp;#124; News |publisher=pantagraph.com |date=2007-12-20 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily aimed at the crime of a person over 21 years of age bullying a person under 18 years of age.

In addition, prosecutors will sometimes use other legal avenues to prosecute offenders. In the case of [[Suicide of Tyler Clementi|Tyler Clementi]], who killed himself after video of his homosexual encounter was broadcast on the Internet, prosecutors charged the defendants with invasion of privacy and computer crimes. Like the Meier case, the Clementi case spurred legislators (this time, in New Jersey) to pass a law specifically aimed at bullying, an "Anti-bullying Bill of Rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tony Kurdzuk/The Star-Ledger |url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/11/nj_assembly_passes_anti-bullyi.html |title=N.J. Assembly, Senate pass 'Anti-Bullying Bill of Rights' in wake of Tyler Clementi's death |publisher=NJ.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some laws are written such that the focus on cyberbullying is the set of acts that occur within a school, others are more general, targeting cyberbullying no matter where it occurs. In addition, some of these newly written laws (like one in Connecticut) put more of an onus on the school system, mandating that the school's administration must intervene at the first sign of bullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Keating|first=Christopher|title=Stronger Anti-Bullying Bill Approved By Committee|url=http://articles.courant.com/2011-03-23/news/hc-bully-bill-0324-20110323_1_cyberbullying-bill-mandates-new-department|accessdate=24 April 2011|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, it's not uncommon for cyberbullying to be coupled with "traditional", in-person bullying, for example, in the [[Phoebe Prince|suicide of Phoebe Prince]]. Students at her school had bullied her for months in school, and that harassment eventually moved online as well. As in Connecticut, New Jersey, and Missouri, the Prince case led to stricter anti-bullying legislation in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/05/04/grieving_family_by_his_side_governor_signs_legislation/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Noah | last=Bierman | title=Grieving family by his side, governor signs legislation | date=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation at the state level====
Some U.S. states have begun to address the problem of cyberbullying. States that have passed legislation have done so generally in response to incidents within that state, to address what they believe to be shortcomings in federal laws, or to expand protection to victims above and beyond existing statutes.

There are laws that only address online harassment of children or focus on child predators as well as laws that protect adult cyberstalking victims, or victims of any age. While some sites specialize in laws that protect victims age 18 and under, Working to Halt Online Abuse is a help resource listing current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/index.shtml Current and pending cyberstalking-related United States federal and state laws] WHOA&lt;/ref&gt; It also lists those states that do not have laws yet and related laws from other countries.

=====California=====
California passed the first cyberstalking law in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Katie Dean, [https://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2000/05/35728 The Epidemic of Cyberstalking], [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]], May 1, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; (§646.9 of the [[California Penal Code]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://euro.ecom.cmu.edu/program/law/08-732/Crime/CaliforniaPenal646-9.pdf §646.9 of the California Penal Code]&lt;/ref&gt; Its first use resulted in a six-year sentence for a man who harassed a woman who could identify him.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Zeller, [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/technology/a-sinister-web-entraps-victims-of-cyberstalkers.html?pagewanted=1 Despite Laws, Stalkers Roam On the Internet], [[New York Times]], April 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After sending hundreds of threatening e-mails to an actress, another male convicted after spending months in jail waiting for trial was sentenced in 2001 to five years probation, forbidden access to computers and forced to attend mental health counseling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/2001-06-29-cyberstalking.htm Cyberstalking garnering more serious response], [[Associated Press]], June 29, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a man was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation before sentencing for cyberstalking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbs8.com/story/15859709/cyberstalker-to-be-sentenced-in-san-diego Man convicted of cyberstalking to undergo psychiatric evaluation before sentencing], [[WAKA|CBS 8 News]], October 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; On January 1, 2009, a California law became effective that allows schools to suspend or expel students who harass other students online. It also mandates that schools develop policies to address the problem.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Calefati, [https://www.usnews.com/education/blogs/on-education/2009/01/07/california-law-targets-cyberbullying California Law Targets Cyberbullying], US News, January 7, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Section 1708.7 of the California Civil Code outlines grounds for an individual suing their cyberstalker and any accomplices for general damages, special damages, and punitive damages for cyberstalking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=civ&amp;group=01001-02000&amp;file=1708-1725 California Civil Code Section 1708-1725].&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Florida=====
Under Florida Statute 784.048, "cyberstalking," defined as ''to engage in a course of conduct to communicate, or to cause to be communicated, words, images, or language by or through the use of electronic mail or electronic communication, directed at a specific person, causing substantial emotional distress to that person and serving no legitimate purpose,'' is classified as a first degree misdemeanor. Cyberstalking a child under the age of 16 or a person of any age for which the offender has been ordered by the courts not to contact is considered "aggravated stalking," a third degree felony under Florida law. Cyberstalking in conjunction with a credible threat is also considered aggravated stalking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.048.html|title=The 2014 Florida Statutes|accessdate=2014-09-17|publisher=The Florida Legislature}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Florida passed the "Jeffrey Johnston Stand Up For All Students Act" in response to the suicide of 15-year-old Jeffrey Johnston, who had suffered cyberbullying over a long period of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=4774894&amp;page=1 |title=Mom's Campaign for Florida Anti-Bully Law Finally Pays Off - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-05-02 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unusual among state laws regarding cyberbullying is a provision that withholds funding for schools who are not in compliance with the provision that they must inform parents of those involved in cyberbullying—both the bully and the target.:)

=====Illinois=====
According to "Who@: Working to Halt Online Abuse":
:Sec. 1-2. Harassment through electronic communications.
(a) Harassment through electronic communications is the use of electronic communication for any of the following
purposes:
#Making any comment, request, suggestion or proposal which is obscene with an intent to offend;
#Interrupting, with the intent to harass, the telephone service or the electronic communication service of any person;
#Transmitting to any person, with the intent to harass and regardless of whether the communication is read in its entirety or at all, any file, document, or other communication which prevents that person from using his or her telephone service or electronic communications device;
##Transmitting an electronic communication or knowingly inducing a person to transmit an electronic communication for the purpose of harassing another person who is under 13 years of age, regardless of whether the person under 13 years of age consents to the harassment, if the defendant is at least 16 years of age at the time of the commission of the offense;
#Threatening injury to the person or to the property of the person to whom an electronic communication is directed or to any of his or her family or household members; or
#Knowingly permitting any electronic communications device to be used for any of the purposes mentioned in this subsection (a).

(b) As used in this Act: 
#"Electronic communication" means any transfer of signs, signals, writings, images, sounds, data or intelligence of any nature transmitted in whole or in part by a wire, radio, electromagnetic, photoelectric or photo-optical system. "Electronic communication" includes transmissions by a computer through the Internet to another computer.
#"Family or household member" includes spouses, former spouses, parents, children, stepchildren and other persons related by blood or by present or prior marriage, persons who share or formerly shared a common dwelling, persons who have or allegedly share a blood relationship through a child, persons who have or have had a dating or engagement relationship, and persons with disabilities and their personal assistants. For purposes of this Act, neither a casual acquaintanceship nor ordinary fraternization between 2 individuals in business or social contexts shall be deemed to constitute a dating relationship.

(c) Telecommunications carriers, commercial mobile service providers, and providers of information services, including, but not limited to, Internet service providers and hosting service providers, are not liable under this Section, except for willful and wanton misconduct, by virtue of the transmission, storage, or caching of electronic communications or messages of others or by virtue of the provision of other related telecommunications, commercial mobile services, or information services used by others in violation of this Section.

=====Massachusetts=====
In response to Phoebe Prince's suicide, as well as that of Carl Walker—both of whom had been bullied before taking their lives—the Massachusetts legislature in 2010 passed what advocates call one of the toughest anti-bullying laws in the nation. The law prohibits both online taunting and physical or emotional abuse, and mandates training for faculty and students at schools. It further mandates that school administrators inform parents of bullying that occurs within the schools themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-20004060-504083.html | work=CBS News | title=Cyber Bullying Illegal: Mass.

=====Missouri=====
As noted previously, in 2008 Missouri revised its statutes on harassment to include harassment and stalking through electronic and telephonic communications and cyber-bullying after the suicide of [[Suicide of Megan Meier|Megan Meier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibls.com/internet_law_news_portal_view.aspx?id=2095&amp;s=latestnews Missouri Gov. Blunt Signs Bill Outlawing Cyberbullying]&lt;/ref&gt;

===== New York =====
New York state passed the [[Dignity For All Students Act]], focusing primarily on elementary and middle school students.

=====Texas=====
Texas enacted the Stalking by Electronic Communications Act in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haltabuse.org/resources/laws/texas.shtml |title=Cyberstalking Laws - Texas |publisher=Haltabuse.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Washington state=====
Washington takes the approach of putting the focus on cyberbullying prevention and response directly on the schools. The law also requires schools to create policies to address bullying in a general sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/billinfo/summary.aspx?year=2007&amp;bill=5288 |title=SB 5288 - 2007-08 |publisher=Apps.leg.wa.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=House and Senate WA. |url=http://www.bullypolice.org/wa_law.html |title=Washington State Anti Bullying Law |publisher=Bullypolice.org |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Legislation at the federal level====
Attempts at legislating cyberbullying have been tried at the federal level, primarily because the [[Commerce Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution specifically provides that only the federal government can regulate commerce between the states; this includes electronic communication over the Internet. An early example, the Violence Against Women Act, passed in 2000, included cyberbullying in a part of interstate status on harassment.

=====Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act=====
In 2009, Representative [[Linda Sánchez]] (D-CA) brought legislation titled the "Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act" before the U.S. House of Representatives. Her efforts were met with little enthusiasm, however, as Representatives from both the Republican and Democratic parties were concerned with the bill's impact on the freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2009/09/cyberbullyingbill/ | work=Wired | first=David | last=Kravets | title=Cyberbullying Bill Gets Chilly Reception | date=30 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the oft-cited arguments against the bill comes from [[talk radio#Politically oriented talk radio|talk radio]], with the concern expressed being that the law would be used to silence political opponents who use the airwaves to espouse divergent viewpoints.&lt;ref name="cato-at-liberty1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Rittgers |first=David |url=http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/federal-cyberbullying-law-worth-a-try/ |title=Federal Cyberbullying Law: 'Worth a Try'? &amp;#124; Cato @ Liberty |publisher=Cato-at-liberty.org |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkfrontier.com/2009/06/30/hate-cyber-bullying-bills-could-threaten-talk-radio/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303112054/http://www.talkfrontier.com/2009/06/30/hate-cyber-bullying-bills-could-threaten-talk-radio/ |archivedate=2012-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another issue is that would make violation of the law a [[felony]], rather than a [[misdemeanor]] as has been done in most states. Opponents of the bill argue that since the target of such legislation is nominally teenagers, this would put an undue burden on the prison system—since there are no long-term facilities for teenage offenders at the federal level. In addition, opponents call the proposed sentences (up to two years incarceration) excessive.&lt;ref name="cato-at-liberty1"/&gt;

While Sánchez' bill was discussed in committee, it has not passed that stage {{as of|2012|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.01966: |title=Bill Summary &amp; Status - 111th Congress (2009 - 2010) - H.R.1966 - THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act=====
In early March 2011, U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] (D-NJ) and Representative [[Rush D. Holt, Jr.]] (D-NJ-12) introduced the "Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act", which would mandate that colleges and universities that receive federal funding have policies in place to address harassment—including cyberbullying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/gloucester-county/index.ssf/2011/03/federal_bill_will_help_combat.html |title=Federal bill will help combat harassment and cyberbullying on college campuses |publisher=NJ.com |date=2011-03-12 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/D?d112:2:./temp/~bd1uH9:@@@L&amp;summ2=m&amp;|/home/LegislativeData.php|&lt;/ref&gt; Universities would be required to address harassment that focuses on real or perceived race, color, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, or religion. The bill would also enable the [[U.S. Department of Education]] to provide training to institutes of higher education to prevent or address harassment.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Furthermore, the bill addresses not just student-to-student harassment, but also harassment of students by faculty or staff as well.

However, like the Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act, this bill also has its detractors. Opponents point out that harassment on college campuses is already prohibited under existing laws; furthermore, they point out that harassment based on sexual orientation is also covered under existing statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Creeley |first=Will |url=http://thefire.org/article/12945.html |title=Problematic 'Tyler Clementi Higher Education Anti-Harassment Act' Returns to Congress |publisher=FIRE |date=2011-03-11 |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as with the Sánchez bill, there are questions as to the free speech implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The Tyler Clementi Act and Threats to Free Speech|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/phi-beta-cons/254164/tyler-clementi-act-and-threats-free-speech-david-french |work = [[National Review Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Prior to February 2013, there were no laws that directly regulate cyberstalking in [[India]]. India's Information Technology Act of 2000 (IT Act) was a set of laws to regulate the cyberspace. However, it merely focused on financial crimes and neglected interpersonal criminal behaviours such as cyberstalking (Behera, 2010; Halder &amp; Jaishankar, 2008; Nappinai, 2010). In 2013, Indian Parliament made [[Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|amendments]] to the [[Indian Penal Code]], introducing cyberstalking as a criminal offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013|url=http://mha.nic.in/pdfs/TheCrimnalLaw030413.pdf|publisher=Government of India|accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stalking has been defined as a man or woman who follows or contacts a man or woman, despite clear indication of disinterest to such contact by the man or woman, or monitoring of use of internet or electronic communication of a man or a woman. A man or a woman committing the offence of stalking would be liable for imprisonment up to three years for the first offence, and shall also be liable to fine and for any subsequent conviction would be liable for imprisonment up to five years and with fine.

===Poland===
Cyberstalking has been illegal since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.rp.pl/prawoipodatki/2011/06/14/stalking-w-polskim-prawie-karnym/ |title=parkiet.com |publisher=Blog.rp.pl |date= |accessdate=2016-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
New Zealand Minister of Justice Judith Collins plans to introduce a law that would make it an offence to incite people to commit suicide, or post material that is grossly offensive by the end of 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.3news.co.nz/Cyber-bullies-could-be-jailed/tabid/423/articleID/292936/Default.aspx|work=3 News NZ |title= Cyber bullies could be jailed| date=April 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7891">'''ERMES''' ('''European Radio Messaging System''' or '''Enhanced Radio Messaging System'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ketterling, Hans-Peter A.|title=Introduction to Digital Professional Mobile Radio|year=2004|publisher=Artech House, Inc|page=2|isbn=1580531733|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nZ5ISTkagOQC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22enhanced+radio+messaging+system%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9UBMUObRLi&amp;sig=pUXGVsf28GjShL4n-Jv55zNIL1Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=feQXVZSSBIS6ggSB4YCwDw&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22enhanced%20radio%20messaging%20system%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a pan-European [[radio paging]] system.   

==Technical specification==
In 1990, the European Telecommunications Standard Institute ([[ETSI]]) developed the European Telecommunications Standard ETS 300 133 for ERMES operating in the frequency band 169.4125-169.8125&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31990L0544:EN:HTML Council Directive 90/544/EEC of 9 October 1990 on the frequency bands designated for the coordinated introduction of pan-European land-based public radio paging in the Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission parameters===
* ERMES transmits the data at 6250 bit/s.
* ERMES uses Frequency Shift Keying (4-FSK) modulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ERMES|url=http://www.telecomabc.com/e/ermes.html|publisher=Telecom ABC|accessdate=29 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission parameters, pager interrogation===
* Each paging transmission is divided into 60 cycles of 1 minute in length.
* Each cycle is divided into 5 subsequences of 12 seconds.
* Each subsequence is further divided into 16 batches, labeled A through P.

===Pager interrogation===
* The pager population is divided into 16 groups.
* Each pager group is allocated to one of the 16 transmission batches [A...P].
* The pager needs only to be active during the period it has been allocated to, allowing it to go into sleep mode 15/16 (~=93%) of the time (a ~7% duty cycle). This scheduling allocation protocol extends the battery life of the pager by several orders of magnitude.

==Aims and development==
During the 1990s, ERMES aimed to achieve a standardised digital platform throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=telecom1996&gt;McClelland, Stephen. "That dreaded 'P' word." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. April 1996. Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-9474992.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telecom1997&gt;Stephen McClelland. "Europe's paging process." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. March 1997.

Also, [[GSM]] handsets would receive ERMES messages on their displays.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Malcolm. "Converging on multimedia." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. October 1996. Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-10335694.html&lt;/ref&gt;

ERMES was most widely used in France, where around one million ERMES pagers were in use in 1998.&lt;ref name=telecom1998 /&gt; Also in 1998, an ERMES [[MoU]] organisation was set up, to lobby for its adoption as the European standard.&lt;ref&gt;McClelland, Stephen. "Ermes MoU raised to legal status." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. August 1998. Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-33541948.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Failure==
ERMES never achieved recognition as a leading paging standard.&lt;ref name=telecom1997 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. "Wireless in Europe." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. March 1997. Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-14695093.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofcom.org.uk/static/archive/ra/topics/paging/document/pwa-paging.htm Ofcom's Public Wide Area Paging Information]&lt;/ref&gt; There were questions over costs&lt;ref name=telecom1996 /&gt;&lt;ref name=wirelessweek&gt;Quigley, Paul.

Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-64452984.html&lt;/ref&gt; and also the ERMES standard was in competition with the US-based [[FLEX (protocol)|FLEX]] standard, a rivalry seen at the time as damaging to the development of the paging industry in Europe.&lt;ref name=telecom1998&gt;Berendt, Annelise. "Paging's window of opportunity." Telecommunications. Horizon House Publications Inc. October 1998.

In 1999, it was decided that the 169.4-169.8 MHz frequency band would no longer be reserved for the sole use of ERMES&lt;ref&gt;Couvas, Jacques. "Is two-way paging the way forward?."

Retrieved April 29, 2015 from HighBeam Research: http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-46730217.html&lt;/ref&gt; and this frequency band was later reassigned to different use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2005:344:0047:01:EN:HTML Commission Decision of 20 December 2005 on the harmonisation of the 169,4-169,8125 MHz frequency band in the Community]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3874">An '''electrostatic separator''' is a device for separating [[Subatomic particle|particles]] by [[mass]] in a low energy charged beam.

It works on the principle of [[corona discharge]], where two plates are placed close together and high voltage is applied. This high voltage is used to separate the ionized particles.

Usually these are used in power plants where the harmful gases coming out of the chimneys are first treated using electrostatic separator. Here the two electrodes are oppositely charged, with a negative electrode the positive ions gets attracted and thus results in a '''reddish''' flame whereas the positive electrode is used to treat the negatively charged ions resulting in a '''bluish white''' flame that is visible at nights.

Electrostatic separation is a process that uses electrostatic charges to separate crushed particles of material. An industrial process used to separate large amounts of material particles, electrostatic separating is most often used in the process of sorting mineral ore. This process can help remove valuable material from ore, or it can help remove foreign material to purify a substance. In mining, the process of crushing mining ore into particles for the purpose of separating minerals is called beneficiation.

Generally, electrostatic charges are used to attract or repel differently charged material. When electrostatic separation uses the force of attraction to sort particles, conducting particles stick to an oppositely charged object, such as a metal drum, thereby separating them from the particle mixture. When this type of beneficiation uses repelling force, it is normally employed to change the trajectory of falling objects to sort them into different places. This way, when a mixture of particles falls past a repelling object, the particles with the correct charge fall away from the other particles when they are repelled by the similarly charged object.

Charge is the measure of the electric current flowing through an object. A charge can be positive or negative — objects with a positive charge repel other positively charged objects, thereby causing them to push away from each other, while a positively charged object would attract to a negatively charged object, thereby causing the two to draw together. Electrostatic charges are the charges associated with static electricity. Generally, electrostatic charges can build up by friction and can be observed when a balloon attracts a person's hair after the balloon is rubbed against the person's head.

Experiments showing electrostatic sorting in action can help make the process more clear. To exhibit electrostatic separation at home, an experiment can be conducted using peanuts that are still in their shells. When the shells are rubbed off of the peanuts and gently smashed into pieces, an electrostatically charged device, like a comb rubbed quickly against a wool sweater, will pick up the peanut shells with static electricity. The lightweight crushed shells that are oppositely charged from the comb easily move away from the edible peanut parts when the comb is passed nearby.

The electrostatic separation of conductors is one method of beneficiation; another common beneficiation method is magnetic beneficiation. Electrostatic separation is a preferred sorting method when dealing with separating conductors from electrostatic separation non-conductors. In a similar way to that in which electrostatic separation sorts particles with different electrostatic charges magnetic beneficiation sorts particles that respond to a magnetic field. Electrostatic beneficiation is effective for removing particulate matter, such as ash from mined coal, while magnetic separation functions well for removing the magnetic iron ore from deposits of clay in the earth.

A '''focus finder''' is a simple [[optics|optical]] tool used to examine a [[virtual image]] in an optical device to achieve a precise point of [[focus (optics)|focus]].

They are most commonly used in [[Enlarger|photographic enlarging]] to ensure that the negative image is accurately focussed on the easel.

Focus finders are designed so that their optical path is exactly equal to the optical path of the uninterrupted light. 

In enlarging, this is achieved by mounting an angled front-silvered [[mirror]] on a small [[plinth]] and using a strong [[magnification|magnifying]] [[eyepiece]] and graticle to examine the reflected virtual image. The enlarger lens is then carefully focussed until the grain structure of the film can be seen in the plane of the graticle.

'''Government performance management''' (GPM) consists of a set of processes that help government organizations optimize their business performance. It provides a framework for organizing, automating, and analyzing business methodologies, metrics, processes and systems that drive business performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.information-management.com/bissues/20070301/2600312-1.html|title=Performance Management for Government|author=Michael Owellen|date=28 February 2007|work=BI Review Magazine|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators{{who|date=October 2014}} see GPM as the next generation of [[business intelligence]] (BI) for governments. GPM helps governments to make use of their financial, human, material, and other resources.  In the past, owners have sought to drive strategy down and across their organizations; they have struggled to transform strategies into actionable metrics and they have grappled with meaningful analysis to expose the cause-and-effect relationships that, if understood, could give profitable insight to their operational decision-makers.  GPM software and methods allow a systematic, integrated approach that links government strategy to core processes and activities. "Running by the numbers" now means something: planning, budgeting, analysis, and reporting can give the measurements that empower management decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |accessdate=7 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112223214/http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O12-performancemanagement.html |archivedate=12 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Performance management (PM) market ==
According to [[Gartner]]{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}, the Enterprise Performance Management (EPM) suite market continues to experience strong momentum, growing 19% during 2007. This is slightly in advance of their earlier market sizing and forecast analysis, which anticipated 2007 revenue to be $1.836&amp;nbsp;million, representing an 18% year-over-year growth. In the latest forecast, Gartner believe that the market for EPM will be more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion by 2011, representing a 14.4% compound annual growth rate. Several factors contributed to the continued significant growth in EPM revenue during 2007:
* Many organizations replaced difficult-to-maintain, inflexible, or outmoded spreadsheets and homegrown financial applications.
* Continued growth in large enterprises was fueled by desires to achieve greater transparency and adherence to governance and compliance legislation.
* Increased demand for applications that support strategic plans and operational activities drove new momentum in the deployment of scorecards.
* There was increased demand from mid-size enterprises, representing one of the largest untapped and dynamic areas of the business application software sector.
* Advertising and PR from increasingly large vendors and system integrators are raising the EPM profile and generating greater demand.

Gartner expects the business Intelligence software market to reach $3 billion in 2009. "Companies around the world have purchased more than US$40&amp;nbsp;billion worth of enterprise applications, including ERP, CRM and HR, during the past few years," said Colleen Graham, principal research analyst at Gartner. "This has generated significant volumes of data in support of the operational processes they automate. By investing in BI, companies can further leverage their enterprise application investments and turn the torrent of data into meaningful insight to better measure performance, respond more quickly to market changes and opportunities and comply with an increasingly complex regulatory environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gartner.com/press_releases/asset_144782_11.html|title=Gartner News Room|publisher=Gartner.com|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GreenChip''' is a technology brand of Philips Semiconductors (now [[NXP Semiconductors]]) and is used in the company’s range of power adapter ICs with the same name. GreenChip ICs are used in power adapters and power supplies, as well as energy-saving CFL bulbs and [[LED]] lighting products.&lt;ref&gt;By Junko Yoshida, EE Times. “[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1259539 NXP's foray into 'Internet of things' starts with light bulbs].” May 17, 2011. Retrieved January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, NXP introduced the GreenChip smart lighting solution—including the GreenChip iCFL for compact [[fluorescent lamp]]s and the GreenChip iSSL for LEDs—to enable quick start times, dimming, extended lifetimes, and [[wireless connectivity]] via IPv4 or IPv6 using [[JenNet-IP]] network layer software.&lt;ref&gt;By Christopher Trout, engadget. “[https://www.engadget.com/2011/05/17/greenchip-lighting-lets-you-flip-the-switch-remotely-thumbs-nos/ GreenChip lighting lets you flip the switch remotely, thumbs nose at IPv4 depletion].” May 17, 2011. Retrieved January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The TEA1504 was the first IC to bear the GreenChip name. Released in 1998, it was an [[Switched-mode power supply|SMPS]] controller with integrated standby burst mode aimed at [[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] monitor applications. Improvements to standby behavior meant the chip realized a &lt; 3 W consumption (the [[Energy Star]] target at the time), without needing a separate standby power supply.

The second generation GreenChip II products appeared in 2000 with the release of the TEA1507, a quasi resonant flyback SMPS controller targeted at standby power savings in [[monitor (computing)|monitor]]s, TVs and VCRs.&lt;ref&gt;By ElectronicsWeekly. “[http://www.electronicsweekly.com/news/archived/resources-archived/philips-green-power-controller-gets-greener-2000-11/ Philips 'green' power controller gets greener].” November 15, 2000. Retrieved January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It could achieve a standby performance of &lt; 1 W and boasted efficiency improvements well beyond 90%. The IC was built in close cooperation with Philips CE TV and was included in the designs of numerous TV manufacturers.

In 2002/2003, the GreenChip II TEA155x series was released. Derived from the TEA1507, the new series was specifically aimed at [[notebook computer|notebook]] [[power brick|adapter]]s. The GreenChip II series was capable of reducing notebook adapter no-load power to below 500&amp;nbsp;mW (a 100% improvement on the state-of-the-art 1 W at that time). It also improved system robustness by integrating more adapter specific protections and signaling conditioning functionality. The TEA155x grew to take a dominant share in the notebook adapter market.

The third generation GreenChip III arrived in 2007 with the launch of the TEA1750.&lt;ref&gt;By Paul OShea, EE Times. “[http://www.eetimes.com/document.asp?doc_id=1303705 Third gen chip reduces standby power in notebooks].” March 6, 2007. Retrieved January 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It established market leadership in the high power and high efficiency notebook and 75-250 W computing markets. GreenChip III combines an SMPS controller with an active PFC pre-conditioner to deliver a highly integrated solution with minimal external components. TEA175x achieves &lt; 300&amp;nbsp;mW no-load performance, with typical efficiency levels at or beyond 90% over the power supply’s complete operating range. GreenChip III is used in the power adapters of notebook PCs, power supplies for small PCs and all-in-one integrated systems like the iMac.

The GreenChip SR, a secondary control IC for notebook adapters, was launched in 2006 with the TEA176x family.&lt;ref name="eetimes2006"&gt;[http://www.eetimes.com/electronics-products/other/4082890/Philips-chipset-claims-power-efficiency-boost "Philips chipset claims power efficiency boost"], ''EE Times'', March 20, 2006. Retrieved July 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The GreenChip SR family was extended in 2009 with the TEA179x family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://213.201.145.102/news/content/file_1525.html |title= NXP unveils suite of efficient power supply products including GreenChip PFC and SR controllers| access-date= 2017-04-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810173043/http://213.201.145.102/news/content/file_1525.html |archivedate=August 10, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GreenChip SR is a control circuit for the output stage of power supplies. By replacing diode rectifiers with active MOSFET rectification, GreenChip SR enabled typical loss reductions of 20-30%.

In 2006, Philips also introduced the GreenChip PC, a chipset featuring a new topology designed to increase the overall efficiency of [[desktop PC]] power supplies to more than 80 percent; at the time, most desktop PC power supplies were only 60 to 70 percent efficient when operating. The GreenChip PC was based on patented Philips technology integrating the standby supply into the main converter, reducing the number of external components required.&lt;ref name="eetimes2006"/&gt;

Addressing 10-70 W class power supplies, the TEA173x GreenChip Low Power generation was launched towards the end of 2009. The TEA173x targeted high volume computing (netbook, printer, monitor) and consumer (STB, DVD, Blu-ray, audio) applications. The GreenChip Low Power series enabled efficiencies of up to 90% and standby performances of less than 100&amp;nbsp;mW.

GreenChip Resonant ICs such as the TEA1713, launched in early 2010, extend the higher end of the Greenchip portfolio. They feature a [[resonant converter]] capable of being applied from 90-600 W and delivering efficiencies of over 95%. They are suitable for a broad range of applications including LCD TV and high efficiency computing power like high density travel adapters.

2010 also saw the advent of GreenChip ICs for lamps. These enable the creation of compact energy-saving [[Compact fluorescent lamp|CFL]] bulbs that resemble the familiar incandescent bulbs. GreenChip lighting ICs offer a number of benefits over other solutions including greater reliability (extended lifetimes), faster start-up, dimming capability and low noise operation.

==Technology==
The first and second generation of GreenChip ICs used a combination of High Voltage [[DMOS]] and more dense [[BiCMOS]] for control in multi-chip configurations. In the second generation and after, BiCMOS was replaced by the A-BCD2 (Advanced Bipolar CMOS DMOS 2) process.

Process steps for a happy path are also used in the context of a [[use case]]. In contrast to the happy path, process steps for alternate paths and exception paths may also be documented.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Happy path testing is a well-defined [[test case]] using known input, which executes without exception and produces an expected output.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

Happy day (or sunny day) scenario and golden path are synonyms for happy path.{{cn|date=July 2016}}

In use case analysis, there is only one happy path, but there may be any number of additional alternate path scenarios which are all valid optional outcomes. If valid alternatives exist, the happy path is then identified as the default or most likely positive alternative. The analysis may also show one or more exception paths. An exception path is taken as the result of a fault condition. Use cases and the resulting interactions are commonly modeled in graphical languages such as the [[Unified Modeling Language]] or [[SysML]].{{cn|date=July 2016}}

There is no agreed name for the opposite of happy paths: they may be known as sad paths, bad paths, or exception paths.

[[File:Humphrey visual field.JPG|thumb|Figure 1 - Humphrey Field Analyser|306x306px]]
'''Humphrey field analyser''' ('''HFA'''), is a tool for measuring the human [[visual field]], it is used by [[Optometry|optometrists]], [[Orthoptics|orthoptists]] and [[Ophthalmology|ophthalmologists]], particularly for detecting [[Monocular vision|monocular visual field]].&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landers|first1=John|last2=Sharma|first2=Alok|last3=Goldberg|first3=Ivan|last4=Graham|first4=Stuart L|title=A comparison of visual field sensitivities between the Medmont automated perimeter and the Humphrey field analyzer|journal=Clinical &amp; Experimental Ophthalmology|date=February 2010|doi=10.1111/j.1442-9071.2010.02246.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The results of the Analyser identify the type of vision defect. Therefore, it provides information regarding the location of any disease processes or lesion(s) throughout the [[visual pathway]]. This guides and contributes to the diagnosis of the condition affecting the patient's vision. These results are stored and used for monitoring the progression of [[vision loss]] and the patient's condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kedar|first1=Sachin|last2=Ghate|first2=Deepta|last3=Corbett|first3=JamesJ|title=Visual fields in neuro-ophthalmology|journal=Indian Journal of Ophthalmology|date=2011|volume=59|issue=2|pages=103|doi=10.4103/0301-4738.77013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

The Analyser can be used for screening, monitoring and assisting in the diagnosis of certain conditions. There are numerous testing protocols to select, based on the purpose. The first number denotes the extent of the field measured on the temporal side, from the centre of fixation, in degrees. The '-2' represents the pattern of the points tested.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kanski|first1=J. J.,|last2=Bowling|first2=B.|title=Clinical Ophthalmology|date=2011|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

The above tests can be performed in either SITA-Standard or SITA-Fast. SITA-Fast is a quicker method of testing. It produces similar results compared to SITA-Standard, however repeatability is questionable and it is slightly less sensitive&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Szatmáry|first1=Gabriella|title=Can Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm Fast Perimetry Be Used as an Alternative to Goldmann Perimetry in Neuro-ophthalmic Practice?|journal=Archives of Ophthalmology|date=1 September 2002|volume=120|issue=9|pages=1162|doi=10.1001/archopht.120.9.1162}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The ''Test Library'' houses additional tests for more specific purposes such as the following:
 
*''Esterman'' – Used to test the functionality of a patient's vision to ensure they are safe to drive, as requested by VicRoads, Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vic Driving Vision Standards|url=http://www.optometry.org.au/vic/practice-info/driving-vision-standards.aspx|website=Optometry Australia|publisher=Optometry Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visual impairment|url=https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/licences/medical-conditions-and-driving/medical-conditions/visual-impairment|website=VicRoads|publisher=State Government of Victoria|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''SITA SWAP'': Short Wavelength Automated Perimetry (SWAP) is used for detection of early glaucomatous loss&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Method of assessment==
[[File:Trial lens.png|thumb|Figure 2 - Chin Rest and Lens Holder|175x175px]]The Analyser test takes approximately 5–8 minutes, excluding patient set up. There are multiple steps which need to be done before commencement of the test to ensure reliable results are attained.
 
The test type and eye are firstly selected and the patient's details are entered, including their [[refractive error]]. The Analyser will provide a lens strength and type (either [[Lens (optics)|spherical]] and/or [[Cylindrical lens|cylindrical]]), if required for the test. In these instances, wire-rimmed trial lenses are generally used, with the cylindrical [[Lens (optics)|lens]] placed closest to the patient so the axis is easily read. The clinician can alter the fixation targets as per necessary (see Fixation Targets for advice).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Artes|first1=Paul H|title=Humphrey Field Analyzer II-i series User Manual|date=2012|publisher=Carl Zeiss Meditec|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/112839436/Humphrey-Field-Analyzer-Manual-5-1-for-Series-II-instruments#scribd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before putting the patient onto the machine, the requirements of the test itself are clearly explained. The patient is instructed to maintain fixation on the central target and is given a buzzer to only press when they see a light stimulus. It is not possible to see every light and some lights appear brighter/duller and slower/faster than others. The eye not being tested is patched and the room lights are dimmed prior to commencement of the test.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The patient is positioned appropriately and comfortably against the forehead rest and chin rest. Minor adjustments to the head position are made to centre the pupil on the display screen to allow eye monitoring throughout the test. The lens holder should be as close to the patient's eye as possible to avoid artefacts (see Disadvantages for possible artefacts).

It is important for the patient to blink normally, relax and maintain concentration throughout the test. This will increase the reliability of results.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[File:Fixation targets.jpg|thumb|Figure 3 - Fixation targets
''left:'' central, ''middle'': small diamond, ''right:''  large diamond
|225x225px]]

===How it works===

The Analyser projects a series of white light stimuli of varying intensities (brightness), throughout a uniformly illuminated bowl. The patient uses a handheld button that they press to indicate when they see a light. This assesses the [[retina]]'s ability to detect a stimulus at specific points within the visual field. This is called retinal sensitivity and is recorded in 'decibels' (dB).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
 
The Analyser currently utilises the [[Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm|Swedish Interactive Thresholding Algorithm]] (SITA); a formula which allows the fastest and most accurate visual field assessment to date. Results are then compared against an age-matched database which highlights unusual and suspicious vision loss, potentially caused by [[pathology]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bengtsson|first1=Boel|last2=Olsson|first2=Jonny|last3=Heijl|first3=Anders|last4=Rootzén|first4=Holger|title=A new generation of algorithms for computerized threshold perimetry, SITA|journal=Acta Ophthalmologica Scandinavica|date=27 May 2009|volume=75|issue=4|pages=368–375|doi=10.1111/j.1600-0420.1997.tb00392.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fixation targets===

There are different targets a patient can fixate on during the test. They are chosen on the basis of the patient's conditions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; 
 
*'''Central target''': Yellow light in the bowl's centre
*'''Small diamond''': For patients who cannot see the central target such as those with [[macular degeneration]]. The patient looks into the centre of the four lights
*'''Large diamond''':  For patients who cannot see the above two&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Interpreting results==

===Reliability indices===
Issues of reliability are critical in result interpretation. These include, but not limited to, the patient losing concentration, closing their eyes or pressing the buzzer too frequently. Monitoring fixation is made visible via the display screen and gaze tracker, located at the bottom of the printout. The degree of reliability is determined by the reliability indices located on the printout (Fig. 4). These are assessed first and allow the examiner to determine if the end results are reliable. These indices include:
*'''Fixation Losses:''' Recorded when a patient responds to a stimulus that is projected on to area of their [[Blind spot (vision)|blind spot]]. Fixation losses exceeding 20%, are denoted with an 'XX' next to the score, and deems results unreliable&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
*'''False Positives:''' Recorded when a patient responds when there is no stimulus present. This patient is often referred to as 'buzzer happy'. False positives exceeding 15% are denoted with an 'XX' and results are considered unreliable. This may indicate that the patient is anxious and concerned about missing targets&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
*'''False Negatives:'''Recorded when a patient does not respond to brighter stimuli where a duller stimulus has already been seen. High false negative scores indicate that the patient is fatigued, inattentive, a [[Malingering|malingerer]] or has genuine significant visual field loss.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Literature presents various percentages regarding reliability. However, majority of the literature defines that false negatives exceeding approximately 30% deem results unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bengtsson|first1=B|last2=Heijl|first2=A|title=False-negative responses in glaucoma perimetry: indicators of patient performance or test reliability?|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology and Visual Science|date=2000|volume=41|issue=8|pages=2201–2204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKendrick|first1=Allison M.|last2=Denniss|first2=Jonathan|last3=Turpin|first3=Andrew|title=Response times across the visual field: Empirical observations and application to threshold determination|journal=Vision Research|date=August 2014|volume=101|pages=1–10|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2014.04.013|pmid=24802595}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Johnson|first1=Chris A|last2=Keltner|first2=John L|last3=Cello|first3=Kimberly E|last4=Edwards|first4=Mary|last5=Kass|first5=Michael A|last6=Gordon|first6=Mae O|last7=Budenz|first7=Donald L|last8=Gaasterland|first8=Douglas E|last9=Werner|first9=Elliot|title=Baseline visual field characteristics in the ocular hypertension treatment study|journal=Ophthalmology|date=March 2002|volume=109|issue=3|pages=432–437|doi=10.1016/S0161-6420(01)00948-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reliability is determined, the remaining data is assessed.

====Numerical Display====
Represents raw values of patient's retinal sensitivity at specific retinal points in dB. Higher numbers equate to higher retinal sensitivities. Sensitivity is greatest in the central field and decreases towards the periphery. Normal values are approximately 30&amp;nbsp;dB while recorded values of &lt;0&amp;nbsp;dB equate to no sensitivity measured.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wyatt|first1=Harry J.|last2=Dul|first2=Mitchell W.|last3=Swanson|first3=William H.|title=Variability of visual field measurements is correlated with the gradient of visual sensitivity|journal=Vision Research|date=March 2007|volume=47|issue=7|pages=925–936|doi=10.1016/j.visres.2006.12.012|pmid=17320924|pmc=2094527}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Grey Scale====
A graphical representation of the numerical display, allowing for easy interpretation of the field loss. Lower sensitivities are indicated by darker areas and higher sensitivities are represented with a lighter tone.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This scale is used to demonstrate vision changes to the patient but is not used for diagnostic purposes.

====Total Deviation====
The ''numerical total'' demonstrates the difference between measured values and population age-norm values at specific retinal points.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Negative values indicate lower than normal sensitivity
*Positive indicates higher
*0 equals no change&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
The ''statistical display'' (located below the numerical total) demonstrates the percentage of the normal population who measure below the patient's value at a specific retinal point. The '''probability display''' provides this percentage a key for interpreting the statistical display.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; For example, the darkest square in the key represents that &lt;0.5% of the population would also attain this result, indicating that the vision loss is extensive. The Total Deviation plots highlight diffuse vision loss (i.e. the total departure from the age-norm).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cubbidge|first1=R|title=Essentials of visual field assessment|journal=The Optician|date=2012|volume=243|issue=6356|pages=14–16|url=http://search.proquest.com.ez.library.latrobe.edu.au/docview/1027770159/fulltext/67AC788AA474119PQ/3?accountid=12001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pattern Deviation====
Provides a numerical total and statistical display as the Total Deviation plot. However, it accounts for general reductions of vision caused by media opacities (e.g. [[cataract]]), uncorrected refractive error, reductions in sensitivity due to age and pupil [[miosis]]. This highlights focal loss only (i.e. vision loss suspected from only pathological processes).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Therefore, this is the main plot referred to when making a diagnosis. The Pattern Deviation plot is generally lighter than the Total Deviation because of the factors accounted for.

==== Global Indices ====
[[File:Visual-field-loss.pdf|thumb|Figure 5 - Types of Visual Field Defects (right eye)&lt;br /&gt;A: Central scotoma&lt;br /&gt;B: Centrocaecal scotoma&lt;br /&gt;C: Nasal Step &lt;br /&gt;D: Superior Arcuate &lt;br /&gt;E: Nasal Wedge defect &lt;br /&gt;F: Superior Nasal quadrantanopia &lt;br /&gt;G: Superior Altitudinal &lt;br /&gt;H: Nasal hemianopia &lt;br /&gt;I: Enlarged Blind Spot with Paracentral scotoma located 15 degrees superiorly]] 
These provide a statistical summary of the field with one number. Although not used for initial diagnosis, they are essential for monitoring glaucoma progression.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; They include: 
*'''Mean Deviation (MD):''' Derived from the Total Deviation and represents the overall mean departure from the age-corrected norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Yi-Hao|last2=Wu|first2=Jian-Nan|last3=Chen|first3=Jiann-Torng|last4=Lu|first4=Da-Wen|title=Comparison of the Humphrey Field Analyser and Humphrey Matrix Perimeter for the Evaluation of Glaucoma Patients|journal=Ophthalmologica|date=2008|volume=222|issue=6|pages=400–407|doi=10.1159/000154203}}&lt;/ref&gt; A negative value indicates field loss, while a positive value indicates that the field is above average.  A P value is provided if the global indices are abnormal. It provides a statistical representation of the population. For example, P &lt;2% means that less than 2% of the population have vision loss worse than measured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drake|first1=Robert L. Stamper, Marc F. Lieberman, Michael V.|last2=Lieberman|first2=Marc F|last3=Drake|first3=Michael V|title=Becker-Shaffer's diagnosis and therapy of the glaucomas.|date=2009|publisher=Mosby/Elsevier|location=[Edinburgh]|isbn=978-0-323-02394-8|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Pattern Standard Deviation (PSD):''' Derived from the Pattern Deviation and thus highlights focal loss only. A high PSD, indicating irregular vision, is therefore a more useful indicator of glaucomatous progression, than the MD&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====Glaucoma Hemifield Test (GHT)====
Provides assessment of the visual field where glaucomatous damage is often seen. It compares five corresponding and mirrored areas in the superior and inferior [[visual fields]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ishiyama|first1=Y.|last2=Murata|first2=H.|last3=Mayama|first3=C.|last4=Asaoka|first4=R.|title=An Objective Evaluation of Gaze Tracking in Humphrey Perimetry and the Relation With the Reproducibility of Visual Fields: A Pilot Study in Glaucoma|journal=Investigative Ophthalmology &amp; Visual Science|date=11 November 2014|volume=55|issue=12|pages=8149–8152|doi=10.1167/iovs.14-15541|pmid=25389198}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of either 'Outside Normal Limits' (significant difference in superior and inferior fields), 'Borderline' (suspicious differences) or 'Within Normal Limits' (no differences) is only considered when the patient has, or is a suspect for, glaucoma.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is only available in 30-2 and 24-2 Analyser protocol.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

====Visual Field Index (VFI)====
The VFI reflects [[retinal ganglion cell]] loss and function, as a percentage, with central points weighted more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Horton|first1=M.|title=10 tips for improving visual fields: perimetry may seem like second nature, but these recommendations can help you obtain better results by refining your understanding of the technology|journal=Review of Optometry|date=2015|volume=152|issue=4|page=62|url=http://go.galegroup.com.ez.library.latrobe.edu.au/ps/retrieve.do?sort=RELEVANCE&amp;docType=Article&amp;tabID=T002&amp;prodId=EAIM&amp;searchId=R1&amp;resultListType=RESULT_LIST&amp;searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&amp;contentSegment=&amp;currentPosition=1&amp;searchResultsType=SingleTab&amp;inPS=true&amp;userGroupName=latrobe&amp;docId=GALE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is expressed as a percentage of visual function; with 100% being a perfect age-adjusted visual field and 0% represents a perimetrically blind field. The pattern deviation probability plot (or total deviation probability plot when MD is worse than -20dB) is used to identify abnormal points and age corrected sensitivity at each point is calculated using total deviation numerical map. VFI is a reliable index on which glaucomatous visual field severity staging can be based. &lt;ref&gt;Kuzhuppilly N, Patil S, Dev S, Deo A. Reliability of Visual Field Index in Staging Glaucomatous Visual Field Damage. Journal of Clinical &amp; Diagnostic Research. 2018 Jun 1;12(6): NC05-NC08&lt;/ref&gt;

The shaded pattern of vision loss provided on the Pattern Deviation plot allows for diagnosis of the type of vision loss present. This contributes to other clinical findings in the diagnosis of certain conditions. The types of vision loss and associated conditions are not described in the extent of this article, however Figure 5 provides typical examples of visual field loss seen. Refer to [[#See also]]  for more information.

==Advantages and Disadvantages==

=== Advantages ===
* Provides a comprehensive visual field assessment and ensures reliable results&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Compares patient's data to age-matched populations&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Distinguishes focal from diffuse vision loss&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
*[[File:Artefacts2.jpg|thumb|Figure 6 - Artefacts (right eye)&lt;br /&gt; A: Aphakia &lt;br /&gt; B: Rim artefarct &lt;br /&gt; C: Chin slip&lt;br /&gt; D: Lens position &lt;br /&gt; E: Corneal opacity &lt;br /&gt; F: Keratoconus &lt;br /&gt; G: Ptosis &lt;br /&gt; H: Pupil Miosis - 1mm&lt;br /&gt; I: Pupil Miosis - 3mm]]Can be used for patients who are wheelchair users, hearing impaired, have postural and fixation problems and/or very low visual acuity&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Provides a baseline measurement
* Simple for the examiner to perform and interpret

===Disadvantages===
*Requires a higher level of patient understanding and concentration compared to other visual field tests&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
* Time-consuming
* Learning effect: new patients improve as more tests are performed due to understanding of the test conditions. Consider the third test as the baseline result&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Saigal|first1=Rahul|title=Learning Effects and Artefacts in Automated Perimetry|url=http://www.optometry.co.uk/uploads/exams/articles/cet_11_nov_2011_saigal.pdf|website=Association Of Optometry Ireland}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Potential for artefacts (i.e. uncharacteristic vision loss) (fig. 6). Below is a list of possible artefacts and a representation of how they may appear. These can however, be managed with correct patient setup.
** Uncorrected refractive error and [[aphakia]]; significant decrease in visual field sensitivity&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

{{iPhone models}}

The '''iPhone''' is the first [[smartphone]] model designed and marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] After years of rumors and speculation, it was officially announced on January 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dolan, Brian |title=Timeline of Apple "iPhone" Rumors (1999–Present) |url=http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/timeline-apple-iphone-rumors-1999-present |accessdate=February 17, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415055303/http://www.fiercewireless.com/story/timeline-apple-iphone-rumors-1999-present |archivedate=April 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was later released in the United States on June 29, 2007. It featured [[quad-band]] [[GSM]] cellular connectivity with [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] support for data transfer.

On June 9, 2008, Apple announced its successor, the [[iPhone 3G]]. After this announcement, the first-generation iPhone became referred to by some sources as the '''iPhone  2G''' due to the fact that it was the only iPhone to  solely support 2G-speed networks. The original iPhone has not received software updates from Apple since iPhone OS (now iOS) [[iPhone OS 3#3.1.3|3.1.3]].

Since June 2013, the original iPhone is considered "vintage" by some service providers in the US, and "obsolete" in Apple retail stores and all other regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://9to5mac.com/2013/04/29/original-iphone-will-soon-reach-obsolete-status-in-apple-retail-stores/ |title=Original iPhone will soon reach ‘obsolete’ status in Apple Retail Stores |author=Michael Steeber |date=April 29, 2013 |website=[[9to5Mac]] |accessdate=2013-05-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130430171417/http://9to5mac.com/2013/04/29/original-iphone-will-soon-reach-obsolete-status-in-apple-retail-stores/ |archivedate=April 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple does not service vintage or obsolete products, and replacement parts for obsolete products are not available to service providers.

==History==
In 2005, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived an idea of using a [[multi-touch]] [[touchscreen]] to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display. He decided that it needed to have a triple layered touch screen, a very new and high tech technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], the same as a [[tablet computer]]. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Peter |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update |publisher=[[Macworld]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127110536/http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its [[user interface]], he conceived a second idea of implementing the technology onto a mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Apple created the device during a secretive and unprecedented collaboration with [[AT&amp;T Mobility|AT&amp;T]], formerly [[Cingular Wireless]]. The development cost of the collaboration was estimated to have been $150 million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Six weeks before the iPhone was to be released, the plastic screen was replaced with a glass one, after Jobs was upset that the screen of the prototype he was carrying in his pocket had been scratched by his keys. The quick switch led to a bidding process for a manufacturing contractor that was won by [[Foxconn]], which had just opened up a new wing of its [[Shenzhen]] factory complex specifically for this bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/business/apple-america-and-a-squeezed-middle-class.html|title=Apple, America and a Squeezed Middle Class|last=Duhigg|first=Charles|date=January 21, 2012|work=[[New York Times]]|access-date=September 4, 2018|last2=Bradsher|first2=Keith|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
During release, the iPhone was marketed as running "OS X". The name of the operating system was revealed as [[iPhone OS]] with the release of the [[iOS SDK|iPhone SDK]]. The original iPhone supported three major versions of the operating system before it was discontinued: iPhone OS 1, 2, and 3. However, the full iPhone OS 3 feature set was not supported, and the last update the original iPhone received was iPhone OS 3.1.3
===Software history===
{{See also|iOS|iPhone OS 1|iPhone OS 2|iPhone OS 3}}
The original operating system for the original iPhone was '''iPhone OS 1''', marketed as OS X, and included Visual Voicemail, multi-touch gestures, HTML email, Safari web browser, threaded text messaging, and [[YouTube]]. However, many features like MMS, apps, and [[cut, copy, and paste|copy and paste]] were not supported at release, leading hackers [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] their phones to add these features. Official software updates slowly added these features.

'''iPhone OS 2''' was released on July 11, 2008, around the same time as the release of the [[iPhone 3G]], and introduced third-party applications, [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]] support, push e-mail,{{fact|date=March 2018}} and other enhancements.

'''iPhone OS 3''' was released on June 17, 2009, and introduced copy and paste functionality, [[Spotlight (software)|Spotlight search]] for the [[SpringBoard|home screen]], and new features for the YouTube app. iPhone OS 3 was available for the original iPhone as well as the iPhone 3G. However, not all features of iPhone OS 3 were supported on the original iPhone.

iPhone OS 3.1.3 was the last version of iPhone OS (now iOS) to be released for the original iPhone.

'''James Leroy Acord''' (19 October 1944 – 9 January 2011) was an artist who worked directly with [[radioactive]] materials. He attempted to create [[sculpture]] and events that probed the history of [[nuclear engineering]] and asked questions about the long-term storage of [[nuclear waste]]. For 15 years he lived in [[Richland, Washington]], the dormitory town for the [[Hanford Site|Hanford Nuclear Reservation]], at one time home to nine nuclear reactors and five plutonium-processing complexes and the most contaminated nuclear site in the United States. His major ambition while there was to build a "nuclear Stonehenge" on a heavily contaminated area of land in the site, incorporating twelve uranium breeder-blanket assemblies. 

Acord was the only private individual in the world licensed to own and handle radioactive materials, and acquired [[nuclear fuel rod]]s containing [[depleted uranium]] from the completed but not operated German [[SNR-300]] breeder reactor to use as artistic materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ans.org/pubs/magazines/nn/docs/2002-11-3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; He had his nuclear license number tattooed onto his neck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/blogs/culturelab/2011/05/an-artist-who-had-a-radioactive-imagination.html|title=New Scientist|publisher=|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke on art and nuclear science at both art&lt;ref&gt;James Acord at [http://theinfluencers.org/en/james-acord "The Influencers"] conference, February 4th, 2010 (Barcelona, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt; and nuclear industry events in the US and the UK and organised many forums that brought together artists, activists and nuclear industry experts. 

He was profiled by Philip Schuyler for ''[[The New Yorker]]'' &lt;ref&gt;Schuyler, Philip [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1991/10/14/1991_10_14_059_TNY_CARDS_000356911 "Moving to Richland I"], ''The New Yorker'', October 14, 1991, accessed January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schuyler, Philip [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1991/10/21/1991_10_21_062_TNY_CARDS_000359576 "Moving to Richland II"], ''The New Yorker'', October 21, 1991, accessed January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michaud, Jon [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1991/10/21/1991_10_21_062_TNY_CARDS_000359576 "Postscript: James Acord, Alchemist for the Nuclear Age"], ''The New Yorker'', January 20, 2011, accessed January 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991, and was the inspiration for the character of Reever in ''The Book of Ash'' &lt;ref&gt;Flint, James.

'''Repetitive strain injuries''' (RSI) are to the body's muscles, joints, tendons, ligaments, bones, or nerves caused by repetitive movements. Such injuries are more likely if the movements required force or were accompanied by vibrations, compression, or the maintenance of sustained or awkward positions. Prolonged use of computer equipment can result in upper limb disorders, notably in the wrist or the back. RSIs are a subset of [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s.

This article discusses and lists some '''specialized [[Application software|software]]''' that is available to aid individuals avoid injury or manage current discomfort/injury associated with computer use.

==Software categories==
Software for RSIs generally address these functional categories:
* Break reminder&amp;nbsp;– Some tools remind you to take breaks based on factors like elapsed time, how much/intensely you are working, natural rest patterns, times of day, and more.
* Activity Mitigation&amp;nbsp;– Some tools let you reduce the amount you need to type or mouse (e.g. [[speech recognition]] tools, automatic clicking tools, hotkey/[[Macro (computer science)|macro]] tools).
* Tracking&amp;nbsp;– Some tools track information like how long you work each day, break-taking patterns, repetitions (e.g. keystrokes, mouseclicks). Some tools have much more sophisticated statistics, including predictive risk assessments based on fairly sophisticated and research-based methodologies. Some tools also include discomfort assessments and reporting tools to help you find associative patterns between objectively collected statistics and subjectively reported discomfort information.
* Networking&amp;nbsp;– Some tools are able to handle multiple-computer use (e.g. for profiles settings or for aggregating usage statistics) via networked data, including the ability to handle intermittent connectivity.
* Training&amp;nbsp;– Some tools include a training component with information on topics including: workstation setup, body positioning, work-efficiency tips, psycho-social information, and more.

===Break reminders===
This can be an important component for many users. Considerations for selecting a tool include the mechanism the tools uses to decide when to alert you to take a break, how it tells you to take a break, and how flexibly the tool can meet your particular needs.

Many tools are simple timers (e.g. remind me to rest every 60 minutes). That may work well if your job requires constant and consistent computer work, but can be irritating if you don't work constantly on the computer because breaks will often be suggested when you weren't working much prior to the suggestion. Other tools consider your natural rests and delay break suggestions accordingly. Some tools also consider your activity, and will suggest breaks sooner/later during periods of intense/light activity. These tools can be less frustrating to people whose computer work is interspersed with other activity throughout the day.

The various mechanisms for reminding you to take a break can include visual and audio indicators, workflow limiters (e.g. popup windows, screen dimmers/blankers), and much more. The best tools allow you to select which of these mechanisms you want to use.

Flexibility is important since each person has different needs. Some tools have extensive customization capability that allows you to configure exactly how and when breaks will be suggested. Features to enforce breaks can also be helpful to people who want to take breaks but whose personalities are such that they have a hard time stopping work. Some tools have advanced features like the ability to block break suggestions during some activities (e.g. when showing a presentation, or in full-screen mode).

===Activity mitigation===
Applications with these tools seek to mitigate the impact of particular activities by either changing or reducing the associated exposure. This could involve changing or reducing input device use, improving a user-interface to reduce stress, speeding up a process to reduce the time a user needs to be at the computer, etc.

An example of a tool that changes the impact would be [[speech recognition]]. Speech recognition replaces keyboard (and sometimes mouse) input with vocal input. This type of solution can be very helpful at reducing some types of strain, but it's important to recognize that another significant strain may be created.

An example of a tool that reduces the impact would be a hotkey tool or automatic clicking tool. These tools ideally reduce the number of keystrokes and mouse clicks that a user need do to accomplish a particular task.
You can find a list of software names in the [[:Category:Automation software]].

An example of a tool that reduces the impact would also be breathing scrolling. Breathing scrolling requires no mouse or keyboard for scrolling. It uses microphone to scroll websites. 

A tip, in order to use the mouse less often in the software [[Menu (computing)|menus]], is to learn the [[keyboard shortcut]]s.

==Partial list of solutions==
This is an alphabetical list, This list does not rank application quality, nor is it complete. Many other applications exist. A "pages-of-Google-hits" score is provided with the reference to each program's home page.&lt;ref group="lower-alpha" name="hits"&gt;The number in hits in each application reference tells how many pages of hits [[Google]] reported for the applications's URL on the date shown. This number was generated by typing the URL in quotes into Google, then scrolling to the last page (10 hits/page).&lt;/ref&gt;

;AntiRSI
: AntiRSI is a program for OS X that helps prevent RSI (repetitive strain injury) and other computer related stress. It does so by forcing you to take regular breaks, yet without getting in the way. It also detects natural breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.sabi.net/nriley/software/#antirsi |title=AntiRSI }}&lt;/ref&gt;
; Auto Mouse
: AutoMouse software lets users click their mouse using keyboard hotkeys. By eliminating the need to click the mouse altogether, the strain associated with clicking is also eliminated. For highly repetitive form-based computer work, AutoMouse can also click the mouse when the cursor stops moving (e.g resting a cursor on a button will click that button). As a result of its patent-pending design, there are no restrictions on mouse gestures such as drag-and-drop and repetitive-clicking. The mouse remains fully functional to the user but without the need to physically click the mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sphere10.com/AutoMouse |title=AutoMouse |publisher=Sphere 10 Software |accessdate=22 October 2011 |postscript=. 70 Google hits on 18 August 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; AT Mouse
: AT Mouse allows for PC users to use the keyboard to navigate the mouse pointer in a very efficient way using the keyboard keys. This way the use of a regular or dedicated mouse device is avoided, and the typing posture may be optimized for keyboard usage. As a result RSI symptoms can be avoided or reduced. The solution is also targeting users that only wants to boost productivity, as well as users with reduced dexterity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.activetemplates.com/ |title=AT Mouse |publisher=ActiveTemplates |accessdate=22 October 2011 |postscript=. 7 Google hits on 18 August 2011.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Medical gloves''' are disposable [[glove]]s used during medical examinations and procedures to help prevent cross-contamination between caregivers and patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/ppe/gloves.html |title=Medical Gloves and Gowns |accessdate=2010-03-10 |quote=Medical gloves are disposable gloves used during medical procedures. Medical gloves help prevent contamination between caregivers and patients. Some are designed to prevent contact with certain chemotherapy drugs. Medical gloves include examination gloves, surgical gloves, and medical gloves for handling chemotherapy agents (chemotherapy gloves). These gloves are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA makes sure that manufacturers of these devices meet performance criteria such as leak resistance, tear resistance, etc. |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Medical gloves are made of different polymers including [[latex]], [[nitrile rubber]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] and [[neoprene]]; they come unpowdered, or powdered with [[cornstarch]] to lubricate the gloves, making them easier to put on the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ansell.eu/medical/index.cfm?page=manu_ppf_powder&amp;lang=EN |title=Glove manufacturing |publisher=Ansell.eu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004025640/http://ansell.eu/medical/index.cfm?page=manu_ppf_powder&amp;lang=EN |archivedate=2011-10-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Cornstarch replaced tissue-irritating [[Lycopodium powder]] and talc, but even cornstarch can impede healing if it gets into tissues (as during surgery). As such, unpowdered gloves are used more often during surgery and other sensitive procedures. Special manufacturing processes are used to compensate for the lack of powder. 

There are two main types of medical gloves: examination and surgical.  Surgical gloves have more precise sizing with a better precision and sensitivity and are made to a higher standard.  Examination gloves are available as either sterile or non-sterile, while surgical gloves are generally sterile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/oralhealth/infectioncontrol/faq/protective_equipment.htm |title=Personal Protective Equipment FAQ |accessdate=2013-06-08 |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Caroline Hampton]] became the chief nurse of the operating room when [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] opened in 1889.&lt;ref name=lathan&gt;{{cite journal | author=S.

The first disposable latex medical gloves were manufactured in 1964 by [[Ansell Limited|Ansell]]. They based the production on the technique for making [[condoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/instruments/latex_gloves.html |title=100 Years of Australian Innovation - latex gloves |accessdate=2010-03-07 |quote=In 1945, Ansell designed and built the first automatic dipping machine, which produced 300 dozen pairs of synthetic gloves in eight hours. Ansell introduced disposable surgical gloves in 1964, which won the company an Export Award in 1967. International expansion over the next two decades saw Ansell become the world's largest producer of latex gloves for household and medical use. |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These gloves have a range of  clinical uses ranging from dealing with human excrement to dental applications.

Criminals have also been known to wear medical gloves during commission of crimes. These gloves are often chosen because their thinness and tight fit allow for dexterity. However because of the thinness of these gloves, fingerprints may actually pass through the material as [[glove prints]], thus transferring the wearer's prints onto the surface touched or handled.&lt;ref name=" Ramotowski"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Ramotowski|title=Lee and Gaensslen's Advances in Fingerprint Technology, Third Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lQnLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171|date=2012-10-18|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-8837-3|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants of the [[Watergate burglaries]] infamously wore rubber surgical gloves in an effort to hide their fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwatergate.htm |title=Watergate |publisher=Spartacus.Schoolnet.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203073845/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAwatergate.htm |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sizing==
Generally speaking, examination gloves are sized in XS, S, M and L. Some brands may offer size XL. Surgical gloves are usually sized more precisely since they are worn for a much longer period of time and require exceptional dexterity. The sizing of surgical gloves are based on the measured length across the palm in [[inch|inches]], at a level slightly above the thumb's sewn. Typical sizing ranges from 5.5 to 9.0 at an increment of 0.5. Some brands may also offer size 5.0 which is particularly relevant to women practitioners. First-time users of surgical gloves may take some time to find the right size and brand that suit their hand geometry the most&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalglove.net/surgeon-gloves/size-chart.php|title=Surgical Gloves Size Chart|date= |accessdate=2017-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;. People with a thicker palm may need a size larger than the measurement and vice versa.

Research on a group of American surgeons found that the most common surgical glove size for men is 7.0, followed by 6.5; and for women 6.0 followed by 5.5&lt;ref name=pmid15100896&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15100896| year = 2004| author1 = Berguer R| first1 = R| journal = Surgical Endoscopy| issue = 18(3)| pages = 508-512| last2 = Hreljac| first2 = A| doi = 10.1007/s00464-003-8824-3| title = The relationship between hand size and difficulty using surgical instruments: a survey of 726 laparoscopic surgeons}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Powdered gloves==
To facilitate donning of gloves, powders have been used as lubricants. Early powders derived from [[pine]]s or [[club moss]] were found to be toxic.&lt;ref name=lowes&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/860722?nlid=102645_3901&amp;src=wnl_newsalrt_160321_MSCPEDIT&amp;uac=28013DZ&amp;impID=1031379&amp;faf=1| author=Robert Lowes |title= FDA Proposes Ban of Powdered Medical Gloves |publisher=[[Medscape]] |date=March 21, 2016| accessdate=March 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Talcum powder]] was used for decades but linked to postoperative [[granuloma]] and scar formation. [[Corn starch]], another agent used as lubricant, was also found to have potential side effects such as inflammatory reactions and granuloma and scar formation.&lt;ref name=lowes/&gt;

===Elimination of powdered medical gloves===

With the availability of non-powdered medical gloves that were easy to don, calls for the elimination of powdered gloves became louder. By 2016, healthcare systems in Germany and the United Kingdom had eliminated their use.&lt;ref name=lowes/&gt; In March 2016, the [[FDA]] issued a proposal to ban their medical use as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm491466.htm| author= |title=FDA proposes ban on most powdered medical gloves| publisher=FDA| date=March 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passed a rule on December 19, 2016 banning all powdered gloves intended for medical use. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ada.org/en/publications/ada-news/2016-archive/december/fda-bans-most-powdered-gloves RET. JAN 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The rule became effective on January 18, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/19/2016-30382/banned-devices-powdered-surgeons-gloves-powdered-patient-examination-gloves-and-absorbable-powder RET. JAN 10, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Powder-free medical gloves are used in medical [[cleanroom]] environments, where the need for cleanliness is often similar to that in a sensitive medical environment.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Chlorination===
To make them easier to don without the use of powder, gloves can be treated with [[Chlorine]].  Chlorination affects some of the beneficial properties of latex, but also reduces&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fda.gov/RegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm070925.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the quantity of allergenic latex proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report

==Alternatives to latex==
{{Main|Latex allergy}}
[[File:Protective nitrile gloves.jpg|thumb|155x155px|Nitrile powder free gloves]]
Due to the increasing rate of latex allergy among health professionals, and in the general population, gloves made of non-latex materials such as [[polyvinyl chloride]], [[nitrile rubber]], or [[neoprene]] have become widely used. Chemical processes may be employed to reduce the amount of [[antibody generator|antigenic protein]] in [[Hevea brasiliensis|Hevea]] latex, resulting in alternative natural-rubber-based materials such [[Vytex Natural Rubber Latex]]. However, non-latex gloves have not yet replaced latex gloves in surgical procedures, as gloves made of alternative materials generally do not fully match the fine control or greater sensitivity to touch available with latex surgical gloves. (High-grade [[isoprene]] gloves are the only exception to this rule, as they have the same chemical structure as natural latex rubber.  However, fully [[Synthetic rubber|artificial polyisoprene]]—rather than "hypoallergenic" cleaned natural latex rubber&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm070925.htm |title=User Labeling for Devices that Contain Natural Rubber (21 CFR 801.437); Small Entity Compliance Guide |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]] |date= |accessdate=2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;—is also the most expensive natural latex substitute available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.surgicalglove.net/polyisoprene.html |title=Polyisoprene Surgical Gloves |publisher=SurgicalGlove.net |accessdate= 2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Other high-grade non-latex gloves, such as nitrile gloves, can cost over twice the price of their latex counterparts, a fact that has often prevented switching to these alternative materials in cost-sensitive environments, such as many hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.touchbriefings.com/pdf/952/Korniewicz_Tech%5B1%5D.pdf |title=Advantages and Disadvantages of Non-latex Surgical Gloves |format=PDF |publisher= touchbriefings.com |accessdate= 2012-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrile is a synthetic rubber. It has no latex protein content and is more resistant to tearing. Also it is very resistant to many chemicals and is very safe for people who are allergic to latex protein.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|url = http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/01-12.pdf|website = www.nps.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nitrile gloves are the most durable type of disposable gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What Are Nitrile Gloves? (with pictures)|url = http://www.wisegeek.org/what-are-nitrile-gloves.htm#didyouknowout|accessdate = 2015-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although nitrile gloves are known for their durability, extra care should be taken while handling silver and other highly reactive metals because those substances can react with sulfur, an accelerant in nitrile gloves.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Double gloving ==
'''Double gloving''' is the practice of wearing two layers of medical gloves to reduce the danger of infection from glove failure or penetration of the gloves by sharp objects during medical procedures (For people with [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis]], surgeons use antivirus glove). This should better protect the patient against infections transmitted by the surgeon. A systematic review of the literature has shown double gloving to offer significantly more protection against inner glove perforation in surgical procedures compared to the use of a single glove layer. But it was unclear if there was better protection against infections transmitted by the surgeon.&lt;ref name=pmid16855997&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=16855997|year=2006|author1=Tanner|first1=J|journal=The Cochrane Library|issue=3 |pages=CD003087|last2=Parkinson|first2=H|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD003087.pub2|title=Double gloving to reduce surgical cross-infection}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another systematic review studied if double gloving protected the surgeon better against infections transmitted by the patient. Pooled results of 12 studies (RCTs) with 3,437 participants showed that double gloving reduced the number of perforations in inner gloves with 71% compared to single gloving. On average ten surgeons/nurses involved in 100 operations sustain 172 single gloves perforations but with double gloves only 50 inner gloves would be perforated. This is a considerable reduction of the risk.&lt;ref name=pmid24610769&gt;{{Cite journal |pmid=24610769|year=2014|author1=Mischke |first1=C|journal=The Cochrane Library|issue=3|pages=CD009573|last2=Verbeek|first2=J|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009573.pub2|title=Gloves, extra gloves or special types of gloves for preventing percutaneous exposure injuries in healthcare personnel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5209">'''Micro carbon residue''', commonly known as "MCR" is a laboratory test used to determine the amount of carbonaceous residue formed after [[evaporation]] and [[pyrolysis]] of [[petroleum]] materials under certain conditions. The test is used to provide some indication of a material's [[petroleum coke|coke]]-forming tendencies.&lt;ref name=ASTM&gt;{{cite web|last1=ASTM|title=Standard Test Method for Determination of Carbon Residue (Micro Method)|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D4530.htm|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISO&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Standards Organization|title=ISO 10370:2014.

==Test method==

A quantity of sample is weighed, placed in a glass vial, and heated to 500&amp;nbsp;°C. Heating is performed in a controlled manner, for a specific period of time, and under an inert ([[nitrogen]]) atmosphere . The sample experiences coking reactions, with volatiles formed being swept away by the nitrogen. The carbonaceous residue remaining is reported as a mass percent of the original sample, and noted as “carbon residue (micro).” &lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;

===Special considerations===
*If the test result is expected to be below 0.10% (by mass), prior to performing the test,  the sample can be distilled to produce a 10% (by volume) bottoms.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISO /&gt;
*If the sample contains [[ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]-forming constituents and/or non-volatile additives, these will add to the carbon residue value, and be included as part of the total reported carbon residue value.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISO /&gt;
*In [[diesel fuel]], the presence of alkyl nitrates, such as [[amyl nitrate]], hexyl nitrate, or octyl nitrate, causes a higher carbon residue value as compared to untreated fuel. This may lead to erroneous conclusions as to the coke-forming tendencies of the fuel.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt;&lt;ref name=ISO /&gt;

==Applications==

Micro carbon residue offers the same range of applicability as the test to which it is equivalent, Conradson Carbon Residue. Advantages of MCR include better control of test conditions, smaller samples, and less operator attention.&lt;ref name=ASTM /&gt; Applications include:

*For burner fuel, MCR provides an approximation of the tendency of the fuel to form deposits in vaporizing pot-type and sleeve-type burners.&lt;ref name=CCR&gt;{{cite web|last1=ASTM International|title=Standard Test Method for Conradson Carbon Residue of Petroleum Products|url=http://www.pentasflora.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/D189-Carbon-Residue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[diesel fuel]], MCR correlates approximately with combustion chamber deposits, provided that alkyl nitrates are absent, or if present, that the test is performed on the base fuel without additive.&lt;ref name=CCR /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=International Standards Organization|title=ISO 10370:2014. Petroleum products -- Determination of carbon residue -- Micro method|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=57081|accessdate=28 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[motor oil]], MCR was once regarded as indicative of the amount of carbonaceous deposits the oil would form in the combustion chamber of an engine. This is now considered to be of doubtful significance due to the presence of additives in many oils.&lt;ref name="CCR" /&gt;
*For [[gas oil]], MCR  provides a useful correlation in the manufacture of gas there from.&lt;ref name="CCR" /&gt;
*For [[delayed coker]]s, the MCR of the feed correlates positively to the amount of coke that will be produced.&lt;ref name=Coking&gt;{{cite web|last1=Colorado School of Mines|title=Delayed Coking|url=http://processengr.com/pdf_documents/co_school_mines_coker_chp5.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*For [[fluid catalytic cracking]] units, the MCR of the feed can be used to estimate the feed's coke-forming tendency.&lt;ref name=FCC&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sadeghbeigi|first1=Reza|title=Fluid Catalytic Cracking Handbook: Design, Operation, and Troubleshooting of FCC Facilities|date=2000|publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing|isbn=0884152898|pages=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z0qNlKizu5sC&amp;pg=PA52&amp;lpg=PA52&amp;dq=concarbon+catalytic+cracking&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8QCp3wVdVl&amp;sig=Bd0faa7f7Lelas5DXaIioaXcJbU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0nKnN8KLJAhXF4iYKHSQdD1oQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=concarbon%20catalytic%20cracking&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''mood board''' is a type of [[collage]] consisting of images, text, and samples of objects in a composition. It can be based upon a set topic or can be any material chosen at random. A mood board can be used to give a general idea of a topic, or to show how different something is from the modern day.{{cn|date=October 2017}}{{or|date=October 2017}} They may be physical or digital, and can be effective presentation tools.&lt;ref name=wyatt&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt|first=Paul|title=How to create mood boards: 40 pro tips and tools|url=http://www.creativebloq.com/graphic-design/mood-boards-812470|newspaper=Creative Bloq|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
[[Graphic designer]]s, [[interior designer]]s, [[industrial designer]]s, [[photographer]]s and other creative artists use mood boards to visually illustrate the style they wish to pursue. However, these boards can also be used by design professionals to visually explain a certain style of [[writing]], or an imaginary setting for a storyline. In short, mood boards are not limited to visual subjects, but serve as a visual tool to quickly inform others of the overall "feel" (or "flow") of an idea.{{cn|date=October 2017}} In creative processes, mood boards can balance coordination and creative freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Endrissat, N., Islam, G., &amp; Noppeney, C.

The '''National Union of Distributive and Allied Workers''' (NUDAW) was a [[trade union]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

The union was founded in 1921, when the [[Amalgamated Union of Co-operative Employees]] merged with the [[National Union of Warehouse and General Workers]].  The Co-operative Insurance Staff union split in 1922, but several small unions joined during the 1920s, and membership reached 96,000 by 1926, rising to 274,000 in 1946.  By this point, four-tenths of its members were women.&lt;ref name="marsh"&gt;Arthur Ivor Marsh and Victoria Ryan, ''Historical Directory of Trade Unions, Vol. 5'', p.131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, NUDAW merged with the [[National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants]], to form the [[Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers]].&lt;ref name="marsh" /&gt;  [[Joseph Hallsworth]] was General Secretary of the union for its entire existence.&lt;ref name="who"&gt;"[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U155229/HALLSWORTH_Sir_Joseph HALLSWORTH, Sir Joseph]", ''[[Who Was Who]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nitrogen trichloride''', also known as '''trichloramine''', is the [[chemical compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This yellow, oily, pungent-smelling and explosive liquid is most commonly encountered as a byproduct of [[chemical reaction]]s between [[ammonia]]-derivatives and [[chlorine]] (for example, in [[swimming pool]]s).

==Preparation and structure==
The compound is prepared by treatment of ammonium salts, such as [[ammonium nitrate]] with chlorine.

Intermediates in this conversion include [[chloramine]] and [[dichloramine]], NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl and NHCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

Like ammonia, NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[pyramidal molecule]]. The N-Cl distances are 1.76&amp;nbsp;Å, and the Cl-N-Cl angles are 107°.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 978-0-12-352651-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions and uses==
The chemistry of NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has been well explored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is moderately [[polar molecule|polar]] with a [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]] of 0.6 D.  The nitrogen center is basic but much less so than ammonia.  It is hydrolyzed by hot water to release [[ammonia]] and [[hypochlorous acid]].

:NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;rarr; NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 HOCl

NCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; explodes to give N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and chlorine gas.  This reaction is inhibited for dilute gases.

Nitrogen trichloride can form in small amounts when public water supplies are disinfected with [[monochloramine]], and in swimming pools by disinfecting chlorine reacting with [[urea]] in urine and sweat from bathers. 

Nitrogen trichloride, trademarked as Agene, was at one time used to bleach [[flour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/jsfa.2740060906| title = Some effects of oxygen on the mixing of bread doughs| journal = Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture| volume = 6| issue = 9| pages = 501–511| year = 1955| last1 = Hawthorn| first1 = J.| last2 = Todd| first2 = J. P.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this practice was banned in the United States in 1949 due to safety concerns.

==Safety==
Nitrogen trichloride can irritate mucous membranes—it is a [[lachrymatory agent]], but has never been used as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = White, G.

An '''optical mount''' is a device used to join a normal [[camera]] and another optical instrument, such as a [[microscope]] or [[telescope]]. The optical mount is generally attached to the camera as a [[camera lens|lens]] would on one end, and fastened to the other instrument in a similar fashion. Optical mounts are used extensively in [[science|scientific]] imaging applications in [[biology]] and [[astronomy]].

[[File:2018 Komputer PC 01.jpg|thumb|Phanteks Enthoo Pro case]]
'''Phanteks''' is a Dutch company which mainly produces [[PC case|PC cases]], fans and other case accessories. The company has a base in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Phanteks's first product was the PH-TC14PE, a [[CPU]] cooler, which gave the young company a good reputation right from the beginning.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/Phanteks/PH-TC14PE/7.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Phanteks started its case product line, beginning with the Enthoo Series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/about-us.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current products==

The company has several different versions of the Enthoo series and a few of the Eclipse series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Enthoo-Series.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Eclipse-Series.html&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, their cases' cooling solutions have been extended by more CPU coolers, fans and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of 2017, the company also produces liquid cooling blocks and fittings.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/230716/phanteks-also-announces-the-glacier-c350i-cpu-water-block&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techpowerup.com/222955/phanteks-makes-its-foray-into-diy-liquid-cooling.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phanteks.com/Liquid-Cooling.html&lt;/ref&gt; One of their most recent computer cases, shown at [[Computex]] 2018, is the Evolv X. The Evolv X is the successor of the Evolv ATX; while similar to the original in design on the outside, the Evolv X has been redesigned from the inside out.&lt;ref&gt;https://wccftech.com/phanteks-displays-evolv-x-eclipse-p600s-and-next-generation-fans-at-computex-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3226">A '''pilot line''' is a pre-commercial [[production line]] that produces small volumes of new technology-based products, or employs new production technology, as a step towards the commercialisation of the new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Pilot Production in Key Enabling Technologies; Crossing the Valley of Death and boosting the industrial deployment of Key Enabling Technologies in Europe,  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO on behalf of the European Commission, DG GROW—Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SME, 2015. {{ISBN|978-92-79-52140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Assessing support of pilot production in multi-KETs activities, Maurits Butter, Marcel de Heide, Carlos Montalvo, Koen Dittrich, Laura Seiffert, Laura Cid Navazo, Axel Thielmann, Annette Braun, Michael Meister, David Holden, Finbarr Livesey, Eoin O’Sullivan, Christian Hartman, Mirari Zaldua, Nicolo Olivieri, and Leo Turno, Final report of the multi-KETs Pilot lines project, 28 August 2015. Retrieved on 5-3-2017 from https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286026288_Assessing_support_of_pilot_production_in_multi-KETs_activities&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilot lines help bridge the gap between research and commercialisation, which is caused by the fact that new technology that has been proved only in a laboratory usually is not ready yet for application. They help bridge this gap in two ways:
* Pilot lines promote [[learning]] about a technology at a higher level of sophistication than in laboratories, that is, a level at which the technology is integrated in an early prototype and tested in an environment that is representative of the final operating environment.
* Pilot lines help reduce [[risk]] by providing information on the new technology and its application in many respects, including its technical feasibility, manufacturability, costs, and market and social acceptance.

In terms of the Technology Readiness Level framework, pilot plants validate production technology at levels TRL5-6: validation and demonstration of technology in a relevant environment.

== Terminology ==
A word similar to pilot line is [[pilot plant]].&lt;ref&gt;Pilot Production in Key Enabling Technologies; Crossing the Valley of Death and boosting the industrial deployment of Key Enabling Technologies in Europe,  Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research TNO on behalf of the European Commission, DG GROW—Directorate General for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SME, 2015. {{ISBN|978-92-79-52140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, pilot plants and pilot lines perform the same functions, but 'pilot plant' is used in the context of (bio)chemical and advanced materials production systems, whereas 'pilot line' is used for new technology in general, e.g. by the European Union.

== Example ==

An industrial pilot line for [[Microfabrication|micro-fabricated]] medical devices is established as part of the ECSEL JU project [http://www.informed-project.eu/ InForMed]. The pilot line will be hosted by a large industrial end-user, and is specifically targeted and equipped to bridge the gap between concept creation and full-scale production.

'''Polyphenylene sulfide''' (PPS) is an organic [[polymer]] consisting of [[aromatic]] rings linked by [[thioether|sulfide]]s. [[Synthetic fiber]] and [[textile]]s derived from this polymer resist [[chemical]] and thermal attack. PPS is used in [[air filter|filter]] fabric for [[coal]] [[boiler]]s, [[paper]]making [[felt]]s, [[electrical insulation]], [[film capacitor#Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS) film capacitors|film capacitors]], specialty [[synthetic membrane|membrane]]s, [[gasket]]s, and [[seal (mechanical)|packings]]. PPS is the precursor to a [[conductive polymer]] of the [[semi-flexible rod polymer]] family. The PPS, which is otherwise insulating, can be converted to the [[semiconductor|semiconducting]] form by [[oxidation]] or use of [[dopant]]s.&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;David Parker, Jan Bussink, Hendrik T. van de Grampel, Gary W. Wheatley, Ernst-Ulrich Dorf, Edgar Ostlinning, Klaus Reinking, "Polymers, High-Temperature" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH: Weinheim. {{doi|10.1002/14356007.a21_449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polyphenylene sulfide is an [[engineering plastic]], commonly used today as a [[high-performance plastics|high-performance thermoplastic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chevron Phillips Technical Library|url=http://www.cpchem.com/enu/ryton_pps_tl_technical_library.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPS can be molded, extruded, or machined to tight tolerances. In its pure solid form, it may be opaque white to light tan in color. Maximum service temperature is {{convert|218|°C|°F}}. PPS has not been found to dissolve in any solvent at temperatures below approximately {{convert|200|°C|°F}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}.
An easy way to identify the compound is by the metallic sound it makes when struck.

==Manufacturers and trade names==
PPS is marketed by different brand names by different manufacturers. The major industry players are [[Lumena|China Lumena New Materials]], [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay]], [[Kureha Chemical Industries|Kureha]], [[SK Chemicals]], [[Celanese]], [[DIC Corporation]], [[Toray Industries]], Zhejiang NHU Special Materials, [[SABIC]], and [[Tosoh]].&lt;ref name=marketresearch&gt;{{cite web|title=Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS) Market Analysis by Application (Automotive, Electronics &amp; Electrical, Industrial, Coatings) and Segment Forecasts to 2022|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manufacturers include Chengdu Letian Plastics, Lion Idemitsu Composites, and Initz (a joint venture of SK Chemicals and [[Teijin]]).&lt;ref name="researchandmarkets"&gt;{{cite news|title=Global Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS) Market 2012-2022 - Research and Markets|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160419005991/en/Global-Polyphenylene-Sulfide-PPS-Market-2012-2022--|publisher=Research and Markets|date=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following are examples of brand names by manufacturer and PPS type:

*Tedur, Albis Plastic, linear type
*DIC.PPS, DIC Corporation, linear and cross-linked
*DURAFIDE, Polyplastics Co. Ltd, linear type
*ECOTRAN, INITZ, distributed and compounded via [[A. Schulman]]
*Fortron, Ticona, linear type
*Petcoal, Tōsō
*Therma-Tech TT9200-5001, PolyOne Corporation
*Ryton, Solvay Specialty Polymers, linear and cross-linked
*Torelina Toray
*NHU-PPS, Zhejiang NHU Company Ltd., linear type and cross-linked

==Fiber characteristics==
PPS is one of the most important high temperature thermoplastic polymers because it exhibits a number of desirable properties. These properties include resistance to heat, [[acid]]s, [[alkali]]es, [[mildew]], [[bleach]]es, [[aging]], [[sunlight]], and [[wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]]. It absorbs only small amounts of solvents and resists [[dye]]ing.

==Production==
The [[Federal Trade Commission]] definition for sulfur fiber is "A manufactured fiber in which the fiber-forming [[chemical substance|substance]] is a long chain [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] polysulfide in which at least 85% of the [[sulfide]] (—S—) linkages are attached directly to two (2) [[aromatic]] rings."

The PPS (polyphenylene sulfide) [[polymer]] is formed by [[chemical reaction|reaction]] of [[sodium sulfide]] with [[p-dichlorobenzene]]:
:ClC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → 1/n [C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S]&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NaCl

[[File:Inventors Dr. H. Wayne Hill Jr. &amp; Mr. James T. Edmonds.jpg|thumb|Hill and Edmonds, developers of PPS]]
The process for commercially producing PPS (Ryton) was initially developed by Dr. H. Wayne Hill Jr. and James T. Edmonds at [[Phillips Petroleum Company]].&lt;ref&gt;H Wayne Hill Jr., James T. Edmonds, to the Phillips Petroleum Company Research Center (Bartlesville, Oklahoma, US). Patent 3,354,129, 1963. issued November 21, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; [[N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone|NMP]] is used as the reaction solvent because it is stable at the high temperatures required for the synthesis and it dissolves both the sulfiding agent and the [[oligomer]]ic intermediates.

Linear, high-molecular-weight PPS that is capable of being extruded into film and melt spun into fiber was invented by Robert W. Campbell.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Campbell to the Phillips Petroleum Company Research Center (Bartlesville, Oklahoma, US). Patent 3,919,177, 1974 issued November 11, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

The first U.S. commercial sulfur fiber was produced in 1983 by Phillips Fibers Corporation, a subsidiary of [[Phillips 66 Company]].&lt;ref name=Parker/&gt;

The '''Printer Working Group''' charter is to develop standards that make printers, operating systems and applications work better.

In 1991 a consortium of printer and network manufacturers (Insight Development, [[Intel]], LAN Systems, [[Lexmark]] and [[Texas Instruments]]) formed the ''Network Printing Alliance'' (NPA).  Later members included [[Konica Minolta | QMS]], [[Kyocera]], [[GENICOM]], Okidata, [[Unisys]], [[Canon Inc.|Canon]], [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], [[Adaptec]], [[Tektronix]], Digital Products, Pennant Systems, Extended Systems and [[NEC Corporation | NEC]].

In 1993, the NPA was reformed as the ''Printer Working Group'' (PWG) and added [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Compaq]], [[Microsoft]], [[Xerox]], Xircom, Farpoint Communications, [[Zenith Electronics Corporation | Zenith]], Castelle, [[Fujitsu]], [[3M]], [[Cirrus Logic]], Amp, [[National Semiconductor]] and [[Ricoh]].

In September 1999, the [[IEEE]] formalized an alliance with PWG as part of the [[IEEE-ISTO|IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization]] (IEEE-ISTO).

The PWG has supported the development of:
*[[IEEE 1284]] parallel port specification
*IEEE 1284.1 TIPSI (Transport Independent Printer Systems Interface)
*P1394 — printing protocols for [[FireWire|IEEE 1394]]
*[[IETF]] [[Management information base | MIBs]] in the PRINTMIB [[IETF Working Group|working group]]
*[[IETF]] [[Internet Printing Protocol]] in the IPP [[IETF Working Group|working group]]

==NPAP==
The ''Network Printing Alliance Protocol'' (NPAP) was developed as a protocol for returning printer configuration and status via parallel, serial, network and later [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]].  In 1997, NPAP was approved as IEEE 1284.1 TIPSI. However, [[Simple Network Management Protocol|SNMP]] became the standard for network printer management and thus NPAP was never widely accepted.  Lexmark appears to be the only manufacturer still supporting NPAP.{{when|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24241">{{anchor|ISO 3|ISO 17|ISO 497}}'''Renard series''' are a system of [[preferred number]]s dividing an interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps.&lt;ref name="ISO_3_1973"/&gt; This set of preferred numbers was proposed in the 1877 by French army engineer Colonel [[Charles Renard]].&lt;ref name="Kienzle_1950"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Paulin_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sizes_2014"/&gt; His system was adopted by the [[ISO]] in 1949&lt;ref name="ISO_17_1973"/&gt; to form the '''ISO Recommendation R3''', first published in 1953&lt;ref name="GOVPUB-C13_XNBSA"/&gt; or 1954, which evolved into the [[international standard]] '''ISO&amp;nbsp;3'''.&lt;ref name="ISO_3_1973"/&gt;
Renard's system of preferred numbers divides the interval from 1 to 10 into 5, 10, 20, or 40 steps. The factor between two consecutive numbers in a Renard series is approximately constant (before rounding), namely the 5th, 10th, 20th, or 40th root of 10 (approximately 1.58, 1.26, 1.12, and 1.06, respectively), which leads to a [[geometric sequence]]. This way, the maximum [[relative error]] is minimized if an arbitrary number is replaced by the nearest Renard number multiplied by the appropriate power of 10. One application of the Renard series of numbers is to current rating of electric fuses.

== Base series ==

The most basic R5 series consists of these five rounded numbers, which are powers of the fifth root of 10, rounded to two digits. Note that the Renard numbers are not always rounded to the closest three-digit number to the theoretical geometric sequence:

:R5: 1.00 1.60 2.50 4.00 6.30

== Examples ==

* If some design constraints were assumed so that the two screws in the gadget should be placed between 32&amp;nbsp;mm and 55&amp;nbsp;mm apart, the resulting length would be 40&amp;nbsp;mm, because 4 is in the R5 series of preferred numbers.
* If a set of nails with lengths between roughly 15 and 300&amp;nbsp;mm should be produced, then the application of the R5 series would lead to a product repertoire of 16&amp;nbsp;mm, 25&amp;nbsp;mm, 40&amp;nbsp;mm, 63&amp;nbsp;mm, 100&amp;nbsp;mm, 160&amp;nbsp;mm, and 250&amp;nbsp;mm long nails.
* If [[English wine cask units|traditional English wine cask sizes]] had been metricated, rundlet (68 liters), barrel (119 liters), tierce (159 liters), hogshead (239 liters), puncheon (318 liters), butt (477 liters) and tun (954 liters) could have become 63 (or 60 by R″5), 100, 160 (or 150), 250, 400, 630 (or 600) and 1000 liters, respectively.

== Alternative series ==

If a finer resolution is needed, another five numbers are added to the series, one after each of the original R5 numbers, and one ends up with the R10 series. These are rounded to a multiple of 0.05. Where an even finer grading is needed, the R20, R40, and R80 series can be applied. The R20 series is usually rounded to a multiple of 0.05, and the R40 and R80 values interpolate between the R20 values, rather than being powers of the 80th root of 10 rounded correctly. In the table below, the additional R80 values are written to the right of the R40 values in the column named "R80 add'l". The R40 numbers 3.00 and 6.00 are higher than they "should" be by interpolation, in order to give rounder numbers.

In some applications more rounded values are desirable, either because the numbers from the normal series would imply an unrealistically high accuracy, or because an integer value is needed (e.g., the number of teeth in a gear). For these needs, more rounded versions of the Renard series have been defined in ISO&amp;nbsp;3. In the table below, rounded values that differ from their less rounded counterparts are shown in bold.

As the Renard numbers repeat after every 10-fold change of the scale, they are particularly well-suited for use with [[SI]] units. It makes no difference whether the Renard numbers are used with [[metre]]s or [[millimetre]]s. But one would need to use an appropriate number base to avoid ending up with two incompatible sets of nicely spaced dimensions, if for instance they were applied with both [[inch]]es and [[foot (unit)|feet]]. In the case of inches and feet a root of 12 would be desirable, that is, {{radic|12|''n''}} where ''n'' is the desired number of divisions within the major step size of twelve. Similarly a base of two, eight, or sixteen would fit nicely with the binary units commonly found in computer science.

Each of the Renard sequences can be reduced to a subset by taking every ''n''th value in a series, which is designated by adding the number ''n'' after a slash.&lt;ref name="Sizes_2014"/&gt; For example, "R10″/3 (1…1000)" designates a series consisting of every third value in the R″10 series from 1 to 1000, that is, 1, 2, 4, 8, 15, 30, 60, 120, 250, 500, 1000.

From 1877 to 1879, Captain Charles Renard, an officer in the engineer corps, made a rational study of the elements necessary in the construction of […] aircraft. He computed the specifications […] according to a grading system […]. Recognizing the advantage to be derived from the geometrical progression, he adopted […] a grading system […] that would yield a tenth multiple of the value […] after every fifth step of the series […] Renard's theory was to substitute […] more rounded but […] practical values […] as a power of 10, positive, nil or negative. He thus obtained […] 10 16 25 40 63 100 […] continued in both directions […] by the symbol R5 […] the R10, R20, R40 series were formed, each adopted ratio being the square root of the preceding one […] The first standardization drafts were drawn up on these bases in Germany by the Normenausschuss der Deutschen Industrie on 13 April 1920, and in France by the Commission permanente de standardisation in document X of 19 December 1921. […] the commission of standardization in the Netherlands proposed their unification […] reached in 1931 […] in June 1932, the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations organized an international meeting in Milan, where the ISA Technical Committee 32, Preferred numbers, was set up and its Secretariat assigned to France. On 19 September 1934, the ISA Technical Committee 32 held a meeting in Stockholm; sixteen nations were represented: Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, U.S.S.R. With the exception of the Spanish, Hungarian and Italian […] the other delegations accepted the draft […] Japan communicated […] its approval […] the international recommendation was laid down in ISA Bulletin 11 (December 1935). […] After the Second World War, the work was resumed by ISO. The Technical Committee ISO/TC 19, Preferred numbers, was set up and France again held the Secretariat. This Committee at its first meeting […] in Paris in July 1949 […] recommended […] preferred numbers defined by […] ISA Bulletin 11, […] R5, R10, R20, R40. This meeting was attended by […] 19 […] nations: Austria, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, U.S.A., U.S.S.R. During […] subsequent meetings in New York in 1952 and […] the Hague in 1953, […] attended also by Germany, […] series R80 was added […] The draft thus amended became ISO Recommendation R3.

The '''Rio Grande Project''' is a [[United States Bureau of Reclamation]] [[irrigation]], [[hydroelectricity]], [[flood control]], and [[Interbasin transfer|interbasin water transfer]] project serving the upper [[Rio Grande]] basin in the southwestern [[United States]]. The project irrigates {{convert|193000|acre|km2}} along the river in the states of [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=hist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/riograndeh.html |title=Rio Grande Project (Third Draft) |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310121224/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/riograndeh.html |archivedate=March 10, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60 percent of this land is in New Mexico. Some water is also allotted to [[Mexico]] to irrigate some {{convert|25000|acre|km2}} on the south side of the river. The project was authorized in 1905,&lt;ref name=hsw&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://reference.howstuffworks.com/rio-grande-project-encyclopedia.htm|title=Rio Grande Project|publisher=HowStuffWorks|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but its final features were not implemented until the early 1950s.

The project consists of two large storage dams, 6 small [[diversion dam]]s, two flood-control dams, {{convert|596|mi|km}} of [[canal]]s and their branches and {{convert|465|mi|km}} of drainage channels and pipes. A small [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] plant at one of the project's dams also supplies electricity to the region.&lt;ref name=usbr1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/riogrande.html#development |title=Rio Grande Project: New Mexico and Texas |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118034123/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/html/riogrande.html |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}

==History==
The first people to use the waters of the Rio Grande were the [[Puebloan peoples|Pueblo Indians]], who used simple irrigation systems that were noted by the Spanish in the 16th century while conducting expeditions from [[Mexico]] to North America. In the mid-19th century, American settlers began intensive irrigation development of the Rio Grande watershed. Small [[Levee|dikes]], dams, [[canal]]s, and other irrigation works were constructed along the Rio Grande and its tributaries. The river would take out some of these primitive structures in its annual floods, and a large, coordinated project would be needed to construct permanent replacements. However, investigations to begin this project did not begin until the early twentieth century.

[[Image:Rio Grande River south of Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|left|The Rio Grande]]
[[Image:Caballo lake-kmf.JPG|thumb|left|Caballo Lake, formed by Caballo Dam on the Rio Grande]]
Like many rivers of the [[American Southwest]], runoff in the Rio Grande basin is limited and varies widely from year to year.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.offthekuff.com/mt/archives/001970.html|title=Rio Grande Running Dry|publisher=Off the Kuff|year=2003|accessdate=April 10, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, water use in the upper basin was so great that the river's flow near [[El Paso, Texas]], was reduced to a trickle in dry summers. To resolve these problems, plans were drafted up for a large storage dam at Elephant Butte, about {{convert|120|mi|km}} downstream of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. The [[Newlands Reclamation Act]] was passed in 1902, authorizing the Rio Grande Project as a Bureau of Reclamation undertaking. For the next two years, surveyors and engineers undertook a comprehensive feasibility study for the project's dams and reservoirs.

[[Image:Elephant Butte Dam under construction 1914.JPG|thumb|right|Elephant Butte Dam under construction in 1914.]]
The first elements of the project to be built were the Leasburg Diversion Dam and about {{convert|6|mi|km}} of supporting canal, begun in 1906 and finished in 1908. [[Elephant Butte Dam]], the largest dam on the Rio Grande, was authorized by the [[United States Congress]] on February 15, 1905. Construction began in 1908, when groundworks were laid. Conflicts over the lands to be submerged under the future reservoir bogged down the project for a while, but work resumed in 1912 and the reservoir began to fill by 1915. The Franklin Canal was an existing 1890 canal purchased by the Bureau of Reclamation in 1912 and rebuilt from 1914 to 1915. The Mesilla and Percha Diversion Dams, East Side Canal, West Side Canal, Rincon Valley Canal, and an extension of the Leasburg Canal were built in the period between 1914 and 1919.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

In the late 1910s, a problem developed with rising local [[groundwater]] levels caused by irrigation. In response, Reclamation began planning for the extensive {{convert|465|mi|km|adj=on}} drainage system of the Rio Grande Project in 1916. Contracts for the construction of these drainage systems, as well as distribution canals (laterals) were not awarded until the period from 1917 to 1918. Before 1929, the entire irrigation system would be overhauled. This involved repairing, rebuilding and extending old canals; and construction of new laterals. Work is still in progress, as agricultural development in the region continues to grow.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

The last major components of the project were constructed from the 1930s to the early 1950s. [[Caballo Dam]], the second major storage facility of the project located north of [[Truth or Consequences, New Mexico]] was built from 1936-1938. Caballo was built to provide flood protection for the projects downstream, stabilize outflows from Elephant Butte, and replace storage lost in Elephant Butte Reservoir due to sedimentation. With the benefit of flow regulation, a small hydroelectric plant was completed in 1940 at the base of Elephant Butte Dam. The construction of power transmission lines was begun in 1940, and was finally completed by 1952.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;&lt;ref name=home&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Elephant Butte Irrigation District]] is a {{convert|6870|acre|km2}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] providing recognition and limited protection for the history of much of the system, which was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1997.  The listing included three [[contributing buildings]] and 214 [[contributing structures]].  Noted as historic are the diversion dams and the unlined irrigation canals;  most of the mechanical fixtures in the system have been routinely replaced and are non-historic.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=97000822}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Elephant Butte Irrigation District / Rio Grande Project |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|author=David A.

==Components of the project==

===Elephant Butte Dam===
[[Image:Elephant butte dike.jpg|thumb|right|Elephant Butte Dam]]
{{main|Elephant Butte Dam}}
The Elephant Butte Dam (also referred to as Elephant Butte Dike) is the main storage facility for the Rio Grande Project. It is a {{convert|1674|ft|m|abbr=on}} long concrete gravity dam standing {{convert|193|ft|m|abbr=on}} above the river and {{convert|301|ft|m|abbr=on}} high from its foundations. The dam is {{convert|228|ft|m}} thick at the base and tapers to about {{convert|18|ft|m}} thick at the crest.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00129.htm |title=Elephant Butte Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118041206/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00129.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam took {{convert|629500|yd3|m3}} of material to construct.

The full volume of [[Elephant Butte Reservoir]] is some {{convert|2109423|acre.ft|m3|abbr=on}}, accounting for about 85% of the project's storage capacity. The [[outlet works]] of the dam can release {{convert|10800|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, while the service [[spillway]] can release {{convert|34750|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; 

The reservoir and dam receive water from a [[Drainage basin|catchment]] of {{convert|28900|sqmi|km2}}, about 16% of the Rio Grande's total drainage area.&lt;ref name=eb/&gt; The Elephant Butte hydroelectric station is a [[base load power plant]] that draws water from the reservoir and has a capacity of 27.95 [[megawatt]]s.&lt;ref name=power&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/sites/elephant/elephant.html |title=Elephant Butte Powerplant |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118044022/http://www.usbr.gov/power/data/sites/elephant/elephant.html |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Caballo Dam===
[[Image:Caballo Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Caballo Dam]]
{{main|Caballo Dam}}
Caballo Dam is the second major storage dam of the Rio Grande Project, located about {{convert|25|mi|km}} below Elephant Butte. The dam is {{convert|78|ft|m}} high above the river, {{convert|96|ft|m}} high from its foundations, and {{convert|4558|ft|m}} long. It forms the Caballo Reservoir, which can store up to {{convert|343990|acre feet|km3|abbr=on}} of water. 

The outlet works can release {{convert|5000|ft3|m3}} cubic feet per second, while the spillway has a capacity of  {{convert|33200|ft3|m3}} per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00131.htm |title=Caballo Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118041732/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00131.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam has no power generation facilities, although it has been proposed that a small hydroelectric plant be installed at its base for local irrigation districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Walkoviak, Larry|url=http://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/09/22/2011-24335/notice-of-intent-to-accept-proposals-select-lessee-and-contract-for-hydroelectric-power-development|title=Notice of Intent to Accept Proposals, Select Lessee, and Contract for Hydroelectric Power Development at Caballo Dam, Rio Grande Project, New Mexico|publisher=Federal Register|work=|date=2011-08-08|accessdate=2012-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Percha Diversion Dam and Rincon Valley Main Canal===
{{main|Percha Diversion Dam}}
[[Percha Diversion Dam]] lies downstream from and {{convert|1|mi|km}} west of the Caballo Dam. It consists of a concrete overflow section flanked by earthen wing dikes totaling {{convert|2489|ft|m|abbr=on}} in length, standing {{convert|19|ft|m}} high above the riverbed and {{convert|29|ft|m}} above its foundations.
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm82927.htm |title=Percha Diversion Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118041719/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm82927.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam diverts water into the Rincon Valley Main Canal, which is {{convert|28.1|mi|km}} long and has a capacity of {{convert|350|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Water from the canal irrigates {{convert|16260|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land in the Rincon Valley.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

===Leasburg Diversion Dam and Canal===
[[Image:Leasburgdiverdam.jpg|thumb|right|Leasburg Diversion Dam]]
{{main|Leasburg Diversion Dam}}
[[Leasburg Diversion Dam]] is downstream and nearly identical in design to the Percha Diversion Dam. It is {{convert|7|ft|m}} high above the river and {{convert|10|ft|m}} high above its foundations. The dam and adjacent dikes total {{convert|3922.3|ft|m}} in length. The dam's spillway is a broad-crested [[weir]] about {{convert|600|ft|m}} long with a capacity of {{convert|17000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00007.htm |title=Leasburg Diversion Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118042924/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00007.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam diverts water into the {{convert|13.7|mi|km|adj=on}} Leasburg Canal, which irrigates {{convert|31600|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land in the upper Mesilla Valley. The canal has a capacity of {{convert|625|ft3|m3}} per second.

===Pichacho North and South Dams===
Pichacho North and Pichacho South dams impound North Pichacho Arroyo and South Pichacho Arroyo, respectively, to provide flood protection for the Leasburg Canal. Both arroyos are [[ephemeral]], and so the dams operate only during storm events. The dams were both built in the 1950s.
*Pichacho North is an earthfill dam {{convert|38|ft|m}} high above the streambed, {{convert|41|ft|m}} high above its foundations, and {{convert|1610|ft|m}} long. It has an uncontrolled crest spillway that is {{convert|200|ft|m}} long. It controls floods from a drainage area of {{convert|11|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/picacho_north.htm |title=Pichacho North Dam |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118043625/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/picacho_north.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Pichacho South stands {{convert|26|ft|m}} high above the arroyo and {{convert|30|ft|m}} from its foundations. The dam is {{convert|3945|ft|m}} long. Its spillway is of similar design to that of North Pichacho, and is {{convert|100|ft|m}} long. The dam provides flood protection for an area of {{convert|6|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/picacho_south.htm |title=Pichacho South Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118041358/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/picacho_south.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesilla Diversion Dam and Canals===
[[Image:Mesilladiverdam.jpg|thumb|right|Mesilla Diversion Dam, upstream side. The headworks of one of the canals are visible in the center.]]
{{main|Mesilla Diversion Dam}}
The [[Mesilla Diversion Dam]] is located about {{convert|40|mi|km}} upstream of El Paso and consists of a gated overflow structure. The dam is {{convert|10|ft|m}} high above the Rio Grande, {{convert|22|ft|m}} high above its foundations, and measures {{convert|303|ft|m}} long. The spillway has a capacity of {{convert|15000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00008.htm |title=Mesilla Diversion Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118043252/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm00008.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam diverts water into the East Side Canal and West Side Canal, which provide irrigation water to {{convert|53650|acre|ha|abbr=on}} of land in the lower Mesilla Valley. The East Side Canal is {{convert|13.5|mi|km}} long, and has a capacity of {{convert|300|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The West Side Canal is larger at {{convert|23.4|mi|km}} long, and has a capacity of {{convert|650|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. Near its end, the West Side Canal crosses underneath the Rio Grande via the Montoya Siphon.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

===American Diversion Dam and Canals===
{{main|American Diversion Dam|American Canal}}
The [[American Diversion Dam]] is a gated dam flanked by earthen dikes about {{convert|2|mi|km}} northwest of El Paso and just above the [[Mexico – United States border]]. It is {{convert|5|ft|m}} high above the riverbed, and {{convert|18|ft|m}} from crest to foundation. The spillway is {{convert|286|ft|m}} long and has a capacity of {{convert|12000|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm82924.htm |title=American Diversion Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118042222/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/nm82924.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The dam diverts water into the American Canal, which carries up to {{convert|1200|cuft/s|m3/s}} of water for {{convert|2.1|mi|km}} to the beginning of the Franklin Canal. The Franklin Canal is {{convert|28.4|mi|km}} long and takes water into the El Paso Valle, where it irrigates {{convert|17000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

===Riverside Diversion Dam and Canals===
{{main|Riverside Diversion Dam}}
[[Riverside Diversion Dam]] is the lowermost dam of the Rio Grande Project. The dam is {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the streambed, {{convert|17.5|ft|m}} above its foundations, and {{convert|267|ft|m}} long. Its service spillway consists of six {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on}}x{{convert|8.17|ft|m|abbr=on}} [[radial gate]]s, and an uncontrolled overflow weir serves as an emergency spillway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/tx00025.htm |title=Riverside Diversion Dam |publisher=United States Bureau of Reclamation |accessdate=April 10, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118041411/http://www.usbr.gov/dataweb/dams/tx00025.htm |archivedate=January 18, 2009 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; The Riverside Canal carries water {{convert|17.2|mi|km}} to the El Paso Valley, and has a capacity of about {{convert|900|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}. The Tornillo Canal, with a capacity of {{convert|325|cuft/s|m3/s|abbr=on}}, branches {{convert|12|mi|km}} off the Riverside Canal. Excess waters from the canals are diverted to irrigate about {{convert|18000|acre|ha|abbr=on}} in [[Hudspeth County, Texas]].&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

==Effects==

===Benefits===
[[Image:Caballo Lake Map.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Caballo Lake and irrigated lands along the Rio Grande Valley]]
The Rio Grande Project furnishes irrigation water year-round to a long, narrow area of {{convert|178000|acre|ha}}&lt;ref name=hsw/&gt; in the Rio Grande Valley in south-central New Mexico and western Texas. Crops grown in the region include [[grain]], [[pecan]]s, [[alfalfa]], [[cotton]], and many types of vegetables. Power generated at the Elephant Butte power plant is distributed through an [[electrical grid]] totaling {{convert|490|mi|km}} of 115-[[Volt|kilovolt]] [[Electric power transmission|transmission lines]] and 11 [[Electrical substation|substations]]. Originally built by Reclamation, the power grid remained under its ownership until 1977, when it was sold to a local company.&lt;ref name=power/&gt;

Caballo and Elephant Butte reservoirs are both popular recreational areas. Elephant Butte Reservoir, with {{convert|36897|acre|km2}} of water at full pool, is popular for swimming, boating, and fishing. Cabins, fishing tackle, and boat rental services are available at the reservoir. Downstream Caballo Reservoir, with an area of {{convert|11500|acre|km2}}, is also a popular site for picnicking, fishing and boating. [[Elephant Butte Lake State Park]] and [[Caballo Lake State Park]] serve the two reservoirs, respectively.&lt;ref name=usbr1/&gt;

Even before the Rio Grande Project, the waters of the Rio Grande were already overtaxed by human development in the region. At the end of the 19th century, there were some 925 diversions of the river in the state of Colorado alone. In 1896, it was affirmed by the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) that the river's flow was decreasing by {{convert|200000|acre.ft|lk=in}} annually.{{dubious|date=January 2012}} The river has run dry many times since the 1950s at [[Big Bend National Park]]. At [[El Paso, Texas]], the river is non-existent for much of the year. Tributaries of the river, both on the Mexican and American sides, have been diverted heavily for irrigation. The Rio Grande is said to be "one of the most stressed river basins in the world".&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the river failed to reach the [[Gulf of Mexico]] but instead ended {{convert|500|ft|m}} from the shore behind a [[Shoal|sandbar]], "not with a roar but with a whimper in the sand".&lt;ref name=bnet&gt;

[[Image:USA Big Bend Rio Grande TX.jpg|thumb|right|The river forms the border of the USA (foreground) and Mexico (background). However, the diminished flow, evident in the photo, has made it easier for [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants to cross the border]].]]
The river's decreasing flow has posed problems for international security. In the past, the river was wide, deep and fast-flowing in its section through Texas, where it forms a large section of the [[Mexico – United States border]]. [[Illegal immigration to the United States|Illegal immigrants]] once had to swim across the river at the border, but with the river so low immigrants need only wade across for most of the year. Other than extensive diversions, exotic introduced, fast-growing and water-consuming plants, such as [[Eichhornia crassipes|water hyacinth]] and [[hydrilla]], are also leading to reduced flows. The United States government has recently attempted to slow or stop the progress of these weeds by [[Biological pest control|introducing]] insects and fish that feed on the invasive plants.&lt;ref name=bnet/&gt;

[[File:Night paving 09 paving deail.jpg|thumb|The ''screed'' on this [[Paver (vehicle)|paver]] spreads and smooths the asphalt.]]
'''Screed''' has three meanings in building construction: 
# a flat board (screed board, floating screed) or a purpose-made [[aluminium]] tool used to smooth and true materials like [[concrete]], [[stucco]] and plaster after it has been placed on a surface or to assist in flattening;&lt;ref name="Definition of Screed"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hribar.com/glossary/construction/S.html | title = Construction Dictionary | accessdate = 2007-05-21| year = 2000 | publisher = Website Upgrades Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# a strip of plaster or wood applied to a surface to act as a guide for a screed tool (screed rail, screed strip, screed [[batten]]); 
# the material itself which has been flattened with a screed (screed coat).&lt;ref&gt;"screed, n. 3" and screed, v. 4." ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, ''screed'' has also come to describe a thin, top layer of material ([[sand]] and [[cement]], [[magnesite]] or [[calcium sulphate]]), poured in site on top of the structural concrete or insulation, on top of which other finishing materials can be applied, or it can be left bare to achieve a raw effect.

== Screed boards ==
[[File:US Navy 091022-N-2571C-042 Seabees use a long board to screed wet concrete.jpg|thumb|US Navy [[Seabee]]s use a ''screed'' (board) to ''screed'' (verb) wet concrete. The form-work acts as ''screed rails''.]]
[[File:Massetto Autolivellante Matera Inerti.png|thumb|Example of application of self-leveling screed]]
In the US, screeding is the process a person called a [[concrete finisher]] performs by cutting off excess wet concrete to bring the top surface of a slab to the proper grade and smoothness. A [[power concrete screed]] has a gasoline motor attached which helps smooth and vibrate concrete as it is flattened. After the concrete is flattened it is smoothed with a [[concrete float]] or [[power trowel]]. A concrete floor is sometimes called a [[solid ground floor]].

A [[plasterer]] also may use a screed to level a wall or ceiling surface in [[plasterwork]].

This sense of screed has been extended to asphalt paving where a [[free floating screed]] is part of a machine which spreads the pavement.

==Screed rails==

[[File:Hyrib metal lath truss.jpg|thumb|The wood pieces labeled "beveled nailing strips" act as ''screed rails'' in this installation of a ''screed coating'' on [[Hy-Rib]] brand wire lath]]
A ''weep screed'' or ''sill screed'' is a screed rail which has drainage holes to allow moisture which penetrated an exterior plaster or stucco coating to drain through the screed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-weep-screed.htm wisegeek.com accessed March 22, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liquid and flow screeds==
Flowing screeds are made from inert fillers such as sand, with a binder system based on [[cement]] or often [[calcium sulphate]]. Flow screeds are often preferred to traditional screeds as they are easier and faster to install and provide a similar finish. Flow screed is often used in combination with underfloor heating installation.

Liquid flow screed is self-levelling. No vibration is necessary to remove bubbles and densify the liquid mass.
Due to the easy consolidation thickness can sometimes be reduced in comparison to conventional screeds. This minimises heat storage leading to a floor that reacts quickly to user requirement hence raising the efficacy of underfloor heating.

==Screed coats==
[[File:All in One Screed Pumping Truck.jpg|thumb|''Screed'' (material) pumping truck]]
A development in the UK is the delivery, mixing, and pumping of screed from a single vehicle. Where previously screed jobs required a separate pump to administer the screed, these new machines can now administer the screed directly from the mixing pan to the floor at a range of up to 60 meters. For example, the material called [[granolithic]].

[[Image:Ready to eat microwave food (TV dinner) Currywurst with French fries.JPG|thumb|250px|A German TV dinner ([[currywurst]] with [[French fries]])]]

A '''TV dinner''' (also called '''prepackaged meal''', '''ready-made meal''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/jun/12/foodanddrink.features9|title=Could a top chef stomach ready-made meals?|date=12 June 2005|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''ready meal''', '''frozen dinner''', '''frozen meal''' and '''microwave meal''') is a [[processed food|packaged]] frozen [[meal]] that usually comes portioned for an individual, but may also be a single dish intended to be shared. It requires very little preparation and may contain a number of separate elements that comprise a single-serving meal.

A TV dinner in the United States usually consists of a type of meat for the main course, and sometimes vegetables, potatoes, and/or a dessert. The main dish can also be pasta or fish. In European TV dinners, [[Indian cuisine|Indian]] and [[Chinese meal]]s are common.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The term ''TV dinner'' was first used as part of a brand of packaged meals developed in 1953 by the company [[Swanson|C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons]] (the name in full was ''TV Brand Frozen Dinner'').  The original ''TV Dinner'' came in an [[aluminum]] tray and was heated in an [[oven]].  In the United States, the term is synonymous with any prepackaged meal or dish ("dinner") purchased frozen in a [[supermarket]] and heated at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TV dinner |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/TV%20dinner |website=Merriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, most frozen food trays are made of a [[microwave oven|microwaveable]] and disposable material, usually plastic.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Salisbury steak.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A contemporary TV dinner with [[Salisbury steak]] and [[macaroni and cheese]].]] --&gt;
Several smaller companies had conceived of frozen dinners earlier (see Invention section below), but the first to achieve success was Swanson. The first Swanson-brand TV Dinner was produced in the United States and consisted of a [[Thanksgiving dinner|Thanksgiving meal]] of [[turkey (food)|turkey]], cornbread [[Stuffing|dressing]], frozen [[pea]]s and [[sweet potato]]es&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swansonmeals.com/WebPortals/Default.aspx?tabid=29 Swanson TV Dinner FAQ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908053345/http://www.swansonmeals.com/WebPortals/Default.aspx?tabid=29 |date=September 8, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; packaged in a tray like those used at the time for [[Airline meal|airline food service]]. Each item was placed in its own compartment. The trays proved to be useful: the entire dinner could be removed from the outer packaging as a unit, the tray with its aluminum foil covering could be heated directly in the [[oven]] without any extra dishes, and one could eat the meal directly from the tray. The product was cooked for 25 minutes at {{convert|425|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and fit nicely on a [[TV tray table]]. The original TV Dinner sold for 98 cents, and had a production estimate of 5,000 dinners for the first year.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The name "TV dinner" was coined by Gerry Thomas, its inventor. At the time it was introduced, televisions were status symbols and a growing medium. Thomas thought the name "TV Dinner" sounded like the product was made for convenience (which it was), and the Swanson executives agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzlkO8LIWrs|title=Invention and view of the original TV dinner|first=|last=miscellus2|date=25 April 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has changed since the first TV Dinners were marketed. For instance, a wider variety of main courses – such as [[fried chicken]], [[spaghetti]], [[Salisbury steak]] and [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] combinations – have been introduced. Competitors such as [[Banquet Foods|Banquet]] and [[Morton Frozen Foods|Morton]] began offering prepackaged frozen dinners at a lower price than Swanson.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Other changes include:
* 1960 – Swanson added [[dessert]]s (such as apple cobbler and brownies) to a new four-compartment tray.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* 1969 – The first TV breakfasts were marketed (pancakes and sausage were the favorites). Great Starts Breakfasts and breakfast sandwiches (such as egg and Canadian bacon) followed later.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
* 1973 – The first [[Swanson]] "Hungry-Man" dinners were marketed; these contained  larger portions of its regular dinners. The American football player [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean" Joe Greene]] was the "Hungry-Man" spokesman.
* 1986 – The first microwave oven-safe trays were marketed.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Modern-day frozen dinners tend to come in microwave-safe containers. Product lines also tend to offer a larger variety of dinner types. These dinners, also known as microwave meals, can be purchased at most supermarkets. They are stored frozen. To prepare them, the plastic cover is removed or vented, and the meal is heated in a microwave oven for a few minutes. They are convenient since they essentially require no preparation time other than the heating, although some frozen dinners may require the preparer to briefly carry out an intermediate step (such as stirring [[mashed potato]]es midway through the heating cycle) to ensure adequate heating and uniform consistency of component items.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}
[[File:Spaghetti carbonara ready meal.JPG|thumb|right|A British Spaghetti carbonara ready meal after being microwaved]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], prepared frozen meals first became widely available in the late 1970s. Since then they have steadily grown in popularity with the increased ownership of home freezers and microwave ovens. Demographic trends such as the growth of smaller households have also influenced the sale of this and other types of [[convenience food]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frozen Ready Meals - UK - March 2006 |url=http://www.the-infoshop.com/study/mt37772-ready-meal-uk.html |publisher=[[Mintel|Mintel International Group Ltd]] |date=March 2006 |accessdate=2007-04-28  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022074155/http://www.the-infoshop.com/study/mt37772-ready-meal-uk.html |archivedate=2007-10-22 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the United Kingdom spent £5 million a day on ready meals, and was the largest consumer in [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=UK meals ‘ready’ for growth |url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/news/ng.asp?id=18472-uk-meals-ready |work= |publisher=[[William Reed Business Media|William Reed Business Media SAS]] |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2003-11-21 |accessdate=2006-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfrozen pre-cooked ready meals, which are merely chilled and require less time to reheat, are also popular and are sold by most supermarkets. Chilled ready meals are intended for immediate reheating and consumption. Although most can be frozen by the consumer after purchase, they can either be heated from frozen or may have to be fully defrosted before reheating.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Many different varieties of frozen and chilled ready meals are now generally available in the UK, including "[[gourmet]]" recipes, [[Organic food|organic]] and [[vegetarian]] dishes, traditional British and foreign cuisine, and smaller children's meals.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Invention==

The identity of the TV Dinner's inventor has been disputed. In one account, first publicized in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McMorris |first=Robert |title=Gobbler Glut Spurs Dinners |newspaper=[[Omaha World-Herald]] |date=1996-05-10 |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=OWHB&amp;p_theme=owhb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=Gobbler%20Glut%20Spurs%20Dinners%20AND%20date%28all%29&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=%28Gobbler%20Glut%20Spurs%20Dinners%29&amp;xcal_numdocs=20&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;xcal_useweights=no |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; retired Swanson executive [[Gerry Thomas]] said he conceived the idea after the company found itself with a huge surplus of frozen turkeys because of poor Thanksgiving sales. Thomas' version of events has been challenged by the ''Los Angeles Times'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roy |last=Rivenburg |title=False tales of turkey on a tray |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-op-tvdinner31jul31,1,6644824.story?ctrack=1&amp;cset=true |work= |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2005-07-31 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the Swanson family&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rivenburg |first=Roy |title=A landmark idea, yes, but whose? |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=2003-11-23 |page=E1 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/23/entertainment/ca-rivenburg23/3 |accessdate=2014-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and former Swanson employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/tvdinner.html |title=Who "invented" the TV dinner? |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |date=&lt;!--undated--&gt; |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They credit the Swanson brothers with the invention.

Swanson's concept was not original. In 1944, William L.

In 1952 the first frozen dinners on oven-ready aluminum trays were introduced by Quaker States Foods under the One-Eye Eskimo label. Quaker States Foods was joined by other companies including Frigi-Dinner, which offered such fare as [[beef stew]] with [[maize|corn]] and [[pea]]s, [[veal]] [[goulash]] with peas and potatoes, and chicken chow mein with egg rolls and fried rice. Swanson, a large producer of canned and frozen poultry in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], was able to promote the widespread sales and adaptation of frozen dinner by using its nationally recognized brand name with an extensive national marketing campaign nicknamed "Operation Smash" and the clever advertising name of "TV Dinner," which tapped into the public's excitement around the new device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |surname=Shapiro |given=Laura |year=2004 |title=Something from the Oven: Reinventing Dinner in 1950s America |place=New York |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=014303491X |oclc=52471805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Manufacturing==
The production process of TV dinners is highly automated and undergoes three major steps. Those steps are food preparation, tray loading, and freezing. During food preparation, vegetables and fruits are usually placed on a movable belt and washed, then are placed into a container to be steamed or boiled for 1–3 minutes. This process is referred to as blanching, and is used as a method to destroy enzymes in the food that can cause chemical changes negatively affecting overall flavor and color of the fruit and vegetables. As for meats, prior to cooking, they are trimmed of fat and cut into proper sizes. The fish is usually cleaned and cut into fillets, and poultry is usually washed thoroughly and dressed. Meats are then seasoned, placed on trays, and are cooked in an oven for a predetermined amount of time. After all the food is ready to be packaged, it is sent to the filling lines. The food is placed in its compartments as the trays pass under numerous filling machines; to ensure that every packaged dinner gets an equal amount of food, the filling devices are strictly regulated.&lt;ref name="TV Dinner Manufacturing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-5/TV-Dinner.html|title=How tv dinner is made - manufacture, making, history, used, processing, components, structure, product, History, Design|website=www.madehow.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The food undergoes a process of cryogenic freezing with liquid nitrogen. After the food is placed on the conveyor belt, it is sprayed with liquid nitrogen that boils on contact with the freezing food. This method of flash-freezing fresh foods is used to retain natural quality of the food. When the food is chilled through cryogenic freezing, small ice crystals are formed throughout the food that, in theory, can preserve the food indefinitely if stored safely. Cryogenic freezing is widely used as it is a method for rapid freezing, requires almost no dehydration, excludes oxygen thus decreasing oxidative spoilage, and causes less damage to individual freezing pieces. Due to the fact that the cost of operating cryogenic freezing is high, it is commonly used for high value food products such as TV dinners, which is a $4.5 billion industry a year that is continuing to grow with the constant introduction of new technology.&lt;ref name="TV Dinner Manufacturing"/&gt;

Following this, the dinners are either covered with aluminum foil or paper, and the product is tightly packed with a partial vacuum created to ensure no evaporation takes place that can cause the food to dry out. Then the packaged dinners are placed in a refrigerated storage facility, transported by refrigerated truck, and stored in the grocer's freezer. TV dinners prepared with the aforementioned steps -- that is, frozen and packaged properly -- can remain in near-perfect condition for a long time, so long as they are stored at -18&amp;nbsp;°C during shipping and storage.&lt;ref name="TV Dinner Manufacturing"/&gt;

==Health concerns==

The freezing process tends to degrade the taste of food{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and the meals are thus heavily processed with extra salt and fat to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17937719/ns/today_food_and_wine-before_you_bite_with_phil_lempert/ |website=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|NBC Today Show]] |last=Lampert |first=Phil |title=6 things you need to know about frozen dinners: Tips for shopping wisely for the best — and healthiest — convenient meals |date=2007-04-04 |accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, stabilizing the product for a long period typically means that companies will use [[partially hydrogenated]] vegetable oils for some items (typically dessert). Partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are high in [[trans fat]]s and are shown to adversely affect  [[cardiovascular]] health.&lt;ref name="A"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Willett |first1=W.C. |last2=Ascherio |first2=A. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Trans Fatty Acids: Are the Effects Only Marginal? |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=84 |issue=5 |pages=722–724 |date=May 1994 |doi=10.2105/ajph.84.5.722 |pmc=1615057 |pmid=8179036 |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.84.5.722}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dinners are almost always significantly less [[Nutrition|nutritious]] than fresh food and are formulated to remain edible after long periods of storage, thus often requiring preservatives such as [[butylated hydroxytoluene]]. There is, however, some variability between brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3756451.stm |website=[[BBC]] |title=Choose your ready-meal carefully |date=2004-05-28 |accessdate=2014-05-06  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years there has been a push by a number of independent manufacturers and retailers to make meals that are low in salt and fat and free of artificial additives. In the UK, most British supermarkets also produce their own "healthy eating" brands.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Nearly all chilled or frozen ready meals sold in the UK are now clearly labeled with the salt, sugar and fat content and the recommended daily intake.

More recently, frozen dinners have been created that are designed to be used with a steamer, allowing rapid cooking of essentially raw ingredients (typically fish and vegetables) immediately before consumption.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Waterloo''' is a city in [[Ontario]], Canada. It is the smallest of three cities in the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo]] (and previously in [[Waterloo County, Ontario]]), and is adjacent to the city of [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]].

Kitchener and Waterloo are often jointly referred to as "Kitchener–Waterloo", "KW", or the "Twin Cities" (when the reference includes the nearby city of [[Cambridge, Ontario]], the term  "[[Tri-Cities (Ontario)|Tri-Cities]]" or "the Tri-City" are used). While there were several unsuccessful attempts to combine the cities of Kitchener and Waterloo, following the 1973 establishment of the Region of Waterloo there was less motivation to do so. At the time of the [[Canada 2016 Census|2016 census]], the population of Waterloo was 104,986.&lt;ref name="SC2016"/&gt;

==History==
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
Waterloo started on land that was part of a parcel of {{convert|675,000|acre|km2}} assigned in 1784 to the [[Iroquois]] alliance that made up the League of Six Nations. The rare gift of land from Britain to indigenous people took place to compensate for wartime alliance during the [[American Revolution]].  Almost immediately—and with much controversy—the native groups began to sell some of the land. Between 1796 and 1798, {{convert|93,000|acre|km2}} were sold through a Crown Grant to [[Richard Beasley (politician)|Richard Beasley]], with the Six Nations Indians continuing to hold the mortgage on the lands.

The first wave of immigrants to the area comprised [[Mennonites]] from [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="cow history"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.waterloo.ca/150Anniversary/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=1780
| title = Our Proud History
| accessdate = August 30, 2007
| publisher = City of Waterloo}}&lt;/ref&gt; They bought deeds to land parcels from Beasley and began moving into the area in 1804. The following year, a group of 26 Mennonites pooled resources to purchase all of the unsold land from Beasley and to discharge the mortgage held by the Six Nations Indians.

Many of the pioneers arriving from Pennsylvania after November 1803 bought land in a  60,000 acre section of Block Two from the German Company which had been established by a group of Mennonites from Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. The Tract included most of Block 2 of the previous Grand River Indian Lands. Many of the first farms were least four hundred acres in size.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whs.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/1930.pdf |title=History |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=1930 |website=Waterloo Historical Society 1930 Annual Meeting |publisher=Waterloo Historical Society |access-date=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://kitchener.foundlocally.com/Local/Info-CityHistoryToConfederation.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The German Company, represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker, had acquired the land from previous owner Richard Beasley; he had gotten into financial difficulties after buying the land in 1796 from Joseph Brant who represented the Six Nations. The payment to Beasly, in cash, arrived from Pennsylvania in kegs, carried in a wagon surrounded by armed guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterlooregionmuseum.com/collections-and-research/place-names-in-waterloo-region/waterloo-township/ |title=Waterloo Township |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2013 |website=Waterloo Region Museum Research |publisher=Region of Waterloo |access-date=13 March 2017 |quote=To correct the situation, a formal agreement was arranged between Brant and Beasley. This arrangement allowed Beasley to sell the bulk of Block Two in order to cover his mortgage obligations completely, while giving the Mennonite buyers legal title to land they had purchased. Beasley sold a 60,000 acre tract of land to the German Company of Pennsylvania represented by Daniel Erb and Samuel Bricker in November 1803. Beasley's sale to the German Company not only cleared him of a mortgage debt, but left him with 10,000 acres of Block Two land which he continued to sell into the 1830s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mennonites divided the land into smaller lots; two lots owned by [[Abraham Erb]] became the central core of Waterloo. Erb, often called the founder of Waterloo, had come to the area in 1806 from Franklin County, Pennsylvania. He bought 900 acres of bush land in 1806 from the German Company and founded a sawmill (1808) and grist mill (1816); these the focal point of the area. The grist mill operated continuously for 111 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waynecook.com/awaterloo.html|title= Plaque 25|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other early settlers of what would become Waterloo included Samuel and Elia Schneider who arrived in 1816. Until about 1820, settlements such as this were quite small.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="erb"&gt;{{cite web

In 1816 the new township was named after [[Waterloo, Belgium]], the site of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] (1815), which had ended the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in Europe. After that war, the new township became a popular destination for [[Germans|German]] immigrants. By the 1840s, German settlers had overtaken the Mennonites as the dominant segment of the population. Many Germans settled in the small hamlet to the southeast of Waterloo. In their honour, the village was named Berlin in 1833 ([[Berlin to Kitchener name change|renamed]] to Kitchener in 1916).

By 1831, Waterloo had a small post office in the King and Erb Street area, operated by Daniel Snyder, some 11 years before one would open in neighbouring Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.therecord.com/living-story/7165738-flash-from-the-past-tracking-waterloo-s-mail/|title=Flash from the Past: Tracking Waterloo's mail|first=rych|last=mills|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Smith's Canadian Gazetteer'' of 1846 states that the Township of Waterloo (smaller than Waterloo County) consisted primarily of Pennsylvanian Mennonites and immigrants directly from Germany who had brought money with them. At the time, many did not speak English.  There were eight grist and twenty saw mills in the township. In 1841, the population count was 4424. In 1846 the village of Waterloo had a population of 200, "mostly Germans". There was a grist mill and a sawmill and some tradesmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Wm.

Berlin was chosen as the site of the seat for the [[Waterloo County, Ontario|County of Waterloo]] in 1853. By 1869, the population was 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/provinceontario00mcevgoog|title=The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory: Containing Concise ...|first=|last=Henry McEvoy|date=March 5, 1869|publisher=Robertson &amp; Cook|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterloo was incorporated as a village in 1857 and became the Town of Waterloo in 1876 and the City of Waterloo in 1948.

In 2016, a corduroy road was unearthed in the King St. area of the business district; a second section was discovered near the Conestoga mall. The road was probably built by Mennonites using technology acquired in Lancaster County Pennsylvania, between the late 1790s and 1816. The log road was buried in about 1840 and a new road built on top of it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8926047-university-of-waterloo-researchers-hoping-to-borrow-corduroy-road-samples/  University of Waterloo researchers hoping to borrow corduroy road samples 26 September 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.therecord.com/news-story/8599125-corduroy-road-gives-a-glimpse-into-waterloo-s-past/ Corduroy road gives a glimpse into Waterloo’s past 10 May 2018]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Waterloo uptown.jpg|thumb|right|King Street South in Uptown Waterloo.]]
Waterloo's city centre is located near the intersection of King and Erb streets. Since 1961, the centrepiece has been the Waterloo Town Square shopping centre, which underwent a thorough renovation in 2006. Much of the mall was torn down and has been replaced by buildings that emphasize street-facing storefronts.

Residents refer to the Waterloo city centre as "uptown" (often capitalized), while "downtown" is reserved for the [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]] city centre, as Kitchener had been the dominant centre, and Waterloo was a small town on the Kitchener's north side.  Waterloo surged into a significant City in the third-quarter of the 20th Century, due in large part to its role as a university city.  It has also benefited with the growth of  Insurance companies.  Waterloo has prospered with the relationship between the Tech Sector, which has blossomed, and the University of Waterloo whose technology graduates have excelled.  Blackberry, formerly Research In Motion, is the best example.

The city centre was once along Albert Street, near the Marsland Centre and the [[Waterloo Public Library]]. The town hall, fire hall, and farmers' market were located there. Amidst some controversy, all were demolished between 1965 and 1969.

===Parks===
There are five main parks in the city:
#[[RIM Park]] occupies {{convert|200|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and is home to a variety of indoor and outdoor sporting facilities, including an eighteen-hole golf course, and the heritage Martin Farm House.
#Waterloo Park is in Uptown Waterloo, and contains historical buildings, a bandshell, animal displays, and the Lions' Lagoon water park in its {{convert|45|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. A grandstand was built in 1895 to house spectators for sporting events at the park's former oval track, but it was torn down in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterloo.ca/en/index.asp|title=Home|date=February 20, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Park Inn refreshment booth opened in June 1956, designed by a former Alderman, Charlie Voelker. It operates from May until September. The park is also known for its light displays during the Christmas holiday season, known as "Wonders of Winter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wondersofwinter.ca/|title=Wonders of Winter – A Festival of Lights in Waterloo Park|website=www.wondersofwinter.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Bechtel Park occupies {{convert|44|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and has many outdoor sporting facilities along with wetlands, meadows and hardwood forest. The park also includes an off-leash dog park, and adjacent city-operated cemetery. Hillside Park covers {{convert|25|ha|acre|abbr=off}} and includes two lighted ball diamonds.
#Lexington Park includes a ball diamond and a soccer pitch on the former site of the K-W Municipal Airport.
#Laurel Creek Conservation Area, at {{convert|300|ha|acre|abbr=off}}, lies in the northwest of the city.

===Waterways===
The [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] flows southward along the east side of the city. Its most significant tributary within the city is Laurel Creek, whose [[Sunfish Lake (Ontario)|source]] lies just to the west of the city limits and its mouth just to the east, and crosses much of the city's central areas including the University of Waterloo lands and Waterloo Park; it flows under the uptown area in a culvert. In the west end of the city, the [[Waterloo Moraine]] provides over 300,000 people in the region with drinking water. Much of the gently hilly Waterloo Moraine underlies existing developed areas. Ongoing urban growth, mostly in the form of low-density residential suburbs (in accordance with requests by land developers), will cover increasing amounts of the remaining undeveloped portions of the Waterloo Moraine.

Compared to the rest of Canada, it has moderate weather. Winter temperatures generally last from the middle of December until the middle of March, while summer temperatures generally occur between the middle of May to close to the end of September.

The city is also home to three well-known think tanks – the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]], an advanced centre for the study of foundational, theoretical physics and award-winning educational outreach in science; the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]], based at the University of Waterloo, which carries out innovative research in computer, engineering, mathematical and physical sciences; and the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]], an independent, nonpartisan think tank that addresses international governance challenges.

The city is part of [[Canada's Technology Triangle]] (CTT), a joint economic development initiative of Waterloo, [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] and the [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo, Ontario|Region of Waterloo]] that markets the region internationally. Despite its name, CTT does not focus exclusively on promoting technology industries, but on all aspects of economic development.

Waterloo has a strong technology sector with hundreds of high-tech firms.&lt;ref name="riding"/&gt; The dominant technology company in the city is [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]], makers of the [[BlackBerry]], which has its headquarters in the city and owns several office buildings near the University of Waterloo's main campus.

Notable Waterloo-based high-tech companies include:&lt;!-- New links in alphabetical order please --&gt;

Many other high-tech companies, with headquarters elsewhere, take advantage of the concentration of high-tech employees in the Waterloo area, and have research and development centres there. [[Shopify]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[Google]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Intel]], [[McAfee]], [[NCR Corporation]], [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Agfa]] are among the large, international technology companies with development offices in Waterloo.

Before it became known for technology, Waterloo was sometimes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vitacollections.ca/kpl-gsr/details.asp?ID=47406|title=Town of Waterloo, Ontario: The Hartford of Canada|website=vitacollections.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to as "the [[Hartford]] of Canada" because of the many insurance companies based in the area.&lt;ref name="cow history"/&gt; [[Manulife]], [[Sun Life Financial]], [[Equitable Life of Canada]] and [[Economical Insurance]] have a significant presence in the city.

Breweries and distilleries had been a significant industry in the Waterloo area until 1993 when a [[Labatt]]-owned brewery was shut down. Now the only major brewery is the [[Brick Brewing Company]]. Waterloo was the original home of distiller [[Seagram]] (also home town of many descendants of J.P. Seagram), which closed its Waterloo plant in 1992. Of the remaining Seagram buildings, [[Seagram Museum|one]] became home of the [[Centre for International Governance Innovation]] (CIGI), while others were converted into condominiums.

The city encourages location filming of movies and TV series and many have taken advantage of Waterloo locations. Recent titles include ''Downsizing'' (released in 2017), ''The Demolisher'' (2015) and ''Degrassi: The Next Generation'' (2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/search/title?locations=Waterloo,%20Ontario,%20Canada |title=Waterloo Locations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=IMDB |publisher=IMDB |access-date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Waterloo Ontario City Hall Pano.jpg|right|thumb|Waterloo City Hall]]
[[Waterloo City Council]] consists of seven councillors, each representing a [[Ward (politics)|ward]], and a mayor. The number of wards expanded from five to seven in the November 2006 elections. The current mayor of Waterloo is [[Dave Jaworsky]], who was elected in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/dave-jaworsky-elected-waterloo-mayor-1.2814880|title=Dave Jaworsky elected Waterloo mayor - CBC News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Waterloo City Council is constituted as follows:
* Ward 1 (Southwest): Bob Mavin
* Ward 2 (Northwest): Brian Bourke

Past and present city councils have been committed to providing for the explosive population growth that is coming with the local economic boom. Rapidly developing subdivisions are often described by their critics as urban sprawl that threatens environmentally sensitive areas and valuable agricultural land.

Waterloo was part of [[Waterloo County, Ontario]] until 1973 when a restructuring created the [[Waterloo Regional Municipality, Ontario|Regional Municipality of Waterloo]], (often referred to as Waterloo Region or the Region of Waterloo), which consists of the cities of Waterloo, [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], and the townships of [[Woolwich, Ontario|Woolwich]], [[Wilmot, Ontario|Wilmot]], [[Wellesley, Ontario (community)|Wellesley]], and [[North Dumfries, Ontario|North Dumfries]].  The Region handles many services, including paramedic services, policing, waste management, recreation, planning, roads and social services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/newslist/index.aspx?corpId=58cynQlfgqiAYQyTLmpurQeQuAleQuAl&amp;newsId=QXgUIE1G6huJ6eu741OyPlUsgeQuAleQuAl |title=Get to Know Us During Local Government Week |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=10 October 2012 |website=Waterloo Region |publisher=Waterloo Region |access-date=23 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In federal politics, the city of Waterloo is located entirely within the electoral district of the [[Waterloo (electoral district)|same name]]. In provincial politics, the city is contained within the [[Kitchener—Waterloo (provincial electoral district)|Kitchener–Waterloo]] [[Electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]].

===The Waterloo Award===
The Waterloo Award, established in 1997, is the highest civic honour a person can receive from the City of Waterloo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Waterloo Award | publisher =  The City of Waterloo | url = http://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/waterlooaward.asp | accessdate = November 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[File:Downtown Waterloo.png|thumb|Waterloo as seen from Kitchener]]

====Roads====
The [[Conestoga Parkway]], numbered as [[Ontario Highway 86|Highway 86]] within Waterloo, connects Waterloo with [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]], [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7/8]] (the continuation of the Conestoga Parkway), [[Ontario Highway 8]], [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]] and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] south of Highway 401.

Waterloo shares several of its north-south [[arterial road]]s with neighbouring Kitchener. They include (from east to west) [[Waterloo Regional Road 52|Bridge Street]], [[Waterloo Regional Road 8|Weber Street]], [[Waterloo Regional Road 15|King Street]], [[Waterloo Regional Road 50|Westmount Road]], [[Waterloo Regional Road 58|Fischer-Hallman Road]], and Ira Needles Boulevard. Regina Street (located between Weber and King Streets) and Albert Street (located between King Street and Westmount Road) are north-south collector roads located entirely within Waterloo.

The city's east-west thoroughfares are almost entirely located within city limits, with the exception of Union Street, which has a small section in Kitchener, and Bridgeport Road which has its eastern end in the Bridgeport area of Kitchener. Waterloo's major east-west arterial roads are (from south to north) Union Street, [[Waterloo Regional Road 9|Erb Street]], Bridgeport Road, [[Waterloo Regional Road 57|University Avenue]], Columbia Street, and Northfield Drive.

There are numerous bicycle pathways.  The Iron Horse Trail, which originates in Kitchener, enters Uptown Waterloo and links with the Laurel Trail that extends into the northern part of the city.

As of early 2017, construction of Phase 1 of the Region of Waterloo's light rail project was about 90 per cent complete&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desmond|first1=Paige|title=LRT project nearing completion after a challenging year|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7043823-lrt-project-nearing-completion-after-a-challenging-year/|publisher=Waterloo Region Record|date=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other major road reconstruction projects scheduled for 2017 and 2018 will bring new detours.

====Public transport====
[[File:GrandRiverTransit3.jpg|thumb|right|GRT iXpress bus (to be adapted for the ION bus service)]]
Public transport throughout [[Regional Municipality of Waterloo|Waterloo Region]] is provided by [[Grand River Transit]], created by a merger of Kitchener Transit (which served Waterloo) and Cambridge Transit in January 2000. GRT operates a number of bus routes in Waterloo, with many running into [[Kitchener, Ontario|Kitchener]]. In September 2005 an [[bus rapid transit|express bus]] route called iXpress was added for runs from downtown [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]] to [[Fairview Park Mall]] in south Kitchener to [[Conestoga Mall (Waterloo, Ontario)|Conestoga Mall]] in north Waterloo. The [[Ion rapid transit|ION]] light rail system is currently under construction and will supplement and integrate with the bus network upon completion.

====Light rapid transit====
{{See also|Rapid transit in Waterloo Region}}

The [[Galt, Preston and Hespeler electric railway]] (later called the [[Grand River Railway]]) began to operate in 1894 connecting Preston and Galt. In 1911, the line reached Hespeler, Kitchener (then called Berlin) and Waterloo; by 1916 it had been extended to Brantford/Port Dover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.explorewaterlooregion.com/2017/01/railway-history/ |title=CAMBRIDGE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON WATERLOO REGION'S LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 January 2017 |website=Waterloo Region |publisher=Waterloo Region |access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mills |first=Rych |date=10 January 2017 |title=Flash From the Past: Preston Car and Coach goes up in smoke |url=http://www.therecord.com/living-story/7058983-flash-from-the-past-preston-car-and-coach-goes-up-in-smoke/| work=Record |location=Kitchener |access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The electric rail system ended passenger services in April, 1955, leaving the city and region with no local rail services for more than 60 years.

In June 2011, Waterloo Region council confirmed approval of the plan for a [[light rail]] transit line between Conestoga Mall in north Waterloo and Fairview Park Mall in south Kitchener, with rapid buses through to the "downtown Galt" area of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therecord.com/news/local/article/548497--rail-plan-passes |title=Rail plan passes |publisher=TheRecord |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2012-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this Stage 1, the [[Ion rapid transit]] train will run  through the downtown/uptown areas of Kitchener and Waterloo.

Construction on the light rail system began in August 2014 and the Stage 1 service was expected to begin in 2017. Most of the rails had been installed by the end of 2016; the 
maintenance facility and all underground utility work had been completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Desmond|first1=Paige|title=LRT construction 90 per cent complete|url=http://www.therecord.com/news-story/7035590-lrt-construction-90-per-cent-complete/|accessdate=25 March 2017|work=Waterloo Region Record|date=23 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The start date of service was postponed to early 2018, however, because of delays in the manufacture and delivery of the vehicles by [[Bombardier Transportation]]. As of 24 February 2017, only a single sample of a train car had arrived for testing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kitchener.ctvnews.ca/bombardier-100-committed-to-delivering-ion-vehicles-by-end-of-2017-1.3299914 |title=Bombardier '100% committed' to delivering Ion vehicles by end of 2017 |last=Flanagan |first=Ryan |date=24 February 2017 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until light rail transit is extended to the "downtown Galt" area of Cambridge from Kitchener in Stage 2, rapid transit will be provided by bus; adapted iXpress buses will run between Fairview Park Mall and the Ainslie Street Transit Terminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RAPID TRANSIT ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT PHASE 2, STEP 3b – PREFERRED RAPID TRANSIT SYSTEM OPTION AND STAGING PLAN|url=http://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/projectinformation/resources/e-09-073_-_recommended_system_report.pdf|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |title=ION Bus Rapid Transit - Frequently Asked Questions  |url=http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp  |accessdate=24 March 2017  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024953/http://www.grt.ca/en/travelwithus/FAQ-ION-Bus-Rapid-Transit.asp  |archivedate=March 25, 2017  |df=mdy-all  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In late February 2017, plans for the Stage 2 (Cambridge section) of the Ion rail service were still in the very early stage; public consultations were just getting started at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/kitchener-waterloo/lrt-ion-cambridge-region-waterloo-1.3970421 |title=There's still wiggle room in the Region of Waterloo's LRT plans for Cambridge |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=8 February 2017 |website=CBC |publisher=CBC |access-date=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rapidtransit.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resourcesGeneral/FINAL_Stage-2-ION-PCC-No.-2-Display-Boards_reduced2.pdf |title=Stage 2 ION: Light Rail Transit (LRT) |last=Sharkey |first=Jackie |date=February 2017 |website=Region of Waterloo |publisher=Region of Waterloo |access-date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Railways===
Waterloo is not currently served by any regularly scheduled passenger rail service. [[Via Rail]] trains between [[Sarnia]] and Toronto stop at the nearby [[Kitchener, Ontario railway station|Kitchener railway station]] southeast of uptown Waterloo at the corner of Victoria Street and Weber Street. The station is accessible by local buses via Kitchener's downtown Charles Street transit terminal. A tourist train that previously ran out of Waterloo Station was moved to depart from [[St. Jacobs Farmers' Market]] when construction began on the [[Ion rapid transit|ION Light Rail]] line.

The nearest [[GO Transit]] railway station is [[Kitchener GO Station]], as the [[Kitchener line|Kitchener Line]] (formerly the Georgetown Line) has extended to Kitchener on December 19, 2011. In addition, Waterloo is served by GO buses which stop at the [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Wilfrid Laurier University]], with destinations of [[Mississauga City Centre Transit Terminal|Square One City Centre Terminal]], [[Milton GO Station]], and [[York University]].

In May 2007, city council gave approval for a non-profit tourist train to run between Waterloo Station&lt;ref name="waterloo.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterloo.ca/en/government/visitorandheritageinformationcentre.asp|title=Visitor and Heritage Information Centre|website=www.waterloo.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[St. Jacobs, Ontario|St. Jacobs]], reviving the route of the [[Waterloo-St. Jacobs Railway]] from the late 1990s. In 2015, the railway lost regular running rights south of Northfield Drive to make way for the [[Ion rapid transit]] project. All Market Train service now departs from the St. Jacobs Farmers Market. The [[Waterloo Central Railway]] are run on trains at 10am, 12pm, and 2pm from April to November. The Waterloo Station continues to operate as a Visitor &amp; Heritage Information Centre&lt;ref name="waterloo.ca"/&gt; and is located at 10 Father David Bauer Drive.

===Intercity transport===
In addition to GO bus services mentioned above, [[Coach Canada]] offers service from the [[Charles St. Transit Terminal|Charles St. Terminal]] in Kitchener to [[McMaster University]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario]], with various stops, including [[Sheffield, Ontario|Sheffield]], [[Rockton, Ontario|Rockton]] and [[Dundas, Ontario|Dundas]] in between.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coachcanada.com/CoachUsaAssets/files/116/HamSep2013.pdf|title=Bus Schedules – Charters – Sightseeing – Tours - Coach USA|website=www.coachcanada.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greyhound buses to [[Toronto Bus Terminal]] also service Waterloo at a stop on the University of Waterloo campus, with some trips operating via [[Guelph, Ontario|Guelph]].

===Airport===
The closest airport to Waterloo is the [[Region of Waterloo International Airport]] in nearby Breslau, but while it is a thriving [[general aviation|general-aviation]] field, it is not heavily served by scheduled airlines. Most air travelers use Toronto's [[Toronto Pearson International Airport|Lester B. Pearson International Airport]] or [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]]. [[WestJet]] has scheduled daily non-stop service to Calgary from Waterloo International Airport using Boeing 737-700 aircraft in winter season and larger Boeing 737-800 aircraft in spring and summer season. They started service out of Region of Waterloo International Airport on May 14, 2007, for the summer season and then decided to fly year-round due to strong passenger demand. During the winter months [[Sunwing Airlines]] offers service to [[Dominican Republic]]. Recent upgrades to the runways, approach lighting and terminal building have permitted larger aircraft to use this airport. Airlines that no longer serve the airport include Trillium and Bearskin (to Ottawa), Mesaba (Northwest Airlines' feeder to Detroit), [[American Airlines]] (to Chicago) and Sky Service (to sun destinations).

===Health care===
The hospitals serving Waterloo are all located in Kitchener. There is [[Grand River Hospital]], which includes the K-W and Freeport health centres (formerly independent hospitals that amalgamated in April 1995), and [[St. Mary's General Hospital]].

==Education==
The [[Intelligent Community Forum]] named Waterloo the Top Intelligent Community of 2007.&lt;ref name = "ICF"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.intelligentcommunity.org/displaycommon.cfm?an=1&amp;subarticlenbr=220

===Secondary===
Until the 1960s, with a few minor exceptions, Waterloo students would attend high school in Berlin/Kitchener. In 1914, [[Waterloo Lutheran Seminary]] added a high school department, named the College School, primarily to provide secondary education for prospective seminary students. The College School was discontinued in 1929. Between 1940 and 1950, due to overcrowding in [[Kitchener–Waterloo Collegiate and Vocational School]], some grade nine classes were housed in [[Elizabeth Ziegler Public School]].

Starting in the 1960s, several high schools opened in Waterloo. In 1958 it was announced that Waterloo would have its own secondary school. A $1,247,268 school was built on a 20-acre (81,000 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) site on Hazel Street. [[Waterloo Collegiate Institute]] opened on September 6, 1960. In 1968, Laurel Vocational School (later University Heights Secondary School) opened, and in 1972 Waterloo's third public high school, [[Bluevale Collegiate Institute]], opened. In 1965, St. David Senior School, which served grades 7–10, opened in the north of the city. St. David was turned into a high school in 1985 and was renamed [[St. David Catholic Secondary School]]. University Heights Secondary School closed in 2004 and [[Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School (Waterloo, Ontario)|Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School]] opened that same year.

As of 2007, there were five high schools based in Waterloo. Three are operated by the [[Waterloo Region District School Board]]: Bluevale Collegiate Institute (east), Sir John A. Macdonald Secondary School (west), and Waterloo Collegiate Institute (central). two are operated by the [[Waterloo Catholic District School Board]]: St. David Catholic Secondary School and Resurrection Catholic Secondary School.

===Post-secondary===
The main campuses of the [[University of Waterloo]] and [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] are located in Waterloo. This includes the many associated universities and colleges, including [[St. Jerome's University]], [[St. Paul's University College]], [[Conrad Grebel University College]], [[Renison University College]] and the Balsillie School of International Affairs. Kitchener-based [[Conestoga College]] also has a Waterloo campus, located at the former University Heights Secondary School on University Avenue near Weber Street. Conestoga purchased the building in January 2006 for nearly $6 million from the Waterloo Region District School Board. It is double the size of its previous Waterloo campus on King Street, which was sold after the University Heights building was acquired.

'''''Wayward Pines''''' is an American [[mystery fiction|mystery]], [[science fiction]] television series based on the [[The Wayward Pines Trilogy|''Wayward Pines'' novels]] by [[Blake Crouch]]. Developed for television by [[Chad Hodge]], the pilot was directed by [[M. Night Shyamalan]], with both as executive producers. The series premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] on May 14, 2015, and the first season concluded on July 23, 2015.

On December 9, 2015, Fox renewed the series for a second season which aired from May 25 to July 27, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2016/03/03/m-night-shyamalans-10-episode-psychological-thriller-wayward-pines-returns-wednesday-may-25-on-fox-171413/20160303fox03/|title=M.

==Premise==
In the first season, Ethan Burke ([[Matt Dillon]]) is a [[U.S. Secret Service]] agent investigating the disappearance of two fellow agents in the mysterious small town of Wayward Pines, [[Idaho]]. Ethan awakens from a car accident unable to contact the outside world and unable to leave. He finds one of the agents dead and the other, his former lover Kate Hewson ([[Carla Gugino]]), settled down in the seemingly idyllic town. But the inhabitants of Wayward Pines are trapped there by an electrified fence and set of rules enforced by the strict Sheriff Arnold Pope ([[Terrence Howard]]). Any attempt to escape is punished by a public execution known as a "reckoning". Ethan reconnects with his wife and son while working to discover the truth.

In the second season, Dr. Theo Yedlin ([[Jason Patric]]) is a surgeon who is caught in the battle between Jason Higgins ([[Tom Stevens (actor)|Tom Stevens]]), leader of the First Generation that took over Wayward Pines following the Abbie incident, and the underground rebels led by Ethan's son Ben Burke ([[Charlie Tahan]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12947">The '''worst-case execution time''' ('''WCET''') of a [[computation]]al task is the maximum length of time the task could take to execute on a specific [[computer hardware|hardware]] platform.

== What it is used for ==

Worst case execution time is typically used in reliable [[real-time systems]], where understanding the worst case timing behaviour of software is important for reliability or correct functional behaviour. 

As an example, a computer system that controls the behaviour of an engine in a vehicle might need to respond to inputs within a specific amount of time. One component that makes up the response time is the time spent executing the software – hence if the software worst case execution time can be determined, then the designer of the system can use this with other techniques such as [[Sheduling analysis real-time systems|schedulability analysis]] to ensure that the system responds fast enough.

While WCET is potentially applicable to many real-time systems, in practice an assurance of WCET is mainly used by real-time systems that are related to high reliability or safety. For example, in airborne software some attention to software is required by [[DO178B]] section 6.3.4. The increasing use of software in automotive systems is also driving the need to use WCET analysis of software.

In the design of some systems, WCET is often used as an input to [[Scheduling analysis real-time systems|schedulability analysis]], although a much more common use of WCET in critical systems is to ensure that the pre-allocated timing budgets in a partition-scheduled system such as [[ARINC 653]] are not violated.

== Calculation ==

Since the early days of embedded computing, embedded software developers have either used:
* end-to-end measurements of code, for example performed by setting an I/O pin on the device to high at the start of the task, and to low at the end of the task and using a logic analyzer to measure the longest pulse width, or by measuring within the software itself using the processor clock or instruction count.
* manual static analysis techniques such as counting assembler instructions for each function, loop etc. and then combining them.

Both of these techniques have limitations. End to end measurements place a high burden on software testing to achieve the longest path; counting instructions is only applicable to simple software and hardware. In both cases, a margin for error is often used to account for untested code, hardware performance approximations or mistakes. A margin of 20% is often used, although there is very little justification used for this figure, save for historical confidence ("it worked last time"). 

As software and hardware have increased in complexity, they have driven the need for tool support.  Complexity is increasingly becoming an issue in both static analysis and measurements. It is difficult to judge how wide the error margin should be and how well tested the software system is. System safety arguments based on a high-water mark achieved during testing are widely used, but become harder to justify as the software and hardware become less predictable.

In the future, it is likely that a requirement for safety critical systems is that they are analyzed using both static and measurement-based approaches.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

=== Considerations ===
The problem of finding WCET by analysis is equivalent to the [[halting problem]] and is therefore insoluble in the general case. Fortunately for the kind of systems that engineers typically want to find WCET for, the software is typically well structured, will always terminate and is analyzable.

Most methods for finding a WCET involve approximations (usually a rounding upwards when there are uncertainties) and hence in practice the exact WCET itself is often regarded as unobtainable. Instead, different techniques for finding the WCET produce estimates for the WCET.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://moss.csc.ncsu.edu/~mueller/ftp/pub/mueller/papers/1257.pdf The worst-case execution-time problem—overview of methods and survey of tools]", Wilhelm, Reinhard, et al., ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS), Vol. 7, No. 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Those estimates are typically pessimistic, meaning that the estimated WCET is known to be higher than the real WCET (which is usually what is desired). Much work on WCET analysis is on reducing the pessimism in analysis so that the estimated value is low enough to be valuable to the system designer.

WCET analysis usually refers to the execution time of single thread, task or process.  However, on modern hardware, especially multi-core, other tasks in the system will impact the WCET of a given task if they share cache, memory lines and other hardware features.  Further, task scheduling events such as [[Blocking (scheduling)|blocking]] or to be [[interrupt]]ions should be considered in WCET analysis if they can occur in a particular system.  Therefore, it is important to consider the context in which WCET analysis is applied.

=== Automated approaches ===
There are many automated approaches to calculating WCET beyond the manual techniques above. These include:
* analytical techniques to improve test cases to increase confidence in end to end measurements
* static analysis of the software (“static” meaning without executing the software).
* combined approaches, often referred to as “hybrid” analysis, being a combination of measurements and structural analysis

==== Static analysis techniques ====
A static WCET tool attempts to estimate WCET by examining the computer software without executing it directly on the hardware.  Static analysis techniques have dominated research in the area since the late 1980s, although in an industrial setting, end-to-end measurements approaches were the standard practice.

Static analysis tools work at a high-level to determine the structure of a [[computer program|program]]'s task, working either on a piece of [[source code]] or disassembled binary [[executable]]. They also work at a low-level, using timing information about the real hardware that the task will execute on, with all its specific features. By combining those two kinds of analysis, the tool attempts to give an upper bound on the time required to execute a given task on a given hardware platform.

At the low-level, static WCET analysis is complicated by the presence of architectural features that improve the average-case performance of the [[central processing unit|processor]]: instruction/data [[CPU cache|caches]], [[Branch predictor|branch prediction]] and [[Pipeline (computing)|instruction pipeline]]s, for example. It is possible, but increasingly difficult, to determine tight WCET bounds if these modern architectural features are taken into account in the timing model used by the analysis. For example, cache locking techniques can be used for simplifying WCET estimation and providing predictability.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/286925817_A_Survey_Of_Techniques_for_Cache_Locking A Survey Of Techniques for Cache Locking]", S. Mittal, ACM TODAES, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Certification authorities such as the [[European Aviation Safety Agency]], therefore, rely on model validation suites. {{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

Static analysis has resulted in good results for simpler hardware, however a possible limitation of static analysis is that the hardware (the CPU in particular) has reached a complexity which is extremely hard to model. In particular, the modelling process can introduce errors from several sources: errors in chip design, lack of documentation, errors in documentation, errors in model creation; all leading to cases where the model predicts a different behavior to that observed on real hardware. Typically, where it is not possible to accurately predict a behavior, a pessimistic result is used, which can lead to the WCET estimate being much larger than anything achieved at run-time. 

Obtaining tight static WCET estimation is particularly difficult on multi-core processors. 

There are a number of commercial and academic tools that implement various forms of static analysis.

==== Measurement and hybrid techniques ====
Measurement-based and hybrid approaches usually try to measure the execution times of short code segments on the real hardware, which are then combined in a higher level analysis. Tools take into account the structure of the software (e.g. loops, branches), to produce an estimate of the WCET of the larger program. The rationale is that it's hard to test the longest path in complex software, but it is easier to test the longest path in many smaller components of it. A worst case effect needs only to be seen once during testing for the analysis to be able to combine it with other worst case events in its analysis.

Typically, the small sections of software can be measured automatically using techniques such as instrumentation (adding markers to the software) or with hardware support such as debuggers, and CPU hardware tracing modules. These markers result in a trace of execution, which includes both the path taken through the program and the time at which different points were executed. The trace is then analyzed to determine the maximum time that each part of the program has ever taken to execute, what the maximum observed iteration time of each loop is and whether there are any parts of the software that are untested ([[Code coverage]]).

Measurement-based WCET analysis has resulted in good results for both simple and complex hardware, although like static analysis it can suffer excessive pessimism in multi-core situations, where the impact of one core on another is hard to define. A limitation of measurement is that it relies on observing the worst-case effects during testing (although not necessarily at the same time). It can be hard to determine if the worst case effects have necessarily been tested.

There are a number of commercial and academic tools that implement various forms of measurement-based analysis.

== Research ==

The most active research groups are in Sweden (Mälardalen, Linköping), Germany (Saarbrücken, Dortmund, Braunschweig), France (Toulouse, Saclay, Rennes), Austria (Vienna), UK (University of York and Rapita Systems Ltd), Italy (Bologna), Spain (Cantabria, Valencia), and Switzerland (Zurich).  Recently, the topic of code-level timing analysis has found more attention outside of Europe by research groups in the US (North Carolina, Florida), Canada, Australia, Bangladesh(MBI LAB and RDS), Kingdom of Saudi Arabia-UQU(HISE LAB) and Singapore.

=== WCET Tool Challenge ===

The first international WCET Tool Challenge took place during the autumn of 2006. It was organized by the [[Mälardalen University|University of Mälardalen]] and sponsored by the ARTIST2 Network of Excellence on Embedded Systems Design. The aim of the Challenge was to inspect and to compare different approaches in analyzing the worst-case execution time. All available tools and prototypes able to determine safe upper bounds for the WCET of tasks have participated. The final results&lt;ref&gt;[http://rw4.cs.uni-sb.de/~lili/papers/WCETToolChallengep_Extl.pdf ]&lt;/ref&gt; were presented in November 2006 at the [[International Symposium On Leveraging Applications of Formal Methods, Verification and Validation|ISoLA 2006]] International Symposium in [[Paphos]], Cyprus.

A second Challenge took place in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrtc.mdh.se/projects/WCC08/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''XTS-400''' is a [[multilevel security|multilevel]] secure computer [[operating system]]. It is [[multiuser]] and [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] that uses multilevel scheduling in processing data and information. It works in networked environments and supports [[Gigabit Ethernet]] and both [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]].

The XTS-400 is a combination of [[Intel Corporation|Intel]] [[x86]] hardware and the '''Secure Trusted Operating Program''' ('''STOP''') [[operating system]]. XTS-400 was developed by [[BAE Systems]], and originally released as version 6.0 in December 2003.

STOP provides ''high-assurance'' security and was the first general-purpose operating system with a [[Common Criteria]] assurance level rating of EAL5 or above.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/products/&lt;/ref&gt; The XTS-400 can host, and be trusted to separate, multiple, concurrent data sets, users, and networks at different sensitivity levels.

The XTS-400 provides both an ''untrusted'' environment for normal work and a [[trusted operating system|trusted]] environment for administrative work and for privileged applications. The untrusted environment is similar to traditional [[Unix]] environments. It provides binary compatibility with [[Linux]] applications running most Linux commands and tools as well as most Linux applications without the need for recompiling. This untrusted environment includes an [[X Window System]] [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], though all windows on a screen must be at the same sensitivity level.

To support the trusted environment and various security features, STOP provides a set of proprietary [[application programming interface|API]]s to applications. In order to develop programs that use these proprietary  
APIs, a special software development environment (SDE) is needed. The SDE is also needed in order to port some complicated Linux/Unix applications to the XTS-400.

A new version of the STOP operating system, STOP 7&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baesystems.com/article/BAES_043838/stop-os STOP 7]&lt;/ref&gt; has since been introduced, with claims to have improved performance and new features such as [[RBAC]].

==Uses==
As a high-assurance, MLS system, XTS-400 can be used in [[cross-domain solution]]s, which typically need a piece of privileged software to be developed which can temporarily circumvent one or more security features in a controlled manner. Such pieces are outside the CC evaluation of the XTS-400, but they can be accredited.

The XTS-400 can be used as a desktop, server, or network gateway. The interactive environment, typical Unix [[command line interface|command line tools]], and a GUI are present in support of a desktop solution. Since the XTS-400 supports multiple, concurrent network connections at different sensitivity levels, it can be used to replace several [[Multiple Single-Level|single-level]] desktops connected to several different networks.

In support of server functionality, the XTS-400 can be implemented in a [[rackmount]] configuration, accepts a [[uninterruptible power supply]] (UPS), allows multiple network connections, accommodates many [[hard disk]]s on a [[SCSI]] subsystem (also saving disk blocks using a ''sparse file'' implementation in the [[file system]]), and provides a trusted backup/save tool. Server software, such as an Internet daemon, can be ported to run on the XTS-400.

A popular application for high-assurance systems like the XTS-400 is to guard information flow between two networks of differing security characteristics. Several customer guard solutions are available based on XTS systems.

==Security==
XTS-400 version 6.0.E completed a Common Criteria (CC) evaluation in March 2004 at EAL4 augmented with ALC_FLR.3 (validation report CCEVS-VR-04-0058.) Version 6.0.E also conformed with the protection profiles entitled [[Labeled Security Protection Profile]] (LSPP) and [[Controlled Access Protection Profile]] (CAPP), though both profiles are surpassed in functionality and assurance.

XTS-400 version 6.1.E completed evaluation in March 2005 at EAL5 augmented with ALC_FLR.3 and ATE_IND.3 (validation report CCEVS-VR-05-0094), still conforming to the LSPP and CAPP. The EAL5+ evaluation included analysis of covert channels and additional vulnerability analysis and testing by the [[National Security Agency]].

XTS-400 version 6.4.U4 completed evaluation in July 2008 at EAL5 augmented with ALC_FLR.3 and ATE_IND.3 (validation report CCEVS-VR-VID10293-2008), also still conforming to the LSPP and CAPP.  Like its predecessor, it also included analysis of covert channels and additional vulnerability analysis and testing by the [[National Security Agency]].

The official postings for all the XTS-400 evaluations can be seen on the Validated Product List.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niap-ccevs.org/cc-scheme/vpl/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/products_OS.html#OS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main security feature that sets STOP apart from most operating systems is the mandatory sensitivity policy. Support for a mandatory integrity policy, also sets STOP apart from most MLS or trusted systems. While a sensitivity policy deals with preventing unauthorized disclosure, an integrity policy deals with preventing unauthorized deletion or modification (such as the damage that a [[computer virus|virus]] might attempt). Normal (i.e., untrusted) users do not have the ''discretion'' to change the sensitivity or integrity levels of objects. The [[Bell–LaPadula model|Bell–LaPadula]] and [[Biba Model|Biba]] formal models are the basis for these policies.

Both the sensitivity and integrity policies apply to all users and all objects on the system. STOP provides 16 hierarchical sensitivity levels, 64 non-hierarchical sensitivity categories, 8 hierarchical integrity levels, and 16 non-hierarchical integrity categories. The mandatory sensitivity policy enforces the [[United States of America|United States]] [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] data sensitivity classification model (i.e., "Unclassified," "Secret," "Top Secret"), but can be configured for commercial environments.

Other security features include:
* Identification and [[authentication]], which forces users to be uniquely identified and authenticated before using any system services or accessing any information; the user’s identification is used for access control decisions and for accountability via the auditing mechanism;
* [[Discretionary access control]] (DAC), which appears just as in [[Unix]], including the presence of [[access control list]]s on every object; the set-id function is supported in a controlled fashion;
* A mandatory ''subtype'' policy, which allows some of the functionality of trusted systems which support a full ''type enforcement'' or ''domain-type enforcement'' policy;
* Auditing of all security-relevant events and trusted tools to allow administrators to detect and analyze potential security violations;
* [[Trusted path]], which allows a user to be sure s/he is interacting directly with the ''trusted security functions'' (TSF) during sensitive operations; this prevents, for example, a [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojan horse]] from [[spoofing attack|spoofing]] the login process and stealing a user’s password;
* Isolation of the operating system code and data files from the activity of untrusted users and processes which, in particular, prevents [[malware]] from corrupting or otherwise affecting the system;
* Separation of processes from one another (so that one process/user cannot tamper with the internal data and code of another process);
* [[Reference monitor]] functionality, so that no access can bypass scrutiny by the operating system;
* Strong separation of administrator, operator, and user roles using the mandatory integrity policy;
* Residual information (i.e., object reuse) mechanisms to prevent data scavenging;
* Trusted, evaluated tools for configuring the system, managing security-critical data, and repairing file systems;
* Self-testing of security mechanisms, on demand;
* Exclusion of higher layer network services from the TSF, so that the TSF is not susceptible to the publicly known vulnerabilities in those services.

STOP comes in only a single package, so that there is no confusion about whether a particular package has all security features present. Mandatory policies cannot be disabled. Policy configuration does not require a potentially complicated process of defining large sets of domains and data types (and the attendant access rules).

To maintain the trustworthiness of the system, the XTS-400 must be installed, [[booting|booted]], and configured by trusted personnel. The site must also provide [[physical security|physical protection]] of the hardware components. The system, and software upgrades, are shipped from BAE Systems in a secure fashion.

For customers who want them, XTS-400 supports a [[Mission Support Cryptographic Unit]] (MSCU) and [[Fortezza]] cards. The MSCU performs [[Type 1 product|''type 1'' cryptography]] and has been separately scrutinized by the [[United States of America|United States]] [[National Security Agency]].

==Hardware==
The CC evaluation forces particular [[computer hardware|hardware]] to be used in the XTS-400. Though this places restrictions on the hardware configurations that can be used, several configurations are possible. The XTS-400 uses only standard PC, [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) components, except for an optional [[Mission Support Cryptographic Unit]] (MSCU).

The hardware is based on an Intel [[Xeon]] ([[Pentium 4|P4]]) [[central processing unit]] (CPU) at up to 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz speeds, supporting up to 2 GB of main memory.

A [[Peripheral Component Interconnect]] (PCI) bus is used for add-in cards such as [[Gigabit Ethernet]]. Up to 16 simultaneous [[Ethernet]] connections can be made, all of which can be configured at different mandatory security and integrity levels.

A [[SCSI]] subsystem is used to allow a number of high-performance peripherals to be attached. One SCSI peripheral is a [[PC Card]] reader that can support [[Fortezza]]. Multiple [[SCSI host adapter]]s can be included.

==History==
The XTS-400 has been preceded by several evaluated ancestors, all developed by the same group: Secure Communications Processor (SCOMP), XTS-200, and XTS-300. All of the predecessor products were evaluated under [[Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria]] (TCSEC) (a.k.a. [[Rainbow Series|Orange Book]]) standards. SCOMP completed evaluation in 1984 at the highest functional and assurance level then in place: A1. Since then the product has evolved from proprietary hardware and interfaces to commodity hardware and Linux interfaces.

The XTS-200 was designed as a general-purpose operating system supporting a [[Unix-like]] application and user environment. XTS-200 completed evaluation in 1992 at the B3 level.

The XTS-300 transitioned from proprietary, mini-computer hardware to COTS, Intel x86 hardware. XTS-300 completed evaluation in 1994 at the B3 level. XTS-300 also went through several ratings maintenance cycles (a.k.a. RAMP), very similar to an ''assurance continuity'' cycle under CC, ultimately ending up with version 5.2.E being evaluated in 2000.

Development of the XTS-400 began in June 2000. The main customer-visible change was specific conformance to the [[Linux]] [[Application programming interface|API]]. Though the security features of the XTS system put some restrictions on the API and require additional, proprietary interfaces, conformance is close enough that most applications will run on the XTS without recompilation. Some security features were added or improved as compared to earlier versions of the system and performance was also improved.

As of July 2006, enhancements continue to be made to the XTS line of products.

On September 5, 2006, the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|United States Patent Offices]] granted BAE Systems Information Technology, LLC. United States Patent # 7,103,914 "Trusted computer system".

==Architecture==
STOP is a [[monolithic kernel]] operating system (as is Linux). Though it provides a Linux-compatible API, STOP is not derived from [[Unix]] or any [[Unix-like]] system. STOP is highly layered, highly modularized, and relatively compact and simple. These characteristics have historically facilitated high-assurance evaluations.

STOP is layered into four ''rings'' and each ring is further subdivided into layers. The innermost ring has hardware privilege and applications, including privileged commands, run in the outermost. The inner three rings constitute the ''[[kernel (computer science)|kernel]]''. Software in an outer ring is prevented from tampering with software in an inner ring. The kernel is part of every process’s [[address space]] and is needed by both normal and privileged processes.

A ''[[security kernel]]'' occupies the innermost and most privileged ring and enforces all mandatory policies. It provides a virtual process environment, which isolates one process from another. It performs all low-level scheduling, [[memory management]], and interrupt handling. The security kernel also provides [[Input/output|I/O]] services and an [[Inter-process communication|IPC]] message mechanism. The security kernel’s data is global to the system.

Trusted system services (TSS) software executes in ring 1. TSS implements file systems, implements [[TCP/IP]], and enforces the [[discretionary access control]] policy on file system objects. TSS's data is local to the process within which it is executing.

Operating system services (OSS) executes in ring 2. OSS provides Linux-like API to applications as well as providing additional proprietary interfaces for using the security features of the system. OSS implements signals, process groups, and some memory devices. OSS's data is local to the process within which it is executing.

Software is considered trusted if it performs functions upon which the system depends to enforce the [[security policy]] (e.g., the establishment of user authorization). This determination is based on integrity level and privileges. Untrusted software runs at integrity level 3, with all integrity categories, or lower. Some processes require privileges to perform their functions—for example the Secure Server needs to access the User Access Authentication database, kept at ''system high'', while establishing a session for a user at a lower sensitivity level.

==Potential weaknesses==
The XTS-400 can provide a high level of security in many application environments, but trade-offs are made to attain it. Potential weaknesses for some customers may include:
* Lower performance due to more rigid internal layering and modularity and to additional security checks;
* Fewer application-level features available out-of-the-box;
* Some source level changes may be necessary to get complicated applications to run;
* The trusted user interface does not utilize a GUI and has limited command line features;
* Limited hardware choices;
* Not suited for embedded or real-time environments.

The sensor exploits enhanced surface area (and thus surface activity) intrinsic to all nano-sized materials, including ZnO nanorods. [[Adsorption]] of molecules on the nanorods can be detected through variation of the nanorods' properties, such as photoluminescence, [[electrical conductivity]], vibration frequency, mass, etc. The simplest and thus most popular way is to pass [[electrical current]] through the nanorods and observe its changes upon exposure to gas.
