      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6943">'''ArtBots: The Robot Talent Show''' is an international [[robot]] [[talent show]] held in [[New York City]] and other cities.  It is sponsored by a variety of arts organizations, produced by an army of volunteers, and is directed and curated by [[dorkbot]] founder, and teacher Douglas Repetto.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,59622,00.html |title=The Robot Won't Bite You, Dear |last=Delio |first=Michelle |date=15 July 2003 |work=Wired News |access-date=7 July 2015 |via= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030717121117/http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0%2C1282%2C59622%2C00.html |archive-date=17 July 2003 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Child interacts with an ArtBot at 2011 show.jpg|thumb|Child interacts with robot at ArtBots 2011 show.]]
ArtBots is vaguely modeled on a [[parody|tongue-in-cheek]] version of [[Battlebots]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/business/worlds-of-robots-and-art-collide-at-dublin-exhibition-1.468531|title = Worlds of Robots and Art Collide at Dublin Exhibition|last = |first = |date = 15 July 2005|work = The Irish Times|access-date = 8 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; where robotic art submissions are curated for a group show based not on their ability to fight one another, but on their ability to make (or be) [[art]]. Repetto felt that there was too much attention focused on "violent, competitive aspects of robotics" and wished to create something more comprehensive.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Repetto also described how robots have a "creative side."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/30/technology/circuits/30ROBO.html|title = Robots Find a Muse Other Than Mayhem|last = Gallagher|first = David F.|date = 30 May 2002|work = The New York Times|access-date = 7 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robots competing in ArtBots were very diverse in function and build.  An interesting inclusion was Tribbalation, a round, whiskered robot which through sensors responds to "stimuli like compliments and stroking."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Neil is a [[humanoid]] robot that responds to participants and emotes moods based on its interaction.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Robozoic, by Brett Doar, has a very simple brain created with a rotating cylinder which works similarly to a [[music box]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8LZRM6MlcC&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=%22ArtBots%22&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ArtBots%22&amp;f=false|title = Robot Showpieces|last = |first = |date = January 2007|journal = PC Magazine|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 7 July 2015|volume = 26|page = 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots in ArtBots aren't always the art itself, for example, some robots participating draw or create music.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-robots-are-coming-1.459404|title = The Robots are Coming|last = |first = |date = 23 June 2005|work = The Irish Times|access-date = 8 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; One especially interesting artistic robot was [[Cultured neuronal network|MEART]], a brain-cell/mechanical arm hybrid which creates abstract "portraits."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.nature.com/news/1998/030714/full/news030714-2.html|title = Artbots Show Talent|last = Pearson|first = Helen|date = 15 July 2003|journal = Nature|doi = 10.1038/news030714-2|pmid = |access-date = 7 July 2015|issn = 1744-7933}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The show runs for a number of days, and two (nominal) prizes are awarded: the People's Choice Award goes to the work that gets the most audience votes, while the Robot Choice Award is decided on by the artists themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://artdaily.com/news/6278/ArtBots--The-Robot-Talent-Show#.VZwQVflVhBc|title = ArtBots: The Robot Talent Show|last = |first = |date = 2003|work = Art Daily|access-date = 7 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the 2003 competition included the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots (LEMUR), which consisted of five robots which acted as self-playing instruments and took the Audience Choice Award.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The winners of the Robots' Choice Award was micro.adam and micro.eva who respond to one another.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ArtBots is dedicated to the creation, presentation, and celebration of robotic art and art-making robotics, and to the promotion of the idea that robotics, and new technologies in general, are accessible, fun, intelligible, and useful, and that everyone, not just a technological elite, can participate in and influence society's technological progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/NYU_artbots.pdf|title = ArtBots: The Robot Talent Show|last = Galanter|first = Philip|date = 2003|work = Connect: Information Technology at NYU|access-date = 7 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some artists working with electronics and robotics are invited to participate in ArtBots, showing a "[[Kinetic energy|kinetic]] tree" at the 2005 festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/arts/this-show-is-for-the-birds-119234904.html|title = This Show is for the Birds|last = Mayes|first = Alison|date = 5 April 2011|work = Winnipeg Free Press|access-date = 8 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Workshops have been included at some festivals to teach participants how to create their own robots.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The '''Assyrian eclipse''', also known as the Bur-Sagale eclipse, is a [[solar eclipse]] recorded in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] [[eponym list]]s, most likely dating the ninth year of the reign of king [[Ashur-dan III]].  The eclipse is identified with the one that occurred on 15 June 763 BC (proleptic Julian calendar).

The entry is short and reads:
:"[year of] Bur-Sagale of Guzana. Revolt in the city of Assur. In the month [[Babylonian_calendar#Months|Simanu]] an eclipse of the sun took place."
The phrase used — ''[[shamash]]'' ("the sun") ''akallu'' ("bent", "twisted", "crooked", "distorted", "obscured") — has been interpreted  as a reference to a solar eclipse since the first [[decipherment of cuneiform]] in the mid 19th century.
The name ''Bur-Sagale'' (also rendered ''Bur-Saggile, Pur-Sagale'' or ''Par-Sagale'') is the name of the [[limmu]] official 
in the [[eponym dating system|eponymous year]].

In 1867, [[Sir Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baronet|Henry Rawlinson]] identified near-[[total eclipse]] of 15 June 763 BC as the most likely candidate (the month ''Simanu'' corresponding to the May/June lunation),&lt;ref&gt;Rawlinson, Henry Creswicke, "The Assyrian Canon Verified by the Record of a Solar Eclipse, B.C. 763", ''The Athenaeum: Journal of Literature, Science and the Fine Arts'', nr. 2064, 660-661 [18 May 1867].[https://books.google.com/books?id=L5dTAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA660#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true]&lt;/ref&gt;  visible in northern Assyria just before noon. 
This date has been widely accepted ever since;  the identification is also substantiated by other astronomical observations from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Hunger, "Zur Datierung der neuassyrischen Eponymenliste," ''Altorientalische Forschungen'', Vol. 35:2, 2008, pp. 323-325. An English translation is available on the web: [http://kristenfrihet.se/kf4/dating.htm#_ftnref1]&lt;/ref&gt;

This record is one of the crucial pieces of evidence providing an absolute [[chronology of the Ancient Near East]] for the Assyrian period.

&lt;!--
[[Babylonian calendar]]: (explain relevance to the topic)

The mainstream view is that the beginning of the Babylonian year was not determined by observing the equinox, but by observing the appearance of certain constellations.&lt;ref&gt;Schaumberger, Johann ''3. Ergänzungsheft zum Ersten und Zweiten Buch von Franz Xaver Kugler, Sterndienst and Sternkunde in Babel'', Münster in Westfalen, Verlag der Aschendorffschen Verlagsbuchhandlung, 1935, pp. 340-344 [https://archive.org/stream/gri_33125008378909#page/n109/mode/1up]; Hermann Hunger, "A Scheme for Intercalary Months from Babylonia," in ''Wiener Zeitschrift für die Kunde des Morgenlandes'',67. Band, Wien 1975, pp. 21-28. Cf. also Hermann Hunger's article in ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie'', Band 10, Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York, 2005, p. 592.&lt;/ref&gt;

A detailed examination of 101 New Year dates between 748 and 539 BC shows that the dates of the New Year shifted{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}. In the eighth century it often began before the vernal equinox. The commonly-held belief is that "the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year in the eighth century fell about two weeks before the equinox." During the reign of [[Nabopolassar]] (625-605 BC) there was a shift to about ten days after the equinox, although there still were years when the New Year began before the equinox. 

&lt;blockquote&gt;In summary, the situation in Babylonia before the last third of the eighth century seems to agree with the statement in MUL.APIN (Hunger and Pingree 1989) that the vernal equinox fell on Nisan 15. Probably around 730 the aimed-for beginning of the Babylonian year was shifted some two weeks upwards in relation to the solar year, so the average New Year's Day fell shortly before the vernal equinox. This holds true for the entire seventh century. Only around 600 did a second shift occur, which pushed the average beginning of the year to about two weeks after the vernal equinox (figure 4B).&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Manuel "A Common Source for the Late Babylonian Chronicles Dealing with the Eighth and Seventh Centuries," ''Journal of the American Oriental Society'', Vol. 120:4, October–December 2000, p. 559&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10157">[[File:Lozenje badnjaka.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A lit ''badnjak'' (log)]]
'''Badnjak''' ({{IPA-hr|badɲaːk|hr}}), refers to a log brought into the house and placed on the fire on the evening of [[Christmas Eve]], a central tradition in Croatian Christmas celebration, much like a [[yule log]] in [[Christmas_worldwide#Europe|other European traditions]]. In Croatian the name for Christmas Eve is derived from the term ''badnjak.'' The log is cut with great ceremony on Christmas Eve morning, which for [[Roman Catholic]] Croats is December 24. The cutting, preparation, bringing in, and laying on the fire are surrounded by elaborate religious rituals, with many regional variations. The log is kept burning throughout [[Christmas|Christmas Day]].

With increased [[urbanization]] and migrations to cities, the badnjak tradition has recently been limited to more rural areas, as many urban homes do not have a hearth or fireplace, increasing the risk of a fire hazard, along with the fact that it is near impossible to cut one's own log in the city. Instead, some may chose to have a symbolic log kept in the home.

==Etymology==
The term ''badnjak'' comes from the old Slavic words ''bodar'' or ''badar'', which means "to be awake" (''bdjeti'').&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zupa-svkriz.hr/duhovnost/krozgodinu/hrvatski_bozic1.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107191732/http://www.zupa-svkriz.hr/duhovnost/krozgodinu/hrvatski_bozic1.htm |date=2010-01-07 }} Zupa Sv. Kriza: PRIČA O NAŠEM HRVATSKOM BOŽIĆU&lt;/ref&gt; This refers to staying awake throughout the night to tend to the badnjak and wait for the coming of the saviour [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] on Christmas Day. The term badnjak lends itself to the literal meaning of Christmas Eve, with '''Badnji Dan''' meaning Christmas Eve Day, and '''Badnja Večer''' meaning Christmas Eve night.

==Origins==

There are many interpretations for the meaning of the badnjak, but scholars agree that it is a remnant of [[Proto-Indo-European religion|pagan Indo-European]] times that has adapted to Christianity. Today, the festive kindling of the log commemorates the fire that—according to folk tradition—the [[shepherd]]s of [[Bethlehem]] built in the cave where Jesus Christ was [[Nativity of Jesus|born]], to warm the baby Jesus and his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] throughout the night. The badnjak may also be seen as a [[Christian symbolism|symbol]] of the cross upon which Christ was [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucified]], the warmth of its fire symbolizing the [[salvation]] which, in the [[Christianity|Christian belief]], the crucifixion made possible for mankind. As the log burned and turned into ashes, it symbolized Christ's resurrection and his triumph over sin. Scholars regard the tradition as inherited from the [[Slavic mythology|old Slavic religion]], where Christians began referring to the celebration of Christmas as the Feast of Lights.&lt;ref&gt;Stories Behind the Great Traditions of Christmas, by Ace Collins; p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; They interpret the badnjak as an incarnation of the spirit of vegetation, and as a divinity who dies by burning to be reborn, to whom sacrifices and prayers were offered for the fertility of fields, the health and happiness of the family, in which the rekindling of the hearth-fire symbolizes its importance and center of family life throughout many generations.&lt;ref&gt;Christmas in Ritual and Tradition, Christian and Pagan, by Clement A. Miles, p.252-253&lt;/ref&gt; In some parts, some people focus more on the cult of their dead, where they equate the burning fire to their departed family members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kbf-st.hr/Casopisi/CUS_2008_1.htm#DRVO_BADNJAK_U_KR%C5%A0%C4%86ANSKOJ_TRADICIJSKOJ_KULTURI_Marko_Dragi%C4%87,_Split Katolicki bogoslovni fakultet-Split, Marko Dragić: ''DRVO BADNJAK U KRŠĆANSKOJ TRADICIJSKOJ KULTURI''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==

Among Croats of the Roman Catholic faith, Christmas Eve begins on December 24. Early in the morning, traditionally before dawn, the father or another male of the household goes into the forest to chop a piece of log, usually from an [[oak tree]] if it could be found, but, if the region does not have any, than [[beech tree|beech]], [[olive tree|olive]], or [[maple tree|maple]] can be used. When the perfect tree is found, the father would invoke God by reciting the [[Lord's Prayer]] several times and making the [[Sign of the Cross]] and would then cut it. When the father arrives back home with the badnjak, he announces "May Jesus and Mary be praised! I wish you a good Christmas Eve" (''Faljen Isus i Marija! Dobro Vam došla Badnja Večer''), and the family replies "Today and always."&lt;ref&gt;''The Magnificat Advent Companion'' by James Monti&lt;/ref&gt; The greeting can differ slightly among different regions; in [[Slavonia]] for example, the father would say, May Jesus be praised! I wish you a good Christmas Eve and Adam and Eve [feast day] (''Faljen Isus! Čestita vam badnja večer i Adam i Eva''). In the Croatian Catholic calendar, December 24 is the [[festival|feast]] day of [[Adam and Eve]]. The log is placed on the porch and is not brought into the house until the evening. 
[[File:Bozicna psenica.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The ''pšenica'' (wheat grass), usually planted on St. Lucy's, are used for the Christmas candles.]]
When evening comes, the badnjak log is placed in the hearth. In [[Dalmatia]], as the badnjak is brought into the home, it is sprinkled with [[wine]] and [[grain]]. In the southern part, women would adorn the logs with leaves and flowers and wrap them around with red and gold ribbons.&lt;ref&gt;''Christmas customs and traditions, their history and significance'', Clement A. Miles, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dubrovnik]], the father sprinkles corn and wine on the badnjak while reciting prayers. In other regions, the badnjak is sprinkled with [[wheat]] and [[holy water]], while in [[Hercegovina]] the badnjak is completely bathed in holy water.&lt;ref&gt;''The World Encyclopedia of Christmas'', y G. Q. Bowler&lt;/ref&gt; As the log is lit, the father of the family recites the [[Apostle's Creed]]. In southern Dalmatia, two logs are often placed in the shape of a cross. After the log is lit, he says "Jesus be praised. Welcome Christmas Eve." Sometimes, more holy water is sprinkled on the badnjak after it is lit. Depending on the region, people may choose to sprinkle bits of wheat grain, or even add some of the evening meal to the badnjak. In [[Istria]], if wine or [[rakija]] is sprinkled on the badnjak, a family member toasts: "Drink to your health" (''Pij u tvoje zdravlje'') believing if they don't then ill fortune will come to them. The log is usually allowed to burn all night into Christmas Day, and family members often take turns all night ensuring the log does not go out.

[[File:Krostule i fritule Bozic 1209.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Kroštule]] and [[fritule]] are in some parts of Croatia popular food on Badnjak.]]
The Badnjak must last all evening and in many regions, it is burned again. In certain regions, it is re-lit in the New Year on the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of The Three Kings]] and sometimes it stays by the hearth until [[Lent]], where it serves as a special log upon which other logs are placed. In the villages, the ashes or charred fragments of the badnjak are scattered in the fields to assure a fruitful crop.

==Celebration==

Much like other European countries, Croatia has specific traditional celebrations that go along with the felling and lighting of the badnjak. The day is spent in preparation for Christmas, with the home being decorated and the feast for the next day being prepared, and all chores must be done before the ringing of the church bells and the lighting of the badnjak. The [[Christmas tree]], which first arrived in Croatia in the mid-19th century, is still relatively new and is usually decorated on Christmas Eve. Other more traditional Croatian decorations include children hanging greenery throughout the home, such as [[holly]] branches, [[Salvia|sage]], [[ivy]] and [[evergreen]] wreaths, which are seen as a symbol of the strength of life in the middle of winter. [[Nativity scene]]s are usually present in every Christian home, and are generally kept under the tree or in another prominent location. 

Another old tradition is sowing [[wheat]] seeds in a bowl of water (usually on [[St. Lucy]]'s day), which will grow until Christmas and is then used to decorate the table on Christmas. The wheat is trimmed and usually wrapped with a red, white, and blue ribbon of the [[Flag of Croatia|Croatian tricolour]]. Most Croats put candles or other objects such as apples in the middle of the wheat, with candles symbolizing the birth of Christ. A bundle of [[straw]] is brought into the house by the head of the family, who greets the home with a Christmas wish, and the straw is then spread under the table and throughout the house, symbolizing the birth of Christ in the manger. Families usually sit on the straw after dinner when gathered around the badnjak.  

Throughout the day, the woman of the house prepares the Christmas meal, which usually consists of many courses and desserts. Traditional foods include lamb, roasted pig, [[sarma (food)|sarma]] with sauerkraut and sausage, [[punjena paprika|stuffed peppers]], [[pita]], salad, and freshly baked bread. Some traditional Christmas desserts include [[fritule]], [[kroštule]], [[strudel]], [[orahnjača]], [[makovnjača]], [[Bishop's bread]], and [[gugelhupf]]. 

Since Christmas Eve is a fasting day, the family only has a small meal at dinnertime. For Badnjak supper, baklar ([[cod]] fish) from Dalmatia is eaten along with a salad or cabbage. A large supply of dried fruits, [[honey]], and nuts (mainly [[walnuts]] and [[almonds]]) are always kept at home and eaten throughout the Christmas season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1556">'''Barādarī''' or '''Birādrī''' ({{lang-ur|برادری}}) means ''Brotherhood'' originating from the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{lang|fa|برادر}} ''Baradar'' meaning "Brother". In [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] it is used to denote a number of social strata among [[South Asia]]n [[Muslim]]s (see [[Caste system among Muslims]]). According to author [[Anatol Lieven]], "the most important force in [Pakistani] society" are Baradari, usually far stronger than any competing religious, ethnic, or ideological cause. Parties and political alliances in Pakistan are based on Baradari, not ideology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/sep/29/why-they-get-pakistan-wrong/ why they get pakistan wrong]| [[Mohsin Hamid]]| NYRoB| 29 September 2011 &lt;/ref&gt; 

The political effects of ''baradari'' or ''bradree'' among Pakistanis in the United Kingdom were attacked during the [[Bradford West by-election, 2012]] which resulted in the gain of a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seat for the [[Respect Party]] and its candidate [[George Galloway]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/mar/27/george-galloway-bradford-west-byelection&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Danger UXD'''" is an episode of the [[BBC]] [[sitcom]], ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]''. It was the second episode of series 6 and first broadcast on 15 January 1989. In the episode, Del acquires a batch of faulty [[sex dolls]], which have inadvertently been filled with an explosive gas.

The episode title is a reference to the 1979 TV series ''[[Danger UXB]]'', where UXB stood for "[[unexploded ordnance|unexploded bomb]]"; "UXD" thus suggests "unexploded dolls." On 21 December 2006, a scene from this episode was voted number 4 in the [[UKTV Gold]] Top 40 Greatest Only Fools Moments. The scene in question was that when one of the blow up dolls blows up by itself, which lead Del Boy, Rodney, and Uncle Albert to leave the room in a panic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uktv.co.uk/index.cfm/uktv/Gold.stepbystep/aid/579394 |title=Top 10 Only Fools Moments |accessdate=21 December 2006 |date=21 December 2006 |work= |publisher=UK Gold |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121081308/http://uktv.co.uk/index.cfm/uktv/Gold.stepbystep/aid/579394 |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
While continuing to follow the [[yuppy]] lifestyle, [[Del Boy]] encourages [[Rodney Trotter|Rodney]] to join in the fun. Also, Del's latest items to flog are video recorders from Ronnie Nelson and fresh tomatoes from Jersey.

At the ''Nag's Head'', [[Denzil Tulser|Denzil]] tells Mike and the Trotters that he took his wife, Corrine out for the evening to celebrate their anniversary, despite picking up a faulty stock of 50 dolls from a shop in High Wycombe and having to take them back to the factory, intending to take them in Monday. However, there was a fire at the factory so Denzil cannot take them in, and has to hand in a form to show he returned the dolls. Del forges a signature from the factory and buys the dolls off Denzil.

Back at the flat, the Trotters discover that the dolls are uninflated [[sex doll]]s called Lusty Linda and Erotic Estelle. Del suggests that they take the dolls down to a man named Dirty Barry, who owns a [[sex shop]].

At a Chinese takeaway, Denzil watches ''[[London Plus]]'' and finds out that the dolls are filled with propane gas, which will explode if exposed to heat, and is suspected to have caused the destruction of the factory. Denzil zooms out of the takeaway after paying, but not claiming his meal.

That night, back at the flat, after Del find that the video recorder has recorded the wrong programme, Rodney informs Del that the machines are made only for use in mainland Europe and cannot be used in the United Kingdom. Del admits that he has already sold most of them! At that moment, the two sex dolls from behind the cocktail bar inflate. The Trotters proceed to deflate the dolls, but cannot due to their faulty valves. Rodney suggests they burst them but is told not to by Del. When Rodney gets dressed for a date with [[Cassandra Trotter|Cassandra]], Del gets an idea on how to get the dolls to Dirty Barry's.

Back at the Nag's Head, [[Trigger (Only Fools and Horses)|Trigger]] complains about the "fresh Jersey" tomatoes, and [[Boycie]] turns out to be the one who bought the faulty video recorders. Denzil comes bursting in and tells them about the dolls and how he has to get in touch with Del. Boycie and Mike cackle nastily on hearing that Del has fifty time bombs on his hands.

Outside Nelson Mandela House, Rodney and Del come out with the two dolls dressed in their late mother Joan's clothes. An old man mistakes them for real women and Del imitates a female voice. The Trotters throw the dolls in their van, and Rodney heads off to meet up with Cassandra, leaving Del and [[Uncle Albert|Albert]] to drive down to Dirty Barry's. Del and Albert arrive at Dirty Barry's place, only to find out that he has had his licence revoked by the council. With nowhere else to drop them off, Del and Albert head back to the van to think of another way to get rid of the dolls. Del thinks they should hold them until the market picks up again.

At a restaurant, Cassandra warns Rodney of the unexploded sex dolls that she has heard about on the news. Eventually, Del and Rodney quickly take the two inflated dolls and dump them in a derelict area. The dolls explode after the Trotter brothers have got clear. The Trotter brothers head back to their van, only to find out that another two dolls are inflating. Del and Rodney bail out of the van and run off into the night.

On 14 October 2004, '''Pádraig Nally''', an Irish farmer living in [[County Mayo]], [[Republic of Ireland]] shot dead an [[Irish Travellers|Irish Traveller]] named '''John "Frog" Ward''', with 80 criminal convictions over 30 years, who had been trespassing on his property. In November 2005 Nally was sentenced to six years' imprisonment for [[manslaughter]]. His conviction was quashed in October 2006 and, after a retrial in December 2006, he was found not guilty of manslaughter.

==First trial==
The Central Criminal Court decided to hear the Nally case in Castlebar, making it the first [[murder]] trial in Mayo for almost a century; the jury was chosen from a pool of more than 200 locals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0712/wardj.html | work=RTÉ News | title=Ward murder trial underway in Mayo | date=12 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Travellers' support groups criticised the bias because of the jury's composition, arguing that the murder trial should have been afforded a more independent and objective forum. A member of the Law Reform Commission concurred that there was strong case to have such trials take place in Dublin.&lt;ref name=ST20091126&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article547437.ece |work=The Sunday Times |date=24 July 2005 |title=Gun Law | location=London | accessdate=1 May 2010 |first=Ben |last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward was a 43-year-old traveller with approximately 80 convictions from 38 separate court appearances and had convictions for burglary, larceny and assault.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1206/nallyp.html | work=RTÉ News | title=Ward in evidence at Nally trial | date=6 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; John "Frog" Ward had twice been committed to hospital for psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name=ST20091126/&gt; In 1999, he threatened a barman with a [[Utility knife|Stanley knife]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2006/1214/ireland/supporters-speak-of-joy-at-nally-verdict-289431.html|title=Supporters speak of joy at Nally verdict|date=14 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ward attacked a car with a slash hook while a woman and two children were inside.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt; Ward had threatened [[Garda Síochána|Gardaí]] in an incident in May 2002&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt; and with a slash, in April 2002.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt; At the time of his death he was facing charges of attacking Gardaí with a slash hook.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081023/http://www.96fm.ie/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=67035&amp;pt=n|title=Corks 96fm|date=28 September 2007|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court heard that a post-mortem examination and toxicology tests on Mr Ward's body found traces of cannabis, opiates and tranquillisers. It was also emphasised that Mr Ward had been receiving hospital treatment and was on medication for a condition.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; The ''Prime Time Special'' (RTÉ flagship current affairs programme) brought forward new evidence showing that John Ward had a long criminal record dating back over 30 years and revealed that four bench warrants for John Ward's arrest were outstanding at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2006/11/29/story34312.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133519/http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2006/11/29/story34312.asp |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Ward, the chief witness for the prosecution was himself serving an eleven-month sentence at the time of the trial, for possessing a knife and for theft.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt;

Another son, John Ward Jr. served an eleven-month sentence handed down in March for a spate of motoring and theft and fraud offences. He pleaded guilty before that court in May to an assault charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/frog-wards-son-charged-with-stealing-1035366.html|title='Frog' Ward's son charged with stealing|author=Ann Healy|publisher=Independent.ie|date=13 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A medical report handed into court at the time stated that the victim had received three stab wounds in the attack.

During the first trial, the court heard that Nally had become increasingly agitated and worried that his property would be targeted by local thieves as a number of farms in the area had recently been burgled. His own home had been broken into in 2003 and a chainsaw stolen from one of his sheds in February 2004. Other items had disappeared from around his house and farm. This caused him to be unable to sleep properly. Following the break-in in February 2004 he had kept a gun in a garage and had started to keep registration numbers of strange cars travelling through the district.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/07/24/story6596.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310023104/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2005/07/24/story6596.asp |archivedate=10 March 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and neighbours noted Nally had become preoccupied with looking after his farm and terrified that the robbers would return.&lt;ref name=ST20091126/&gt;&lt;ref name=farmer&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.96fm.ie/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=67035&amp;pt=n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081023/http://www.96fm.ie/newsroom/indepth.asp?id=67035&amp;pt=n|archivedate=28 September 2007 |title=Farmer who shot traveller jailed for six years|publisher=Press Association|accessdate=11 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He told the jury he was at the end of his tether and, according to counsel, was "agitated and fearful, even paranoid" about his safety. "Did he suddenly, after 60 years, become a murderer?" asked Brendan Grehan, Nally's lawyer, describing his client as a law-abiding member of his community who acted in self-defence.&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article547437.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12&amp;page=2 | work=The Times | location=London | title=Gun Law | date=24 July 2005 | accessdate=1 May 2010 | first=Ben | last=Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nally alleged he had met John "Frog" Ward previously when Ward had called to his house two weeks before 14 October and had enquired if it would be a good day for fishing. Ward, said Nally, had no fishing tackle with him and this led him to be suspicious of Ward. He did not like the look of him.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt;

Under cross-examination, Tom Ward denied a suggestion that his father was a bare knuckle boxer, and he said he had no knowledge of a suggestion his father had threatened a Garda with a slashhook. Tom Ward said that on the evening of 13 October 2004 he had bought the car he and his father had travelled in to Pádraig Nally's house the following day. He said he had bought it from other travellers, but he declined to give the court any names. Pádraig Nally's barrister had earlier stated a car bearing a similar description had previously been seen in the vicinity of Cross a short distance from where a chainsaw was reported stolen.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"/&gt;

According to Marie Cassidy, the state pathologist, John Ward, a Galway traveller, was shot twice on 14 October 2004. The first shot injured John Ward in the hand and hip. The second shot was fired from above and John Ward was in a crouched position at the time. The person who shot him was standing over him and the shot was fired at close range.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt; Nally said in evidence he was afraid Ward would kill him, which was why he fired the second shot (to frighten him [Ward]).&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt;

The Defense argued provocation, as Nally could have reasonably assumed John Ward had been responsible for the theft of the chainsaw and perhaps the numerous other thefts since, as Mr. Nally recognised the vehicle outside his home on 14 October as that bearing the description of the one seen in the vicinity of his home the day his chainsaw was stolen (in 2003). The provocation was, seemingly, the fact that Nally's house had been burgled some time previously, that Ward had called to his house some weeks previously and had acted suspiciously and that Ward was on his premises on 14 October, without authorisation.&lt;ref name="archives.tcm.ie"/&gt;

Nally pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges. He was acquitted of murder, but convicted of manslaughter. The judge, Mr Justice Paul Carney, refused to allow the jury to consider a full defence argument of self-defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article650441.ece |work=The Sunday Times |date=26 November 2006 |author=Comment: Brenda Power |title=Licence to kill means licence to be killed | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentencing Nally to six years for the manslaughter conviction, Mr Justice Paul Carney said: "This is undoubtedly the most socially divisive case I have had to try. It is also the most difficult one in which I have had to impose sentence.".&lt;ref name=farmer/&gt; The judge said he would take into consideration Nally's unblemished past, his low risk of re-offending, his willingness to show remorse for his crime and the fact that the prosecution's case was based largely on testaments given by the farmer.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

==Appeal ==

Nally was refused leave to appeal by the [[Old Bailey|Central Criminal Court]] against his conviction and six-year jail sentence.

The case was then appealed to the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]]. Nally's lawyers had argued at his appeal that the trial judge had erred in law by not allowing the jury to consider a defence of full self-defence and by not allowing it to find Nally not guilty. He had directed that the jury had to find Nally guilty of murder or guilty of manslaughter, and ruled that an acquittal verdict based on the evidence would be perverse.

In October 2006, the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed Pádraig Nally's conviction for manslaughter and ordered a retrial. The Court said that the jury should not have been denied the opportunity to return a verdict of not guilty, even if such a verdict may have flown in the face of the evidence.

==Retrial==

Pádraig Nally's retrial took place in December 2006. Similar evidence was submitted to the court, including evidence of Ward's character and previous convictions and both Nally's and Ward's mental states on the day in question.

The jury of eight men and four women acquitted Nally of manslaughter and he walked free.

==Legacy==
In 2009, the government announced its plan to introduce a new law of self-defence in 2010 upon recommendation by the [[Law commission|Law Reform Commission]] which would [[Codification (law)|codify]] the existing common law position on the use of force in defence of property. The Criminal Law (Defence and the Dwelling) Act 2011 was enacted on 19 December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/2011/en/act/pub/0035/index.html|title=electronic Irish Statute Book (eISB)|first=electronic Irish Statute Book|last=(eISB)|website=www.irishstatutebook.ie|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although widely heralded as "allowing" homeowners to exercise reasonable force in defending their home,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2012/0113/1224310196472.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Paul | last=Cullen | title=Law lets householders use reasonable force | date=13 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0113/home.html |work=RTÉ News |title=Law allows 'reasonable force' defending home |date=13 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115020924/http://www.rte.ie/news/2012/0113/home.html |archivedate=15 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; the Act in fact did nothing to change the legal position as it existed at the time of Nally's trial, other than to place the previous common law jurisprudence on a statutory footing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanrights.ie/index.php/2010/07/20/the-criminal-law-defence-and-the-dwelling-bill-2010/|title=Castle Doctrine – Human Rights in Ireland|website=www.humanrights.ie|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10586">The '''decline of Christianity''' is a widespread phenomenon that has affected [[developed countries]] and denominations in the post-[[World War II]] era, and change into a [[post-Christian]] [[secular]] [[multicultural]] society. [[Infant baptism]] has declined in the United Kingdom and United States. Thousands of churches have had to close and [[mainline Protestant]] denominations in the [[United States]] lost many members of their congregations.

==Background==
Scholars have proposed that Church institutions decline in most industrialized societies, except in cases where religion serves some function in the society beyond merely regulating the relationship between individuals and God.&lt;ref name=haynes&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-88667-9|last=Haynes|first=Jeff|title=Religion in Global Politics|date=2014-10-13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWquBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catholicism==
Adherence to established forms of church-related worship is in rapid decline in Italy and Spain. Church authority on social, moral and ethical issues is not as strong as it has been in the past.&lt;ref name=haynes /&gt; In 2017, the ''PBS News Hour'' reported that [[Seville]]{{'}}s historic cloistered [[convents]] were suffering from Christianity's decline in [[Spain]].

==By country==

===Canada===
In [[Quebec]], 547 churches have been closed or converted for non-worship based uses. One church was converted into a theater that hosts Led Zeppelin cover bands, Zumba lessons and fetish parties, others have become university reading rooms, luxury condos, or fitness centers. In the 1950s 95% of Quebec's population went to mass—in the present day that number is closer to 5%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|issn=0362-4331|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|title=Where Churches Have Become Temples of Cheese, Fitness and Eroticism|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2018-07-30|date=2018-07-30|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/world/canada/quebec-churches.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;No less than 562 churches in Quebec are changing, or one in five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Falling from Grace - The Rise and Fall of the Quebec Catholic Church|work=Culture Witness|accessdate=2018-07-30|url=http://www.culturewitness.com/2017/07/falling-from-grace-rise-and-fall-of.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
An Irish priest has said that the church's authority was most likely undermined by the [[papal encyclical]] called ''[[Humanae Vitae]]'' that established the Church's opposition to [[contraception]]. Fr. Kevin Hegarty has reported that in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Killala|diocese of Killala]] there is only one priest under the age of 40. They haven't had a student for the priesthood since 2013 and have ordained only two priests over the last 17 years. He expects this decline to continue unless the Church alters its positions on [[Ordination of women and the Catholic Church|female ordination]], contraception and sexuality.&lt;ref name=glenties&gt;{{Cite web|last=Glenties|first=Conor Gallagher|title=Some church teachings have ‘as much validity as Danny Healy Rae’s views on climate change’|work=[[The Irish Times]]|accessdate=2018-07-30|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/some-church-teachings-have-as-much-validity-as-danny-healy-rae-s-views-on-climate-change-1.3577624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
{{main|Decline of Christianity in the United Kingdom}}
Attendance at Anglican churches had started to decline by the [[Edwardian era]]. Though missions to [[Conversion to Christianity|converts]] had increased relative to the [[Victorian age]], these efforts were not as successful as had been hoped. During the early 20th century, membership in mainstream churches and attendance at Sunday schools declined, though scholars note that compiling and explaining the significance of these figures is complex. However, in the years following [[Queen Victoria]]{{'}}s death, a pattern emerged that suggested long-term decline, though this wasn't realized until after the [[First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-52299-4|last=Green|first=S.

Britain has experienced a decline in [[infant baptism]]s during the post-[[World War II]] period. In 2014, [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] [[Rowan Williams]] said that the UK had become a "post-Christian country". That same year only 4.3% of the population participated in a [[Church of England]] Christmas service. [[Justin Welby]] has said "there comes a point where the roof really does fall in".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-351-39042-2|last= Peterson|first=Paul Silas|title=The Decline of Established Christianity in the Western World: Interpretations and Responses|date=2017-09-22|chapter=1.

In 2017, a report released by [[St Mary's University, Twickenham|St. Mary's University]] in [[Twickenham]], [[London]] that Christianity was declining in Europe. The report's author concluded that Christianity "as a norm" was gone for at least the foreseeable future. According to the report 91% of [[Czechs|people in the Czech Republic]] between the ages of 16 to 29 haven't declared a religious affiliation, while in the [[United Kingdom]] only 7% identify as [[Church of England|Anglican]] (compared to 6% who identify as [[Muslim]]). In at least one dozen out of the 29 European countries surveyed by the researchers, the majority of young adults reported that they were not religious.&lt;ref name=suntimes&gt;{{Cite web|title=Researcher finds a dramatic decline of Christianity in Europe|work=Chicago Sun-Times|accessdate=2018-07-30|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/religion/researcher-finds-a-dramatic-decline-of-christianity-in-europe/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=12|title=Europe's Young Adults and Religion|url=https://www.stmarys.ac.uk/research/centres/benedict-xvi/docs/2018-mar-europe-young-people-report-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Nationwide Catholic membership has increased between 2000 and 2017, but the number of Churches has declined by nearly 11%. The ELCA has lost about 30% of its congregation and closed down 12.5% of its churches. The United Methodist church has lost 16.7% of its congregation and 10.2% of its churches. The [[Presbyterian Church]] has had the sharpest decline in church membership—between 2000 and 2015 they lost over 40% of their congregation and 15.4% of their churches.&lt;ref name=star&gt;{{Cite web|title=As churches close in Minnesota, a way of life fades|work=Star Tribune|accessdate=2018-07-30|url=http://www.startribune.com/as-minnesota-churches-close-a-way-of-life-fades/486037461/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fewer infants are being baptized - nationwide, Catholic baptisms are down by nearly 34% and ELCA baptisms by over 40%.&lt;ref name=star /&gt; 

Moderate and liberal denominations in the United States have been closing down churches at a rate 3 or 4 times greater than the number of new churches being [[consecrated]]. The closing of churches can be a very difficult process for [[clergy]].&lt;ref name=cafferata&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11089-016-0751-z|issn=00312789|volume=66|issue=3|pages=311–333|last=Cafferata|first=Gail|title=Respect, Challenges, and Stress among Protestant Pastors Closing a Church: Structural and Identity Theory Perspectives|journal=Pastoral Psychology|accessdate=2018-07-31|date=June 2017|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=122727502&amp;site=ehost-live|via=[[EBSCOhost]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[The Christian Century]]'' a 1% rate of annual closures is quite low relative to other types of institutions. Dave Olson, who headed [[church planting]] efforts for the [[Evangelical Covenant Church]] in 2008, has said that of the approximately 3,700 churches that close each year, up to half are unsuccessful new churches.&lt;ref name=dart&gt;{{Cite journal|issn=00095281|volume=125|issue=9|pages=14–15|last=Dart|first=John|title=Church-closing rate only one percent|journal=Christian Century|accessdate=2018-07-31|date=2008-05-06|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=31951717&amp;site=ehost-live|via=[[EBSCOhost]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the 119 year old First Lutheran Church of Los Angeles closed down. In August 2007 Rogers Heights Christian Church, which had a peak membership of 600, closed in [[Tulsa]], [[Oklahoma]]. The Kinderhook Methodist Church, located near the [[Mississippi river]] in a rural part of [[Illinois]], was closed in 2008 after Easter Sunday. An [[Episcopal Church (United States)|episcopal]] church in [[Cincinnati]] was closed.&lt;ref name=dart /&gt;

In 2018, the ''[[Minneapolis Star Tribune]]'' reported that churches in [[Minnesota]] were being closed due to dwindling attendance. [[Mainline protestant]] churches have seen the sharpest declines in their congregations. The Catholic Church has closed 81 churches between 2000 and 2017; the [[Archdiocese]] closed 21 church in 2010 and has had to merge dozens more. In roughly the same timeframe, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]] in Minnesota has lost 200,000 members and closed 150 churches. The [[United Methodist Church]], which is Minnesota's second-largest Protestant denomination, has closed 65 of its churches.&lt;ref name=star /&gt;

Other denominations like [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Mormons]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] have had slight increases in membership between 2003 and 2018. The number of adults who don't report any religious affiliation has nearly doubled in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=News|first=A. B.

The '''Duke Islamic Studies Center''', also known as '''DISC''', is an inter-departmental, cross-cultural center at [[Duke University]] dedicated to the study of [[Islam]] and [[Muslims]]. DISC is one of the leading institutions in North America for Islamic studies, approaching Islam as a global religion with many distinctive historical and cultural expressions. Duke’s tradition of strong humanistic approaches to the study of Islam and Muslims scholarship is complimented by emerging strength in social science approaches to Islamic Studies.

Established in 2006 as a sequel to the Center for the Study of Muslim Networks, the Duke Islamic Studies Center (DISC) continues to foreground Muslim networks, especially educational networks, as essential instruments for advancing cross-cultural understanding.

==Faculty Leadership==
Duke Islamic Studies Center is led by Professor [[Omid Safi]], a prominent Islamic studies professor who received his bachelor of arts, master's and doctorate degrees from Duke. Prior to accepting this position, he was a professor of Islamic studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Safi has also been a frequent speaker on Islam in popular media, including in The New York Times, Al Jazeera, The Washington Post, BBC, NPR, NBC and international media. He also is active on social media and as a blogger, is a lead Islam writer for the Huffington Post, and his column “What Would Muhammad Do?” (http://omidsafi.religionnews.com) has been a regular Religion News Service feature.

Other prominent faculty leadership include Abdullah Antepli (Chief Representative for Muslim Affairs), and Jen'nan Read (Assistant Director of Special Initiatives).

==Projects and Initiatives==
In addition to putting on a full slate of programs and events each semester, the Duke Islamic Studies Center sponsors special initiatives that reflect emerging leadership priorities and faculty interests.

Our most recent and most ambitious initiative is the Transcultural Islam Project. This multi-year project was launched in July 2011 with funding support from the Carnegie Corporation. This initiative has two overarching goals: 1) to inform public discourse and policy by publicizing and promoting scholarly and research-based information about Islam and Muslims; 2) to support scholarship and scholarly collaborations to advance research about Islam and Muslims across the globe.

Both of these initiatives were funded by the Social Science Research Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9011">An '''equestrian seal''' is a type of [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] used in the European [[Middle Ages]], characterized by the depiction of the owner as 
an [[heavy cavalry|mounted warrior]] in full [[Armour#Early|armour]]. Originating in the [[high medieval period]] (late 11th to early 12th century),  the type was frequently used throughout the 13th to 14th centuries. 
Continued use into the 15th and 16th centuries was mostly limited to [[high nobility]], especially [[Royal family|royalty]], while lower nobility switched to the use of simple [[history of heraldry|heraldic]] seals.

==Early examples (before 1170)==
{{see|List of oldest heraldry}}
Early examples of equestrian seals are known from second half of the 11th century. 
The oldest example that may be addressed as an "equestrian seal" is that of [[William I of England]] (c. 1067).&lt;ref&gt;"the very first equestrian seal on record is that of William the Conqueror. The double-sided seal die adopted by the Conqueror after Hastings is a celebrated though not fully understood artefact. [...] The great novelty is the equestrian obverse, which depicts William as duke of Normandy [...]. It shows a man wearing a helmet or crown, mounted on a gallopping horse, and holding a shield and banner with three streamers. This image may seem banal, but it is not, for it was completely new in the 1060s. Indeed, I think William was the inventor of the equestrian princely seal." Jean-François Nieus, "Early Aristocratic Seals: An Anglo-Norman Success Story" in: Van Houts (ed.), ''Anglo-Norman Studies XXXVIII: Proceedings of the Battle Conference 2015'' (2016),  [https://books.google.ch/books?id=JiYbDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA101  p. 101]&lt;/ref&gt;
Among the oldest extant examples in Germany is the seal of [[Henry of Laach]] (c. 1090).
The horseman is characterized by the [[kite shield]] and a conical helmet, ofen bearing a banner.
This type is continued into the mid-12th century, and late examples of kite shields are found into the 1160s.

==High medieval seals (1170&amp;ndash;1300)==
The peak of usage comes with the development of the tradition of [[chivalry]] in the high medieval period, during c. the last quarter of the 12th century and throughout the 13th century.
Seals of the 1170s to 1190s show shield shapes transitional between the "kite" and the "[[heater shield|heater]]" type. Helmet shapes become less conical and more rounded.
The horseman is now shown as the prototypical "[[knight]]" with a [[heraldic shield]]. From about the 1230s, the horse is increasingly shown as wearing a heraldic [[caparison]], and the rider as wearing a [[great helm]].

Around the middle of the 13th century, there was a fashion to also represent ladies and ecclesiastics on horseback on their seal, not wearing armour, 
but, as in the cases of [[Joan, Countess of Flanders]] (c. 1240), [[Maria of Brabant, Duchess of Bavaria]] (c. 1250) and [[Adelaide of Burgundy, Duchess of Brabant]] (c. 1260) practicing [[falconry]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Late medieval seals (1300&amp;ndash;1550)==
After 1300, equestrian seals were almost exclusively used by the [[high nobility]], by bearers of the rank of [[duke]] or higher.
Representations in seals of the 14th century show the nobleman with full heraldic achievements, often carrying a [[heraldic flag]], or with a lance in full [[jousting armour]].

==Late forms (after 1550)==
[[File:P144 Great Seal of Charles I.jpg|[[Charles I of England]] (1627)|thumb|Great Seal of [[Charles I of England]] (1627)]]
Late forms were used well into the [[early modern period]] in France and Germany.
Depictions of monarchs in full armour, crested helmets,  with lances or heraldic flags etc. fell out of use with the end of the [[joust]] in the early 17th century.
[[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia used a ''Majestätssiegel'' which depicted him on horseback in 1772 (albeit no longer depicted as a fully armored knight but as a military commander).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gsta.spk-berlin.de/siegel_uAe_850.html?PAGE=artikel_detail&amp;artikel_id=103  Geheimes Staatsarchiv Preußischer Kulturbesitz  (gsta.spk-berlin.de)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse of the Great Seal of [[Charles I of England]] (1627) shows the monarch in full gallop, wearing a fanciful classicist armour, accompanied by a hunting dog.
The [[List of British monarchs|British monarchs]] from 1707 onward continued the convention of depicting the seated and crowned monarch on the obverse, and the monarch on horseback on the reverse. This is the case also for the queen regnants   ([[:File:P174 Great Seal of Queen Anne.jpg|Great Seal of Queen Anne]], [[Queen Victoria]], [[:File:Reverse of the Great Seal of the Realm 1953.jpg|Elizabeth II]]), who are depicted in [[sidesaddle]].

==Plot==
The film begins in 2006 with Satoru Fujinuma, an aspiring [[manga]] writer who has his manga once again rejected by his publisher, forcing him to continue working as a deliveryman to support himself. Satoru has the ability to "Rewind", in which he is sent back to a point in the near past to prevent a person around him from enduring a fatal accident. One day, Satoru's mother, Sachiko, stays with him for the weekend. While the two are outside, Sachiko senses a man about to abduct a girl and makes Satoru remember a tragedy that happened 19 years before. Sachiko passes this information to a friend of hers, but when she is alone in Satoru's apartment, she is murdered. Satoru unsuccessfully gives chase to the killer; before he is captured by the police, who accuse him of Sachiko's murder. Satoru's Rewind activates and, to his surprise, he is sent 18 years into the past, back to his elementary school life in [[Hokkaido]].

Trying to adjust to his "new" life, Satoru remembers that his Rewind comes around after the murder of Kayo Hinazuki, a classmate of his, by a child serial killer, whose identity is placed to that of Jun Shiratori, even though Satoru does not believe that. He befriends the quiet and friendless Kayo, learning that she lives with an abusive mother, Akemi, and stepfather. With his friends and Sachiko's help, Satoru manages to convince Kayo to attend a double birthday party, as the two children are revealed to have the same birthday. Despite these changes, Kayo is still murdered, and in frustration, Satoru is sent back to the present.

Still evading the police, Satoru seeks refuge in the house of Airi Katagiri, a high school student who works as a fellow part-time deliveryman. Satoru realizes that though Kayo's death still occurred, its details have changed somewhat. Believing that Satoru is wrongly blamed, Airi helps him track down Sachiko's killer. However, this only puts her in danger when her house is burned down in an arson attack, though she still attempts to help Satoru by escaping from hospital, unaware that the police are following her. Meanwhile, Satoru meets with Sachiko's friend whom she contacted earlier, Makoto Sawada, who confirms that Sachiko's killer and the child serial killer are the same person. He reunites with Airi afterward, but this only causes him to be captured by the police. Noticing one of his captors as the killer, Satoru's Rewind activates and he is once again sent to 19 years before.

To prevent Kayo from being alone, Satoru "kidnaps" her by taking her to live away from her mother. He and his friend Kenya Kobayashi first place her in an abandoned van, but when they learn that the van is the child killer's hideout, they move her to live in the Fujinuma residence. Satoru's teacher, Gaku Yashiro, contacts the child abuse prevention center, who take Kayo into custody after enough evidence of Akemi's abuse is revealed. Still convinced that he needs to prevent more murders from happening, Satoru watches over another quiet classmate, Misato Yanagihara, during an ice hockey competition, but she quickly leaves, while Satoru is given a ride home by Yashiro. Recounting the evidence, Satoru eventually realizes that Yashiro is the killer and has deliberately placed Misato as a decoy. To prevent Satoru from interfering again, Yashiro throws him down a river.

Satoru is sent back to 2006, this time to a timeline where both Sachiko and Kayo, who is now pregnant, are alive, where he is no longer estranged from his childhood friends, and where his manga is successfully published; at the same time, however, Airi does not recognize him, as he does not work as a deliveryman in the new timeline. The lawyer Kenya helps him track down Yashiro, who now works as a councilman. Having a face-to-face meeting, Yashiro tells Satoru his demented motive of killing: he kills to prevent the children from having a bleak future. Just when he is about to commit suicide, Satoru stops him, causing himself to get mortally wounded instead, while Yashiro is arrested.

Ten years later, Sachiko holds a decennial anniversary of Satoru's death, attended by Kayo, her daughter, Kenya, and the others, while Airi, now a photographer, finishes reading Satoru's manga, ''[[Erased (manga)|Boku Dake ga Inai Machi]]''.

The '''Field Game''' is one of two codes of football devised and played at [[Eton College]]. The other is the [[Eton Wall Game]]. The game is like [[association football|football]] in some ways – the ball is round, but one size smaller than a standard football, and may not be handled – but the [[Offside (association football)|off-side rules]] – known as 'sneaking' – are more in keeping with [[Rugby football|rugby]]. There is also a small scrum or "Bully" of either six or seven a side. Goals can be scored much as in soccer, although there is no goalkeeper. But a team gains more points for scoring a 'rouge'. To score a rouge a player must kick the ball so that it deflects off one of the opposing players, or achieve a charge-down, and then goes beyond the opposition's end of the pitch. The ball is then 'rougeable' and must be touched – although not necessarily to the ground – by an attacking player to complete the rouge for five points. Rouges are similar to [[try|tries]] in that the scoring team then attempts to convert them for two points.

It is the only game at Eton that virtually every boy plays, at least for his first three years in the school, and it occupies prime position in the games programme throughout the [[Eton_College#School_terms|Lent Half]].

{{-}}

== Positions ==

The positions in the field game are divided into two main groups: The "Bully" and the "Behinds". 

'''Bully'''

The "Bully" is most aptly compared to the forwards in the game of rugby and consists of, 3 "Corners", 2 "Sideposts", 1 "Post", 1 "Bup" and the "Fly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etoncollege.com/userfiles/files/FIELDGAMELAWS-2007-Booklet.pdf|title=Eton College Field Game Laws of 2007|publisher=Eton College|accessdate=24 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Behinds'''

The 'behinds' are a group of players made up of two 'Shorts' and a 'Long'. The job of the Shorts is to kick the ball over the Bully, and allow players of their own side to run onto the ball, and hopefully to either score a goal or rouge. The opposing Shorts are trying to do the same thing, and so a kicking war often develops between the two teams of Shorts. This can be advantageous  for a team with a fitter bully, as it gives them an opportunity to create an off-side "Sneaking", and then win a kick.
The Long essentially remains in the goal-mouth, and his job is to kick back any ball which goes over the Shorts, or to defend the goal. He is not like a goalkeeper in football, however, as he cannot use his hands to prevent a goal.

== Laws ==

=== Penalties===
When a foul occurs, there are two main ways of restarting the game. One way is a bully, with the non-offending team having "Heads". Alternatively, for more serious offences, a kick can be given, which is similar to a free-kick in football.

=== Scoring ===
There are two main ways of gaining points in the Field Game, either a 'rouge' or a Goal.

'''Goals'''

There is a goal at each end of the pitch. The goals are smaller than in soccer but no player is allowed to use their hands to touch the ball. If a player kicks the ball into the opponent's goal his team scores 3 points.

'''Rougeables'''

If the ball comes from a defender and goes behind the infinite line created by extending their goal line, it is rougeable. The ball is also rougeable when a defender kicks it so that it rebounds off an attacker over the goal line, in such a case where, in the opinion of the referee, the attacker makes no deliberate attempt to play the ball over the line. A "contact" rougeable may also be created by an attacker if he plays the ball over the infinite line from close range while in contact (other than via the arm below the elbow) with a defender.

When a ball is rougeable players from both teams race to reach it first.

If an attacker reaches it first their team scores a 'rouge', worth five points and also attempts a conversion (see below).

If a defender reaches it first the attacking team has a choice of 'point or bully': they can choose either to be awarded a single point or to form a bully (like a [[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]), close to the opponent's end of the pitch. If they drive the ball over the end of the pitch they score a 'bully rouge' (5 points) and as before can convert it.

'''Conversions'''

In a conversion the attackers move the ball down tramlines at the end of the pitch from the side towards the goal. The attacker has to keep the ball moving and avoid it leaving the tramlines. They try either to score a goal or to hit the ball off a defender to score a rouge.

The conversion in its current form was introduced by rule changes in 2002. It replaced the "ram", in which a column of four players from the attacking side lifted their feet to the sound of "left up right up left up right up, one two three..", then, to the shout of "ram", charged a defensive goalpost scrum  from a range of 2.5 yards with the aim of forcing the ball over the line between the posts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1385508/Field-Game-is-judged-too-rough-for-Etons-modern-young-gentlemen.html The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Feigned madness'''" is a phrase used in [[popular culture]] to describe the assumption of a [[mental disorder]] for the purposes of evasion, deceit or the diversion of suspicion. In some cases, feigned madness may be a strategy—in the case of [[court jesters]], an institutionalised one—by which a person acquires a privilege to violate [[taboos]] on speaking unpleasant, socially unacceptable, or dangerous truths.

== Modern examples ==

===To avoid responsibility===
* [[Vincent Gigante]], [[American Mafia]] [[Boss (crime)|don]], seen wandering the streets of [[Greenwich Village]], [[Manhattan]] in his bathrobe and slippers, mumbling incoherently to himself, in what he later admitted was an elaborate act.
* Allegedly, [[Shūmei Ōkawa]], [[Japanese nationalism|Japanese nationalist]], on trial for [[war crime]]s after [[World War II]].
* [[Garrett Brock Trapnell]], a professional thief and confidence man, frequently pretended to be afflicted with [[schizophrenia]] or [[dissociative identity disorder]] in order to be sent to mental institutions rather than prison for his crimes. This strategy eventually failed when he was brought to trial for [[aircraft hijacking]]. He was later the subject of a book by [[Eliot Asinof]], entitled ''The Fox Is Crazy Too''.

===To examine the system from the inside===
[[Investigative journalist]]s and psychologists have feigned madness to study [[psychiatric hospital]]s from within:
* American [[muckraker]] [[Nellie Bly]]; see ''[[Ten Days in a Mad-House]]'' (1887)
* The [[Rosenhan experiment]] in the 1970s also provides a comparison of life inside several mental hospitals.
* The Swedish artist Anna Odell created the project ''Okänd, kvinna 2009-349701'' to examine power structures in healthcare, the society's view of mental illness and the victimhood imposed on the patient.

== Historical examples ==
* [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who feigned stupidity, causing the Tarquins to underestimate him as a threat until the time when he was able to drive the Roman people to insurrection.
* [[Alhazen]], who was ordered by the sixth [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid Caliph]], [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]], to regulate the [[flooding of the Nile]]; he later perceived the insanity and futility of what he was attempting to do and, fearing for his life, feigned madness to avoid the [[Caliph]]'s wrath. The Caliph, believing him to be insane, placed him under house arrest rather than execute him for failure. Alhazen remained there until the Caliph's death, thereby escaping punishment for his failure to accomplish a task that had been impossible from the beginning.
* [[Ion Ferguson]], an Irish psychiatrist in the British Army in a World War II German [[prisoner-of-war camp]], successfully feigned madness to get himself repatriated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/opinion/9198337.Fascinating_life_of_doctor/ Anne Wynne-Jones, Fascinating life of doctor, Lancashire Telegraph, 16 August 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; He also assisted two other prisoners in doing the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haygood|first1=Tamara Miner|title=Malingering and Escape: Anglo-American Prisoners of War in World War II Europe|url=http://wlajournal.com/webcontent/malingering/malingering.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In fiction and mythology==
* [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Hamlet]], who feigns madness in order to speak freely and gain revenge—possibly based on a real person; see [[Hamlet (legend)]].
* [[Odysseus]] feigned madness by yoking a horse and an ox to his plow and sowing salt&lt;ref&gt;the story does not appear in [[Homer]], but was apparently mentioned in [[Sophocles]]' lost tragedy ''The Mad Ulysses'': [[James George Frazer]], ''ed.'', ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Apollodorus: The Library]]'', '''II''':[https://books.google.com/books?id=hDhgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=sowed%20salt 176 footnote 2]; [[Hyginus]], [http://www.theoi.com/Text/HyginusFabulae2.html#95 ''Fabulae'' '''95'''] mentions the mismatched animals but not the salt.&lt;/ref&gt; or plowing the beach. [[Palamedes (mythology)|Palamedes]] believed that he was faking and tested it by placing his son, [[Telemachus]] right in front of the plow. When Odysseus stopped immediately, his sanity was proven.
* '''"Feign madness but keep your balance"''' is one of the [[Thirty-Six Stratagems]]
* ''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (novel)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'', [[Randle McMurphy]] feigns insanity in order to serve out his criminal sentence in a mental hospital rather than a prison.
* In [[Henry IV (Pirandello)|Henry IV]], the main character feigns insanity.
* In [[Goodbyeee]], the last episode of BBC sitcom ''Blackadder'', Blackadder feigns madness to try to avoid being sent into battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goodbyeee|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/blackadder/episodes/four/four_goodbyee.shtml|publisher=BBC Comedy|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The protagonist of the film [[Shock Corridor]] is a journalist who fakes insanity in order to gain access to an institution.
*Another notable example is [[Primal Fear (film)|Primal Fear]] adapted from the [[William Diehl]] [[Primal Fear (novel)|novel of the same name]]. In the film, Martin Vail ([[Richard Gere]]) defends a timid, young altar boy named Aaron Stampler ([[Edward Norton]]) accused of murdering an Archbishop. Halfway through, Vail discovers Stampler has [[Dissociative Identity Disorder]], with one sociopathic personality called "Roy," who was responsible for killing the Archbishop. However, after Stampler is released due to plea of insanity, Vail discovers Stampler faked the disorder in order to avoid execution. The film was Edward Norton's debut, which earned him an Oscar nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]].
*[[Jose Manalo]] and [[Wally Bayola]]'s roles in [[Scaregivers]] feigned madness by eating [[peanut butter]] disguised as stool samples, which landed them in a mental facility.

The '''flag of [[Dominica]]''' was adopted on 3 November 1978, with some small changes having been made in 1981, 1988, and 1990. The original flag was designed by playwright Alwin Bully in early 1978 as the country prepared for independence.&lt;ref name=dominicanews&gt;{{cite news|first=|last= |title=Today is Flag Day in Dominica |url=http://dominicanewsonline.com/news/homepage/news/culture/today-is-flag-day-in-dominica/ |work=[[Dominica News Online]] |date=19 October 2011|accessdate=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and design==
The flag, adopted in 1978, features the national bird emblem, the [[Imperial amazon|sisserou parrot]], which also appears on the [[Coat of arms of Dominica|coat of arms]] granted on 21 July 1961. This parrot, endemic to Dominica, is an endangered species with a population of only 250–350 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22686411/0 "Amazona imperialis"], The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Retrieved 12 September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The green field represents the lush vegetation of the island. The cross represents the [[Trinity]] and [[Christianity]], with its three colours symbolising the natives, the fertile soil, and the pure water. The 10 green five-pointed stars stand for the country's 10 [[parish]]es: ([[Saint Andrew Parish, Dominica|St Andrew]], [[Saint David Parish, Dominica|St David]], [[Saint George Parish, Dominica|St George]], [[Saint John Parish, Dominica|St John]], [[Saint Joseph Parish, Dominica|St Joseph]], [[Saint Luke Parish, Dominica|St Luke]], [[Saint Mark Parish, Dominica|St Mark]], [[Saint Patrick Parish, Dominica|St Patrick]], [[Saint Paul Parish, Dominica|St Paul]], and [[Saint Peter Parish, Dominica|St Peter]]), while the red disc stands for justice.

The sisserou parrot is sometimes coloured either blue or purple (the parrot's actual colour). The use of [[purple]] makes the flag of Dominica one of only two flags of sovereign states (alongside the [[flag of Nicaragua]]) to contain the colour.

The flag of Dominica, along with other national symbols, was the focus of a government-sponsored "Emblems Week" in 2016. An initiative of the independence committee, Emblems Week is aimed at reflecting on the meaning of the national emblems, and promoting their use among members of the general public and particularly among the country's schools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.gov.dm/index.php/news/4075-dominica-observes-first-ever-emblems-week|title=Dominica Observes First Ever ‘Emblems Week’|first=GIS|last=Dominica|website=www.news.gov.dm|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''geoglyph''' is a large design or [[motif (visual arts)|motif]] (generally longer than 4 metres) produced on the ground and typically formed by [[clastic rock]]s or similarly durable elements of the landscape, such as stones, stone fragments, live trees,&lt;ref&gt;[[:ru:Надписи из деревьев]]&lt;/ref&gt; gravel, or earth.  A '''positive geoglyph''' is formed by the arrangement and alignment of materials on the ground in a manner akin to [[petroform]]s, while a '''negative geoglyph''' is formed by removing [[patina]]ted clasts to expose unpatinated ground in a manner akin to [[petroglyph]]s.

A variation of the geoglyph, in the form of three-dimensional postive geoglyph, formed by seeding vegetation in a predetermined shape that typically only becomes visible years after the initial planting or seeding, has been named a '''arborglyph'''.

Perhaps the most famous geoglyphs are the [[Nazca lines]] in [[Peru]]. The cultural significance of these geoglyphs for their creators remains unclear, despite many hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;New Technologies for Archaeology: Multidisciplinary Investigations in Palpa and Nasca, Peru, Natural science in archaeology, page 50, Markus Reindel, Günther A. Wagner, Springer Verlag, 2009. {{ISBN|978-3-540-87437-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "[[Works of the Old Men]]" in [[Arabia]], "stone-built structures that are far more numerous than (the) Nazca Lines, far more extensive in the area that they cover, and far older,"&lt;ref&gt;Professor David Kennedy, quoted by Owen Jarus, LiveScience Contributor.

Since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land in the [[Amazon rainforest]], Brazil, leading to claims about [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/world/americas/land-carvings-attest-to-amazons-lost-world.html?_r=1|title=Once Hidden by Forest, Carvings in Land Attest to Amazon's Lost World|author=Simon Romero|work=The New York Times|date=January 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://noticias.terra.com.br/ciencia/fotos/0,,OI114656-EI238,00-Sinais+na+Amazonia+indicam+sociedade+perdida.html Amazon Jungle geoglyphs in Portuguese]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Antiquity |year=2009 |volume=83 |issue=322 |pages=1084–1095 |title=Pre-Columbian geometric earthworks in the upper Purús: a complex society in western Amazonia  |author=Martti Pärssinen, Denise Schaan and Alceu Ranzi |doi= 10.1017/s0003598x00099373|url=http://antiquity.ac.uk/ant/083/ant0831084.htm |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ondemar Dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and Alceu Ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over [[Acre (state)|Acre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Junior |first=Gonçalo |date=October 2008 |title=Amazonia lost and found |url=http://revistapesquisa.fapesp.br/en/2009/10/20/amazonia-lost-and-found-2/ |journal=Pesquisa (ed.220)|location= |publisher=FAPESP |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122njp|title=Unnatural Histories – Amazon|publisher=''BBC Four''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas with geoglyphs include [[Megaliths in the Urals]], [[South Australia]] ([[Marree Man]], which is not ancient, but rather a modern work of art, with mysterious origins), [[Western Australia]] and parts of the [[Great Basin Desert]] in the southwestern United States. [[Hill figure]]s, [[turf maze]]s and the stone-lined [[labyrinth]]s of [[Scandinavia]], [[Iceland]], [[Sápmi (area)|Lappland]] and the former Soviet Union are types of geoglyphs.

More than 50 geoglyphs are found in Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=geoglyphkz&gt;{{cite web|title=Mysterious Ancient Geoglyphs Discovered In Kazakhstan Leave Archeologists Perplexed|url=http://www.iflscience.com/mysterious-ancient-geoglyphs-discovered-kazakhstan-leave-archaeologists-perplexed|website=IFLScience}}

In the UK are various equine and humanoid figures cut into chalk hillsides. Examples include [[Uffington White Horse]], [[Westbury White Horse]], [[Cherhill White Horse]], [[Cerne Abbas Giant]], and the [[Long Man of Wilmington]].

Not all geoglyphs are ancient. The [[Land Art]] movement created many new geoglyphs as well as other structures; perhaps the most famous example is ''[[Spiral Jetty]]'' by [[Robert Smithson]]. Many towns and cities in the [[Western United States]] use [[hillside letters]] (also known as "mountain monograms") on the hills above their locations. Contemporary Australian [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Andrew Rogers (sculptor)|Andrew Rogers]] has created geoglyphs around the world called "The Rhythms of Life". You Yangs National Park is the home of a geoglyph constructed by Rogers in recognition of the indigenous people of the area. It depicts [[Bunjil]], a mythical creature in the culture of the local [[Wautharong]] [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal people]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

Geoglyphic texts and images are common in Central and [[Inner Asia]] but there has been little systematic study of their origins and spread.

In 2008–2009 [[Alfie Dennen]] created [[Britglyph]], a [[locative art]] focused Geoglyph created by having participants across the United Kingdom leave rocks at highly specific locations and uploading media created at each location. When taken together and viewed on the main project website an image of a watch and chain inspired by [[John Harrison]]'s [[marine chronometer]] H5 was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://map.britglyph.com|title=Britglyph|accessdate=2009-03-17|last=Dennen|first=Alfie|authorlink=Alfie Dennen|date=2009-03-11|publisher=[[Moblog]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218031239/http://map.britglyph.com/|archivedate=2008-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People have used the [[Strava]] mobile app to create [[Strava art]], virtual geoglyphs.

The need for a clearly defined and consistent '''invasion biology terminology''' has been acknowledged by many sources. ''[[Invasive species]]'', or ''invasive [[Introduced species|exotics]]'', is a nomenclature term and categorization phrase used for flora and fauna, and for specific restoration-preservation processes in native [[habitat]]s. ''Invasion biology'' is the study of these organisms and the processes of species invasion. 

The terminology in this page contains definitions for invasion biology terms in common usage today, taken from accessible publications.  References for each definition are included.  Terminology relates primarily to invasion biology terms with some [[ecology]] terms included to clarify language and phrases on linked pages.

==Introduction==
Definitions of "invasive non-indigenous species have been inconsistent", which has led to confusion both in literature and in popular publications (Williams and Meffe 2005).  Also, many scientists and managers feel that there is no firm definition of non-indigenous species, native species, exotic species, "and so on, and ecologists do not use the terms consistently." (Shrader-Frechette 2001)  Another question asked is whether current language is likely to promote "effective and appropriate action" towards invasive species through cohesive language (Larson 2005).  Biologists today spend more time and effort on invasive species work because of the rapid spread, economic cost, and effects on ecological systems, so the importance of effective communication about invasive species is clear. (Larson 2005)

Controversy in invasion biology terms exists because of past usage and because of preferences for certain terms.  Even for biologists, defining a [[species]] as native may be far from being a straightforward matter of biological classification based on the location or the discipline a biologist is working in (Helmreich 2005).  Questions often arise as to what exactly makes a species native as opposed to non-native, because some non-native species have no known negative effects (Woods and Moriarty 2001).  Natural biological invasions, generally considered range expansions, and introductions involving human activities are important and could be considered a normal ecological process (Vermeij 2005).  Non-native and native species may be sometimes considered invasive, and these invasions often follow human-induced landscape changes, with subsequent damage to existing landscapes a value judgment (Foster and Sandberg 2004).  As a result, many important terms relevant to invasion biology, such as invasive, weed, or transient, include qualities that are "open to subjective interpretation" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Sometimes one species can have both beneficial and detrimental effects, such as the [[Mosquito fish]] (''Gambusia affinis''), which has been widely introduced because of its suppression of larval [[mosquito]]es, although it also has negative impacts on native species of insects, fish and amphibians (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).

The large number and current complexity of terms makes interpretation of some of the invasion biology literature challenging and intimidating.  Exotic, alien, transplanted, introduced, non-indigenous, and invasive are all words that have been used to describe plants and animals that have been moved beyond their native ranges by humans (Williams and Meffe 2005), along with other terms such as foreign, injurious, aquatic nuisance, pest, non-native, all with a particular implication.  Even the use of what seem to be simple, basic terms to articulate ecological concepts "can confuse ideological debates and undermine management efforts" (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Attempts to redefine commonly used terms in invasion biology have been difficult because many authors and biologists are particular to a favorite definition (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004).  Also, the status and identification of any species as an invader, a weed, or an exotic are "conditioned by cultural and political circumstances." (Robbins 2004)

==Terminology==
Where words in a sentence are also defined elsewhere in this article, they appear in italics.

:;Alien species (See [[Introduced species]]): Less commonly used in scientific literature but often included in ''population'' publications, public information displays, and educational literature. This term refers to ''species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread; similar terms include ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;[[Aquatic nuisance species]]: Less commonly used in most literature. 1. A ''nonindigenous species'' that threatens the diversity or abundance of native species or the [[ecological stability]] of infested waters, or commercial, agricultural, aquacultural or recreational activities dependent on such waters (EPA 1990). 2. Aquatic ''species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans (Heutte and Bella 2003). 3. An aquatic ''species'' with adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. ''species'' that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 

:;Biological control or biocontrol (See [[Biological pest control]]): 1. In general, the control of the numbers of one organism as a result of natural predation by another or others. Specifically, the human use of natural predators for the control of ''pests'' or ''weeds''. Also applied to the introduction of large numbers of sterilized males of the ''pest species'', whose matings result in the laying of infertile eggs (Allaby 1998). 2. The release of one ''species'' to control another (Carlton 2001). 3. The management of ''weeds'' using introduced herbivores (often insects) as biological control agents (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Biological invasion]] or [[bioinvasion]]: A broad term for both human-assisted introductions and natural range expansions (Carlton 2001).

:;Biological diversity (See [[biodiversity]]): Used to describe ''species'' richness, ecosystem complexity, and genetic variation (Allaby 1998). 

:;Biological control (See [[Biological pest control]]): Control method involving a biological control agent that is a natural enemy of a target ''pest'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;Bioregion (See [[Ecoregion]]): A biological subdivision of the earth’s surface delineated by the ''flora'' and ''fauna'' of the region (Allaby 1998).

:;[[Biota (ecology)|Biota]]: The organisms (plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, algae, etc.) of a specific region or period, or the total aggregation of organisms in the biosphere (Allaby 1998).
 
:;[[Casual species]]: This term is becoming less common in usage. A ''non native species'' that does not form self-replacing ''populations'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). Similar terms include ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''.

:;[[Chemical control]]: Control method that employs herbicides to control ''exotic'' plants (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;Community: Any grouping of ''populations'' of different organisms that live together in a particular environment (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Cryptogenic species]]: ''Species'' that are neither clearly ''native'' nor ''exotic'' (Cohen and Carlton 1988).

:;[[Cultivar]]: A variety of a plant produced and maintained by horticultural techniques and not normally found in wild ''populations'' (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Disturbance (ecology)|Disturbance]]: An event or change in the environment that alters the composition and successional status of a biological community and may deflect succession onto a new trajectory, such as a forest fire or hurricane, glaciation, agriculture, and urbanization (Art 1993). 

:;[[Ecosystem]]: A discrete unit, or community of organisms and their physical environment (living and non-living parts), that interact to form a stable system (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Endemism|Endemic]]: A ''species'' or taxonomic group that is restricted to a particular geographic region because of such factors as isolation or response to soil or climatic conditions; this ''species'' is said to be endemic to the region (Allaby 1998).

:;Exotic species (See [[Introduced species]]): This term is commonly used in publications and literature, and is similar to the terms ''alien species'', ''foreign species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). Other definitions include: 1. An ''introduced'', ''non native species'', or a ''species'' that is the result of direct or indirect, deliberate or accidental introduction of the ''species'' by humans, and for which introduction permitted the species to cross a natural barrier to dispersal (Noss and Cooperrider 1994). 2. In North America, often refers to those ''species'' not present in a ''bioregion'' before the entry of Europeans in the 16th century, or present in later parts of that region and later introduced to an ecosystem by human-mediated mechanisms (Cohen and Carlton 1988). 

:;[[Fauna]]: The animal life of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

:;Foreign species (See [[Introduced species]]): A species introduced to a new area or country. Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''introduced species'', ''non indigenous species'', and ''non native species''. 

:;[[Flora]]: Plant or bacterial life forms of a region or geological period (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Habitat]]: The place, including physical and biotic conditions, where a plant or an animal usually occurs (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Herbicide]]: ''Pesticide'' that specifically targets vegetation (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]]: Production of novel genotypes, through mating between distinct species or ecotypes. Novel genotypes may be more invasive than parental genotypes.

:;Indigenous (See [[Indigenous species]]): A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area; a synonym for ''native species'' (Allaby 1998).

:;[[Injurious species]]: An ''introduced species'' that causes economic or environmental harm to humans. Similar terms include ''aquatic nuisance species'', ''noxious weed'', and ''invasive species'' (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Intentional introduction]]: A ''species'' that is brought to a new area, country, or bioregion for a specific purpose, such as for a garden or lawn; a crop species; a landscaping ''species''; a ''species'' that provides food; a groundcover ''species''; for soil stabilization or hydrological control; for aesthetics or familiarity of the ''species''; or other purposeful reasons (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Introduced species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal species that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. This terms means those ''species'' that have been transported by human activities, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a region in which they did not occur in historical time and are now reproducing in the wild (Carlton 2001). Similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', ''foreign species'', ''non indigenous specie''s, and ''non native species''.

:;[[Ecological_facilitation#Invasibility|Invasibility]]: The ease with which a ''habitat'' is invaded (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;Invasion (See [[Introduced species]] and [[Invasive species]]): The expansion of a ''species'' into an area not previously occupied by it (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Invasive species]]: Generally, this term refers to a subset of plants or animals that are introduced to an area, survive, and reproduce, and expand beyond the original area of introduction. This is the biological definition. Practical definitions add that they cause harm economically or environmentally within the new area of introduction. 1. An ''alien species'' whose introduction does or is likely to cause economic or environmental harm or harm to human health (Executive Order 1999). 2. An adjective for ''non native'' or ''nonindigenous species'' that have colonized natural areas; 3. Discrimination of ''nonindigenous species'' established in cultivated ''habitats'' (as ‘noninvasive’) from those established in natural ''habitats''; 4. ''Nonindigenous species'' that are widespread; or 5. Widespread ''nonindigenous species'' that have adverse effects on the invaded ''habitat'' (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). Other definitions include the following: 5. ''Species'' that spread beyond their ''native range'', not necessarily harmful, or ''species'' introduced to a new range that establish themselves and spread (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 6. ''Species'' that displace ''native species'' and have the ability to dominate an ecosystem, or a species that enters an ecosystem beyond its natural range and causes economic or environmental harm (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;[[Integrated Pest Management]]: IPM focuses on long-term prevention or suppression of ''pests''. The integrated approach to ''weed'' management incorporates the best suited cultural, biological and chemical controls that have minimum impact on the environment and on people (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Manual control]]: Removal that involves the use of tools such as shovels, axes, rakes, grubbing hoes, and hand clippers to expose, cut, and remove flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, and/or roots from target plants (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Mechanical control]]: Removal that involves the use of motorized equipment such as mowers, “weed-whackers”, and tractor-mounted plows, disks, and sweepers. Burning is also categorized here (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Native range]]: The ecosystem that a ''species'' inhabits (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;Native species (See [[Indigenous (ecology)]]): 1. A synonym for ''indigenous species'' 2. A ''species'' that occurs naturally in an area, and has not been introduced by humans either intentionally or unintentionally (Allaby 2005). 3. In North America, a ''species'' established before the year 500 (Jeschke and Strayer 2005)

:;[[Native weed]] ([[invasive native]]): A ''species'' that is native to an area or ''bioregion'' that has increased in number dramatically. In cases of ''disturbance'' or change to a landscape, a ''ruderal species'' can increase in cover and compete with other native plants, threatening the diversity of a community. In other cases, landscape level changes can cause the increase of the ''population'' of a ''species'', such as white-tailed deer in the northeastern part of the United State, which are at the highest levels historically and cause damage to humans, crops, and structures, suffer high disease levels, and pose threats to humans through interactions on roads (Foster and Sandberg 2004).

:;Naturalized species (See [[Introduced species]]): 1. A ''species'' that was originally introduced from a different country, a different ''bioregion'', or a different geographical area, but now behaves like a native species in that it maintains itself without further human intervention and now grows and reproduces in native communities (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''non native species'' that forms self-sustaining ''populations'' but is not necessarily an ''invasive species'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Neobiota]]: An umbrella term for the entirety of all non-native species, independently of their taxonomic rank, naturalization status or time of introduction, without defining these by a negation (non-native) or by an evaluative approach (Kowarik 2002.  

:;[[Niche opportunity]]: Defines conditions that promote invasions in terms of resources, natural enemies, the physical environment, interactions between these factors, and the manner in which they vary in time and space (Shea and Chesson 2002).

:;[[Nonindigenous species]]: This is a common term used along with ''non native species'' and ''introduced species'' in current literature and publications; other similar terms include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. 1. Any ''species'' or other viable biological material that enters an ecosystem beyond its historic range, including any such organism transferred from one country into another (EPA 1990). 2. A plant or animal that is not native to the area in which it occurs which was either intentionally or unintentionally introduced (Williams and Meffe 2005). 

:;[[Non native species]]: This term, along with the terms ''introduced species'' and ''nonindigenous species'', is one of the most commonly used terms to describe a plant or animal ''species'' that is not originally from the area in which it occurs. Similar terms also include ''alien species'', ''exotic species'', and ''foreign species''. This term has also been defined as: 1. A ''species'' whose presence is due to ''intentional'' or ''unintentional introduction'' as a result of human activity (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. A ''species'' that has been introduced to an area or ''bioregion'' (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;[[Noxious weed]]: This term is frequently a legal term in state code, denoting a special status of the plant as, for example, ''prohibited'' or ''restricted''. 1. Native or non-native plants, or plant products, that injure or cause damage to interests of agriculture, irrigation, navigation, natural resources, public health, or the environment (Heutte and Bella 2003). 2. Implies a ''species''’ adverse effects on humans, either directly (e.g. ''species'' that produce toxins that are harmful to humans) or indirectly (e.g. species that infest nature reserves) (Colautti and MacIsaac 2004). 3. Any ''species'' of plants, either annual, biennial, or perennial; reproduced by seed, root, underground stem, or bulblet; which when established is or may become destructive and difficult to control by ordinary means of cultivation or other farm practices (Heutte and Bella 2003). 

:;Pathway (See Path): 1. Used to mean ''vector'', purpose (the reason why a ''species'' is moved), and route (the geographic corridor from one point to another) (Carlton 2001). 2. Mode by which a ''species'' establishes and continues to exist in a new environment (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Pest (organism)|Pest]]: 1. An animal that competes with humans by consuming or damaging food, fiber, or other materials intended for human consumption or use, such as an insect consuming a cropfield (Allaby 1998) 2. Synonymous to ''invasive species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;[[Pesticide]]: A chemical or biological agent intended to prevent, destroy, repel, or mitigate plant or animal life and any substance intended for use as a plant regulator, defoliant, or desiccant, including insecticides, fungicides, rodenticides, herbicides, nematocides, and biocides (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Population]]: A group of potentially inter-breeding individuals of the same ''species'' found in the same place at the same time (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Prohibited weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may not be brought into a state (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Restricted weed]]: A specific legal term applied to a plant or plant part that may only be brought into a state in limited quantities (Heutte and Bella 2003).

:;[[Ruderal species]]: A plant associated with human dwellings, construction, or agriculture, that usually colonizes disturbed or waste ground. Ruderals are often ''weeds'' which have high demands for nutrients and are intolerant of competition. See also ''native weed or invasive native'' (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Soil seed bank|Seed bank]]: Seeds that become incorporated into the soil (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Species]]: A group of organisms formally recognized as distinct from other groups; the taxon rank in the hierarchy of biological classification below genus; the basic unit of biological classification, defined by the reproductive isolation of the group from all other groups of organisms (Allaby 1998). 

:;[[Tens rule]]: 1. Describes how approximately ten percent of ''species'' pass through each transition from being imported to becoming ''casual'' to becoming established, and finally becoming a ''weed'' (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 2. Ten percent of the ''introduced species'' establish themselves in the non native continent and ten percent of these, in turn, spread or are ''pests'' although many exceptions to this rule have been noted (Jeschke and Strayer 2005).

:;Time lag: 1. Time between introduction, establishment, and spread of a ''species'' (Jeschke and Strayer 2005). 2. The time between when a ''species'' is introduced and when its ''population'' growth explodes (Booth ''et al.'' 2003).

:;[[Unintentional introduction]]: An introduction of ''nonindigenous species'' that occurs as the result of activities other than the purposeful or intentional introduction of the ''species'' involved, such as the transport of ''nonindigenous species'' in ballast or in water used to transport fish, mollusks or crustaceans for aquaculture or other purposes (EPA 1990). 

:;Vector (See [[Vector (epidemiology)]]): The physical means or agent by which a ''species'' is transported, such as ballast water, ships’ hulls, boats, hiking boats, cars, vehicles, packing material, or soil in nursery stock (Carlton 2001). See also ''pathway''. 

:;[[Weed]]: 1. A plant in the wrong place, being one that occurs opportunistically on land or in water that has been disturbed by human activities (see also ''ruderal species'' and ''native weed or invasive native''), or on cultivated land, where it competes for nutrients, water, sunlight, or other resources with cultivated plants such as food crops. Under different circumstances the weed plant itself may be cultivated for different purposes (Allaby 1998). 2. A ''native'' or ''introduced species'' that has a perceived negative ecological or economic effect on agricultural or natural ecosystems (Booth ''et al.'' 2003). 3. A plant growing in an area where it is not wanted (Royer and Dickinson 1999).

"'''God Save the Queen'''" (alternatively "'''God Save the King'''", depending on the gender of the reigning monarch) is the [[national anthem|national]] or [[Honors music|royal anthem]] in a number of [[Commonwealth realm]]s, their territories, and the British [[Crown dependencies]].&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx| title=National Anthem| website=The official website of The British Monarchy| accessdate=21 August 2014| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140902162152/http://www.royal.gov.uk/MonarchUK/Symbols/NationalAnthem.aspx | archivedate=2 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isle of Man| publisher=nationalanthems.info| url=http://www.nationalanthems.info/im.htm| accessdate=17 August 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100927040310/http://nationalanthems.info/im.htm | archivedate=27 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the tune is unknown, and it may originate in [[Plainsong|plainchant]]; but an attribution to the composer [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] is sometimes made.

"God Save the Queen" is the national anthem of the [[United Kingdom]] and one of two national anthems used by [[New Zealand]] since 1977, as well as for several of the UK's territories that have their own additional local anthem. It is also the royal anthem – played specifically in the presence of the monarch – of all the aforementioned countries, as well as [[Australia]] (since 1984), [[Canada]] (since 1980),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=MacLeod| first=Kevin S.| authorlink=Kevin S.

In countries not previously part of the [[British Empire]], the tune of "God Save the Queen" has provided the basis for various patriotic songs, though still generally connected with royal ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://nationalanthems.me/united-kingdom-god-save-the-queen/|  title=United Kingdom - God Save the Queen|  publisher=NationalAnthems.me|  accessdate=23 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The melody continues to be used for the national anthem of [[Liechtenstein]], "[[Oben am jungen Rhein]]", and the royal anthem of [[Norway]], "[[Kongesangen]]". In the [[United States]], the melody is used for the patriotic song "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]".

Beyond its first verse, which is consistent, "God Save the Queen/King" has many historic and extant versions. Since its first publication, different verses have been added and taken away and, even today, different publications include various selections of verses in various orders.&lt;ref&gt;cf. the versions in the hymn books ''English Hymnal'', ''Hymns Ancient and Modern'', and ''Songs of Praise''&lt;/ref&gt; In general, only one verse is sung. Sometimes two verses are sung, and on rare occasions, three.&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"/&gt;

The [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] and her or his spouse are saluted with the entire composition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Thatcher funeral: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip arrive | work=YouTube | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxBn2HbkdBk | accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other members of the Royal Family who are entitled to royal salute (such as the [[Prince of Wales]], [[Duke of Cambridge]] and [[Duke of Sussex]] along with their spouses) receive just the first six bars. The first six bars also form all or part of the [[Honors music|Vice Regal Salute]] in some Commonwealth realms outside the UK (e.g., in Canada, governors general and lieutenant governors at official events are saluted with the first six bars of "God Save the Queen" followed by the first four and last four bars of "[[O Canada]]"), as well as the salute given to governors of British overseas territories.

==History==
In ''[[The Oxford Companion to Music]]'', [[Percy Scholes]] points out the similarities to an early [[plainsong]] melody, although the rhythm is very distinctly that of a [[galliard]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Scholes| first=Percy A| title=[[The Oxford Companion to Music]], Tenth Edition| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]| isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he gives examples of several such dance tunes that bear a striking resemblance to "God Save the King/Queen". Scholes quotes a keyboard piece by [[John Bull (composer)|John Bull]] (1619) which has some similarities to the modern tune, depending on the placing of [[accidental (music)|accidentals]] which at that time were unwritten in certain cases and left to the discretion of the player (see ''[[musica ficta]]''). He also points to several pieces by [[Henry Purcell]], one of which includes the opening notes of the modern tune, setting the words "God Save the King". Nineteenth-century scholars and commentators mention the widespread belief that an old Scots carol, "Remember O Thou Man" was the source of the tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Sousa| first = John Philip| title=National, Patriotic, and Typical Airs of All Lands| year=1890| quote=[Remember O Thou Man] is the air on the ground of which ''God Save the King'' Is sometimes claimed for Scotland. It is in two strains of 8 bars each and has the rhythm and melody of the modern tune in the first and third bars of the second strain. But it is in minor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pinkerton| first=John|  title = The Literary Correspondence of John Pinkerton, Esq.| year=1830| quote=''Remember O thou man'' is unquestionably the root of ''God save the King''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published version of what is almost the present tune appeared in 1744 in ''Thesaurus Musicus''. The 1744 version of the song was popularised in Scotland and England the following year, with the landing of [[Charles Edward Stuart]] and was published in ''The Gentleman's Magazine'' (see illustration above). This manuscript has the tune depart from that which is used today at several points, one as early as the first bar, but is otherwise clearly a strong relative of the contemporary anthem. It was recorded as being sung in London theatres in 1745, with, for example, [[Thomas Arne]] writing a setting of the tune for the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane Theatre]].

Scholes' analysis includes mention of "untenable" and "doubtful" claims, as well as "an American misattribution". Some of these are:
* The French [[Marquise de Créquy]] wrote in her ''Souvenirs'' that the melody of "God save the King" (originally "Grand Dieu, sauvez le Roi!") were composed by [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/crequy/chap104.html| title=Souvenirs de la Marquise de Créquy, chap. 4| publisher=Penelope.uchicago.edu| accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in gratitude for the survival by [[Louis XIV]] of an [[anal fistula]] operation.

* [[James Oswald (composer)|James Oswald]] was a possible author of the ''Thesaurus Musicus'', so may have played a part in the history of the song, but is not a strong enough candidate to be cited as the composer of the tune.
* [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]]: Scholes refutes this attribution: first on the grounds that Carey himself never made such a claim; second, when the claim was made by Carey's son (in 1795), it was in support of a request for a pension from the British Government; and third, the younger Carey claimed that his father, who died in 1743, had written parts of the song in 1745. It has also been claimed that the work was first publicly performed by Carey during a dinner in 1740 in honour of Admiral [[Edward Vernon|Edward "Grog" Vernon]], who had captured the Spanish harbour of [[Porto Bello, Panama|Porto Bello]] (then in [[Gran Colombia]], now in [[Panamá]]) during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]].

Scholes recommends the attribution "traditional" or "traditional; earliest known version by John Bull (1562–1628)". The ''[[English Hymnal]]'' (musical editor [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]) gives no attribution, stating merely "17th or 18th cent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dearmer|first=Percy|author2=Vaughan Williams, Ralph|title= The English Hymnal with Tunes|publisher=Oxford University Press| year=1906| page=724|isbn=}}Hymn No. 560 "National Anthem"&lt;/ref&gt;

"God Save the Queen" is the [[national anthem]] of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Like many aspects of British constitutional life, its official status derives from custom and use, not from Royal [[Proclamation]] or [[Act of Parliament]]. In general, only one or two verses are sung, but on rare occasions, three.&lt;ref name = "royal.gov.uk"/&gt;  The variation in the UK of the lyrics to "God Save the Queen" is the oldest amongst those currently used, and forms the basis on which all other versions used throughout the Commonwealth are formed; though, again, the words have varied throughout these years.

England has no official national anthem of its own; "God Save the Queen" is treated as the English national anthem when England is represented at sporting events (though there are some exceptions to this rule, such as cricket where "[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]" is used). There is a movement to establish an English national anthem, with [[William Blake|Blake]] and [[Hubert Parry|Parry]]'s "Jerusalem" and [[Edward Elgar|Elgar's]] "[[Land of Hope and Glory]]" among the top contenders. Scotland has its own national song and Wales has its own national anthem for political and national events and for use at international [[Association football|football]], [[rugby union]] and other sports in which those nations compete independently.&lt;ref name = "olympic usage"/&gt; On all occasions Wales' national anthem is "[[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau]]" (Land of my Fathers). Scotland has no single anthem; "[[Scotland the Brave]]" was traditionally used until the 1990s, when "[[Flower of Scotland]]" was adopted. In Northern Ireland, "God Save the Queen" is still used as the official anthem.

The phrase "No surrender" is occasionally sung in the bridge before "Send her victorious" by England football fans at matches.&lt;ref name="BackCrabbe2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Les Back|author2=Tim Crabbe|author3=John Solomos|title=The Changing Face of Football: Racism, Identity and Multiculture in the English Game|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk-BAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=30 March 2013|date=1 November 2001|publisher=Berg Publishers|isbn=978-1-85973-478-0|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "no surrender" is also associated with [[Combat 18]], a white supremacist group.&lt;ref name=IndObit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/29/english-football-racist-fa-looks-other-way|author=Marina Hyde|title=Race issues (News), FA (Football Association), England football team, Rio Ferdinand, John Terry, Football, Sport, UK news|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=29 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase is also associated with [[Ulster loyalism]] and can sometimes be heard at the same point before Northern Ireland football matches.

Since 2003, "God Save the Queen", considered an all inclusive Anthem for Great Britain and Northern Ireland, as well as other countries within the Commonwealth, has been dropped from the [[Commonwealth Games]]. [[Northern Ireland|Northern Irish]] athletes receive their gold medals to the tune of the "[[Londonderry Air]]", popularly known as "[[Danny Boy]]".

In sports in which the UK competes as one nation, most notably as [[Great Britain at the Olympics]], "God Save the Queen" is used to represent anyone or any team that comes from the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="olympic usage"&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=2 February 2008 |url=http://www.learnenglish.org.uk/stories/poem_act/anthems.html |title=National anthems &amp; national songs |publisher=[[British Council]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120124413/http://www.learnenglish.org.uk/stories/poem_act/anthems.html |archivedate=20 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lyrics in the UK===
[[File:Town Hall Stratford.jpg|thumb|The Town Hall, [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], Warwickshire (built 1767), bearing the painted slogan, "God Save the King".]]
The phrase "God Save the King" is much older than the song, appearing, for instance, several times in the [[King James version of the Bible|King James Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;1 Samuel x. 24; 2 Samuel xvi. 16 and 2 Kings xi. 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zadok the Priest|A text]] based on the [[Books of Kings|1st Book of Kings]] Chapter 1: verses 38–40, "...And all the people rejoic'd, and said: God save the King! Long live the King! May the King live for ever, Amen", has been sung at every [[Coronation of the British Monarch|coronation]] since that of [[Edgar of England|King Edgar]] in 973.&lt;ref name = "WestminsterAbbey1"&gt;{{citation|title=Guide to the Coronation Service |url=http://www.westminster-abbey.org/our-history/royals/coronations/guide-to-the-coronation-service|accessdate=20 August 2009|work=Westminster Abbey website|year=2009|publisher=Dean and Chapter of Westminster|location=London, U.K.|quote=Meanwhile the choir sings the anthem Zadok the Priest, the words of which (from the first Book of Kings) have been sung at every coronation since King Edgar’s in 973. Since the coronation of George II in 1727 the setting by Handel has always been used.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholes says that as early as 1545 "God Save the King" was a [[watchword]] of the [[Royal Navy]], with the response being "Long to reign over us".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wood |first=William |title=Flag and Fleet: How the British Navy Won the Freedom of the Seas |url=http://www.sakoman.net/pg/html/19849.htm |year=1919 |publisher=Macmillan }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Watchword in the Night shall be, 'God save King Henrye!' The other shall answer, 'Long to raign over Us!'&lt;/ref&gt; He also notes that the prayer read in churches on anniversaries of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] includes words which might have formed part of the basis for the second verse "Scatter our enemies...assuage their malice and confound their devices".

In 1745, ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' published "God save our lord the king: A new song set for two voices", describing it "As sung at both Playhouses" (the Theatres Royal at [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane|Drury Lane]] and [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Gentleman's Magazine'' Vol. 15, October 1745, p.552&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the first performance was thought to have been in 1745, when it was sung in support of [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]], after his defeat at the [[Battle of Prestonpans]] by the army of [[Charles Edward Stuart]], son of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] claimant to the British throne.

It is sometimes claimed that, ironically, the song was originally sung in support of the Jacobite cause: the word "send" in the line "Send him victorious" could imply that the king was absent. However, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' cites examples of "[God] send (a person) safe, victorious, etc." meaning "God grant that he may be safe, etc.". There are also examples of early eighteenth century Jacobean drinking glasses which are inscribed with a version of the words and were apparently intended for drinking the health of [[James II of England|King James II and VII]].

Scholes acknowledges these possibilities but argues that the same words were probably being used by both Jacobite and Hanoverian supporters and directed at their respective kings.&lt;ref name = "mwtppa"&gt;Scholes p.412&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, the musician [[William Hayman Cummings]], quoting mid-18th century correspondence between [[Charles Burney]] and Sir Joseph Banks, proposed that the words were based on a Latin verse composed for King James II at the [[Chapel Royal]].{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;O Deus optime
Salvum nunc facito
Regem nostrum
Sic laeta victoria
Comes et gloria
Salvum iam facito
Tu dominum.&lt;ref&gt;God Save the King, William H. Cummings, Novello and Company Ltd, London 1902&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}}

:&lt;small&gt;When the monarch of the time is male, "Queen" is replaced with "King" and all feminine pronouns ('''in bold type''') are replaced with their masculine equivalents.
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;

There is no definitive version of the lyrics. However, the version consisting of the three verses reproduced in the box on the right hand side has the best claim to be regarded as the "standard" British version, appearing not only in the 1745 ''Gentleman's Magazine'', but also in publications such as ''The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century'' (1851),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Mackay| first=Charles| title=The Book of English Songs: From the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century|year= 1851| page=203|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''National Hymns: How They Are Written and How They Are Not Written'' (1861),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=White| first=Richard Grant|title=National Hymns: How They are Written and how They are Not Written| publisher=Rudd &amp; Carleton| year=1861| page=42|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Household Book of Poetry'' (1882),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dana|first=Charles Anderson|title=Household Book of Poetry|year=1882| page=384|url=https://archive.org/details/householdbookpo00danagoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version'' (1982).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Hymns Ancient and Modern, Revised Version| publisher=SCM-Canterbury Press Ltd|year=1982| page=504|isbn=0-907547-06-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same version with verse two omitted appears in publications including ''[[Scouting for Boys]]'' (1908),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Baden-Powell|first=Robert|title=Scouting for Boys| year=1908| page=341|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the British Monarchy website.&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"/&gt; At the Queen's [[Golden Jubilee]] Party at the Palace concert, [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] referred in his speech to the "politically incorrect second verse" of the National Anthem.

According to Alan Michie's ''Rule, Britannia'', which was published in 1952, after the death of [[George VI|King George VI]] but before the coronation of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], when the first [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] was held in London in January 1946 the King, in honour of the occasion, "ordered the belligerent imperious second stanza of 'God Save the King' to be rewritten to bring it more into the spirit of the brotherhood of nations."

In the UK, the first verse is the only verse typically sung, even at official occasions, although the third verse is sung in addition on rare occasions such as during the opening ceremonies of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], and usually at the [[Last Night of the Proms]]. At the [[2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony|Closing Ceremony of the 2008 Beijing Olympics]], the fourth verse of the [[William Edward Hickson|William Hickson]] alternative lyrics was sung instead of the third verse.

====Standard version of the music====
[[File:God Save The Queen 2007 St Giles Fair.ogg|thumb|right|alt=Church choir sing at fair. A merry-go-round fills most of the background.|"God Save the Queen" sung by the public at [[St Giles' Fair]], [[Oxford]], 2007]]
The standard version of the melody and its key of G major are still those of the originally published version, although the start of the anthem is often signalled by an introductory timpani roll of two bars length. The bass line of the standard version differs little from the second voice part shown in the original, and there is a standard version in four-part harmony for choirs. The first three lines (six bars of music) are soft, ending with a short ''crescendo'' into "Send her victorious", and then is another ''crescendo'' at "over us:" into the final words "God save the Queen".

In the early part of the 20th century there existed a Military Band version in the higher key of B{{music|flat}},&lt;ref&gt;Official versions published by [[Kneller Hall|Kneller Hall Royal Military School of Music]]&lt;/ref&gt; because it was easier for brass instruments to play in that key, though it had the disadvantage of being more difficult to sing: however now most Bands play it in the correct key of G.

Since 1953, the anthem is sometimes preceded by a fanfare composed by [[Gordon Jacob]] for the [[coronation of Queen Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Richards|title=Imperialism And Music: Britain 1876-1953|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=2002|page=120|isbn=0719045061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alternative British versions====
There have been several attempts to improve the song by rewriting the words. In the nineteenth century there was some lively debate about the national anthem and, even then, verse two was considered to be slightly offensive. Notably, the question arose over the phrase "scatter her enemies." Some thought it placed better emphasis on the respective power of Parliament and the Crown to change "her" to "our"; others pointed out that the theology was somewhat dubious and substituted "thine" instead. Sydney G. R. Coles wrote a completely new version, as did Canon F. K. Harford.&lt;ref&gt;Richards p.91&lt;/ref&gt; In 1836, [[William Edward Hickson]] wrote four alternative verses. The first, third, and fourth of these verses are appended to the National Anthem in the [[English Hymnal]] (which only includes verses one and three of the original lyrics).

=====William Hickson's alternative version=====
William Hickson's alternative (1836) version includes the following verses, of which the first, third, and fourth have some currency as they are appended to the National Anthem in the English Hymnal. The fourth verse was sung after the traditional first verse at the Queen's Golden Jubilee National Service of Thanksgiving in 2002 and during the raising of the [[Union Flag]] during the closing ceremonies of the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].

====Historic Jacobite and anti-Jacobite alternative verses====
Around 1745, anti-[[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] sentiment was captured in a verse appended to the song, with a prayer for the success of [[Field Marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[George Wade]]'s army then assembling at [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]. These words attained some short-term use, although they did not appear in the published version in the October 1745 ''Gentleman's Magazine''. This verse was first documented as an occasional addition to the original anthem by [[Richard Clark (musician)|Richard Clark]] in 1822,&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=Richard|title=An Account of the National Anthem Entitled God Save the King!|year=1822|location=London|pages=8–9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Py5DAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also mentioned in a later article on the song, published by the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' in October 1836. Therein, it is presented as an "additional verse... though being of temporary application only... stored in the memory of an old friend... who was born in the very year 1745, and was thus the associate of those who heard it first sung", the lyrics given being:

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Lord, grant that Marshal Wade,
May by thy mighty aid,
Victory bring.
May he sedition hush,
and like a torrent rush,
Rebellious Scots to crush,
God save the King.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The 1836 article and other sources make it clear that this verse was not used soon after 1745, and certainly before the song became accepted as the British national anthem in the 1780s and 1790s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Richards|first=Jeffrey|title=Imperialism and Music: Britain 1876 to 1953| publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]| year=2002 | page=90|isbn=0-7190-4506-1}} "A fourth verse was briefly in vogue at the time of the rebellion, but was rapidly abandoned thereafter: God grant that Marshal Wade...etc"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The history of God Save the King": The Gentleman's Magazine, Vol 6 (new series), 1836, p.373.  "There is an additional verse... though being of temporary application only, it was but short-lived...[but]...it was stored in the memory of an old friend of my own... 'Oh! grant that Marshal Wade... etc.'&lt;/ref&gt; It was included as an integral part of the song in the ''Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse'' of 1926, although erroneously referencing the "fourth verse" to the ''Gentleman's Magazine'' article of 1745.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=3835950|title=The Oxford Book of Eighteenth-Century Verse| publisher=Questia.com| accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the opposing side, Jacobite beliefs were demonstrated in an alternative verse used during the same period:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Groom|first=Nick|title=The Union Jack: the Story of the British Flag| publisher=Atlantic Books|year=2006 | pages=Appendix|isbn=1-84354-336-2|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freed from vile [[Presbyterianism|Presbyt'ry]],
Both [[George II of Great Britain|George]] and his [[Frederick, Prince of Wales|Feckie]],
Ever so, Amen.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

In May 1800, following an attempt to assassinate [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]] at London's Drury Lane theatre, playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan|Richard Sheridan]] immediately composed an additional verse, which was sung from the stage the same night:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/search_object_details.aspx?objectid=1467537&amp;partid=1|title=The horrid assassin Is Hatfield, attempting to shoot the king in Drury Lane Theatre- on the 15th of May, 1800|publisher=British Museum| accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Ford|first=Franklin L.|title=Political Murder: From Tyrannicide to Terrorism| publisher=Harvard University Press| year=1985| page=207|isbn=0-674-68636-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;From every latent foe
From the assassin's blow
God save the King
O'er him Thine arm extend
For Britain's sake defend
Our father, king, and friend
God save the King!&lt;/poem&gt;}}

Various other attempts were made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to add verses to commemorate particular royal or national events. For example, according to Fitzroy Maclean, when Jacobite forces bypassed Wade's force and reached [[Derby]], but then retreated and when their garrison at [[Carlisle Castle]] surrendered to a second government army led by King George's son, the [[William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland|Duke of Cumberland]], another verse was added.&lt;ref name="fn_1"&gt;{{cite book| last=Maclean|first=Fitzroy|title=Bonnie Prince Charlie|publisher=Canongate Books Ltd.|year=1989 | isbn=0-86241-568-3}} Note that the verse he quotes appears to have a line missing.&lt;/ref&gt; Other short-lived verses were notably anti-French, such as the following, quoted in the book ''Handel'' by Edward J. Dent:&lt;ref&gt;See:[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/9089 etext 9089 at Project Gutenberg] and [http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/Handel2/#p35 p35 at FullTextArchive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Great Britain defend her,
Foes let them fall;
From foreign slavery,
Priests and their knavery,
And Popish Reverie,

However, none of these additional verses survived into the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Richards p.90.&lt;/ref&gt; Updated "full" versions including additional verses have been published more recently, including the standard three verses, [[Hickson's]] fourth verse, [[Sheridan's]] verse and the [[Marshal Wade]] verse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=God Save the Queen - lyrics|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/1571287/God-Save-the-Queen-lyrics.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 August 2012|location=London|date=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Should Welsh Olympics 2012 stars sing God Save the Queen anthem?|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/need-to-read/2012/07/27/should-welsh-olympics-2012-stars-sing-god-save-the-queen-91466-31487133/|publisher=Wales Online|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance in the UK===
The style most commonly heard in official performances was proposed as the "proper interpretation" by King [[George V]], who considered himself something of an expert (in view of the number of times he had heard it). An Army Order was duly issued in 1933, which laid down regulations for tempo, dynamics and orchestration. This included instructions such as that the opening "six bars will be played quietly by the reed band with horns and basses in a single phrase. Cornets and side-drum are to be added at the little scale-passage leading into the second half of the tune, and the full brass enters for the last eight bars". The official tempo for the opening section is a metronome setting of 60, with the second part played in a broader manner, at a metronome setting of 52.&lt;ref name="fn_2"&gt;Percy A Scholes: ''Oxford Companion to Music, Tenth Edition'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years the prescribed sombre-paced introduction is often played at a faster and livelier [[tempo]].

Until the latter part of the 20th century, theatre and concert goers were expected to stand while the anthem was played after the conclusion of a show. In cinemas this brought a tendency for audiences to rush out while the end credits played to avoid this formality.  (This can be seen in the 1972 ''[[Dad's Army]]'' episode "[[A Soldier's Farewell]]".)

The anthem continues to be played at some traditional events such as [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], [[Royal Variety Performance]], the [[Edinburgh Tattoo]], [[Royal Ascot]], [[Henley Royal Regatta]] and [[The Proms]] as well as at Royal events.

The anthem was traditionally played at closedown on the [[BBC]], and with the introduction of commercial television to the UK this practice was adopted by some [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]] companies (with the notable exception of [[Granada Television|Granada]]). [[BBC Two]] never played the anthem at closedown, and ITV dropped the practice in the late 1980s, but it continued on [[BBC One]] until the final closedown on 8 November 1997 (thereafter BBC One began to [[simulcast]] with [[BBC News]] after end of programmes). &lt;!--The national anthem may be brought back for the [[digital television in the United Kingdom|analogue shutoff in 2012]].--&gt; The tradition is carried on, however, by [[BBC Radio 4]], which plays the anthem each night as a transition piece between the end of the Radio 4 broadcasting and the move to [[BBC World Service]].&lt;ref name="Guardian on Radio 4"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/mar/17/radio-4-national-anthem |title=Radio 4 keeps flying the flag|  publisher=The Guardian|  date=17 March 2010|  accessdate=9 March 2013|  location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio 4 and [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] also play the National Anthem just before the 0700 and 0800 news bulletins on the actual and [[Queen's Official Birthday|official]] birthdays of the Queen and the birthdays of senior members of the [[Royal Family]].

The UK's national anthem usually prefaces [[Royal Christmas Message|The Queen's Christmas Message]] (although in 2007 it appeared at the end, taken from a recording of the 1957 television broadcast), and important royal announcements, such as of royal deaths, when it is played in a slower, sombre arrangement.

NOTE ON GRAMMAR:
Standard British English usage is to refer to sports teams in the plural form, unlike in American English (as in "Manchester United are sitting at the top of the Premier League" not "Manchester United is..."). The same applies to national teams: "England are playing well".

==Use in other Commonwealth countries==
"God Save the King/Queen" was exported around the world via the expansion of the [[British Empire]], serving as each country's national anthem. Throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations#History|Empire's evolution]] into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], the song declined in use in most states which became independent. In New Zealand, it remains one of the official national anthems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/currentexhibitions/makingourmark/index.php?page=anthem&amp;image=25 |title=Letter from Buckingham Palace to the Governor-General of New Zealand |accessdate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004152/http://www.archives.govt.nz/exhibitions/currentexhibitions/makingourmark/index.php?page=anthem&amp;image=25 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }} – Royal assent that the two songs should have equal status&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===

In Australia, the song has standing through a Royal Proclamation issued by Governor-General [[Ninian Stephen|Sir Ninian Stephen]] on 19 April 1984.&lt;ref&gt;''Commonwealth of Australia Gazette''; No. S 142; 19 April 1984&lt;/ref&gt; It declared "God Save the Queen" to be the Royal Anthem and that it is to be played when the Australian monarch or a member of the Royal Family is present, though not exclusively in such circumstances. The same proclamation made "[[Advance Australia Fair]]" the national anthem and the basis for the "Vice-Regal Salute" (the first four and last two bars of the anthem). Prior to 1984, "God Save the Queen" was the national anthem of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Anthem|url=http://dfat.gov.au/about-australia/land-its-people/Pages/australias-national-symbols.aspx|publisher=Australian Government Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975 former Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]], dismissed by [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Sir John Kerr]], alluded to the anthem in his comment "Well may we say 'God save the Queen', because nothing will save the Governor-General!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kelly |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Kelly (journalist) |year=1995 |title=November 1975: the inside story of Australia's greatest political crisis |publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin St |location=St Leonards, NSW |isbn=978-1-86373-987-0 |page=275 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"God Save the Queen" has been sung in Canada since the late 1700s and by the mid 20th century was, along with "O Canada", one of the country's two ''de facto'' national anthems, the first and last verses of the standard British version being used.&lt;ref name=QHE&gt;{{Cite book| last=Bélanger| first=Claude| contribution=The Quebec History Encyclopedia| title=National Anthem of Canada| editor-last=Marianopolis College| place=Montreal| publisher=Marianopolis College| url=http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Anthem.htm| accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By-laws and practices governing the use of either song during public events in municipalities varied; in Toronto, "God Save the Queen" was employed, while in [[Montreal]] it was "O Canada". Prime Minister [[Lester B. Pearson]] in 1964 said one song would have to be chosen as the country's national anthem and, three years later, he advised [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Georges Vanier]] to appoint the Special Joint Committee of the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] and [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] on the National and Royal Anthems. Within two months, on 12 April 1967, the committee presented its conclusion that "God Save the Queen", whose music and lyrics were found to be in the [[public domain]],&lt;ref name=DCHOCanada&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/anthem-eng.cfm| last=Department of Canadian Heritage| authorlink=Department of Canadian Heritage| title=National Anthem: O Canada &gt; Parliamentary Action| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; should be designated as the Royal Anthem of Canada and "O Canada" as the national anthem, one verse from each, in [[Official bilingualism in Canada|both official languages]], to be adopted by parliament. The group was then charged with establishing official lyrics for each song; for "God Save the Queen", the English words were those inherited from the United Kingdom and the French words were taken from those that had been adopted in 1952 for the [[coronation of Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref name=CE /&gt; When the bill pronouncing "O Canada" as the national anthem was put through parliament, the joint committee's earlier recommendations regarding "God Save the Queen" were not included.&lt;ref name=DCHOCanada /&gt;

The [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence]] and the [[Canadian Forces]] regulates that "God Save the Queen" be played as a salute to [[Monarchy of Canada|the monarch]] and other members of the [[Monarchy of Canada#Canadian Royal Family|Canadian Royal Family]],&lt;ref name=DND&gt;{{Citation|last=Department of National Defence |author-link=Department of National Defence (Canada) |title=The Honours, Flags and Heritage Structure of the Canadian Forces |page=503 |place=Ottawa |publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada |date=1 April 1999 |url=http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf |id=A-AD-200-000/AG-000 |accessdate=30 October 2009 |ref=CITEREF_Department_of_National_Defence_1999 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325162006/http://www.saskd.ca/heritage.pdf |archivedate=25 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; though it may also be used as a hymn, or prayer. The words are not to be sung when the song is played as a military royal salute and is abbreviated to the first three lines while arms are being presented.&lt;ref name=DND /&gt; [[Elizabeth II]] stipulated that the arrangement in G major by Lieutenant Colonel Basil H. Brown be used in Canada. The authorised version to be played by [[pipe band]]s is ''Mallorca''.&lt;ref name=DND /&gt;

"God Save the Queen" was the sole official national anthem until 1977 when "[[God Defend New Zealand]]" was added as a second.

When [[Rhodesia]] issued its [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] from the UK on 11 November 1965, it did so while still maintaining loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as the Rhodesian head of state, despite the non-recognition of the Rhodesian government by the United Kingdom and the United Nations;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A matter of weeks rather than months: The Impasse between Harold Wilson and Ian Smith: Sanctions, Aborted Settlements and War 1965–1969| last=Wood| first=J.

"God Save the Queen" was a co-national anthem of [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]] from 1938 until 1957,&lt;ref name=DieStem&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1938/06/03/archives/south-africa-will-play-two-anthems-hereafter.html|title=South Africa Will Play Two Anthems Hereafter|date=3 June 1938|publisher=|via=|work=The New York Times|location=New York|access-date=31 October 2018|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; when it was formally replaced by "[[Die Stem van Suid-Afrika]]" as the sole national anthem.&lt;ref name=DieStem/&gt; The latter served as a sort of ''de facto'' co-national anthem alongside the former until 1938.&lt;ref name=DieStem/&gt; As South Africa was a [[Commonwealth realm]] at the time, "God Save the Queen" continued to remain the [[royal anthem]] of the country until it became a fully independent state in 1961.

==Use elsewhere==
"God Save the King" was one of the first songs to successfully be used as a national anthem; only the Dutch ''[[Het Wilhelmus]]'' (~1568) is older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bale|first1=Tim|title=European Politics: A Comparative Introduction|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137105868|pages=330|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hwdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=wilhelmus+16th+century+popular&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=wilhelmus%2016th%20century%20popular&amp;f=false|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The Spanish ''[[La Marcha Real]]'' is older as well, but took longer to become popular. Japan's anthem ''[[Kimigayo]]'' has lyrics which are older still, but a more recent melody). Its success prompted a number of other countries to pen similar anthems to help construct a concrete national identity - many of which used the same tune:

* The Imperial anthem of [[German Empire|Germany]], ''[[Heil dir im Siegerkranz]]'' (originally the royal anthem of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] since 1795), used the melody of "God Save the King". In addition, several [[States of the German Empire|German states]] used the tune, including [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] (''Heil unserm König, Heil! - Hail to our King, Hail!''), [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] (''Gott segne Sachsenland - God bless Saxony'') and Liechtenstein, which did not join the German Empire (see below). During the reign of [[Otto of Greece]], the Bavarian royal anthem also served as the Greek anthem.
* The state anthem of the [[Kingdom of Hanover]], ''[[Heil dir, Hannover]]'', used the melody of "God Save the King". Hanover was in [[personal union]] with the Kingdom of Great Britain and subsequently the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1837.
* The national anthem of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] from 1816 to 1833 was ''[[Molitva russkikh]]'' ("The Prayer of Russians"), which used the melody of "God Save the King" and lyrics by [[Vasily Zhukovsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hymn.ru/index-en.html "Russian Anthems museum"]  {{webarchive|url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20101002054755/http://www.hymn.ru//index-en.html |date=2 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Switzerland (''[[Rufst Du, mein Vaterland]]'' or ''Ô monts indépendants'', until 1961).
* "God Save the King" was used as the national anthem of the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] before 1860
* [[E Ola Ke Alii Ke Akua]], from 1860 to 1886 the national anthem of Hawaii, was set to the same melody.
* The Hawaiian anthem [[Hawaiʻi Ponoʻī]] composed by the Prussian [[Kapellmeister]] [[Henri Berger]] is a variation of the melody.&lt;ref&gt;''The melody was based on the Prussian hymn originally titled "Heil Dir Im Siegerkranz".'' {{cite web | title=Hawaiʻi ponoʻī | url=http://www.huapala.org/Hawaii/Hawaii_Ponoi.html | accessdate=2018-06-02 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117070257/http://www.huapala.org/Hawaii/Hawaii_Ponoi.html | archivedate=2018-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The royal and national anthem of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Kingdom of Siam]] ''"[[Thai National Anthem|Chomrat Chongcharoen]]"''  used the melody of "God Save the King" from 1852 to 1871 in the reign of [[Rama IV]] and [[Rama V]] before adoption of "[[Sansoen Phra Barami]]" in 1888
* The American patriotic [[hymn]] "[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]", the lyrics of which were written by [[Samuel Francis Smith]] in 1831. The song is often quoted – alongside "[[Hail, Columbia]]" – as a ''de facto'' national anthem for the United States, before the ''de jure'' adoption of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" in 1931.
* Norway's [[royal anthem]] ''[[Kongesangen]]'' uses the melody.
* The Swedish royal anthem ''[[Bevare Gud vår kung]]'' between 1805 and 1880, used the melody.
* [[Liechtenstein]]'s anthem ''[[Oben am jungen Rhein]]'' uses the same melody. In consequence, the tune was played twice before a [[2004 European Football Championship|Euro 2004]] qualifying match between [[England national football team|England]] and [[Liechtenstein national football team|Liechtenstein]]; and again before the [[Euro 96]] qualifier between [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]] and Liechtenstein. (When England plays Northern Ireland, the tune is only played once).
* Iceland's de facto national anthem in the 19th century was ''[[Íslands minni]]'' ("To Iceland", better known as ''Eldgamla Ísafold''), a poem by [[Bjarni Thorarensen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Daisy (ed.)| title=A history of Icelandic literature| publisher=University of Nebraska Press, Lincoln| year=2006| pages=262, 518}}&lt;/ref&gt; set to the melody of "God Save the King". This lasted until the [[Lofsöngur|current national anthem]] was adopted, first by popular consent and later by law. The tune remains a popular one in Iceland and many different texts—serious, satirical and comical—have been set to it.
* [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] adopted the melody as its national anthem during the autocratic rule of [[Otto of Greece|Otto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://anemi.lib.uoc.gr/php/pdf_pager.php?rec=/metadata/a/f/b/metadata-01-0002588.tkl&amp;do=279838_10.pdf&amp;pageno=264&amp;pagestart=1&amp;width=662&amp;height=963&amp;maxpage=1104&amp;lang=en |title=Ελλάς (Σημαίαι-Εμβλήματα-Εθιμοτυπία) |year=1934 |website=www.anemi.lib.uoc.gr |publisher=Pyrsos Publishing |location=Athens |page=244 |language=Greek |trans-title=Greece (Flags-Emblems-Etiquette) |access-date=2018-08-31 |quote=Since the arrival of [[Otto of Greece|Otto]] to Greece, the [[Heil dir im Siegerkranz|German national anthem]] was formalised in Greece, which is an imitation of the British one.

It was replaced by the [[Hymn to Liberty]] in 1864, following Otto's overthrow.

The melody is also used as a [[hymn tune]] by Christian churches in various countries, including by the [[United Methodist Church]] and other denominations. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20110816030738/http://www.hymntime.com/tch/htm/g/g/o/ggodhigh.htm Glory to God on High]" is frequently sung to the tune, as is "[http://blog.daum.net/yhdvr/8905694 Since I Have My Retreat"] in the [[Christianity in Korea|Protestant Church of Korea]], and the Dutch hymn "Eeuwig en machtig Heer".

''[[The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show]]'' uses a parody version of the tune for the anthem of the "Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen".

==Musical adaptations==
===Composers===
About 140 composers have used the tune in their compositions, including Beethoven, Haydn, Brahms,&lt;ref name="royal.gov.uk"/&gt; Clementi, J. C. Bach, Liszt, Britten, Carl Maria von Weber, Niccolò Paganini, Johann Strauss I, and Edward Elgar.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]] composed a set of seven piano variations in the key of C major to the theme of "God Save the King", catalogued as [[WoO]].78 (1802–1803). He also quotes it in his orchestral work ''[[Wellington's Victory]]''.

[[Muzio Clementi]] used the theme to "God Save the King" in his ''[[Symphony]] No. 3 in G major'', often called the "Great National Symphony", catalogued as [[WoO]]. 34. Clementi paid a high tribute to his adopted homeland (the United Kingdom) where he grew up and stayed most of his lifetime. He based the Symphony (about 1816–1824) on "God Save the King", which is hinted at earlier in the work, not least in the second movement, and announced by the trombones in the finale.
• Symphony No. 3 "Great National Symphony " in en sol majeur/G-dur/G major/sol maggiore
1. Andante sostenuto – Allegro con brio
2. Andante un poco mosso
3. Minuetto. Allegretto
4. Finale. Vivace

[[Johann Christian Bach]] composed a set of variations on "God Save the King" for the finale to his sixth keyboard concerto (Op. 1) written c. 1763.

[[Joseph Haydn]] was impressed by the use of "God Save the King" as a national anthem during his visit to London in 1794, and on his return to Austria composed "[[Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser]]" ("God Save Emperor Francis") for the birthday of the last [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and [[King of the Romans|Roman-German King]], [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis II]]. It became the anthem of the [[Austrian Empire]] after the end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] with revised lyrics, its tune ultimately being used for the [[German national anthem]]. The tune of "God Save the King" was adopted for the Prussian royal anthem "[[Heil Dir im Siegerkranz]]".

[[Franz Liszt]] wrote a piano paraphrase on the anthem (S.259 in the official catalogue, c. 1841).

[[Johann Strauss I]] quoted "God Save the Queen" in full at the end of his [[waltz]] ''Huldigung der Königin Victoria von Grossbritannien'' (Homage to Queen Victoria of Great Britain) Op. 103, where he also quoted ''[[Rule, Britannia!]]'' in full at the beginning of the piece.

[[Siegfried August Mahlmann]] in the early 19th century wrote alternate lyrics to adapt the hymn for the [[Kingdom of Saxony]], as "Gott segne Sachsenland" ("God Bless Saxony").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Granville Bantock| title=Sixty Patriotic Songs of All Nations| publisher=Ditson| year=1913| page=xv| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMgQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joachim Raff]] used this anthem in his Jubelouverture, Opus 103 (1864) dedicated to Adolf, Herzog von Nassau, on the 25th anniversary of his reign.

[[Gioachino Rossini]] used this anthem in the last scene of his "[[Il viaggio a Reims]]", when all the characters, coming from many different European countries, sing a song which recalls their own homeland. Lord Sidney, bass, sings "Della real pianta" on the notes of "God Save the King". [[Samuel Ramey]] used to interpolate a spectacular virtuoso [[cadenza]] at the end of the song.

[[Fernando Sor]] used the anthem in his 12 Studies, Op. 6: No. 10 in C Major in the section marked 'Maestoso.'

[[Arthur Sullivan]] quotes the anthem at the end of his ballet ''[[Victoria and Merrie England]]''.

[[Claude Debussy]] opens with a brief introduction of "God Save the King" in one of his [[Preludes (Debussy)|Preludes]], ''[[Hommage à S. Pickwick Esq. P.P.M.P.C.]]''. The piece draws its inspiration from the main character of the [[Charles Dickens]] novel ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]''.

[[Niccolò Paganini]] wrote a set of highly virtuosic variations on "God Save the King" as his Opus 9.

[[Max Reger]] wrote ''Variations and Fugue on 'Heil dir im Siegerkranz' (God Save the King)'' for organ in 1901 after the death of [[Queen Victoria]]. It does not have an opus number.

A week before the Coronation Ode was due to be premiered at the June 1902 "Coronation Gala Concert" at [[Covent Garden]] (it was cancelled, owing to the King's illness), [[Sir Edward Elgar]] introduced an arrangement of "Land of Hope and Glory" as a solo song performed by Clara Butt at a "Coronation Concert" at the Albert Hall. Novello seized upon the prevailing patriotism and requested that Elgar arrange the National Anthem as an appropriate opening for a concert performed in front of the Court and numerous British and foreign dignitaries. This version for orchestra and chorus, which is enlivened by use of ''a cappella'' and marcato effects, was also performed at the opening of the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on St. George’s Day, 1924, and recorded under the composer's Baton in 1928, with the LSO and the Philharmonic Choir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elgar.org/3transcr.htm| title=His Music : Orchestral Arrangements and Transcriptions| publisher=Elgar| accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elgar also used the first verse of the Anthem as the climax of a short "Civic Procession and Anthem", written to accompany the mayoral procession at the opening of the Hereford Music Festival on 4 September 1927. This premiere performance was recorded, and is today available on CD; the score was lost following the festival, and Elgar resorted to reconstructing it by ear from the recording.&lt;ref&gt;Jerrold Northrop Moore, ''Edward Elgar, a Creative Life'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Maria von Weber]] uses the "God Save the King" theme at the end of his "Jubel Overture".

This version has been programmed several times at the [[Last Night of the Proms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boosey.com/cr/music/Benjamin-Britten-The-National-Anthem/55970&amp;langid=1| title=Benjamin Britten - The National Anthem| publisher=Boosey.com| date=2013-08-21| accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Ives]] wrote ''[[Variations on "America"]]'' for organ in 1891 at age seventeen. It included a polytonal section in three simultaneous keys, though this was omitted from performances at his father's request, because "it made the boys laugh out loud". Ives was fond of the rapid pedal line in the final variation, which he said was "almost as much fun as playing baseball". The piece was not published until 1949; the final version includes an introduction, seven variations and a polytonal interlude. The piece was adapted for orchestra in 1963 by [[William Schuman]]. This version became popular during the bicentennial celebrations, and is often heard at pops concerts.

[[Muthuswami Dikshitar]] (1776–1835), one of the musical trinity in South Indian classical ([[Carnatic music|Carnatic]]) music composed some [[Sanskrit]] pieces set to Western tunes. These are in the raga [[Dheerasankarabharanam|Sankarabharanam]] and are referred to as "nottu swaras". Among these, the composition "Santatam Pahimam Sangita Shyamale" is set to the tune of "God Save the Queen".

===In popular culture===
The title is ''Dog Save the Queen'', from ''[[T.U.F.F. Puppy]]''

In ''[[Team Fortress 2]]'', one of the Sniper's quotes is the same title as the anthem. This is in reference to New Zealand (the Sniper's birthplace) being a former British colony.

In the movie version of ''[[V for Vendetta]]'' during an episode of Gordon Deitrich's show, which sends up Chancellor Adam Suttler.

In 'The Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen' episode of ''[[Ren &amp; Stimpy]]'' (the song is the Royal Canadian Kilted Yaksmen anthem.)

=== Computer music ===
The anthem was the first piece of music played on a computer, and the first computer music to be recorded.

Musical notes were first generated by a computer programmed by [[Alan Turing]] at the Computing Machine Laboratory of the [[University of Manchester]] in 1948. The first music proper, a performance of the National Anthem was programmed by [[Christopher Strachey]] on the Mark II [[Manchester Electronic Computer]] at same venue, in 1951. Later that year, short extracts of three pieces, the first being the National Anthem, were recorded there by a [[BBC]] outside broadcasting unit: the other pieces being "[[Ba Ba Black Sheep]], and "[[In the Mood]]". Researchers at the [[University of Canterbury]], Christchurch restored the acetate master disc in 2016 and the results may be heard on [[Soundcloud]].&lt;ref name="Turing"&gt;{{cite web|title=First recording of computer-generated music – created by Alan Turing – restored |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/first-recording-computer-generated-music-created-alan-turing-restored-enigma-code |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=28 August 2017 |date=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BL-2016-09"&gt;{{cite web|title=Restoring the first recording of computer music - Sound and vision blog|url=http://blogs.bl.uk/sound-and-vision/2016/09/restoring-the-first-recording-of-computer-music.html|publisher=[[British Library]]|accessdate=28 August 2017|language=en|date=13 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The philosopher and reformer [[Jeremy Bentham]] praised "God Save the King" in 1796: "the melody recommending itself by beauty to the most polished ears, and by its simplicity to the rudest ear. A song of this complexion, implanted by the habit of half a century in the mass of popular sentiment, can not be refused a place in the inventory of the national blessings."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jeremy| last=Bentham| title=Writings on the Poor Laws, Vol. I| editor-first=Michael| editor-last=Quinn| publisher=Clarendon Press| place=Oxford| year=2001| isbn=0199242321| page=136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludwig van Beethoven wrote "I have to show the English a little of what a blessing 'God Save the King' is".&lt;ref&gt;Mathew, Nicholas (2013).

===Calls for a new national anthem/anthems===
There have been calls within the UK for a new national anthem, whether it be for the United Kingdom itself, Britain and/or England (which all currently use God Save the Queen). There are many reasons people cite for wishing for a new national anthem, such as: from a non-religious standpoint&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-34268442 Why some people don't sing the national anthem]. ''BBC NEWS''. Published 16 September 2015. Retrieved 11 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; (the majority of people in the UK today identify as not religious),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41150792 More than half in UK are non-religious, suggests survey]. ''BBC NEWS''. Published 4 September 2017. Retrieved 11 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; claims of God Save the Queen being long outdated and irrelevant in the 21st century,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11868473/Jeremy-Corbyn-was-right-not-to-sing-God-Save-the-Queen.-We-need-a-new-national-anthem.html Jeremy Corbyn was right not to sing 'God Save the Queen'.

The '''Gunderson Do-All Machine''' is a colorful, interconnected network of dozens of machines that have been cross-sectioned to reveal their internal operating mechanisms. It was designed by Mark Gunderson to illustrate mechanical concepts.

== History and design ==
[[Image:Main line shaft and pulley from corn grinder.jpg|thumb|left|Mainline shaft and pulley from corn grinder]]

The Gunderson Do-All Machine includes more than 30 individual machines that are linked together by an array of belts, gears, pulleys, and transmissions.  Collectively, they operate in a continuous chain reaction on the power of one {{convert|10|hp|adj=on}} Whitte gas oil well engine, forming a [[kinetic art|kinetic sculpture]]. The entire network is mounted on a {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} flat bed trailer platform, so that it can be transported to engine shows, educational venues, and county fairs.  The combined weight of the trailer and all components is about 6000 pounds.

The Do-All's layout and design allows one to follow the chain reaction from [[machine]] to machine while observing the internal [[Sprocket|cog]]s, [[gears]], and other components that make them work. The variety of machines include an automatically reversing [[worm gear]], a water pump impellar, a governor/gas valve from a 20-[[horsepower]] (HP) JC engine, a blacksmith blower/bubble maker, the main line shaft and [[pulley]] from an antique corn grinder, a floating gear, a DC 110-[[volt]] generator and lights, a 38-to-1 gear reducer, a bicycle light [[Electrical generator|generator]], and a fan blower painted to look like a clown. Recent additions include a penny press that creates a commemorative Do-All Machine coin and a rotating [[satellite dish]] with sun and moon images painted on opposite sides.

== Major engine components ==

The Gunderson Do-All includes the following major engines that have been cut away to reveal their inner workings in action:

* [[Wright R-2600|Wright Twin Cyclone R-2600]] 1,700 horsepower [[radial engine]] from a [[North American B-25 Mitchell|B-25 Bomber]]
* [[Wankel engine|Wankel Rotary Engine]] from a [[Mazda RX-7]]
* [[Pontiac V8 engine#301|301 Cu in Pontiac V8 engine]] from a [[Pontiac Firebird|TransAm]]

Etheridge received the 2006 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "I Need to Wake Up". Upon receiving the award, she noted in her acceptance speech:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mostly I have to thank Al Gore, for inspiring us, for inspiring me, showing that caring about the Earth is not Republican or Democrat; it's not red or blue, it's all green.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/02/25/gore-wins-hollywood-in-a-landslide Gore Wins Hollywood in a Landslide - The Caucus - Politics - New York Times Blog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''Kaper Koraon Treasure''' is a [[Byzantine silver]] treasure consisting of 56 individual [[silver]] items originating from [[Syria]] in the sixth and seventh centuries.

==History==
The treasure was re-discovered between 1908 and 1910. It was originally believed to have belonged to the church in [[Antioch]], a thriving Roman city on the Mediterranean  It can now be argued that the items come from a larger collection of silver from the church of Saint Sergios in modern-day [[Kurin]], [[Syria]] or that the pieces belonged to a small local church.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evans|first1=Helen|title=The Arts of Byzantium|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|date=2001|volume=58|issue=4|pages=1–68|jstor=3269176}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final items of the collection were likely interred at the site in the seventh century as the [[Byzantine Empire]] subsequently lost this area of Syria to the [[Persian Empire|Persian]] army.  The later conquering by the Muslim Arab army permanently removed the area from Byzantine control.&lt;ref name="JSTOR"/&gt;

It is believed that the Persian and Muslim Arab take-overs were relatively peaceful as historic sites around the area show little to no damage that could be attributed to that time. Though religion began to shift following the change of power and [[Christian]] artifacts were increasingly stored away from public viewing, the area did continue to benefit from relative wealth and prosperity, creating many [[secular]] works. The real halt to production of silver treasures is thought to have followed a plague throughout the area from 542 to 544.  This had a lasting impact on the economic status of the region.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foss|first1=Clive|title=Syria in Transition, A. D. 550-750: An Archaeological Approach|journal=Dumbarton Oak Papers|date=1997|volume=51|pages=189–269|jstor=1291765}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence that this accumulation of local wealth in silver objects was common throughout the area leading up to the Persian control and the sixth century plague.  Similar treasures have been found at [[Stuma]], [[Ariha|Riha]], [[Hama]], and Antioch to name a few.&lt;ref name="Dumbarton"/&gt;

The objects found in the Kaper Koraon treasure were not originally prestigious [[shrine]] gifts but were likely relatively cheap [[imitations]] made specifically for a village [[Church (building)|church]]. This can be clearly seen from recent investigations into the pieces which have shown high quantities of [[copper]] and other metals melted in with the silver to increase malleability and decrease production costs.  It is estimated that these items were the collective donations from five local families over a period of at least three decades.  Many of the stamps present on the pieces are believed to have been added after production and some note the specific [[donor]]s of each piece.&lt;ref name="Walters"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mango|first1=Marlia Mundell|title=Silver from Early Byzantium: the Kaper Koraon and Related Treasures|date=1986|publisher=Walters Art Gallery|location=Baltimore, Maryland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kaper Koraon treasure consists of 56 total silver objects including: eight [[chalice]]s, seven [[paten]]s, five crosses, one [[cross]] [[revetment]], two lamp stands, three lamps, three ewers, one flask, one bowl, one mirror, one box, eleven spoons, one ladle, two strainers, two fans, and four plaques. The other three objects are only partial pieces of broken fragments likely from other [[wikt:plaque|plaque]]s. Many of the items are religious in nature including images of the cross and Jesus's disciples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Byzyntine Legacy: Kaper Koraon Treasure|url=http://www.thebyzantinelegacy.com/walter-kaperkoraon|publisher=Walters Art Museum|accessdate=8 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are believed to be secular but were stored with the church collection either for safe-keeping on behalf of the owner or stores of wealth for the [[parish]].&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Most of the silver pieces shown here still show evidence of hammering either visibly or through careful machine investigation.  Due to the limited skill level of local workers and the overworking of [[malleable]] metal, many items featured here have stress fractures or chips that were original to the piece.  Any repairs visible, such as the re-welding of a handle onto an [[ewar]], are likely original and occurred before the [[internment]] of the treasure.  Many of the chalices were hammered, welded together, and then lathed to smooth out the seams between the cup and the stem.  Some chalices shows signs of wear at these seams and around the top rim due to the method of their construction.&lt;ref name="Walters"/&gt;

Since their discovery, the items of the Kaper Koraon treasure have dispersed into public and private collections throughout the world including [[The Walters Art Museum]].

{{No footnotes|date=May 2009}}
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;!-- See [[Wikipedia talk:Featured lists]] for an explanation of this and other inclusion tags below --&gt;This is a list of persons, places, events, etc. that feature in [[Ezra Pound]]'s ''[[The Cantos]]'', a long, incomplete [[poem]] in 120 sections, each of which is a [[canto]].&lt;/onlyinclude&gt; It is a book-length work, widely considered to present formidable difficulties to the reader. Strong claims have been made for it as one of the most significant works of [[modernist poetry]] of the twentieth century. As in Pound's prose writing, the themes of [[economics]], [[governance]] and [[culture]] are integral to its content.

The most striking feature of the text, to a casual browser, is the inclusion of [[Chinese character]]s as well as quotations in European [[language]]s other than English. Recourse to scholarly commentaries is almost inevitable for a [[Close reading|close reader]]. The range of allusion to historical events and other works of literature is very broad, and abrupt changes occur with the minimum of stage directions.

This list serves as a collection of links to information on a wide range of these references with clear indications of the cantos in which they appear. It also gives relevant citations to Pound's other writings, especially his prose, and translations of non-English words and phrases where appropriate. Where authors are quoted or referred to, but not named, the reference is listed under their names and the quoted words or phrases are given after the relevant canto number. Individual canto numbers are given in bold for ease of reference.

*[[Guido Cavalcanti]] - 13th-century Italian poet and friend of Dante, who condemned his father to hell in the ''Divine Comedy''. In his 1928 essay, ''How to Read'', Pound lists Cavalcanti among the ''inventors'', or poets who were responsible for introducing something to the art that had never been done before. In an essay published in 1934 and written between 1911 and 1931, Pound wrote "Guido is called a '[[natural philosopher]]', I think an '[[atheist]]', and certainly an '[[Epicurean]]', not that anyone had then any clear idea or has now any very definite notion of what [[Epicurus]] taught. But a natural philosopher was a much less safe person than a 'moral philosopher'. It is not so much what Guido says in [''Donna mi pregha''], as the familiarity that he shows with dangerous thinking; ''natural demonstration'' and the proof by experience or (?) experiment... we may perhaps consider Guido as one of that 'tenuous line who from [[Albertus Magnus]] to the renaissance' meant the freedom of thought, the contempt, or at least a moderated respect, for stupid authority." - '''Cantos IV and XX''': an allusion to and a quotations from the poem ''Una figura della Donna mia'', which refers daringly to the resemblance between Cavalcanti's beloved and the image of the Madonna in a Florentine church. - '''Canto XXXVI''': a translation of ''Donna mi prega''. - '''Canto LXXIII''': a lengthy speech (in Italian) by Guido's ghost. - '''Canto XCI''': "I send to Pinella ... a river", from the poem ''Ciascuna fresca e dolce fontanella''.

*[[Horace Cole]] - '''Cantos LXXX, LXXXI'''
*[[Padraic Colum]] - '''Canto LXXX''': His "O woman shapely as a swan" (from a poem called ''Drover'') quoted. Pound praised this poem in his 1918 essay ''A Retrospect''.
*[[Confucius]] – Also called '''Kung, Kung-fu-tseu''' and '''Chung''' at various points in the poem. Pound saw himself as a committed follower of the Chinese philosopher and translated the ''[[Analects of Confucius|Analects]]'', the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'', the ''[[Great Learning|Great Digest]]'' and the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean|Unwobbling Pivot]]''. Under the various version of his name, Confucius appears in ''The Cantos'' at least 76 times. The first and most comprehensive of these appearances is in '''Canto XIII''' - Also in '''Canto LI''': Ideogram at end is Confucian "rectification of names", '''Canto LII''': ''[[Classic of Rites|Li Ki]]'', '''Canto LIII''': Cut 3,000 odes to 300.
**The four Tuan, or foundations (benevolence, rectitude, manners and knowledge) – '''Cantos LXXXV, LXXXIX'''

*[[Cumaean Sibyl]] - '''Cantos LXIV, XC'''
*[[Cunizza da Romano]] (1198–1279) - Mistress of poet [[Sordello]], sister of [[Ezzelino III da Romano]]. She is one of the most important heroines of ''The Cantos'', a type of the poet's sexual and spiritual muse. She "freed her slaves" ('''Canto VI''') in her will, a document which she dictated in Florence "in the house of the Cavalcanti / anno 1265" ('''Canto XXIX'''). Pound imagined that [[Guido Cavalcanti]] knew of this and mentioned it to his friend [[Dante]] who therefore pardoned her profligacy and placed her in the Heaven of Venus (''Paradiso'' IX): "The light of this star o’ercame me" ('''Canto XXIX'''). This passage is cited in Italian in '''Canto XCII''': "fui chiamat’ / e qui refulgo". '''Canto XC''' associates her with [[John Randolph of Roanoke]] ("liberavit masnatos").
*[[Thomas Cushing]] – American politician who opposed independence – '''Canto LXII'''

The following is a '''list of common metonyms'''.&lt;ref group="n"&gt;Since metonymy –&amp;nbsp;the process by which metonyms are formed&amp;nbsp;– is a [[Productivity (linguistics)|productive]] process, new metonyms can always be created. This list cannot include all metonyms, but only some of those that are identified as common.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[metonym]] is a figure of speech used in rhetoric in which a thing or concept is not called by its own name, but by the name of something intimately associated with that thing or concept. For instance, "Westminster", a borough of London in the United Kingdom, could be used as a metonym for the country's government. &lt;!--[Self-evident?:] (See below for more examples.)--&gt;

The '''''Madonna and Child with Sts Jerome and Mary Magdalen (The Day)''''' is an [[oil painting|oil on canvas]] painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Antonio Allegri|Correggio]] dating from around 1528 and housed in the [[Galleria Nazionale di Parma|Galleria Nazionale]] of [[Parma]], [[Italy]].

==History==
The canvas was commissioned in 1523 by Briseide Colla for a private chapel on the right side of the church of [[Sant'Antonio Abate, Parma|Sant'Antonio Abate]] in Parma. Contemporary art historian and painter [[Giorgio Vasari]] described the work's ''il mirabile colorito'' ("wonderful color"), and it was also studied by [[El Greco]].

In the early 18th century, the church needed costly restoration works and several collectors, including the Kings of Poland and France and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], offered to buy the work. However, in 1749 it was transferred into the [[Cathedral of Parma]] and later was bought by the [[Duchy of Parma]]. During the [[Napoleonic Wars|French occupation of northern Italy]], it was stolen and brought to France. The painting was returned to Italy in 1815 and placed on display in the Parma gallery. A 1724 copy of the painting hangs in the chapel of [[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10676">'''Monoethnicity''' is the existence of a single [[ethnic group]] in a given [[region]] or country. It is the opposite of [[polyethnicity]].

[[China]] is the largest monoethnic country; 91.6% of the population are [[Han Chinese]]. An example of a largely monoethnic country is [[Japan]]. It is a common belief in Japan that the entire country is monoethnic, but a few [[Ethnic issues in Japan#Japanese ethnic minorities|ethnic minorities live in Japan]] (e.g. [[Zainichi|Koreans]], [[Ainu people|Ainus]] and [[Ryukyuan people|Ryukyuans]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|page=36|title=Refugee Law and Practice in Japan|author=Osamu Arakaki|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|date=2008|isbn=0754670090}}&lt;/ref&gt; They represent around 1% of the whole population.&lt;ref&gt;{{ja icon}} [http://www.moj.go.jp/content/000108878.pdf] {{lang|ja| 平成２４年末現在における外国人登録者統計について}}].&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[South Korea]]ns regard themselves as a monoethnic society, although there are small ethnic minorities that exist in South Korea, where they account for around 1% of the South Korean population. These include around 650,000 Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 2009-02-24 | newspaper = The Los Angeles Times | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/24/world/fg-korea-teach24 | title = Trying to teach South Korea about discrimination}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most [[Sub-Saharan African]] countries have what would be considered a mono-[[racial]] society, but it's common to find dozens of ethnic groups within the same country.

The [[Yugoslav Wars]] are noted as having made territories "[[de facto]] and [[de jure]] monoethnic nation-states".&lt;ref name="Dempsey2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gary Dempsey|title=Exiting the Balkan Thicket|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EG_jyoDpN1EC&amp;pg=PA91|year=2002|publisher=Cato Institute|isbn=978-1-930865-17-4|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Zealand Māori cricket team''' is a team that represented the [[Māori people|Māori]] community of [[New Zealand]] in the 2001 [[Pacifica Cup]] [[cricket]] tournament. Whilst their [[New Zealand Māori rugby union team|rugby union]] and [[New Zealand Māori rugby league team|rugby league counterparts]] play often, this is the only appearance to date of the cricket team.

==2001 Pacifica Cup==

The New Zealand Māori team took part in the first Pacifica Cup. They topped their first round group, winning all three of their matches against the [[Cook Islands national cricket team|Cook Islands]], [[Papua New Guinea national cricket team|Papua New Guinea]] and [[Samoa national cricket team|Samoa]]. They then beat [[Tonga national cricket team|Tonga]] in the semi-finals before beating [[Fiji national cricket team|Fiji]] in the final to win the tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2001/TOURNAMENTS/PACIFICACUP/about.shtml 2001 Pacifica Cup] at CricketEurope&lt;/ref&gt; They did not compete in the 2002 tournament.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cricketeurope4.net/CRICKETEUROPE/DATABASE/2002/TOURNAMENTS/PACIFICACUP/about.shtml 2002 Pacifica Cup] at CricketEurope&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[entertainment]], an '''origin story''' is an account or [[back-story]] revealing how a [[Character (arts)|character]] or group of people become a [[protagonist]] or [[antagonist]], and it adds to the overall study of a [[narrative]], often giving reasons for their intentions.

In [[American comic book]]s, it also refers to how characters gained their [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s and/or the circumstances under which they became [[superhero]]es or [[supervillain]]s. In order to keep their characters current, comic book companies, as well as cartoon companies, game companies, children's show companies, and toy companies, frequently rewrite the origins of their oldest characters. This goes from adding details that do not contradict earlier facts to a totally new origin which makes it seem that it is an altogether different character.

A [[pourquoi story]], also dubbed an "origin story", is also used in [[mythology]], referring to narratives of how a world began, how creatures and plants came into existence, and why certain things in the cosmos have certain yet distinct qualities.

== Critical explorations of the origin story ==

In ''The Superhero Reader'' (nominated for a 2014 [[Eisner Award]] for Best Scholarly/Academic Work), edited by Charles Hatfield (Professor at University of Connecticut), Jeet Heer (Toronto-based journalist), and Dr. Kent Worcester (Professor of Political Science at [[Marymount Manhattan College]]), the editors write in "Section One: Historical Considerations":  "Almost all superheroes have an origin story: a bedrock account of the transformative events that set the protagonist apart from ordinary humanity. If not a prerequisite for the superhero genre, the origin... is certainly a prominent and popular trope that recurs so frequently as to offer clues to the nature of this narrative tradition. To read stories about destroyed worlds, murdered parents, genetic mutations, and mysterious power-giving wizards is to realize the degree to which the superhero genre is about transformation, about identity, about difference, and about the tension between psychological rigidity and a flexible and fluid sense of human nature. ... When surveying the superhero genre, preliminary questions often turn to the problem of roots." The book has a wealth of pertinent bibliographies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Hatfield, Charles|title= The Superhero Reader |location= Jackson, Mississippi |publisher= University Press of Mississippi |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 9781617038068|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English professors Dr. Alex Romagnoli and Dr. Gian S. Pagnucci, of [[Indiana University of Pennsylvania]], discuss in their book ''Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature'' "the nature of superhero origin stories and how the writing of these origin stories helps make superhero narratives a unique literary genre."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= Introduction |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 3 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they write, "Superheroes get very complicated when it comes to their histories, but one part of their stories remains forever constant and important. Even more than 'death' stories, [[Fictional crossover|crossovers]], event stories, and attire changes, origin stories are the core of superheroes' existences. Origins not only reflect the sociohistorical contexts in which heroes were created, but they also reflect a culture's understanding of what makes superheroes storytelling unique vehicles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Romagnoli |first1= Alex S. |last2= Pagnucci |first2= Gian S. |title= Enter the Superheroes: American Values, Culture, and the Canon of Superhero Literature |chapter= 6. Superhero Storytelling |location= Lanham, Maryland |publisher= [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield#Scarecrow Books|Scarecrow Books]] |year= 2013 |page= 109 |ISBN= 0-810-89171-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, Romagnoli and Pagnucci go on to explain why the origin story is as important to the audience as to the generations of writers who continue heroic tales.

Dr. Randy Duncan (comics scholar and professor of communication, Henderson State University, Arkadelphia, Arkansas) and Dr. Matthew J. Smith (Department of Communication, Wittenberg University, Springfield, Ohio) use the origin story of [[Spider-Man]] as an example of how a [[Character (arts)|character]] can be created by the persistence of a writer who has definite preferences in creating a character's personality, even if the publisher resists. "It is difficult to discern which is more often told: Spider-Man's origin or the tales told around that origin. All reveal fascinating aspects of a teenage loner fatefully 'bitten by a radioactive spider' to find himself with 'the proportionate strength and agility of an arachnid'." Duncan and Smith explain how [[Stan Lee]] butted heads with publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]], who worried about an "ick factor," but Lee prevailed. "The entire Spider-Man concept resonates with the primary attributes of many genres and traditions," the authors say. "Like a heady puree of [Mary] Shelley's ''[[Frankenstein]]'', Bob Kane's Batman, and Franz Kafka's ''Metamorphosis'', Spider-Man's origin invokes gothic and crime fiction motifs like the ostracized genius, doomed loved ones, the misuse or misfiring of science, the gritty noir city, the driven vigilante, and the fateful [[Uncanny|'return of the repressed']]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= Vol. 1 |page= 684 |ISBN= 9780313399237}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors proceed to investigate these various issues of the origin story.

*[[Spider-Man]] – Bitten by a radioactive spider, Peter Parker found himself bestowed with spider-based superpowers. He was motivated to fight crime by his [[uncle Ben|uncle's]] death, which he blames on himself.&lt;br/&gt;A 2012 comic book specifically addresses the origin of Peter's transformation: ''The Amazing Spider-Man: An Origin Story'' (authors given as [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Staff, [[Scott Peterson (comics)|Scott Peterson]], [[Stan Lee]], and [[Steve Ditko]]; 64 pp.; {{ISBN|978-1-74283-234-0}}); as well as its identically named revision ''The Amazing Spider-Man: An Origin Story'' (2013; {{ISBN|1742837271}}).&lt;br/&gt;Works both scholarly and entertaining discuss Peter's origin story and its variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tallon |first= Philip |chapter= 6.

[T]he death of Peter Parker's uncle powerfully shapes his hero ethos and his desire to fight crime. ... [Footnote 1] There are three notable differences between the film and the comic versions of the Spider-Man origin. The first is that in the comic, Peter Parker was not provoked in any way to allow the thief to escape (as he was in the film by the rude behavior of the promoter). The second is that in ''Amazing Fantasy #15'', Uncle Ben never utters the line "With great power comes great responsibility." Rather, this line is stated in the final narration. The third is that in the film, Uncle Ben is killed while waiting for Peter in the car, but in the comic, he's killed in a home invasion. Notably, in more recent issues of the comic, Uncle Ben's murder and the origin of the "great responsibility" line have been retroactively changed ("[[Retroactive continuity|retconned]]") to fit with the movie version. |ISBN= 978-0-470-57560-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Duncan |first1= Randy |last2= Smith |first2= Matthew J. |title= Icons of the American Comic Book: From Captain America to Wonder Woman |location= Santa Barbara, CA |publisher= Greenwood Press |series= (Series: Greenwood icons) |year= 2013 |volume= 1 |page= 684 |isbn= 9780313399237 |quote= In the final panel of his origin story, a devastated Spider-Man turns away from readers: 'a lean and silent figure' fades 'into the gathering darkness, aware at last that in this world, with great power must also come – great responsibility!'

A '''purse hook''' (also known as a ''' handbag hook''' or '''handbag hanger''') is a type of hook meant to temporarily secure a [[Coin purse|purse]] or [[handbag]] to a table, sink or armrest. Such hooks have been available since the 1920s. [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] is said to employ an S-shaped one to hang her handbags on.&lt;ref name="hooks"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Anne Kingston| title=Would you put $8,000 on the floor?| url=http://www.macleans.ca/culture/lifestyle/article.jsp?content=20080709_37497_37497| journal=Maclean's Magazine| year=2008| page=56| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516032556/http://www.macleans.ca/culture/lifestyle/article.jsp?content=20080709_37497_37497| archivedate=2012-05-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for use==
The practical uses are numerous; hanging a purse, bag, groceries, umbrella or any item that can be hung and needs to be kept close, for convenient access or to discourage theft.

A bag placed on the floor in a restaurant or bathroom will collect [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[virus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/disease/purse.asp Snopes: Bag-teria]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]] there is a superstition that a woman will lose all of her money if she puts her purse on the floor.&lt;ref name="hooks"/&gt;

== Types ==
There are at least five types of purse hooks available. The order is based on patent file dates.

* The original L style type with a circular pad and a rigid bent wire.
* The link type with circular pad and a set links that either wrap around the pad or make a "hook"
* A spring closing bracelet type
* A twisting ring type
* An S-shaped purse hanger

'''Renaissance art''' is the painting, sculpture and decorative arts of the period of European history, emerging as a distinct style in Italy in about 1400, in parallel with developments which occurred in [[Renaissance philosophy|philosophy]], [[Renaissance literature|literature]], [[Renaissance music|music]], and [[Renaissance science|science]]. Renaissance art, perceived as the noblest of ancient traditions, took as its foundation the art of [[Classical antiquity]], but transformed that tradition by absorbing recent developments in the art of Northern Europe and by applying contemporary scientific knowledge. Renaissance art, with [[Renaissance Humanism|Renaissance Humanist philosophy]], spread throughout Europe, affecting both artists and their patrons with the development of new techniques and new artistic sensibilities. Renaissance art marks the transition of Europe from the medieval period to the [[Early Modern]] age.
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|450px|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'', c. 1485. [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
In many parts of Europe, Early Renaissance art was created in parallel with [[Gothic art|Late Medieval art]].
Renaissance art, painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and literature produced during the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries in Europe under the combined influences of an increased awareness of nature, a revival of classical learning, and a more individualistic view of man. Scholars no longer believe that the Renaissance marked an abrupt break with medieval values, as is suggested by the French word renaissance, literally “rebirth.” Rather, historical sources suggest that interest in nature, humanistic learning, and individualism were already present in the late medieval period and became dominant in 15th- and 16th-century Italy concurrently with social and economic changes such as the secularization of daily life, the rise of a rational money-credit economy, and greatly increased social mobility.
The influences upon the development of Renaissance men and women in the early 15th century are those that also affected Philosophy, Literature, Architecture, Theology, Science, Government, and other aspects of society. The following list presents a summary, dealt with more fully in the main articles that are cited above.
* Classical texts, lost to European scholars for centuries, became available. These included Philosophy, Prose, Poetry, Drama, Science, a thesis on the Arts, and Early Christian Theology.
* Simultaneously, Europe gained access to advanced mathematics which had its provenance in the works of Islamic scholars.
* The advent of movable type [[printing]] in the 15th century meant that ideas could be disseminated easily, and an increasing number of books were written for a broad public.
* The establishment of the [[Medici]] Bank and the subsequent trade it generated brought unprecedented wealth to a single Italian city, [[Florence]].
* [[Cosimo de' Medici the Elder|Cosimo de' Medici]] set a new standard for patronage of the arts, not associated with the church or monarchy.
* [[Humanism|Humanist]] philosophy meant that man's relationship with humanity, the universe and with God was no longer the exclusive province of the Church.
* A revived interest in the [[Classical literature|Classics]] brought about the first archaeological study of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] remains by the architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and sculptor [[Donatello]]. The revival of a style of architecture based on classical precedents inspired a corresponding classicism in painting and sculpture, which manifested itself as early as the 1420s in the paintings of [[Masaccio]] and [[Uccello]].
* The improvement of [[oil paint]] and developments in oil-painting technique by Dutch artists such as [[Robert Campin]], [[Jan van Eyck]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] led to its adoption in Italy from about 1475 and had ultimately lasting effects on painting practices, worldwide.
* The [[serendipity|serendipitous]] presence within the region of [[Florence]] in the early 15th century of certain individuals of artistic genius, most notably [[Masaccio]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Lorenzo Ghiberti|Ghiberti]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Donatello]] and [[Michelozzo]] formed an ethos out of which sprang the great masters of the High Renaissance, as well as supporting and encouraging many lesser artists to achieve work of extraordinary quality.&lt;ref name=Hartt&gt;Frederick Hartt, ''A History of Italian Renaissance Art'', (1970)&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar heritage of artistic achievement occurred in [[Venice]] through the talented [[Jacopo Bellini|Bellini]] family, their influential in-law [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]], [[Giorgione]], [[Titian]] and [[Tintoretto]].&lt;ref name=Hartt/&gt;&lt;ref name=MB&gt;Michael Baxandall, ''Painting and Experience in Fifteenth Century Italy'', (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Aston, ''The Fifteenth Century, the Prospect of Europe'', (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The publication of two treatises by [[Leone Battista Alberti]], ''De Pitura'' (''On Painting''), 1435, and ''[[De re aedificatoria]]'' (''Ten Books on Architecture''), 1452.

==History==
===Proto-Renaissance in Italy, 1280–1400===
[[File:Giotto - Scrovegni - -36- - Lamentation (The Mourning of Christ) adj.jpg|thumb|upright=1.50|[[Giotto]]: ''The Lamentation'', c. 1305, [[Scrovegni Chapel]], foreshadows the Renaissance.|alt= Square fresco.

{{main article|Italian Renaissance painting}}
In Italy in the late 13th and early 14th centuries, the sculpture of [[Nicola Pisano]] and his son [[Giovanni Pisano]], working at [[Pisa]], [[Siena]] and [[Pistoia]] shows markedly classicising tendencies, probably influenced by the familiarity of these artists with ancient Roman [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]]. Their masterpieces are the pulpits of the Baptistery and [[Pisa Cathedral|Cathedral of Pisa]]. 

Contemporary with Giovanni Pisano, the Florentine painter [[Giotto]] developed a manner of figurative painting that was unprecedentedly naturalistic, three-dimensional, lifelike and classicist, when compared with that of his contemporaries and teacher [[Cimabue]]. Giotto, whose greatest work is the cycle of the ''Life of Christ'' at the [[Arena Chapel]] in [[Padua]], was seen by the 16th century biographer [[Giorgio Vasari]] as "rescuing and restoring art" from the "crude, traditional, Byzantine style" prevalent in Italy in the 13th century.

===Early Netherlandish art, 1425–1525===
{{main article|Early Netherlandish painting}}
[[File:El Descendimiento, by Rogier van der Weyden, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rogier van der Weyden]], ''[[The Descent from the Cross (Rogier van der Weyden)|The Descent from the Cross]]'' (c. 1435), oil on oak panel, {{convert|220|×|262|cm|0|abbr=on}}. [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid]]
The painters of the [[Netherlands (terminology)|Low Countries]] in this period included [[Jan van Eyck]], his brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], [[Robert Campin]], [[Hans Memling]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]]. Their painting developed partly independently of Early Italian Renaissance painting, and without the influence of a deliberate and conscious striving to revive antiquity. 

The style of painting grew directly out of medieval painting in [[tempera]], on panels and [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and other forms such as [[stained glass]]; the medium of [[fresco]] was less common in northern Europe.  The medium used was [[oil paint]], which had long been utilised for painting leather ceremonial shields and accoutrements, because it was flexible and relatively durable. The earliest Netherlandish oil paintings are meticulous and detailed like tempera paintings. The material lent itself to the depiction of tonal variations and texture, so facilitating the observation of nature in great detail.  

The Netherlandish painters did not approach the creation of a picture through a framework of linear perspective and correct proportion. They maintained a medieval view of hierarchical proportion and religious symbolism, while delighting in a realistic treatment of material elements, both natural and man-made. Jan van Eyck, with his brother [[Hubert van Eyck|Hubert]], painted ''[[Ghent Altarpiece|The Altarpiece of the Mystical Lamb]]''. It is probable that [[Antonello da Messina]] became familiar with Van Eyck's work, while in Naples or Sicily. In 1475, Hugo van der Goes' ''[[Portinari Altarpiece]]'' arrived in Florence where it was to have a profound influence on many painters, most immediately [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] who painted an altarpiece imitating its elements.

A very significant Netherlandish painter towards the end of the period was [[Hieronymus Bosch]], who employed the type of fanciful forms that were often utilized to decorate borders and letters in illuminated manuscripts, combining plant and animal forms with architectonic ones. When taken from the context of the illumination and peopled with humans, these forms give Bosch's paintings a surreal quality which have no parallel in the work of any other Renaissance painter. His masterpiece is the triptych ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.

===Early Renaissance in Italy, 1400–1495===

Although both the Pisanos and Giotto had students and followers, the first truly Renaissance artists were not to emerge in Florence until 1401 with the competition to sculpt a set of [[Florence Baptistry#Lorenzo Ghiberti|bronze doors]] of the Baptistery of [[Florence Cathedral]] which drew entries from seven young sculptors including [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]], [[Donatello]] and the winner, [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]]. Brunelleschi, most famous as the architect of the dome of Florence Cathedral and the Church of San Lorenzo, created a number of sculptural works, including a lifesized Crucifix in [[Santa Maria Novella]], renowned for its naturalism. His studies of perspective are thought to have influenced the painter [[Masaccio]]. [[Donatello]] became renowned as the greatest sculptor of the Early Renaissance, his masterpieces being his Humanist and unusually erotic statue of [[David (Bible)|David]], one of the icons of the Florentine republic, and his great monument to [[Gattamelata]], the first large equestrian bronze to be created since Roman times.

The contemporary of Donatello, [[Masaccio]], was the painterly descendant of Giotto and began the Early Renaissance in Italian Painting in 1425, furthering the trend towards solidity of form and naturalism of face and gesture that Giotto had begun a century earlier.  From 1425-28, Masaccio completed several panel paintings but is best known for the fresco cycle that he began in the [[Brancacci Chapel]] with the older artist [[Masolino]] and which had profound influence on later painters, including [[Michelangelo]]. Masaccio's developments were carried forward in the paintings of [[Fra Angelico]], particularly in his frescos at the Convent of San Marco in Florence.

The treatment of the elements of perspective and light in painting was of particular concern to 15th-century Florentine painters. [[Uccello]] was so obsessed with trying to achieve an appearance of perspective that, according to Vasari, it disturbed his sleep. His solutions can be seen in his masterpiece set of three paintings, the [[Battle of San Romano]] which is believed to have been completed by 1460. [[Piero della Francesca]] made systematic and scientific studies of both light and linear perspective, the results of which can be seen in his fresco cycle of ''[[The History of the True Cross]]'' in [[San Francesco, Arezzo]].

In [[Naples]], the painter [[Antonello da Messina]] began using oil paints for portraits and religious paintings at a date that preceded other Italian painters, possibly about 1450. He carried this technique north and influenced the painters of [[Venice]]. One of the most significant painters of Northern Italy was [[Andrea Mantegna]], who decorated the interior of a room, ''the [[Camera degli Sposi]]'' for his patron [[Ludovico III Gonzaga|Ludovico Gonzaga]], setting portraits of the family and court into an illusionistic architectural space.

The end period of the Early Renaissance in Italian art is marked, like its beginning, by a particular commission that drew artists together, this time in cooperation rather than competition. [[Pope Sixtus IV]] had rebuilt the Papal Chapel, named the [[Sistine Chapel]] in his honour, and commissioned a group of artists, [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Pietro Perugino]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]] and [[Cosimo Rosselli]] to decorate its wall with fresco cycles depicting ''the Life of Christ'' and ''the Life of Moses''. In the sixteen large paintings, the artists, although each working in his individual style, agreed on principals of format, and utilised the techniques of lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation that had been carried to a high point in the large Florentine studios of Ghiberti, Verrocchio, Ghirlandaio and Perugino.

===Early Renaissance in France, 1375–1528===
The artists of France, (including duchies such as [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]]) were often associated with courts, providing illuminated manuscripts and portraits for the nobility as well as devotional paintings and altarpieces.  Among the most famous were the [[Limbourg brothers]], Flemish illuminators and creators of the [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. [[Jean Fouquet]], painter of the royal court, visited Italy in 1437 and reflects the influence of Florentine painters such as [[Paolo Uccello]]. Although best known for his portraits such as that of [[Charles VII of France]] Fouquet also created illuminations, and is thought to be the inventor of the portrait miniature. There were a number of artists at this date who painted famed altarpieces, that are stylistically quite distinct from both the Italian and the Flemish. These include two enigmatic figures, [[Enguerrand Quarton]] to whom is ascribed the ''Pieta of Villeneuve-lès-Avignon'', and [[Jean Hey]], otherwise known as "the Master of Moulins" after his most famous work, ''the Moulins Altarpiece''. In these works realism and close observation of the human figure, emotions and lighting are combined with a Medieval formality, which includes gilt backgrounds.

===High Renaissance in Italy, 1495-1520===
{{main article|High Renaissance|Italian Renaissance painting}}
[[File:Creación de Adám.jpg|thumb|Michelangelo, (c. 1511) ''[[The Creation of Adam]]'', from the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]]]]
The "universal genius" [[Leonardo da Vinci]] was to further perfect the aspects of pictorial art (lighting, linear and atmospheric perspective, anatomy, foreshortening and characterisation) that had preoccupied artists of the Early Renaissance, in a lifetime of studying and meticulously recording his observations of the natural world. His adoption of oil paint as his primary media meant that he could depict light and its effects on the landscape and objects more naturally and with greater dramatic effect than had ever been done before, as demonstrated in the ''[[Mona Lisa]]''. His dissection of cadavers carried forward the understanding of skeletal and muscular anatomy, as seen in the unfinished ''St Jerome''.  His depiction of human emotion in ''The Last Supper'', completed 1495-1498, set the benchmark for religious painting.

The art of Leonardo's younger contemporary [[Michelangelo]] took a very different direction. Michelangelo, in neither his painting nor his sculpture demonstrates any interest in the observation of any natural object except the human body. He perfected his technique in depicting it, while in his early twenties, by the creation of the enormous marble statue of ''David'' and the group ''the Pieta'', in [[St Peter's Basilica]], Rome. He then set about an exploration of the expressive possibilities of the human anatomy. His commission by [[Pope Julius II]] to paint the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] resulted in the supreme masterpiece of figurative composition, which was to have profound effect on every subsequent generation of European artists&lt;ref&gt;https://www.laetitiana.co.uk/2014/07/introduction-to-renaissance-movement.html&lt;/ref&gt;.  His later work, ''The Last Judgement'', painted on the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel between 1534 and 1541 shows a Mannerist (also called Late Renaissance) style with generally elongated bodies which took over from the High Renaissance style between 1520 and 1530.

Standing alongside Leonardo and Michelangelo as the third great painter of the High Renaissance was the younger [[Raphael]], who in a short life span painted a great number of lifelike and engaging portraits, including those of Pope Julius II and his successor [[Pope Leo X]], and numerous portrayals of the Madonna and Christ Child, including the [[Sistine Madonna]].  His death in 1520 at age 37 is considered by many art historians to be the end of the High Renaissance period, although some individual artists continued working in the High Renaissance style for many years thereafter.

In Northern Italy the High Renaissance is represented by the latter works of [[Giovanni Bellini]], especially religious paintings, which include several large altarpieces of a type known as "[[Sacred Conversation]]" which show a group of saints around the enthroned Madonna. His contemporary [[Giorgione]], who died at about the age of 32 in 1510, left a small number of enigmatic works, including ''[[The Tempest (painting)|The Tempest]]'', the subject of which has remained a matter of speculation. The earliest works of [[Titian]] date from the era of the High Renaissance, including a massive altarpiece ''[[Assumption of the Virgin (Titian)|The Assumption of the Virgin]]'' which combines human action and drama with spectacular colour and atmosphere.  Titian continued painting in a generally High Renaissance style until near the end of his career in the 1570s, although he increasingly used colour and light over line to define his figures.

{{main article|German Renaissance}}
German Renaissance art falls into the broader category of the Renaissance in Northern Europe, also known as the [[Northern Renaissance]]. 
Renaissance influences began to appear in German art in the 15th century, but this trend was not widespread. Gardner's ''Art Through the Ages'' identifies [[Michael Pacher]], a painter and sculptor, as the first German artist whose work begins to show Italian Renaissance influences. According to that source, Pacher's painting, ''St. Wolfgang Forces the Devil to Hold His Prayerbook'' (c.1481), is Late Gothic in style, but also shows the influence of the Italian artist, [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|page=555|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Artisans, such as engravers, became more concerned with aesthetics rather than just perfecting their craft. Germany had master engravers, such as [[Martin Schongauer]], who did metal engravings in the late 1400s. Gardner relates this mastery of the graphic arts to advances in printing which occurred in Germany, and says that metal engraving began to replace the woodcut during the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=555–556|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], continued to do woodcuts. Both Gardner and Russell describe the fine quality of Dürer's woodcuts, with Russell stating, in ''The World of Dürer'', that Dürer "elevated them into high works of art."&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Francis|title=The World of Dürer|date=1967|publisher=Time Life Books, Time Inc.|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In the 1500s, Renaissance art in Germany became more common as, according to Gardner, "The art of northern Europe during the sixteenth century is characterized by a sudden awareness of the advances made by the Italian Renaissance and by a desire to assimilate this new style as rapidly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=556–557|edition=6th|ref=Gardner|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the best known practitioners of German Renaissance art was Albrecht Dürer (1471–1528). Dürer's fascination with classical ideas led him to Italy to study art. Both Gardner and Russell recognized the importance of Durer's contribution to German art in bringing Italian Renaissance styles and ideas to Germany.&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=561|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell calls this "Opening the Gothic windows of German art,"&lt;ref name="The World of Dürer"/&gt; while Gardner calls it Dürer's "life mission."&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; Importantly, as Gardner points out, Dürer "was the first northern artist who fully understood the basic aims of the southern Renaissance,"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; although his style did not always reflect that. The same source says that [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] (1497–1543) successfully assimilated Italian ideas while also keeping "northern traditions of close realism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=564|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is contrasted against Dürer's tendency to work in "his own native German style"&lt;ref name="Art Through the Ages"/&gt; instead of combining German and Italian styles.
Other important artists of the German Renaissance were [[Matthias Grünewald|Grünewald]], [[Albrecht Altdorfer]], and [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardner|first1=Helen|last2=De la Croix|first2=Horst|last3=Tansey|first3=Richard G|title=Art Through the Ages|date=1975|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|location=New York|isbn=0-15-503753-6|pages=557|edition=6th|chapter=The Renaissance in Northern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Britain==
Britain was very late to develop a Renaissance style and most [[artists of the Tudor court]] were imported foreigners, usually from the [[Low countries]], including [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], who died in England.  One exception was the [[portrait miniature]], which artists including [[Nicholas Hilliard]] developed into a distinct genre, well before it became popular in the rest of Europe. [[Renaissance_in_Scotland#Art|Renaissance art in Scotland]] was similarly dependent on imported artists, and largely restricted to the court.

==Themes and symbolism==
[[File:Magnificatio.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]], ''[[Magnificat Madonna]]'', 1480–81, tempera on panel, [[Uffizi]], [[Florence]]]]
Renaissance artists painted a wide variety of themes. Religious [[altarpiece]]s, [[fresco]] cycles, and small works for private devotion were very popular. For inspiration, painters in both Italy and northern Europe frequently turned to [[Jacobus de Voragine]]'s ''[[Golden Legend]]'' (1260), a highly influential source book for the lives of [[saint]]s that had already had a strong influence on Medieval artists. The rebirth of classical antiquity and [[Renaissance humanism]] also resulted in many [[Mythology|Mythological]] and [[history painting]]s. [[Ovidian]] stories, for example, were very popular. Decorative [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]], often used in painted architectural elements, was especially influenced by classical Roman motifs.

==Techniques==
* The use of [[proportion (architecture)|proportion]] – The first major treatment of the painting as a window into space appeared in the work of [[Giotto di Bondone]], at the beginning of the 14th century.  True linear perspective was formalized later, by [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]].  In addition to giving a more realistic presentation of art, it moved Renaissance painters into composing more paintings.
* [[Foreshortening]] – The term foreshortening refers to the artistic effect of shortening lines in a drawing so as to create an illusion of depth.
* [[Sfumato]] – The term sfumato was coined by Italian Renaissance artist, Leonardo da Vinci, and refers to a fine art painting technique of blurring or softening of sharp outlines by subtle and gradual blending of one tone into another through the use of thin glazes to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This stems from the Italian word sfumare meaning to evaporate or to fade out. The Latin origin is fumare, to smoke.
* [[Chiaroscuro]] – The term chiaroscuro refers to the fine art painting modeling effect of using a strong contrast between light and dark to give the illusion of depth or three-dimensionality. This comes from the Italian words meaning light (chiaro) and dark (scuro), a technique which came into wide use in the Baroque Period.

[[File:رثاء عبد الغني آل جميل.jpg|thumb|Rithā written in ancient Arabic script in 1863]]
'''Rithā’''' ({{lang-ar|رثاء}}) is a genre of Arabic poetry corresponding to [[elegy]] or [[lament]]. Along with elegy proper (''marthiyah'', plural ''marāthī''), ''rithā’'' may also contain ''taḥrīḍ'' (incitement to vengeance).&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, ''The Mute Immortals Speak: Pre-Islamic Poetry and the Poetics of Ritual'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was used by both male and female poets, and is one of the main genres in which [[Medieval Arabic female poets|ancient and medieval Arabic female poets]] are known to have composed.&lt;ref&gt;Tahera Qutbuddin, 'Women Poets', in ''Medieval Islamic Civilisation: An Encyclopedia'', ed. by Josef W. Meri, 2 vols (New York: Routledge, 2006), II 865, http://nelc.uchicago.edu/sites/nelc.uchicago.edu/files/2006%20Women%20Poets%20(Med.%20Islamic.%20Civ.%20Enc.).pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, almost all our pre-Islamic women's poetry is in this form.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, ''The Mute Immortals Speak: Pre-Islamic Poetry and the Poetics of Ritual'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; The subjects of the ''rithā’'' are (almost) invariably dead male warriors (''fursān'') and lords (''sādah''), predominantly those who fell in battle.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne Pinckney Stetkevych, ''The Mute Immortals Speak: Pre-Islamic Poetry and the Poetics of Ritual'' (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1993), p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre is prominent in the corpus of the earliest surviving Arabic poetry; it 'provides some of the most moving examples of the poetic voice, as in the poems of [[al-Khansā']] (d. ca. 644) for her brother, Ṣakhr, killed in tribal combat':&lt;ref&gt;R. M. A. Allen, 'Arabic Poetry', in ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', edited by Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, and Paul Rouzer 4th edn (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012), pp. 65-72 (p. 66).&lt;/ref&gt;

::keeping vigil, as if my eyes had

:Saying, 'Sakhr is dwelling there in a

Allen, 'Arabic Poetry', in ''The Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics'', edited by Stephen Cushman, Clare Cavanagh, Jahan Ramazani, and Paul Rouzer 4th edn (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2012), pp. 65-72 (p. 66).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside al-Khansā', major female exponents of the ''rithā’'' poems of whose survive include the pre-Islamic [[Janūb Ukht ‘Amr dhī-l-Kalb]], [[Laylā al-Akhyaliyya]] (d. 706 CE), and [[Laylā bint Ṭarīf]] (d. 815 CE).

'''Romano-British culture''' is the culture that arose in Britain under the [[Roman Empire]] following the [[Roman conquest of Britain|Roman conquest]] in AD 43 and the creation of the [[Roman Britain|province of Britannia]]. It arose as a fusion of the imported [[Roman culture]] with that of the indigenous [[Britons (historical)|Britons]], a people of [[Celts|Celtic]] language and custom. It survived the 5th century [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], eventually finding itself a stronghold in Wales where it was to form the basis of an emerging [[Welsh culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.41.9 | issue=41 | title=Romano-British Pottery in the Fifth Century | year=2016 | journal=Internet Archaeology | author=Gerrard James, University Newcastle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as [[Christopher Snyder]] believe that during the 5th and 6th centuries – approximately from 410 when the Roman legions withdrew, to 597 when St [[Augustine of Canterbury]] arrived – southern Britain preserved an active [[Sub-Roman Britain|sub-Roman]] culture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.11141/ia.3.2 | issue=3 | title=A gazetteer of Sub-Roman Britain (AD 400-600): The British sites | year=1997 | journal=Internet Archaeology | author=Snyder Christopher A., University Marymount, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; that survived the attacks from the [[Anglo-Saxons]] and even used a vernacular Latin when writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-orb.net/encyclop/early/origins/rom_celt/romessay.html Sub-Roman Britain].

==Arrival of the Romans==
[[File:All Roman coins 1997 - 2010 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Roman coins findings clearly indicate the areas of biggest "cultural romanisation" and presence in Roman Britain]]

Roman troops, mainly from nearby provinces, invaded the Brythonic Celtic land in AD 43, in what is now part of England, during the reign of Emperor [[Claudius]]. Over the next few years the province of [[Britannia]] was formed, eventually including the whole of what later became England and [[Wales]] and parts of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name="awh"&gt;Kinder, H. &amp; Hilgemann W. ''The Penguin Atlas of World History'', Penguin Books, London 1978, {{ISBN|0-14-051054-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of Roman businessmen and officials and their families settled in Britannia. Roman troops from across the Empire, as far as Spain, [[Syria]], [[Egypt]], and the [[Germania|Germanic]] provinces of [[Batavia (region)|Batavia]] and [[Frisia]] (modern [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], and the [[Rhineland]] area of Germany), were garrisoned in Roman towns, and many married local Britons. The [[Roman army]] and their families and dependents amounted to 125,000 people, out of Britannia's total population of 3.6 million at the end of the fourth century.&lt;ref name="alcock"&gt;[[Joan P Alcock|Joan P. Alcock]], [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t7KeBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT260 ''A Brief History of Roman Britain'', page 260], [[Hachette UK]]&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many migrants of other professions, such as sculptors from [[Roman Syria]] and doctors from the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] region.&lt;ref name="shotter"&gt;David Shotter (2012), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Hw98CvXwRoUC&amp;pg=PT37 ''Roman Britain'', page 37], [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; This diversified Britannia's cultures and religions, while the populace remained mainly Celtic, with a Roman way of life.

The bulk of the population was rural; from a total population of 3.6 million at the end of the fourth century, the urban population was about 240,000 people,&lt;ref name="alcock"/&gt; with the capital city of [[Londinium]] having about 60,000 people.&lt;ref name="Durant2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Will Durant|title=Caesar and Christ: The Story of Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JztghD__8ksC&amp;pg=PT468#v=onepage&amp;q=londinium&amp;f=false|date=7 June 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4516-4760-0|pages=468–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=London Civic Theatre: City Drama and Pageantry from Roman Times to 1558 |author=Anne Lancashire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QajvxgbH59QC&amp;pg=PA19 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |page=19 |isbn=978-0-5216-3278-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Londonium was an ethnically diverse city with inhabitants from across the Roman Empire, including natives of Britannia, [[continental Europe]], the [[Middle East]], and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-34809804 DNA study finds London was ethnically diverse from start], [[BBC]], 23 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; There was also cultural diversity in other Roman-British towns, which were sustained by considerable migration, both within Britannia and from other Roman territories, including North Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[[Ray Laurence]] (2012), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dlq6pZaTS_UC&amp;pg=PA121 ''Roman Archaeology for Historians'', page 121], [[Routledge]]&lt;/ref&gt; Syria, the Eastern Mediterranean, and continental Europe.&lt;ref name="shotter"/&gt;

Later, Britain was independent of the rest of the Roman Empire for a number of years, first as part of the [[Gallic Empire]], then 20 years later under the usurpers [[Carausius]] and [[Allectus]].

Christianity came to Britain in the 3rd century. One early figure was [[Saint Alban]], who (according to tradition) was martyred near the Roman town of [[Verulamium]], on the site of the modern St Albans, during the reign of Emperor [[Trajan Decius|Decius]].

===Roman citizenship===
One aspect of Roman influence seen in British life was the grant of [[Roman citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanempire.net/romepage/Citizenship/Roman_Citizenship.htm Roman Citizenship]. Romanempire.net.&lt;/ref&gt; At first this was granted very selectively: to the council members of certain classes of towns, whom Roman practice made citizens; to veterans, either [[Roman legion|legionaries]] or soldiers in [[Roman auxiliaries in Britain|auxiliary units]]; and to a number of natives whose [[patron]]s obtained citizenship for them. Some of the local Brittonic kings, such as [[Tiberius Claudius Cogidubnus|Togidubnus]], received citizenship in this manner. The number of citizens steadily increased, as people inherited citizenship and more grants were made. Eventually in 212, everybody except slaves and [[freed slaves]] were granted citizenship by the ''[[Constitutio Antoniniana]]''.

The other inhabitants of Britain, who did not enjoy citizenship, the ''[[Peregrinus (Roman)|Peregrini]]'', continued to live under the laws of their ancestors. The principal handicaps were that they could not own land with a Latin title, serve as a [[legionary]] in the army (although they could serve in an auxiliary unit, and become a Roman citizen upon discharge), or, in general, [[will (law)|inherit]] from a Roman citizen. But for the majority of British inhabitants, who were peasants tied to the soil, citizenship would not dramatically alter their daily lives.

==Roman departure from Britain==
{{main|End of Roman rule in Britain}}
Britannia became one of the most loyal provinces of the Empire until its decline, when Britannia's manpower was diverted by civil wars. Eventually [[Honorius (emperor)|emperor Honorius]] ordered Roman troops back home to help fight the invading hordes. [[Constantine III (western emperor)|Constantine III]] initially rebelled against Honorius and took further troops to [[Gaul]], but was later recognised as a joint emperor.

After the Roman departure from Britain, the Romano-British were commanded by Honorius to "look to their own defences". A written plea to General [[Flavius Aëtius]], known as the ''[[Groans of the Britons]]'', may have brought some brief naval assistance from the fading Roman Empire of the West, but otherwise they were on their own.

==Post-Roman period==
{{main|Sub-Roman Britain}}
[[Image:Britonia6hcentury.png|thumb|right|[[Britons (historical)|British]] settlements in the 6th century]]

In the early stages the lowlands and cities may have had some organisation or "council" and the [[Bishop of London]] appears to have played a key role, but they were divided politically as former soldiers, mercenaries, nobles, officials and farmers declared themselves kings, fighting amongst each other and leaving Britain open to invasion. Two factions may have emerged: a pro-Roman faction and an independence faction. The one leader at this time known by name is [[Vortigern]], who may have held the title of "High King". The depredations of the [[Picts]] from the north and [[Scoti|Scotti]] (Scots) from Ireland forced the Britons to seek help from pagan [[Anglo-Saxons|Germanic tribes]] of Angles, Saxons and Jutes, who then decided to settle in Britain. Some of the Romano-British people migrated to [[Brittany]], the [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] and possibly Ireland.

The Anglo-Saxons obtained control of eastern England in the 5th century. In the mid-6th century they started expanding into the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], then in the 7th century they expanded again into the south-west and the north of England. The unconquered parts of southern Britain, notably [[Wales]], retained their Romano-British culture, in particular retaining Christianity.

Some Anglo-Saxon histories (in context) refer to the Romano-British people by the blanket term "Welsh". The term Welsh is derived from an [[Old English]] [[Walhaz|word meaning 'foreigner']], referring to the old inhabitants of southern Britain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/articles/welsh.htm Balderdash and flummery]. World Wide Words (23 November 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Wales and the south-western peninsula were known respectively as North Wales and West Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A10686710 h2g2 – Maps of Cornwall (Kernow) showing a Celtic or Distinct Identity]. Bbc.co.uk.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtic north of England and southern Scotland was referred to in Welsh as [[Hen Ogledd]] ("old north").

The struggles of this period have given rise to the legends of [[Uther Pendragon]] and [[King Arthur]]. There are many theories, but it is sometimes said that [[Ambrosius Aurelianus]], the leader of the Romano-British forces, was the model for the former, and that Arthur's court of [[Camelot]] is an idealised Welsh and [[Cornwall|Cornish]] memory of pre-Saxon Romano-British civilisation.

'''Russian School Defense Staff''' or '''Headquarters for the Protection of Russian Schools''' ({{lang-ru|Штаб защиты русских школ}}; {{lang-lv|Krievu skolu aizstāvības štābs}}) — movement in [[Latvia]] for protection of public secondary education in Russian. Leaders: [[Vladimir Buzayev]], [[Gennady Kotov]], [[Yury Petropavlovsky]], [[Miroslav Mitrofanov]], [[Mihail Tyasin]], [[Viktor Dergunov]], [[Vladislav Rafalsky]], for some time also [[Alexander Yuryevich Kazakov|Alexander Kazakov]] (deported out of Latvia in 2004), one of the most prominent spokesmen — [[Yakov Pliner]].&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

==Aims of the movement==
Cancelling the Education law provisions, which originally ordered the language of instruction in public secondary schools (Forms 10-12) to be only Latvian (later - at least 60% Latvian) since 2004. It also supports providing effective learning of Latvian language in the Latvian language and literature lessons and specific preparation of teachers for Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shtab.lv/main.php?w2=about Штаб защиты русских школ, официальный сайт&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Staff was founded&lt;ref&gt;Заявление о создании штаба по защите русских школ. Published in: "Ракурс" No. 1/2003 The text of the founding statement is available [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/party/istorija/18988-/ online {{ru icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; in April 2003 as a coalition of various organizations, most prominent being [[ForHRUL]], and later expanded, involving nonpartisan people. In 2003–2004, the Staff has organized political demonstrations (according to the [[Freedom House]] and political scientist T. Boguševiča, the biggest ones in Latvia since the beginning of the 1990s) to protest to expanding use of Latvian language in Russian schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/rwmain?page=search&amp;docid=473c550523 Freedom in the World 2005. Latvia] [[Freedom House]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Boguševiča T.''

As a result, the Education law was amended in February 2004, allowing to teach up to 40% in the forms 10-12 in minority languages. The proportion of teaching 60% of subjects in Latvian and 40% in Russian, according to BISS research, was supported by 20% of the teachers, 15% of pupils and 13% of parents in minority schools and most stated that they would rather support bilingual instruction in all subjects; only 15% of teachers thought that no reform was needed, while this opinion was expressed by 36% of parents and 44% of pupils.&lt;ref&gt;[http://providus.lv/article_files/1091/original/cittaut.pdf?1326906351 Cittautiešu jauniešu integrācija Latvijas sabiedrībā izglītības reformas kontekstā.

Baltijas Sociālo zinātņu institūts, 2004 — 79. lpp.]&lt;/ref&gt; The parliamentary opposition started two cases before the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia]] (abjudicated in May and September, 2005) with most of its demands being refused.

The '''Sentani languages''' form a [[language family]] of coastal Indonesian Papua near the Papua New Guinea border.  Sentani had been a branch of [[Stephen Wurm]]'s proposal for [[Trans–New Guinea]].  The languages have lexical similarities with the [[Asmat–Kamoro languages]], but Ross (2005) does not believe these demonstrate a genealogical relationship, and proposes instead that they are related to the [[East Bird's Head languages]].

The Sentani family is not accepted by [[Søren Wichmann]] (2013), who splits it into two separate groups.&lt;ref name="Wichmann2013"&gt;Wichmann, Søren. 2013.

The '''Swiss Art Awards,''' also named the '''Federal Art Competition''', are recognitions that are awarded by the [[Federal Office of Culture]] (FOC) in the name of the [[Swiss|Confederation]].

==History==

In March 2010, [[professional wrestling]] promotion [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) moved their weekly television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', from airing on Thursdays to airing Monday nights. In doing so, TNA placed ''Impact!'' in direct competition with [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s (WWE) flagship program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. It drew comparisons to the [[Monday Night Wars]], in which defunct wrestling promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) program ''[[WCW Nitro|Nitro]]'' went head-to-head with ''Raw'' in a battle for higher [[Nielsen ratings]] each week from 1995 to 2001; this led ''Impact!''{{'}}s move to sometimes be called "The New Monday Night Wars". The move was spurred by the signing of [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Eric Bischoff]], two central figures of the original Monday Night War. Unlike the ratings battle with WCW, TNA never gained traction against WWE, despite initially setting record high ratings for ''Impact!''. ''Impact!'' returned to its Thursday night timeslot after declining ratings in May, less than two months after the move.

==Background and first Monday ''Impact!''==
On October 27, 2009, [[Hulk Hogan]] announced that he and [[Eric Bischoff]] had signed with [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) in a press conference held at [[Madison Square Garden]]. TNA President [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]] stated "Our goal is to become the world's biggest professional wrestling company. Hulk defines professional wrestling and we look forward to partnering with him in a variety of ways as we continue to grow TNA globally."&lt;ref name="signs"&gt;{{cite web |author=Matt Fowler |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/28/hulk-hogan-signs-with-tna |title=Hulk Hogan Signs With TNA |publisher=[[IGN]] |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=October 28, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028202018/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/10/28/hulk-hogan-signs-with-tna |archivedate=October 28, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hulk Hogan July 2010.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Hulk Hogan joined TNA in late 2009]]
During an appearance on [[Paramount Network|Spike]]'s presentation of ''[[The Ultimate Fighter: Heavyweights Finale]]'' on December 5, Hogan announced that ''[[TNA Impact!|Impact!]]'', which normally aired on Thursdays, would go head to head with [[World Wrestling Entertainment]]'s (WWE) ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' on Monday January 4 in a three-hour live broadcast on Spike.&lt;ref name="TheSun"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2760057/Hulk-Hogan-to-make-TNA-debut-live-on-Monday-January-4-up-against-Raw.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022331/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/sport/wrestling/2760057/Hulk-Hogan-to-make-TNA-debut-live-on-Monday-January-4-up-against-Raw.html|archivedate=December 9, 2009|deadurl=yes|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|first=Simon|last=Rothstein|title=Monday Night Wars to return|date=December 6, 2009|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hogan was a top talent in [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), which Bischoff was an executive of, when the company debuted a program in 1995, ''[[WCW Nitro|Nitro]]'', to compete with ''Raw'' in a ratings battle called the [[Monday Night Wars]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/hulk-hogan-nwo-monday-night-wars|title=Hulk Hogan 'prayed to God' the WWE wouldn't lose the Monday Night War|work=[[USA Today]]|last=Schwartz|first=Nick|date=August 26, 2014|accessdate=October 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107003855/http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/08/hulk-hogan-nwo-monday-night-wars|archivedate=November 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The January 4 show would be the first time since ''Nitro''{{'}}s last episode in March 2001 that two major wrestling promotions would go head-to-head in a Monday night ratings competition.&lt;ref name="TheSun"/&gt; 

WWE countered by announcing the return of Bret Hart, who had not appeared in WWE since the [[Montreal Screwjob]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/16/bret-hart-signs-with-the-wwe|title=Bret Hart Signs With WWE|publisher=IGN|last=Fowler|first=Matt|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=October 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028201840/http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/16/bret-hart-signs-with-the-wwe|archivedate=October 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leading up to the show, TNA President Dixie Carter stated that while Spike was not expecting ''Impact!'' to beat ''Raw'' in the ratings, it would be considered a success if they managed to at least maintain their usual Thursday night ''Impact!'' rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwnewsnow.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1262665575&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210115821/http://www.pwnewsnow.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1262665575&amp;archive=&amp;start_from=&amp;ucat=6|title=TNA's Dixie Carter Says SpikeTV Not Expecting Big Ratings for Live Impact|work=Pwnewsnow.com|date=January 4, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2012|archivedate=January 4, 2010|last=Michaels|first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spike president [[Kevin Kay]] also announced there were plans to air ''Impact!'' on Mondays quarterly through 2010 and added that if the ratings proved successful on January 4, it could be moved to Monday nights permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/TNA/article1009364.shtml|title=TNA Impact to air more frequently on Monday nights, Spike TV executive says he's not opposed to moving the show permanently|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|last=Powell|first=Jason|date=December 19, 2009|accessdate=October 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028201138/https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/TNA/article1009364.shtml|archivedate=October 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By signing with TNA, Bischoff and Hogan were paired with writer [[Vince Russo]], whom they had conflicted with in WCW and had not worked with since they departed the company after [[Bash At The Beach 2000#2000|Bash at the Beach 2000]]. According to Russo, the three met together and worked out their differences before the January 4 show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/InterviewHighlights/article10010103.shtml|title=Vince Russo says Vince McMahon made a mistake when he promoted Stephanie McMahon to head of WWE creative, comments on his working relationships with Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|date=February 3, 2010|accessdate=November 4, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107012302/https://prowrestling.net/artman/publish/InterviewHighlights/article10010103.shtml|archivedate=November 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings showed that ''Raw'' came out on top, averaging 5.6 million viewers while ''Impact!'' averaged 2.2 million viewers. The show peaked with three million viewers for the Hulk Hogan segment but then the viewership declined towards the end of the show to near 2.2 million viewers, the replay on January 7, 2010, garnered a 0.9 rating thus giving TNA a combined viewership range of 3.5–4.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Paul Nemer |url=http://www.wrestleview.com/tna-news/2407-rating-for-1-7-tna-impact-replay/ |title=Rating for 1/7 TNA Impact replay – Wrestling News and Results, WWE News, TNA News, ROH News |website=WrestleView |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 2, 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026022305/http://www.wrestleview.com/tna-news/2407-rating-for-1-7-tna-impact-replay/ |archivedate=October 26, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2010/01/ratings_news_for_mondays_raw_tna_impact.html|title=Ring Posts: Ratings news for Monday’s Raw, TNA Impact|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|last=Eck|first=Kevin|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109095218/http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/wrestling/blog/2010/01/ratings_news_for_mondays_raw_tna_impact.html|deadurl=yes|archivedate=January 9, 2010|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite not beating ''Raw'' in the ratings, TNA managed to set a new record for ''Impact!'', beating the previous one of 1.97 million viewers, and thus gaining the confidence of Spike representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_37908.shtml|title=TNA News: Ratings are in for last night's Impact – TNA draws highest audience ever, huge quarter-hour for Hulk Hogan|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|first=James|last=Caldwell|date=January 5, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028145456/https://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_37908.shtml|archivedate=October 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Move to Mondays==
[[File:Eric Bischoff 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Bischoff at a TNA event in July 2010]]
On March 8, 2010, ''Impact!'' moved to Monday nights at 9&amp;nbsp;pm EST to compete head-to-head with ''Raw''. Eric Bischoff was once again competing on the opposite side of Vince McMahon's WWE and in an interview with Bubba the Love Sponge, he said that he believed "history is repeating itself".&lt;ref name="WV0214"/&gt; This new "war" began in much the same way as the original did; with TNA relying on established wrestlers, including former WWE talent, and with the company being led by Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff.

[[File:Dixie Carter on the mic.jpg|thumb|TNA President [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]] in 2010]]
In a press release, Spike TV's Senior Vice President of Sports and Specials, Brian J. Diamond, said: "The fans have spoken and with their input we have determined the best time slot to maximize the TNA audience is on Thursday nights where we are confident it will be among the most-watched shows with young men". In the same announcement, TNA president [[Dixie Carter (wrestling)|Dixie Carter]] was quoted as saying, "Our fans made it clear that they preferred the Thursday night time period. By moving to Thursdays, this is a win/win opportunity for both TNA and the fans. We are looking forward to delivering what the fans are asking for."&lt;ref name=return/&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' described the move as one of many gambles TNA has taken during their history, but wrote that it "turned out disastrously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-renaissance-of-tna-wrestling-and-why-it-might-be-doomed-anyway|title=The Renaissance of TNA Wrestling and Why It Might Be Doomed Anyway|work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=September 23, 2014|accessdate=February 25, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226133005/https://sports.vice.com/en_us/article/the-renaissance-of-tna-wrestling-and-why-it-might-be-doomed-anyway|archivedate=February 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Impact!'' ratings dropped seven percent from 2009's 1.14 average, finishing 2010 at 1.06. ''WrestleView'' ascribed the drop to the "disastrous decision" to run opposite ''Raw''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/tna-news/20306-tna-impact-average-rating-down-in-2010/|title=TNA Impact average rating down in 2010|work=WrestleView|last=Nemer|first=Paul|date=January 17, 2011|accessdate=October 30, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030714/http://www.wrestleview.com/tna-news/20306-tna-impact-average-rating-down-in-2010/|archivedate=November 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the move failed to boost ratings for TNA, James Caldwell of ''Pro Wrestling Torch'' attributed a six percent drop in ''Raw'' ratings (from 3.69 to 3.47) to competition from ''Impact!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_40999.shtml|title=WWE News: Raw TV ratings 2010 vs. 2009 comparison – Analysis of ratings through first four months, TNA Impact's effect|work=Pro Wrestling Torch|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=October 28, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171028145316/https://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/WWE_News_3/article_40999.shtml|archivedate=October 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2010, the "New Monday Night Wars" received the annual [[WrestleCrap]] [[Gooker Award]], which honors the worst events in wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/inductions/the-new-monday-night-wars-2010-gooker-award-winner/ |title=The New Monday Night Wars: 2010 Gooker Award Winner |last=Reynolds |first=R.D. |publisher=[[WrestleCrap]]|date=October 5, 2016|accessdate=February 24, 2017 |authorlink=R.D.

By July 2011, nearly all of the new talents brought in for ''Impact!''{{'}}s initial Monday launch had left the company, with the exceptions of [[Ric Flair]] (who left the following year) and [[Jeff Hardy]] (who left in 2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59773/orlando-jordantna-update.html?p=1|title=Orlando Jordan-TNA Update|work=Pro Wrestling Insider|last=Johnson|first=Mike|date=July 12, 2011|accessdate=February 25, 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170226131616/http://www.pwinsider.com/article/59773/orlando-jordantna-update.html?p=1|archivedate=February 26, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulk Hogan departed TNA in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/Hulk-Hogan-no-longer-under-contract-with-TNA-Wrestling.html|title=Hulk Hogan no longer under contract with TNA Wrestling|last=Johnson|first=Vaughn|work=[[Philly.com]]|date=October 2, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721155925/http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/the-squared-circle/Hulk-Hogan-no-longer-under-contract-with-TNA-Wrestling.html|archivedate=July 21, 2015|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Bischoff was sent home from TNA in October 2013 and his contract expired in early 2014.

In the tenth anniversary reprint of [[R.D. Reynolds]] and [[Brian Alvarez]]'s ''Death of WCW'', the authors compared the move to the original Monday Night Wars. They wrote that TNA did not have the audience that WCW did when they moved to initiate the Monday Night Wars, pointing out that ''[[WCW Saturday Night]]'' typically did better than WWE shows did in the weekend timeslots. Reynolds and Alvarez also wrote that TNA did not have the financial resources that WCW did and that WWE was not "asleep at the wheel" as they were in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1= R.D. |first2=Bryan |last1= Reynolds |last2=Alvarez |year= 2014 |title= The Death of WCW: 10th Anniversary Edition of the Bestselling Classic — Revised and Expanded |publisher= ECW Press |isbn= 978-1770411753|authorlink1=R.D.

'''''The Acid House''''' is a 1998 British film adaptation of [[Irvine Welsh]]'s [[short story]] collection ''[[The Acid House]]''. Welsh himself wrote the [[screenplay]], and appears as a minor character in the film. It is directed by [[Paul McGuigan (filmmaker)|Paul McGuigan]].

==Plot==

The film dramatises three stories from the book:
* "The Granton Star Cause": A comedy, in which Boab is having a very bad day indeed. His parents throw him out so they can indulge in [[sado-masochism]] and he is sacked from his job, dumped by his girlfriend and dropped from his [[football (soccer)|football]] team. It has elements of [[Franz Kafka]]'s ''[[The Metamorphosis]]''. One of the characters is a pitiless and profane God, who transforms him into a fly as punishment for wasting his life. Named after an Edinburgh housing district, "The Granton Star Cause" was filmed on location in the area as well as nearby West Pilton, including Ferry Road Drive.
* "A Soft Touch": [[Kevin McKidd]] plays a cuckolded husband while [[Gary McCormack]] is Larry, the ruthless upstairs neighbour who steals his electricity and his wife, played by [[Michelle Gomez]].
* "The Acid House": An [[LSD|acid]] trip and a bolt of [[lightning]] result in amiable schemie Coco Brice exchanging bodies with the baby of a [[middle class|middle-class]] couple.

All three sections are independent, but are linked by setting and by the reappearance of incidental characters, in particular [[Maurice Roëves]] who appears variously as an inebriated wedding guest, a figure in a dream, and a pub patron. All three of his parts symbolise a human manifestation of God.

The film offended elements of the UK tabloid press with a depiction of a cynical and jaded, foul-mouthed God. In some English-speaking countries (such as Canada and the United States) it has been screened with subtitles because of the heavy [[Edinburgh]] accents.

[[File:The Four and Twenty Elders (William Blake).jpg|thumb|''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne'', c. 1803–5. [[William Blake]], [[Tate]]. 354 x 293 mm.]]

'''''The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne''''' is a pencil drawing and [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]] on paper by the English [[English poetry|poet]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[printmaker]] [[William Blake]]. Created circa 1803–1805, the drawing has been held in London's [[Tate]] gallery since 1949. It is likely a visionary and hallucinatory summary of scenes from Chapters 4 and 5&lt;ref&gt;Although some imagery from Chapter 6 is also described in this work,&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Book of Revelation]] when the throne of God was presented to the prophet [[John of Patmos|Saint John the Divine]].&lt;ref name="Fuseli"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/britain/exhibitions/gothicnightmares/rooms/room7.htm Fuseli, Blake and the Romantic Imagination]. [[Tate]], 2006. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint John described the scene,
:before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal... round about... were four beasts full of eyes... The four and twenty elders fall down before him... and worship him that liveth for ever and ever.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?workid=1149&amp;tabview=work The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Description].

Blake's depiction was created as part of a commission of biblical watercolours for his friend and patron&lt;ref&gt;Ingram, Allan. "Patterns of Madness in the Eighteenth Century". Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, 1998. 216. {{ISBN|0-85323-992-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Butts. The artist began to work on Butts's series around 1800. For stylistic reasons—including the use of pencil instead of pen and ink—it is generally believed by scholars that Blake began work on the piece sometime in 1803.&lt;ref&gt;'It is listed in Blake's account with Thomas Butts of 3 March 1806, apparently as having been delivered on 12 May 1805'. From the Tate catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings and drawings from the series are typically characterised by intense displays of colour and ''The [[Four and Twenty Elders]]'' is generally held as one of the most vivid examples of Blake's output from the period.&lt;ref name="MY109"&gt;Myrone, 109&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sketch for The Four and Twenty Elders (Blake).jpg|150px|left|thumb|Blake's ''Sketch for The Four and Twenty Elders'' (pencil on paper, 488 x 389 mm), although loosely drawn, anticipates the symmetrical architecture of the finished piece.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=1067&amp;searchid=9041&amp;tabview=work Sketch for 'The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne']". Tate. Retrieved on November 05, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In this watercolour, Blake arranges the various elements and characters from the biblical text in a highly symmetrical and organised manner. God is pictured sitting on his throne at the center of the panel and portrayed as an ancient figure with a long and broad white beard, dressed in red clothing. The Deity holds a book or scroll in his right hand, according to scripture, "written within and on the backside, sealed with [[seven seals]]',&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 5.1&lt;/ref&gt; while his left hand is raised in a gesture of [[benediction]] and blessing.&lt;ref name="R68"&gt;Robertson, 68&lt;/ref&gt; His throne is enclosed by a rainbow which radiates from below a pointed [[Gothic architecture|Gothic arch]] formed from the wings of angels.&lt;ref name="MY109" /&gt; Before the throne is a slain lamb, "having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the [[seven Spirits of God]] sent forth into all the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 5.6&lt;/ref&gt; The lamb's seven horns are represented by seven spikes fanned above his corpse, while the seven [[cherub]]ic heads beneath him allude to the "seven Spirits of God". Each cherub is crowned by a tongued flame, a reference to the "seven lamps of fire" described in Revelation 4.5.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt;

In Revelation, Saint John wrote,
:And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment: and they had on their heads crowns of gold.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt;

A row of twelve white-clad bearded figures float on either side of the Deity, although only four figures from each row are visible to the viewer of the panel. Each figure bends towards God, in adoration, to lay a golden crown at his feet.&lt;ref name="R68" /&gt; Above the head of God are the Four Beasts, "full of eyes before and behind".&lt;ref name="Fuseli" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Revelation 4.6&lt;/ref&gt; Above and to the left of God perches the Eagle, opposite of whom is the Lion. Both are portrayed with the pallor of death and both are situated beneath the distorted heads of monstrous birds and animals. The Ox and Angel are positioned behind the throne and peer outwards, according to the Blake collector W. Graham Robertson, "dimly [and] half hidden in the pale crimson and violet rays which emanate from the central figure, and shoot up to meet and be absorbed in the {{sic|?|hide=y|over-|arching}} rainbow."&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, 69&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many uses of numerical symbolism in ''The Four and Twenty Elders'', and according to the Blake scholar [[Martin Myrone]], "the way, as with [Blake's] ''[[Ezekiel's Wheels]]'', that multiples and unities meld into one another, underpinned Blakes own poetic conceptions."&lt;ref name="MY109" /&gt;

The painting was first passed to Butts and upon his death was bequeathed to his son. In 1906, it passed to W. Graham Robertson for £6,720. Following Robertson's passing, the panel was sold at auction at [[Christie's]] to the Tate in 1949, with financial assistance from the [[The Art Fund|National Art Collections Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=-1&amp;workid=1149&amp;searchid=false&amp;roomid=false&amp;tabview=text&amp;texttype=8 The Four and Twenty Elders Casting their Crowns before the Divine Throne: Catalogue].

'''The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship''' was founded by the [[Stuckism|Stuckist]] painter [[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] on September 2004, as the first, and currently the only, Greek group of [[Stuckism|Stuckism International]]. It has an international membership.

==History==
[[Odysseus Yakoumakis]] discovered Stuckism in July, 2004, while surfing the net, and saw in it an antidote to what he deems "the ailments of the contemporary Greek 'artscape'".&lt;ref&gt;This issue is taken up in Yakoumis' article, "The Academic Provincialism of contemporary Greek Art and its proposed Stuckist remedy", to be presented by him at the first Stuckist international symposium [http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html ''The Triumph of Stuckism''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060414172054/http://www.student.livjm.ac.uk/lsaiwyli/TheTriumphOfStuckism/index.html |date=2006-04-14 }} in Liverpool, England&lt;/ref&gt; He contacted [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], the London founder of Stuckism, and a few days later founded The Romantic Anonymous Fellowship. He conceived this as a "Greek version of Stuckism, an antidote to contemporary Greek art's [[Parochialism|provincialism]], [[sectarianism]] and servile importation of [[post-modernism]]". He developed the concept of "Romantic Stuckism", that is of "Stuckism with a good injection of [[Eleatic]] and [[Platonic philosophy]], oriented rather towards encouraging each artist to pursue his/her genuinely personal artistic vision rather, than towards pointless polemics against the reactionary official art-establishment". He published the first two Romantic Stuckist theoretical texts on the Fellowship's website.

At that stage he was the Fellowship's only fellow and, as far as he knew, the only artist in Greece aware of the Stuckist movement. He contacted other fine artists in Athens, but described the reactions he got as "ranging from a tepid 'academic curiosity' to a sheer lack of interest or even, occasionally, to a politely concealed hostility."  He was however contacted by artists from overseas and accepted them into the Fellowship. The first to apply was [http://www.ianjburkett.co.uk/ Ian J. Burkett], a painter living in London and founder of the Ealing Stuckists group. Shortly after, followed the painter and etcher [http://www.ilaniaabileah.com/ Ilania Abileah] from Canada, and the painter and etcher [http://www.artworksbyanthe.com/ Anthe] (who is of Greek descent) from the US.

==Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity==
Yakoumakis determined that Stuckism should, nevertheless, be brought "in the flesh" before the eyes of the Greek fine arts community, and organised the first Stuckist event in Greece, titled ''Under the Cover of Romantic Anonymity'', announced for May 14 of 2010 at the Ash-In-Art Gallery, Athens, Greece.

In parallel with the show, the new book by Odysseus Yakoumakis will be featured, titled "Leaflets from the Wilderness (a case study about the artscape in nouveau-Greece and many other lands)" (Ash-In-Art Publications).

Stuckist artists taking part include:

'''''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra''''' is a 1945 musical composition by [[Benjamin Britten]] with a subtitle '''''Variations and [[Fugue]] on a Theme of [[Henry Purcell|Purcell]]'''''. It was based on the second movement, "Rondeau", of the ''[[Abdelazer]]'' suite. It was originally commissioned for the British educational documentary film called ''Instruments of the Orchestra'' released on 29 November 1946, directed by [[Muir Mathieson]] and featuring the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] conducted by [[Malcolm Sargent]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2b69f17167 "Instruments of the Orchestra"], British Film Institute, accessed 24 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Sargent also conducted the concert première on 15 October 1946 with the [[Royal Liverpool Philharmonic]] in the [[Philharmonic Hall, Liverpool]], England.

The work is one of the best-known pieces by the composer, and is often associated with two other works in the context of children's [[music education]]: [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]' ''[[The Carnival of the Animals]]'' and [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s ''[[Peter and the Wolf]]''.{{citation needed|date = November 2013}}

This work, in the composer's own words, "is affectionately inscribed to the children of [[John Redcliffe-Maud, Baron Redcliffe-Maud|John]] and [[Jean Redcliffe-Maud|Jean Maud]]: [[Humphrey Maud|Humphrey]], Pamela, Caroline and Virginia, for their edification and entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KX-zz5p-Fp0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Essential Britten: A Pocket Guide for the Britten Centenary"], John Bridcut, accessed 14 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' is scored for symphony orchestra:

*''[[Woodwind instrument|Woodwinds]]'':  [[piccolo]], 2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s, 2 [[oboe]]s, 2 [[clarinet]]s in [[soprano clarinet|B flat and A]] and 2 [[bassoon]]s
*''[[Brass instrument|Brass]]'': 4 [[French horn|horns]] in F, 2 [[trumpet]]s in C, 3 [[trombone]]s (2 [[tenor trombone|tenors]] and 1 [[bass trombone|bass]]) and [[Tuba|bass tuba]]
*''[[Percussion]]'': [[timpani]],  [[bass drum]], [[cymbal]]s,  [[tambourine]],  [[Triangle (musical instrument)|triangle]],  [[snare drum]],  [[cowbell]],  [[xylophone]], [[castanet]]s,  [[Gong|tamtam]], and  [[Whip (percussion)|whip]]
*''[[String instrument|Strings]]'':  [[harp]], first and second [[violin]]s, [[viola]]s, [[cello]]s and [[double bass]]es

==Structure==
The work is based on the [[Rondo|Rondeau]] from [[Henry Purcell]]'s [[incidental music]] to [[Aphra Behn]]'s ''[[Abdelazer]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=18 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060800/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/programme-notes-archive/18-april-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is structured, in accordance with the plan of the original documentary film, as a way of showing off the tone colours and capacities of the various sections of the orchestra.

In the introduction, the theme is initially played by the entire orchestra, then by each major family of instruments of the orchestra: first the woodwinds, then the [[brass instrument|brass]], then the [[string instrument|strings]], and finally by the percussion. Each [[variation (music)|variation]] then features a particular instrument in depth, generally moving through each family from high to low (the order of the families is slightly different from the introduction). So, for example, the first variation features the piccolo and flutes; each member of the woodwind family then gets a variation, ending with the bassoon; and so on, through the strings, brass, and finally the percussion.

After the whole orchestra has been effectively taken to pieces in this way, it is reassembled using an original [[fugue]] which starts with the piccolo, followed by all the woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion in turn. Once everyone has entered, the brass are re-introduced (with a strike on the tamtam) with Purcell's original melody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|accessdate=3 August 2013|publisher=London Chamber Orchestra|title=Programme Notes|date=20 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130804060802/http://www.lco.co.uk/concerts/special-events/20-march-2013-qmul/20-march-2013-programme-notes|archivedate=4 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sections of the piece and instruments introduced by the variations are as follows.

;Theme: Allegro maestoso e largamente

;Fugue: Allegro molto

==Narration==
The narration for the documentary film was written by [[Eric Crozier]], the producer of the first production of Britten's opera ''[[Peter Grimes]]'',  and is sometimes spoken by the conductor or a separate speaker during performance of the piece. The composer also arranged a version without narration. The one without narration is more often recorded. The commentary often alters between recordings.

A new narration was written by Simon Butteriss for the Aldeburgh Festival and broadcast live by CBBC presenter Johny Pitts with the BBC Symphony Orchestra for the Britten 100 celebrations in 2013.

Comedian and author [[John Hodgman]] wrote a new narration of ''The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra'' in 2015 for a series of performances with the [[Boston Pops Orchestra|Boston Pops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wgbh.org/articles/John-Hodgman-in-the-Young-Persons-Guide-10425|title=John Hodgman in the Young Person's Guide: Boston Pops: WCRB: WGBH|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKuU2_Q7zH4|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's Debut Narration with Boston Pops|first=|last=Boston Pops|date=14 May 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/entertainment/music/guestlisted/2015/05/excerpts_from_john_hodgmans_debut_narration_with_boston_pops|title=Excerpts from John Hodgman's debut narration with Boston Pops|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Time Crisis 4''''' is the fourth installment in [[Namco]]'s [[Time Crisis (series)|''Time Crisis'' series]] which introduces new features to the [[Cover system|cover]]-based [[light gun shooter]] gameplay engine of its predecessors alongside a new story and roster of characters. It was initially released as an [[arcade game]] in 2006, and was ported in 2007 for PlayStation 3, with the Guncon 3 [[light gun]] peripheral and features a new [[first-person shooter]] mode.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; It was later re-released as part of ''[[Time Crisis: Razing Storm]]'' with support for the [[PlayStation Move]] controller but without the first-person shooter mode.

==Plot==
The game opens in [[California]], where intelligence officials from both the [[United States Armed Forces]] and the paramilitary V.S.S.E. organization learn about a top secret weapon targeted for terrorists' smuggling and their plot. William Rush infiltrates a pier to gather information, and finds that the enemy has already acquired the insect-like weapons (codenamed "Terror Bite"). After being told by Elizabeth Conway about an information leak incident at the airport, Rush goes to the airport to help VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno and Evan Bernard, who had been sent to stop the weapons trade. After leaving the airport, they head to the city, where they defeat Marcus Black. They discover [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] [[dog tag]]s on each enemy, meaning they are not terrorists. The terrorist faction is then revealed to be the Biological Weapons Special Operations Unit (AKA the Hamlin Battalion).

After Rush escapes from the collapsing dam, he, Giorgio and Evan fly to [[Wyoming]]'s secluded bio-weapons research facility, where after defeating Jack Mathers, they soon learn that the Hamlin Battalion is attacking [[Buckley Air Force Base]] near [[Aurora, Colorado]], prompting the men to rush to the AFB. As Rush, Giorgio, and Evan invade there from the outside, a couple of [[unmanned combat aerial vehicle]]s (UCAVs) depart the base without warning. Rush leads the [[Colorado National Guard]] toward an entrance, while Giorgio and Evan try to take care of the UCAVs. They also encounter V.S.S.E.'s old enemy Wild Dog in the base who, in addition to his standard hand gun, gatling gun and RPG, is now armed with a grappling hook and tractor beam device. After a long battle, Giorgio and Evan defeat him, ending with Wild Dog [[detonator|detonating]] himself once again. Meanwhile, Rush defeats Wild Fang (Wild Dog's younger partner from [[Time Crisis 3|the previous game]]), sending him into the path of a UCAV as it lifts off.

It is revealed that the Terror Bites' creator, Colonel Gregory Barrows ordered the nuclear-armed UCAVs to destroy the United States in a retaliation scheme for the poor treatment he received from the military. After Giorgio and Evan defeated Barrows near the control center, Rush and his unit form a [[human pyramid]] to lift Giorgio and Evan into it to stop the missiles, where the agents press a [[big red button]] on the control computers to self-destruct all nuclear missiles that the UCAVs have already launched.&lt;ref name="ps3.qj.net"/&gt;

==Background==
The game was first shown at E3 2006 prior to its recent final revision arcade release. One major change is the addition of the multi-screen or multi-hiding system, introduced in ''[[Time Crisis: Project Titan]]''. Unlike ''Project Titan'', which players went on the offensive, players are placed on the defensive. In ''Project Titan'', players had to hide and shoot arrows to switch screens. Screen switching has been refined to allow the player to merely point the gun outside the screen to move around. The game also utilizes a new light gun control with [[infrared]] emitters. Prior to this, all Namco light gun games used gun controllers that relied on [[cathode ray]] timing. Because Namco's light guns with cathode ray timing utilized memory chip-to-lens pointing, the arcade cabinet designers had to ensure that the [[Light gun#Infrared emitters|infrared-emitting light gun controllers]] would provide the same accuracy as their cathode ray timing-based gun provided in the past. This delayed the game's release given past accuracy issues with IR light guns. The player can choose to customize gun calibration and/or turn the blowback on or off with a pre-game code explained in the cabinet. The game, like its predecessors is available either in a 29" standard twin cabinet or a 52" deluxe twin. It also includes the multiple weapon system introduced in ''Time Crisis 3'', with the [[pistol]], [[shotgun]], [[machine gun]], and [[grenade launcher]],&lt;ref name="spot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/time-crisis-4-review/1900-6183298/|title=Time Crisis 4 Review|last=Davis|first=Ryan|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=November 21, 2007|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also features new vehicle sections with similar gameplay mechanics to the Sega Arcade/Nintendo Wii shooters Gunblade NY and LA Machineguns. On several occasions, the player is equipped with a machine gun with infinite ammo or a sniper rifle used to shoot the tires on a marauding truck. Several other functions exclusive to the game includes a scene where the player must pull himself from quicksand, several scenes where a certain position must be defended, with the penalty of one life if the position is lost. On multiple occasions, Rush appears onscreen, whether caught in a trap or attacking an enemy as a diversion and care must be taken to avoid shooting him. It also features a voice navigation system that guides players through different situations. Given the voice navigation system, it can be voiced either in Japanese or English. Prior to the game, it was voiced exclusively in English.

===PlayStation 3 release===
The game was released for [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation 3]] exclusively bundled with the [[GunCon|GunCon 3]] light gun peripheral,&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Morcos.  [http://www.jeux-france.com/news20540_time-crisis-4-sur-playstation-3.html "Time Crisis 4 sur PlayStation 3"]. Jeuxfrance.com. June 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; the PlayStation 3 edition features [[480p]] (4:3) and [[720p]] (16:9 widescreen) support and a specially-programmed [[first-person shooter]] mode, which players engage combat similar to a typical FPS game, but with manual gun pointing, aiming, and firing, in addition to the arcade mode.&lt;ref name="GT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/lwpuu1/time-crisis-4-review|publisher=[[GameTrailers]]|title=Time Crisis 4: Review|date=December 19, 2007|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shack"&gt;Remo, Chris, [http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=685 Time Crisis 4 Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207115602/http://www.shacknews.com/featuredarticle.x?id=685 |date=2008-12-07 }}, ''Shack News'', Nov 21st 2007, Accessed Mar 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Players play as Captain William Rush for 5 levels and as VSSE agents Giorgio Bruno or Evan Bernard for 10 levels through the game's "complete mission", complete with arcade footages when playing as Giorgio or Evan.&lt;ref name="ps3.qj.net"&gt;{{cite web|title=More reloaded Time Crisis 4 screenshots|url=http://www.qj.net/qjnet/playstation-3/more-reloaded-time-crisis-4-screenshots.html|work=Quick Jump Gaming Network|publisher=Caputo Media|accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/time-crisis-4-hands-on-with-fps-mode/1100-6178730 |title=Time Crisis 4: Hands-On with FPS Mode |publisher=GameSpot |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2013-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like its predecessors, it featured the Crisis Missions that has some backstories, starring star of Time Crisis characters from previous installments. The game was re-released on the [[PlayStation 3]] as part of ''[[Time Crisis: Razing Storm]]'', released in October 2010, with support of the [[PlayStation Move]] controllers.

One of the main key areas was the Guncon 3 controller included with the game. Chris Remo of [[Shacknews]] stated that it uses "[[Dual analog control|two analog sticks]] for full movement and camera control, with pointer-based aiming on top" and that once "you get accustomed to it, this control actually works just fine, and feels like it could be the basis for its own game. "&lt;ref name="shack"/&gt; According to Miller, however, the controller "feels cheap," with [[analog stick]]s that are "chintzy and hard to use"; referring to the left-hand subgrip which forces the main shooting handgrip to be held with the right hand, Miller claims that the Guncon 3 "hardly accommodates left-handed players."&lt;ref name="GI"/&gt; Ryan Davis of GameSpot expressed that the complexity of the control scheme seems to contradict the pick-up-and-play mentality of the light gun genre.&lt;ref name="spot"/&gt;

The '''treasure guardian''' is a recurring [[motif (narrative)|motif]] in [[folklore]] of a being that guards a treasure. Typically, the hero must overcome the guardian in order to obtain the treasure. In some cases the treasure guardians are non-human beings, although one subtype, known as "treasure ghosts", were deceased humans who had been murdered and buried with the treasure to protect it.&lt;ref name="Huggins 2003"&gt;{{citation |first= Ronald V. |last= Huggins |authorlink= Ronald V.

Some have decried this gender gap, saying that it indicates the absence of potential talent.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt; Though the gender gap as a whole is narrowing, there is still a growing gap with minority women compared to their white counterparts.&lt;ref name="MentorNet 2003"/&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of women in engineering}}
The history of women as designers and builders of machines and structures predates the development of engineering as a trade. Prior to the creation of the term "[[engineer]]" in the 11th century, women had contributed to the technological advancement of societies around the globe, including [[Hypatia]] of Alexandria (350 or 370–415 AD), who is credited with the invention of the [[hydrometer]]. By the 19th century, women who participated in engineering work often had academic training in mathematics or science. [[Ada Lovelace]] was privately schooled in mathematics before beginning her collaboration with [[Charles Babbage]] on his [[analytical engine]] that would earn her the designation of the "first computer programmer." In the early years of the 20th century, greater numbers of women began to be admitted to engineering programs, but they were generally looked upon as anomalies by the men in their departments.

The first University to award an engineering's bachelor's degree for women was [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Elizabeth Bragg was the recipient of a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1876, becoming the first female engineer in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SWE"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Society of Women Engineers Blog|title=History of Women Engineers|url=http://alltogether.swe.org/2016/03/women-in-engineering-history/|website=All Together Society Of Women Engineers|publisher=Society of Women Engineers|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the 19th century, it was very rare for women to earn bachelor's degree in any field because they did not have the opportunity to enroll in universities due to gender disparities. Some universities started to admit women to their colleges by the early 1800s and by the mid-1800s they started to admit them into all academic programs including engineering.&lt;ref name="SWE" /&gt;{{Women in society sidebar}}

The entry of the United States into [[World War II]] created a serious shortage of engineering talent in that country as men were drafted into the armed forces. To address the shortage, initiatives like [[General Electric Corporation|GE]] on-the-job engineering training for women with degrees in mathematics and physics and the [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] Engineering Program among others created new opportunities for women in engineering.  [[Curtiss-Wright Corporation|Curtiss-Wright]] partnered with [[Cornell]], [[Penn State]], [[Purdue]], the [[University of Minnesota]], the [[University of Texas]], [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]], and [[Iowa State University]] to create an engineering curriculum that lasted ten months and focused primarily on aircraft design and production.&lt;ref name="Bix"&gt;Bix, Amy Sue, "'Engineeresses' Invade Campus: Four decades of debate over technical coeducation." ''IEEE Technology and Society Magazine,'' Vol. 19 Nr. 1 (Spring 2000), 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, since the female representation in the engineering field, there were barely public attacks on women. Chiefly, these attacks were kept quiet inside institutions due to the fact that women did not pressure aggressively to shift the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field. Another reason why these “attacks” were kept private is due to how men believed that it was impossible for engineering to stop being a male-dominated field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bix|first1=Amy Sue|title=Girls coming to tech! : a history of American engineering education for women|date=2013|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Mass.|isbn=9780262019545|pages=14–43|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=0&amp;sid=773eea71-2e88-4f93-bd10-b06fb8ced6d5%40sessionmgr103&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=691931&amp;db=nlebk|ref=Girls Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's roles in the workforce, specifically in engineering fields changed greatly during the Post–World War II period. As women started to marry at later ages, have fewer children, divorce more frequently and stopped depending on [[Breadwinner model|male breadwinners]] for economic support, they started to become even more active in the engineering labor force despite the fact that their salaries were less than men's.&lt;ref name="Power Status Stereotypes"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yang|first1=Juemei|title=The impact of power status on gender stereotypes, sexism, and gender discrimination toward women in the workplace and the career identity development of women|date=2016|publisher=The University of North Dakota|location=The University of North Dakota|pages=1–20|accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women also played a crucial role in programming the [[ENIAC]] from its construction during the [[World War II]] period through the next several decades. Originally recruited by the Army in 1943, female ENIAC programmers made considerable advancements in [[Computer programming|programming]] techniques, such as the invention of breakpoints, now a standard debugging tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbate|first1=Janet|title=Recoding Gender: Women's Changing Participation in Computing|url=https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/recoding-gender|publisher=MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the wartime shortage of engineers, women also made inroads in engineering fields due to the gradual increase in public universities admitting female students. For example, [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]] began to admit women engineering students in 1952, while the [[École Polytechnique]] in Paris, a premier French engineering institution, began to admit female students in 1972.

==Factors contributing to lower female participation==
===Gender stereotypes===

[[Stereotype threat]] may contribute to the under-representation of women in engineering. Because engineering is a traditionally male-dominated field, women may be less confident about their abilities, even when performing equally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Ruff|first2=Chloe|last3=Paretti|first3=Marie C.|date=2013|title=The impact of engineering identification and stereotypes on undergraduate women’s achievement and persistence in engineering|journal=Social Psychology of Education An International Journal|last1=Jones|first1=Brett D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a young age, girls do not express the same level of interest in engineering as boys, possibly due in part to [[gender stereotypes]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite paper|last=Hill|first=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christine|last3=St. Rose|first3=Andresse|year=2010|title=Why So Few?: Women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED509653.pdf|publisher=[[AAUW]]|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also significant evidence of the remaining presence of [[implicit bias]] against female engineers, due to the belief that men are mathematically superior and better suited to engineering jobs.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women who persist are able to overcome these difficulties, enabling them to find fulfilling and rewarding experiences in the engineering profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Bilimoria|first2=Diana|last3=Perelli|first3=Sheri|date=2013|title=Why they stay: women persisting in US engineering careers|journal=Career Development International|volume=18.2|pages=139–154|last1=Buse|first1=Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Due to this [[gender bias]], women's choice in entering an engineering field for college is also highly correlated to the background and exposure they have had with [[mathematics]] and other science courses during high school. Most women that do choose to study engineering have significant experience with regarding themselves better at these types of courses and as a result, think they are capable of studying in a male-dominated field.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell" /&gt;

Women's [[self-efficacy]] is also a contributor to the [[gender stereotype]] that plays a role in the underrepresentation of women in engineering.  Women's ability to think critically that they can be successful and perform accomplishments is correlated to the choices they have when choosing a college career. Women that show high self-efficacy personalities are more prone to choose to study in the engineering field. Self-efficacy is also correlated to gender roles because men often present higher self-efficacy than women, which can also be a cause to why when choosing a major, most women opt to not choose the engineering major.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science and Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=167–168|url=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower rates of female students in engineering degree programs===
Over the past few years 40 percent of women are leaving the engineering field, there are many factors leading to why they don't go into engineering because of women being judged about going into a difficult major such as engineering, working in difficult workplace conditions. According to the Society of Women Engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/12/female-engineers_n_5668504.html|title=40 Percent Of Female Engineers Are Leaving The Field. This Might Be Why.|last=Adams|first=Rebecca|date=2014-08-12|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in four female leave the field after a certain age.

Women are under-represented in engineering education programs as in the workforce (see [[Women in engineering#Statistics|Statistics]]). Enrollment and graduation rates of women in post-secondary engineering programs are very important determinants of how many women go on to become engineers. Because undergraduate degrees are acknowledged as the "latest point of standard entry into scientific fields", the under-representation of women in undergraduate programs contributes directly to under-representation in scientific fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Programs for Undergraduate Women in Science and Engineering: Issues, Problems, and Solutions |journal=Gender &amp; Society |first=Mary |last=Fox|first2=Gerhard |last2=Sonnert |first3=Irina |last3=Nikiforova | year=2011| volume=25 | issue=5| page=591 | doi=10.1177/0891243211416809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in the United States, women who hold degrees in science, technology, and engineering fields are less likely than their male counterparts to have jobs in those fields.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

This degree disparity varies across engineering disciplines. Women tend to be more interested in the engineering disciplines that have societal and humane developments, such as agricultural and [[environmental engineering]]. They are therefore well-represented in environmental and [[biomedical engineering]] degree programs, receiving 40-50% of awarded degrees in the U.S. (2014–15), women are far less likely to receive degrees in fields like [[Mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[computer engineering]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yoder|first=Brian L.|year=2015|title=Engineering by the Numbers|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/engineering_by_the_numbers.pdf|journal=|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;

A study made by the [[Harvard Business Review]] discussed the reasons why the rates of women representation in the engineering field are still low. The study discovered that rates of female students in engineering programs are continuous because of the collaboration aspects in the field. The results of the study chiefly determined how women are treated differently in group works in which there are more male than female members and how male members “excluded women from the real engineering work”. Aside from this, women in this study also described how professors treated female students differently “just because they were women”.&lt;ref name="HBR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Silbey|first1=Susan S.|title=Why Do So Many Women Who Study Engineering Leave the Field?|url=https://hbr.org/2016/08/why-do-so-many-women-who-study-engineering-leave-the-field|website=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that fewer women enroll in engineering programs across the nation, the representation of women in STEM-based careers can potentially increase when college and university administrators work on implementing mentoring programs and work-life policies for women. 
Research shows that these rates have a hard time increasing since women are judged as less competent than men to perform supposedly “masculine jobs”.&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

=== Engineering culture ===
[[File:2009 Bay Area Maker Faire - Jeri.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Autodidacticism|Autodidact]] computer chip designer and inventor, [[Jeri Ellsworth]], at the [https://makerfaire.com/bay-area/ Bay Area "Maker Faire"] in 2009.|alt=Jeri Ellsworth]]Another possible reason for lower female participation in engineering fields is the prevalence of values "associated with the male [[gender role]]" in workplace culture.&lt;ref name="franzway" /&gt;  For example, some women in engineering have found it difficult to re-enter the workforce after a period of absence. Because men are less likely to take time off to raise a family, this disproportionately affects women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Evetts|first1=Julia|title=Women and management in engineering: The 'glass ceiling' for|journal=Women in Management Review|date=1993|volume=8.7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Males are also associated with taking leadership roles in the workplace. By holding a position of power over the women, they may create an uncomfortable environment for them. For example, lower pay, more responsibilities, less appreciation as compared to men.

[[Communication]] is also a contributing factor to the divide between men and women in the workplace. A male to male communication is said to be more direct,&lt;ref name=Dutta&gt;Dutta, Debalina1. "Sustaining The Pipeline: Experiences Of International Female Engineers In U.S. Graduate Programs." Journal of Engineering Education 104.3 (2015): 326-344. Education Source.&lt;/ref&gt;
but when a man explains a task to a woman, they tend to talk down, or “dumb down” terms. This comes from the [[stereotype]] that men are more qualified than women for engineering, causing men to treat women as inferiors instead of equals.

Part of the [[Male privilege|male dominance]] in the engineering field is explained by their perception towards engineering itself. A study in 1964 found that both women and men believed that engineering was in fact masculine.&lt;ref name="Blaisdell 2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blaisdell|first1=Stephanie|title=Factors In The Underrepresentation Of Women In Science And Engineering: A Review Of The Literature|journal=Penn State University|date=1994|pages=169–170|ref=https://journals.psu.edu/wepan/article/viewFile/57727/57415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The masculinity dominating engineering majors and fields proves the issues that men themselves believe that they “naturally” excel in fields related to mathematics and sciences while women “naturally” excel in linguistics and liberal arts. In the past few decades, women's representation in the workforce in [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] fields, specifically engineering, has significantly improved. In 1960 women made up around 1% of all the engineers and by the year 2000 women have made up 11% of all engineers.&lt;ref name="Eric"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hill, Ph.D.|first1=Catherine|last2=Corbett|first2=Christiane|last3=St. Rose, Ed.D.|first3=Andresse|title=Why So Few?: Women In Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics|url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED509653|website=ERIC Institute of Education Sciences|publisher=AAUW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several colleges and universities nationwide want to decrease the [[gender pay gap|gender gap]] between men and women in the engineering field by recruiting more women into their programs. The strategies used for recruiting more female undergraduate students are: increasing women's exposure to stem-courses during high school, planting the idea of positivism relating gender from the engineering culture, producing a more female-friendly environment inside and outside the classroom.  These strategies have helped institutions encourage more women to enroll in engineering programs as well as other [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]]-based majors. 
For universities to encourage women to enroll in their [[graduate programs]], institutions have to emphasize the importance of recruiting women, emphasize the importance of STEM education in the undergraduate level, offer financial aid, and develop more efficient methods for recruiting women to their programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia, Committee on Women in Science and Engineering, and National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|date=2006|publisher=National Academic Press|pages=26-26|accessdate=18 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 2008 women [[Mechanical Engineers]] made up 6.7%, [[Electrical engineering|Electrical]] and [[Electronic engineering|Electronics]] made 7.7%, [[Aerospace engineering|Aerospace]] and [[Civil engineering|Civil]] made 10.4%, [[Chemical engineering|Chemical]] made 13.1% and [[Computer engineering|Computer]] and [[Software engineer|Software Engineers]] made up 20.9% of the workforce. These values are even more outnumbered while quantifying the number of women who hold [[doctorates]].&lt;ref name="Eric" /&gt;

The percentage of [[master's degrees]] awarded to women has not changed much from 2003 (22.3%) to 2012 (23.1%).&lt;ref name="Yoder" /&gt; The percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women in engineering increased from 11.6% in 1995, to 17.4% in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/nsf06308/pdf/tab2.pdf | title=Table 2. Doctorates awarded to women, by field of study: 1995–2004| publisher=National Science Foundation|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 21.1% in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Scott Jaschik,

Since 1997, the percentage of Asian females enrolling in engineering majors has risen from about 30% to 34% but somehow also dropped in 2002. African American females have increased their representation in engineering from 21% to 33% in the same time frame. Mexican American (Chicana) and Puerto Rican females have had an increase in their representation from 25% to 31%. Even if ethnicities are included in these statistics, men from all ethnicities still outnumber the proportion of women who enroll in engineering bachelor programs.&lt;ref name="Recruiting" /&gt;

There is a significant drop-off rate regarding the number of women who earn a bachelor's degree and the women who afterward enroll in graduate school. Over the last 35 years, women have been more likely than men to enroll in graduate school right after receiving their bachelor's degree. Women who do not enroll in a graduate program right after earning their bachelor's degree tend to be caregivers who face work-family conflicts in the context of family women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Committee on the Guide to Recruiting and Advancing Women Scientists and Engineers in Academia|last2=Committee on Women in Science and Engineering|last3=National Research Council|title=To Recruit and Advance : Women Students and Faculty in U.S. Science and Engineering|pages=14–47|ref=Recruiting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The workforce remains the area of lowest representation for women. In 2009, women comprised 48% of the total workforce, but only 14% of the engineering workforce.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Australia===
Only 14% of engineers in [[Australia]] are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://robogals.org/about/who-what-why/|title=Who, What, Why|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Robogals|accessdate=10 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retention of female engineers is also disproportionally low; in 2006, 62.6% of qualified male engineers were employed in engineering professions, as opposed to 47.1% of qualified female engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaspura|first=Andre|year=2014|title=THE ENGINEERING PROFESSION: A STATISTICAL OVERVIEW|url=http://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/sites/default/files/shado/Resources/the_engineering_profession_a_statistical_overview_11th_ed._october_2014.pd|journal=|publisher=Engineers Australia|volume=11|pages=117|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
Though women tend to make up more than half of the undergraduate population in [[Canada]], the number of women in engineering is disproportionately low.&lt;ref name="Myers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/career-advice/why-more-women-arent-becoming-engineers/article1216432/|title=Why more women aren't becoming engineers |last=Myers|first=Jennifer|date=9 Nov 2010|accessdate=24 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas in 2001, 21 percent of students in engineering programs were female, by 2009, this had fallen to 17 percent.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt; One commentator attributed this drop to a number of factors, such as the failure of higher education programs to explain how engineering can improve others' lives, a lack of awareness of what engineers do, and discomfort of being in a male-dominated environment and the perception that women must adapt to fit in.&lt;ref name="Myers" /&gt;

In the 1990s, undergraduate enrollment of women in engineering fluctuated from 17 to 18%, while in 2001, it rose to 20.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_women.cfm|title=Women in Engineering|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 17.7% of students in undergraduate engineering were women.&lt;ref name="Canada1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engineerscanada.ca/files/w_report_enrolment_eng.pdf|title=Canadian Engineers for Tomorrow: Trends in Engineering Enrolment and Degrees Awarded 2006 to 2010|publisher=Engineers Canada|accessdate=30 Jun 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the INWES Education and Research Institute (ERI) held a national workshop, Canadian Committee of Women in Engineering (CCWE+20), to determine ways of increasing the number of women in the engineering field in Canada.&lt;ref name="ccwe20"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uottawa.ca/media/media-release-2376.html|title=Canada needs more women engineers—how do we get there?|date=26 Jul 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013|publisher=University of Ottawa}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCWE+20 identified a goal of increasing women's interest in engineering by 2.6 percent by 2016 to a total of 25 percent through more incentives such as through collaboration and special projects.&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop identifies early education as one of the main barriers in addition to other factors, such as: "the popular culture of their generation, the guidance they receive on course selection in high school and the extent to which their parents, teachers, and counselors recognize engineering as an appropriate and legitimate career choice for women."&lt;ref name="ccwe20" /&gt; The workshop report compares enrollment, teaching, and professional statistics from the goals identified in 1997 compared to the actual data from 2009, outlining areas of improvement (see table, right).
