      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3180">'''Abdul Haq''' ({{lang-ar| عبد الحق }}) is a Muslim male given name, and in modern usage, surname. It is built from the Arabic words ''[[Abd (Arabic)|Abd]]'', ''[[al-]]'' and ''[[Haqq]]''. The name means "servant of the Truth", ''Al-Haqq'' being one of the [[names of God in the Qur'an]], which give rise to the [[List of Arabic theophoric names|Muslim theophoric names]].&lt;ref name=ahmed&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author=Salahuddin Ahmed| publisher = Hurst &amp; Company| location=London| year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rahman&gt;{{cite book| title=A Dictionary of Muslim Names| author= S. A. Rahman| publisher=Goodword Books|  location=New Delhi| year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter ''a'' of the ''al-'' is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by ''e''. So the first part can appear as Abdel, Abdul or Abd-al. The second part may appear as Haq, Haqq, Haque, Hak or in other ways. The whole name is subject to variable spacing and hyphenation.

It may refer to:

'''Ada Maud Besinnet Roche''' (1890–1936) also known as '''Ada Bessinet''' was an American spiritualist [[Mediumship|medium]].&lt;ref&gt;Ravin, James G. (1991). ''The Wanderings Of A Literary Ophthalmologist: A. Conan Doyle, Houdini, and Ada Besinnet''. Documenta Ophthalmologica 77: 335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodger 2006"&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland. pp. 16-17. {{ISBN|0-7864-2770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==

Besinnet was known for materializing 'phantom' faces, producing voices and '[[psychic]]' lights in her séances. Psychical researchers were convinced that all her phenomena were fraudulent but some suggested she may have been in a [[Dissociation (psychology)|dissociated state]].&lt;ref name="Rodger 2006"/&gt; Researchers found the phantom faces suspicious, commenting that they had a strong resemblance to her own face.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"&gt;[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]]. (2001). ''Final Séance: The Strange Friendship Between Houdini and Conan Doyle''. Prometheus Books. pp. 74-111. {{ISBN|1-57392-896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besinnet refused to sit with the magician [[Harry Houdini]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Fulton Oursler|Oursler, Fulton]]. (1948). ''These are Strange Tales''. John C. Winston Company. p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; She had been exposed as a fraud by an undercover magician [[Fulton Oursler]]. During the séance he heard the medium leaving her chair, moved his shoe over the seat and discovered she was not there. Oursler in his exposure wrote that Besinnet had easily performed the phenomenon herself by getting up and moving around the room making noises. He had studied [[ventriloquism]] and stated all the voices were her own. As for the faces and lights, he suggested they were masks and observed a flashlight and, on another occasion, a rag in her hand.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Rinn|Rinn, Joseph]]. (1950). ''Searchlight on Psychical Research''. Rider and Company. pp. 273-277&lt;/ref&gt;

Besinnet was also caught cheating by psychical researcher [[James Hewat McKenzie]]. In response, Besinnet claimed she was unconscious in her séances and had no knowledge of the events that took place.&lt;ref&gt;Hazelgrove, Jenny. (2000). ''Spiritualism and British Society Between the Wars''. Manchester University Press. p. 250. {{ISBN|0-7190-5559-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hereward Carrington]] who investigated Besinnet wrote that "my own sittings with this medium left me entirely unconvinced of their genuineness."&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt;

In [[Toledo, Ohio]] the spiritualist [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] attended séances with Besinnet and claimed the faces were of his mother and nephew. Doyle endorsed her as a genuine [[Materialization (paranormal)|materialization]] medium. This was disputed by other researchers who noted Besinnet had already been caught utilizing tricks by Oursler, but Doyle had ignored the exposure.&lt;ref name="Polidoro 2001"/&gt; Psychical researcher [[J. Malcolm Bird]] who had attended a séance with Doyle was also skeptical and concluded "I saw these particular apparitions almost as well as well as he did... they were not sufficiently clear to be identified at all, save by a liberal contribution of desire and imagination".&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Malcolm Bird|Bird, J. Malcolm]]. (1924). ''My Psychic Adventures''. New York: Scientific American Publishing Company. pp. 271-272&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James H. Hyslop]] of the [[American Society for Psychical Research]] concluded after attending 70 sittings that Besinnet was responsible for the all phenomena during the séances but her trance control was a "secondary personality".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Douglas; Williams, Pat. (1965). ''The Supernatural''. Hawthorn Books. p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aimée Kabila Mulengela''' (24 July 1976 – 16 January 2008) was the alleged natural daughter of [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], president of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). 
She was killed in her home by armed intruders on 16 January 2008. Although she had been issued a diplomatic passport as the daughter of Kabila, after her death the government claimed that she was unrelated to the former president.

==Life==

Aimée Kabila Mulengela was said to be the natural daughter of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila and Zaïna Kibangula.{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}
She would thus be the half-sister of President [[Joseph Kabila]].{{sfn|Kasusula|2011}}
She was born on 24 July 1976 in [[Kipushi]], Democratic Republic of Congo.{{sfn|Une des pages du passeport diplomatique...}}
Laurent-Désiré Kabila was assassinated on 16 January 2001 in Kinshasa and was succeeded ten days later by his son Joseph Kabila.{{sfn|«Joseph KABILA» - Etienne KABILA : Des tests ADN}}

Aimée's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, left Kinshasa secretly in January 2002 for South Africa.
He wanted to take Aimée with him but that was not possible since she was the mother of four children.{{sfn|Kasusula|2011}}
On 25 February 2005 she married Alain Mayemba Bamba, alias "Barracuda".{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}{{efn|Acte de Mariage n° 106 F°106 Volume : I/2005 du 25 février 2005}}
A diplomatic passport was issued to her in the name "Aimée Kabila" on 7 April 2005.{{sfn|Une des pages du passeport diplomatique...}}

On 30 December 2005 Aimée Kabila Mulengela was taken from her home in Kinshasa/Ngaliema by Special Services police and soldiers of the Military Detection of Anti-Homeland Activities (DEMIIAP) and detained for 52 days.
A report by the [[non-governmental organization]] "La voix des sans-voix" (VSV: Voice of the Voiceless) said her ex-husband Alain Mayemba Bamba ordered the detention, which would have been supported by [[Sifa Mahanya]], mother of President Joseph Kabila.{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}
The day after her detention her six month old baby was taken from her in her cell, and disappeared.
She was released on 24 February 2006.
Property taken at the time of her arrest, including money, jewelry, passports and other documents, were not returned.{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}

==Assassination==

Aimée Kabila Mulengela was killed in front of her children at her home in [[Mont Ngafula]], Kinshasa, in the early morning of 16 January 2008.{{sfn|Kasusula|2011}}
The morning before the killing the armed men in Congolese National Police uniforms who were posted to guard the home were removed.
She appears to have been tortured before being shot by two armed men who broke into her home.{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}
According to her children and neighbors several jeeps were parked outside the house at the time, and the body at the morgue showed stab wounds and marks of torture.{{sfn|Meurtre d'Aimée Kabila ... Virunga news}} 
She was survived by six children: Astrida Kabila (aged 15), Branly Kabila (13), Petit-Aimé Kabila (10), Mechak Kabila (8), Victor Kabila (6) and Victorine Aline Bamba (3).{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}

Before her murder Aimée Kabila had been asking questions about the future of the property of Laurent-Désiré Kabila and the identity of his heirs.
She said she felt threatened and asked for United Nations protection in the DRC.{{sfn|RFI: Radio France Internationale|2008}}
Aimée's brother, Etienne Taratibu Kabila, denounced the assassination the next day from his place of exile in South Africa, accusing the presidential guard of the killing.{{sfn|Kasusula|2011}}{{efn|Étienne Kabila Taratibu also claimed that Joseph Kabila was involved in the assassination of Espérance Kabila, his father's sister.{{sfn|Emongo|2013|p=56}} }}
Her family were subsequently subject to threats and intimidation that made them fear claiming the body and arranging a funeral.{{sfn|La Voix des Sans-Voix|2008}}

[[Floribert Chebeya]], president of VSV, which was investigating the death, said he feared that the police were trying to put pressure on him by summoning him for a road accident that had happened almost a year earlier.{{sfn|RFI: Radio France Internationale|2008}}
Floribert Chebeya was killed on 3 June 2010. He had been ordered to meet the national police chief, and had texted his wife to say he was at the police headquarters for the meeting, but it was not known what happened next. His partially undressed body was later found on the back seat of his own car.{{sfn|DR Congo human rights activist found dead ... BBC}}
Chebeya was still investigating Aimee's death, and was involved in other activities that were unwelcome to the government.{{sfn|Trefon|2011|loc=PT44}}

==Government position==

The official story was that the two killers were simply thieves who had bought a gun from an army deserter or the police, and Aimée Kabila Mulengela had been shot accidentally.{{sfn|Meurtre d'Aimée Kabila ... Virunga news}}
Two suspects were arrested on 25 January 2008 and the assault was reenacted two days later.{{sfn|RFI: Radio France Internationale|2008}}
General Oleko, Provincial Inspector of Police in Kinshasa, said during a press briefing that the victim was not connected to the presidential family and that he did not recognise that she bore the name of Kabila.
According to Ambassador Théodore Mugalu, the victim was named Aimée Mulengela Koko, with a father from [[North Kivu]] and a mother from [[Équateur (former province)|Equateur]].
The name Aimée Kabila had been assumed falsely.{{sfn|Radio Okapi|2008}}

On 12 February 2013 the government spokesman and media minister [[Lambert Mende Omalanga]] said Etienne Kabila was involved in a conspiracy against the DRC that had been foiled by the South African authorities.
He said Etienne Kabila was actually Etienne Kitsa, son of Raphael Kianzoluka of [[Bandundu Province|Bandundu]] and Françoise Kitsa Kikapu of [[South Kivu]].
He repeated that Aimée Mulengela Kabila was in fact Aimée Mulengela, daughter of a sergeant  of the former Zairean National Gendarmerie based in Kipushi.
She had been awarded a diplomatic passport based on her claim to be the daughter of the former president.
Using this identity she started a household with Alain Barracuda, a patron of Congolese music who was trying to get closer to the presidential family.
He said that Barracuda, having found that he had been tricked into investing large sums of money based on her assumed identity, had arranged to eliminate her physically on the night of 15 January 2008.
When asked about the possibility of using DNA tests to put the matter to rest Lambert Mende strongly rejected the option, saying it would be a waste of time and money.{{sfn|«Joseph KABILA» - Etienne KABILA : Des tests ADN}}

}}

'''Andrew Stephen 'Andy' Grove''' (born '''András István Gróf'''; 2 September 1936{{snd}}21 March 2016) was a Hungarian-born American businessman, engineer, author and a pioneer in the [[semiconductor industry]]. He escaped from [[Hungarian People's Republic|Communist-controlled Hungary]] at the age of 20 and moved to the United States where he finished his education. He was one of the founders and the CEO of [[Intel]], helping transform the company into the world's largest manufacturer of [[semiconductors]].&lt;ref name=Bloomberg/&gt;

As a result of his work at Intel, along with his books and professional articles, Grove had a considerable influence on electronics manufacturing industries worldwide. He has been called the "guy who drove the growth phase" of [[Silicon Valley]].&lt;ref name=nyt2001/&gt; In 1997, ''Time'' magazine chose him as [[Time Person of the Year|"Man of the Year"]], for being "the person most responsible for the amazing growth in the power and the innovative potential of microchips."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=TimeMOTY/&gt; One source notes that by his accomplishments at Intel alone, he "merits a place alongside the great business leaders of the 20th century."&lt;ref name=Movers&gt;''Movers and Shakers: the 100 Most Influential Figures in Modern Business'', Basic Books (2003), pp. 205–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, he was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]]; he became a contributor to several foundations that sponsor research towards a cure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/2008/0128/070.html "Andy Grove's Last Stand"].&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at his home on March 21, 2016; the cause of death was unspecified.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/technology/andrew-grove-intel-obituary.html?_r=0 | work = [[The New York Times]] | title = Andrew S. Grove, Longtime Chief of Intel, Dies at 79| first = Jonathan | last = Kandall| date = 21 March 2016| accessdate = 22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life and education==
Grove was born to a middle-class [[Jews|Jewish]] family in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], the son of Maria and George Gróf. At the age of four he contracted [[scarlet fever]], which was nearly fatal and caused partial hearing loss.&lt;ref name=Movers/&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-680-8282A-38A, Budapest, Panzer VI (Tiger II, Königstiger).jpg|thumb|left|Nazi invasion of Budapest, 1944]]

When he was eight, the Nazis [[Operation Margarethe|occupied Hungary]] and deported nearly 500,000 Jews to concentration camps, including [[Auschwitz]]. Its commandant, [[Rudolf Höss]], said at his trial that he killed 400,000 Hungarian Jews in three months.&lt;ref&gt;This statement is corroborated by information shared in his autobiography. See: Rudolf Höss, ''Death Dealer: The Memoirs of the SS Kommandant at Auschwitz'' (Amherst, NY: Prometheus Books, 1992), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; To avoid being arrested, Grove and his mother took on false identities and were sheltered by friends.&lt;ref name=Movers/&gt; His father, however, was arrested and taken to an Eastern Labor Camp to do forced labor, and was reunited with his family only after the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/technology/andrew-grove-intel-obituary.html "Andrew S. Grove Dies at 79; Intel Chief Spurred Semiconductor Revolution"], ''New York Times'', March 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], when he was 20, he left his home and family and escaped across the border into [[Austria]]. Penniless and barely able to speak English, in 1957 he eventually made his way to the [[United States]]. He later changed his name to the [[Anglicisation|anglicized]] Andrew S. Grove.&lt;ref name=Grove/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/technology/30nocera.html|title=From Intel to Health Care to Beyond|last=Nocera|first=Andrew|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2005-07-30|accessdate=2012-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grove summarized his first twenty years of life in Hungary in his memoirs:
{{quote|By the time I was twenty, I had lived through a [[Government of National Unity (Hungary)|Hungarian Fascist dictatorship]], [[Operation Margarethe|German military occupation]], the Nazis' "[[Final Solution]]," the [[siege of Budapest]] by the Soviet [[Red Army]], a period of chaotic democracy in the years immediately after the war, a variety of repressive Communist regimes, and a [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|popular uprising]] that was put down at gunpoint. . . [where] many young people were killed; countless others were interned. Some two hundred thousand Hungarians escaped to the West. I was one of them.&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;Grove, Andrew S. ''Swimming Across: a Memoir'', Hachette Book Group (2001) Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Soon after arriving in the United States, in New York, in 1957, he met his future wife, Eva Kastan, who was a fellow refugee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Tedlow|first=Richard | authorlink = Richard S. Tedlow|date=2007 |title=Andy Grove: The Life and Times of an American Business Icon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zQamXENAalkC&amp;dq=Eva+Kastan+refugee|location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn=9781591841821 |accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They met while he held a job as a busboy and she was a waitress. They married in June 1958 and remained married until his death. They had two daughters, Karen Grove and Robie Spector, and eight grandchildren.&lt;ref name=Crown&gt;[http://www.crownheights.info/index.php?amount=0&amp;blogid=1&amp;query=Andrew+Grove "Andrew Grove 1 of the 3 co-founders of Intel Corp"], ''CrownHeights.info'', July 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=andrew-grove&amp;pid=178560960&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though he arrived in the United States with little money, Grove retained a "passion for learning."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; He earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[chemical engineering]] from the [[City College of New York]] in 1960, followed by a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in chemical engineering from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1963.

==Career==

===Helping start up Intel===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=When I came to Intel, I was scared to death. I left a very secure job where I knew what I was doing and started running R&amp;D for a brand new venture in untried territory. It was terrifying.|source=Andrew Grove&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-22/andy-grove-taught-silicon-valley-how-to-do-business-dies-at-79 "Andy Grove, Valley Veteran Who Founded Intel, Dies at 79"], ''Bloomberg'', March 21, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After completing his Ph.D. in 1963, Grove worked at [[Fairchild Semiconductor]] as a researcher, and by 1967 had become its assistant director of development.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;Henderson, Harry. ''Encyclopedia of Computer Science and Technology'', Infobase Publishing (2009), p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; His work there made him familiar with the early development of [[integrated circuit]]s, which would lead to the "[[microcomputer revolution]]" in the 1970s. In 1967, he wrote a college textbook on the subject, ''Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices.''&lt;ref name=Grove2&gt;Grove, Andrew. ''Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices'', John Wiley and Sons (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Andy Grove Robert Noyce Gordon Moore 1978 edit.jpg|thumb|left|Andy Grove, [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]] (1978)]]
In 1968, [[Robert Noyce]] and [[Gordon Moore]] co-founded Intel, after they and Grove left [[Fairchild Semiconductor]].  Grove joined on the day of its incorporation, although was not a founder according to the company. Fellow Hungarian émigré [[Leslie L. Vadász]] was Intel's fourth employee.&lt;ref name="nyt2001"&gt;{{cite news|title= Andy Grove's Tale of His Boyhood in Wartime|url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E1DA1238F931A25752C1A9679C8B63&amp;pagewanted=all | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=2001-11-12| accessdate=2011-02-19 | first=Chris | last=Gaither}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Grove worked initially as the company's director of engineering, and helped get its early manufacturing operations started. In 1983, he wrote a book, ''High Output Management,'' in which he described many of his methods and manufacturing concepts.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;

Initially, Intel primarily manufactured dynamic memory chips, [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAMs]]. By 1985, with less demand for their memory, production problems, and the challenges created by Japanese "[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]" of memory chips at below-cost prices, Grove was forced to make radical changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realworldtech.com/intel-dram/|title=Intel’s Long Awaited Return to the Memory Business|author=|date=|website=www.realworldtech.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he chose to discontinue producing DRAMs and focus instead on manufacturing microprocessors. Grove played a key role in negotiating with [[IBM]] to use only Intel microprocessors in all their new personal computers.

The company's revenue increased from $2,672 in its first year to $20.8 billion in 1997. Grove was Intel's president in 1979, its [[chief executive officer|CEO]] in 1987 and its chairman and CEO in 1997. He relinquished his CEO title in May 1998, having been diagnosed with prostate cancer a few years earlier, and remained chairman of the board until November 2004. Grove continued his work at Intel as a senior advisor and had been a lecturer at [[Stanford University]]. He reflected back upon Intel's growth through  the years:
{{quote|In various bits and pieces, we have steered Intel from a start-up to one of the central companies of the information economy.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

Grove is credited with having transformed Intel from a manufacturer of memory chips into one of the world's dominant producers of microprocessors. During his tenure as CEO, Grove oversaw a 4,500% increase in Intel's market capitalization from $4 billion to $197 billion, making it the world's 7th largest company, with 64,000 employees. Most of the company's profits were reinvested in research and development, along with building new facilities, in order to produce improved and faster microprocessors.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;

===Management methods and style===
{{quote box|align=right|width=25em|bgcolor = Cornsilk|quote=Probably no one person has had a greater influence in shaping Intel, Silicon Valley, and all we think about today in the technology world than Andy Grove.|source=[[Pat Gelsinger]], CEO of [[VMware]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/former-intel-ceo-andy-grove-dies-at-79-1458609251 "Former Intel CEO Andy Grove Dies at 79"], ''Wall Street Journal'', March 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As director of operations, manufacturing became Grove's primary focus and his management style relied heavily on his management concepts. As the company expanded and he was appointed chairman, he became more involved in strategic decision-making, including establishing markets for new products, coordinating manufacturing processes and developing new partnerships with smaller companies.

Grove helped create the [[Intel Architecture Laboratory]] (IAL) in [[Oregon]] to ensure that software was developed in time to take advantage of their new microprocessors. Grove stated that "you are making decisions about what the information technology world will want five years into the future&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; He created a culture within Intel that allowed innovation to flourish. As CEO, he wanted his managers to always encourage experimentation and prepare for changes, making a case for the value of paranoia in business.  He became known for his guiding motto: "Only the paranoid survive," and wrote a management book with the same title.&lt;ref name=Grove1&gt;Grove, Andrew. ''Only the Paranoid Survive'', Doubleday (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Grove, "Business success contains the seeds of its own destruction,"&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; explaining that "Success breeds complacency. Complacency breeds failure. Only the paranoid survive."&lt;ref name=Grove1/&gt; As a result, he urges senior executives to allow people to test new techniques, new products, new sales channels, and new customers, to be ready for unexpected shifts in business or technology.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Grove biographer Jeremy Byman observes that Grove "was the one person at Intel who refused to let the company rest on its laurels."&lt;ref name=Byman&gt;Byman, Jeremy. ''Andrew Grove and the Intel Corporation'', Morgan Reynolds (1999), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Grove explains his reasoning:
{{quote|A corporation is a living organism; it has to continue to shed its skin. Methods have to change. Focus has to change. Values have to change. The sum total of those changes is transformation.&lt;ref name=Esquire/&gt;}}

Intel Senior Vice President Ron Whittier notes that Grove preferred to keep open channels of communication between employees, and encouraged people to speak their minds: "People here aren't afraid to speak up and debate with Andy."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; They termed this style "constructive confrontation."&lt;ref name=Crown/&gt; According to Grove's successor at Intel, [[Craig Barrett (chief executive)|Craig Barrett]], "It's give and take, and anyone in the company can yell at him. He's not above it." Grove insisted that people be demanding on one another, which fostered an atmosphere of "ruthless intelligence."&lt;ref name=Crown/&gt; About that philosophy, writes business author Ken Goldstein, "you bought into it or got your walking papers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth F. Goldstein|Goldstein, Ken]]. [http://goodmenproject.com/business-ethics-2/many-lessons-andy-grove-gmp/ "The Many Lessons of Andy Grove"], ''[[The Good Men Project]]'', April 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove's office was an {{convert|8|by|9|ft|abbr=on}} cubicle like the other employees, as he disliked separate "mahogany-paneled corner offices." He states, "I've been living in cubicles since 1978 — and it hasn't hurt a whole lot."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Preferring this egalitarian atmosphere, this made his work area accessible to anyone who walked by. There were no reserved parking spaces, and Grove parked wherever there was a space.&lt;ref name=Crown/&gt; This atmosphere at work was partly a reflection of his personal life. Some who have known him, such as venture capitalist [[Arthur Rock]], have stated that "he has no airs."  Grove has lived modestly without expensive cars or an airplane.&lt;ref name=Crown/&gt;

Grove was noted for making sure that important details were never missed, with one of his favorite sayings being, "The devil is in the details." Intel Vice President Dennis Carter states that "Andy is very disciplined, precise, and detail oriented&amp;nbsp;... But at the same time, he has an element of intuition and creativity that is fundamental to Intel's innovation."&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; According to ''[[Industry Week]]'' magazine, Grove feared that the "brilliance that sparked the creation of Intel" during its early years, "might come to nothing if somebody didn't pay attention to details." Carter recalls that Grove would even correct his spelling errors:
{{quote|When he came to this country from Hungary in 1956, he didn't speak English. Yet I learned spelling from him. Not only does he have the instincts of a teacher, but he also has a great deal of patience.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

=== "The Father of OKR" (Objectives and Key Results) Approach to Management ===
One of the earliest investors in Google, [[John Doerr]], called Andy Grove the "Father of [[OKR]]s" in Doerr's 2018 book,  ''Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs.''&lt;ref name="Doerr 2018 31"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs|last=Doerr|first=John|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=9780525536239|location=|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; An acronym for Objectives and Key Results, it became central to Google's culture as a "management methodology that helps to ensure that the company focuses efforts on the same important issues throughout the organization."&lt;ref name="Doerr 2018 12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs|last=Doerr|first=John|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=9780525536239|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective is the clearly-defined goal, while the key results were the specific benchmarks to ensure achievement of that goal were "measurable and verifiable."&lt;ref name="Doerr 2018 12"/&gt;

In 1975, Doerr wrote of attending a course within Intel taught by Andy Grove, where he was introduced to the theory of OKRs.&lt;ref name="Doerr 2018 31"/&gt; Grove explained his simple but effective perspective on management: "The key result has to be measurable. But at the end you can look, and without any arguments: Did I do that or did I not do it? Yes? No? Simple. No judgments in it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs|last=Doerr|first=John|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=9780525536239|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Page]], the CEO of Alphabet and co-founder of [[Google]], credited OKRs within the foreword to Doerr's book: "OKRs have helped lead us to 10x growth, many times over. They’ve helped make our crazily bold mission of 'organizing the world’s information' perhaps even achievable. They’ve kept me and the rest of the company on time and on track when it mattered the most."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Measure What Matters: How Google, Bono, and the Gates Foundation Rock the World with OKRs|last=Doerr|first=John|publisher=Penguin Publishing Group|year=2018|isbn=9780525536239|location=|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preference for a "job-centric" American economy===
While Grove naturally supported helping technology startups, he also felt that America was wrong in thinking that those new companies would increase employment. "Startups are a wonderful thing," he wrote in a 2010 article for [[Bloomberg News|''Bloomberg'']], "but they cannot by themselves increase tech employment."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2&gt;Grove, Andrew. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2010-07-01/andy-grove-how-america-can-create-jobs "Andy Grove: How America Can Create Jobs"], ''Bloomberg News'', July 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of those startups and entrepreneurs would achieve tremendous success and wealth, said Grove, he was more concerned with the overall negative effect on America: "What kind of a society are we going to have if it consists of highly paid people doing high-value-added work—and masses of unemployed?"&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt;

He felt that employment growth depended on those companies' ability or willingness to scale up within the U.S. According to Grove, Silicon Valley's "innovation machine" over the last few decades has not been adding many jobs, although American tech companies have instead been adding jobs in Asia "like mad."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt; He noted that while our investments in startups have increased dramatically, those investments have in fact resulted in fewer jobs: "Simply put," he wrote, "the U.S. has become wildly inefficient at creating American tech jobs."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt; He therefore worked to keep Intel's manufacturing in the U.S., with the company having 90,000 employees in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/2016/03/22/former-intel-ceo-chairman-andrew-grove-dies-at-79.html "Former Intel CEO Chairman Andrew Grove Dies at 79"], ''Fox Business'', March 22, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  He explained the causes and effects of many business's growth plans:

{{quote|Each company, ruggedly individualistic, does its best to expand efficiently and improve its own profitability. However, our pursuit of our individual businesses, which often involves transferring manufacturing and a great deal of engineering out of the country, has hindered our ability to bring innovations to scale at home. Without scaling, we don't just lose jobs—we lose our hold on new technologies. Losing the ability to scale will ultimately damage our capacity to innovate.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt;}}

To remedy the problem, he strongly believed that "job creation" should become America's number 1 objective, much as it is in Asian nations. Among the methods he felt were worth considering was the imposition of a tax on imported products, with the funds received then made available to help American companies scale their operations here. However, he also accepted the fact that his ideas would be controversial: "If what I'm suggesting sounds protectionist, so be it."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt; Or that those protectionist steps could lead to conflicts with our trade partners: "If the result is a trade war, treat it like other wars—fight to win."&lt;ref name=Bloomberg2/&gt; He added:
{{quote|All of us in business have a responsibility to maintain the industrial base on which we depend and the society whose adaptability — and stability — we may have taken for granted.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/opinion/andy-groves-warning-to-silicon-valley.html "Andy Grove’s Warning to Silicon Valley"], ''New York Times'', March 26, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Grove was also in the minority of high-tech leaders when he advocated taxing internet sales made to other states: "I don't think electronic commerce needs federal or state subsidies in terms of tax advantages," he told a Congressional committee in 2000.&lt;ref name=Computerworld&gt;"High-Tech Chiefs Lobby Key Issues at Capitol Hill Hearing", ''Computerworld'', June 12, 2000, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same hearing, he also expressed his opinion about [[internet privacy]], stating that "personal data is a form of property and it's inevitable that governments will regulate property rights." He said that it would be better if the federal government established its own uniform privacy standards rather than have states create a patchwork of different laws.&lt;ref name=Computerworld/&gt;

===Writing &amp; teaching===
Grove was also a noted author and scientist. His first book on semiconductors, ''Physics and Technology of Semiconductor Devices'' (1967),&lt;ref name=Grove2/&gt; has been used by leading universities. Another book he wrote on business operation methods, ''High Output Management'' (1983), has been translated into 11 languages. He also wrote over 40 technical papers and held several patents on semiconductor devices.&lt;ref name=Koven/&gt;

Grove wrote ''Only the Paranoid Survive'', a business book, whose core message is that a company in pursuit of a stronger competitive advantage never rests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Market-Based Management|last=Best|first=Roger|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2013|isbn=9780130387752|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey|pages=195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also taught graduate computer physics courses at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]].

===Philanthropy===
[[File:The Grove School of Engineering--Steinman Hall at City College of New York (CUNY).jpg|thumb|Grove School of Engineering-CCNY]]

In 2005, Grove made the largest donation that the [[City College of New York]] ([[CUNY]]) has ever received. His grant of $26 million transformed the CCNY School of Engineering into the [[Grove School of Engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www1.cuny.edu/mu/forum/2005/10/28/intels-grove-gives-26-million-to-ccnys-school-of-engineering/ | title=Intel's Grove gives $26 million to CCNY'S school of engineering | publisher=CUNY Newswire | work=News Report | date=October 28, 2005 | accessdate=September 30, 2016 | last1=Hershenson |first1=Jay |last2=Arena |first2=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grove was also instrumental, as a key fundraiser, in establishing the [[University of California, San Francisco]]'s [[University of California, San Francisco#Mission Bay|Mission Bay Campus]], the largest ongoing biomedical construction project in the world.&lt;ref name=UCSF&gt;[https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2016/04/402311/ucsf-mourns-loss-andrew-s-grove-1936-2016 "UCSF Mourns Loss of Andrew S. Grove (1936-2016)"], UCSF, April 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor Sam Hawgood said that Grove's "generous and tireless support of UCSF has transformed our university and helped accelerate our research into breakthrough treatments and better patient care."&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

[[File:Mission Bay, UCSF.jpg|thumb|UCSF Mission Bay campus]]

Among the research facilities which he helped fund were the UCSF Prostate Cancer Center, the Helen Diller Family Cancer Research Building, and the Clinical and Translational Science Institute. He also promoted general surgery initiatives and supported various obstetrics and gynecology research programs.&lt;ref name=UCSF/&gt;

Grove was a longtime member of the [[International Rescue Committee]] (IRC), along with being one of its overseers and a member of its board of directors. He was also the founding supporter of the IRC's Pathways to Citizenship program. In 2010, the IRC honored him as one of ten distinguished refugees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rescue.org/blog/remembering-andrew-grove-irc-overseer-and-champion-refugees "Remembering Andrew Grove, IRC Overseer and champion of refugees"], Rescue.org, March 30, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine in 2000, Grove encouraged the United States to be "vigilant as a nation to have tolerance for difference, a tolerance for new people." He pointed out that immigration and immigrants are what made America what it is.&lt;ref name=Esquire&gt;[http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/learned-andy-grove-0500 "What I've Learned: Andy Grove"], ''Esquire'' magazine, May 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arsenios the Cappadocian''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ὅσιος Ἀρσένιος ὁ Καππαδόκης April 7, 1840 – November 10, 1924) was born on April 7, 1840 in Kephalochori, one of the six Christian villages of the region of Pharasa of [[Cappadocia]] an early center of the [[Eastern Christianity]]. He had a brother named Vlasios.&lt;ref&gt;Γέροντος Παΐσιου (Εζνεπίδη), «Ο Πατήρ Αρσένιος ο Καππαδόκης», εκδ. Ι. Ησυχαστηρίου «ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΣΤΗΣ ΙΩΑΝΝΗΣ Ο ΘΕΟΛΟΓΟΣ», Σουρωτή, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Born Theodorus Annitsalichos, his father was a teacher. Both parents died when he was very young, and he and his brother were raised by a maternal aunt. He was sent to be educated in [[Niğde]], where he stayed with a paternal aunt who was a teacher. She, in turn, arranged for him to stay with relatives in [[Smyrna]], while he continued his education. Besides Greek and Church Studies, he learned [[Armenian language|Armenian]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and some [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name=Pemptousia&gt;[http://pemptousia.com/2017/11/the-life-of-saint-arsenios-hadjiephentis-part-i/ "The life of Saint Arsenios the Cappadocian", Pemptousia, November 10, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was about 26 years old he went to the Monastery of the [[John the Baptist|Holy Forerunner]] of Phlavianai in [[Caesarea in Cappadocia|Caesarea]]. Later he was tonsured a [[Christian monasticism|monk]] and took the name Arsenios. Metropolitan Paisios II sent him to Pharasa and the neighbouring villages as a priest, while he was also secretly teaching the [[Greek language]] to the children of the region, at that time belonging to the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name=Pemptousia/&gt; In 1870, when he was thirty years old, he was consecrated an [[archimandrite]].

After ordination, he went on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]]. Upon his return to Pharasa,  the villagers called him Hadjiephentis. He was the respected spiritual guide of the villagers and helped the people a lot together with the mayor of Pharasa, at that time the father of Saint [[Paisios of Mount Athos]]. He was claimed to have healed sick people who came to him, [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]]. He gave Paisios his own name at [[baptism]] despite the parents' wish to name the child after a grandfather. Later he became the spiritual father of Elder Paisios of Mount Athos.&lt;ref name=Paisios&gt;Paisios of Mount Athos. ''Saint Arsenios the Cappadocian'', Thessaloniki 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After leading his congrgation to [[Corfu]] at the time of the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], he died after three months, at the age of eighty-three.&lt;ref name=Paisios/&gt;

Both Father Arsenios as well Elder Paisios were recognised by the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate]] as Orthodox Saints, Arsenios by the Ecumenical Patriarch [[Demetrios I of Constantinople]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;«Περιοδικό Πεμπτουσία», τευχ. 1, Δεκέμβριος 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; and Paisios by the Ecumenical Patriarch [[Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] in 2015.

''History of Camden and Rockport, Maine.'' Camden Publishing Co., 1907. http://www.davistownmuseum.org/InfoAboriginals.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Capture ==
Assacumet was captured in 1605 by [[George Weymouth|Capt. George Weymouth]] of the ship ''Archangel'' near the [[Pemaquid River]] in Maine together with four others. Some sources list the other four as ''Tasquantum'' (better known as [[Squanto]]), ''Manida'', ''Skettwarroes'', and ''Dehamda''; others list them as ''Tahanedo'' ("a Sagamo or Commander"), ''Amoret'', ''Skicowaros'', and ''Maneddo '' (listed as "gentlemen". Saffacomoit is listed as "a servant".) They were taken to England as slaves and curiosities.&lt;ref&gt;Biography and history of the Indians of North America By Samuel Gardner Drake. Boston, J. Drake, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosier, James. True Relation of Waymouth's Voyage, 1605. Wisconsin Historical Society, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challoung expedition ==

In England, Assacumet and at least two of the other captives were given to [[Sir Ferdinando Gorges]], and learned English. In 1606 Gorges sent an expedition to America under [[Henry Challoung|Capt. Henry Challoung]] (also known as ''Chalowns'' and ''Chalon''), with Assacumet and Manida, to the [[West Indies]] and [[Puerto Rico]]. The ship was captured by the Spanish fleet and taken to Spain. The ship and goods were confiscated, and the crew made prisoners in [[Seville]]. Manida was "lost" but Assacumet was eventually "recovered", after Captain John Barlee wrote to Secretary Cecil, urging him to use his influence to win the release of the two "savages.".&lt;ref&gt;Biography and history of the Indians of North America By Samuel Gardner Drake.

== Epenow ==

Returned to Gorges' home, Assacumet was lodged with [[Epenow]], a [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] captive captured in 1611, and helped him improve his English.&lt;ref&gt;Biography and history of the Indians of North America By Samuel Gardner Drake. Boston, J. Drake, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1614, Assacumet accompanied Gorges' expedition under [[Nicholas Hobson|Capt. Nicholas Hobson]] to [[Martha's Vineyard]], where they had convinced him that gold lay in a ploy to escape, and where Epenow ultimately escaped.&lt;ref&gt;Biography and history of the Indians of North America By Samuel Gardner Drake.

===Partnership with Jock McKeen===

After working in individual practices in [[Vancouver]], B.C.

'''Bipin Ganatra''' (born {{circa|1957}})&lt;ref name=dna/&gt; is an [[electrician]] in [[Kolkata]], [[West Bengal]], India. He is also an unofficial volunteer firefighter and was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] in 2017 for helping fight fires in the city.

== Inspiration ==
As a child Ganatra would rush after fire engines when he heard them and would start helping the firemen when he reached the scene of the fire. In 1982 Ganatra, then only 12 years old, lost his elder brother Narendra to a freak fire accident which occurred when a spark fell on fuel that his brother was handling while working on a motorcycle. His brother was admitted to hospital and succumbed to his injuries a little over a month later.&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

== Life ==
Ganatra, originally from [[Gujarat]], has been offering his services as a fireman in the city of [[Kolkata]], whose firefighting force of 1,258 firemen battled some 2,000 fires in 2014 and 1,600 fires in 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; He is an electrician by trade and earns a meager salary, borrowing from his friends to make ends meet. He also helps the police manage traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.india.com/news/india/meet-padma-awardee-bipin-ganatra-who-chases-fire-to-protect-people-1784739/|title=Meet Padma awardee Bipin Ganatra who chases fire to protect people|last=ANI|date=2017-01-26|work=India.com|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802130424/http://www.india.com/news/india/meet-padma-awardee-bipin-ganatra-who-chases-fire-to-protect-people-1784739/|archivedate=2 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Ganatra does not have any formal training with regards to firefighting. He started out by helping firefighters do odd jobs but now has risen to the level of a professional firefighter.&lt;ref name=dna&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-padma-shri-winner-after-losing-his-brother-to-fire-at-age-of-12-this-man-has-spent-his-life-as-voluntary-fire-fighter-2296094|title=Padma Shri winner: After losing his brother to fire at age of 12, this man has spent his life as voluntary fire fighter|date=2017-01-25|work=Daily News &amp; Analysis|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802170501/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-padma-shri-winner-after-losing-his-brother-to-fire-at-age-of-12-this-man-has-spent-his-life-as-voluntary-fire-fighter-2296094|archivedate=2 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 40 years, Ganatra has assisted in more than 100 fires, working to put out the flames, rescue victims, and clear away debris.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35557392|title=The Indian man who chases fires|last=Biswas|first=Soutik|date=2016-03-06|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731113155/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-35557392|archivedate=31 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his most dramatic rescues was of a pregnant woman trapped on the fifth floor of a burning building. The woman was too scared to move, so Ganatra scaled the building to reach her and convince her to come down.&lt;ref name=express/&gt; Ganatra has suffered injuries several times while helping put out flames, and also risked his life to extract two unexploded cylinders from a burning warehouse on [[Strand Road, Kolkata|Strand Road]].&lt;ref name=express/&gt;

Ganatra monitors the television news constantly and informs the fire department if a fire breaks out. Despite his contributions to the force he travels to the site by himself using public transport. In recognition of his efforts, the fire department has given him a rare steel volunteer card and a khaki uniform.&lt;ref name=express&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-unofficial-firefighter-bipin-ganatra-to-get-padma-shri-4495257/|title=West Bengal: Unofficial firefighter Bipin Ganatra to get Padma Shri|date=2017-01-28|work=The Indian Express|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730155227/http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/kolkata/west-bengal-unofficial-firefighter-bipin-ganatra-to-get-padma-shri-4495257/|archivedate=30 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bothaina Kamel''' ({{lang-arz|بثينة كامل}}; born in [[Cairo]], 18 April 1962) is an [[Egypt]]ian television anchor, activist, and politician. A long-time pro-democracy advocate, particularly in [[Shayfeencom]], her professional career has been marked by repeated conflict with authorities. In June 2011 she announced her candidacy for the [[President of Egypt|Egyptian presidency]],&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/world/middleeast/16iht-M16-EGYPT-KAMEL.html?hpw|title=Muslim Woman Seeks Egyptian Presidency|work=New York Times|date=15 June 2011|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she did not receive enough signatures to make the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/98946/Egypt/Politics-/Bothaina-Kamel-poised-for-second-presidential-run.aspx|title=Bothaina Kamel poised for second presidential run|work=Ahram Online|date=13 April 2014|accessdate=13 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She announced on 12 April 2014 that she would run in the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2014|2014 presidential election]]&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; though she was unable to collect enough endorsements to run.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/99434.aspx|title=A two horse race: Egypt's presidential elections|agency=Ahram Online|date=20 April 2014|accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamel hosted an Egyptian radio program called ''Nighttime Confessions'' from 1992 to 1998.  She later worked as a new presenter for Egyptian state television, and hosted a show called ''Please Understand Me'' on the Saudi Arabian-owned [[Orbit Communications Company|Orbit satellite TV network]]. In each assignment, she eventually encountered official resistance: ''Confessions'' was cancelled after outcries by religious conservatives; she took a leave of absence from Egyptian state television rather than participate in propaganda surrounding the 2005 elections; and ''Understand Me'' was taken off the air by the Saudi producers when they became concerned that its coverage of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] would implicate Saudi interests.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

She has long been active in pro-democracy activities, often present a pro-democracy rallies, forming the election monitoring group Shayfeencom, in 2005, and immediately taking to the streets during the 2011 revolution.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt;

She is a self-described [[social democracy|social democrat]],&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; and ran as an independent. A [[Sunni Muslim]], she has taken anti-sectarian stances, endorsing proposals for equal treatment of [[Copts|Coptic]] and Muslim places of worship and for trying those who incite sectarian violence.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Additionally, she wears a [[Muslim]] [[crescent]] and a [[Christian]] [[cross necklace]] both are symbols of Egyptian unity and also were the symbol of the [[Egyptian revolution of 1919|1919 Egyptian Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/83353/Egypt/Politics-/Expresidential-hopeful-Bothaina-Kamel-attacked-by-.aspx|title=Ex-presidential hopeful Bothaina Kamel attacked by 'Morsi supporters' - Politics  - Egypt - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; She criticized the military, rather than either sect, for sectarian clashes that have erupted in the wake of the revolution.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Other positions include reducing the minimum age of parliamentarians from 30 to 22 in view of the youth participation in the revolution.

==Career==
Gethard is an improvisational actor who works largely out of [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre]]. He began taking classes at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in 2000 while he was a student at [[Rutgers University]].&lt;ref name="ny_mag"&gt;{{cite web|last=Raftery|first=Brian|title=The Carson of Cable Access|url=http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/chris-gethard-2012-4/|work=New York Magazine|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is in the longform improvisation team The Stepfathers. He organizes a monthly show entitled "The Nights of Our Lives".{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} He has also been part of the UCB Theater's national touring company. An early noted work was entitled ''Darryl'', a one-man show where he portrayed troubled baseball player [[Darryl Strawberry]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

Gethard also wrote the web series ''The Most Awkward Boy in the World'' which starred fellow Stepfathers member [[Zach Woods]].

Gethard was featured on [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] magazine's "Ten Comics to Watch in 2010" list.

Gethard has appeared in multiple [[CollegeHumor.com]] videos. He has also appeared on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', ''[[Hope and Faith]]'' and [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[Crossballs]]''.

In April 2010, he was tapped as the lead, alongside [[Horatio Sanz]] and [[Chris Parnell]], in the [[Comedy Central]] sitcom ''[[Big Lake (TV series)|Big Lake]]''. In May 2012, during the CollegeHumor [[CollegeHumor#CH Originals|All-Nighter]], Gethard announced he would be opening a strawberry farm in upper New Jersey.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

In 2013, the [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|Independent Film Channel]] asked Gethard to write a pilot based on his book, ''A Bad Idea I'm About to Do''.  IFC gave Gethard a year, in addition to writing his pilot, to market for them at festivals and produce web content.&lt;ref name="av_club_ifc"&gt;{{cite web|last=Heisler|first=Steve|title=Chris Gethard explains his new IFC deal and how he makes his public-access show|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/chris-gethard-explains-his-new-ifc-deal-and-how-he,92509/|work=A.V. Club|accessdate=August 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gethard released his first comedy album, ''[[My Comedy Album]]'', on April 22, 2014 on New Jersey's [[Don Giovanni Records]].

In August 2016 Gethard participated for the first time in the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]], performing his show ''Career Suicide'' dealing with his experiences of depression, suicide attempts and alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jul/30/chris-gethard-depression-standup-comedy | title=Chris Gethard: turning shame and pain into laughs | date=July 30, 2016 | work=The Guardian | first=Seth |last=Colter Walls }}&lt;/ref&gt; During his run at the festival, he also recorded an episode of [[Stuart Goldsmith]]'s "Comedian's Comedian Podcast", which was published in December 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=189 – Chris Gethard {{!}} The Comedian's Comedian|url=http://www.comedianscomedian.com/189-chris-gethard/|website=comedianscomedian.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2017 [[HBO]] broadcast ''Career Suicide,'' an evening of standup comedy based on Gethard's [[off-Broadway]] show of the same title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/chris-gethards-off-broadway-career-suicide-sets-hbo-air-date|title=Chris Gethard’s Off-Broadway Career Suicide Sets HBO Air Date {{!}} Playbill|website=Playbill|language=en|access-date=June 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Produced by [[Judd Apatow]], the HBO special has garnered praise from [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4767866/chris-gethard-career-suicide-hbo/|title=Comedian Chris Gethard Is Risking His Career to Tackle This Topic|last=Chan|first=Melissa|website=Time|access-date=June 7, 2017|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/05/06/526892264/chris-gethard-isnt-kidding-about-career-suicide|title=Chris Gethard Isn't Kidding About 'Career Suicide'|work=NPR.org|access-date=June 7, 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|date=May 6, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170607050610/http://www.npr.org/sections/monkeysee/2017/05/06/526892264/chris-gethard-isnt-kidding-about-career-suicide|archivedate=June 7, 2017|df=|first=Linda|last=Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[The A.V.

===''The Chris Gethard Show''===
Gethard hosted ''[[The Chris Gethard Show]]'', a talkshow that originally aired on [[New York City]] public-access and was streamed around the world on Gethard's website. The show began as a live piece at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater in 2009. Gethard then went to [[Los Angeles]] to pitch a network version of the show, but ended up returning to New York City to produce it for public-access because he wanted to retain the chaotic, cheap feel of early [[MTV]] talk shows. The show has since grown to consist of both stage and filmed performances. It has developed a reputation for outrageous spectacle, often featuring awkward viewer calls, high-concept group segments and Gethard subjecting himself to abuse, including an episode where he hired a kickboxer to hit him if he failed to answer simple questions about his friends.&lt;ref name="ny_mag" /&gt; As a child, Gethard admired comedians who seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, such as Howard Stern, Andy Kaufman, and David Letterman. This interest influenced the style of ''The Chris Gethard Show'' and Gethard's comedic persona.

The show was entirely self-funded and none of the performers were paid for their time during its public access time. Though this largely surfaced as result of the style of Upright Citizens Brigade shows and the aesthetic of the show, Gethard had stated that he would not be opposed to the show being picked up by a television network. He met with a number of network producers, but the show was not picked up, the primary concern being its unpredictable nature and frequent swearing.&lt;ref name=av_club_ifc /&gt; In early 2014, Comedy Central ordered a pilot from TCGS, to be co-produced by Funny or Die, leading to a brief hiatus from the weekly program. The pilot was taped, but ultimately not picked up by Comedy Central. The show returned to MNN from April to January 2015. In its final MNN episode it was announced that the show had been picked up by [[Fusion (TV channel)|Fusion]], where it ran for two seasons.

Throughout the show's many manifestations, it has attracted a number of celebrity guests including [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], [[Amy Poehler]], [[Will Ferrell]], [[Paul Giamatti]], and [[Lena Dunham]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2017/05/the-chris-gethard-show-trutv-chris-gethard-live-1202083483/|title=‘The Chris Gethard Show’ Lands At TruTV; Will Be Broadcast Live|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=May 4, 2017|work=Deadline|access-date=June 7, 2017|language=en-US|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170506085005/http://deadline.com/2017/05/the-chris-gethard-show-trutv-chris-gethard-live-1202083483/|archivedate=May 6, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After its run on Fusion, ''The Chris Gethard Show'' was picked up for a third season by [[truTV]], and began airing live episodes in August 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In August 2018, Chris Gethard announced the show had been canceled and would not return for another season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vulture.com/2018/08/chris-gethard-announces-the-end-of-the-chris-gethard-show.html|title=Chris Gethard Announces the End of The Chris Gethard Show|last=Wright|first=Megh|work=Vulture|access-date=2018-08-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Beautiful/Anonymous''===
Gethard is currently the host of [[Earwolf]]'s podcast ''Beautiful/Anonymous'', which first aired on March 15, 2016. The following is Earwolf's description of the show:  "1 phone call. 1 hour. No names. No holds barred. That’s the premise behind ''Beautiful Stories from Anonymous People'', hosted by comedian Chris Gethard...Every week, Chris opens the phone line to one anonymous caller, and he can’t hang up first, no matter what. From shocking confessions and family secrets to philosophical discussions and shameless self-promotion, anything can and will happen!"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earwolf.com/show/beautiful-anonymous/ Beautiful Stories From Anonymous People], ''Earwolf'', Retrieved March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''In Your Dreams''===
Gethard co-hosted [[Earwolf]]'s podcast, ''In Your Dreams'', with Gary Richardson.&lt;ref name="In Your Dreams"&gt;[http://www.earwolf.com/show/in-your-dreams/ In Your Dreams with Chris Gethard, presented by Casper] ''Earwolf'', Retrieved March 20, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; The podcast first aired on December 12, 2016 with special guest comedian [[Aparna Nancherla]], and the ninth and final episode aired on February 6, 2017.&lt;ref name="In Your Dreams" /&gt;

===Books===
Gethard is also the author of ''Weird NY'', a book detailing the [[Ghost story|ghost stories]] and [[urban legends]] of [[New York City]], and ''A Bad Idea I'm About to Do'', a collection of stories from Gethard's life, which has been highlighted on [[This American Life]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/453/nemeses |title=Nemeses |publisher=This American Life |date=December 16, 2011 |accessdate=February 12, 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113002059/http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/453/nemeses |archivedate=January 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Gethard served as an editorial assistant for the popular ''[[Weird NJ]]'' and ''[[Weird US]]'' publications.

===Interactions with fans===
Gethard hitchhiked from Los Angeles to [[Bonnaroo]] (Tennessee) relying only on the good will of others to help him. He has a series of YouTube videos that document his trip. The videos include trips in vans and driving a firetruck.

''The Chris Gethard Show'' is well known for its audience interaction. One show featured a woman calling in to inquire about the purpose of the show. Gethard invited her to join them and she became a regular for four months.&lt;ref name=ny_mag /&gt; After this the notion of random, unknown fans becoming regular cast members became popular. The show continued this trend through its public access run, having a new "random" as a cast member for 15 episodes.

==Personal life==
Gethard married Hallie Bulleit, band leader for ''The Chris Gethard Show'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse David|title=Conversations About Death and Comedy With Chris Gethard|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/01/conversations-about-death-comedy-with-gethard.html|website=Vulture|language=en|date=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 30, 2014 in Brooklyn, New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chris Gethard Ended Dating Affair And Married The Love Of His Life; Maintaining A Healthy Relationship With Wife And Career?|url=http://liverampup.com/entertainment/chris-gethard-ended-dating-affair-married-love-life-maintaining-healthy-relationship-wife-career.html|website=LIVERAMPUP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was performed by fellow ''Chris Gethard Show'' cast member, Murf Meyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gordon|first1=Arielle|title=BV interview w/ Chris Gethard: "In the end I always ask myself — what would Jeff Rosenstock do?"|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/bv-interview-chris-gethard-talks-going-live-keeping-things-weird-on-new-season-of-tcgs/|website=BrooklynVegan|accessdate=August 23, 2017|date=August 1, 2017|quote=The people involved in the show are my family.

He is an avid fan of [[The Smiths]] and has two tattoos related to the band—[[Morrissey]]'s signature on his right shoulder (based on an actual signature he got in marker on his arm), and "It takes strength to be gentle and kind," a lyric from "[[I Know It's Over]]," on his right [[biceps]].&lt;ref name="Smiths tattoos"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gethard|first=Chris|title=This Charming Band|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/11/smiths_and_morrissey_biography_tony_fletcher_s_a_light_that_never_goes_out.html|newspaper=[[Slate (website)|Slate]]|date=November 30, 2012|accessdate=December 2, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202041219/http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/books/2012/11/smiths_and_morrissey_biography_tony_fletcher_s_a_light_that_never_goes_out.html|archivedate=December 2, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dewey Balfa''' (March 20, 1927 – June 17, 1992) was an [[Americans|American]] [[Cajun]] fiddler and singer who contributed significantly to the popularity of [[Cajun music]]. Balfa was born near [[Mamou, Louisiana]]. He is perhaps best known for his 1964 performance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]] with Gladius Thibodeaux and Vinus LeJeune, where the group received an enthusiastic response from over seventeen thousand audience members.  He sang the song "Parlez Nous à Boire" in the 1981 cult film ''[[Southern Comfort (1981 film)|Southern Comfort]]'', in which he had a small role.

==Early life==
Dewey Balfa was born in Grand Louis, Louisiana, a small community west of [[Mamou, Louisiana|Mamou]].&lt;ref name="savoy84p236"&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dewey Balfa and the Balfa Brothers|url=http://www.balfatoujours.com/brothers.html|accessdate=2009-10-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221131105/http://balfatoujours.com/brothers.html|archivedate=2009-02-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the son of Amay (née Ardoin) and Charles Balfa who were sharecroppers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dewey had learned most of his songs from his grandmother and father who was a fiddle player.&lt;ref name="savoy84p236" /&gt;

==Musical career==
During [[World War II]], Dewey worked in a shipyard in [[Orange, Texas]].&lt;ref name="savoy84p239"&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;  After returning in 1948, he and his brothers Will and Rodney formed the Musical Brothers.&lt;ref name="savoy84p239" /&gt;  In 1965, he formed [[The Balfa Brothers]] after an enthusiastic response from a performance at the [[Newport Folk Festival]].  This led to their first LP, produced by Swallow Records.

==Family==
Dewey Balfa married Hilda Frugé when he was 22 in 1949.  They had five children together:  Nelda, Roberta, Norma, Dewey Jr., and [[Christine Balfa|Christine]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Savoy84|Savoy 1984]], p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of whom became musicians.  Christine founded the band [[Balfa Toujours]] to continue the family tradition.

==Popularization of Cajun music==
Dewey Balfa appears in a documentary file entitled "Les Blues de Balfa" produced by Yasha Aginsky. In one scene, Balfa is shown with Nathan Abshire entertaining a group of school children. Balfa gives a short lecture concerning the origins of Cajun music:

"We are here to tell you a little bit about what a Cajun is. A Cajun is a person who his homeland was France.  Went into Nova Scotia, at the time Acadia, and settled there and was there for about a hundred years, and afterwards the British took over the territory and then the French-speaking people, the French descendants, known as the Acadians, came down to the South-Western part of Louisiana, and that was back in 1755. So over all of these years, your language, and your music has been preserved from daddy to son or daddy to daughter or momma to daughter."

==Life==
 [[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|left|300px|From left to right: [[Fidel Castro]], [[Osvaldo Dorticós Torrado]], [[Che Guevara]], [[Augusto Martínez Sánchez]], [[Antonio Núñez Jiménez]], [[William Alexander Morgan]] and Eloy Gutiérrez Menoyo.]] 
Gutiérrez Menoyo came from a Spanish family active in the [[Spanish Civil War]] and emigrated to Cuba following the victory of [[Francisco Franco]]′s forces with his family in 1945.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/26/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-rebel-commander-turned-dissident-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In Cuba in 1957, Eloy formed and commanded the rebel group [[Second National Front of Escambray]], which fought against president Batista′s dictatorial rule alongside [[Fidel Castro]]′s 26 July Revolutionary Movement and the 13th of March [[Directorio Revolucionario Estudiantil|Revolutionary Student Directorate]]. In March 1957, he and his brother, Carlos, were part of an attack on the Presidential Palace of [[Fulgencio Batista]]; his brother, Carlos, was killed in that attack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/26/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-rebel-commander-turned-dissident-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt; On January 3 of 1959, Eloy and his troops entered the City of [[Havana, Cuba]] and few days before [[Fidel Castro]] did and Eloy was hailed as one of the ''Commanders Of The Revolution''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/26/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-rebel-commander-turned-dissident-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt; Eloy's own army was absorbed into the army of Fidel Castro but Eloy was permitted to retain the rank of 'Major' which was the highest rank in Cuba at the time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, Eloy and many of his senior officers were never offered a post in the Castro Administration.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; While being on the outside and looking in, Eloy grew dissatisfied with the Castro Administration and in September–October 1959, Eloy and some of his men from the old 1st Version of the Second National Front - which was formed in 1957 as a pro-Castro group - now form the 2nd Version of the Second National Front - which was an anti-Castro group.

However, in January 1961, events took a turn against these anti-Castro 2nd Version members and now Eloy and about 12 military and civilian supporters took to a boat and fled to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; Eloy would settle in the City of [[Miami, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; While in Florida, Eloy helped form [[Alpha 66]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PAUL HAVEN, Associated Press |url=http://www.newstimes.com/news/world/article/Cuban-dissident-Eloy-Gutierrez-Menoyo-dies-at-77-3984074.php |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130130053501/http://www.newstimes.com/news/world/article/Cuban-dissident-Eloy-Gutierrez-Menoyo-dies-at-77-3984074.php |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-30 |title=Cuban dissident Eloy Gutierrez-Menoyo dies at 77 |publisher=NewsTimes |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citizen-times.com/usatoday/article/1661611 |title=Cuban dissident Eloy Gutierrez-Menoyo dies at 77 &amp;#124; The Asheville Citizen-Times |publisher=citizen-times.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formed in January–February 1962, Alpha 66 was created just too late to take part in April 1961 [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the death of [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, Eloy led an armed incursion into Cuba in December 1964, but was captured, jailed, and abused, on one occasion being beaten nearly to death by guards.&lt;ref&gt;Armando Valladares, Against All Hope (New York: Knopf, 1986), pp. 194-96.&lt;/ref&gt; After 22 years in prison, Eloy was freed in 1986 after a petition by the Spanish Government.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt; Eloy then went into exile in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/26/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-rebel-commander-turned-dissident-dies.html&lt;/ref&gt; Eloy then returned to Miami, Florida where he formed Cambio Cubano or Cuban Change in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/10/26/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-rebel-commander-turned-dissident-dies/ |title=Eloy Gutierrez-Menoyo, Cuban rebel commander turned dissident, dies at age 77 |publisher=Fox News |date= |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Eloy left the USA and returned to Cuba where he would remain for the rest of his life as a "tolerated dissident".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/27/world/americas/eloy-gutierrez-menoyo-cuban-dissident-dies-at-77.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Eloy would have at least three wives.

'''Henry Eustace McCulloch''' (December 6, 1816 – March 12, 1895) was a soldier in the [[Texas Revolution]], a [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Ranger]], and a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the army of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]] during the [[American Civil War]].

==Early life==
McCulloch was born in [[Rutherford County, Tennessee]], one of twelve children of Alexander McCulloch and Frances Fisher LeNoir. Henry's father Alexander, a [[Yale University]] graduate, was a descendant of Captain [[Nicolas Martiau]], the French Huguenot settler of Jamestown, Virginia and ancestor of President George Washington.  Alexander was also an officer on Brig. Gen. [[John Coffee]]'s staff during the [[Creek War]] of 1813 and 1814 in [[Alabama]]; his mother was a daughter of a prominent [[Virginia]] [[Planter (American South)|planter]]. The family had been wealthy, politically influential, and socially prominent in [[North Carolina]] before the [[American Revolution]], but Alexander McCulloch had wasted much of his inheritance and was unable even to educate his sons. (Two of Henry McCulloch's older brothers briefly attended a school in Tennessee taught by their neighbor, [[Sam Houston]].) After several moves, the family settled at [[Dyersburg, Tennessee|Dyersburg]], where one of their closest neighbors was [[David Crockett]]—a great influence on both McCulloch and his older brother, [[Benjamin McCulloch|Ben McCulloch]], who also would become a Confederate brigadier general.

==Texas career==
Henry McCulloch shared in his brother Ben's economic attempts in the 1830s, including transporting goods by raft on the Mississippi, once all the way to [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]]. When Davy Crockett went to Texas in 1835, Henry McCulloch and his brother made plans to meet Crockett's [[Tennessee Boys]] at [[Nacogdoches, Texas|Nacogdoches]] on Christmas Day. However, Ben contracted measles and was bedridden for several weeks and while ill convinced his brother Henry to return to Tennessee in November 1835. Luckily, the illness kept them from arriving with Crockett at the [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|Alamo]].

In 1838, both Henry and [[Ben McCulloch]] were making a living as surveyors. They also made a reputations as Indian fighters. Both took part in the [[Battle Creek Fight]] against the [[Comanche]] Indians in [[Navarro County, Texas|Navarro County]], also known as "The Surveyors' Fight". In 1839, Henry McCulloch was on the [[muster roll]] of Capt. [[Mathew Caldwell]]'s "Gonzales Rangers". Also in 1839, Ben was elected to the [[Republic of Texas]] House of Representatives after a contentious campaign that included assorted slanders between the candidates. As a result, Ben fought a rifle [[duel]] with his opponent, [[Reuben Ross]] and received a permanently crippling wound in the arm. The matter was considered closed but it flared up again the following year, this time involving Henry, who killed Ross with a pistol.

On August 20, 1840, McCulloch married [[Jane Isabella Ashby]], daughter of [[John Miller Ashby]] and [[Mary Harris Garnett]] of Kentucky, who had been early settlers in the [[DeWitt Colony]], which was centered on Gonzales. They had twelve children, most of whom remained in Texas.

Later in 1840, McCulloch took part in the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], acting as a scout against the [[Comanche]]s and being wounded. When a Mexican raiding force under Gen. [[Adrian Woll]] invested San Antonio in September 1842, he served as [[First Lieutenant#United States|First Lieutenant]] of a company of volunteers from [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]]. He again operated as a scout, including infiltrating enemy lines, and commanded a spy company at the [[Battle of Salado Creek]]. With his brother, Ben, he subsequently took part in the failed [[Somervell expedition]] and both men were ordered to leave shortly before most of the Texans were captured at [[Ciudad Mier|Mier, Mexico]] in [[Tamaulipas]], December 25, 1842.

He was elected sheriff of [[Gonzales, Texas|Gonzales]] in 1843 and also opened a mercantile business there. The following year, he moved his family permanently to Seguin.

There are several letters written in the 1890s (now in the possession of the [[Texas State Library]]) in which McCulloch describes his (and his brother's) activities during the [[Texas Revolution]] and under the [[Republic of Texas|Republic]].

In December 1847, McCulloch was in command of a Ranger company in [[Burnet County, Texas|Burnet County]] and established what became [[Fort Croghan]]. When the [[Mexican–American War|War with Mexico]] began, he took command of a volunteer company patrolling the same area of the western frontier against Indian raids. He continued this service after the war as captain of a company of Texas Mounted Volunteers out of [[Fort Murrill]], and also operating a Ranger post in [[Kimble County, Texas|Kimble County]].

He served in both houses of the [[Legislature of Texas|Texas Legislature]] from [[Guadalupe County, Texas|Guadalupe County]], being elected to the House of Representatives in 1853 and the Senate in 1855. Among other subjects, he introduced bills to regulate the use by slaveowners of "manager [[slavery|slaves]]" and to acquire the Alamo as a state monument. He then received an appointment as U.S. marshal from President [[James Buchanan|Buchanan]] for the eastern district of Texas, and was a delegate from Guadalupe County to the Texas [[secession]] convention in January 1861. {His brother Ben had been 1852 [[US Marshal]] for the eastern District of Texas}

==Civil War==
A few days after the convention voted for secession from the union on February 1, 1861 (though before the necessary referendum), the Texas Committee of Public Safety established a Provisional Army, in which McCulloch received a commission as [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. On March 4, he was appointed commander of the 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, also known (especially to its officers) as the [[1st Texas Mounted Rifles]]. The unit was recruited from several counties in central Texas to serve for twelve months and was the first Texas cavalry regiment to enter Confederate service. Its mission was to maintain a line of patrol from the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] southwest to the junction of the [[Concho River|Concho]] and [[North Concho River]]s, a point near present-day [[San Angelo, Texas|San Angelo]].

McCulloch was acknowledged by his superiors and others for his emphasis on precise discipline and gentlemanly conduct in his regiment. His training methods included complex cavalry and infantry maneuvers as well as [[sabre]]-fighting and the proper care of horses and equipment. Many Texas units maintained only lax rules of propriety and organization, but the 1st Texas remained a cohesive and loyal unit, disbanding only under the proper orders.

After receiving word of the action at [[Fort Sumter]], McCulloch moved five companies to confront any federal troops remaining in Texas who had not yet embarked at the port of [[Indianola, Texas|Indianola]], but en route he received orders from Maj. Gen. [[Earl Van Dorn]] to intercept a federal force northwest of San Antonio. On May 9, McCulloch's troops, numbering some 1,300, captured the [[8th U.S. Infantry]] near [[San Lucas Springs, Texas|San Lucas Springs]].

Late in June, McCulloch crossed the Red River with Maj. [[Edward Burleson (Confederate soldier)|Edward Burleson]] to ensure the friendliness (or at least the neutrality) of the [[Wichita Indians|Wichita]] and [[Caddo Indians]], following this with a warning that any raids across the river into Texas would bring retaliation—and over the following year, there were in fact a number of engagements between elements of the 1st Texas and Indian raiding parties. The success of the Texas troops in suppressing these raids is shown in the fact that the number of raids actually decreased during 1861 and 1862 from the numbers reported in previous years.

In September 1861, McCulloch, now a brigadier general, assumed temporary command of the Department of Texas until the arrival of Brig. Gen. [[Paul O. Hébert]], and in December was named to command the new Western Military District, comprising that part of the state west and south of San Antonio. Early the next year, he was ordered to assume co-command of [[Texas State Troops]] being sent to Arkansas.

On September 6, 1862, following the death near [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] of his co-commander, [[Allison Nelson]] of [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], McCulloch took command of the new [[Texas Division]] and organized it into four brigades, ultimately taking command of the Third Brigade himself while the division as a whole was under the command of Maj. Gen. [[John George Walker|John G. Walker]]. The division was attached to the District of Arkansas, Trans-Mississippi Department, and by April 1863 it was in [[Louisiana]], where it took part in the [[Red River Campaign]], the [[Camden Expedition]], and the [[Battle of Milliken's Bend]], which was an early phase of the [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg campaign]]. In July 1863, the division arrived in [[Alexandria, Louisiana]], where McCulloch was replaced by Col. [[George M. Flournoy]]. McCulloch was approached as a candidate for governor of Texas late that summer, but declined in order to remain on active service.

In 1864 and 1865, McCulloch was again in north Texas and in charge of the Western Sub-District of Texas (the entire District now being under the command of Maj. Gen. [[John B. Magruder]]), where he was active not only in dealing with Indian raids but in pursuing and arresting Confederate deserters and bushwhackers. At the end of the war, on his return to his home in Seguin, he found it necessary to travel with an armed escort because of threats against his life by deserters.

==Postbellum career==
In 1874, he was active early in the administration of Gov. [[Richard Coke]], especially in helping to physically remove [[Edmund J. Davis]] from the executive offices. In 1876, as a reward for his services to Texas, he was appointed superintendent of the Deaf and Dumb Asylum (later the [[Texas School for the Deaf]]) in Austin. Though a respected military commander, he proved an inept civil administrator and a legislative investigation forced him to resign his position in 1879; he was succeeded in that office by Col. [[John Salmon Ford|John S. "Rip" Ford]], his old commander in the Rangers.

The retired general apparently enjoyed his retirement, frequently receiving distinguished visitors in his home, giving interviews and engaging in correspondence with inquiring historical writers, and was in regular demand as a speaker at July Fourth festivities throughout central Texas. He was also a trustee in the local [[Methodist Episcopal Church, South|Methodist Church]]. Henry E. McCulloch died March 12, 1895 at [[Rockport, Texas]] and was buried in San Geronimo Cemetery in Seguin. He received a full masonic funeral, having been an active freemason after the War in the Guadalupe County lodge. His widow, Jane Ashby McCulloch died in 1896.

Camp Henry McCulloch was located at "Nuner's Mott", about four miles north of the present city limits of [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]] in [[Victoria County, Texas|Victoria County]]. It was the training site in the fall of 1861 for several infantry and cavalry companies of the 6th Texas Infantry Regiment, CSA (at the time when McCulloch was interim commander of the Department of Texas). A Texas state historical marker was erected at the site.

==Venezuela and Haiti==
28 December 1815: Bolivar arrived at Les Cayes ten days before the arrival of the fleet from Cartagena. He was received with great pomp by the commander of the arrondissement, General Marion, seconded by Colonel Poisson Paris, commander of the place.

26 January 1816: a letter from President Pétion to General Marion: "Reasons which I should not confide to the paper, my dear General, but which tend greatly to consolidate the Republic, require me to invite you hereby to the disposition of General Bolivar two thousand muskets and their bayonets, of those deposited in the arsenal of Les Cayes by M. Brion; you will also place at your disposal the most cartridges and rifle stones that you can, with mostly cartridges, only a small quantity.

You will cause these objects to be taken out as a consignment made at Grand’Anse, by loading them on board a vessel, the captain whom you will place on board and the crew will be worthy of your confidence, and this building once outside, and a way not to be seen, will prolong that which General [[Simon Bolivar]] destined to receive these objects, and will transmit them on board. It is proper that this should not be transpired, and I am guided by the precautions you will take in this respect.”

January 26, 1816: Letter from President Pétion to General Marion: "I recommend to you, my dear General, to have a daily ration of bread and cured meats delivered by the Cayes administration to the unfortunate refugees of Cartagena and dependencies. It is an act of humanity worthy of the government of the Republic.”

27 January 1816: Les Cayes - Letter from J. Marimon to General Marion, in view of the excesses committed by several armed corsairs in Cartagena ... "The undersigned begs you, General, to order the captains of the boats under the Carthaginian flag sic) to deposit in your hands their patents or letters of mark, to refrain from displaying their flag, temporarily and until receiving the orders that President Pétion will deign to communicate to you on this subject ... "

January 30, 1816: Letter of Pétion to General Marion: "I have received, my dear General, your letter of the 27th of this month, with the documents it contains. I agree with the measure you have taken with regard to the vessels under the [[Carthaginian flag]], which are in the port of Les Cayes, tending to prevent any act which might compromise the Republic in the hospitality...”

February 5, 1816: Letter of Pétion to General Marion: "At the request made to you by the Congressional Commissioner of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|United States of New Granada]], I urge you, in all your conduct, not to lose for it is important that the system of perfect neutrality which we profess should be followed exactly, and to avoid any misunderstandings which might give uneasiness to any other government, which is of our utmost importance."

In 1816, with Haitian soldiers and vital material support, Bolívar landed in Venezuela and fulfilled his promise to President Alexandre Pétion to free Spanish America's slaves on 2 June 1816.&lt;ref name="Bushnell, David 1970"&gt;Bushnell, David.

== Population ==
{{main article|Demographics of Indonesia}}
As of 2018, [http://www.mallumedia.info/2018/08/loss-of-life-in-indonesia-earthquake.html Indonesians] make up 3.5% of [[World population|world total population]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country|title=Population by Country (2018) - Worldometers|website=www.worldometers.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and Indonesia is the fourth most populous country after [[China]], [[India]] and the [[United States]].

Despite a fairly effective [[family planning]] program that has been in place since the 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Witton |first=Patrick |title=Indonesia |publisher=Lonely Planet |year=2003 |location=Melbourne |page=47 |isbn=1-74059-154-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the decade ending in 2010, Indonesia's population growth was 1.49 percent. At that rate, Indonesia's population is projected to surpass the present population of the United States and would - if the current US population did not rise - become the world's third biggest after China and India by 2043.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Indonesia Population Approaching U.S. Revives Birth Control |first1=Shamim |last1=Adam |author2=Berni Moestafa |author3=Novrida Manurung |date=28 January 2014 |newspaper=Bloomberg.com |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-01-27/indonesia-facing-populace-larger-than-u-s-revives-birth-control |accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family planning already revitalised based on the 1967 program to avoid Indonesia becoming the world's third most populous country.

With a population of 150 million, [[Java]] is home to 51 percent of the Indonesian population, and is the [[List of islands by population|most populous island]] on [[Earth]]. The Indonesian capital city, [[Jakarta]], is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the centre of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the centre of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally.

Other major island of Indonesia are [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo|Kalimantan]], [[Sulawesi]] and [[West Papua (region)|Papua]] that take other 49 percent of Indonesian population. There are also other small populated island(s) such as [[Bali]], [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], [[Madura island|Madura]], [[Nias island|Nias]], [[Maluku islands|Maluku]], [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], [[Riau Islands]] and others.

=== Ethnic groups ===
[[File:TV News Media in GBK Stadium, Jakarta, MetroTV.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Indonesian people attending a [[football]] match]]
There are over 300 ethnic groups in [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuoni - Far East, A world of difference. Page 99. Published 1999 by Kuoni Travel &amp; JPM Publications&lt;/ref&gt; 95% of those are of [[Native Indonesians|Native Indonesian]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pribumi |work=Encyclopedia of Modern Asia |publisher=Macmillan Reference USA |url=http://www.bookrags.com/research/pribumi-ema-05/ |accessdate=5 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest ethnic group in [http://www.mallumedia.info/2018/08/loss-of-life-in-indonesia-earthquake.html Indonesia] is the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] who make up nearly 51% of the total population. The Javanese are concentrated on the island of [[Java]] but millions have migrated to other islands throughout the archipelago because of the [[transmigration program]].&lt;ref name="SuryadinataArifin2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Suryadinata|first1=Leo|author2=Evi Nurvidya Arifin|author3=Aris Ananta|title=Indonesia's Population: Ethnicity and Religion in a Changing Political Landscape|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nFckUneBbRIC|accessdate=7 August 2016|date=19 April 2003|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-230-212-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]], and [[Madurese people|Madurese]] are the next largest groups in the country.&lt;ref name="SuryadinataArifin2003"/&gt; Many ethnic groups, particularly in [[Kalimantan]] and [[Papua (Indonesian province)|Papua]], have only hundreds of members. Most of the local languages belong to [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] language family, although a significant number, particularly in [[Maluku Islands]] and [[Western New Guinea|West Papua]] belong to [[Papuan languages]]. The [[Chinese Indonesians]] population makes up a little less than 1% of the total Indonesian population according to the 2000 census.&lt;ref name="SuryadinataArifin2003"/&gt; Some of these [[Chinese Indonesian|Indonesians of Chinese descent]] speak various [[Chinese dialects]], most notably [[Hokkien]] and [[Hakka (language)|Hakka]].

The classification of ethnic groups in Indonesia is not rigid and in some cases unclear due to migrations, cultural and linguistic influences; for example some may consider Bantenese and [[Cirebonese]] to be members of [[Javanese people]], however some others argue that they are different ethnic groups altogether since they have their own distinct dialects. This is the same case with [[Baduy people]] that share many cultural similarities with the [[Sundanese people]]. An example of hybrid ethnicity is the [[Betawi people]], descended not only from marriages between different peoples in Indonesia but also with foreign origin like Arab, Chinese and Indian migrants since the era of colonial Batavia (Jakarta).

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
{{main article|Indonesian language}}

[[File:Serat bratayudha.jpg|thumb|right|200px|An example of [[Javanese script]]]]
The Indonesian language (''bahasa Indonesia'' {{IPA-ms|baˈhasa indoneˈsia|}}) is the official language of [[Indonesia]]. It is a [[standard language|standardized]] [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of [[Malay language|Malay]], an [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language]] that has been used as a [[lingua franca]] in the Indonesian archipelago for centuries. Most Indonesians also speak one of more than [[Languages of Indonesia|700 indigenous languages]].&lt;ref name="policy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2013/10/28/indigenous-language-policy-a-national-cultural-strategy.html |title=Indigenous language policy as a national cultural strategy |author=Setiono Sugiharto |date=28 October 2013 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post|accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aclweb.org/anthology/I/I08/I08-7014.pdf |title=Resources Report on Languages of Indonesia |author=Hammam Riza|year=2008 |accessdate=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Indonesians, aside from speaking the national language, are fluent in another [[languages of Indonesia|regional language]] (examples include [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]] and others), which are commonly used at home and within the local community. Most formal education, and nearly all national media and other forms of communication, are conducted in Indonesian. In [[East Timor]], which was an Indonesian province from 1975 to 1999, Indonesian is recognised by the constitution as one of the two working languages (the other being English), alongside the official languages of [[Tetum language|Tetum]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

=== Religion ===
{{main article|Religion in Indonesia}}

[[File:Minangkabau wedding 2.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Minangkabau people|Minang]] wedding]]
[[Indonesia]] is constitutionally a secular state and the first principle of [[Indonesia]]'s philosophical foundation, [[Pancasila Indonesia|Pancasila]], is "belief in the one and only [[God]]".

=== Literature ===
{{Main article|Indonesian literature}}
Indonesian literature can refer to literature produced in the [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesian archipelago]]. It is also used to refer more broadly to literature produced in areas with common language roots based on the [[Malay language]] (of which Indonesian is one [[kinship|scion]]). This would extend the reach to the [[Maritime Southeast Asia]], including Indonesia, but also other nations with a common language such as [[Malaysia]] and [[Brunei]], as well as population within other nations such as the [[Malay people]] living in [[Singapore]].

There are also works written in and about Indonesia in unrelated languages. There are several languages and several distinct but related literary traditions within the geographical boundaries of the modern nation of Indonesia. For example, the island of Java has its own [[Javanese people|Javanese]] pre-national cultural and literary history. There are also [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], and [[Batak (Indonesia)|Batak]] or [[Madurese people|Madurese]] traditions. Indonesia also has a [[colonialism|colonial]] history of [[Netherlands|Dutch]], [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Japanese occupation of Indonesia|Japanese occupation]], as well as a history of [[Islam]]ic influence that brought its own texts, linguistic and literary influences. There is also an ''[[oral literature]]'' tradition in the area.

The phrase Indonesian literature is used in this article to refer to [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] as written in the nation of Indonesia, but also covers literature written in an earlier form of the Indonesian language i.e. [[Malay language]] written in the [[Dutch East Indies]].

=== Architecture ===
{{Main article|Architecture of Indonesia}}

[[File:Traditional Toraja House.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Tongkonan]], [[Toraja]] traditional house]]
The '''Architecture of Indonesia''' reflects the diversity of [[Culture of Indonesia|cultural]], [[History of Indonesia|historical]] and [[Geography of Indonesia|geographic]] influences that have shaped [[Indonesia]] as a whole. Invaders, colonizers, missionaries, merchants and traders brought cultural changes that had a profound effect on building styles and techniques.

Traditionally, the most significant foreign influence has been Indian. However, Chinese, Arab, and European influences have also played significant roles in shaping Indonesian architecture. Religious architecture varies from indigenous forms to mosques, temples, and churches. The sultans and other rulers built palaces. There is a substantial [[colonial architecture of Indonesia|legacy of colonial architecture in Indonesian cities]]. Independent Indonesia has seen the development of new paradigms for postmodern and contemporary architecture.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main article|Indonesian cuisine}}

[[File:Tumpeng Feast.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Tumpeng]] rice, the national dish of Indonesia.]]
'''Indonesian cuisine''' is one of the most vibrant and colourful cuisines in the world, full of intense flavor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=About Indonesian food | date=6 September 2013 |publisher=SBS Australia| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/food/article/2008/07/01/about-indonesian-food |accessdate=26 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is diverse, in part because [[Indonesia]] is composed of approximately 6,000 populated islands of the total 18,000 in the world's largest archipelago,&lt;ref name="epicurina"&gt;[http://www.epicurina.com "Indonesian Cuisine."] [http://www.epicurina.com Epicurina.com].

The cuisines of Eastern Indonesia are similar to Polynesian and Melanesian cuisine. Elements of Chinese cuisine can be seen in Indonesian cuisine: foods such as ''bakmi'' (noodles), ''[[bakso]]'' (meat or fish balls), and ''[[lumpia]]'' (spring rolls) have been completely assimilated.

== Genetics ==
{{also|Proto-Malay#Indonesia}}
[[File:Natives of Halmahera Island.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Togutil people|Togutil]] man.]]
The skin colour of Indonesian people ranges from fair skin with yellowish undertone to light brown to very dark brown or black skin colour. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Writing in 1985, Archaeologist [[Peter Bellwood]] noted several theories for Indonesian ancestory including "Australo-Melanesian and Mongoloid Evolution". the "Southern Mongoloid Replacement Model" and the "Indo-Malaysian Continuity Model" concluding that "research still has a long way to go in this region".&lt;!--p.83 to 95--&gt;&lt;ref name="Bellwood, Peter 1985"&gt;Bellwood, Peter.

Most Indonesian people are genetically close to [[Asians]] while the more eastern one goes how more people show [[Melanesian]] affinity. Geneticist [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]] claims that there is a genetic division between [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]ns.&lt;ref name="Cavalli-Sforza1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavalli-Sforza|first1=L.

The Rise of Agricultural Civilization in China, Sino-Platonic Papers 175, Zhou Jixu, citing Ho Ping-ti, {{ISBN|0-226-34524-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other geneticists have found evidence for four separate populations, carrying distinct sets of non-recombining [[Y chromosome]] lineages, within the traditional Mongoloid category: [[North Asians]], [[Han Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and [[Southeast Asians]].&lt;ref&gt;TAJIMA Atsushi, PAN I.-Hung, FUCHAROEN Goonnapa, FUCHAROEN Supan, MATSUO Masafumi, TOKUNAGA Katsushi, JUJI Takeo, HAYAMI Masanori, OMOTO Keiichi, HORAI Satoshi, "Three major lineages of Asian Y chromosomes: implications for the peopling of east and southeast Asia," ''Human Genetics'' 2002, vol. 110, no1, pp. 80-88&lt;/ref&gt; The complexity of genetic data has led to doubt about the usefulness of the concept of a Mongoloid race itself, since distinctive East Asian features may represent separate lineages and arise from environmental adaptations or retention of common proto-Eurasian ancestral characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, Mongoloid&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Japanese name|Iwasaki}}
{{nihongo|'''Iwasaki Yatarō'''|岩崎 弥太郎||extra=January 9, 1835 – February 7, 1885}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[financier]] and [[shipping]] [[industrialist]], and the founder of [[Mitsubishi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Obituary|work=The Times|issue=31373|date=18 February 1885|location=London|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Iwasaki was born in a provincial farming family in [[Aki, Kōchi|Aki]], [[Tosa Province|Tosa]] province (now [[Kōchi Prefecture]]), the great-grandson of a man who had sold his family's [[samurai]] status in obligation of debts. Iwasaki began his career as an employee of the Tosa clan. The clan had business interests in many parts of Japan.

Iwasaki left for Edo (now [[Tokyo]]) aged nineteen for his education. He interrupted his studies a year later when his father was seriously injured in a dispute with the village headman. When the local magistrate refused to hear his case, Iwasaki accused him of corruption. Iwasaki was sent to prison for seven months. After his release, Iwasaki was without a job for a time before finding work as a teacher.

Returning to Edo, he socialised with political activists and studied under the reformist [[Yoshida Toyo]], who influenced him with ideas of opening and developing the then-closed nation through industry and foreign trade. Through Yoshida, he found work as a clerk for the Tosa government, and bought back his family's samurai status. He was promoted to the top position at the Tosa clan's trading office in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], responsible for trading camphor oil and paper to buy ships, weapons, and ammunition.

Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, which forced the disbandment of the [[shogunate]]'s business interests, Iwasaki travelled to [[Osaka]] and leased the trading rights for the Tosa clan's Tsukumo Trading Company. The company changed its name to [[Mitsubishi]] in 1873.

==Mitsubishi==

Iwasaki  became president of Mitsubishi in March 1870. The name Mitsubishi is a compound of ''mitsu'' ("three") and ''hishi'' (literally, "water chestnut", often used in Japanese to denote a diamond or rhombus). Its emblem was a combination of the Iwasaki family crest, showing three overlapping [[lozenge]]s, and the crest with three oak leaves, arranged in a threefold [[rotational symmetry]], of the Yamauchi family, who were leaders of the Tosa clan, which controlled the part of Shikoku where Yatarō was born.

In 1874–1875, Iwasaki was contracted by the Japanese government to transport Japanese soldiers and war materials. The Japanese government purchased a number of ships for the [[Japanese Expedition of 1874 to Taiwan]] against Paiwan Aborigines in southeast Taiwan, and these ships were later given to Mitsubishi after the expedition was finished in 1875. This created strong links between Mitsubishi and the Japanese government that ensured the new company's success. In return, Mitsubishi supported the new Japanese government and transported troops who defeated the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] in 1877. Thus the success of Mitsubishi became intertwined with the rise of the modern Japanese state. 

Subsequently he invested in mining, ship repair, and finance. In 1884 he took a lease on the Nagasaki Shipyard, which allowed the company to undertake shipbuilding on a large scale, and renamed it Nagasaki Shipyard &amp; Machinery Works.

Iwasaki Yatarō often gave dinners for dignitaries, spending a huge amount of money on these occasions, but he also made many friends who later helped him by doing favors.

Iwasaki died of [[stomach cancer]] aged 50, and was succeeded as the head of the family business first by his brother, and later his son, Hisaya.

==In fiction==
Iwasaki serves as the secondary protagonist of the 49th [[NHK]] [[Taiga drama]], ''[[Ryōmaden]]'', focusing on his activities during the [[Bakumatsu]], and also serves as the framing narrator of the story. He is portrayed by [[Teruyuki Kagawa]].

In 2017 he won the [[Levchin Prize]] for Real World Cryptography "for the development of AES and SHA3".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realworldcrypto.com/levchinprize&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Daemen graduated in electro-mechanical [[engineering]] at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]. He subsequently joined the [[COSIC]] research group, and has worked on the design and cryptanalysis of [[block cipher]]s, [[stream cipher]]s and [[cryptographic hash function]]s. Daemen completed his PhD in 1995, at which point he worked for a year at [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] in [[Beerse]], [[Belgium]]. He subsequently worked at the [[BACOB]] bank, [[Banksys]], [[Proton World]] and then [[STMicroelectronics]]. Since 2015 Daemen has been professor at the [[Radboud University Nijmegen]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ru.nl/nieuws-agenda/nieuws/vm/icis/cybersecurity/2015/cryptograaf-joan-daemen-hoogleraar-radboud/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joyce Fairbairn''',  {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|CM}} (born November 6, 1939) was a [[Senate of Canada|Canadian senator]] and was the first woman to serve as [[Leader of the Government in the Senate (Canada)|Leader of the Government in the Senate]].

Fairbairn worked as a journalist in the Parliamentary Press Gallery in [[Ottawa]] before being hired as a legislative assistant to [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] in 1970. In 1981, she became Communications Coordinator in the [[Canadian Prime Minister's Office|Prime Minister's Office]]. On June 29, 1984, just prior to leaving office, Trudeau recommended her for appointment as a [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] senator for [[Alberta]], her home province.

She has also had various positions in the Liberal Party, including Vice-Chair of the National and Western Liberal Caucus from 1984 to 1990, and Co-chair of the Liberal Party of Canada Election Readiness Committee in 1991.

When the Liberals returned to power after the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]], Prime Minister [[Jean Chrétien]] appointed Fairbairn to the [[Canadian Cabinet]] as Government Leader in the Senate and Minister with special responsibility for Literacy. She served in Cabinet until 1997. She has been Chair of the Standing Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, and the Special Senate Committee on the Anti-terrorism Act. She sat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture and Forestry until June 2012.&lt;ref name=leave&gt;{{cite news |last=McGregor |first=Glen |title=Liberal Senator Joyce Fairbairn to take sick leave after Alzheimer's diagnosis |url=https://ottawacitizen.com/health/Liberal+Senator+Joyce+Fairbairn+take+sick+leave+after/7130117/story.html |accessdate=August 23, 2012 |newspaper=Ottawa Citizen |date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, it was reported that Fairbairn has taken indefinite [[sick leave]] from the Senate due to the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease]].&lt;ref name=leave/&gt; It was subsequently revealed that Fairbairn had been declared legally incompetent in February but had continued voting in the Senate until June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Liberal senator Fairbairn allowed to vote months after dementia diagnosis |url=https://thestarphoenix.com/health/Sick+senator+allowed+vote+four+months+after+diagnosed+with/7152675/story.html |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |newspaper=The Star Phoenix |date=August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fairbairn case has led to calls for the Senate to establish rules to address similar situations should they arise in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Smith |first=Joanna |title=Joyce Fairbairn’s voting shakes public’s confidence, says Tory senator |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1248232--senator-joyce-fairbairn-deserves-privacy-says-liberal-senate-leader |accessdate=August 29, 2012 |newspaper=Toronto Star |date=August 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced on November 30, 2012, that she had tendered her resignation to the Governor General with effect from January 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Galloway |first=Gloria |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/liberal-senator-joyce-fairbairn-set-to-retire-following-dementia-diagnosis/article5857138/ |title=Liberal Senator Joyce Fairbairn set to retire following dementia diagnosis |work=The Globe and Mail |date=November 30, 2012 |accessdate=November 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 11, 2018, it was announced that the new middle school in Lethbridge, Alberta would be named after Fairbairn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://lethbridgeherald.com/news/lethbridge-news/2018/03/12/new-public-middle-school-named-after-senator-joyce-fairbairn/|title=New public middle school named after Senator Joyce Fairbairn|date=2018-03-12|work=The Lethbridge Herald - News and Sports from around Lethbridge|access-date=2018-04-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It will be named the ''Senator Joyce Fairbairn Middle School'', and is set to open in the fall of 2018.

==Publication history==
[[Image:Ka-Zar by Jack Kirby.jpg|190px|thumb|left|Cover to ''the X-Men'' #10 the first appearance of Ka-Zar and his [[Smilodon|sabretooth tiger]], [[Zabu]].&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Jack Kirby]].]]
The second Ka-Zar started as a similar character, but reminiscent of both [[Tarzan]] and of writer-artist [[Joe Kubert]]'s 1950s [[caveman]] character, [[Tor (comic book)|Tor]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]] in ''[[Uncanny X-Men|The X-Men]]'' #10 (March 1965), he lives in the [[dinosaur]]-populated [[Savage Land]], which was hidden beneath [[Antarctica]] by [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrials]]. The character was based on his pulp magazine namesake only to the extent that he used the same name and rough "jungle lord" concept, and Lee has admitted that he had never even read any of the original Ka-Zar stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| pages= 19–20|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally written as a primitive and belligerent savage who spoke in broken English, Ka-Zar later became more articulate and civilized, although he retained a certain degree of distrust toward civilization and was generally wary of outside visitors to the Savage Land. Kevin Plunder refers to himself as the "Lord of the Savage Land," a phrase others have adopted, but this is not a formal title.

Ka-Zar's first solo story was published in ''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #19 (1969), and the character had features in the black-and-white magazine ''[[Savage Tales]]'' and the color title ''[[Astonishing Tales]]''.  He has had five self-titled series, the first published in 1970–1971 (three issues, mostly reprints), the second, which continued the storyline from ''Astonishing Tales'', in 1974-1977 (20 issues, subtitled ''Lord of the Hidden Jungle'') by [[Mike Friedrich]], [[Gerry Conway]], and [[Doug Moench]], the third in 1981-1984, ''Ka-Zar the Savage'', (34 issues) by [[Bruce Jones (comics)|Bruce Jones]] and [[Mike Carlin]], the fourth in 1997-1998 (20 issues) written by [[Mark Waid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=20710 Ka-Zar, 1997], Pipeline, [[Comic Book Resources]], April 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the fifth in 2011 (5 issue miniseries) written by [[Paul Jenkins (writer)|Paul Jenkins]].

==Fictional character biography==

Ka-Zar is Kevin Reginald, Lord Plunder, born in Castle Plunder, [[Kentish Town]], [[London]], [[England]]. He is the eldest son of Lord Robert Plunder, the [[England|English]] [[nobility|nobleman]] who discovered the [[Savage Land]]. After his mother had died and his father was killed by the barbaric Man-Ape natives of the Savage Land, Plunder was found and raised by the [[smilodon|sabertooth tiger]] [[Zabu]], who possesses near-human intelligence thanks to a [[mutation]] caused by radioactive mists. "Ka-Zar" means "Son of the Tiger" in the language of the Man-Apes. Ka-Zar and Zabu are constant partners. Ka-Zar became an expert hunter, trapper, and fisherman, living off the wild land.

In the Savage Land, some territories are populated by several human or humanoid tribes, and while most of them are on friendly terms with Ka-Zar, some of them consider him an outlander and an enemy. He acts more like an unofficial general protector, preventing outside commercial exploitation, such as [[poaching]] and [[mining]], as well as enforcing peace between tribes and serving as goodwill ambassador to friendly visitors.

The original [[X-Men]] discovered the Savage Land, and Ka-Zar encountered them, battling Maa-Gor for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; He then encountered [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] for the first time, and battled his brother Parnival, who had become the [[supervillain]] called the [[Plunderer (character)|Plunderer]].&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #12-14&lt;/ref&gt; He first battled [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]]'s [[Savage Land Mutates]] alongside the X-Men.&lt;ref&gt;''X-Men'' #61-63&lt;/ref&gt;  He then encountered the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]] for the first time, and battled Umbu the Unliving.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #109-111&lt;/ref&gt; He was once 'tricked' into confronting [[Spider-Man]] after [[J. Jonah Jameson]] convinced him that Spider-Man was a menace when the wall-crawler's memory was erased and he was tricked into working with [[Doctor Octopus]]. Spider-Man's memory was restored during the fight, with Ka-Zar subsequently apologizing for the mistake and proclaiming Spider-Man as the most valiant opponent he had ever fought.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #57&lt;/ref&gt; Ka-Zar then battled [[Kraven the Hunter]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly after this encounter, Ka-Zar encounters [[Zaladane]] and [[Garokk]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #3-5&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Savage Land became known to outsiders after the visit by the X-Men, many people began traveling to the territory. Ka-Zar has also become romantically involved with female visitors, the first being [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent Barbara Morse (who later became the Avenger named [[Mockingbird (Marvel Comics)|Mockingbird]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #8&lt;/ref&gt; He first battled [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]], and met the [[Man-Thing]].&lt;ref&gt;''Astonishing Tales'' #12-13&lt;/ref&gt; He then met Spider-Man once again, and battled the extraterrestrial [[Gog (Marvel Comics)|Gog]].&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #103-104&lt;/ref&gt; He next met the adventurer [[Shanna the She-Devil|Shanna O'Hara]],.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He battled [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]], and visited other dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' #14-20&lt;/ref&gt; He and his allies faded mysteriously from that other dimension,&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #115&lt;/ref&gt; then teamed with the X-Men to battle Zaladane and a reborn Garokk.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' #115-116&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar, during a search for the lost Zabu, later discovered Pangaea, an ancient refuge created by the Atlanteans.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; Ka-Zar and Shanna began to gradually fall in love.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #1-17&lt;/ref&gt;  He then battles [[Belasco (comics)|Belasco]] for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; After a meeting with [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] spies disguised as scientists, Ka-Zar is shot in the head, but survives.  He is flown to New York City, but escapes the plane at Kennedy Airport.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;  With no memory and no ability to speak, he wanders New York, saving lives and fighting crime.  His memory returns and he encounters Kraven The Hunter again, who has been released from prison by an A.I.M. agent to capture him.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #20&lt;/ref&gt; Saved by Shanna and Spider-Man, he is brought to the hospital where A.I.M. fakes his death in order to use him in a scheme.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #21-25&lt;/ref&gt;  Escaping with Spider-Man's aid, he and Shanna return to the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #26&lt;/ref&gt;  He later marries Shanna, who has taken the name Shanna the She-Devil.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29&lt;/ref&gt; During the ceremony, a war (incited by the machinations of Belasco) breaks out in Pangea, which ends when Ka-Zar and Shanna are banished.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #29-30&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother Parnival arrived in the Savage Land, searching for anti-metal Vibranium, and was apparently killed during his scheme (though much later turned up alive).&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #31-33&lt;/ref&gt;  During this scheme, a [[Nuwali]] transport device is uncovered, and Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu are transported to the Nuwali planet.  The Nuwali use human adrenalin to poison their rivals, and also reveal to Shanna that she is pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar the Savage'' #34&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar has teamed up with several of Marvel's heroes. The X-Men are recurrent visitors to the Savage Land and Ka-Zar has been a frequent ally, helping the mutant team defeat both inside and outside menaces such as [[Sauron (comics)|Sauron]] and Magneto. He has met Spider-Man on several occasions, one of which involved stopping [[Stegron|Stegron the Dinosaur Man]] from invading New York City with Savage Land dinosaurs. Ka-Zar has also assisted the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] in their attempt to repel the space conqueror [[Terminus (comics)|Terminus]], but while they rescued many [[Savage Land Races|natives]], they were unable to prevent the destruction of the Savage Land. Ka-Zar was rescued by the Avengers, but left the Savage Land for the civilized world.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #256-258&lt;/ref&gt; Together, he and Shanna had a son named Matthew. The territory was later reconstructed by the [[High Evolutionary]] using Garokk, and Ka-Zar and Shanna returned with their newborn and resumed their previous roles.&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men Annual'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar and Shanna separated for a time,&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar Graphic Novel''&lt;/ref&gt; but got back together before long. Ka-Zar fought and defeated [[Thanos]] in one of his many attempts to end life, and later sought the help of investigator [[Jessica Jones]] for assistance locating Zabu.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Alias (comics)|Alias]]'' #24 (September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Shanna and Ka-Zar find [[Skrull]]s mining the rare metal [[vibranium]] in the Savage Land. Soon afterward as part of the "[[Secret Invasion]]" storyline, a Skrull ship crashes in the Savage Land releasing earlier versions of modern superheroes (who claim to be the originals replaced by Skrulls for some time), and who have escaped. Shanna and Ka-Zar soon learn, however, that these are simply more Skrulls in disguise. Spider-Man soon encounters Ka-Zar, Shanna, Zabu, and some of the natives accusing them of being Skrulls. Just then, the Captain America from the ship attacked thinking the same for Spider-Man. Ka-Zar, Shanna, and Zabu help Spider-Man fight the Captain America from the ship until it is hit by a dart that causes it to regress to a Skrull named Pit'o Nilli.&lt;ref&gt;''New Avengers'' #42&lt;/ref&gt; He then later goes with the rest of the Avengers to New York City to help them fight off the Skrull invasion while Shanna stays behind with Zabu to fight off anymore Skrulls left in the Savage Land.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar later meets [[Reptil]] when he and Tigra have rescued Moon-Boy. After reuniting Moon-Boy with Devil Dinosaur, Ka-Zar tells Reptil that he will help him find his parents.&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers: The Initiative Featuring Reptil''&lt;/ref&gt;

Ka-Zar and Shanna later encounter the return of the Ethereals and end up fighting them when it comes to the Ethereals wanting the tribes of the Savage Land to be united with them.&lt;ref&gt;''Ka-Zar'' Vol. 5 #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

He later teams with [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]] to protect the Savage Land from outside forces.&lt;ref&gt;''Skaar: King of the Savage Land'' #1-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kazakhs''' (also spelled '''Kazaks''', '''Qazaqs'''; {{lang-kk|Қазақ, Qazaq}}, {{lang|kk-Arab|قازاق}} {{Audio-IPA|Kk-kazakh.ogg|/qɑ'zɑq/}}, {{lang|kk|Qazaqtar, Қазақтар}}, {{lang|kk-Arab|قازاقتار}} {{Audio-IPA|Kk-kazakhs.ogg|/qɑzɑq'tɑr/}}; the English name is [[transliteration|transliterated]] from Russian) are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic people]] who mainly inhabit the southern part of Eastern Europe and the [[Ural mountains]] and northern parts of [[Central Asia]] (largely [[Kazakhstan]], but also parts of [[Uzbekistan]], [[China]], [[Russia]] and [[Mongolia]]), the region also known as the Eurasian sub-continent. Kazakh identity is of medieval origin and was strongly shaped by the foundation of the [[Kazakh Khanate]] between 1456 and 1465, when several tribes under the rule of the sultans [[Zhanibek Khan|Zhanibek]] and [[Kerey Khan|Kerey]] departed from the Khanate of [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]].

The Kazakhs are descendants of the Turkic and medieval Mongol tribes&amp;nbsp;– [[Argyns]], [[Dughlats]], [[Naimans]], [[Jalairs]], [[Keraits]], [[Khazars]], [[Qarluqs]]; and of the [[Kipchaks]] and [[Cumans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/318970/Kipchak |title=Kipchak (people) |work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |date= |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.angelfire.com/on/paksoy/ozkaz.html |first=Z.

== Etymology of ''Kazakh'' ==

[[File:Kazakh central asian horseman.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Kazakh central asian horseman. The Russian Museum of Ethnography, 1910]]

The Kazakhs probably began using this name during either the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=V. V. |last=Barthold |authorlink=Vasily Bartold |title=Four Studies on the History of Central Asia |translator=V. &amp; T. Minorsky |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |date=1962 |volume=vol.&amp;thinsp;3 |pages=129 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theories on the origin of the word Kazakh or Qazaq. Some speculate that it comes from the Turkish verb ''{{lang|tr|qaz}}'' ("to wander"), because the Kazakhs were wandering steppemen; or that it derives from the [[Proto-Turkic language|Proto-Turkic]] word ''{{lang|trk|khasaq}}'' (a wheeled cart used by the Kazakhs to transport their [[yurt]]s and belongings).&lt;ref name="olcott"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0QAraz9qVY4C&amp;pg=PA4 |last=Olcott |first=Martha Brill |title=The Kazakhs |publisher=Hoover Press |year=1995 |page=4 |isbn=978-0-8179-9351-1 |accessdate=7 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory on the origin of the word Kazakh (originally ''{{lang|trk|Qazaq}}'') is that it comes from the ancient [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] word ''{{lang|trk|qazğaq}}'', first mentioned on the 8th century Turkic monument of Uyuk-Turan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orientalistica.ru/resour/runica/collection/e3a.htm |title=Уюк-Туран |trans-title=Uyuk-Turan |language=ru |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060205181454/http://www.orientalistica.ru/resour/runica/collection/e3a.htm |archivedate=2006-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the notable Turkic linguist [[Vasily Radlov]] and the orientalist Veniamin Yudin, the noun ''{{lang|trk|qazğaq}}'' derives from the same root as the verb ''{{lang|trk|qazğan}}'' ("to obtain", "to gain"). Therefore, ''{{lang|trk|qazğaq}}'' defines a type of person who seeks profit and gain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yudin |first=Veniamin P. |title=Центральная Азия в 14–18 веках глазами востоковеда |trans-title=Central Asia in the eyes of 14th–18th century Orientalists |location=[[Almaty]] |publisher=Dajk-Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-9965-441-39-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kazakh ===
Kazakh was a common term throughout medieval Central Asia, generally with regard to individuals or groups who had taken or achieved independence from a figure of authority. [[Tamerlane|Timur]] described his own youth without directory authority as his {{lang|trk|Qazaqliq}} ("Qazaq-ness").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Centralizing Reform and Its Opponents in the Late Timurid Period |first=Maria Eva |last=Subtelny |journal=Iranian Studies |volume=21 |issue=1/2: Soviet and North American Studies on Central Asia |date=1988 |pages=123–151 |jstor=4310597 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]], on behalf of the International Society of Iranian Studies |doi=10.1080/00210868808701712}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the Uzbek nomads' Conquest of Central Asia, the Uzbek [[Abu'l-Khayr Khan]] had differences with the Chinggisid chiefs Giray/Kirey and [[Janybek Khan|Janibeg/Janibek]], descendants of [[Urus Khan]]. 

[[File:SB - Inside a Kazakh yurt.jpg|280px|thumb|Kazakh family inside a [[Yurt]], 1911/1914]] 

These differences probably resulted from the crushing defeat of Abu'l-Khayr Khan at the hands of the Qalmaqs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bregel |first=Yuri |authorlink=Yuri Bregel |title=Abu'l-Kayr Khan |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Iranica]] |volume=1 |pages=331–332 |publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul |year=1982 |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/abul-kayr-khan-oglan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirey and Janibek moved with a large following of nomads to the region of [[Zhetysu]]/Semirechye on the border of Moghulistan and set up new pastures there with the blessing of the [[Moghulistan|Moghul]] [[Descent from Genghis Khan|Chingisid]] [[Esen Buqa II|Esen Buqa]], who hoped for a buffer zone of protection against the expansion of the [[Oirats]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=V.

Minorsky |location=Leiden |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |date=1962 |volume=vol.&amp;thinsp;1 |pages=137–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not explicitly explained that this is why the later Kazakhs took the name permanently, but it is the only historically verifiable source of the ethnonym. The group under Kirey and Janibek are called in various sources Qazaqs and Uzbek-Qazaqs (those independent of the Uzbek khans). The Russians originally called the Kazakhs 'Kirgiz' and later Kirghiz-Kaisak to distinguish them from the [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] proper.

[[File:Kazakh guard 2.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Kazakh guard at Nowruz celebrations in Astana.]]

In the 17th century, Russian convention seeking to distinguish the Qazaqs of the steppes from the [[Cossacks]] of the [[Imperial Russian Army]] suggested spelling the final consonant with "kh" instead of "q" or "k", which was officially adopted by the USSR in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:ru:Постановление ЦИК и СНК КазАССР о русском произношении и письменном обозначении слова «казак»|Постановление ЦИК и СНК КазАССР № 133 от 5.02.1936 о русском произношении и письменном обозначении слова «казак»]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kazakh&amp;nbsp;– {{lang|ru|Казах}}
* Cossack&amp;nbsp;– {{lang|ru|Казак}}

The Russian term Cossack probably comes from the same Kypchak etymological root: wanderer, brigand, independent free-booter.

=== Oral history ===
Due to their [[nomad]]ic pastoral lifestyle, Kazakhs kept an epic tradition of [[oral history]]. The nation, which amalgamated nomadic tribes of various Kazakh origins, managed to preserve the distant memory of the original founding clans. It was important for a Kazakh to know his or her genealogical tree for no less than seven generations back (known as ''{{lang|kk-Latn|şejire}}'', from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word ''{{lang|ar-Latn|shajara}}''&amp;nbsp;– "tree").

In modern Kazakhstan, [[tribalism]] is fading away in business and government life. Still it is common for a Kazakh man or woman to ask another one which tribe he or she belongs to when getting acquainted with each other. Nowadays, it is more of a tradition than necessity. There is no hostility between tribes. Kazakhs, regardless of their tribal origin, consider themselves one nation.

Those modern-day Kazakhs who yet remember their tribes know that their tribes belong to one of the three [[Zhuz]] (juz, roughly translatable as "horde" or "hundred"):
* The [[Zhuz#Senior zhuz|Senior Horde (also called Elder or Great)]] (Uly juz)
* The [[Zhuz#Middle zhuz|Middle (also called Central)]] (Orta juz)
* The [[Zhuz#Junior zhuz|Junior (also called Younger or Lesser)]] (Kishi juz)

=== History of the Hordes ===
There is much debate surrounding the origins of the Hordes. Their age is unknown so far in extant historical texts, with the earliest mentions in the 17th century. The Turkologist Velyaminov-Zernov believed that it was the capture of the important cities of [[Tashkent]], [[Turkestan (city)|Yasi]], and [[Sayram (city)|Sayram]] in 1598 by Tevvekel (Tauekel/Tavakkul) Khan that separated the Qazaqs, as only a portion of the Century possessed the cities.&lt;ref&gt;Russian, Mongolia, China in the 16th, 17th, and early 18th centuries. Vol II. Baddeley (1919, MacMillan, London). Reprint&amp;nbsp;– Burt Franklin, New York. 1963 p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; This theory suggests that the Qazaqs then divided among a wider territory after expanding from [[Zhetysu]] into most of the Dasht-i Qipchaq, with a focus on the trade available through the cities of the middle [[Syr Darya]], of which Sayram and Yasi belonged.

== Language ==
{{Main|Kazakh language|Kazakh alphabet}}
[[File:Kazakh-Mongolian Eagle Hunter.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Kazakh eagle hunter in [[Altai Tavan Bogd National Park]], [[Mongolia]].]]

The Kazakh language is a member of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] [[language family]], as are [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Azeri language|Azeri]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], and many other living and historical languages spoken in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Central Asia]], [[Xinjiang]], and [[Siberia]].

Kazakh belongs to the [[Kipchak people|Kipchak]] (Northwestern) group of the Turkic language family. Kazakh is characterized, in distinction to other Turkic languages, by the presence of {{IPA|/s/}} in place of reconstructed proto-Turkic {{IPA|*/ʃ/}} and {{IPA|/ʃ/}} in place of {{IPA|*/tʃ/}}; furthermore, Kazakh has {{IPAslink|ʒ}} where other Turkic languages have {{IPAslink|j}}.

Kazakh, like most of the Turkic language family lacks phonemic [[vowel length]], and as such there is no distinction between long and short vowels.

Kazakh was written with the Arabic script during the 19th century, when a number of poets, educated in Islamic schools, incited revolt against Russia. Russia's response was to set up secular schools and devise a way of writing Kazakh with the Cyrillic alphabet, which was not widely accepted. By 1917, the Arabic script was reintroduced, even in schools and local government.

In 1927, a Kazakh nationalist movement sprang up but was soon suppressed. At the same time the Arabic script was banned and the [[Latin]] alphabet was imposed for writing Kazakh. The native Latin alphabet was in turn replaced by the Cyrillic alphabet in 1940 by soviet interventionists. Today, there are efforts to return to the Latin script.

Kazakh is a state (official) language in [[Kazakhstan]]. It is also spoken in the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]] region of the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region in the [[China|People's Republic of China]], where the Arabic script is used, and in western parts of [[Mongolia]] ([[Bayan-Ölgii]] and [[Khovd Province|Khovd]] province), where Cyrillic script is in use. European Kazakhs use the Latin alphabet.

== Religion ==

[[File:Historical Kazakh wedding garb photo.jpg|thumb|alt=Old photo of a bride, completely covered except for her face|Kazakh bride in traditional wedding dress]]

Ancestors of modern Kazakhs believed in [[Shamanism]] and [[Tengrism]], then [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]] including [[Church of the East]]. [[Islam]] was first introduced to ancestors of modern Kazakhs during the 8th century when the [[Arab]] missionaries entered Central Asia. Islam initially took hold in the southern portions of [[Turkestan]] and thereafter gradually spread northward.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora'', pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; Islam also took root due to the zealous missionary work of [[Samanid]] rulers, notably in areas surrounding [[Taraz]]&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Athir, volume 8, pg. 396&lt;/ref&gt; where a significant number of Turks accepted Islam. Additionally, in the late 14th century, the [[Golden Horde]] propagated Islam amongst the Kazakhs and other tribes. During the 18th century, Russian influence toward the region rapidly increased throughout [[Central Asia]]. Led by [[Catherine the Great|Catherine]], the Russians initially demonstrated a willingness in allowing [[Islam]] to flourish as Muslim clerics were invited into the region to preach to the Kazakhs whom the Russians viewed as "savages" and "ignorant" of morals and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;Khodarkovsky, Michael. ''Russia's Steppe Frontier: The Making of a Colonial Empire, 1500–1800'', pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycSex572&gt;Ember, Carol R. and Melvin Ember. ''Encyclopedia of Sex and Gender: Men and Women in the World's Cultures'', pg. 572&lt;/ref&gt; However, Russian policy gradually changed toward weakening Islam by introducing pre-Islamic elements of [[collective consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Hunter14&gt;Hunter, Shireen. "Islam in Russia: The Politics of Identity and Security", pg. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Such attempts included methods of eulogizing pre-Islamic historical figures and imposing a sense of inferiority by sending Kazakhs to highly elite [[Russia]]n military institutions.&lt;ref name=Hunter14 /&gt; In response, Kazakh religious leaders attempted to bring religious fervor by espousing [[pan-Turkism]], though many were persecuted as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 304&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, [[Muslim]] institutions survived only in areas where Kazakhs significantly outnumbered non-Muslims due to everyday Muslim practices.&lt;ref&gt;Farah, Caesar E. ''Islam: Beliefs and Observances'', pg. 340&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to conform Kazakhs into [[Communist]] ideologies, gender relations and other aspects of the Kazakh culture were key targets of social change.&lt;ref name=EncycSex572 /&gt;

In more recent times however, Kazakhs have gradually employed a determined effort in revitalizing Islamic religious institutions after the fall of the [[Soviet Union]]. Some Kazakhs continue to identify with their Islamic faith,&lt;ref&gt;Page, Kogan. ''Asia and Pacific Review 2003/04'', pg. 99&lt;/ref&gt; and even more devotedly in the countryside. Those who claim descent from the original [[Muslim]] soldiers and missionaries of the 8th century command substantial respect in their communities.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki, Touraj. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: transnationalism and diaspora''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakh political figures have also stressed the need to sponsor Islamic awareness. For example, the Kazakh Foreign Affairs Minister, [[Marat Tazhin]], recently emphasized that Kazakhstan attaches importance to the use of "positive potential Islam, learning of its history, culture and heritage."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=154837 inform.kz | 154837] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020120928/http://www.inform.kz/showarticle.php?lang=eng&amp;id=154837 |date=20 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Islamic beliefs—the worship of the sky, of the ancestors, and of fire, for example—continued to a great extent to be preserved among the common people, however. The Kazakhs believed in the supernatural forces of good and evil spirits, of wood goblins and giants. To protect themselves from them, as well as from the evil eye, the Kazakhs wore protection beads and talismans. Shamanic beliefs are still widely preserved among the Kazakhs, as well as belief in the strength of the bearers of this worship—the shamans, which the Kazakhs call bakhsy. In contradistinction to the Siberian shamans, who used drums during their rituals, the Kazakh shamans, who could also be men or women, played (with a bow) on a stringed instrument similar to a large violin. At present both Islamic and pre-Islamic beliefs continue to be found among the Kazakhs, especially among the elderly.&lt;ref name="Everyculture.com" /&gt; According to 2009 national census 39,172 Kazakhs are [[Christianity|Christians]].&lt;ref name="2009 Census"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |title=Итоги национальной переписи населения 2009 года (Summary of the 2009 national census) |language=Russian |publisher=Agency of Statistics of the Republic of Kazakhstan |accessdate=21 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612063733/http://www.stat.kz/news/Pages/n2_12_11_10.aspx |archivedate=12 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Russia]], the Kazakh population lives primarily in the regions bordering Kazakhstan. According to latest census (2002) there are 654,000 Kazakhs in Russia, most of whom are in the [[Astrakhan Oblast|Astrakhan]], [[Volgograd Oblast|Volgograd]], [[Saratov Oblast|Saratov]], [[Samara Oblast|Samara]], [[Orenburg Oblast|Orenburg]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast|Chelyabinsk]], [[Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], [[Tyumen Oblast|Tyumen]], [[Omsk Oblast|Omsk]], [[Novosibirsk Oblast|Novosibirsk]], [[Altai Krai]] and [[Altai Republic]] regions.

{{Main|Kazakhs in China}}
{{See also|Kazakh exodus from Xinjiang}}

Kazakhs migrated into [[Dzungaria]] in the 18th century after the [[Dzungar genocide]] resulted in the native Buddhist [[Dzungars|Dzungar Oirat]] population being massacred.

Kazakhs, called Hāsàkè Zú in Chinese ([[wiktionary:哈|哈]][[wiktionary:萨|萨]][[wiktionary:克|克]][[wiktionary:族|族]]; literally "Kazakh people" or "Kazakh tribe") are among [[List of Chinese ethnic groups|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]]. Thousands of Kazakhs fled to China during the 1932–1933 famine in Kazakhstan.

In 1936, after [[Sheng Shicai]] expelled 30,000 Kazakhs from Xinjiang to Qinghai, [[Hui people|Hui]] led by General [[Ma Bufang]] massacred their fellow Muslim Kazakhs, until there were 135 of them left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=m98sAAAAIAAJ|title=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 277|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=NnY5AAAAMAAJ|title=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volumes 276–278|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=28 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2t5VAAAAYAAJ|title=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, Volume 277|author=American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1951|publisher=American Academy of Political and Social Science|location=|page=152|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2012-09-29|quote=A group of Kazakhs, originally numbering over 20000 people when expelled from Sinkiang by Sheng Shih-ts'ai in 1936, was reduced, after repeated massacres by their Chinese coreligionists under Ma Pu-fang, to a scattered 135 people.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From Northern Xinjiang over 7,000 Kazakhs fled to the Tibetan-Qinghai plateau region via Gansu and were wreaking massive havoc so Ma Bufang solved the problem by relegating the Kazakhs into designated pastureland in Qinghai, but Hui, Tibetans, and Kazakhs in the region continued to clash against each other.{{when|date=December 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hsaio-ting Lin|title=Tibet and Nationalist China's Frontier: Intrigues and Ethnopolitics, 1928–49|url=https://books.google.com/?id=osn1WrRCelcC&amp;pg=PA112|date=1 January 2011|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-5988-2|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, 1935, and from 1936–1938 Qumil Eliqsan led approximately 18,000 Kerey Kazakhs to migrate to Gansu, entering Gansu and Qinghai.&lt;ref name="Benson1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Linda Benson|title=The Kazaks of China: Essays on an Ethnic Minority|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ntpwAAAAMAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Ubsaliensis S.

In China there is one Kazakh [[autonomous prefecture]], the [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture]] in the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region and three Kazakh autonomous counties: [[Aksai Kazakh Autonomous County]] in [[Gansu]], [[Barkol Kazakh Autonomous County]] and [[Mori Kazakh Autonomous County]] in the [[Xinjiang]] Uyghur Autonomous Region. Many Kazakhs in China are not fluent in [[Standard Chinese]], instead speaking the [[Kazakh language]]. "[[In that place wholly faraway]]", based on a Kazakh [[folk song]],{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} is very popular outside the Kazakh regions, especially in the [[Far East]]ern countries of China, [[Japan]] and [[Korea]].{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

In the 19th century, the advance of the [[Russian Empire]] troops pushed Kazakhs to neighboring countries. In around 1860, part of the Middle Jüz Kazakhs came to [[Mongolia]] and were allowed to settle down in Bayan-Ölgii, Western Mongolia and for most of the 20th century they remained an isolated, tightly knit community.
Ethnic Kazakhs (so-called Altaic Kazakhs or Altai-Kazakhs) live predominantly in Western Mongolia in [[Bayan-Ölgii Province]] (88.7% of the total population) and [[Khovd Province]] (11.5% of the total population, living primarily in [[Khovd (city)|Khovd city]], [[Khovd, Khovd|Khovd]] [[Sums of Mongolia|sum]] and [[Buyant, Khovd|Buyant]] sum). In addition, a number of Kazakh communities can be found in various cities and towns spread throughout the country.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Kazakhstan}}

== Music ==

Many are skilled in the performance of Kazakh traditional songs. One of the most commonly used traditional musical instruments of the Kazakhs is the ''[[dombra]]'', a plucked lute with two strings. It is often used to accompany solo or group singing. Another popular instrument is ''[[kobyz]]'', a bow instrument played on the knees. Along with other instruments, these two instruments play a key role in the traditional Kazakh orchestra. A notable composer is [[Kurmangazy Sagyrbayuly|Kurmangazy]], who lived in the 19th century. After studying in Moscow, [[Gaziza Zhubanova]] became the first woman classical composer in Kazakhstan, whose compositions reflect Kazakh history and folklore. A notable singer of the Soviet epoch is [[Roza Rymbaeva]], she was a star of the trans-Soviet-Union scale. A notable Kazakh rock band is [[Urker]], performing in the genre of ethno-rock, which synthesises rock music with the traditional Kazakh music.

'''"Las Trece Rosas"''' (the ''Thirteen Roses'') is the name given in [[Spain]] to a group of thirteen young women who were executed by a [[Francoist Spain|Francoist]] [[Execution by firing squad|firing squad]] just after the conclusion of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Their execution was part of a massive execution campaign known as the ''"saca de agosto"'', which included 43 young men (among them a fourteen-year-old).&lt;ref&gt;Preston, Paul. ''El holocausto español. Odio y exterminio en la guerra civil y después.'' Editorial Debate. Barcelona. 2011. p.633&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirteen victims were: Carmen Barrero Aguado (age 24), Martina Barroso García (age 22), Blanca Brissac Vázquez (age 29), Pilar Bueno Ibáñez (age 27), Julia Conesa Conesa (age 19), Adelina García Casillas (age 19), Elena Gil Olaya (age 20), Virtudes González García (age 18), Ana López Gallego (age 21), Joaquina López Laffite (age 23), Dionisia Manzanero Salas (age 20), Victoria Muñoz García (age 19), and Luisa Rodríguez de la Fuente (age 18).&lt;ref&gt;Egido León, Ángeles. ''El perdon de Franco. La represión de las mujeres en el Madrid de posguerra.''.Los libros de la catarata. 2009. Madrid.p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the women were under age - in Francoist Spain the age of majority was 21.

Following the capitulation of [[Madrid]] to [[Francisco Franco|Franco's]] troops and the end of the Civil War, the Madrid Provincial Committee of the [[Unified Socialist Youth]] (JSU) (an organisation resulting from the merger of the [[Socialist Youth of Spain|Socialist Youth]] and the [[Communist Youth Union of Spain|Communist Youth]] even though most pro-[[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] (PSOE) members had abandoned the organisation) tried to reorganise under the leadership of 21-year-old José Peña Brea. He was betrayed, arrested, and tortured; under torture he revealed the names of his collaborators, which led to a wave of arrests of JSU members in Madrid. The Thirteen Roses were among the many JSU members captured and imprisoned by the police. During their detention in the Ventas prison they were repeatedly tortured and humiliated, and conditions in the prison were considered inhumane and overcrowded. They were ultimately executed by firing squad against the wall of the East Cemetery (now [[Cementerio de la Almudena|la Almudena]]) on 5 August 1939. Many of their comrades at the prison recall that while they were being driven away by lorry to their deaths, they sang the "Youthful Guardsmen" (JSU's anthem) so as to be heard by their comrades who remained in jail. The victims were accused of aiding a military rebellion and of assassinating a high-ranking [[political police]] officer, his 16-year-old daughter, and driver who were murdered after they had already been detained.&lt;ref&gt;Julía. Santos; Casanova, Julián; Solé i sabaté, Josep Maria; Villarroya, Joan; Moreno, Francisco. ''Víctimas de la guerra civil.'' Editorial Temas de Hoy. Madrid. 2006. p.329&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2005, a foundation (''Fundación Trece Rosas'') was created in Spain to keep their memory alive.

'''Lorenzo Brentano''' (November 4, 1813 – September 18, 1891) was a [[German American]] revolutionary, journalist, and later a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Illinois]].

==Biography==
[[File:Lorenz Brentano.jpg|thumb|left|Lorenz Brentano in 1848]]
Born as '''Lorenz Peter Carl Brentano''' in [[Mannheim]], [[Grand Duchy of Baden]], Germany, Brentano received a thorough [[Classics|classical]] training and studied jurisprudence at the [[University of Heidelberg|Universities of Heidelberg]] and [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|Freiburg]]. He practiced before the supreme court of Baden.

Brentano was elected to the Chamber of Deputies and in 1848 to the [[Frankfurt Parliament]]. He served as president of the provisional republic of Baden established by the revolutionists in 1849. He was sentenced to imprisonment for life after the failure of the revolution, but sought refuge in the United States via [[Switzerland]].

He established ''Der Leuchtturm'', a German anti-slavery journal, in [[Pottsville, Pennsylvania]]. He settled in [[Kalamazoo County, Michigan]], and engaged in agricultural pursuits. He moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1859. He was [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admitted to the bar]] in 1859 and commenced practice in Chicago. He became editor-in-chief and principal proprietor of the ''[[Illinois Staats-Zeitung]]'' from 1862 to 1867. The paper was sold in 1867, and [[Hermann Raster]] took over Brentano's position as editor. He served as member of the [[Illinois House of Representatives]] in 1862, as a member of the [[Chicago Board of Education]] 1862-1868, and as a delegate to the [[1864 Republican National Convention]]. In 1868 he was presidential [[Electoral college|elector]] on the [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] and [[Schuyler Colfax|Colfax]] ticket.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske, John|1900}}

In 1869, a general amnesty having been granted to the [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutionists of 1849]], he revisited his native land. He was appointed United States consul at [[Dresden]] in 1872 and served until April 1876.{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske, John|1900}} Brentano's son [[Theodore Brentano|Theodore]] would become the first American ambassador to [[Hungary]].

Brentano was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[45th United States Congress|Forty-fifth]] Congress (March 4, 1877 – March 3, 1879). He was an unsuccessful candidate for renomination in 1878. 
After leaving Congress, he engaged in literary and historical research designed to compare and contrast the American and European codes of criminal procedure. In this line of work he published a report of the trial of the assassin of President [[James A. Garfield|Garfield]], and a history of the celebrated case of Kring v. Missouri (see [[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 107]]).{{sfn|Wilson &amp; Fiske, John|1900}} 
He died in Chicago, and was interred in [[Graceland Cemetery]].

'''Marjolein Buis''' (born 11 January 1988) is a Dutch [[wheelchair tennis]] player. She participated in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games in London, 2012]], and won a gold medal in the women's doubles event with partner [[Esther Vergeer]]. Marjolein is the current (April 2018) World Number One in the doubles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.itftennis.com/wheelchair/players/player/profile.aspx?playerid=100112310&lt;/ref&gt;

Marjolein Buis was born in [[Nijmegen]], the Netherlands. At the age of 14 she started to experience problems when walking. It turned out that she has a connective tissue disorder, the [[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]], which affects the stability of the joints. She would never be able to play able bodied sports again.
At the age of 17, Marjolein discovered wheelchair tennis. In 2010, she graduated in Social Work and became a full-time tennis player. She qualified for the Paralympic Games in London 2012 and reached the quarter final in singles and won gold in doubles with her partner Esther Vergeer. At the Paralympic Games in Rio 2016 Marjolein reached the quarter final in singles again and this time won silver in doubles with her partner [[Diede de Groot]]. Marjolein is still a full-time player. In her spare time she studies Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/buismarjolein&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Michael Madison''' (born October 15, 1977) is an American [[serial killer]] from [[East Cleveland, Ohio]] who committed at least three murders.

==Early life==
Madison was born October 15, 1977 to Diane Madison and John Baldwin, the result of an accidental pregnancy. Baldwin denied that he was Madison's father and was not a part of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/05/michael_madison_jury_will_now.html Serial killer Michael Madison's childhood abuse used as defense to avoid death penalty] Cleveland.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery and arrest==
On July 19, 2013, police responding to reports of a foul odor investigated a garage leased to Madison and discovered a decomposing body lying inside. Two more bodies were found the following day &amp;ndash; one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The bodies of three women were found {{convert|100|yards}} to {{convert|200|yards}} apart and were each wrapped in plastic bags. After obtaining a [[search warrant]], police entered Madison's apartment and found "further evidence of decomposition." After a brief standoff with police at his mother's house, Madison was taken into custody without incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.cnn.com/2013/07/21/us/ohio-bodies-found/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 After 3 bodies found, mayor warns: 'There might be more victims'], CNN.com, 21 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2013/07/east_cleveland_sex_offender_michael_madison_to_be_formally_charged_monday_in_dea.html East Cleveland sex offender Michael Madison to be charged Monday in deaths of 3 women, police say], Associated Press, 21 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court appearance===
On July 22, 2013, Madison was charged with three counts of [[aggravated murder]]. His bail was set at six million dollars and he also waived his right to a preliminary hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ohio man charged with murder after 3 bodies found|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2021445378_apusohiobodies.html|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
On October 31, 2013, Madison's attorney David Grant entered a not guilty plea to an updated indictment that included aggravated murder charges; prosecutors had announced that they were now seeking the death penalty, a move his attorney had tried to prevent but had expected. The 14-count updated indictment includes two counts each of aggravated murder for each victim, three counts of kidnapping, three counts of gross abuse of a corpse, one count of rape, and one count of weapons possession by an ex-convict. He had originally been [[Sex offender registries in the United States|registered as a sex offender]] in 2002 after serving four years for an attempted rape conviction, having had previous drug convictions in 2000 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/other/ohio-sex-offender-pleads-not-guilty-slayings-could-get-death-f8C11503352|title=Ohio sex offender pleads not guilty to slayings, could get death|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=June 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madison's trial began April 4, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Madison's ex says the accused serial killer 'can't stand the female species'|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/04/accused_serial_killer_michael_1.html|publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 5, 2016, Madison was found guilty in the murders of Shirellda Terry, Shetisha Sheeley and Angela Deskins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michael Madison found guilty of murdering three women in East Cleveland|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/05/michael_madison_found_guilty_o.html|publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury spent less than one day deliberating before returning a guilty verdict on all 13 counts. Madison told the court he plans to appeal to the Ohio Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=East Cleveland serial killer Michael Madison convicted on 13 counts: 'He will never do this again'|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/05/east_cleveland_serial_killer_m.html|publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=6 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 2016, the jury recommended that Madison should be sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jury recommends death penalty for East Cleveland serial killer Michael Madison|url=http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2016/05/jury_recommends_death_penalty.html|publisher=cleveland.com|accessdate=21 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 2, 2016, Cuyahoga Common Pleas Judge Nancy R.

He has been active with the [[Kefaya]] movement since 2005 and is one of activists who called for a general strike on April 6, 2008.  In 2009, Mohammed Adel became the April 6 movement's media spokesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/04/06/135186320/in-egypt-april-6-movement-marks-anniversary|title=In Egypt, April 6 Movement Marks Anniversary|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=11 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between the time of the 2008 strike in Mahalla al-Kubra and the onset of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]], Mohemmad Adel enrolled in a training program directed by the Center for Non-Violent Action and Strategies, an entity founded by the Serbian pro-democracy youth movement [[Otpor!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gelvin|first=James|year=2012|title=The Arab Uprisings: What Everyone Needs to Know|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-989177-1|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013 revolutionary activism==
Mohammed Adel was tried by a Cairo misdemeanor court on charges of violating a controversial protest law and for allegedly assaulting police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt court postpones Douma, Adel, Maher trial to 22 December|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/88614/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-court-postpones-Douma,-Adel,-Maher-trial-to-.aspx|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=[[Ahram Online]]|date=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 22, the court declared him to be guilty of violating the protest law, sentencing him and two other defendants, [[Ahmed Maher (youth leader)|Ahmed Maher]] and [[Ahmed Douma]], to three years of hard labor in prison, a requirement to pay a fine of  LE50,000, and subjection to a three-year period of surveillance upon release from jail.&lt;ref name="ao22dec"&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's Maher, Adel and Douma sentenced to 3 years in jail|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/89748/Egypt/Politics-/UPDATE-Egypts-Maher,-Adel-and-Douma-sentenced-to--.aspx|accessdate=22 December 2013|newspaper=[[Ahram Online]]|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Three core, secular members of 2011 Arab Spring movement jailed in Egypt|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/three-core-secular-members-of-2011-arab-spring-movement-jailed-in-egypt//|accessdate=22 December 2013|date=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various Egyptian and international human rights organizations have condemned the trial as a symptom of a growing crackdown on pro-democracy and civil society activism; during the course of the trial, [[Amnesty International]] stated that the charges against Adel and other defendants "may arise solely from their opposition activism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Verdict On Egyptian Pro-Democracy Activists Postponed|url=http://en.haberler.com/verdict-on-egyptian-pro-democracy-activists-333908/|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=[[Haberler.com]]|date=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Emad Hamdi, a member of the [[Egyptian Popular Current]], condemned the verdict against Mohammed Adel, unfavorably juxtaposing the acquittals and light sentences given to Mubarak-era criminals with those being issued against revolutionary and democratic activists.&lt;ref name="ao22dec"/&gt;

In the initial stages of the trial, Mohammed Adel was being tried [[Trial in absentia|in absentia]]. However, shortly before the verdict was announced, he was forcibly seized by police during the course of a raid on the [[Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights]].&lt;ref name="ao19dec"&gt;{{cite news|title=Police storm Egyptian Centre for Economic and Social Rights, arrest April 6 activist|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/89512/Egypt/Politics-/Police-storm-Egyptian-Centre-for-Economic-and-Soci.aspx/|accessdate=19 December 2013|newspaper=[[Ahram Online]]|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police smashed some computers while confiscating other computers, electronic equipment, and documents.  They also assaulted and detained a number of individuals present at the scene.&lt;ref name="ao19dec"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Raid on Egyptian rights group widely condemned|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/89545/Egypt/Politics-/Raid-on-Egyptian-rights-group-widely-condemned.aspx/|accessdate=19 December 2013|newspaper=[[Ahram Online]]|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamdeen Sabahi]] has censured the court conviction sentencing [[Ahmed Maher (youth leader)|Ahmed Maher]], Mohamed Adel, and [[Ahmed Douma]] to three years in prison and a fine of LE50,000 and maintains that Interim President [[Adly Mansour]] should issue these and other detained individuals a pardon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/98488/Egypt/Politics-/Presidential-candidate-demands-release-of-revoluti.aspx|title=Presidential candidate demands release of 'revolution activists'|agency=Ahram Online|date=7 April 2014|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Constitution Party (Egypt)|Constitution Party]] has expressed solidarity with the detainees and their families and requested that the interim President Adly Mansour issue a pardon to Ahmed Maher, Mohammed Adel, and Ahmed Douma, as well as to Loay Abdel Rahman, Omar Hussein, Islam Ahmed, and Nasser Ibrahim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com//news/constitution-party-requests-president-mansour-pardon-arrested-activists|title=Constitution Party requests President Mansour to pardon arrested activists|agency=Egypt Independent|date=7 April 2014|accessdate=7 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adel is strongly against the currently president Sisi. He describes his government as it injustice and bloody. Adel always calls for freedom for all detainees and prisoners activists.

Adel now struggles against the decision of selling the two islands "[[Tiran Island|Tiran]] and [[Sanafir Island|Sanafir]]" to the Saudi kingdom.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">'''Nathaniel Pryor (aka Nathaniel Miguel Pryor and Miguel Pryor)''' (died 1849-1850), an American Citizen captured in Old Mexico who later became an esteemed citizen of Los Angeles, California. 

== Family and Early Life ==
Nathaniel Pryor was born about 1806 in [[Kentucky]]. He married in 1838 in [[California]], then part of [[Mexico]], at [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel|Mission San Gabriel]]. The record stated his father's name as Nathaniel Pryor (speculated by researchers to be [[Nathaniel Hale Pryor]]) of [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] and Mary Davis was his mother. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://huntington.org/|title=Home - The Huntington Library, Art Collection, and Botanical Gardens|website=huntington.org|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His bride was Maria Teresa Sepulveda, a descendant of [[Francisco Xavier Sepúlveda|Francisco Xavier Sepulveda]], a Mexican colonialist whose descendants owned vast tracts of land in [[Alta California]]. 

== Captured by Mexico ==
Nathaniel Pryor was noted for his entry into California in March 1828. He was on a fur [[trapping]] expedition with several other Americans when captured by the Spanish and taken to the prison at [[San Diego]]. His companions were Syvester Pattie and his son [[James Ohio Pattie|James O. Pattie]], Richard Lochlyn all from Kentucky, Isaac Stover from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], William Pope from [[Indiana]], Jesse Ferguson from [[Missouri]], and Edmund Russell from [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania.]] James O. Pattie wrote to [[John Coffin Jones Jr.|John Coffin Jones]], the American consul to the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] to ask assistance for their release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/personalnarrativ00pattrich|title=The personal narrative of James O. Pattie, of Kentucky : during an expedition from St. Louis, through the vast regions between that place and the Pacific Ocean, and thence back through the city of Mexico to Vera Cruz, during journeyings of six years, in which he and his father, who accompanied him, suffered unheard of hardships and dangers ...|last=Pattie|first=James O.

(Kenneth Karl)|last5=Wood|first5=John H.|date=1831|publisher=Cincinnati : Printed and published by John H. Wood|others=University of California Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== A Citizen of Los Angeles ==
Upon his release Pryor settled in [[Los Angeles]]. A son named Juan Pryor was baptized in 1837. It's unlikely that Pryor was married to the boy's mother Juana Montalvo, as the baptism indicates the child was a "es" or a born out of marriage. He had two more sons by Sepulveda: Pablo Pryor and Manuel Pryor who died soon after birth in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://huntington.org/|title=Home - The Huntington Library, Art Collection, and Botanical Gardens|website=huntington.org|access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miguel Pryor (aka Nathaniel Pryor) is mentioned in an account of the defense of Los Angeles in 1846, during the Mexican War. National newspapers recounted that the citizens of Los Angeles had met in September 1846 to expel the American military who had positioned themselves in California during the war. An escalation in violence had left 150 Americans dead. To stop the bloodshed both sides met to agree on conditions of a cease-fire. The Americans were represented by surgeon Edward Gilchrist and the Los Angelenos were represented by Miguel Prior (sic).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/33777729/?terms=miguel+prior|title=18 Jan 1847, Page 2 - The Evening Post at Newspapers.com|work=Newspapers.com|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pryor married again in 1848 to Maria Felipe Paula Romero at the [[La Iglesia de Nuestra Señora la Reina de los Ángeles|Plaza Church]] in Los Angeles. They had two additional children, Joaquina and Nathaniel Juan.  

[[Stephen Clark Foster|Stephen C. Foster]], a [[mayor of Los Angeles]], published in 1884 ''A Sketch of Some of the earliest Pioneers of Los Angeles''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWJKefM8cP0C&amp;lpg=PA151&amp;ots=hhcazYA6Lv&amp;dq=Los%20Angeles%20County%20Pioneers%20of%20Southern%20California%20stephen%20c%20foster&amp;pg=PA148#v=onepage&amp;q=kentucky%20pioneers&amp;f=false|title=Annual Report of the American Historical Association|last=Association|first=American Historical|date=1907|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he recorded meeting Nathaniel Pryor in about 1849.

{{gnosticism}}

'''Ptolemy the Gnostic''', or '''Ptolemaeus Gnosticus''', was a disciple of the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] teacher [[Valentinius]] and is known for the [[Letter to Flora]], an [[epistle]] he wrote to a wealthy woman named Flora, herself not a gnostic{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}.

Ptolemy was probably still alive [[circa|''c''.]] 180. No other certain details are known about his life; Harnack's suggestion that he was identical with the Ptolemy spoken of by St. Justin is as yet unproved.&lt;ref&gt;Text. u. Untersuch. New. Ser. XIII, Anal. z. ält. Gesch. d. Chr.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not known when Ptolemy became a disciple of [[Valentinius]], but Valentinius was active in the [[Egypt]]ian city of [[Alexandria]] and in [[Rome]]. Ptolemy was, with [[Heracleon]], the principal writer of the Italian or Western school of Valentinian Gnosticism, which was active in Rome, Italy, and Southern Gaul.

[[File:"Epístola a Flora" de Ptolomeo de la obra "Ptolemaeus Brief an die Flora" de Adolf von Harnack,1904..jpg|thumb|right|Epistle to Flora]]
Ptolemy's works have reached us in an incomplete form as follows: 

:* a fragment of an exegetical writing preserved by [[Irenaeus|Irenæus]];&lt;ref&gt;''[[On the Detection and Overthrow of the So-Called Gnosis|Adversus haereses]]'' I, viii, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and
:* an epistle to Flora, a Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Ptolemy the Gnostic}}&lt;/ref&gt; lady not otherwise known to us.

The latter is found in the works of [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Panarion|Hær.]] XXXIII, 3-7&lt;/ref&gt; It was written in response to Flora's inquiry concerning the origin of the [[Ten Commandments|Law]] of the [[Old Testament]]. The Decalogue, Ptolemy states, cannot be attributed to the Supreme [[God]], nor to the [[devil]]; indeed, the set of laws does not even proceed from a single law-giver. A part of it is the work of an inferior god, analogous to the gnostic [[demiurge]]; the second part is attributable to [[Moses]], and the third part to the elders of the [[Jewish]] people. In addition, Ptolemy subdivides the part of the Decalogue ascribed to the inferior god into three further sections: &lt;br /&gt;

# the absolutely pure legislation of the Decalogue which was not destroyed but fulfilled by the Saviour;
# the laws mixed with evil, including the right of retaliation, which were abolished by the Saviour because they were incompatible with His nature;
# the section which is typical and symbolical of the higher world.

This part of the Decalogue includes such precepts as [[circumcision]] and [[fasting]] and was raised by the saviour from a sensible to a spiritual plane. The god who is the author of the law, insofar as it is not the product of human effort, is the demiurge who occupies a middle position between the Supreme God and the devil. He is the creator of the material universe, is neither perfect nor the author of evil, but ought to be called 'just' and benevolent to the extent of his abilities. 

In his cosmogonic depiction of the universe, Ptolemy referred to an extensive system of [[aeons]] that emanated from a [[Monad (Gnosticism)|monadic]] spiritual source. Thirty of these, he believed, ruled the higher world, the ''[[pleroma]]''. This system became the basis of an exegesis which expounds the first [[Ogdoad (Gnosticism)|Ogdoad]] of the [[Pleroma]] based on the prologue of John's gospel.

'''Robert Ralph Furman''' (August 21, 1915&amp;nbsp;– October 14, 2008) was a [[civil engineer]] who during [[World War II]] was the chief of foreign intelligence for the [[Manhattan Engineer District]] directing espionage against the [[German nuclear energy project]]. He participated in the [[Alsos Mission]], which conducted a series of operations with the intent to place all uranium in Europe into [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] hands, and at the end of the war rounded up German atomic scientists to keep them out of the [[Soviet Union]]. He personally escorted half of the [[uranium-235]] necessary for the [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb to the Pacific island of [[Tinian]].  He was also a key figure overseeing the construction of [[The Pentagon]] building. After the war he founded Furman Builders Inc., a construction company that  built hundreds of structures, including the [[Potomac Mills]] shopping mall in [[Woodbridge, Virginia]].

==Early life==
Robert Ralph Furman was born on August 21, 1915, in [[Trenton, New Jersey]], one of five sons of William and Leila Ficht Furman. His father was a bank teller, and his mother worked as a riveter during World War II. He attended [[Princeton University]] and graduated in 1937 with a degree in [[civil engineering]]. He then worked for the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] and a construction company in New York.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"/&gt;

==World War II==
In December 1940, Furman was activated as a member of the [[United States Army Reserve]] and assigned to the [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] Construction Division, where he worked for [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], supervising the day-to-day construction of [[The Pentagon]]. When the building was completed in 1943, Groves was reassigned to the "Manhattan Project" and brought his aide, Furman, with him.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hevesi |first=Dennis |date=October 29, 2008 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/30/us/30furman.html?_r=1&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;oref=slogin |title=R. R. Furman, 93, Dies; Led Bomb-Project Spying |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[TIME magazine]] |date=October 31, 2008 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1855371,00.html |title=Robert Furman |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1943 Furman was put in charge of an intelligence effort formed by Groves in response to concerns raised by atomic bomb project scientists about the [[German nuclear energy project]]. As director of intelligence, Furman was responsible for ascertaining the progress the Germans were making.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"/&gt; In December 1943, Groves sent Furman to Britain to discuss the establishment of a London Liaison Office for the Manhattan Project and the British government, and to confer over coordinating the intelligence effort.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=194}}

Furman sent the spy [[Moe Berg]] to Switzerland to meet the head of the German project, [[Werner Heisenberg]]. After chatting with Heisenberg at a cocktail party, Berg concluded that the Germans were a long way behind the Allied effort.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; Furman travelled to Rome in June 1944, where he interviewed Italian scientists about the German project.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=209–210}}

When the [[Alsos Mission]] found documentation in office of [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga|Union Minière]] in [[Antwerp]] that indicated over 1,000 tons of refined uranium had been sent to Germany, but about 150 tons still remained at Olen, Belgium,{{sfn|Pash|1969|pp=82–86}} Groves sent Furman back to Europe with orders to secure the Olen cache. The Alsos Mission located 68 tons there, but another 80 tons was missing, having been shipped to France in 1940 ahead of the German invasion of Belgium.{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=219–220}} Groves had the Olen uranium shipped to England and, ultimately, to the United States.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=287}}

Documentation indicated that the missing uranium had been sent to [[Toulouse]].{{sfn|Pash|1969|p=98}} An Alsos Mission team under [[Boris Pash]]'s command reached Toulouse on October 1 and inspected a French Army arsenal with a [[Geiger counter]]. When the needle jumped near some barrels, they were inspected and found to be the 31 tons of uranium from Belgium. The 3342nd Quartermaster Truck Company was released from the [[Red Ball Express]] to retrieve the shipment.{{sfn|Pash|1969|pp=111–116}} The barrels were collected and transported to [[Marseilles]], where Furman supervised their loading on a ship bound for the United States.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"/&gt;

In April 1945, Furman participated in [[Operation Harborage]]. The Alsos Mission and the 1269th Engineer Combat Battalion occupied  [[Haigerloch]], where they found and destroyed a German experimental [[nuclear reactor]], and recovered uranium and heavy water.{{sfn|Pash|1969|pp=207–210}} The Alsos Mission took Heisenberg into custody on May 2.{{sfn|Pash|1969|pp=230–237}} Furman supervised his detention and that of nine other German scientists, who were taken to [[Rheims]], then [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]], and finally to the country estate of [[Farm Hall]] in England, where their conversations were monitored and where they could not defect to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

In July 1945, Furman personally escorted half of the [[uranium-235]] necessary for the [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb to the Pacific island of [[Tinian]]. Accompanied by Captain James F. Nolan, a [[radiologist]] with [[Project Alberta]], Furman set out by car from [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] to [[Albuquerque]] on July 14, then travelled by air to [[Hamilton Air Force Base|Hamilton Field]], California. The men boarded the [[cruiser]] {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} at [[Hunters Point Naval Shipyard]], and crossed the Pacific to Tinian, arriving on July 26.{{sfn|Russ|1990|p=55}}{{sfn|Groves|1962|pp=305–306}} A few days after leaving Tinian, the ''Indianapolis'' was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine with the loss of over 800 men.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"/&gt;{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=536}}

==Later life==
Furman left the army the year after the war ended and founded Furman Builders Inc. in [[Rockville, Maryland]]. The firm built hundreds of homes, schools and commercial buildings, including the [[Potomac Mills]] shopping mall in [[Woodbridge, Virginia]], the [[Metropolitan Baptist Church (Washington, D.C.)|Metropolitan Baptist Church]] in Washington, D.C., and the United States embassy in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name="ap"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=October 31, 2008 |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2008-10-31-984451925_x.htm | title=Robert Furman, secretive WWII figure, dead at 93 |accessdate=8 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Mary Eddy in 1952.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; They had four children: a son, David, and three daughters, Martha Keating, Julia Costello and Serena Furman.&lt;ref name="Hevesi-nyt"/&gt;

For the most part, Furman kept quiet about his exploits during the war. He served as president of the local rotary club and sang baritone in a barbershop quartet.&lt;ref name="TIME"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt; He retired in 1993, and died of [[Melanoma|metastatic melanoma]] on October 14, 2008 at Buckingham's Choice retirement community in [[Adamstown, Maryland]] at the age of 93.&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jan/23/obituary-robert-furman |date= January 23, 2009 |last=Carlson |first= Michael |accessdate=8 March 2014 |title=Robert Furman – He played a key role in the Manhattan project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;

Hui has also gained credit for popularising [[Cantopop]], by incorporating the idiosyncrasies of Western popular music into the old Cantopop genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=sEbAyJ7aj38C&amp;pg=PA184 | page = 184 | title = Unity and diversity: local cultures and identities in China | first = Tao Tao | last = Liu | first2 = David | last2 = Faure | publisher = Hong Kong University Press | year = 1996 | ISBN = 962-209-402-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{unsourced section|date=March 2017}}

===Singer===
Hui started his career as a host on a youth music TV show on the [[Television Broadcasts Limited|TVB]] network. Sam and Michael Hui starred as the hosts in ''[[Hui Brothers Show]]'' (雙星報喜). At that time, he was the lead musician of a band [[Lotus (Hong Kong band)|The Lotus]]. In the early years of his career, Hui performed English songs that were popular in Britain and the United States. He wrote the theme songs for the comedies produced by his brother, [[Michael Hui]], and started performing [[Cantonese]] songs.

Hui's music gained popular appeal, particularly with the working class, for its simplicity and the relevance of the lyrics. A prolific songwriter, a noted recurring theme in his music is that it often describes or humorously satirises Hong Kong society and events. One of his most popular songs during the mid-1970s was the theme song of the film ''[[The Private Eyes (1976 film)|The Private Eyes]]'', which humorously reflected on the harsh realities of middle and lower-income Hong Kongers. Others such as "Song of Water Use" (制水歌), which referenced the days of [[Water supply and sanitation in Hong Kong#Water rationing|water rationing during the 1960s]], and "Could Not Care Less About 1997" (話知你97), which encouraged Hong Kong people to adopt a ''[[carpe diem]]'' attitude instead of worrying about the imminent [[Transfer of sovereignty of Hong Kong|handover to the People's Republic of China]] on 1 July 1997, were more topical in nature and referenced local events. While some of his songs are lighthearted, others carried philosophical messages brought out through artful use of Chinese words that have multiple symbolism. Examples can be seen in his farewell song in 1992 and "From the Heart of a Loafer" ({{lang|zh-hk|浪子心聲}}), where for Cantopop, the sophisticated language and messages were rare in the lyrics of contemporary artists.

===Film===
On a personal note, Hui is closer to his middle brother [[Ricky Hui|Ricky]] than to their oldest brother Michael. Sam and Michael reportedly fell out with each other after their pre-1985 successes. However, in Michael's ''[[Chicken and Duck Talk]]'' (1988), Hui appeared in a short 1-minute cameo, playing the role of himself as [[master of ceremonies]] at the grand opening of Danny's Chicken, and contributed to its theme song for its end credits entitled "You Have Your Say" (你有你講). Then in 1990, the three brothers reunited in ''[[Front Page (film)|Front Page]]'', a lampoon on Hong Kong's sometimes over-zealous entertainment news industry. Hui also collaborated with several popular singers such as [[Leslie Cheung]] both musically and on-screen culminating in the hit single written by Hui and composed by Cheung entitled ''Silence is Golden'' ({{lang|zh-hk|沉默是金}}), which Cheung also sung as a solo track on his 1987 album, ''[[Hot Summer (album)|Hot Summer]]'', as well as the catchy tune, ''I've Never Been Afraid'' (我未驚過) in 1989 as the end theme for ''[[Aces Go Places 5: The Terracotta Hit|Aces Go Places V]]''.

Hui also starred in the ''[[Aces Go Places]]'', a series of Hong Kong action–comedies in the 1980s, with [[Karl Maka]]. Hui held a farewell concert in 1991 and 1992, in which he invited many music celebrities and officially declared that he would not be active in the movie industry nor in [[Cantopop]] in the future. He was once seriously injured while filming ''[[The Legend of Wisely]]'' in [[Tibet]] due to lack of oxygen, thereafter falling very ill and many of his fans pointed out that this near fatal accident may have been pivotal on his decision to retire as they superstitiously believed that he was haunted by a spirit.

===Retirement===
During the late 1980s, Hui's father advised him to retire to avoid the stresses he endured from hosting concerts. Hui's "lack of oxygen" suffered on a previous film, was actually carbon monoxide poisoning. His mother purportedly also had reservations about his performing, including that he might injure himself on stage. A Hong Kong concert in 1990 supposedly marked his early retirement, however Hui then agreed to host a 42-show concert series. Around the time of the 30th show, Hui's father died but despite his grief, he continued to host. During 1991–1992, Hui hosted a total of 14 shows in Hong Kong preempting his actual retirement. He also hosted shows in Canada, in [[Vancouver]], at the [[Pacific Coliseum]], and [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], which he dedicated to his late father. Despite reiterating his plans for retirement, Hui came back for a short stint in the movie ''[[Winner Takes All (2000 film)|Winner Takes All]]'' co-starring [[Nicholas Tse]] and [[Ruby Lin]]. This he maintained, was a result of being unable to ignore his heart's desire.
[[File:Sam Hui's handprint.JPG|thumb|The handprint and autograph of Sam Hui at the [[Avenue of Stars, Hong Kong]]]]
Widely acclaimed as the "God of Song" in Hong Kong (the first singer to be so acknowledged), he decided to come out of retirement in 2004 and held multiple comeback concerts in which he was welcomed by a Hong Kong public at sell-out shows. In these concerts, he paid tribute to his recent passed close colleagues, [[Leslie Cheung]] and [[Anita Mui]] in 2003 and claimed that their deaths had influenced his decision to return to performing, culminating in his 2004 comeback song '''04 Bless You'' (04' 祝福你). Hui performed in a concert in [[Kuala Lumpur]] on 19 and 20 February 2005 with his brother, [[Ricky Hui]], and sons but has not made active plans for any follow-ups. He also performed in Vancouver on 15 December 2005 and in Singapore on 29 March 2008. In 2007, Hui signed with [[EC Music]] and released his first album in 17 years, named "Life is Good" ({{lang|zh-hk|人生多麼好}}).

==Personal life==
Hui is married to Filipino-American Rebecca "Rebu" Fleming, with whom he has two sons, Ryan and Scott. Ryan is also a singer-songwriter and has released several albums, while Scott has pursued a career in film, directing a few videos for his brother.

'''Stitch 'n Bitch''' is a name that has been used to refer to social knitting groups since at least World War II.&lt;ref name="idle"&gt;{{cite book |author=Macdonald, Anne L. |title=No Idle Hands: The Social History of American Knitting |publisher=Ballantine Books |location=[New York |year=1988 |pages=302 |isbn=0-345-33906-1 |url=http://www.cogknition.org/stitchnbitchdb/reference.php?id=73_0_4_0_M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the slang term “Stitch ‘n Bitch” was used, groups of women in the 1940s would join to knit and talk in organized Stitch and Bitch clubs.  The term was further used in the 1980s as part of the book ''Social History of American Knitting'' by Anne Macdonald.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brightman|first=Emilee|title=Crafty Ladies: Local knitting group not what you would expect|url=http://www.lakewoodobserver.com/read/2009/01/27/crafty-ladies-local-knitting-group-not|publisher=The Lakewood Observer|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is partly due to the book's success that the modern day Stitch n' Bitch knitting groups have emerged in cities around the world. The groups, mainly women, meet to knit, stitch and talk. Typically, attendees knit, though others crochet (they are called 'Happy Hookers'), and still others engage in cross-stitching, embroidery, and other needlecraft.  Nowadays, the groups have been analyzed by scholars as expressions of resistance to major political, social and technological change in Western societies. However, political discussion is not unusual at these events, and at least some participants are proponents of progressive, liberal, and/or leftist social and political change. Furthermore, the term Stitch ‘n' Bitch is now used by women from across the globe to connect with others in the virtual space seeing as the term has re-emerged in a world where the public sphere is the cyberspace.

With over 1460 registered Stitch ‘n Bitch groups in 289 cities worldwide, the social knitting movement has demarked itself as a popular social gathering for avid knitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stitch 'n Bitch|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Find a knitting group or start your own|url=http://stitchnbitch.org/|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Knitting groups==
''Stitch 'n Bitch'' is a name used by knitting groups that meet on a weekly or monthly basis at locations throughout the world.  This use of the term originates as early as the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="idle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news  | last = Elsworth | first = Catherine | title =  It's getting bitchy in knitting circles | work = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 2006-11-02 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/02/11/wknit11.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/02/11/ixworld.html | accessdate = 2007-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Debbie Stoller started a Stitch 'n Bitch group in NYC's East Village, which was open to anyone who wanted to come to knit along or learn to knit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} In 2000, she wrote about her groups in ''BUST'' magazine, of which she is the editor-in-chief. Brenda Janish read the article and started the Chicago Stitch 'n Bitch group.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} That article inspired Vickie Howell to start the Los Angeles Stitch 'n Bitch group and later the Austin Stitch 'n Bitch group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/nov/20/news/wk-alt20 "Sisters of the Stitch", L.A. Times, Nov. 20, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Like Stoller's original group, today's Stitch 'n Bitch clubs are generally casual groups of knitters who meet in public spaces such as bars or cafes for socializing and sharing knitting advice.  These groups are free or small fee required memberships and open to the public, and are listed in a directory of worldwide knitting groups that was started by Janish and today is maintained by Stoller:  Official Home of Stitch 'n Bitch. As of 2010, the site lists over 700 such groups.

==Book series and legal actions==
[[File:Stitch 'n Bitch Book Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The cover of the first book in the series of knitting books by Debbie Stoller, ''Stitch 'n Bitch: The Knitter's Handbook''.]]

A book series by Debbie Stoller, includes ''Stitch 'n Bitch" : The Knitter's Handbook'', ''Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker,'' and other titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoller|first=Debbie|title=Stitch 'n Bitch Crochet: The Happy Hooker|year=2006|publisher=Workman Publishing Company, Inc.|location=New York|pages=1–283}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2005 to 2008, Stitch 'n Bitch was the focus of a [[trademark]] dispute. In June 2005, the company [[Sew Fast Sew Easy]] filed a trademark application for ''Stitch &amp; Bitch'' to designate a line of knitting and sewing supplies. As of 2007 this application was suspended.&lt;ref name="S&amp;B"&gt;{{cite journal |author=United States Patent and Trademark Office | title = Serial Number: 78641350 | publisher = Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System | date = November 28, 2007 | url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=78641350&amp;action=Request+Status |accessdate=2007-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fall 2005, due to letters claiming [[trademark infringement]] from Sew Fast/Sew Easy's lawyers, knitting groups that had accounts with [[CafePress]] were forced to remove all items featuring the phrase "Stitch 'n Bitch". Local groups that communicated with each other through [[Yahoo! Groups]] were similarly forced to remove "Stitch 'n Bitch" from the name and description of their group.&lt;ref name="vogue"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Petrovsky | first = Lesley | title = Tempest in a Tea Cozy | journal = Vogue Knitting | date = Fall 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/vogueknit.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some groups were deleted, but most groups were able to change their name on Yahoo! to SNB.&lt;ref name="knit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Krementz | first = Cheryl | title = Stitch &amp; Bitch Slap | journal = Knit.1 | date = Summer 2006 | url = http://freetostitchfreetobitch.org/pdfs/knit1.gif | accessdate = 2007-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Sew Fast Sew Easy and Debbie Stoller reached a settlement in which Debbie Stoller retained the use of the mark in knitting while Sew Fast Sew Easy retains the use for sewing. Since then all four of Stoller's trademarks have now been registered. The Sew Fast Sew Easy store closed in 2012.

== Social implications ==
In recent years, the Stitch ‘n Bitch movement has been considered as a means of reclaiming women’s domestic work in feminist circles. Not only have groups officially been formed through website use, but groups of women on university campuses have also followed the trends in order to resist the taboo representation of the traditional woman.

Dr. Beth Ann Pentney, writing in Thirdspace journal, credited Stoller's publications with the rise of feminist knitting.  Stoller introduced this approach to feminism to merge political involvement with a women’s community-building activity set in a Do-It-Yourself culture.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pentney|first=Beth Ann|title=Feminism, Activism, and Knitting: Are the Fibre Arts a Viable Mode for Feminist Political Action?|journal=Third Space: a journal of feminist theory and culture|date=Summer 2008|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://www.thirdspace.ca/journal/article/viewArticle/pentney/210|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a response to Stoller, much scrutiny on the effectiveness of the reclamation of domestic arts as a political feminist act has been done. Some say that the reason of the reintroduction of knitting in modern social gatherings is mainly due to the increase in the search for individualism and the anti-consumerism attitude of our generation.&lt;ref name="Pentney 2008"/&gt; With this said, it is important to denote the implication of technologies in the emergence of a “fabriculture” based on the reclamation of domestic arts and crafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratich|first=Jack|author2=Brush, Heidi M. |title=Fabricating activism: Craft-Work, Popular Culture, Gender|journal=Utopian Studies|date=27 November 2011|volume=22|issue=2|pages=233–260|url=https://www.academia.edu/1117424/Fabricating_Activism_Craft-Work_Popular_Culture_Gender|accessdate=19 March 2013|doi=10.5325/utopianstudies.22.2.0233}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the internet accessibility of online information and tips and tricks for knitters and crocheters, the traditionally personal practice of knitting can now be shared easily among strangers, and is open to public discussion and new ideas. These webs of knitters worldwide find affinities via a very modern technology opposing the traditional DIY nature of knitting.

'''Vincent Anthony Crisostomo''' (born in February 6, 1961 in [[Tachikawa]], Japan) is a gay [[Asian Americans|Asian American]] [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] activist of [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] descent from [[Guam]]. He was diagnosed with AIDS in 1995. He currently serves as the Program Manager of the 50-Plus Network at the [[San Francisco AIDS Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SFAF: What's New With 50-Plus Network|url=http://www.sfaf.org/hiv-info/hot-topics/from-the-experts/whats-new-with-50-plus.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asian/Pacific AIDS resources|url=http://www.oocities.org/westhollywood/heights/5010/aids.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He Is Vince|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZediKOOCo|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal History ==
Crisostomo grew up [[Catholicism|Catholic]] in a religious family. He attended church frequently and was an altar boy as well as a member of the church choir. While the church provided a sense of community, it also promoted intolerance of homosexuality. Eventually, this prompted Crisostomo to leave the church and his home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=API Equality Northern California: The Need to Be|url=http://www.apiequalitync.org/2013/11/03/the-need-to-be/|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crisostomo met his partner Jesse Solomon in 1988 in [[New York City]]. Solomon was a physical therapist who worked with severely disabled children as well as a personal trainer and yoga teacher. They moved to San Francisco in 1990 and were one of the first 50 same-sex couples to register at the [[San Francisco City Hall]]. Solomon passed on October 6, 1991 of HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=API Equality Northern California: The Need to Be|url=http://www.apiequalitync.org/2013/11/03/the-need-to-be/|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== HIV/AIDS Work ==

=== Volunteering in New York City ===
Crisostomo began doing [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] work in 1985 when he was in New York City. One of his jobs was at a club where many patrons began falling sick. He volunteered to do hospital visits for the terminally ill HIV/AIDS patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=API Equality Northern California: The Need to Be|url=http://www.apiequalitync.org/2013/11/03/the-need-to-be/|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crisostomo himself contracted HIV in 1987 and was diagnosed with AIDS in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=He Is Vince|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqZediKOOCo|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GAPA Community HIV Project and Asian AIDS Project ===
In 1992, Crisostomo became an [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] educator in the Asian Pacific Islanders LGBTQ community through the GAPA Community HIV Project (GCHP) and the  Asian AIDS Project, which later merged to become the [[Asian &amp; Pacific Islander Wellness Center|API Wellness Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=API Equality Northern California: The Need to Be|url=http://www.apiequalitync.org/2013/11/03/the-need-to-be/|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=API Wellness Center: History|url=http://www.apiwellness.org/history.html|accessdate=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618001037/http://www.apiwellness.org/history.html|archive-date=June 18, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guam's [[World AIDS Day|World AIDS day]] in 1992 was also the day that Crisostomo became the first [[Chamorro people|Chamorro]] to publicly come out as living with AIDS. He continued to travel back to Guam and the Pacific area to provide assistance on [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] capacity building and service provision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS 2006 - XVI International AIDS Conference: Abstract|url=http://www.iasociety.org/Default.aspx?pageId=12&amp;abstractId=2195974|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coral Life Foundation ===
In 2001, Crisostomo moved from San Francisco to Guam to become the Executive Director of the Coral Life Foundation, a community-based organization working on [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] in the Asia-Pacific Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LinkedIn Profile: Vince Crisostomo|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pub/vince-crisostomo/5/319/364|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coral Life Foundation was the first NGO in the area to work on [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]]. In that capacity, Crisostomo convened representatives from the six Pacific Island Jurisdictions which included AIDS directors, program staff, community stakeholders, along with capacity-building assistance providers funded by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to discuss the state of HIV prevention and care services in their respective jurisdictions. From these discussions PIJAAG was formed to advocate for the provision of quality HIV prevention and care services and to advise national, international, and local policy entities on [[HIV/AIDS|HIV AIDS]] issues within the region. Under Crisostomo's leadership, PIJAAG successful advocacy led to a $600,000 increase in the region’s HIV Prevention budget, funding of 3 Planning Grants for Care Services and baseline awards for services to those Living with HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AIDS 2006 - XVI International AIDS Conference: Abstract|url=http://www.iasociety.org/Default.aspx?pageId=12&amp;abstractId=2195974|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Coral Life Foundation closed in 2002 and was replaced with [http://www.hivpolicy.org/biogs/HPE0353b.htm GuaHAN Project], otherwise known as the [http://www.pacificnewscenter.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18976:westcare-pacific-islands-guahan-project-and-gala-to-commemorate-world-aids-day-2011&amp;catid=45:guam-news&amp;Itemid=156 Guam HIV/AIDS Network].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health Services Directory:HIV/AIDS Network Project (GUAHAN)|url=http://directory.poz.com/company_details.shtml?action=details&amp;asoId=4141709000|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  The Coalition of Asia Pacific Regional Networks on HIV/AIDS (7 Sisters) ===
Crisostomo later became the Executive Director of 7 Sisters, a broad-based alliance of regional Asia Pacific HIV/AIDS networks based in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UN AIDS: Community representatives air regional concerns in the AIDS response|url=http://www.unaids.org/en/resources/presscentre/featurestories/2011/august/20110827bcf/|website=UN AIDS|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also served as [http://www.unaids.org/ UN AIDS] Asia Pacific NGO Delegate from 2009-2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vince Crisostomo, Asia Pacific NGO Delegate - 26th Board Meeting of UNAIDS|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIcRsQ90orw|website=YouTube|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Know Your Community Representatives and Contact Them|url=http://www.7sisters.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61:pcb-ngo-delegation&amp;catid=37:texts-for-7sisters&amp;Itemid=70|website=7 Sisters|accessdate=October 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William Walter Remington''' (October 25, 1917 &amp;ndash; November 24, 1954) was an [[economist]] employed in various federal government positions until his career was interrupted by accusations of [[espionage]] made by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy and defector [[Elizabeth Bentley]]. He was convicted of [[perjury]] in connection with these charges in 1953, and murdered in prison in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;

From an early age, he was drawn to radical leftist politics, and declared to his friends that he was a Communist when he was 15. In college, he became active with members of the [[Young Communist League, USA|Young Communist League]], and later the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party of the United States]]. In testimony, Remington stated that while he was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] when he entered college, he "moved left quite rapidly" and became a radical but was never a Communist Party or Young Communist League member at Dartmouth.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0713F73E5B127A93CAAB178AD85F458585F9 "The Nation; Draft Arithmetic"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 28, 1951. Accessed June 19, 2008. "He went to Dartmouth a Republican but 'moved left quite rapidly' and considered himself a 'radical.' He was not a member of the Communist party or Young Communist League but occasionally told other students in jest that he was a 'bolshevik.'"&lt;/ref&gt; Whether or not he ever officially joined the party later became a point of contention in his legal battles.

Remington was employed in a number of posts, principally as an economist:
*[[Tennessee Valley Authority]], [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], September 1936 to May 1937
* Workers Education Committee, Knoxville, April to August 1937
*Junior Economist with the [[National Resources Planning Board]], [[Washington, D.C.]], May 1940 to July 15, 1941
*Associate industrial economist in the [[Office of Price Administration]] of the [[Office for Emergency Management]], from July 1941 to February 1942;
*Assistant to the Director of the [[War Production Board]], February 1942 to October 1943
*Assistant to the Director of Orders and Regulations Bureau in the War Production Board, October 1943 to 1946
*[[Council of Economic Advisers|President's Council of Economic Advisers]], March 1947 to March 1948&lt;ref name=NYT19480910&gt;Trussell, C. P.

Accessed June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

For his position with the Office of Price Administration, Remington was required to undergo a loyalty-security check, which began in 1941. He admitted having been active in Communist-allied groups such as the [[American Peace Mobilization]], but denied any sympathy with communism and swore under oath that he was not and had never been a member of the Communist Party. His leftist affiliations raised concerns, but the investigation was superficial and his security clearance was approved.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

==Accusations of espionage==
In March 1942 and continuing for two years, Remington had occasional meetings with [[Elizabeth Bentley]] at which he passed her information. This material included data on airplane production and other matters concerning the aircraft industry, as well as some information on an experimental process for manufacturing [[synthetic rubber]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,805638,00.html "A Woman's Memories"], ''[[Time (magazine)]]'', January 8, 1951. Accessed June 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Remington later claimed that he was unaware that Bentley was connected with the Communist Party, that he believed she was a journalist and researcher, and that the information he gave her was not secret. Bentley was a Communist and an espionage agent for the [[Soviet Union]], who in 1945 broke with the Communists and became an informer for the FBI. She then implicated a number of her contacts, including Remington. Bentley's revelations of Soviet espionage activities in the United States received a great deal of press attention. She identified more than 80 Americans—including several employees of government offices—as working for the Soviets, of whom only William Remington was still working in a government position.

Acting on Bentley's information, the FBI began secret surveillance of Remington in late 1945. Remington was by this time disillusioned with communism and had broken off his relationships with radical organizations, so the investigation revealed nothing of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1994|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1946, Remington was working with the [[Office of War Mobilization|Office of War Mobilization and Reconversion]]. From there he transferred in March 1947 to a position with the [[Council of Economic Advisers|President's Council of Economic Advisers]], where he was paid an annual salary of $10,305.&lt;ref name=NYT19480910/&gt; Because the FBI was keeping Bentley's testimony and its investigation of Remington secret, it raised no objection, with the result that Remington remained in fairly high-level government posts.

In 1947, Remington was interviewed by the FBI and also questioned before a federal [[grand jury]] in [[New York City]] about the information he had given to Elizabeth Bentley. He testified that no secret information was involved, and the issue seemed to end there. In an apparent attempt to bolster belief in his innocence, Remington became an [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] [[informant|informer]] from this time and for the following year. He sent the FBI information on over fifty people, only four of whom were connected with his own case. Most of those he named he had never met. He accused them of being Communists, isolationists, Negro nationalists, or "extreme liberals." He also verbally attacked his wife Ann, from whom he was now estranged, and his mother-in-law Elizabeth Moos, both avowed Communists.

Another loyalty investigation of Remington was opened early in 1948, and in June, he was relieved of his duties pending the findings of that investigation. In July of that year, the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' published a series of articles about Elizabeth Bentley, and the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]] opened hearings to investigate her charges. At these hearings, Bentley made her accusations against Remington public and Remington in turn denied them. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' called him "a boob...who was duped by clever Communist agents." At his loyalty review hearings, Remington downplayed his earlier connections with Communist and leftist organizations and claimed that his wife's adherence to Communist doctrine was the reason for the end of their marriage.

While testifying before the Senate, Bentley was protected from libel suits. When she repeated her charge that Remington was a Communist on [[NBC|NBC Radio]]'s ''[[Meet the Press]]'', he sued her and NBC for libel. At this point, Remington's case acquired considerable notoriety. When Remington's lawyers attempted to subpoena Bentley, she initially could not be found, prompting headlines of "RED WITNESS "MISSING" AT 100-G SLANDER SUIT" and the like. When she finally reappeared, she was subpoenaed for the libel suit. She refused to testify at Remington's loyalty hearing. The [[Loyalty Review Board]] noted that the only serious evidence against Remington was "the uncorroborated statement of a woman who refuses to submit herself to cross-examination,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May| 1994 |p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and cleared Remington to return to his government post. The libel suit was settled out of court shortly thereafter, with NBC paying Remington $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Other Voices |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820552,00.html |quote=When ex-Spy Bentley repeated her charge on a television show, Remington sued for $100,000 slander, settled out of court, reportedly for $10,000. |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=May 15, 1950 |accessdate=2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second round of investigations==
[[File:Ann Remington NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Ann Remington in Federal Court]]
In 1950, the FBI and the federal grand jury in New York City reopened their investigations of Remington and the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) opened a third. Because of continuing suspicions about him, Remington had been demoted at the Commerce Department, and his once-promising career in the Truman administration was stagnant. Ann Remington, now divorced from him,&lt;ref&gt;Remington was married twice.  His second wife was Jane Alben.  He had two children, Galeyn and Bruce, with Ann Moos, and a second son, Neil, with Jane Alben.  Jane Alben died in 1994; Ann Moos died in 2015.  See [http://brucelarochelle.wordpress.com/2012/05/05/remington-william-and-neil/ Remington: William and Neil], May 5, 2012.  Retrieved 2012-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury. Initially reluctant, she testified that her husband had been a dues-paying member of the Communist Party, and that he had given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley while knowing that Bentley was a Communist.&lt;ref name=remcase&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Remington Case; Prosecution's Witness |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/12/31/archives/the-remington-case-prosecutions-witness.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 31, 1950 |accessdate=2008-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later she recanted, and stated that she would claim [[Spousal privilege|marital privilege]] and refuse to testify against her ex-husband in any trial. The grand jury decided to indict Remington for committing perjury when he denied ever being a member of the Communist Party.

==Two trials==
Remington's first trial began in late December 1950. [[Roy Cohn]], later to become famous as [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s chief counsel and already a noted anti-communist, joined the prosecution's legal team. "Elizabeth Bentley later supplied a wealth of detail about Remington's involvement with her and the espionage conspiracy. Remington's defense was that he had never handled any classified material, hence could not have given any to Miss Bentley. But she remembered all the facts about the rubber-from-garbage invention. We had searched through the archives and discovered the files on the process. We also found the aircraft schedules, which were set up exactly as she said, and inter office memos and tables of personnel which proved Remington had access to both these items. We also discovered Remington's application for a naval commission in which he specifically pointed out that he was, in his present position with the Commerce Department, entrusted with secret military information involving airplanes, armaments, radar, and the Manhattan Project (the atomic bomb)." &lt;ref&gt;Roy Cohn, McCarthy (1968) page 38&lt;/ref&gt;

During the trial eleven witnesses claimed they knew Remington was a communist. This included Elizabeth Bentley, Ann Remington, Professor Howard Bridgeman of Tufts University, Kenneth McConnell, a Communist organizer in Knoxville, Rudolph Bertram and Christine Benson, who worked with him at the Tennessee Valley Authority and [[Paul Crouch (activist)|Paul Crouch]], who provided him with copies of the southern edition of the communist newspaper, the Daily Worker.&lt;ref&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/William_Remington.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ann Remington reversed herself again and testified that her ex-husband had been a Communist Party member and that he had knowingly given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley. Bentley testified, repeating her charge that Remington had given her secret information, saying with regard to the synthetic rubber formula, "He said to me that...he thought that the Russians would need something very much like this."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May| 1994 |p=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecution also showed that Remington had handled secret documents that were somewhat similar to the aircraft production information that Bentley said she received from Remington.

During the trial, the defense attorneys revealed that John Brunini, the foreman of the grand jury that indicted Remington, had a personal and financial relationship with Elizabeth Bentley and had agreed to co-author a book with her.

Remington was convicted after a seven-week trial. Judge Gregory E. Noonan handed down a sentence of five years - the maximum for perjury - noting that Remington's act of perjury had involved disloyalty to his country. Remington's conviction was celebrated by many. A  ''[[The Washington Daily News|Washington Daily News]]'' editorial said: "William W. Remington now joins the odiferous list of young Communist punks who wormed their way upward in the Government under the New Deal. He was sentenced to five years in prison, and he should serve every minute of it. In Russia, he would have been shot without trial."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1994|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Remington's attorneys appealed the verdict, and the judicial panel hearing the case included Judge [[Learned Hand]], one of America's most eminent jurists. The conviction was overturned on the grounds that Judge Noonan's instructions to the jury were too vague as to exactly what constituted "membership" in the Communist Party, and a new trial was ordered. Hand also criticized grand jury foreman John Brunini and Thomas Donegan, the assistant to the Attorney General who directed the grand jury investigation, for Brunini's relationship with Bentley and for "judicial improprieties" in their abusive treatment of both Ann and William Remington during questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May| 1994 |p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of retrying Remington under the existing indictment, the government presented a new one charging Remington with five counts of perjury based on his testimony during the first trial. The charge from the first trial, that he perjured himself when denying he had ever been a Communist Party member, was not included.

The second Remington trial began in January 1953 with Judge Vincent L. Leibell presiding. It lasted only eight days. The jury found Remington guilty of two counts, for lying when he said he had not given secret information to Elizabeth Bentley and that he did not know of the existence of the Young Communist League, which had a chapter at Dartmouth while Remington was a student there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remington Convicted |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,889623,00.html |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]| date= February 9, 1953 |accessdate=2008-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Leibell sentenced Remington to three years in prison. While his attorneys prepared another appeal, Remington began his sentence at [[Danbury Federal Correctional Institution]] where he became friends with fellow prisoner, nonviolent action theorist [[Gene Sharp]], before being transferred to Lewisburg. The appeals court upheld the original verdict, and in February 1954, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] refused to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Remington |court=[[United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit]] |date=November 24, 1953 |url=https://www.fastcase.com/Google/Start.aspx?C=9c9e2bbdd854c5b943efab301b1cbcce05234b1faa1fd219&amp;D=cdf46080dab20e2ad8f3c7a284c2920bb2420431fdee35ef }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and murder==
One of Remington's fellow inmates at Lewisburg was George McCoy, a violent man with an I.Q. of 61. McCoy was known to have made a number of angry remarks about Remington's communism. On the morning of November 22, 1954, McCoy convinced another inmate, 17-year-old juvenile delinquent Lewis Cagle, Jr., to join him in attacking Remington as he slept. Cagle used a piece of brick in a sock as a weapon, striking Remington four times on the head.&lt;ref name=time/&gt; Two days later, Remington died of his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Remington Dies in Prison. 2 Inmates Named as Killers. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/11/25/archives/remington-dies-in-prison-2-inmates-named-as-killers-remington-is.html |publisher=[[New York Times]] |date=November 25, 1954

Press attention focused on whether more should have been done to protect him in prison, and whether his murder was motivated by anti-communism. When Cagle confessed, the FBI instructed him to describe the crime as if he and McCoy had been trying to rob Remington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May|1994|p=314}}&lt;/ref&gt;
When McCoy confessed four days later, he said he hated Remington for being a Communist and denied any robbery motive.

Worried that Cagle and McCoy's confessions might be ruled inadmissible and afraid that a jury would be sympathetic towards men who murdered a Communist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May| 1994 |p=318}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. attorney J. Julius Levy accepted pleas of second degree murder from McCoy and Cagle. They received life sentences.

Remington's biographer Gary May concludes: "Clearly, Remington was no political innocent duped by the Communists, and his conviction for perjury seems justified. Yet Remington was no pro-Soviet automaton, no slave to Party or ideology, and not even the FBI, at least privately, was willing to classify him as a Russian spy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|May| 1994 |p=321}}&lt;/ref&gt;
