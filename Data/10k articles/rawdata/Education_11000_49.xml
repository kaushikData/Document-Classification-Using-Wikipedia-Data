      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3274">An '''adult educator''' is one who practices the profession of [[Facilitator|facilitating]] the learning of [[adults]] by applying the principles of [[androgogy]].   The broader term of trainer is sometimes used for an adult educator when listing job categories.  However, a trainer is not necessarily an adult educator.  As [[Malcolm Knowles]] proposes, to be a successful adult educator, one must recognize that [[adult learner]]s are self-directed.  That is, they know basically what they need to learn at a given point in their career and seek to engage in the process of their learning through active participation.

==Work==
The adult educator applies the principles of adult learning to the six phases of course development: determining learner needs; writing learning objectives to fulfill those needs; creating a learning plan; selecting learning methodologies geared to the adult learner; implementing the learning plan; and evaluating the degree to which the learning objectives have been met. Central to the creation of the learning plan is the realization of how adults learn most naturally and incorporating that knowledge into every aspect of the practice of [[adult education]].

Adult learners tend to be very [[practical]] learners.  That is, they wish to see the application of their learning almost immediately.  To better insure that this happens, the adult educator must understand the basics of the work, the work [[social environment|environment]] and the challenges facing the adults engaged in that work.  This information is obtained during the needs assessment phase of course development.

Knowles' [[theories]] on adult education were further enhanced by the work of [[David A. Kolb]].  Kolb proposes that adult learners learn through reflective observation, [[abstraction|abstract]] conceptualization, active experimentation, and concrete experience. Kolb recommends that adult educators create learning plans that incorporate the four learning styles so as to make learning more successful.

We see adult educators in many contexts.  They teach adults in [[university]] settings, in [[government organizations]] and in for [[Profit (accounting)|profit]] companies.  When Knowles wrote about adult education in the 1950s, he was referring to the classroom environment. Today with the opportunities presented through elearning, the adult educator can reach adult learners virtually any time, anywhere.

The term is attributed to Malcolm Knowles, an [[United States|American]] educator, who wrote The Modern Practice of Adult Education: From Pedagogy to Androgogy (1980).

Kolb identifies four basic ways adults learn through his studies of how adults take-in (prehend) knowledge and how they apply (transform) knowledge into practice.

The '''All India Council for Technical Education''' ('''AICTE''') is the statutory body and a national-level council for technical education, under [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]], [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry of Human Resource Development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/tech/tech_overview.asp Technical Education Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005200745/http://www.education.nic.in/tech/tech_overview.asp |date=5 October 2011 }} [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Established in November 1945 first as an advisory body and later on in 1987 given statutory status by an Act of Parliament, AICTE is responsible for proper planning and coordinated development of the [[Vocational education|technical education]] and [[Business education|management education]] system in [[India]]. The AICTE [[school accreditation|accredits]] postgraduate and graduate programs under specific categories at Indian institutions as per its charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aicte.ernet.in/AICTEAct.htm&amp;ei=RmACS8LoB8a9kAX_1_C2AQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=smap&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result&amp;cd=4&amp;ved=0CAwQqwMoAw&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_vY0_Q3MLUmibDPw65UwhFLb_Zw AICTE Act] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is assisted by 10 Statutory Boards of Studies, namely, UG Studies in Eng. &amp; Tech., PG and Research in Eng. and Tech., Management Studies, Vocational Education, Technical Education, Pharmaceutical Education, Architecture, Hotel Management and Catering Technology, Information Technology, Town and Country Planning. The AICTE has its new headquarters building in Delhi on the Nelson Mandela Road, Vasant Kunj, New Delhi, 110 067, which has the offices of the chairman, vice-chairman and the member secretary, plus it has regional offices at  Kanpur, Chandigarh, Gurgaon, Mumbai, Bhopal, Baroda, Kolkata, Guwahati, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai and Thiruvananthapuram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.nic.in/tech/tech_if-nlc.asp National Level Councils] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201175923/http://education.nic.in/tech/tech_if-nlc.asp |date=1 February 2010 }} Tech Ed., [[Department of Higher Education (India)|Department of Higher Education]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In its 25 April 2013 judgement the Supreme Court said "as per provisions of the AICTE Act and [[University Grants Commission Act, 1956|University Grants Commission (UGC) Act]], the council has no authority which empowers it to issue or enforce any sanctions on colleges affiliated with the universities as its role is to provide guidance and recommendations.Subsequently AICTE was getting approval from the Supreme court to regulate technical colleges on a year to year basis till January 2016, when AICTE got blanket approval for publishing the Approval Process Handbook and approve technical colleges including management for the session 2016-17 and in all future sessions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = AICTE to appeal Supreme Court order stating its role as 'advisory' | date = 30 April 2013| publisher = PTI | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-30/news/38929467_1_mba-and-mca-courses-colleges-universities | work = The Times of India | accessdate = 11 January 2014 }},&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reforms ==
In 2016, three important initiatives were taken up by AICTE. First one was a responsibility given by MHRD to evolve a national MOOCs platform SWAYAM. Second one is that of launching a Smart India Hackathon-2017 challenging the young bright talented students of technical colleges to solve the 598 problems of 29 different Government departments. Third one is that of launching of an AICTE's Student Start up Policy by Hon. President on Nov 16, during visitors conference from rashtrapati Bhavan. In 2009, the Union Minister of Education formally communicated his intentions of closing down AICTE and related body, the [[University Grants Commission (India)|University Grants Commission]] (UGC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://igovernment.in/site/UGC-AICTE-to-be-scrapped-Sibal/ |title=UGC, AICTE to be scrapped: Sibal |publisher=iGovernment.in |accessdate=29 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009152552/http://igovernment.in/site/UGC-AICTE-to-be-scrapped-Sibal |archivedate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This later led to reforms in the way the AICTE approves institutes, and to establishing the [[National Board of Accreditation]] (NBA) as an independent body.&lt;ref name=bs-accredit&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/aicte-to-revamp-its-approval-system-next-week/382076/ |title=AICTE to revamp its approval system next week |work=Business Standard |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2013}} the AICTE still operates.

On June 6, 2017, Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that the AICTE along with the University Grants Commission would be scrapped and replaced by a new body called Heera (Higher Education Empowerment Regulation Agency (HEERA). This has been done in a bid to simplify the excessive regulations that exist due to both these bodies.

Candidates are selected to Senior High Schools by the Computerized School Selection and Placement System (CSSPS)-The Computerized School Selection and Placement System - a computerized system used by the Ghana Education Service (GES) to place qualified Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) candidates fairly into Senior High School, Technical Institutes, and the Vocational Institution Institute

==Review of scripts==

Scripts are kept for three months after the release of results before they are finally destroyed. During this time, review of scripts for a fee is allowed and this is done through the head of a school or an accredited representative of the school since the Basic Education Certificate Examination is a school-based examination.

==Certification==

Certificates for successful candidates are produced within a month after results are released. They are sent to the schools for collection by individual candidates. Certificates are produced once, and so certificates which get lost or damaged after collection are not replaced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Education Certificate Examinations|url=http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|website=WAEC Ghana|publisher=The West African Examinations Council, Ghana|accessdate=4 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519130523/http://www.ghanawaec.org/EXAMS/BECE.aspx|archive-date=2014-05-19|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2015 Cancellation==

The 2015 edition of the BECE started on Monday June 15 with the English Language and Religious and Moral Education papers, and was originally scheduled to end on Friday June 19 with the Information Communication Technology (ICT) paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amoh |first1=Emmanuel |title=2015 BECE begins today |url=http://tv3network.com/all-news/education/2015-bece-begins-today.html |accessdate=4 July 2015 |publisher=TV3 Network |date=15 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150705012035/http://tv3network.com/all-news/education/2015-bece-begins-today.html |archivedate=5 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday June 17, which was two days into the examinations, the West Africa Examinations Council cancelled five subjects claiming the papers had been 'compromised' and the cancellation was necessary to safeguard both the sanctity of the examinations and the integrity of certificates issued by the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeboah|first1=Isaac|title=WAEC cancels 5 BECE papers|url=http://graphic.com.gh/news/education/44794-waec-cancels-5-bece-papers.html|accessdate=4 July 2015|publisher=Daily Graphic}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the official statement to announce the cancellation, WAEC explained that the leakage was so widespread that some questions were being shared using the [[WhatsApp]] messaging platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WAEC Cancels 5 BECE Papers|url=http://thechronicle.com.gh/waec-cancels-5-bece-papers/|website=The Chronicle|publisher=The Ghanaian Chronicle|accessdate=4 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following papers were cancelled:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3951">'''Bruno Jakob Thüring''' (7 September 1905 in [[Warmensteinach]] &amp;ndash; 6 May 1989 in [[Karlsruhe]]) was a German [[physicist]] and [[astronomer]].

Thüring studied mathematics, physics, and astronomy at the [[University of Munich]] and received his doctorate in 1928, under Alexander Wilkens and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/html/id.phtml?id=62133 Thüring] - 
1928 Dissertation title: ''Darstellung der Bewegung eines Planeten der Jupitergruppe durch eine absolute Störungstheorie''. Advisor 1: Alexander Wilkens. Advisor 2: Arnold Sommerfeld.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilkens was professor of astronomy and director of the Munich Observatory, which was part of the University. From 1928 to 1933, he was an assistant at the Munich [[Observatory]]. From 1934 to 1935, he was an assistant to [[Heinrich Vogt (astronomer)|Heinrich Vogt]] at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. Thüring completed his [[Habilitation]] there in 1935, whereupon he became an Observator at the Munich Observatory. In 1937, Thüring became a lecturer (Dozent) at the University of Munich. From 1940 to 1945, he held the chair for astronomy at the [[University of Vienna]] and was director of the [[Vienna Observatory]]. After 1945, Thüring lived as a private scholar in [[Karlsruhe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.friedensblitz.de/sterne/krieg/Thuering.html Thüring] – Biographical Note Friedenblitz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-konstanz.de/FuF/Philo/philarchiv/bestaende/Thuering.htm Thüring] – Biographical Note Konstanz&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://litten.de/fulltext/cara.htm Wilkens1] and [http://litten.de/fulltext/gross.htm Wilkens2] – Professor of Astronomy and Director of the Munich Observatory.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsw.uni-heidelberg.de/users/mdarr/history.html Vogt] – LSW University of Heidelberg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepage.univie.ac.at/franz.kerschbaum/Publications/thuering_wien_vs5.pdf Thüring] – University of Vienna&lt;/ref&gt;

During the reign of [[Adolf Hitler]], Thüring was a proponent of [[Deutsche Physik]], as were the two Nobel Prize–winning physicists [[Johannes Stark]] and [[Philipp Lenard]]; ''Deutsche Physik'', was [[anti-Semitic]] and had a bias against [[theoretical physics]], especially including [[quantum mechanics]]. He was also a student of the [[philosophy]] of [[Hugo Dingler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.uni-hamburg.de/spag/ign/events/pdf/kerschb05.pdf Thüring’s Polemic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 1971, pp. 525-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CIPP evaluation model''' is a [[Program evaluation]] model which was developed by Daniel Stufflebeam and colleagues in the 1960s. CIPP is an acronym for Context, Input, Process and Product. CIPP is an evaluation model that requires the evaluation of '''context''', '''input''', '''process''' and '''product''' in judging a programme’s value. CIPP is a decision-focused approach to evaluation and emphasises the systematic provision of information for [[programme management]] and operation.&lt;ref name = "Robinson"&gt;Robinson, B. (2002). The CIPP has its formation from the earlier stages where there were no paragraphs or any acronyms for any product or stanzas. The CIPP approach to evaluation.Collit project: A background note from Bernadette&lt;/ref&gt;

==CIPP model==
The CIPP framework was developed as a means of linking evaluation with programme [[decision-making]]. It aims to provide an analytic and rational basis for programme decision-making, based on a cycle of planning, structuring, implementing and reviewing and revising decisions, each examined through a different aspect of evaluation –context, input, process and product evaluation.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

The CIPP model is an attempt to make evaluation directly relevant to the needs of decision-makers during the phases and activities of a programme.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt; Stufflebeam’s context, [[Factor of production|input]], process, and [[Product breakdown structure|product]] (CIPP) evaluation model is recommended as a framework to systematically guide the conception, design, [[implementation]], and assessment of service-learning projects, and provide feedback and judgment of the project’s effectiveness for continuous improvement.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

==Four aspects of CIPP evaluation==
These aspects are context, inputs, process, and product. These four aspects of CIPP evaluation assist a decision-maker to answer four basic questions:
*What should we do?
This involves collecting and analysing needs assessment data to determine goals, priorities and objectives. For example, a context evaluation of a literacy program might involve an analysis of the existing objectives of the literacy programme, literacy achievement test scores, staff concerns (general and particular), literacy policies and plans and community concerns, perceptions or attitudes and needs.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*How should we do it?
This involves the steps and resources needed to meet the new goals and objectives and might include identifying successful external programs and materials as well as gathering information.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*Are we doing it as planned?
This provides decision-makers with information about how well the programme is being implemented. By continuously monitoring the program, decision-makers learn such things as how well it is following the plans and guidelines, conflicts arising, staff support and morale, strengths and weaknesses of materials, delivery and budgeting problems.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;
*Did the programme work?
By measuring the actual outcomes and comparing them to the anticipated outcomes, decision-makers are better able to decide if the program should be continued, modified, or dropped altogether. This is the essence of product evaluation.&lt;ref name = Robinson/&gt;

==Using CIPP in the different stages of the evaluation==
The CIPP model is unique as an [[evaluation]] guide as it allows evaluators to evaluate the program at different stages, namely: before the program commences by helping evaluators to assess the need and at the end of the program to assess whether or not the program had an effect.

CIPP model allows you to ask formative questions at the beginning of the program, then later gives you a guide of how to evaluate the programs impact by allowing you to ask summative questions on all aspects of the program.
*'''Context''': What needs to be done? Vs. Were important needs addressed?
*'''Input''': How should it be done? Vs. Was a defensible design employed?
*'''Process''': Is it being done? Vs. Was the design well executed?
*'''Product''': Is it succeeding? Vs. Did the effort succeed?

'''Calculus One''' is a [[massive open online course]] by [[Ohio State University]] on [[Coursera]] and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Calculus One|url = https://www.coursera.org/learn/calculus1|website = Coursera|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course features over 25 hours of video and exercises. The instructor is Jim Fowler, an [[assistant professor]] of mathematics at the Ohio State University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jim Fowler(OSU)|url = https://www.coursera.org/instructor/jimfowler|website = Coursera|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course was available for the first time on [[Coursera]] during the Spring Semester of 2012–13. More than 47,000 students enrolled in the course, and several thousand successfully completed the 15-week course,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Calculus One by Jim Fowler|url = http://kisonecat.com/teaching/2013/calculus-one/|website = kisonecat|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been favorably reviewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Calculus One|url = https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/coursera/courses/calculus-one|website = CourseTalk {{!}} MOOC Reviews &amp; Ratings|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Course Overview ==
The course begins with an introduction to [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] and [[Limit of a function|limits]], and goes on to explain [[derivative]]s. By the end of this course, the student will have learnt the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], [[chain rule]], derivatives of [[transcendental function]]s, [[Integral|integration]], and applications of all these in the real world. This course is followed by Calculus Two.

== Development ==
[[File:Massive Online Open calculus Logo(Calculus One Logo).jpg|thumb|MOOCulus Logo]]Calculus One course was initially released on [[Coursera]] in the Spring Semester of 2012–13.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Calculus One – ''k''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 cat – Jim Fowler|url = http://kisonecat.com/teaching/2013/calculus-one/|website = kisonecat.com|accessdate = 2015-05-19|first = Jim|last = Fowler}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''MOOCulus''', an online platform that lets you practice Calculus was developed at the Ohio State University to provide students a place to practice Calculus problems. The platform, which was built using [[Ruby on Rails]] was built because Coursera didn't offer an engaging way to practice problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MOOCulus for Calculus Fun: An Interview with Tom Evans|url = http://etcjournal.com/2013/07/11/mooculus-for-calculus-fun-an-interview-with-tom-evans/|website = Educational Technology and Change Journal|accessdate = 2015-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What I learned from MOOCulus|url = https://sloopie72.wordpress.com/2013/04/19/what-i-learned-from-mooculus/|website = A Just Recompense|accessdate = 2015-05-19|first = Karen|last = Carlson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The whole course, which consists of 200+ videos, was typeset as a [[textbook]] on April 10, 2014.

'''Chris Smith''' - "the Naked Scientist" - is a consultant virologist and a lecturer based at [[Cambridge University]] where he is a fellow of [[Queens' College, Cambridge|Queens' College]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He is also a science [[radio]] [[Radio presenter|broadcaster]] and [[writer]], and presents ''[[the Naked Scientists]]'', a programme which he founded in 2001, for BBC Radio and other networks internationally, as well as ''5 live Science'' on [[BBC Radio Five Live|BBC Radio 5 Live]].

== Career ==
In addition to the Naked Scientists, he appears live every Friday morning on Australia's ABC [[Radio National Breakfast]] with [[Fran Kelly]], supplying an update of the week's leading science news &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/breakfast/science-with-chris-smith-dinosaur-discovery/9213980 ABC Radio National Breakfast Science Reports]&lt;/ref&gt;. He is also a contributor to [[Robyn Williams]]' ''The Science Show'' on the same station, and also appears on Johannesburg-based South African station [[Radio 702|TalkRadio 702]] for thirty minutes every Friday morning with a half hour science news round up and listener question phone-in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.702.co.za/articles/12416/naked-scientist-live-from-702 Naked Scientist, Talk Radio 702]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radio New Zealand National|Radio New Zealand National's]] ''This Way Up'' show, hosted by journalist Simon Morton on Saturdays, also includes a ''Naked Science'' contribution from Chris, and since 2013 [[BBC Radio Norfolk]] have been running a Naked Scientists Wednesday teatime science phone-in as part of their Drive Time offering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p016bk2n Naked Scientist on BBC Radio Norfolk]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until May 2014, Smith provided a weekly 25 minute science round up for [[BBC Radio Five Live|BBC Radio 5 Live]]'s ''[[Up All Night (radio show)|Up All Night]]'' programme every Monday. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0070h86/broadcasts/2014/01 5 live Up All Night]&lt;/ref&gt; This was replaced by the new weekly one-hour ''5 live Science'' programme, which is also produced by Smith and his colleagues and airs on Sunday mornings and sometimes repeated on a Sunday evening&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b043wvt9 5 live Science, BBC Radio 5 live]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Smith also founded and presented the first 100 episodes of the ''Nature Podcast'' for the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 2005.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} This show was the first example of an international science journal producing an audio programme to supplement its printed content.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} He has also contributed podcast content for the open access publishing group PLoS ([[Public Library of Science]]), he launched and hosted the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]'s "Chemistry World" Podcast for nearly 10 years and, in 2013, launched the monthly ''eLife Podcast'' for the open access online journal ''[[eLife]]''.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thenakedscientists.com/elife The eLife Podcast]&lt;/ref&gt; which he currently presents.

==Naked Scientists Podcast==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2016}}
Launched by Smith in 2005, it was also the first example of a BBC local and regional programme to be published as a podcast;{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} within its first twelve months it received 2 million programme downloads.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

In January 2010, Smith's ''The Naked Scientists'' group announced on Twitter that, just ahead of the 10th anniversary of the project's launch, the number of downloaded programme episodes had hit 10 million internationally. At a presentation at the 2011 AAAS Meeting in Washington DC, Smith showed that, by February 2011, over 17 million episodes of the Naked Scientists podcast had been downloaded globally. More recently, during a 2014 visit to Perth, Western Australia, where Smith holds a Sir Walter Murdoch Distinguished Adjunct Professorship at Murdoch University, he announced that the number of downloads exceeds 40 million.

==Books==
In September 2006 Chris Smith published ''Naked Science'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenakedscientists.com/book Naked Science]&lt;/ref&gt; his first book, which is an anthology of science stories based on the material presented on ''The Naked Scientists''. This was followed, in September 2008, by ''Crisp Packet Fireworks'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenakedscientists.com/HTML/front/crisp-packet-fireworks/ Crisp Packet Fireworks]&lt;/ref&gt; a collection of 50 science experiments to try at home using every-day ingredients found in the average kitchen. This title, which was co-authored with Naked Scientist colleague David Ansell and published by New Holland, was initially launched across in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. In January 2010 it was also published across South Africa by Struik and Random House under the title ''Maverick Science'', and launched in the US in April 2010 as ''Spectacular Science''.

In December 2008 Chris also published a sequel to ''Naked Science'', ''The Return of the Naked Scientist'', with Random House in Australia and New Zealand. He released a fourth book, ''Stripping Down Science'', also with Random House Australia, in December 2010.

[[File:Oxford High Street Facing West, Oxford, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|The [[High Street, Oxford|High Street]] of [[Oxford]], a prototypical example of a university town. There is no central campus, rather university buildings are scattered around the city between shops, for example those at centre right of the picture.]]
A '''college town''' or '''university town''' is a community (often a separate [[town]] or [[city]], but in some cases a town/city [[neighborhood]] or a [[district]]) that is dominated by its [[university]] population. The university may be large, or there may be several smaller institutions such as [[liberal arts colleges]] clustered, or the residential population may be small, but college towns in all cases are so dubbed because the presence of the educational institution(s) pervades economic and social life. Many local residents may be employed by the university&amp;mdash;which may be the largest employer in the community&amp;mdash;many businesses cater primarily to the university, and the student population may outnumber the local population. In the United States over the past few decades, so-called "college towns" have cropped up near colleges and universities, but these are distinctly commercial enterprises designed and built by commercial development companies and consisting of shops and, in some cases, upscale housing. They are, in effect, small shopping plazas, often built to vaguely resemble a college "quad."

==Description==
In Europe, a university town is generally characterised by having an [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation#Western universities founded before 1500|ancient university]]. The economy of the city is closely related with the university activity and highly supported by the entire university structure, which may include university hospitals and clinics, printing houses, libraries, laboratories, business incubators, student rooms, dining halls, students' unions, student societies, and academic festivities. Moreover, the history of the city is often intertwined with that of the university. Many European university towns have not been merely important places of science and education, but also centres of political, cultural and social influence throughout the centuries.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

Besides a highly educated and largely transient population, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] college town often has many people in non-traditional lifestyles and subcultures and with a high tolerance for unconventionality in general, and has a very active musical or cultural scene. The majority of the population is usually politically [[liberalism|liberal]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Many have become centres of technological research and innovative [[Startup company|startups]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Town–gown relations==
{{Main|Town and gown}}
As in the case of a [[company town]], the large and transient university population may come into conflict with other townspeople. Students may come from outside the area, and perhaps subscribe to a different&amp;mdash;sometimes radically different&amp;mdash;culture.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Most students are young people, whose living habits may be different from older people.

Economically, the high spending power of the university and of its students in aggregate may [[inflation|inflate]] the [[cost of living]] above that of the region. It is common for university employees to commute from surrounding areas, finding the cost of living in town too expensive.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

'''Studentification''', in which a growing student population move in large numbers to traditionally non-student neighborhoods, may be perceived as a form of invasion or [[gentrification]]. It may be due to university enrollment expanding beyond the capacity of on-campus housing, inadequate zoning enforcement, and/or student culture. Neighborhood associations may work to limit conversion of family homes to student rentals, while some local residents may oppose the construction of large on-campus dormitories or expansion of [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity and sorority]] houses, forcing a growing enrollment to seek housing in town. Moreover, a single-family home can be converted into several smaller rental units, or shared by a number of students whose combined resources exceed those of a typical single-family rental—a strong incentive for absentee landlords to cater to students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In the US, educational institutions are often exempted from local taxes, so in the absence of a system for "[[Payments In Lieu Of Taxes]]" (PILOT), the university population will disproportionately burden parts of the local public infrastructure, such as roads or law enforcement. Some analysts argue that students relieve the burden on other parts of the local public infrastructure, such as local primary and secondary schools, by far the most costly line item in most North American city and town budgets, by providing tax revenues through local sales tax and property tax paid by landlords. When a university expands its facilities, the potential loss of property tax revenue is thus a concern, in addition to local desire to preserve open space or historic neighborhoods.

As a result, local people may resent the university and its students.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} The students, in turn, may criticize the local residents' taking jobs at the university provided by student tuition and fees, and accepting the tax revenues (e.g. local sales tax, property tax on rented properties) that students generate, but resenting students' lifestyles. Some students refer to other inhabitants as "townies", a term with somewhat derogatory connotations.

This "town and gown" dichotomy notwithstanding, students and the outside community typically find a peaceful (even friendly) coexistence, with the town receiving significant economic and cultural benefits from the university, and the students often adapting to the culture of the town.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

==Settlement in college towns==
While noise, traffic, and other quality of life issues have not been resolved, some advocates of [[New Urbanism]] have led the development of neighborhoods in college towns by specifically capitalizing on their proximity to university life. For instance, some universities have developed properties to allow faculty and staff members to walk to work, reducing demand for limited on-campus parking; [[Duke University]]'s Trinity Heights development is a key example. In many cases, developers have built communities where access to the university (even if not directly adjacent) is promoted as an advantage.

Student housing is also an important component of college towns. In the United States most state universities have 50 percent or more of their enrolled students living off-campus. This trend, which began in the 1960s, originally meant the conversion of near campus single-family homes to student housing, creating "[[student ghetto]]s."

Colleges and other developers began building purpose-built off-campus student housing areas in the 1970s in more college towns.  Beginning around 2000 in the United States, nationwide real estate investment trusts (REIT) and publicly traded corporations began developing student housing complexes.

Another notable development since the 1990s is the surge in popularity of retirees relocating to college towns. Retirees are attracted to these locations because of cultural and educational opportunities, [[College athletics|college athletic]] events, good medical facilities (often at [[teaching hospital]]s affiliated with [[medical school]]s), a low [[cost of living]], and often a [[pedestrian]]- or [[public transit]]-friendly development pattern. Several development companies now specialize in constructing [[retirement community|retirement communities]] in college towns.  In some cases the communities have developed formal relationships with the local institution.

The demand for housing from students, faculty, staff, and retirees has kept college town home prices stable during the [[United States housing market correction|housing market downturn that began in 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Prashant |last=Gopal |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=College Towns: Still a Smart Investment|url=http://businessweek.com/lifestyle/content/mar2008/bw20080313_093883.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_lifestyle |work=BusinessWeek |publisher= |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=2008-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concept-Oriented Reading Instruction''' (CORI) was developed in 1993 by Dr. [[John T. Guthrie]] with a team of elementary teachers and graduate students. The project designed and implemented a framework of conceptually oriented reading instruction to improve students' amount and breadth of reading, intrinsic motivations for reading, and strategies of search and [[Reading comprehension|comprehension]]. The framework emphasized five phases of reading instruction in a content domain: observing and personalizing, searching and retrieving, comprehending and integrating, communicating to others, and interacting with peers to construct meaning. CORI instruction was contrasted to experience-based teaching and strategy instruction in terms of its support for motivational and cognitive development.&lt;ref name=ref1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref4 /&gt;

==History==
[[File:CORI Hands-on Experience.jpg|thumb]]
CORI’s aims are to support:

*'''''Reading Comprehension''''' via activating background knowledge, questioning, summarizing, searching, [[Graphic organizer|organizing graphically]], and interpreting stories
*'''''Science Inquiry''''' via observation, using knowledge, questioning, designing investigations, collecting data, drawing conclusions, and explaining results conceptually. The science theme was the survival concepts (ecology) of feeding, [[Animal locomotion|locomotion]], defense, predation, respiration, reproduction, [[competition]], communication, and adjustment to habitat. 
*'''''Motivation''''' via knowledge goals for reading, hands-on experiences, interesting books, choices about learning, and [[collaboration]] with classmates
*'''''Reading and Science Integration''''' via relating observations in hands-on science activities to contents and characters in literary and information books and connecting students' interests in the environment to their motivations for book reading
*'''''Student Writing''''' via writing entries in portfolios that demonstrated the following: information text reading, literary text reading, science concepts, science processes, and motivation for reading.&lt;ref name=ref8 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref9 /&gt;

“For nearly 20 years, Guthrie and colleagues have been refining CORI, a program designed to promote a number of literacy goals through the use of broad interdisciplinary themes, primarily drawn from science curricula, such as exploring the impact of humans on animal habitats. CORI provides explicit instruction in reading strategies, such a questioning, activating background knowledge, searching for information, summarizing, and synthesizing information in order to communicate with others. Instruction involves hands-on investigations, inquiry with text, strategy instruction, working in collaborative inquiry teams, and writing to publish and present findings. CORI has been shown to increase students’ science inquiry strategies, and overall text comprehension compared to control classrooms with separate science and literacy curricula and/or strategy instruction in reading alone. Of particular interest in the CORI research is the pivotal role that motivation, in all of its instantiations (interest, self-efficacy, and achievement motivation), plays in learning both science and literacy.” &lt;ref name=ref2 /&gt;

[[File:CORI Reading.jpg|thumb|left]]
CORI investigated the motivations, cognitive competencies, and instructional support needed to increase reading comprehension and engagement of middle school students in science concepts (ecology) and social studies ([[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]) through the '''Reading Engagement for Adolescent Learning (REAL) Project'''. Reading comprehension strategies included: activating background knowledge, questioning, summarizing, [[Inference|inferencing]], and concept mapping. Intrinsic motivations included involvement, challenge, curiosity, social interactions, and the teaching of concepts and inquiry skills. Books, educational videos, websites, and other supplemental materials were used to aid students’ learning and teachers’ instruction.&lt;ref name=ref11 /&gt;

The CORI program equipped participating teachers with the skills to accomplish these classroom goals through interactive professional development workshops. These workshops were given several times during the school year with these teacher-desired outcomes in the following areas:&lt;ref name=ref10 /&gt;

'''Classroom practices''': support for motivation; foster engagement with text; sustain reading engagement across the year; energize learning from information text; connect Common Core State Standards to motivation; use research-based approaches

'''Motivation and engagement practices''': setting up partnerships, collaborations, and teams; providing productive choices, large and small; building relevance into reading and writing; encouraging reading values; enabling students to develop their identities; increasing learning in [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core State Standards]]&lt;ref name=ref3 /&gt;

'''Integrating cognitive strategy instruction includes guidance to''': teach higher-order reading skills, improve students' information text comprehension, integrate reading in content domains, provide strategy instruction in subject matters, target digital literacies and traditional textbooks

The objective of CORI is to increase the amount of engaged reading through the use of explicit cognitive and motivational supports or scaffolds. Cognitively, the CORI program stresses the learning of conceptual ideas.

==Program Specifics==
[[File:CORI Middle School Reading.jpg|thumb]]
CORI instruction can take place within the domain of any subject matter at any grade level. Lessons are developed for the express purpose of increasing student engagement.  In turn, students’ amount of reading increases, and ultimately, their use of reading strategies, intrinsic motivation, and achievement increase. Texts on a topic are made available to the students, and along with strategy instruction and motivational support, deep understanding of a concept develops.This shows CORI’s emphasis on thematic learning.&lt;ref name=ref7 /&gt;

In keeping with a guided reading model of instruction, lessons were provided for small groups at the struggling reader, on-grade level, and advanced reader levels. Writing and independent reading are part of the CORI program, as is a culminating activity for a unit of study.&lt;ref name=ref5 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ref6 /&gt;

Teacher training modules, classroom videos, related research articles and books, and research findings in elementary and middle schools on the CORI website www.corilearning.com provide necessary information to become further informed about this program.

'''Democrasoft, Inc.''', formerly '''Burst.com''', is a [[public company|public]] software company located in [[Santa Rosa, California|Santa Rosa]], [[California]].

==History==
In 2010, the company launced Collaborize, an online communications tool, at the Spring DEMO Conference. That same year, the company changed its name to Democrasoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1592565/burstcom-becomes-democrasoft-launching-collaborizetm-demospring-2010| publisher=Fast Company| title=Burst.com Becomes Democrasoft, Launching Collaborize(TM) at DemoSpring 2010| author=Francine Hardaway| date=March 22, 2010| access-date=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later released Collaborize Classroom, an online learning platform that included the Collaborize Classroom Topic Library which featured subject based lessons for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://thejournal.com/articles/2012/04/17/democrasoft-releases-collaborize-classroom-ipad-app.aspx?=THE21| publisher=The Journal| title=Democrasoft Releases Collaborize Classroom iPad App| author=Tim Sohn| date=April 17, 2012| access-date=November 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, Democrasoft released the WeJit, a tool for on-line collaboration.

==Patent litigation history==
In March 2005 the company, then named Burst.com, received $60 million as settlement in its suit against [[Microsoft]] over unauthorized use of its streaming media technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_17/b3981070.htm Underdog Or Patent Troll?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060421131648/http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_17/b3981070.htm |date=April 21, 2006 }}, [[BusinessWeek]], April 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dir.salon.com/story/tech/feature/2002/10/29/microsoft_media_one/index.html Microsoft's media monopoly], Salon.com, Oct. 2, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, Apple Computer filed an action for a Declaratory Judgement seeking to have Burst's patents declared invalid. In April 2006, Burst.com counterclaimed against [[Apple Computer]] with regard to Apple's potential infringement of Burst.com's patents on streaming video and time-shifting of video. A "[[Markman Hearing|Markman]]" Claim Construction Memorandum and Order favorable to Burst was issued May 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.burst.com/new/newsevents/Apple_Burst_markman_ruling.pdf Claim Construction Ruling]&lt;/ref&gt; In early November, the court invalidated 14 of Burst's claims, leaving 22 remaining.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1194602656144 Apple Pops Some of Burst's Patent Claims], The Recorder (via law.com), Nov. 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On November 21, 2007, [[Apple Computer]] announced that it had called a truce in the legal feud between itself and Burst.com by agreeing to pay a $10 million lump sum in exchange for protection from current and future lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/07/11/21/apple_settles_burst_com_patent_suit_for_10_million.html Apple settles Burst.com patent suit for $10 million], AppleInsider, Nov. 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[RealNetworks]] sued Burst.com on January 3, 2008. The case was settled in May 2008 with RealNetworks agreeing to pay Burst a one-time payment of $533,500.00 cash in exchange for a license to a subset of the Burst patents.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS294502+08-May-2008+MW20080508 Burst.com and RealNetworks Reach Settlement Agreement], Burst.com PR, May 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3861">The  phrase '''digital world''' is most commonly used in [[digital pedagogy]] when defining the need for [[digital citizenship]], [[digital fluency]], and [[digital literacy]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://debikeytehartland.me/2014/12/05/pedagogy-of-the-digital-world/|title=Pedagogy of the Digital World|date=2014-12-05|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The digital world is the availability and use of digital tools to communicate on the [[Internet]], [[digital devices]], [[smart devices]] and other technologies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://donnakeenan.wordpress.com/2015/03/24/the-digital-world-what-does-it-mean/|title=The ‘digital world’. What does it mean?|date=2015-03-24|work=Teaching in a digital world|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

== Academic Usage ==

Humanities and education discussions of the 'digital world' tend to create variations when categorizing and defining the mass of mediated technologies and human interactions that are suggested as part of the digital world &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guerlac|first=Suzanne|date=|title=Humanities 2.0: E-Learning in the Digital World|url=|journal=Representations|volume=116|pages=106-128|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The phrase 'digital world'  is used loosely as a mass noun with many possible meanings and variations.

== Examples ==

* An informal example is devices given to toddlers entering the digital world&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=Do we need to rescue our kids from the digital world?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27501984|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
* Formal usage includes educational policies referring to the digital world&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|title=Sweden tries to make digital lightning strike twice|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/sweden-education-system-digital-revamp-coding-stockholm-school/|accessdate=9 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, especially in standardizing digital access&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Means|first=Barbara|last2=Anderson|first2=Kea|date=3 May 2018|title=Expanding Evidence Approaches for Learning in a Digital World.|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED566873.pdf|journal=Office of Educational Technology, US Department of Education|publisher=ERIC|publication-date=Feb 2013|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Children suffering a lack of access to the digital world are part of the [[digital divide]]. The [[One_Laptop_per_Child| One Laptop per Child]] program is an example of (digital world) inclusion for children living in poverty and suffering as part of the [[digital divide]].

== History ==

The phrase digital world was being used in electrical engineering studies before the creation of the [[World Wide Web]]  &lt;ref&gt;[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5006769/ Solomon, J. (1976, February). Analog circuits in an increasingly digital world. In Solid-State Circuits Conference. Digest of Technical Papers.]&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally it was used to describe the prevalence of digital electronic devices as opposed to analogue electronic devices. Articles relating to education in the digital world became more common in the 1990s.

==Structure==
A drill tower is a multi-level structure simulating high-rise buildings. Heights vary by location. Usually, its height is higher than [[fire engine]] [[ladder]]s can reach.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Levels are accessible from a [[stairway]] inside the tower, similar to buildings in [[urban area]]s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Drill towers usually contain [[window]]s for practising [[fire fighting]] and other [[rescue]] exercises.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

==Use==
Towers can help firefighters deal with real-life situations, including running upstairs with heavy equipment, using [[rope]] and [[safety net]]s, and operating a fire engine in a confined space.

'''Education in Chile''' is divided in [[preschool]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]], and [[technical education|technical]] or [[higher education]] ([[university]]).The levels of education in Chile are:

*Pre-school: For children up to 5&amp;nbsp;years old.
*Primary school: (''Enseñanza básica'') for children aged 6–13&amp;nbsp;years old, divided into 8 grades.
*Secondary school: (''Enseñanza media'') for teenagers aged 14–17&amp;nbsp;years old, divided into 4 grades. Schools are divided by curriculum into:
*#"Scientific-humanities". Geared to prepare students to enter university. From 11th grade (''Computador''), students can choose a subject in either science ([[math]], [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]]), or humanities ([[literature]], [[history]], [[philosophy]]), for more advanced lessons.
*#"Technical-professional". Designed to allow students to quickly enter the workforce after secondary education. Students are taught practical lessons in [[technical education|technical]] areas, such as electricity, mechanics, metal assembly, etc.
*Higher education:
**University (''universidad''): These are divided between "traditional" universities (public and private universities created (mostly) before the 1981 reform) and private institutions.
**Professional Institute (''Instituto Profesional'', ''IP''): Private institutions offering professional degrees, except for those given exclusively by universities. They were created in 1981.
**Technical Schooling Center (''Centro de Formación Técnica'', ''CFT''): Also created in 1981, they are private institutions offering technical degrees only.

==Pre-school==

Levels:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.junji.cl/Junji/Paginas/Preguntas-Frecuentes.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021085151/http://www.junji.cl/Junji/Paginas/Preguntas-Frecuentes.aspx|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-10-21|title=Preguntas Frecuentes|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Sala Cuna Menor'': children between 85 days of age to one year of age
*''Sala Cuna Mayor'': children between one and two years of age
*''Nivel Medio Menor'': children between two and three years of age
*''Nivel Medio Mayor'': children between three and four years of age
*''Primer Nivel Transición'' or ''Pre-Kinder'': children between four and five years of age
*''Segundo Nivel de Transición'' or ''Kinder'': children between five and six years of age

The law establishes free access to the last two levels of pre-school.&lt;ref name="leychile.cl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1014974|title=DFL-2 02-JUL-2010 MINISTERIO DE EDUCACIÓN - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A constitutional reform in 2013 called for the law to extend free access to four levels, and make the last one mandatory and a prerequisite to enter primary school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=1057032&amp;idParte=9391033&amp;idVersion=2013-12-11|title=LEY-20710 11-DIC-2013 MINISTERIO DE EDUCACIÓN - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The coverage for pre-school in 2009 was 37.42% (for children aged 0 to 5) and 44.96% (for persons of any age).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redatam.org/redchl/mds/casen/|title=R+SP WebServer:: Consulta Interactiva de datos Casen - Observatorio  Social - Ministerio de Desarrollo Social - Gobierno de Chile|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary and secondary education ==

The law makes primary and secondary school mandatory for all [[Chile]]ans.&lt;ref name="leychile.cl"/&gt;

The Chilean state provides an extensive system of [[education vouchers]] that covers about 93% of primary and secondary students (the other 7% attend non-subsidized private schools). The system is based on a direct payment to the schools based on daily attendance.

Schools are either public (nearly all owned by the municipality of the [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in which the school is located) or private, which may receive government subsidies.

Private schools (subsidized or not) may be organized as either for or non-profit. In order to receive public funding, private schools must reserve 15% of seats in each class to students classified as "vulnerable" (based on family income and mother's level of education). Schools receive extra funding for each "vulnerable" student they enroll.&lt;ref name="costs" /&gt;

===Primary===

The 1965 reform established primary education as the initial cycle of schooling. Before that, by 1920, Chilean legislation had established four&amp;nbsp;years of minimum mandatory education. By 1929 the minimum had been increased to six&amp;nbsp;years. In 1965 primary education was extended to eight grades, ideally designed for ages six to 13.

===Secondary===

Secondary education is divided between Scientific-Humanist (regular), Technical-Professional (vocational) and Artistic, all lasting four&amp;nbsp;years. The first two years are the same for the three kinds of schooling, while the third and fourth years are differentiated according to the orientation of the school.

The schools offering Technical-Professional programs are denominated:

* Industrial Schools: electricity, mechanics, electronics, informatics, among others.
* Commercial Schools: management, accountancy, secretary and similar.
* Technical Schools: fashion, culinary, nursery and the like.
* Polyvalent Schools: offering careers of more than one of those listed above.

Most of the students choosing the vocational branch come from disadvantaged socioeconomic background. Private school with subscribing-fees gathers less than 1% of the students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unevoc.unesco.org/worldtvetdatabase1.php?ct=CHL|title=UNESCO-UNEVOC World TVET Database|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compulsory education only covered the eight&amp;nbsp;years of primary school, but in 2003 a constitutional reform established in principle free and compulsory secondary education for all Chileans up to 21&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=19876|title=LEY-19876 22-MAY-2003 MINISTERIO DE EDUCACIÓN - Ley Chile - Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ensured twelve years of compulsory schooling, which was an unprecedented milestone in [[Latin America]] at the time.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Coverage===

The net enrollment ratio (covering students of school age) in 2009 was 93.19% in primary, and 70.70% in secondary, while the gross enrollment ratio (covering students of any age) was 106.24% in primary and 94.68% in secondary.

;Voluntary tuition: Public schools and subsidized private schools may charge a fee for the selection process, an annual price of enrollment (which, as of 2011, cannot be higher than CLP$3,500, or about US$7) and a monthly tuition fee (''financiamiento compartido'' or "shared funding", also known as ''copago'' or "copayment"), which is voluntary for the parent. Enrollment and tuition fees are forbidden in pre-primary and primary school in these institutions. A fee to the so-called Parents Center (''Centro de Padres'') is voluntary and cannot be higher than 0.5 UTM (''Unidad Tributaria Mensual'' or "Monthly Tax Unit") a year (payable in up to ten installments), which was CLP$19,143 (about US$40) in 2011.

;Mandatory tuition: Public schools and subsidized private schools have the same selection and annual enrollment costs as in schools with voluntary tuition, but they are allowed to charge a mandatory monthly tuition, which cannot be higher than 4 USE (''Unidad de Subvención Educacional'' or "Education Subsidy Unit"). This was equal to CLP$72,763 in 2011 (about US$150) in both primary and secondary school. A Parents Center fee is the same as in schools with voluntary tuition.

:Non-subsidized private schools are free to set the price, which may include enrollment and tuition costs, as well as a fee for applying to the school (paid once) and one for being admitted to the school (also paid once, and can be quite high in some exclusive schools). There may be other payments, such as to the Parents Center or for school materials, which may be included as part of the tuition fee.

There is a third type of public school, the so-called Delegated Administration schools, which are owned by the State but managed and financed by private corporations. These cannot charge a selection fee. The annual enrollment cost is voluntary and the same as in schools with voluntary tuition. They are allowed to charge for tuition, but it is up to the parent to decide how much to pay. The maximum cost is 1.5 UTM annually, which was CLP$57,430 (about US$119) in 2011. A Parents Center fee is voluntary.

There is a fourth type of public school, administered by the Ministry of Education and completely financed by the State. Currently, there is only one such school: ''Escuela [[Villa Las Estrellas]]'' in [[Antártica]].&lt;ref name="costs"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ayudamineduc.cl/Temas/Detalle/07cacab4-052d-e211-8986-00505694af53 |title=Consultas - Cobros Permitidos |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education of Chile]] |date= |accessdate=2014-10-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028044955/https://www.ayudamineduc.cl/Temas/Detalle/07cacab4-052d-e211-8986-00505694af53 |archive-date=28 October 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chileclic.gob.cl/1542/article-46922.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224230123/http://www.chileclic.gob.cl/1542/article-46922.html |date=December 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher education ==

===Admission===

====University====
Students can choose between 16 public universities and 43 private [http://www.mifuturo.cl/index.php/donde-y-que-estudiar/universidades]. Used to be 60 Universities, but Universidad del Mar went into bankruptcy and will be no longer providing education.[http://www.mifuturo.cl/index.php/donde-y-que-estudiar/universidades]

All public universities and 23 private [http://www.psu.demre.cl/proceso-admision/universidades-participantes/universidades-consejo-de-rectores ones] use a single admission system called PSU (''Prueba de Selección Universitaria'', "University Selection Test"), designed and evaluated by the [[University of Chile]], and consisting of two mandatory exams, one in Mathematics and one in Language. There are also two additional specific exams, Sciences (including Chemistry, Physics and Biology fields) and History, which may be required by some undergraduate programs. The cumulative grade point average achieved during secondary school is also taken into account in the final admission score, as well as the student's relative position in his class and two previous promotions. Every university assigns different weightings to the results of the various exams for the various programs offered. Some universities may require additional (non-PSU) tests or personal interviews for admission to some programs.

There is a gap on the PSU test scores regarding secondary education among public schools and private schools. This is almost 130 points difference in favor to private schools.[http://www.emol.com/noticias/Nacional/2015/12/27/765666/Balance-PSU-Colegios-pagados-logran-hasta-138-puntos-mas-que-los-municipales.html]

In 2014, a total of 247,291 people took both mandatory PSU tests (nearly 71 thousand were from previous promotions).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.psu.demre.cl/estadisticas/documentos/p2015/2015-compendio-estadistico.pdf | title=Compendio estadístico proceso de admisión año académico 2015 | language=es | publisher=Universidad de Chile/DEMRE | accessdate=28 April 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drop out rate is 30% from first year students.[http://www.latercera.com/noticia/30-los-alumnos-educacion-superior-deserta-carrera-primer-ano/] The main factors are economic problems, vocational and psychological aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/30-los-alumnos-educacion-superior-deserta-carrera-primer-ano/|title=El 30% de los alumnos de educación superior deserta de su carrera el primer año|last=Figueroa|first=Raúl|date=2 November 2016|work=La tercera|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====IPs and CFTs====

Professional Institutes (PI) and Technical Schooling Centers (CFT) require a secondary education license only for admission.

===Coverage===

The net enrollment ratio (covering students between 18 and 24 years) in 2009 was 28.88%, while the gross enrollment ratio (covering students of any age) was 38.73%.

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;All are privately owned.&lt;/small&gt;

===Costs===
Since 1999 till 2012 the budgets for public education have increased from 3,8% of the GDP till 4.5% of the GDP in public spending.[http://datos.bancomundial.org/indicador/SE.XPD.TOTL.GD.ZS] Evidence shows that Chile is spending almost 40% more of its GDP in higher education compare to the average OECD countries, from 2.4% of the GDP in Chile compare to the 1.7% of the GDP in the average OECD [http://www.oecd.org/edu/Chile-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf]  
:''Note: This section is outdated. Starting in 2016, 30 public and private universities are now free of charge for students belonging to the poorest 50% of the population.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.chileatiende.gob.cl/fichas/ver/43203|title=Chileatiende - Gratuidad en la educación superior 2018|first=|last=ChileAtiende|date=|website=www.chileatiende.gob.cl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All universities, institutes and technical schools in Chile charge enrollment and tuition costs.&lt;ref name="economist"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21552566 |title=Chile: Progress and its discontents |publisher=The Economist |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, several government scholarship programs granted to students based on merit or need. Socioeconomically disadvantaged students from any type of officially recognized educational institution may seek loans through private banks with the State acting as guarantee ("Crédito con Aval del Estado", CAE). There are also loan programs offered by the government exclusively to socioeconomically disadvantaged students of "traditional" universities ("Fondo Solidario de Crédito Universitario", FSCU). These loans —private and public— have a fixed interest rate of 2% and must be paid back by the student after graduation. For CAE loans, the payment is equal to 10% of the former student's annual wage, and 5% for FSCU loans. The debt is written off after 15 years for CAE loans, and 12 for FSCU loans.&lt;ref name="economist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rebajacuotacae.ingresa.cl/preguntas-frecuentes-rebaja-tasa-de-interes-al-2/|title=Preguntas Frecuentes – Rebaja Tasa de Interés al 2% - Rebaja Cuota CAE|publisher=|access-date=21 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120013803/http://rebajacuotacae.ingresa.cl/preguntas-frecuentes-rebaja-tasa-de-interes-al-2/|archive-date=20 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mineduc.cl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineduc.cl/usuarios/becasycreditos/doc/201211261031410.Tabla_Becas.pdf|title=Ministerio de Educación|author=|date=|website=Ministerio de educación}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholarships and loan programs offered by the government only cover a "reference" annual tuition cost calculated by the government for each program.

There are also government-funded programs giving students: a monthly stipend, a debit card to buy food, and a student card to pay for cheaper transportation. All programs (except transportation) are based on merit, need, indigenous background or geographical residence.&lt;ref name="mineduc.cl"/&gt;

In 2012 947,063 students were enrolled in tertiary education programs. Of these, 548,119 (58%) received either scholarships or loans by the government. Of the totality of programs awarded during 2012 (623,086; students may benefit from more than one program), scholarships represented 35% and loans 65% (14% FSCU and 51% CAE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineduc.cl/usuarios/becasycreditos/doc/201301220959380.asignacion_byc2013_regional.pdf|title=Ministerio de Educación|author=|date=|website=Ministerio de educación}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School year==

The [[Academic term|school year]] is divided into [[semester]]s. The first semester runs from late February or early March to early July. Following a two-week [[School holiday|winter break]] school resumes and lasts until late November or early December, followed by [[summer vacation]]s.

The dates are set by the Ministry of Education in each [[Regions of Chile|Region]]. For example, in 2014 the start of classes is March 5 for regular students in the [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]]; a winter break runs from 14 to 25 July, with the second semester starting at 28 July; classes end at either 5, 12 or 19 December, depending on the program's length in weeks (38 to 40); students graduating from high school (fourth level of secondary education) end classes on 14 November, giving them time to prepare for the university admission test (PSU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mineduc.cl/usuarios/metropolitana/doc/201312131019280.REX455913.122013FIJACALENDARIOESCOLAR.pdf|language=Spanish|date=2013-12-13|title=Resolución Exenta Nº 04559, Fija calendario escolar 2014 para la Región Metropolitana de Santiago|work=Santiago Metropolitan Region Ministry of Education Regional Secretariat|access-date=2016-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education reform==

Chile {{as of|2014|lc=y}} is undergoing a significant reform to its publicly funded education system. One of the first proposals sent to Congress include the banning of mandatory co-payments, the removal of existing selection processes and the conversion of for-profit schools into non-profit organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://santiagotimes.cl/bachelet-sends-first-education-bill-congress-students-plan-protest/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=1 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101211634/http://santiagotimes.cl/bachelet-sends-first-education-bill-congress-students-plan-protest/ |archive-date=1 November 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another proposal (announced, but yet to be sent to Congress) is to provide free tertiary education to students in the poorest 60% of the population; this would apply to students of "traditional" universities and of "accredited" and non-profit technical schooling centers and professional institutes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.afp.com/en/news/chile-students-police-clash-new-protest-over-reforms{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evangelism Explosion''' (EE) is a Christian [[evangelistic]] program. It has been called "perhaps the best known and most widely used evangelistic training curriculum in church history."&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt;

==History==
Evangelism Explosion was started  in 1962 by [[D. James Kennedy]], senior pastor of [[Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church]].&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://evangelismexplosion.org/about-us/history/|publisher=Evangelism Explosion|accessdate=12 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evangelism Explosion became an incorporated organization in 1972.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; 

In 1997, Evangelism Explosion published the results of a study which shows that the method was viewed as "confrontational evangelism". As a result of this, Evangelism Explosion announced that it was "changing its approach to emphasize relationship-building and discipling new believers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lawton|first=Kim A.|title=Outreach: Evangelism Explosion Retools its Approach|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/1997/march3/7t3058.html|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=[[Christianity Today]]|date=3 March 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evangelism Explosion has now been published in a number of different forms, including Kids' EE, Seniors' EE, Deaf EE, and XEE. The latter is designed especially for members of Generations [[Generation X|X]] and [[Generation Y|Y]].

==Content==
Evangelism Explosion is best known for its two "diagnostic questions" that users can ask non-Christians as a means of determining a "person's spiritual health",&lt;ref name=Peel&gt;{{cite book|last=Peel|first=William Carr|title=Going Public With Your Faith: Becoming a Person of Spiritual Influence at Work|year=2003|publisher=[[Zondervan]]|page=153|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fx_A9ujxFU4C&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of stimulating an evangelistic conversation:
#Have you come to the place in your spiritual life where you can say you know for certain that if you were to die today you would go to heaven?
#Suppose that you were to die today and stand before God and he were to say to you, "Why should I let you into my heaven?" what would you say?
After the diagnostic questions, the evangelist is encouraged to explain the [[Good News (Christianity)|gospel]] in terms of [[Grace (Christianity)|grace]], [[Christian anthropology|man]], [[God in Christianity|God]], [[Christ]], and [[Faith in Christianity|faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pockock|first=Michael|last2=Van Rheenen|first2=Gailyn|last3=McConnell|first3=Douglas|title=The Changing Face of World Missions: Engaging Contemporary Issues and Trends|year=2005|publisher=[[Baker Academic]]|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hSlUS36w6dcC&amp;pg=PA180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
Evangelism Explosion's materials have been translated into seventy languages.&lt;ref name=History /&gt; Jeff Noblit suggests that it is "probably the most used and copied soul-winning training course ever embraced by [[Southern Baptists]],"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Noblit|first=Jeff|title=Calvinism: A Southern Baptist Dialogue|chapter=The Rise of Calvinism in the Southern Baptist Convention: Reason for Rejoicing|year=2008|publisher=[[B&amp;H Publishing Group]]|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zVgsogYlGjsC&amp;pg=PA104}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Stan Guthrie suggests that it is "the best known and most widely used evangelistic training curriculum in church history."&lt;ref name=Guthrie&gt;{{cite web|last=Guthrie|first=Stan|title=A Passion for Souls: Remembering D. James Kennedy|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2007/septemberweb-only/136-43.0.html|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by over 20,000 [[Local church|churches]] worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=James D.|title=Evangelism Explosion marks 50 years|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2012-02-22/features/sfl-fv-religion-blog-evangelism-explosion_1_sorensen-ee-evangelism-explosion|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=[[Sun-Sentinel]]|date=22 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Evangelism Explosion officials claim that millions of people have [[Conversion to Christianity|come to Christ]] using the program.&lt;ref name=Guthrie /&gt; In 2011, 324,000 people worldwide were trained in the program, while over 7.25 million people reportedly made a profession of faith as a result of its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evangelism Explosion Celebrates 50 Years, Looks to Next 50|url=http://nrb.org/news_room/articles/evangelism-explosion-celebrates-50-years-looks-to-next-50/|publisher=[[National Religious Broadcasters]]|accessdate=13 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years later, the organization claimed 10.7 million people professed faith in Christ in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://evangelismexplosion.org/about-us/annual-results/|title=Annual Results - Evangelism Explosion|work=Evangelism Explosion|access-date=2018-02-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Evangelism Explosion materials have been remarkable as it has covered almost every continent and every island across the globe from the founding church in Florida to as far as the [http://www.evangelismexplosionfiji.com Fiji Islands].

==Evaluation==
David L. Larsen suggests that Evangelism Explosion has "brought a quickening of the evangelistic pulse", and has "provided a most helpful and practical vehicle for witness." Larsen notes, however, that "not everyone is comfortable" with "its more vigorous 'button-holing'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Larsen|first=David L.|title=The Evangelism Mandate: Recovering the Centrality of Gospel Preaching|year=2002|publisher=Kregel Academic|page=126|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=njaFqQPAp-cC&amp;pg=PA126}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a study done among non-Christian Thai people, all of them spoke negatively about the witnessing approach of EE. One respondent said, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I would be upset. It is ridiculous and strange. I do not know who will die first, the interrogator or me. I would simply walk away. I do not want anyone to talk about death. It is a depressive issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mejudhon|first=Ubolwan|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|chapter=The Thai Way of Meekness|year=2004|publisher=[[William Carey Library]]|pages=282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OzEOKNPsv2EC&amp;pg=PA282}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48320">&lt;!-- Please do not replace "government-operated" with "government-funded", or make other changes with respect to legal items without discussing them, unless you know the French system well. --&gt;The '''French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools''' bans wearing conspicuous [[religious symbolism|religious symbols]] in French [[education in France|public]] (e.g., government-operated) [[primary school|primary]] and [[Secondary education in France|secondary schools]]. The law is an amendment to the French Code of Education that expands principles founded in existing French law, especially the constitutional requirement of [[laïcité]]: the separation of state and religious activities.

&lt;!--NOT publicly funded; most private schools are publicly funded, and are not affected by this law--&gt;
The [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] passed France's national legislature and was signed into law by President [[Jacques Chirac]] on 15 March 2004 (thus the technical name is '''law 2004-228 of 15 March 2004''') and came into effect on 2 September 2004. The full title of the law is "{{cite French law|number or usual name=n&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; 2004-228|date in French=15 mars 2004|full name=encadrant, en application du principe de laïcité, le port de signes ou de tenues manifestant une appartenance religieuse dans les écoles, collèges et lycées publics|lower case=yes}}" (literally "Law #2004-228 of March 15, 2004, concerning, as an application of the principle of the separation of church and state, the wearing of symbols or garb which show religious affiliation in public primary and secondary schools").

The law does not mention any particular religious symbol, and thus bans [[Christianity|Christian]] (veil, signs), [[Islam|Muslim]] (veil, signs), [[Sikhism|Sikh]] (turban, signs), [[Judaism|Jewish]] and other religious signs.&lt;ref name="georgetown1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |title=France |work= |publisher=[[Berkley Center for Religion, Peace, and World Affairs]] |date= |accessdate=2011-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206213909/http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/resources/countries/france |archivedate=2011-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is, however, considered by many to specifically target the wearing of headscarves (a [[sartorial hijab|khimar]], considered by many Muslims to be an obligatory article of faith as part of [[hijab]] ["modesty"]) by Muslim schoolgirls. For this reason, it is occasionally referred to as the '''French headscarf ban''' in the foreign press. In addition, the law is seen by some as disproportionately affecting Muslims, arguing that Christians rarely wear over sized crosses, and Sikhs have successfully lobbied to be able to wear a simple under-turban, whereas  Jews have greater opportunities to enroll kids in private Jewish religious schools owing to their long presence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fredette |first1=Jennifer |title=Examining the French Hijab and Burqa Bans through Reflexive Cultural Judgment |journal=New Political Science |date=26 February 2015 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=48–70 |doi=10.1080/07393148.2014.995396}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:French law on secularity and conspicuous religious symbols in schools.png|thumb|The Law as published in the ''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française]]'']]

==Background==

===Islamic view of headscarves===
In Islam, [[Hijab]] is a duty prescribed on all Muslims,&lt;ref name=bbc_hijab&gt;{{cite web|title=Hijab|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/beliefs/hijab_1.shtml|work=BBC|accessdate=28 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in the matter discussed in this article it only applies to women. Hijab is often equated with the idea of modesty in all senses including personal, physical and social. While it prescribes restrictions and practices for both men (such as, for example, restraining one's thoughts from objectification of women and covering the aspects of oneself that attract others to them, incorporating the chest and between the navel and knee for many Muslims) and women, it is most known for its religious prescription for a woman to dress modestly and cover her hair.

While for some Muslims the concept of hijab is seen as balanced and consistent with ideas of [[gender equality]]{{cn|date=May 2018}}, others see the religious prescription on female covering as chauvinistic, patriarchal, oppressive and an enforcement on women and against their rights. Most Muslims living in Western societies concede outright that the forcing of women to wear the headscarf is against Islamic precepts and cannot be accepted, but social pressure can in some cases be strong.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

A number of [[Islamic feminism#Twentieth century|Islamic feminists]] see the wearing of the headscarf, and particularly of the full-face veil such as the [[niqāb]], as oppressive of women. French activist and politician [[Fadela Amara]] has thus stated: "The veil is the visible symbol of the subjugation of women, and therefore has no place in the mixed, [[Laïcité|secular spaces]] of [[education in France|France's public school system]]."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jul/17/france.politicsphilosophyandsociety | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Ghetto warrior | date=July 17, 2006 | accessdate=May 5, 2010 | first=Rose | last=George}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===French education system===
{{Further|Education in France}}
[[Image:Lycee Rennes DSC08932.JPG|thumb|A government-operated high school in central [[Rennes]]]]
Education is compulsory in France up to the age of 16.  The French system of primary and secondary education consists of:
# government-operated schools (''enseignement public'');
# private schools receiving government subsidies (''enseignement privé sous contrat''), the vast majority of private schools; and
# private schools not receiving government subsidies (''enseignement privé hors contrat'').
Schools in the first two categories are required to apply the same national curricula as defined by the [[Minister of National Education (France)|Ministry of Education]]. The curriculum for schools in the third category is free, provided that students receive at least some minimal skills in [[writing]], [[mathematics]], etc. The law discussed in this article only applies to government-operated schools, in the first category.

The French government highly subsidises private elementary and secondary schools, even those affiliated with religious organizations, as long as they apply the same curriculum as the public schools, with the same academic standards, and that they do not discriminate on grounds of religious affiliation nor make religious education compulsory. It is for instance common that children of [[agnosticism|agnostic]] or otherwise [[non-religious]] families, or children of families from other religions, are put in [[Catholic school]]s, if their parents judge these schools to offer better conditions of education or to be more convenient. Consequently, families can use private schools at moderate costs. While there are no accessible official national statistics on the costs of private schools, typical prices per year for low-income families are in the range of a few hundred [[euro]]s. The average costs are €500 a year per student;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.associations.societegenerale.fr/php/trans/depeche_afp.php?id=050920165605.f9m7fm1w.xml |title=Societe Generale – Espace Associations |publisher=Associations.societegenerale.fr |date=2005-09-20 |accessdate=2009-01-31 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108141554/http://www.associations.societegenerale.fr/php/trans/depeche_afp.php?id=050920165605.f9m7fm1w.xml |archivedate=January 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  however, this statistic includes very expensive, exclusive schools. In addition, according to the figures from the secretariat, more than half of schools have established a price schedule taking into account a family's income; as a result, costs to parents can be as little as €20 to €30 per school month per student.

In addition, the French government operates a distant learning agency, the [[Centre national d'enseignement à distance|CNED]], which is another solution for families impacted by the normal rules or schedules of public schools.

===History===
Since 1905, France has had a [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|law requiring separation of church and state]], prohibiting the state from recognizing or funding any religion. Schools directly operated by the national or local governments must not endorse or promote any religious dogma (whether endorsing an existing religion or endorsing [[atheism]] or any other philosophy). Schools funded totally or in part by the national and local governments by law must not force students into religious education; they should remain equally accessible to children of any, or no, faith. For example, even though a majority of the population nominally professes [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]] (although far fewer regularly practice Catholicism),&lt;ref&gt;[http://a1692.g.akamai.net/f/1692/2042/1h/medias.lemonde.fr/medias/pdf_obj/sondage030416.pdf ''Les Français et leurs croyances''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304094059/http://a1692.g.akamai.net/f/1692/2042/1h/medias.lemonde.fr/medias/pdf_obj/sondage030416.pdf |date=March 4, 2007 }}, 2003 CSA poll&lt;/ref&gt; government-operated French schools have no communal [[school prayer|prayers]], religious assemblies, or [[Christian cross]]es on the walls. The [[Constitution of France]] says that France is a ''[[laïcité|laïque]]'' (roughly, secular) Republic.
&lt;!-- Note: there exist many private religious schools receiving government funding, thus "state-funded" and "government-operated" are not synonymous. Please do not make semantic changes to this paragraph unless you know French law. --&gt;

In France, historically, differences between religions (or later between religious and non-religious people) have often resulted in deep divisions of society, from the 16th-century [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] to the late 19th-century [[Dreyfus Affair]]. The relations between the Church of France and the state were disputed under Louis XIV (see [[Gallicanism]]); they were severely strained under the Revolution of 1789, when the constitutional government of the [[National Assembly]] promulgated the [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] and the Church divided into the constitutional clergy, who accepted it, and the ultramontanes who did not.    Roman Catholicism was recognised as the faith of the majority of French citizens, but Napoleon also named Judaism and the Lutheran and Reformed Churches as officially recognised by the state. Although these four 'official' religions received state funding and protection (until the 1905 law as above), they were not given the status of a religion of the state. France had begun to view faith as a matter for each individual citizen rather than for a nation as a whole.

As a result of this history, religious manifestations are considered undesirable in government-operated schools; primary and secondary schools are supposed to be neutral spaces where children can learn away from political or religious pressures, controversies and quarrels. Because of this neutrality requirement, students are normally prohibited from conducting religious [[proselytism|proselytising]] or political [[activism]] on the premises.
[[File:Gerechtszaal Rouen.jpg|thumb|A cross in a French law court before 1905]]
Civil servants are expected to stay neutral with respect to politics or religion when they discharge their duties. More generally, they are expected to keep a certain reserve and not make comments or demonstrations that may be interpreted as political, religious, or other bias in the course of their duties or as an endorsement of particular religious or partisan political views by the government. Teaching personnel in government-operated schools must not, by law, endorse any political or religious point of view; they may also face sanctions for wearing overt religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the 2000 ruling of the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', ''[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnTexteDeJorf?numjo=CETX0004174V Mlle Marteaux]'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===
[[Image:DSC00652 conseil etat.jpg|thumb|Because the law was unclear, the ''Conseil d'État'' was called in for legal analyses, then for settling litigation.]]
For many years school administrators have accepted, or tolerated, that schoolchildren wear symbols of their various religions, such as a [[Christianity|Christian]] student wearing a cross, or a [[Judaism|Jewish]] student wearing a [[kippah]]. However, there was some leeway and uncertainty in those matters, and occasionally some students faced disciplinary action for overly ostentatious attire.

Many people find crosses and yarmulkes acceptable, but not headscarves, for a variety of reasons. Some feminists do not consider them as religious symbols, but as symbols of female alienation, or dangerous signs of mounting ''communautarisme'' (ethnicisation of social relationships, which the French do not view favorably), rising Islamist movements, or attacks on the Republic, are sometimes deemed 'foreign' and 'un-French'.{{Clarify|date=July 2009}} However, some people regard the wearing of headscarves as a feminist choice and do not view this as fundamentally different from other choices relating to clothing. The fact that most Muslims in France come from former French colonies has added a racist/antiracist tint to the debate. The issue has deeply divided France and debate has raged on ever since.

The issue of religion has wider implications than the mere wearing of headscarves, which contributed to the complexity of the debate. Occasionally, Muslim students have refused to attend certain classes when they or those influencing them deemed aspects of their faith to be contradicted (such as swimming classes or physical education); or insisted on attending them in Islamic garb, thus raising the question of whether this purported solution denatured the intended activity.

The wearing of the headscarf was also criticized as a means to enforce [[peer pressure]] on the girls not wearing it. One defense against this argument was that the ratio of Muslim girls to other girls was not always high in classrooms, and that scarf wearing did not necessarily reflect proselytizing intent; but a countervailing relevant issue was that the relevant group being pressured was Muslim girls not wearing the scarf, who could sometimes be endangered inside or outside school unless they submitted to wearing the scarf like their classmates.

Because of the absence of unambiguous law, action was taken on a case-by-case basis against students wearing ostensible religious garb, with differences of practice between establishments. School administrators, in such cases, were taken into legal, social and media quarrels far beyond their ordinary responsibilities. This was highlighted by the 1989 ''Affaire du Foulard'' ("the headscarf affair"), when three young girls were expelled from their school in [[Creil]], near [[Paris]], for refusing to take off their headscarves. This caused such an uproar that administrators realized something had to be done soon to regain control.

Because of these difficulties, public powers sought a more consistent approach. In 1989, the Minister of Education requested the legal analysis of the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'' on the issue of whether or not school administrators could, or should, expel students for wearing religious symbols, within the current framework of applicable regulations, laws, constitutional rights and international conventions. The general assembly of the ''Conseil'' gave a detailed analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg03_01.shtml |title=Official website of the Conseil d'État |publisher=Conseil-etat.fr |date= |accessdate=2009-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224015035/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/ce/missio/index_mi_cg03_01.shtml |archivedate=2008-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; containing the following opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It results from the above that, in teaching establishments, the wearing by students of symbols by which they intend to manifest their religious affiliation is not by itself incompatible with the principle of laïcité, as it constitutes the free exercise of [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and of manifestation of religious creeds, but that this freedom should not allow students to sport signs of religious affiliation that, due to their nature, or the conditions in which they are worn individually or collectively, or due to their ostentatious and provocative character, would constitute an act of pressure, provocation, [[proselytism]] or [[propaganda]], or would harm the dignity or the freedom of the student or other members of the educative community, or would compromise their health or safety, or would perturb the educational activities or the education role of the teaching personnel, or would trouble public order in the establishment or the normal functioning of the public service.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 2 November 1992, the ''Conseil'' ruled that a school regulation prohibiting all philosophical or religious signs, including those that were worn, was excessively sweeping and against the principle of ''[[laïcité]]''.

On 14 March 1994, the ''Conseil'' ruled that a school regulation prohibiting any [[headgear]] was excessive (the intent of this regulation was to prohibit the wearing of certain religious signs). The ''Conseil'' found that this regulation was excessively sweeping, without a clear need for it to be so.

On 10 March 1995, the ''Conseil'' upheld the expelling of three students from a highschool, on the basis that the three students gravely perturbed classes, infringing on school rules and the alleged prohibition of proselytism. One factor was the insistence of the students on wearing the scarf during sports classes, which was deemed inappropriate attire for such an activity. It also upheld some stipulations of the school regulations which restricted the wearing of signs of a religious, philosophical or political character, with the same legal analysis as the 1989 one cited above.

On 11 September 1995, three families appealed before the ''Conseil'' rulings of lower administrative courts, which had upheld decisions by high schools to exclude their daughters because they wore the veil; and the Minister of Education appealed rulings of lower courts that had declared illegal three exclusion decisions. The actual legal reasons differed slightly; however, in every case, on 27 November 1996, the ''Conseil'' ruled that the children had been inappropriately expelled, considering that the headscarf worn by the student, while it expressed the student's religious beliefs, did not have a protest or ostentatious character, nor did wearing it constitute in any case an act of pressure or proselytism.

The opinion and the decisions of the ''Conseil'', which established some kind of [[case law]], still left a considerable margin of appreciation to school administrators, which led to many tensions and embarrassments. It was thus argued that clear and consistent rules should be enacted.

===Stasi commission's report===
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Bernard Stasi 00017138.JPG|right|frame|Ombudsman Bernard Stasi]] --&gt;
In July 2003, [[President of France|French President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] set up an investigative committee (''[[commission Stasi]]'') to examine how the principle of ''[[laïcité]]'' should apply in practice. It consisted of 20 people headed by [[Bernard Stasi]], then [[ombudsman]] of France (''médiateur de la République''). While an obvious focus of the commission was wearing religious attire in public schools, the commission noted in its report that the issues went further.

The Stasi Commission published its report on 11 December 2003, considering that ostentatious displays of religion violated the secular rules of the French school system. The report recommended a law against pupils wearing "conspicuous" signs of belonging to a religion, meaning any visible symbol meant to be easily noticed by others. Prohibited items would include [[headscarf|headscarves]] for Muslim girls, [[yarmulkes]] for Jewish boys, and [[turban]]s for [[Sikhism|Sikh]] boys. The Commission recommended allowing the wearing of discreet symbols of faith such as small crosses, [[Star of David|Stars of David]] or [[Hand of Fatima|Fatima's hands]].

The Senate commission based its report on multiple sources: school representatives, headmasters, teachers; political associations, such as [[Ni Putes Ni Soumises]] or [[SOS Racisme]]; representatives of the main religions;&lt;ref&gt;Because Islam is not a hierarchical religion in the way that Roman Catholicism is (the only hierarchical structure being the currently-defunct [[Caliphate]]), it is not obvious which religious representatives should be engaged in discussion by public powers. In addition, contrary to other religious tendencies such as [[Protestant]]ism, Islam did not have an umbrella organisation in France. To remedy this last issue, in 2003 [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], then [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]], set up the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith]], which the State uses as a discussion partner for such issues. This elected council is equivalent in recognition to similar representative groups of other faiths.&lt;/ref&gt; or leaders of human-rights organizations.

[[File:Hijab-Indonesia_Anna_Martadiningrat.jpg|thumb|Most of the debate about the law centred on the use of the [[hijab]] (similar to the one worn by these [[Indonesia]]n women) by female Muslim students]]
The Commission's report emphasised that publicly funded schools in France should transmit knowledge, teach students critical awareness, assure autonomy and openness to cultural diversity, and encourage [[personal development]]. Schooling aims both to train students for a professional [[career]], and to make them into good citizens of the French Republic. The report states that such a mission presupposes fixed common rules, like [[gender equality]] and respect for [[secularism|secularity]].

Most of the debate has centered on [[hijab]] – the Islamic dress code, which may include a [[headscarf]] for women, but more generally, on the wearing of religious or political symbols  in schools. The wearing of headscarves in school started comparatively recently in mainland France (since the late 1980s), and has become the focus of the conflict. The increasing number of visible headscarves has been attributed by some to a rise in extremist activity in France, in particular in poor immigrant suburbs. However intellectuals such as Xavier Ternisien of Le Monde Diplomatique have maintained that the indubitable rise in religious observance is not linked with Islamic extremism, but with the frustration of children of immigrants no longer accepting to remain invisible as their parents often were. Further it is often associated with the idea of Muslim communities feeling settled and established in, and thus a part of, in French society such that they feel comfortable in expressing their identity.

The Commission identified the following positions with regard to wearing the Muslim headscarf:
* For those wearing it, the headscarf can have different meanings. The wearers may have exercised a free personal choice to wear the headscarf; or external pressure may have forced them to do so. Most French people find this idea of constraint or pressure particularly intolerable when it relates to young girls (some girls start wearing a headscarf before the age of 11).

The purpose of dressing according to hijab varies from person to person. Some women see the headscarf as a way to preserve their modesty and prevent any sexual attractions as in western countries. Some see it as a form of liberation above the sexualisation and consumerism of modern society. Others see it as a patriarchal article intended to keep women hidden and subservient.

The representatives of the main religions and leaders of human rights organisations have expressed several objections to a law banning the wearing of religious symbols. They believe it will lead to the stigmatisation of Muslims, exacerbate anti-religious sentiment, promote the image of a France that restricts personal freedom, and encourage Muslim girls to drop out of schools if they feel forced to choose between schooling and their faith.

The Commission said that the Republic must clarify this situation.

A section of the report which received less media attention recommended that the school system make [[Yom Kippur]] and ''[[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]'' (festival) into vacation days each year: currently, only some Christian holidays are vacation days (see [[Holidays in France]]); students who want to celebrate other festivities have to take some work day off with the authorisation of their parents. However, for critics and Muslims this did not balance out affairs: the banning of Muslim girls from freely choosing to wear an article of faith, seen by them as a religious obligation, could not be balanced with the permission to celebrate a religious festival, which is not obligatory at all.

The report also recommended enacting a ban on conspicuous symbols of political affiliation. The [[French National Assembly]] has not taken up these proposals.

The Commission also noted that occasionally pupils refuse to attend school because of the presence of teachers of the opposite sex, or refuse to attend certain classes (such as gymnastics or swimming lessons). The Commission suggested that only schools or state-recognised doctors (not simply parents) should have the right to grant exemptions.

==Law creation and interpretations==
In December 2003, [[President of France|President]] [[Jacques Chirac]] decided to act on the part of the Stasi report which recommended banning conspicuous religious symbols from schools.  This meant that the legislature could adopt the recommendations, according to the emergency procedure, in January or February, ready for application at the start of the next school year in September 2004.

On 10 February 2004 the [[French National Assembly|lower house]] voted by a large majority (494 for, 36 against, 31 abstentions) in support of the ban, which includes the caveat that the ban will be reviewed after it has operated for one year.

The initiators of the law are said to have particularly targeted two items of [[clothing]]: the headscarf and the veil (French: ''foulard'' and ''voile'' respectively); however the law mentions neither and just addresses "ostentatious" ("conspicuous") symbols. Because of its terse, broad, vague terms, the law will leave a lot of its interpretation to the administrative and judicial authorities.

The headscarf (sometimes referred to as the [[hijab]] in both French and English) covers the hair, ears, neck, and sometimes the shoulders, but not the face. Most Muslim girls who cover their heads in school wear such a headscarf.  More rarely, girls may also wear a complete dress covering their body (''djelbab''). The [[burqa|full or Afghan burka]], which covers the entire body except for a slit or grille to see through, occurs more commonly as the dress of an adult woman than that of a schoolgirl.  A recent controversy occurred when a mother who wore a full burka became a representative of parents in a city school. Rather than encourage public participation of such women, her participation in school deliberations while entirely covered was highly criticised. It was finally tolerated.

In order to enforce the law, effective decisions whether certain items are "ostentatious" or not will have to be taken. In order to achieve that:
* the Minister of Education will issue ''circulaires'', or instructions for its services; it seems that large crosses, full hijabs or yarmulkes would be banned, while small symbols such as small [[Star of David|Stars of David]] or crosses in [[Pendant|pendants]] would not be;
* headmasters will have to judge whether particular attire is or not acceptable with respect to the law;
* if necessary, families will go to administrative courts to challenge the school authorities' decision; a final decision may not be reached until the ''Conseil d'État'' at litigation (supreme administrative court), decides some points of [[jurisprudence]].
The law itself may not be challenged before French courts (since this would have warranted action before the [[Constitutional Council of France|Constitutional Council]] before the signing of the law); however, the courts may significantly curtail its application — especially given the inherent margin of appreciation of what is ostentatious or not.

The law will apply in France and its overseas territories (which France administers as a part of its metropolitan territory), but it is likely that appropriate enforcement measures will depend on the local context, given the margin of appreciation offered by the law. Overseas Countries and Territories with a large Muslim community will receive some exemptions. For example, it was suggested that [[Mayotte]] girls may wear small [[bandana]]s and light [[veil]]s (''kishall'').

==Public reaction==

===France===
The proposed ban was extremely controversial, with both sides of the political spectrum being split on the issue.

In 2004, French Cardinal [[Bernard Panafieu]], the [[Archbishop]] of [[Marseilles]] called the ban "unenforceable" While agreeing that some Muslim immigrants have had trouble adjusting to a "lay, pluralistic society" he asserted that the ban was wrong as it prevented Muslims from "asserting their identity" and that it would be "better to act through persuasion than by compulsion" if the state wanted to limit the use of religious symbols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/news/402/67.php |title=''Cardinal says French headscarf ban ‘unenforceable’'' |publisher=Cathnews.com |date=2004-02-12 |accessdate=2009-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522015601/http://www.cathnews.com/news/402/67.php |archivedate=May 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Population====
On February 14, 2004, the Associated Press reported that "Thousands of people, many of them women wearing headscarves, marched in France ... to protest a law banning the Islamic coverings and other religious apparel in public schools."

Polls suggest that a large majority of the French favour the ban. A January 2004 survey for [[Agence France-Presse]] showed 78% of teachers in favour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laic.info/Members/webmestre/Revue_de_presse.2004-02-04.2241/view Laic.Info] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040816102546/http://www.laic.info/Members/webmestre/Revue_de_presse.2004-02-04.2241/view |date=August 16, 2004 }} (in French)&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2004 survey by CSA for ''[[Le Parisien]]'' showed 69% of the population for the ban and 29% against. For Muslims in France, the February survey showed 42% for and 53% against. Among surveyed Muslim women, 49% approved the proposed law, and 43% opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?story_id=2404691 |title=The Economist |publisher=Economist.com |date=2004-02-05 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complex reasons may influence why an individual either supports or opposes this amendment.  They range from ensuring sex equality, preventing girls from being pressured into wearing the headscarf, boys into wearing turbans (for example), or a desire to see the Muslim community assimilated into French society on the one hand; to uphold freedoms of expression or conscience or religion, preventing the state from imposing restrictions on what a person can or cannot wear, preventing state victimisation of a minority group and opposing what may be seen as discrimination against Muslims or 'the other'.

====Political reactions====
{{Law unref section|date=October 2007}}
While all major political parties were somewhat divided on the issue, all major parties (the majority [[Union pour un Mouvement Populaire|UMP]] and [[Union pour la Démocratie Française|UDF]], the opposition [[French Socialist Party|PS]]) supported the law.

However, André Victor, member of [[Workers' Struggle]] wrote in his article ''Islamic Hijab and the Subjugation of Women'' [http://www.lutte-ouvriere-journal.org/?act=artl&amp;num=1812&amp;id=7 25 April 2003]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lutte-ouvriere-journal.org/2003/04/24/foulard-islamique-et-soumission-des-femmes_6495.html|title=Foulard islamique et soumission des femmes|website=Lutte Ouvrière : Le Journal|access-date=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "Sarkozy has spoken out against hijab on passport photos, and presumably earned the approval of millions of voters, which was probably the real purpose of this exercise in demagoguery[...] Therefore this policy leads to increase the weight of the most reactionary religious authorities within the immigrant population."

====Legal arguments====
Some critics have raised a legal point: they see the law as incompatible with the [[European convention on fundamental human rights]]. The Stasi Commission responded: ''The European Court in Strasbourg protects laïcité when it is a fundamental value of the State. It allows limits to the [[freedom of expression]] in public services, especially when it is a matter of protecting minors against external pressures.'' The Commission considers that the expression of an individual's religion in the French state has to comply with the basic rules regarding the secular nature of the state and has to comply with the requirements of equality between the sexes and the safeguarding of the rights of minors. Similar debates on the education of girls in headscarves have long raged in secular-yet-Muslim [[Turkey]]; the European Court of Human Rights upheld the laws of Turkey, which are more restrictive than the French law;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ledevoir.com/2004/06/30/58018.html |title=Le Devoir |publisher=Ledevoir.com |date=2004-06-30 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; it therefore seems highly unlikely it would declare the French law contrary to the Convention.

Another piece of legal criticism is that a full-fledged law was not needed to enforce a measure that basically amounts to a new set of school regulations. Any binding document of lesser value (such as a ''décret'' or an ''arrêté ministeriel'') would have had a similar effect. Since the writing of the [[Napoleonic Code]], a principle of French law has been that it must be, in the words of the great legislator [[Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis|Portalis]], "general and abstract."  Critics therefore argue that, by legislating on issues that could be solved with texts other than laws, the French legislature lowers the values of the law in general. Article 34 of the [[Constitution of France]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/textes/constit.htm#Titre+V|title=Conseil Constitutionnel|first=|last=NEXINT|date=10 November 2015|website=www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; vests power in Parliament to legislate on the "fundamental principles of teaching", leaving the application of these principles to the executive branch. By legislating on such minutiae, the argument goes, Parliament may have overstepped the "domain of the law" (''domaine de la loi'') that is set out by the Constitution only for the sake of pleasing the media and some interest groups.
However, a counter-argument is that the ''Conseil d'État'', [[#1980s and 1990s|ruling according to current statute law]], considered that sweeping prohibitions of religious attire or headgear by administrative authorities was contrary to law.

===International===
Some international human rights' organisations criticised the law. [[Human Rights Watch]] stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenneth Roth Executive Director |url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/02/26/france7666.htm |title=Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=2004-02-26 |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The proposed law is an unwarranted infringement on the right to religious practice. For many Muslims, wearing a headscarf is not only about religious expression, it is about religious obligation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[United States Commission on International Religious Freedom]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In February 2004, the Commission issued a public statement expressing concern over the proposed new law. The Commission expressed particular concern that the proposed restrictions may violate France’s international human rights commitments. The Commission also stated that though increased immigration in France in recent years has created new challenges for the French government, including integration of these immigrants into French society as well as problems of public order, these challenges should be addressed directly, and not by inappropriately limiting the right to freedom of thought, conscience, religion, and belief. The French government’s promotion of its understanding of the principle of secularism should not result in violations of the internationally recognized individual right to freedom of religion or belief.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf 2004 report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051008044821/http://www.uscirf.gov/countries/publications/currentreport/2004annualRpt.pdf |date=2005-10-08 }}, United States Commission on International Religious Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[United Nations Human Rights Committee]] stated that the expulsion of a Sikh pupil from his school in 2008 because of his Sikh turban or keski was a violation of the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] signed by France.&lt;ref name="hcr1852"&gt;{{cite web|title=HRC Communication No. 1852/2008|url=http://unitedsikhs.org/rtt/doc/BikramjitSinghDecision.pdf|work=Views adopted by the Committee at its 106th session|publisher=Human Rights Committee|accessdate=26 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
Various commentators outside of France condemned the law based on what they saw as its racist implications. Susan Price, an Australian activist, argued that "the wedge-politics of racism has always been used to divide the working class, which in France pulled off spectacular rolling strikes against the government in 2003," adding that "the current attack must also be seen as part of a continuum of racist policies which go back to the mid-1990s and the 'Fortress Europe' policies of the major European capitalist governments" designed "to appeal to the support base of Jean-Marie Le Pen's right-wing National Front (FN)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/30632 |title='Veiling the Issue: Sexism, Racism and Religion,' |publisher=Green Left Weekly |date=2004-01-28 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar arguments were made at the time by American anti-racist activist, Sharon Smith, who added the claim that Muslim women in France opposing the 2004 law were fighting against the same "state-imposed oppression" as women in Afghanistan were opposing by seeking freedom to choose to refrain from wearing burkas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/30632 |title='The Racist Hypocrisy Behind the Hijab Ban,' |publisher=''Socialist Worker (USA)'' |date=2004-02-28 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2013}}
The law came into effect on 2 September 2004, with the new school year. In September 2005, the Ministry of Education reported&lt;ref name=lemonde&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-694106@51-687857,0.html Le Monde], 30 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt; that only 12 students showed up with distinctive religious signs in the first week of classes, compared to 639 in the preceding year. A number of students have elected to take state-provided distance-learning classes from [[Centre national d'enseignement à distance|CNED]]. There was one case of a [[Sikh]] student in the ''[[French educational system#Académie system|académie]]'' of [[Créteil]], who refused to remove his [[turban]].&lt;ref name=lemonde/&gt;

The decision caused an outcry from many Muslims across the world, calling it a violation of freedom of practicing their religion. In addition to protests of a few thousand people in Paris, there were protests of up to a few hundred people in other countries, especially in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2004/01/17/headscarve040117.html|title=Global protest held against headscarf ban - CBC News|author=|date=|website=cbc.ca|accessdate=18 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3405453.stm | work=BBC News | title=Headscarf ban sparks new protests | date=17 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nusrah.com/en/articles/current-events/1929.and-the-world-speaks-out-worldwide-protest-of-fren.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

As a consequence of the law, the years following the ban has seen an increasing number of [[Madrasah|Islamic secondary schools]] being established, some{{Howmany|date=February 2013}} Muslim female students chose to study at home, and others{{Howmany|date=February 2013}} left France with their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Amara Bamba|title=French Anti-Hijab Law: Four Years On|publisher=[[IslamOnline]]|date=April 12, 2008|url=http://islamonline.com/news/articles/2/French_antihijab_law_four_years_on.html|accessdate=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=February 2013}}

==Interpretation==
{{Law unref section|date=May 2007}}
In some schools, the ban was also applied to long skirts and headbands. In April 2015, a 15-year-old schoolgirl in northeastern France was sent home for wearing a long skirt deemed an "ostentatious sign" of the girl’s Muslim faith by the principal. It caused further controversy and infuriated many of the country’s Muslims, who saw the school system’s censure of the girl as discriminatory. The Collective Against Islamophobia in France has documented 130 similar cases across France between January 2014 and April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/world/europe/french-school-teenagers-skirt-illegal-display-religion.html French School Deems Teenager’s Skirt an Illegal Display of Religion], ''The New York Times'', April 29, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|HASCO (disambiguation)}}
[[File:HASCO.JPG|right|thumb|Help Afghan School Children Organization (HASCO)]]
'''Help Afghan School Children Organization''' ('''HASCO''') is a [[Vienna]]-based [[non-profit]], non-partisan organization dedicated to the promotion of education of [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] disadvantaged children. HASCO was founded in 2002 by an Afghan humanitarian [[Hafizullah Khaled]].

HASCO members work on a voluntary basis, HASCO [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s in different countries spending their time and expertise to help Afghan disadvantaged children.
HASCO mostly focuses on the education of Afghan poor children and helping [[Afghan refugees]] families from [[refugee camps]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] to send their school-age children into school.

During last six years, HASCO has supported thousands of needy Afghan schoolchildren by providing them with school supplies, school bags, monthly contributions and other school necessities such as thermos, school caps, school clothes, and so on. Hasco volunteers also conducted rehabilitation works in schools recently burned by the [[Taliban]] in the eastern Afghan province of [[Laghman Province|Laghman]].

HASCO's big school supplies distribution programme has been launched under the name of Hope's Journey Caravan in June 2005 with the full co-operation of local education authorities and representatives of the Afghan Ministry of Education. During this operation, a large quantity of school supplies have been distributed to tens of schools in the [[Shamali Plains]] north of [[Kabul]].

== HASCO Volunteer gets UN Award ==
[[File:Rajaa Habeeb Abdullah Allwatiah (2006).jpg|right|thumb|Mrs.Allwatiah selected by UNV as Volunteer of the Year 2006]]
HASCO is a [[non-profit organization]] consisting dedicated volunteers from different countries; during last four years a large number of online volunteers have been introduced to HASCO by [[United Nations Volunteers]] Programme (UNV). These volunteers generously spent their time and expertise to make difference in the life of Afghan children.
HASCO volunteers are from different countries such as Afghanistan, [[Austria]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Jordan]], [[Egypt]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Oman]], [[UK]], and [[United States]].

On 5 December 2006 the [[United Nations Volunteers]] Programme (UNV) selected HASCO online volunteer Mrs. Allwatiah with other nine volunteers as online [[UNV Volunteer of the Year]] 2006. Mrs. Allwatiah is an Omani national, a mother of five children and head of the English department at a school in Oman.
The [[United Nations Volunteers]] (UNV) Program, has highlighted in the February 2008 newsletter the experience of HASCO Online volunteers to promote the ideals of volunteerism around the world. The UNV newsletter explained how HASCO online volunteer Daniela is helping the organization to reach out to the German-speaking public and potential donors by translating project proposals, reports and press releases from English to German. One day, her instant reaction to an assignment within a 24-hour deadline resulted in the donation of 1,000 schoolbags by the Municipality of Vienna.

In Afghanistan voluntary work plays an important role in the implementation of HASCO projects. HASCO volunteers, including female volunteers, actively participated in Hope's Journey Program to distribute school supplies to tens of boys and girls schools from [[Bagram airport]] to [[Kabul]] city.

== Programmes and Projects ==

During more than three decades war and destruction in [[Afghanistan]], children were among the main victims of long year’s war and bloodshed in their country. War not only killed and injured thousands of innocent Afghan children but at the same time thousands others were deprived from their basic right of education and schooling.
Today one of the big challenges of Afghan poor families is how to provide their school age children with school supplies and school needs. The conditions of those Afghan families recently returned from [[Pakistan]] and [[Iran]] [[refugee camps]] are not better than those living in [[Afghanistan]] on arrival at their village. They met only the ruins of their houses and farms. These families need assistance to send their children to school.

== Hope's Journey Caravan ==

To provide a large amount of basic school materials to thousands of needy school children in different communities and to avoid long bureaucratic barrier in distribution process, HASCO organized Hope's Journey Caravan in north of [[Kabul]].
During this one day humanitarian trip a large amount of school supplies have been distributed to tens of boys and girls schools in Qarabagh, Kalakan and Mir Bacha Kot districts in north of [[Kabul]]. Additional to HASCO volunteers, local education authorities and representatives of the Ministry of Education also participated in school supplies distribution process.

The school supplies have been collected during first part of Hope's Journey in [[United States]] by Mr. Cary Ragsdale, director of Hope's Journey Organization, Mr. Beau Moore, his closest friend, and tens of school children and teachers in [[United States]] for supporting [[Afghanistan]] school children.

[[International Security Assistance Force]]([[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]) in Afghanistan contributed to this programme by shipment of school supplies to Bagram airbase in north of Kabul.

== School Rehabilitation Programme ==

With deterioration of security situation in [[Afghanistan]], tens of schools have burned by [[Taliban]] extremists in south and eastern part of Afghanistan. With burning each school once again hundreds of innocent Afghan children have been deprived from their basic right of education.
These schools were set alight at the time while education authorities still are not able to rebuild hundreds of destroyed schools during civil war in [[Afghanistan]] and most of schools in [[Afghanistan]] are without class, desks and chairs. Children are sitting on the floor during school time.

Under HASCO School Rehabilitation programme five schools have been rehabilitated in eastern province of [[Laghman Province|Laghman]].

== Backpacks for Afghan School Children ==

Most of schools in [[Afghanistan]] province and districts are far and children have a long daily walk ahead of them in order to reach their schools. In some areas, children cross several hinders such as rivers, bridges and mountainous terrain to reach their school.
Providing Afghan children with schoolbag will help them to carry more easily their daily school materials.

Furthermore, to encourage Afghan families keep their children in school, additional to backpack and school supplies, other needs of school children such as school caps, thermos and school clothes were distributed by HASCO in different part of [[Afghanistan]].

== Orphan Sponsorship Programme ==

As a result of long year’s [[civil war]] and bloodshed today there are a huge number of [[orphans]] and disabled children in [[Afghanistan]]. Most of Afghan poverty stricken families are living without regular income. Their everyday life is a struggle for survival.
The aim of HASCO [[orphans]] sponsorship programme is to assist Afghan [[orphans]] and poor families by providing a specific amount of monthly contribution to cover school supplies and other necessities of their school children.

An '''Instructional Design Coordinator''' is a person who is responsible for overseeing the implementation of [[instructional design]] techniques, usually in an academic setting or in corporate training.

[[Instructional design]] became popular in the 1930s, when the [[United States]] was developing new instructional techniques, as the need for rapidly training soldiers in a multitude of technical fields rose sharply during [[World War II]]. Since then, instructional designers have come up with new and innovative techniques to facilitate learning, using the most advanced technology available to them. Today, Instructional Design Coordinators employ modern technology, such as the [[Internet]], to implement the techniques developed by instructional designers and distribute them to students in a variety of settings.

==Practice==

===Qualifications===
Instructional design coordinators come into contact with modern computing and [[communication technology]] on a daily basis, and must have a strong mastery of a variety of technology-related fields. The instructional design coordinator is expected to work closely with faculty and administrative staff to facilitate technology use in the modern classroom. He or she has experience working with Web-mediated instruction and [[multimedia applications]], is familiar with the principles of [[web design]], digital content distribution, use of Web 2.0 features in online learning and teaching, online collaboration software ([[groupware]]), [[chat rooms]] and [[message board]]s, content [[repository (publishing)|repositories]], online information storage and retrieval, and preferentially has industry experience working with or developing these technologies.

The successful candidate must also be closely familiar with common desktop computing environments, especially [[Microsoft Windows]] and, to a lesser extent, [[Mac OS]], both of which are used in academic settings. They should also be familiar with common desktop development and office applications, such as [[Microsoft Office]], [[Macromedia Dreamweaver]] and other applications in the [[Macromedia Studio]] series, [[Adobe Photoshop]], [[Adobe GoLive|GoLive]], applications designed for use in academic settings, such as [[Camtasia]], and other applications used for developing web content and facilitating remote instruction.

===Duties===
Instructional Design Coordinators are employed in a variety of technical specialties, such as [[technology]]-based and technology-enhanced instruction, [[distance learning]], [[multimedia]]-enhanced instruction, [[web design]] and [[web development]], library services, [[Faculty (university)|faculty]] and student training, course development, [[technical support]] for students and instructors, course content review, as well as many others. [http://www.higheredjobs.com/admin/details.cfm?JobCode=175197276]

===Distance Learning===
[[Distance learning]] is a rapidly growing trend in today's academic world, and has found wide acceptance in higher education in the [[United States]] and other developed countries. It remedies many logistical problems that are associated with traditional classroom settings, such as the need to be present on campus at a certain time, which is often a prohibitive stumbling block for those who work full-time. While distance learning can be conducted via a variety of communication media, the preferred method today is to deliver course content and facilitate interaction among students and between the instructor and the student via the [[World Wide Web]].[http://www.sdccdonline.net/distance_education.htm]

Instructional design coordinators are responsible for overseeing the development and distribution of web-based course content, working with instructors to develop and maintain functional web pages and facilitate the use of dynamic web applications for the distribution of course content, assessments, communication, grade reporting, as well as other tasks required to conduct a complete online learning program via the web.

The advantages to this form of instruction include flexibility for both the students and the instructor in regards to the time spent towards the course, as students are able to log on to the course web site at any time of the day or night. They also enjoy the freedom of being able to complete coursework from any location, as students are generally not required to come to campus at all for courses that are taught fully online.

====Technology====
Due to their increased adoption among educational institutions, distance learning programs drive the demand for powerful hardware and software to host educational applications, often for thousands of users per institution. Current popular [[learning management system]]s include [[Blackboard Inc.|Blackboard]] and [[Moodle]], which are both widely used on campuses nationwide. [http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2008/06/09/01moodle.h02.html]

These software suites provide course home pages for instructors which can be easily edited via online forms. The software allows instructors to easily add content via online text editors or using [[HTML]] markup. In addition to uploading lecture content, instructors are also able to upload files which would be distributed as handouts in a traditional classroom setting. Students who log onto the course home page can view the course content online or download the materials provided by the instructor, as well as submit assignments posted by the instructor by uploading files from their computers. Instructors can view all student submissions online and grade the assignments through the web interface, making the graded work available to the student immediately. Online grading can be very efficient as it eliminates the need for instructors or teaching assistants to manually calculate grades for assignments or exams, which can also be taken online by students, and are often graded automatically by the software.

The advantages of online learning also motivate many instructors who teach in a traditional classroom setting to use online learning technology to supplement their curricula.

The instructional design coordinator is familiar with the needs of online instructors, especially regarding communication and content distribution. He or she is responsible for adapting existing technology to make the technology as transparent and functional for students and instructors alike. A successful instructional design coordinator understands concepts of [[software usability]], as well as technical support and training in order to deploy software packages that serve the various needs of his or her educational community.

===Administrative Duties===
In addition to assisting with the development and the successful deployment of course content to students via the web, the instructional design coordinator also needs to keep records of, and carefully review the contents of the courses which the institution offers, to ensure that the content that is distributed is accessible to all students, complies with current [[web standards]], as well as legal requirements, such as [[Section 508]] of the US [[Rehabilitation Act]], which mandates that electronic publications by government agencies be accessible to persons with disabilities, and copyright compliance, taking into consideration provisions of the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]].

===Support and Training===
Instructional Design Coordinators are expected to use their expertise in various technological fields to train faculty and students to use available technology to the fullest extent. In addition to conducting training sessions and seminars, instructional design coordinators provide technical support for students and faculty, ensuring that assistance via phone and e-mail is available to the users as much as possible. The associate needs to guide users through preparing their computers for online learning, perform administrative tasks, such as managing online student enrollment, account management, as well as personal assistance required by users in order to successfully use the available software. It is imperative for the instructional design coordinator to communicate efficiently with students, faculty, and supporting staff to manage the proper implementation of the learning programs required by the institution.

The '''Interamerican University Studies Institute (IUSI)''' transferred its principal programs to the Oregon University System's International Office in 2009, and shut down its operations the following year. For information regarding the current programs, see http://oia.pdx.edu/ea/

The '''Interamerican University Studies Institute (IUSI)''' fosters educational and cultural exchange between the U.S. and Latin America to address the need for better understanding among the peoples of the Americas. Over the past 21 years, IUSI has sponsored more than 2,000 US citizens in the city of [[Santiago de Querétaro|Querétaro]], [[Mexico]], and in [[Costa Rica]]. The institute has conducted successful programs with [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]], [[Middlebury College|Middlebury]] and [[Westmont College|Westmont]] Colleges; the Universities of [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], [[University of Mississippi|Mississippi]], [[Northern Arizona University|Northern Arizona]], and [[University of Mary Hardin-Baylor|Mary Hardin-Baylor]]; and the [[Catholic University of America]]. Primary institutional partners in Querétaro include the [http://www.uaq.mx Universidad Autónoma de Querétaro] (UAQ is the state university); the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071013135305/http://queretaro-mexico.com.mx/museo-arte/home.html Queretaro Museum of Art], and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091026192558/http://geocities.com/said_algabr/ Centro de Educación Artística (CEDART)] an arts-based public high school under the national [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208000552/http://www.bellasartes.gob.mx/INBA/index.jsp Instituto de Bellas Artes]. The goal of IUSI’s programs is to promote high-quality academic learning and cross-cultural  integration between US and Latin American peoples. IUSI's board of directors includes Alicia Andreu, [[Araceli Ardón]], David Curland, Juan Armando Epple, Robert M. Jackson and Fernando de Necochea,

Since 1985, IUSI has provided intensive [[Spanish language]] and cultural immersion programs for undergraduate and graduate level college students. As well, IUSI administers two high school programs for exceptional youth, Artes en Mexico and ¡Pura Vida!, an intensive field biology program in the Costa Rican rain forest. IUSI sponsors the participation of Mexican high school students in a summer jazz music camp in Oregon. It holds a binational workshop in literary translation for Mexican and US participants, now in its ninth year. In collaboration with the University of Oregon it will offer a new graduate seminar in Mexican literature and language. 

Participants are recruited nationally; courses run from one week to a full college semester.

{{rquote|right|The title of Institute professor is an honor bestowed by the Faculty and Administration of MIT on a faculty colleague who has demonstrated exceptional distinction by a combination of leadership, accomplishment, and service in the scholarly, educational, and general intellectual life of the Institute or wider academic community.&lt;ref name="MITdefinition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/policies/2.2.html |title=MIT Policies and Procedures: Special Professorial Appointments, Institute Professor |accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;|MIT Policies and Procedures: Special Professorial Appointments, Institute Professor}}

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;'''Institute Professor''' is the highest title that can be awarded to a [[List of Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty|faculty member]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], a research university located in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], [[United States]]. It is analogous to the titles of [[distinguished professor]], [[university professor]], or [[regents professor]] used at other universities in recognition of a professor's extraordinary research achievements and dedication to the school. At MIT, Institute Professors are granted a unique level of freedom and flexibility to pursue their research and teaching interests without regular departmental or school responsibilities; they report only to the [[Provost (education)|provost]].&lt;ref name="MITdefinition"/&gt; Usually no more than twelve professors hold this title at any one time.&lt;ref name="MITdefinition"/&gt; The position was created by President [[James R. Killian]] in 1951 and [[John C. Slater]] was the first to hold the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tech.mit.edu/archives/VOL_071/TECH_V071_S0128_P002.pdf |title=Slater Takes New Post as Roving Physics Professor |accessdate=2007-04-22 |date=September 18, 1951 |publisher=The Tech|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institute Professors are initially nominated by leaders representing either a department or school. The chair of the faculty then consults with the Academic Council and jointly appoints with the president an ad-hoc committee from various departments and non-MIT members to evaluate the qualifications and make a documented recommendation to the president. The final determination is made based upon recommendations from professionals in the nominee's field. The case is then reviewed again by the Academic Council and approved by the Executive Committee of the MIT Corporation.&lt;ref name="MITdefinition"/&gt;

The tables below provide a list of foreign languages most frequently taught in American schools and colleges. They reflect the popularity of these languages in terms of the total number of enrolled students in the [[United States]]. (Here, a [[foreign language]] means any language other than [[English language|English]], and includes American Sign Language.)

== Lists ==
Below are the top foreign languages studied in [[Education_in_the_United_States#K.E2.80.9312_education|public K-12 schools]] (i.e., primary and secondary schools). The tables correspond to the 18.5% (some 8.9 million) of all K-12 students in the U.S. (about 49 million) who take foreign-language classes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.actfl.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/ReportSummary2011.pdf |title=Foreign Language Enrollments in K–12 Public Schools |date=February 2011 |publisher=American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages (ACTFL) |access-date=October 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Universities in Hungary''' have generally been instituted by [[Act of Parliament]] under the Higher Education Act. For new [[public universities]] and [[private universities]], approval is required from the Ministry of responsible for the education and later from the [[National Assembly (Hungary)|Hungarian National Assembly]]. The Hungarian public [[higher education]] system includes universities and other higher education institutes, that provide both education curricula and related degrees up to doctoral degree and also contribute to research activities. In general, public Hungarian universities don't charge tuition fees.

The following is a list of [[University|universities]] and colleges of [[higher education]] in [[Hungary]] (listed alphabetically and grouped by location and funding), followed by a list of defunct institutions.

Influenced by the work of [[Margaret Sanger]], she organized door to door campaigns in rural [[Maine]] in the 1950s and 1960s to teach women about birth control. In the 1960s she established and directed the state's first [[family planning]] program which provided contraceptive services, and helped found the Maine Family Planning Association in 1971, serving as its first president. In 1984 she supported the establishment and naming of the [[Mabel Wadsworth Women's Health Center]] in [[Bangor, Maine]], a private, non-profit, [[feminist health center]]. Wadsworth was in the first class of inductees to the [[Maine Women's Hall of Fame]] in March 1990.

==Early life, education, and marriage==
Mabel Antoinette Sine was born in [[Rochester, New York]], to David Albert Sine and his wife Effie Maude Harrison Sine.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; After graduating from [[Spencerport High School]], she studied at the [[University of Rochester]] School of Nursing, receiving her diploma in 1931.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; That same year, she married Richard C. Wadworth, M.D. (1905–1980).&lt;ref name=richard/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; They had three daughters.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; They resided in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]], during her husband's tenure as a [[Pathology|pathologist]] at Metropolitan State Hospital in [[Waltham, Massachusetts|Waltham]].&lt;ref name=richard/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; In 1946 they relocated to [[Bangor, Maine]],&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; where her husband headed the Stoddard Laboratory at [[Eastern Maine Medical Center|Eastern Maine General Hospital and Medical Center]] from 1947 to 1972.&lt;ref name=richard&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2457&amp;dat=19800909&amp;id=ZnM-AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rFkMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2038,3871474&amp;hl=en|title=Bangor physician dies at 74|newspaper=Bangor Daily News|date=9 September 1980|accessdate=26 February 2016|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
While in nursing school, Wadsworth became acquainted with the work of American birth control activist [[Margaret Sanger]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She decided to work in the field of [[reproductive rights]] education, as she saw more and more teen girls having [[Unintended pregnancy|unwanted pregnancies]].&lt;ref name=boston/&gt; Coming to Bangor in 1946, she joined the Maternal Health League, a volunteer organization modeled on Sanger's work which stressed contraceptive education.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, Wadsworth organized teams of outreach workers who went door to door in rural Maine to teach women about birth control.&lt;ref name=boston&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-7940210.html|title=Mabel Wadsworth, 95, Pioneer in Women's Health Care in Maine|first=Gloria|last=Negri|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=13 January 2006|accessdate=26 February 2016|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told the ''[[Bangor Daily News]]'' in 2005: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It wasn't about [[feminism]] back in those days. It was simply educating women that you really and truly could take a pill and not have any more babies. It took some convincing for a lot of them, but when they tried it, they found it worked quite well.&lt;ref name=champ&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-15498199.html|title=Mabel Wadsworth: Championed women's health care|date=13 March 2008|accessdate=26 February 2016|work=Bangor Daily News|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1960s, Wadsworth established and directed Maine's first family planning program that provided contraception services. Rather than hire professionally-trained counselors and outreach workers to staff the program, she chose women who could relate with clients because of their own personal experience.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; While the clinics that Wadsworth supervised were often targeted by protesters and "angry letters [were] published in the paper about them", Wadsworth remained committed to the woman's right to choose.&lt;ref name=boston/&gt;

In 1971 she was instrumental in the founding of the Maine Family Planning Association.&lt;ref name=aclu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aclumaine.org/womens-history-month-mabel-wadsworth|title=Mabel Wadsworth|date=20 March 2014|accessdate=26 February 2016|publisher=American Civil Liberties Union of Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served as the group's first president and was a member of its board of directors.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She also lobbied for the successful passage of a state bill that gave teenagers "confidential access to contraceptives and [[Sexually transmitted infection#Diagnosis|STI testing]]".&lt;ref name=aclu/&gt;

In 1984 she supported the establishment and the naming of the Mabel Wadsworth Women's Health Center in [[Bangor, Maine]] in her honor.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; The private, non-profit, feminist health service provides birth control, abortion, and AIDS treatment in addition to general women's health care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.mabelwadsworth.org/documents/AnnualReport2007_000.pdf|title=Spectrum of Care|journal=News from Mabel – 2005&amp;ndash;2006 Annual Report|publisher=Mabel Wadsworth Women's Health Center|year=2006|page=2|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070702115230/http://www.mabelwadsworth.org/documents/AnnualReport2007_000.pdf|archivedate=2007-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other activities==
Wadsworth volunteered for organizations including the Eastern Maine General Hospital Auxiliary and the [[League of Women Voters]]. She participated in the establishment of the Women's Resource Center (forerunner to the Maine Displaced Homemakers Program) and the first [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] chapter in Maine. She served on the board of directors of the Bangor Counseling Center, serving as its first president.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; She established the Mabel Sine Wadsworth Award at the University of Rochester School of Nursing, which benefits nursing graduates who have "excelled in the women's health care area".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.son.rochester.edu/current-students/commencement-awards.html|title=Commencement Awards|publisher=[[University of Rochester]] School of Nursing|year=2013|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In March 1990 Wadsworth was in the first class of inductees to the [[Maine Women's Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|title=Maine Women's Hall of Fame Honorees – Mabel Sine Wadsworth|publisher=[[University of Maine at Augusta]]|year=2016|accessdate=26 February 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306082338/http://www.uma.edu/community/maine-womens-hall-of-fame/|archivedate=6 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April she received the Maryann Hartman Award from the [[University of Maine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1914&amp;dat=19900409&amp;id=YgsgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=HmUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2462,1830210&amp;hl=en|title=Hartman Awards to honor women who achieve, inspire|newspaper=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Sun Journal]]|date=9 April 1990|accessdate=26 February 2016|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Manfredo Tafuri''' ([[Rome]], 4 November 1935 &amp;ndash; [[Venice]], 23 February 1994), an [[Italians|Italian]] architect, historian, theoretician, critic and academic, was described by one commentator as the world's most important architectural historian of the second half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jongoodbun.wordpress.com/papers-and-publication/2006-the-assassin-the-critical-legacies-of-manfredo-tafuri/ ''2006 The Assassin: The Critical Legacies of Manfredo Tafuri''] in Radical Philosophy 138 July/August 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He is noted for his pointed critiques of the partisan "operative criticism" of previous architectural historians and critics like [[Bruno Zevi]] and [[Sigfried Giedion|Siegfried Giedion]] and for challenging the idea that the [[Renaissance]] was a "golden age" as it had been characterised in the work of earlier authorities like [[Heinrich Wölfflin]] and [[Rudolf Wittkower]].

==Career==
For Tafuri, architectural history does not follow a teleological scheme in which one language succeeds another in linear sequence. Instead, it is a continuous struggle played out on critical, theoretical and ideological levels as well as through the multiple constraints placed on practice. Since this struggle continues in the present, architectural history is not a dead academic subject, but an open arena for debate. In his view, like other cultural domains, but even more so, due to the tension between its autonomous, artistic character and its technical and functional dimensions, architecture is a field defined and constituted by crisis.

During the 1970s, Tafuri published important essays in ''[[Oppositions]]'', the journal directed by [[Peter Eisenman]]. Although he always had a strong interest in this area of research, in the last decade of his career he undertook a comprehensive reassessment of the theory and practice of Renaissance architecture, exploring its various social, intellectual and cultural contexts, while providing a broad understanding of uses of representation that shaped the entire era. His final work, ''Interpreting the Renaissance: Princes, Cities, Architects'', published in 1992, synthesizes the history of architectural ideas and projects through discussions of the great centres of architectural innovation in Italy (Florence, Rome, and Venice), key patrons from the middle of the fifteenth century to the early sixteenth century, and crucial figures such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]], [[Francesco di Giorgio]], [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], [[Bramante]], [[Raphael]], [[Baldassare Castiglione]] and [[Giulio Romano]].

Tafuri held the position of chair of [[architectural history]] at the [[University Iuav of Venice]].

'''Marburn Academy''' is a [[non-profit]] [[Private school|independent day school for students in grades 2–]][[K-12 school|12 school]] in [[New Albany, Ohio]]. The school was created in 1981, with the goal of providing a nurturing educational environment for above average students who had struggled with traditional schooling. Education at the school geared towards children struggling with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|ADHD]], [[dyslexia]] and/or executive function issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marburn History: Location, Affiliations, Accreditations {{!}} Marburn Academy|url=http://www.marburnacademy.org/about-marburn/history/|website=Marburn Academy|accessdate=May 21, 2017|language=en|date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school prides itself on being one of 13 accredited [[Orton-Gillingham]] schools in the [[United States]], and its 100% acceptance rate of its high school students to colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marburn Difference {{!}} Scientifically Validated Teaching Methods {{!}} Marburn Academy|url=http://www.marburnacademy.org/academics-programs/unique-instruction/|website=Marburn Academy|accessdate=May 21, 2017|language=en|date=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Marburn Academy moved from [[Forest Park East]], Columbus, to a new location at 9555 Johnstown Road, [[New Albany, Ohio]] 43054.

'''Mashups''' are a combination of two or more data sources that have been integrated into one source. They typically consist of [[graphics]], texts, audio clips, and video that have been sourced from various media such as [[blogs]], [[wikis]], YouTube, Google Maps, etc., into a new product.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dartmouth|first=College Library|title=Mashups: Instructional Design Tips &amp; Tricks|url=http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/content.php?pid=164800&amp;sid=1391452|publisher=Dartmouth College Library|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remix is a related term, referring to how data sources have been combined to produce a constellation of elements that were not originally intended by the creators. Mashups rely on open and discoverable resources, open and transparent licensing, and open and remixable formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Brian|title=Dr. Mashup; or, Why Educators Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Remix|url=http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/dr-mashup-or-why-educators-should-learn-stop-worrying-and-love-remix|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the educational context, mashups are being used as an instructional tool by the teacher and/or as a product created by the student who are responsible for manipulating the data themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Tim|title=Student Created Mashups|journal=TechTrends|date=December 2010|volume=54|issue=6|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, http://rru.worldbank.org/businessplanet/, is a mashup website that was created by the [[World Bank]] to provide learners with data about country [[GDP]], GDP growth, taxes, and other related information about countries around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Tim|journal=TechTrends|date=October 2010|volume=54|issue=5|pages=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students can use this platform to investigate real-world questions and generate their own arguments as a form of inquiry-based learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Archambault|first=L |author2=Tsai, W.T. |author3=Crippen, K.|title=Exploring Cyberlearning: Inquiry-Based Mashups Combining Computer Science with STEM|journal=Proceedings of Society for Information Technology &amp; Teacher Education International Conference|year=2011|pages=3867–3874|url=http://www.editlib.org/p/36935.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this places students into the role of the participant in the internet as they engage in discovering, remixing, and sharing content. As a result, mashups provide pedagogical opportunities, among them, as a tool within the constructivist approach to learning and also a way of teaching digital literacy, science, social studies, video production, and web development. Mashups rely on open and discoverable resources, open and transparent licensing, and open and remixable formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Brian|title=Dr. Mashup; or, Why Educators Should Learn to Stop Worrying and Love the Remix|url=http://www.educause.edu/ero/article/dr-mashup-or-why-educators-should-learn-stop-worrying-and-love-remix|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses in the classroom==

===Student-created Mashups===
Students can create mashups as objects for evaluation and assessment in the classroom. Mashups can be included in reports and assignments to provide a visual representation to describe data and to "demonstrate mastery of a subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dartmouth|first=College Library|title=Mashups: Instructional Design Tips &amp; Tricks|url=http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/content.php?pid=164800&amp;sid=1391452|publisher=Dartmouth College Library|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the internet learners access free development platforms such as Yahoo’s Pipes, [[Google Mashup Editor]], and Microsoft’s [[Popfly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yue|first=Kwok-Bun|title=Experience on Mashup Development with End User Programming Environment|journal=Journal of Information Systems Education|year=2010|volume=21|issue=1|pages=111–119}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of a student created mashup project is MapSkip. Students manipulated a Google Map by marking different places they have visited by adding their videos, audio clips, or images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu, Min|author2=Horton, Lucas |author3=Olmanson, Justin |author4= Wang, Pei-Yu |title=An exploration of mashups and their potential educational uses|journal=Computers in the Schools|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=243–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student created mashups are also used in Higher Education; graduate students in a [[YouTube for Educators]] course learned to make mashups for their students, incorporating three or more video clips from different sources into an educational short on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snelson|first=C |editor=T. Amiel |editor2=B. Wilson |title=Video Mashups and YouTube: The Mixing and Mashing Media Module|journal=Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications|year=2012 |url=http://www.editlib.org/p/41081}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The goals of this project were not only learning video editing skills, but also "raise[ing] awareness of copyright issues and how to obtain media online from public sources".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snelson |first=C |editor=T. Amiel |editor2=B. Wilson |title=Video Mashups and YouTube: The Mixing and Mashing Media Module |journal=Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications |year=2012 |url=http://www.editlib.org/p/41081}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ties into teaching digital literacy as students need to be able to "effectively and critically navigate, evaluate and create information using a range of digital technology" (digital literacy wiki page).

===Mashups as learning materials===
Because research can be displayed on interactive graphs, charts, or maps to clarify difficult concepts for the learners &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dartmouth|first=College Library|title=Mashups: Instructional Design Tips &amp; Tricks|url=http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/content.php?pid=164800&amp;sid=1391452|publisher=Dartmouth College Library|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;   through a mashup, they can serve as dynamic learning materials for students to use in the classroom. Students can use this platform to  "reach new conclusions or discern new relationships by uniting large amounts of data in a manageable way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dartmouth|first=College Library|title=Mashups: Instructional Design Tips &amp; Tricks|url=http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/content.php?pid=164800&amp;sid=1391452|publisher=Dartmouth College Library|accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would facilitate inquiry-based learning as students investigate and generate their own arguments dealing with real-world problems (Archambault et al.). For example, a fifth grade classroom used Mapdango to explore [[US National Parks]]. Mapdango uses data from Wikipedia, Google Maps, Panoramia, and weather data to create reports about a specific national park. Students used this mashup to get additional information when exploring the National Parks.

==Limitations and criticisms==
A common issue surrounding the widespread use of mashups in education is the lack of open and discoverable resources because of non-transparent [[licensing]] issues (Snelson). 
Educators must be wary of issues of plagiarism and copyright infringement in their student-created mashups and in those they present to their students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Greene|first=Tim|title=Student Created Mashups|journal=TechTrends|date=December 2010|volume=54|issue=6|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues of the legal reuse of media should be explicitly addressed by instructors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Snelson|first=C |editor=T. Amiel |editor2=B. Wilson |title=Video Mashups and YouTube: The Mixing and Mashing Media Module |journal=Proceedings of World Conference on Educational Multimedia, Hypermedia and Telecommunications |year=2012 |url=http://www.editlib.org/p/41081}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with data accuracy, content appropriateness and stability play into the credibility of mashups' use in the educational context. As mashups are a dynamic resource (and user-generated), they can be unpredictable in their uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu, Min|author2=Horton, Lucas |author3=Olmanson, Justin |author4= Wang, Pei-Yu |title=An exploration of mashups and their potential educational uses|journal=Computers in the Schools|year=2008|volume=25|issue=3-4|pages=243–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "most publicly available data used in mashups today (e.g., Flickr or YouTube) are not designed for educational purposes."

However, this degree program concentrates heavily on leader-follower interactions, cross-cultural communications, coaching, influencing, team development, leading organizational changes, strategic thinking,  [[project leader]]ship, and behavioral motivation theories. It does not concentrate on financial or quantitative analysis, [[marketing]], or [[accounting]] which are common in MBA programs. The degree program is appealing to businesspeople in well-established careers already. The MSL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Organizational Leadership]] (MSOL) degree or the Master of Leadership Sciences degree offered by the [[National School of Leadership]] in India.

'''''Microcosmographia Academica''''' ("A Study of a Tiny Academic World" in [[Latin language|Latin]]) is a short [[pamphlet]] on [[university]] [[politics]] written by [[F. M. Cornford]] and published in 1908. It has acquired a small cult following as a pessimistic view of academic politics presented in a readable and lively style, and is best known for its discussion of such principles as "[[Camel's nose|The (Thin End of the) Wedge]]" and "The Dangerous [[Precedent]]":

: The ''Principle of the Wedge'' is that you should not act justly now for fear of raising expectations that you may act still more justly in the future{{snd}}expectations which you are afraid you will not have the courage to satisfy. A little reflection will make it evident that the Wedge argument implies the admission that the persons who use it cannot prove that the action is not just. If they could, that would be the sole and sufficient reason for not doing it, and this argument would be superfluous.

: The ''Principle of the Dangerous Precedent'' is that you should not now do an admittedly right action for fear you, or your equally timid successors, should not have the courage to do right in some future case, which, ''[[ex hypothesi]]'', is essentially different, but superficially resembles the present one. Every public action which is not customary, either is wrong, or, if it is right, is a dangerous precedent. It follows that nothing should ever be done for the first time.

The book is also known for Cornford's definition, in the preface to a later edition, of [[propaganda]] as: "that branch of the art of lying which consists in very nearly deceiving your friends without quite deceiving your enemies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1VH7AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=cornford+propaganda&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AxmXHpRYQn&amp;sig=RqV5L5_Gym563EAJUvPTzTFZtg4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjvz7ugtpvWAhUTM8AKHZUQASQQ6AEIOzAG#v=onepage&amp;q=cornford%20propaganda&amp;f=false |title=A Theory of Public Opinion |page=159 |first=Francis Graham |last=Wilson |authorlink=Francis Wilson (political scientist) |isbn=978-1412815017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although written for an audience familiar with the procedures of the [[University of Cambridge]] at the turn of the twentieth century, it could apply to any political system and is similar to the British television comedy ''[[Yes Minister]]''; some of the dialogue in the "Doing the Honours" episode closely follows its text.

[[Christopher Hitchens]] quotes several parts and reflects upon this essay in his book ''[[Letters to a Young Contrarian]]'', introducing it to the reader by quoting the above Principles of Wedge and Dangerous Precedent. “F.M. Cornford [was] a witty Cambridge academic of the Edwardian period who had become used to every possible High Table euphemism and Senior Common Room obfuscation. He anatomised them all in his 1908 treatise, ''Microcosmographia Academia''. The passage I’ll give you is from chapter 7, entitled “Arguments”: ''There is only one argument for doing something; the rest arguments for doing nothing.  Since the stone-axe fell into disuse at the close of the neolithic age, two other arguments of universal application have been added to the rhetorical armoury by the ingenuity of mankind. [...]''"&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher. [https://books.google.com/books?id=TfW-92DugAwC&amp;pg=PA43 ''Letters to a Young Contrarian'']. Basic Books, 2001, p. 43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gordon Johnson (historian)|Gordon Johnson]] included it in his 2008 book ''University Politics: F. M. Cornford's Cambridge and his Advice to the Young Academic Politician'' about the politics of the [[University of Cambridge]], preceded by a description of the background against which Cornford was writing.

{{Original research|date=August 2017}}
'''Murga''' (also spelled '''murgha''') is a [[stress position]] used as a [[corporal punishment]] in parts of [[South Asia]] (specifically Northern [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and sometimes in [[Bangladesh]]). It is used primarily in educational institutions, and by the [[police]] as a summary, informal punishment for [[petty crime]]s committed by boys, such as [[eve teasing]]. The punishment is usually administered in public view, the purpose being to deter recurrence of the offence by shaming the offender and providing a salutary example to others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Public prosecution: Crime and instant punishment! |first= |last= |newspaper=[[The Times of India]] |date=June 29, 2006 |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1690507.cms |accessdate= |first1=Arunima |last1=Srivastava}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The word ''murga'' means [[rooster]] in [[Hindi language|Hindi]] and [[Urdu language]]. The punished person takes a position resembling that of a rooster, by [[Squatting position|squatting]] and then looping the arms behind the knees and firmly holding the ears.&lt;ref name="Sanchita2011"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sanchita Islam | title=Gungi Blues | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZilfKlN-ysC&amp;pg=PA127 | accessdate=27 November 2012 | date=14 June 2011 | publisher=Chipmunkapublishing ltd | isbn=978-1-84747-259-5 | page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MadanMohan2010"&gt;{{cite book | author=Madan Mohan Jha | title=From Special To Inclusive Education In India: Case Studies Of Three Schools In Delhi | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxiZjWgDwlYC&amp;pg=PA51 | accessdate=27 November 2012 | date=1 September 2010 | publisher=Pearson Education India | isbn=978-81-317-3217-5 | page=51 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Having to hold the ears makes it especially painful. It can become extremely painful after one minute. Usually given by female teachers in school as it not required any force by punisher. Over the years, corporal punishment has been banned in schools in India and Pakistan and although [[caning]] is still frequent, the Murga punishment is now used in private tuitions mostly.

==Variants==
There are many variants of the Murga punishment. Some of them are:

===Standing murga===
In this position, the recipient of the punishment is required to position the buttocks as high as possible while holding their ears from behind the legs as in the regular murga position. With the bottom having to be kept raised without any support, this is a bit similar to remaining sitting in the air without a chair. This is a very intense and severe punishment, as it requires constantly working against gravity to keep the bottom raised, and therefore becomes extremely painful within a matter of minutes. Almost every dull student born in 90's have faced this.

For an average person, muscle fatigue starts to set in within a couple of minutes of getting into the standing murgha position. Holding on even for a total of two or 3 minutes becomes very painful. As the punishment continues, it gets unbearable and legs start to tremble. For most people, it is nearly impossible to maintain this position beyond 3 minutes and takes a lot of will power to continue. In order to keep the punishment going, teachers sometimes beat the punished student on the back or bottom with a stick or ruler the moment they lower their butt. Alternatively, a teacher may finish the punishment sooner if the student keeps their bottom properly raised, and prolong the punishment if they see the student lower their butt.

===Regular, or sitting murga===

This is the default murgha position, i.e. if you tell someone to assume the murgha position (without spelling out the exact variant), they go into the sitting position. In this position, the person is allowed to relax his/her bottom on the arms. The only requirement is to hold the ears by bringing the arms from behind the legs just as in standing murgha. Being able to rest the bottom on the arms makes this milder than standing murgha, and therefore, it can be done for a much longer duration. Nevertheless, it is still a very severe punishment. The lower legs and arms start hurting pretty soon. The arms hurt as they are squashed between the upper and lower part of the legs, and the lower legs because it's a very awkward position. (In contrast, standing murgha is easier on the arms as they are not squished, but it is much tougher on the legs including the thighs as one constantly has to work against gravity to keep the butt lifted. Sitting murgha does not hurt the thighs much). However, since sitting murgha does not require constantly working against gravity, durations of 10-20 minutes or more are not uncommon. In some cases the duration may even go up to an hour, though that is very severe and is done only rarely.

As the duration gets longer, the tiredness starts to get more unbearable. At some point, one may feel compelled to raise one's bottom to get some relief. However, that only brings temporary relief as keeping the buttocks raised is painful (see standing murgha section), so one soon returns to the lower position. That again brings only temporary relief and one again feels like going back to the raised position. In this way, one can end up oscillating between the two positions, not getting much relief either way.

===Combination of standing and regular/sitting Murga===

Sometimes, sitting and standing murga are combined in order to make the punishment both long and severe. One such combination is to make the person stay in standing murga almost throughout, but allow them to rest their bottom in the regular murga position for half a minute or so from time to time. This makes it possible to increase the duration of the standing murga punishment.

Another combination is to start with standing murga for the first few minutes when the person is fresh, and then let them lower their bottom for a much longer sitting murga punishment. Or in some cases, start with standing murgha for the first few minutes followed by a much longer sitting murgha period, but have the last few minutes of the punishment in standing murga again in order to end on a tougher note. Yet another combination is to switch between sitting and standing murga once every few minutes and have several such iterations.

===Murga parade===
In murgha parade, the person in addition to being in murga position, has to walk. It is almost impossible to walk in sitting murgha, so for all practical purpose it must be done in standing murgha. This can be extremely tiring for both legs, hands and back. Recall that standing murgha is very severe by itself. Add to it having to walk and it becomes really tough. It also hurts the ears because of irregular movements. For these reasons, an average person can only do this for a very short period, usually not more than a couple of minutes, and that too with a lot of difficulty and pain. 

In some cases, the person may be required to make sounds like a rooster loudly and count the no of rounds completed while doing a murgha parade.
 
Yet another variation of this punishment is to make someone walk under the sun but this can be very dangerous as it can cause dehydration. It is therefore considered highly inadvisable to do so.

===Swaying Murga===
In this kind of punishment, the person is asked to move his buttocks from the higher position (as in Standing Murga) to lower (as in Sitting Murga) and vice versa every 5–6 seconds.This is a very severe form; the legs start trembling after about 40 sways and becomes unbearable after 70-75 sways.

===Murga riding===
In this punishment, the person is made to carry another person on his back . A less intense variant is to put some weight (but not a whole person) on the back of the person in the murgha position. In practical terms, this is extremely difficult and can even cause serious injury, and it is therefore considered strongly inadvisable to punish someone this way.

'''Nina Aleksandrovna Andreyeva''' ({{lang-ru|Нина Александровна Андреева}}, born 12 October 1938) is a Russian chemist, teacher, author, political activist, and social critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian history|year=2004|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=0028659074|pages=v. 1, p. 60|editor=James R. Millar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A supporter of classical [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] principles, she wrote an essay entitled ''I Cannot Forsake My Principles''  that defended many aspects of the traditional Soviet system, and criticized [[General Secretary]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his closest supporters for not being true [[Communism|communists]]. In the rebuke published in the official party newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' the essay was called ''The Manifesto of Anti-[[Perestroika]] Forces''.&lt;ref&gt;Quote: "...вопросы подняты серьезные и в таком ключе, который иначе как идейной платформой, манифестом антиперестроечных сил не назовешь. "&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/05/world/new-ferment-on-the-pariah-of-perestroika.html "New Ferment On the Pariah Of Perestroika"], ''NY Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in chemistry ==
She was born in [[Leningrad]] (now [[St. Petersburg]]), and was a chemistry lecturer at the [[Leningrad Technological Institute]]. She joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) in 1966.

== I Cannot Forsake My Principles ==
Her essay ''I Cannot Forsake My Principles'' (''Не могу поступаться принципами''; variously translated in English commentary) was published in the newspaper ''[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]'' on March 13, 1988, at a time when Gorbachev and [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]] were abroad, and cited an anti-Gorbachev report by the secretary of the Communist Party's [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]], [[Yegor Ligachev]].

Conservative party officials welcomed the essay, whereas supporters of Gorbachev and [[Boris Yeltsin]] feared that it represented a major threat for them. Gorbachev subsequently revealed that many members of the Politburo seemed to share Andreyeva's views, and that he had to coerce them into approving the publication of an official rejoinder. The published response appeared in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 5 April 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Archie|authorlink=Archie Brown|title=The Rise and Fall of Communism|year=2009|publisher=Ecco|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-06-113879-9|pages=504–506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==
Andreyeva subsequently played a leadership role in the formation of communist organisations. She headed the organizing committee of the Bolshevik Platform of the CPSU that expelled Gorbachev from the party in September 1991. In November 1991, she became the general secretary of the [[All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks (1991)|All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks]], which saw itself as the successor to the CPSU. In October 1993, the party was temporarily suspended along with fifteen other organisations after President Yeltsin's repression of the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|attempted coup]] against his regime. In May 1995 she was removed from the post as the head of the [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] [[Central Committee]] of the party for "lack of revolutionary activity." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Russian history|year=2004|publisher=Thomson Gale|location=Detroit|isbn=0028659074|pages=v. 1, p. 61|editor=James R.

'''Oda Slobodskaya''' (28 November 1888 - 30 July 1970&lt;ref&gt;[http://authorities.loc.gov/ Library of Congress authority file]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Russia]]n born [[soprano]] who became a [[British citizen]].

Her biographer Maurice Leonard quotes Slobodskaya as having been born on 28 November 1888 in Vilno (now [[Vilnius]]) near the [[Poland|Polish]] border. She won a scholarship for secondary education but, having completed her schooling, to her displeasure, found herself working with her parents in a secondhand clothes shop. Knowing she had a good voice, in 1907 she applied for an audition at the [[Saint Petersburg Conservatory]]. Having no classical repertoire she sang the simple songs she had learned as a chlld. Despite this lack of sophistication, her vocal potential was immediately apparent. The Director, [[Alexander Glazunov|Glazunov]], and [[Natalia Iretskaya|Natalya Iretskaya]] (the most important Russian singing tutor and herself a pupil of [[Pauline Viardot]]) accepted her and awarded her a scholarship for nine years' study.

==The Mariinsky Theatre==
In 1916 she made her debut, as Lisa in [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''The Queen of Spades'' the [[Mariinsky Theatre]]. She sang with the company for the next five years and performed many of the principal soprano parts of the Russian repertory as well as Sieglinde, Marguerite in ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'', Elisabeth de Valois, and [[Aida]]. The revolution having broken out, she was ordered to join other singers on obligatory tours to factories and farms to entertain the workers and there met the bass [[Fyodor Chaliapin]].

==To Berlin==
In 1921 she fled from Russia to [[Berlin]] where she was soon invited to sing. Success there brought a call from [[Diaghilev]] to join him in [[Paris]] to star in the premiere of [[Stravinsky]]'s opera ''[[Mavra]]'' in 1922. Chaliapin then invited her to be principal soprano in the company he was forming to tour [[Western Europe]] and she sang with him in Paris.

==To America==
The impresario [[Rabinoff]] organised for her to tour [[United States|America]] as star soloist with The [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] Chorus and while there she made a successful solo debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City|New York]]. But, as a displaced Russian living abroad when appreciation of the Russian repertoire was minimal, Slobodskaya had difficulty finding a good manager. To augment her classical career, she created a parallel identity in [[vaudeville]], singing operatic [[aria]]s and good quality [[ballad]]s under the pseudonym "Odali Careno". She remained in the USA for nearly seven years.

==To England==
In 1930 she was booked, as Odali Careno, for two weeks at the [[London Palladium]]. Always performing to her own exacting standards, she had a great success, was immediately re-engaged, and was later twice invited to star in [[Royal Command Performance]]s before [[King George V]] and [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. She also re-establlshed her classical career, appearing at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum]] with Chaliapin as Natasha in [[Alexander Dargomyzhsky|Alexander Dargomïzhsky's]] ''[[Rusalka (Dargomyzhsky)|Rusalka]]''. In 1932, following her marriage to Captain Raymond Pelly, England became her permanent home.

==Covent Garden debut==
The same year (1932) she made her [[Royal Opera House|Covent Garden]] debut as Fevronia in a concert performance of [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s ''Legend of the Invisible City of Kitezh'', and as Venus in ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhauser]]'' with [[Sir Thomas Beecham]]. She again sang Fevroniya, in [[Italian language|Italian]], at [[La Scala]], [[Milan]] in 1933, and sang Palmyra in Thomas Beecham's production of [[Frederick Delius]]'s ''Koanga'' at Covent Garden in 1935. In 1936 she took part in a Russian season at the [[Teatro Colón]], [[Buenos Aires]] and sang Khivrya in [[Modest Moussorgsky]]'s ''Fair at Sorochintsï'' at the Savoy and on an English tour in 1941 and subsequent years.

==Work for the BBC==
Throughout the 1930s she was much in demand by the [[BBC]] for concert performances of opera (notably as the heroine of [[Dmitry Shostakovich]]'s ''Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District'') and for recitals of Russian song. A regular performer in the [[The Proms|Promenade concerts]], she also recorded Russian art songs including many by pianist/composer [[Nikolai Medtner|Nicolas Medtner]]. There followed wartime entertainment work and participation in the [[National Gallery]] Concerts of [[Myra Hess]].

==Records==
After the war, during which her husband had died, Slobodskaya's career was much reduced, though she  made her only [[movie]] appearance as a Prima Donna in the 1951 film ''[[The Magic Box]]''. She rekindled her concert career with some highly acclaimed recitals in the [[Wigmore Hall]]. Saga records "rediscovered" her in the late 1950s and released two [[LP record]]s. These records prompted [[Decca Records|Decca]] to recall that they had several unissued Slobodskaya recordings from 1939-1945 which included the definitive performance of "Tatiana's letter Scene" from ''[[Eugene Onegin (opera)|Eugene Onegin]]''. These were released in 1961 together with some newly recorded items. The Shostakovitch ''Six Spanish Songs'', [[Kabalevsky]] ''Seven Nursery Rhymes'', a fine set of Polish songs and an LP of classical Russian art and folk songs also followed.
In 1974 SAGA released a record (numbered SAGA 5357) on which Slobodskaya sings songs by Mussorgsky, accompanied on piano by Ivor Newton.

==Tributes==
Slobodskaya had a voice of immense purity, steadiness, agility and expressiveness with an almost incandescent quality above the stave. As a recitalist, she possessed the imagination and vivid temperament to convey to an audience ignorant of Russian the precise mood of each song, whether elegiac, boisterous, satirical or childlike. As her many recordings reveal, these rare interpretative powers were matched by a beautiful and ample voice of characteristically [[Slavic peoples|Slavonic]] colour and by a technical mastery which showed itself especially in supple and sustained [[legato]] phrasing. She retained her vocal and interpretative powers to an advanced age.

Slobodskaya had a rich, strongly accented speaking voice and a characterful turn of phrase, and liked to give spoken introductions to her songs. This led to one of her last, great successes, in the speaking role of Narrator in "[[Peter and the Wolf]]", recording date unknown and released on Fidelio records in 1964 with the Colonne Concerts Orchestra under Isaie Disenhaus.

She was a much admired Professor of Singing at the [[Royal College of Music]] and the [[Guildhall School of Music]], where her pupils included sopranos [[Patricia Reakes]] and [[Yvonne Fuller]] and [[contralto]]s [[Anne Collins (opera singer)|Anne Collins]] and [[Annette Thompson]], and, until her very last year, continued to give recitals of Russian song.  She died in London, aged 81, on 30 July 1970.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5568">'''Overlearning''' refers to practicing newly acquired skills beyond the point of initial mastery.  The term is also often used to refer to the [[pedagogy|pedagogical]] theory that this form of practice leads to [[automaticity]] or other beneficial consequences.

== Early studies ==
[[Memory]] researcher [[Herman Ebbinghaus]] performed classical overlearning studies in the late 1890s.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;{{cite book|last=Murphy|first=Gardner|title=An Historical Introduction to Modern Psychology|year=1929|publisher=International Library of Psychology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGs04j1ypooC&amp;pg=PA445&amp;lpg=PA445&amp;dq=murphy+ebbinghaus+historical+introduction+to+modern+psychology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jBNvVC9PuS&amp;sig=GI2yi_uuujOnG2KZufiSb18iSs8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3iKRUcLMMpSQ8wSu4YGAAg&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=murphy%20ebbinghaus%20historical%20introduction%20to%20modern%20psychology&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He noticed that memory for learned material decreased over time (see also [[forgetting curve]]). Ebbinghaus recognized that lists of nonsense syllables became more difficult to recall over time, and some lists required more review time to regain 100% recall. He defined '''overlearning''' as the number of repetitions of material after that material can be 100% recalled.&lt;ref name=Murphy /&gt;

== Contemporary work ==
A 1992 [[meta-analysis]] suggested that overlearning does significantly affect recall over time. It also concluded that the size of this effect may be moderated by the amount of overlearning, task type, and length of retention.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last=Driskell|first=James E.|author2=Willis, R. P. |author3=Copper, C. |title=Effect of Overlearning on Retention|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|year=1992|volume=77|issue=5|pages=615–622|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.77.5.615}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meta-analysis included 15 studies. These 15 studies tested overlearning effects on physical and cognitive tasks. Both types of task showed an effect of overlearning. The effect size for physical tasks was smaller than the effect size for cognitive tasks.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt; The amount of overlearning affected retention: more overlearning led to more retention on both types of task.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;  The length of the retention interval also affected overlearning, but the effects were different for physical and cognitive tasks. Whereas participants overlearning physical tasks increased in ability during the retention interval, participants who overlearned cognitive tasks decreased in recall ability over time.&lt;ref name="Driskel et al." /&gt;

Some recent studies explicitly examined the interaction of overlearning with retention interval, and concluded that the effects of overlearning tend to be fairly short-lived.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K.|title=The Effects of Overlearning and Distributed Practise on the Retention of Mathematics Knowledge|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2006|volume=20|pages=1209–1224|doi=10.1002/acp.1266}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrer|first=Doug|author2=Taylor, K. |author3=Pashler, H. |author4=Wixted, J. T. |author5=Cepeda, N. J. |title=The Effect of Overlearning on Long-Term Retention|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=19|pages=361–374|doi=10.1002/acp.1083}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overlearning may be more useful in instances when learners only need short-term retention of the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning geography facts and word definitions ===
In one study, researchers examined the effects of overlearning [[geography]] facts or word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt;  After one week, overlearners recalled more geography facts and word definitions than non-overlearners, but this improvement gradually disappeared after the study.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004"/&gt; This research suggests that overlearning may be an inefficient study method for long-term retention of geography facts and word definitions.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt; Overlearning improves short-term retention of material, but learners must also spend more time studying. Over time the improvements created by overlearning fade, and the learner is no better off than someone who did not spend time overlearning the material.&lt;ref name="Rohrer et al. 2004" /&gt;

=== Overlearning mathematics ===
In another study, researchers compared the effects of overlearning and distributed practice on [[mathematics]] knowledge.&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt; Distributed practice refers to practice that is spaced over time. In Experiment 1, participants completed 10 math problems either all at once or distributed across two sessions. Participants in the distributed practice condition performed no differently from participants in the single-session condition one week later, but distributed practice participants did perform better than single-session participants four weeks later. In Experiment 2, participants completed either three or nine practice problems in one sitting. When participants were retested one or four weeks later, no differences were found between three-problem and nine-problem participants. Researchers found no effect of overlearning on mathematics [[Recall (memory)|retention]].&lt;ref name="Rohrer &amp; Taylor"/&gt;

'''Precious Blood Secondary School''', Riruta is located in [[Kawangware]], [[Dagoretti]] constituency in [[Nairobi county]], Kenya. It is about 7&amp;nbsp;km to the West from the city center. It has a population of about 600 students drawn from every corner of the country. The school has three streams in every form. It is sited on a ten-acre plot and consists of class rooms, hostels, dining hall, a small field for sport, teachers' quarters, laboratories and staff rooms.

The Catholic nuns of the order of Precious Blood Sisters established the school in 1964. Its enrollment was meant for children of indigenous from the immediate vicinity of Kawangware, Riruta and Uthiru who had been affected by the Mau-Mau struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.preciousbloodriruta.com/content.php?pid=1 |title=Precious Blood Secondary School::Home |publisher=Preciousbloodriruta.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a public school run by the Kenyan Government, The Precious Blood Sisters, Board of Governors and The PTA.
The school started as a single stream school but today it has three streams. The students are about 580. Initially it was not a boarding school but with the increasing numbers it was expanded and dormitories were made.

'''Rita Frances Dove''' (born August 28, 1952) is an [[United States|American]] poet and essayist. From 1993 to 1995, she served as [[United States Poet Laureate|Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]]. She is the first [[African-American]] to have been appointed since the position was created by an act of Congress in 1986 from the previous "consultant in poetry" position (1937–86). Dove also received an appointment as "special consultant in poetry" for the Library of Congress's bicentennial year from 1999 to 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=1850|title=Rita Dove|date=14 March 2018|website=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove is the second African American to receive the [[Pulitzer Prize for Poetry]], in 1987, and she served as the [[Poet Laureate of Virginia]]&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; from 2004 to 2006.

==Early life==
Rita Dove was born in [[Akron, Ohio]], to Ray Dove, one of the first African-American chemists to work in the U.S. tire industry (as research chemist at [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]]), and Elvira Hord, who achieved honors in high school and would share her passion for reading with her daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Rita Dove | title=Comprehensive Biography of Rita Dove | url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rfd4b/compbio.html | publisher=University of Virginia | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, Dove graduated from [[Buchtel High School]] as a [[Presidential Scholar]]. Later, Dove graduated ''summa cum laude'' with a B.A. from [[Miami University]] in 1973. In 1974, she held a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] from [[Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen]], Germany. She received her MFA from the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]] at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1977.

Dove taught creative writing at Arizona State University from 1981 to 1989. She received the 1987 Pulitzer Prize in poetry. In 1992, she was named [[United States Poet Laureate]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/dove/, Library of Congress Online resources], with links to works, commentary and recorded works.&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Librarian of Congress]], an office she held from 1993 to 1995. At age 40, Dove was the youngest person to hold the position and is the first [[African American]] to hold the position since the title was changed to Poet Laureate ([[Robert Hayden]] had served as the first non-white Consultant in Poetry from 1976 to 1978, and [[Gwendolyn Brooks]] had been the last Consultant in Poetry in 1985–86). Early in her tenure as poet laureate, Dove was featured by [[Bill Moyers]] in a one-hour interview on his [[PBS]] prime-time program ''[[Bill Moyers Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/content/poet-laureate-rita-dove/|title=Poet Laureate Rita Dove - BillMoyers.com|publisher=|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1989, she has been teaching at the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]], where she holds the chair of Commonwealth Professor of English.

Rita Dove also served as a Special Bicentennial [[Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress]] in 1999/2000, along with [[Louise Glück]] and [[W. S. Merwin]]. In 2004, then-governor [[Mark Warner]] of [[Virginia]] appointed her to a two-year position as [[Poet Laureate of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="test"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/virginia.html|title=Virginia - State Poet Laureate (State Poets Laureate of the United States, Main Reading Room, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her public posts, Dove concentrated on spreading the word about poetry and increasing public awareness of the benefits of literature. As [[United States Poet Laureate]], for example, she brought together writers to explore the African diaspora through the eyes of its artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/poetslaureate/faq.html|title=Frequently Asked Questions: United States Poets Laureate - Library of Congress Bibliographies, Research Guides,and Finding Aids (Virtual Programs&amp;Services, Library of Congress)|website=www.loc.gov|accessdate=15 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove was on the board of the [[Associated Writing Programs]] (AWP) (now "Association of Writers and Writing Programs") from 1985 to 1988. She led the organization as its president from 1986 to 1987. From 1994 to 2000, she was a senator (member of the governing board) of the national academic honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. From 2006 to 2012, she served as a chancellor of the [[Academy of American Poets]]. Since 1991, she has been on the jury of the annual [[Anisfield-Wolf Book Award]]s—from 1991 to 1996 serving together with [[Ashley Montagu]] and [[Henry Louis Gates]]; and since 1997 with Gates, [[Joyce Carol Oates]], [[Simon Schama]], [[Stephen Jay Gould]] (until his death in 2002) and [[Steven Pinker]] (who replaced Gould in 2002).

In the spring of 2018, Dove was named poetry editor of [[The New York Times Magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;Fitzgerald, Brendan (2018-05-25). [https://www.cjr.org/united_states_project/nyt-magazine-rita-dove-poetry-editor.php/ "''NYT Magazine''’s Rita Dove on What Poetry Might Grant Unsuspecting News Readers."]  ''Columbia Journalism Review'' (CJR.org).  Retrieved 2018-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove's work cannot be confined to a specific era or school in contemporary literature; her wide-ranging topics and the precise poetic language with which she captures complex emotions defy easy categorization. Her most famous work to date is ''Thomas and Beulah'', published by [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] Press in 1986, a collection of poems loosely based on the lives of her maternal grandparents, for which she received the Pulitzer Prize in 1987. Dove has published ten volumes of poetry, a book of short stories (''Fifth Sunday'', 1985), a collection of essays (''The Poet's World'', 1995), and a novel, ''Through the Ivory Gate'' (1992). Her ''Collected Poems 1974-2004'' was released by [[W.W. Norton]] in 2016; it carries an excerpt from [[President Barack Obama]]'s 2011 [[National Medal of Arts]] commendation on its back cover.

In 1994, she published the play ''The Darker Face of the Earth'' (revised stage version 1996), which premiered at the [[Oregon Shakespeare Festival]] in [[Ashland, Oregon]] in 1996 (first European production: [[Royal National Theatre]], London, 1999). She collaborated with composer [[John Williams]] on the song cycle ''Seven for Luck'' (first performance: [[Boston Symphony]], [[Tanglewood]], 1998, conducted by the composer). For "America's Millennium", the [[White House]]'s 1999/2000 New Year's celebration, Ms. Dove contributed — in a live reading at the [[Lincoln Memorial]], accompanied by [[John Williams]]' music — a poem to Steven Spielberg's documentary ''The Unfinished Journey''.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|fCFhBhAbqgQ|Rita Dove reading at "America's Millennium"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove's most ambitious collection of poetry, ''Sonata Mulattica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=May |first=Lori A. |url=http://www.poetsquarterly.com/2013/07/sonata-mulattica-rita-doves-juggling-act.html |title=Poets' Quarterly: Sonata Mulattica: Rita Dove's Juggling Act |publisher=Poetsquarterly.com |date=2013-07-11 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 2009. Over its more than 200 pages, it "has the sweep and vivid characters of a novel", as [[Mark Doty]] wrote in ''[[O, The Oprah Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Sonata-Mulattica-by-Rita-Dove-Book-Review Mark Doty, "The Silenced Violin", ''O, The Oprah Magazine'', April 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dove edited ''The Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry'', published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jeffrey |last=Brown |title=In Anthology, Rita Dove Connects American Poets' Intergenerational Conversations |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/entertainment/july-dec11/ritadove_12-16.html |work=PBS NewsHour |publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Jo |last=Brooks |title=Friday on the NewsHour: Rita Dove |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2011/12/friday-on-the-newshour-rita-dove.html |publisher=MacNeil/Lehrer Productions |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2011-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection provoked heated controversy as some critics complained that she valued an inclusive, populist agenda over quality. Poet [[John Olson (poet and writer)|John Olson]] commented that "her exclusions are breathtaking". Well-known poets left out include [[Sylvia Plath]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Sterling Allen Brown|Sterling Brown]], [[Louis Zukofsky]], [[George Oppen]], [[Charles Reznikoff]] and [[Lorine Niedecker]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/22/poetry-anthology-race-row?INTCMP=SRCH "Poetry anthology sparks race row"], ''Guardian'' 22 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Dove explained in her foreword and in media interviews, she had originally selected works by Plath, Ginsberg and Brown but these as well as some other poets were left out against her editorial wishes; their contributions had to be removed from print-ready copy at the very last minute because their publisher forbade their inclusion due to a disagreement with Penguin over permission fees. Critic [[Helen Vendler]] condemned Dove's choices, asking "why are we being asked to sample so many poets of little or no lasting value?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Helen |last=Vendler | title=Are These the Poems to Remember?|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/nov/24/are-these-poems-remember/| work=The New York Review of Books| date=November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dove defended her choices and omissions vigorously in her response to Vendler in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rita |last=Dove | title=Defending An Anthology|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2011/dec/22/defending-anthology/| work=The New York Review of Books| date=December 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in wide-ranging interviews with ''[[The Writer's Chronicle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Editing the Penguin Anthology of 20th Century American Poetry: An Interview with Rita Dove|url=http://people.virginia.edu/~rfd4b/interviews/2011/writers-chronicle-interview-dec%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; with poet Jericho Brown on the Best American Poetry website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Until the Fulcrum Tips: A Conversation with Rita Dove and Jericho Brown|url=http://blog.bestamericanpoetry.com/the_best_american_poetry/2011/12/until-the-fulcrum-tips-a-conversation-with-rita-dove-and-jericho-brown.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Bill Moyers]] on his public television show ''[[Moyers &amp; Company]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Rita Dove on the Power of Poetry|url=http://billmoyers.com/segment/rita-dove-on-the-power-of-poetry/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Boston Review]]'' continued the discussion from different angles with an aggressive attack by scholar Marjorie Perloff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/poetry/marjorie-perloff-poetry-lyric-reinvention |title=Poetry on the Brink |publisher=Boston Review |date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a spirited counter-attack by poet and scholar [[Evie Shockley]], who took on both Vendler and Perloff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonreview.net/poetry/shifting-imbalance |title=Shifting the (Im)balance |publisher=Boston Review |date=2013-06-06 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:USNA cheerleaders.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cheerleaders]] are an important{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} part of the expression of school spirit.]]

'''School spirit''' is the sense of identity and community shared by members of an [[educational institution]]. This can apply to any type of school, from [[elementary school]]s to [[University|universities]]. Members of a school can manifest spirit in the exhibition of [[school colors]] in dress and decoration, in attendance at athletic events, or verbally in the form of chants or cheers.

Educators in primary and secondary education often associate proper behavior with school spirit, especially in the context of situations when students are outside the school itself. Because student behavior reflects on the school, representing it well shows a degree of student investment in their institution's good name. This definition of school spirit is closely associated with good [[sportsmanship]] among students and their families at sporting events and is loosely based upon encouraging each other.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Pep rallies==
In the United States, an event closely associated with school spirit called a [[pep rally]] is held during or after school hours. Seasonal sports teams are usually recognized. These are held generally before a varsity-level sports game. Other participants are [[JROTC]], [[Cheerleaders]] and [[marching band]] or [[pep band]].

'''Urimia University of Technology''' was formed and started to work in summer 2007. Following the principled agreement of UUT establishment and with the special consideration of president Dr. Ahmadinejad and the officials attempts, an independent funding (budget) based on [[Iran]] government proposal and the [[Islamic Consultative Assembly|Islamic parliament]] approval was allocated to the university. Obtaining educational and research activities permission in [[Information Technology]] (IT), Mechanical, and [[Industrial engineering]], UUT officially started in February, 2007.

The '''Valley View University''' is a [[private university]] located in Oyibi, [[Accra]] in the [[Greater Accra Region]] of [[Ghana]]. It forms part of a worldwide system of over 100 tertiary institutions operated by the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]].&lt;ref name="accreditation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://education.gc.adventist.org/documents/accreditationstatus..pdf |title=POST-SECONDARY INSTITUTIONS ACCREDITATION STATUS |accessdate=2007-03-14 |format=PDF |work=Department of Education Accreditation Status List Page 3 |publisher=Seventh Day Adventist Church |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221142904/http://education.gc.adventist.org/documents/accreditationstatus..pdf |archivedate = 21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Valley View University was established in 1979 by the West African Union Mission of Seventh-day Adventists (now Ghana Union Conference). In 1997 it was absorbed into the Adventist university system operated by the [[West-Central Africa Division of Seventh-day Adventists|West-Central Africa Division (WAD)]] with headquarters in [[Abidjan]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]]. The Ghana Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists (organized in 2000) serves as the local manager of the university.
 
The university began as the Adventist Missionary College and was located in Bekwai-Ashanti. It was transferred to Adentan near [[Accra]] in 1983 where it operated in rented facilities until it was relocated to its present site near Oyibi (19 miles down Accra-Dodowa Road). In 1989 and was renamed Valley View College.
 
The [[Adventist Accrediting Association]] (AAA) has, since 1983, been evaluating and reviewing the [[accreditation]] status of the institution. In 1995, the university was affiliated to [[Griggs University]] in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]], USA. This allowed the university to offer four year bachelor's degrees in Theology and Religious Studies. The National Accreditation Board (Ghana) granted it national accreditation in 1995 thus allowing the university to award her own degrees. Thus, Valley View University became the first private institution in Ghana to be granted national accreditation.
 
Valley View University has the singular distinction of being the first private university in [[Ghana]] to be granted a Charter. Valley View University received its Charter from President [[John Kufuor]] (President of Ghana), at a special function on 28 May 2006. A “Chartered” institution implies one that has been granted certain rights and privileges by the president or the legislature of [[Ghana]]. To obtain this legal status, the institute's statutes, examination procedures and quality assurance standards are subjected to parliamentary scrutiny.

==Accreditation==
Valley View University is accredited by the Accrediting Association of Adventist Schools, Colleges and Universities. Valley View University is therefore a member of a network of over 100 colleges and universities operated by the Seventh-day Adventist Church worldwide. The university is also accredited by the [[National Accreditation Board (Ghana)|National Accreditation Board]] of the Government of Ghana for the various programmes leading to a certificates, diploma and degrees in many disciplines and specialization

The '''University of Applied Sciences''' (UAS), as is generally known '''Vocational University''', or called Professional University, Applied Technological University, College of Higher Vocational Studies, is an institution of [[higher education]] and sometimes [[research]], which provides both [[tertiary education|tertiary]] and sometimes [[quaternary education]] and grants [[academic degree]]s at all levels ([[bachelor degree|bachelor]], [[master degree|master]], and sometimes [[doctorate degree|doctorate]]) in a variety of subjects.

In some countries, a vocational university more precisely grants [[professional degree]]s like professional bachelor's degree, Professional master's degree and Professional doctorates. The term is not officially used in many countries and an assignment to a certain type of university in a certain country's educational system is therefore difficult.  The UK once had a very extensive vocational university sector with its polytechnic system dating back to the mid 19th century.  Vocational universities are often regulated and funded differently (for example, by the local government rather than the state) from research-focused universities, and the degrees granted are not necessarily interchangeable.

==Education==
The education at vocational universities combines teaching of both practical skills and theoretical expertise. It can be contrasted with education in a usually broader [[science|scientific]] field, which may concentrate on [[theory]] and abstract [[concept]]ual knowledge. There is also the historical background that an educational institution was called a [[medieval university|university]] in the [[Middle Ages]] only if a certain classical [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of subjects was taught (typically including [[philosophy]], [[medicine]] and [[theology]]). In modern times, other subjects, namely [[natural science|natural]] and [[engineering]] sciences, became more important, but institutions of [[tertiary education]] focusing on these subjects and not offering the classical canon have until recently or are still denied the prestigious denomination "university" in all countries. They had to use other, more general terms (which in many languages are [[false friend]]s of the English term "high school", sometimes with modifiers), including ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' in [[German language|German]], ''Haute École'' in [[French language|French]] ([[Belgium]] and [[Switzerland]]), ''Hogeschool'' in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], ''Høyskole'' in [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], ''Scuola universitaria professionale'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], etc.

There are different varieties, including vocational universities of applied sciences (also named [[institute of technology|polytechnic]]s or institutes of technology), vocational universities of liberal arts, etc. In recent years, many vocational universities have received full university status, such as the [[University of Music and Performing Arts, Vienna]], [[Austria]] (Universität für Musik und darstellende Kunst Wien, formerly Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Wien), or the [[Örebro University]], [[Sweden]] (formerly Örebro Högskola). There are also some establishments which now have full university status but continue to use their former names, such as the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]].

==Vocational universities in Europe==

===Austria ===
{{Main|Fachhochschule}}
===Finland===
*[[Ammattikorkeakoulu]] (Yrkeshögskola in Swedish, translated ''University of Applied Sciences'', literally "vocational high school"). Do not grant [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] or [[doctorate]] degrees.

Notice: certain universities are called ''korkeakoulu'' because they effectively have only one faculty, e.g. ''Teatterikorkeakoulu'', the Theatre Academy, whereas universities with several faculties are called ''yliopisto''. The term ''ammattikorkeakoulu'' (AMK) creates some confusion with ''korkeakoulu'', because traditionally AMK's were not considered universities. A graduate of university of applied sciences (''ammattikorkeakoulu'') is generally not eligible for doctoral studies in Finnish universities without formally completing a master's degree from a university (''yliopisto'').

===Germany===
{{Main|Fachhochschule}}
The term vocational university is not used. In contrast to traditional German universities, a ''[[Fachhochschule]]'' (translated ''University of Applied Sciences'') has a more practical profile. Universities of Applied Sciences grant [[Bachelor degree]]s and [[Master degree]]s. Some Universities of Applied Sciences run doctoral programs where the degree itself is awarded by a partner institution. Furthermore, ''Berufsakademie'' is a college type strongly inspired by the [[dual education system]]. A ''Berufsakademie'' is called a ''university of cooperative education'' in English and only grants bachelor's degrees. This type of institution was first created in the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]] and now exists in [[Hamburg]], [[Hesse]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Saarland]], [[Saxony]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], and [[Thuringia]], but not in the other German states. In 2009, Baden-Württemberg transformed its Berufsakademie into a new type of institution, which until now only exists in that state, a "Duale Hochschule". In English, this type of institution is also called ''university of cooperative education'', but a Duale Hochschule also offers master's degrees.

===Greece===
{{main|List of universities in Greece#Technological educational institutes / Universities of Applied Sciences}}
In Greece, comparable institutions to the Vocational Universities (or perhaps better to the Universities of Applied Sciences) are the Technological Educational Institutes (TEIs). These constitute part and parcel of the  Higher Education in Greece and offer in their own capacity bachelor's and master's degrees, and soon Doctorate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.esos.gr/arthra/49939/didaktorika-apo-tei-i-epistoli-toy-yp-paideias-pros-toys-proedroys-ton-tei|title=Διδακτορικά από ΤΕΙ- Η επιστολή του υπ. Παιδείας προς τους προέδρους των ΤΕΙ|author=|date=9 April 2017|website=esos.gr}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

On the other hand, the term [[College]] in Greece may refer, among others, to the institutions that are officially titled Centres of Post-lyceum(secondary) Education. These have a solely professional, i.e. non-academic, orientation according to existing Greek law, and are so far only private. However, they run in collaboration with foreign authorities, such as universities and accreditation organisations, that may recognise them academically. They may offer [[professional]] bachelor degrees of minimum three years, as well as master and doctorate degrees.

===Netherlands===
{{main|List of universities in the Netherlands}}
As of January 29, 2008, a Dutch ''hogeschool'' '''(HBO)''' may call itself a "University of Applied Sciences" in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffic.nl/nederlandse-organisaties/nieuws-evenementen/nieuws-archief/nieuws-archief-2008/februari/engelstalige-naam-voor-nederlandse-hogescholen |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110815002132/http://www.nuffic.nl/nederlandse-organisaties/nieuws-evenementen/nieuws-archief/nieuws-archief-2008/februari/engelstalige-naam-voor-nederlandse-hogescholen |archivedate=2011-08-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universities of Applied Sciences offer [[bachelor's degrees]] and [[master's degrees]], but no doctorates.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/stcrt-2013-35337.html|title=Regeling van de Minister van Onderwijs, Cultuur en Wetenschap van 11 december 2013, nr. 528477, houdende een wijziging van de Regeling andere toevoeging aan wo-graden in verband met het vaststellen van de referentielijst internationale herkenbaarheid titulatuur hoger beroepsonderwijs en het vaststellen van graden met toevoegingen|first=Ministerie van Onderwijs, Cultuur en|last=Wetenschap|date=|website=zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1 January 2014 there is no longer a distinction between the bachelor's and master's degrees awarded by the Dutch research universities (Dutch "universiteiten") and the Dutch Universities of Applied Sciences (Dutch "hogescholen"), therefore graduates from Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands will obtain a Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science (BSc), Master of Science (MSc) or an equivalent academic title corresponding to their specific field of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rijksoverheid.nl/onderwerpen/hoger-onderwijs/vraag-en-antwoord/welke-titel-mag-ik-voeren-als-ik-ben-afgestudeerd-of-gepromoveerd.html|title=Welke titel mag ik voeren als ik ben afgestudeerd of gepromoveerd aan universiteit of hogeschool?|first=Ministerie van Algemene|last=Zaken|date=|website=www.rijksoverheid.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''Hogescholen'' in the Netherlands have been provided with the right to conduct research by the revised Higher Education and Research Act (WHOO)2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.innovationinbusiness.research.hu.nl/Onderzoek.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406145037/http://www.innovationinbusiness.research.hu.nl/Onderzoek.aspx |archive-date=2013-04-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
The main difference between universities (universitet) and vocational universities (högskola, official translation ''university college'') is that only the former ones have the right to award doctorate degrees in all subjects they offer. Some vocational universities have been given such rights within limited areas of research.

The '''Warwick Manufacturing Group''' (today known as '''WMG''') is an academic department at the [[University of Warwick]], providing research, education and knowledge transfer in engineering, manufacturing and technology. The group provides taught and research degrees for [[postgraduate]] students at the University of Warwick campus in England, and at overseas centres in [[China]], [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], [[Cyprus]], [[Russia]] and [[Thailand]].

==History==
The Warwick Manufacturing Group was founded in 1980 by [[Kumar Bhattacharyya, Baron Bhattacharyya|Kumar Bhattacharyya]] to support the reinvigoration of UK manufacturing through research and knowledge transfer (Bhattacharyya, made a [[life peer]] in 2004, remains chairman of WMG). Its first venture was a part-time master's degree for senior industry staff; this considered technology and management as a unified whole, with modules taught at a purpose-built residential centre.&lt;ref name=THEJump&gt;{{cite news|last=Jump|first=Paul|title=Where research shares the driver's seat with industry|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/414726.article|accessdate=10 December 2013|newspaper=Times Higher Education|date=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the course was initially criticised by academics, it proved popular with industry and companies began to send staff to WMG in greater numbers.

Bhattacharyya then decided to provide industry-related research services too,&lt;ref name=THEJump /&gt; convincing the university to loan money for a centre where academics could collaborate with industrialists on the development of new products for the aerospace and automotive industries. The advanced technology centre was officially opened on 8 January 1990 by [[Margaret Thatcher]]&lt;ref name=Highbeam&gt;{{cite web|title=Prime Minister opens technology centre; Freeze Frame January 8, 1990.(Features)|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-169006937.html|work=Birmingham Post,|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its success (and the income generated) allowed WMG to build two further buildings to enable expansion into other areas, including healthcare, construction, pharmaceuticals, mining, information technology and food and drink where learning from the manufacturing industry could be applied to similar processes and services.&lt;ref name=THEJump /&gt;  

This success has led several subsequent British Prime Ministers to visit WMG to demonstrate their support for WMGs innovation and applied research. [[Tony Blair]] visited WMG during the 1997 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/ne1000000081579/|title=Tony Blair visits University of Warwick|last=|first=|date=10 April 1997|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;and 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.co.uk/detail/news-photo/british-prime-minister-tony-blair-arrives-at-warwick-news-photo/830594326#british-prime-minister-tony-blair-arrives-at-warwick-university-on-picture-id830594326|title=Tony Blair Arrives at Warwick|last=|first=|date=May 10, 2001|website=Getty Images|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Election Campaigns. [[Gordon Brown]] laid the foundation stone of WMG's Digital Laboratory shortly before becoming Prime Minister &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/mediacentre/wmgnews/gordon_brown_unveils/|title=Gordon Brown unveils foundation stone of Warwick Digital Lab|last=|first=|date=20 May 2007|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that "WMG’s work is based on very strong collaboration with industry and provides a prime example of how the knowledge created in our universities can be transferred to make a difference in the real world"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/gordon_brown_unveils/|title=Gordon Brown unveils Digital Lab foundation stone|last=|first=|date=|website=University of Warwick|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

[[Theresa May]] and her Chancellor [[Philip Hammond]] visited WMG together in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/mediacentre/wmgnews/?newsItem=094d434556d003050156e63de7224e32|title=Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer visit WMG|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. May's visit was later credited with inspiring the Prime Minister to support a British Industrial strategy by the [[Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy|Business Secretary]], [[Greg Clark]]. Clark stated that "''Kumar'' ([[Kumar Bhattacharyya, Baron Bhattacharyya|Lord Bhattacharyya]], chairman of WMG) ''created this, all those connections, all of those links between education and jobs and technology. During all the time I’ve known Lord Bhattacharyya he’s been a big champion for the West Midlands. One of Theresa May’s first visits as Prime Minister was here and she saw for herself what is possible. As a result, I think the industrial strategy has taken such a prominent position in the post-Brexit plan''".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/government-wants-coventry-jaguar-land-12952360|title=Government wants Coventry &amp; JLR at heart of global car industry|last=Gilbert|first=Simon|date=2017-04-28|work=coventrytelegraph|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the group rebranded as WMG (instead of Warwick Manufacturing Group) to reflect its move to more diverse activities outside its manufacturing roots.

WMG is based in six buildings on the University of Warwick campus:
* International Automotive Research Centre
* International Manufacturing Centre
* Engineering Management Building (Westwood campus)
* International Digital Laboratory (completed 2008)&lt;ref name=MADE&gt;{{cite web|title=International Digital Laboratory|url=http://www.made.org.uk/images/uploads/International_digital_laboratory_new.pdf|publisher=MADE|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* International Institute for Product and Service Innovation (completed in 2012)&lt;ref name=IIPSI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/news/intnews2/iipsi/|title=International Institute for Product and Service Innovation|publisher=University of Warwick|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* International Institute for Nanocomposites Manufacturing (completed in 2014)&lt;ref name=IINM&gt;{{cite web|title=International Institute for Nanocomposites Manufacturing|url=http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/wmg/research/multifunctional_systems/iinm|publisher=University of Warwick|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is leading the construction of the new [[National Automotive Innovation Centre]] on the University campus.

WMG has strong links in China, where WMG has been engaged since the 1980s, and in India, where it helped establish a technical university.&lt;ref name=THEJump /&gt;

In 2011, WMG accounted for 30 percent of the university's research activity and had over 2,500 postgraduate students, 650 studying full-time at Warwick. Just 20 of 450 staff and 10 percent of its £120 million annual research budget was funded by the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]].&lt;ref name=THEJump /&gt;
