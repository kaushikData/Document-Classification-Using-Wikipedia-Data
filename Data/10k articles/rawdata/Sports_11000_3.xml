== Competition Report==
Offering a record £1,000 first prize the 1948 Derby attracted the [[Scottish Greyhound Derby]] champion Western Post. Paddy Moclair his original owner would train the greyhound for the duration of the competition for Londoner Frank Davis. Moclair had paid £240 for him at Limerick sales before Davis then bought the dog from Moclair and Anthony Watson for £2,000.
The fawn and white dog wrote himself into the record books by becoming the first winner of the Scottish and Irish Derby.  Despite the reputation of Western Post, the hot favourite throughout the event had been Harvest King owned and trained by Harry O’Neill.&lt;ref name=IGD&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Michael|title=Irish Greyhound Derby 1932–1981|publisher=Victory Irish Promotions Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MF&gt;{{cite book|last=Fortune|first=Michael|title=The 75 Years History of the Irish Greyhound Derby|publisher=Irish Greyhound Review|issn=0709-0609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harvest King from [[Arklow]] had impressed during the early rounds including a victory over Western Post and before the semi finals began he had been sold to Harry O'Neill for £4,000. In the final Harvest King made a poor start and never showed leaving Western Post to overtake the early leader (a bitch called Canter Home) at the halfway mark. He went on to win easily from Baytown Colonel.&lt;ref name=MF/&gt;

'''Adidas Predator''' are a range of football boots developed by German sportswear manufacturers [[Adidas]] based on a prototype concept from the Australian former footballer [[Craig Johnston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Complete History of the adidas Predator|url=http://uk.complex.com/sneakers/2014/06/the-complete-history-of-the-adidas-predator|website=Complex|accessdate=16 January 2016|date=4 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tht"&gt;{{cite web|last=Castelino|first=Keith|title=Craig Johnston — The Inventor Who Became A Footballer|url=http://www.thehardtackle.com/2013/craig-johnston-inventor-who-became-footballer/|work=The Hard Tackle|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The common feature of the Predator range is the presence of rubber patches or strips on the top of the shoe, designed to increase friction between the boot and the ball. In late 2010, Adidas designed the new "Power-spine" technology, which they claim improves shot power by reducing the amount the foot bends back as it kicks the ball.

In 2014, [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] inventor László Oroszi won a court case against Adidas in relation to the ''Predator Precision'' range, forcing Adidas to pay royalties on that range of the boot.

The Predator line was discontinued in May 2015 for football but was brought back in late 2017 to replace the ACE boots whereas the rugby line is still going strong. The new elite level predator brought back by adidas is named the Predator 18+, which features a primeknit upper with a laceless design as in Ace 16+ and 17+. The boost insole which was used in the Ace 17+ was also used on the new predator. There is a laced variant which is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Football is changing and adidas is leading the way|url=http://news.adidas.com/GLOBAL/Latest-News/ALL/Football-is-changing-and-adidas-is-leading-the-way/s/75a11c61-8b9c-4400-80bf-08a58c678081|accessdate=19 May 2015|date=18 May 2015|publisher=[[Adidas]] |work=Adidas news stream}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The concept==
Footballer [[Craig Johnston]] retired from the game in 1988 to return to his native Australia to help care for his seriously injured sister.&lt;ref name="tht" /&gt;  Whilst coaching a group of schoolchildren in Australia, he came across the idea of using rubber instead of leather to build ridges on the top of a football boot to, theoretically, aid control of the ball.&lt;ref name="tht" /&gt;

Johnston spent a lot of time and money developing prototypes and experimenting with designs. Those designs were rejected by various sports  shoe manufacturers, including Adidas.&lt;ref name="tht" /&gt;  He then persuaded German footballers [[Franz Beckenbauer]], [[Karl-Heinz Rummenigge]] and [[Paul Breitner]] to be filmed whilst using his prototype football boots in snowy conditions.  This was enough to convince Adidas to take up Johnston's design, buying the rights with Johnston receiving a 2% share of all sales.&lt;ref name="tht" /&gt;

==History of the Predator models==
There have been 12 different predator models, with a cheaper version without all the predator technology going by a different name. For example, the Predator Pulse's budget variant was called the Pulsado.

The eponymous ''Predator elements'' have developed over time. The principle behind the project, however, involves attaching rubber strips to the forefoot that Adidas says increases the speed of the ball. The initial focus in Predator commercials was on shooting strength, but this gradually move more to the effect on ball spin and precision. The first Predators were also available without Predator elements under a different name. While the Predators were made of black [[kangaroo]]-leather with white stripes and red elements, the equivalent boots without Predator technology were black with white stripes and blue accents. The Precision equivalent, however, was black and white only, while the Supernova (Predator Mania without the Predator elements) was black with either silver or gold heel caps and stripes. [[David Beckham]] wore these boots for most of his career, as did [[Zinedine Zidane]].

===Original Predator===
The original Adidas Predator was made of leather. It featured rubber ridges. It only came in a few colors, black with white stripes and red accents. This color scheme is now known as the main one for all predators.  The first goal scored by a professional footballer using Predator boots in a top-level match was by [[John Collins (footballer, born 1968)|John Collins]] for [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] in April 1994.  He scored the opening goal in a 1–1 draw at [[Ibrox Stadium]] against [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]], direct from a [[Direct free kick|free-kick]] on the edge of the penalty box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sound of silence: Celtic went to Ibrox under-strength and without their fans but still snatched a point|url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/sound-of-silence-celtic-went-to-ibrox-under-strength-and-without-their-fans-but-still-snatched-a-point-1-1352126|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=Scotland on Sunday|date=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapier===
The Predator Rapiers (named this as most footballers could kick with them on) also were the first Adidas soccer boots available in different colors. Until then, Adidas soccer boots were made of black leather. The Rapier, however, was also (as a limited series) available in white and red, as were the next two models. Beginning with the Mania, Adidas started to produce its Predator boots in countless color variants. Moreover, one color was called David Beckham's style.

===Touch===
The Predator Touch was different in many ways. It featured the Traxion (trx) studs, which were rectangular and anatomically placed. Before, studs had always been round. For professional players who preferred the old studs, Adidas produced special Predators with a different outsole.

===Accelerator===
The Predator Accelerator version was released in 1998 to coincide with the FIFA world cup held in France. This boot featured a re-engineered TRX (traxion) outsole, asymmetrical lacing, fore-footed rubber vamps sewn into the leather, and a "feet you wear" insole. It has been regarded as one of the best boots Adidas have produced to date. The boot was modelled by some of the greatest players such as [[Alessandro Del Piero]], Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham.

The Adidas Predator Accelerator came out in four different colourways:
* White/black
* Black/red/White
* Red/black
* Electricity yellow (limited to a release of 999 pairs worldwide)

Two generations of this boot were produced: The '98 version can be distinguished by two red patches on the heel, whereas the '99 version does not have these red patches on the heel.

Furthermore, the same model was released in the colours of black/blue but without the "Predator" elements. This was a slightly cheaper alternative to the Predator Accelerator.  This version was simply called the Adidas Accelerator.

===Precision===
The ''Predator Precision'' introduced replaceable Traxion studs that were fitted by the tightening of a minute screw. These studs were available in various lengths that made the boot adjustable to ground conditions as is possible with the classic screw-in soft-ground studs. There were, however, some reliability problems, as the studs would come loose quite often, thus needing more constant maintenance than the classic screw-ins. In 2001 came a completely revised model which had a similar stripe configuration and colourway but the predator technology was revised and bore more of a resemblance to Predator Accelerators.

Controversy arose over the boot's ball-directing striped-line zone in 2002 when Hungarian football gear inventor László Oroszi launched a [[copyright]] lawsuit against Adidas.&lt;ref name="hung"&gt;{{cite web|title=Az Adidas lenyúlta Oroszi László találmányát|url=http://www.origo.hu/itthon/20140211-pert-nyert-egy-magyar-feltalalo-az-adidas-szal-szemben.html|work=Origo|accessdate=11 February 2014 |language=Hungarian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="xp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungarian Inventor Wins Copyright Lawsuit |url=http://www.xpatloop.com/news/hungarian_inventor_wins_copyright_lawsuit|work=XpatLoop|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=13 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oroszi had registered the patent in Hungary in 1996, explaining that the striped zone at the tip of the shoe permitted footballers to shoot more accurately.&lt;ref name="ld"&gt;{{cite web|last=Day|first=Corinne|title=Adidas liable for patent infringement in Hungary|url=http://www.lawdit.co.uk/reading-room/adidas-liable-for-patent-infringement-in-hungary|publisher=Lawdit Solicitors|accessdate=5 May 2014|date=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oroszi's representative presented the patent to Adidas in 1998, but Adidas declined the offer claiming that it did not fit into their concept for the then new ''Predator Precision'' shoes.&lt;ref name="ld" /&gt;  Eventually in 2014, the Hungarian Courts ruled that Adidas had incorporated Oroszi's deisgn into their ''Predator Precision'' shoes and that he is entitled to compensation.&lt;ref name="xp" /&gt;

===Mania===
Adidas released the ''Predator Mania'' to coincide with the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] in [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]]. They designed it with a "Far Eastern" style in mind, so it had sharp angular styling and came in various colour schemes in addition to the traditional black–red design. These included the "champagne", a champagne-white colour, and the "champagne gold", a gold pearl-like white, although just stud background and heel cup was gold. These were worn by David Beckham, Alessandro Del Piero and [[Raúl (footballer)|Raúl]]. These were available in the ''XTRX Blades'' for soft ground use, which came with a stud key and could be loosened or tightened at the owners comfort and also the red firm ground blades for hard surfaces. These were not detachable and came fixated to the boot. A limited edition version was also released in "Japan Blue" and was worn by [[Alessandro Santos|Alex]] of the [[Japan national football team|Japan national team]] during the tournament. During the 2002–03 playing season, they also released an all-red version with the Adidas stripes in silver.

Problems with reliability of the ''XTRX Blades'' meant a revised version was released in late 2003, which incorporated minor changes to the layout and design of the studs. In addition to this, with the revision, Adidas also released the boots with traditional screw in studs which were previously only available to professional players who had the boots custom designed by Adidas. Two new colours were released: "lunar", which came out in March 2003, and "gun metal", which was released in time for the 2003–04 playing season. The final revision of this boot came with the release of the HG (Hard Ground) sole, which was the same as the FG, except that the studs were black instead of red and were joined up and more robust with the boots intended to be used on third generation and synthetic surfaces. "Blue Mania" were only released in small numbers, primarily in the North American market, Japan and Korea; they are rare in Europe.

With the success of the ''Mania'' in 2002, Adidas launched a budget version of the boot called the ''Manado''. This featured all the key characteristics of the Mania boot but with small cosmetic differences. A cheaper young cow leather was used in comparison to the ''Mania'''s kangaroo skin leather. There was also a difference in the size and length of the tongues on each boot, compared to the ''Mania'' and the achillies protector on the heel was not plastic. Differences in the studs and colouring of the under sole are also evident, although the differences can be hard to notice at a glance, the ''Manados'' are often mistaken for ''Manias'' even though the recommended retail price of the ''Manados'' was £60, opposed to the £120 of the ''Manias''.

With the difference in leather and other features, the ''Predator Mania FG'' is intended as the peak of the ''Predator'' range. With the line discontinued in late 2003, the boot has long been out of stock. There has been a retro version which was released in 2017 in the champagne colorway, its limited quantities made people sell them on eBay at monstrous prices.

===Pulse===
The ''Predator''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nikef1.com/danh-muc/giay-adidas-predator|title=Giày đá bóng adidas predator}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pulse'' was introduced in late 2003, before [[UEFA Euro 2004]]. The first colour released was black and red (original). This Predator is the first boot include what Adidas calls the ''Power Pulse System'', and only ''Predator Pulse'' can't change to the original insole.

Adidas introduced PowerPulse in the Predator Pulse in late 2003, and continued with the ''Predator Absolute'' in November 2005. Adidas claims the PowerPulse sockliner shifts the boot’s centre of gravity closer to the point of impact, which they say offers more powerful shots on goal. Most of absolute's PowerPulse is 40g, however only Red version is 60g.

A very limited edition of this boot was released called the David Beckham Ying Yang box set. Only 723 pairs of these were released and came in a wooden md glass display box with a small book. Retail price was £699 in the UK for this box set but it is now very sought after by collectors.

===Absolute===

[[File:2006 Teamgeist.jpg|thumb|right|Adidas Predator Absolute with the 2006 World Cup Adidas match ball]]
The "Predator Absolute" introduced in mid-2006, just before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] in Germany. The first colour schemes were black/red, white/gold and blue/white. This Predator is the first with changeable PowerPulse sockliners which allows the exchange of the sockliner between the normal 40g and a lighter weight one, with no intentional weight added. Adidas made gold/white Absolute for Zinedine Zidane to celebrate his last international tournament.

===PowerSwerve===
With the ''Predator PowerSwerve'' in late 2007, Adidas introduced a foam material they call Smartfoam. They claim it gives the Predator element more rebound power, swerve, and improved control through longer ball contact. Zinedine Zidane helped to develop the new Predator PowerSwerve boot. After ending his active career, he worked together with the Adidas innovation team (a.i.t) in the further evolution of the new boot.
Scientific tests have shown{{citation needed|date=October 2010}} that, in comparison to its predecessor, the Predator PowerSwerve can achieve up to eight percent more swerve and increase the power behind every shot by around three percent. The Dynamic PowerPulse technology in the sole of the boot and the special hi-tech foam in the forefoot upper material make these improvements possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Predator Powerswerve|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2008/07/22/football-boots-adidas-predator-powerswerve-22-07-08.aspx|work=SoccerBible|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PowerPulse element filled with tungsten powder, which shifts weight toward the point of impact, enables players to put more power behind every shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Predator PowerSwerve 2008|url=http://www.soccerbible.com/news/football-boots/archive/2009/10/23/power-football-boots-adidas-predator-powerswerve-range-14-07-09.aspx|work=SoccerBible|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Powerswerve Special is a rugby version of the series. It has a wider last in the boot and rugby hybrid studs.

[[File:Adidas Predator X.jpg|thumb|A pair of Adidas Predator X's]]

===Predator X===
The Adidas "Predator X" shoes introduced in late 2009 have the ''Powerspine technology'', the Predator element and a host of advancements from Adidas, all intended for better performance. Adidas developed a new upper material they call ''Taurus'' leather. The Adidas Predator X football boots are the first Predator to remove the tongue, which Adidas says improves performance. They claim it reduces the material between the ball and boot to give better ball feel, and that the new boot collar gives a more secure fit.

Predator RX is a rugby version of the special, with a wider last and rugby specific predator vamp.

Footballers such as David Beckham, [[Xavi]], [[Robin van Persie]], [[Michael Ballack]], Raúl, [[Steven Gerrard]], [[Dirk Kuyt]], [[Kolo Touré]], [[Edwin van der Sar]], [[Petr Čech]], [[Brad Friedel]], [[Anderson (footballer, born 1988)|Anderson]] and [[Eiður Guðjohnsen]] have all worn Adidas Predators. Zinedine Zidane tested and reviewed the newest version of the Predator range(Predator X).

Adidas released the Predator X in the traditional black/white/red colourway, with a contrasting white/brown/yellow colourway&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2009/10/26/adidas-predator-x-released-our-review/ |title=Adidas Predator X White Review |accessdate=14 May 2011 |date=26 October 2009 |work=SoccerCleats101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to accompany it. Later, Adidas released other colourways including the usual David Beckham designed white/red colourway, with a dragon design on the rubber Predator element; also released were the blue/white/red. For the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]], Adidas released a black/sun colourway to follow on a colourway they used for all three of their boot styles (F50 adiZero and adiPure), later came the white/sky/cyan and back/white/cyan colourways, followed by another David Beckham designed Collegiate Red/White colourway.

For the winter of the 2010–11 season, Adidas released the Predator X in two new colourways, electricity/black/poppy and black/Running-White/electricity; David Beckham will also be getting another personalised colourway in white/blue. Steven Gerrard has been given the option of a Miadidas Predator which he personalised as black/gold/red.

===AdiPower Predator===

[[File:Adidas adiPower Predator.jpg|thumb|Adidas adiPower Predator White/Lilac Colorway]]

Released in May 2011, the Adidas adiPower Predator saw a shift in focus for the Predator range with the release of the new adiPower. The ''Powerspine'' technology has been retained, providing greater shooting power by minimizing energy loss. The Predator element on the instep of the boot has been split into two performance zones. The power zone incorporates 3D fins for power, while the silicon rubber Predator element provides swerve and ball control. The adiPower Predator now features the Sprint Frame outsole, originally created for the [[Adidas F50|F50]], making it 25% lighter than the Predator X. [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]]'s [[Kaká]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s [[Nani]] wore the adiPower Predators.

The adiPower, like other Adidas football boots released in 2011, faced an increase in price, with RRP set as £155 in the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Predator adiPower|url=http://www.footy-boots.com/adipower/|publisher=Footy-Boots.com|accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and $200 in the United States. They weigh in at 7.8 ounces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2011/05/14/adidas-adipower-predator-first-look/ |title=Adidas adiPower Predator - First Look! |accessdate=14 May 2011 |date=14 May 2011 |work=SoccerCleats101 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110605194625/http://www.soccercleats101.com/2011/05/14/adidas-adipower-predator-first-look/| archivedate= 5 June 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Adipower Predator SL====
The adidas Adipower Predator SL was released on 24 June 2011 as the lightest Predator yet, offered in a Black/Blue colorway at a retail price of $250 USD. This incarnation of the Predator used the revolutionary SprintSkin upper used in the popular F50 Adizero line and weighed just 211&amp;nbsp;grams.

===Predator Lethal Zones===
Released in May 2012, but previously tested by professionals in blackout versions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nani in new adidas Predator D5 boots|url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/3926-nani-in-new-adidas-predator-d5-boots.html|publisher=FootballBoots.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the next Predators will be called the LZ due to the five "lethal zones" on the boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New 2012 Predator LZ|url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/4235-new-2012-predator-lz.html|website=FootballBoots.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously referred to as the D5 due to the same five zones being called deadly, Adidas changed the name in the build up to their release. In a change for the Predators, they will have a synthetic leather upper and these will be the first Predator boots with miCoach capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Predator LZ Review|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2012/05/14/adidas-predator-lz-review/|work=SoccerCleats101 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Predator LZ features that same SprintFrame and stud configuration that is found in several other ranges such as the adipure and F50 adiZero. The first zone is called "first touch". It is on the front of the boot. It supposedly gives the wearer a good first touch. The second zone is called "dribble". It is on the side of the boot and supposedly gives a better touch. The third is called "drive". This is the classic predator zone in the striking part of the foot, used for long passes down the field and more powerful shots. The fourth is called "pass". It is made up of extra foam with a bit of tacky material in the passing zone. The last one is called "sweet spot". It is on the side of the big toe and is helpful for giving spin and chipping.

In November 2012, Adidas unveiled a new lightweight version of the Predator LZ, aptly named the Predator LZ SL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adidas Predator LZ SL Review|url=http://www.soccercleats101.com/2013/03/11/adidas-predator-lz-sl-review/|work=SoccerCleats101 |accessdate=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boot still features Lethal Zones, miCoach technology and the same soleplate. It is in the upper material where they are differentiated. Rather than using the Hybrid S-L seen in the regular LZ, Adidas employ a thinner SprintSkin on the back end of the LZ SL. This boot weighed in at 7.3oz.

In May 2013, Adidas officially released the updated version of the Predator LZ, named the Predator LZ II, and it was debuted by several players in Europe, including [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]]'s [[Pepe Reina]]; [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]'s [[Fernando Torres]], [[Oscar (footballer, born 1991)|Oscar]] and Petr Čech; [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]'s [[Aaron Ramsey]], [[Mesut Özil]] and [[Per Mertesacker]]; Real Madrid's [[Ángel Di María]] and [[Xabi Alonso]]; and Manchester United's [[Juan Mata]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/11829-ray-green-adidas-predator-lz-ii-debuted.html |accessdate=16 January 2016 |website=FootballBoots.co.uk |title=Ray Green adidas Predator LZ II Debuted !}}&lt;/ref&gt; First released in a Ray Green colourway, the next-generation Predator boasts new raised rubber lethal zones which add increased friction between your foot and the ball for ultimate control, touch, passing and shooting. Other features include the HybridTouch upper which is designed for optimal performance in all weather conditions and Traxion 2.0 stud configuration and SprintFrame soleplate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.footballboots.co.uk/11772-ray-green-adidas-predator-lz-ii-football-boots.html |title=Ray Green adidas Predator LZ II Football Boots |website=FootballBoots.co.uk |accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Campus board wood.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A campus board with wooden rungs of two different sizes]]
A '''campus board''' is a training tool that has been widely adopted to improve [[Climbing|rock climbing]] performance.  Typically, a user ascends or descends the campus board using only their hands.  Campus boards can take a variety of different forms and may incorporate a variety of materials.  As one example, a campus board may comprise horizontal thin slats or rails of wood attached to an inclined board in a ladderlike configuration.  However, some implementations may utilize bolt on climbing holds or sections of pipe.  A campus board is generally set at overhanging angle of inclination that is between vertical and 20 degrees. One consideration for selecting the angle of inclination is the avoidance of any interference that may result between the user's legs and the campus board or wall.

The campus board was invented by [[Wolfgang Güllich]] in 1988 while he was training for a new route, [[Action Directe (climb)|Action Directe]], which requires extreme dynamic finger strength. The first campus board was hung at a university in a gym called The Campus Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metoliusclimbing.com/pdf/Campus_Board_Brochure.pdf|title=The Campus Board|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Metolius|format=PDF|access-date=2016-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Climbing Dictionary|last=Samet|first=Mike|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|year=2011|isbn=978-1-59485-502-3|location=Seattle, WA|pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term "campus" has been applied to the name of the training board, training method, and style of climbing, or "campusing" in which only the user's hands and arms are used. In French and in Italian, the campus board is referred to as ''pan Güllich''.

There are a variety of training approaches that may be used with a campus board.  As one example, a user may alternate the use of specific fingers to increase finger strength when ascending or descending the board. As another example, upper-body strength may be increased by utilizing large lunges between specific rails or holds of the campus board (Power throws).  Reactive training may be used to increase muscle recruitment by dynamically moving between the campus board rails simultaneously with both hands.  Training on a campus board may result in better performance due to the improvement of motor training, increased finger strength on a variety of grips, and greater power and lock-off strength of the arms.

'''Caso Genoa''' was an [[Italian football]] scandal in 2005.

In the [[2004–05 Serie B]] season, [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] won the [[Serie B]] championship and were set to be promoted to the [[Serie A]] for the first time in 10 years. Genoa went into their final match of the season against [[S.S.C. Venezia|Venezia]] on 11 June 2005, having already secured promotion, and duly beat Venezia 3–2. However, three days later, it was discovered that [[Stefano Capozucca]], a director of Genoa, had paid Venezia director [[Giuseppe Pagliara]] €250,000 for his team to intentionally lose the match.

It was later found that the principal protagonists behind the scandal were Genoa's president, [[Enrico Preziosi]], and Venezia's president, [[Franco Dal Cin]].

On 8 August 2005, the [[Italian Football Federation]] (FIGC) determined that Genoa would be relegated to [[Serie C1]] with a three point penalty; it was the second time in Genoa's history that they had dropped out of the top two divisions, the first being in 1970. In addition, Preziosi, Dal Cin, Pagliara and Capozucca were each banned from Italian football for five years, while [[Michele Dal Cin]] was banned for three years and one month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/g/sezioni/sport/calcio/genovac/genovac/genovac.html|title=Calcio, Genoa retrocesso in C1 Tifosi furibondi, proteste in città|publisher=La Repubblica|date=27 July 2005|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chess Scotland''' is the [[Sport governing body|governing body]] for [[chess]] in [[Scotland]]. It was formed in 2001 with the merger of the '''''Scottish Chess Association''''' (SCA) and the '''''Scottish Junior Chess Association''''' (SJCA).&lt;ref name=Constitution&gt;{{cite web|title=Chess Scotland Constitution|url=http://www.chessscotland.com/csinfo/csconstit.htm|website=Chess Scotland|accessdate=21 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923202620/http://www.chessscotland.com/csinfo/csconstit.htm#|archive-date=2015-09-23|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of the oldest national chess associations in the world, the SCA having been founded in 1884.&lt;ref name=Constitution /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pritchett|first1=C.W.|last2=Thornton|first2=M.D.|title=Scotland's Chess Centenary Book : SCA 1884-1984 : the Scottish Chess Association Reaches Its Centenary|date=1984|publisher=Scottish Chess Association|location=South Queensferry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the national organisation for chess, Chess Scotland is the affiliate to the International Chess Federation ([[FIDE]]) and appoints the Scottish delegate to FIDE’s Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Entry for Scotland in the FIDE Directory|url=http://www.fide.com/fide/directory/member-federations.html?task=country&amp;fid=126|website=FIDE|access-date=2014-07-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307172313/http://www.fide.com/fide/directory/member-federations.html?task=country&amp;fid=126#|archive-date=2014-03-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its International Director is responsible for selecting the teams which represent Scotland at the biennial [[Chess Olympiad]].

==Objective and functions==
Its principal objective is to "foster and promote the game of chess throughout Scotland among players of all ages".&lt;ref name=Constitution /&gt;

Its principal functions are:

*to represent the interests of Scottish chess (at FIDE and elsewhere),
*to select individuals and teams to represent Scotland at international chess events,
*to hold national and international chess tournaments in Scotland
*to promote the game of chess in Scotland
*to train and appoint officials
* to operate a national grading system  

Chess Scotland's functions are performed by unpaid volunteers and is registered as a [[non-profit]] organisation. Its turn-over in 2009 was approximately £35,000, of which a third was provided by the [[Scottish Government]] via annual [[grant aid]]. In 2013 the Government grant ceased.

==Membership==
Many people can play chess and a significant proportion of these have an active interest in the game (e.g., internet chess, parents/guardians of junior players, etc.). The number of players currently known to CS is more than 5000, of whom about half are juniors. Approximately 3000 currently-active players have played sufficient games in official events (not necessarily events organized by CS) to be assigned a national rating (grade) for their standard of play.  Chess Scotland therefore serves a very wide constituency from school children to International Grandmasters.

==Organisation==
The affairs of Chess Scotland are managed by its directors and other officials who work (with other promoters, as appropriate) to fulfil the objectives of the organisation. Most of these posts are filled by election at the Annual General Meeting of Chess Scotland. Chess events are supervised by certified arbiters who must undergo written and practical competency tests administered by Chess Scotland. Chess Scotland also maintains a register of approved coaches and chaperons. All of these officials (arbiters, coaches and chaperons) are required to undergo “Disclosure” certification, under Scottish Child Protection legislation.

==Online==
Apart from the publicity surrounding its events, Chess Scotland’s activities are communicated to the general public (including children) and to its sponsors via its internet web-pages. An on-line forum promotes discussion of chess-related topics of current interest. In addition, Chess Scotland publishes a magazine which appears six times a year.

==Rating system==
The Chess Scotland on-line rating system is important for many players, and the rating system is a source of significant revenue to Chess Scotland.  Application to Chess Scotland for the recognition of an event (or player) for rating purposes brings the event (or player) within the jurisdiction of Chess Scotland.

==Commonwealth Chess Championships in Glasgow 2014==
Chess Scotland have been successful in bidding for the 2014 Commonwealth Chess Championships and they will be held in Glasgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minutes of the 2012 Meeting of the Commonwealth Chess Association|url=http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2012/Congress/Annex_92_-_Commonwealth_Chess_Association.pdf|website=FIDE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Clermont Avenue Skating Rink''' was a sports [[arena]] on Clermont Avenue in [[Brooklyn, New York]], United States. It was home to the [[Brooklyn Skating Club]] and the [[Brooklyn Crescents]] of the [[American Amateur Hockey League]] from 1896 to 1906.

The ice hockey team of the Brooklyn Skating Club folded in 1906 and the Brooklyn Crescents went on to play at the [[St. Nicholas Rink]] in [[Manhattan]] for the 1906–07 season as the Clermont Avenue Skating Rink instead was used for roller hockey.

'''Cycle polo''' is a [[team sport]], similar to traditional [[polo]], except that [[bicycle]]s are used instead of horses. There are 2 versions of the sport: grass and [[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]. The hardcourt game has seen a sharp spike in interest as of 2007&lt;ref name="punk"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8177668.stm | title=Polo's young punk cousin | publisher=BBC | date=31 July 2009 | accessdate=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and new teams are sprouting up across the world - in China, Canada, Ireland, Switzerland, France, India, Germany, Pakistan, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Hungary, Australia, New Zealand, Sweden, England, Scotland, Argentina, Italy, Spain, USA, Poland, Croatia, Slovenia, Lithuania, Nepal, Brazil and Cuba.

== The Traditional game ==

Traditional cycle polo is played in a rectangular grass field, 150 meters by 100 meters officially, unofficially whatever field is big enough. Moreover, official dimensions can vary between 120 and 150 meters in length on 80 to 100 meters in width. The ball used approximately 2.5&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter and the mallet is of length 1 meter.

There are 6 members (7 in France) on a team of which 4 (5 in France) are on field at a time. The other two are used as substitutes. International matches are played for a duration of 30 minutes divided into periods of 7.5 minutes each called as a ''chukkar''. Extra time can be used to determine the winner in case the scores are tied at normal time.

If a deliberate foul is committed at the vicinity of the goal, the team that is fouled is automatically given a goal. Less severe fouls are awarded 15 metre and 25 metre free hits. In the event of deliberate fouls or dangerous fouls, the umpire can issue the Yellow card (warning) and in case of repeated or severe fouls the Red card (ejection). The ejected player can be replaced by a substitute after the end of the current ''chukkar'' if the umpire allows it.

== The Hardcourt game ==
[[File:Bike polo.ogv|thumb|320px|Video of cycle polo]]
{{main article|Hardcourt Bike Polo}}

In recent years, an alternate form of the game known as "[[Hardcourt Bike Polo]]" has grown in popularity.&lt;ref name="punk"/&gt;  In this variation, teams composed of three players compete on tennis courts, street hockey rinks, or whatever other surfaces are available.  The rules vary slightly by city.

Generally this is a faster game with 3 members on a team, no substitutions, and all members are on the court at all times. A [[street hockey]] ball is used and matches are played until one team scores 5 points or time has expired, without playing chukkars. During tournament play a time limit, such as 10 minutes, may be used to maximize the number of tournament rounds possible during the day.

There are three core rules of play:

In the case of a 'foot down' or 'dab' (touching the ground with one's foot) the player must "tap out" by riding to mid-court and hitting a designated area with their mallet. There is usually a tap-out located on either side of the court.

In order to score, the offensive player must hit the ball across the goal line using the narrow end of the mallet - called a "shot" or "hit." Hitting the ball across the goal line with the wide end of the mallet is called a "shuffle".

When your team scores a goal, you wait back in your end for the other team (player or ball, whichever comes first) to cross half before engaging in play again.

The [[North American Hardcourt Bike Polo Association]] has created an official ruleset,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nahardcourt.com/rules Official North American ruleset]&lt;/ref&gt; which has helped standardize rules across the globe.

== History ==
The game was invented in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1891 by retired champion cyclist [[Richard J. Mecredy]], editor of ''The Irish Cyclist'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/london/hi/people_and_places/2012/newsid_8845000/8845620.stm Could a lost Olympic sport find its way back to London? BBC 23 July 2010 article - retrieved 27 July 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year the first cycle polo match was played at the Scalp (County Wicklow) between ''Rathclaren Rovers'' and the ''Ohne Hast Cycling Club''.&lt;ref name=velo&gt;{{cite web|author=polovelo |url=http://www.polo-velo.net/english/history/history.htm |title=Cycle polo story |publisher=Polo-velo.net |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Towards the end of the 19th century the game reached Great Britain, France, and the United States where the [[American Star Bicycle]] was a popular mount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Cycle polo was a demonstration sport at the [[1908 Olympics|1908 London Olympics]] with Ireland winning the gold, beating Germany.&lt;ref name=velo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/sports/ath041908.htm |title=Welcome to rediff.com : Sports - Athens 2004 History |publisher=Rediff.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/olympics_2004/history/3054406.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; Olympics 2004 &amp;#124; History &amp;#124; London 1908 |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-07-09 |accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sport reached its peak of popularity in Great Britain during the 1930s with the introduction of the regional leagues. Cycle polo also flourished in France during this period with the establishment of the French league. Internationals between France and Great Britain were held regularly. However the Second World War marked the beginning of the demise of cycle polo in Britain. The sport remained in France though, with league championships held regularly until today.

The 1980s saw the rise of two new powers in cycle polo, India and United States. The Bicycle Polo Association of America was created in 1994. International cycle polo matches staged a comeback in the 1990s with the first world championship organized in 1996 in the USA. Today there is organized cycle polo being played in Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Ireland, Malaysia, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Sweden, Switzerland and USA. Cycle polo was officially recognized by the [[Union Cycliste Internationale]] in 2001.

'''Diving''' is the [[sport]] of jumping or falling into water from a [[Diving platform|platform]] or [[springboard]], usually while performing [[acrobatics]]. Diving is an internationally recognized sport that is part of the [[Olympic Games]].  In addition, unstructured and non-competitive diving is a recreational pastime.

Diving is one of the most popular [[Diving at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] sports with spectators.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Competitors possess many of the same characteristics as [[gymnastics|gymnasts]] and [[dance]]rs, including strength, flexibility, [[kinaesthetic]] judgment and air awareness. Some professional divers were originally gymnasts or dancers as both the sports have similar characteristics to diving. [[Dmitri Sautin]] holds the record for most Olympic diving medals won, by winning eight medals in total between 1992 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Guinness World Records 2014|last=Glenday|first=Craig|publisher=|year=2013|isbn=9781908843159|location=|pages=258|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Plunging===
[[File:The Plunge Sinclair 1893.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Plunging, the first competitive diving sport.]]
Although diving has been a popular pastime across the world since ancient times, the first modern diving competitions were held in [[England]] in the 1880s. The exact origins of the sport are unclear, though it likely derives from the act of diving at the start of swimming races.&lt;ref name="1877starts"&gt;Wilson, William. [https://books.google.com/books?id=jUYCAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA60 The swimming instructor], p. 60-64 (1883)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="howtogetin"&gt;(2 August 1845). [https://books.google.com/books?id=I3AXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA245 Swimming – Section III – How To Go Into The Water – Plunging], ''The Sportsman's magazine''&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1904 book ''Swimming'' by Ralph Thomas notes English reports of plunging records dating back to at least 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Ralph. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0ZAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA149 Swimming], p. 149-50 (1904)&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1877 edition to ''British Rural Sports'' by [[John Henry Walsh]] makes note of a "Mr. Young" plunging 56 feet in 1870, and also states that 25 years prior, a swimmer named Drake could cover 53 feet.&lt;ref name="walsh1"&gt;[[John Henry Walsh|Walsh, John Henry]]. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4ZMXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA720 British rural sports], p. 720-21 (13th ed. 1877)&lt;/ref&gt;

The English [[Amateur Swimming Association]] (at the time called the Swimming Association of Great Britain) first started a "[[Plunge for distance|plunging championship]]" in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, William and Sinclair, Archibland. [https://books.google.com/books?id=UfgWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA111 Swimming], p.110-19, 411 (1893)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1883enc"&gt;Cox, Richard et al. [https://books.google.com/books?ei=-uAxTrKIEcPl0QHj74HhCw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=JWQTAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=%22plunging+championship%22+1883&amp;q=plunging+1883#search_anchor Ref Encyclopedia of British sport], p. 111 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The Plunging Championship was discontinued in 1937.

===Fancy diving===
Diving into a body of water had also been a method used by gymnasts in [[Germany]] and [[Sweden]] since the early 19th century. The soft landing allowed for more elaborate gymnastic feats in midair as the jump could be made from a greater height. This tradition evolved into 'fancy diving', while diving as a preliminary to swimming became known as 'Plain diving'.

In [[England]], the practice of [[high diving]] – diving from a great height – gained popularity; the first diving stages were erected at the [[Highgate Ponds]] at a height of 15 feet in 1893 and the first world championship event, the National Graceful Diving Competition, was held there by the [[Royal Life Saving Society UK|Royal Life Saving Society]] in 1895. The event consisted of standing and running dives from either 15 or 30 feet.

It was at this event that the Swedish tradition of fancy diving was introduced to the sport by the athletes Otto Hagborg and C F Mauritzi. They demonstrated their acrobatic techniques from the 10m diving board at Highgate Pond and stimulated the establishment of the [[Amateur Swimming Association|Amateur Diving Association]] in 1901, the first organization devoted to diving in the world (later amalgamated with the Amateur Swimming Association). Fancy diving was formally introduced into the championship in 1903.&lt;ref name="HISTORY of DIVING"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.metroatlantadivers.com/history_of_diving|title=HISTORY of DIVING|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swimming.org/britishswimming/diving/a-history-of-diving/|title=A brief history of diving|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic era===
[[File:Diver2.jpg|thumb|Swedish high diver [[Arvid Spångberg]] at the [[1908 Olympic Games]] from the fourth Olympiad.]]
Plain diving was first introduced into the [[Olympics]] at the [[Diving at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 event]].  The [[Diving at the 1908 Summer Olympics|1908 Olympics in London]] added 'fancy diving' and introduced elastic boards rather than fixed platforms. Women were first allowed to participate in the diving events for the [[Diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]] in [[Stockholm]].&lt;ref name="HISTORY of DIVING"/&gt;

In the 1928 Olympics, 'plain' and 'fancy' diving was amalgamated into one event – 'Highboard Diving'. The diving event was first held indoors in the [[Wembley Arena|Empire Pool]] for the [[1934 British Empire Games]] and [[1948 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]].

==Competitive diving==
Most diving competitions consist of three disciplines: 1&amp;nbsp;m and 3&amp;nbsp;m springboards, and the platform. Competitive athletes are divided by gender, and often by age group. In platform events, competitors are allowed to perform their dives on either the five, seven and a half (generally just called seven), nine, or ten meter towers.  In major diving meets, including the [[Olympic Games]] and the World Championships, platform diving is from the 10 meter height.

[[File:Diving off a deck into the Great South Bay of Long Island.jpg|thumb|A man dives into the [[Great South Bay]] of [[Long Island]].|left]]
Divers have to perform a set number of dives according to established requirements, including somersaults and twists. Divers are judged on whether and how well they completed all aspects of the dive, the conformance of their body to the requirements of the dive, and the amount of splash created by their entry to the water.  A possible score out of ten is broken down into three points for the takeoff (meaning the hurdle), three for the flight (the actual dive), and three for the entry (how the diver hits the water), with one more available to give the judges flexibility.

The raw score is multiplied by a degree of difficulty factor, derived from the number and combination of movements attempted. The diver with the highest total score after a sequence of dives is declared the winner.

===Synchronized diving===
[[File:Salto ornamental - UnB.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|A man and a woman perform Synchronized diving in Brazil, 2014]] 

Synchronized diving was adopted as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form a team and perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be possible to dive opposites, also known as a pinwheel, but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.

===Scoring the dive===
There are rules governing the scoring of a dive. Usually a score considers three elements of the dive: the approach, the flight, and the entry.  The primary factors affecting the scoring are:

* if a hand-stand is required, the length of time and quality of the hold
* the height of the diver at the apex of the dive, with extra height resulting in a higher score
* the distance of the diver from the diving apparatus throughout the dive (a diver must not be dangerously close, should not be too far away, but should ideally be within {{convert|2|ft|m}} of the platform)
* the properly defined body position of the diver according to the dive being performed, including pointed toes and feet touching at all times
* the proper amounts of rotation and revolution upon completion of the dive and entry into the water
* angle of entry – a diver should enter the water straight, without any angle.  
* amount of splash – many judges award divers for the amount of splash created by the diver on entry, with less splash resulting in a higher score.

Each dive is assigned a ''degree of difficulty'' (DD),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fina.org/project/docs/rules/rules_dA2.pdf|title=Appendix 2: FINA table of degree of difficulty|date=15 September 2009|publisher=[[FINA]]|format=PDF|accessdate=4 September 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913161738/http://www.fina.org/project/docs/rules/rules_dA2.pdf|archivedate=13 September 2015|df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is determined from a combination of the moves undertaken, position used, and height. The DD value is multiplied by the scores given by the judges.

To reduce the subjectivity of scoring in major meets, panels of five or seven judges are assembled; major international events such as the Olympics use seven-judge panels. For a five-judge panel, the highest and lowest scores are discarded and the middle three are summed and multiplied by the DD. For seven-judge panels, as of the [[2012 London Olympics]], the two highest scores and two lowest are discarded, leaving three to be summed and multiplied by the DD. (Prior to the London Olympics, the highest and lowest scores were eliminated, and the remaining five scores were multiplied by {{frac|3|5}}, to allow for comparison to five-judge panels.) The canceling of scores is used to make it difficult for a single judge to manipulate scores.

There is a general misconception about scoring and judging. In serious meets, the absolute score is somewhat meaningless. It is the relative score, not the absolute score that wins meets. Accordingly, good judging implies consistent scoring across the dives. Specifically, if a judge consistently gives low scores for all divers, or consistently gives high scores for the same divers, the judging will yield fair relative results and will cause divers to place in the correct order. However, absolute scores have significance to the individual divers. Besides the obvious instances of setting records, absolute scores are also used for rankings and qualifications for higher level meets.

In synchronised diving events, there is a panel of seven, nine, or eleven judges; two or three to mark the execution of one diver, two or three to mark the execution of the other, and the remaining three or five to judge the synchronisation.  The execution judges are positioned two on each side of the pool, and they score the diver which is nearer to them.  The [[2012 Summer Olympics|2012 London Olympics]] saw the first use of eleven judges.

The score is computed similarly to the scores from other diving events, but has been modified starting with the 2012 London Olympics for the use of the larger judging panels.  Each group of judges will have the highest and lowest scores dropped, leaving the middle score for each diver's execution and the three middle scores for synchronization.  The total is then weighted by {{frac|3|5}} and multiplied by the DD.  The result is that the emphasis is on the synchronization of the divers.

The synchronisation scores are based on:
* time of take-off
* height attained
* synchronisation of rotations and twists
* time of entry to the water
* forward travel from the board

The judges may also disqualify the diver for certain violations during the dive, including:
* receiving a score of 0 on all dives performed in the event
* improper equipment usage (e.g., female divers not using hair ties)

===Competitive strategy===
[[File:Greglouganis.jpg|thumb|1984 and 1988 Olympic gold medal diver [[Greg Louganis]]]]
To win dive meets, divers create a dive list in advance of the meet. To win the meet the diver must accumulate more points than other divers. Often, simple dives with low DDs will look good to spectators but will not win meets. The competitive diver will attempt the highest DD dives possible with which they can achieve consistent, high scores. If divers are scoring 8 or 9 on most dives, it may be a sign of their extreme skill, or it may be a sign that their dive list is not competitive, and they may lose the meet to a diver with higher DDs and lower scores.

In competition, divers must submit their lists beforehand, and once past a deadline (usually when the event is announced or shortly before it begins) they cannot change their dives. If they fail to perform the dive announced, even if they physically cannot execute the dive announced or if they perform a more difficult dive, they will receive a score of zero. Under exceptional circumstances, a redive may be granted, but these are exceedingly rare (usually for very young divers just learning how to compete, or if some event outside the diver's control has caused them to be unable to perform-such as a loud noise).

In the Olympics or other highly competitive meets, many divers will have nearly the same list of dives as their competitors.  The importance for divers competing at this level is not so much the DD, but how they arrange their list. Once the more difficult rounds of dives begin it is important to lead off with a confident dive to build momentum. They also tend to put a very confident dive in front of a very difficult dive to ensure that they will have a good mentality for the difficult dive. Most divers have pre-dive and post-dive rituals that help them either maintain or regain focus. Coaches also play a role in this aspect of the sport. Many divers rely on their coaches to help keep their composure during the meet. In a large meet coaches are rarely allowed on the deck to talk to their athlete so it is common to see coaches using hand gestures or body movements to communicate.

There are some American meets which will allow changes of the position of the dive even after the dive has been announced immediately before execution, but these are an exception to the rules generally observed internationally.

Generally, NCAA rules allow for dives to be changed while the diver is on the board, but the diver must request the change directly after the dive is announced. This applies especially in cases where the wrong dive is announced. If the diver pauses during his or her hurdle to ask for a change of dive, it will be declared a balk (when the diver stops mid-hurdle) and the change of dive will not be permitted.

Under FINA law, no dive may be changed after the deadline for the dive-sheet to be submitted (generally a period ranging from one hour to 24 hours, depending on the rulings made by the event organiser).

It is the diver's responsibility to ensure that the dive-sheet is filled in correctly, and also to correct the referee or announcer before the dive if they describe it incorrectly. If a dive is performed which is as submitted but not as (incorrectly) announced, it is declared failed and scores zero according to a strict reading of the FINA law. But in practice, a re-dive would usually be granted in these circumstances.

==Governance==
The global governing body of diving is [[FINA]], which also governs [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[synchronised swimming]], [[water polo]] and [[open water swimming]]. Almost invariably, at national level, diving shares a governing body with the other aquatic sports.

This is frequently a source of political friction as the committees are naturally dominated by swimming officials who do not necessarily share or understand the concerns of the diving community. Divers often feel, for example, that they do not get adequate support over issues like the provision of facilities. Other areas of concern are the selection of personnel for the specialised Diving committees and for coaching and officiating at events, and the team selection for international competitions.

There are sometimes attempts to separate the governing body as a means to resolve these frustrations, but they are rarely successful. For example, in the UK the [[Great Britain Diving Federation]] was formed in 1992 with the intention of taking over the governance of Diving from the ASA ([[Amateur Swimming Association]]).  Although it initially received widespread support from the diving community, the FINA requirement that international competitors had to be registered with their National Governing Body was a major factor in the abandonment of this ambition a few years later.

Since FINA refused to rescind recognition of the ASA as the British governing body for all aquatic sports including diving, this meant that the elite divers had to belong to ASA-affiliated clubs to be eligible for selection to international competition.

In the United States scholastic diving is almost always part of the school's swim team.  Diving is a separate sport in Olympic and Club Diving.  The [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] will separate diving from swimming in special diving competitions after the swim season is completed.

==Safety==
[[File:Nodiving.jpg|right|thumb|A sign prohibiting diving at a beach in [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]]]
Despite the apparent risk, the statistical incidence of injury in supervised training and competition is extremely low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.divingboardsafety.net/AIR_report.pdf|title=Review of spinal cord injury statistics related to diving and diving board use|publisher=American Institutes for Research|year=2003|accessdate=8 December 2010|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of accidents that are classified as 'diving-related' are incidents caused by individuals jumping from structures such as bridges or piers into water of inadequate depth. Many accidents also occur when divers do not account for rocks and logs in the water.  Because of this many beaches and pools prohibit diving in shallow waters or when a [[lifeguard]] is not on duty.

After an incident in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in 1993, most US and other pool builders are reluctant to equip a residential [[swimming pool]] with a diving springboard so home diving pools are much less common these days. In the incident, 14-year-old Shawn Meneely made a "suicide dive" (holding his hands at his sides, so that his head hit the bottom first) in a private swimming pool and became a [[tetraplegia|tetraplegic]]. The lawyers for the family, Jan Eric Peterson and Fred Zeder, successfully sued the diving board manufacturer, the pool builder, and the National Spa and Pool Institute over the inappropriate depth of the pool.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news |first=AmyJo|last=Brown|title=No Diving?|url=http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|publisher=Pool &amp; Spa News| date=30 January 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040304034008/http://www.poolspanews.com/2004/012/012diving.html|archivedate=4 March 2004 |accessdate=2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Deep Impact: Back Yard Danger | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/06/02/60II/main6583.shtml|publisher=[[CBS News]]|work=[[60 Minutes II]]|date=2 June 1999|accessdate=5 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NSPI had specified a minimum depth of 7&amp;nbsp;ft 6 in (2.29 m) which proved to be insufficient in the above case. The pool into which Meneely dived was not constructed to the published standards.  The standards had changed after the diving board was installed on the non-compliant pool by the homeowner.  But the courts held that the pool "was close enough" to the standards to hold NSPI liable.  The multimillion-dollar lawsuit was eventually resolved in 2001 for US$6.6&amp;nbsp;million ($8&amp;nbsp;million after interest was added) in favor of the plaintiff.&lt;ref&gt;Appeals Court State of WA, Docket Number:18036-1-III
Title: Shawn Meneely, et al. v. S. R. Smith, Inc., et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  The NSPI was held to be liable, and was financially strained by the case. It filed twice for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] bankruptcy protection and was successfully reorganized into a new swimming pool industry association.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

In competitive diving, FINA takes regulatory steps to ensure that athletes are protected from the inherent dangers of the sport.  For example, they impose restrictions according to age on the heights of platforms which divers may compete on.

* Group D (11 &amp; under): 5&amp;nbsp;m
* Group C (12/13 year): 5&amp;nbsp;m &amp; 7.5&amp;nbsp;m
* Group B (14/15 year): 5&amp;nbsp;m, 7.5&amp;nbsp;m &amp; 10&amp;nbsp;m
* Group A (16/18 year): 5&amp;nbsp;m, 7.5&amp;nbsp;m &amp; 10&amp;nbsp;m

Group D divers have only recently been allowed to compete on the tower.  In the past, the age group could compete only springboard, to discourage children from taking on the greater risks of tower diving.  Group D tower was introduced to counteract the phenomenon of coaches pushing young divers to compete in higher age categories, thus putting them at even greater risk.

However, some divers may safely dive in higher age categories to dive on higher platforms.  Usually this occurs when advanced Group C divers wish to compete on the 10&amp;nbsp;m.

Points on pool depths in connection with safety:

* most competition pools are 5m deep for 10&amp;nbsp;m platform and 4m deep for 5m platform or 3m springboard.  These are currently the FINA recommended minimum depths.  Some are deeper, e.g. 6m for the diving pit at Sheffield, England.
* diving from 10&amp;nbsp;m and maintaining a downward streamlined position results in gliding to a stop at about 4.5 – 5m.
* high standard competition divers rarely go more than about 2.5m below the surface, as they roll in the direction of the dive's rotation. This is a technique to produce a clean entry.
* attempting to scoop the trajectory underwater against the rotation is extremely inadvisable as it can cause serious back injuries.
* hitting the water flat from 10&amp;nbsp;m brings the diver to rest in about 1&amp;nbsp;ft. The extreme deceleration causes severe bruising both internal and external, strains to connective tissue securing the organs and possible minor hemorrhage to lungs and other tissue. This is very painful and distressing, but not life-threatening.

==Dive groups==
[[File:Reverse 5391.JPG|thumb|right|A male diver performs a reverse in the tuck position from a 3-meter springboard]]
There are six "groups" into which dives are classified: ''Forward, Back, Inward, Reverse, Twist,'' and ''Armstand''. The latter applies only to Platform competitions, whereas the other five apply to both Springboard and Platform.

* in the Forward Group (Group 1), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates forward
* in the Back Group (2), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates backward
* in the Reverse Group (3), the diver takes off facing forward and rotates backward
* in the Inward Group (4), the diver takes off with their back to the water and rotates forward
* any dive incorporating an axial twisting movement is in the Twist group (5).
* any dive commencing from a handstand is in the Armstand group (6). (Only on platform)
{{anchor|Positions}}

===Dive positions===
During the flight of the dive, one of four positions is assumed:
* straight – with no bend at the knees or hips (the hardest of the four)
* pike – with knees straight but a tight bend at the hips (the median in difficulty of the four.) The open pike is a variant where the arms are reached to the side, and the legs are brought straight out with a bend in the hips.
* tuck – body folded up in a tight ball, hands holding the shins and toes pointed (the easiest of the four.)
* free – indicates a twisting dive, and a combination of other positions. In the transition between two positions the diver may for example bend their legs or curve at the waist, and points will not be deducted for doing so.

These positions are referred to by the letters A, B, C and D respectively.

Additionally, some dives can be started in a flying position. The body is kept straight with the arms extended to the side, and the regular dive position is assumed at about half the dive.

Difficulty is rated according to the Degree of Difficulty of the dives. Some divers may find pike easier in a flip than tuck, and most find straight the easiest in a front/back dive, although it is still rated the most difficult because of the risk of overrotation.

An armstand dive may have a higher degree of difficulty outdoors compared to indoors as wind can destabilize the equilibrium of the diver.

===Dive numbers===
In competition, the dives are referred to by a schematic system of three- or four-digit numbers. The letter to indicate the position is appended to the end of the number.

The first digit of the number indicates the dive group as defined above.

For groups 1 to 4, the number consists of three digits and a letter of the alphabet. The third digit represents the number of half-somersaults. The second digit is either 0 or 1, with 0 representing a normal somersault, and 1 signifying a "flying" variation of the basic movement (i.e. the first half somersault is performed in the straight position, and then the pike or tuck shape is assumed).  No flying dive has been competed at a high level competition for many years.

For example:
* 101A – forward Dive Straight
* 203C – back one-and-a-half somersaults, tuck
* 305C – reverse two-and-a-half somersaults, tuck
* 113B – flying forward one-and-a-half somersaults, pike

For Group 5, the dive number has 4 digits. The first digit indicates that it is a twisting dive. The second digit indicates the group (1–4) of the underlying movement; the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth indicates the number of half-twists.

For example:
* 5211A – back dive, half twist, straight position.
* 5337D – reverse one and a half somersaults with three and a half twists, in the Free position.

For Group 6 – Armstand – the dive number has either three or four digits: Three digits for dives without twist and four for dives with twists.

In non-twisting armstand dives, the second digit indicates the direction of rotation (0 = no rotation, 1 = forward, 2 = backward, 3 = reverse, 4 = inward) and the third digit indicates the number of half-somersaults. Inward-rotating armstand dives have never been performed, and are generally regarded as physically impossible.

For example:
* 600A – armstand dive straight
* 612B – armstand forward somersault pike
* 624C – armstand back double somersault tuck

For twisting Armstand dives, the dive number again has 4 digits, but rather than beginning with the number 5, the number 6 remains as the first digit, indicating that the "twister" will be performed from an Armstand. The second digit indicates the direction of rotation – as above, the third is the number of half-somersaults, and the fourth is the number of half-twists:

e.g. 6243D – armstand back double-somersault with one and a half twists in the free position

All of these dives come with DD (degree of difficulty) this is an indication of how difficult/complex a dive is. The score that the dive receives is multiplied by the DD (also known as tariff) to give the dive a final score. Before a diver competes they must decide on a "list" this is a number of optional dives and compulsory dives. The optionals come with a DD limit. this means that a diver must select X number of dives and the combined DD limit must be no more than the limit set by the competition/organisation etc.

Until the mid-1990s the tariff was decided by the FINA diving committee, and divers could only select from the range of dives in the published tariff table.  Since then, the tariff is calculated by a formula based on various factors such as the number of twist and somersaults, the height, the group etc., and divers are free to submit new combinations.  This change was implemented because new dives were being invented too frequently for an annual meeting to accommodate the progress of the sport.

==Mechanics of diving==
[[File:The Tomb of the Diver - Paestum - Italy.JPG|thumb|[[Tomb of the Diver]], [[Paestum]], [[Italy]], a Greek fresco dated 470 BC]]
At the moment of take-off, two critical aspects of the dive are determined, and cannot subsequently be altered during the execution.  One is the trajectory of the dive, and the other is the magnitude of the angular momentum.

The speed of rotation – and therefore the total amount of rotation – may be varied from moment to moment by changing the shape of the body, in accordance with the law of conservation of angular momentum.

The center of mass of the diver follows a parabolic path in free-fall under the influence of gravity (ignoring the effects of air resistance, which are negligible at the speeds involved).&lt;ref&gt;''Diving Complete'' George Rackham (1975)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trajectory===
Since the parabola is symmetrical, the travel away from the board as the diver passes it is twice the amount of the forward travel at the peak of the flight. Excessive forward distance to the entry point is penalized when scoring a dive, but obviously an adequate clearance from the diving board is essential on safety grounds.

The greatest possible height that can be achieved is desirable for several reasons:

* the height attained is itself one of the factors that the judges will reward.
* a greater height gives a longer flight time and therefore more time to execute maneuvers.
* for any given clearance when passing the board, the forward travel distance to the entry point will be less for a higher trajectory.

===Control of rotation===
The magnitude of [[angular momentum]] remains constant throughout the dive, but since

::angular momentum = [[rotational velocity]] × [[moment of inertia]],

and the moment of inertia is larger when the body has an increased radius, the speed of rotation may be increased by moving the body into a compact shape, and reduced by opening out into a straight position.

Since the tucked shape is the most compact, it gives the most control over rotational speed, and dives in this position are easier to perform.  Dives in the straight position are hardest, since there is almost no scope for altering the speed, so the angular momentum must be created at take-off with a very high degree of accuracy. (A small amount of control is available by moving the position of the arms and by a slight hollowing of the back).

The opening of the body for the entry does not stop the rotation, but merely slows it down. The vertical entry achieved by expert divers is largely an illusion created by starting the entry slightly short of vertical, so that the legs are vertical as they disappear beneath the surface.  A small amount of additional tuning is available by 'entry save' techniques, whereby underwater movements of the upper body and arms against the viscosity of the water affect the position of the legs.&lt;ref&gt;''Diving for Gold'' Ron O'Brien (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twisting===
[[File:N657815313 2283069 8370.jpg|thumb|right|A twisting dive performed from a 10-meter platform.]]
Dives with multiple twists and somersaults are some of the most spectacular movements, as well as the most challenging to perform.

The rules state that twisting 'must not be generated manifestly on take-off'.  Consequently, divers must use some of the somersaulting angular momentum to generate twisting movements.  The physics of twisting can be explained by looking at the components of the [[angular momentum]] [[Euclidean vector|vector]].

As the diver leaves the board, the total angular momentum vector is horizontal, pointing directly to the left for a forward dive for example.  For twisting rotation to exist, it is necessary to tilt the body sideways after takeoff, so that there is now a small component of this horizontal angular momentum vector along the body's long axis.  The tilt can be seen in the photo.

The tilting is done by the arms, which are outstretched to the sides just before the twist.  When one arm is moved up and the other is moved down (like turning a big steering wheel), the body reacts by tilting to the side, which then begins the twisting rotation.  At the completion of the required number of twist rotations, the arm motion is reversed (the steering wheel is turned back), which removes the body's tilt and stops the twisting rotation.

An alternative explanation is that the moving arms have [[precession]] [[torque]] on them which set the body into twisting rotation.  Moving the arms back produces opposite torque which stops the twisting rotation.

===Entry===
The rules state that the body should be vertical, or nearly so, for entry.  Strictly speaking, it is physically impossible to achieve a literally vertical position throughout the entry as there will inevitably still be some rotational momentum while the body is entering the water.  Divers therefore attempt to create the illusion of being vertical, especially when performing rapidly rotating multiple somersault movements. For back entries, one technique is to allow the upper body to enter slightly short of vertical so that the continuing rotation leaves the final impression of the legs entering vertically. This is called "Pike save".  Another is to use "knee save" movements of scooping the upper body underwater in the direction of rotation so as to counteract the rotation of the legs.

The arms must be beside the body for feet-first dives, which are typically competed only on the 1m springboard and only at fairly low levels of 3m springboard, and extended forwards in line for "head-first" dives, which are much more common competitively.  It used to be common for the hands to be interlocked with the fingers extended towards the water, but a different technique has become favoured during the last few decades.  Now the usual practice is for one hand to grasp the other with palms down to strike the water with a flat surface.  This creates a vacuum between the hands, arms and head which, with a vertical entry, will pull down and under any splash until deep enough to have minimal effect on the surface of the water (the so-called "rip entry").

Once a diver is completely under the water they may choose to roll or scoop in the same direction their dive was rotating to pull their legs into a more vertical position. Apart from aesthetic considerations, it is important from a safety point of view that divers reinforce the habit of rolling in the direction of rotation, especially for forward and inward entries.  Back injuries [[hyperextention]] are caused by attempting to re-surface in the opposite direction. Diving from the higher levels increases the danger and likelihood of such injuries.

==By country==

===Canada===
[[File:Diving Plongeon Canada.svg|right|100px|thumb|The DPC logo]]In Canada, elite competitive diving is regulated by DPC (Diving Plongeon Canada), although the individual provinces also have organizational bodies. The main competitive season runs from February to July, although some competitions may be held in January or December, and many divers (particularly international level athletes) will train and compete year round.

Most provincial level competitions consist of events for 6 age groups (Groups A, B, C, D, E, and Open) for both genders on each of the three board levels.  These age groups roughly correspond to those standardized by FINA, with the addition of a youngest age group for divers 9 and younger, Group E, which does not compete nationally and does not have a tower event (although divers of this age may choose to compete in Group D).  The age group Open is so called because divers of any age, including those over 18, may compete in these events, so long as their dives meet a minimum standard of difficulty.

Although Canada is internationally a fairly strong country in diving, the vast majority of Canadian high schools and universities do not have diving teams, and many Canadian divers accept athletic scholarships from American colleges.

Adult divers who are not competitive at an elite level may compete in masters diving.  Typically, masters are either adults who never practiced the sport as children or teenagers, or former elite athletes who have retired but still seek a way to be involved in the sport.  Many diving clubs have masters teams in addition to their primary competitive ones, and while some masters dive only for fun and fitness, there are also masters competitions, which range from the local to world championship level.

====National championships====
Divers can qualify to compete at the age group national championships, or junior national championships, in their age groups as assigned by FINA up to the age of 18.  This competition is held annually in July.  Qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions in the season, although athletes who place very highly at a national championship will be automatically qualified to compete at the next.  Divers must qualify at two different competitions, at least one of which must be a level 1 competition, i.e. a competition with fairly strict judging patterns.  Such competitions include the Polar Bear Invitational in Winnipeg, the Sting in Victoria, and the Alberta Provincial Championships in Edmonton or Calgary. The qualifying scores are determined by DPC according to the results of the preceding year's national competition, and typically do not have much variation from year to year.

Divers older than 18, or advanced divers of younger ages, can qualify for the senior national championships, which are held twice each year, once roughly in March and once in June or July.  Once again, qualification is based on achieving minimum scores at earlier competitions (in this case, within the 12 months preceding the national championships, and in an Open age group event), or high placements in previous national championships or international competitions.  It is no longer the case that divers may use results from age group events to qualify for senior nationals, or results from Open events to qualify for age group nationals.

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland facilities are limited to one pool at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin.

====National championships====
National championships take place late in the year, usually during November. The competition is held at the National Aquatic Centre in Dublin and consists of four events:
* Irish Open Age Group Championships
* Irish Open Senior Diving Championships
* Novice Competition (8–16 yrs)
* Novice Masters Competition (&gt;25 yrs)

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, diving competitions on all boards run throughout the year.  National Masters' Championships are held two or three times per year.

===United States===

====Summer diving====
In the United States, summer diving is usually limited to one meter diving at community or country club pools.  Some pools organize to form intra-pool competitions.  These competitions are usually designed to accommodate all school-age children.  One of the largest and oldest summer leagues in the United States is found in the [[Northern Virginia]] area where teams from 47 pools compete against each other every summer. NVSL-Dive annually holds the Wally Martin 3-Meter Championship and concludes the season with its Individual All Stars Championship. In addition, NVSL-Dive annually hosts the largest one-day dive meet in the world, with over 350 developmental divers in [[Northern Virginia Swim League|NVSL]]'s "Cracker Jack" Invitational! Champions from each of these events have gone on to compete at the collegiate and Olympic levels.

====High school diving====
In the United States scholastic diving at the high school level is usually limited to one meter diving (but some schools use three meter springboards.). Scores from those one meter dives contribute to the swim team's overall score. High school diving and swimming concludes their season with a state competition. Depending on the state and the number of athletes competing in the state, certain qualifications must be achieved to compete in the state's championship meet. There are often regional championships and district championships which are necessary to compete in before reaching the state meet to narrow the field to only the most competitive athletes. Most state championship meets consist of eleven dives. The eleven dives are usually split up between two categories: five required (voluntary) dives and six optional dives.

====Club diving====
In the United States, pre-college divers interested in learning one and three meter or platform diving should consider a club sanctioned by either [[USA Diving]] or [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU Diving]].  In USA Diving, Future Champions is the entry level or novice diver category with 8 levels of competition. From Future Champions, divers graduate to "Junior Olympic", or JO.  JO divers compete in age groups at inter-club competitions, at invitationals, and if qualified, at regional, zone and national competitions.  Divers over the age of 19 years of age cannot compete in these events as a JO diver.

USA Diving sanctions the Winter Nationals championship with one, three meter, and platform events.  In the summer USA Diving sanctions the Summer Nationals including all three events with both Junior and Senior divers. USA Diving is sanctioned by the [[United States Olympic Committee]] to select team representatives for international diving competitions including the World Championships and Olympic Games.

AAU Diving sanctions one national event per year in the summer.  AAU competes on the one, three, and tower to determine the All-American team.

====College diving====
[[File:University of Houston Natatorium.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Houston]]'s CRWC Natatorium is home to the United States' largest collegiate swimming pool]]
In the United States scholastic diving at the college level requires one and three meter diving.  Scores from the one and three meter competition contribute to the swim team's overall meet score.  College divers interested in tower diving may compete in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] separate from swim team events.  NCAA Divisions II and III do not usually compete platform; if a diver wishes to compete platform in college, he or she must attend a Division I school.

Each division also has rules on the number of dives in each competition.  Division II schools compete with 10 dives in competition whereas Division III schools compete with 11. Division I schools only compete with 6 dives in competition.  These 6 dives consist of either 5 optionals and 1 voluntary, or 6 optionals.  If the meet is a 5 optional meet, then the divers will perform 1 optional from each category (Front, Back, Inward, Reverse, and Twister) and then 1 voluntary from the category of their choice.  The voluntary in this type of meet is always worth a DD (Degree of Difficulty) of 2.0 even if the real DD is worth more or less on a DD sheet.  In a 6 optional meet, the divers will yet again perform one dive from each category, but this time they will perform a 6th optional from the category of their choosing, which is worth its actual DD from the DD sheet.

The highest level of collegiate competition is the NCAA Division 1 Swimming and Diving Championship.  Events at the championship include 1 meter springboard, 3 meter springboard, and platform, as well as various swimming individual and relay events.  The points scored by swimmers and divers are combined to determine a team swimming &amp; diving champion.  To qualify for a diving event at the NCAA championships, a competitor must first finish in the top three at one of five zone championships, which are held after the various conference championship meets.  A diver who scores at least 310 points on the 3 meter springboard and 300 points on the 1 meter springboard in a 6 optional meet can participate in the particular zone championship corresponding to the geographic region in which his or her school lies.

A number of colleges and universities offer scholarships to men and women who have competitive diving skills.  These scholarships are usually offered to divers with age-group or club diving experience.

The NCAA limits the number of years a college student can represent any school in competitions.  The limit is four years, but could be less under certain circumstances.

====Masters' Diving====
Divers who continue diving past their college years can compete in Masters' Diving programs.  Masters' diving programs are frequently offered by college or club programs.

Masters' Diving events are normally conducted in age-groups separated by five or ten years, and attract competitors of a wide range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters' Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organized competition.

==Non-competitive diving==

Diving is also popular as a non-competitive activity. Such diving usually emphasizes the airborne experience, and the height of the dive, but does not emphasize what goes on once the diver enters the water.  The ability to dive underwater can be a useful emergency skill, and is an important part of watersport and navy safety training. Entering water from a height is an enjoyable leisure activity, as is underwater [[Human swimming|swimming]].

Such non-competitive diving can occur indoors and outdoors.  Outdoor diving typically takes place from cliffs or other rock formations either into fresh or salt water.  However, man-made diving platforms are sometimes constructed in popular swimming destinations.  Outdoor diving requires knowledge of the water depth and currents as conditions can be dangerous.
On occasion, the diver will inadvertently belly flop, entering the water horizontally or nearly so. The diver typically displaces a larger than usual amount of water.

==High diving==
{{Main article|High diving}}
A recently developing section of the sport is ''High Diving'' (e.g. see [[2013 World Aquatics Championships]]), conducted in open air locations, usually from improvised platforms up to {{convert|27|m|sp=us}} high (as compared with {{convert|10|m|sp=us}} as used in Olympic and World Championship events). Entry to the water is invariably feet-first to avoid the risk of injury that would be involved in head-first entry from that height. The final half-somersault is almost always performed backwards, enabling the diver to spot the entry point and control their rotation.

[[File:Afl grand final.jpg|thumb|Part of the pre-match celebrations at the AFL Grand Final, unfurling of the banners of every club in the competition]]
A '''grand final''' is a game that decides a [[sports league]]'s championship (or premiership) winning team, i.e. the conclusive game of a finals (or play-off) series. Synonymous with a [[championship game]] in North American sports, grand finals have become a significant part of [[Australian culture]].  The earliest competitions to feature a grand final were Australia's [[Australian Football League|AFL]] (Australian rules football) and [[National Rugby League|NRL]] (rugby league football). They influenced other competitions such as soccer's [[A-League]], the [[National Basketball League (Australia)|National Basketball League]], netball's [[Suncorp Super Netball]] and European rugby league's [[Super League]] to adopt grand finals as well. Most grand finals involve a prestigious award for the player voted best on field.

==History==
&lt;!--This section seems to have no relationship to the history of the term "grand final", which is presumably short for "grand final match", a "final match" which is "grand", quite a trivial matter--&gt;

The [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] term "grand" to describe a sporting event, documented in England as "grand match" in 1836,&lt;ref name=oed&gt;Oxford English Dictionary 2nd. ed, grand (9A)&lt;/ref&gt; was used in Australia from the 1850s. A [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechase]] in England has been called the "[[Grand National]] Steeple Chase" ("Grand National" alone for short) since at least 1839.&lt;ref name=oed/&gt;

Use of the term in Australian Football dates back to the first organised and widely publicised match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College, Melbourne|Scotch College]] on 7 August 1858 at [[Yarra Park, Melbourne]] (formerly Richmond Park). The game was advertised as the "grand football match" in the Melbourne Morning Herald and several other local newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Melbourne Morning Herald. 7 August 1858&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1859, a "grand football match" was advertised in [[Richmond, Tasmania]] for [[St Patrick's Day]] on Friday 18 March.&lt;ref&gt;http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/2467822&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]]'' of 1861, the Royal Caledonian Society of Melbourne invited clubs to compete in a "grand football-match" which was to be football's first ever trophy, the [[Caledonian Challenge Cup]], however the match did not proceed until the following year.

The earliest known event described as "grand" in Sydney was a [[cricket]] match in 1862.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rl1908.com/clubcomps/grand-final.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1871 [[South Yarra Challenge Cup]], Carlton and Melbourne drew their three matches, but also won their remaining matches (against Albert Park and South Yarra). As head-to-head record was the only tiebreaker at that time, the team captains and the Cup organisers arranged a "grand match", as advertised in ''The Argus'' to decide the premiership. Carlton won by two goals to nil.

Initially, a football premiership final appeared to be called a "grand final" only when the losers of a final were the minor premiers and they exercised the "right to challenge" the winners to a second premiership decider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===South Australian Football Association===
{{main|1889 SAFA Grand Final}}
Prior to 1898, the [[SANFL|South Australian Football Association (SAFA, now SANFL)]] was awarded to the team that finished top of the end-of-season ladder placings.

In 1889, [[Norwood Football Club|Norwood]] and [[Port Adelaide Magpies|Port Adelaide]] finished equal first, meaning a play off match was required to determine the premiers. In promoting the decider match, local press referred to the match as a "premiership match".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199877014 |title=Advertising |newspaper=[[Evening Journal (Adelaide)|Evening Journal]] |volume=XXI |issue=5955 |location=Adelaide |date=4 October 1889 |accessdate=3 February 2018 |page=1|edition=SECOND |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was played on October 5, and Norwood won the match 7.4 to 5.9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article24485812 |title=THE FIGHT FOR THE PREMIERSHIP. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=7 October 1889 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894, [[Norwood Football Club|Norwood]] and [[South Adelaide Football Club|South Adelaide]] finished with a 13-5 record from their 18 matches. The match was fixed for October 6, and despite a provision for 20 minute periods of extra time in the event of a draw at full time, the match was abandoned due to darkness with the scores level at 4.8 apiece.

The SAFA fixed a replay for October 10, Labor Day: this was the first of seven grand final replays in elite Australian football history.
Norwood won the replay 4.7 to South Adelaide 3.5 with a goal from Bos Daly as the final bell rang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article0 |title=The Final Struggle|newspaper=[[South Australian Chronicle]] |location=Adelaide |date=13 October 1894 |accessdate=12 August 2013 |page=15 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victorian Football Association===
In the Victorian Football Association, which was Victoria's top level of senior football from 1877 until 1896, the premiership was typically awarded solely on the basis of the rostered premiership matches (known today as the home-and-away season). However, the rules stipulated that where two or more teams finished equal on premiership points, a playoff match or matches would be scheduled amongst those teams to determine the premiers.

This was required in [[1896 VFA season|1896]], when {{AFL SM}} and {{AFL Col}} finished level on top of the ladder with records of 14 wins and one draw. The [[1896 VFA season#Playoff match|playoff match]] between them, which is retrospectively treated as Victoria's first Grand Final, was won by Collingwood 6.9 – 5.10.&lt;ref name="rd20" /&gt;

There was one previous premiership playoff match during this time in the VFA between {{AFL Mel}} and {{AFL Gee}} in [[1878 VFA season|1878]], but this match did not break a tie at the top of the ladder, as Geelong already had a better win-loss record than Melbourne:  the match was organized by the VFA to resolve a dispute between the two clubs.&lt;ref name="rd20"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne|date=28 September 1896|title=Football Notes|page=6|author=Observer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Victorian Football League --&gt; Australian Football League===
In 1897, when eight teams broke away from the [[Victorian Football League|VFA]] to form the [[Australian Football League|VFL]], the concept of finals football was high on the agenda, with teams buoyed by the success and attendances of the 1896 Grand Final. Over the following ten years, all top-level Australian football leagues adopted a finals structure.

In 1931 the [[Australian Football League|VFL]] adopted a system, the [[Page–McIntyre system]], which ensured a grand final, and the concept became entrenched.

=== New South Wales Rugby Football League ===
The [[New South Wales Rugby Football League]] (NSWRFL) experimented with a finals system in 1908, its inaugural year, but abandoned it the following season. Finals were reintroduced in 1926, and the premiership decider appeared to only be called a "grand final" if it involved the minor premiers.

By the 1930s, the NSWRFL adopted the term "grand final" to describe the premiership decider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 4 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Up until 1954 a 'grand final' match was only held if the [[minor premiers]] were beaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The start of a grand tradition|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sCtWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=w-QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4824,495857|accessdate=10 December 2011|newspaper=[[The Sun-Herald]]|date=1 March 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adoption of the VFL's Page–McIntyre system for the [[1954 NSWRFL season]] meant for the first time grand finals would become necessary every season, so the term grand final has become used to describe all premiership deciders.

The tradition is maintained by the present-day NRL [[National Rugby League]].

===Europe===
The term "Grand Final" was introduced to Europe in 1995{{Citation needed|date=October 2012|reason=need to document that 1995 is first use}} in a completely different sport—golf. In that year, the [[Challenge Tour]], the official developmental tour for the [[PGA European Tour|European Tour]], launched its season-ending [[Challenge Tour Grand Final]]. British rugby league would adopt the term in 1998, two years after the start of [[Super League]]. The [[Super League Grand Final]] has now become an accepted part of the British scene, and the term 'grand final' is used to describe the final of leagues below Super League as well, such as the [[Championship (rugby league)|Championship]], [[Championship 1]] and the [[Rugby League Conference|Conference]]. Prior to this, a ''Championship Final'' was introduced to determine the winner of the British [[Rugby Football League Championship]] in 1904, though it only became a regular fixture from 1906 onwards. In 1973, the competition format was changed so that the championship was won by the team finishing top of the league table, with an end of season knock-out competition for the top teams that became known as the ''[[Rugby League Premiership|Premiership]]'' being created.

Starting in [[2009–10 Celtic League|2009–10]], the [[rugby union]] competition historically known as the [[Pro14|Celtic League]], at the time involving teams from Ireland, [[Scotland]] and [[Wales]], introduced a playoff system to determine its champion. (Although the league conducted a knockout competition in its early years, it was a parallel cup competition instead of a championship tournament.) The final match was branded as a grand final. This usage continued for the [[2010–11 Celtic League|2010–11 season]], the first that included teams from Italy. Starting with the [[2011–12 Pro 12|2011–12 season]], the first under the current sponsored name of RaboDirect Pro12, the "Grand Final" terminology was scrapped; the final match is now simply called the "Final".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabodirectpro12.com/final/index.php |title=Final Homepage |publisher=Celtic Rugby Limited |accessdate=20 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grand final replays==
A grand final replay is a method of deciding the winner of a competition when a grand final is drawn by replaying the entire match the following week, rather than playing [[Overtime (sports)|overtime or extra time]] on the same day. It is commonly used in [[Australian rules football]] and most notably in the [[Australian Football League]], where it has been used three times, most recently in [[2010 AFL Grand Final|2010]], however the AFL decided that replays will no longer decide grand finals that end as a draw, rather replacing it with extra time.

==Grand final breakfast==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
Most sports leagues in Australia have a grand final breakfast to mark the beginning to grand final day. It is a social highlight on the Australian sporting calendar. Watching the event is a ritual for many footy fans and the function plays a huge role in the pre match build up for the grand final. The [[North Melbourne Football Club]] host the [[North Melbourne Grand Final Breakfast]] and the [[National Rugby League]] host the [[NRL Grand Final Breakfast]] at [[Sydney Convention and Exhibition Centre]] in [[Darling Harbour]] normally. [[Messenger Premier League]] also have a grand final breakfast.

'''HC MVD''' ({{lang-ru|ХК МВД}}) was a professional [[ice hockey]] club based in [[Balashikha]], [[Moscow Oblast]], [[Russia]]. They were members of the Tarasov Division of the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]. They are best known for winning the silver medal in the KHL backstopped by all star goaltender [[Michael Garnett]] in 2010. The team merged with [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] to form [[HC Dynamo Moscow|UHC Dynamo]] after the [[2009–10 KHL season|2009–10 season]].

Since the [[2009–10 MHL season|season 2009–10]] was formed the new team Sheriff Balashikha as a farm team of [[HC Dynamo Moscow]] in the newly created [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|JHL]].

In the season 2010/2011, after the unification of the basic commands HC MVD and [[HC Dynamo Moscow]] into the [[HC Dynamo Moscow|United Hockey Club "Dynamo" (Moscow)]], farm clubs of the same teams were also united and made their debut in the restructured Higher Hockey League [[Supreme Hockey League|VHL]] as part of the newly formed "Dinamo" (Tver), and the youth team, dubbed Sheriff Balashikha [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|JHL]], was moved to Tver to home arena the Ice Palace of sports "Jubilee".

In the season 2011/2012, both farm teams, the youth — renamed [[Dynamo Balashikha]] (in the [[Supreme Hockey League|VHL]]), and the junior hockey team, renamed HC MVD-junior (playing in the [[Junior Hockey League (Russia)|JHL]]), returned to the town [[Balashikha]] near [[Moscow]] with home ice Palace "Balashikha-arena". At this time in the Junior League, the team plays on the name of HC MVD.
 
==History==

MVD Moscow Oblast was founded in 1949 as Spartak [[Tver|Kalinin]], and adopted its last name, MVD, in 2004 as part of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs]] and their move to [[Podolsk]]. In the same year, they qualified for the [[Russian Superleague]] play-off for the first time, losing to [[Ak Bars Kazan]] in a hard-fought series. In 2007, they moved again (this time to [[Balashikha]]) for the KHL size arena.

'''Hinkle Fieldhouse''' is a [[basketball]] arena located on the campus of [[Butler University]] in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States]]. When built in 1928, it was the largest basketball arena in the United States, a distinction it retained until 1950. It is the sixth-oldest college basketball arena still in use, and it is a U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]]. It is among the earliest of the major college fieldhouses, which, along with rules changes that made for a faster game, transformed college basketball in the late 1920s and 1930s.&lt;ref name=nrhpinv3/&gt;

Hinkle Fieldhouse is nicknamed '''"Indiana's Basketball Cathedral"''' due to the rich history it has played in the development of basketball in Indiana, also to distinguish it from The [[Palestra]], known as "The Cathedral of College Basketball."

==History==
Hinkle Fieldhouse and the 36,000-seat [[Butler Bowl]] football stadium were two of the first buildings erected when the university moved to the Fairview campus. The facilities were promoted by a corporation of 41 Indianapolis businessmen who viewed it as a prize for the city as well as for Butler. When Butler signed a lease with the [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]] to host the high school state tournament, the corporation agreed to finance the building at a cost of $1,000,000.

In 1933, the interior was reconfigured, moving the court from an east-west orientation to a north-south position. In the initial arrangement, over half of the seats were at the ends of the court, while event viewing is typically better from the sides. [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]] hosted the high school tourney from 1928 to 1971, except for 1943–1945, when the building housed the US Army Air Forces and US Navy as a barracks during [[World War II]].

Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted the annual state [[Indiana High School Boy's Basketball Tournament|high school basketball championship]] games, including the ''[[Milan miracle|Milan Miracle]]'', the memorable [[1954 Milan High School basketball team|1954 victory]] of tiny [[Milan High School (Indiana)|Milan High School]] over the much larger [[Muncie Central High School]]. The film ''[[Hoosiers (film)|Hoosiers]]'' is loosely based on that event and used Hinkle Fieldhouse and the memorable voices of original announcers [[Hilliard Gates]] and [[Tom Carnegie]] in filming the climactic game of the popular movie.&lt;ref name="jbranchnyt"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/sports/ncaabasketball/17butler.html?ref=sports Branch, John. "It's the Bricks That Make Butler Basketball Special," ''[[The New York Times]]'', Wednesday, March 17, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Underwood was the radio announcer. With the exception of an occasional high school showcase, high school basketball games are rarely contested at Hinkle Fieldhouse any more, and [[Indiana High School Athletic Association]] state basketball tournament games are played elsewhere.

A major $1.5 million facelift in 1989 reduced the [[seating capacity]] from 15,000 to 11,043, as well as renovating the main reception area, basketball offices, film rooms and team locker rooms. The other athletic and physical education offices, sports locker rooms, and fitness facilities at the fieldhouse were renovated as well in 1992. Hinkle Fieldhouse hosted the entire 1994 [[Horizon League]] men's basketball conference tournament as well as parts of the 2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010 Horizon League tournaments.

The fieldhouse was originally called '''Butler Fieldhouse''', but was renamed in 1966 to honor [[Tony Hinkle|Paul D. "Tony" Hinkle]] (1899–1992), who was basketball coach at Butler for 41 seasons ending in 1970.&lt;ref name="jbranchnyt"/&gt; In 1983, it was placed on the National Register of Historic Places, and on February 27, 1987, it was designated as a [[National Historic Landmark]] in recognition of its role in transforming college basketball.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NHLS url|id=83003573}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Butler Fieldhouse / Hinkle Fieldhouse| date=October 1985 |author=James H.

In 2006, to celebrate Butler University's 150th anniversary, a documentary about Hinkle Fieldhouse aired on [[ESPN]] entitled ''Indiana's Basketball Cathedral''.

=== Renovation ===
In 2011, Butler University began the first phase of a renovation and restoration project. Capacity has been cut from 10,000 to 9,100. The gym that once held bleachers now has about 4,500 chair back seats and handrails line the aisles. That includes nearly all of the lower two levels except for some bleachers reserved for student seating. Small scoreboards occupy each of the four corners in addition to the main video board above midcourt.

A pool was attached to the west end of Hinkle, but the university closed it in 2002 due to the high maintenance costs. The athletic department had been using it since then as a storage area. During the renovation, the pool was converted into a three-level facility that includes a workout room on the first level, an academic center and a training facility on the second floor that is six times larger than the previous training facility, and Butler's athletic administrative offices and coaches' offices on the top level.

The men's and women's basketball offices are adjacent to their respective locker rooms just off the Hinkle floor, but they have been upgraded. The men's basketball locker room has been expanded and Butler has a separate video room for the first time. Former Butler standout and current [[Boston Celtics]] player [[Gordon Hayward]] donated the funds for the renovation.

"The scoreboards on the side are new, but it still has a historic feel," Butler senior guard Alex Barlow said. "It still has a lot of modern upgrades that fans like to see. If you see the locker room and the weight room and the training room, it's come a long way since I've gotten here."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/college/butler/2014/10/30/hinkle-fieldhouse-keeps-charm-renovation/18210121/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulldogs still play on the original floor, which has been used longer than any playing surface in Division I.

==Events==
The Fieldhouse has hosted to U.S. presidents ([[Herbert Hoover]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], [[George H.W. Bush]], and [[Bill Clinton]]), Evangelist [[Billy Graham]], ice shows, professional basketball teams, Olympic basketball trials, the first USSR-USA basketball game, all-star basketball games for the [[NBA]], [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] and the East-West College All-Stars, national indoor track events, tennis matches of both [[Bill Tilden]] and [[Jack Kramer]], national equestrian events, the roller derby, a six-day bicycle race, a three ring circus, as well as the volleyball matches during the [[1987 Pan American Games]]. The [[1940 NCAA Basketball Tournament]] East Regionals were held there, won by the eventual national champion [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana Hoosiers]]. Until 1978, those games were the only NCAA tournament games held within the city. With 15,000 spectators, the volleyball match was the highest-attended volleyball match ever held in the United States.

'''John Player Ground''' was a [[cricket]] ground in [[Nottingham]], [[Nottinghamshire]].  The first recorded match on the ground was in 1955, when the Midlands and East of England Women played the North and West of England Women.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Grounds/11/662_misc.html Other matches played on John Player Ground]&lt;/ref&gt;  

The ground held its first [[List-A cricket|List-A]] match in 1970 when [[Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club|Nottinghamshire]] played [[Hampshire County Cricket Club|Hampshire]] in the [[John Player League]].

'''[[Kuwait]]''' has competed in 12 [[Summer Olympic Games|Summer Games]]. To date, Kuwait has won two bronze [[Olympic medal]]s and the Kuwaiti shooter [[Fehaid Al-Deehani]] won a gold medal as an [[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics|independent athlete]]. 

In the [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Barcelona Games]], Kuwait received a bronze medal in the then-[[demonstration sport]] of [[taekwondo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Al-Ahram Weekly On-line |title=Three for the Arabs |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/501/sp1.htm |date=28 Sep – 4 Oct 2000 |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110404173239/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2000/501/sp1.htm |archivedate=2011-04-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first Olympic medal was a bronze for [[Shooting at the 2000 Summer Olympics – Men's double trap|double trap shooting]], won by [[Fehaid Al-Deehani]] at the [[2000 Olympics]] in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]]. Their second was also a bronze won by Al-Deehani in the [[Shooting at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's trap|men's trap]] at the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in [[London]]. In 2016, Al-Deehani won the gold medal for [[Shooting at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's double trap|men's double trap]] as an [[Independent Olympic Athletes at the 2016 Summer Olympics|independent athlete]]. 

The National Olympic Committee for Kuwait was formed in 1957. It was recognized by the [[International Olympic Committee]] in 1966, but has been suspended twice in the past ten years. Due to its most recent suspension, Kuwait was not allowed to compete as a sovereign state at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], though the nation's participants were able to compete as [[Independent Olympic Athletes]] under the Olympic flag.

[[File:WikiLando.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Los Angeles Galaxy]] star [[Landon Donovan]] joined English [[Premier League]] club [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on loan from January 2010 until the start of the [[2010 Major League Soccer season|2010 MLS season]].]]
In [[sport]]s, a '''loan''' involves a particular player being able to temporarily play for a club other than the one he is currently contracted to. Loan deals may last from a few weeks to all season-long and can persist for multiple seasons.

Players may be loaned out to other clubs for several reasons. Most commonly, young [[Prospect (sports)|prospects]] will be loaned to a club in a lower league in order to gain valuable [[first team]] experience. In this instance, the parent club may continue to pay the player's wages in full or in part. Some clubs put a formal arrangement in place with a [[Farm team|feeder club]] for this purpose, such as [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thenational.ae/sport/football/antwerp-connection-is-a-belgium-delight-for-manchester-united |title= Antwerp connection is a Belgium delight for Manchester United |last= Mitten |first= Andy |date= 9 March 2012 |website= thenational.ae |publisher= [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]] |accessdate= 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2332561/Former-Chelsea-striker-Jimmy-Floyd-Hasselbaink-new-coach-Manchester-Uniteds-partner-club-Royal-Antwerp.html |title= Former Chelsea hitman Hasselbaink takes over as coach at Manchester United's partner club Royal Antwerp |last= Skillen |first= Charlie |date= 29 May 2013 |website= dailymail.co.uk |publisher= [[The Daily Mail]] |accessdate= 22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[K.S.K.

A club may take a player on loan if they are short on transfer funds but can still pay wages, or as temporary cover for injuries or suspensions. The parent club might demand a fee or that the loaning club pays some or all of the player's wages during the loan period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://tottenhamhotspur.blogspot.com/2007/06/football-transfers-explained.html
  | accessdate = 2008-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A club might seek to loan out a squad player to make a saving on his wages, or a first team player to regain match fitness following an injury.

A loan may be made to get around a [[transfer window]]. Such a loan might include an agreed fee for a permanent transfer when the next transfer window opens.

Some players are loaned because they are unhappy or in dispute with their current club and no other club wishes to buy them permanently. Examples of this situation include [[Henri Camara]] with [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], [[Craig Bellamy]] with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and [[Darren Bent]] with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]].

In the [[Premier League]], players on loan are not permitted to play against the team which holds their registration (section 7.2 of rule M.6). Loanees are, however, allowed to play against their 'owning' clubs in cup competitions, unless they have played for their owning club in that cup during that season.

==Unpaid trialists==

In the [[Scottish Professional Football League]] (and previously the [[Scottish Football League]]), clubs are permitted to take players on as unpaid trialists even for competitive fixtures. Sometimes for the first two weeks of a trial period players' names are obfuscated; match reports use the convention "A Trialist" to refer to such players in lieu of using their real names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.spfl.co.uk/docs/067_324__therulesofthespfl_1375800603.pdf |title=The Rules of the Scottish Professional Football League |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{spanish name 2|Anaya|Merino}}
'''Luis Alonso Anaya Merino''' (Born May 19, 1981, in [[San José Guayabal]], [[El Salvador]]) is a former Salvadoran professional [[Association football|football]] player.

==Club career==
Anaya started his senior career at local side San José, before moving to [[Segunda División de Fútbol Salvadoreño|Salvadoran Second Division]] side [[C.D. Platense Municipal Zacatecoluca|Platense]] where he stayed for almost 8 years.

In May 2005, he made his debut on the [[Salvadoran Primera División|highest domestic level]] for Salvadoran giants [[C.D. FAS|FAS]] against [[C.D. Águila|Águila]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubdeportivofas.com/Plantillas/Fichas/03_Luis_Anaya.html Player profile] - CD FAS {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he joined after winning the 2005 Clausura title with [[CD FAS|FAS]] a month after that debut.

In 2008, he signed with [[C.D. Chalatenango|Chalatenango]], only to move on to [[Alianza F.C.|Alianza]] in the same year.

He joined [[C.D. UES|CD UES]] for the 2010 Apertura season.

==International career==
Anaya officially received his first cap on October 7, 2006, in a friendly match against [[Panama national football team|Panama]].

He scored his first goal for the national team on August 22, 2007, in a friendly match against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].

His second, and most important goal came almost a year later on June 22, 2008, in a [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Second Round|FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Panama national football team|Panama]].

His 87th-minute goal, led El Salvador to a 3–1 win, and in doing so helped secured the national team a spot in the following round of qualification.

He has earned a total of 35 caps, scoring 2 goals. He has represented his country in 8 [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] matches&lt;ref&gt;{{FIFA player|276786|Luis Anaya}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and played at the [[2007 UNCAF Nations Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/gold-cam07det.html| title=UNCAF (Qualifying Tournament for Gold Cup) 2007 - Details| dead-url=no| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024034751/http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/gold-cam07det.html |archivedate=2008-10-24| publisher=RSSSF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a non-playing squad member at the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/07gc-full.html#squads| title=CONCACAF Championship, Gold Cup 2007 - Full Details| dead-url=no| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024002319/http://www.rsssf.com/tables/07gc-full.html |archivedate=2008-10-24| publisher=RSSSF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He did not play for his country since an October 2008 [[FIFA World Cup qualification]] match against [[Suriname national football team|Suriname]] and was only over two years later called up for the [[2011 Copa Centroamericana]] by then coach [[José Luis Rugamas]].

With [[Rubén Israel]] as coach, Anaya was called up to take part at the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] where he earned 4 caps in 4 games.

Anaya received two yellow cards at the semi-finals match against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] for complaining.

In a frinedly match against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]], on 7 August 2011, Anaya was sent off with two yellow cards, because he complained and celebrated in front of the technical area of the Venezuelans.

On September 20, 2013, Anaya was one of 14 Salvadoran players banned for life due to their involvement with match fixing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-24184567 |title= El Salvador match-fixing: 14 footballers banned for life |publisher= BBC |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4899">The '''Never Miss a Super Bowl Club''' (or the '''NMASB Club''') is a group of people that was popularized in a [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] commercial in 2010. They have attended every [[Super Bowl]] since 1967.&lt;ref name=WTSP&gt;{{cite web|title="Never Miss a Super Bowl Club" turns 44|url=http://www.wtsp.com/news/mostpop/story.aspx?storyid=124639&amp;provider=top|publisher=[[WTSP]]|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As shown on the commercial, the group consisted of four people, although it was announced in February 2011 that one member would not be able to attend that year's game.

==Background==
The club was first popularized by [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] as part of an advertising campaign called ''Go Fans''. The commercial was narrated by [[Morgan Freeman]]. Surveys have shown that most respondents would be willing to miss or postpone major events in their life, including the birth of their child or a wedding date, to see the [[Super Bowl]]. As a result, Visa came up with an advertising campaign to feature four men who have attended every Super Bowl since the first one in 1967.&lt;ref name=Visa&gt;{{cite web|title=Visa Features Four Fans who Attended Every Super Bowl in New Ads as Part of the Super Bowl Trip for Life: Passion for Super Bowl is Unrivaled According to a National Survey by Visa|url=http://corporate.visa.com/media-center/press-releases/press1062.jsp|publisher=[[Visa Inc.|Visa]]|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four men were [[New England Patriots]] fan Don Crisman, [[San Francisco 49ers]] fan Larry Jacobson, [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] fan Thomas Henschel, and [[Green Bay Packers]] fan Robert Cook. The commercial itself featured the four men holding up tickets for 44 years of Super Bowls. At one point, there were five members, but one became immobile after turning 80.&lt;ref name=WSAW&gt;{{cite web|title=Group of Friends Has Never Missed Superbowl (sic)|url=http://www.wsaw.com/home/headlines/83632877.html|publisher=[[WSAW]]|accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, another person who had also gone to every Super Bowl game, Gregory Eaton, met the three remaining members and officially joined the club.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.startribune.com/three-men-52-years-and-a-vow-to-always-be-at-the-super-bowl/472267413/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promotion==
A promotion was also run during the commercial. ''The Super Bowl Trip for Life Sweepstakes'' stated that anyone who used their Visa card between September 9 and December 31, 2010, would be entered to win a chance to see the Super Bowl for life. Winners would receive round-trip airfare, accommodations, and tickets to the Super Bowl.&lt;ref name=Visa /&gt;  In 2011, it was announced that Tyler Weber, then 24 years old, won the contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Blaisdell|first=Elaine|title=LaVale man winner of Visa’s Super Bowl for Life contest|url=http://times-news.com/local/x1527122165/LaVale-man-winner-of-Visa-s-Super-Bowl-for-Life-contest|work=Cumberland Times-News|accessdate=7 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Loss of a member==
In early February 2011, it was announced that 79-year-old Robert Cook would be unable to attend [[Super Bowl XLV]] after being hospitalized in [[Wisconsin]]. His daughters were expected to attend the game in his place.&lt;ref name=Latimes&gt;{{cite news|title=1 in 'Never Missed a Super Bowl' club hospitalized, will miss game with his beloved Packers|url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/football/nfl/wire/sns-ap-fbn-super-bowl-never-missed,0,2482719.story |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=5 February 2011 |accessdate=6 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cook in hospital, unable to attend game|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/never-miss-a-super-bowl-club-member-in-hospital-020511|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=6 February 2011|date=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Never missed a Super Bowl' member passes away|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Never-Missed-Super-Bowl-Club-member-dies-021411?GT1=39002|publisher=Fox Sports|accessdate=14 February 2011|date=February 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The remaining three members of the club have continued their tradition through at least [[Super Bowl LI]].

In October 2017, member Larry Jacobson, 78, of San Francisco, CA passed away. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/sfgate/obituary.aspx?n=lawrence-jacobson&amp;pid=187109526|title=Lawrence Jacobson's Obituary on San Francisco Chronicle|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==New members==
On [[Super Bowl LII]] a new member Gregory Eaton joined the club to bring it back to 3 members.
Also joined is honorary member Heather Jacobson,the daughter of Larry Jacobson,who was one of the original 4 members

'''Nymeo Field at Harry Grove Stadium''', located in [[Frederick, Maryland]], is the home of the [[Frederick Keys]], a class A minor league affiliate of the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. Opened in 1990, it seats 5,400 fans.

==History==
[[File:Harry Grove Stadium.jpg|thumb|left|Harry Grove Stadium in August 2009.]]
The stadium is named for Harry Grove, who was one of the founders of the Frederick Hustlers, a professional team that existed between 1915 and the [[World War II]] era.  The Grove family also donated $250,000 to the city to help build the park and were thus honored in the naming of it.  Another $1 million was provided by the city of Frederick along with $1.5 million provided by the state of Maryland and $250,000 from [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]].&lt;ref name="Boys of Summer"&gt;{{cite news |title=The Boys of Summers Past; Cherished Memories Resurface as Baseball Returns to Frederick|first=Paul|last=Duggan|url=http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=732069082&amp;sid=1&amp;Fmt=2&amp;clientId=4807&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=HNP|format=[[PDF]]|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=January 12, 1989|accessdate=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2005 Class A all-star game, pitting the [[Carolina League]] against the [[California League]], was played in Harry Grove Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Frederick to Be Star-Struck|first=Stan|last=Goldberg|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/archives/frederick-to-be-star-struck/article_892754b1-94dc-5b1d-97db-ff37697b8e37.html|newspaper=[[Frederick News-Post]]|date=June 28, 2005|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry Grove Stadium has also hosted various concerts.  On August 19, 2006, [[Bob Dylan]] played to a sell-out crowd during his third annual 'Summer Minor League Baseball Park Tour'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Knockin' on Frederick's Door|first=Katie E.|last=Leslie|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/archives/article_c693fadc-911a-52ed-b4b3-65e232cba878.html?mode=jqm|newspaper=[[Frederick News-Post]]|date=August 20, 2006|accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Wrestling Entertainment]] (WWE) has made it an annual summer stop on its live event tours, a rarity in that the stadium is an outdoor venue.

Harry Grove Stadium also serves host to several autocross clubs, who use the lower lot for their autocross course.

==Renovations==
In 2006, Keys ownership began a project to revitalize Harry Grove Stadium. Renovations have included a new field, seating section, suite level restoration and a new lighting system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Keys' Stadium Getting New Playing Field|first=Joseph M.|last=deLeon|url=http://www.fredericknewspost.com/archives/article_131f3e41-492d-52f1-986c-5a7d4e20a3c1.html?mode=jqm|newspaper=[[Frederick News-Post]]|date=September 20, 2006|accessdate=May 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Darren Gough bowling.jpg|thumb|left|200px|English cricketer [[Darren Gough]] about to deliver the ball overarm-style.]]
{{Cricket deliveries}}
In [[cricket]], '''overarm bowling''' refers to a delivery in which the bowler's hand is above shoulder height.

When cricket originated all bowlers delivered the ball [[underarm bowling|underarm]], where the bowler's hand is below waist height. However, so the story goes, John Willes became the first bowler to use a "round-arm" technique after practising with his sister Christine Willes, who had used the technique, as she was unable to bowl underarm due to her wide and huge skirt impeding her delivery of the ball.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cricketweb.net/resources/history/index.php John Willes and his sister invent overarm bowling&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[roundarm bowling|roundarm]] delivery is where the hand is between shoulder height and waist height;

After roundarm was legalised in 1835 with the bowler allowed to deliver the ball at shoulder height, it was not long before some bowlers began to raise the hand above the shoulder.  The [[Laws of Cricket]] at that time directed that such a delivery be called a [[no-ball]].  In 1845, the law was strengthened by removing the benefit of doubt from the bowler in height of hand questions, the umpire's view of the incident being final.

Even so, it was only a matter of time before confrontation occurred.  The problem was that many umpires were themselves bowlers and believed that the bowler should be allowed to bowl with a fully raised hand.  The watershed was reached on 26 August 1862 at [[The Oval]] when Surrey hosted All-England.  The England bowler [[Edgar Willsher]] deliberately bowled overarm and was no-balled six times in succession by umpire [[John Lillywhite]], ironically the son of [[William Lillywhite]], the famous bowler who had done so much to have roundarm legalised in 1835.

In what was surely a pre-rehearsed demonstration, Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team staged a walk-off, leaving their two amateur colleagues looking non-plussed in the middle.  Play continued next day, but Lillywhite diplomatically withdrew and was replaced by another umpire.

[[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] responded to this "crisis" with rather more haste than they had to roundarm and changed the Laws of Cricket in time for the 1864 season.  Law 10 was rewritten to allow the bowler to bring his arm through at any height providing he kept it straight and did not throw the ball.  This completed the evolution of bowling and the overarm style has remained predominant ever since, though some conservatives (including [[W G Grace]], no less) did continue to bowl roundarm till the end of their careers; and even underarm itself was still seen occasionally.

An interesting historical development of the legalisation of overarm was that for many years, 1864 was deemed to mark the start of "first-class cricket" which suggested that earlier cricket was "second-class".  The 1864 origin has been strongly challenged: ''see also'' [[First-class cricket]].

== History ==
Rawlings was founded in [[St. Louis|Saint Louis]] in 1887, during the middle of the [[Long Depression]], by George and Alfred Rawlings. The brothers set up a sporting goods store with its own catalog. They sold "Fishing Tackle, Guns, Baseball, Football, Golf, Polo, Tennis, Athletic and General Sporting Goods".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/rawlings-sporting-goods-co-inc-history/ Rawlings Sporting Goods Co., Inc. History]&lt;br/&gt;The company was founded in 1887 by George and Alfred Rawlings, brothers who opened a small store in St. Louis. Its first catalogue characterized the company as "Dealers in Fishing Tackle, Guns, Baseball, Football, Golf, Polo, Tennis, Athletic and General Sporting Goods." The store soon went up in flames, so the Rawlings brothers got into manufacturing in 1898 in partnership with Charles W. Scudder, who put up the money.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company is credited with introducing football shoulder pads in 1902, and the first all-weather football.

=== Rawlings and Major League Baseball ===
Rawlings began providing the hometown [[St. Louis Cardinals]] with gloves in 1906.
[[File:Paul Lo Duca.jpg|thumb|Here is Paul Lo Duca, a Washington Nationals player, wearing a Rawlings catcher mitt.]]
In {{baseball year|1920}}, [[Bill Doak]], a pitcher for the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], suggested that a web be placed between the first finger and the thumb in order to create a pocket. This design soon became the standard for baseball gloves. Doak patented his design and sold it to Rawlings. His design became the precursor to modern gloves, and enabled Rawlings to become the preferred glove of professional players.&lt;ref name="Stamp"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stamp|first1=Jimmy|title=The Invention of the Baseball Mitt|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/the-invention-of-the-baseball-mitt-12799848/?no-ist|website=www.smithsonianmag.com|publisher=Smithsonian.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] bought Rawlings, and began using it to manufacture baseballs.

In 1957 the company introduced the [[Gold Glove]] award, which became the major award for baseball. It also sponsors the [[Minor League Baseball]] (MiLB) "[[Rawlings Woman Executive of the Year]]" award.

13 years after acquiring it, an [[anti-trust]] investigation forced Spalding to sell Rawlings again, but as it did so Spalding set up a contract that would have Rawlings manufacture baseballs to sell with the Spalding logo.

When this agreement ended in 1977, Rawlings began using its own logo, becoming the official supplier of the major leagues (producing separate balls for both the American and National Leagues from 1977 to 1999, and since 2000, a single ball for all of Major League Baseball), succeeding [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]], which had been the supplier for a century. All the balls supplied to the major and minor leagues are manufactured in Costa Rica.&lt;ref name="reuters2010"&gt;{{cite news|author = Leslie Josephs|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-costarica-baseballs-idUSTRE62831Z20100309 |title=Made in Costa Rica: U.S. Major League baseballs |work=Reuters |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional low-end versions are manufactured in China.&lt;ref name="renewamerica2006"&gt;{{cite news|author = Diane M.

Many major leaguers have endorsed Rawlings equipment over the years. There are four main series for the gloves: the Gold Glove Series, the Heritage Pro Series, the Heart of the Hide Series, the Pro Preferred Series and the Gold Glove Collection Series.

In 2003, [[K2 Sports|K2 Inc.]] acquired Rawlings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Newsdesk| first = Associated Press| title = K2 Acquires Rawlings| work = Ski Mag| accessdate = 2018-11-25| url = https://www.skimag.com/uncategorized/k2-acquires-rawlings}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Rawlings corporate headquarters were moved from [[Fenton, Missouri]], to [[Town and Country, Missouri]].&lt;ref name="Headquarters move"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Unknown|title=Rawlings to move HQ to Maryville Centre|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/08/15/daily24.html|accessdate=31 July 2014|work=St. Louis Business Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Jarden]] acquired K2 Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| issn = 0458-3035| last = Reuters| first = From| title = Jarden to acquire K2 in $765-million deal| work = Los Angeles Times| accessdate = 2018-11-25| date = 2007-04-26| url = http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/26/business/fi-k226}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 14, 2015, [[Newell Rubbermaid]] announced that it would acquire Jarden for over $15 billion of cash and stock.

It was announced on June 5, 2018 that Rawlings was sold from Newell Brands to the [[Los Angeles]]-based [[private equity firm]], Seidler Equity Partners (SEP) (which owns [[LA Fitness]]), with MLB a co-investor in the $395 million deal.

'''Shabab Rafah Sports Club''' ({{lang-ar|نادي شباب رفح الرياضي}}) or simply '''Shabab Rafah''' is a [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian]] [[association football|football]] team from the city of [[Rafah]] that plays in the [[Gaza Strip League]].

==History==
The club was founded in 1953 under the name of '''Al-Shoaba Club'''. In 1960, it changed the name to '''Al-Oruba Club'''. In 1962, the Egyptian administration in the Gaza Strip founded a Youth Care Foundation and parained the club who changed the name to '''Nadi Markaz Reayat Al-Shabab''' (Youth Care Center Club).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesp/palesfound.html |title=Palestine - List of Foundation Dates |work=[[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |publisher=Hassanin Mubarak |date=February 14, 2014 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967, the club's activities stopped until 1973, the year when some of the loyal club members worked for the reconstruction and the revival of the club under the new name of the '''Shabab Rafah Sports Club''' and it formed the first administrative body headed by '''Ali Mehdi'''.

'''''Speed Racer''''' is a 2008 [[sports film|sports]] [[action film|action]]-[[comedy film]] written and directed by [[The Wachowski Brothers]]&lt;!--Credited as "The Wachowski Brothers". Do not change without consensus. See the note. --&gt;{{efn|name=directors}} and based on the 1960s Japanese [[anime]] and [[manga]] series [[Speed Racer|of the same name]]. It stars [[Emile Hirsch]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Matthew Fox (actor)|Matthew Fox]], [[John Goodman]], [[Susan Sarandon]], [[Roger Allam]], [[Benno Fürmann]], [[Hiroyuki Sanada]], [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain]], and [[Richard Roundtree]]. The film is a joint American-German venture produced by [[Village Roadshow Pictures]], [[Silver Pictures]], [[The Wachowskis#Owned companies|Anarchos Productions]] and [[Babelsberg Studio]], and distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]. The plot revolves around Speed Racer, an 18-year-old automobile racer who follows his apparently deceased brother's career. His choice to remain loyal to his family and their company Racer Motors causes difficulties after he refuses a contract offered by E.P. Arnold Royalton, the owner of Royalton Industries.

The film had been in development since 1992, changing actors, writers, and directors until 2006, when producer [[Joel Silver]] and the Wachowskis collaborated to begin production on ''Speed Racer'' as a [[family film]]. ''Speed Racer'' was shot between early June and late August 2007 in and around [[Potsdam]] and [[Berlin]], with an estimated budget of $120 million. Its score was composed by [[Michael Giacchino]], and the film's soundtrack, which contains the sound effects and theme song from the original series, was released on May 6, 2008.

''Speed Racer'' premiered on April 26, 2008 at the [[Microsoft Theater|Nokia Theater]], and was released in regular theaters in North America on May 9, 2008. The film was considered a [[box office bomb]] due to only grossing $93 million worldwide on its $120 million budget plus marketing. It was subsequently nominated in multiple categories at the [[Teen Choice Awards]], and was nominated for the [[Golden Raspberry Awards]]. The film received generally negative reviews by the time of its release; it was criticized for its storyline, characters, dialogue, and critics were mixed with the use of special effects, but received praise for its capacity to entertain the target audience and the performance of its cast. Years later, however, the film received more praise, with some commentators calling it an "underrated" film.

==Plot==
Speed Racer is an 18-year-old whose life and love has always been automobile racing. His parents--Pops and Mom--run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, his mechanic Sparky, and his girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child, Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer. When Rex and Pops had a falling out, Rex ran away to race for other companies and gained a reputation for being a dirty racer and disgraced his family. Rex was apparently killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible) a deadly cross-country [[rallying|racing rally]]. Now embarking on his own career, Speed is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill behind the wheel of his brother's [[Mach 5]] and his own T-180 car, the Mach 6, although he is primarily interested in the art of the race and the well-being of his family.

E.P. Arnold Royalton, owner of conglomerate Royalton Industries, offers Speed an astoundingly luxurious lifestyle in exchange for signing to race with him. Though tempted, Speed declines due to his father's distrust of power-hungry corporations. Angered, Royalton reveals that for many years, key races have been [[match fixing|fixed]] by corporate interests, including himself, to gain profits. Royalton takes out his anger on Speed by having his drivers force Speed into a crash that destroys the Mach 6 and suing Racer Motors for [[intellectual property infringement]]. Speed gets an opportunity to retaliate through Inspector Detector, head of an intelligence agency's corporate crimes division. Racer Taejo Togokahn supposedly has evidence that could indict Royalton but will only offer it up if Speed and the mysterious masked [[Racer X (Speed Racer character)|Racer X]] agree to race on his team in the Casa Cristo 5000, which could also substantially raise the stock price of his family's racing business, blocking a Royalton-arranged buyout. Speed agrees but keeps his decision secret from his family, and Detector's team makes several defensive modifications to the Mach 5 to assist Speed in the rally.

After they drive together and work naturally as a team, Speed begins to suspect that Racer X is actually his brother Rex in disguise. His family discovers that he has entered the race and agree to support him. With the help of his family and Trixie, Speed defeats many brutal racers, who were bribed by fixer Cruncher Block to stop him, and overcomes seemingly insurmountable obstacles to win the race, while Detector's team arrests Block. However, Taejo's arrangement is revealed to be a sham, as he was only interested in increasing the value of his family's company to profit from Royalton's buyout. Enraged, Speed hits the track that he used to drive with his brother, and confronts Racer X with his suspicion that he is Rex. Racer X removes his mask, revealing an unfamiliar face, and tells Speed that Rex is indeed dead, but encourages Speed not to let what had transpired change his idea of racing. Speed plans to leave to clear his mind but returns home where he is confronted by Pops. Pops does not prevent Speed from leaving as he is proud of Speed for his cause despite it being in vain, and acknowledges that it was his own stubbornness that drove his son Rex away. Taejo's sister Horuko arrives and gives him Taejo's rejected automatic invitation to the Grand Prix. The Racer family bands together and builds a new Mach 6 in 32 hours.

Speed enters the Grand Prix against great odds; Royalton has placed a $1,000,000 bounty on his head that the other drivers are eager to collect, and he is pitted against future Hall of Fame driver Jack "Cannonball" Taylor. Speed overcomes a slow start to catch up with Taylor, who uses a cheating device called a spearhook to latch the Mach 6 to his own car. Speed uses his jump jacks to expose the device to video cameras, causing Taylor to crash. Speed wins the race, having successfully exposed Royalton's crimes. While Racer X watches it is revealed in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that he is indeed Rex, who had faked his death by detonating a bomb in his car in the caves and underwent [[plastic surgery]] to change his appearance as part of his plan to protect Speed and the sport of racing. He chooses not to reveal his identity to his family, declaring that he must live with his decision. The Racer family celebrates Speed's victory as Speed and Trixie kiss, and Royalton is sent to jail.

===Development===
In September 1992, [[Joe Pytka]] announced that Warner Bros. held the option to create a [[live action]] [[film adaptation]] of the 1960s Japanese anime and manga series ''[[Speed Racer]]'', in development at [[Silver Pictures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=BPI Communications |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-09-03/features/9203200425_1_speed-racer-art-houses-silver-pictures |title='Speed Racer' to become a film |work=Chicago Tribune |publisher=[[Tribune Company]] |date=September 3, 1992 |accessdate=September 3, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6PqJjrg7i?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-09-03/features/9203200425_1_speed-racer-art-houses-silver-pictures |archivedate=May 25, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1994, singer [[Henry Rollins]] was offered the role of Racer X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Matthew Gilbert | title=Workman's got the beats | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=October 9, 1994 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1995, [[Johnny Depp]] was cast into the lead role for ''Speed Racer'', with production slated to begin the coming October,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Pacino, Depp To Star in Film On FBI Agent | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] | publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] | date=June 20, 1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with filming to take place in [[California]] and [[Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sumner, Jane | title=Old commish now the new commish | work=[[The Dallas Morning News]] | publisher=[[A.

Visual effects designer [[John Gaeta]], who won an [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] for the Wachowskis' ''[[The Matrix]]'', was brought in to help conceive making ''Speed Racer'' into a live-action adaptation.

===Animal cruelty===
During its production, [[animal rights]] group [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] (PETA) made allegations of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] against the film, reporting that one of the two chimpanzees used in the production was allegedly beaten after biting an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.today.com/id/18024493 |title=PETA not monkeying around with 'Speed Racer' |author=Walls, Jeannette |date=November 7, 2007 |work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today.com]] |publisher=[[NBC|National Broadcasting Company]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QDLthbSG?url=http://www.today.com/id/18024493 |archivedate=June 10, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was confirmed by the [[American Humane Association]] (AHA) Animal Safety Representative on the set, who reported that the stand-in for the Spritle character portrayed by Litt had been bitten without provocation. The AHA representative also reported that "toward the end of filming, during a training session in the presence of the American Humane Representative, the trainer, in an uncontrolled impulse, hit the chimpanzee." The AHA Film Unit referred to this abuse as "completely inexcusable and unacceptable behavior in the use of any animal." The AHA has rated ''Speed Racer'' "Unacceptable" chiefly because of this incident, with AHA noting "the aforementioned training incident tarnishes the excellent work of the rest of production" and that it "has no method of separating the actions of one individual in the employ of a production from the production as a whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanefilmtv.org/archives/movies/mr.php?fid=7930 |title=Movie Review - Speed Racer |publisher=[[American Humane Association]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6IshK7NAC?url=http://www.americanhumanefilmtv.org/archives/movies/mr.php?fid=7930 |archivedate=August 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', Kirk Honeycutt called ''Speed Racer'''s visual effects "stellar", but stated it "proudly denies entry into its ultra-bright world to all but gamers, fanboys and anime enthusiasts".

Glenn Kenny of ''[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]'' criticized the film's time-shifting narrative and multiple storylines, saying it "yields heretofore undreamed of levels of narrative incoherence". Kenny praised the film's look, saying the "cheez-whizziness" that others had criticised was "precisely the point". He remarked the movie inspires even more thinking than ''The Matrix'' because of its "blatantly anti-capitalist storylines".&lt;ref name=premiere/&gt; Similarly, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'}}s Anthony Lane said the film could still end up "bleached of fun" due to the theme mooted in ''The Matrix'' that all of us are being controlled. In ''Speed Racer'', Lane argues, this comes in the form of villain Royalton, who "vows to crush [Speed] with 'the unassailable might of money.'" He concluded some people may call it entertaining, but he "felt [it] like Pop [[fascism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/05/12/080512crci_cinema_lane |title=Around the Bend |author=Lane, Anthony |work=[[The New Yorker]] |publisher=[[Condé Nast Publications]] |date=May 1, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QVCQ67bt?url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/cinema/2008/05/12/080512crci_cinema_lane |archivedate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Emerson, editor at the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', wrote that ''Speed Racer'' "is a manufactured widget, a packaged commodity that capitalizes on an anthropomorphized cartoon of Capitalist Evil in order to sell itself and its ancillary products".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/speed-racer-2008 |title=Speed Racer Review |author=Emerson, Jim |journal=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |publisher=[[Sun-Times Media Group]] |date=May 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 9, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QVD9QWQu?url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/speed-racer-2008 |archivedate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was said to be "the most tiresome piece of CGI ({{sic|Computer Generated Idiocy|expected=Computer-generated imagery}})" of the "past couple of years" at the time of film's release by [[Philip French]], a ''[[The Guardian]]'' critic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/11/culture.actionandadventure |title=Review: Speed Racer |author=[[Philip French|French, Philip]] |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian News and Media |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QVDDak80?url=http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/may/11/culture.actionandadventure |archivedate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in later years, the film has appeared periodically on lists of underrated films. ''Speed Racer'' was elected the third most underrated film of the 2000s by [[Den of Geek]]'s N.P. Horton, which called it "a game-changing film which redefined and reconceptualised the film form as we know it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/24649/top-50-underrated-films-of-the-2000s |title=Top 50 underrated films of the 2000s |author=Horton, N.P. |date=March 8, 2013 |work=Den of Geek |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhfhOIeY?url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/24649/top-50-underrated-films-of-the-2000s |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nick Hyman, writing for Metacritic, included the film on its list of "movies that critics got wrong" calling it "a cult classic in the making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/15-movies-the-critics-got-wrong |title=15 Movies the Critics Got Wrong |author=Hyman, Nick |date=June 14, 2010 |work=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhfkVWQw?url=http://www.metacritic.com/feature/15-movies-the-critics-got-wrong |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described as "nearly unmatched [...] insofar as action/adventure/family films go" by Alejandro Stepenberg from [[JoBlo.com]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/the-unpopular-opinion-speed-racer |title=The Unpopular Opinion: Speed Racer |author=Stepenberg, Alejandro |date=April 4, 2012 |work=[[JoBlo.com]] |publisher=Joblo Media |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhfoQtHq?url=http://www.joblo.com/movie-news/the-unpopular-opinion-speed-racer |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''{{'}}s Chris Wade named it "an underrated masterpiece," stating "they [the Wachowskis] made a brilliant visual cartoon that dares to ask that you take it seriously."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/10/25/speed_racer_the_wachowskis_masterpiece_is_underrated.html |title=''Speed Racer'', the Wachowskis’ Masterpiece |author=Wade, Chris |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qhfq8z6U?url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/10/25/speed_racer_the_wachowskis_masterpiece_is_underrated.html |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annalee Newitz]] of [[io9]] analyzed the ten reasons why she believes the film to be an "unsung masterpiece"; among them, the visuals, the humor, and even its political themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/5954595/10-reasons-why-speed-racer-is-an-unsung-masterpiece |title=10 Reasons Why ''Speed Racer'' Is an Unsung Masterpiece |date=October 24, 2012 |author=[[Annalee Newitz|Newitz, Annalee]] |work=[[io9]] |publisher=[[Gawker Media]] |accessdate=June 9, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Qhfl40gC?url=http://io9.com/5954595/10-reasons-why-speed-racer-is-an-unsung-masterpiece |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tor.com]]'s Dexter Palmer considered the possibility that the film is a "misunderstood art film", highlighting its color scheme that is a "pleasure" and the fact it does not try to seem real.

==Proposed sequel==
''Variety'' discussed a possible sequel, saying it could happen if ''Speed Racer'' had a good box office performance.&lt;ref name=merch/&gt; In 2008, a possible sequel was contemplated by the Wachowskis when Rain asked them why his character is so happy for Speed winning, and they replied it could be explained in the next film. Rain said he was hired for three years, while noting that does not guarantee that a sequel will be released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/05/09/speed-racer-interview-with-rain/ |title=Speed Racer: Interview with Rain |date=May 9, 2008 |publisher=SciFi Japan |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgSUKAT?url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2008/05/09/speed-racer-interview-with-rain/ |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christina Ricci also considered it a possibility; she stated "When we [the cast] were all leaving, we were like 'write the sequel!' 'We want to come back'. And they [the Wachowskis] were like, 'I know. I know. We're going to. Don't worry'.", adding she would like more action scenes to her character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=44448 |title=Christina Ricci on ''Speed Racer'' Sequel |author=Newgen, Heather |date=April 26, 2008 |work=ComingSoon.net |publisher=CraveOnline |accessdate=August 14, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgTIFAK?url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=44448 |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The producer Joel Silver said that the Wachowskis "have a great story idea for a sequel" but that it is "a great idea for a sequel if it makes sense to make it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/7641/tcid/1 |title=Joel Silver talks Ninja Assassin (not Assassins) |date=April 19, 2008 |publisher=Collider.com |accessdate=October 29, 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6QhgTukca?url=http://collider.com/entertainment/interviews/article.asp/aid/7641/tcid/1 |archivedate=June 29, 2014 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tarrasch 72.jpg|right|thumb|Siegbert Tarrasch]]

The '''Tarrasch rule''' is a general principle that applies in the majority of [[chess]] [[Chess middlegame|middlegames]] and [[Chess endgame|endgames]].  [[Siegbert Tarrasch]] (1862–1934) stated the "rule" that [[rook (chess)|rooks]] should be placed behind [[passed pawn]]s – either yours or your opponent's.  The idea behind the guideline is that (1) if a player's rook is behind his passed pawn, the rook protects it as it advances, and (2) if it is behind an opponent's passed pawn, the pawn cannot advance unless it is protected along its way.

The original quote, from page 57 of his book ''The Game of Chess'' (1938) is: &lt;blockquote&gt;In complicated Rook endings the most important rule is one laid down by the author: The Rook's place is behind the passed pawn; behind the enemy pawn in order to hold it up, behind one's own in order to support its advance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=5XmN60ps1L0C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=+%22In+complicated+Rook+endings+the+most+important+rule+%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=6CoJGf1HZ0&amp;sig=EOyVwIMbUuSJQuNXbCxc4jk0Sgk&amp;hl=en Book source]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This "rule" is usually true, but not always, as there are many exceptions.  Tarrasch has been quoted as saying, "Always put the rook behind the pawn.... Except when it is incorrect to do so." {{harvcol|Soltis|2003|p=129}}.
{{algebraic notation|pos=toc}}

==Rationale==
&lt;!--The advance of the passed pawn lengthens the range of a rook behind and reduces the range of a rook in front.  A rook escorting a pawn from ahead must move off, potentially leaving the pawn undefended, if it is to [[promote (chess)|promote]]. A rook behind an enemy passed pawn can more readily generate [[counterplay]].--&gt;

Consider the diagram on the right. On the b-file, White's rook is behind his pawn, while Black's is in front of it. In a vacuum, Black cannot do much to stop the pawn's advance. He can block it, but as soon as it must back up or move elsewhere to accomplish some other goal, the pawn can advance. In addition, as the pawn advances, the space the rook can move to attack it continues to shrink. By contrast, the white rook's range increases as the pawn advances, while it defends it from attack equally well at all distances. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind one's own pawn.

On the g-file, the roles are reversed: White's rook is behind Black's pawn, with Black's rook in front. As the pawn advances, White's rook has more freedom of movement, while Black's becomes ever more constrained. White cannot actively block the pawn, but he does not need to; if Black wishes to [[promotion (chess)|promote]], he must at some point move the rook out of the way, which if there is no other support leads to the pawn's immediate capture. Thus, a rook is better-placed behind the enemy's pawn.

==Illustrations==
Here are two positions to illustrate the principle.

===Rook behind own passed pawn: win===

|Position after 54.Rf4–a4. Rook behind its own passed pawn.
}}
In the first diagram, White's rook is behind his passed pawn on the ''a''-{{chessgloss|file}}, and the position is won for White.

The winning technique is straightforward:
#Move the king towards the passed pawn.  The defending king must also move that way, otherwise he will be forced to give up his rook for the pawn.
#If the attacking king can penetrate no further because the defending king is in opposition, use tempo moves by the rook up and down the file.  Once pawn moves are exhausted, then the defender runs out of options.
#If the defending rook retreats, then advance the pawn.  The defender cannot keep up this strategy.  If the defending king sidesteps away from the pawn, the attacking king moves towards the pawn, and forces its advance.  The defender will have to give up his rook.  So the only option is for the defending king to move towards the pawn.
#The attacking king penetrates the {{chessgloss|kingside}} pawn structure as far as possible.  If the defender wins the passed pawn, an exchange of rooks ensues and the resulting pawn ending is an easy win for the attacker.
#At the right moment, the attacking rook abandons the pawn and joins in the attack on the kingside pawns.
The 34th game of the [[World Chess Championship 1927|1927 World Championship]] match between [[Alexander Alekhine|Alekhine]] and [[José Raúl Capablanca|Capablanca]] is a classic example of the technique&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chessgame?gid=1012518 Alekhine vs. Capablanca]&lt;/ref&gt; (or see [http://www.enpassant.dk/chess/palview/p3demo/iframeg.htm annotated text]).  The position is after White's 54.Ra4.  White won on move 82 {{Harvcol|Korchnoi|2002|p=15}}.

|Rook behind enemy passed pawn

The reason this type of position was long thought to be an easy draw is as follows:
#White cannot advance his pawn to the seventh {{chessgloss|rank}}, because that would deprive his king of any shelter.
#So White must advance his pawn only up to the sixth, so the king can find shelter on a7.
#White's only real winning attempt was to move his king up to a7.  Then he can play Rb8–b6, Kb7, a7 (threatening Ra6), forcing Black to give up his rook for the pawn.
#But while White is spending all this time, Black's rook can win White's kingside pawns, then advance the newly made passed pawns.
#It has been known for White to even lose this battle of rook versus many passed pawns.
#Thus if White tries too hard to win, he may actually lose.

Recent theoretical analysis of this position shows that White has a strong maneuver: 
#Advance the pawn to the sixth {{chessgloss|rank}}.
#Move the king towards the {{chessgloss|queenside}}.
#When the black rook takes a kingside pawn, switch the rook to guarding the pawn from the c-file, i.e. Rc7 then advance the pawn to a7.
#Switch the white rook to the a-file with gain of tempo.  Thus Black is forced to sacrifice his rook for the pawn without White having to move his king all the way to a7.  These many extra tempos make the difference between winning and drawing or even losing.&lt;ref name="The Instructor"/&gt;
Black must play very carefully to draw, rather than the very easy draw that was long thought to be the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chesscafe.com/text/dvoretsky39.pdf The Instructor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kantorovich analyzed the position in the diagram on the right and thought that Black draws with two tempos to spare.  In 2003 Steckner found an improvement for White that wins.  Black's pieces are in their optimum positions: the rook is behind the a-pawn and attacking the f-pawn and the king is in its most active location. If 1.Ra8 Kf5 Black has an easy draw; however, White has a better plan which wins with precise play:
:'''1. Kd4!'''
::The f-pawn must be sacrificed because the rook is on a7.
:'''1... Rxf2 2. Rc7! Ra2 3. a7''' 
::3.Rc6+ leads to a draw.
:'''3... Kf5 4. Kc4!!'''
::The old analysis was 4.Rxf7+, leading to a draw.
:'''4... Kg4 5. Kb3! Ra6 6. Rc4+ Kxg3 7. Ra4 Rxa7 8. Rxa7 Kxh4 9. Kc3 Kg3 10. Kd2 h4 11. Ke2 Kg2 12. Rxf7 h3 13. Rf2+ Kg3 {{nowrap|14. Rf6}}'''

There are exceptions to the Tarrasch rule.  Here are some.
* [[Yuri Averbakh]] said that the Tarrasch rule is usually correct when only the rooks are battling over the pawn, but when the pawn is blocked by the opposing king, the rook of the same color as the pawn is normally better protecting the pawn from the side {{Harvcol|Emms|2008|p=87}}.
* In the [[rook and pawn versus rook endgame]], if the pawn is not beyond its fourth rank, the best place for the defending rook is in front of the pawn {{Harvcol|Howell|1997|pp=38–40}}, {{harvcol|Dvoretsky|2006|pp=150ff|}}.
* On a similar note, [[Cecil Purdy]] said that a rook is best behind its passed pawn if it is on the fifth rank or higher, or can reach those ranks.  If the pawn is held up before the fifth rank, the rook is better in front of the pawn.  Often the rook is best protecting the pawn from the side if it is on the fifth rank or higher {{harvcol|Purdy|2003|p=114}}.
* In the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, if the defending king is cut off from the pawn's file, then the best defence is with the rook on its first rank {{Harvcol|Howell|1997|p=37}}.  See the [[Rook and pawn versus rook endgame#Frontal defense|frontal defense]].
* In the ending of a rook and pawn versus a rook, where the pawn is a {{chessgloss|knight pawn}} (b- or g-file), the defending king is in front of the pawn, but the defender cannot get his rook to the third rank for the drawing [[Philidor position]], the defending rook draws on its first rank but loses if it is attacking the pawn from behind {{harvcol|Mednis|1982|p=16}}, {{Harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|p=295}}.
* In the ending of a rook and two [[isolated pawn]]s versus a rook, it is generally better for the stronger side to protect the pawns from the side {{harvcol|Mednis|1982|p=29|}}.
* If the pawn is a [[rook pawn]] it is often better for the rook to attack it from the side, especially in a rook and pawn versus rook position {{harvcol|Nunn|2009|p=120}}.  (See the [[rook and pawn versus rook endgame#Vančura position|Vančura position]].)
* If a rook is in front of its passed pawn, it is often best for the defending rook to attack from the side.  In fact, it is sometimes best to switch the defending rook from behind the pawn to the side {{harvcol|Nunn|2010|pp=38–44}}.
* In the ending of a rook versus a pawn or pawns, the rook is best placed on its first rank {{Harvcol|Fine|Benko|2003|pp=275–92}}, {{harvcol|Mednis|1998|p=47}}.
* When a rook is battling against pawns, if the pawns are not [[connected pawns|connected]], it is often best for the rook to hold the pawns up along a rank {{harvcol|Nunn|2010|p=22}}.

The move 1...Rb7 would be in accordance with the Tarrasch rule, but '''1...

The rule still applies for White, however, and the game continued:

'''[[Uganda]]''' sent a delegation to compete at the '''[[2000 Summer Paralympics]]''' in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].

The '''WACA''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|æ|k|ə}} (formally the '''WACA Ground'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.waca.com.au/other/id.php?m=1&amp;ID=1|title=About the WACA Ground|last=|first=|date=|website=Western Australian Cricket Association|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a sports [[stadium]] in [[Perth, Western Australia]]. The stadium's name derives from the initials of its owners and operators, the [[Western Australian Cricket Association]].

The WACA was Western Australia's "home of [[cricket]]" since the early 1890s, with [[Test cricket]] played at the ground since the 1970–71 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content-usa.cricinfo.com/australia/engine/match/63061.html The Ashes – 2nd Test Australia v England ]&lt;/ref&gt; The ground is the home venue of Western Australia's [[first-class cricket]] team, the [[Western Australia cricket team|Western Warriors]], and a [[Women's National Cricket League]] side, the [[Western Fury]]. The [[Perth Scorchers]], a [[Big Bash League]] franchise, also play at the ground, which is branded #TheFurnace for those matches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthscorchers.com.au/thefurnace #THEFURNACE] perthscorchers.com.au. Retrieved on 20 Dec, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, many international cricket matches and Big Bash games are played at the new [[Perth Stadium]].

The [[cricket pitch|pitch]] at the WACA is regarded as the quickest and bounciest in the world. These characteristics, in combination with the afternoon sea-breezes which regularly pass the ground (the [[Fremantle Doctor]]), have historically made the ground an attractive place for [[Types of bowlers in cricket|pace]] and [[swing bowler]]s. The outfield is exceptionally fast, contributing to the ground seeing some very fast scoring – as of February 2016, four of the nine fastest Test centuries have been scored at the WACA.&lt;ref name="ESPNcricinfo"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/records/210170.html|accessdate = 13 January 2012|title = Records / Test matches / Batting records / Fastest hundreds|author = [[ESPNcricinfo]]|publisher = [[ESPN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WACA has also hosted 7 scores of 99 in Test cricket - the most of any ground in the world.

Throughout its history, the ground has also been used for a range of other sports, including [[track and field athletics|athletics]] carnivals, [[Australian rules football]], [[baseball]], [[Football (soccer)|soccer]], [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]], and [[international rules football]]. However, recent years have seen most of these activities relocated to other venues. It has also been used for major [[rock concert]]s.

==Early history==
[[File:Association cricket ground, Perth. c.1910.jpg|thumb|left|An early coloured image of the Association ground in about 1910, looking north, with a large crowd watching a game in progress. Note the original 1890s stand is evidently packed.]]
William Henry Wise, a gardener who came to WA from [[England]] in 1880, laid the first turf wicket at the WACA.  Wise was personal gardener to Sir [[George Shenton]], of Crawley. In addition to his work at the WACA Ground, he laid the first tennis court on the Perth Esplanade.

The Western Australian Cricket Association was officially established on 25 November 1885 under the Presidency of [[John Charles Horsey James|JCH James]]. In 1893, the WACA ground was officially opened, occupying a site of old swamp land to the east of the city. The association has a [[999-year lease]] over the land (which expires in 2888). The long term of the lease means that, effectively, the association has [[Fee simple|freehold]] title (save that it cannot divest itself of any part of the land without the state government's consent).  Originally, the title covered 29 acres (117,000&amp;nbsp;m²), and took in what is now [[Gloucester Park, Perth|Gloucester Park]]. However, the latter part of the land was divested to the Trotting Association in the early 1920s. Between 1977 and 1979, (then-rebel) [[World Series Cricket]] matches were played at Gloucester Park because the [[Kerry Packer]]-led organisation was not granted access to the WACA.

The first match played on the turf wickets took place in February 1894. However, difficulties encountered in transporting teams to Western Australia meant that the ground was not part of Australia's main cricket community for many years. Even with the building of a transcontinental railway, the trip from the eastern states still took several days. It took the introduction of scheduled flights to Western Australia to make the WACA readily accessible to interstate or overseas teams.

[[James Gardiner (Australian politician)|James Gardiner]], president of the WACA for three terms between 1897 and 1924, proposed the adoption of 'electorate' cricket (as it was first known) whereby teams were established on a district basis for competition.&lt;ref&gt;[[The West Australian]], 29 October 1928.&lt;/ref&gt; He also inaugurated Country Week cricket, during which country teams compete against each other.&lt;ref&gt;Western Australian Cricketing Association 1924, ''Annual Report 1923'', Perth.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907, the WACA ground was under threat of being controlled by the [[Perth City Council]] to recover debts. Gardiner led the bid to save the ground and secured a government loan.&lt;ref name="Barker 1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Barker A.J.|year=1997|title=The WACA: An Australian Cricket Success Story|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin, St. Leonard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further financial difficulties led Gardiner to again raise funds and donations with a cricket match by the Australian XI team in 1912.&lt;ref name="Barker 1997" /&gt;

==Ground developments==
[[File:WACA scoreboard W.A. vs Victoria, 21 Dec. 1953.jpg|thumb|right|The WACA scoreboard at its opening in December 1953]]
[[File:2015 CWC I v UAE 02-28 Scoreboard (02).JPG|thumb|right|The WACA Scoreboard in 2015]]
The WACA ground, like many stadiums of its era, has undergone various re-developments.  The most notable are:
* The building, in 1895, of the first grandstand; seating 500 people and incorporating dressing rooms, a dining room, bathrooms, members’ rooms and bars.
* In 1931 the Farley Stand was opened, named after W.J. Farley, the association's president from 1915–1916 to 1916–17 and secretary from 1917–1918 to 1928–1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article67248643 |title=New Stand. |newspaper=[[Geraldton Guardian and Express|Geraldton Guardian and Express (WA : 1929 – 1947)]] |location=WA |date=12 September 1930 |accessdate=23 September 2012 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1948 the scoreboard at the WACA was destroyed by a storm. In 1954 a replacement scoreboard was built, a donation from the North West Murchison Cricket Association. This, now iconic, scoreboard remains in operation.
* In the 1960s the Players Pavilion was built to provide facilities for the players and the WACA administration. Seating was later added to provide additional seating, initially to accommodate the first [[Test cricket|Test Match]] to be played at the WACA (Australia v England in 1970).
* Also to welcome Test cricket to the WACA, 1970 saw the opening of the "Test Stand".  It was later renamed the Inverarity Stand, after Western Australian, South Australian and Australian player [[John Inverarity]].
* From 1984 to 1988 the WACA underwent major renovations, including a realignment and a complete resurfacing of the ground and the construction of new terracing and seating in the outer. Also built were the three tiered Prindiville grandstand and two tiered Lillee-Marsh grandstand, which increased the ground's [[seating capacity]]. Six large light towers were also installed in 1986 at a cost of $4.2&amp;nbsp;million, allowing for night time sports such as day-night cricket matches to be played at the ground. An icon of the WACA, the [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] are 70 metres high and cost $600 per hour to run.

[[File:WACA north.JPG|thumb|right|The WACA facing north, showing the Inverarity Stand (left) and the Prindiville Stand (right)]]
These redevelopments also made the venue an attractive venue for sports other than cricket, and it was during the late 1980s and early 1990s that the ground saw its greatest use as a multi-sports venue. From 1987 to 2000, the ground was used by the [[West Coast Eagles]], and from 1995 by the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]], both Perth-based [[Australian Football League|AFL]] teams. 72 AFL matches were held at the ground during this time. From 1995 to 1997 the WACA also served as the home ground for the [[WA Reds|Western Reds]] [[rugby league]] team. In the late 1990s the ground played host to the [[Perth Heat]] in the former [[Australian Baseball League (1989-1999)]].

However, for various reasons these sports moved away from the WACA (in the case of night football, to [[Subiaco Oval]]), and as a consequence the WACA was again redeveloped in 2002. The capacity of the ground was reduced to around 20,000 and the dimensions of the playing arena were also decreased by a total of 31 metres at the eastern and western boundaries, meaning Australian rules football could no longer be played at the ground. From time to time, temporary stands are used to boost the ground's capacity to 24,500.

In 2013, a new video screen was installed at the WACA near the old scoreboard, replacing one of the old temporary screens.

The WACA Museum (located on-site) features exhibits about Western Australian cricket.

===Proposed further development===
In April 2007 the [[Western Australian Cricket Association]] announced a [[Australian Dollar|$]]250m redevelopment of the stadium. [[Seating capacity]] was to be increased, with residential and commercial buildings built in the surrounding areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epra.wa.gov.au/Projects/Riverside/Precincts/WACA EPRA projects: WACA] EPRA website, November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The project was to be done in partnership with Ascot Capital Limited with a three- to four-year time frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsaustralia.com/articles/news.php?id=1086 WACA secures its Home and Financial Future] Sportsaustralia.com, 13 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/Sport/250m-plan-to-revamp-WACA-revealed/2007/04/13/1175971329386.html $250m plan to revamp WACA revealed] ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' 13 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; WACA members gave final approval for the project in July 2010 and construction was expected to commence in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waca.com.au/news/detail.asp?ID=1851|title=Development Agreement with Ascot Capital Ltd Approved|work=WACA|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by November 2011 work on the redevelopment had still yet to commence, and it was reported that delays could continue for years. Although the project received finance, tax office and members' approval, adverse market conditions were believed to have made the project unfeasible.&lt;ref name="WACA redevelopment in jeopardy"&gt;John Townsend, [http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/sport/a/-/cricket/11665150/waca-redevelopment-in-jeopardy/ WACA redevelopment in jeopardy] ''[[The West Australian]]'' 15 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The redevelopment was also the subject of a dispute between the WACA and the Australian Cricketers Association, with the players' union seeking 26 per cent of the value of the project.&lt;ref name="WACA redevelopment in jeopardy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Craddock, [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/archives/old-sport-pages/australian-cricketers-association-and-waca-in-conflict-over-real-estate-development/story-fn67w6pa-1226242073162 Australian Cricketers Association and WACA in conflict over real estate development], ''[[The Herald Sun]]'', January 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012 the WACA and Ascot Capital Limited commenced selling 137 apartments in "The Gardens", a planned 10-storey residential complex to be located on the western boundary line of the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Marissa Lague, [http://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/business/a/-/national/15499753/waca-view-holds-big-appeal-for-apartments/ WACA view holds big appeal for apartments], ''[[The West Australian]]'', 28 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of The Gardens was expected to commence mid-2013 and be completed by mid-2015.&lt;ref&gt;Metropolitan Redevelopment Authority, [http://www.mra.wa.gov.au/Projects/Riverside/Precincts/WACA Projects: WACA].&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the WACA and Ascot Capital would have seen new northern grandstands, an increase in ground capacity and a long term revenue stream. However, in December 2013 the WACA released a statement that it had abandoned the so-called Gardens Development because it was unable to achieve the pre-sales target in order to finance the project.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-16/waca-plan-for-apartments-on-site-abandoned/5160302 WACA abandons plan for apartments on site to fund upgrade of ground], 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013 [[Cricket Australia]] announced that the WACA ground would not host a Test match in the shortened 2014/15 season to accommodate the [[2015 Cricket World Cup]], a decision which left Perth without a summer test match for the first time in nearly 40 years. Cricket Australia said the WACA Ground required significant improvements, given it has the smallest capacity of the five mainland capital city venues.&lt;ref&gt;ABC News [http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-12/waca-to-miss-out-on-test-match/4952878 WACA upset over loss of Perth Test match for 2014-15], 17 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2018/19 summer, the WACA Ground is no longer the primary international cricket venue in Perth. [[Perth Stadium]] in [[Burswood, Western Australia|Burswood]] now hosts limited overs internationals, Test matches against high-drawing opponents ([[England cricket team|England]], [[Indian cricket team|India]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]]), and domestic [[Big Bash League]] (BBL) matches for [[Perth Scorchers]]. The WACA Ground will continue to host Tests against lower-drawing opponents, Sheffield Shield matches, and will be redeveloped into the state's leading cricket training facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=WAToday|date=3 September 2015|accessdate=5 September 2015|title=WACA to shift Test matches to new Perth Stadium at Burswood|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/wa-news/waca-to-shift-test-matches-to-new-perth-stadium-at-burswood-20150903-gjeaxp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

England's veteran captain [[Charlotte Edwards]] has since described the Test as "the most incredible match I'll ever play in".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nicholson |first1=Raf |title=The case for women's Tests |journal=[[The Cricket Monthly]] |date=February 2016 |url=http://www.thecricketmonthly.com/story/963911/the-case-for-women-s-tests |accessdate=11 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 13 November 2015 David Warner scored 253, which at the time was the second highest test score at the ground&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/david-warner-double-century-australia-opener-shatters-records-in-second-test-against-new-zealand/story-fn2mcu3x-1227608443024 David Warner double-century] ''[[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]]'' 13 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 November 2015 [[Ross Taylor]] scored 290, the highest total against an Australian team in Australia. Also he overtook David Warner for the second highest test score at the ground, who scored 253 in the same game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/toi-cri/top-stories/Ross-Taylor-ticks-off-records-during-epic-290/articleshow/49797791.cms Ross Taylor ticks off records during epic 290] ''[[The Times of India]]'' 16 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 14 December 2017, WACA hosted its final [[2017–18 Ashes series|Ashes Test]], and possibly final international match. In that match, both [[Dawid Malan]] (140) and [[Mitchell Marsh]] scored their maiden Test centuries (Marsh reached 181) and [[Jonny Bairstow]] scored his first century in Australia, [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] scored his maiden home Test double-century, then went on to his highest Test score (239). Smith and Marsh also achieved the highest partnership for the 5th wicket at the WACA (301). Mitchell Starc produced a miraculous off-cutter from around the wicket to remove James Vince, and the match ended with Australia regaining the Ashes.
*On 25 January 2018, the WACA hosted its final [[Big Bash League]] match - [[Perth Scorchers]] V [[Adelaide Strikers]]. In that match, Strikers batted first. They were restricted to 6/137 (20) with [[Matt Kelly (cricketer)|Matt Kelly]], [[Jhye Richardson]] and [[Tim Bresnan]] all taking 2 wickets apiece. [[Adam Voges]] couldn't help but hit 56 runs off 45 deliveries one last time before moving on to square up with [[Hobart Hurricanes]] in the Semi-Final at [[Perth Stadium|Optus Stadium.]]

==Cricket museum==
The WACA has a cricket museum just next to the ground. Visitors can view memorabilia of Australian cricket.
They display not only the history of cricket, but also other sports played at the WACA.

'''World Pump Festival''', better known as '''World Pump It Up Festival''' or '''WPF''', is a competition and event focusing on the [[dance game]] ''[[Pump It Up (video game)|Pump It Up]]'' which takes place in various time slots.&lt;ref name="Gamesindustry.Biz"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Gamesindustry.Biz article | date = | url =http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20046| accessdate = 2007-11-17 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071231023627/http://www.gamesindustry.biz/content_page.php?aid=20046 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Pump It Up'' is a Korean game that requires physical movement of the feet. The game is open for [[breakdancing]], and many people have accomplished this feat by memorizing the steps and creating dance moves to hit the arrows on time. What separates this from other [[Dance Dance Revolution#DDR today|Machine dance tournaments]] is the large amount of prize money on offer and national qualifiers around the world.

At WPF, the best technical and freestyle players are flown from several countries to compete in their respective categories: Speed and Freestyle. As of 2006, a Female Speed category was introduced. The candidates are selected by tournaments held in their respective country by Supporters and Club Leaders - Members of the Pump community who work unpaid for Andamiro, organise tournaments and social events during the year. As well as the competition itself, [[Andamiro]] takes players and spectators on a tour of the host country, as a form of [[tourism]] aiming to promote the game as a sport for [[weight loss]] using videogames and [[Korean culture]] to create friendship between players. Previous locations of WPF have been held in Korea at G Star, Lotte World and more recently{{when|date=August 2014}}, Mexico City. Nationals (qualifiers for WPF) in Mexico and Brazil have been held in sports stadiums.

Competitors in the freestyle category incorporate elements of [[locking (dance)|locking]], [[salsa (dance)|salsa]], [[funk]] styles, [[popping]], [[hip hop dance]], [[breakdance]], [[street dance]] and other types of dance and theatrical movements into performances. It has become the norm to make a routine using [[choreography]] while facing the audience.

Andamiro provides a round trip flight, hotel, meals, transportation and tour at WPF for national winners. Spectators wishing to travel also have accommodation and most expenses covered.&lt;ref name="Andamiro USA"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Andamiro USA – WPF announcement | date = | url =http://www.andamiro.com/eng/news/notice_view.html?code=notice_usa&amp;number=39| accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tournament categories==

''NOTE: Players can ONLY compete in 1 division!''

===Speed===
Players will achieve the highest score possible. Technical players focus on timing and pattern reading during gameplay, while minimizing combo breaking because combo breaking will disrupt the multiplier. Speed entrants (both in the male and female category) will practice the game on the most difficult songs/highest difficulty levels in an attempt to perfect their scores. The following rounds are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! MEN !! WOMEN
|-
| '''Preliminary''' || Single 17-19 || Single 15-17
|-
| '''Quarterfinal''' || Single 20-23 || Single 18-20
|-
| '''Semifinal''' || Double 21-23 || Double 18-20
|-
| '''Final''' (Best 2 of 3) || Double 24+ || Double 21-23
|-
|}

===Freestyle===
Pump players will choose to incorporate complex or flashy techniques into their play movements, and develop intricate dance routines to perform during a song. Freestyle players tend to choose songs on lower difficulty levels or Freestyle-based Performance Charts designed for it, so that the player is not restricted in their movements by large quantities of required steps.&lt;ref name="Gamezone article"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Gamezone article | date = | url =http://ps2.gamezone.com/news/10_19_05_11_27AM.htm| accessdate = 2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Freesylers can choose between performing solo or have a partner involved. This category contains 2 rounds: Preliminary and final (Top 8 or Top 4). The scorecard are as follows:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Category !! Points !! Notes
|-
| '''Dance &amp; Skill''' || 55 || Overall performance, including the execution, flow, synchronization, power moves, etc.
|-
| '''Apparel &amp; Makeup''' || 20 || Costume and props.
|-
| '''Machine Score''' || 15 || Letter grade.&lt;br&gt;CAUTION: An 'F' will result in an auto-Disqualification.
|-
| '''Judge's Evaluation''' || 10 || Miscellaneous. Includes the use of the song in the latest installment, creativity, and crowd reaction.
|-
! '''Total''' !! 100 !! Total Points
|}

==Supporters and clubs==
A '''Supporter''' is a person who is the main point of contact between their respective country and Andamiro Korea. Any events and tournaments held require a written report with photos/videos sent to Andamiro, in exchange for prizes and recognition of athletes to enter WPF. A '''Club Leader''' is the person in charge of their respective club and should use their best efforts to maintain a close relationship with their Supporter. Clubs are normally (but not exclusively) town specific and focus on events in their area. As of 2007 a minimum of 10 officially recognised clubs are required per country to validate them for WPF (150 club members). Excellent club organisers can be designated as jurors in competitions for selecting national team members and also the WPF competition itself. If this is the case, Andamiro pays for all WPF jurors expenses, like WPF athletes. Andamiro gives prize money two times a year to the club's treasurer for club activities. Members who make a forum post, upload a picture/video or high score for the home/arcade versions of the game receive points. These can be exchanged in the online store for T-shirts, Sweatbands, Visors, CD's/DVD's and signed MP3 players by [[Banya (musical group)]].

==History==

===World Pump Festival 2005===
This was the first year Andamiro hosted its first-ever World Pump Festival. This was hosted in Korea. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up Exceed 2. The total prize offered was $129,000.

===World Pump Festival 2006===
World Pump Festival returns to Korea. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up Zero. Female Speed was introduced to the competition, while removing Battle Station as part of their lineup. The total prize offered was $146,000.

===World Pump Festival 2007===
The biggest change with World Pump Festival was the move to Mexico. The primary machine used for this was Pump It Up NX. The total prize offered was $148,000. This is the last World Pump Festival to consistently be annual as the next one wasn't until 2011.

===World Pump Festival 2011===
After a long 3 year Hiatus, in 2010 Andamiro began hinting at WPF 2011, with the new release of "PIU Fiesta EX". Fiesta EX is the official version used in WPF 2011 and used a "Random for WPF" channel ver.  WPF2011 was held in China, August 25 - 27, 2011 / GTI Game Show in Guangzhou.&lt;ref name="FIRE GAME"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = FIRE GAME – WPF announcement | date = | url =http://fire-game.blogspot.com/2010/08/piu-info-confirmado-wpf-2011-sera-en.html| accessdate = 2010-12-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biggest change in this event was allowing the use of the bar for all divisions, primarily Male Speed. Previously, bar was prohibited until this event, drastically changing the landscape of the competition. Because Fiesta removed the traditional difficulties (Crazy and Nightmare), they are replaced with actual difficulty numbers, making navigation easier (See Speed above).

===World Pump Festival 2016===
Upon the release of [[Pump It Up Prime]], World Pump Festival was announced both in the pamphlet and credits in the machine. The year of the festival was changed from 2015 to 2016.

On February 23, Andamiro released the official ruleset for the upcoming WPF.&lt;ref name="Official Ruleset for WPF"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Official Ruleset for WPF | date = | url =http://www.mediafire.com/view/tbbicpda4taa5da| accessdate = 2016-02-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A video on April 18, 2016 confirmed that World Pump Festival will take place at Bali, Indonesia on July 23, 2016.&lt;ref name="Andamiro's YouTube"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = Andamiro's YouTube WPF 2016 Video | date = | url =https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9-LDGdrV2Qo| accessdate = 2016-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andamiro has released full details of WPF 2016:&lt;ref name="World Pump Festival 2016"&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | coauthors = | title = World Pump Festival 2016 | date = | url =http://www.piugame.com/wpfinbali/index_eng.html| accessdate = 2016-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wye Racecourse''' (29 May 1849 – June 1975) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[horse racing]] venue, situated in East [[Kent]] between [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] and [[Canterbury]] about 600 yards south of [[Wye railway station]].

The first racing in Wye took place on 29 May 1849 at the Crown.  Originally, racing took place over fences and on the flat, but in 1878 the course moved to Harville Farm and [[flat racing]] ceased.  [[Steeplechase (horse racing)|Steeplechases]], however, continued to be held in September, January, March, and May.&lt;ref name=KentRail/&gt;

The last racing took place at Wye on 2 May 1974 and the course closed permanently in June 1975. 
The [[Jockey Club]] had insisted upon changes to the course in August 1974, including changing the camber of the bottom turn and improving the grandstand.  However, the owners were unable to fund these changes, leading to closure. Wye was a very small, oval track, less than 1 mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) round.&lt;ref name=KentRail/&gt;&lt;ref name=GD/&gt;

The land is now farmed, although some evidence of the racecourse can still be seen from satellite photographs.
