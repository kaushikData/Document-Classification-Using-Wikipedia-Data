'''Abuse of process''' is a cause of action in [[tort]] arising from one party making misusing or perversion of regularly issued court process (civil or criminal) not justified by the underlying legal action. It is a [[common law]] intentional tort. It is to be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], another type of tort that involves misuse of the public right of access to the [[court]]s.

The elements of a valid [[cause of action]] for abuse of process in most common law jurisdictions are as follows: (1) the existence of an ulterior purpose or motive underlying the use of process, and (2) some act in the use of the legal process not proper in the regular prosecution of the proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;''Cartwright v. Wexler, Wexler &amp; Heller, Ltd.'', 369 N.E.2d 185, 187 (Ill. App. Ct. 1977).&lt;/ref&gt; Abuse of process can be distinguished from [[malicious prosecution]], in that abuse of process typically does not require proof of [[Malice (law)|malice]], lack of [[probable cause]] in procuring issuance of the process, or a termination favorable to the plaintiff, all of which are essential to a claim of malicious [[prosecution]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' ''Liquid Carbonic Acid Mfg. Co. v. Convert'', 82 Ill. App. 39, 44 (Ill. App. Ct. 1899).&lt;/ref&gt;   "Process," as used in this context, includes not only the "service of process," i.e. an official summons or other notice issued from a court, but means any method used to acquire jurisdiction over a person or specific property that is issued under the official seal of a court.&lt;ref&gt;''Arora v. Chui'', 664 N.E.2d 1101 (Ill. App. Ct. 1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the person who abuses process is interested only in accomplishing some improper purpose that is collateral to the proper object of the process and that offends justice, such as an unjustified arrest or an unfounded criminal prosecution. Subpoenas to testify, attachments of property, executions on property, garnishments, and other provisional remedies are among the types of "process" considered to be capable of abuse.

==Principle==
The principles which led to a finding of an abuse of process in the UK were stated in ''[[Johnson v Gore Wood &amp; Co]]''&lt;ref&gt;[2000] UKHL 65; [2002] 2 AC 1, by [[Lord Bingham]] at 30-1.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Lord Bingham]].

{{cquote|"The underlying public interest is … that there should be finality in litigation and that a party should not be twice vexed in the same matter. This public interest is reinforced by the current emphasis on efficiency and economy in the conduct of litigation, in the interests of the parties and the public as a whole. The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. As one cannot comprehensively list all possible forms of abuse, so one cannot formulate any hard and fast rule to determine whether, on given facts, abuse is to be found or not … Properly applied, and whatever the legitimacy of its descent, the rule has in my view a valuable part to play in protecting the interests of justice."}}

==Distinguished from malicious prosecution==

A cause of action for abuse of process is similar to the action for [[malicious prosecution]] in that both actions are based on and involve the improper use of the courts and legal systems.  The primary difference between the two legal actions is that malicious prosecution concerns the malicious or wrongful commencement of an action, while, on the other hand, abuse of process concerns the improper use of the legal process after process has already been issued and a suit has commenced.  In abuse of process, the legal process is misused for some purpose which is considered improper under the law.  Thus technically, the service of process itself—in the form of a summons—could be considered abuse of process under the right circumstances, e.g. fraudulent or malicious manipulation of the process itself,&lt;ref&gt;''Neurosurgery &amp; Spine Surgery, S.C. v. Goldman'' 339 Ill. App. 3d 177, 183 (Ill. App. Ct. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; but in malicious prosecution, the wrongful act is the actual filing of the suit itself for improper and malicious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;See also, http://trucounsel.com/index.php/abuse-of-process&lt;/ref&gt;  As noted above, the three requirements of malice, lack of probable cause in the issuance of the process, and a termination of the prior proceeding favorable to the plaintiff, are essential elements for malicious prosecution.  Most jurisdictions do not require any of these three elements in order to make out a prima facie case for abuse of process.

==Illustration==

A cause of action for abuse of process may lie in situations where a criminal proceeding is brought against a defendant for improper motives.  For example, in ''Lader v. Benkowitz'',&lt;ref&gt;66 N.Y.S.2d 713 (N.Y. Spec. Term 1946)&lt;/ref&gt; a pleading was held to state a good cause of action for abuse of process when it alleged that defendant hotel owner had threatened to have the plaintiff arrested on a warrant issued at the behest of the defendant on a charge of disorderly conduct.

The allegedly improper motive was the hotel owner's underlying purpose of compelling plaintiff to pay a bill owed for plaintiff's alleged rental of a room in defendant's hotel.  It was claimed that through the unlawful use of the warrant and threat of arrest, the defendant was able to obtain the sum of money allegedly owed by plaintiff. In denying defendant's motion to dismiss, the court admonished that it was sufficient to show that regularly issued process had been used to accomplish an improper purpose in order to set forth a cause of action for abuse of process.

The fact that the plaintiff had yielded to defendant's threat to have her arrested under the warrant did not diminish the cause of action, because it was clear that the plaintiff actually had been arrested for the purpose of compelling her to pay the cost of the room.

'''Agonism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ἀγών ''agon'', "struggle") is a political theory that emphasizes the potentially positive aspects of certain (but not all) forms of political conflict. It accepts a permanent place for such conflict, but seeks to show how people might accept and channel this positively. For this reason, agonists are especially concerned with debates about [[democracy]]. The tradition is also referred to as '''agonistic pluralism'''.

==Agonism and other traditions in political thought==

Agonism is opposed to a strand in the [[Marxist]] conception of politics known as "[[materialism]]". [[Karl Marx|Marx]] would have agreed with the agonists that society had always been full of conflict, when he wrote: "The history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles".&lt;ref&gt;Marx &amp; Engels, ''Manifesto of the Communist Party'', 1848, [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/communist-manifesto/ch01.htm Chapter 1].&lt;/ref&gt; He also thought that the causes of conflict were inescapable features of present—i.e., [[capitalist]]—society. But, in his view, history would develop in such a way as to eventually destroy capitalism, and replace it with a harmonious society—which was his conception of communism. Especially during the 1960s and 1970s, many people, academics included, subscribed to a roughly Marxist analysis. Since then, some of those people have come to the view that the "[[historical materialism|materialist conception of history]]" does not give sufficient reason for hope about a harmonious society to come.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chantal Mouffe]] and [[Ernesto Laclau]] are amongst those who have come to agonism from a background in Marxism and the social movements of the middle part of the last century.&lt;ref name="redpepper.org.uk"&gt;[http://www.redpepper.org.uk/natarch/XRADDEM.HTML]&lt;/ref&gt;

Chantal Mouffe says, "I use the concept of agonistic pluralism to present a new way to think about democracy that is different from the traditional liberal conception of democracy as a negotiation among interests and is also different from the model that is currently being developed by people like [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[John Rawls]]. While they have many differences, Rawls and Habermas have in common the idea that the aim of the democratic society is the creation of a consensus, and that consensus is possible if people are only able to leave aside their particular interests and think as rational beings. However, while we desire an end to conflict, if we want people to be free we must always allow for the possibility that conflict may appear and to provide an arena where differences can be confronted. The democratic process should supply that arena."&lt;ref&gt; MOUFFE, C. (2000) The Democratic Paradox. London, New York. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agonism, not antagonism==
Agonism is not simply the undifferentiated celebration of [[wikt:Special:Search/antagonism|antagonism]]:
{{quote|Agonism implies a deep respect and concern for the other; indeed, the Greek ''agon'' refers most directly to an athletic contest oriented not merely toward victory or defeat, but emphasizing the importance of the struggle itself—a struggle that cannot exist without the opponent. Victory through forfeit or default, or over an unworthy opponent, comes up short compared to a defeat at the hands of a worthy opponent—a defeat that still brings honor. An agonistic discourse will therefore be one marked not merely by conflict but just as importantly, by mutual admiration...|Political theorist [[Samuel Chambers]]&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"&gt;[http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=317]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

[[Bonnie Honig]], an advocate of agonism, writes: "to affirm the perpetuity of the contest is not to celebrate a world without points of stabilisation; it is to affirm the reality of perpetual contest, even within an ordered setting, and to identify the affirmative dimension of contestation".&lt;ref name="ctheory.net"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
''Political Theory and the Displacement of Politics'', p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical conceptions==
The work of [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Michel Foucault]] have also invoked conceptions of agonism and the agon in a more critical sense beyond that of political counter-hegemony. Although this usage of Agonism has been largely ignored it has been explored at some length by Claudio Colaguori in ''Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination''. For Colaguori, "the agon is literally the arena of competition, the scene of contest, and the locus of adversarial conflict. The philosophy of agonism affirms the idea that transcendence, truth, and growth are generated from the outcome of the contest...the concept of agonism is often understood in an affirmative sense as the generative principle of economy, society and even natural ecology and personal growth... The ambivalent character of agonism is that it is often seen as a mode of transcendence, while its instrumental relation to the mode of destruction is rarely acknowledged".&lt;ref&gt;"C Colaguori" Agon Culture: Competition, Conflict and the Problem of Domination. de Sitter Publications, Whitby, Ontario, {{ISBN|978-1-897160-63-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agonism forms part of the instituted social order where society "produces and reproduces itself precisely from the interconnection of the antagonistic interests of its members" (Adorno, 1974).&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Adorno, 1974, "Minima Moralia". London: Verso Editions&lt;/ref&gt;

For Adorno, agonism is also about the "[[theodicy]] of conflict" where opponents "want to annihilate one another... to enter the agon, each the mortal enemy of each" (Minima Moralia). Adorno also sees agonism as the underlying principle in [[Hegel]]'s [[dialectic of history]] where "dialectics (growth through conflict) is the [[ontology]] of the wrong state of things. The right state of things would be free of it: neither a system nor a contradiction" (Negative Dialectics). Colaguori reconstructs the concept of the agon to invoke this critical, destructive aspect as a way of extending Adorno's critique of modern domination and identify how the normalization and naturalization of conflict is used as an ideology to justify various forms of domination and subjugation. The agonistic ideology that has been appropriated by popular culture for example makes use of agonistic themes to celebrate competition as the wellspring of life in such a way as to normalize "a military definition of reality" (C. W. Mills).

The critical conception of agonism developed by Adorno and Foucault emphasizes how aspects of competition can be utilized to reinforce the project of domination that is evident in the geopolitics of modernity. Colaguori suggests that a critical conception of agonism can be applied to the study of "numerous forms of social conflict in gender, class and race relations where the competitive mode of interaction prevails in the formation of social hierarchies based on competition as a form of exclusion". Colaguori further states that, "after 100 years of technological progress, human societies are trapped in a perpetual dynamic of conflict and crisis, with modernization at a standstill. While this dialectic of development and destruction has been analysed from political and economic perspectives, Agon Culture offers an analysis of the human condition through an examination of the way in which the cultural ideology of competition operates as a mode of rationality that underpins the order of domination."

==Agonism in fiction==
The [[science fiction]] novel ''Lady of Mazes'' by [[Karl Schroeder]] depicts a post-human future where "agonistics" is the ruling principle of the solar system. The story explains agonistics as "You can compete, and you can win, but you can never win once-and-for-all". A character gives two examples of agonism: a presidency with [[term limit]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and laws aimed at preventing corporate monopolies.&lt;ref name= "KSchroeder"&gt;Karl Schroeder ''Lady of Mazes'', Tor, {{ISBN|0-7653-1219-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Henrietta Martin''' (September 30, 1875 in [[Reno, Nevada|Empire City, Reno, Nevada]] &amp;ndash; April 15, 1951 in [[Carmel, California]]) (pseudonym, '''Anne O'Hara'''; nickname, '''Little Governor Anne''') was a [[suffragist]], [[Pacifism|pacifist]], and author from the state of [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"/&gt; Her main achievement was taking charge of the state legislation that gave women of Nevada the right to vote.  She was the first head of the department of history of the [[University of Nevada, Reno|University of Nevada]] (1897-1901) And was active in the suffrage movement in England in 1909-1911, working with [[Emmeline Pankhurst]]. She was president of the Nevada equal franchise society in 1912, and the first national chairman of the [[National Woman's Party]] in 1916. She was the first  woman to run for the [[United States Senate]]; She lost twice, in 1918 and 1920.&lt;ref name="Capace2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Capace|first=Nancy|title=Encyclopedia of Nevada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oLd4nCEMbpUC&amp;pg=PA128|accessdate=17 May 2012|year=2001|publisher=North American Book Dist LLC|isbn=978-0-403-09611-4|pages=126–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Kathryn.

==Early years==
Martin was the daughter of [[William O'Hara Martin]], of Irish descent, who served as a [[Nevada Senate|Nevada State Senator]],&lt;ref name="Valkenburgh"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unr.edu/nwhp/bios/women/martin.htm|title=Anne Henrietta Martin|last=Van Valkenburgh|first=Holly |publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=19 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her mother, Louise Stadtmuller Martin, was Bavarian. She attended [[Bishop Whitaker's School for Girls]] in Reno. Anne attended the University of Nevada (1891-1894), where she earned a degree in History. She earned a second B.A. in 1896 and an M.A. in History in 1897 from [[Stanford University]].

==Career==
In 1897, Martin established the University of Nevada's department of history. After two years in the department, she left to study at [[Columbia University]], [[Parsons The New School for Design|Chase's Art School]], [[University of London]], and [[University of Leipzig]]; but returned to the department in 1901–1903.&lt;ref name="Capace2001" /&gt; During her leave from the university, Martin recommended the Board of Regents replace her with [[Jeanne Wier]], a friend of hers from Stanford who was just finishing her degree.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, Su Kim. (2015). "We Seek to Be Patient": Jeanne Wier and the Nevada Historical Society, 1904–1950. UCLA: Information Studies 045A. Retrieved from: http://escholarship.org/uc/item/51d75576 p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin returned from Europe in 1901 to attend her father's funeral. Her father's death gave her a revelation, "suddenly made a feminist of me! . . . I found that I stood alone in my family against a man-controlled world." Martin traveled in Europe and Asia and experienced the women's revolution in England between 1909 and 1911, she became a [[Fabian Socialist]], and wrote short stories and political articles, occasionally under the pen name of Anne O'Hara. Martin was arrested in 1910 over an issue of trying to enfranchise British women. Her friend from Stanford, [[Lou Henry Hoover]], sent husband, [[Herbert Hoover]], to pay Martin's bail, but [[Frederick Pethick-Lawrence]] had already taken care of that.[1]

After returning to Nevada in the fall of 1911, she became president of the Nevada [[Equal Franchise Society]] in February 1912 and organized a campaign over sparsely populated deserts that convinced male voters to enfranchise women on November 3, 1914. This success led to her representation of the national movement as a speaker and executive committee member of the [[National American Woman Suffrage Association]] and the [[Congressional Union]]. Martin helped organize voting women in the West in 1916 to challenge Democrats. She was one of the [[Silent Sentinels]], [[National Woman's Party]] women who picketed for suffrage in front of the White House on July 14, 1917; as a result, she was sentenced to [[Occoquan Workhouse]], but was pardoned less than a week later by President [[Woodrow Wilson]].

In 1918, representing Nevada, Martin was the first American woman to run for the US Senate.[2][3] Martin's campaigns focused on illuminating how women could act as a positive influence in the political world. Her platforms focused on providing better working conditions for men and women and nationalization of railroads and public utilities alienated women suffragists.
Between her 1918 and 1920 campaigns Martin wrote a series of articles and essays and in these essays Martin urges women to form autonomous political organizations.

Martin moved to Carmel, California in 1921, and recuperated from a heart attack in 1930.[1] In the 1940s, she received an honorary Doctorate of Laws from the University of Nevada (1945); and wrote two articles for the Encyclopædia Britannica (Josephine Butler, 1944 edition; and White Slavery, 1948 edition). Martin died in Carmel in 1951.

'''''Arcadie''''' is an English [[webcomic]] created by Dutch artist Ties Wijnker. Described in its tagline as "Comics for people," ''Arcadie'' revolves around a broad range of subjects, often dealing with the conditions and experiences of individual characters within modern life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ovelhasvoadoras.com.br/2016/09/retrato-homem-moderno.html|title= Essa tirinha é um retrato do "homem moderno"|date= September 2, 2016|accessdate=September 6, 2016|work=Ovelhas Voadoras|publisher=www.ovelhasvoadoras.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recurrent themes include [[irony]], [[technology]], [[entertainment]], [[boredom]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], and [[Fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]]. Many of the comics contain absurd or [[surrealist]] characters and premises, and they often lack a clear plot or traditional punchline.

== Style and format ==

''Arcadie'' features self-contained comics, with characters and settings changing per comic. They are organized in a single-page format, with the amount of [[Panel (comics)|panels]] per comic ranging from three to several dozen. Every comic comes with an additional short text placed under it, elaborating on its ideas. The artwork consists of digital linework and coloring with little shading, producing a [[minimalist]] aesthetic.

'''Authoritarianism''' is a term [[political scientist]]s use for a worldview that values [[orderliness]] and [[authority]], and distrusts outsiders and [[social change]]. As a form of [[government]], it is characterized by strong central power and limited [[political freedom]]s. Individual economic or personal freedoms are subordinate to the state and there is no constitutional [[accountability]] under an authoritarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/3/1/11127424/trump-authoritarianism&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.vox.com/2016/4/28/11431892/after-trump-how-authoritarian-voters-will-change-american-politics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gap"&gt;{{cite book|title=Government and Politics - Volume I|last=Sekiguchi|first=Masashi|publisher=EOLSS Publications|isbn=9781905839698|page=92|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Gkm5DAAAQBAJ|accessdate=26 December 2016|date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Linz]]'s influential 1964 description of authoritarianism&lt;ref&gt;Richard Shorten, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=8ffbV8ZpQ3MC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012), p. 256 (note 67).&lt;/ref&gt; characterized authoritarian [[political system]]s by four qualities:
# Limited [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|political pluralism]], that is such regimes place constraints on political institutions and groups like [[legislature]]s, [[Political party|political parties]] and [[interest group]]s;
# A basis for [[Political legitimacy|legitimacy]] based on emotion, especially the identification of the regime as a necessary evil to combat "easily recognizable societal problems" such as [[underdevelopment]] or [[insurgency]]; 
# Minimal [[social mobilization]] most often caused by constraints on the public such as suppression of political opponents and anti-regime activity;
# Informally defined executive power with often vague and shifting powers.&lt;ref&gt;Gretchen Casper, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7ZVDjmr18f4C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Fragile Democracies: The Legacies of Authoritarian Rule], pp. 40–50 (citing Linz 1964).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authoritarian government and states==
===Types===
Linz distinguished new forms of authoritarianism from personalistic dictatorships and totalitarian states, taking [[Francoist Spain]] as an example. Unlike personalistic dictatorships, new forms of authoritarianism have institutionalized representation of a variety of actors (in Spain's case, including the military, the [[Catholic Church]], [[Falange Española y de las JONS|Falange]], [[Monarchism|monarchists]], [[technocrat]]s and others). Unlike totalitarian states, the regime relies on passive mass acceptance rather than popular support.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Landman, ''Studying Human Rights'' (Routledge, 2003), p. 71 (citing Linz 1964 and others).&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars also mention the emergence of a different type of regime - the hybrid regime - in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mufti |first1=Mariam |title=What Do We Know about Hybrid Regimes after Two Decades of Scholarship? |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=5 |pages=112 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1400 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1400|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several subtypes of authoritarian regimes have been identified by Linz and others.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"&gt;Mark J. Gasiorowski, [{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=uxO2QHFzlZsC |page=105 }} The Political Regimes Project], in ''On Measuring Democracy: Its Consequences and Concomitants'' (ed. Alex Inketes), 2006, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Linz identified the two most basic subtypes as traditional authoritarian regimes and bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes:
* Traditional authoritarian regimes are those "in which the ruling authority (generally a single person)" is maintained in power "through a combination of appeals to traditional legitimacy, [[Clientelism|patron-client ties]] and repression, which is carried out by an apparatus bound to the ruling authority through personal loyalties". An example is [[Ethiopia]] under [[Haile Selassie&amp;nbsp;I]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; 
* Bureaucratic-military authoritarian regimes are those "governed by a [[military junta|coalition of military officers]] and technocrats who act pragmatically (rather than ideologically) within the limits of their bureaucratic mentality."&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]] suggests that it is best to distinguish "simple military authoritarian regimes" from "bureaucratic authoritarian regimes" in which "a powerful group of technocrats uses the state apparatus to try to rationalize and develop the economy" such as [[South Korea]] under [[Park Chung-hee]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Linz also has identified three other subtypes of authoritarian regime: [[Corporatism|corporatist]] or organic-statistic, racial and ethnic "democracy" and post-totalitarian.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Corporatist authoritarian regimes "are those in which corporatism institutions are used extensively by the state to coopt and demobilize powerful interest groups". This type has been studied most extensively in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Racial and ethnic "democracies" are those in which "certain racial or ethnic groups enjoy full democratic rights while others are largely or entirely denied those rights", such as in [[South Africa under apartheid]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;
* Post-totalitarian authoritarian regimes are those in which totalitarian institutions (such as the party, [[secret police]] and state-controlled mass media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heinrich |first1=Andreas |last2=Pleines |first2=Heiko |title=The Meaning of 'Limited Pluralism' in Media Reporting under Authoritarian Rule |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=103 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1238 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1238|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) remain, but where "ideological orthodoxy has declined in favor of routinization, repression has declined, the state's top leadership is less personalized and more secure, and the level of mass mobilization has declined substantially".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski" /&gt; Examples include the [[Russian Federation]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Eastern bloc]] states in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt;

Authoritarian regimes are also sometimes subcategorized by whether they are personalistic or [[Populism|populist]].&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes are characterized by arbitrary rule and [[authority]] exercised "mainly through patronage networks and coercion rather than through institutions and formal rules".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Personalistic authoritarian regimes have been seen in post-colonial Africa. By contrast, populist authoritarian regimes "are mobilizational regimes in which a strong, charismatic, manipulative leader rules through a coalition involving key lower-class groups".&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Examples include [[Argentina]] under [[Juan Perón|Perón]],&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; Egypt under Nasser&lt;ref name="Gasiorowski"/&gt; and [[Venezuela]]  under [[Hugo Chávez|Chávez]] and [[Nicolás Maduro|Maduro]].&lt;ref&gt;Juan de Onis, [http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/blog/juan-de-onis/after-chavez-authoritarianism-still-threatens-latin-america "After Chavez, Authoritarianism Still Threatens Latin America"], ''World Affairs'' (May 15, 2013): "the followers of the late President Hugo Chávez continue to apply the playbook of authoritarian populism throughout Latin America in their pursuit of more power...one of the Mercosur partners are challenging the basic political practices of authoritarian populism implanted in Venezuela."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Weyland, [http://www.journalofdemocracy.org/article/latin-america%E2%80%99s-authoritarian-drift-threat-populist-left "Latin America's Authoritarian Drift: The Threat from the Populist Left"], ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'', Vol. 23, Issue 3 (July 2013), pp. 18–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism is characterized by highly concentrated and [[Centralized government|centralized]] power maintained by [[political repression]] and the exclusion of potential challengers. It uses [[Political party|political parties]] and mass organizations to mobilize people around the goals of the regime.&lt;ref name="Vestal"&gt;Theodore M. Vesta, ''[{{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=XWXtXOl56KkC&amp;c |page=17 }} Ethiopia: A Post-Cold War African State]''. Greenwood, 1999, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adam Przeworski]] has theorized that "authoritarian equilibrium rests mainly on lies, fear and economic prosperity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Democracy and the Market: Political and Economic Reforms in Eastern Europe and Latin America|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Mfjv6snK0-EC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 1991-07-26|isbn = 9780521423359|first = Adam|last = Przeworski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authoritarianism also tends to embrace the informal and unregulated exercise of [[Power (politics)|political power]], a leadership that is "self-appointed and even if elected cannot be displaced by citizens' free choice among competitors", the arbitrary deprivation of [[civil liberties]] and little tolerance for meaningful [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

A range of [[social control]]s also attempt to stifle [[civil society]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hsu|first=Jennifer Y. J.|last2=Hsu|first2=Carolyn L.|last3=Hasmath|first3=Reza|date=2016|title=NGO Strategies in an Authoritarian Context, and their Implications for Citizenship: The Case of the People's Republic of China|ssrn=2657187|journal=|location=|publisher=American Sociological Association Annual Meeting (Seattle), August 20–23.|volume=|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; while political stability is maintained by control over and support of the [[military|armed forces]], a bureaucracy staffed by the regime and creation of [[allegiance]] through various means of [[socialization]] and indoctrination.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarian political systems may be weakened through "inadequate performance to demands of the people".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Vestal writes that the tendency to respond to challenges to authoritarianism through tighter control instead of [[adaptation]] is a significant weakness and that this overly rigid approach fails to "adapt to changes or to accommodate growing demands on the part of the populace or even groups within the system".&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; Because the [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state is dependent on performance, authoritarian states that fail to adapt may collapse.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

Authoritarianism is marked by "indefinite political tenure" of the ruler or [[ruling party]] (often in a [[one-party state]]) or other authority.&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt; The transition from an authoritarian system to a more [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government is referred to as [[democratization]].&lt;ref name="Vestal"/&gt;

John Duckitt suggests a link between authoritarianism and [[collectivism]], asserting that both stand in opposition to [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Duckitt | first1 = J. | title = Authoritarianism and Group Identification: A New View of an Old Construct | jstor = 3791588 | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1 | pages = 63–84 | year = 1989 | doi = 10.2307/3791588  |registration=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duckitt writes that both authoritarianism and collectivism submerge [[individual rights]] and goals to group goals, expectations and [[Conformity|conformities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kemmelmeier | first1 = M. | last2 = Burnstein | first2 = E. | last3 = Krumov | first3 = K. | last4 = Genkova | first4 = P. | last5 = Kanagawa | first5 = C. | last6 = Hirshberg | first6 = M.

===Authoritarianism and totalitarianism===
{{Revolution sidebar}}

[[Totalitarianism]] is an extreme version of authoritarianism. Authoritarianism primarily differs from totalitarianism in that social and economic institutions exist that are not under governmental control. Building on the work of Yale political scientist Juan Linz, Paul C. Sondrol of the [[University of Colorado at Colorado Springs]] has examined the characteristics of authoritarian and totalitarian dictators and organized them in a chart:&lt;ref name="Sondrol"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Sondrol |first1 = P. C. |title = Totalitarian and Authoritarian Dictators: A Comparison of Fidel Castro and Alfredo Stroessner |journal = Journal of Latin American Studies |volume = 23 |issue = 3 |page = 599 |year = 2009 |doi = 10.1017/S0022216X00015868}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sondrol argues that while both authoritarianism and totalitarianism are forms of [[autocracy]], they differ in "key [[Dichotomy|dichotomies]]":
{{quote|(1) Unlike their bland and generally unpopular authoritarian brethren, totalitarian dictators develop a [[charisma]]tic "[[Cult of personality|mystique]]" and a mass-based, pseudo-democratic [[interdependence]] with their followers via the conscious manipulation of a prophetic image.
(2) [[wikt:concomitant|Concomitant]] role conceptions differentiate totalitarians from authoritarians. Authoritarians view themselves as individual beings largely content to control and often maintain the status quo. Totalitarian self-conceptions are largely [[Teleology|teleological]]. The [[tyrant]] is less a person than an indispensable function to guide and reshape the universe.

(3) Consequently, the utilisation of power for personal aggrandizement is more evident among authoritarians than totalitarians. Lacking the binding appeal of [[ideology]], authoritarians support their rule by a mixture of instilling fear and granting rewards to loyal collaborators, engendering a [[kleptocracy]].&lt;ref name="Sondrol"/&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Compared to totalitarianism, "the authoritarian state still maintains a certain distinction between state and society. It is only concerned with political power and as long as that is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty. Totalitarianism, on the other hand, invades [[private life]] and asphyxiates it".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"&gt;Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Another distinction is that "authoritarianism is not animated by utopian ideals in the way totalitarianism is. It does not attempt to change the world and human nature".&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt; [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that "a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of ... industrial mass society" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.&lt;ref name="Cinpoes"/&gt;

===Authoritarianism and democracy===
{{Individualism sidebar}}
Authoritarianism and democracy are not fundamentally opposed to one another, as it is possible for democracies to possess authoritarian elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frantz |first1=Erica |title=Authoritarian Politics: Trends and Debates |journal=Politics and Governance |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=87 |doi=10.17645/pag.v6i2.1498 |url=https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/view/1498|year=2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[illiberal democracy]] (or [[procedural democracy]]) is distinguished from [[liberal democracy]] (or [[substantive democracy]]) in that illiberal democracies lack features such as the [[rule of law]], protections for minority groups and an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]].&lt;ref&gt;
* Thomas H. Henriksen, ''American Power after the Berlin Wall'' (Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 199: "experts emphasize that elections alone, without the full democratic panoply of an independent judiciary, free press, and viable political parties, constitute, in reality, illiberal democracies, which still menace their neighbors and destabilize their regions."
*  David P. Forsythe, ''Human Rights in International Relations'' (Cambridge University Press, 2012), p. 231: "Illiberal democracies may have reasonably free and fair national elections based on broad suffrage, but they do not counteract the tyranny of the majority with effective protections for ethnic and religious minorities or various types of dissenters."
* Rod Hague &amp; Martin Harrop, ''Political Science: A Comparative Introduction'' (7th ed.: Palgrave Macmillan: 2007), p. 259: "The gradual implementation of the rule of law and due process is an accomplishment of liberal politics, provide a basis for distinguishing liberal from illiberal democracies, and both from authoritarian regimes."
* Vladimir Popov, "Circumstances versus Policy Choices: Why Has the Economic Performance of the Soviet Successor States Been So Poor" in ''After the Collapse of Communism: Comparative Lessons of Transition'' (eds. [[Michael McFaul]] &amp; Kathryn Stoner-Weiss: Cambridge University Press, 2004), p. 20: "The least efficient institutions are in illiberal democracies combining poor rule of law with democracy ... Less democratic regimes with weak rule of law ... appear to do better than illiberal democracies in maintaining institutional capacity."&lt;/ref&gt;

A further distinction that liberal democracies have rarely made war with one another; research has extended the theory and finds that more democratic countries tend to have few wars (sometimes called [[militarized interstate dispute]]s) causing fewer battle deaths with one another and that democracies have far fewer [[civil war]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

Some commentators, such as [[Seymour Martin Lipset]], believed that low-income authoritarian regimes have certain technocratic "efficiency-enhancing advantages" over low-income democracies, helping authoritarian regimes generate development.&lt;ref name="Halperin"&gt;Morton H. Halperin, Joseph T. Siegle, &amp; Michael M. Weinstein, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JiNLH1I50PkC The Democracy Advantage: How Democracies Promote Prosperity and Peace]'' ([[Council on Foreign Relations]]/Psychology Press, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Morton H. Halperin]], Joseph T. Siegle and Michael M. Weinstein (2005) counter this belief, arguing that the evidence has shown that there is no "authoritarian advantage" and that there is a "democratic advantage" instead.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin et al. argue that democracies "realize superior development performance" over authoritarianism. They point out that poor democracies are more likely to have steadier economic growth and less likely to experience economic and humanitarian catastrophes than authoritarian regimes; that civil liberties act as a curb on corruption and misuse of resources; and that democracies are more adaptable.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt; Halperin point out that the vast majority of refugee crises and financial catastrophes occur in authoritarian regimes.&lt;ref name="Halperin"/&gt;

Studies suggest that several health indicators (life expectancy and infant and maternal mortality) have a stronger and more significant association with democracy than they have with [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita, size of the public sector or income inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1 = Franco |first1 = Á. |last2 = Álvarez-Dardet |first2 = C. |last3 = Ruiz |first3 = M.

==Characteristics==
===Systemic weakness and resilience===
[[Andrew J. Nathan]] notes that "regime theory holds that authoritarian systems are inherently fragile because of weak legitimacy, overreliance on coercion, overcentralization of decision making, and the predominance of personal power over institutional norms....Few authoritarian regimes—be they communist, fascist, corporatist, or personalist—have managed to conduct orderly, peaceful, timely, and stable successions".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"&gt;Andrew J. Nathan, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/38546/summary "Authoritarian Resilience"], ''Journal of Democracy'', 14.1 (2003), pp. 6–17.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception to this general trend is the endurance of the authoritarian rule of the [[Chinese Communist Party]], which has been unusually resilient among authoritarian regimes.  Nathan posits that this can be attributed to four factors: (1) "the increasingly norm-bound nature of its succession politics"; (2) "the increase in meritocratic as opposed to factional considerations in the promotion of political elites"; (3) "the differentiation and functional specialization of institutions within the regime"; and (4) "the establishment of institutions for political participation and appeal that strengthen the CCP's legitimacy among the public at large".&lt;ref name="NathanAuthoritarian"/&gt;

===Gender and authoritarianism===
According to a study by Brandt and Henry, there is a direct correlation between the rates of [[gender inequality]] and the levels of authoritarian ideas in the male and female populations. It was found that in countries with less gender equality where individualism was encouraged and men occupied the dominant societal roles, women were more likely to support traits such as obedience which would allow them to survive in an authoritarian environment and less likely to encourage ideas such as independence and imagination. In countries with higher levels of gender equality, men held less authoritarian views. It is theorized that this occurs due to the stigma attached to individuals who question the cultural norms set by the dominant individuals and establishments in an authoritarian society as a way to prevent the psychological stress caused by the active ostracizing of the stigmatized individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Mark J. |last=Brandt |first2=P.

There is no precise definition of authoritarianism, but several annual measurements are attempted, including [[Freedom House]]’s annual [[Freedom in the World]] report.

===Current===
The following is a non-exhaustive list of examples of states which are currently (or frequently) characterized as authoritarian:

==Historical trends==
===Anti-authoritarianism===
{{Main|Anti-authoritarianism}}
Both [[World War II]] (ending in 1945) and the later [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union]] (1991) resulted in the replacement of authoritarian regimes by either democratic regimes or regimes that were less authoritarian.

[[World War II]] saw the defeat of the [[Axis powers]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]]. All the Axis powers — [[Nazi Germany]], Fascist Italy and the [[Empire of Japan]] — had totalitarian or authoritarian governments, and two of the three were replaced by governments based on democratic constitutions. The [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]] were an alliance of Democratic states and (later) the Communist [[Soviet Union]]. At least in Western Europe the initial post-war era embraced pluralism and freedom of expression in areas that had been under control of authoritarian regimes.  The memory of fascism and nazism was denigrated. The new [[Federal Republic of Germany]] banned its expression.  In reaction to the centralism of the Nazi state, for example, the new constitution of West Germany ([[Federal Republic of Germany]]) exercised "[[separation of powers]]" and  placed "[[Law enforcement in Germany|law enforcement]] firmly in the hands" of the sixteen ''[[States of Germany|Länder]]'' or states of the republic, not with the federal German government (at least not at first).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bmi.bund.de/EN/topics/security/federal-police/federal-police-node.html The Federal Police]. Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community of Germany&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally there was also a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on [[anti-fascism]] in Western Europe. This was attributed to the active resistance from [[German-occupied Europe|occupation]] and to fears arising from the development of [[superpower]]s.&lt;ref name="swcjsb"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sign Wars: The Culture Jammers Strike Back! |last=Cox |first=David |year=2005 |publisher=LedaTape Organisation |isbn=978-0-9807701-5-5 |page=108 |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=zKo8DrmamAwC |page= }} |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-authoritarianism also became associated with [[countercultural]] and [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] movements such as the [[Beat Generation]] in the 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americannovel/timeline/beatgeneration.html|title=Retired Site PBS Programs |website=pbs.org|accessdate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[hippies]] in the 1960s&lt;ref name="Stonepolitics"&gt;"The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom&amp;nbsp;... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe."{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm "The Way of the Hippy"]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Punk subculture|punk]]s in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last = McLaughlin | first = Paul | title = Anarchism and Authority | publisher = Ashgate | location = Aldershot | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-7546-6196-2 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South America, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Chile and Uruguay moved away from dictatorships to democracy between 1982 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The challenge of the past |journal=The Economist |date=22 October 1998 |url=https://www.economist.com/the-americas/1998/10/22/the-challenge-of-the-past |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989 and [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union]] in [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991]], the other authoritarian/totalitarian "half" of the Allied Powers of WWII collapsed. This led not so much to revolt against authority in general, but to the belief that authoritarian states (and state control of economies) were outdated. 
&lt;ref name="Tharoor-wapo-2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tharoor |first1=Ishaan |title=The man who declared `the end of history` fears for democracy's future |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/02/09/the-man-who-declared-the-end-of-history-fears-for-democracys-future/?noredirect=on |accessdate=4 October 2018 |agency=Washington Post |date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The idea that "liberal democracy was the final form toward which all political striving was directed",&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; became very popular in Western countries and was celebrated in [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s book ''[[The End of History and the Last Man]]''.&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"/&gt; According to Charles H. Fairbanks, Jr., "all the new states that stumbled out of the ruins of the Soviet bloc, except Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, seemed indeed to be moving toward democracy in the early 1990s," as where the countries of East Central Europe and the Balkans.&lt;ref name="causes-2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Fairbanks, Jr. |first1=Charles H. |title=Causes of Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Republics |url=https://ge.boell.org/en/2014/01/16/causes-authoritarianism-former-soviet-republics |website=Heinrich Boell Stiftung |accessdate=5 October 2018 |date=16 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2010, the "[[Arab Spring]]" arose in response to unrest over economic stagnation but also in opposition to oppressive authoritarian regimes, first in [[Tunisia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/01/19/uk-tunisia-protests-bouaziziidUKTRE70I7TV20110119|title=Peddler’s martyrdom launched Tunisia’s revolution.

Regimes were toppled in  [[Tunisia]] [[Libya]], [[Egypt]], and [[Yemen]], and other countries saw riots, civil wars or insurgencies.&lt;ref name="NYRB-Ruthven"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ruthven|first1=Malise|title=How to Understand ISIS|journal=New York Review of Books|date=23 June 2016|volume=63|issue=11|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|accessdate=12 June 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807014415/http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2016/06/23/how-to-understand-isis/|archivedate=7 August 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Authoritarian revival===
From 2005 to 2015 observers noted what some called a "democratic recession"&lt;ref name="Ignatieff-nyrb"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ignatieff |first1=Michael |title=Are the Authoritarians Winning? |journal=New York Review of Books |date=10 July 2014 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/28/hitlers-rise-it-can-happen-here/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levitsky |first1=Steven |last2=Way |first2=Lucan |title=The Myth of Democratic Recession |journal=Journal of Democracy |date=January 2015 |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=45–58 |accessdate=4 October 2018 |url=https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/sites/default/files/Levitsky-26-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (although some — Steven Levitsky and Lucan Way — have disputed this theory).&lt;ref name="Levitsky-myth"/&gt; 
In 2018 [[Freedom House]] declared that from 2006 to 2018, "113 countries" around the world showed "a net decline" in "political rights and civil liberties" while "only 62" experienced "a net improvement."&lt;ref name="FH-2018"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom in the World 2018 Democracy in Crisis |url=https://freedomhouse.org/report/freedom-world/freedom-world-2018 |website=Freedom House |accessdate=4 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 2018, U.S. political journalist David Frum stated:

'''[[Burmese name#Honorifics|Bo]] Mya''' ({{lang-my|ဘိုမြ}} {{IPA-my|bò mja̰|}}; born '''Htee Moo Kee'''; 20 January 1927 – 24 December 2006) was a [[Karen people|Karen]] rebel leader born in Papun District, which is in present-day [[Karen State]], [[Myanmar]]. He was a long-standing chairman of the [[Karen National Union]] (KNU), a political organisation of the [[Karen people]], from 1976 to 2000. He stepped down to become vice-chairman in 2004, and retired in 2004 from all public offices, due to poor health.

==Early career==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Bo Mya was among a significant number of Karens who joined the British — specifically in Bo Mya's case, Force 136 — during [[World War II]], with whom he fought the Japanese from the [[Dawna Range|East Dawna hills]] in 1944 to 1945.

After the Karens declared independence from Burma in 1949, Bo Mya quickly rose to a position of pre-eminence in the Karen movement, earning a reputation as a hard and ruthless operator. Based at [[Manerplaw]] ("victory field") close to the Thai-Burma border, the KNU under his control, and its military wing the [[Karen National Liberation Army]] (KNLA), was probably the most successful of the ethnic rebel organisations fighting [[Yangon|Rangoon]] in the [[Karen Conflict]] in the 1970s and 1980s.

==1990s==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
But by the mid-1990s, the tide was turning against him. A devout  [[Christianity|Christian]] of the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], Bo Mya had always risked antagonising elements from within the predominantly [[Buddhism|Karen Buddhist]] and [[Animism|animist]] KNLA ranks. Although his defenders say he treated both Christians and Buddhists equally, the fact that the top positions of the KNU were filled almost entirely by Christians seemed to confirm the impression that he promoted the minority Christians' interests at the expense of those of the Buddhists and animists.

In late 1994, a group of KNLA soldiers broke away from the main army and formed the [[Democratic Karen Buddhist Army]] (DKBA). They allied themselves with the Burmese military, and led Burmese troops into Manerplaw in December 1994, leading to its capture — the biggest single setback to the Karens in their post-war history.

Since then, the KNU and KNLA's effectiveness has gradually diminished. This was demonstrated at the beginning of 2004 when Bo Mya travelled to [[Yangon]] (Rangoon), his first visit to the capital in 50 years, to hold peace talks with [[Khin Nyunt]], who was Prime Minister at the time.

==Death==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
{{Portal|Seventh-day Adventist Church|Christianity|Biography}}
On 24 December 2006, Bo Mya died in a hospital in [[Mae Sot]], [[Thailand]], near the eastern border of Myanmar. He had [[heart disease]] and [[diabetes]] and was unable to walk for three years before his death.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4700">In [[physics]], a '''coincidence circuit''' is an [[electronic device]] with one output and two (or more) inputs. The output activates only when the circuit receives signals within a time window accepted as ''at the same time'' and in parallel at both inputs. Coincidence circuits are widely used in [[particle detector]]s and in other areas of science and technology.  

[[Walther Bothe]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1954 "...for his discovery of the method of coincidence and the discoveries subsequently made by it." [[Bruno Rossi]] invented the electronic coincidence circuit for implementing the [[coincidence method]].

==History==
===Bothe, 1924===
In his Nobel Prize lecture,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1954/bothe-lecture.html |title=Nobel Lecture |author=Bothe, Walther |year=1954 |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}} &lt;/ref&gt; Bothe described how he had implemented the [[coincidence method]] in an experiment on [[Compton scattering]] in 1924. The experiment aimed to check whether Compton scattering produces a [[recoil electron]] simultaneously with the scattered [[gamma ray]]. Bothe used two point discharge counters connected to separate fibre [[electrometer]]s and recorded the fibre  deflections on a moving photographic film. On the film record he could discern coincident discharges with a time resolution of approximately 1&amp;nbsp;[[millisecond]].

===Bothe and Kohlhörster, 1929===
In 1929, Walther Bothe and [[Werner Kolhörster]] published the description of a coincidence experiment with tubular discharge counters that [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Wilhelm Müller]] had invented in 1928. The Bothe-Kohlhörster experiment showed penetrating charged particles in [[cosmic ray]]s. They used the same mechanical-photographic method for recording simultaneous discharges which, in this experiment, signalled the passage of a charged cosmic ray particle through both counters and through thick wall of lead and iron that surrounded the counters. Their paper, entitled ''Das Wesen der Höhenstrahlung"'', was published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' v.56, p.751 (1929).

===Rossi, 1930===
Bruno Rossi, at the age of 24, was in his first job as assistant in the Physics Institute of the [[University of Florence]] when he read the Bothe-Kohlhörster paper. It inspired him to begin his own research on cosmic rays. He fabricated [[Geiger tube]]s according to the published recipe, and he invented the first practical electronic coincident circuit. It employed several [[triode]] [[vacuum tube]]s, and could register coincident pulses from any number of counters with a tenfold improvement in time resolution over the mechanical method of Bothe. Rossi described his invention in a paper entitled "Method of Registering Multiple Simultaneous Impulses of Several Geiger Counters", published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' v.125, p.636 (1930). The Rossi coincidence circuit was rapidly adopted by experimenters around the world. It was the first practical [[Logical conjunction|AND]] circuit, precursor of the AND logic circuits of [[electronic computer]]s. 

To detect the voltage pulse produced by the coincidence circuit when a coincidence event occurred, Rossi first used earphones and counted the ‘clicks’, and soon an electro-mechanical register to count the coincidence pulses automatically. Rossi used a triple-coincidence version of his circuit with various configurations of Geiger counters in a series of experiments during the period from 1930 to 1943 that laid an essential part of the foundations of cosmic-ray and particle physics. 

About the same time, and independently of Rossi, Bothe devised a less practical electronic coincidence device. It used a single [[pentode]] vacuum tube and could register only twofold coincidences.

==Probability==
The main idea of 'coincidence detection' in signal processing is that if a detector detects a signal pulse in the midst of random noise pulses inherent in the detector, there is a certain probability, &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;, that the detected pulse is actually a noise pulse. But if two detectors detect the signal pulse simultaneously, the probability that it is a noise pulse in the detectors is &lt;math&gt;P^2&lt;/math&gt;. Suppose &lt;math&gt;P=0.1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;P^2=0.01&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the chance of a false detection is reduced by the use of coincidence detection.

A '''Cornelian dilemma''' (''dilemme cornélien'') (spelled in translation with two "l"'s i.e. "Corneillian") is a [[dilemma]] for someone to oblige and choose from each options, revealing a detrimental effect on anyone. It involves the character experiencing an inner conflict, forcing them to choose between [[love]] with [[honour]] or [[Desire (philosophy)|desire]] with [[duty]]. It is introduced in ''[[Le Cid]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13838">The '''curse of knowledge''' is a [[cognitive bias]] that occurs when an individual, communicating with other individuals, unknowingly assumes that the others have the background to understand.&lt;ref name=Kennedy1995&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennedy|first1=Jane|title=Debiasing the Curse of Knowledge in Audit Judgment|journal=The Accounting Review|date=1995|volume=70|issue=2|pages=249–273|jstor=248305}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a classroom setting, teachers have difficulty teaching novices because they cannot put themselves in the position of the student. A brilliant professor might no longer remember the difficulties that a young student encounters when learning a new subject. This curse of knowledge also explains the danger behind thinking about student learning based on what appears best to faculty members, as opposed to what has been verified with students.&lt;ref name=Wieman2007 /&gt;

== History of concept==
The term "curse of knowledge" was coined in a 1989 ''Journal of Political Economy'' article by economists [[Colin Camerer]], [[George Loewenstein]], and Martin Weber. The aim of their research was to counter the "conventional assumptions in such (economic) analyses of asymmetric information in that better-informed agents can accurately anticipate the judgement of less-informed agents".&lt;ref name=IEEE&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1109/FIE.2008.4720529|chapter=Faculty development strategies for overcoming the "curse of knowledge"|title=2008 38th Annual Frontiers in Education Conference|pages=|year=2008|last1=Froyd|first1=Jeff|last2=Layne|first2=Jean|isbn=978-1-4244-1969-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such research drew from [[Baruch Fischhoff]]'s work in 1975 surrounding [[hindsight bias]], a cognitive bias that knowing the outcome of a certain event makes it seem more predictable than may actually be true.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Camerer|first1=Colin|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|last3=Weber|first3=Martin|title=The Curse of Knowledge in Economic Settings: An Experimental Analysis|journal=Journal of Political Economy|date=1989|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1232–1254|doi=10.1086/261651|url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/22171/1/1831894%5B1%5D.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150306005841/http://authors.library.caltech.edu/22171/1/1831894%5B1%5D.pdf|archivedate=2015-03-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research conducted by Fischhoff revealed that participants did not know that their outcome knowledge affected their responses, and, if they did know, they could still not ignore or defeat the effects of the bias. Study participants could not accurately reconstruct their previous, less knowledgeable states of mind, which directly relates to the curse of knowledge. This poor reconstruction was theorized by Fischhoff to be because the participant was "anchored in the hindsightful state of mind created by receipt of knowledge".&lt;ref name="Fischhoff"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischhoff|first1=Baruch|title=Hindsight is not equal to foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|date=1975|volume=1|issue=3|pages=288–299|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.1.3.288 }} Reprinted: {{cite journal|last1=Fischhoff|first1=Baruch|title=Hindsight is not equal to foresight: The effect of outcome knowledge on judgment under uncertainty|pmid=12897366|pmc=1743746|volume=12|year=2003|journal=Qual Saf Health Care|pages=304–11|doi=10.1136/qhc.12.4.304}}&lt;/ref&gt; This receipt of knowledge returns to the idea of the curse proposed by Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber: a knowledgeable person cannot accurately reconstruct what a person, be it themselves or someone else, without the knowledge would think, or how they would act. In his paper, Fischhoff questions the failure to empathize with ourselves in less knowledgeable states, and notes that how well people manage to reconstruct perceptions of lesser informed others is a crucial question for historians and "all human understanding".&lt;ref name="Fischhoff" /&gt;

This research led the economists Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber to focus on the economic implications of the concept and question whether the curse harms the allocation of resources in an economic setting. The idea that better-informed parties may suffer losses in a deal or exchange was seen as something important to bring to the sphere of economic theory. Most theoretical analyses of situations where one party knew less than the other focused on how the lesser-informed party attempted to learn more information to minimize [[information asymmetry]]. However, in these analyses, there is an assumption that better-informed parties can optimally exploit their information asymmetry when they, in fact, cannot. People cannot utilize their additional, better information, even when they should in a bargaining situation.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;

For example, two people are bargaining over dividing money or provisions. One party may know the size of the amount being divided while the other does not. However, to fully exploit his advantage, the informed party should make the same offer regardless of the amount of material to be divided.&lt;ref&gt;

==Experimental evidence==
A 1990 experiment by a Stanford graduate student, Elizabeth Newton, illustrated the curse of knowledge in the results of a simple task. A group of subjects were asked to "tap" out well known songs with their fingers, while another group tried to name the melodies. When the "tappers" were asked to predict how many of the "tapped" songs would be recognized by listeners, they would always overestimate. The curse of knowledge is demonstrated here as the "tappers" are so familiar with what they were tapping that they assumed listeners would easily recognize the tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Heath|first1=Chip|last2=Heath|first2=Dan|title=The Curse of Knowledge|url=https://hbr.org/2006/12/the-curse-of-knowledge|accessdate=26 April 2016|publisher=Harvard Business Review|date=Dec 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Susan Birch and Paul Bloom involving Yale undergraduate students used the curse of knowledge concept to explain the idea that the ability of people to reason about another person's actions is compromised by the knowledge of the outcome of an event. The perception the participant had of the plausibility of an event also mediated the extent of the bias. If the event was less plausible, knowledge was not as much of a "curse" as when there was a potential explanation for the way the other person could act.&lt;ref name="Birch-Bloom"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=S. A.J.|last2=Bloom|first2=P.|title=The Curse of Knowledge in Reasoning About False Beliefs|journal=Psychological Science|date=2007|volume=18|issue=5|pages=382–386|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2007.01909.x|pmid=17576275|url=http://bobweigel.net/projects/images/Birch%26bloom_curse.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507215639/http://bobweigel.net/projects/images/Birch%26bloom_curse.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a recent replication study found that this finding was not reliably reproducible across seven experiments with large sample sizes, and the true effect size of this phenomenon was less than half of that reported in the original findings. Therefore, it is suggested that "the influence of plausibility on the curse of knowledge in adults appears to be small enough that its impact on real-life perspective-taking may need to be reevaluated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0092406|title=Do Adults Show a Curse of Knowledge in False-Belief Reasoning? A Robust Estimate of the True Effect Size|first1=Rachel A.|last1=Ryskin|first2=Sarah|last2=Brown-Schmidt|date=25 March 2014|publisher=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=9|issue=3|pages=e92406|via=PLoS Journals|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0092406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have linked the curse of knowledge bias with false-belief reasoning in both children and adults, as well as [[theory of mind]] development difficulties in children.

Related to this finding is the phenomenon experienced by players of [[charades]]: The actor may find it frustratingly hard to believe that his or her teammates keep failing to guess the secret phrase, known only to the actor, conveyed by [[pantomime]].

==Implications==
In the Camerer, Loewenstein and Weber's article, it is mentioned that the setting closest in structure to the market experiments done would be underwriting, a task in which well-informed experts price goods that are sold to a less-informed public. Investment bankers value securities, experts taste cheese, store buyers observe jewelry being modeled, and theater owners see movies before they are released. They then sell those goods to a less-informed public. If they suffer from the curse of knowledge, high-quality goods will be overpriced and low-quality goods underpriced relative to optimal, profit-maximizing prices; prices will reflect characteristics (e.g., quality) that are unobservable to uninformed buyers.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;

The curse of knowledge has a paradoxical effect in these settings. By making better-informed agents think that their knowledge is shared by others, the curse helps alleviate the inefficiencies that result from information asymmetries (a better informed party having an advantage in a bargaining situation), bringing outcomes closer to complete information. In such settings, the curse on individuals may actually improve social welfare.

== Applications ==
Economists Camerer, Loewenstein, and Weber first applied the curse of knowledge phenomenon to economics, in order to explain why and how the assumption that better-informed agents can accurately anticipate the judgments of lesser-informed agents is not inherently true. They also sought to support the finding that sales agents who are better informed about their products may, in fact, be at a disadvantage against other, less-informed agents when selling their products. The reason is said to be that better-informed agents fail to ignore the privileged knowledge that they possess and are thus "cursed" and unable to sell their products at a value that more naïve agents would deem acceptable.&lt;ref name="Camerer-Loewenstein-Weber"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Birch-Bernstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Birch|first1=Susan A. J.|last2=Bernstein|first2=Daniel M.|title=What Can Children Tell Us About Hindsight Bias: A Fundamental Constraint on Perspective–Taking?|journal=Social Cognition|date=2007|volume=25|issue=1|pages=98–113|doi=10.1521/soco.2007.25.1.98|url=http://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/downloads/Highsight_Bias_2007_Birch_and_Bernstein3964.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507215753/http://www.kpu.ca/sites/default/files/downloads/Highsight_Bias_2007_Birch_and_Bernstein3964.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that the curse of knowledge could contribute to the difficulty of teaching.&lt;ref name=Wieman2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wieman|first=Carl|title=The 'Curse of Knowledge', or Why Intuition About Teaching Often Fails|journal=APS News|date=2007|volume=16|issue=10|url=http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Wieman_APS_News_Back_Page_with_refs_Nov_2007.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410233551/http://www.cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/Wieman_APS_News_Back_Page_with_refs_Nov_2007.pdf|archivedate=2016-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The curse of knowledge means that it could be potentially ineffective, if not harmful, to think about how students are viewing and learning material by asking the perspective of the teacher as opposed to what has been verified by students. The teacher already has the knowledge that he or she is trying to impart, but the way that knowledge is conveyed may not be the best for those who do not already possess the knowledge.

'''Daniel A. Vallero''' is an American environmental author&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/Daniel-Vallero/ELS_1007685/ Author page at Elsevier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470259603.fmatter/summary/ Author page at John Wiley &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. He was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from [[Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville]].  He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the [[University of Kansas]] and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from [[Duke University]] with a thesis on "“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cee.duke.edu/faculty/daniel-vallero Faculty page at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/cee/faculty/daniel.vallero/files/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Vallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing [[plastic recycling]] on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on [[MSNBC]], and current state of ethics in research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/articles/2012/05/31/ethics-courses-trending-at-graduate-engineering-schools?page=2 U.S. News &amp; World Report]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/vallero_daniel_sed.pdf Researcher page at EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at [[Duke University]] from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been  adjunct Professor of  Engineering Ethics at  Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and  the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].
 
In his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged [[biomedical engineering]] with [[environmental engineering]]. He stresses the need to incorporate the [[social sciences]] into every engineering and design project.  As a leader in [[engineering ethics]], he has served the [[National Academy of Engineering]] as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised [[Sigma Xi]], universities and other institutions on science and [[research ethics]] and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

Vallero is editor for the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]' journal, ''Process Safety and Environmental Protection'', as well as the [[MDPI]] journal, ''Sustainability''. He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]] and the ''McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology''.

== Works ==

Vallero is a pioneer of [[green engineering]] and the application of [[life cycle analysis]] to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). Teaching green engineering: The case of ethanol life cycle analysis. Bulletin of
Science, Technology &amp; Society. 28 (3): 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like [[switchgrass]] (Panicum virgatum).

In the book, "DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath," &lt;ref&gt;P.J. Lioy (2010). DUST: The Inside Story of Its Role in the September 11th Aftermath (Forward By Tom Kean). Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|1-4422-0148-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late American scientist [[Paul Lioy]] credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the [[9/11]] attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero  and P. Lioy (2012). The 5-R’s: Reliable Post-Disaster Exposure Assessment. Leadership and Management and Engineering. 12 (4):  247-253. (October 2012). {{DOI|10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term "synthovation," as a new design process for green engineering and [[green architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional "concept to completion" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of [[design for environment]] (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the [[sustainability]] of the project over its entire [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]].

In her book, "Hormone Deception",&lt;ref&gt;L. Berkson (2010), Hormone Deception. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition, {{ISBN|1453741275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply [[exposure science]] to [[endocrine disruptors]].

'''David Peter Reimer''' (born '''Bruce Peter Reimer'''; 22 August 1965&amp;nbsp;– 4 May 2004) was a Canadian man born male but [[sex reassignment|reassigned]] as a girl and raised female following medical advice and intervention after his [[human penis|penis]] was accidentally destroyed during a botched [[circumcision]] in infancy.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a}}

The psychologist [[John Money]] oversaw the case and reported the reassignment as successful and as evidence that [[gender identity]] is primarily learned. The academic sexologist [[Milton Diamond]] later reported that Reimer's realization he was not a girl crystallized between the ages of 9 and 11 years{{sfn|Diamond|Sigmundson|1997}} and he transitioned to living as a male at age 15. Well known in medical circles for years anonymously as the "John/Joan" case, Reimer later went public with his story to help discourage similar medical practices. He committed [[suicide]] after suffering years of [[major depressive disorder|severe depression]], financial instability, and a troubled marriage.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit/&gt;

==Infancy==
Reimer was born in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], on August 22, 1965, the elder of identical twin boys.{{sfnm |1a1=Harper |1y=2007 |1p=43 |2a1=Rolls |2y=2015 |2p=133}} He was originally named Bruce and his identical twin was named Brian.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=133}} Their parents were Janet and Ron Reimer, a couple of [[Mennonite]] descent who had married the previous December.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=133}} At the age of six months, after concern was raised about how both of them urinated, the boys were diagnosed with [[phimosis]].{{sfnm |1a1=Colapinto |1y=2001a |1p=10 |2a1=Mann |2y=2016 |2pp=183–184}} They were referred for [[circumcision]] at the age of seven months. On April 27, 1966,  a [[urologist]] performed the operation using the unconventional method of [[electrocauterization]],{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=11–13}}&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck&gt;{{cite news |date=23 November 2010 |title=Health Check: The Boy Who Was Raised a Girl |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-11814300 |publisher=BBC News |access-date=19 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the procedure did not go as doctors had planned, and Bruce's penis was burned beyond surgical repair.{{sfn|Rolls|2015|p=134}} The doctors chose not to operate on Brian, whose phimosis soon cleared without surgical intervention.&lt;ref name=CBCnews&gt;{{cite news |date=10 May 2004 |title=David Reimer: The Boy Who Lived as a Girl |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/reimer/ |dead-url=yes |publisher=CBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807123535/http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/reimer/ |archive-date=7 August 2012 |access-date=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parents, concerned about their son's prospects for future happiness and sexual function without a penis, took him to [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] in early 1967 to see [[John Money]],{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|p=49}} a [[psychology|psychologist]] who was developing a reputation as a pioneer in the field of sexual development and [[gender identity]], based on his work with [[intersexuality|intersex]] patients.{{sfn|Mann|2016|p=184}} Money was a prominent proponent of the "theory of gender neutrality"—that gender identity developed primarily as a result of [[observational learning|social learning]] from early childhood and that it could be changed with the appropriate behavioural interventions.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=33–34}} The Reimers had seen Money being interviewed in February 1967 on the Canadian news program ''[[This Hour Has Seven Days]]'', during which he discussed his theories about gender.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=18–22, 39}}

Money and physicians working with young children born with [[intersex]] conditions believed that a penis could not be replaced but that a functional [[vagina]] could be constructed surgically. It was also the safest and most conventional pathway to take: Money told the parents it was what would be best for the boy.&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck/&gt;&lt;!-- the closest to this is Colapinto-2001 p.32: "it was easier for surgeons to construct a synthetic vagina than to create an artificial penis", but that source doesn't support the claim. --&gt; Money also claimed that Reimer would be more likely to achieve successful, functional sexual maturation as a girl than as a boy.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001b}}{{page needed|date=June 2016}}{{Failed verification|date=June 2016|reason=cannot find a supporting quote for this in Colapinto-2001 (print copy) }} For Money, a case where identical twin boys were involved where one could be raised as a girl provided a perfect test of his theories.&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-2000&gt;{{cite episode |date=7 December 2000 |title=The Boy Who Was Turned into a Girl |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2000/boyturnedgirl_transcript.shtml |series=[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup&gt;{{cite episode |year=2005 |title=Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis |series=[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]] |publisher=BBC |access-date=27 September 2014|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dr_money_prog_summary.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Money and the Hopkins team persuaded the baby's parents that [[sex reassignment surgery]] would be in Reimer's best interest.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=50–52}} At the age of 22 months, baby Bruce underwent a bilateral [[orchidectomy]], in which his [[testicle|testes]] were surgically removed and a rudimentary vulva was fashioned.{{sfn|Colapinto|2001a|pp=53–54}} Bruce was [[sex assignment|reassigned]] to be [[gender of rearing|raised as female]] and given the name Brenda.{{sfn|Marinucci|2010|p=124}} Psychological support for the reassignment and surgery was provided by{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=50–52}} John Money, who continued to see Reimer annually{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=136}} for consultations and to assess the outcome.{{sfn|Warnke|2008|p=16}} This reassignment was considered an especially valid test case{{sfn|Walker|2010|p=33}} of the social learning concept of gender identity for two reasons: First, Reimer's identical twin brother, Brian, made an ideal [[scientific control|control]] because the brothers shared genes, family environments, and the intrauterine environment. Second, this was reputed to be the first reassignment and reconstruction performed on a male infant who had no abnormality of prenatal or early postnatal [[sexual differentiation]].

==Later childhood and adolescence==
Reimer said that Money forced the twins to rehearse sexual acts involving "thrusting movements", with David playing the [[Top, bottom and versatile|bottom]] role. Reimer said that, as a child, he had to get "down on all fours" with his brother, Brian Reimer, "up [[Doggy style|behind his butt]]" with "his crotch against" his "buttocks". Reimer said that Money forced David, in another [[sex positions|sexual position]], to have his "[[Missionary position|legs spread]]" with Brian on top. Reimer said that Money also forced the children to take their "clothes off" and engage in "genital inspections". On at "least one occasion", Reimer said that Money took a photograph of the two children doing these activities. Money's rationale for these various treatments was his belief that "childhood 'sexual rehearsal play{{' "}} was important for a "healthy adult gender identity".{{sfn|Colapinto|2001b}}{{page needed|date=June 2016}}

For several years, Money reported on Reimer's progress as the "John/Joan case". Money wrote, "The child's behavior is so clearly that of an active little girl and so different from the boyish ways of her twin brother."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Money |first1=John |author1-link=John Money |last2=Ehrhardt |first2=Anke A. |author2-link=Anke Ehrhardt |year=1972 |title=Man &amp; Woman, Boy &amp; Girl |location=Baltimore, Maryland |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press}} Cited in {{harvnb|Halpern|2012|p=163}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Notes by a former student at Money's lab state that, during the follow-up visits, which occurred only once a year, Reimer's parents routinely lied to lab staff about the success of the procedure. The twin brother, Brian, later developed [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup/&gt;

[[Estrogen]] was given during adolescence, inducing [[breast development]].{{sfn|Balthazart|2012|p=25}}

==Adulthood==
By the age of 13 years, Reimer was experiencing suicidal depression and he told his parents he would take his own life if they made him see Money again.{{sfn|Colapinto|2000|pp=137–141}} Finally, on March 14, 1980, Reimer's parents told him the truth about his gender reassignment,{{sfn|Eskridge|Hunter|2003|p=127}} following advice from Reimer's [[endocrinologist]] and [[psychiatrist]]. At 14, having been informed of his past by his father, Reimer decided to assume a male gender identity, calling himself David. By 1987, Reimer had undergone treatment to reverse the reassignment, including testosterone injections, a double [[mastectomy]], and two [[phalloplasty]] operations.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} On September 22, 1990, he married Jane Fontane and would adopt her three children.{{sfnm |1a1=Beh |1a2=Diamond |1y=2005 |1p=12 |2a1=Goldie |2y=2014 |2p=187 |3a1=Rolls |3y=2015 |3p=144}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Boodman |first=Sandra G. |date=29 February 2000 |title=A Terrible Accident, a Dismal Failure |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/wellness/2000/02/29/a-terrible-accident-a-dismal-failure/83850bc4-b27a-417e-ba85-3693a4cafdd0 |work=The Washington Post |access-date=8 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His case came to international attention in 1997 when he told his story to [[Milton Diamond]], an academic [[sexology|sexologist]] who persuaded Reimer to allow him to report the outcome in order to dissuade physicians from treating other infants similarly.{{sfn|Diamond|Sigmundson|1997}} Soon after, Reimer went public with his story and [[John Colapinto]] published a widely disseminated and influential account&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last=Angier |first=Natalie |title=X + Y = Z |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/reviews/000220.20angiert.html |date=February 20, 2000 |publisher=New York Times |location= |accessdate=2018-09-25 |quote=Colapinto wrote a long story about the case for Rolling Stone, which won him a National Magazine Award.}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in December 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colapinto |first=John |author-link=John Colapinto |year=1997 |title=The True Story of John/Joan |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=775 |location=New York |publisher=Straight Arrow Publishers |pages=54–97 |issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article won the [[National Magazine Awards|National Magazine Award]] for Reporting.{{sfn|Bockting|2010|p=378}}

This was later expanded into the [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best-selling]] biography ''[[As Nature Made Him|As Nature Made Him: The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl]]'' (2000),{{sfn|Koch|2017|p=143}} in which Colapinto described how—contrary to Money's reports—when living as Brenda, Reimer did not [[gender identity|identify]] as a girl. He was ostracized and bullied by peers (who dubbed him "cavewoman"),&lt;ref name=BBCHealthCheck/&gt;{{sfn|Karkazis|2008|p=74}} and neither frilly dresses,{{sfnm |1a1=Colapinto |1y=2001 |1p=115 |2a1=Warnke |2y=2008 |2p=21}} nor female hormones made him feel female.

In addition to his difficult lifelong relationship with his parents, Reimer had to deal with unemployment and the death of his brother Brian from an overdose of [[antidepressant]]s on July 1, 2002. On May 2, 2004, his wife Jane told him she wanted to separate. On the morning of May 4, 2004, Reimer drove to a grocery store's parking lot in his hometown of Winnipeg&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;{{cite news |last=Woo |first=Elaine |date=13 May 2004 |title=David Reimer, 38; After Botched Surgery, He Was Raised as a Girl in Gender Experiment |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/13/local/me-reimer13 |work=Los Angeles Times |page=B12 |access-date=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took his own life by shooting himself in the head with a [[sawed-off shotgun]].{{sfnm |1a1=McQuail |1y=2018 |2a1=Rolls |2y=2015 |2p=145}} He was 38 years old.&lt;ref name=nyt-obit&gt;{{cite news |date=12 May 2004 |title=David Reimer, 38, Subject of the John/Joan Case |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/12/us/david-reimer-38-subject-of-the-john-joan-case.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=The Canadian Press |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was buried in St. Vital Cemetery in Winnipeg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=St. Vital Cemetery Burial Search |url=http://www.winnipeg.ca/ppd/cemeteries/cemetery_stvital_alpha.stm |publisher=City of Winnipeg |access-date=7 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
For the first thirty years after Money's initial report that the reassignment had been a success, Money's view of the malleability of gender became the dominant viewpoint among physicians and doctors, reassuring them that sexual reassignment was the correct decision in certain instances, resulting in thousands of sexual reassignments.&lt;ref name=Nova/&gt;

The report and subsequent book about Reimer influenced several medical practices, reputations, and even current understanding of the [[Sex differences in humans|biology of gender]]. The case accelerated the decline of sex reassignment and surgery for unambiguous [[XY sex-determination system|XY]] infants with [[micropenis]], various other rare congenital malformations, or penile loss in infancy.&lt;ref name=Nova&gt;{{cite episode |year=2001 |title=Sex: Unknown |series=Nova |series-link=Nova (TV series) |transcript=Transcript |transcript-url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/2813gender.html |network=PBS |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reimer has often been mentioned by [[intactivist]]s, who use him as an example of what could happen to a man if his parents decide to  [[circumcision|circumcise]] him at birth and the effect it can have on him throughout his life.

Colapinto's book described unpleasant childhood therapy sessions, implying that Money had ignored or concealed the developing evidence that Reimer's reassignment to female was not going well. Money's defenders have suggested that some of the allegations about the therapy sessions may have been the result of [[false memory syndrome]] and that the family was not honest with researchers.&lt;ref name=GUnews&gt;{{cite news |last1=Burkeman |first1=Oliver |author1-link=Oliver Burkeman |last2=Younge |first2=Gary |author2-link=Gary Younge |date=12 May 2004 |title=Being Brenda |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1214525,00.html |newspaper=The Guardian: G2 |location=London |page=2 |access-date=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case has also been treated by [[Judith Butler]] in her 2004 book ''[[Undoing Gender]]'',{{sfn|Butler|2004|pp=58–74}} which examines gender, sex, psychoanalysis, and the medical treatment of intersex people.

==Documentaries==
The BBC science series ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' based two episodes on his life. "The Boy Who Was Turned into a Girl" aired in 2000 and "Dr Money and the Boy with No Penis" in 2004.&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc-horizon-tv-followup /&gt;

He was also mentioned in the 2017 documentary ''[[Gender Revolution|Gender Revolution: A Journey with Katie Couric]]''.

An episode of BBC Radio 4 Mind Changers, 
[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00t97xf Case Study: John/Joan - The Boy Who Was Raised as a Girl], discusses the impact on two competing psychological theories of nature vs. nurture.

==In popular culture==
The ''[[Chicago Hope]]'' episode "[[Boys Will Be Girls (Chicago Hope episode)|Boys Will Be Girls]]" (2000) was based on Reimer's life. The episode explored the theme of a child's right not to undergo sexual reassignment surgery without consent.&lt;ref name=TV&gt;{{cite web |title=Treatment of Circumcision on TV |url=http://www.circumstitions.com/TVSitcomsA-M.html |website=The Intactivism Pages |access-date=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' episode "[[Identity (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit episode)|Identity]]" (2005) was based on David and Brian Reimer's lives and their treatment by Money.&lt;ref name=TV/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2257">In [[mathematics]], a '''double vector bundle''' is the combination of two compatible [[vector bundle]] structures, which contains in particular the double tangent &lt;math&gt;TE&lt;/math&gt; of a vector bundle &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and the [[double tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;T^2M&lt;/math&gt;.

==Definition and first consequences==
A '''double vector bundle''' consists of &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H, E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt;, where 
# the ''side bundles'' &lt;math&gt;E^H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^V&lt;/math&gt; are vector bundles over the base &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;,
# &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle on both side bundles &lt;math&gt;E^H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E^V&lt;/math&gt;,
# the projection, the addition, the scalar multiplication and the zero map on ''E'' for both vector bundle structures are morphisms.

==Double vector bundle morphism==

A '''double vector bundle morphism''' &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_H, f_V, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; consists of maps &lt;math&gt;f_E : E \mapsto E'&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f_H : E^H \mapsto E^H{}'&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;f_V : E^V \mapsto E^V{}'&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;f_B : B \mapsto B'&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_V)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E, E^V)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E', E^V{}')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(f_E, f_H)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E', E^H{}')&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(f_V, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E^V{}', B')&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(f_H, f_B)&lt;/math&gt; is a bundle morphism from &lt;math&gt;(E^H, B)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;(E^H{}', B')&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''flip'' of the double vector bundle &lt;math&gt;(E, E^H, E^V, B)&lt;/math&gt; is the double vector bundle &lt;math&gt;(E, E^V, E^H, B)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Examples==

If &lt;math&gt;(E, M)&lt;/math&gt; is a vector bundle over a differentiable manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;(TE, E, TM, M)&lt;/math&gt; is a double vector bundle when considering its [[secondary vector bundle structure]].

If &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a differentiable manifold, then its [[double tangent bundle]] &lt;math&gt;(TTM, TM, TM , M)&lt;/math&gt; is a double vector bundle.

'''Edward H. "Ed" Morrell''' (October 22, 1868 – November 10, 1946) was an accomplice to the [[Christopher Evans (outlaw)|Evans]] and Sontag gang that robbed the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] in California's [[San Joaquin Valley]] in the 1890s. According to his memoir, "The 25th Man", the robberies were after revenge for the large railroad corporation's mistreatment of local ranchers of the San Joaquin Valley.  Morrell was sentenced to life imprisonment in [[Folsom State Prison]] in 1894. He was eventually transferred to [[San Quentin State Prison|San Quentin]] (1899 at the latest), and pardoned in 1908. Five of his years were spent in [[solitary confinement]];&lt;ref&gt;"Five Years in the Solitary Dungeon", by [[Jack Jungmeyer]], ''The San Francisco Sunday Call'', February 14, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; he was known as the Dungeon Man of San Quentin. Author [[Jack London]] championed his pardon; and Morrell became a frequent guest at London's [[Jack London State Historic Park|Beauty Ranch]] in [[Glen Ellen, California]]. London used Morrell as a character in his 1915 novel ''[[The Star Rover]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Star Rover]]'' was adapted for the 2005 film [[The Jacket]], thus indirectly preserving Morrell on celluloid.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrell had been subjected to severe physical abuse in prison. After his release, he lectured widely on his experiences and advocated [[prison reform]].&lt;ref&gt;For example, "Ed Morrell's Act Is Too Realistic", ''The San Francisco Call'', June 24, 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; He lectured with former San Quentin prisoner and author, [[Donald Lowrie]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie, Donald. ''My Life Out of Prison'' (1915).&lt;/ref&gt; Morrell's lectures included addresses to the California and Pennsylvania legislatures. He advocated the abolition of [[corporal punishment]]. In 1914, he wrote a one-act play, ''The Incorrigible'', based on his experiences (and one of his nicknames). In 1924, he published his memoirs, ''The 25th Man: The Strange Story of Ed. Morrell, the Hero of Jack London's Star Rover''.

Morrell was born in [[Cass Township, Schuylkill County, Pennsylvania|Thomaston, Pennsylvania]] on October 22, 1868. He came to California in 1891. "In his later years, he was a colorful habitue of [[Gower Gulch]] and a frequenter of [[Hollywood and Vine]], the crony and pet of Hollywood film people." He died, age 78, in [[Los Angeles]] on November 10, 1946.&lt;ref&gt;"Last Railroad-Raiding Bandit, Ed Morrell, Dies," ''Los Angeles Times'', November 12, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl. ''The Encyclopedia of American Prisons'', Edward Morrell entry pp. 169-171, [[Infobase Publishing|Facts on File, Inc.]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

While a substantial proportion of effective altruists have focused on the [[nonprofit sector]], the philosophy of effective altruism applies more broadly to prioritizing the scientific projects, companies, and policy initiatives which can be estimated to save lives, help people, or otherwise have the biggest benefit.&lt;ref name="doing-good-better"&gt;{{cite book|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=Doing Good Better|date=2015|publisher=Avery|isbn=978-1592409105}}&lt;/ref&gt; People associated with the movement include philosopher [[Peter Singer]],&lt;ref name="blog.ted.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Walters|first1=Helen|title=The why and how of effective altruism: Peter Singer’s talk visualized|url=http://blog.ted.com/why-how-effective-altruism-peter-singer-visualized/|website=TED Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facebook cofounder [[Dustin Moskovitz]],&lt;ref name="Washington Post on Dustin Moskovitz and Cari Tuna"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/billionaire-couple-give-plenty-to-charity-but-they-do-quite-a-bit-of-homework/2014/12/26/19fae34c-86d6-11e4-b9b7-b8632ae73d25_story.html | title=Cari Tuna and Dustin Moskovitz: Young Silicon Valley billionaires pioneer new approach to philanthropy | date=December 26, 2014 | agency=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cari Tuna,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidephilanthropy.com/tech-philanthropy/2013/9/12/meet-cari-tuna-the-woman-giving-away-dustin-moskovitzs-faceb.html|title=Meet Cari Tuna, the Woman Giving Away Dustin Moskovitz's Facebook Fortune|first=Favid|last=Callahan|work=Inside Philanthropy|date=September 12, 2013|access-date=March 1, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford-based researchers [[William MacAskill]]&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Derek|title=The Greatest Good|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/#b06g25t20w15|work=The Atlantic|date=June 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Toby Ord]],&lt;ref name="Peter Singer The Most Good You Can Do"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NBWWX4ViD3E/|website=YouTube|title=Peter Singer: "The Most Good You Can Do" &amp;#124; Talks at Google}}&lt;/ref&gt; and professional poker player [[Liv Boeree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pokerstrategy.com/news/world-of-poker/Liv-Boeree-on-Effective-Altruism_100487/|title=News: Liv Boeree on Effective Altruism|website=www.pokerstrategy.com|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.livboeree.com/effective-altruism/|title=Effective Altruism {{!}} Liv Boeree|website=www.livboeree.com|language=en-GB|access-date=April 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
[[File:Peter Singer MIT Veritas.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Singer]] is a prominent advocate of effective altruism.]]
Effective altruism differs from other philanthropic practices because of its emphasis on quantitatively comparing charitable causes and interventions with the goal of maximizing certain human values. In this way it is similar to [[consequentialism]], which some leaders of the movement explicitly endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/2015/4/24/8457895/givewell-open-philanthropy-charity|title = You have $8 billion. You want to do as much good as possible. What do you do?|authorlink = Dylan Matthews|last = Matthews|first = Dylan|date = April 24, 2015|accessdate = August 4, 2015|publisher = ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The views of the philosopher [[Peter Singer]] in particular helped give rise to the effective altruist movement.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; Singer's book ''[[The Life You Can Save]]'' argued for the basic philosophy of effective giving, claiming that people have a moral imperative to donate more because of the existence of extreme poverty. In the book, Singer argued that people should use [[charity evaluators]] to determine how to make their donations most effective. Singer personally gives a third of his income to charity.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt;

===Impartiality===

Effective altruists reject the view that some lives are intrinsically more valuable than others. For example, they believe that a person in a developing country has equal value to a person in one's own community.&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jollimore|first1=Troy|title=Impartiality|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/impartiality/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=March 11, 2017|date=February 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1972 essay '[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]', Peter Singer wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It makes no difference whether the person I can help is a neighbor's child ten yards away from me or a Bengali whose name I shall never know, ten thousand miles away. ... The moral point of view requires us to look beyond the interests of our own society. Previously ..., this may hardly have been feasible, but it is quite feasible now. From the moral point of view, the prevention of the starvation of millions of people outside our society must be considered at least as pressing as the upholding of property norms within our society.&lt;ref name="singer1972"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |title=Famine, Affluence, and Morality |format=PDF |year=1972 |page=231 |accessdate=May 23, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106212947/http://www.fringer.org/wp-content/writings/famine.pdf |archivedate=November 6, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, many effective altruists think that future generations have equal moral value to currently existing people, and focus on reducing [[Risks to civilization, humans, and planet Earth|existential risks to humanity]]. Others believe that the interests of [[Personhood|non-human animals]] should be accorded the same moral weight as similar interests of humans and work to prevent the suffering of animals,&lt;ref name="skelton" /&gt; such as those raised in factory farms.&lt;ref name="huffpost-ea-global"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pitney|first1=Nico|title=Elon Musk To Address 'Nerd Altruists' At Google HQ|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-google-effective-altruism_us_55a56626e4b04740a3de3130|website=Huffington Post|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cause prioritization===
Although there is a growing emphasis on effectiveness and evidence among nonprofits, this is usually done with a single cause in mind, such as education or climate change. Effective altruists, however, seek to compare the relative importance of different causes and choose one objectively, a concept that is usually referred to as cause neutrality.&lt;ref name="gabriel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="oliver"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Oliver|first1=Huw|title='Effective Altruists' Are a New Type of Nice Person|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/why-are-young-people-being-so-altruistic-209|website=Vice|publisher=Vox|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/understanding-cause-neutrality/|title=Understanding cause-neutrality - Centre for Effective Altruism|website=Centre for Effective Altruism|language=en-US|access-date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective altruists choose the highest priority causes based on whether activities in each cause area could efficiently advance broad goals, such as increasing human or animal welfare, and then focus their attention on interventions in high priority areas. 

Several organizations perform cause prioritization research to answer the question of what causes warrant the highest priority.&lt;ref name="vox" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Causes|url=http://80000hours.org/causes|work=80,000 Hours|publisher=Centre for Effective Altruism|accessdate= June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GiveWell Labs Overview|url=http://www.givewell.org/about/labs|publisher=GiveWell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some common priorities among effective altruists include poverty in the [[developing country|developing world]], the suffering of animals in [[factory farming|factory farms]], and [[Global catastrophic risk|risks to civilization, humans and planet Earth]].&lt;ref name="doing-good-better" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gabriel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gabriel|first1=Iason|title=Effective Altruism and Its Critics|journal=Journal of Applied Philosophy|date=2016|volume=33|issue=3|doi=10.1111/japp.12176|url=https://www.academia.edu/13786913/Effective_Altruism_and_Its_Critics_Journal_of_Applied_Philosophy_2016_|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=practical-ethics/&gt;

===Cost-effectiveness===
Effective altruist organizations argue that some charities are far more effective than others, either because some do not achieve their goals or because of variability in the cost of achieving those goals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Funding-the-Right-Program | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your dollar goes further when you fund the right program }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas | publisher = GiveWell | title = Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas}}&lt;/ref&gt; When possible, they seek to identify charities that are highly [[cost-effectiveness analysis|cost-effective]], meaning that they achieve a large benefit for a given amount of money.&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt; For example, they select health interventions on the basis of their impact as measured by lives saved per dollar, [[quality-adjusted life year]]s (QALY) saved per dollar, or [[disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALY) averted per dollar. This measure of disease burden is expressed as the number of years lost due to ill-health, disability or early death.

Some effective altruism organizations use [[randomized controlled trial]]s as a primary form of evidence,&lt;ref name="The Atlantic article The Greatest Good" /&gt;&lt;ref name="skelton"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skelton|first1=Anthony|title=The Ethical Principles of Effective Altruism|journal=Journal of Global Ethics|date=2016|volume=12|issue=2|pages=137–146|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/SKETEP|accessdate= March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they are often considered to be at the highest level of strong evidence in healthcare research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/file/publications/synopses/cp30.pdf |title= A guide to the development, implementation and evaluation of clinical practice guidelines |author= National Health and Medical Research Council |date=November 16, 1998 |publisher= Commonwealth of Australia |location = Canberra | isbn = 1-86496-048-5 |page= 56|accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Counterfactual reasoning===

Effective altruists argue that [[Counterfactual conditional|counterfactual]] reasoning is important to determine which course of action maximizes positive impact. Many people assume that the best way to help people is through direct methods, such as working for a charity or providing social services,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Best jobs for saving the world | first1 = Donna | last1  = Rosato | first2 = Grace | last2 = Wong | date = November 2011 | url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/best-jobs/2011/jobs-helping-others/1.html | accessdate = February 28, 2013 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 10 "helping" professions and how to train for them | first = Aimee | last = Hosler | date =  June 14, 2011 | publisher = Schools.com | url = http://www.schools.com/articles/10-helping-professions-and-how-to-train-for-them.html | accessdate = 2013-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since charities and social-service providers usually can find people willing to work for them, effective altruists compare the amount of good somebody does in a conventional altruistic career to how much good would have been done had the next-best candidate been hired for the position. According to this reasoning, the impact of a career may be smaller than it appears.&lt;ref name="todd-career-paper"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Todd|first1=Benjamin|title=Which Ethical Careers Make a Difference?: The Replaceability Issue in the Ethics of Career Choice|url=https://www.academia.edu/1807196/Which_Ethical_Careers_Make_a_Difference_The_Replaceability_Issue_in_the_Ethics_of_Career_Choice?auto=download|website=University of Oxford|accessdate= March 11, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Room for more funding===

Effective altruist organizations make philanthropic recommendations for charities on the basis of their current funding need rather than merely evaluating the value of the work itself.&lt;ref name="givewell-interview-huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zhang|first1=Linch|title=How Can You do the Most Good with Your Charitable Giving?

There are many other organizations which ''do'' have room for more funding, so giving to one of those instead would produce real-world improvements.

==Behavior==

===Donation ===

Effective altruism encourages significant charitable donation. Some believe it is a moral duty to alleviate suffering through donations if the purchases that one forgoes to donate do not cause comparable suffering to oneself,&lt;ref name=singer1972 /&gt; leading some of them to lead a frugal lifestyle in order to give substantially more than is typical in their society.&lt;ref name="kaufman-wise"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burton|first1=Paul|title=Family Gives Away Half Their Income To Help Others|url=http://boston.cbslocal.com/2015/10/13/family-gives-away-half-their-income-to-help-others/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date=October 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocacy focuses on increasing the amount that people donate or identifying nonprofits that best meet the criteria of effective altruism.

[[Giving What We Can]] (GWWC) is an organization which hosts a community of individuals who have pledged to donate at least 10% of their income for the remainder of their working lives to the causes that they believe are the most effective. GWWC was founded in November 2009 by [[Toby Ord]], a moral philosopher at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], who lives on £18,000 ($27,000) per year and donates the remainder of his income to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843|title=Toby Ord: Why I'm giving £1m to charity|last=Geoghegan|first=Tom|date= December 13, 2010|accessdate= March 2, 2013|newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2018, more than 3,200 individuals have taken the pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/#our-members-have-done-some-amazing-things|title=Giving What We Can|website=www.givingwhatwecan.org|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ox-gwwc-pledges"&gt;{{cite news|title=1000 people match Oxford philosopher’s ‘10% of future income’ charity pledge|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2015-07-15-1000-people-match-oxford-philosopher%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%9810-future-income%E2%80%99-charity-pledge|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=University of Oxford|date= July 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Founders Pledge]] is a similar system run by the nonprofit Founders Forum for Good where startup founders make a legally binding commitment to donate at least 2% of their personal proceeds to charity in the event that they sell their business.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-80k-interview"&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacAskill|first1=William|title=One of the most exciting new effective altruist organisations: An interview with David Goldberg of the Founders Pledge|url=https://80000hours.org/2015/11/one-of-the-most-exciting-new-effective-altruist-organisations-an-interview-with-david-goldberg-of-the-founders-pledge/|website=80,000 Hours|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-forbes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Prosser|first1=David|title=Entrepreneurs Pledge Millions To Social Good|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidprosser/2015/06/10/entrepreneurs-pledge-millions-to-social-good/#3d2f84e66bb9|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Forbes|date=10 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/06/09/uk-tech-founders-take-the-founders-pledge-to-2-commiting-28m-to-good-causes/|title = UK Tech Founders Take The Founders Pledge To 2%, Committing $28m+ To Good Causes|last = Butcher|first = Mike|date = June 9, 2015|accessdate = December 5, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2016, one year after launch, 430 entrepreneurs had pledged, for an estimated total value of $134 million based on the founders' equity and the companies' valuation.&lt;ref name="founders-pledge-anniversary"&gt;{{cite news|title=Founders Pledge generates £90m in its first year|url=http://www.cityphilanthropy.org.uk/news/founders-pledge-generates-%C2%A390m-its-first-year|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=City Philanthropy|date= May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career selection===

Effective altruists argue that selection of one's career is an important determinant of the amount of good one does,&lt;ref name="oliver" /&gt; both directly (through the services one provides to the world) and indirectly (through the ways one directs the money earned based on the career).&lt;ref name="macaskill-replaceability-paper" /&gt;

[[80,000 Hours]] is an [[Oxford]], [[United Kingdom|UK]]-based organization in the effective altruism movement that writes articles and conducts one-on-one coaching to help people find careers with a positive social impact.&lt;ref name=yc-techcrunch&gt;{{cite web|url = https://techcrunch.com/2015/08/04/80000-hours/|title = Want To Make An Impact With Your Work? Try Some Advice From 80,000 Hours|date = August 4, 2015|accessdate = October 31, 2015|publisher = ''[[TechCrunch]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; It considers indirect methods of altruistic employment, such as earning a high salary in a conventional career and donating a portion of it, as well as direct practices, such as scientific research. It was co-founded by [[William MacAskill]],&lt;ref name="fastcoexist"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alcorn|first1=Stan|title=How To Choose An Ethical Career (With Help From Oxford Philosophers)|url=https://www.fastcoexist.com/1682193/how-to-choose-an-ethical-career-with-help-from-oxford-philosophers|website=Co.Exist|publisher=Fast Company Inc|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is also its current president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://80000hours.org/about/meet-the-team/|title=Meet the Team|accessdate=November 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[earning to give]] strategy has been proposed as a possible strategy for effective altruists. This strategy involves choosing to work in high-paying careers with the explicit goal of donating large sums of money to charity.&lt;ref name="join-ws-save-world"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=Join Wall Street.

[[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]], a columnist for ''[[The New York Times]]'', criticized effective altruists who adopt the strategy. He wrote that most people who work in finance and other high-paying industries value money for selfish reasons and that being surrounded by these people will cause effective altruists to become less altruistic.&lt;ref name="brooks2013"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=David | title=The Way to Produce a Person |newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 3, 2013| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/opinion/brooks-the-way-to-produce-a-person.html?_r=0|accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Week]]'', Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry argued that the practice was "unsettling".&lt;ref name="gobry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/articles/542955/effective-altruism-really-change-world|title = Can Effective Altruism really change the world?|last = Gobry|first = Pascal-Emmanuel|date = March 16, 2015|accessdate = March 21, 2015|publisher = ''[[The Week]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause priorities==

Effective altruism aspires to be cause-neutral, meaning it is in principle open to helping in whichever areas allow them to do the most good.&lt;ref name=practical-ethics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2013/05/what-is-effective-altruism/|title = What is Effective Altruism?|publisher = Practical Ethics blog|last = MacAskill|first = William|date = May 20, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kissel" /&gt; In practice, most people in the effective altruist movement have prioritized poverty, animal welfare, and risks of the long term future.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name=skelton/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/|title=Four focus areas of effective altruism - Effective Altruism Forum|website=effective-altruism.com|language=en|access-date=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/|title=A list of the most urgent global issues|work=80,000 Hours|access-date=May 31, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global poverty alleviation===

Global [[poverty alleviation]] has been a focus of some of the earliest and most prominent organizations associated with effective altruism.

Charity evaluator [[GiveWell]] was founded by [[Holden Karnofsky]] and Elie Hassenfeld in 2007 to address poverty and is currently a part of the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Konduri|first1=Vimal|title=GiveWell Co-Founder Explains Effective Altruism Frameworks|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/12/4/givewell-founder-effective-altruism/|website=The Harvard Crimson|publisher=The Harvard Crimson, Inc|accessdate= March 10, 2017|ref=crimson|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=givewell-opt-in&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/13/effective-altruism/|title = Effective Altruism|last = Karnofsky|first = Holden|date = August 13, 2013|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = [[GiveWell]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiveWell has argued that the value of donations is greatest for international poverty alleviation and developing world health issues,&lt;ref name="bloomberg-givewell"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wolfe|first1=Alexandra|title=Hedge Fund Analytics for Nonprofits|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-11-23/hedge-fund-analytics-for-nonprofits|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg LP|date= November 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dollar-overseas/&gt; and its leading recommendations have been in these domains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doing good by doing well|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21651815-lessons-business-charities-doing-good-doing-well|website=The Economist|publisher=Hearst Communications, Inc|accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=huffpo-elie&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/26/elie-hassenfeld-givewell_n_6927320.html|title = That Time A Hedge Funder Quit His Job And Then Raised $60 Million For Charity|last = Pitney|first = Nico|date = March 26, 2015|accessdate = April 27, 2015|publisher = ''[[Huffington Post]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Against Malaria Foundation]], [[Schistosomiasis Control Initiative]], [[Deworm the World Initiative]], and (earlier) [[VillageReach]] in global health, and [[GiveDirectly]] for direct unconditional cash transfers).

While much of the initial focus of effective altruism was on direct strategies such as health interventions and cash transfers, there has also been interest in more systematic social, economic, and political reform that would facilitate larger long-term poverty reduction.&lt;ref name="scott-weathers"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weathers|first1=Scott|title=Can ‘effective altruism’ change the world?

===Animal welfare===

Many effective altruists believe that reducing [[animal suffering]] should be a major priority and that, at the current margin, there are cost-effective ways of accomplishing this.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Matthews, [https://www.vox.com/2015/7/29/9067641/william-macaskill-effective-altruism "You have 80,000 hours in your career. Here's how to do the most good with them"], ''Vox'', August 3rd 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Singer quotes estimates by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the British organization Fishcount according to which 60 billion land animals are slaughtered and between 1 and 2.7 trillion individual fish are killed each year for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cif-green/2010/sep/14/fish-forgotten-victims|title=Fish: the forgotten victims on our plate|date=2010-09-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=June 14, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/user_upload/animalwelfare/GlobalWarningExecutiveSummary1.pdf|title=Global Warming Climate Change and Farm Animal Welfare|last=|first=|publisher=Compassion in World Farming|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.fishcount.org.uk/published/standard/fishcountfullrptSR.pdf|title=Worse things happen at sea: the welfare of wild-caught fish|last=Mood|first=Alison|publisher=fishcount.org.uk|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that effective animal welfare altruists should prioritize factory farming over more overfunded popular causes such as pet welfare.&lt;ref name="kristof" /&gt; Singer also argues that, if farm animals such as chickens are assigned even a modicum of consciousness, efforts to reduce factory farming (for example, by reducing global meat consumption) could be an even more underfunded and cost-effective way of reducing current global suffering than human poverty reduction.{{sfn|Singer|2015|pp=138, 146–147}} Philosophically, [[wild animal suffering]] may be an additional moral concern for effective altruists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Effective Altruism for Animals" Panel, Animal Studies|url=http://animalstudies.as.nyu.edu/object/as.events.20150729|website=New York University Animal Studies Initiative|publisher=NYU|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) is an organization connected with the movement that evaluates and compares various animal charities based on their cost-effectiveness and transparency, particularly those that are tackling [[factory farming]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Daniel Engber, [http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2016/08/animal_activists_crunched_the_numbers_to_learn_that_the_creature_most_in.html "Save the Chicken"], ''Slate'', August 18, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Singer|2015|p=139}} [[Faunalytics]] (formerly the Humane Research Council) is an organization loosely affiliated with the movement that conducts independent research on important animal welfare topics, provides resources for advocates and donors, and works with animal protection organizations to evaluate their work.

===Long term future and global catastrophic risks===

Focusing on the long-term future, some effective altruists believe that the total value of any meaningful metric (wealth, potential for suffering, potential for happiness, etc.) summed up over future generations, far exceeds the value for people living today.&lt;ref name=vox/&gt;&lt;ref name="eaf-far-future"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Importance of the Far Future|url=https://ea-foundation.org/blog/the-importance-of-the-far-future/|website=Effective Altruism Foundation|publisher=Effective Altruism Foundation|accessdate= March 11, 2017|date= August 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|date=2003|title=Astronomical Waste: The Opportunity Cost of Delayed Technological Development|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.pdf|journal=Utilitas|volume=15|pages=308–314|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the importance of addressing [[existential risk]]s such as dangers associated with [[biotechnology]] and [[Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|advanced artificial intelligence]] is often highlighted and the subject of active research. Because it is often infeasible to use empirical science (such as randomized control trials) to measure the probability of an existential risk, researchers such as [[Nick Bostrom]] have used other methods such as expert opinion elicitation to estimate their importance.&lt;ref name="xrisk methods"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowe |first1=Thomas |last2=Beard |first2=Simon |title=Probabilities, methodologies and the evidence base in existential risk assessments |journal=Working paper,  Centre for the Study of Existential Risk |date=2018 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89506/1/Beard_Existential-Risk-Assessments_Accepted.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organizations that work actively on research and advocacy for improving the long term future, and have connections with the effective altruist movement, are the [[Future of Humanity Institute]], [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]], and [[Future of Life Institute]].&lt;ref name="guan-op-ed"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guan|first1=Melody|title=The New Social Movement of our Generation: Effective Altruism|url=http://harvardpolitics.com/harvard/new-social-movement-generation-effective-altruism/|accessdate=11 March 2017|work=Harvard Political Review|date=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[Machine Intelligence Research Institute]] is focused on the more narrow mission of aligning advanced artificial intelligence.&lt;ref name="washpost-ai"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Basulto|first1=Dominic|title=The very best ideas for preventing artificial intelligence from wrecking the planet|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2015/07/07/the-very-best-ideas-for-preventing-artificial-intelligence-from-wrecking-the-planet/|accessdate= March 11, 2017|work=Washington Post|date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="matthews-ea-global"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Matthews|first1=Dylan|title=I spent a weekend at Google talking with nerds about charity.

==History as a social movement==

The ideas behind effective altruism, such as [[consequentialism]], have been present in practical ethics for a long time and have been reflected in the writings of philosophers such as Jeremy Bentham,&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ram|first1=Aliya|title=The power and efficacy of effective altruism|url=https://www.ft.com/content/1954323c-8eb3-11e5-8be4-3506bf20cc2b|accessdate= February 14, 2018|work=Financial Times|date= December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Stuart Mill]],&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt; Peter Singer,&lt;ref name="sep-impartiality" /&gt; and [[Peter Unger]]. A basic argument for altruism was defined in Singer's 1972 paper "[[Famine, Affluence, and Morality]]", in which he argued that people have an obligation to help those in need:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, then we ought, morally, to do it.&lt;ref name="singer1972" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, the movement identifying with the name 'effective altruism' itself only came into being in the late 2000s&lt;ref name="tmgycd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog/ID/170/The-Most-Good-You-Can-Do|title = The Most Good You Can Do|last = Singer|first = Peter|authorlink = Peter Singer|date = April 1, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''The Life You Can Save''}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a community formed around the groups Giving What We Can and Givewell.

The book describes the philosophy and social movement of effective altruism and argues in favor of it.&lt;ref name="kristof"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/opinion/sunday/nicholas-kristof-the-trader-who-donates-half-his-pay.html|title = The Trader Who Donates Half His Pay|last = Kristof|first = Nicholas|authorlink = Nicholas Kristof|date = April 4, 2015|accessdate = April 11, 2015|publisher = ''[[New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year [[William MacAskill]] published his book ''[[Doing Good Better|Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make a Difference]]'' which helped to further popularize the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/20/doing-good-better-william-macaskill-review|title=Doing Good Better by William MacAskill review – if you read this book, you'll change the charities you donate to|last=Shariatmadari|first=David|date=August 20, 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=May 21, 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/upshot/effective-altruism-where-charity-and-rationality-meet.html|title=Effective Altruism: Where Charity and Rationality Meet|last=Cowen|first=Tyler|date=August 14, 2015|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 21, 2017|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/what-is-the-greatest-good/395768/|title=The Greatest Good|last=Thompson|first=Derek|date=June 15, 2015|work=The Atlantic|access-date=May 21, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacAskill also created [[Giving What We Can]] and [[80,000 Hours]], both of which are part of the Centre for Effective Altruism.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

==Criticism==
[[David Brooks (cultural commentator)|David Brooks]] has questioned whether children in distant countries should be treated as having equal moral value to nearby children. He claims that morality should be "internally ennobling".&lt;ref name="brooks2013" /&gt; In the ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]'', Ken Berger and Robert Penna of [[Charity Navigator]] condemned effective altruism's practice of "weighing causes and beneficiaries against one another", calling this "moralistic, in the worst sense of the word".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism|title = The Elitist Philanthropy of So-Called Effective Altruism|last = Berger|first = Ken|last2 = Penna|first2 = Robert|date = November 25, 2013|accessdate = November 26, 2013|publisher = ''[[Stanford Social Innovation Review]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pascal-Emmanuel Gobry warns about the "measurement problem", stating that some areas, such as medical research, or helping to reform third-world governance "one grinding step at a time", are hard to measure with controlled cost-effectiveness experiments and therefore risk being undervalued by the effective altruism movement.&lt;ref name="gobry" /&gt; Jennifer Rubenstein also hypothesizes that effective altruism can be biased against causes that are not straightforward to measure.&lt;ref name="Lessons of EA" /&gt;

In ''[[Jacobin (magazine)|Jacobin]]'' magazine, Mathew Snow argued that effective altruism "implores individuals to use their money to procure necessities for those who desperately need them, but says nothing about the system that determines how those necessities are produced and distributed in the first place".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/peter-singer-charity-effective-altruism/|title = Against Charity|last = Snow|first = Mathew|date = August 25, 2015|accessdate = September 5, 2016|publisher = ''Jacobin''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various critics have similarly objected to effective altruism on the basis of the fact that its proponents tend not to support political causes such as [[anti-capitalism]] that change "the existing global institutional order".&lt;ref name="Berkey" /&gt; Joshua Kissel has replied that anti-capitalism is compatible with effective altruism in theory, while adding that effective altruists and anti-capitalists have reason to be more sympathetic to each other.&lt;ref name=kissel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=eip/|title = Effective Altruism and Anti-Capitalism:  An Attempt at Reconciliation|last = Kissel|first = Joshua|date = January 31, 2017|accessdate = February 19, 2017|publisher = '' Essays in Philosophy ''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Berkey has also argued that support for changing institutions such as capitalism does not contradict the principles of effective altruism, because effective altruism is open to any action that will have the greatest positive impact on the world, including the possibility of changing the existing global institutional order.&lt;ref name=Berkey&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Berkey |first1=Brian |title=The Institutional Critique of Effective Altruism |journal=Utilitas |date=2018 |volume=30 |issue=2 |url=https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/The-Institutional-Critique-of-Effective-Altruism.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Ashton argues that we are separately obligated to donate to effective aid charities and to reform the structures that are responsible for poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashford |first1=Elizabeth |title=Severe Poverty as an Unjust Emergency |journal=The Ethics of Giving: Philosophers' Perspectives on Philanthropy |date=2018 |pages=103-148 |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190648879.001.0001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4230">In [[metaphysics]], '''extension''' signifies both 'stretching out' (Latin: ''extensio'') as well as later 'taking up space', and most recently, spreading one's internal mental cognition into the external world.

The history of thinking about ''extension'' can be traced back at least to Archytas' spear analogy for the infinity of space. How far can one's hand or spear stretch out until it reaches the edge of reality? “If I arrived at the outermost edge of the heaven, could I extend my hand or staff into what is outside or not? It would be paradoxical [given our normal assumptions about the nature of space] not to be able to extend it.”

[[René Descartes]] defined extension as the property of existing in more than one dimension, a property that was later followed up in Grassmann's n-dimensional algebra. For Descartes, the primary characteristic of [[matter]] is extension (''res extensa''), just as the primary characteristic of [[mind]] is [[thought]] (''res cogitans'').

This can be contrasted with {{According to whom|current conceptions in quantum physics|date=January 2014}}, where the [[Planck length]], an almost unimaginably tiny quantity, represents reaching that distance scale where, it has been theorized, all measurement seemingly breaks down to that which can be subsumed at this scale, as distance only, or extension.

[[John Locke]], in ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'', defined extension as "only the Space that lies between the Extremities of those solid coherent Parts" of a body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Volume 1 |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |year=1816 |publisher=B. Smith|page= 131|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9sUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22only+the+space+that+lies+between+the+extremities+of+the+solid+coherent+parts%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the space possessed by a body. Locke refers to the extension in conjunction with ''[[solidity]]'' and ''[[impenetrability]],'' the other primary characteristics of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Volume 1 |last=Locke |first=John |authorlink=John Locke |year=1816 |publisher=B. Smith|pages= 131–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r9sUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=%22only+the+space+that+lies+between+the+extremities+of+the+solid+coherent+parts%22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Extension also plays an important part in the philosophy of [[Baruch Spinoza]], who says that substance (that which has extension) can be limited only by substance of the same sort, i.e. matter cannot be limited by ideas and vice versa. From this principle, he determines that substance is infinite. This infinite substance is what Spinoza calls [[God]], or better yet [[nature]], and it possesses both unlimited extension and unlimited consciousness.

==Infinite divisibility==
''Infinite divisibility'' refers to the idea that extension, or quantity, when divided and further divided infinitely, cannot reach the point of zero quantity. It can be divided into very small or negligible quantity but not zero or no quantity at all.  Using a mathematical approach, specifically geometric models, [[Gottfried Leibniz]] and Descartes discussed the infinite divisibility of extension. Actual divisibility may be limited due to unavailability of cutting instruments, but its possibility of breaking into smaller pieces is infinite.

==Compenetration==
''Compenetration'' refers to two or more extensions occupying the same space at the same time. This, according to [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] philosophers, is impossible; according to this view, only spirits or spiritualized matter can occupy a place occupied already by an entity (matter or spirit)

==Extended Mind Thesis==
In more recent work, philosophers David Chalmers and Andy Clark in 1998 published "[[The Extended Mind]]." This has opened a wide channel of new research at the nexus of epistemology, philosophy of mind, cognitive and neuro-science, dynamic systems thinking, science, technology &amp; innovation studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4699">{{Other uses|Falling (disambiguation){{!}}Falling}}A [[sense|sensation]] of '''falling''' occurs when the [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|labyrinth]] or ''vestibular apparatus'', a system of fluid-filled passages in the [[ear|inner ear]], detects changes in acceleration. This sensation can occur when a person begins to fall, which in terms of [[mechanics]] amounts to a sudden acceleration increase from zero to [[Gravitational acceleration|roughly 9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;]]. If the body is in [[free fall]] (for example, during [[skydiving]]) with no other momenta (rotation, etc.) there is no falling sensation. This almost never occurs in real-life falling situations because when the faller leaves their support there are usually very significant quantities of residual momenta such as rotation and these momenta continue as the person falls, causing a sensation of dysphoria. The faller doesn't fall straight down but spins, flips, etc. due to these residual momenta and also due to the asymmetric forces of air resistance on his asymmetric body. While velocity continues to increase, the downward acceleration due to [[gravity]] remains constant. Increasing [[Drag (physics)|drag force]] may even cause a feeling of ascent.

The vestibular apparatus also detects spatial orientation with respect to visual input.  A similar sensation of falling can be induced when the eyes detect rapid apparent motion with respect to the environment.  This system enables people to keep their balance by signalling when a physical correction is necessary. Some medical conditions, known as [[balance disorder]]s, also induce the sensation of falling. In the [[hypnagogia|early stages of sleep]], a falling sensation may be perceived in connection with a [[hypnic jerk]], sometimes awaking the sleeper abruptly.

== Labyrinth ==
The [[vestibular system]] works with other sensorimotor systems in the body, such as the visual system (eyes) and skeletal system (bones and joints), to check and maintain the position of our body at rest or in motion. The vestibular apparatus functions by detecting forces that act upon bodies including gravity. There are two sections in the labyrinth that are helpful for accomplishing those tasks: the semicircular canals and the otolithic organs.

==Balance disorder==

A [[balance disorder]] is a condition that makes a person feel nausea, disorientation or dizziness, as if moving, spinning or falling even though steady.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Balance Disorders|url = http://www.nidcd.nih.gov/health/balance/pages/balance_disorders.aspx|website = www.nidcd.nih.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-01|date = April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balance disorder can be caused by medication, problems of inner ear or the brain.

==Hypnic jerk==
[[Hypnic jerk]], also called a boggie jerk, is a normal reaction that can be caused by anxiety, caffeine, a dream, or discomfort of sleeping. A hypnic jerk is the feeling triggered by a sudden muscle twitch, causing the feeling of falling while sleeping or dreaming. People normally experience hypnic jerks moments before the first stage of sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What are Hypnagogic Jerks? Twitches Before Sleep.|url = http://mentalhealthdaily.com/2015/05/19/what-are-hypnagogic-jerks-twitches-before-sleep/|website = mentalhealthdaily.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 70% of people have experienced hypnic jerk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Do People 'Twitch' When Falling Asleep?|url = http://www.livescience.com/39225-why-people-twitch-falling-asleep.html|accessdate = 2015-10-01|last = Castro|date = August 27, 2013|first = Joesph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hypnic jerks are most common in children, when dreams are considered the most simple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why your body jerks before you fall asleep|url = http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120522-suffer-from-sleep-shudders|website = www.bbc.com|accessdate = 2015-10-01|first = Tom|last = Stafford|date = May 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no completely accurate explanation of this phenomenon, but most experts{{who|date=January 2013}} agree that as muscles begin to slacken right after one falls asleep, the brain senses these relaxation signals and misinterpret as one is falling down. Then the brain will send signals to muscles to keep the balance.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Studies{{which|date=January 2013}} showed that there is a correlation between the frequency of hypnic jerks and anxiety. Fatigue, discomfort of the bed, highly intense exercise and stress might cause people to jerk during sleeping.{{Citation needed|date = October 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2869">[[Image:Futures wheel 01.svg|thumb|right|250px|A futures wheel as described by Jerome C. Glenn.]]
'''The Future wheel''' is a method for graphical [[visualization (graphic)|visualisation]] of direct and indirect [[future]] '''consequences''' of a particular change or development. It was invented by [[Jerome C. Glenn]] in 1971, when he was a [[student]] at the Antioch Graduate School of Education (now [[Antioch University New England]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Futures Wheel is a way of organizing thinking and questioning about the future – a kind of structured brainstorming. (Jerome C. Glenn (1994) The Futures Wheel)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Description==

To start a Futures wheel the central [[terminology|term]] describing the change to evaluate is positioned in the center of the page (or drawing area). Then, events or consequences following directly from that development are positioned around it. Next, the (indirect) consequences of the direct consequences are positioned around the first level consequences. The terms may be connected as nodes in a tree (or even a web). The levels will often be marked by concentric circles.

==Usage==

The Futures wheel is usually used to organize [[thought]]s about a future development or trend. With it, possible impacts can be collected and put down in a structured way. The use of interconnecting lines makes it possible to visualize interrelationships of the causes and resulting changes. Thus, Futures wheels can assist in developing multi-concepts about possible future development by offering a futures-conscious perspective and aiding in group [[brainstorming]].

'''Gabriel Wagner''' (c. 1660 – c. 1717)  was a radical German philosopher and [[Materialism|materialist]] who wrote under the [[Pen name|nom-de-plume]] '''Realis de Vienna.''' A follower of [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and acquaintance of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], Wagner did not believe that the universe or bible were divine creations, and sought to extricate philosophy and science from the influence of [[theology]]. Wagner also held radical political views critical of the [[nobility]] and [[monarchy]]. After failing to establish lasting careers in cities throughout German-speaking Europe, Wagner died in or shortly after 1717.

==Life==

[[Image:Christian Thomasius.jpg|thumb|220px|right|[[Christian Thomasius]], an early mentor and later opponent of Wagner.]]
Wagner studied under scholar [[Christian Thomasius]] in [[Leipzig]], and in 1691 published a philosophical tract critical of Thomasius, "Discourse and doubts in Christ: a Thomasian introduction to courtly philosophy."&lt;ref name=dascal&gt;Dascal, 2008, pp.490-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=israel06&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.173-5.&lt;/ref&gt; The tract satirically dubbed Thomasius the "German [[Socrates]]" and attracted attention within philosophical circles, including from Leibniz, who sought to contact Wagner.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt; In the same year, after a dispute over rent, Wagner was expelled from university and imprisoned. Following his release, Wagner traveled in 1693 to [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]], where as a result of his increasingly [[libertine]] views he wholly broke with Thomasius, who by contrast was becoming more conservative.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt;&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; Moving to [[Berlin]] later in 1693 and then to [[Vienna]], Wagner was in 1696 given a temporary position in [[Hamburg]],&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; which he lost due to his novel and sometimes polemical philosophical positions.&lt;ref name=dascal /&gt;

Receiving support from Leibniz, Wagner worked for a time at the [[Herzog August Library]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]];&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; and maintained his contact with Leibniz.&lt;ref name=poser290&gt;Poser, 2004, pp.290-291&lt;/ref&gt;  Leibniz wrote to Wagner in 1696, describing his admiration for [[Aristotle]] and opposing contemporary attacks on him, despite his view that Aristotle had discovered only a small portion of the discipline.&lt;ref name=cass&gt;Cassirer, 1943, pp.383-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposing his former mentor Thomasius' belief in the [[soul]], Wagner published another text in 1707, "Critique of Thomasian views on the nature of the soul." Theologian [[Johann Joachim Lange]] accused Wagner of Spinozist sympathies in 1710, and Wagner replied to these criticisms in the same year.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

The last record of Wagner is found in [[Göttingen]] in 1717, where he came into conflict with historian of philosophy Christoph August Heumann. Wagner presumably died shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

Wagner believed that both education and philosophy should be modernized and focus on mathematics, physics and medicine, but not theology.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; In this regard he held that Germany had made more progress, while French, Italian and Spanish thinkers were overly influenced by followers of [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]] and [[Ptolemy]].&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; Believing in intellectual freedom, Wagner was an admirer of German philosopher and professor [[Nicolaus Hieronymus Gundling]], who favored "atheistic" classical Greek philosophy.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;

As articulated in his 1707 critique of Thomasius, Wagner did not believe in a soul, in divine providence, in the divinity of the bible, or in divine creation. He instead advocated reason, the most "godly" aspect of humankind, as a means of eradicating superstition. Wagner therefore celebrated advances in science facilitated by [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and even considered himself a Cartesian, though he disagreed with the latter's Christian [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs and even sought to undermine them.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt;&lt;ref name=israel07&gt;Israel, 2007, p.15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erdmann1890&gt;Erdmann, 1890, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; Deeply influenced by Spinoza, Wagner placed even greater emphasis on the importance of experimentation and empiricism in developing knowledge.

Wagner held radical political beliefs, advocating a restructuring of society according to more egalitarian principles and advocating greater emphasis on administration, education and culture.&lt;ref name=israel335&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.335-7&lt;/ref&gt; Reform of educational institutions was a particular concern of his writing.&lt;ref name=israel07b&gt;Israel, 2007, pp.6-7&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner contested that aristocracy by birth was inferior to intellectual achievement. He also believed that Germany's fragmentary political system resulted in a weak and mismanaged government.&lt;ref name=israel06 /&gt; In these beliefs Wagner was influenced by but disagreed with political thinkers such as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[Niccolò Machiavelli]]. Much of Wagner's political and philosophical system was oriented, ultimately, towards securing religious, intellectual, and personal freedom, a project of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] as a whole.&lt;ref name=israel335 /&gt;

==Legacy==

[[File:Baruch de Spinoza cover portrait.jpg|thumb|220px|right|An early engraving of the philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], a major influence on Wagner's world view.]]
Wagner is known for his longstanding correspondence with Leibniz, and his erudition and innovative understanding of philosophy and natural sciences during his time, according to historian Cornelio Fabro.&lt;ref name=fabro&gt;Fabro, 1968, p.598&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Jonathan Israel]] writes that Wagner is an important materialist philosopher of the late 17th and early 18th centuries, and an example of both radical philosophy and atheism produced by the growing university system of the period.&lt;ref name=israel43&gt;Israel, 2006, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=israel167&gt;Israel, 2006, pp.167-8&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Frederick Beiser writes that Wagner and his fellow materialists in Germany, though they were less numerous than those found in France and England, developed mechanistic explanations for human behavior and raised fears of spreading religious skepticism.&lt;ref name=beiser&gt;Beiser, 2000, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4303">As introduced by [[Kurt Lewin]], '''genidentity''' is an ''existential relationship'' underlying the genesis of an object from one moment to the next. What we usually consider to be an object really consists of multiple entities, which are the phases of the object at various [[time]]s. Two objects are not identical because they have the same properties in common, but because one has developed from the other. 
Lewin introduced the concept in his 1922 [[Habilitationsschrift]] ''Der Begriff der Genese in Physik, Biologie und Entwicklungsgeschichte''. It is today perhaps the only surviving evidence of Lewin's influence on the philosophy of science. However, this concept never became an object of widespread discussion and debate in its own terms. Rather, it was extracted from its context by philosophers such as [[Rudolf Carnap]], Hans Hermes, [[Hans Reichenbach]], [[Adolph Grünbaum]], and [[Bas van Fraassen]] who incorporated this concept into their own theories such as the [[topology of the universe]] or the axiomatization of [[mechanics]]. Lewin's idea was to compare and contrast the concept of genidentity in various branches of science, thereby laying bare the characteristic structure of each and making their classification possible in the first place. 

== Classification of Natural Sciences ==

In his thesis mentioned above, Lewin compares [[physics]] (in which he includes [[chemistry]]) and [[biology]] (which he divides into organic biology and [[evolutionary history of life]]). A comparison of this kind presupposes that it is possible to find equivalent notions in both sciences. According to Lewin, the concept of ''genidentity'' in the various sciences meets this requirement.

Lewin distinguishes between partial and total genidentity. This is due to the difficulty caused by parts of objects: for instance, an object might disintegrate into several pieces in the course of its development. As we follow such an object through time, only a small portion of it may remain. Lewin says that two objects existing at different times are partly genidentical if at least some part of the later object was present in the earlier object. By contrast, he says that two objects are totally genidentical if and only if at neither of the considered times there is any distinct object partially genidentical to one of the two objects concerned. 

Lewin also introduces the idea of viewing physical bodies as links in a so-called ''development chain''. According to this approach, between two totally genidentical objects there always exists, at any intermediate time, an object totally genidentical with each. Thus genidentity implies the existence of an entire infinite series of intermediate objects. In this Lewin sees an analogy between physical objects and [[real number]]s, as defined by so-called [[Dedekind cut]]s in the ordering of [[rational number]]s. 

Genidentity so defined is postulated to have various characteristics, such as symmetry, transitivity, density, and continuity. When reviewed in the light of contemporary standards of logical precision, it becomes clear that Lewin had the correct intuition, even though he did not have the benefit of a highly developed terminology of definition theory or modern day [[symbolic logic]]. 

However, genidentity has never been explicitly discussed in the experimental sciences. Rather, it has always been a basic assumption hovering in the background, tacitly assumed. The credit for having made these assumptions explicit for the first time doubtlessly belongs to Kurt Lewin, usually renowned for his psychological work in the field of [[Gestalt psychology]].

{{BLP sources|date=May 2010}}
'''George Hamilton Smith''' (born February 10, 1949, [[Japan]]) is an American author, editor, educator and speaker, known for his writings on [[atheism]] and [[libertarianism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom G. Palmer]] (ed.), ''Why Liberty'', Jameson Books, 2013, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Smith grew up mostly in [[Tucson, Arizona]], and attended the [[University of Arizona]] for several years before leaving without a degree; he relocated to [[Los Angeles]] during 1971. With the help of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] editor [[Roy A. Childs, Jr.]], he secured a contract from Nash Publishing (then located in Los Angeles) to produce a book on [[atheism]]. The finished product was his first book, ''[[Atheism: The Case Against God]]'' (1974).

Smith has been teaching since the 1970s, first under the auspices of his own Forum for Philosophical Studies (with offices on [[Sunset Boulevard]] in Los Angeles), later under the auspices of the [[Cato Institute]] and the [[Institute for Humane Studies]] (IHS). For nearly twenty years, from the mid-1970s to the mid-1990s, he spent his summers teaching political philosophy and American political and intellectual history to university students at seminars sponsored by Cato Institute and IHS.

During the 1980s, Smith worked for more than six years as the general editor of Knowledge Products, a Nashville-based company that produced educational audio recordings in philosophy, history, economics, and current affairs. During those years, in addition to his duties as editor, Smith was also the primary scriptwriter for Knowledge Products' ''Great Political Thinkers'' series. These recordings have been used widely in college classrooms.

Since 1971, more than one hundred of Smith's articles and book reviews have appeared in a wide range of publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', ''[[Reason Magazine]]'', ''[[Free Inquiry]]'', ''[[The Humanist]]'', ''[[Inquiry Magazine|Inquiry]]'', ''Cato Policy Report'', ''[[Liberty (libertarian magazine)|Liberty]]'', ''[[Voluntaryism#The Voluntaryist|The Voluntaryist]]'', Academic Associates ''Book News'', ''[[Journal of Libertarian Studies]]'', and ''Humane Studies Review''. He writes a weekly column on libertarian and classical liberal thought for [[Libertarianism.org]], a website operated by Cato.

His published works often deal with such issues as [[capital punishment]] (which he opposes), [[anarchism]], [[libertarianism]], [[religious toleration]], and [[atheism]]. He has written about [[William Wollaston]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]], [[Ayn Rand]] and other figures. On December 31, 2007, George Smith provided a humorous "qualified endorsement" of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidate [[Ron Paul]] via [[YouTube]] for libertarian voters, but also one that was consistent with his published writings on electoral politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|h81tGuWCdmY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Cambridge University Press published his book ''The System of Liberty: Themes in the History of Classical Liberalism.''

==Overview==
American Jewelry and Loan is owned by [[Les Gold]], a third generation pawnbroker and businessman, and the grandson of a pawnbroker who once owned Sam's Loans, a now-defunct pawnshop on [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|Michigan Avenue]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Gold at Gunpoint |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= [[truTV]] |date= September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Les first opened American Jewelry at the Green Eight Shopping Center on 8 Mile Road in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]] in 1978, moving to its present location in 1993.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;

Seth handles the store's [[marketing|marketing division]] and claims that if it was not for him, the shop's only marketing campaign would be "an ad in the [[Yellow Pages]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= Pilot #1 |series= Hardcore Pawn |network= truTV |date= December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Les's daughter, Ashley, has a bachelor's degree in business administration from [[Michigan State University]] and earned her graduate diamond certification from the Gemological Institute of America.

==Reception==

===Comparison to ''Pawn Stars''===
The show has been largely compared to similar reality program ''[[Pawn Stars]]'' on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], but in the vein of similar programs also on truTV (''[[Operation Repo]]'' and ''[[Lizard Lick Towing]]'' for example), where it differs however is the focus being mainly on the human aspects of drama and interaction, rather than the actual significance of the items being brought into the shop.&lt;ref name="Marechal2013"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to similarities to ''Pawn Stars'', ''Hardcore Pawn'' has been described as simply being a knock-off and a capitalization on the breakout success of ''Pawn Stars''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Hibberd |first= James |url= http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/trutv-hardcore-pawn-ratings.html |title= TruTV's 'Pawn Stars' knock-off scores big ratings |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date= August 17, 2010 |accessdate= August 24, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100819175924/http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/trutv-hardcore-pawn-ratings.html |archivedate= August 19, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Les Gold defends the show with claims that his show is a true representation of what a pawn shop does, focusing on the human element and showing that people are suffering tough times and need money for basic necessities like food and rent.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Stacey |last= Harrison|date= July 3, 2012 |url= http://www.channelguidemagblog.com/index.php/2012/07/03/7-questions-with-les-gold-of-trutvs-hardcore-pawn/ |title= 7 Questions With Les Gold of 'Hardcore Pawn |work= Channel Guide Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Marc Juris of truTV, any similarities between the shows are coincidental. He also noted that ''Hardcore Pawn'' was in development for more than a year and two test episodes aired in December 2009. Regarding the initial identical time slot of Monday nights at 10 pm ET, opposite ''Pawn Stars'' at the time, Juris claimed the choice was made because ''Hardcore Pawn'' fit well with ''Operation Repo''. The second season debuted in December 2010, in the Tuesday at 9&amp;nbsp;pm ET timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/hardcore-pawn/EP01219217 |title= Hardcore Pawn |work=[[Zap2it]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reality versus scripting===
The first season put an emphasis on the sad stories of people pawning their possessions and on the Golds' need to arm and otherwise protect themselves in dangerous Detroit. But this was too dark for television, and from the second season all mention of danger was dropped and pawn stories downplayed in favor of people selling unusual things and Les bargaining them down in price. Owner Les Gold said at the launch of the show that there would be no staged antics, products or characters on the show.&lt;ref name=dfp/&gt; However, ''[[New York Post]]'' writer Linda Stasi has opined that some situations in ''Hardcore Pawn'' are set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Stasi |first= Linda |url= http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/pawn_spawn_up1AXC7U94xbIrNToKzA9J |title= 'Pawn' spawn: New shop on the block feels the same |work= [[New York Post]] |date= August 16, 2010 |accessdate= August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, every episode features moments when Les, who is not normally behind a counter, happens to be there when someone brings in something unusual to sell. The shows are also obviously edited to follow a regular format, with every episode featuring two unruly customers being thrown out, one trip to the parking lot for a car or truck for sale, and usually some argument between Ashley and Seth.

==Series cancellation==
During season 9 truTV decided not to order more episodes because of the network's new direction. truTV was concentrating on comedy programming and it was decided that ''Hardcore Pawn'' did not relate properly to other programs in the network's schedule. No other television networks showed interest in the series, and production was halted in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in/item/39702-tv-q-a-once-upon-a-time-hardcore-pawn-and-the-returned |title= TV Q&amp;A |publisher= Community Voices}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spinoffs==
''Hardcore Pawn'' has generated two spinoffs:

* ''Combat Pawn'', a series about the employees and customers at Guns Plus, a gun shop located near the [[Fort Bragg]] military installation in [[North Carolina]]. Originally developed under the title "''Hardcore Pawn: Fort Bragg''{{-"}}, ''Combat Pawn'' debuted on truTV on Sunday July 15, 2012 at 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. ET/PT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=TV News Desk |url=http://tv.broadwayworld.com/article/truTV-to-Premiere-COMBAT-PAWN-715-20120709 |publisher=BWWTVWorld |title=truTV to Premiere 'Combat Pawn', 7/15 |date=July 9, 2012 |accessdate=June 21, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Rich Pyle, one of the American Jewelry clerks who was featured in many episodes of ''Hardcore Pawn'', has since left the show and became host of another television series for the [[National Geographic Channel]], ''Meltdown'', a series focusing on the recycling of precious metals. That series debuted on National Geographic on October 31, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/meltdown/series/meltdown/ |date=August 5, 2013 |title=Meltdown |publisher=[[National Geographic Channel]] |accessdate=June 21, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701153011/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/meltdown/series/meltdown/ |archivedate=July 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Irreligion sidebar|atheism}}
[[Atheism]] (derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] [[:wikt:ἄθεος|ἄθεος]] ''atheos'' meaning "without gods; godless; secular; denying or disdaining the gods, especially officially sanctioned gods"&lt;ref&gt;Modern translations of classical texts sometimes translate ''atheos'' as "atheistic". As an abstract noun, there was also ''atheotēs'' ("atheism").&lt;/ref&gt;) is the absence or rejection of the belief that [[Deity|deities]] exist. The English term was used at least as early as the sixteenth century and atheistic ideas and their influence have a longer history. Over the centuries, atheists have supported their lack of belief in gods through a variety of avenues, including scientific, philosophical, and ideological notions.

In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and various [[atheism in Hinduism|sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China. Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a [[creator deity]] in their respective systems. The [[Vedas]] of [[Ceylon]] admitted only the possibility that deities might exist but went no further. Neither prayers nor sacrifices were suggested in any way by the tribes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/storyofcivilizat035369mbp/storyofcivilizat035369mbp_djvu.txt The Story of Civilization]; [[Will Durant]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical atheist thought began to appear in Europe and Asia in the sixth or fifth century BCE. [[Will Durant]], in his ''[[The Story of Civilization]]'', explained that certain [[pygmy]] tribes found in Africa were observed to have no identifiable cults or rites. There were no totems, no deities, and no spirits. Their dead were buried without special ceremonies or accompanying items and received no further attention. They even appeared to lack simple superstitions, according to travelers' reports.

==Indian philosophy==
{{Main|Atheism in Hinduism}}
In the East, a contemplative life not centered on the idea of deities began in the sixth century BCE with the rise of [[Jainism]], [[Buddhism]], and  [[atheism in Hinduism|various sects]] of [[Hinduism]] in India, and of [[Taoism]] in China.  These religions offered a philosophic and salvific path not involving deity worship. Deities are not seen as necessary to the salvific goal of the early Buddhist tradition, their reality is explicitly questioned and often rejected. There is a fundamental incompatibility between the notion of gods and basic Buddhist principles, at least in some interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddhist Attitude to God|url=http://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebdha068.htm|website=budsas|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[astika]] ("orthodox") schools of [[Hindu philosophy]], the [[Samkhya]] and the early [[Mimamsa]] school did not accept a creator-deity in their respective systems.

The principal text of the [[Samkhya]] school, the ''[[Samkhya Karika]]'', was written by [[Ishvara Krishna]] in the fourth century CE, by which time it was already a dominant Hindu school. The origins of the school are much older and are lost in legend. The school was both dualistic and atheistic. They believed in a dual existence of [[Prakriti]] ("nature") and [[Purusha]] ("spirit") and had no place for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in its system, arguing that the existence of Ishvara cannot be proved and hence cannot be admitted to exist. The school dominated Hindu philosophy in its day, but declined after the tenth century, although commentaries were still being written as late as the sixteenth century.

The foundational text for the Mimamsa school is the ''[[Purva Mimamsa Sutras]]'' of [[Jaimini]] (c. third to first century BCE). The school reached its height c. 700 CE, and for some time in the [[Early Middle Ages]] exerted near-dominant influence on learned Hindu thought. The Mimamsa school saw their primary enquiry was into the nature of [[dharma]] based on close interpretation of the [[Vedas]]. Its core tenets were [[ritual]]ism ([[orthopraxy]]), antiasceticism and antimysticism. The early Mimamsakas believed in an ''[[adrishta]]'' ("unseen") that is the result of performing [[karmas]] ("works") and saw no need for an [[Ishvara]] ("God") in their system. Mimamsa persists in some subschools of Hinduism today.

===Cārvāka===
The thoroughly [[Materialism|materialistic]] and antireligious philosophical [[Cārvāka]] school that originated in [[India]] with the [[Bārhaspatya-sūtras]] (final centuries BCE) is probably the most explicitly atheist school of philosophy in the region. The school grew out of the generic skepticism in the [[Mauryan period]]. Already in the sixth century BCE, [[Ajita Kesakambalin]], was quoted in Pali scriptures by the Buddhists with whom he was debating, teaching that "with the break-up of the body, the wise and the foolish alike are annihilated, destroyed. They do not exist after death."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cārvākan philosophy is now known principally from its [[Astika]] and [[Buddhist]] opponents. The proper aim of a Cārvākan, according to these sources, was to live a prosperous, happy, productive life in this world. The ''Tattvopaplavasimha'' of [[Jayarashi Bhatta]] (c. 8th century) is sometimes cited as a surviving Carvaka text. The school appears to have died out sometime around the fifteenth century.

===Buddhism===
{{Main|God in Buddhism|Buddhist cosmology}}
The nonadherence&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Tittha Sutta: Sectarians|year=1997|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.061.than.html |authorlink=Anguttara Nikaya, 3.61|language=English|quote=Then in that case, a person is a killer of living beings because of a supreme being's act of creation... When one falls back on lack of cause and lack of condition as being essential, monks, there is no desire, no effort [at the thought], 'This should be done. This shouldn't be done.' When one can't pin down as a truth or reality what should &amp; shouldn't be done, one dwells bewildered &amp; unprotected. One cannot righteously refer to oneself as a contemplative.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the notion of a [[God|supreme deity]] or a [[Primum movens|prime mover]] is seen by many as a key distinction between [[Buddhism]] and other religions. While Buddhist traditions do not deny the existence of supernatural beings (many are discussed in [[Buddhist scripture]]), it does not ascribe powers, in the typical Western sense, for creation, salvation or judgement, to the "gods", however, praying to enlightened deities is sometimes seen as leading to some degree of spiritual merit.

Buddhists accept the existence of beings in higher realms, known as [[Deva (Buddhism)|''devas'']], but they, like humans, are said to be suffering in ''[[Samsara (Buddhism)|samsara]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Thirty-one planes of Existence|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sagga/loka.html|publisher=Access To Insight|accessdate=26 May 2010|author=John T Bullitt|year=2005|quote=The suttas describe thirty-one distinct "planes" or "realms" of existence into which beings can be reborn during this long wandering through samsara. These range from the extraordinarily dark, grim, and painful hell realms all the way up to the most sublime, refined, and exquisitely blissful heaven realms. Existence in every realm is impermanent; in Buddhist cosmology there is no eternal heaven or hell. Beings are born into a particular realm according to both their past kamma and their kamma at the moment of death. When the kammic force that propelled them to that realm is finally exhausted, they pass away, taking rebirth once again elsewhere according to their kamma. And so the wearisome cycle continues.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not particularly wiser than we are. In fact the Buddha is often portrayed as a teacher of the deities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Teacher of the Devas |year=1997 |publisher=Buddhist Publication Society |url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |author=Susan Elbaum Jootla |editor=Access To Insight |location=Kandy, Sri Lanka |chapter=II. The Buddha Teaches Deities |quote="Many people worship Maha Brahma as the supreme and eternal creator God, but for the Buddha he is merely a powerful deity still caught within the cycle of repeated existence. In point of fact, "Maha Brahma" is a role or office filled by different individuals at different periods.", "His proof included the fact that "many thousands of deities have gone for refuge for life to the recluse Gotama" (MN 95.9). Devas, like humans, develop faith in the Buddha by practicing his teachings.", "A second deva concerned with liberation spoke a verse which is partly praise of the Buddha and partly a request for teaching. Using various similes from the animal world, this god showed his admiration and reverence for the Exalted One.", "A discourse called Sakka's Questions (DN 21) took place after he had been a serious disciple of the Buddha for some time. The sutta records a long audience he had with the Blessed One which culminated in his attainment of stream-entry. Their conversation is an excellent example of the Buddha as "teacher of devas," and shows all beings how to work for Nibbana." |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204142247/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/jootla/wheel414.html |archivedate=4 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and superior to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bhikku|first=Thanissaro|title=Kevaddha Sutta|year=1997|publisher=Access To Insight|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.11.0.than.html#bigbrahma|authorlink=Digha Nikaya, 11|quote=When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be... That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However, he answers it, you should take it to heart.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this they do have some enlightened Devas in the path of buddhahood.

===Jainism===
{{See also|Jainism and non-creationism}}
Jains see their tradition as eternal. Organized [[Jainism]] can be dated back to [[Parshva]] who lived in the ninth century BCE, and, more reliably, to [[Mahavira]], a teacher of the sixth century BCE, and a contemporary of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. Jainism is a dualistic religion with the [[universe]] made up of [[matter]] and [[souls]]. The universe, and the matter and souls within it, is eternal and uncreated, and there is no omnipotent creator deity in Jainism. There are, however, "gods" and other spirits who exist within the universe and Jains believe that the soul can attain "godhood"; however, none of these supernatural beings exercise any sort of creative activity or have the capacity or ability to intervene in answers to prayers.

==Classical Greece and Rome==
[[File:socrates.png|thumb|150px|right|[[Socrates]]]]
In Western [[classical Antiquity]], theism was the fundamental belief that supported the [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] of the state (the ''[[polis]]'', later the [[Roman Empire]]). Historically, any person who did not believe in any deity supported by the state was fair game to accusations of atheism, a [[Capital punishment|capital crime]]. For political reasons, [[Socrates]] in Athens (399 BCE) was accused of being ''atheos'' ("refusing to acknowledge the gods recognized by the state").&lt;ref&gt;Tim Whitmarsh, ''Battling the Gods: Atheism in the Ancient World''. New York 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christians in Rome were also considered subversive to the state religion and persecuted as atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pablo|first=Martin|title=Remaining Catholic: Six Good Reasons for Staying in an Imperfect Church|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1IL-xz8VrwC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;lpg=PA41&amp;dq=Christians+in+Rome+were+also+considered+subversive+to+the+state+religion+and+persecuted+as+atheists&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JdWKIatguj&amp;sig=sS6MJUymBI5ogayP5fsEdNDAN6g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=s1o_U6vDD_bLsQT38oLABQ&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Christians%20in%20Rome%20were%20also%20considered%20subversive%20to%20the%20state%20religion%20and%20persecuted%20as%20atheists&amp;f=false|work=p. 41|accessdate=5 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, charges of atheism, meaning the subversion of religion, were often used similarly to charges of [[heresy]] and [[impiety]] as a political tool to eliminate enemies.

===Presocratic philosophy===
The roots of [[Western philosophy]] began in the Greek world in the sixth century BCE. The first Hellenic philosophers were not atheists, but they attempted to explain the world in terms of the processes of nature instead of by mythological accounts. Thus [[lightning]] was the result of "wind breaking out and parting the clouds",&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximander]], ap. [[Hippolytus of Rome]], ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 6&lt;/ref&gt; and earthquakes occurred when "the earth is considerably altered by heating and cooling".&lt;ref&gt;[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], ap. Hippolytus, ''Refutation of all Heresies'', i. 7&lt;/ref&gt; The early philosophers often criticized traditional religious notions. [[Xenophanes]] (6th century BCE) famously said that if cows and horses had hands, "then horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cows like cows".&lt;ref&gt;[[Clement of Alexandria]], ''Stromata'', v. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another philosopher, [[Anaxagoras]] (5th century BCE), claimed that the [[Sun]] was "a fiery mass, larger than the [[Peloponnese]]"; a charge of impiety was brought against him, and he was forced to flee [[Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ii. 6–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The first fully materialistic philosophy was produced by the [[Atomism|atomists]] [[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]] (5th century BCE), who attempted to explain the formation and development of the world in terms of the chance movements of [[atom]]s moving in infinite space.

[[Euripides]] (480–406 BCE), in his play [[Bellerophon (play)|''Bellerophon'']], had the eponymous main character say:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Doth some one say that there be gods above?&lt;br&gt;
There are not; no, there are not. Let no fool,&lt;br&gt;
Led by the old false fable, thus deceive you.”&lt;ref&gt;

===The Sophists===
In the fifth century BCE the [[Sophists]] began to question many of the traditional assumptions of Greek culture. [[Prodicus of Ceos]] was said to have believed that "it was the things which were serviceable to human life that had been regarded as gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Cicero]], ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 42&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Protagoras]] stated at the beginning of a book that "With regard to the gods I am unable to say either that they exist or do not exist".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De Natura Deorum'', i. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late fifth century BCE, the Greek [[lyric poetry|lyric poet]] [[Diagoras of Melos]] was sentenced to death in [[Athens]] under the charge of being a "godless person" (ἄθεος) after he made fun of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]],&lt;ref name="Garland2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Garland|first1=Robert|title=Ancient Greece: Everyday Life in the Birthplace of Western Civilization|date=2008|publisher=Sterling|location=New York City, New York|isbn=978-1-4549-0908-8|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winiarczyk|first1=Marek|title=Diagoras of Melos: A Contribution to the History of Ancient Atheism|date=2016|translator-last=Zbirohowski-Kościa|translator-first=Witold|publisher=Walther de Gruyter|location=Berlin, Germany|isbn=978-3-11-044765-1|pages=61–68|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NryvDAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Diagoras+of+Melos&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwianNXO5c7YAhVM4oMKHfPAA2IQ6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Diagoras%20of%20Melos&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkert|first=Walter|authorlink=Walter Burkert|date=1985|title=Greek Religion|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-36281-0|pages=311–317|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Burkert]], ''[[Homo necans]]'', p. 278&lt;/ref&gt; but he fled the city to escape punishment.&lt;ref name="Garland2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burkert1985"/&gt; Later writers have cited Diagoras as the "first atheist",&lt;ref&gt;[[Friedrich Solmsen|Solmsen, Friedrich]] (1942).

Comments and English text by Richard D. McKirahan. Thomas Library, Bryn Mawr College, 1997, page 3. {{ISBN|0-929524-89-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was probably not an atheist in the modern sense of the word.&lt;ref name="Winiarczyk"/&gt; Somewhat later (c. 300 BCE), the [[Cyrenaic]] philosopher [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] is supposed to have denied that gods exist and wrote a book ''On the Gods'' expounding his views.

[[Euhemerus]] (c. 330–260 BCE) published his view that the gods were only the deified rulers, conquerors, and founders of the past, and that their cults and religions were in essence the continuation of vanished kingdoms and earlier political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Fragments of Euhemerus' work in Ennius' Latin translation have been preserved in [[Church Fathers|Patristic]] writings (e.g. by [[Lactantius]] and [[Eusebius of Caesarea]]), which all rely on earlier fragments in [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]] 5,41–46 &amp; 6.1. Testimonies, especially in the context of polemical criticism, are found e.g. in [[Callimachus]], ''Hymn to Zeus'' 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Euhemerus was later criticized for having "spread atheism over the whole inhabited earth by obliterating the gods",&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Moralia – Isis and Osiris'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Isis_and_Osiris*/B.html#23 23]&lt;/ref&gt; his worldview was not atheist in a strict and theoretical sense, because he differentiated that the [[Greek primordial gods|primordial deities]] were "eternal and imperishable".&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius of Caesarea, ''[[Preparation for the Gospel]]'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/eusebius_pe_02_book2.htm II.45–48] (chapter 2); Euhemerus also acknowledged that the sun, moon, and the other celestial bodies were deities (cf. also Alan Scott, ''Origen and the Life of the Stars'', Oxford 1991, p. 55), and he regarded elemental earthly phenomena such as the wind as divine, for they had "eternal origin and eternal continuance". Nevertheless he concluded that the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] and all next-generation deities such as the [[Twelve Olympians|Olympian deities]] existed only as culturally and religiously constructed divine entities with a human past (cp. also Harry Y. Gamble, "Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: 'Contra Celsum' III 22–43", in ''Vigiliae Christianae'', Vol. 33, No. 1 (1979), pp. 12–29).&lt;/ref&gt; Some historians have argued that he merely aimed at reinventing the old religions in the light of the beginning of deification of political rulers such as [[Alexander the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;"Euhemeros", in Konrat Ziegler &amp; Walther Sontheimer, ''Der Kleine Pauly'', Bd. 2 (1979), cols. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus' work was translated into Latin by [[Ennius]], possibly to [[Mythography|mythographically]] pave the way for the planned [[Apotheosis|divinization]] of [[Scipio Africanus]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Cole, "Cicero, Ennius and the Concept of Apotheosis at Rome". In ''Arethusa'' Vol. 39 No. 3 (2006), pp. 531–548&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epicureanism===
The most important Greek thinker in the development of atheism was [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}} 300 BCE).&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt; Drawing on the ideas of Democritus and the Atomists, he espoused a materialistic philosophy according to which the universe was governed by the laws of chance without the need for divine intervention (see [[scientific determinism]]).&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/ |title=Epicurus (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) |work=Plato.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Epicurus still maintained that the gods existed,&lt;ref name="GraftonMostSettis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; he believed that they were uninterested in human affairs.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt; The aim of the Epicureans was to attain ''[[ataraxia]]'' ("peace of mind") and one important way of doing this was by exposing fear of divine wrath as irrational. The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and the need to fear divine punishment after death.&lt;ref name="EpicStanEncycl"/&gt;

One of the most eloquent expressions of Epicurean thought is [[Lucretius]]' ''[[On the Nature of Things]]'' (1st century BCE) in which he held that gods exist but argued that religious fear was one the chief cause of human unhappiness and that the gods did not involve themselves in the world.&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC: Ancient atheists|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/atheism/history/ancient.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Long and Sedley|first=A.A. and D.N.|title=The Hellenistic Philosophers, vol.1|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0521275563|pages=144–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Epicureans also denied the existence of an afterlife and hence dismissed the fear of death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julius Caesar]] (100–44 BCE), who leaned considerably toward Epicureanism, also rejected the idea of an afterlife, which e.g. lead to his plea against the death sentence during the trial against [[Catiline]], where he spoke out against the [[Stoicism|Stoic]] [[Cato the Younger|Cato]] (cf. [[Sallust]], ''The War With Catiline'', Caesar's speech: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#51.20 51.29] &amp; Cato's reply: [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Sallust/Bellum_Catilinae*.html#52.13 52.13]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Epicureans were not persecuted, but their teachings were controversial and were harshly attacked by the mainstream schools of [[Stoicism]] and [[Neoplatonism]]. The movement remained marginal, and gradually died out by the end of the [[Roman Empire]].

==The Middle Ages==
===Islamic world===
In medieval [[Islam]], Muslim scholars recognized the idea of atheism and frequently attacked [[kafir|unbelievers]], although they were unable to name any atheists.&lt;ref&gt;"Various Muslim theologians in the early Abbasid periods wrote treatises 'Against the Unbelievers,' ... the earliest extant work bearing this title is probably the ''Radd ala al-mulhid'' of the ninth-century [[Zaidiyyah|Zaydi]] theologian al-Qasim b. Ibrahim. ... Nevertheless, in the discussions of God's existence the actual opponents are not identified as individuals. As a group they are sometimes referred to as heretics, unbelievers, materialists, or skeptics. These designations often appear together, and they do not always seem to be clearly distinguished in the authors' mind." Sarah Stroumsa, (1999), ''Freethinkers of medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rawandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', pages 121–3. BRILL&lt;/ref&gt; When individuals were accused of atheism, they were usually viewed as heretics rather than proponents of atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Stroumsa, 1999, ''Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn al-Rdwandi, Abu Bakr al-Razi, and their Impact on Islamic Thought'', page 123. BRILL.&lt;/ref&gt; However, outspoken rationalists and atheists existed, one notable figure being the ninth-century scholar [[Ibn al-Rawandi]], who criticized the notion of religious [[prophecy]], including that of [[Muhammad]], and maintained that religious dogmas were not acceptable to reason and must be rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam, 1971, Volume 3, page 905.&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics of religion in the Islamic world include the physician and philosopher [[Abu Bakr al-Razi]] (865–925), the poet [[Al-Maʿarri]] (973–1057), and the scholar [[Abu Isa al-Warraq]] (fl. 9th century). Al-Maʿarri, for example, wrote and taught that religion itself was a "fable invented by the ancients"&lt;ref name="Nicholson318"&gt;Reynold Alleyne Nicholson, 1962, ''A Literary History of the Arabs'', page 318. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; and that humans were "of two sorts: those with brains, but no religion, and those with religion, but no brains."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html Freethought Traditions in the Islamic World] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214102422/http://www.sdsmt.edu/student-orgs/tfs/reading/freethought/islam.html |date=14 February 2012 }} by Fred Whitehead; also quoted in Cyril Glasse, (2001), ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', p. 278. Rowman Altamira.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
In the European [[Middle Ages]], no clear expression of atheism is known. The titular character of the [[Icelandic saga]] [[Hrafnkell]], written in the late thirteenth century, says, "I think it is folly to have faith in gods". After his temple to [[Freyr]] is burnt and he is enslaved, he vows never to perform another [[Blót|sacrifice]], a position described in the sagas as ''goðlauss'', "godless". [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''[[Deutsche Mythologie|Teutonic Mythology]]'' observes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is remarkable that Old Norse legend occasionally mentions certain men who, turning away in utter disgust and doubt from the heathen faith, placed their reliance on their own strength and virtue. Thus in the [[Sôlar lioð]] 17 we read of Vêbogi and Râdey ''â sik þau trûðu,'' "in themselves they trusted",&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Grimm, 1882, ''Teutonic Mythology'' Part 1, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
citing several other examples, including two kings.

In Christian Europe, people were persecuted for heresy, especially in countries where the [[Inquisition]] was active. Prominent examples of dissent included the Cathers and the Waldensians. These sects, however antagonistic to the Church, are not examples of Atheism. While rebellions against the Church occurred, none could be considered exactly Atheist.&lt;ref&gt;John Arnold, ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another phenomenon in the Middle Ages was proofs of the existence of God. Both [[Anselm of Canterbury]], and later, [[William of Ockham]] acknowledge adversaries who doubt the existence of God. [[Thomas Aquinas]]' five proofs of God's existence and Anselm's ontological argument implicitly acknowledged the validity of the question about God's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Bullivant, Stephen, and Michael Ruse. The Oxford Handbook of Atheism. Oxford University Press, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Copleston]], however, explains that Thomas laid out his proofs not to counter atheism, but to address certain early Christian writers such as [[John of Damascus]], who asserted that knowledge of God's existence was naturally innate in man, based on his natural desire for happiness.&lt;ref name="copleston337"&gt;Frederick Copleston. 1950. ''A History of Philosophy: Volume II: Medieval Philosophy: From Augustine to Duns Scotus.'' London: Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne. pp. 336–337&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas stated that although there is desire for happiness which forms the basis for a proof of God's existence in man, further reflection is required to understand that this desire is only fulfilled in God, not for example in wealth or sensual pleasure.&lt;ref name="copleston337"/&gt;

The charge of atheism was used to attack political or religious opponents. [[Pope Boniface VIII]], because he insisted on the political supremacy of the church, was accused by his enemies after his death of holding (unlikely) positions such as "neither believing in the immortality nor incorruptibility of the soul, nor in a life to come".&lt;ref&gt;John William Draper, 1864, [http://www.h-net.org/~bahai/diglib/books/A-E/D/draper/drap3.htm ''History of the intellectual development of Europe''], page 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Arnold's ''Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe'' discusses individuals who were indifferent to the Church and did not participate in faith practices. Arnold notes that while these examples could be perceived as simply people being lazy, it demonstrates that "belief was not universally fervent". Arnold enumerates examples of people not attending church, and even those who excluded the Church from their marriage. Disbelief, Arnold argues, stemmed from boredom. Arnold argues that while some blasphemy implies the existence of God, laws demonstrate that there were also cases of blasphemy that directly attacked articles of faith. Italian preachers in the fourteenth century also warned of unbelievers and people who lacked belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Arnold|title=Belief and Unbelief in Medieval Europe|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0340807866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renaissance and Reformation==
During the time of the [[Renaissance]] and the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], criticism of the religious establishment became more frequent in predominantly Christian countries, but did not amount to atheism, ''per se''.

The term ''athéisme'' was coined in France in the sixteenth century. The word "atheist" appears in English books at least as early as 1566.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |contribution=English recusant literature, 1558–1640 |volume=203 |title=A Replie to Mr Calfhills Blasphemous Answer Made Against the Treatise of the Cross |page=51 |first=John |last=Martiall |authorlink=John Marshall (priest) |year=1566 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20snAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22to%20entre#v=snippet&amp;q=atheist&amp;f=false
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The concept of atheism re-emerged initially as a reaction to the intellectual and religious turmoil of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and the Reformation, as a charge used by those who saw the denial of god and godlessness in the controversial positions being put forward by others. During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the word 'atheist' was used exclusively as an insult; nobody wanted to be regarded as an atheist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armstrong |first=Karen | authorlink = Karen Armstrong |title=A History of God |page=288 |year=1999 |publisher=London: Vintage |isbn=0-09-927367-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although one overtly atheistic compendium known as the ''[[Theophrastus redivivus]]'' was published by an anonymous author in the seventeenth century, atheism was an epithet implying a [[Libertine|lack of moral restraint]].&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Jennifer Michael (2004). ''Doubt: A History''. HarperOne. pp. 325, {{ISBN|0-06-009795-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|upright|The Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] contended in the 17th century that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe.]]

According to [[Geoffrey Blainey]], the Reformation in Europe had paved the way for atheists by attacking the authority of the Catholic Church, which in turn "quietly inspired other thinkers to attack the authority of the new Protestant churches". [[Deism]] gained influence in France, Prussia and England, and proffered belief in a noninterventionist deity, but "while some deists were atheists in disguise, most were religious, and by today's standards would be called true believers". The scientific and mathematical discoveries of such as Copernicus, Newton and Descartes sketched a pattern of natural laws that lent weight to this new outlook&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.388&lt;/ref&gt; Blainey wrote that the Dutch philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]] was "probably the first well known 'semi-atheist' to announce himself in a Christian land in the modern era". Spinoza had been expelled from his synagogue for his protests against the teachings of its rabbis and for failing to attend Saturday services. He believed that God did not interfere in the running of the world, but rather that natural laws explained the workings of the universe. In 1661 he published his ''[[Short Treatise on God]]'', but he was not a popular figure for the first century following his death: "An unbeliever was expected to be a rebel in almost everything and wicked in all his ways", wrote Blainey, "but here was a virtuous one. He lived the good life and made his living in a useful way. . . . It took courage to be a Spinoza or even one of his supporters. If a handful of scholars agreed with his writings, they did not so say in public".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; p.343&lt;/ref&gt;

How dangerous it was to be accused of being an atheist at this time is illustrated by the examples of [[Étienne Dolet]], who was [[Strangling|strangled]] and burned in 1546, and [[Giulio Cesare Vanini]], who received a similar fate in 1619. In 1689 the Polish nobleman [[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], who had denied the existence of God in his philosophical treatise ''De non-existentia Dei'', was imprisoned unlawfully; despite [[Warsaw Confederation]] tradition and king Sobieski's intercession, Łyszczyński was condemned to death for atheism and beheaded in [[Warsaw]] after his tongue was pulled out with a burning iron and his hands slowly burned. Similarly in 1766, the French nobleman [[François-Jean de la Barre]], was [[torture]]d, beheaded, and his body burned for alleged [[vandalism]] of a [[crucifix]], a case that became a [[cause célèbre]] because [[Voltaire]] tried unsuccessfully to have the judgment reversed.

The English philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679) was also accused of atheism, but he denied it. His theism was unusual, in that he held god to be material. Even earlier, the British playwright and poet [[Christopher Marlowe]] (1563–1593) was accused of atheism when a tract denying the divinity of Christ was found in his home. Before he could finish defending himself against the charge, Marlowe was murdered.

In early modern times, the first explicit atheist known by name was the German-languaged Danish critic of religion [[Matthias Knutzen]] (1646–after 1674), who published three atheist writings in 1674.&lt;ref&gt;Winfried Schröder, in: Matthias Knutzen: Schriften und Materialien (2010), p. 8. See also Rececca Moore, ''The Heritage of Western Humanism, Scepticism and Freethought'' (2011), calling Knutzen "the first open advocate of a modern atheist perspective" [http://reason.sdsu.edu/germany.html online here]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kazimierz Łyszczyński]], a Polish philosopher (executed in 1689, following a hasty and controversial trial) demonstrated strong atheism in his work ''De non-existentia Dei'':

While not gaining converts from large portions of the population, versions of deism became influential in certain intellectual circles. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] challenged the Christian notion that human beings had been tainted by sin since the Garden of Eden, and instead proposed that humans were originally good, only later to be corrupted by civilization. The influential figure of [[Voltaire]], spread deistic notions of to a wide audience. "After the French Revolution and its outbursts of atheism, Voltaire was widely condemned as one of the causes", wrote Blainey, "Nonetheless, his writings did concede that fear of God was an essential policeman in a disorderly world: 'If God did not exist, it would be necessary to invent him', wrote Voltaire".&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.390–391&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably the first book in modern times solely dedicated to promoting atheism was written by French Catholic priest [[Jean Meslier]] (1664–1729), whose posthumously published lengthy philosophical essay (part of the original title: ''Thoughts and Feelings of Jean Meslier ... Clear and Evident Demonstrations of the Vanity and Falsity of All the Religions of the World''&lt;ref&gt;Full title: ''Mémoire des pensées et sentiments de Jean Meslier, prêtre-curé d'Etrépigny et de Balaives, sur une partie des erreurs et des abus de la conduite et du gouvernement des hommes, où l'on voit des démonstrations claires et évidentes de la vanité et de la fausseté de toutes les religions du monde, pour être adressé à ses paroissiens après sa mort et pour leur servir de témoignage de vérité à eux et à tous leurs semblables''&lt;/ref&gt;)  rejects the concept of god (both in the Christian and also in the Deistic sense), the soul, miracles and the discipline of theology.&lt;ref name="onfray"&gt;Michel Onfray (2007). ''Atheist Manifesto: The Case Against Christianity, Judaism, and Islam''. Arcade Publishing. {{ISBN|1559708204}}. p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Michel Onfray]] states that Meslier's work marks the beginning of "the history of true atheism".&lt;ref name="onfray"/&gt;

By the 1770s, atheism in some predominantly Christian countries was ceasing to be a dangerous accusation that required denial, and was evolving into a position openly avowed by some. The first open denial of the existence of God and avowal of atheism since classical times may be that of [[Baron d'Holbach]] (1723–1789) in his 1770 work, ''[[The System of Nature]]''. D'Holbach was a Parisian social figure who conducted a famous salon widely attended by many intellectual notables of the day, including [[Denis Diderot]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[David Hume]], [[Adam Smith]], and [[Benjamin Franklin]]. Nevertheless, his book was published under a pseudonym, and was banned and publicly burned by the [[Executioner]].&lt;!-- Who was the "Executioner"? --&gt; {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Diderot, one of the Enlightenment's most prominent ''philosophes'' and editor-in-chief of the [[Encyclopédie]], which sought to challenge religious, particularly [[Catholicism|Catholic]], dogma said, "Reason is to the estimation of the ''philosophe'' what grace is to the Christian", he wrote. "Grace determines the Christian's action; reason the ''philosophe''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinzler.com/ushistory/diderotsupp.html |title=The Philosophe |publisher=Pinzler.com |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diderot was briefly imprisoned for his writing, some of which was banned and burned.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In Scotland, [[David Hume]] produced a six volume history of England in 1754, which gave little attention to God. He implied that if God existed he was impotent in the face of European upheaval. Hume ridiculed miracles, but walked a careful line so as to avoid being too dismissive of Christianity. With Hume's presence, Edinburgh gained a reputation as a "haven of atheism", alarming many ordinary Britons.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.392&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fête de la Raison 1793.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Fête de la Raison'' ("Festival of Reason"), Notre Dame, 20 [[Brumaire]] (1793)]]
The ''culte de la Raison'' developed during the uncertain period 1792–94 (Years I and III of the Revolution), following the [[September massacres]], when Revolutionary France was rife with fears of internal and foreign enemies. Several Parisian churches were transformed into Temples of Reason, notably the Church of Saint-Paul Saint-Louis in [[Le Marais|the Marais]]. The churches were closed in May 1793 and more securely 24 November 1793, when the [[Catholic Mass]] was forbidden.

Blainey wrote that "atheism seized the pedestal in revolutionary France in the 1790s. The secular symbols replaced the cross. In the cathedral of Notre Dame the altar, the holy place, was converted into a monument to Reason..." During the [[Reign of Terror|Terror of 1792–93]], France's Christian calendar was abolished, monasteries, convents and church properties were seized and monks and nuns expelled. Historic churches were dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Short History of Christianity; Viking; 2011; pp.397–8&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cult of Reason]] was a creed based on atheism devised during the [[French Revolution]] by [[Jacques Hébert]], [[Pierre Gaspard Chaumette]], and their supporters. It was stopped by [[Maximilien Robespierre]], a [[Deist]], who instituted the [[Cult of the Supreme Being]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=War, Terror, and Resistance | url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/chap7c.html | accessdate=31 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both cults were the outcome of the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|"de-Christianization" of French society]] during the Revolution and part of the [[Reign of Terror]].

The Cult of Reason was celebrated in a [[carnival]] atmosphere of parades, ransacking of churches, ceremonious [[iconoclasm]], in which religious and royal images were defaced, and ceremonies which substituted the "martyrs of the Revolution" for Christian martyrs. The earliest public demonstrations took place ''en province'', outside Paris, notably by [[Hébertists]] in [[Lyon]], but took a further radical turn with the ''Fête de la Liberté'' ("Festival of Liberty") at [[Notre Dame de Paris]], 10 November (20 Brumaire) 1793, in ceremonies devised and organised by [[Pierre-Gaspard Chaumette]].

The pamphlet ''Answer to [[Joseph Priestley|Dr. Priestley's]] Letters to a Philosophical Unbeliever'' (1782) is considered to be the first published declaration of atheism in Britain—plausibly the first in English (as distinct from covert or cryptically atheist works). The otherwise unknown William Hammon (possibly a pseudonym) signed the preface and postscript as editor of the work, and the anonymous main text is attributed to [[Matthew Turner (physician)|Matthew Turner]] (d. 1788?), a Liverpool physician who may have known Priestley. Historian of atheism David Berman has argued strongly for Turner's authorship, but also suggested that there may have been two authors.&lt;ref&gt;see Berman 1988, Chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
===Nineteenth century===
The [[French Revolution]] of 1789 catapulted atheistic thought into political notability in some Western countries, and opened the way for the nineteenth century movements of [[Rationalism]], [[Freethought]], and Liberalism. Born in 1792, [[Romantic poetry|Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], a child of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], was expelled from England's Oxford University in 1811 for submitting to the Dean an anonymous pamphlet that he wrote entitled, ''[[The Necessity of Atheism]].'' This pamphlet is considered by scholars as the first atheistic tract published in the English language. An early atheistic influence in Germany was ''[[The Essence of Christianity]]'' by [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1804–1872). He influenced other German nineteenth century atheistic thinkers like [[Karl Marx]], [[Max Stirner]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] (1788–1860), and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900).

The freethinker [[Charles Bradlaugh]] (1833–1891) was repeatedly elected to the [[British Parliament]], but was not allowed to take his seat after his request to affirm rather than take the religious oath was turned down (he then offered to take the oath, but this too was denied him). After Bradlaugh was re-elected for the fourth time, a new Speaker allowed Bradlaugh to take the oath and permitted no objections.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Humanist Association]], [http://www.humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanist-tradition/freethinkers/charles-bradlaugh ''Charles Bradlaugh (1833–91)'']&lt;/ref&gt; He became the first outspoken atheist to sit in Parliament, where he participated in amending the [[Oaths Act 1888|Oaths Act]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hansard]], ''Oaths Bill 1888'', [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/mar/14/second-reading ''Second Reading, 14 March 1888'']; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1888/aug/09/third-reading ''Third Reading, 9 August 1888'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Karl Marx]]
In 1844, Karl Marx (1818–1883), an atheistic political economist, wrote in his ''Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right'': "Religious suffering is, at one and the same time, the expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, and the soul of soulless conditions. It is the [[opium of the people]]." Marx believed that people turn to religion in order to dull the pain caused by the reality of social situations; that is, Marx suggests religion is an attempt at transcending the material state of affairs in a society—the pain of class oppression—by effectively creating a dream world, rendering the religious believer amenable to [[social control]] and exploitation in this world while they hope for relief and justice in [[life after death]]. In the same essay, Marx states, "[m]an creates religion, religion does not create man".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karl|first=Marx|authorlink=Karl Marx|date=February 1844|title=A Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right|journal=Deutsch-Französische Jahrbücher|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1843/critique-hpr/intro.htm|accessdate=24 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nietzsche1882.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Friedrich Nietzsche]]
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]], a prominent nineteenth century philosopher, is well known for coining the aphorism ''"[[God is dead]]" ''(German: "''Gott ist tot''"); incidentally the phrase was not spoken by Nietzsche directly, but was used as a dialogue for the characters in his works. Nietzsche argued that Christian theism as a belief system had been a moral foundation of the Western world, and that the rejection and collapse of this foundation as a result of modern thinking (the ''death of God'') would naturally cause a rise in [[nihilism]] or the lack of values. While Nietzsche was staunchly atheistic, he was also concerned about the negative effects of nihilism on humanity. As such, he called for a re-evaluation of old values and a creation of new ones, hoping that in doing so humans would achieve a higher state he labeled the [[Übermensch|Overman]] (''Übermensch'').

[[Atheist feminism]] also began in the nineteenth century. Atheist feminists oppose religion as a main source of female [[oppression]] and [[gender inequality]], believing that the majority of religions are [[Sexism|sexist]] and oppressive to women.&lt;ref name="newstatesman1"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/books/2009/07/women-god-stangroom-benson |title=Does God Hate Women? |journal=New Statesman |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Twentieth century===
Atheism in the twentieth century found recognition in a wide variety of other, broader philosophies in the Western tradition, such as [[existentialism]], [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonard Peikoff]], "The Philosophy of Objectivism" lecture series (1976), [http://www.aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/atheism.html Lecture 2].&lt;/ref&gt; [[secular humanism]], [[nihilism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Marxism]], [[anarchism]], [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;Overall, Christine. "Feminism and Atheism", in Martin, Michael, ed. (2007), The Cambridge Companion to Atheism, pp. 233–246. Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and the general scientific and [[rationalist movement]]. [[Neopositivism]] and [[analytical philosophy]] discarded classical rationalism and metaphysics in favor of strict empiricism and epistemological [[nominalism]]. Proponents such as [[Bertrand Russell]] emphatically rejected belief in God. In his early work, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] attempted to separate metaphysical and supernatural language from rational discourse. [[H. L. Mencken]] sought to debunk both the idea that science and religion are compatible, and the idea that science is a dogmatic belief system just like any religion.&lt;ref&gt;Mencken, H. L. "Treatise on the Gods," 2nd ed., The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. J. Ayer]] asserted the unverifiability and meaninglessness of religious statements, citing his adherence to the empirical sciences. The [[structuralism]] of [[Claude Lévi-Strauss|Lévi-Strauss]] sourced religious language to the human subconscious, denying its transcendental meaning. [[John Niemeyer Findlay|J. N. Findlay]] and [[J. J. C. Smart]] argued that the existence of God is not logically necessary. [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalists]] and [[Materialism|materialists]] such as [[John Dewey]] considered the natural world to be the basis of everything, denying the existence of God or immortality.&lt;ref&gt;Zdybicka, Zofia J. (2005), "Atheism", p. 16 in Maryniarczyk, Andrzej, Universal Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 1, Polish Thomas Aquinas Association&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smart, J.C.C. (9 March 2004). "Atheism and Agnosticism". Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. Retrieved 2007-04-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that during the twentieth century, atheists in Western societies became more active and even militant, though they often "relied essentially on arguments used by numerous radical Christians since at least the eighteenth century". They rejected the idea of an interventionist God, and said that Christianity promoted war and violence, though "the most ruthless leaders in the Second World War were atheists and secularists who were intensely hostile to both Judaism and Christianity" and "Later massive atrocities were committed in the East by those ardent atheists, [[Pol Pot]] and [[Mao Zedong]]". Some scientists were meanwhile articulating a view that as the world becomes more educated, religion will be superseded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.543&lt;/ref&gt;

===State atheism===
[[File:Mao, Bulganin, Stalin, Ulbricht Tsedenbal.jpeg|thumb|[[Mao Zedong]] with [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1949. Both leaders repressed religion and established [[state atheism]] throughout their respective Communist spheres.]]
Often, the state's opposition to religion took more violent forms. [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] documents widespread persecution, imprisonments and torture of believers in his seminal work ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]''. Consequently, religious organizations, such as the Catholic Church, were among the most stringent opponents of communist regimes. In some cases, the initial strict measures of control and opposition to religious activity were gradually relaxed in communist states. Pope [[Pius XI]] followed his encyclicals challenging the new right-wing creeds of [[Italian Fascism]] (''[[Non abbiamo bisogno]]'', 1931) and [[Nazism]] (''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'', 1937) with a denunciation of atheistic Communism in ''[[Divini redemptoris]]'' (1937).&lt;ref name="EBOPiusXI"&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Pius XI''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russian Orthodox Church]], for centuries the strongest of all Orthodox Churches, was suppressed by the Soviet government.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; p.494&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, the Soviet regime arrested the [[Patriarch Tikhon|Patriarch of the Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="Blainey"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''A Short History of Christianity''; Viking; 2011; p.493&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of [[Vladimir Lenin]], with his rejection of religious authority as a tool of oppression and his strategy of "patently explain," Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] energetically pursued the persecution of the Church through the 1920s and 1930s. Lenin wrote that every religious idea and every idea of God "is unutterable vileness... of the most dangerous kind, 'contagion of the most abominable kind".&lt;ref name="MartinAmis"&gt;Martin Amis; Koba the Dread; Vintage Books; London; 2003; {{ISBN|1400032202}}; p.30-31&lt;/ref&gt; Many priests were killed and imprisoned. Thousands of churches were closed, some turned into hospitals. In 1925 the government founded the [[League of Militant Atheists]] to intensify the persecution. The regime only relented in its persecution following the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941.&lt;ref name="Viking p.494"/&gt; Bullock wrote that "A Marxist regime was 'godless' by definition, and Stalin had mocked religious belief since his days in the Tiflis seminary". His assault on the Russian peasantry, wrote Bullock, "had been as much an attack on their traditional religion as on their individual holdings, and the defense of it had played a major part in arousing peasant resistance . . . ".&lt;ref name="Stalin pp.412"&gt;[[Alan Bullock]]; ''[[Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives]]''; Fontana Press; 1993; pp.412&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Divini Redemptoris'', Pius XI said that atheistic Communism being led by Moscow was aimed at "upsetting the social order and at undermining the very foundations of Christian civilization":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19031937_divini-redemptoris_en.html Divini Redemptoris – Encyclical of Pope Pius XI on Atheistic Communism]; by Pope Pius XI; 19 March 1937&lt;/ref&gt;

The central figure in Italian Fascism was the atheist [[Benito Mussolini]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"&gt;[[Geoffrey Blainey]]; ''[[A Short History of Christianity]]''; Viking; 2011; pp.495–6&lt;/ref&gt; In his early career, Mussolini was a strident opponent of the Church, and the first [[Fascist manifesto|Fascist program]], written in 1919, had called for the secularization of Church property in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;F. L. Carsten; ''The Rise of Fascism''; Methuen &amp; Co Ltd; London; 1976; p.77&lt;/ref&gt; More pragmatic than his German ally Adolf Hitler, Mussolini later moderated his stance, and in office, permitted the teaching of religion in schools and came to terms with the Papacy in the [[Lateran Treaty]].&lt;ref name="Christianity pp.495-6"/&gt; Nevertheless, ''Non abbiamo bisogno'' condemned his Fascist movement's "pagan worship of the State" and "revolution which snatches the young from the Church and from Jesus Christ, and which inculcates in its own young people hatred, violence and irreverence."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica Online: ''Fascism – identification with Christianity''; web Apr. 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Party membership was required for civil service jobs. The majority of Nazi Party members did not leave their churches. Evans wrote that, by 1939, 95 percent of Germans still called themselves Protestant or Catholic, while 3.5 percent were ''[[gottgläubig]]'' (lit. "believing in god") and 1.5 percent atheist. Most in these latter categories were "convinced Nazis who had left their Church at the behest of the Party, which had been trying since the mid 1930s to reduce the influence of Christianity in society".&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J.

Across Eastern Europe following World War II, the parts of the [[Nazi Empire]] conquered by the Soviet [[Red Army]], and Yugoslavia became one party Communist states, which, like the Soviet Union, were antipathetic to religion. Persecutions of religious leaders followed.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Hebblethwaite; Paul VI, the First Modern Pope; Harper Collins Religious; 1993; p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies; Rising '44: the Battle for Warsaw; Vikiing; 2003; p.566 &amp; 568&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union ended its truce against the Russian Orthodox Church, and extended its persecutions to the newly Communist Eastern bloc: "In [[Polish anti-religious campaign|Poland]], Hungary, Lithuania and other Eastern European countries, Catholic leaders who were unwilling to be silent were denounced, publicly humiliated or imprisoned by the Communists.

The 1976 Constitution of the People's Socialist Republic of Albania, for instance, was firmly based on a Marxist dismissal of religion as the opiate of the masses. It provided: "The state recognizes no religion of any kind and supports and develops the atheist view so as to ingrain in to the people the scientific and materialistic world-view."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right to religious practice was restored with the fall of communism in 1991.

Further post-war communist victories in the East saw religion purged by atheist regimes across China, North Korea and much of Indo-China.&lt;ref name="Viking p.508"/&gt; In 1949, China became a Communist state under the leadership of [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[Communist Party of China]]. China itself had been a cradle of religious thought since ancient times, being the birthplace of [[Confucianism]] and [[Daoism]], and Buddhists having arrived in the first century AD. Under Mao, China became officially atheist, and though some religious practices were permitted to continue under State supervision, religious groups deemed a threat to order have been suppressed—as with Tibetan Buddhism from 1959 and [[Falun Gong]] in recent years. Today around two-fifths of the population claim to be nonreligious or atheist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/258959/Altaic#toc258961 Encyclopædia Britannica Online – China: Religion]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Religious schools and social institutions were closed, foreign missionaries expelled, and local religious practices discouraged.&lt;ref name="Viking p.508"/&gt; During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Mao instigated "struggles" against the Four Olds: "old ideas, customs, culture, and habits of mind".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/111803/China/71854/Attacks-on-party-members Encyclopædia Britannica Online – China – History: Cultural Revolution]; accessed 10 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, the Communist Party launched a three-year drive to promote atheism in Tibet, saying intensifying propaganda on atheism is "especially important for Tibet because atheism plays an extremely important role in promoting economic construction, social advancement and socialist spiritual civilization in the region".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/world/monitoring/253345.stm China announces "civilizing" atheism drive in Tibet]; BBC; 12 January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atheist feminism]] has also become more prominent in the 2010s. In 2012 the first "Women in Secularism" conference was held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|title=Women in Secularism: 2012 conference in Washington, DC|work=Women in Secularism|accessdate=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730235818/http://www.womeninsecularism.org/2012/|archive-date=30 July 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Secular Woman was founded on 28 June 2012 as the first national American organization focused on non-religious women. The mission of Secular Woman is to amplify the voice, presence, and influence of non-religious women. The [[Atheist feminism|atheist feminist movement]] has also become increasingly focused on fighting [[misogyny]], [[sexism]] and [[sexual harassment]] within the atheist movement itself, especially since the upheaval following [[Michael Shermer]]'s allegations of [[sexual assault]] and coverage of his violent behavior applied by [[James Randi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/markoppenheimer/will-misogyny-bring-down-the-atheist-movement|title=Will Misogyny Bring Down The Atheist Movement?|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|first=Mark|last=Oppenheimer|date=12 September 2014|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the first atheist monument on American government property was unveiled at the [[Bradford County, Florida|Bradford County]] Courthouse in Florida; it is a 1,500-pound granite bench and [[plinth]] inscribed with quotes by [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_f9a8713c-e2cf-11e2-b9d8-001a4bcf887a.html|title=First atheist monument on government property unveiled|work=The Independent Florida Alligator|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/06/29/atheists-unveil-monument-in-florida-and-promise-to-build-50-more/|title=Atheists unveil monument in Florida and promise to build 50 more|publisher=|accessdate=27 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Madison, Wisconsin's common council amended their city's equal opportunity ordinance, adding atheism as a protected class in the areas of employment, housing, and public accommodations.&lt;ref name="channel1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Time for Kids |url=http://www.channel3000.com/news/madison-first-in-nation-to-pass-ordinance-protecting-atheists/32125682 |title=Madison first in nation to pass ordinance protecting atheists &amp;#124; News |publisher=Channel3000.com |date=1 April 2015 |accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes Madison the first city in America to pass an ordinance protecting atheists.&lt;ref name="channel1"/&gt;

On 16 December 2016, [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[Frank R.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7242">In mathematics, a '''Hurewicz space''' is a [[topological space]] that satisfies a certain basic [[selection principle]] that generalizes [[Σ-compact space|σ-compactness]]. A Hurewicz space is a space in which for every sequence of open covers &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; of the space there are finite sets &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}_1 \subset \mathcal{U}_1, \mathcal{F}_2 \subset \mathcal{U}_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; such that every point of the space belongs to all but finitely many sets &lt;math&gt;\bigcup\mathcal{F}_1, \bigcup\mathcal{F}_2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt; .

== History ==
In 1926, [[Witold Hurewicz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hurewicz|first=Witold|title=Über eine Verallgemeinerung des Borelschen Theorems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01216792|journal=Mathematische Zeitschrift|language=de|volume=24|issue=1|pages=401–421|doi=10.1007/BF01216792|issn=0025-5874}}&lt;/ref&gt; introduced the above property of topological spaces that is formally stronger than the [[Menger space|Menger property]]. He didn't know whether [[Menger space|Menger's conjecture]] is true, and whether his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property, but he conjectured that in the class of metric spaces his property is equivalent to &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compactness.

== Hurewicz's conjecture ==
Hurewicz conjectured that in [[ZFC]] every Hurewicz metric space is σ-compact. Just, Miller, [[Marion Scheepers|Scheepers]], and Szeptycki&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Just|first=Winfried|last2=Miller|first2=Arnold W.|last3=Scheepers|first3=Marion|last4=Szeptycki|first4=Paul J.|date=1996-11-11|title=The combinatorics of open covers II|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864196000752|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=73|issue=3|pages=241–266|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(96)00075-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; proved that Hurewicz's conjecture is false, by showing that there is, in ZFC, a set of real numbers that is Menger but not σ-compact. Their proof was dichotomic, and the set witnessing the failure of the conjecture heavily depends on whether a certain (undecidable) axiom holds or not.

Bartoszyński and [[Saharon Shelah|Shelah]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartoszynski|first=Tomek|last2=Shelah|first2=Saharon|date=2001-11-15|title=Continuous images of sets of reals|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166864100000791|journal=Topology and its Applications|volume=116|issue=2|pages=243–253|doi=10.1016/S0166-8641(00)00079-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Boaz Tsaban|Tsaban]]'s solution based on their work &lt;ref&gt;Boaz Tsaban (2011), 'Menger's and Hurewicz's Problems: Solutions from "The Book"  and refinements', in "Set Theory and its Applications" Contemporary Mathematics 533, 211–226. https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.5645&lt;/ref&gt; ) gave a uniform ZFC example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not σ-compact.

== Hurewicz's problem ==
Hurewicz asked whether in [[ZFC]] his property is strictly stronger than the Menger property. In 2002, Chaber and Pol in unpublished note, using dichotomy proof, showed that there is a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is not Menger. In 2008, Tsaban and Zdomskyy&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tsaban|first=Boaz|last2=Zdomskyy|first2=Lyubomyr|date=2008-01-01|title=Scales, fields, and a problem of Hurewicz|url=http://www.ems-ph.org/doi/10.4171/JEMS/132|journal=Journal of the European Mathematical Society|volume=10|issue=3|pages=837–866|doi=10.4171/jems/132|issn=1435-9855|arxiv=math/0507043}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave a uniform example of a Hurewicz subset of the real line that is Menger but not Hurewicz.

== Characterizations ==

=== Combinatorial characterization ===
For subsets of the real line, the Hurewicz property can be characterized using continuous functions into the [[Baire space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. For functions &lt;math&gt;f,g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, write &lt;math&gt;f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; f(n)\leq g(n)&lt;/math&gt; for all but finitely many natural numbers &lt;math&gt; n&lt;/math&gt;. A subset &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is bounded if there is a function &lt;math&gt;g\in \mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;such that &lt;math&gt; f\leq^* g&lt;/math&gt; for all functions &lt;math&gt; f\in A&lt;/math&gt;. A subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; is unbounded if it is not bounded. Hurewicz proved that a subset of the real line is Hurewicz iff every continuous image of that space into the Baire space is unbounded. In particular, every subset of the real line of cardinality less than the [[Cichoń's diagram|bounding number &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{b}&lt;/math&gt;]] is Hurewicz.

=== Topological game characterization ===
Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space. The Hurewicz game played on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a game with two players Alice and Bob.

'''1st round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_1\subset \mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''2nd round''': Alice chooses an open cover &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Bob chooses a finite set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}_2\subset \mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.

'''etc.'''

The word "[[Value (ethics)|value]]" is both a verb and a noun, each with multiple meanings. But its root meaning always involves social judgments of qualities such as [[good]]ness, worth, [[truth]], [[justice]], [[beauty]]. The word names either the rational criterion applied when judging, or results of judging, the presence of such qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 39"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Theory of Valuation|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1939}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1-3}}&lt;ref name="Tile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tiles|first1=Mary|last2=Oberdiek|first2=Hans|title=Living in a Technological Culture|publisher=Routledge|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37–44}} 

Humans attribute qualities to objects, beliefs, and behaviors as they identify means that "work" to carry on [[social interaction|social life]], and ends that are "right" for social life itself.  Qualities that "work" are judged by the '''instrumental criterion''', and are said to possess instrumental value.  Qualities that are "right" in themselves are judged by the '''intrinsic criterion''', and are said to possess intrinsic value.  The value of a smart phone or a scientific theory is instrumental.  The value of the [[Ten Commandments]] or the [[US Constitution]] is intrinsic.

==Overview==
The noun value sometimes names the instrumental or intrinsic criterion being applied.  More often, it names things judged to possess instrumental or intrinsic value.  Modern scholars have refined these ancient common-sense meanings of value.  [[sociology|Sociologist]] [[Max Weber]] applied the labels instrumental and intrinsic value to two patterns of social action.  Here are his original definitions, followed by current labels for the two criteria from the ''Oxford Handbook of Value Theory''.

{{quotation
|Social action, like all action, may be [judged] ...:
     1) ''instrumentally rational'' (''zweckrational''), that is, determined by expectations as to the behavior of objects in the environment of other human beings; these expectations are used as "conditions" or "means" for the attainment of the actor's own rationally pursued and calculated ends'

     2) ''value-rational'' (''wertrational''), that is, determined by a conscious belief in the value for its own sake of some ethical, [[aesthetic]], religious, or other form of behavior, independently of its prospects of success;...,&lt;ref name="Max 22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Max|title=Economy and Society|publisher=University of California Press|date=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24–5}}}}

{{quotation
|... the distinction between what is good "in itself" and what is good "as a means."}}

{{quotation
|The concept of intrinsic value has been glossed variously as what is ''valuable for its own sake, in itself, on its own, in its own right'', as ''an end'', or ''as such''.  By contrast, extrinsic value has been characterized mainly as what is valuable as a means, or for something else's sake.}}

{{quotation
|Among nonfinal values, instrumental value--intuitively, the value attaching a means to what is finally valuable--stands out as a [[bona fide]] example of what is not valuable for its own sake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hirose|first1=Iwao|last2=Olson|first2=Jonas|title=The Oxford Handbook of Value Theory|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14, 29, 34}}}}

The assumption that humans apply two distinct criteria of judgment creates problems.  People ask, "How can we know which objects have which qualities?"  Things that "work" may appear obvious, but can stop working or have bad consequences.  Things that are "right" are not-at-all obvious and are often controversial.  This article samples usages of instrumental and intrinsic value and some disputes they generate.  Evidence is drawn from the work of four scholars.

Philosopher [[John Dewey]] and economist [[John Fagg Foster]] denied legitimacy to intrinsic value.  They treated it as contaminated application of instrumental value, and showed how instrumental value alone can judge ends and means that both work and are right.  Philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]] argued that instrumental value had itself become contaminated by inhuman industrial power unregulated by intrinsic supernatural value.  Philosopher [[Anjan Chakravartty]] argued that modern [[scientific realism]] confirms the truth of intrinsic value and the fallacy of relativistic instrumental value.

To reduce ambiguity, throughout this article the noun "value" names a criterion of judgment but not an object judged valuable.  The noun "valuation" names an object judged valuable.  The plural noun "values" identifies collections of valuations, without identifying the criterion applied.

==John Dewey==
[[John Dewey]] judged the human belief in intrinsic value to be a futile and failed search for a community [[moral compass]]. He saw no need for intrinsic value because instrumental value enables human groups to coordinate beliefs and behaviors that both work and are right.  Every social transaction has good or bad consequences depending on prevailing conditions that are satisfied or not.  Continuous reasoning adjusts patterns to keep them working on the right track as conditions change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=John Dewey|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=152–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey thought that belief in intrinsic value contaminates instrumental value by isolating judgments of what is right from judgments of what works. For him, "restoring integration and cooperation between man's [[beliefs]] about the world in which he lives and his beliefs about the values [valuations] and purposes that should direct his conduct is the deepest problem of modern life."&lt;ref name="Dew 29"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Quest for Certainty|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|255}}  "A culture which permits science to destroy traditional values [valuations] but which distrusts its power to create new ones is a culture which is destroying itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Freedom and Culture|publisher=G. P. Putnam's Sons|date=1963|page=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey agreed with Max Weber that people talk as if they apply instrumental and intrinsic criteria.  And he agreed with Weber's observation that intrinsic value is problematic because it ignores the relationship between context and consequences of beliefs and behaviors.  Both men questioned how anything valued intrinsically "for its own sake" can  have operationally efficient consequences.

{{quotation
|... the more the value to which action is oriented is elevated to the status of an absolute [intrinsic] value, the more "irrational" in this [instrumental] sense the corresponding action is.  For the more unconditionally the actor devotes himself to this value for its own sake, ... the less he is influenced by considerations of the consequences of his action.&lt;ref name="Max 22"/&gt;{{rp|26, 399–400}}}}

But Dewey rejected the common belief--shared by Weber--that supernatural intrinsic value is necessary to show humans what is permanently "right."  He argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in daily life, where conditions are always changing.

{{quotation
|Man who lives in a world of hazards ... has sought to attain [security] in two ways.  One of them began with an attempt to propitiate the [intrinsic] powers which environ him and determine his destiny.  It expressed itself in supplication, sacrifice, ceremonial rite and magical cult  ....  The other course is to invent [instrumental] arts and by their means turn the powers of nature to account;...&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|3}}}}

{{quotation
|... for over two thousand years, the ... most influential and authoritatively orthodox tradition ... has been devoted to the problem of a purely cognitive certification (perhaps by revelation, perhaps by intuition, perhaps by reason) of the antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness.  ....  The crisis in contemporary culture, the confusions and conflicts in it, arise from a division of authority.  Scientific [instrumental] inquiry seems to tell one thing, and traditional beliefs [intrinsic valuations] about ends and ideals that have authority over conduct tell us something quite different.  ....  As long as the notion persists that knowledge is a disclosure of [intrinsic] reality ... prior to and independent of knowing, and that knowing is independent of a purpose to control the quality of experienced objects, the failure of natural science to disclose significant values [valuations] in its objects will come as a shock.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|43–4}}}}

Finding no evidence of "antecedent immutable reality of truth, beauty, and goodness...," Dewey argued that both efficient and legitimate qualities are discovered in the continuity of human [[experience]], which always has [[Antecedent (behavioral psychology)|antecedent]]s, and is always mutable.

{{quotation
|Dewey's ethics replaces the goal of identifying an ultimate end or supreme principle that can serve as a criterion of ethical evaluation with the goal of identifying a method for improving our value judgments.  Dewey argued that ethical inquiry is of a piece with empirical inquiry more generally.  ....  This pragmatic approach requires that we locate the conditions of warrant for our value judgments in human conduct itself, not in any ''a priori'' fixed reference point outside of conduct, such as in God's commands, Platonic Forms, pure reason, or "nature," considered as giving humans a fixed ''telos'' [intrinsic end].;&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Anderson|first=Elizabeth|title=Dewey's Moral Philosophy|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://lplato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/dewey-moral}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|114, 172–3; 197}}}}

Philosophers label a "fixed reference point outside of conduct' a "natural kind," and presume it to have eternal existence knowable in itself without being experienced.  Natural kinds are "mind-independent" and "theory-independent" valuations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Bird|first1=Alexander|last2=Tobin|first2=Emma|title=Natural Kinds|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2016/entries/natural-kinds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey granted the existence of "reality" apart from human experience, but denied that it is structured as natural kinds possessing intrinsic qualities.&lt;ref name="Dew 29"/&gt;{{rp|122, 196}}  Instead, he saw reality as functional continuity--ways of acting--not structural continuity of intrinsic interacting entities.  Humans may intuit static kinds and qualities, but such private experience cannot warrant inferences or valuations about mind-independent reality.  Reports or maps of any sort are never equivalent to that which is mapped.  They are fragmentary perceptions of unceasing processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burke|first=Tom|title=Dewey's New Logic|publisher=University of Chicago Press|date=1994|pages=54=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People reason daily about what they ought to do and how they ought to do it.  They discover sequences of efficient means that achieve consequences successfully.  Once an end is reached - a [[problem solving|problem solved]] - reasoning turns to what comes next in new conditions of means-end relations. Valuations and actions which ignore conditions that determine consequences cannot coordinate behavior to solve real problems.  They are [[irrational]].

{{quotation
|Value judgments have the form: if one acted in a particular way (or valued this object), then certain consequences would ensue, which would be valued.  The difference between an apparent and a real good [means or end], between an unreflectively and a reflectively valued good, is captured by its value [valuation of goodness] not just as immediately experienced in isolation, but in view of its wider consequences and how they are valued.    ....  So viewed, value judgments are tools for discovering how to live a better life, just as scientific hypotheses are tools for uncovering new information about the world.&lt;ref name="Anderson"/&gt;}}

In brief, Dewey rejected the traditional belief that judging things good-in-themselves, apart from existing means-end relations, can be rational.  The sole rational criterion is instrumental value.  Each successful valuation is conditional but, cumulatively, all are developmental solutions of problems.   Cumulative instrumental success provides a legitimate moral compass.  Competent instrumental valuations treat the "function of consequences as necessary tests of the validity of propositions, ''provided'' these consequences are operationally instituted and are such as to resolve the specific problems evoking the operations...";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dewey|first=John|title=Logic: the Theory of Inquiry|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|date=1938|page=iv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|29–31}}

==J. Fagg Foster==
[[John Fagg Foster]] refined John Dewey's rejection of intrinsic value and description of instrumental value.  He clarified differences between Dewey's instrumental criterion and the widely endorsed but faulty utilitarian alternative that turns utility into an intrinsic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Miller|first=Edythe|title=John Fagg Foster|editor-last=Hodgson|editor-first=Geoffrey M.|encyclopedia=Elgar Companion to Institutional and Evolutionary Economics|date=1994|volume=1|pages=256–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least since [[Aristotle]], scholars have reasoned that individual wants are intrinsic traits of human nature, the satisfaction of which is a legitimate end.  This belief is embodied in the criterion of utility, which holds that individuals--and groups of individuals in societies--legitimately try to maximize the sum of their want satisfactions.;&lt;ref name="Tool"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tool|first=Marc|title=Value Theory and Economic Progress: The Institutional Economics of J. Fagg Foster|publisher=Kluwer Academic|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|40–48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacIntyre|first=Alasdair|title=After Virtue|publisher=University of Notre Dame Press|date=2007|pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Utilitarians]] hold that individual wants cannot be rationally justified.  They are intrinsically worthy mental valuations and cannot be judged instrumentally.  This belief supports philosophers who hold that facts--"what is"--can serve as instrumental means for achieving wants, but cannot authorize ends--"what ought to be."  This fact-value distinction creates what philosophers label the is-ought problem: wants are intrinsically fact-free, good in themselves, while efficient tools are valuation-free, usable for good or bad ends.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|60}}  In modern North American culture, this utilitarian belief supports the [[Libertarian]] assertion that every individual's intrinsic right to satisfy  wants makes it illegitimate for anyone--but especially governments--to tell people what they ought to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nozick|first=Robert|title=Anarchy, State and Utopia|publisher=Basic Books|date=1974|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster found this "is-ought" problem a useful place to attack the irrational separation of means from ends.  He started his analysis by arguing that want-satisfaction--"what ought to be"--cannot serve as an intrinsic moral compass because wants are themselves consequences of transient conditions.

{{quotation
|[T]he things people want are a function of their social experience, and that is carried on through structural institutions that specify their activities and attitudes.  Thus the pattern of people's wants takes visible form partly as a result of the pattern of the institutional structure through which they participate in the economic process.  As we have seen, to say that an economic problem exists is to say that part of the particular patterns of human relationships has ceased or failed to provide the effective participation of its members.  In so saying, we are necessarily in the position of asserting that the instrumental efficiency of the economic process is the criterion of judgment in terms of which, and only in terms of which, we may resolve economic problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|title=The Relation Between the Theory of Value and Economic Analysis|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1981|pages=904–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Since wants are shaped by social conditions, they must be judged instrumentally.  Wants arise in problematic situations when habitual patterns of behavior fail to maintain instrumental correlations.&lt;ref name="Tool"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  Foster supported with homely examples his thesis that problematic situations--"what is"--contain the means for judging rationally factual ends: "what ought to be."

Consider the problem all infants face learning to walk. They spontaneously recognize that walking is more efficient than crawling--an instrumental valuation of a desirable end.  They learn to walk by repeatedly moving and balancing, judging the efficiency with which these means achieve their instrumental goal.  When they master this new way of acting, they experience great satisfaction, but satisfaction is never their end-in-view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Confronting Foster's Wildest Claim: Only the Instrumental Theory of Value Can Be applied"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=2008|pages=537–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the global problem of unemployment.  Since the industrial revolution began, large groups of people have been deprived of traditional means of participation in two social functions--productive activity and income security--and of the dignity maintained by that participation.  Conditions that exclude participation--"what is"--must be replaced by new patterns of inclusion--"what ought to be."

At the end of World War II, the United States faced the threat of massive unemployment caused by demobilization.  Labor markets--the traditional utilitarian solution to unemployment--appeared unlikely to avoid that threat.  The instrumental solution was to prescribe a new pattern of correlated behavior to maintain participation: the [[G.I. Bill]], which generously subsidized education and livelihood for veterans and fostered a massive burst of innovation and economic expansion.  The instrumental moral compass of participation worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ranson|first=Baldwin|title="Planning Education for Economic Progress: Distinguishing Occupational Demands from Technological Possibilities"|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|year=1986|pages=1053–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Skocpol|first=Theda|title=Diminished Democracy|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Intrinsic value as either rule or reality was ignored.

Foster labeled successful applications of instrumental value "instrumental efficiency."  But he realized that efficiency by itself can contaminate reasoning by turning a dynamic process--"what ought to be"--into a static valuation--"what is."  Turning a conditionally-successful tool-use into a static self-justifying pattern of behavior is self-defeating.

To guard against this contamination of instrumental value, Foster revised his definition of its content to embrace both means and ends. INSTRUMENTAL VALUE: The criterion of judgment that seeks instrumentally-efficient means that "work" to achieve developmentally-continuous ends.  This definition stresses the condition that a successful operation must not lead down a dead-end street.  The same point is made by the currently popular concern for sustainability--a synonym for instrumental value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foster|first=John Fagg|year=1981|title=Syllabus for Problems of Modern Society: The Theory of Institutional Adjustment|journal=Journal of Economic Issues|pages=929–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dewey's and Foster's arguments that instrumental value is the proper criterion for judging both means and ends continue to be ignored rather than refuted.  Scholars continue to accept the possibility and necessity of knowing intrinsic value--"what ought to be"--independently of transient conditions that determine actual consequences of every action.  Jacques Ellul and Anjan Chakravartty were prominent exponents of popular arguments for the reality of intrinsic value as moral compass and as constraint on relativistic instrumental value.

==Jacques Ellul==
[[Jacques Ellul]] made scholarly contributions to many fields, but his American reputation grew out of his criticism of the autonomous authority of instrumental value, the criterion that Dewey and Foster found to be the core of human rationality.  And he specifically criticized the valuations central to Dewey's and Foster's thesis: evolving instrumental technology.

His principal work, published in 1954, bore the French title ''La technique.''  It addressed the problem Dewey addressed in 1929: a culture in which the authority of evolving technology destroys traditional valuations without creating legitimate new ones.  Both men agreed that conditionally efficient valuations--"what is"--become irrational when viewed as unconditionally efficient in themselves--"what ought to be."  But while Dewey argued that contaminated instrumental valuations can be self-correcting, Ellul concluded that technology had become intrinsically destructive.  The only escape from this evil is to restore authority to unconditional sacred valuations:

{{quotation
|Nothing belongs any longer to the realm of the gods or the supernatural.  The individual who lives in the technical milieu knows very well that there is nothing spiritual anywhere.  But man cannot live without the [intrinsic] sacred.  He therefore transfers his sense of the sacred to the very thing which has destroyed its former object: to technique itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Society|publisher=Knopf|date=1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|143}}}}

''La technique'' was published in English in 1964 with the title ''The Technological Society'', and quickly entered ongoing disputes in the United States over the responsibility of instrumental value for destructive social consequences.  The translator of ''Technological Society'' summarized Ellul's thesis:

{{quotation
|''Technological Society'' is a description of the way in which an autonomous [instrumental] technology is in process of taking over the traditional values [intrinsic valuations] of every society without exception, subverting and suppressing those values to produce at last a monolithic world culture in which all non-technological difference and variety is mere appearance.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|v-vi, x}}}}

Ellul opened ''The Technological Society'' by asserting that instrumental efficiency is no longer a conditional criterion.  It has become autonomous and absolute.

{{quotation
|The term ''technique'', as I use it, does not mean machines, technology, or this or that procedure for attaining an end.  In our technological society, technique is the ''totality of methods rationally arrived at and having absolute efficiency'' (for a given stage of development) in ''every'' field of human activity.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|xxxvi}}}}

He accused instrumental judgment of destroying intrinsic meanings of human life.  "Think of our dehumanized factories, our unsatisfied senses, our working women, our estrangement from nature.  Life in such an environment has no meaning.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|4–5}}  Weber had labeled the discrediting of intrinsic valuations "disenchantment;" Ellul came to label it "terrorism."&lt;ref name="Ell 90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellul|first1=Jacques|title=The Technological Bluff|publisher=William B. Erdmans|date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|384, 19}}  He dated its domination to the 1800s, when centuries-old handicraft techniques were massively eliminated by inhuman industry.

{{quotation
|When, in the 19th century, society began to elaborate an exclusively rational technique which acknowledged only considerations of efficiency, it was felt that not only the traditions but the deepest instincts of humankind had been violated.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|73}}}}

{{quotation
|Culture is necessarily humanistic or it does not exist at all.  ....  [I]t answers questions about the meaning of life, the possibility of reunion with ultimate being, the attempt to overcome human finitude, and all other questions that they have to ask and handle.  But technique cannot deal with such things.  ....  Culture exists only if it raises the question of meaning and values [valuations].  ....  Technique is not at all concerned about the meaning of life, and it rejects any relation to values [intrinsic valuations].&lt;ref name="Ell 90"/&gt;{{rp|147–8}}}}

Ellul's core accusation was that instrumental efficiency had become absolute--a good-in-itself.&lt;ref name="Ell 64"/&gt;{{rp|83}}  It wraps societies in a new technological milieu with six intrinsically inhuman characteristics:

{{quotation
|a) It is artificial; b) it is autonomous with respect to values [valuations], ideas, and the state; c) It is ... self-determinative independently of all human intervention; d) It grows according to a process which is causal but not directed to ends; e) It is formed by an accumulation of means which have established primacy over ends; f) All its parts are mutually implicated to such a degree that it is impossible to separate them or to settle any technical problems in isolation.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22}}}}

Tiles and Oberdiek found Ellul's characterization of instrumental efficiency inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|22–31}}  They criticized him for anthropomorphizing and demonizing instrumental value.  They countered by examining the moral reasoning of scientists whose work led to nuclear weapons.  Those scientists demonstrated the capacity of instrumental judgments to provide them with a moral compass to judge nuclear technology with conscience and responsibility, with no need for intrinsic rules.  Tiles's and Oberdiek's conclusion coincided with that of Dewey and Foster: instrumental value, when competently applied, is self-correcting and provides humans with a developmental moral compass.

{{quotation
|For although we have defended general principles of the moral responsibilities of professional people, it would be foolish and wrongheaded to suggest codified [intrinsic] rules.  It would be foolish because concrete cases are more complex and nuanced than any code could capture; it would be wrongheaded because it would suggest that our sense of moral responsibility can be fully captured by a code.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|193}}}}

{{quotation
|In fact, as we have seen in many instances, technology simply allows us to go on doing stupid things in clever ways.  The questions that technology cannot solve, although it will always frame and condition the answers, are "What should we be trying to do? What kind of lives should we, as human beings, be seeking to live?  And can this kind of life be pursued without exploiting others?   But until we can at least propose [instrumental] answers to those questions we cannot really begin to do sensible things in the clever ways that technology might permit.&lt;ref name="Tile"/&gt;{{rp|197}}}}

==Anjan Chakravartty&lt;!--'Semi-realism' and 'Semirealism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{also|Selective realism}}
[[Anjan Chakravartty]] came indirectly to question the autonomous authority of instrumental value.  He viewed it as a foil for the currently dominant philosophical school labeled "[[scientific realism]]," with which he identifies.  In 2007, he published a work defending the ultimate authority of intrinsic valuations to which realists are committed.  He linked the pragmatic instrumental criterion to discredited anti-realist empiricist schools including [[logical positivism]] and [[instrumentalism]]

Chakravartty began his study with rough characterizations of realist and anti-realist valuations of theories.  Anti-realists believe "that theories are merely instruments for predicting observable phenomena or systematizing observation reports."  They assert that theories can never report or prescribe truth or reality "in itself."  By contrast, scientific realists believe that theories can "correctly describe both observable and unobservable parts of the world."&lt;ref name="Chak"&gt;{{cite book|last=Chakravartty|first=Anjan|title=A Metaphysics for Scientific Realism|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xi, 10}}  Well-confirmed theories--"what ought to be" as the end of reasoning--are more than tools.  They are mappings of intrinsic properties of an unobservable and unconditional territory--"what is" as natural but metaphysical real kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|xiii, 33, 149}}

Chakravartty treated value-in-general as ungrounded opinion,&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|25}} but admitted that realists value how well theories "work"--the instrumental criterion.  He qualified that criterion's scope, claiming that every instrumental judgment is inductive, heuristic, accidental.  Later experience might confirm a singular judgment only if it proves to have universal validity, meaning it possesses "detection properties" of natural kinds.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|231}}  This inference is his fundamental ground for believing in intrinsic value.

He committed modern realists to three metaphysical valuations or intrinsic kinds of knowledge of truth.  Competent realists affirm that natural kinds 1) exist in a mind-independent territory possessing 2) meaningful and 3) mappable intrinsic properties.

{{quotation
|Ontologically, scientific realism is committed to the existence of a mind-independent world or reality.  A realist semantics implies that the theoretical claims [valuations] about this reality have truth values, and should be construed literally ...  Finally, the epistemological commitment is to the idea that these theoretical claims give us knowledge of the world.  That is, predictively successful (mature, non-ad hoc) theories, taken literally as describing the nature of a mind-independent reality are (approximately) true.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|9}}}}

He labeled these intrinsic valuations semirealist, meaning they are currently the most accurate theoretical descriptions of mind-independent natural kinds.  He found these carefully qualified statements necessary to replace earlier realist descriptions discredited by advancing instrumental valuations.

Science has destroyed for many people the supernatural intrinsic value embraced by Weber and Ellul.  But Chakravartty defended natural intrinsic valuations as necessary elements of all science--belief in unobservable continuities.  He advanced the thesis of '''semirealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, according to which well-tested theories are good maps of natural kinds, as confirmed by their instrumental success.  Their predictive success means they conform to mind-independent, unconditional reality.

{{quotation
|Scientific theories describe causal properties, concrete structures, and particulars such as objects, events, and processes.  Semirealism maintains that under certain conditions it is reasonable for realists to believe that the best of these descriptions tell us not merely about things that can be experienced with the unaided senses, but also about some of the unobservable things underlying them.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|Causal properties are the fulcrum of semirealism.  Their [intrinsic] relations compose the concrete structures that are the primary subject matters of a tenable scientific realism.  They regularly cohere to form interesting units, and these groupings make up the particulars investigated by the sciences and described by scientific theories.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|119}}}}

Chakravartty argued that these semirealist valuations authorize scientific theorizing about pragmatic kinds, as scientists search for natural kinds.  The fact that theoretical kinds are frequently replaced does not mean that mind-independent reality is changing, but simply that theoretical maps are approximating intrinsic reality.

{{quotation
|The primary motivation for thinking that there are such things as natural kinds is the idea that carving nature according to its own divisions yields groups of objects that are capable of supporting successful inductive generalizations and prediction.  So the story goes, one's recognition of natural categories facilitates these practices, and thus furnishes an excellent explanation for their success.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|151}}}}

{{quotation
|The moral here is that however realists choose to construct particulars out of instances of properties, they do so on the basis of a belief in the [mind-independent] existence of those properties.  That is the bedrock of realism.  Property instances lend themselves to different forms of packaging [instrumental valuations], but as a feature of scientific description, this does not compromise realism with respect to the relevant [intrinsic] packages.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|81}}}}

In sum, Chakravartty argued that contingent instrumental valuations are warranted only as they approximate unchanging intrinsic valuations.  Scholars continue to perfect their explanations of  intrinsic value, as they deny the developmental continuity of applications of instrumental value.

{{quotation
|Abstraction is a process in which only some of the potentially many relevant factors present in [unobservable] reality are represented in a model or description with some aspect of the world, such as the nature or behavior of a specific object or process.  ... Pragmatic constraints such as these play a role in shaping how scientific investigations are conducted, and together which and how many potentially relevant factors [intrinsic kinds] are incorporated into models and descriptions during the process of abstraction.  The role of pragmatic constraints, however, does not undermine the idea that putative representations of factors composing abstract models can be thought to have counterparts in the [mind-independent] world.&lt;ref name="Chak"/&gt;{{rp|191}}}}

Realist intrinsic value, such as proposed by Chakravartty, is widely endorsed in modern scientific circles, while the supernatural intrinsic value endorsed by Weber and Ellul maintains its popularity throughout the world.  Doubters about the reality of instrumental and intrinsic value are few.

"'''Keep Your Eyes on the Prize'''" is a [[folk song]] that became influential during the [[American Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1950s and 1960s. It is based on the traditional song, "[[Gospel Plow]]," also known as "Hold On," "Keep Your Hand on the Plow," and various permutations thereof.

An early reference to the older song, "Gospel Plow," is in [[Alan Lomax]]'s 1949 book "''Our Singing Country''."&lt;ref name="Lomax"&gt;Lomax, John and Alan, ''Our Singing Country, A Second Volume of American Ballads and Folk Songs'', The Macmillan Company, New York, 1949. p 44 - 45&lt;br&gt;http://www.traditionalmusic.co.uk/our-singing-country/our-singing-country%20-%200007.htm&lt;br&gt;Roud Folk Song Index&lt;br&gt;http://www.vwml.org.uk/search/search-roud-indexes?qtext=10075&amp;ts=1377893044534&amp;collectionfilter=RoudFS;RoudBS#record=1&lt;/ref&gt; The book references a 1937 recording by Elihu Trusty of Paintsville, Kentucky, which is in the Library of Congress (Ref No .1397 A1). Lomax's references for Gospel Plow cite two earlier works. The first is from ''English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians'' &lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Cecil J., and Campbell, O., English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians. 2 vols. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1917. Vol. 2 p. 292 &lt;br&gt;Internet Archives - https://archive.org/details/englishfolksongs00camp&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1917, indicating that Gospel Plow dates from at least the early twentieth century. The second reference is to a 1928 book, ''American Negro Folk-Songs'',&lt;ref&gt;White, N. L, American Negro Folk-Songs. Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1928. P115 &lt;br&gt;Google Books - https://books.google.com/books?id=WCuuV-kRe70C&amp;pg=PA31&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; which shows an African-American heritage for the original song.

== Lyricist(s) ==

The lyrics to the modern Civil Rights version of the song, "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" are often attributed to Alice Wine from [[Johns Island, South Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;previous unsubstantiated internet references to "lyrics by Mrs. Alice Wine":&lt;br&gt;
http://www.acousticmusicarchive.com/eyes-on-the-prize-chords-lyrics&lt;br&gt;
http://folkmusic.about.com/od/folksongs/qt/KeepYourEyes.htm&lt;br&gt;
http://raymondfolk.wikifoundry.com/page/Gospel+Songs&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. Wine was a member of the Moving Star Hall and the Progressive Club on Johns Island. The book ''Ain't You Got the Right to the Tree of Life'' by [[Guy Carawan|Guy and Candie Carawan]].&lt;ref&gt;Guy and Candie Carawan, ''Ain't You Got a Right to the Tree of Life?: The People of Johns Island South Carolina-Their Faces, Their Words, and Their Songs'', revised edition, University of Georgia Press (1994). 
&lt;br&gt;Original edition: Simon and Schuster, 1966
&lt;/ref&gt; documents songs of the Moving Star Hall and the lives of African Americans on Johns Island in the early sixties.

It is doubtful that Mrs. Wine actually composed the lyrics herself. More likely she had heard the revised refrain and variations on the verses of the older song from the congregation at the praise hall. The leading "Paul and Silas" stanzas in the modern "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" lyrics were already present in some versions of the older "Keep Your Hand on the Plow." ''Our Singing Country''&lt;ref name="Lomax" /&gt; shows these lyrics were already in use in 1949 and before. [[Odetta]] used them in her 1960 Carnegie Hall appearance and recording. Mrs Wine is credited by Candie Carawan only with having passed onto Guy Carawan the revision of the title from "Keep Your Hand on the Plow" to "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalstudio.ucr.edu/studio_projects/carawan/seaislands3.html University of California Digitial Studio Archives.]&lt;br&gt;
Also email from Candie Carawan to Johns Island Schoolhouse Museum, February 15, 2013, re. ''Tree of Life Exhibit'':&lt;br&gt;‘There is one thing we would like to correct on the panel of Alice Wine at the Progressive Club. It is not accurate to say that she is credited with writing the lyrics to "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize." She is credited with passing the phrase "eyes on the prize" to Guy who then incorporated it into the song. When Guy worked with Mrs. [[Septima Clark|Clark]] in the Citizenship program on Johns Island, he used songs in the classes. One of the songs was "Keep Your Hand on the Plow, Hold On" which he knew from the Labor Movement. Mrs. Wine took him aside and said "We know a different echo to that song --keep your eyes on the prize, hold on." Guy loved that and began to use it as he traveled around the South and met with groups at [[Highlander Folk School|Highlander]]. Later on Mrs. Wine found it hard to believe that she had made such an impact on the song.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lyrics for traditional American folk songs and African-American spirituals are often changed, improvised and traded between songs by different artists and at different performances. This was and is especially true in the call and response of African American religious music. For example, [[Mahalia Jackson]], in her 1958 performance of "Keep Your Hand on the Plow", begins with the couplet "''Mary had three links of chain, Every link bearin' Jesus name''." [[Bob Dylan]] also sings these lyrics in his upbeat version of "Gospel Plow." [[Carl Sandburg]], in his 1927 book ''The American Songbag'',&lt;ref&gt;Sandburg Carl, The American Songbag, Harcourt, Brace and Company, New York, 1927. x p 474&lt;/ref&gt; attributes these lyrics to yet another song entirely, "Mary Wore Three Links of Chain." Modern choral arrangements of this song sound entirely different from either the Eyes-Prize or Hand-Plow songs.&lt;ref&gt;The San Joaquin Chorale. December 4th, 2011 at the 1st Congregational Church of Fresno, CA. Director, Roy Klassen.&lt;br&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQEe4t6mUoY&lt;/ref&gt; Both Sandberg in the preface to his book and folk singer [[Pete Seeger]] in the opening remarks to his [[We Shall Overcome (Pete Seeger album)|Carnegie Hall performance of "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize"]] note the malleability of American and African-American folk music. No one artist can be historically credited with "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize."

== Biblical references ==

The title of the modern song may be a reference to the [[Bible]] verse in [[Phillipians]] 3:17 "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A17-4%3A1&amp;version=NIV keep your eyes on those who live as we do]" and verse 14, "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+3%3A14&amp;version=NIV I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.]"

The "Gospel Plow" title is also shown as a reference to [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 9:62: "[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+9%3A62&amp;version=NIV%20 No one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God.]"

The "Paul and Silas" lyrics are clearly a Biblical reference to [[Acts]] 16:19-26. Here are the lyrics minus refrain:

Paul and Silas, bound in jail&lt;br&gt;
Had no money for to go their bail&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Paul and Silas began to shout&lt;br&gt;
Doors popped open, and all walked out&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Well, the only chains we can stand&lt;br&gt;
Are the chains between hand and hand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
----
And the biblical passages:
&lt;br&gt;
'''Acts 16:19-26''' &lt;br&gt;
[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A16-40&amp;version=NIV%20 New International Version]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
… they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to face the authorities. 20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are Jews, and are throwing our city into an uproar 21 by advocating customs unlawful for us Romans to accept or practice."&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
22 The crowd joined in the attack against Paul and Silas, and the magistrates ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods. 23 After they had been severely flogged, they were thrown into prison, and the jailer was commanded to guard them carefully. 24 When he received these orders, he put them in the inner cell and fastened their feet in the stocks.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. 26 Suddenly there was such a violent earthquake that the foundations of the prison were shaken. At once all the prison doors flew open, and everyone's chains came loose

'''Lahutā''' (Pali) is a [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] term translated as  "lightness", and it is the basis for the following pair of [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] within the Theravada Abhidharma teachings:
* ''Kāyalahutā'' - lightness of mental body (or lightness of cetisakas)
* ''Cittalahutā'' - lightness of consciousness (or lightness of citta)

These two mental factors have the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively.{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}

==Definition==
Bhikkhu Bodhi states:{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2012|loc=Kindle Locations 2364-2366}}
:The twofold lightness has the characteristic of the subsiding of heaviness (garubhāva) in the mental body and consciousness, respectively. Its function is to crush heaviness. It is manifested as non-sluggishness. Its proximate cause is the mental body and consciousness. It should be regarded as opposed to such defilements as sloth and torpor, which create heaviness.

Nina van Gorkom explains:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=225}}
:According to the ''Dhammasangani'' (par 42, 43) this pair of cetasikas consists in the absence of sluggishness and inertia, they have “alertness in varying”. The meaning of this will be clearer when we read what the ''Mula-Tīkā'' states about lightness of citta: “the capacity of the mind to turn very quickly to a wholesome object or to the contemplation of impermanence, etc.”

The ''[[Atthasālinī]]'' (I, Book I, Part IV, Chapter I, 30) states:{{sfn|van Gorkom|2010|p=226}}
: Kāya-lightness is buoyancy of mental factors; citta-lightness is buoyancy of consciousness. They have the characteristic of suppressing the heaviness of the one and the other; the function of crushing heaviness in both; the manifestation of opposition to sluggishness in both, and have mental factors and consciousness as proximate cause. They are the opponents of the corruptions, such as sloth and torpor, which cause heaviness and rigidity in mental factors and consciousness.

The '''''Legend of the Five Rings Roleplaying Game''''' is a [[role-playing game]] originally written by [[John Wick (role-playing game designer)|John Wick]] and published by [[Alderac Entertainment Group]], under license from [[Five Rings Publishing Group]], in 1997. The game uses the [[Legend of the Five Rings]] setting, and primarily the nation of [[Rokugan]], which is based on [[feudal]] [[Japan]] with influences from other East Asian cultures.

Like most role-playing games, Legend of the Five Rings is played by one or more players and a [[game master]], who controls the events that happen during the game as well as the [[non-player characters]] (NPCs). ''Legend of the Five Rings'' features many [[courtiers]] and other [[non-combatant]] character types as valid player characters.

In 1998, Legend of the Five Rings won the [[Origins Award]] for ''Best Roleplaying Game of 1997''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners |title=Origins Award Winners (1997) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331064621/http://www.originsgamefair.com/awards/1997/list-of-winners |archivedate=2008-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the L5R RPG 3rd Edition sourcebook Emerald Empire won the Scrye Players Choice Award.

In September 2015, AEG and [[Fantasy Flight Games]] jointly announced that the intellectual property had been sold to FFG.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/9/11/a-new-emperor-rises/&lt;/ref&gt; A fifth edition of the role-playing game released in October, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/9/26/legend-of-the-five-rings-rpg-beta/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Setting (fiction)|fictional setting]] of ''Legend of the Five Rings'' is similar to [[feudal]] [[Japan]], though it also includes aspects of other [[Asia]]n cultures, as well as [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] and [[mythology|myth]]ical beasts.  There is no given name for the entire world which the setting describes, so "Rokugan" is used alternately to refer to the specific nation within the setting or to refer to the entire world.

Rokugani society is based on a [[clan]] structure, with seven (and later eight) so-called "Great Clans", as well as a number of minor clans.  Great Clans are made up of several family lines, each with their own general purpose within the clan.  Minor clans generally only have one family.  Each clan also has areas of land bequeathed by the emperor under their control.  The emperor retains ownership of all lands, however, and the clans essentially rent the lands by paying annual taxes.

==System==
The [[role-playing game system|game system]] of ''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses [[10-sided dice]] exclusively. Usually, when a die is rolled and the result is 10 (normally marked '0' on the die), the die is said to "explode".  In this situation, the player rolls again and the new result is added to the original result. If this second result is a 10, the player rolls a third time, totaling all three results.  This process is repeated until the player rolls something other than 10. The second edition and most books made for it were written to work both with this system and with [[D20 rules]] as presented in the [[Oriental Adventures|Oriental Adventures D&amp;D setting]]; this was discontinued after 3rd edition was published.

===Roll &amp; Keep===
The mechanic for which the game is most widely known is the "Roll &amp; Keep" system, designed by Dave Williams and [[John Wick (role-playing game designer)|John Wick]].  When dice are rolled, there are two quantities given: a number of dice to be rolled and a number of dice to be "kept".  The totals of the kept dice are added together, giving the player the total sum for his or her roll.  For example, if a roll called for five dice to be rolled and three kept (said simply "five keep three" or written "5k3"), five dice would be rolled.  Out of those five, the player would choose three (generally, but not necessarily, the player would choose the three with the highest values) whose values would be added together for the total value of the roll.

===Rings===
''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses eight [[Statistic (role-playing games)|traits]]: [[Endurance|Stamina]], [[Volition (psychology)|Willpower]], [[physical strength|Strength]], [[Perception]], [[Agility]], [[Intelligence (trait)|Intelligence]], [[Reflexes]], and [[Awareness]].  The Traits are grouped into pairs associated with four elemental "Rings" (respectively to above): [[Earth]], [[Water]], [[Fire]] and [[Air]].  The four Rings represent a limitation in character development, because in order for a character to advance, the level of his Rings must increase, and to increase a character’s Rings, both of the Ring’s associated Traits must increase.

There is a fifth Ring, called [[The Book of Five Rings#The Book of Void|Void]].  This ring, like the other four, is taken from [[Miyamoto Musashi]]'s ''[[The Book of Five Rings]]'', although "Nothingness" is a better translation of the text.  In the game, Void represents a character’s inner strength, and its use allows a character to perform extraordinary actions, or to perform normal actions more efficiently.

===Character creation===
There are primarily two methods of creating characters in role-playing games: to roll dice to randomly generate attributes or to begin with a set number of points and a formula by which attributes can be purchased with these points.  ''Legend of the Five Rings'' uses the latter method.  Each new character begins with 40 "Character Points" to spend to create the character (except for [[ronin]] characters, which begin with 55). These points are spent to raise the level of the character’s [[#Rings|Traits and Void Ring]], to raise the level of the character’s skills, and to purchase new skills. In previous versions of the game, characters started with 30 points, or 45 for ronin.

These points may also be used to purchase ''Advantages'', which give the character some extra bonus or ability that is designed to help in certain situations (such as "Large", which increases the damage a character can inflict, or "Social Position", which increases that character’s standing in the courts of the land).  Conversely, if a player so chooses, he can select a number of Disadvantages for his character, which give extra Character Points to spend in other areas, but imposes some penalty on the character during play (such as "Small", which decreases the damage the character can inflict with certain weapons, or "Bad Reputation", which causes a great number of NPCs to dislike the character).

===Lethality===
The Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game is renowned for its lethality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alderac.com/l5r/files/2012/03/L5R-Free-RPG-Day.pdf|title=Legacy of Disaster pg.5 sidebar|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020739/http://www.alderac.com/l5r/files/2012/03/L5R-Free-RPG-Day.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players who charge into combat unaware will often find their characters killed in the first session. Proper role-playing is encouraged to avoid combat when unnecessary, but the characters do have requisite abilities to survive if combat is forced in the early stages.

==''Oriental Adventures''==
''[[Oriental Adventures]]'' was published originally in 1985 by [[TSR, Inc.]] as an expansion for ''[[Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' and was set in a land called [[Kara-Tur]]. In 2001, [[Wizards of the Coast]] released a new edition of ''Oriental Adventures'' as an expansion for the third edition of [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]. It was decided to make this new version of ''Oriental Adventures'' a showcase for their recently acquired ''Legend of the Five Rings''. An official (but not 100% comprehensive) update of Oriental Adventures to the v.3.5 rules can be found in Dragon Magazine #318 (April 2004), pp. 32-48. 

For the entirety of its Second Edition, with the exception of the ''Player's Guide'', ''Game Master's Guide'', ''Way of the Shadowlands'', ''Winter Court: Kyuden Asako'', and ''Time of the Void'', books published for the Legend of the Five Rings RPG had two different sets of game mechanics: the mechanics from the ''Legend of the Five Rings Second Edition Player's Guide'' and corresponding mechanics for [[d20 System]], such as those presented in ''Oriental Adventures''. Beginning with the Third Edition of the Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game, and because of the lack of availability of the now out of print ''Oriental Adventures'', the d20 System rules have been dropped from current Legend of the Five Rings Role-Playing Game books.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6146">In [[economic theory]], the '''money pump argument''' is a [[thought experiment]] intended to show that rational behavior requires transitive preferences: If one prefers A to B and B to C, then one should not prefer C to A. Standard economic theory assumes that preferences are transitive.

However, many people have argued that intransitive preferences are quite common, and often observed in real world settings. A cognitive bias is called the [[focusing effect]]: people focus on one characteristic which stands out in order to make decisions In choosing potential mates, candidate A is more beautiful/handsome than candidate B. B is wealthier then C. C is far better attuned on a personal level than A – the hearts meet. Then choices could be intransitive because instead of evaluating the whole package, people focus on one characteristic which distinguishes between two candidates to make decisions.&lt;ref name="HanssonGrüne-Yanoff2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hansson|first1=Sven Ove|last2=Grüne-Yanoff|first2=Till|year=2012|title=Preferences|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|editor=Edward N. Zalta|edition=Winter 2012|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/preferences/|at=sec. 1.3 Transitivity|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- The last sentence above really should be expanded into a summary of the content of the article referenced, rather than saying "go read this" (that is what we have "See Also" and "External Links" sections for. Such information would definitely be relevant and would improve this page. --&gt;

==Example==
The original example of the Money Pump was published by Davidson, McKinsey and Suppes in 1955. It was based on gambling games. In their example, there are two "tickets", each of which entitles the bearer to play a gambling game once. Any money paid to obtain the ticket does not count towards the stake for the game. An example of the type of tickets available are:

* Ticket A gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 50:50 chance of winning $5.
* Ticket B gives a chance to play a game where you stake $1 for a 1:20 chance of winning $100.

McKinsey and Suppes found that most players would rate the ticket with the higher chance of winning (A) as more desirable, but the ticket with the higher prize (B) as more valuable, thus representing intransitive preferences. This would theoretically allow a "money pump" to operate as follows:

* The operator offers the customer a chance to buy ticket B at a fairly negotiated price, P.
* The operator then offers the customer ticket A in exchange for ticket B, on the grounds that they desire it more.
* The operator then offers to buy ticket A back for a fairly negotiated price, P'. Since A is considered less valuable than B, P' should be less than P. But after all these transactions, all that has happened is that (P-P') dollars have been transferred from the customer to the operator in exchange for ultimately nothing.

== Reactions ==
There are many counter-arguments which can be made to this. One of the simplest was made by Cubitt.&lt;ref name="CubitSugden2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cubit|first1=Robin|last2=Sugden|first2=Robert|title=On Money Pumps|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|location=Amsterdam|volume=37|issue=1|year=2001|pages=121–160|doi=10.1006/game.2000.0834|issn=0899-8256}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paper shows that the argument rests on some very strong assumptions and is tautological: to say that X acts as a money pump is no different from saying that X has intransitive preferences, and does not add anything to evidence for or against the existence of intransitive preferences.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

A second argument is more fundamental, and this rests on the possibility of [[incomparability]]. This differentiates between choice and preference. Forced to choose between A and B, I may choose A, yet the two may really not be comparable choices, thus we cannot conclude that I must have preferred A to B. See section on ''incommensurabilty''&lt;ref name="Andreou2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Andreou|first1=Chrisoula|year=2012|title=Dynamic Choice|journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Stanford University|editor=Edward N. Zalta|edition=Fall 2012|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2012/entries/dynamic-choice/|at=sec. 1.1 Incommensurable Alternatives|issn=1095-5054}}&lt;/ref&gt; in article on "Dynamic Choices" in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a more detailed discussion. If choices are not comparable, then again the money pump argument fails.
&lt;!-- Again the last sentence above really should be expanded into a summary of the content of the article referenced, rather than saying "go read this" (that is what we have "See Also" and "External Links" sections for. Such information would definitely be relevant and would improve this page. --&gt;

A more complex and sophisticated version of this argument occurs in the context of [[subjective probability]], where it is known as the [[Dutch book]] argument.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} There it is shown that rational behavior involves making choices over bets in such a way that they correspond to subjective probabilities. If someone fails to satisfy this condition (that is, fails to have subjective probabilities), then his preferences over lotteries will be intransitive and he can be made to act as a money pump. Thus the argument is used{{by whom|date=February 2016}} to justify the existence of subjective probabilities as a requirement for rational behavior. Again there are many possible counter-arguments.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

'''“Mowgli syndrome”''' is a term used by [[Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty|Wendy Doniger O’Flaherty]] in her 1995 book ''Other Peoples’ Myths: The Cave of Echoes'' to describe mythological figures who succeed in bridging the animal and human worlds to become one with nature, a human animal, only to become trapped between the two worlds, not completely animal yet not entirely human.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

It is also a rarely used descriptive term for so-called [[feral child]]ren; “Mowgli syndrome” is not a recognized psychological or physiological malady. The term originates from the character [[Mowgli]], a fictional feral child from [[Rudyard Kipling]]’s ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/893675823|title=The Medical Lives of History's Famous People|last=James|first=Maloney, William|publisher=|year=2014|isbn=9781608059362|location=|pages=136-139|oclc=893675823|quote=|via=http://ebooks.benthamscience.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5316">In mathematics, a '''nearly Kähler manifold''' is an [[almost Hermitian manifold]] &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;, with [[almost complex structure]] &lt;math&gt; J&lt;/math&gt;,
such that the (2,1)-tensor &lt;math&gt;\nabla J &lt;/math&gt; is [[skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]. So,

:&lt;math&gt; (\nabla_X J)X =0 &lt;/math&gt;

for every vector field &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, a [[Kähler manifold]] is nearly Kähler. The converse is not true. 
For example, the nearly Kähler six-sphere &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; is an example of a nearly Kähler manifold that is not Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;

Usually, non Kählerian nearly Kähler manifolds are called "strict nearly Kähler manifolds".

Nearly Kähler manifolds, also known as almost Tachibana manifolds, were studied by Shun-ichi Tachibana in 1959&lt;ref&gt;

For example, it was proved that any 6-dimensional strict nearly Kähler manifold is an [[Einstein manifold]] and has vanishing first Chern class
(in particular, this implies spin). 
In the 1980s, strict nearly Kähler manifolds obtained a lot of consideration because of their relation to [[Killing spinor|Killing
spinors]]: [[Thomas Friedrich (Mathematiker)|Thomas Friedrich]] and Ralf Grunewald showed that a 6-dimensional Riemannian manifold admits
a Riemannian Killing spinor if and only if it is nearly Kähler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

Phys. 154, 509–521. &lt;/ref&gt; by Christian B&amp;auml;r, who pointed out  that
these  are exactly the 6-manifolds for which the corresponding 7-dimensional Riemannian cone has holonomy G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

The only compact 6-manifolds known to admit strict nearly Kähler metrics are &lt;math&gt;S^6,\mathbb{C}\mathbb{P}^3, \mathbb{P}(T\mathbb{CP}_2)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;. Each of these admits such a unique nearly K&amp;auml;hler metric that is also homogeneous, and these examples are in fact  the only compact  homogeneous strictly nearly Kähler 6-manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

title= Classification of homogeneous nearly Kähler manifolds|

However, Foscolo and Haskins recently showed that &lt;math&gt;S^6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^3\times S^3&lt;/math&gt;  also admit strict nearly Kähler metrics that are not homogeneous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article| author = Foscolo, Lorenzo and Haskins, Mark | title = New G&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-holonomy cones and exotic nearly Kähler structures on S&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; and S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; x S&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; | journal = Ann. of Math. |series =  2 | volume = 185| year = 2017|number = 1 | pages = 59--130}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

B&amp;auml;r's observation about the  holonomy of Riemannian cones might seem to indicate that the nearly-Kähler condition is 
most natural and interesting in dimension 6.  This actually borne out by a theorem of  Nagy, who proved that any strict,  complete nearly Kähler manifold is locally a Riemannian product of homogeneous nearly Kähler spaces, twistor spaces over quaternion-Kähler manifolds, and 6-dimensional nearly Kähler manifolds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

Nearly Kähler manifolds are also an interesting class of manifolds admitting a metric connection with
parallel totally antisymmetric torsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|

Nearly Kähler manifolds should not be confused with  [[almost Kähler manifold|almost Kähler manifolds]].
An almost Kähler manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is an almost Hermitian manifold with a closed [[Kähler manifold|Kähler form]]:
&lt;math&gt;d\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;. The Kähler form or fundamental 2-form &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(X,Y) = g(JX,Y), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric on &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. The  nearly Kähler condition and the almost Kähler condition are essentially exclusive: an almost Hermitian manifold is both nearly Kähler and almost Kahler if and only if it is Kähler.

In [[quantum thermodynamics]], certain [[system (thermodynamics)|systems]] can achieve '''negative temperature'''; that is, their [[Thermodynamic temperature|temperature]] can be expressed as a [[negative number|negative]] quantity on the [[Kelvin]] or [[Rankine scale|Rankine]] scales.

A system with a truly negative temperature on the Kelvin scale is ''hotter'' than any system with a positive temperature.  If a negative-temperature system and a positive-temperature system come in contact, heat will flow from the negative- to the positive-temperature system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1956-07-01 |title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics at Negative Absolute Temperatures |journal=Physical Review |volume=103 |issue=1 |pages=20–28 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v103/p20 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.103.20|bibcode = 1956PhRv..103...20R |authorlink1=Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.|last1=Ramsey|first1=Norman }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1975-11-18 |title=Comment on: Negative Kelvin temperatures: some anomalies and a speculation |journal=American Journal of Physics |volume=44 |pages=994–995 |url=http://www.physique.usherbrooke.ca/~tremblay/articles/Comment%20on%20%27Negative%20Kelvin%20temperatures,%20Some%20anomalies%20and%20a%20speculation%27.%20Tremblay.pdf|doi=10.1119/1.10248|issue=10|bibcode = 1976AmJPh..44..994T|last1=Tremblay|first1=André-Marie }}&lt;/ref&gt; A standard example of such a system is [[population inversion]] in [[laser physics]].

[[Temperature]] is loosely interpreted as the average kinetic energy of the system's particles. The existence of negative temperature, let alone negative temperature representing "hotter" systems than positive temperature, would seem paradoxical in this interpretation.  
The paradox is resolved by considering the more rigorous definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] as the tradeoff between [[internal energy]] and [[entropy]]
contained in the system, with "[[thermodynamic beta|coldness]]", the ''reciprocal'' of temperature, being the more fundamental quantity.  
Systems with a positive temperature will increase in entropy as one adds energy to the system, while  
systems with a negative temperature will decrease in entropy as one adds energy to the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages= 10–14|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classical thermodynamic systems cannot achieve negative temperatures: adding [[heat]] always increases their [[entropy]].  
The possibility of a decrease in entropy as energy increases requires the system to "saturate" in entropy. This is only possible if the number of high energy states is limited. In classical [[Boltzmann statistics]], the number of high energy states is unlimited (particle speeds can in principle be increased indefinitely).
Systems bounded by a maximum amount of energy are generally forbidden in classical mechanics, and the phenomenon of negative temperature is strictly a 
[[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] phenomenon.  Some systems, however (see the [[#Examples|examples]] below), have a maximum amount of energy that they can hold, and as they approach that maximum energy their entropy actually begins to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Laws_of_Thermodynamics_A_Very_Short.html?id=-7aP0f5O2CMC|pages=  89–95|title=The Laws of Thermodynamics: A Very Short Introduction|isbn=978-0-19-957219-9|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|authorlink1=Peter Atkins|date=2010-03-25|publisher= Oxford University Press|oclc=467748903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition of temperature ==
The definition of [[thermodynamic temperature]] {{mvar|T}} as a function of the change in the system's [[entropy]]  {{mvar|S}}  under reversible [[heat transfer]] 
&lt;math&gt;Q_\mathrm{rev}&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;T = \frac{dQ_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}.&lt;/math&gt;
Entropy being a [[state function]], the integral of {{mvar|dS}} over any cyclical process is zero.
For a system in which the entropy is purely a function of the system's energy {{mvar|E}}, the temperature can be defined as:
: &lt;math&gt; T  = \left( \frac{dS}{dE} \right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

Equivalently, [[thermodynamic beta]], or "coldness", is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{kT} = \frac{1}{k} \frac{dS}{dE},&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|k}} is the [[Boltzmann constant]].

Note that in classical thermodynamics, {{mvar|S}} is defined in terms of temperature. This is reversed here, {{mvar|S}} is the [[statistical entropy]], a function of the possibly microstates of the system, and temperature conveys information on the distribution of energy levels among the possible microstates.
For systems with many degrees of freedom, the statistical and thermodynamic definitions of entropy are generally consistent with each other. 
However, for small systems and systems where the number of states decreases with energy, the definitions of statistical entropy and thermodynamic entropy are not necessarily consistent, and the temperatures derived from these entropies are different. 

Some theorists have proposed using an alternate definition of entropy originally proposed by Gibbs as a way to resolve these inconsistencies,&lt;ref name="DunkelHilbert"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Dunkel|first1 = Jorn|last2 = Hilbert|first2 = Stefan|title = Consistent thermostatistics forbids negative absolute temperatures|journal = Nature Physics|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 67|doi = 10.1038/nphys2815|arxiv = 1304.2066|bibcode = 2014NatPh..10...67D|year = 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this new definition would create other inconsistencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Gibbs, Boltzmann, and negative temperatures|journal = American Journal of Physics|date = 2015-02-01|issn = 0002-9505|pages = 163–170|volume = 83|issue = 2|doi = 10.1119/1.4895828|first = Daan|last = Frenkel|first2 = Patrick B.|last2 = Warren|arxiv = 1403.4299 |bibcode = 2015AmJPh..83..163F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Heat and molecular energy distribution ==
Negative temperatures can only exist in a system where there are a limited number of energy states (see below). As the temperature is increased on such a system, particles move into higher and higher energy states, and as the temperature increases, the number of particles in the lower energy states and in the higher energy states approaches equality.  (This is a consequence of the definition of temperature in [[statistical mechanics]] for systems with limited states.)  By injecting energy into these systems in the right fashion, it is possible to create a system in which there are more particles in the higher energy states than in the lower ones. The system can then be characterised as having a negative temperature.

A substance with a negative temperature is not colder than [[absolute zero]], but rather it is hotter than infinite temperature. As Kittel and Kroemer (p.&amp;nbsp;462) put it, "The temperature scale from cold to hot runs:

: +0 K, … , +300 K, … , +∞ K, −∞ K, … , −300 K, … , −0 K."

The corresponding inverse temperature scale, for the quantity ''β''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1/''kT'' (where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]]), runs continuously from low energy to high as +∞, … , 0, …, −∞. Because it avoids the abrupt jump from +∞ to −∞, β is considered more natural than ''T''.   Although a system can have multiple negative temperature regions and thus have -∞ to +∞ discontinuities.

In many familiar physical systems, temperature is associated to the kinetic energy of atoms. Since there is no upper bound on the momentum of an atom, there is no upper bound to the number of energy states available when more energy is added, and therefore no way to get to a negative temperature. However, in statistical mechanics, temperature can correspond to other degrees of freedom than just kinetic energy (see below).

== Temperature and disorder ==
The distribution of energy among the various [[translation (physics)|translational]], [[oscillation|vibrational]], [[rotation]]al, [[Electron configuration|electronic]], and [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] modes of a system determines the macroscopic temperature. In a "normal" system, thermal energy is constantly being exchanged between the various modes.

However, in some situations, it is possible to isolate one or more of the modes. In practice, the isolated modes still exchange energy with the other modes, but the [[Speed|time scale]] of this exchange is much slower than for the exchanges within the isolated mode. One example is the case of [[atomic nucleus|nuclear]] [[spin (physics)|spins]] in a strong external [[magnetic field]]. In this case, energy flows fairly rapidly among the spin states of interacting atoms, but energy transfer between the nuclear spins and other modes is relatively slow. Since the energy flow is predominantly within the spin system, it makes sense to think of a spin temperature that is distinct from the temperature associated to other modes.

A definition of [[Temperature#Second law of thermodynamics|temperature]] can be based on the relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;
T = \frac{dq_\mathrm{rev}}{dS}
&lt;/math&gt;

The relationship suggests that a ''positive temperature'' corresponds to the condition where [[entropy]], ''S'', increases as thermal energy, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;rev&lt;/sub&gt;, is added to the system. This is the "normal" condition in the macroscopic world, and is always the case for the translational, vibrational, rotational, and non-spin related electronic and nuclear modes. The reason for this is that there are an [[Infinity|infinite]] number of these types of modes, and adding more heat to the system increases the number of modes that are energetically accessible, and thus increases the entropy.

== Examples ==

=== Noninteracting two-level particles ===
{{multiple image

   | direction = vertical
   | footer    =

   | image2    = Negative temperature beta of E.png
   | width3    = 235
   | image3    = Negative temperature T of E.png
  }}
The simplest example, albeit a rather nonphysical one, is to consider a system of ''N'' particles, each of which can take an energy of either ''+ε'' or ''-ε'' but are otherwise noninteracting.  This can be understood as a limit of the [[Ising model]] in which the interaction term becomes negligible.  The total energy of the system is

:&lt;math&gt;E=\epsilon\sum_{i=1}^N \sigma_i = \epsilon \cdot j&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the sign of the ''i''th particle and ''j'' is the number of particles with positive energy minus the number of particles with [[negative energy]].  From elementary [[combinatorics]], the total number of [[microstate (statistical mechanics)|microstates]] with this amount of energy is a [[binomial coefficient]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\Omega_E=\binom{N}{(N+j)/2} = \frac{N!}{\left(\frac{N+j}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N - j}{2}\right)!}.&lt;/math&gt;

By the [[fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics]], the entropy of this [[microcanonical ensemble]] is

:&lt;math&gt;S=k_B \ln \Omega_E &lt;/math&gt;

We can solve for thermodynamic beta (β = 1/k&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;T) by considering it as a [[central difference]] without taking the continuum limit:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{k_B} \frac{\delta_{2\epsilon}[S]}{2\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} ( \ln \Omega_{E+\epsilon} - \ln \Omega_{E-\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{\left(\frac{N+j-1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j+1}{2}\right)!}{\left(\frac{N+j+1}{2}\right)! \left(\frac{N-j-1}{2}\right)!} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \frac{1}{2\epsilon} \ln \left( \frac{N-j+1}{N+j+1} \right).&lt;/math&gt;
hence the temperature

:&lt;math&gt;T(E)=\frac{2\epsilon}{k_B}\left[\ln \left( \frac{(N+1)\epsilon - E}{(N+1)\epsilon + E} \right)\right]^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This entire proof assumes the microcanonical ensemble with energy fixed and temperature being the emergent property.  In the [[canonical ensemble]], the temperature is fixed and energy is the emergent property.  This leads to (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; refers to microstates):
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \sum_{i=1}^N\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^N\epsilon_i\exp(-\epsilon_i \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(Z) + \frac{E}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
Following the previous example, we choose a state with two levels and two particles.  This leads to microstates &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_1  = 0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_2  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_3  = 1&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_4  = 2&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = \exp(-0 \beta) + 2\exp(-1 \beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z(T) = 1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{0\exp(-0 \beta) + 2*1\exp(-1 \beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{Z}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;E(T) = \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S(T) = k_b\ln(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta)) + \frac{2\exp(-\beta) + 2\exp(-2 \beta)}{(1 + 2\exp(-\beta) + \exp(-2 \beta))T}&lt;/math&gt;
The resulting values for &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; are all increasing with &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; and never need to enter a negative temperature regime.

=== Nuclear spins ===
The previous example is approximately realized by a system of nuclear spins in an external magnetic field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1951-01-15 |title=A Nuclear Spin System at Negative Temperature |journal=Physical Review |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=279–280 |url=http://link.aps.org/abstract/PR/v81/p279 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.81.279|bibcode = 1951PhRv...81..279P |authorlink1=Edward Mills Purcell |authorlink2=Robert Pound |last1=Purcell |first1=E.

In the case of electronic and nuclear spin systems, there are only a finite number of modes available, often just two, corresponding to [[spin (physics)#Properties of spin|spin up and spin down]]. In the absence of a [[magnetic field]], these spin states are ''degenerate'', meaning that they correspond to the same energy. When an external magnetic field is applied, the energy levels are split, since those spin states that are aligned with the magnetic field will have a different energy from those that are anti-parallel to it.

In the absence of a magnetic field, such a two-spin system would have maximum entropy when half the atoms are in the spin-up state and half  are in the spin-down state, and so one would expect to find the system with close to an equal distribution of spins. Upon application of a magnetic field, some of the atoms will tend to align so as to minimize the energy of the system, thus slightly more atoms should be in the lower-energy state (for the purposes of this example we will assume the spin-down state is the lower-energy state).  It is possible to add energy to the spin system using [[radio frequency]] (RF) techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramsey|first=Norman F.|authorlink=Norman Ramsey|title=Spectroscopy with coherent radiation: selected papers of Norman F. Ramsey with commentary|year=1998|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore; River Edge, N.J.|isbn= 9789810232504 |pages=417|oclc=38753008|series=World Scientific series in 20th century physics, v. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes atoms to ''flip'' from spin-down to spin-up.

Since we started with over half the atoms in the spin-down state, this initially drives the system towards a 50/50 mixture, so the entropy is increasing, corresponding to a positive temperature. However, at some point, more than half of the spins are in the spin-up position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Malcolm H.|title=Spin Dynamics: Basics of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex, England|isbn= 978-0-470-51117-6|pages=273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, adding additional energy reduces the entropy, since it moves the system further from a 50/50 mixture. This reduction in entropy with the addition of energy corresponds to a negative temperature.&lt;ref name="kylma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ltl.tkk.fi/triennial/positive.html |title=Positive and negative picokelvin temperatures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In NMR spectroscopy, this corresponds to pulses with a pulse width of over 180° (for a given spin). While relaxation is fast in solids, it can take several seconds in solutions and even longer in gases and in ultracold systems; several hours were reported for silver and rhodium at picokelvin temperatures.&lt;ref name="kylma" /&gt; It is still important to understand that the temperature is negative only with respect to nuclear spins. Other degrees of freedom, such as molecular vibrational, electronic and electron spin levels are at a positive temperature, so the object still has positive sensible heat. Relaxation actually happens by exchange of energy between the nuclear spin states and other states (e.g. through the [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] with other spins).

=== Lasers ===
This phenomenon can also be observed in many [[laser|lasing]] systems, wherein a large fraction of the system's [[atom]]s (for chemical and gas lasers) or [[electron]]s (in [[semiconductor]] lasers) are in excited states. This is referred to as a [[population inversion]].

The [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] for a single mode of a luminescent radiation field at frequency ''ν'' is
:&lt;math&gt;H=(h\nu - \mu)a^\dagger a. \, &lt;/math&gt;
The density operator in the [[grand canonical ensemble]] is
:&lt;math&gt;\rho=\frac{\exp(-\beta H)}{\mathbf{Tr}( \exp(-\beta H))}.&lt;/math&gt;
For the system to have a ground state, the trace to converge, and the density operator to be generally meaningful, ''βH'' must be positive semidefinite. So if ''hν''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''μ'', and ''H'' is negative semidefinite, then ''β'' must itself be negative, implying a negative temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Motional degrees of freedom ===
Negative temperatures have also been achieved in motional [[Degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]. Using an [[optical lattice]], upper bounds were placed on the kinetic energy, interaction energy and potential energy of cold {{SimpleNuclide|Potassium|39}} atoms. This was done by tuning the interactions of the atoms from repulsive to attractive using a [[Feshbach resonance]] and changing the overall harmonic potential from trapping to anti-trapping, thus transforming the [[Bose-Hubbard model|Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian]] from &lt;math&gt;\hat{H} \rightarrow -\hat{H}&lt;/math&gt;. Performing this transformation adiabatically while keeping the atoms in the [[Mott insulator]] regime, it is possible to go from a low entropy positive temperature state to a low entropy negative temperature state. In the negative temperature state, the atoms macroscopically occupy the maximum momentum state of the lattice. The negative temperature ensembles equilibrated and showed long lifetimes in an anti-trapping harmonic potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Braun | first1 = S. | last2 = Ronzheimer | first2 = J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3691">'''Negative transference''' is the [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] term for the [[transference]] of negative and hostile feelings, rather than positive ones, onto a therapist (or other emotional object).

==Freud's preference==
In his pioneering studies of transference phenomena, [[Freud]] noted the existence of both positive and negative transferences, while expressing a preference for the former, which he initially saw as a prerequisite for analytic work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Malcolm]], ''Psychoanalysis: The Impossible Profession'' (1988) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; Freud considered that "The hostile feelings make their appearance as a rule later than the affectionate ones and behind them";&lt;ref&gt;S. Freud, ''Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis'' (PFL 1) p. 495&lt;/ref&gt; and more frequently in same-sex than in mixed-sex analytic pairings.

[[Otto Fenichel]] pointed out that whereas neurotic aggravations can follow the emergence of a negative transference, so too (paradoxically) can improvements: the patient gets better to spite the therapist for emphasising the patient's problems.&lt;ref&gt;O. Fenichel, ''The Psychoanalytic Theory of Neurosis'' (1946) p. 559-60&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later formulations==
[[Melanie Klein]] in her disputes with [[Anna Freud]] laid much greater emphasis than her opponent on the constructive role to be played by interpreting the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;C. Frank, ''Melanie Klein in Berlin'' (2009) p. 33-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacques Lacan]] followed her theoretical lead in seeing "the [[Psychological projection|projection]] of what Melanie Klein calls ''bad internal objects''" as key to "the negative transference that is the initial knot of the analytic drama"&lt;ref&gt;J. Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997) p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt; - though he himself would face criticism for glossing over the negative transference in training analyses, to keep his analysands in dependence.&lt;ref&gt;D. Macey, Introduction, J. Lacan, ''The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psycho-Analysis'' (1994) p. xii&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. R. D. Fairbairn]] was also more interested in the negative than the positive transference, which he saw as a key to the [[Repetition compulsion|repetition]] and exposure of unconscious attachments to internalised bad objects.&lt;ref&gt;M. Stark, ''Working with Resistance'' (2002) p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; In his wake, [[object relations theory|object relations theorists]] have tended to stress the positive results that can emerge from working with the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1990) p. 112-3&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical blocks==
* [[Fritz Wittels]] considered the brevity of [[Wilhelm Stekel]]'s analyses to be due to his [[narcissism]] being unable to endure the emergence of the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;E. Timms ed., ''Freud and the Child Woman'' (1995) p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Rollo May]] saw the flaw in [[person-centered therapy]] as a pervasive reluctance to deal with the negative transference.&lt;ref&gt;B. Thorn, ''Carl Rogers'' (1992) p. 72&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary analogues==
Describing the process of becoming the focus of a paranoid's hostility, [[C. P. Snow]] wrote:

"No one likes being hated: most of us are afraid of it: it jars to the bone when we meet hatred face to face."&lt;ref&gt;C. P. Snow, ''Corridors of Power'' (1975) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In physics, the '''Newtonian dynamics''' is understood as the [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of a particle or a small body according to [[Newton's laws of motion]].

==Mathematical generalizations==
Typically, the '''Newtonian dynamics''' occurs in a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]], which is flat. However, in mathematics [[Newton's laws of motion]] can be generalized to multidimensional and [[curved space|curved]] spaces. Often the term '''Newtonian dynamics''' is narrowed to [[Newton's second law]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m\,\mathbf a=\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt;.

==Newton's second law in a multidimensional space==
Let's consider &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N&lt;/math&gt; particles with masses &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_1,\,\ldots,\,m_N&lt;/math&gt; in the regular three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \mathbf r_1,\,\ldots,\,\mathbf r_N&lt;/math&gt; be their radius-vectors in some [[inertial]] coordinate system. Then the motion of these particles is governed by Newton's second law applied to each of them
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\mathbf r_i}{dt}=\mathbf v_i,\qquad\frac{d\mathbf v_i}{dt}=\frac{\mathbf F_i(\mathbf r_1,\ldots,\mathbf r_N,\mathbf v_1,\ldots,\mathbf v_N,t)}{m_i},\quad i=1,\ldots,N. 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
The three-dimensional radius-vectors &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf r_1,\,\ldots,\,\mathbf r_N&lt;/math&gt; can be built into a single &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=3N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional radius-vector. Similarly, three-dimensional velocity vectors &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf v_1,\,\ldots,\,\mathbf v_N&lt;/math&gt; can be built into a single &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=3N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional velocity vector:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf r=\begin{Vmatrix}
\mathbf r_1\\ \vdots\\ \mathbf r_N\end{Vmatrix},\qquad\qquad
\mathbf v=\begin{Vmatrix}
\mathbf v_1\\ \vdots\\ \mathbf v_N\end{Vmatrix}.
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
In terms of the multidimensional vectors ({{EquationNote|2}}) the equations ({{EquationNote|1}}) are written as 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{d\mathbf r}{dt}=\mathbf v,\qquad\frac{d\mathbf v}{dt}=\mathbf F(\mathbf r,\mathbf v,t), 
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|3}}}}
i.e. they take the form of Newton's second law applied to a single particle with the unit mass &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m=1&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Definition'''. The equations ({{EquationNote|3}}) are called the
equations of a '''Newtonian [[dynamical system]]''' in a flat multidimensional [[Euclidean space]], which is called the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] of this system. Its points are marked by the radius-vector 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt;. The space whose points are marked by the pair of vectors &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(\mathbf r,\mathbf v)&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[phase space]] of the dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}).

==Euclidean structure==
The configuration space and the phase space of the dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}) both are Euclidean spaces, i. e. they are equipped with a [[Euclidean space#Euclidean structure|Euclidean structure]]. The
Euclidean structure of them is defined so that the [[kinetic energy]] of the single multidimensional particle with the unit mass &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m=1&lt;/math&gt; is equal to the sum of kinetic energies of the three-dimensional particles with the masses &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_1,\,\ldots,\,m_N&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T=\frac{\Vert\mathbf v\Vert^2}{2}=\sum^N_{i=1}m_i\,\frac{\Vert\mathbf v_i\Vert^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|4}}}}

==Constraints and internal coordinates==
In some cases the motion of the particles with the masses &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle m_1,\,\ldots,\,m_N&lt;/math&gt; can be constrained. Typical [[constraint algorithm|constraints]] look like scalar equations of the form 
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\varphi_i(\mathbf r_1,\ldots,\mathbf r_N)=0,\quad i=1,\,\ldots,\,K&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|5}}}}
Constraints of the form ({{EquationNote|5}}) are called [[Holonomic constraints|holonomic]] and [[Scleronomous|scleronomic]]. In terms of the radius-vector &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; of the Newtonian dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}) they are written as
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\varphi_i(\mathbf r)=0,\quad i=1,\,\ldots,\,K&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|6}}}}
Each such constraint reduces by one the number of degrees of freedom of the Newtonian dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}). Therefore the constrained system has &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n=3\,N-K&lt;/math&gt; degrees of freedom.

'''Definition'''. The constraint equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) define an &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[manifold]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt; within the configuration space of the Newtonian dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}). This manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt; is called the configuration space of the constrained system. Its tangent bundle &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle TM&lt;/math&gt; is called the phase space of the constrained system.

Let &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q^1,\,\ldots,\,q^n&lt;/math&gt; be the internal coordinates of a point of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. Their usage is typical for the [[Lagrangian mechanics]]. The radius-vector &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf r&lt;/math&gt; is expressed as some definite function of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q^1,\,\ldots,\,q^n&lt;/math&gt;:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf r=\mathbf r(q^1,\,\ldots,\,q^n)
&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|7}}}}
The vector-function ({{EquationNote|7}}) resolves the constraint equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) in the sense that upon substituting ({{EquationNote|7}}) into ({{EquationNote|6}}) the equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) are fulfilled identically in &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q^1,\,\ldots,\,q^n&lt;/math&gt;.

==Internal presentation of the velocity vector==
The velocity vector of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system is expressed in terms of the partial derivatives of the vector-function
({{EquationNote|7}}):
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf v=\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial q^i}\,\dot q^i
&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|8}}}}
The quantities &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\dot q^1,\,\ldots,\,\dot q^n&lt;/math&gt; are called internal components of the velocity vector. Sometimes they are denoted with the use of a separate symbol
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\dot q^i=w^i,\qquad i=1,\,\ldots,\,n
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|9}}}}
and then treated as independent variables. The quantities
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle q^1,\,\ldots,\,q^n,\,w^1,\,\ldots,\,w^n
&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|10}}}}
are used as internal coordinates of a point of the phase space &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle TM&lt;/math&gt; of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system.

==Embedding and the induced Riemannian metric==
Geometrically, the vector-function ({{EquationNote|7}}) implements an embedding of the configuration space &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt; of the constrained Newtonian dynamical system into the &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 3\,N&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional flat comfiguration space of the unconstrained 
Newtonian dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}). Due to this embedding the Euclidean structure of the ambient space induces the Riemannian metric onto the manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. The components of the [[metric tensor]] of this induced metric are given by the formula
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle g_{ij}=\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial q^i},\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial q^j}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;,|{{EquationRef|11}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle(\ ,\ )&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar product associated with the Euclidean structure ({{EquationNote|4}}).

==Kinetic energy of a constrained Newtonian dynamical system==
Since the Euclidean structure of an unconstrained system of &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N&lt;/math&gt; particles is entroduced through their kinetic energy, the induced Riemannian structure on the configuration space &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle N&lt;/math&gt; of a constrained system preserves this relation to the kinetic energy:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
T=\frac{1}{2}\sum^n_{i=1}\sum^n_{j=1}g_{ij}\,w^i\,w^j&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|12}}}}
The formula ({{EquationNote|12}}) is derived by substituting ({{EquationNote|8}}) into ({{EquationNote|4}}) and taking into account ({{EquationNote|11}}).

==Constraint forces==

For a constrained Newtonian dynamical system the constraints described by the equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) are usually implemented by some mechanical framework. This framework produces some auxiliary forces including the force that maintains the system within its configuration manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. Such a maintaining force is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. It is called the [[normal force]]. The force &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf F&lt;/math&gt; from ({{EquationNote|6}}) is subdivided into two components
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf F=\mathbf F_\parallel+\mathbf F_\perp&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|13}}}}
The first component in ({{EquationNote|13}}) is tangent to the configuration manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. The second component is perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt;. In coincides with the [[normal force]] &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Like the velocity vector ({{EquationNote|8}}), the tangent force 
&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf F_\parallel&lt;/math&gt; has its internal presentation
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\mathbf F_\parallel=\sum^n_{i=1}\frac{\partial\mathbf r}{\partial q^i}\,F^i&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|14}}}}
The quantities &lt;math&gt;F^1,\,\ldots,\,F^n&lt;/math&gt; in ({{EquationNote|14}}) are called the internal components of the force vector.

==Newton's second law in a curved space==
The Newtonian dynamical system ({{EquationNote|3}}) constrained to the configuration manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt; by the constraint equations ({{EquationNote|6}}) is described by the differential equations
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dq^s}{dt}=w^s,\qquad\frac{d w^s}{dt}+\sum^n_{i=1}\sum^n_{j=1}\Gamma^s_{ij}\,w^i\,w^j=F^s,\qquad s=1,\,\ldots,\,n&lt;/math&gt;,|{{EquationRef|15}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^s_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Christoffel symbols]] of the [[metric connection]] produced by the Riemannian metric ({{EquationNote|11}}).

==Relation to Lagrange equations==
Mechanical systems with constraints are usually described by [[Lagrangian mechanics#Lagrange equations of the second kind|Lagrange equations]]:
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
\frac{dq^s}{dt}=w^s,\qquad\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial w^s}\right)-\frac{\partial T}{\partial q^s}=Q_s,\qquad s=1,\,\ldots,\,n&lt;/math&gt;,|{{EquationRef|16}}}}
where &lt;math&gt;T=T(q^1,\ldots,q^n,w^1,\ldots,w^n)&lt;/math&gt; is the kinetic energy the constrained dynamical system given by the formula ({{EquationNote|12}}). The quantities &lt;math&gt;Q_1,\,\ldots,\,Q_n&lt;/math&gt; in 
({{EquationNote|16}}) are the inner [[tensor#Tensor valence|covariant components]] of the tangent force vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_\parallel&lt;/math&gt; (see ({{EquationNote|13}}) and ({{EquationNote|14}})). They are produced from the inner [[tensor#Tensor valence|contravariant components]] &lt;math&gt;F^1,\,\ldots,\,F^n&lt;/math&gt; of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf F_\parallel&lt;/math&gt; by means of the standard [[raising and lowering indices|index lowering procedure]] using the metric ({{EquationNote|11}}):
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
Q_s=\sum^n_{r=1}g_{sr}\,F^r,\qquad s=1,\,\ldots,\,n&lt;/math&gt;,|{{EquationRef|17}}}}
The equations ({{EquationNote|16}}) are equivalent to the equations ({{EquationNote|15}}). However, the metric ({{EquationNote|11}}) and
other geometric features of the configuration manifold &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle M&lt;/math&gt; are not explicit in ({{EquationNote|16}}). The metric ({{EquationNote|11}}) can be recovered from the kinetic energy &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle T&lt;/math&gt; by means of the formula
{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;
g_{ij}=\frac{\partial^2T}{\partial w^i\,\partial w^j}&lt;/math&gt;.|{{EquationRef|18}}}}

[[File:Rcs-gemini.jpg|thumb|right|Gemini Orbit Attitude and Maneuvring System location]]

The '''Orbit Attitude and Maneuvering System''' ('''OAMS''') was a [[reaction control system]] used in [[low Earth orbit|Earth orbit]] by the [[Project Gemini]] [[spacecraft]]. It provided both automatic and manual [[rotation]] and [[translation (geometry)|translation]] by means of 16 [[vernier thruster]]s using [[hypergolic]] propellants.

==Operations==
The OAMS had 16 small, fixed-position, fixed-thrust [[rocket engine]]s which burned [[hypergolic]] propellants ([[monomethylhydrazine]] fuel using [[nitrogen tetroxide]] as [[oxidizer]]) fed under pressure from a pair of tanks located in the aft Equipment Module. 
Besides providing [[attitude control]], the OAMS provided for linear up, down, sideways, forward or aft [[translation (physics)|translation]] of the spacecraft. This gave the spacecraft the capability to change its orbit, required for [[space rendezvous]] and [[docking and berthing of spacecraft|docking]] with another spacecraft, the [[Agena Target Vehicle]].
The system was also used to push the spacecraft away from the spent second stage of the [[Titan II GLV|Titan II launch vehicle]] on first reaching orbit.

*The eight rotational control engines were mounted off the spacecraft's [[center of mass]] around the aft section of the Equipment Module, pointed at 90 degree positions up, down, left and right. These were rated at {{convert|25|lbf|N}} thrust and fired in pairs, causing it to pitch, roll, or yaw to control attitude.
*Six of the translational control engines were mounted on the side of the Retrorocket Module, near the spacecraft's center of mass. Four of these were rated at {{convert|100|lbf|N}} thrust, one each pointed up, down, left or right. The other two were pointed forward, at the three o'clock and nine o'clock positions, to provide aft thrust. These were rated at {{convert|85|lbf|N}} (reduced from the original spec of {{convert|100|lbf|N}} in July 1962).
*The two {{convert|100|lbf|N|adj=on}} thrust forward translation control engines were mounted on the inside of the aft end of the equipment adapter, at the twelve o'clock and six o'clock positions.

[[Walter Schirra]] said that because there is no turbulence in space, on [[Gemini 6]] "I was amazed at my ability to maneuver. I did a fly-around inspection of [[Gemini 7]], literally flying rings around it, and I could move to within inches of it in perfect confidence".&lt;ref name="agle199809"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Agle |first=D.

==Events==
During [[Gemini 8]], on March 16, 1966, OAMS engine number 8 became stuck on, resulting in uncontrollable spinning of the spacecraft. The entire OAMS had to be shut down and the mission was terminated prematurely. This resulted in modifications to OAMS to permit engine isolation.

[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|The founder of phenomenology, [[Edmund Husserl]], identified the Other as one of the conceptual bases of [[intersubjectivity]], of the relations among people.]]

In [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], the terms '''the Other''' and '''the Constitutive Other''' identify the other human being, in their differences from the Self, as being a cumulative, constituting factor in the [[self-image]] of a person; as their acknowledgement of [[Reality|being real]]; hence, the Other is dissimilar to and the opposite of the Self, of Us, and of the Same.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Other", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition, (1999) p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitutive Other is the relation between the [[personality]] (essential nature) and the person (body) of a human being; it is the relation of [[Essentialism|essential]] and superficial characteristics of [[personal identity]] that corresponds to the relationship between opposite but correlative characteristics of the Self, because the difference is inner-difference, within the Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hegel, G. W. F.|author2=Miller, A.

The condition and quality of '''Otherness''', the characteristics of the Other, is the state of being different from and alien to the [[Identity (social science)|social identity]] of a person and to the [[identity (philosophy)|identity of the Self]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Miller, J.|url=http://www.sage-ereference.com/view/research/n304.xml|title=Otherness|website=The SAGE encyclopedia of qualitative research methods.|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|accessdate=27 January 2015|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=588–591|doi=10.4135/9781412963909.n304|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[discourse]] of philosophy, the term Otherness identifies and refers to the characteristics of ''Who?'' and ''What?'' of the Other, which are distinct and separate from [[the Symbolic]] order of things; from [[the Real]] (the authentic and unchangeable); from the [[Aesthetics|æsthetic]] ([[art]], [[beauty]], [[Taste (sociology)|taste]]); from [[political philosophy]]; from [[Norm (social)|social norm]]s and [[identity (social science)|social identity]]; and from the [[Self]]. Therefore, the condition of Otherness is a person's non-conformity to and with the social norms of society; and Otherness is the condition of [[disenfranchisement]] (political exclusion), effected either by the [[State (polity)|State]] or by the social institutions (e.g. the [[profession]]s) invested with the corresponding socio-political [[Power (social and political)|power]]. Therefore, the imposition of Otherness [[Social alienation|alienates]] the labelled person from the centre of society, and places him or her at the margins of society, for being the Other.&lt;ref&gt;"Otherness", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''Othering''' describes the reductive action of labeling a person as someone who belongs to a subordinate social category defined as the Other. The practice of Othering is the exclusion of persons who do not fit the norm of the [[social group]], which is a version of the Self.&lt;ref&gt;"Othering", ''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'', Third Edition (1999), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, in [[human geography]], to ''other'' an individual identifies and excludes them from the social group, placing them at the margins of society where social norms do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=328}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===European philosophy===
[[File:Hegel portrait by Schlesinger 1831.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The idealist philosopher G. W. F. Hegel introduced the concept of the Other as constituent part of human preoccupation with the Self.]]
[[File:Emmanuel Levinas.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The ethical philosopher Emmanuel Lévinas associated the concept of the Other with the ethical systems proposed in scripture and tradition.]]
The concept of the [[Self]] requires the existence of '''the Other''' as the counterpart entity required for '''defining the Self'''; in the late 18th century, [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] (1770–1831) introduced the concept of the Other as a constituent part of [[self-consciousness]] (preoccupation with the Self),&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 1, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; which complements the propositions about [[self-awareness]] (capacity for introspection) proffered by [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] (1762–1814).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (1967) Vol. 8, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807)

[[Edmund Husserl]] (1859–1938) applied the concept of the Other as a basis for [[intersubjectivity]], the psychological relations among people. In ''[[Cartesian Meditations: An Introduction to Phenomenology]]'' (1931), Husserl said that the Other is constituted as an ''alter ego'', as an other self. As such, the Other person posed and was an epistemological problem—of being only a perception of the consciousness of the Self.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

In ''[[Being and Nothingness|Being and Nothingness: An Essay on Phenomenological Ontology]]'' (1943), [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] (1905–1980) applied the dialectic of intersubjectivity to describe how the world is altered by the appearance of the Other, of how the world then appears to be oriented to the Other person, and not to the Self. The Other appears as a psychological phenomenon in the course of a person's life, and not as a radical threat to the [[existence]] of the Self. In that mode, in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949), [[Simone de Beauvoir]] (1908–1986) applied the concept of Otherness to Hegel's dialectic of the "[[Master–slave dialectic|Lord and Bondsman]]" (''Herrschaft und Knechtschaft'') and found it to be like the dialectic of the Man–Woman relationship, thus a true explanation for society's treatment and mistreatment of women.

===European psychology===
The psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) and the ethical philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]] (1906–1995) established the contemporary definitions, usages, and applications of the Other, as the radical counterpart of the Self. Lacan associated the Other with language and with [[The Symbolic|the symbolic order]] of things. Levinas associated the Other with the ethical metaphysics of [[scripture]] and [[tradition]]; the ethical proposition is that the Other is superior and prior to the Self.

In the event, Levinas re-formulated the [[Face-to-face (philosophy)|face-to-face]] encounter (wherein a person is responsible to the Other person) to include the propositions of [[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) about the impossibility of the Other (person) being an entirely [[metaphysics of presence|metaphysical pure-presence]]. That the Other could be an entity of pure Otherness (of [[alterity]]) personified in a [[Representation (arts)|representation]] created and depicted with language that identifies, describes, and classifies. The conceptual re-formulation of the nature of the Other also included Levinas's analysis of the distinction between "[[the saying and the said]]"; nonetheless, the nature of the Other retained the priority of [[ethics]] over [[metaphysics]].

In the psychology of the mind (e.g. [[R. D. Laing]]), the Other identifies and refers to [[The unconscious|the unconscious mind]], to [[silence]], to [[insanity]], and to language ("to what is referred and to what is unsaid").&lt;ref&gt;''The New Fontana Dictionary of Modern Thought'' (1999 )p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, in such psychologic and analytic usages, there might arise a tendency to [[relativism]] if the Other person (as a being of pure, abstract alterity) leads to ignoring the commonality of [[truth]]. Likewise, problems arise from unethical usages of the terms The Other, Otherness, and Othering to reinforce [[Ontology|ontological divisions]] of reality: of [[being]], of [[Becoming (philosophy)|becoming]], and of [[existence]].&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

===Levinas on ethics===
In ''[[Totality and Infinity|Totality and Infinity: An Essay on Exteriority]]'' (1961), Emmanuel Levinas said that previous philosophy had reduced the Other person to an object of consciousness, by not preserving its absolute ''[[alterity]]''—the innate condition of otherness, by which the Other radically transcends the Self and the totality of the human network into which the Other is being placed. As a challenge to self-assurance, the existence of the Other is a matter of ethics, because the ethical priority of the Other equals the primacy of ethics over ontology in real life.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"/&gt;

From that perspective, Levinas described the nature of the Other as "insomnia and wakefulness"; an [[Ecstasy (philosophy)|ecstasy]] (an exteriority) towards the Other that forever remains beyond any attempt at fully capturing the Other, whose Otherness is infinite; even in the murder of an Other, their Otherness remains uncontrolled and not negated. The infinity of the Other allowed Levinas to derive other aspects of philosophy and science as secondary to that ethic; thus:

{{quotation|The others that obsess me in the Other do not affect me as examples of the same [[genus]] united with my neighbor, by resemblance or common nature, [[individuation]]s of the human race, or chips off the old block ... The others concern me from the first. Here, fraternity precedes the commonness of a genus. My relationship with the Other as neighbor gives meaning to my relations with all the others. |''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'' (1974), p. 159.&lt;ref&gt;Levinas, Emmanuel. ''Otherwise than Being or Beyond Essence'', p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===More recent critical theory===
Derrida proposed that the absolute ''[[alterity]]'' of the Other is compromised because the Other is ''other than'' the Self and the group. That logical problem has especially negative consequences in the realm of human geography when the Other person is denied ethical priority in geopolitical discourse. Hence, the use of the language of Otherness in the anthropological discourse ([[Oriental Studies]]) about Western encounters with non–Western cultures preserves the dominantor–dominated discourse of [[hegemony]], just as misrepresenting the feminine as Other reasserts [[male privilege]] as primary in social discourse.&lt;ref name="Philosophy p. 637"&gt;''The Oxford Companion to Philosophy'' (1995) p. 637.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), the geographer [[Derek Gregory]] said that the responses of U.S. President George W. Bush (2001–2009) to the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 reinforced philosophic divisions of connotation and denotation that perpetuated the negative representation of the non-Western Other, when he rhetorically asked the U.S. populace ''Why do they hate us?'' as political prelude to the [[War on Terror]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

President Bush's rhetorical question led the U.S. populace to make an artificial, Us-and-Them division in the relations between the U.S. and the countries and cultures of the Middle East, which artifice is a basic factor of the perpetual war on [[terrorism]], and is a step away from eradicating the imaginary representations of the Self and the Other created with the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] geographies produced by [[Oriental Studies]]; about which the cultural critic [[Edward Saïd]] said that:

{{quotation|To build a conceptual framework around a notion of Us-versus-Them is, in effect, to pretend that the principal consideration is [[Epistemology|epistemological]] and natural—our civilization is known and accepted, theirs is different and strange—whereas, in fact, the framework separating us from them is belligerent, constructed, and situational.|''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Derek. ''The Colonial Present: Afghanistan, Palestine and Iraq'' (2004), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Imperialism and colonialism==
The contemporary, world system of [[Postcolonialism|post-colonial]], nation-states (with interdependent politics and economies) was preceded by the European imperial system of [[Colonialism|colonies]] (settler and economic) in which "the creation and maintenance of an unequal economic, cultural, and territorial relationship, usually between states, and often in the form of an empire, [was] based on [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]] and [[Hierarchy|subordination]]."&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, R.J., ''et al.'', ''The Dictionary of Human Geography'', 4th Edition Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 2000. p. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imperialist world system, political and economic affairs were fragmented, and the discrete empires "provided for most of their own needs ... [and disseminated] their influence solely through conquest [empire] or the threat of conquest [hegemony]."&lt;ref&gt;Gelvin, James L. ''The Modern Middle East: A History'', 2nd ed. Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. pp. 39–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Orientalism===
The imperial conquest of "non-white" countries was intellectually justified with the [[Fetishism|fetishization]] of the Eastern world, which was effected with cultural generalizations that divided the peoples of the world into the artificial, binary relationship of "The Eastern World and The Western World", the dichotomy which identified, designated, and subordinated the peoples of the Orient as the Other—as the non–European Self.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 27 January 2016|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of fetishization of people and things is a function of [[Orientalism]], which the colonialist ideologue realises with three actions: (i) Homogenization (all Oriental peoples are the same folk); (ii) Feminization (Oriental people are the lessers in the East–West binary relationship); and (iii) Essentialization (a people reduced to the artificial essence of universal, innate characteristics); thus, the praxis of Othering reduced to cultural inferiority the people, places, and things of the Eastern world, which then justified colonialism by establishing the West as the superior standard of culture.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Orientalism|last = Said|first = Edward|publisher = Patheon Books|year = 1978|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race ===
[[File:Scientific racism irish.jpg|thumb|right|Scientific racism of the Other: In the late-19th century, H. Strickland Constable justified anti-Irish racism among white people by claiming similarity between the cranial features of "the Irish-Iberian" man (left) and "the Negro" man (right), as proof that each man is racially inferior to the Anglo-Teutonic man (centre) possessed of the cranial ideal.]]

The practice of Othering was the prevalent cultural perspective of the European imperial powers, which was supported by the fabrications of [[scientific racism]], such as the pseudo-intellectual belief that the size of the cranium of the non–European Other was indicative of the inferior intelligence of the coloured peoples designated as the non-white Other.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Other|last = Mountz|first = Alison|date = 2009|journal = Key Concepts in Political Geography|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |page = 332}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, the United Nations officially declared that the differences among the races were insignificant in relation to the anthropological sameness among the peoples who are the human race. Despite the facts, in the U.S., the artificial distinctions against the Other remain, especially in government forms that ask a U.S. citizen to identify and place him or herself into a racial category, as in the questionnaires of the census bureau.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In practice of Othering, immigrants and refugees  are seen as "illegal immigrants" (from overseas) and "illegal aliens" (from Mexico).

===The subaltern native===
Maintaining an empire requires the [[Cultural imperialism|cultural subordination]] of the Other into the [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern native]] (the colonized people), which facilitates the exploitation of their labour, of their lands, and of the natural resources of their country as a colony of the motherland. To realise those ends, the process of Othering culturally justifies the domination and subordination of the native people, by placing them (as the Other) at the social periphery of the geopolitical enterprise that is colonial imperialism. The colonizer creates the Other with a false dichotomy of "native weakness" (social and political, cultural and economic) against the "colonial strength" of imperial [[Power (social and political)|power]], which can be resolved only with the ''[[noblesse oblige]]'' of racialism—the "moral responsibility" that psychologically authorizes the colonialist Self to unilaterally assume a [[civilizing mission]] to educate, convert, and culturally assimilate the Other into the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) pp. 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the praxis of [[colonialism]], the native populace constitute the Other whom the colonizers mean to dominate in order to civilise and save them in the course of exploiting the natural and human resources of the natives' homeland.&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"&gt;Mountz, A. (n.d.). ''The Other''. Key Concepts in Political Geography, pp. 328–338. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, a colony is a way to dominate and dispose of two groups of people (colonists and colonised) who can be used to define the Other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikiwash.metronews.ca/other/703349669-703223196|title=WikiWash|website=wikiwash.metronews.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of Othering establishes the unequal relationship between the native people and the colonizers, who believe themselves essentially superior to the natives whom they reduced to inhuman inferiority, as "the Other".&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"&gt;Colonialism. (n.d.). Dictionary of Human Geography, pp. 94–98. Retrieved 2 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The dehumanisation of colonialism—the colonist "Self" against the colonised "Other"—is maintained with the false binary-relations of [[Class (social)|social class]] and [[race (human categorization)|race]], of [[sex]] and [[gender]], and of [[nation]] and [[religion]].&lt;ref name="Mountz, A. 2016"/&gt; The proper, profitable functioning of a colony features continual protection of such cultural demarcations, which establish and enforce the socio-economic binary relation between "civilized man" (the colonist) and "savage man" (the colonial subaltern).&lt;ref name="Colonialism. 2016"/&gt;

==Sex and gender==
[[File:Simone de Beauvoir.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The existential philosopher Simone de Beauvoir applied the concept of The Other to the man–woman binary relation, in critical of the dominator–dominated relation, which historically characterised sexual inequality.]]

The existential philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[G. W. F. Hegel|Hegel]]'s conception of "the Other" (as a constituent part of [[Self-awareness|self-consciousness]]) to describe a male-dominated culture that represents Woman as the sexual Other in relation to Man. In the cultural context of the Man–Woman binary relation, the sexual Other is a [[minority (philosophy)|minority]], the least-favoured social group, usually the women of the community, because "a man represents both the positive and the neutral, as indicated by the common use of [the word] ''Man'' to designate human beings in general; whereas [the word] ''Woman'' represents only the negative, defined by limiting criteria, without reciprocity" from the first sex, from Man.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949)

In 1957, [[Betty Friedan]] substantiated the ordinate–subordinate nature of the Man–Woman sexual relation as social identity. When queried about their post-graduate lives, the majority of women interviewed, at a university-class reunion, used binary gender language, and referred to and identified themselves as their roles (wife, mother, manager) in the private sphere. They did not identify their own achievements (career, job, business) in the public sphere of life. Unawares, the women had conventionally automatically identified themselves as the social Other. Although the nature of the social Other is influenced by the society's social constructs ([[social class]], [[sex]], [[gender]]), as a human organisation, society holds the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] (social and political) to formally change the social relation between the male-defined Self and ''Woman'', the non-male Other.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger&lt;/ref&gt; See: ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' (1963)

The [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]] [[Cheshire Calhoun]] deconstructed the concept of "the Other" as the female-half of the binary-gender relation of the "Man and Woman" concept. [[Deconstruction]] of the word ''Woman''—from subordinate in the "Man ''and'' Woman" relation—conceptually [[Reconstructivism|reconstructed]] the female Other as the Woman who exists independently of male definition ([[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]]); independent of the patriarchy who formally realise female subordination with binary-gender usages of the word ''Woman''.&lt;ref&gt;McCann, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sarojinisahoo.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), Prof. Sarojini Sahoo said that despite equality with men, women possess a discrete identity that is independent of the male definition of ''woman''.]]
In the essay "Feminism is Humanism. So Why the Debate?" (2012), the academic [[Sarojini Sahoo]], agrees with De Beauvoir's proposition that women can be free of social subordination by "thinking, taking action, working, creating, on the same terms as men; instead of seeking to disparage them, she declares herself their equal." Yet counters De Beauvoir that despite having the same human-being status as men, women have a unique sexual [[Gender identity|identity]] different from men. In feminist definition, Women are the Other (but not the Hegelian Other) and are not existentially defined by the demands of Man. Women are the social Other who unknowingly accept subjugation as part of [[subjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com|title=Sense &amp; Sensuality|website=sarojinisahoo.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the identity of woman is constitutionally different from the identity of man, as human beings, men and women are equal. Hence, the harm of Othering arises from the asymmetric nature of sex and gender roles, which arises accidentally and "passively" from natural and unavoidable [[intersubjectivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jemmer, Patrick. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YlN_kz8th4cC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=Sarojini+Sahoo&amp;ots=EFtjSxyA3q&amp;sig=qa7R The O(the)r (O)the(r)], Engage Newcastle Volume 1 ({{ISSN|2045-0567}}; {{ISBN|978-1-907926-00-6}}) August 2010, Newcastle UK: NewPhilSoc Publishing, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social-exclusion function of Othering a person or a social group from society, for being different from the norm (of the Self), is understood in the socio-economic functions of gender (a [[social construct]]) and sex (biological reality). In a society where heterosexuality is the social norm, "the Other" refers to and identifies the same-sex orientation, lesbians (women who love women) and gays (men who love men), people identified as "deviant" from the binary socio-sexual norm.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt; Negative usages of "the Other" are applied to the lesbian and gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities to diminish their social status and political power by social Othering to the margins of society. To neutralise Othering, LGBT communities ''queer'' a city, create social spaces, that use the city's spatial and temporal plans to allow the LGBT community free expression of [[social identity]] (i.e. a gay-pride parade); as such, ''queering'' is a political means for the sexual Other to establish their [[reality]] as part of the urban body politic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mountz|first1=Allison|title=The Other|journal=Key Concepts in Human Geography|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the production of [[knowledge]] about the Other, Michel Foucault and the [[Frankfurt School]] identified the process of '''Othering''' as everything to do with the creation and maintenance of imaginary representations—"knowledge of the Other"—in service to geopolitical [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Dominance hierarchy|domination]]. The [[Representation (arts)|representations]] of the Other (metaphoric, metonymic, anthropomorphic) are manifestations of the Western cultural attitudes inherent to the European historiographies of the non–European peoples labelled as "the Other". Using analytical discourses (academic and commercial, geopolitical and military) the [[dominant ideology]] of the colonialist culture explains the Eastern world to the Western world, using the binary relationship of the European Self confronting the non–European Other from overseas.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th-century [[Historiography|historiographies]] of the [[Orient]] as a place, European [[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] studied only what they argued was the [[high culture]]—the languages and literatures, the arts and philologies—of the Middle East as a cultural region, rather than as a geopolitical place inhabited by different peoples and societies.&lt;ref&gt;Rieder, John. ''Colonialism and the Emergence of Science Fiction '' (2008) p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; About such cultural misrepresentation, Saïd said that "the Orient that appears in Orientalism, then, is a system of representations framed by a whole set of forces that brought the Orient into Western learning, Western consciousness, and later, Western empire. If this definition of Orientalism seems more political than not, that is simply because I think Orientalism was, itself, a product of certain political forces and activities. Orientalism is a school of interpretation whose material happens to be the Orient, its civilisations, peoples, and localities. Its objective discoveries—the work of innumerable devoted scholars who edited texts and translated them, codified grammars, wrote dictionaries, reconstructed dead epochs, produced positivistically verifiable learning—are and always have been conditioned by the fact that its truths, like any truths delivered by language, are embodied in language, and, what is the truth of language?, Nietzsche once said, but":

{{quotation| A mobile army of [[metaphor]]s, [[metonym]]s, and [[anthropomorphism]]s—in short, a sum of human relations, which have been enhanced, transposed, and embellished poetically and rhetorically, and which, after long use, seem firm, canonical, and obligatory to a people: truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.|''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;ref name=Said&gt;Saïd, Edward W. ''Orientalism'', 25th Anniversary Ed. New York: Pantheon Books, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|202}}}}

Saïd concludes that Nietzsche's perspective might be too [[Nihilism|nihilistic]], but that it draws attention to the fact that, in so far as "the Orient" occurred in the [[Existentialism|existential]] awareness of the Western world, the Orient was a word that later accrued to it a wide field of meanings, associations, and connotations, which did not refer to the real Eastern world, but to the field of study surrounding "the Orient" as a word.&lt;ref&gt;''Orientalism'' (1978) pp. 202–203.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy===
In the Eastern world, the field of [[Occidentalism]], the investigation programme and academic curriculum of and about [[Essentialism|the essence]] of [[Western world|The West]]—i.e. geographic Europe as a culturally homogenous place—did not exist as a counterpart to Orientalism.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, Steven R. "The Historiography of the Modern Middle East: Transforming a Field of Study",  ''Middle East Historiographies: Narrating the Twentieth Century'', Israel Gershoni, Amy Singer, Y. Hakam Erdem, Eds. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2006. pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in the Orientalist practices of [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical negationism]], the writing of distorted history about the places and peoples of "The East" continue in the [[postmodern]] era, especially in contemporary journalism; e.g. in the Third World, political parties practice intra-national Othering with fabricated "facts", such as threat-reports about non-existent threats (political, social, military) that are meant to aggravate the character faults of the opponent political parties, which usually are composed of people from the social and ethnic groups identified and designated as the Other in that society.&lt;ref&gt;Sehgal, Meera. "Manufacturing a Feminized Siege Mentality." ''Journal of Contemporary Ethnography'' '''36''' (2) (2007): p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of Othering a person or a social group, by means of an ideal [[ethnocentricity]] (belief that one's ethnic group is the superior group), and the cultural tendency to evaluate and assign [[Meaning (psychology)|meaning]] to Other ethnicities, which are negatively measured against the ideal standard of the Self—is realised through mundane methods of investigation, such as [[cartography]].&lt;ref name=Fellman&gt;Fellmann, Jerome D., et al. ''Human Geography: Landscapes of Human Activities'', 10th Ed. New York: McGraw-Hill, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|179}}

Historically, the drawing of maps emphasised and bolstered specific lands and the associated national-identities, the natural resources and cultures of the native inhabitants. In early cartography, the distortion (proportionate, proximate, and commercial) of actual places and true distances established the Western cartographer's [[Geopolitics|homeland]] as the centre of the ''mapamundi''; thus British cartographers centred Britain in their maps, and drew the British islands proportionally larger than the true geography might allow. In contemporary cartography, polar-perspective maps of the northern hemisphere, drawn by American cartographers, distort real geographic spatial relations (distance, size, mass) of and between the U.S. and Russia, to emphasise American superiority (military, cultural, geopolitical) and the inferiority of the Russian Other.&lt;ref name=Fellman/&gt;{{rp|10}}

===Practical perspectives===
In ''Key Concepts in Political Geography'' (2009), Alison Mountz proposed concrete definitions of the Other as a philosophic concept and term within the field of phenomenology; when used as a noun, the Other identifies and refers to a person and to a group of persons; when used as a verb, the Other identifies and refers to a category and a label for persons and things.

Post-colonial scholarship demonstrated that, in pursuit of empire, "the colonizing powers narrated an 'Other' whom they set out to save, dominate, control, [and] civilize ... [in order to] extract resources through colonization" of the homeland of the people labelled as the Other.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"&gt;Gallagher, Carolyn, Dahlman, Carl T, Gilmartin, Mary, Mountz, Alison, Shirlow, Peter. ''Key Concepts in Political Geography.'' SAGE Publications Ltd, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; As facilitated by [[Orientalism|Orientalist representations]] of the non–Western Other, [[Colonialism|colonisation]]—the economic exploitation of a people and their land—is misrepresented as being for the material, spiritual, and cultural benefit of the colonised peoples.

Counter to the post-colonial perspective of the Other as part of a Dominator–Dominated binary relationship, post-modern philosophy presents the Other and Otherness as [[wikt:phenomenology|phenomenological]] and [[Ontology|ontological]] progress for Man and society. Public knowledge of the [[social identity]] of peoples [[Social class|classified]] as "Outsiders" is ''de facto'' acknowledgement of their being [[reality|real]], and so they are part of the [[body politic]], especially in the cities. As such, "the post-modern city is a geographical celebration of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] that moves sites once conceived of as 'marginal' to the [social] centre of discussion and analysis" of the [[Intersubjectivity|human relations]] between the Outsiders and the Establishment.&lt;ref name="Gallagher, Carolyn 2009"/&gt;

{{alphabet}}
The '''Paleohispanic scripts''' are the writing systems created in the [[Iberian peninsula]] before the [[Latin alphabet]] became the dominant script. Most of them are unusual in that they are [[semi-syllabary|semi-syllabic]] rather than purely [[alphabetic]], despite having supposedly developed, in part, from the [[Phoenician alphabet]]. 

Paleohispanic scripts are known to have been used from the 5th century BCE — possibly from the 7th century, in the opinion of some researchers — until the end of the 1st century BCE or the beginning of the 1st century CE, and were the main scripts used to write the [[Paleohispanic languages]]. Some researchers conclude that their origin may lie solely with the Phoenician alphabet, while others believe the [[Greek alphabet]] may have had also a role.

==Scripts==
The Paleoiberian scripts are classified into three major groups: southern, northern, and Greco-Iberian, with differences both in the shapes of the glyphs and in their values. 

Inscriptions in the southern scripts have been found mainly in the southern half of the Iberian Peninsula. They represent only 5% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from right to left (like the Phoenician alphabet). They are:

* the [[Espanca script]] (known from a single tablet, and the only attestation of an alphabetical order);
* the Tartessian or [[Southwest script|Southwestern script]], also known as ''South Lusitanian''; 
* the [[Southeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Meridional''.

Inscriptions in the northern scripts have been found mainly in the NE of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. They represent 95% of the inscriptions found, and mostly read from left to right (like the Greek alphabet). They are:

* the [[Northeastern Iberian script]], also known as ''Levantine'';
** Dual variant
** Non-dual variant
* the [[Celtiberian script]]
**Western variant
**Eastern variant. 

The [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] was a direct adaptation of the Ionic variety of the [[Greek alphabet]], and only found  in a small region on the [[Mediterranean]] coast in the modern provinces of [[Alicante (province)|Alicante]] and [[Murcia (province)|Murcia]].

==Typology==
Excepting the Greco-Iberian alphabet, and to a lesser extent the Tartessian (southwestern) script, Paleoiberian scripts shared a distinctive [[Linguistic typology|typology]]:  They behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[plosive]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants. This unique [[writing system]] has been called a ''[[semi-syllabary]]''.

In the syllabic portions of the scripts, each plosive sign stood for a different combination of consonant and vowel, so that the written form of ''ga'' displayed no resemblance to ''ge'', and ''bi'' looked quite different from ''bo''. In addition, the original format did not distinguish [[voice (phonetics)|voiced from unvoiced]] plosives, so that ''ga'' stood for both /ga/ and /ka/, and ''da'' stood for both /da/ and /ta/. 

On the other hand, the continuants ([[fricative consonant|fricative]] sounds like /s/ and [[sonorant]]s like /l/, /m/, [[trill consonant|trills]], and vowels) were written with simple alphabetic letters, as in [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] and [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]. 

Over the past few decades, many researchers have come to believe that one variant of the [[northeastern Iberian script]], the older one according to the archaeological contexts, distinguished [[voice (phonetics)|voicing]] in the plosives by adding a stroke to the glyphs for the [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] (/d/~/t/) and [[velar consonant|velar]] (/g/~/k/) syllables, creating distinct glyphs for unvoiced /t/ and /k/, and restricting the original glyphs to voiced /d/ and /g/. (This is the so-called dual signary model: see [[northeastern Iberian script]].) If correct, this innovation would parallel the creation of the Latin letter G by the addition of a stroke to C, which had previously stood for both /k/ and /g/.

===Tartessian===

The [[Southwest script|Tartessian script]] is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic  semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a plosive was determined by the following vowel, as in a  semi-syllabary, the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. (See [[Tartessian language]] for an example.) This redundant typology re-emerged in a few late (2nd and 1st century BCE) texts of [[northeastern Iberian script|northeastern Iberian]] and [[Celtiberian script|Celtiberian]] scripts, where vowels were once again written after plosives. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, with essentially syllabic glyphs followed by the letter for the corresponding vowel; others treat it as a redundant alphabet, with the choice of an essentially consonantal character decided by the following vowel.&lt;ref name=Hoz&gt;''Hoz, Javier de (2005)]&lt;/ref&gt;

This is analogous to the [[Old Persian cuneiform script]], where vowels were most often written overtly but where consonants/syllables were decided by the vowel about half the time, and, to a very limited extent, to the [[Etruscan alphabet]], where most syllables based the consonant /k/ shared neither consonant nor vowel letter: Only the combinations CE, CI, KA, and QU were permitted. (This Etruscan convention is preserved in the English, not only in ''qu'' for ''queen,'' but also the letter names ''cee, kay, cue/qu''.)

== Origins ==

The paleoiberian semi-syllabaries clearly derive ultimately from an [[alphabet]] or alphabets circulating in the [[Mediterranean]], but it is not known whether that was the [[Phoenician alphabet]] alone, or if archaic varieties of the [[Greek alphabet]] also played a role. 

The only known full Paleoiberian signary, on the undated [[Espanca script|Espanca tablet]] (not completely readable, but clearly related to the southwestern and southeastern scripts), follows the Phoenician/Greek order for the first 13 of its 27 letters: Α Β Γ Δ Ι Κ Λ Μ Ν Ξ Π? {{lang|grc|ϻ}} Τ. The fact that southern paleohispanic /e/ appears to derive from the Phoenician letter ‘ayin, which gave rise to Greek Ο, while southern iberian /o/ derives from another letter or was perhaps invented,&lt;ref name=espanca&gt;[http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm Ramos, ''A Palæo-Iberian Alphabet: Espanca's Stele''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103082735/http://www.webpersonal.net/jrr/espanca_en.htm |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the development of vowels in paleoiberian semi-syllabaries was independent of the Greek innovation. However, the order of what appears to be /u/ directly after Τ, rather than at the place of {{lang|grc|Ϝ}}, has suggested to some researchers a Greek influence. (In addition, the letter for /e/ in northeast Iberian resembles Greek Ε rather than the southeast Iberian letter.) The two [[sibilants]], S and S', are attested, but there is one sign too few to account for a full 15-sign syllabary and all four of the letters M, M', R, and R' (not all of which can be positively identified with letters from the tablet), suggesting that one of ems or ars shown in the charts to the right is only a graphic variant. 

The obvious question about the origin and evolution of these scripts is how a purely alphabetic script was changed into, or perhaps unconsciously reinterpreted as, a partial syllabary. It may be instructive to consider an unrelated development in the evolution of the [[Etruscan alphabet]] from Greek: Greek had three letters, Γ, Κ, and {{lang|grc|Ϙ}}, whose sounds were not distinguished in Etruscan. Nonetheless, all three were borrowed, becoming the letters C, K, and Q. All were pronounced /k/, but they were restricted to appear before different vowels — CE, CI, KA, and QU, respectively, — so that the consonants carried almost as much weight in distinguishing these syllables as the vowels did. (This may have been an attempt to overtly indicate the vowel-dependent [[allophony]] of Etruscan /k/ with the extra Greek letters that were available.) When the Etruscan alphabet was later adapted to [[Latin]], the letter C stood for both /k/ and /g/, as Etruscan had had no /g/ sound to maintain the original sound value of Greek Г. (Later a stroke was added to C, creating the new Latin letter G.). 

Something similar may have happened during the evolution of the Paleoiberian scripts. If writing passed from the Phoenicians through the Tartessians, and the [[Tartessian language]] did not have a /g/ or a /d/, that would explain the absence of a distinction between /g/ and /k/, /d/ and /t/ in the southeastern Iberian and later northeast Iberian scripts, despite it being clear that these were distinct sounds in the [[Iberian language]], as is clearly attested in the [[Greco-Iberian alphabet]] and later use of the Latin alphabet. In [[Tartessian script]], vowels were always written after the plosives, but they were redundant — or at nearly so — and thus it seems they were dropped when the script passed to the [[Iberians]]. 

Among the [[velar consonant]]s, ''ka/ga'' of southeastern Iberian and the southwestern script derives from Phoenician/Greek Γ, ''ke/ge'' from Κ, and ''ki/gi'' from {{lang|grc|Ϙ}},&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt; while ''ko/go'' (perhaps coincidentally) resembles Greek Χ (pronounced {{IPA-el|kʰ|}}). Phoenician/Greek labial letter Β was the source of southwestern ''be'', southeastern ''ba''; the use of Π is uncertain but may have been the source of ''bi.'' (If Greek was used as a secondary source, Greek Φ ({{IPA|[pʰ]}}) would also have been available.) For the [[alveolar consonant|alveolars]], Δ was the source of ''tu/du,'' Τ of ''ta/da,'' and Θ of ''ti/di.''&lt;ref name=espanca/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2036">In [[metaphysics]], '''particulars''' are defined as concrete, spatiotemporal entities as opposed to abstract entities, such as properties or numbers. There are, however, theories of ''[[abstract particulars]]'' or ''[[Trope theory|tropes]]''. For example, [[Socrates]] is a particular (there's only one Socrates-the-teacher-of-Plato and one cannot make copies of him, e.g., by cloning him, without introducing new, distinct particulars). Redness, by contrast, is not a particular, because it is abstract and multiply instantiated (for example a bicycle, an apple, and a given woman's hair can all be red).

==Overview==
[[Sybil Wolfram]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Sybil Wolfram]], ''Philosophical Logic'', Routledge, London and New York, 1989, {{ISBN|0-415-02317-3}}, page 55.&lt;/ref&gt; writes &lt;blockquote&gt;
Particulars include only individuals of a certain kind: as a first approximation individuals with a definite place in space and time, such as persons and material objects or events, or which must be identified through such individuals, like smiles or thoughts.

Some terms are used by philosophers with a rough-and-ready idea of their meaning. This can occur if there is lack of agreement about the best definition of the term. In formulating a solution to the [[problem of universals]], the term 'particular' can be used to describe the ''particular'' instance of redness of a certain apple as opposed to the 'universal' 'redness' (being [[Abstract and concrete|abstract]]).

The term particular is also used as a modern equivalent of the Aristotelian notion of individual substance. Used in this sense, particular can mean any concrete (individual) entity, irrespective of whether it is spatial and temporal or not.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2699">The term '''peace ecology''' has been used by Christos Kyrou of [[American University]] to describe a proposed theoretical framework that is intended to provide "''a better understanding, of the inherent capacities of the environment to inform and sustain peace.''"&lt;ref name=ISA&gt;
Kyrou, Christos.

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of the term==
Peace ecology was introduced by Professor Christos Kyrou, of [[American University]] first in an article at the annual meeting of the [[International Studies Association]], in [[San Diego]], [[California]], Mar 22, 2006.&lt;ref name=ISA /&gt; It was later published in its completed form in an article with the title Peace Ecology: An Emerging Paradigm In Peace Studies in The International Journal of Peace Studies, Volume 12 #1, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
Kyrou, Christos. "[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_6984/is_1_12/ai_n28518146 Peace Ecology: An Emerging Paradign]"  in Peace Studies In The International Journal of Peace Studies, Volume 12   #2,   2007 ([http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-178359708.html alternative link]).
&lt;/ref&gt;

With a follow up article submitted for the Conference on Cutting Edge Theories and Recent Developments in Conflict Resolution, September 27 and 28, 2007, at Syracuse, NY, Dr. Kyrou examined various methodological perspectives from Peace Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Kyrou, together with his graduate and undergraduate students at the International Peace &amp; Conflict Resolution Division of the School of International Service at The American University in [[Washington DC]] continue their effort to expand the practical and theoretical potential of Peace Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a property is any characteristic that applies to a given set.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mathsisfun.com/sets/sets-introduction.html Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt; Rigorously, a property ''p'' defined for all elements of a set ''X'' is usually defined as a function ''p'': ''X'' →  {true, false}, that is true whenever the property holds; or equivalently, as the subset of ''X'' for which ''p'' holds; i.e. the set {''x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''p''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true}; ''p'' is its [[indicator function]]. However, it may be objected that the rigorous definition defines merely the [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a property, and says nothing about what causes the property to hold for exactly those values.

Examples of properties include the [[commutative property]] of [[real number|real]] and [[complex number]]s and the [[distributive property]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17901">'''Public interest design''' is a human-centered&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcdconnect.org/methods HCD Connect Methods]&lt;/ref&gt; and participatory design practice&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Infographic: Public Interest Design|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/infographic/|publisher=PublicInterestDesign.org|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that places emphasis on the “[[triple bottom line]]” of [[sustainable design]] that includes ecological, economic, and social issues and on designing products, structures, and systems that address issues such as [[economic development]] and the preservation of the environment.

Starting in the late 1990s, several books, convenings, and exhibitions have generated new momentum and investment in public interest design. Since then, public interest design—frequently described as a movement or field—has gained public recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cary|first=John|title=Dignifying Design|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/opinion/sunday/dignifying-design.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=23 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 6, 2012|author2=Courtney E. Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Public interest design grew out of the community design movement, which got its start in 1968 after American [[civil rights]] leader [[Whitney Young]] issued a challenge to attendees of the American Institute of Architects (AIA) national convention:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leavitt|first=Jacqueline|title=From the Studio to the Streets: Service Learning in Planning and Architecture|year=2006|publisher=Stylus Publishing|location=Sterling, VA|isbn=978-1563771002|pages=103|authorlink=Multiplying Knowledge: Service-Learning x Activism = Community Scholars|author2=Kara Hoffernan |editor=Mary C. Hardin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

".  .  .  ''you are not a profession that has distinguished itself by your social and civic contributions to the cause of civil rights, and I am sure this does not come to you as any shock.  You are most distinguished by your thunderous silence and your complete irrelevance''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designingactivism.com/2011/12/31/whitney-young-1968-speech-to-the-aia Whitney Young 1968 Speech to the AIA]&lt;/ref&gt;"

The response to Young’s challenge was the establishment of community design centers (CDCs) across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.designcoalition.org/aboutus/our%20roots.htm Design Coalition, "Our Roots"]&lt;/ref&gt;  CDCs, which were often established with the support of area universities,&lt;ref name=Pearson&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearson|first=Jason|title=University-Community Design Partnerships: Innovations in Practice|year=2002|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=1-56898-379-4|pages=6–7|url=http://www.nea.gov/pub/UnivCommDesign.pdf|editor=Mark Robbins|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided a variety of design services – such as affordable housing - within their own neighborhoods.

In architecture schools, “design/build programs” provided outreach to meet local design needs, particularly in low-income and underserved areas.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;  One of the earliest design/build programs was [[Yale University]]’s Vlock Building Project.  The project, which was initiated by students at Yale University School of Architecture in 1967, requires graduate students to design and build low-income housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hill|first=David|title=The New Frontier in Education|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/news/2012/03/The-New-Frontier-Education.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most publicized programs is the [[Auburn University]] [[Rural Studio]] design/build program, which was founded in 1993.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clemence|first=Sara|title=Avant-Garde in Alabama|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304356604577342370002244732|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bostwick|first=William|title="Citizen Architect": The Humble Origins of Socially-Responsible Design|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1585096/citizen-architect-humble-origins-socially-responsible-design|publisher=Fast Company|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Rural Studio’s first project, Bryant House, was completed in 1994 for $16,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Samuel Mockbee and the Rural Studio: Community Architecture|url=http://www.nbm.org/exhibitions-collections/exhibitions/samuel-mockbee.html|publisher=National Building Museum|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public Interest Design from the 1990s – Present==
Interest in public interest design – particularly socially responsible architecture – began to grow during the 1990s and continued into the first decade of the new millennium.  Conferences, books, and exhibitions began to showcase the design work being done beyond the community design centers,&lt;ref name=Cary /&gt; which had greatly decreased in numbers since their peak in the seventies.&lt;ref name=Pearson/&gt;

[[Non-profit]] organizations – including [[Architecture for Humanity]], BaSiC Initiative, Design Corps, [[Public Architecture]], Project H, Project Locus, and MASS Design Group – began to provide design services that served a larger segment of the population than had been served by traditional design professions.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes|first=C.J.|title=Does "Doing Good" Pay the Bills?|url=http://archrecord.construction.com/practice/Community-Service/2012/03/perspective-practice/Humanitarian-Work.asp|publisher=Architectural Record|accessdate=23 October 2012|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Allweil|first1=Yael|title=The House of Dance and Feathers Mardi Gras Indian Museum-New Orleans, LA by Project Locus: Patrick Rhodes, Executive Director [EDRA/Places Awards 2007--Design].|journal=Places|date=2007|volume=19|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many public interest design organizations also provide training and [[service-learning]] programs for architecture students and graduates.  In 1999, the Enterprise Rose Architectural Fellowship was established,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; giving young architects the opportunity to work on three-year-long design and community development projects in low-income communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enterprisecommunity.com/solutions-and-innovation/design-leadership/rose-architectural-fellowship/about-the-fellowship Enterprise Community website, "About the Fellowship"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the earliest formal public interest design programs include the Gulf Coast Community Design Studio at Mississippi State University&lt;ref name=Cary&gt;{{cite web|last=Cary|first=John|title=Chronology of the Public Interest Design Field|url=http://www.publicinterestdesign.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Public-Interest-Design-Chronology-120601.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012|coauthors=PublicInterestDesign.org, University of Minnesota College of Design, Tandus Flooring}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Public Interest Design Summer Program at the [[University of Texas]]&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;
.&lt;ref&gt;[http://soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html Overview of Public Interest Design program, University of Texas School of Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416152806/http://www.soa.utexas.edu/csd/PID/overview.html |date=2012-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2015, Portland State University launched the first graduate certificate program in Public Interest Design in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218044206/http://www.pdx.edu/the-arts/recent-and-upcoming/cpid-launches-graduate-certificate-in-public-interest-design |archivedate=2015-02-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first professional-level training was conducted in July 2011 by the Public Interest Design Institute (PIDI) and held at the [[Harvard]] Graduate School of Design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicinterestdesign.com/harvard-school-of-design%20 Harvard School of Design course description]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2011, a survey of [[American Institute of Architects]] (AIA), 77% of AIA members agreed that the mission of the professional practice of public interest design could be defined as the belief that every person should be able to live in a socially, economically, and environmentally healthy community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Public Interest Design Takes Shape|url=http://www.metropolismag.com/pov/20120917/public-interest-design-takes-shape|publisher=Metropolismag.com|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Bryan|author2=Roberta Feldman |author3=Sergio Palleroni |author4=Davide Perkes |title=2011 Latrobe Prize Progress Report: Public Interest Practices in Architecture|date=31 December 2011|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aiab094604.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications, Conferences, and Exhibits==
Several books have been published that showcase a variety of public interest design projects and practitioners:

The annual Structures for Inclusion conference showcases public interest design projects from around the world.  The first conference, which was held in 2000, was called “Design for the 98% Without Architects."&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; Speaking at the conference, Rural Studio co-founder [[Samuel Mockbee]] challenged attendees to serve a greater segment of the population: “I believe most of us would agree that American architecture today exists primarily within a thin band of elite social and economic conditions&lt;ref name=Bell&gt;{{cite book|last=Bell|first=Bryan|title=Good Deeds, Good Design: Community Service Through Architecture|year=2003|publisher=Princeton Architectural Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1568983912|pages=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;...in creating architecture, and ultimately community, it should make no difference which economic or social type is served, as long as the status quo of the actual world is transformed by an imagination that creates a proper harmony for both the affluent and the disadvantaged.&lt;ref name=Bell/&gt;" 

In 2007, the [[Cooper Hewitt National Design Museum]] held an exhibition, titled “Design for the Other 90%,” curated by Cynthia Smith. Following the success of this exhibit, Smith developed the "Design Other 90" initiative into an ongoing series, the second of which was titled “Design for the Other 90%: CITIES”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities Design for the Other 90%: CITIES] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016121902/http://www.cooperhewitt.org/exhibitions/design-other-90-cities |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (2011), held at the [[United Nations]] headquarters. In 2010, Andres Lipek of the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in New York curated an exhibit, called “Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2010/smallscalebigchange/ MoMA Exhibition: "Small Scale, Big Change: New Architectures of Social Engagement"]&lt;/ref&gt;”&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;

==Professional Networks==
One of the oldest professional networks related to public interest design is the professional organization is the Association for Community Design (ACD), which was founded in 1977.&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.communitydesign.org/about Association for Community Design website, "About" page]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}}

In 2005, adopting a term coined by architect Kimberly Dowdell, the Social Economic Environmental Design (SEED) Network was co-founded by a group of community design leaders,&lt;ref name=Cary/&gt; during a meeting hosted by the Loeb Fellowship at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. The SEED Network established a common set of five principles and criteria for practitioners of public interest design. An evaluation tool called the SEED Evaluator is available to assist designers and practitioners in developing projects that align with SEED Network goals and criteria.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In 2006, the Open Architecture Network was launched by [[Architecture for Humanity]] in conjunction with co-founder [[Cameron Sinclair]]'s TED Wish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ted.com/talks/cameron_sinclair_on_open_source_architecture.html Cameron Sinclair's TED Prize talk and wish for the Open Architecture Network]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non primary source needed}} Taking on the name Worldchanging in 2011, the network is an open-source community dedicated to improving living conditions through innovative and sustainable design. Designers of all persuasions can share ideas, designs and plans as well as collaborate and manage projects. while protecting their intellectual property rights using the [[Creative Commons]] "some rights reserved" licensing system.

In 2007, DESIGN 21: Social Design Network, an online platform built in partnership with UNESCO, was launched.

In 2011, the Design Other 90 Network was launched by the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum, in conjunction with its Design with the Other 90%: CITIES exhibition.

In 2012, IDEO.org, with the support of The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, launched HCD Connect, a network for social sector leaders committed to human-centered design. In this context, human-centered design begins with the end-user of a product, place, or system — taking into account their needs, behaviors and desires. The fast-growing professional network of 15,000 builds on "The Human-Centered Design Toolkit,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideo.com/work/human-centered-design-toolkit/ The Human-Centered Design Toolkit from IDEO]&lt;/ref&gt;{{non-primary source needed|date=January 2018}} which was designed specifically for people, nonprofits, and social enterprises that work with low-income communities throughout the world. People using the HCD Toolkit or human-centered design in the social sector now have a place to share their experiences, ask questions, and connect with others working in similar areas or on similar challenges.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9881">'''Religious views on the self''' vary widely. The self is a complex and core subject in many forms of [[spirituality]]. In Western [[psychology]], the concept of self comes from [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Carl Jung]], and [[Carl Rogers]] where the self is the [[inner critic]]. Two types of self are commonly considered - the self that is the ego, also called the learned, superficial self of mind and body, "[[false self]]", an egoic creation, and the Self which is sometimes called the "[[true self]]", the "Observing Self", or the "Witness".&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Manly P. ''Self Unfoldment by Disciplines of Realization''. Los Angeles, California: The Philosophical Research Society, Inc. 1942. page 115 "On rare occasions we glimpse for an instant the tremendous implication of the Self, and we become aware that the personality is indeed merely a shadow of the real."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Eastern philosophies]] reject the self as a [[delusion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.com/en/index.php?title=Conceptions_of_the_Self_in_Western_and_Eastern_Psychology|title=Conceptions of the Self in Western and Eastern Psychology|publisher=Chinese Buddhist Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Buddhism and psychology|Buddhist psychology]], the [[Raga (Buddhism)|attachment]] to [[Atman (Buddhism)|self]] is an illusion that serves as the main cause of [[Dukkha|suffering]] and unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerr.com/galin/papers/roots.htm|title=The concept "self" and "person" in buddhism and in western psychology|publisher=NY:Columbia University Press|date=2001|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discussion==
Human beings have a self—that is, they are able to look back on themselves as both subjects and objects in the universe. Ultimately, this brings questions about who we are and the nature of our own importance.&lt;ref&gt;Charon, Joel M. ''Ten Questions: A Sociological Perspective.'' 5th edition. Thomson &amp; Wadsworth. pg. 260&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christianity]] sees the self negatively, distorted through [[sin]]: 'The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked; who can know it?' ([[Jeremiah]] 17:9) Alternately, each human self or spirit is a unique creation by God. The "desperately wicked self" is the sinful self that has chosen to be "curved back upon itself", but ever with the potential of changing and (by God's grace) turning toward "'new life', opened out to love of God and neighbor"
See Albert Outler as quoted in "Outler on the Holy Spirit" by George Aikinson, Bristol House, 2004 p.&amp;nbsp;54. and p.&amp;nbsp;87.

According to psychologist [[James Marcia]], identity comes from both political and religious views. Marcia  also identified exploration and commitment as interactive parts of identity formation, which includes religious identity. [[Erik Erikson]] compared faith with doubt and found that healthy adults take heed to their spiritual side.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kiesling, Chris; Montgomery, Marylin; Sorell, Gwendolyn; Colwell, Ronald. "Identity and Spirituality: A Psychosocial Exploration of the Sense of 
Spiritual Self"&lt;/ref&gt;

One description of spirituality is the self's search for "ultimate meaning" through an independent comprehension of the sacred. Spiritual identity appears when the symbolic religious and spiritual of a culture is found by individuals in the setting of their own life. There can be different types of spiritual self because it is determined on one's life and experiences. Another definition of spiritual identity is " a persistent sense of self that addresses ultimate questions about the nature, purpose, and meaning of life, resulting in behaviors that are consonant with the individual’s core values." &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
Another description of Mind, body, soul, and spirit is a holism of one inner self being of one whole.  It all combines together as one whole instead of different parts.  Individuals one thoughts, one feeling, one breathing is all completed and occurs as one whole.  GT &lt;/truth knowledge of one self, and the universe.

==Maslow's theory==
According to [[Abraham Maslow]]'s theory of "self-actualization needs: to find self fulfillment and realize one's potential."&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg.478
&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that once a person realizes what they are capable of it gives them a motivation to do whatever they intend.

==Bandura==
[[Albert Bandura]] believed in "[[self-efficacy]], which refers to a person's learned expectations of success."&lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg 478&lt;/ref&gt; This theory states that people are bound to complete a task more effectively if they think they will succeed. If a person is more negative about their abilities the chances of them completing the task accordingly are less.

==Winnicott==

[[D. W. Winnicott]] was of the opinion that psychopathology was in large part generated by an overvaluation of the [[True self and false self|false self]], at the expense of the true self which was linked to the individual's own [[creativity]].&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Greenberg et al, ''Handbook of Experimental Existential Psychotherapy'' (2004) p. 454&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rogers on self and self-concept==
[[Carl Rogers]]' theory is that "people use the term [[self concept]] to refer to all the information and beliefs you have as an individual regarding your own nature, unique qualities, and typical behaviors." &lt;ref&gt;Huffman, Karen. Psychology In Action. 8th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. pg. 478&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers thought that people develop through relationships with others and also in relation to themselves. An encouraging environment helps people towards this development.

Commenting on his clients' search for a real self, Rogers quoted with approval [[Kierkegaard]]'s statement that "the most common despair is to be in despair at not choosing, or willing, to be oneself; but that the deepest form of despair is to choose 'to be another than himself'. On the other hand, 'to will to be that self which one truly is, is indeed the opposite of despair'".&lt;ref&gt;Carl Rogers, ''On Becoming A Person'' (1961) p. 110&lt;/ref&gt;

==The observing self==

The "Visible" self is mainly dependent on a subjective view, that is, as viewed from the specific self. For example: looking in the mirror, we perceive the reflection to be our true "self"....

==The witnessing self==

[[Ken Wilber]] describes the Witnessing (or Observing) Self in the following terms: 
:"This observing Self is usually called the Self with a capital ''S'', or the Witness, or pure [[Immanence|Presence]], or pure [[Awareness]], or [[Consciousness#Philosophical approaches|Consciousness]] as such, and this Self as transparent Witness is a direct ray of the living [[divinity|Divine]]. The ultimate "I AM" is [[Christ]], is [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], is [[shunyata|Emptiness]] itself: such is the startling testimony of the world's great [[mysticism|mystic]]s and [[wise old man|sage]]s." &lt;ref name="wilber"&gt;Ken Wilber, ''A Brief History of Everything'', ch. 12, p.197-199&lt;/ref&gt;
He adds that the Self is not an [[Emergence|Emergent]], but an aspect present from the start as the basic form of awareness, but which becomes increasingly obvious and self-aware  "as growth and transcendence matures." As Depth increases, consciousness shines forth more noticeably, until:
:"shed[ding] its lesser identification with both the body and the mind ... in each case from matter to body to mind to Spirit... consciousness or the observing Self sheds an exclusive [[identity (philosophy)|identity]] with a lesser and shallower dimension, and opens up to deeper and higher and wider occasions, until it opens up to its own ultimate ground in Spirit itself. And the stages of transpersonal growth and development are basically the stages of following this Observing Self to its ultimate abode, which is pure Spirit or pure Emptiness, the ground, path and fruition of the entire display." &lt;ref name="wilber" /&gt;

In a similar vein, [[Evelyn Underhill]]&lt;ref name="Underhill"&gt;Evelyn Underhill, "Mysticism:  A Study in Nature and Development of Spiritual Consciousness, Section III, P. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; states: &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is clear that under ordinary conditions, and save for sudden gusts of "[[Transcendence (religion)|Transcendental]] Feeling" induced by some saving madness such as Religion, Art, or Love, the superficial self knows nothing of the attitude of this silent watcher—this "Dweller in the Innermost"—towards the incoming messages of the external world: nor of the activities which they awake in it. Concentrated on the sense-world, and the messages she receives from it, she knows nothing of the relations which exist between this subject and the unattainable Object of all thought. But by a deliberate inattention to the messages of the senses, such as that which is induced by contemplation, the mystic can bring the ground of the soul, the seat of "Transcendental Feeling," within the area of consciousness: making it amenable to the activity of the will. Thus becoming unaware of his usual and largely fictitious "external world," another and more substantial set of perceptions, which never have their chance under normal conditions, rise to the surface. Sometimes these unite with the normal reasoning faculties. More often, they supersede them. Some such exchange, such "losing to find," appears to be necessary, if man's transcendental powers are to have their full chance."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3487">The '''space of flows''' is a high-level cultural abstraction of [[space]] and [[time]], and their dynamic interactions with digital age society. The concept was created by the sociologist and cybernetic culture theoretician [[Manuel Castells]] to "reconceptualize new forms of spatial arrangements under the new technological paradigm"; a new type of space that allows distant synchronous, real-time interaction (Castells, p.&amp;nbsp;146). The space of flows first was mentioned in ''The Informational City: Information Technology, Economic Restructuring, and the Urban Regional Process'' (1989).

==Definitions==
Castells defines the concepts as follows: "The material arrangements that allow for simultaneity of social practices without territorial contiguity. It is not purely electronic space...It is made up first of all of an technological infrastructure of information systems, telecommunications, and transportation lines" (Castells, Manuel (2000): Grassrooting the Space of Flows, hg. von. James O. Wheeler, Yuko Aoyama und Barney Warf, London: Routledge, p.19).

==Theoretic==
Traditionally, the concept of space is considered a passive entity, while time is considered a separate and active entity. Space should not be disconnected from time, because space is a dynamic entity related to time. Castells rejected the contention that space will disappear upon the creation of the [[global city]], because space is "the material support of time-sharing social practices". Thus, the ''space of flows'' is "the material organization of time-sharing social practices that work through flows" (Castells, p.&amp;nbsp;147).

In 2001, Castells wrote: "the space of flows ... links up distant locales around shared functions and meanings on the basis of electronic circuits and fast transportation corridors, while isolating and subduing the logic of experience embodied in the space of places" ("Informationalism and the Network Society" in ''The Hacker Ethic and the Spirit of the Information Age'' (2001), by Pekka Himanen, New York, Random House pp.&amp;nbsp;155–78).

==Practical==
[[Space]] is the physical support of the way people live in [[time]]. ''Real world time'', the space-and-time to which people are accustomed, is the "space of places", which is unlike the "space of flows" because it lacks the three elements of (i) a proper flow medium, (ii) the proper items composing the flow traversing through it, and (iii) the organisational nodes through which these flows circulate (Stalder, p.&amp;nbsp;3). The space of flows concept comprehends human action and interaction occurring dynamically and at a distance—effected via telecommunications technology containing continuous flows of time-sensitive communications, and the nodes of global [[computer]] systems. These informational flows connect people to a continuous, real-time [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] community that differs from the [[Global village (term)|global village]] because the groups' positions in time become more important than their places.

'''Spontaneous generation''' refers to an obsolete body of thought on the ordinary formation of living organisms without descent from similar organisms. The theory of spontaneous generation held that living creatures could arise from nonliving matter and that such processes were commonplace and regular. For instance, it was hypothesized that certain forms such as fleas could arise from inanimate matter such as dust, or that [[maggot]]s could arise from dead flesh.&lt;ref name="Ball"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ball|first1=Philip|title=Man Made: A History of Synthetic Life|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=1|pages=15–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/man-made-a-history-of-synthetic-life|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variant idea was that of '''equivocal generation''', in which species such as [[Cestoda|tapeworms]] arose from unrelated living organisms, now understood to be their [[Host (biology)|hosts]]. The idea of '''univocal generation''', by contrast, refers to effectively exclusive reproduction from genetically related parent(s), generally of the same [[species]].

The doctrine of spontaneous generation was coherently synthesized by [[Aristotle]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Brack, André |editor=Brack, André |title=The Molecular Origins of Life |year=1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-56475-5 |page=1 |chapter=Introduction |chapterurl=http://assets.cambridge.org/97805215/64755/excerpt/9780521564755_excerpt.pdf | quote=Aristotle gathered the different claims into a real theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled and expanded the work of [[Pre-Socratic_philosophy|earlier natural philosophers]] and the various ancient explanations for the appearance of organisms, and was taken as scientific fact for two millennia. Though challenged in the 17th and 18th centuries by the experiments of [[Francesco Redi]] and [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]], spontaneous generation was not disproved until the work of [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[John Tyndall]] in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"&gt;Tyndall, John; Fragments of Science, Vol 2, chapters IV, XII (1876), XIII(1878); Pub. P. F. Collier, New York 1905; (Available at: https://archive.org/details/fragmenoscien02tyndrich)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pasteur's experiment testing spontaneous generation and biogenesis.gif|thumb|Pasteur invented the [[swan neck flask|swan-necked flask]] to create an environment known not to grow microorganisms. After sterilizing a nutrient broth in these flasks, he removed the swan necks of the controls. Microorganisms grew only in the controls, refuting spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Ball"/&gt;]]

Rejection of spontaneous generation is no longer controversial among biologists. By the middle of the 19th century, experiments of Louis Pasteur and others refuted the traditional theory of spontaneous generation and supported [[biogenesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Zubay, Geoffrey.

==Description and terms==

Spontaneous generation refers both to the supposed processes by which different types of life might repeatedly emerge from specific sources other than seeds, eggs, or parents, and also to theoretical principles presented in support of any such phenomena. Crucial to this doctrine are the ideas that life comes from non-life and that no causal agent, such as a parent, is needed. The hypothetical processes by which life routinely emerges from nonliving matter on a time scale of minutes, weeks, or years (e.g. in the supposed seasonal generation of mice and other animals from the mud of the [[Nile]]) are sometimes referred to as ''abiogenesis''.&lt;ref&gt;Stillingfleet, Edward. ''Origines Sacrae''. Cambridge University Press 1697. May be downloaded from [https://archive.org/details/originessacraeor00stil]&lt;/ref&gt; Such ideas have no operative principles in common with the modern hypothesis of [[abiogenesis]], which asserts that life emerged in the early ages of the planet, over a time span of at least millions of years, and subsequently diversified, and that there is no evidence of any subsequent repetition of the event.&lt;ref name="Bernal 1967"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bernal |first=J. D. |year=1967 |origyear=Reprinted work by [[Alexander Oparin|A. I. Oparin]] originally published 1924; Moscow: [[Publishing houses in the Soviet Union|The Moscow Worker]] |title=The Origin of Life |series=The Weidenfeld and Nicolson Natural History |others=Translation of Oparin by Ann Synge |location=London |publisher=[[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] |lccn=67098482 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''equivocal generation'', sometimes known as ''heterogenesis'' or ''xenogenesis'', describes the supposed process by which one form of life arises from a different, unrelated form, such as tapeworms from the bodies of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor=Wiener, Philip P. | title=Dictionary of the History of Ideas | accessdate=2009-01-22 | year=1973 | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | location=New York | chapter=Spontaneous Generation | chapterurl=http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=DicHist/uvaBook/tei/DicHist1.xml;chunk.id=dv4-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following [[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment, the term "spontaneous generation" fell increasingly out of favor. Experimentalists used a variety of terms for the study of the origin of life from nonliving materials. ''Heterogenesis'' was applied to the generation of living things from once-living organic matter (such as boiled broths), and [[Henry Charlton Bastian]] proposed the term ''archebiosis'' for life originating from inorganic materials. Disliking the randomness and unpredictability implied by the term "'spontaneous' generation," in 1870 Bastian coined the term ''biogenesis'' to refer to the formation of life from nonliving matter. Soon thereafter, however, English biologist [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] proposed the term ''[[abiogenesis]]'' to refer to this same process and adopted ''[[biogenesis]]'' for the process by which life arises from existing life; it is this latter set of definitions that became dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Strick |first=James |title=Evolution &amp; The Spontaneous Generation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yjKplNQv9zoC&amp;pg=PR11 |accessdate=August 27, 2012 |date=April 15, 2001 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-1-85506-872-8|pages=xi–xxiv |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antiquity==
===Presocratic philosophers===
Active in the 6th and 5th centuries BCE, early Greek philosophers, called ''physiologoi'' in antiquity (Greek: φυσιολόγοι; in English, physical or [[Natural philosophy|natural philosophers]]), attempted to give natural explanations of [[phenomena]] that had previously been ascribed to the agency of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[W. K. C. Guthrie|Guthrie, William Keith Chambers]], ''The Presocratic Tradition from Parmenides to Democritus'', p. 13, {{ISBN|0-317-66577-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''physiologoi'' sought the material principle or ''[[arche]]'' (Greek: ἀρχή) of things, emphasizing the rational unity of the external world and rejecting theological or mythological explanations.&lt;ref name="seyffert480"&gt;Seyffert, Oskar (1894), ''Dictionary of Classical Antiquities'', page 480&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Anaximander]], who believed that all things arose from the elemental nature of the universe, the ''[[Apeiron_(cosmology)|apeiron]]'' (ἄπειρον) or the "unbounded" or "infinite," was likely the first western thinker to propose that life developed spontaneously from nonliving matter. The [[substance theory|primal chaos]] of the ''apeiron,'' eternally in motion, served as a substratum in which elemental opposites (e.g., wet and dry, hot and cold) generated and shaped the many and varied things in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Legacy of Parmenides: Eleatic Monism and Later Presocratic Thought |author=Curd, Patricia |year=1998 |publisher=Princeton University Press| page=77 |isbn=0-691-01182-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x2JX1ulXzogC&amp;pg=PA77}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Hippolytus of Rome]] in the third century CE, Anaximander claimed that fish or fish-like creatures were first formed in the "wet" when acted on by the heat of the sun and that these aquatic creatures gave rise to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kahn |first1=Charles H. |title=Anaximander and the Origins of Greek Cosmology |date=1994 |publisher=Hackett Publishing |isbn=0872202550 |pages=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Censorinus, writing in the 3rd century, reports:

{{quote|text=Anaximander of Miletus considered that from warmed up water and earth emerged either fish or entirely fishlike animals. Inside these animals, men took form and embryos were held prisoners until puberty; only then, after these animals burst open, could men and women come out, now able to feed themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Censorinus, ''De Die Natali'', IV, 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]], a pupil of Anaximander, thought that air was the element that imparted life and endowed creatures with motion and thought. He proposed that plants and animals, including human beings, arose from a primordial terrestrial slime, a mixture of earth and water, combined with the sun's heat. [[Anaxagoras]], too, believed that life emerged from a terrestrial slime. However, he held that the seeds of plants existed in the air from the beginning, and those of animals in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]]. [[Xenophanes]] traced the origin of man back to the transitional period between the fluid stage of the earth and the formation of land, under the influence of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Osborn |first=Henry Fairfield |authorlink=Henry Fairfield Osborn |title=From the Greeks to Darwin: An outline of the development of the evolution idea|date=1894 |publisher=Macmillan|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what has occasionally been seen as a prefiguration of a concept of [[natural selection]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |title=Natural Selection before the "Origin of Species" |journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |date=1941 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=71–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Empedocles]] accepted the spontaneous generation of life but held that different forms, made up of differing combinations of parts, spontaneously arose as though by trial and error: successful combinations formed the species we now see, whereas unsuccessful forms failed to reproduce.

===Aristotle===
{{main|Aristotle's biology}}
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|300px|[[Aristotle]] proposed that in sexual reproduction, the child inherits [[Hylomorphism|form]] (eidos) from the father and matter from the mother, as well as heat (pneuma) either from the father or from the environment.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014&gt;{{cite book |last=Leroi |first=Armand Marie |authorlink=Armand Marie Leroi |title=The Lagoon: How Aristotle Invented Science |titlelink=Aristotle's Lagoon |publisher=Bloomsbury |date=2014 |isbn=978-1-4088-3622-4 |pages=215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spontaneous generation, the environment could effectively replace the parents' contributions of form, matter, and heat.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22/&gt;]]

In his biological works, the natural philosopher Aristotle theorized extensively the reproduction of various animals, whether by [[sexual reproduction|sexual]], [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], or spontaneous generation. In accordance with his fundamental theory of [[hylomorphism]], which held that every physical entity was a compound of matter and form, Aristotle's basic theory of sexual reproduction contended that the [[semen|male's seed]] imposed form, the set of characteristics passed down to offspring on the "matter" (menstrual blood) supplied by the female. Thus female matter is the [[Four_causes#Matter|material cause]] of generation—it supplies the matter that will constitute the offspring—while the male semen is the [[Four_causes#Agent|efficient cause]], the factor that instigates and delineates the thing's existence.&lt;ref name=Leroi2014/&gt; Yet, as proposed in the ''[[History of Animals]]'', many creatures form not through sexual processes but by spontaneous generation:

{{quote|Now there is one property that animals are found to have in common with plants. For some plants are generated from the seed of plants, whilst other plants are self-generated through the formation of some elemental principle similar to a seed; and of these latter plants some derive their nutriment from the ground, whilst others grow inside other plants ... So with animals, some spring from parent animals according to their kind, whilst others grow spontaneously and not from kindred stock; and of these instances of spontaneous generation some come from putrefying earth or vegetable matter, as is the case with a number of insects, while others are spontaneously generated in the inside of animals out of the secretions of their several organs.&lt;ref name="HistAnimV"&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson | title=History of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/ | accessdate=2008-12-20 | volume=| origyear=c. 343 BCE | year=1910 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book V | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/history/book5.html | isbn=90-6186-973-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Aristotle|''[[History of Animals]]'', Book V, Part 1}}

According to this theory, living things may come forth from nonliving things in a manner roughly analogous to the "enformation of the female matter by the agency of the male seed" seen in sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name=Lehoux2017p22&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonliving materials, like the seminal fluid present in sexual generation, contain ''[[pneuma]]'' (πνεῦμα, "breath"), or "[[vital heat]]". According to Aristotle, pneuma had more "heat" than regular air did, and this heat endowed the substance with certain vital properties:
{{quote|The power of every soul seems to have shared in a different and more divine body than the so called [four] elements ... For every [animal], what makes the seed generative inheres in the seed and is called its "heat." But this is not fire or some such power, but instead the pneuma that is enclosed in the seed and in foamy matter, this being analogous to the element of the stars. This is why fire does not generate any animal ... but the heat of the sun and the heat of animals does, not only the heat that fills the seed, but also any other residue of [the animal's] nature that may exist similarly possesses this vital principle.|Aristotle|''[[Generation of Animals]]'', 736b29ff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime: The Wonder and Complexity of Spontaneous Generation |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Aristotle drew an analogy between the "foamy matter" (τὸ ἀφρῶδες) found in nature and the "seed" of an animal, which he viewed as being a kind of foam itself (composed, as it was, from a mixture of water and pneuma). For Aristotle, the generative materials of male and female animals (semen and menstrual blood) were essentially refinements, made by male and female bodies according to their respective proportions of heat, of ingested food, which was, in turn, a byproduct of the elements earth and water. Thus any creature, whether generated sexually from parents or spontaneously through the interaction of vital heat and elemental matter, was dependent on the proportions of pneuma and the various elements which Aristotle believed comprised all things.&lt;ref name="Lehoux2017p26"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lehoux |first1=Daryn |title=Creatures Born of Mud and Slime |date=2017 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Aristotle recognized that many living things emerged from putrefying matter, he pointed out that the putrefaction was not the source of life, but the byproduct of the action of the "sweet" element of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Aristotle | authorlink=Aristotle |others=translated by Arthur Platt | title=On the Generation of Animals | url=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/ | accessdate=2009-01-09 | origyear=c. 350 BCE | year=1912 | publisher=Clarendon Press | location=Oxford | chapter=Book III | chapterurl=http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/generation/book3.html | isbn=90-04-09603-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With varying degrees of observational confidence, Aristotle theorized the spontaneous generation of a range of creatures from different sorts of inanimate matter. The [[testacea]]ns (a genus which for Aristotle included [[bivalvia|bivalves]] and snails), for instance, were characterized by spontaneous generation from mud, but differed based upon the precise material they grew in—for example, [[clam]]s and [[scallop]]s in sand, [[oyster]]s in slime, and the [[barnacle]] and the [[limpet]] in the hollows of rocks.&lt;ref name=HistAnimV/&gt;

As the dominant view of philosophers and thinkers continued to be in favour of spontaneous generation, some Christian theologians accepted the view. [[Augustine of Hippo]] discussed spontaneous generation in ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'' and ''The Literal Meaning of Genesis'', citing Biblical passages such as "Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life" ({{bibleverse||Genesis|1:20|KJV|}}) as decrees that would enable ongoing creation.&lt;ref name ="irisfry"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fry | first=Iris | title=The Emergence of Life on Earth |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Fo7tQ5mG21IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA17,M1| chapter=Chapter 2: Spontaneous Generation — Ups and Downs | accessdate=2009-01-21 | year=2000 | publisher=Rutgers University Press |isbn=978-0-8135-2740-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the [[decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]] in 5th century to the [[East-West Schism]] in 1054, the influence of Greek science declined, although spontaneous generation generally went unchallenged. New descriptions were made. Of the numerous beliefs, some had doctrinal implications outside of the [[Book of Genesis]]. For example, the idea that a variety of bird known as the ''[[barnacle goose#Folklore|barnacle goose]]'' emerged from a crustacean known as the ''[[goose barnacle]]'', had implications on the practice of fasting during [[Lent]].  In 1188, [[Gerald of Wales]], after having traveled in Ireland, argued that the "unnatural" generation of barnacle geese was evidence for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|virgin birth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Giraldus Cambrensis | authorlink=Gerald of Wales | title=Topographia Hiberniae | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/1188geraldwales-barnacle.html | accessdate=2009-02-01 | year=1188 | isbn=0-85105-386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the practice of fasting during Lent allowed fish, but prohibited fowl, the idea that the goose was in fact a fish suggested that its consumption be permitted during Lent.

Aristotle, in Arabic translation, was reintroduced to Western Europe.  During the 13th century, Aristotle reached his greatest acceptance. With the availability of Latin translations Saint [[Albertus Magnus]] and his student, Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], raised Aristotelianism to its greatest prominence. Albert wrote a paraphrase of Aristotle, ''De causis et processu universitatis'', in which he removed some and incorporated other commentaries by Arabic scholars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | date=March 20, 2006 | contribution=Albert the Great | contribution-url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/albert-great/ | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | editor-link=Edward N.

Spontaneous generation is discussed as a fact in literature well into the [[Renaissance]].  Where, in passing, [[Shakespeare]] discusses snakes and crocodiles forming from the mud of the [[Nile]] ({{Shakecite|Ant|F1|2|7}}), [[Izaak Walton]] again raises the question of the origin of eels "as rats and mice, and many other living creatures, are bred in Egypt, by the sun's heat when it shines upon the overflowing of the river...". While the ancient question of the origin of eels remained unanswered and the additional idea that eels reproduced from corruption of age was mentioned, the spontaneous generation of rats and mice engendered no debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walton | first=Izaak | authorlink=Izaak Walton | others=transcribed by Risa Bear | title=The Compleat Angler or the Contemplative Man's Recreation | url=http://www.uoregon.edu/~rbear/walton/index.html | accessdate=2009-02-05 | origyear=1653 | year=1903  | publisher=George Bell &amp; Sons  | chapter=XIII.

The Dutch biologist and microscopist [[Jan Swammerdam]] (1637 - 1680) rejected the concept that one animal could arise from another or from putrification by chance because it was impious and like others found the concept of spontaneous generation irreligious, and he associated it with atheism and Godless opinion.&lt;ref name="OslerFarber2002"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Osler, Margaret J. |author2=Farber, Paul Lawrence |title=Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S.

[[Jan Baptist van Helmont]] (1580–1644) used experimental techniques, such as growing a willow for five years and showing it increased mass while the soil showed a trivial decrease in comparison.  As the process of [[photosynthesis]] was not understood, he attributed the increase of mass to the absorption of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last=Ducheyne | first=Steffen | year=2006 | title=Joan Baptista van Helmont and the Question of Experimental Modernism | pages=305–332 | url=http://logica.ugent.be/steffen/Physis%20-%20Van%20Helmont.pdf | accessdate=2009-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; His notes also describe a recipe for mice (a piece of soiled cloth plus wheat for 21 days) and scorpions (basil, placed between two bricks and left in sunlight).

The ancient beliefs were subjected to testing.  In 1668, [[Francesco Redi]] challenged the idea that maggots arose spontaneously from rotting meat.

{{quote|Whether there be any spontaneous or anomalous generation of animals, as has been the constant opinion of naturalists heretofore, I think there is good reason to question. It seems to me at present most probable, that there is no such thing; but that even all insects are the natural issue of parents of the same species with themselves. F. Redi has gone a good way in proving this, having cleared the point concerning generation ''ex materia putrida''. But still there remain two great difficulties. The first is, to give an account of the production of insects bred in the by-fruits and excrescencies of vegetables, which the said Redi doubts not to ascribe to the vegetative soul of the plant that yields those excrescencies. But for this I refer you to Mr. Lister. The second, to render an account of insects bred in the bodies of other animals.

[[Pier Antonio Micheli]], around 1729, observed that when fungal spores were placed on slices of melon the same type of fungi were produced that the spores came from, and from this observation he noted that fungi did not arise from spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="Agrios2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Agrios, George N. |title=Plant Pathology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnzbgZgby60C&amp;pg=PA17 |accessdate=14 August 2012 |year=2005 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-044565-3 |pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1745, [[John Needham]] performed a series of experiments on boiled broths.  Believing that boiling would kill all living things, he showed that when sealed right after boiling, the broths would cloud, allowing the belief in spontaneous generation to persist.  His studies were rigorously scrutinized by his peers and many of them agreed.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt;

[[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] modified the Needham experiment in 1768, attempting to exclude the possibility of introducing a contaminating factor between boiling and sealing. His technique involved boiling the broth in a sealed container with the air partially evacuated to prevent explosions.  Although he did not see growth, the exclusion of air left the question of whether air was an essential factor in spontaneous generation.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, by that time there was already widespread scepticism among major scientists, to the principle of spontaneous generation. Observation was increasingly demonstrating that whenever there was sufficiently careful investigation of mechanisms of biological reproduction, it was plain that processes involved basing of new structures on existing complex structures, rather from chaotic muds or dead materials. [[Joseph Priestley]], after he had fled to America and not long before his death, wrote a letter that was read to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1803. It said in part:

{{quote|There is nothing in modern philosophy that appears to me so extraordinary, as the revival of what has long been considered as the exploded doctrine of equivocal, or, as Dr. Darwin calls it, spontaneous generation; by which is meant the production of organized bodies from substances that have no organization, as plants and animals from no pre-existing germs of the same kinds, plants without seeds, and animals without sexual intercourse.

The germ of an organized body, the seed of a plant, or the embrio of an animal, in its first discoverable state, is now found to be the future plant or animal in miniature, containing every thing essential to it when full grown, only requiring to have the several organs enlarged, and the interstices filled with extraneous nutritious matter. When the external form undergoes the greatest change, as from an aquatic insect to a flying gnat, a caterpillar to a crysalis, a crysalis to a butterfly, or a tadpole to a frog, there is nothing new in the organization; all the parts of the gnat, the butterfly, and the frog, having really existed, though not appearing to the common observer in the forms in which they are first seen. In like manner, every thing essential to the oak is found in the acorn.&lt;ref name="PriestleySG" &gt;Priestley, Joseph.

In 1837, [[Charles Cagniard de la Tour]], a physicist, and [[Theodor Schwann]], one of the founders of cell theory, published their independent discovery of [[yeast]] in [[alcoholic fermentation]].  They used the [[microscope]] to examine foam left over from the process of brewing [[beer]].  Where [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek|Leeuwenhoek]] described "small spheroid globules", they observed yeast cells undergo [[cell division]].  Fermentation would not occur when sterile air or pure oxygen was introduced if yeast were not present.  This suggested that airborne [[microorganisms]], not spontaneous generation, was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Springer | first=Alfred | date=October 13, 1892 | title=The Micro-organisms of the Soil | journal=Nature | volume=46 | issue=1198 | pages=576–579 | publisher=Nature Publishing Group | issn=0028-0836| url=https://books.google.com/?id=LHkCAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PT138&amp;lpg=PT138 | doi=10.1038/046576b0|bibcode=1892Natur..46R.576. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although the idea of spontaneous generation had been in decline for nearly a century, its supporters did not abandon it all at once. As [[James Rennie]] wrote:

{{quote|...inability to trace the origin of minute plants and insects led to the doctrine of what is called spontaneous or equivocal generation, of which the fancies above-mentioned are some 'of the prominent branches. The experiments of Redi on the hatching of insects from eggs, which were published at Florence in 1668, first brought discredit upon this doctrine, though it had always a few eminent disciples. At present it is maintained by a considerable number -of distinguished naturalists, such as Blumenbach, Cuvier, Bory de St. Vincent, R. Brown, &amp;c. "The notion or spontaneous generation," says Bory, " is at first revolting to a rational mind, but it is, notwithstanding, demonstrable by the microscope. The fact is averred : Willer has seen it, I have seen it, and twenty other observers have seen it: the pandorinia exhibit it every instant. "These pandorinia he elsewhere describes as probably nothing more than " animated scions of Zoocarpae".  It would be unprofitable to go into any lengthened discussion upon this mysterious subject; and we have great doubts whether the ocular demonstration by the microscope would succeed except in the hands of a disciple of the school. Even with naturalists, whose business it is to deal with facts, the reason is often wonderfully influenced by the imagination...&lt;ref name=JRIT&gt;Rennie, James. Insect Transformations. Page 10.

===Pasteur and Tyndall===

[[Louis Pasteur]]'s 1859 experiment is widely seen as having settled the question of spontaneous generation.  He boiled a meat broth in a flask that had a long neck that curved downward, like that of a goose or swan.  The idea was that the bend in the neck prevented falling particles from reaching the broth, while still allowing the free flow of air.  The flask remained free of growth for an extended period.  When the flask was turned so that particles could fall down the bends, the broth quickly became clouded.&lt;ref name="slowdeath" /&gt; However, minority objections were persistent and not always unreasonable, given that the experimental difficulties were far more challenging than the popular accounts suggest. The investigations of [[John Tyndall]], a correspondent of Pasteur and a great admirer of Pasteur's work, were decisive in disproving spontaneous generation and dealing with lingering issues. Still, even Tyndall encountered difficulties in dealing with the effects of [[Endospore |microbial spores]], which were not well understood in his day. Like Pasteur, he boiled his cultures to sterilize them, and some types of bacterial spores can survive boiling. The [[autoclave]], which eventually came into universal application in medical practice and microbiology to sterilise equipment, was not an instrument that had come into use at the time of Tyndall's experiments, let alone those of Pasteur.&lt;ref name= "TyndallFragments2"/&gt;

In 1862, the [[French Academy of Sciences]] paid a special attention to the issue and established a prize "to him who by well-conducted experiments throws new light on the question of the so-called spontaneous generation" and appointed a commission to judge the winner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Engelhardt |first1=Hugo Tristram |last2=Caplan |first2=Arthur L. |title=Scientific Controversies: Case Studies in the Resolution and Closure of Disputes in Science and Technology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6nkSX63VsLkC&amp;pg=PA107 |year=1987 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-27560-6 |page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tarski's axioms''', due to [[Alfred Tarski]], are an [[axiom]] set for the substantial fragment of [[Euclidean geometry]] that is formulable in [[first-order logic]] with [[identity (mathematics)|identity]], and requiring no [[set theory]] {{harv|Tarski|1959}} (i.e., that part of Euclidean geometry that is formulable as an [[elementary theory]]). Other modern axiomizations of Euclidean geometry are [[Hilbert's axioms]] and [[Birkhoff's axioms]].

==Overview==
Early in his career Tarski taught geometry and researched set theory. His coworker Steven Givant (1999) explained Tarski's take-off point:
:From Enriques, Tarski learned of the work of [[Mario Pieri]], an Italian geometer who was strongly influenced by Peano. Tarski preferred Pieri's system [of his ''Point and Sphere'' memoir], where the logical structure and the complexity of the axioms were more transparent.
Givant then says that "with typical thoroughness" Tarski devised his system:
:What was different about Tarski's approach to geometry? First of all, the axiom system was much simpler than any of the axiom systems that existed up to that time. In fact the length of all of Tarski's axioms together is not much more than just one of Pieri's 24 axioms. It was the first system of Euclidean geometry that was simple enough for all axioms to be expressed in terms of the [[primitive notion]]s only, without the help of defined notions. Of even greater importance, for the first time a clear distinction was made between full geometry and its elementary — that is, its first order — part.

Like other modern axiomatizations of Euclidean geometry, Tarski's employs a [[formal system]] consisting of symbol strings, called [[sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]]s, whose construction respects formal [[syntax (logic)|syntactical rules]], and rules of proof that determine the allowed manipulations of the sentences. Unlike some other modern axiomatizations, such as [[Birkhoff's axioms|Birkhoff's]] and [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert's]], Tarski's axiomatization has no [[primitive object]]s other than ''points'', so a variable or constant cannot refer to a line or an angle. Because points are the only primitive objects, and because Tarski's system is a [[first-order theory]], it is not even possible to define lines as sets of points. The only primitive relations ([[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s) are "betweenness" and "congruence" among points.

Tarski's axiomatization is shorter than its rivals, in a sense Tarski and Givant (1999) make explicit. It is more concise than Pieri's because Pieri had only two primitive notions while Tarski introduced three: point, betweenness, and congruence. Such economy of primitive and defined notions means that Tarski's system is not very convenient for ''doing'' Euclidean geometry. Rather, Tarski designed his system to facilitate its analysis via the tools of [[mathematical logic]], i.e., to facilitate deriving its metamathematical properties. Tarski's system has the unusual property that all sentences can be written in universal-existential form, a special case of the [[prenex normal form]]. This form has all [[Universal quantification|universal quantifiers]] preceding any [[Existential quantification|existential quantifiers]], so that all sentences can be recast in the form &lt;math&gt;\forall u \forall v \ldots\exists a \exists b\dots.&lt;/math&gt; This fact allowed Tarski to prove that Euclidean geometry is [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]]: there exists an [[algorithm]] which can determine the truth or falsity of any sentence. Tarski's axiomatization is also [[Completeness (logic)|complete]]. This does not contradict [[Gödel's first incompleteness theorem]], because Tarski's theory lacks the expressive power needed to interpret [[Robinson arithmetic]] {{harv|Franzén|2005|pp=25–26}}.

== The axioms ==

[[Alfred Tarski]] worked on the axiomatization and metamathematics of [[Euclidean geometry]] intermittently from 1926 until his death in 1983, with Tarski (1959) heralding his mature interest in the subject. The work of Tarski and his students on Euclidean geometry culminated in the monograph Schwabhäuser, Szmielew, and Tarski (1983), which set out the 10 [[axiom]]s and one [[axiom schema]] shown below, the associated [[metamathematics]], and a fair bit of the subject. Gupta (1965) made important contributions, and Tarski and Givant (1999) discuss the history.

=== Fundamental relations ===

These axioms are a more elegant version of a set Tarski devised in the 1920s as part of his investigation of the metamathematical properties of [[Euclidean plane geometry]]. This objective required reformulating that geometry as a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]]. Tarski did so by positing a [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s, with lower case letters denoting variables ranging over that universe.  [[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] is provided by the underlying logic (see [[First-order logic#Equality and its axioms]]).&lt;ref&gt;Tarski and Givant, 1999, page 177&lt;/ref&gt;  Tarski then posited two primitive relations:
* ''Betweenness'', a [[triadic relation]]. The [[atomic sentence]] ''Bxyz'' denotes that ''y'' is "between" ''x'' and ''z'', in other words, that ''y'' is a point on the [[line segment]] ''xz''.  (This relation is interpreted inclusively, so that ''Bxyz'' is trivially true whenever ''x=y'' or ''y=z'').
* ''[[congruence (geometry)|Congruence]]'' (or "equidistance"), a [[polyadic relation|tetradic relation]].  The [[atomic sentence]] ''wx'' ≡ ''yz'' can be interpreted as ''wx'' is [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to ''yz'', in other words, that the [[distance|length]] of the line segment ''wx'' is equal to the length of the line segment ''yz''.

Betweenness captures the [[affine geometry|affine]] aspect of Euclidean geometry; congruence, its [[metric space|metric]] aspect. The background logic includes [[identity (mathematics)|identity]], a [[binary relation]]. The axioms invoke identity (or its negation) on five occasions.

The axioms below are grouped by the types of relation they invoke, then sorted, first by the number of existential quantifiers, then by the number of atomic sentences. The axioms should be read as [[universal closure]]s; hence any [[free variable]]s should be taken as tacitly [[universal quantifier|universally quantified]].

=== Congruence axioms ===

; Reflexivity of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv yx\,.&lt;/math&gt;

; Identity of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zz \rightarrow x=y.&lt;/math&gt;

; [[Transitive relation|Transitivity]] of Congruence:
: &lt;math&gt;(xy \equiv zu \land xy \equiv vw) \rightarrow zu \equiv vw.&lt;/math&gt;

====Commentary====
While the congruence relation &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw&lt;/math&gt; is, formally, a 4-way relation among points, it may also be thought of, informally, as a binary relation between two line segments &lt;math&gt;xy&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;zw&lt;/math&gt;.  The "Reflexivity" and "Transitivity" axioms above, combined, prove both:
* that this binary relation is in fact an [[equivalence relation]]
** it is reflexive: &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv xy&lt;/math&gt;.
** it is symmetric &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow zw \equiv xy&lt;/math&gt;.
** it is transitive &lt;math&gt;(xy \equiv zu \land zu \equiv vw) \rightarrow xy \equiv vw&lt;/math&gt;.
* and that the order in which the points of a line segment are specified is irrelevant.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow xy \equiv wz&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow yx \equiv zw&lt;/math&gt;.
** &lt;math&gt;xy \equiv zw \rightarrow yx \equiv wz&lt;/math&gt;.

The "transitivity" axiom asserts that congruence is [[Euclidean relation|Euclidean]], in that it respects the first of [[Euclid's elements|Euclid's]] "[[Euclid's axioms#Axiomatic approach|common notions]]".

The "Identity of Congruence" axiom states, intuitively, that if ''xy'' is congruent with a segment that begins and ends at the same point,''x'' and ''y'' are the same point. This is closely related to the notion of [[reflexive relation|reflexivity]] for [[binary relation]]s.

=== Betweenness axioms ===
[[File:Tarski's formulation of Pasch's axiom.svg|right|thumb|Pasch's axiom]]
; Identity of Betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;Bxyx \rightarrow x=y.&lt;/math&gt;
The only point on the line segment &lt;math&gt;xx&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; itself.

&lt;!--
; Transitivity of betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;(wxy \land xyz) \rArr wxz&lt;/math&gt;
If ''x'' is between ''w'' and ''y'', and if ''y'' is between ''x'' and ''z'', then ''x'' must be between ''w'' and ''z''.

; Connectivity of betweenness
: &lt;math&gt;(xyz \land xyw \land x \ne y) \rArr (xzw \lor xwz).&lt;/math&gt;
If ''y'' is between ''x'' and ''z'' and between ''x'' and ''w'', ''w'' and ''z'' must both be on the same side of ''x''. Connectivity and Transitivity order the points.--&gt;

; [[Axiom of Pasch]]
: &lt;math&gt;(Bxuz \land Byvz) \rightarrow \exists a\, (Buay \land Bvax).&lt;/math&gt;
The two diagonals of the [[quadrilateral]] &lt;math&gt;xuvy&lt;/math&gt; must intersect at some point.

[[File:Tarski's continuity axiom.svg|right|thumb|Continuity: φ and ψ divide the ray into two halves and the axiom asserts the existence of a point b dividing those two halves]]
; [[Axiom schema]] of Continuity
Let φ(''x'') and ψ(''y'') be [[first order logic|first-order formulae]] containing no [[free variable|free instances]] of either ''a'' or ''b''. Let there also be no free instances of ''x'' in ψ(''y'') or of ''y'' in φ(''x''). Then all instances of the following schema are axioms:
: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \,\forall x\, \forall y\,[(\phi(x) \land \psi(y)) \rightarrow Baxy] \rightarrow \exists b\, \forall x\, \forall y\,[(\phi(x) \land \psi(y)) \rightarrow Bxby].&lt;/math&gt;
Let ''r'' be a ray with endpoint ''a''. Let the first order formulae φ and ψ define subsets ''X'' and ''Y'' of ''r'', such that every point in ''Y'' is to the right of every point of ''X'' (with respect to ''a''). Then there exists a point ''b'' in ''r'' lying between ''X'' and ''Y''. This is essentially the [[Dedekind cut]] construction, carried out in a way that avoids quantification over sets.

; Lower [[Dimension]]
: &lt;math&gt;\exists a \, \exists b\, \exists c\, [\neg Babc \land \neg Bbca \land \neg Bcab].&lt;/math&gt;
There exist three noncollinear points.  Without this axiom, the theory could be [[model theory|modeled]] by the one-dimensional [[real line]], a single point, or even the empty set.

=== Congruence and betweenness ===

[[File:Points in a plane equidistant to two given points lie on a line.svg|right|thumb|Upper dimension]]
; Upper [[Dimension]]
: &lt;math&gt;(xu \equiv xv \land yu \equiv yv \land zu \equiv zv \land u \ne v) \rightarrow (Bxyz \lor Byzx \lor Bzxy).&lt;/math&gt;
Three points equidistant from two distinct points form a line. Without this axiom, the theory could be modeled by [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] or higher-dimensional space.

; Axiom of Euclid
Each of the three variants of this axiom, all equivalent over the remaining Tarski's axioms to Euclid's [[parallel postulate]], has an advantage over the others:
* '''A''' dispenses with [[existential quantifier]]s;
* '''B''' has the fewest variables and [[atomic sentence]]s;
* '''C''' requires but one primitive notion, betweenness. This variant is the usual one given in the literature.

: '''A''': &lt;math&gt;((Bxyw \land xy \equiv yw ) \land (Bxuv \land xu \equiv uv) \land (Byuz \land yu \equiv zu)) \rightarrow yz \equiv vw.&lt;/math&gt;
Let a line segment join the midpoint of two sides of a given [[triangle]]. That line segment will be half as long as the third side. This is equivalent to the [[interior angle]]s of any triangle summing to two [[right angles]].

: '''B''': &lt;math&gt;Bxyz \lor Byzx \lor Bzxy \lor \exists a\, (xa \equiv ya \land xa \equiv za).&lt;/math&gt;
Given any [[triangle]], there exists a [[circle]] that includes all of its vertices.

[[File:Tarski's axiom of Euclid C.svg|thumb|right|Axiom of Euclid: C]]
: '''C''': &lt;math&gt;(Bxuv \land Byuz \land x \ne u) \rightarrow \exists a\, \exists b\,(Bxya \land Bxzb \land Bavb).&lt;/math&gt;
Given any [[angle]] and any point ''v'' in its interior, there exists a line segment including ''v'', with an endpoint on each side of the angle.

; Five Segment
[[File:Five segment.svg|thumb|right|Five segment]]
:&lt;math&gt;{(x \ne y  \land  Bxyz  \land  Bx'y'z'  \land xy \equiv x'y' \land yz \equiv y'z' \land xu \equiv x'u' \land yu \equiv y'u')} \rightarrow zu \equiv z'u'.&lt;/math&gt;
Begin with two [[triangle]]s, ''xuz'' and ''x'u'z'.'' Draw the line segments ''yu'' and ''y'u','' connecting a vertex of each triangle to a point on the side opposite to the vertex. The result is two divided triangles, each made up of five segments. If four segments of one triangle are each [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] to a segment in the other triangle, then the fifth segments in both triangles must be congruent.

; Segment Construction
: &lt;math&gt; \exists z\, [Bxyz \land yz \equiv ab].&lt;/math&gt;
For any point ''y'', it is possible to draw in any direction (determined by ''x'') a line congruent to any segment ''ab''.

==Discussion==
Starting from two primitive [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] whose fields are a [[Dense-in-itself|dense]] [[universe (mathematics)|universe]] of [[point (geometry)|point]]s, Tarski built a geometry of [[line segment]]s. According to Tarski and Givant (1999: 192-93), none of the above [[axiom]]s are fundamentally new. The first four axioms establish some elementary properties of the two primitive relations. For instance, Reflexivity and Transitivity of Congruence establish that congruence is an [[equivalence relation]] over line segments. The Identity of Congruence and of Betweenness govern the trivial case when those relations are applied to nondistinct points. The theorem ''xy''≡''zz'' ↔ ''x''=''y'' ↔ ''Bxyx'' extends these Identity axioms.

A number of other properties of Betweenness are derivable as theorems including:
*[[Reflexive relation|Reflexivity]]: ''Bxxy'' ;
*[[Symmetry]]: ''Bxyz'' → ''Bzyx'' ;
*[[Transitive relation|Transitivity]]: (''Bxyw'' ∧ ''Byzw'') → ''Bxyz'' ;
*[[Connection (mathematics)|Connectivity]]: (''Bxyw'' ∧ ''Bxzw'') → (''Bxyz'' ∨ ''Bxzy'').
The last two properties [[total order|totally order]] the points making up a line segment.

Upper and Lower Dimension together require that any model of these axioms have a specific finite [[dimension]]ality. Suitable changes in these axioms yield axiom sets for [[Euclidean geometry]] for [[dimension]]s 0, 1, and greater than 2 (Tarski and Givant 1999: Axioms 8&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, 8&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(0)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(1)&lt;/sup&gt;, 9&lt;sup&gt;(n)&lt;/sup&gt; ). Note that [[solid geometry]] requires no new axioms, unlike the case with [[Hilbert's axioms]]. Moreover, Lower Dimension for ''n'' dimensions is simply the negation of Upper Dimension for ''n'' - 1 dimensions.

When dimension &gt; 1, Betweenness can be defined in terms of [[congruence relation|congruence]] (Tarski and Givant, 1999). First define the relation "≤" (where &lt;math&gt;ab \leq cd&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted "the length of line segment &lt;math&gt;ab&lt;/math&gt; is less than or equal to the length of line segment &lt;math&gt;cd&lt;/math&gt;"):
:&lt;math&gt;xy \le zu \leftrightarrow \forall v ( zv \equiv uv \rightarrow \exists w ( xw \equiv yw \land yw \equiv uv ) ).&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of two dimensions, the intuition is as follows:  For any line segment ''xy'', consider the possible range of lengths of ''xv'', where ''v'' is any point on the perpendicular bisector of ''xy''.  It is apparent that while there is no upper bound to the length of ''xv'', there is a lower bound, which occurs when ''v'' is the midpoint of ''xy''.  So if ''xy'' is shorter than or equal to ''zu'', then the range of possible lengths of ''xv'' will be a superset of the range of possible lengths of ''zw'', where ''w'' is any point on the perpendicular bisector of ''zu''.

Betweenness can then be defined by using the intuition that the shortest distance between any two points is a straight line:
:&lt;math&gt;Bxyz \leftrightarrow \forall u ( ( ux \le xy \land uz \le zy ) \rightarrow u = y ).&lt;/math&gt;

The Axiom Schema of Continuity assures that the ordering of points on a line is [[Dedekind complete|complete]] (with respect to first-order definable properties). The Axioms of [[Pasch's axiom|Pasch]] and Euclid are well known. Remarkably, Euclidean geometry requires just the following further axioms:
* ''Segment Construction''. This axiom makes [[measurement]] and the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] possible—simply assign the value of 1 to some arbitrary non-empty line segment;{{clarify|date=December 2011}}&lt;!-- what would this axiom look like? --&gt;
&lt;!-- Already included above * ''Five Segments''. This bears on the [[congruence (geometry)|congruence]] of [[triangle]]s.{{Contradict|date=May 2012}}--&gt;

Let ''wff'' stand for a [[well-formed formula]] (or syntactically correct formula) of elementary geometry. Tarski and Givant (1999: 175) proved that elementary geometry is:
*[[consistency|Consistent]]: There is no wff such that it and its negation are both theorems;
*[[complete theory|Complete]]: Every sentence or its negation is a theorem provable from the axioms;
*[[Decidability (logic)|Decidable]]: There exists an [[algorithm]] that assigns a [[truth value]] to every sentence. This follows from Tarski's:
** [[Decision procedure]] for the [[real closed field]], which he found by [[quantifier elimination]] (the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]]);
**Axioms admitting of a (multi-dimensional) faithful [[interpretability|interpretation]] as a [[real closed field]].
Gupta (1965) proved the above axioms independent, ''Pasch'' and ''Reflexivity of Congruence'' excepted.

Negating the Axiom of Euclid yields [[hyperbolic geometry]], while eliminating it outright yields [[absolute geometry]]. Full (as opposed to elementary) Euclidean geometry requires giving up a first order axiomatization: replace φ(''x'') and ψ(''y'') in the axiom schema of Continuity with ''x'' ∈ ''A'' and ''y'' ∈ ''B'', where ''A'' and ''B'' are universally quantified variables ranging over sets of points.

==Comparison with Hilbert==
[[Hilbert's axioms]] for plane geometry number 16, and include Transitivity of Congruence and a variant of the Axiom of Pasch. The only notion from intuitive geometry invoked in the remarks to Tarski's axioms is [[triangle]]. (Versions '''B''' and '''C''' of the Axiom of Euclid refer to '"circle" and "angle," respectively.) Hilbert's axioms also require "ray," "angle," and the notion of a triangle "including" an angle. In addition to betweenness and congruence, Hilbert's axioms require a primitive [[binary relation]] "on," linking a point and a line. The [[Axiom schema]] of Continuity plays a role similar to Hilbert's two axioms of Continuity. This schema is indispensable; Euclidean geometry in Tarski's (or equivalent) language cannot be finitely axiomatized as a [[first-order logic|first-order theory]]. Hilbert's axioms do not constitute a first-order theory because his continuity axioms require [[second-order logic]].

The first four groups of axioms of [[Hilbert's axioms]] for plane geometry are bi-interpretable with Tarski's axioms minus continuity.

'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter.

Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate—thought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second one—three types of "anger," on the third one—three types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth one—thought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blue—in the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (black—in the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling – they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|Писарева|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|Писарева|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

=== Created by emotions ===
[[File:Form13.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 13. Grasping Animal Affection.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=43}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} "Thoughts of a greedy, lustful, or malicious character appear differently from those of a noble, selfless, loving nature."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thoughts in which selfishness or greed are prominent usually take a hooked form, the hooks in some case actually clawing round the object desired."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=56}} Leadbeater has compared similar thought-forms with the "[[grappling hook]]s."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 8}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
In Fig. 13 shows the thought-form created by "a strong craving for personal possession." Its color has dull unpleasing hue "deadened with the heavy tint indicative of selfishness." The curving hooks are its especially characteristic. Creator this thought-form had never "conception of the self-sacrificing love which pours itself out in joyous service," no thinking of return.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett saw here only the "brown-red swirls."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} An especially powerful class of this kind of thought-forms takes on "the appearance of a nebulous octopus, with long, winding, clinging tentacles, striving to wrap around the other person," and to drag him toward the aura of creator.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=33}}}}{{refn|group=note|"A gross sensual love will be a dull and heavy crimson"... The mutual influence of thoughts is like "adding fuel to the fire." If someone for a long time is fraught with low thoughts, then into his mind will pour such a vicious stream that he will be horrified if he understands what he is doing with himself.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=65, 84}} According to Leadbeater, do not need to collect photos of actresses [and actors], as "they always attract the most undesirable thought-forms from hosts of impure-minded people."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}
[[File:Form19.jpg|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 19. The Intention to Know.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=51|Gettings|1987|2p=48|Breen|2014|3p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"I asked him when he saw this curious shape."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition. Yellow, in its various shades, represents intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=65}} Gold colour "indicates pure intellect applied to philosophy or mathematics."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}}

Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror—she recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger. These are "usually shown on a black background in the case of anger arising from hatred or malice."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–65}}}}

[[File:Greed for alcohol - Annie Besant Thought Form - Project Gutenberg eText 16269.PNG|thumb|left|200px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 29.

It would strike upon his astral body, but it could not penetrate and it would then return to the sender."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=49}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror." Red color shows anger.{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}

=== Created by experiences ===
Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111–112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Form30.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 30. At a Shipwreck.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=58|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a grey-brown cloud [on the right]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, the illustrations of thought-forms in the book are "very reminiscent of much [[Abstract art|abstract]] and [[Surrealism|surrealistic]] painting."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} "This ushers in the visual heart of the book, featuring images that wouldn't look out of place hanging alongside early [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]] or [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]] abstractions."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror." Orange of a "bright shade, represents pride and ambition." Yellow, in its diverse tones, shows "intellectual power."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64, 65}}}} 
[[File:Form31.jpg|left|thumb|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 31. On the First Night.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|"Figure 31 is another narrative piece."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear.

In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness." His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the "very curious downward protrusion" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Dark gray color represents "depression and melancholy."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}{{refn|group=note|Gettings wrote that the form to the right demonstrates a distress of the materialist forming from the mind of one "who is unable to accept that death is a liberation into a higher world, and the proboscis-like feeler which runs from the base of this thought form is said to be reaching into the grave, as if to bring back the dead body."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "The man who had lived in the ordinary blank ignorance with regard to death, had no thought in connection with it but selfish fear and depression; whereas the man who understood the facts was entirely free from any suggestion of those feelings, for the only sentiments evoked in him were those of sympathy and affection for the mourners, and of devotion and high aspiration."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 11}}}}

=== Created by meditation ===
[[File:Form38.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 38. An Aspiration to Enfold all.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=114}}{{refn|group=note|"Figure 38 is even more radical a departure, anticipating the [[op art]] of the 1960s."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

[[File:Form41.jpg|thumb|left|180px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 41. The [[Logos]] as manifested in Man.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=69|Breen|2014|2p=113}}{{refn|group=note|"It looks like more like [[logo]]s as manifested by ad men."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=112}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that the thought-form shown in Fig. 41 was accompanied by "the devotional aspiration" to that [[Logos]] may thus be manifested through the man in meditation.

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church." This, as the authors explain, "signifies the movement of one of the parts of the melody, the four moving approximately together denoting the treble, alto, tenor and bass respectively." Moreover, "the scalloped edging surrounding the whole is the result of various flourishes and [[arpeggio]]s, and the floating crescents in the centre represent isolated or [[staccato]] chords."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=77|Breen|2014|2p=110}}{{refn|group=note|Lachman named the musical forms of Besant and Leadbeater "the synaesthetic forms created by music."{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} In the first part of her article ''[[Occult or Exact Science?]]'' Blavatsky described in detail the multiple phenomena of color-sound vision.{{sfn|Blavatsky|1956|pp=57–58}}}}

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|Бычков|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[František Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|Архив ВТ}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Шабанова}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier à lumières]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|Бычков|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113–114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J. Robert Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] famously quoted [[Vedas|Vedic scripture]]... when he witnessed the first atomic bomb blast. But in the context of figures like Besant and Ledbetter, Oppenheimer's fascination with Eastern [[mysticism]] seems less like a personal quirk and more like a thread in a larger tapestry: an interweaving of mysticism, technology, and art that began at the turn of the last century and is still with us in the twenty-first."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}}}

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

== Criticism ==
{{criticism section|date=July 2018}}
An academic science names the activities of such "investigators," as the authors of this book, "[[pseudoscience]]", because it based on a concept of the [[extrasensory perception]].{{sfn|Carroll|2003}} The belief in existence of thought-forms "remains influential today" for the Theosophists, followers of [[New Thought]], [[New Age]] and in [[Neopaganism|neopagan movements]], including [[Wicca]].{{sfn|Keller|2006|pp=755–756}}{{sfn|Wessinger|2013|p=44}}

'''Vivartavada''' is the Vedantic theory of causation; it is the method of asserting this doctrine.
==Overview==
The Sanskrit word - ''vivarta'' (विवर्त) means alteration, modification, change of form, altered condition or state. According to [[Advaita Vedanta]], ''vivarta'' involves ''[[vikara]]'' or modification but only apparent modification (of the real which does not change). Therefore, the world is vivarta of the sole real entity [[Brahman]], and merely an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|publisher=Digital Dictionaries of Asia|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=Vivarta&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, '''Vivartavada''' is derived from the word ''vivarta'' and refers to the Theory of Causation that was proposed by [[Adi Sankara]] to explain the world-appearance or is the method to assert the [[Vedanta]] doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sanskrit dictionary |publisher=Spokensanskrit.de| |url= http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?tinput=vivartavAda&amp;script=&amp;direction=SE&amp;link=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connotation==
'''Vivartavada''' is a philosophical term that refers to 'the origin of the universe from the manifestation or appearance of the unique Brahman' or in other words it refers to the material causehood of Brahman; it is juxtaposed to the term [[Parinama-vada (Hindu thought)|parinamvada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thought and Faith|author=Vassilis Vitsaxis|publisher=Somerset Hall Press|page=535|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sC0--0ZUfBkC&amp;pg=PA535&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPirUpMX1KOGB8TfgcgB&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It denotes the [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita]] theory of Superimposition (''[[adhyasa]]'') which is in concurrence with the statements of the ''[[Upanishads]]'' to the effect that when ignorance is ended by right knowledge the true nature of an object becomes known. The relation that obtains between [[Brahman]] and the world as between the creator and the created has in its background the general theory of ''[[Samkhya#Causality|Satkaryavada]]'', the theory which is based on the premise that the effect  pre-exists in its cause, and ''vivartavada'' according to which theory the effect, this world, is merely an unreal (''vivarta'') transformation of its cause, Brahman. Advaita Vedanta holds Creation to be only an apparent change and not a modification of Brahman in reality. Brahman is reality and reality is non-dual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mystery of Creation |publisher=Chinmaya Mission|page=30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S-b_vCaHAWgC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPirUpMX1KOGB8TfgcgB&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which reason [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]] Sloka 261 reiterates - एकमेव सदनेककारणं – That which exists as one only, is the cause of multiplicity, superimposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Candrashekhara Bharati of Srngeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=274|url=http://www.bhavans.info/store/bookdetail.asp?bid=364&amp;bauth=Sri+Sankara+Bhagavatpadacarya|access-date=2013-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215124501/http://www.bhavans.info/store/bookdetail.asp?bid=364&amp;bauth=Sri+Sankara+Bhagavatpadacarya|archive-date=2013-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist view==
Buddhist thinkers and teachers have expressed their views on the concept of Duality developed by the [[Vedic]] thinkers and teachers. [[Zen]] teaches that we should be free from dualities in order to be what we are meant to be, and that duality is due to ego which veils reality from its true essence (explained by Buddhists in terms of non-essence); ego, which is an artificial condition not having a true identity because it is a creation of the mind, and distorts reality in an attempt to perceive what it wants to perceive and not what it is. [[Taoism]] teaches that reality is like the un- carved block (the symbol of [[Tao]]), one must not carve the block lest ''[[Tao]]'' is changed. [[Adi Sankara|Sankara]] considers ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' as a temporary or phenomenal reality and Brahman as the Ultimate reality; and that living in ''[[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]'' the ''[[Jiva]]'' (the 'ego-self') superimposes its own interpretation of reality onto reality, and thus Brahman remains hidden or concealed and ''Maya'' is viewed as the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laughing Buddha of Tofukuji|author=Ishwar C. Harris|publisher=World Wisdom Inc.|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oawiWve0GC0C&amp;pg=PA34&amp;lpg=PA34&amp;dq=vivartavada+wiki&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SJ1pUuDXki&amp;sig=HaQd0PJvG0Ri-ZyyOKSbdoefiI0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=PM6rUoHtLsmqhQfk-oCwCQ&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada%20wiki&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basics of Advaita Vedanta==
There are broadly seven basics of the ''Advaita'' philosophy advocated by [[Adi Shankara]], and they are:-
# There are three levels of [[Satya]] ([[Truth]]) – a) the 'Transcendental' or the ''Paramarthika'' level, in which Brahman is the only reality and nothing else exists apart from Brahman, b) the 'Pragmatic' or the ''Vyavaharika'' level, in which both ''Jiva'' and ''[[Ishwara]]'' are true and, c) the 'Apparent' or the ''Prathibhasika'' level, in which even the material world is false, an illusion.
# [[Brahman]] (''[[Nirguna brahman|Nirguna]]'') due to ignorance (''[[Avidya (Hinduism)|avidya]]'')is visible as the material world and its objects,.
# [[Maya (illusion)|Maya]] is the complex illusionary power of Brahman that causes Brahman to be seen in many forms.
# [[Ishvara]] or the ''[[Saguna brahman|Saguna Brahman]]'' is the reflection of the Self falling upon the mirror of ''Maya'', it is ignorance which is the cause of unhappiness and sin in the mortal world.
# [[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is the soul or the self that is identical with Brahman, it is not part of Brahman that ultimately dissolves into Brahman but the whole Brahman itself; ''Atman'' is alone, when its reflection falls on ''Avidya'' it becomes the ''Jiva'' and experiences the world existence through the senses.
#         [[Moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]] or Liberation results when Maya is removed when there ultimately exists no difference between the ''Jiva'' and the ''Atman''.
#  [[Creationism|Creation]] – Though the ''karana'' named Brahman, due to ''vivarta'', appears as the ''karya'' named ''jagat'', there is actually no separate ''karya'' in reality – Brahman is the only reality and ''[[jagat]]'' is ''mithya'' ('illusion').

''Advaita'' denies real creation from the level of the highest truth, at ordinary level it accepts the world just as it appears to common sense. ''[[Ajativada]]'' (the theory of no origination of [[Gaudapada]]) is associated with ''Vivartavada'' (the theory of manifestation of Sankara), they are the same teaching at the ''parmartha'' basis but from two different angles viz. a) when the focus is kept on the changeless Brahman, and as a consequence of that perspective the world is seen to be merely an unreal appearance, the teaching is ''ajativada''; and b) when the focus shifts to the empirical fact of the world-appearance, and specifically onto the relation between the world-appearance and Brahman, the teaching is ''vivartavada'', the former finds the world to be a dream and a magic, whereas to the latter, the world existence is illusory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Method of Early Vedanta |author=Michael Comans|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|pages=355-356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sx12hxoFVqwC&amp;pg=PA356&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XtyrUpuFDZSjhgfBkoHgCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aurobindo]] considers ''Vivartavada'' to be the denial of causation and the assertion of identity presupposing ''parinama'' or 'effectual transformation'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Integral Advaitism of Aurobindo|author=Ramacandra Misra|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|page=219|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vf-EXycD0UUC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=XtyrUpuFDZSjhgfBkoHgCg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition==
The 'Theory of Manifestation' propounded by the ''[[Advaita Vedanta]]'' is not without its opponents. [[Vijnanabhiksu]]  portrays casual relation as having three terms – unchangeable locus cause, changeable locus cause and effect – the locus cause is inseparable from and does not inhere in the changeable cause and the effect .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Unifying Hinduism: Philosophy and Identity in Indian Intellectual History]] |author=Andrew J. Nicholson|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=48|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, the ''Pratyabhijna'' philosophy of Somananda refutes the ''Arambhvada'' (the 'Realistic view' of the [[Nyaya]]-[[Vaisesika]]), the ''Parinamavada'' (the theory of Transformation of the ''[[Sankhya]]-[[Yoga]]'') and the ''Vivartavada'' (the theory of Manifestation of the [[Advaita]]), by postulating the theory of ''Svatantryavada'' (the 'Universal voluntarism')  which states that it is due to the sovereignty of God’s Will that Effect evolves from Cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Literary Heritage of Kashmir|author=Krishan Lal Kala|publisher=Mittal Publications|page=278|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzozRa9wJ9kC&amp;pg=PA278&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPirUpMX1KOGB8TfgcgB&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas [[Ramanuja]] accepts [[Prakrti]] as the material cause but [[Madhavacharya of Sringeri|Madhava]] rejects this contention since material cause does not mean that which controls and superintends; Madhava also rejects the ''Vivartavada'' because it does not accept any effect that has got to be accounted for.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Treasury of Mahayana Sutras|author=Chen-chi Chang|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass publishers|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aktdBheKI-IC&amp;pg=PA246&amp;dq=vivartavada&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPirUpMX1KOGB8TfgcgB&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=vivartavada&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;In his philosophy of pure non-dualism ([[Shuddhadvaita]]), [[Vallabhacharya]] also does not support 'vivartavada' and propounds that Maya (or the 'Jagat') is real and is only a power of Brahmana who himself manifests, of his own will, as Jiva and the world&lt;ref&gt;[[Devarshi Ramanath Shastri]], “Shuddhadvaita Darshan (Vol.2)”, Published by Mota Mandir, Bhoiwada, Mumbai, India, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; and there is no transformation of Brahmana in doing so, just as a gold ornament still remains gold only. Shuddhadvaita is also therefore known as ‘Avikṛta Pariṇāmavāda’ (Unmodified transformation).&lt;ref&gt;“Brahmavād Saṅgraha”, Pub. Vaishnava Mitra Mandal Sarvajanik Nyasa, Indore, India, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
[[File:Beowulf - wisdome.jpg|thumb|Early mention of wisdom in an [[Beowulf|ancient manuscript]]]]
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines wisdom as "Capacity of judging rightly in matters relating to life and conduct; soundness of judgement in the choice of means and ends; sometimes, less strictly, sound sense, esp. in practical affairs: opp. to folly;" also "Knowledge (esp. of a high or abstruse kind); enlightenment, learning, erudition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=wisdom, n|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/229491 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press|subscription=yes|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Haddon Spurgeon]] defined wisdom as "the right use of [[knowledge]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Charles Spurgeon#Quotes]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert I. Sutton]] and [[Andrew Hargadon]] defined the "attitude of wisdom" as "acting with knowledge while doubting what one knows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Carney|first1= Brian M.|last2= Getz|first2= Isaac|title= Freedom, Inc.|date= 2009 |publisher= Crown Business|isbn= 9780307462473|page= 238 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=J3nVgNxrvlwC&amp;pg=PA238 |accessdate= 8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the psychological literature however the construct of wisdom does not have a commonly accepted definition.&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt;

== Philosophical perspectives ==
The [[ancient Greeks]] considered wisdom to be an important [[virtue]], [[personified]] as the [[goddess]]es [[Metis (mythology)|Metis]] and [[Athena]]. Athena is said to have sprung from the head of Zeus. She was portrayed as strong, fair, merciful, and chaste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turnbill|first=S|date=12 August 2011|title=Athena, Greek goddess of wisdom and craftsmanship|url=http://www.goddessgift.com/goddess-myths/greek_goddess_athena.htm|publisher=Goddessgift.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], [[philosophy]] was literally the love of Wisdom ([[-phil-|philo]]-[[sophia (wisdom)|sophia]]). This permeates Plato's [[dialogues]], especially ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', in which the leaders of his proposed [[utopia]] are to be [[philosopher king]]s, rulers who understand the [[Form of the Good]] and possess the courage to act accordingly. [[Aristotle]], in his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', defined wisdom as the understanding of [[Causality|causes]], i.e. knowing why things are a certain way, which is deeper than merely knowing that things are a certain way.&lt;ref&gt;But note that two thousand years after Aristotle, Isaac Newton was forced to [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|admit that]] "I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity"&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it was Aristotle who first made a distinction between ''phronesis'' and ''sophia'' aspects of wisdom.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;

The [[ancient Romans]] also valued wisdom. It was personified in [[Minerva]], or Pallas. She also represents skillful knowledge and the virtues, especially chastity. Her symbol was the owl which is still a popular representation of wisdom, because it can see in darkness. She was said to be born from Jupiter's forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Myths about Roman goddess minerva. (n.d.)|url=http://www.roman-colosseum.info/roman-gods/myths-about-the-roman-goddess-minerva.htm|publisher=Roman-colosseum.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wisdom is also important within [[Christianity]]. [[Jesus]] emphasized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/11-19.htm|title=Matthew 11:19 (KJV): "The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children|publisher=Bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/matthew/10-16.htm|title=Matthew 10:16 (KJV): "Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves|publisher=Bible.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul the Apostle]], in his [[first epistle to the Corinthians]], argued that there is both secular and divine wisdom, urging Christians to pursue the latter. [[Prudence]], which is intimately related to wisdom, became one of the four [[cardinal virtues]] of [[Catholicism]]. The Christian philosopher [[Thomas Aquinas]] considered wisdom to be the "father" (i.e. the cause, measure, and form) of all virtues.

In Buddhist traditions, developing wisdom plays a central role where comprehensive guidance on how to develop wisdom is provided.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html|title= The Noble Eightfold Path|accessdate=2009-03-16|publisher=Access to Insight|last=Bhikkhu Bodhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Inuit]] tradition, developing wisdom was one of the aims of teaching. An Inuit [[Elder (administrative title)|Elder]] said that a person became wise when they could see what needed to be done and do it successfully without being told what to do. In many cultures, the name for third molars, which are the last teeth to grow, is etymologically linked with wisdom, e.g., as in the English ''[[wisdom tooth]]''.

== Educational perspectives ==
[[File:Jacob de Wit - Allegorie op het schrijven van de geschiedenis 1754.jpg|thumb|''Truth and Wisdom assist History in writing'' by [[Jacob de Wit]], 1754]]

Public schools [[Education in the United States|in the US]] have an approach to character education. Eighteenth century philosophers such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], referred to this as training wisdom and virtue. Traditionally, schools share the responsibility to build character and wisdom along with parents and the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Ed.gov|date=31 May 2005|title=Character education: our shared responsibility|url=http://www2.ed.gov/admins/lead/character/brochure.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Maxwell]], a contemporary philosopher in the United Kingdom, advocates that [[academia]] ought to alter its focus from the acquisition of knowledge to seeking and promoting wisdom, &lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Maxwell]] (2007) [http://www.pentirepress.plus.com/#wisdom From Knowledge to Wisdom]. Pentire Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which he defines as the capacity to realize what is of value in life, for oneself and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/friends-of-wisdom], Friends of Wisdom "an association of people sympathetic to the idea that academic inquiry should help humanity acquire more wisdom by rational means" founded by Maxwell.&lt;/ref&gt; He teaches that new knowledge and technological [[know-how]] increase our power to act which, without wisdom, may cause human suffering and death as well as human benefit. Wisdom is the application of knowledge to attain a positive goal by receiving instruction in governing oneself&lt;ref&gt;Simandan D. 2011. The wise stance in human geography.

== Psychological perspectives ==
Psychologists have gathered data on commonly held beliefs or folk theories about wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J. (1985). Implicit theories of intelligence, creativity, and wisdom. Journal of Personality and Social [[Psychology]], 49, 607–62.&lt;/ref&gt; These analyses indicate that although "there is an overlap of the implicit theory of wisdom with intelligence, perceptiveness, spirituality and shrewdness, it is evident that wisdom is an expertise in dealing with difficult questions of life and adaptation to the complex requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = S.

It is achieved when in a concrete situation, a balance between intrapersonal, inter- personal and institutional interests can be prepared".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2937249 | pmid=20233730 | doi=10.1093/geront/gnq022 | volume=50 | title=Expert consensus on characteristics of wisdom: a Delphi method study | date=October 2010 | journal=Gerontologist | pages=668–80 | last1 = Jeste | first1 = DV | last2 = Ardelt | first2 = M | last3 = Blazer | first3 = D | last4 = Kraemer | first4 = HC | last5 = Vaillant | first5 = G | last6 = Meeks | first6 = TW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Problem Solving with [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]] and sustainable actions.
* Contextual, [[sincerity]] to the circumstances with knowledge of its negative and positive aspects (or constraints).
* Value based consistent actions with knowledge of diversity in ethical [[opinion]]s.
* Tolerance towards uncertainty in life with unconditional acceptance.
* Empathy with oneself to understand one's own emotions (or to be emotionally oriented), morals...etc. and others feelings including the ability to see oneself as part of a larger whole.

Wisdom leads a person to overcome feelings of helplessness, powerlessness, anger or aggression by non-understanding of external elements and internal acknowledgement. It leads to a change from the experience of meaninglessness to meaningful goals, prospects for coping with critical life events and to engage constructively with complex life problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferrari|first=Michel|title=The Scientific Study of Personal Wisdom |year=2012 |publisher=Springer Verlag|isbn=978-9048192304}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Vervaeke has argued through ''cognitive science of wisdom'' that, when basic [[relevance realization]] processes that underlie cognition is fed back onto themselves and made self-referential/differentiated reflection with the problems facing and its dimensions, leads to enhanced insight abilities associated with wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vervaeke|first=John|title=The Cognitive Science of Wisdom|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti4Kj8TcEgk|publisher=Mind Matters Conference|accessdate=13 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sternberg|first=Robert J.|authorlink=Robert Sternberg|title=Wisdom, Intelligence, and Creativity Synthesized|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2003|location=New York|isbn=0-521-80238-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has segregated the capacity for judgement from the general qualifiers for intelligence, which is closer to cognizant aptitude than to wisdom. Displaying sound judgement in a complex, dynamic environment is a hallmark of wisdom.

&lt;!--A graduate in psychology with field experience might understand this. But I suggest the following valuable "Dr. B. Legesse" paragraph of excessive abstraction be re-written.--&gt;
Dr. B. Legesse et al., a neuropsychiatrist at [[McLean Hospital]]/[[Harvard Medical School]], offers "a theoretical definition that takes into account many cultural, religious, and philosophical themes is that wisdom represents a demonstrated superior ability to understand the nature and behavior of things, people, or events." He states "this results in an increased ability to predict behavior or events which then may be used to benefit self or others." He furthermore adds "there is more often a desire to share the accrued benefits with a larger group for the purpose of promoting survival, cohesion, or well-being of that group. The benefits do not result from malicious or antisocial intents or inequitable behavior. Environmental factors, such as family, education, socioeconomic status, culture, and religion, are involved in generating the milieu in which the personal value system develops. Many of these same factors also influence how a given community decides whether wisdom is present or not. This model of wisdom relies on the individual's ability to generate a mental representation of the self (cognitive, emotional, and physical), the external world, and the dynamic relationship of the self with the external world." Dr. Legesse proposes that "the neural (brain) systems critical to enable these functions are distributed but heavily dependent on those that support [[memory]], learning, understanding other people's mental states ([[Theory of Mind]]), and assigning relative value to information." The neuroanatomy of wisdom he says depends on "the three frontosubcortical neural networks, the [[limbic]] system, and the [[mirror neuron]] system" which "are of particular importance for supporting these activities."&lt;ref&gt;Legesse B, Price BH., Murray ED Brain-Behavior Relations. In: Encyclopedia of Human Behavior, 2nd Edition. Vilanayur S Ramachandran MD PhD(ed) Academic Press. 16 March 2012. {{ISBN|978-0123750006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the need to distinguish two very different “levels of analyses” has been proposed as being important especially when one attempts to describe wisdom using neural anatomy.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal|author= Karunamuni N.D.|title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind|journal=SAGE open|volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 | url= http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf | doi=10.1177/2158244015583860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sapience ==
{{redirect-distinguish|Sapience|Sentience}}
{{see|artificial intelligence|sentience|self-awareness|consciousness}}

Sapience is closely related to the term "''sophia''" often defined as "transcendent wisdom", "ultimate reality", or the ultimate truth of things.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aggregates "/&gt; Sapiential perspective of wisdom is said to lie in the heart of every religion, where it is often acquired through intuitive knowing.&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt; This type of wisdom is described as going beyond mere practical wisdom and includes self-knowledge, interconnectedness, conditioned origination of mind-states and other deeper understandings of subjective experience.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trowbridge2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2015"/&gt; This type of wisdom can also lead to the ability of an individual to act with appropriate [[Value judgement|judgement]], a broad understanding of situations and greater appreciation/compassion towards other living beings.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

The word ''sapience'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''sapientia'', meaning "wisdom".&lt;ref name="LewisShortLatinDictionary"&gt;{{cite book|title=Latin Dictionary|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1963|isbn=978-0-19-864201-5|author1=Lewis, C.T.  |author2=Short, C. |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The corresponding verb ''sapere'' has the original meaning of "to taste", hence "to perceive, to discern" and "to know"; its present participle ''sapiens'' was chosen by [[Carl Linnaeus]] for the [[Latin binomial]] for the human species, ''[[Homo sapiens]]''.

=== Ancient Near East ===
In [[Mesopotamian mythology|Mesopotamian religion and mythology]], [[Enki]], also known as Ea, was the God of wisdom and intelligence. Wisdom was achieved by restoring balance.

[[Sia (god)|Sia]] represents the personification or god of wisdom in the traditional mythology adhered to in [[Ancient Egypt]].

=== Hebrew Bible and Judaism ===
{{See also|Chokhmah|Wisdom literature}}
The word wisdom (חכם) is mentioned 222 times in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. It was regarded as one of the highest virtues among the Israelites along with kindness (חסד) and justice (צדק). Both the books of [[Book of Proverbs|Proverbs]] and [[Psalms]] urge readers to obtain and to increase in wisdom.

In the [[Hebrew Bible]], wisdom is represented by [[Solomon]], who asks God for wisdom in {{bibleref2|2 Chronicles|1:10}}. Much of the [[Book of Proverbs]], a book of [[Proverb|wise sayings]], is attributed to Solomon. In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|9:10}}, the fear of [[YHWH]] is called the beginning of wisdom. In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|1:20}}, there is also reference to wisdom personified in female form, "Wisdom calls aloud in the streets, she raises her voice in the marketplaces." In {{bibleref2|Proverbs|8:22–31}}, this personified wisdom is described as being present with God before creation began and even taking part in creation itself.

The [[Talmud]] teaches that a wise person is a person who can foresee the future. ''Nolad'' is the Hebrew word for "future," but also the Hebrew word for ''birth'', so one rabbinic interpretation of the teaching is that a wise person is one who can foresee the consequences of his/her choices (i.e. can "see the future" that he/she "gives birth" to).&lt;ref&gt;[[David Wolpe|Wolpe, David]], perf.

{{Further information|Sophiology|Sophia (wisdom)}}
In [[Christian theology]], "wisdom" (From [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: ''[[חכמה]]'' transliteration: chokmâh pronounced: khok-maw', [[Greek language|Greek]]: ''Sophia'', [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Sapientia'') describes an aspect of God, or the [[Theology|theological]] concept regarding the wisdom of [[God]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

There is an oppositional element in Christian thought between [[secular]] wisdom and Godly wisdom. [[Paul the Apostle]] states that worldly wisdom thinks the claims of [[Christ]] to be foolishness. However, to those who are "on the path to salvation" Christ represents the wisdom of God. ({{bibleref|1|Corinthians|1:17–31}}) Also, Wisdom is one of the [[seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] according to Anglican, Catholic, and Lutheran belief. {{bibleref|1|Corinthians|12:8–10}} gives an alternate list of nine virtues, among which wisdom is one.

The book of Proverbs in the Old Testament of the Bible primarily focuses on wisdom, and was primarily written by one of the wisest kings according to Jewish history, King Solomon. Proverbs is found in the Old Testament section of the Bible and is written in a sort of poetic way, giving direction on how to handle various aspects of life; one's relationship with God, marriage, dealing with finances, work, friendships and persevering in difficult situations faced in life. Also the nature of Wisdom as being female.

And through God's wise aide, one can have a better life: "He holds success in store for the upright, he is a shield to those whose walk is blameless, for he guards the course of the just and protects the way of his faithful ones" Proverbs 2:7-8. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways submit to him, and he will make your paths straight" Proverbs 3:5-6. Solomon basically states that with the wisdom one receives from God, one will be able to find success and happiness in life.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bible.org/seriespage/7-god-and-man-proverbs|title=7. God and Man in Proverbs|newspaper=Bible.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various verses in Proverbs that contain parallels of what God loves, which is wise, and what God does not love, which is foolish. For example in the area of good and bad behaviour Proverbs states, "The way of the wicked is an abomination to the Lord, But He loves him who pursues righteousness (Proverbs 15:9). In relation to fairness and business it is stated that, "A false balance is an abomination to the Lord, But a just weight is His delight" (Proverbs 11:1; cf. 20:10,23). On the truth it is said, "Lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, But those who deal faithfully are His delight" (12:22; cf. 6:17,19). These are a few examples of what, according to Solomon, are good and wise in the eyes of God, or bad and foolish, and in doing these good and wise things, one becomes closer to God by living in an honorable and kind manner.

&lt;ref name="christianity.about.com"/&gt; King Solomon continues his teachings of wisdom in the book of Ecclesiastes, which is considered one of the most depressing books of the Bible. Solomon discusses his exploration of the meaning of life and fulfillment, as he speaks of life's pleasures, work, and materialism, yet concludes that it is all meaningless. "‘Meaningless! Meaningless!" says the Teacher [Solomon]. ‘Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless’…For with much wisdom comes much sorrow, the more knowledge, the more grief" (Ecclesiastes 1:2,18) Solomon concludes that all life's pleasures and riches, and even wisdom, mean nothing if there is no relationship with God.

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insight.org/resources/bible/the-general-epistles/james|title=Book of James Overview - Insight for Living Ministries|website=www.insight.org|access-date=2016-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book of James, written by the apostle James, is said to be the New Testament version of the book of Proverbs, in that it is another book that discusses wisdom. It reiterates Proverbs message of wisdom coming from God by stating, "If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding fault, and it will be given to you." James 1:5. James also explains how wisdom helps one acquire other forms of virtue, "But the wisdom that comes from heaven is first of all pure; then peace-loving, considerate, submissive, full of mercy and good fruit, impartial and sincere." James 3:17. In addition, James focuses on using this God-given wisdom to perform acts of service to the less fortunate.

Apart from Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and James, other main books of wisdom in the Bible are Job, Psalms, and 1 and 2 Corinthians, which give lessons on gaining and using wisdom through difficult situations.

=== Indian religions ===
{{see|Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā (Hinduism)|Prajnaparamita}}
Developing wisdom is of central importance in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] traditions, where the ultimate aim is often presented as “seeing things as they are” or as gaining a “penetrative understanding of all phenomena,” which in turn is described as ultimately leading to the “complete freedom from suffering.”&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt; In Buddhism, developing wisdom is accomplished through an understanding of what are known as the Four Noble Truths and by following the Noble Eightfold Path.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bhikkhu Bodhi"/&gt; This path lists [[mindfulness]] as one of eight required components for cultivating wisdom.&lt;ref name="Karunamuni2017"/&gt;

Buddhist scriptures teach that a wise person is usually endowed with good and maybe bodily conduct, and sometimes good verbal conduct, and good mental conduct.(''[[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 3:2'') A wise person does actions that are unpleasant to do but give good results, and doesn’t do actions that are pleasant to do but give bad results (''AN 4:115''). Wisdom is the [[antidote]] to the self-chosen [[poison]] of [[ignorance]]. The [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] has much to say on the subject of wisdom including:
* He who arbitrates a case by force does not thereby become just (established in [[Dhamma]]). But the wise man is he who carefully discriminates between right and wrong.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Dhammapada]]'' v. 256&lt;/ref&gt;
* He who leads others by nonviolence, righteously and equitably, is indeed a guardian of justice, wise and righteous.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 257&lt;/ref&gt;
* One is not wise merely because he talks much. But he who is calm, free from hatred and fear, is verily called a wise man.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 258&lt;/ref&gt;
* By quietude alone one does not become a [[Wise old man|sage]] (muni) if he is foolish and ignorant. But he who, as if holding a pair of scales, takes the good and shuns the evil, is a wise man; he is indeed a muni by that very reason. He who understands both good and evil as they really are, is called a true sage.&lt;ref&gt;''Dhammapada'' v. 268–9&lt;/ref&gt;
To recover the original supreme wisdom of self-nature covered by the self-imposed three dusty poisons (greed, anger, ignorance) Buddha taught to his students the threefold training by turning greed into generosity and discipline, anger into kindness and meditation, ignorance into wisdom. As the Sixth Patriarch of Chán Buddhism, Huineng, said in his Platform Sutra,"Mind without dispute is self-nature discipline, mind without disturbance is self-nature meditation, mind without ignorance is self-nature wisdom."

In [[Hinduism]], wisdom is considered a state of mind and soul where a person achieves [[Moksha|liberation]].

The god of wisdom is [[Ganesha]] and the goddess of knowledge is [[Saraswati]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

:Lead me from death to immortality.
:May there be peace, peace, and perfect peace".
::[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] 1.3.28.

Wisdom in Hinduism is knowing oneself as the truth, basis for the entire Creation, i.e., of ''Shristi''.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} In other words, wisdom simply means a person with [[Self-awareness]] as the one who witnesses the entire creation in all its facets and forms. Further it means realization that an individual through right conduct and right living over an unspecified period comes to realize their true relationship with the creation and the ''[[Paramatma]]'' who rules it.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

=== Islam ===
{{main|Hikmah}}
The Arabic term corresponding to Hebrew ''[[Chokmah]]'' is {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:حكمة|حكمة]]}} ''ḥikma''.
The term occurs a number of times in the [[Quran]], notably in [[Sura 2]]:269:
"[[God in Islam|He]] gives wisdom to whom He wills, and whoever has been given wisdom has certainly been given much good. And none will remember except those of understanding." ({{cite quran|2|269|s=ns}}).
and [[Sura 22]]:46: "Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind."{{cite quran|22|46|s=ns}}
[[Sura 6]]: 151: "Say: "Come, I will rehearse what Allah (God) hath (really) prohibited you from": Join not anything as equal with Him; be good to your parents; kill not your children on a plea of want;― We provide sustenance for you and for them;― come not nigh to shameful deeds, whether open or secret; take not life, which Allah hath made sacred, except by way of justice and law: thus doth He command you, that ye may learn wisdom" ({{cite quran|6|151|s=ns}}).

=== Chinese religion ===
{{refimprove section|small=y|date=March 2016}}
The Buddhist term ''[[Prajñā (Buddhism)|Prajñā]]'' was translated [[Chinese Buddhism|into Chinese]] as
{{lang|zh|智慧}} (pinyin ''zhìhuì'', characters [[:wikt:智|智]] "knowledge" and [[:wikt:慧|慧]] "bright, intelligent")&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Wisdom and foresight in Chinese thought: sensing the immediate future. Journal of Futures Studies. 22(3), pp. 35-50. https://doi.org/10.6531/JFS.2018.22(3).00A35&lt;/ref&gt;.

According to the ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', [[Confucius]] said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Love of learning is akin to wisdom. To practice with vigor is akin to humanity. To know to be shameful is akin to courage (zhi, ren, yong.. three of [[Mencius|Mengzi]]'s sprouts of virtue)."{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Compare this with the Confucian classic ''[[Great Learning]]'', which begins with: "The Way of learning to be great consists in manifesting the clear character, loving the people, and abiding in the highest good." One can clearly see the correlation with the Roman virtue [[prudence]], especially if one interprets "clear character" as "clear conscience". (From [[Chinese Chán|Chan's Sources]] of [[Chinese Philosophy]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In [[Taoism]], wisdom is construed as adherence to the [[Three Treasures (Taoism)]]: charity, simplicity, and humility.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}
"He who knows other men is discerning [智]; he who knows himself is intelligent [明]." ({{lang|zh|知人者智，自知者明。}}[[Tao Te Ching]] 33)&lt;ref&gt;[http://ctext.org/dao-de-jing Chinese Text Project], trans. James Legge.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Others ===
In [[Norse mythology]], the god [[Odin]] is especially known for his wisdom, often acquired through various hardships and ordeals involving pain and self-sacrifice. In one instance he plucked out an eye and offered it to [[Mímir]], guardian of the well of knowledge and wisdom, in return for a drink from the well.&lt;ref name=Faulkes&gt;Faulkes, Anthony (transl. and ed.) (1987). ''[[Prose Edda|Edda]]'' ([[Snorri Sturluson]]). [[Everyman's Library|Everyman]]. {{ISBN|0-460-87616-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In another famous account, Odin hanged himself for nine nights from [[Yggdrasil]], the [[World Tree]] that unites all the [[Norse cosmology|realms of existence]], suffering from hunger and thirst and finally wounding himself with a spear until he gained the knowledge of [[runic alphabet|runes]] for use in casting powerful [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Larrington, Carolyne (transl. and ed.) (1996). ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. [[Oxford World's Classics]]. {{ISBN|0-19-283946-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to acquire the [[mead of poetry]] from the [[Jötunn|giants]], a drink of which could grant the power of a scholar or [[skald|poet]], for the benefit of [[Æsir|gods]] and mortals alike.&lt;ref name=Faulkes/&gt;

In [[Bahá'í]] scripture, 
"The essence of wisdom is the fear of God, the dread of His scourge and punishment, and the apprehension of His justice and decree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bahai Reference Library|url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/TB/tb-11.html|work=Tablets of Bahá’u’lláh Revealed After the Kitáb-i-Aqdas|publisher=US Bahá’í Publishing Trust, 1988 pocket-size edition|accessdate=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wisdom is seen as a light, that casts away darkness, and "its dictates must be observed under all circumstances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Browne|first=ʻAbduʹl-Bahá ; translated by Edward G.|title=A traveler's narrative.|year=1980|publisher=Bahá'i Publ. Trust|location=Wilmette, Ill.|isbn=0877431345|page=46|edition=New and corr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One may obtain knowledge and wisdom through God, his Word, and his [[Manifestation of God|Divine Manifestation]] and the source of all learning is the knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Esslemont|first=J.E.|title=Bahá'u'lláh and the new era : an introduction to the Bahá'í faith|year=2006|publisher=Bahá'í Pub.
