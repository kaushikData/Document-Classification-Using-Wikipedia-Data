=== Solar Photovoltaic Programme (SPV) ===
Under this programme, ANERT distributes devices which use [[solar energy]]. These include [[solar lantern]]s, home lighting systems, [[street light]] systems, TV [[Battery pack|power packs]], and [[vaccine refrigerator]]s. These devices are distributed in accordance with MNRE and other programmes using ANERT funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ANERT plans 10,000 roof-top solar panels in Kerala|journal=The Economic Times|date=Feb 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solar Thermal Energy Programme ===
The Solar Thermal Energy Programme aims to supplement [[thermal energy]] requirements at various temperatures for different applications; they include cooking, [[water heater|water heating]], heating for industrial processes, crop drying, space heating, and water [[desalination]]. Programme processes include harnessing solar energy from the Sun and converting it into heat energy using various solar thermal devices and systems.

===  Wind Energy Programme ===
ANERT is in the process of increasing [[wind power]] usage at different locations within the state. In association with MNRE, the agency has conducted a detailed study of the wind potential in Kerala. Its largest capacity [[wind farm]] is located at [[Kanjikode]], in [[Palakkad District]]; it has a capacity of 22 MW&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/State-seeks-to-raise-wind-energy-output-by-25-MW/article17072093.ece|title=State seeks to raise wind energy output by 25 MW|date=2017-01-21|work=The Hindu|access-date=2018-03-31|last1=Nandakumar|first1=T.|language=en-IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12033">{{About|computers composed of biological parts|computation inspired by biology|Bio-inspired computing|hypothetical computers using brain-to-brain interfaces|Brain–brain interface}}'''Bio computers''' use systems of biologically derived molecules—such as [[DNA]] and [[proteins]]—to perform computational [[calculation]]s involving storing, retrieving, and processing [[data]].

The development of biocomputers has been made possible by the expanding new science of [[nanobiotechnology]]. The term nanobiotechnology can be defined in multiple ways; in a more general sense, nanobiotechnology can be defined as any type of technology that uses both nano-scale materials (i.e. materials having characteristic dimensions of 1-100 [[nanometer]]s) and biologically based materials.&lt;ref&gt;Wispelway. June. "Nanobiotechnology: The Integration of Nanoengineering and Biotechnology to the Benefit of Both." Society for Biological Engineering (Special Section):  Nanobiotechnology, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; A more restrictive definition views nanobiotechnology more specifically as the design and engineering of proteins that can then be assembled into larger, functional structures&lt;ref&gt;Ratner. Daniel and Mark.  Nanotechnology: A Gentle Introduction to the Next Big Idea. Pearson Education. Inc: 2003, p. 116-7&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Gary Stix.  "Little Big Science." Understanding Nanotechnology (p6-16). Scientific American. Inc. and Byron Preiss Visual Publications. Inc:  2002, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;
The implementation of nanobiotechnology, as defined in this narrower sense, provides scientists with the ability to engineer [[biomolecular]] systems specifically so that they interact in a fashion that can ultimately result in the computational functionality of a [[computer]].

== Scientific background ==
Biocomputers use biologically derived materials to perform computational functions. A biocomputer consists of a pathway or series of metabolic pathways involving biological materials that are engineered to behave in a certain manner based upon the conditions (input) of the system. The resulting pathway of reactions that takes place constitutes an output, which is based on the engineering design of the biocomputer and can be interpreted as a form of computational analysis. Three distinguishable types of biocomputers include biochemical computers, biomechanical computers, and bioelectronic computers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Freitas. Robert A.

Biochemical computers use the immense variety of feedback loops that are characteristic of biological [[chemical reactions]] in order to achieve computational functionality.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Windmiller|first1=Joshua|title=Molecular scale biocomputing : an enzyme logic approach|date=June 2012|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/519217jp#}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feedback loops in biological systems take many forms, and many different factors can provide both positive and negative feedback to a particular biochemical process, causing either an increase in chemical output or a decrease in chemical output, respectively. Such factors may include the quantity of catalytic enzymes present, the amount of reactants present, the amount of products present, and the presence of molecules that bind to and thus alter the chemical reactivity of any of the aforementioned factors. Given the nature of these biochemical systems to be regulated through many different mechanisms, one can engineer a chemical pathway comprising a set of molecular components that react to produce one particular product under one set of specific chemical conditions and another particular product under another set of conditions. The presence of the particular product that results from the pathway can serve as a signal, which can be interpreted—along with other chemical signals—as a computational output based upon the starting chemical conditions of the system (the input).

=== Biomechanical computers ===
Biomechanical computers are similar to biochemical computers in that they both perform a specific operation that can be interpreted as a functional computation based upon specific initial conditions which serve as input. They differ, however, in what exactly serves as the output signal. In biochemical computers, the presence or concentration of certain chemicals serves as the output signal. In biomechanical computers, however, the [[Mechanics|mechanical]] shape of a specific molecule or set of molecules under a set of initial conditions serves as the output. Biomechanical computers rely on the nature of specific molecules to adopt certain physical configurations under certain chemical conditions. The mechanical, three-dimensional structure of the product of the biomechanical computer is detected and interpreted appropriately as a calculated output.

=== Bioelectronic computers ===
Biocomputers can also be constructed to perform electronic computing. Again, like both biomechanical and biochemical computers, computations are performed by interpreting a specific output that is based upon an initial set of conditions that serve as input. In bioelectronic computers, the measured output is the nature of the [[electrical conductivity]] that is observed in the bioelectronic computer.  This output comprises specifically designed biomolecules that conduct [[electricity]] in highly specific manners based upon the initial conditions that serve as the input of the bioelectronic system.

== Engineering biocomputers ==
The behavior of biologically derived computational systems such as these relies on the particular molecules that make up the system, which are primarily proteins but may also include DNA molecules.  Nanobiotechnology provides the means to synthesize the multiple chemical components necessary to create such a system. The chemical nature of a protein is dictated by its sequence of [[amino acids]]—the chemical building blocks of proteins. This sequence is in turn dictated by a specific sequence of DNA [[nucleotides]]—the building blocks of DNA molecules. Proteins are manufactured in biological systems through the translation of [[nucleotide]] sequences by biological molecules called [[ribosomes]], which assemble individual amino acids into polypeptides that form functional proteins based on the nucleotide sequence that the ribosome interprets. What this ultimately means is that one can engineer the chemical components necessary to create a biological system capable of performing computations by engineering DNA nucleotide sequences to encode for the necessary protein components. Also, the synthetically designed DNA molecules themselves may function in a particular biocomputer system. Thus, implementing nanobiotechnology to design and produce synthetically designed proteins—as well as the design and synthesis of artificial DNA molecules—can allow the construction of functional biocomputers (e.g. [[Computational Genes]]).

Biocomputers can also be designed with cells as their basic components.  [[Chemically induced dimerization]] systems can be used to make [[logic gate]]s from individual cells. These logic gates are activated by chemical agents that induce interactions between previously non-interacting proteins and trigger some observable change in the cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miyamoto|first=T|author2=DeRose.

== Economics ==
All biological [[organisms]] have the ability to self-replicate and self-assemble into functional components. The [[economical]] benefit of biocomputers lies in this potential of all biologically derived systems to self-replicate and self-assemble given appropriate conditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|349}} For instance, all of the necessary proteins for a certain biochemical pathway, which could be modified to serve as a biocomputer, could be synthesized many times over inside a biological cell from a single DNA molecule.  This DNA molecule could then be replicated many times over. This characteristic of biological molecules could make their production highly efficient and relatively inexpensive. Whereas electronic computers require manual production, biocomputers could be produced in large quantities from cultures without any additional machinery needed to assemble them.

== Notable advancements in biocomputer technology ==
Currently, biocomputers exist with various functional capabilities that include operations of "binary " [[logic]] and mathematical calculations.&lt;ref name="escholarship.org"/&gt;  [[Tom Knight (scientist)|Tom Knight]] of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory first suggested a biochemical computing scheme in which protein concentrations are used as [[binary numeral system|binary]] signals that ultimately serve to perform logical operations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|349}}  At or above a certain concentration of a particular biochemical product in a biocomputer chemical pathway indicates a signal that is either a 1 or a 0.  A concentration below this level indicates the other, remaining signal. Using this method as computational analysis, biochemical computers can perform logical operations in which the appropriate binary output will occur only under specific logical constraints on the initial conditions. In other words, the appropriate binary output serves as a logically derived conclusion from a set of initial conditions that serve as premises from which the logical conclusion can be made. In addition to these types of logical operations, biocomputers have also been shown to demonstrate other functional capabilities, such as mathematical computations. One such example was provided by W.L. Ditto, who in 1999 created a biocomputer composed of leech neurons at Georgia Tech which was capable of performing simple addition.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{Rp|351}} These are just a few of the notable uses that biocomputers have already been engineered to perform, and the capabilities of biocomputers are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Because of the availability and potential economic efficiency associated with producing biomolecules and biocomputers—as noted above—the advancement of the technology of biocomputers is a popular, rapidly growing subject of research that is likely to see much progress in the future.

In March 2013. a team of [[bioengineer]]s from [[Stanford University]], led by [[Drew Endy]], announced that they had created the biological equivalent of a [[transistor]], which they dubbed a "[[transcriptor]]".  The invention was the final of the three components necessary to build a fully functional computer: [[data storage device|data storage]], information transmission, and a basic [[logic family|system of logic]].&lt;ref name=IO9&gt;{{cite news|title=This new discovery will finally allow us to build biological computers|author=Robert T.

== Future potential of biocomputers ==
Many examples of simple biocomputers have been designed, but the capabilities of these biocomputers are very limited in comparison to commercially available non-bio computers. Some people believe that biocomputers have great potential, but this has yet to be demonstrated.

A '''blowout''' is the uncontrolled release of [[crude oil]] and/or [[natural gas]] from an [[oil well]] or [[gas well]] after pressure control systems have failed.&lt;ref name="Allabout"&gt;'All About Blowout', R. Westergaard, Norwegian Oil Review, 1987 {{ISBN|82-991533-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern wells have [[blowout preventer]]s intended to prevent such an occurrence. An accidental spark during a blowout can lead to a catastrophic [[oil well fire|oil or gas fire]].

Prior to the advent of pressure control equipment in the 1920s, the uncontrolled release of oil and gas from a well while drilling was common and was known as an '''oil gusher''', '''gusher''' or '''wild well'''.

== History ==
Gushers were an icon of [[oil exploration]] during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. During that era, the simple drilling techniques such as [[drilling rig#Cable tool drilling|cable-tool drilling]] and the lack of [[blowout preventer]]s meant that drillers could not control high-pressure reservoirs. When these high pressure zones were breached, the oil or natural gas would travel up the well at a high rate, forcing out the drill string and creating a gusher. A well which began as a gusher was said to have "blown&amp;nbsp;in": for instance, the [[Lakeview Gusher]] ''blew&amp;nbsp;in'' in 1910. These uncapped wells could produce large amounts of oil, often shooting 200&amp;nbsp;feet (60&amp;nbsp;m) or higher into the air.&lt;ref name="sjgs.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sjgs.com/lakeview.html |title=www.sjgs.com |publisher=www.sjgs.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061019100520/http://www.sjgs.com/lakeview.html |archivedate=2006-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A blowout primarily composed of natural gas was known as a ''gas&amp;nbsp;gusher''.

Despite being symbols of new-found wealth, gushers were dangerous and wasteful.  They killed workmen involved in drilling, destroyed equipment, and coated the landscape with thousands of [[Oil barrel|barrels]] of oil; additionally, the explosive concussion released by the well when it pierces an oil/gas reservoir has been responsible for a number of oilmen losing their hearing entirely;  standing too near to the drilling rig at the moment it drills into the oil reservoir is extremely hazardous.  The impact on wildlife is very hard to quantify, but can only be estimated to be mild in the most optimistic models—realistically, the ecological impact is estimated by scientists across the ideological spectrum to be severe, profound, and lasting.&lt;ref name="duration"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1990171,00.html |title=Gulf Oil Spill: Scientists Escalate Environmental Warnings |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |work=Time |first=Bryan |last=Walsh |date=2010-05-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100629041941/http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1990171,00.html |archivedate=June 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, the free flowing oil was—and is—in danger of igniting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rootsweb.com/~txnavarr/business/oil_industry/hughes_and_mckie_oil_well_fire/index.htm |title=Hughes McKie Oil Well Explosion |publisher=Rootsweb.com |date=1923-05-08 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225221428/http://www.rootsweb.com/~txnavarr/business/oil_industry/hughes_and_mckie_oil_well_fire/index.htm |archivedate=2008-02-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One dramatic account of a blowout and fire reads,

&lt;blockquote&gt;With a roar like a hundred express trains racing across the countryside, the well blew out, spewing oil in all directions. The derrick simply evaporated. Casings wilted like lettuce out of water, as heavy machinery writhed and twisted into grotesque shapes in the blazing inferno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aoghs.org/technology/end-of-gushers/ |title=Ending Oil Gushers - BOP &amp;#124; |publisher=Aoghs.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20160131233652/http://aoghs.org/technology/end-of-gushers/ |archivedate=2016-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The development of rotary drilling techniques where the density of the [[drilling fluid]] is sufficient to overcome the downhole pressure of a newly penetrated zone meant that gushers became avoidable. If however the fluid density was not adequate or fluids were lost to the formation, then there was still a significant risk of a well blowout.

In 1924 the first successful [[blowout preventer]] was brought to market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/First_RamType_Blowout.cfm |title=Engineering History |publisher=Asme.org |date=1905-03-10 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226061733/http://www.asme.org/Communities/History/Landmarks/First_RamType_Blowout.cfm |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The BOP valve affixed to the [[wellhead]] could be closed in the event of drilling into a high pressure zone, and the well fluids contained. [[Well control]] techniques could be used to regain control of the well.  As the technology developed, blowout preventers became standard equipment, and gushers became a thing of the past.

In the modern petroleum industry, uncontrollable wells became known as blowouts and are comparatively rare.  There has been significant improvement in technology, well control techniques, and personnel training which has helped to prevent their occurring.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt; From 1976 to 1981, 21 blowout reports are available.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt;

=== Notable gushers ===
#The earliest known oil gusher, in 1815, actually resulted from an attempt to drill for salt, not for oil. Joseph Eichar and his team were digging west of the town of Wooster, Ohio, along Killbuck Creek, when they struck oil. In a written retelling by Eichar's daughter, Eleanor, the strike produced "a spontaneous outburst, which shot up high as the tops of the highest trees!"&lt;ref name="1815_gusher"&gt;{{cite book

#Oil drillers struck a number of gushers near [[Oil City, Pennsylvania]] in 1861. The most famous was the '''Little &amp; Merrick well''', which began gushing oil on 17 April 1861. The spectacle of the fountain of oil flowing out at about {{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day had drawn about 150 spectators by the time an hour later when the oil gusher burst into flames, raining fire down on the oil-soaked onlookers. Thirty people died. Other early gushers in northwest Pennsylvania were the '''Phillips #2''' ({{convert|4000|oilbbl|m3}} per day) in September 1861, and the '''Woodford well''' ({{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day) in December 1861.&lt;ref&gt;''The Derrick's Hand-Book of Petroleum'' (Oil City, Penn.: Derrick Publishing, 1898) 20–24.&lt;/ref&gt; 
#The '''Shaw Gusher''' in [[Oil Springs, Ontario]], was Canada's first oil gusher. On January 16, 1862, it shot oil from over {{convert|60|m}} below ground to above the treetops at a rate of {{convert|3000|oilbbl|m3}} per day, triggering the oil boom in Lambton County.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oilsprings.ca/todo.htm |title=The Shaw Gusher |publisher=The Village of Oil Springs |accessdate=2011-02-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206005118/http://www.oilsprings.ca/todo.htm |archivedate=2009-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Lucas Gusher''' at [[Spindletop]] in [[Beaumont, Texas]] in 1901 flowed at {{convert|100000|oilbbl|m3}} per day at its peak, but soon slowed and was capped within nine days.

#'''[[Dos Bocas oil fire|Dos Bocas]]'''  in the State of Veracruz, Mexico, was a famous 1908 Mexican blowout that formed a large crater. It leaked oil from the main reservoir for many years, continuing even after 1938 (when [[Pemex]] nationalized the Mexican oil industry).
#'''[[Lakeview Gusher]]''' on the [[Midway-Sunset Oil Field]] in [[Kern County, California]] of 1910 is believed to be the largest-ever U.S. gusher.

[[Petroleum]] or crude oil is a naturally occurring, flammable liquid consisting of a complex mixture of [[hydrocarbons]] of various molecular weights, and other organic compounds, that are found in [[geologic formation]]s beneath the Earth's surface. Because most hydrocarbons are lighter than rock or water, they often migrate upward and occasionally laterally through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as reservoirs) by impermeable rocks above. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an oil field forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by drilling and pumping. The down hole pressure in the rock structures changes depending upon the depth and the characteristic of the [[source rock]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} [[Natural gas]] (mostly [[methane]]) may be present also, usually above the oil within the reservoir, but sometimes dissolved in the oil at reservoir pressure and temperature.  This dissolved gas often evolves as free gas as the pressure is reduced either under controlled production operations or in a kick or in an uncontrolled blowout.  The hydrocarbon in some reservoirs may be essentially all natural gas.

===Formation kick===
The downhole fluid pressures are controlled in modern wells through the balancing of the [[hydrostatic pressure]] provided by the [[Drilling fluid|mud]] column. Should the balance of the drilling mud pressure be incorrect (i.e., the mud pressure gradient is less than the formation pore pressure gradient), then formation fluids (oil, natural gas and/or water) can begin to flow into the wellbore and up the annulus (the space between the outside of the [[drill string]] and the wall of the open hole or the inside of the [[casing (borehole)|casing]]), and/or inside the [[drill pipe]]. This is commonly called a ''kick''. Ideally, mechanical barriers such as [[blowout preventer]]s (BOPs) can be closed to isolate the well while the hydrostatic balance is regained through circulation of fluids in the well. But if the well is not shut in (common term for the closing of the blow-out preventer), a kick can quickly escalate into a blowout when the formation fluids reach the surface, especially when the influx contains gas that expands rapidly with the reduced pressure as it flows up the wellbore, further decreasing the effective weight of the fluid.

Early warning signs of an impending well kick while drilling are:
* Sudden change in drilling rate;
* Reduction in drillpipe weight;
* Change in pump pressure;
* Change in drilling fluid return rate.

Other warning signs during the drilling operation are:
* Returning mud "cut" by (i.e., contaminated by) gas, oil or water;
* Connection gases, high background gas units, and high bottoms-up gas units detected in the mudlogging unit.&lt;ref&gt;Grace, R: ''Blowout and Well Control Handbook'', page 42.  Gulf Professional Publishing, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary means of detecting a kick while drilling is a relative change in the circulation rate back up to the surface into the mud pits. The drilling crew or mud engineer keeps track of the level in the mud pits and/or closely monitors the rate of mud returns versus the rate that is being pumped down the drill pipe. Upon encountering a zone of higher pressure than is being exerted by the hydrostatic head of the drilling mud (including the small additional frictional head while circulating) at the bit, an increase in mud return rate would be noticed as the formation fluid influx blends in with the circulating drilling mud.  Conversely, if the rate of returns is slower than expected, it means that a certain amount of the mud is being lost to a thief zone somewhere below the last [[casing shoe]]. This does not necessarily result in a kick (and may never become one); however, a drop in the mud level might allow influx of formation fluids from other zones if the hydrostatic head at is reduced to less than that of a full column of mud.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Well control===
The first response to detecting a kick would be to isolate the wellbore from the surface by activating the blow-out preventers and closing in the well. Then the drilling crew would attempt to circulate in a heavier ''kill fluid'' to increase the hydrostatic pressure (sometimes with the assistance of a [[well control]] company). In the process, the influx fluids will be slowly circulated out in a controlled manner, taking care not to allow any gas to accelerate up the wellbore too quickly by controlling casing pressure with chokes on a predetermined schedule.

This effect will be minor if the influx fluid is mainly salt water. And with an oil-based drilling fluid it can be masked in the early stages of controlling a kick because gas influx may dissolve into the oil under pressure at depth, only to come out of solution and expand rather rapidly as the influx nears the surface. Once all the contaminant has been circulated out, the shut-in casing pressure should have reached zero.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Capping stacks are used for controlling blowouts.  The cap is an open valve that is closed after bolted on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jwco.com/technical-litterature/p10.htm |title=Blowout Control, Part 10 – Surface Intervention Methods |publisher=Jwco.com |date= |accessdate=2016-01-30 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203170305/http://www.jwco.com/technical-litterature/p10.htm |archivedate=2016-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of blowouts==
[[File:IXTOC I oil well blowout.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ixtoc I]] oil well blowout]]
Well blowouts can occur during the drilling phase, during [[Well test (oil and gas)|well testing]], during well [[Completion (oil and gas wells)|completion]], during production, or during [[workover]] activities.&lt;ref name="Allabout"/&gt;

===Surface blowouts===
Blowouts can eject the [[drill string]] out of the well, and the force of the escaping fluid can be strong enough to damage the [[drilling rig]]. In addition to oil, the output of a well blowout might include natural gas, water, drilling fluid, mud, sand, rocks, and other substances.

Blowouts will often be ignited from sparks from rocks being ejected, or simply from heat generated by friction. A well control company then will need to extinguish the well fire or cap the well, and replace the casing head and other surface equipment. If the flowing gas contains poisonous [[hydrogen sulfide]], the oil operator might decide to ignite the stream to convert this to less hazardous substances.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Sometimes blowouts can be so forceful that they cannot be directly brought under control from the surface, particularly if there is so much energy in the flowing zone that it does not deplete significantly over time. In such cases, other wells (called [[relief well]]s) may be drilled to intersect the well or pocket, in order to allow kill-weight fluids to be introduced at depth. When first drilled in the 1930s relief wells were drilled to inject water into the main drill well hole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 "Wild Oil Well Tamed by Scientific Trick" ''Popular Mechanics'', July 1934] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180503160212/https://books.google.com/books?id=LeADAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 |date=2018-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what might be inferred from the term, such wells generally are not used to help relieve pressure using multiple outlets from the blowout zone.

===Subsea blowouts===
[[Image:Deepwater Horizon offshore drilling unit on fire 2010.jpg|right|thumb|[[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Macondo-1 well blowout on the Deepwater Horizon rig]], 21 April 2010]]
The two main causes of a subsea blowout are equipment failures and imbalances with encountered subsurface reservoir pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Subsea Well Containment and Incident Response Work?|url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?i_id=360|website=Rigzone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418011815/http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?i_id=360|archivedate=2015-04-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Subsea]] wells have pressure control equipment located on the seabed or between the riser pipe and drilling platform. [[Blowout preventer]]s (BOPs) are the primary safety devices designed to maintain control of geologically driven well pressures. They contain hydraulic-powered cut-off mechanisms to stop the flow of hydrocarbons in the event of a loss of well control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Drilling Blowout Preventers|url=https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/drilling/wellcontrol_bop.html|publisher=United States Department of Labor|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630005923/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/etools/oilandgas/drilling/wellcontrol_bop.html|archivedate=2015-06-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even with blowout prevention equipment and processes in place, operators must be prepared to respond to a blowout should one occur. Before drilling a well, a detailed well construction design plan, an Oil Spill Response Plan as well as a Well Containment Plan must be submitted, reviewed and approved by BSEE and is contingent upon access to adequate well containment resources in accordance to NTL 2010-N10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NTL No. 2010-N10 |url=http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/ |website=BSEE.gov |publisher=US Department of the Interior Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930171506/http://www.bsee.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Notices-to-Lessees/2010/10-n10/ |archivedate=2015-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Deepwater Horizon well blowout]] in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010 occurred at a {{convert|5000|ft|m}} water depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Macondo Prospect, Gulf of Mexico, United States of America|url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/macondoprospect/|website=Offshore Technology|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/67AQEfANm?url=http://www.offshore-technology.com/projects/macondoprospect/|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current blowout response capabilities in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico meet capture and process rates of 130,000 barrels of fluid per day and a gas handling capacity of 220 million cubic feet per day at depths through 10,000 feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HWCG Expands Capabilities to Minimize Potential Impact of a Deepwater Incident|url=http://www.hwcg.org/pressreleases/2015/3/12/hwcg-expands-capabilities-to-minimize-potential-impact-of-a-deepwater-incident|website=HWCG.org|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304081507/http://www.hwcg.org/pressreleases/2015/3/12/hwcg-expands-capabilities-to-minimize-potential-impact-of-a-deepwater-incident|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground blowouts===
An underground blowout is a special situation where fluids from high pressure zones flow uncontrolled to lower pressure zones within the wellbore.  Usually this is from deeper higher pressure zones to shallower lower pressure formations. There may be no escaping fluid flow at the wellhead. However, the formation(s) receiving the influx can become overpressured, a possibility that future drilling plans in the vicinity must consider.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Blowout control companies==
[[Myron M. Kinley]] was a pioneer in fighting oil well fires and blowouts. He developed many patents and designs for the tools and techniques of oil firefighting. His father, Karl T. Kinley, attempted to extinguish an oil well fire with the help of a massive explosion—a method that remains a common technique for fighting oil fires. The first oil well put out with explosives by Myron Kinley and his father, was in 1913.&lt;ref name="Boots"&gt;Boots &amp; Coots History Page : {{cite web |url=http://www.boots-coots.com/members/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526031912/http://www.boots-coots.com/members/history.html |archivedate=2010-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kinley would later form the M.M. Kinley Company in 1923.&lt;ref name="Boots" /&gt; Asger "Boots" Hansen and Edward Owen "Coots" Matthews also begin their careers under Kinley.

[[Red Adair|Paul N. "Red" Adair]] joined the M.M. Kinley Company in 1946, and worked 14 years with Myron Kinley before starting his own company, Red Adair Co., Inc., in 1959.

Red Adair Co. has helped in controlling offshore blowouts, including:
* [[CATCO fire]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] in 1959
* "The [[Devil's Cigarette Lighter]]" in 1962 in [[Gassi Touil]], Algeria, in the [[Sahara Desert]]
* The [[Ixtoc I oil spill]] in Mexico's [[Bay of Campeche]] in 1979
* The [[Piper Alpha]] disaster in the [[North Sea]] in 1988
* The [[Kuwaiti oil fires]] following the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redadair.com/hisstory.html|title=redadair.com|author=|date=|website=www.redadair.com|accessdate=3 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717184126/http://www.redadair.com/hisstory.html|archivedate=17 July 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1968 American film, ''[[Hellfighters (film)|Hellfighters]]'', which starred John Wayne, is about a group of oil well firefighters, based loosely on the life of Adair, who served as a technical advisor on the film, along with his associates, "Boots" Hansen, and "Coots" Matthews.

In 1994, Adair retired and sold his company to Global Industries. Management of Adair's company left and created [[International Well Control]] (IWC). In 1997, they would buy the company [[Boots &amp; Coots|Boots &amp; Coots International Well Control, Inc.]], which was founded by Hansen and Matthews in 1978.

==Methods of quenching blowouts==

===Subsea Well Containment===
[[File:Figure 2- Subsea Well Containment Response Equipment (7045774079) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Government Accountability Office]] diagram showing subsea well containment operations]]
After the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Macondo-1 blowout on the Deepwater Horizon]], the offshore industry collaborated with government regulators to develop a framework to respond to future subsea incidents. As a result, all energy companies operating in the deep-water U.S. Gulf of Mexico must submit an OPA 90 required Oil Spill Response Plan with the addition of a Regional Containment Demonstration Plan prior to any drilling activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance to Owners and Operators of Offshore Facilities Seaward of the Coast Line Concerning Regional Oil Spill Response Plans (NTL No. 2012-N06)|url=http://www.bsee.gov/uploadedFiles/BSEE/Regulations_and_Guidance/Notices_to_Lessees/2012/NTL2012-N06.pdf|website=BSEE.gov|publisher=Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004013/http://www.bsee.gov/uploadedFiles/BSEE/Regulations_and_Guidance/Notices_to_Lessees/2012/NTL2012-N06.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event of a subsea blowout, these plans are immediately activated, drawing on some of the equipment and processes effectively used to contain the Deepwater Horizon well as well as others that have been developed in its aftermath.

In order to regain control of a subsea well, the Responsible Party would first secure the safety of all personnel on board the rig and then begin a detailed evaluation of the incident site. [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle]]s (ROVs) would be dispatched to inspect the condition of the wellhead, [[Blowout Preventer]] (BOP) and other subsea well equipment. The debris removal process would begin immediately to provide clear access for a capping stack.

Once lowered and latched on the wellhead, a capping stack uses stored hydraulic pressure to close a hydraulic ram and stop the flow of hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Madrid|first1=Mauricio|last2=Matson|first2=Anthony|title=How Offshore Capping Stacks Work|journal=Society of Petroleum Engineers: The Way Ahead|date=2014|volume=10|issue=1|url=http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2014/2014v10n1/13_Tech101_v10n1.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151129101843/http://www.spe.org/twa/print/archives/2014/2014v10n1/13_Tech101_v10n1.pdf|archivedate=2015-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If shutting in the well could introduce unstable geological conditions in the wellbore, a cap and flow procedure would be used to contain hydrocarbons and safely transport them to a surface vessel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Does Subsea Well Containment and Incident Response Work?|url=http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=360&amp;c_id=17|website=Rigzone.com|publisher=Rigzone|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150909215623/http://www.rigzone.com/training/insight.asp?insight_id=360&amp;c_id=17|archivedate=2015-09-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Responsible Party works in collaboration with [[Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement|BSEE]] and the [[United States Coast Guard]] to oversee response efforts, including source control, recovering discharged oil and mitigating environmental impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memoranda of Agreement Between the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement and U.S. Coast Guard (MOA: OCS-03)|url=http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=85899347659|publisher=BSEE/USCG|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425065259/http://www.bsee.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=85899347659|archivedate=2015-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several not-for-profit organizations provide a solution to effectively contain a subsea blowout. [[HWCG LLC]] and [[Marine Well Containment Company]] operate within the U.S. Gulf of Mexico&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Deepwater Horizon Spurs Development of Spill Prevention Systems|url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/106319/Deepwater_Horizon_Spurs_Development_of_Spill_Prevention_Systems|publisher=Rigzone|date=April 20, 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908051133/http://www.rigzone.com/news/oil_gas/a/106319/Deepwater_Horizon_Spurs_Development_of_Spill_Prevention_Systems|archivedate=September 8, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; waters, while cooperatives like Oil Spill Response Limited offer support for international operations.

===Use of nuclear explosions===
On Sep. 30, 1966 the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Urta-Bulak]], an area about 80 kilometers from [[Bukhara]], [[Uzbekistan]], experienced blowouts on five natural gas wells.  It was claimed in Komsomoloskaya Pravda that after years of burning uncontrollably they were able to stop them entirely.&lt;ref name="pravda-nuke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http://www.kp.ru/daily/24482/640124/&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;hl=&amp;ie=UTF-8|title=Google Translate|author=|date=|website=translate.google.com|accessdate=3 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Soviets lowered a specially made 30 kiloton nuclear bomb into a {{convert|6|km|ft}} borehole drilled {{convert|25|to|50|m|ft}} away from the original (rapidly leaking) well.  A nuclear explosive was deemed necessary because conventional explosive both lacked the necessary power and would also require a great deal more space underground.  When the bomb was set off, it crushed the original pipe that was carrying the gas from the deep reservoir to the surface and glassified all the surrounding rock.  This caused the leak and fire at the surface to cease within approximately one minute of the explosion, and proved over the years to have been a permanent solution.   A second attempt on a similar well was not as successful and other tests were for such experiments as oil extraction enhancement (Stavropol, 1969) and the creation of gas storage reservoirs (Orenburg, 1970).&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpPNQoTlacU|title=An Atomic Bomb will stop the Gulf Oil Leak, LOOK!|first=|last=CineGraphic|date=4 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=3 May 2018|via=YouTube|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107094802/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpPNQoTlacU|archivedate=7 November 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3344">'''Construction Operations Building Information Exchange''' ('''COBie''') is an international standard relating to managed asset information including space and equipment. It is closely associated with [[building information modeling]] (BIM) approaches to design, construction and management of built assets, and was devised by Bill East of the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]], who authored a pilot standard in June 2007.&lt;ref name=East2007&gt;{{cite web |last=East|first=E. William|title=Construction Operation Building Information Exchange|url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA491932|publisher=USACE ERDC|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBie helps capture and record important project data at the point of origin, including equipment lists, product data sheets, warranties, spare parts lists, and preventive maintenance schedules. This information is essential to support operations, maintenance and asset management once the built asset is in service.&lt;ref name=NIBSe-news&gt;{{cite web |last=East|first=William|title=Corps of Engineers Pilots COBie|url=http://www.nibs.org/page/0612_COE_COBie/|work=Building Sciences Monthly e-Newsletter|publisher=NIBS|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In December 2011, it was approved by the US-based [[National Institute of Building Sciences]] as part of its National Building Information Model (NBIMS-US) standard.&lt;ref name=ERDC&gt;{{cite web|title=CERL’s COBie is National Institute of Building Sciences Approved|url=http://erdc.usace.army.mil/news-2011/cerls-cobie-is-national-institute-of-building-sciences-approved/|work=Engineer Research &amp; Development Center|publisher=ERDC|accessdate=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20121212025312/http://erdc.usace.army.mil/news-2011/cerls-cobie-is-national-institute-of-building-sciences-approved/#|archive-date=2012-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COBie has been incorporated into software for planning, design, construction, commissioning, operations, maintenance, and asset management. COBie may take several approved formats include spreadsheet, STEP-Part 21 (also called [[Industry Foundation Classes|IFC]] file format), and ifcXML.  In early 2013 [[BuildingSMART]] was working on a lightweight XML format for COBie, COBieLite, which became available for review in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=East|first=Bill|title=COBieLite: A lightweight XML format for COBie data|url=http://buildingsmartalliance.org/index.php/projects/cobielite/|publisher=National Institute of Building Sciences|accessdate=27 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, a code of practice regarding COBie was issued as a British Standard: "[[BS 1192]]-4:2014 Collaborative production of information Part 4: Fulfilling employer’s information exchange requirements using COBie – Code of practice".&lt;ref name=1192-4&gt;{{cite web|title=BS 1192-4:2014 Collaborative production of information.

A [[carbon]] button lamp contains a small carbon sphere positioned in the center of an evacuated glass bulb.  This type of lamp must be driven by high-frequency [[alternating current]], and depends on an [[electric arc]] or perhaps a [[vacuum arc]] to produce high [[electric current|current]] around the carbon electrode.  The carbon electrode is then heated to [[incandescence]] by collisions by ions which constitute the electric current.  Tesla found that these lamps could be used as powerful sources of [[ionizing radiation]].

In February, 1892, Tesla gave a lecture to the Institution of Electrical Engineers, in which he described the carbon button lamp in detail.  He also described several variants of the lamp, one of which uses a [[ruby]] drop in place of the carbon button.

[[Image:Carpetbag.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Reconstruction-era]] carpet bag]]

A '''carpet bag''' is a traveling bag made of [[carpet]], commonly from an [[oriental rug]]. They were a popular form of [[luggage]] in the United States and Europe in the 19th century. Some modern versions serve as [[handbag]]s or purses.

== History ==

The carpet bag was invented as a type of [[baggage]] light enough for a passenger to carry, like a [[duffel bag]], as opposed to a wooden or metal [[Trunk (luggage)|trunk]], which required the assistance of [[Porter (carrier)|porters]]. It was a good traveling companion: in 1886, the ''[[Scientific American]]'' described it as old-fashioned and reliable: the carpet bag "is still unsurpassed by any, where rough wear is the principal thing to be studied. Such a bag, if constructed of good [[Brussels]] carpeting and unquestionable workmanship, will last a lifetime, provided always that a substantial frame is used."&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American Supplement, No. 561, October 2, 1886 ebook: John T. Humphrey "Useful Bags and How to Make Them" Pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Its use implied self-sufficiency: in [[Jules Verne]]'s 1873 novel ''[[Around the World in Eighty Days]]'', [[Phileas Fogg]] and [[Passepartout (character)|Passepartout]] bring only a carpet bag as luggage, which holds a few items of clothing and a great deal of cash.

Carpet bags used to be made of [[Oriental rug]]s or the Brussels carpet referred to above, meaning one with "a heavy pile formed by uncut loops of wool on a linen warp".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/brussels-carpet&lt;/ref&gt; Carpet was the chosen material because it was a popular domestic accent piece and the "remainder" pieces were easily bought. In a sense, the carpet bag was a sustainable invention because it used remnants of materials which otherwise would have gone unused.

Carpet bags sometimes also served as a "railway rug", a common item in the 19th century for warmth in drafty, unheated rail-cars. The rug could either be opened as a blanket, or latched up on the sides as a traveling bag. From [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[:s:The Annotated 'Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes'|Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879): "... my railway-rug, which, being also in the form of a bag, made me a double castle for cold nights."&lt;ref&gt;''Robert Luis Stevens, "Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes" (1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern examples ==
[[File:JT Carpetbag.jpg|thumb|1964 carpet bag]]
A popular carpet bag brand of the mid 1960s (known as "the California Carpetbagger") is Jerry Terrence: The Original Carpet Bag, or JT Carpet Bag.&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune, "Jerry Terrence brings back his popular bags from the '60s for a new generation" (February 13, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;  The company encouraged the use of brand new carpet material.&lt;ref&gt;The Salt Lake Tribune, "Jerry Terrence brings back his popular bags from the '60s for a new generation" (February 13, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural impact ==

The [[carpetbagger]]s of the [[Reconstruction Era]] following the [[American Civil War]]—Northerners who moved to the South for economic or political opportunity—were given their name from this type of luggage which they carried.

The fictional nanny [[Mary Poppins]] arrived clutching her magical carpetbag, a [[Motif (narrative)|motif]] in both the series of children's novels and in [[Mary Poppins (film)|the famous 1964 film]].

The Magic Bag of Tricks in the [[Felix the Cat]] cartoons resembles a carpetbag.

It is generally known as "cementless concrete".&lt;ref&gt;http://gtresearchnews.gatech.edu/newsrelease/coal-ash.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Fly ash is an unwanted [[pollutant]] that is a byproduct mainly of [[Coal combustion products|coal combustion]] in [[Fossil-fuel power station|coal-fired power plants]], cement production, paper manufacturing, and mining operations. In addition to its role as an environmental-friendly construction material, it is as strong as concrete at lower [[specific gravity]]. Its [[tensile strength]] is one third of its [[compressive strength]]. The tensile strength in traditional concrete is around one tenth. That means that the material requires less [[rebar|reinforcement]].

Retrieved 8 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''circle hook''' is a type of [[fish hook]] which is sharply curved back in a circular shape. It has become widely used among [[Fisherman|anglers]] in recent years because the hook generally catches more fish and is rarely swallowed.&lt;ref&gt;Prince ED, Ortiz M and Venizelos A (2002) [http://www.abmt.vi/PrincePDF/P3.pdf "A comparison of circle hook and" J" hook performance in recreational catch-and-release fisheries for billfish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217002529/http://www.abmt.vi/PrincePDF/P3.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }} ''American Fisheries Society Symposium'' '''30''': 66–79.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the circle hook catches the fish on the lips at the corner of its mouth, it usually decreases the mortality rates of released fish as compared to J-hook (like O'Shaughnessy or Octopus hooks) which are often swallowed by the fish, causing damage to the [[gills]] or [[vital organs]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooke SJ and Suski CD (2004) [http://www.news-press.com/assets/pdf/A483941829.PDF "Are circle hooks an effective tool for conserving marine and freshwater recreational catch-and-release fisheries?"]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Aquatic Conservation: Marine and Freshwater Ecosystems'', '''14''': 299–326. {{doi|10.1002/aqc.614}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The circle hook's shape allows it to only hook onto an exposed surface, which in the case of a fish means the corner of its mouth.  The fish takes the baited hook and swallows it, and as the hook is reeled in, it is safely pulled out of the fish until it reaches the mouth.  At this point it will catch the corner of the mouth, resulting in fewer gut-hooked fish.

It is important to not strike (or [[hookset|set the hook]]) when the fish bites, but rather just reel in. The act of striking while using a circle hook often results in the hook being pulled out of the fish altogether.

Studies have shown that circle hooks do less damage to [[billfish]] than the traditional [[Fish hook|J-hooks]], yet they are at just as effective for catching billfish. This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.&lt;ref&gt;Prince ED, Ortiz M, and Venizelos A (2002) [http://www.abmt.vi/PrincePDF/P3.pdf "A Comparison of Circle Hook and “J” Hook Performance in Recreational Catch-and-Release Fisheries for Billfish"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217002529/http://www.abmt.vi/PrincePDF/P3.pdf |date=2012-02-17 }} ''American Fisheries Society Symposium 30'', pp. xxx–xxx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Prince ED, Snodgrass D, Orbesen ES |year=2007 |url=http://eee.rsmas.miami.edu/assets/pdfs/mbf/fac/Serafy/52-Prince%20et%20al.%202007%20Sailfish%20Circle%20Hooks.pdf |title=Circle hooks,'J' hooks and drop‐back time: a hook performance study of the south Florida recreational live‐bait fishery for sailfish, ''Istiophorus platypterus'' |journal=Fisheries Management and Ecology |volume=14 |pages=173–182 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2400.2007.00539.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory''' ('''CSHL''') is a private, non-profit institution with research programs focusing on cancer, [[neuroscience]], plant biology, [[genomics]], and [[quantitative biology]].&lt;ref&gt;As described here: [http://www.cshl.edu] and here: [http://www.cshl.edu/Annual-Reports/2012-annual-report]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is one of 68 institutions supported by the [[NCI-designated Cancer Center|Cancer Centers Program]] of the U.S. [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI) and has been an NCI-designated Cancer Center since 1987.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cancercenters.cancer.gov/cancer_centers/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is one of a handful of institutions that played a central role in the development of molecular genetics and [[molecular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;Horace Freedland Judson, ''The Eighth Day of Creation: The Makers of the Revolution in Biology'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1979), esp. pp. 65-69; also: 44-46; 53; 57-58; 62; 70; 82; 185; 232; 239; 247; 273; 321; 368; 392; 454; 458-59; 572-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been home to eight scientists who have been awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. CSHL is ranked among the leading [[basic research]] institutions in molecular biology and genetics with Thomson Reuters ranking it #1 in the world.&lt;ref&gt;See Thompson Reuters Essential Science Indicators, [http://archive.sciencewatch.com/dr/sci/08/may25-08_4/]. The ranking is based on average citation frequency of faculty research papers published between January 2002 and December 2012. (96.94 citations of each CSHL paper, average.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Laboratory is led by [[Bruce Stillman]], a biochemist and cancer researcher.

Since its inception in 1890, the institution's campus on the [[North Shore (Long Island)|North Shore]] of [[Long Island]] has also been a center of biology education. Current CSHL educational programs serve professional scientists, doctoral students in biology, teachers of biology in the K-12 system, and students from the elementary grades through high school. In the past 10 years CSHL conferences &amp; courses have drawn over 81,000 scientists and students to the main campus.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|title=CSHL Facts &amp; Figures - About Us|author=WebServices|publisher=|access-date=2014-03-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322050319/https://www.cshl.edu/About-Us/Facts-Figures|archive-date=2014-03-22|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, many scientists consider CSHL a "crossroads of biological science."&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D., current director of the U.S. National Institutes of Health: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/genome-research/competition-science/competition-human-genome-project-public-vs-private/]; Nobel laureate Sydney Brenner: [http://library.cshl.edu/oralhistory/interview/cshl/special-aspects/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-center-science/]; Nobel laureate Eric Kandel, M.D., referring to the institutional setting of CSHL's graduate school: [http://www.cshl.edu/Archive/watson-school-of-biological-sciences-culminates-commencement-weekend-conferring-degrees-on-its-fifth-graduating-class]; See also:  R. Sanders Williams, "Sputnik, Slime Molds, and Botticelli in the Making of a Physician-Scientist," in David A. Schwartz, ed., Medicine, Science and Dreams: The Making of Physician-Scientists (Springer, 2010, p. 103.)&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2009 CSHL has partnered with the [[Suzhou Industrial Park]] in [[Suzhou]], China to create '''Cold Spring Harbor Asia''' which annually draws some 3,000 scientists to its meetings and courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csh-asia.org/overview.html|title=CSH Asia Overview|website=www.csh-asia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, CSHL announced a strategic affiliation with the nearby [[Northwell Health]] to  advance cancer therapeutics research, develop a new clinical cancer research unit at Northwell Health in [[Lake Success, New York|Lake Success]], NY, to support early-phase clinical studies of new cancer therapies, and recruit and train more clinician-scientists in oncology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cshl.edu/news-and-features/cold-spring-harbor-laboratory-and-north-shore-lij-announce-strategic-affiliation-to-accelerate-benefits-of-cancer-research-to-patients.html|title=CSHL Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and North Shore-LIJ announce strategic affiliation to accelerate benefits of cancer research to patients - News &amp; Features|author=Dagnia Zeidlickis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSHL hosts [[bioRxiv]], the preprint repository for biologists.

==Educational programs==
[[File:Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory sign.jpg|thumb|Sign at the entrance at 500 Sunnyside Blvd.]]
In addition to its research mission, CSHL has a broad educational mission. The Watson School of Biological Sciences (WSBS), established in 1998, awards the Ph.D. degree and fully funds the research program of every student. Students are challenged to obtain their doctoral degree in 4–5 years.  The Undergraduate Research Program (URP) for gifted college students (established in 1959), and the Partners for the Future Program for advanced high school students (established in 1990) are now hosted at the WSBS.

The CSHL Meetings &amp; Courses Program brings over 8,500 scientists from around the world to Cold Spring Harbor annually to share research results – mostly unpublished—in 60 meetings, most held biannually; and to learn new technologies in 30 to 35 professional courses, most offered annually.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  The Cold Spring Harbor Symposium series, held every year since 1933 with the exception of three years during the Second World War, has been a forum for researchers in genetics, genomics, neuroscience and plant biology. At the Banbury Center, about 25-30 discussion-style meetings are held yearly for a limited number of invited participants. As of 2016 a two-week course at CSHL costs between $3,700 and $4,700 per student and a three-day conferences cost about $1,000 per attendee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://meetings.cshl.edu/courseshome.aspx|title=CSHL Courses|website=meetings.cshl.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNA Learning Center (DNALC), founded in 1988, was among the early pioneers&lt;ref&gt;See early DNALC annual reports: 1985: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1985.pdf]; and 1988: [http://www.dnalc.org/files/pdf/annreppdf/annrep1988.pdf]. For the educational milieu at the time hands-on learning caught on nationally, see: Kyle, Jr. W.C., Bonnstetter, R.J., McClosky, J. &amp; Fults, B.A. (1985). "What Research Says: Science through discovery: Students love it," ''Science and Children'', 23 (2), 39-41; Lumpe, A.T. &amp; Oliver, J.S. (1991) "Dimensions of Hands-on Science," ''The American Biology Teacher'', 53 (6), 345-348; Rutherford, F. J. &amp; Ahlgren, A. (1990), ''Science for All Americans'' (New York: Oxford University Press), p. 186ff.; Schmieder, A.A. &amp; Michael-Dyer, G. (1991)., "State of the scene of science education in the nation," Paper presented at the Public Health Service National Conference, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; in developing hands-on genetics lab experiences for middle and high school students.  In 2013, 31,000 students on Long Island and New York City were taught genetics labs at the DNALC and satellite facilities in New York. Over 9,000 high school biology teachers have participated in DNALC teacher-training programs.&lt;ref&gt;DNA Learning Center, 2013 Annual Report, in press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press]] has established a program consisting of seven journals, 190 books, laboratory manuals and protocols, and online services for research preprints.&lt;ref name="cshl.edu"/&gt;

==Funding==
In 2015, CSHL had an operating budget of $150 million, over $100 million of which was spent on research.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cshl.edu/images/stories/about_us/pdfs/2013-CSHL-factsheet.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Half of the research budget was devoted to cancer; 25% to neuroscience; 15% to genomics and quantitative biology; and 10% to plant sciences.  The sources of research funding in 2015 were: 34% Federal (primarily [[National Institutes of Health]] and [[National Science Foundation]]); 26% auxiliary activities; 22% private philanthropy; 10% endowment; 3% corporate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Founding and early years==
The institution took root as The Biological Laboratory in 1890, a summer program for the education of college and high school teachers studying zoology, botany, comparative anatomy and nature. The program began as an initiative of Eugene G. Blackford and [[Franklin Hooper]], director of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, the founding institution of [[The Brooklyn Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Watson |first=Edith L. |title=Houses for Science: a Pictorial History of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory |year=1991 |publisher=CSHL Press, 1991 |pages=20–23 |isbn=9780879694036 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KQHhyobFZfwC&amp;pg=PA20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] established the '''Station for Experimental Evolution''' at Cold Spring Harbor on an adjacent parcel. In 1921, the station was reorganized as the Carnegie Institution Department of Genetics.

Between 1910 and 1939, the laboratory was the base of the [[Eugenics Record Office]] of biologist [[Charles B. Davenport]] and his assistant [[Harry H. Laughlin]], two prominent [[American eugenicists]] of the period.  Davenport was director of the Carnegie Station from its inception until his retirement in 1934. In 1935 the Carnegie Institution sent a team to review the ERO's work, and as a result the ERO was ordered to stop all work. In 1939 the Institution withdrew funding for the ERO entirely, leading to its closure. The ERO's reports, articles, charts, and pedigrees were considered scientific facts in their day, but have since been discredited. However, its closure came 15 years after its findings were incorporated into the National Origins Act ([[Immigration Act of 1924]]), which severely reduced the number of immigrants to America from southern and eastern Europe who, Harry Laughlin testified, were racially inferior to the Nordic immigrants from England and Germany. Charles Davenport was also the founder and the first director of the [[International Federation of Eugenics Organizations]] in 1925. Today, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory maintains the full historical records, communications and artifacts of the ERO for historical,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Daniel J. Kevles]], ''In the Name of Eugenics: Genetics and the Uses of Human Heredity'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1985); [[Elof A.

Carnegie Institution scientists at Cold Spring Harbor made many contributions to genetics and medicine. In 1908 [[George H. Shull]] discovered hybrid corn and the genetic principle behind it called [[heterosis]],  or "hybrid vigor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = THE SIGNIFICANCE OF LATENT CHARACTERS | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 646| pages = 792–794 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.646.792 | pmid = 17810906 | bibcode = 1907Sci....25..792H }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Shull | first1 = GH | year = 1907 | title = SOME LATENT CHARACTERS OF A WHITE BEAN | url = | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 25 | issue = 647| pages = 828–832 | doi = 10.1126/science.25.647.828-b | pmid = 17828973 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This would become the foundation of modern agricultural genetics.

Bates and Simon W. Dykshorn "A New Hormone of the Anterior Pituitary," ''[[Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med.]]'' 1932; xxix: 1211-1212.&lt;/ref&gt; and Wilbur Swingle participated in the discovery of [[adrenocortical hormone]], used to treat [[Addison's disease]].

==History==
[[Milislav Demerec]] was named director of the Laboratory in 1941. Demerec shifted the Laboratory's research focus to the genetics of microbes, thus setting investigators on a course to study the biochemical function of the gene. During World War Two, Demerec directed efforts at Cold Spring Harbor that resulted in major increases in penicillin production.&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. Patent 2,445,748 (July 27, 1948). Demerec used x-ray mutagenesis to produce a high-yielding strain of ''Penicillium'' mold.  This facilitated a fivefold increase in penicillin production.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1941, and annually from 1945, three of the seminal figures of molecular genetics convened summer meetings at Cold Spring Harbor of what they called the [[Phage Group]]. [[Salvador Luria]],  of Indiana University; [[Max Delbrück]],  then of Vanderbilt University; and [[Alfred Hershey]],  then of Washington University, St. Louis, sought to discover the nature of genes through study of viruses called bacteriophages that infect bacteria.

* In 1945, Delbrück's famous Phage Course was taught for the first time, inspiring, among others, a young [[James D. Watson]]; it was repeated for many years after. CSH Symposia important in the cross-fertilization of ideas among molecular biology's pioneers were held in 1951, 1953, 1956, 1961, 1963, and 1966.&lt;ref&gt;"Coming of Phage: Celebrating the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Phage Course," Pamphlet, 14 pp., 1995.  Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;   
* At the CSH Symposium in summer 1953, Watson made the first public presentation of DNA's double-helix structure.

'''Nobel Prize winners'''
* In 1944 [[Barbara McClintock]] discovered [[transposons]] ("jumping genes"), for which she received a [[Nobel Prize]] in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1983/] See the classic paper McClintock B 1951 "Chromosome Organization and Genic Expression" (''Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol'' 16: 13-47).&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In 1952 the "Waring blender [[Hershey–Chase experiment|experiments]]" of [[Alfred Hershey]] and [[Martha Chase]] confirmed DNA as the genetic material.&lt;ref&gt;A.D. Hershey and Martha Chase, "Independent Functions of Viral Protein and Nucleic Acid in Growth of Bacteriophage," ''[[J. General Physiology]]'' (September 20, 1952) 36:1, 39-56.&lt;/ref&gt;   Hershey shared a Nobel Prize with Salvador Luria and Max Delbrück in 1969, "for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watson, CSHL Director from 1968 to 1993, shared a Nobel Prize with [[Francis Crick]] and [[Maurice Wilkins]] in 1962 for their discovery of the double helix structure of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1962/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1962|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Richard J. Roberts]] and [[Phillip A. Sharp]] shared a Nobel in 1993 for the discovery of discontinuous, or "split" genes, which revealed the [[RNA splicing]] mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1993/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Carol Greider]], who in 1992 discovered a relationship between cellular aging and damage to the ends of chromosomes, called [[telomeres]], shared a Nobel Prize in 2009 with [[Elizabeth Blackburn]] and [[Jack W. Szostak]] for their work on telomere biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2009/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
In 1962, the Department of Genetics, no longer supported by the Carnegie Institution of Washington, formally merged with the Biological Laboratory to form the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology. In 1970, the name was simplified to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.

James D. Watson served as the Laboratory's director and president for 35 years. Upon  taking charge in 1968, he focused the Laboratory on cancer research, creating a tumor virus group and successfully obtaining federal funds for an expansion of cancer research capabilities. Watson placed CSHL on a firm financial footing. Inspired by his Nobel collaborator, Francis Crick, Watson initiated a major push to scale-up CSHL research on the brain and psychiatric disorders, beginning in the late 1980s.  In 1990, work was completed on the [[Arnold and Mabel Beckman]] Laboratory, and the Marks Neuroscience Building was opened in 1999.  In 1994, Watson ceased being director of the Laboratory and assumed the title of president. In 2004 he was named chancellor, a position he held until October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cshl.edu/Non-Research-Faculty/james-d-watson.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  when he  retired at the age of 79 after views attributed to him on [[race and intelligence]] appeared in the British press.&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Africans-45]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James watson#cite note-Suspension-46]]&lt;/ref&gt; He is now chancellor emeritus.

Since 1994 biochemist and cancer biologist [[Bruce Stillman]] has led the Laboratory as director, and since 2003 as president. Stillman, a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]], also continues to run a basic research lab, devoted to the study of DNA replication and chromosome maintenance. Stillman is credited with the 1991 discovery and elucidation of the mechanism of the [[Origin Recognition Complex]] (ORC), a highly conserved protein complex that recognizes and binds to specific DNA sequences, marking starting points for replication of the entire genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 8939847 | volume=274 | title=Cell cycle control of DNA replication | date=December 1996 | journal=Science | pages=1659–64 | last1 = Stillman | first1 = B | doi=10.1126/science.274.5293.1659| bibcode=1996Sci...274.1659S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stillman has presided over a major expansion of the Laboratory, its size growing threefold since he became director. With construction completed on six linked laboratory buildings on the Hillside Campus in 2009, CSHL added much-needed new laboratory space for cancer and neuroscience research, as well as space for a new program on quantitative biology to bring experts in mathematics, computer science, statistics, and physics to problems in biology.

'''Compete America, The Alliance for a Competitive Workforce,''' is a coalition representing corporations, universities, research institutions and trade associations that advocates for reform of U.S. [[immigration policy]] for highly educated foreign professionals.

Compete America supports the idea that scientists, researchers, innovators and engineers will always be in demand and will always drive economic growth and job creation, whether American or foreign-born.&lt;ref name=about&gt;http://www.competeamerica.org/about/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of this, they argue that arbitrarily low visa quotas and massive backlogs in the system plague the employment- based visa process.

Compete America's legislative goals are:&lt;ref name=about/&gt;
* The end of arbitrary obstacles to employment and permanent residency for foreign-born master’s and Ph.D. graduates from U.S. universities
* A streamlined [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] process
* A market-based [[H-1B]] visa cap

== Principles of Compete America ==

Compete America believes in the following principles:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.competeamerica.org/about/principles&lt;/ref&gt;

* The United States must grow domestic sources of talent, and our member organizations are committed to improving U.S. science, technology, engineering and mathematics ([[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]]) education and encouraging more young Americans to choose careers in those fields.
* U.S. employers must be able to recruit and retain foreign-born highly educated professionals – particularly after they graduate from a U.S. university – as an important complement to domestic sources of talent. 
* The U.S. employment-based visa system must be permanently fixed so that foreign-born talent can stay in the United States, innovating for America.
* Brainpower is even more essential in a down economy, and future growth and job creation will be led by innovation, whether it’s new technologies, new cures or new sources of energy.  America does not have a monopoly on brainpower, and in an increasingly competitive global environment, we have to retain the talent that will keep us leading worldwide innovation.
* Strong, smart enforcement is needed, to protect American and foreign-national workers, and laws should punish bad actors and recognize that most employers who hire foreign professionals follow the rules scrupulously.
* Immigration reform must safeguard the interests of American workers, while recognizing that excessive and protectionist measures that shut off access to foreign-national talent will only inhibit innovation, job growth and the resulting opportunities for American workers.

'''Computer network programming''' involves writing [[computer programs]] that enable [[process (computing)|processes]] to communicate with each other across a [[computer network]].

== Connection-oriented and connectionless communications ==

Very generally, most of communications can be divided into [[Connection-oriented_communication|connection-oriented]], and [[Connectionless_communication|connectionless]]. Whether a communication is a connection-oriented, or connectionless, is defined by the [[Communications_protocol|communication protocol]], and not by {{nowr|[[application programming interface]] (API)}}. Examples of the connection-oriented protocols include {{nowr|[[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP)}} and {{nowr|[[Sequenced Packet Exchange]] (SPX)}}, and examples of connectionless protocols include {{nowr|[[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP)}}, "raw IP", and {{nowr|[[Internetwork Packet Exchange]] (IPX)}}.

== Clients and servers ==
{{main|client–server model}}

For connection-oriented communications, communication parties usually have different roles. One party is usually waiting for incoming connections; this party is usually referred to as "[[Server_(computing)|server]]". Another party is the one which initiates connection; this party is usually referred to as "[[Client_(computing)|client]]".

For connectionless communications, one party ("server") is usually waiting for an incoming packet, and another party ("client") is usually understood as the one which sends an unsolicited [[Network_packet|packet]] to "server".

== Popular protocols and APIs ==

Network programming traditionally covers different layers of [[OSI_model|OSI/ISO model]] (most of application-level programming belongs to L4 and up). The table below contains some examples of popular protocols belonging to different OSI/ISO layers, and popular APIs for them.

{| class="wikitable"
! OSI/ISO Layer 
! Protocol
! API
|-
| L3 (network)
| [[Internet Protocol|IP]]
| [[Raw socket]]
|-
| L4 (transport)
| [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]], [[Stream Control Transmission Protocol |SCTP]]
| [[Berkeley Sockets]]
|-
| L5 (session)
| [[Transport Layer Security|TLS]]
| [[OpenSSL]]
|-
| L7 (application)
| [[HTTP]]
| Various

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5616">'''Consumer-to-business''' ('''C2B''') is a [[business model]] in which [[Consumer|consumers]] (individuals) create value and businesses consume that value. For example, when a consumer writes reviews or when a consumer gives a useful idea for new product development then that consumer is creating value for the business if the business adopts the input. In the '''C2B model''', a reverse [[auction]] or demand collection model, enables buyers to name or demand their own price, which is often binding, for a specific good or service. Inside of a consumer to business market the roles involved in the transaction must be established and the consumer must offer something of value to the business.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5001-what-is-c2b.html|title=What is C2B?|work=Business News Daily|access-date=2018-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another form of C2B is the [[electronic commerce]] business model in which consumers can offer products and services to companies, and the companies pay the consumers. This business model is a complete reversal of the traditional business model in which companies offer goods and services to consumers ([[business-to-consumer]] = B2C).  We can see the C2B model at work in [[blogs]] or [[internet forums]] in which the author offers a link back to an online business thereby facilitating the purchase of a product (like a book on [[Amazon.com]]), for which the author might receive affiliate revenues from a successful sale. [[Elance]] was the first C2B model e-commerce site.

C2B is a kind of economic relationship that is qualified as an inverted business type. The advent of the C2B scheme is due to:

* The internet connecting large groups of people to a bidirectional network; the large traditional media outlets are one-directional relationships whereas the internet is bidirectional.
* Decreasing costs of technology; individuals now have access to technologies that were once only available to large companies (digital printing and acquisition technology, high-performance computers, and powerful software).

== Positives and Negatives: ==
Nowadays people have smartphones or connect to the internet through personal tablets/computers daily allowing consumers to engage with brands online. According to Katherine Arline, in traditional consumer-to-business models companies would promote goods and services to consumers, but a shift has occurred to allow consumers to be the driving force behind a transaction.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; To the consumers benefit, reverse auctions occur in consumer to business markets allowing the consumer to name their price for a product or service. A consumer can also provide value to a business by offering to promote a business products on a consumers blog or social media platforms.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Businesses are provided value through their consumers and vice versa. Businesses gain in C2B from the consumers willingness to negotiate price, contribute data, or market to the company. Consumers profit from direct payment of the reduced-price goods and services and the flexibility of the transaction the C2B market created.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Consumer to business markets have their downfall as well. C2B is still a relatively new business practice and has not been fully studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Deng-Neng|date=October 11, 2006|title=An agent-based model for consumer-to-business electronic commerce|url=|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Distinguishing Between Traditional Business Models: ==
Consumer to business is an up and coming business market that can be utilized as a companies entire business model or added to an already existing model.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Consumer to business (C2B) is the opposite of business to consumer (B2C) practices and is facilitated by the internet or online forms of technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Marketing|last=Doyle|first=Charles|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780198736424|location=Online|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important distinction between the traditional business to consumer market is that the consumer chooses to be apart of the business relationship inside a consumer to business market. For a relationship to exist though both parties must acknowledge that it exists implying that the relationship is important to both participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raciti|first=Maria M.|last2=Ward|first2=Tony|last3=Dagger|first3=Tracey S.|date=2013-03-29|title=The effect of relationship desire on consumer‐to‐business relationships|url=https://www.emeraldinsight.com/action/captchaChallenge?redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.emeraldinsight.com%2Fdoi%2Fabs%2F10.1108%2F03090561311297490|journal=European Journal of Marketing|language=en|volume=47|issue=3/4|pages=615–634|doi=10.1108/03090561311297490|issn=0309-0566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data and analytics are going to drive the C2B world and enable companies to gain a better understanding of customers. Businesses need to go back to what drives the sales, people.

'''Defaqto''' is an independent financial information business, focused on helping financial institutions and consumers make better informed decisions. At its heart is its financial product and fund database consisting of data from across the whole UK market. From this, Defaqto creates a range of products and services – ratings, software solutions, data services, and publications and events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Synova backs highly rated Defaqto {{!}} Synova Capital |url=http://www.synova-capital.com/backs-highly-rated-defaqto/ |website=www.synova-capital.com |accessdate=2015-09-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who are Defaqto? - Aviva|url = http://www.aviva.co.uk/defaqto/|website = www.aviva.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratings ==
Defaqto produce a range of independent ratings to help consumers understand how financial products fit into the market place.

The ratings are created as expert reviews of financial products (such as [[Michelin Guide|Michelin]] reviews) as opposed to consumer revenues (such as [[TripAdvisor]]).

=== Star Ratings ===
Ratings are based on the quality and comprehensiveness of the features and benefits it offers. Defaqto rate individual propositions, not the provider of the product, across more than 60 categories – including banking, general insurance, life and protection, and pensions and investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ratings {{!}} Solutions {{!}} Defaqto|url = https://defaqto.com/solutions/ratings/?id=46191|website = defaqto.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defaqto Ratings at Gocompare.com|url = http://www.gocompare.com/defaqto/|website = www.gocompare.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=What does a Defaqto 5 Star Rating mean for me? |url=http://money.asda.com/guides/motoring/what-does-a-defaqto-5-star-rating-mean-for-me/?id=87 |website=ASDA Money |accessdate=2015-09-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Who are Defaqto? - Aviva|url = http://www.aviva.co.uk/defaqto/|website = www.aviva.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defaqto Star Ratings {{!}} AA|url = http://www.theaa.com/insurance/defaqto-ratings-faq.html|website = www.theaa.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Defaqto 5 star awards {{!}} LV= Liverpool Victoria|url = http://www.lv.com/about-us/awards/defaqto|website = www.lv.com|accessdate = 2015-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Allianz car insurance is 5 star Defaqto rated |url=https://www.allianz.co.uk/car-insurance/defaqto.html |website=www.allianz.co.uk |accessdate=2015-09-04 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dielectric withstand test''' or "high potential"  or "hipot" test is an electrical test performed on a component or product to determine the effectiveness of its [[Insulator (electricity)|insulation]]. The test may be between mutually insulated sections of a part or energized parts and electrical ground. The test is a means to qualify a device's ability to operate safely during rated electrical conditions.&lt;ref&gt;MIL-STD-202G, Method 301, Dielectric Withstanding Voltage&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[Electric current|current]] through a device under test is less than a specified limit at the required test potential and time duration, the device meets the [[dielectric]] withstand requirement. A dielectric withstand test may be done as a factory test on new equipment, or may be done on apparatus already in service as a routine maintenance test.&lt;ref name=Gill09&gt;Paul Gill (2009), ''Electrical Power Equipment Maintenance and Testing'', Second Edition, CRC Press, 1574446568, page 459&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Meger M4100 pealt.JPG|thumb| An insulation test set; in this pattern, a hand-cranked generator provides the high voltage and the scale is directly calibrated in megohms.]]

[[Voltage]] withstand testing is done with a high voltage source and voltage and current meters.  A single instrument called a "hipot tester" is often used to perform this test. It applies the necessary voltages to a device and monitors leakage current. The current can trip a fault indicator. The tester has output overload protection. The test voltage may be either [[direct current]] or [[alternating current]] at power frequency or other frequency, like resonant frequency (30 to 300&amp;nbsp;Hz determined by load) or VLF (0.01&amp;nbsp;Hz to 0.1&amp;nbsp;Hz), when convenient. The maximum voltage is given in the test standard for the particular product. The application rate may also be adjusted to manage leakage currents resulting from inherent capacitive effects of the test object. The duration of the test may be up to 60 seconds or more. The applied voltage, rate of application and test duration depend on the specification requirements of the equipment. Different test standards apply for consumer electronics, military electrical devices, high voltage cables, switchgear and other apparatus.&lt;ref name=Gill09/&gt;

Typical hipot equipment leakage current trip limit settings range between 0.5 and 20&amp;nbsp;mA&lt;ref&gt;Condor Application Note 5/00, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt; and are set by the user according to test object characteristics and rate of voltage application. The objective is to choose a current setting that will not cause the tester to falsely trip during voltage application, while at the same time, selecting a value that minimizes possible damage to the device under test should an inadvertent discharge or breakdown occur.

|-
|style="text-align: left; font-size: 90%;" |The circuit depicted in figure 1 is a [[low-noise block converter]] and is intended to be attached to a satellite television receiving dish antenna. It is called a block converter because it converts a large number of satellite channels as a block with no attempt to extract to a particular channel. Even though the transmission has travelled 22,000&amp;nbsp;miles from the satellite orbit, there is a problem getting the signal the last few feet from the dish to the point where it will be used inside the property. The difficulty is that the signal is brought inside the property by a cable (called a downlead) and the high satellite signal frequencies are greatly attenuated when in a cable rather than free space. The purpose of the block converter is to convert the satellite signal to a much lower frequency band that can be handled by the downlead and the user's [[set-top box]]. Frequencies depend on satellite system and geographical region, but this particular device converts a block of frequencies in the band 10.7&amp;nbsp;GHz to 11.8&amp;nbsp;GHz. The output going to the downlead is in the band 950&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1950&amp;nbsp;MHz. The two [[F connector]]s at the bottom of the device are for connection to downleads. Two are provided on this particular model (block converters can have any number of outputs from one upwards) so that two televisions or a television and [[VCR]] can be tuned to two different channels at the same time. The receiving [[horn (telecommunications)|horn]] would normally be fitted to the circular hole in the centre of the board, the two probes protruding into this space are for receiving horizontally and vertically [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] signals respectively and the device can be switched between these two. Many filter structures can be seen in the circuit: there are two examples of band-pass parallel-coupled lines filters which are there to restrict the incoming signal to the band of interest. The relatively large width of the resonators (compare to the microstrip example in figure 2, or the [[local oscillator]] filters below and to the right of the central metal oblong) reflect the wide bandwidth the filter is required to pass. There are also numerous examples of stub filters supplying [[DC bias]] to transistors and other devices, the filter being required to prevent the signal from travelling towards the power source. The rows of holes in some tracks, called [[via fence]]s, are not filtering structures but form part of the enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;Bahl, pp.290–293.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, pp.44–51.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lundström, pp.80–82&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''distributed element filter''' is an [[electronic filter]] in which [[capacitance]], [[inductance]] and [[electrical resistance|resistance]] (the [[electrical element|elements]] of the circuit) are not localised in discrete [[capacitor]]s, [[inductor]]s and [[resistor]]s as they are in conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of [[frequency spectrum|signal frequencies]] to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the [[lumped element model]], which considers each element to be "lumped together" at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the [[frequency]] of the signal increases, or equivalently as the [[wavelength]] decreases. The [[distributed element model]] applies at all frequencies, and is used in [[transmission line]] theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of [[electrical conductor|conductors]] and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate "lumped" capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the [[microwave]] band (wavelength less than one metre).

Distributed element filters are used in many of the same applications as lumped element filters, such as [[Selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]] of radio channel, [[bandlimited|bandlimiting]] of noise and [[Frequency-division multiplexing|multiplexing]] of many signals into one channel. Distributed element filters may be constructed to have any of the bandforms possible with lumped elements ([[low-pass]], [[band-pass]], etc.) with the exception of [[high-pass]], which is usually only approximated. All filter classes used in lumped element designs ([[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]], [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev]], etc.) can be implemented using a distributed element approach.

There are many component forms used to construct distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a [[Reflections of signals on conducting lines#Discontinuity along line|discontinuity]] on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a [[Electrical reactance|reactive impedance]] to a wavefront travelling down the line, and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped [[inductor]]s, [[capacitor]]s or [[resonator]]s, as required by the filter.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.13–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of distributed element filters was spurred on by the military need for [[radar]] and [[electronic counter measures]] during World War&amp;nbsp;II. Lumped element [[analogue filter]]s had long before been developed but these new military systems operated at microwave frequencies and new filter designs were required. When the war ended, the technology found applications in the [[microwave link]]s used by telephone companies and other organisations with large fixed-communication networks, such as television broadcasters. Nowadays the technology can be found in several mass-produced consumer items, such as the [[Low-noise block converter|converters]] (figure 1 shows an example) used with [[satellite dish|satellite television dishes]].

==General comments==
[[File:Microstrip-bandpass-filter.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph|'''Figure 2.''' A parallel-coupled lines filter in microstrip construction]]
:''The symbol λ is used to mean the [[wavelength]] of the signal being transmitted on the line or a section of line of that [[electrical length]].''

Distributed element filters are mostly used at frequencies above the [[VHF]] (Very High Frequency) band (30 to 300 [[megahertz|MHz]]). At these frequencies, the physical length of [[passive components]] is a significant fraction of the wavelength of the operating frequency, and it becomes difficult to use the conventional [[lumped element model]]. The exact point at which distributed element modelling becomes necessary depends on the particular design under consideration. A common rule of thumb is to apply distributed element modelling when component dimensions are larger than 0.1λ. The increasing miniaturisation of electronics has meant that circuit designs are becoming ever smaller compared to λ. The frequencies beyond which a distributed element approach to filter design becomes necessary are becoming ever higher as a result of these advances. On the other hand, [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] structure dimensions are usually comparable to λ in all frequency bands and require the distributed element model.&lt;ref&gt;Golio, pp.1.2–1.3,4.4–4.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most noticeable difference in behaviour between a distributed element filter and its lumped-element approximation is that the former will have multiple [[passband]] replicas of the lumped-element [[prototype filter|prototype]] passband, because transmission line transfer characteristics repeat at harmonic intervals. These spurious passbands are undesirable in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

For clarity of presentation, the diagrams in this article are drawn with the components implemented in [[stripline]] format. This does not imply an industry preference, although [[planar transmission line]] formats (that is, formats where conductors consist of flat strips) are popular because they can be implemented using established [[printed circuit board]] manufacturing techniques. The structures shown can also be implemented using [[microstrip]] or buried stripline techniques (with suitable adjustments to dimensions) and can be adapted to [[coaxial cable]]s, [[twin lead]]s and [[waveguide]]s, although some structures are more suitable for some implementations than others. The open wire implementations, for instance, of a number of structures are shown in the second column of figure 3 and open wire equivalents can be found for most other stripline structures. Planar transmission lines are also used in [[integrated circuit]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers ''et al.'', p.129.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Development of distributed element filters began in the years before World War&amp;nbsp;II. [[Warren P. Mason]] founded the field of [[distributed element circuit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Thurston, p. 570&lt;/ref&gt;  A major paper on the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Mason and Sykes, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason had filed a patent&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Warren P., "Wave filter", {{US patent|1781469}}, filed: {{Nowrap|25 June}} 1927, issued: {{Nowrap|11 November}} 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published electrical design which moves away from a lumped element analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Fagen and Millman, p.108.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason and Sykes' work was focused on the formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of [[radar]] and [[electronic counter-measures]]. A good deal of this was at the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]],&lt;ref&gt;Ragan, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.&lt;ref&gt;Makimoto and Yamashita, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, p.1055.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some important advances in [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|network theory]] were needed before filters could be advanced beyond wartime designs. One of these was the commensurate line theory of [[Paul Richards (scientist)|Paul Richards]].&lt;ref&gt;Richards, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Commensurate lines are networks in which all the elements are the same length (or in some cases multiples of the unit length), although they may differ in other dimensions to give different characteristic impedances. [[Richards' transformation]] allows a lumped element design to be taken "as is" and transformed directly into a distributed element design using a very simple transform equation.&lt;ref name=LevyCohn1056&gt;Levy and Cohn, p.1056.&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulty with Richards' transformation from the point of view of building practical filters was that the resulting distributed element design invariably included [[Series and parallel circuits|series]] connected elements. This was not possible to implement in planar technologies and was often inconvenient in other technologies. This problem was solved by K. Kuroda who used impedance transformers to eliminate the series elements. He published a set of transformations known as [[Kuroda's identities]] in 1955, but his work was written in Japanese and it was several years before his ideas were incorporated into the English-language literature.&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, p.1057.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, one important research avenue was trying to increase the design bandwidth of wide-band filters. The approach used at the time (and still in use today) was to start with a lumped element [[prototype filter]] and through various transformations arrive at the desired filter in a distributed element form. This approach appeared to be stuck at a minimum ''Q'' of five (see [[#Band-pass filters|Band-pass filters]] below for an explanation of ''Q''). In 1957, Leo Young at [[Stanford Research Institute]] published a method for designing filters which ''started'' with a distributed element prototype.&lt;ref&gt;Young, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; This prototype was based on [[quarter wave impedance transformer]]s and was able to produce designs with bandwidths up to an [[Octave (electronics)|octave]], corresponding to a ''Q'' of about 1.3. Some of Young's procedures in that paper were empirical, but later,&lt;ref&gt;Levy, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; exact solutions were published. Young's paper specifically addresses directly coupled cavity resonators, but the procedure can equally be applied to other directly coupled resonator types, such as those found in modern planar technologies and illustrated in this article. The capacitive gap filter (figure 8) and the parallel-coupled lines filter (figure 9) are examples of directly coupled resonators.&lt;ref name=LevyCohn1056/&gt;

The introduction of printed planar technologies greatly simplified the manufacture of many microwave components including filters, and microwave integrated circuits then became possible. It is not known when planar transmission lines originated, but experiments using them were recorded as early as 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Aksun, p.142.&lt;/ref&gt; The inventor of printed stripline, however, is known; this was Robert M. Barrett who published the idea in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett and Barnes, 1951,&lt;br /&gt;Barrett, 1952,&lt;br /&gt;Niehenke ''et al.'', p.846.&lt;/ref&gt; This caught on rapidly, and Barrett's ''stripline'' soon had fierce commercial competition from rival planar formats, especially ''triplate'' and ''microstrip''. The generic term ''stripline'' in modern usage usually refers to the form then known as ''triplate''.&lt;ref&gt;Sarkar, pp.556–559.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early stripline directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but the length was reduced and the compactness successively increased with the introduction of parallel-coupled line filters,&lt;ref&gt;Cohn, 1958.&lt;/ref&gt; interdigital filters,&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; and comb-line filters.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this work was published by the group at Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, pp.1057–1059.&lt;/ref&gt; The hairpin filter was first described in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Cristal and Frankel, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, p.1063.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described.&lt;ref&gt;Niehenke ''et al.'', p.847.&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-[[elliptic filter|elliptic]], while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as [[suspended stripline]] and [[finline]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy and Cohn, p.1065.&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial non-military application of distributed element filters was in the [[microwave link]]s used by telecommunications companies to provide the [[backbone network|backbone]] of their networks. These links were also used by other industries with large, fixed networks, notably television broadcasters.&lt;ref&gt;Huurdeman, pp.369–371.&lt;/ref&gt; Such applications were part of large capital investment programs. However, mass-production manufacturing made the technology cheap enough to incorporate in domestic [[satellite television]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; An emerging application is in [[superconductivity|superconducting]] filters for use in the [[cellular base station]]s operated by mobile phone companies.&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Saunders, pp.157–159.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic components==
The simplest structure that can be implemented is a step in the [[characteristic impedance]] of the line, which introduces a discontinuity in the transmission characteristics. This is done in planar technologies by a change in the width of the transmission line. Figure 4(a) shows a step up in impedance (narrower lines have higher impedance). A step down in impedance would be the mirror image of figure 4(a). The discontinuity can be represented approximately as a series inductor, or more exactly, as a low-pass T circuit as shown in figure 4(a).&lt;ref name=Bhat498&gt;Bhat and Koul, p.498.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple discontinuities are often coupled together with [[quarter wave impedance transformer|impedance transformers]] to produce a filter of higher [[Degree of a polynomial|order]]. These impedance transformers can be just a short (often λ/4) length of transmission line. These composite structures can implement any of the filter families ([[Butterworth filter|Butterworth]], [[Chebyshev filter|Chebyshev]], etc.) by approximating the [[rational function|rational]] [[transfer function]] of the corresponding lumped element filter. This correspondence is not exact since distributed element circuits cannot be rational and is the root reason for the divergence of lumped element and distributed element behaviour. Impedance transformers are also used in hybrid mixtures of lumped and distributed element filters (the so-called semi-lumped structures).&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.144–149, 203–207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another very common component of distributed element filters is the [[Stub (electronics)|stub]]. Over a narrow range of frequencies, a stub can be used as a capacitor or an inductor (its impedance is determined by its length) but over a wide band it behaves as a resonator. Short-circuit, nominally quarter-wavelength stubs (figure 3(a)) behave as shunt [[LC circuit|LC]] [[antiresonance|antiresonators]], and an open-circuit nominally quarter-wavelength stub (figure 3(b)) behaves as a series LC [[resonator]]. Stubs can also be used in conjunction with impedance transformers to build more complex filters and, as would be expected from their resonant nature, are most useful in band-pass applications.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.203–207.&lt;/ref&gt; While open-circuit stubs are easier to manufacture in planar technologies, they have the drawback that the termination deviates significantly from an ideal open circuit (see figure 4(b)), often leading to a preference for short-circuit stubs (one can always be used in place of the other by adding or subtracting λ/4 to or from the length).&lt;ref name=Bhat498/&gt;

A [[helical resonator]] is similar to a stub, in that it requires a distributed element model to represent it, but is actually built using lumped elements. They are built in a non-planar format and consist of a coil of wire, on a former and core, and connected only at one end. The device is usually in a shielded can with a hole in the top for adjusting the core. It will often look physically very similar to the lumped LC resonators used for a similar purpose. They are most useful in the upper [[VHF]] and lower [[UHF]] bands whereas stubs are more often applied in the higher UHF and [[Super high frequency|SHF]] bands.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pp.63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;

Coupled lines (figures 3(c-e)) can also be used as filter elements; like stubs, they can act as resonators and likewise be terminated short-circuit or open-circuit. Coupled lines tend to be preferred in planar technologies, where they are easy to implement, whereas stubs tend to be preferred elsewhere. Implementing a true open circuit in planar technology is not feasible because of the dielectric effect of the substrate which will always ensure that the equivalent circuit contains a shunt capacitance.  Despite this, open circuits are often used in planar formats in preference to short circuits because they are easier to implement.  Numerous element types can be classified as coupled lines and a selection of the more common ones is shown in the figures.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.217–218.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common structures are shown in figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations are not to be taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and [[band-stop filter]]s. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in [[low-pass filter]] applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits but not with a planar technology. These two structures are therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.217–229.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-pass filters==
[[File:Microstrip Low Pass Bowtie Stub Filter.jpg|thumb|right|A microstrip low pass filter implemented with bowtie stubs inside a 20&amp;nbsp;GHz Agilent N9344C spectrum analyser]]
[[File:Stripline filter low-pass form 1.svg|thumb|300px|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of sections of line that are alternately narrower than the input line and much wider. These are all directly connected in cascade. The narrow lines are annotated as inductors and the wide lines are annotated as capacitors. An equivalent circuit is shown below the stripline diagram consisting of series inductors alternating with shunt capacitors in a ladder network.|'''Figure 5.''' Stepped-impedance low-pass filter formed from alternate high and low impedance sections of line]]
A [[low-pass filter]] can be implemented quite directly from a [[ladder topology]] lumped-element prototype with the stepped impedance filter shown in figure 5.  This is also called a ''cascaded lines'' design.  The filter consists of alternating sections of high-impedance and low-impedance lines which correspond to the series inductors and shunt capacitors in the lumped-element implementation. Low-pass filters are commonly used to feed [[direct current]] (DC) bias to active components. Filters intended for this application are sometimes referred to as ''chokes''. In such cases, each element of the filter is λ/4 in length (where λ is the wavelength of the main-line signal to be blocked from transmission into the DC source) and the high-impedance sections of the line are made as narrow as the manufacturing technology will allow in order to maximise the inductance.&lt;ref name=Kneppo213&gt;Kneppo, pp.213–214.&lt;/ref&gt; Additional sections may be added as required for the performance of the filter just as they would for the lumped-element counterpart. As well as the planar form shown, this structure is particularly well suited for [[coaxial cable|coaxial]] implementations with alternating discs of metal and insulator being threaded on to the central conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.373–374.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp.789–790.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Svegi252&gt;Sevgi, p.252.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stripline filter low-pass form 2.svg|thumb|left|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of sections of line that are narrower than the input line alternating with branch lines consisting of a narrow section of line in cascade with a wide line. An equivalent circuit is shown below the stripline diagram consisting of series inductors alternating with shunt series LC circuits in a ladder network.|'''Figure 6.''' Another form of stepped-impedance low-pass filter incorporating shunt resonators]]
A more complex example of stepped impedance design is presented in figure 6. Again, narrow lines are used to implement inductors and wide lines correspond to capacitors, but in this case, the lumped-element counterpart has resonators connected in shunt across the main line. This topology can be used to design [[elliptical filter]]s or [[Chebyshev filter]]s with poles of attenuation in the [[stopband]]. However, calculating component values for these structures is an involved process and has led to designers often choosing to implement them as [[m-derived filter]]s instead, which perform well and are much easier to calculate. The purpose of incorporating resonators is to improve the [[band rejection|stopband rejection]]. However, beyond the resonant frequency of the highest frequency resonator, the stopband rejection starts to deteriorate as the resonators are moving towards open-circuit. For this reason, filters built to this design often have an additional single stepped-impedance capacitor as the final element of the filter.&lt;ref&gt;Hong and Lancaster, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; This also ensures good rejection at high frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.373–380.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp.792–794.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneppo, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stripline filter low-pass stubs.svg|thumb|alt=(a), a stripline diagram consisting of a through line, which is narrower than the input and output lines, with regular perpendicular branch lines joined to alternate sides of the through line.

]]
Another common low-pass design technique is to implement the shunt capacitors as stubs with the resonant frequency set above the operating frequency so that the stub impedance is capacitive in the passband. This implementation has a lumped-element counterpart of a general form similar to the filter of figure 6. Where space allows, the stubs may be set on alternate sides of the main line as shown in figure 7(a). The purpose of this is to prevent coupling between adjacent stubs which detracts from the filter performance by altering the frequency response. However, a structure with all the stubs on the same side is still a valid design. If the stub is required to be a very low impedance line, the stub may be inconveniently wide. In these cases, a possible solution is to connect two narrower stubs in parallel. That is, each stub position has a stub on ''both sides'' of the line. A drawback of this topology is that additional transverse resonant modes are possible along the λ/2 length of line formed by the two stubs together. For a choke design, the requirement is simply to make the capacitance as large as possible, for which the maximum stub width of λ/4 may be used with stubs in parallel on both sides of the main line. The resulting filter looks rather similar to the stepped impedance filter of figure 5, but has been designed on completely different principles.&lt;ref name=Kneppo213/&gt; A difficulty with using stubs this wide is that the point at which they are connected to the main line is ill-defined. A stub that is narrow in comparison to λ can be taken as being connected on its centre-line and calculations based on that assumption will accurately predict filter response. For a wide stub, however, calculations that assume the side branch is connected at a definite point on the main line leads to inaccuracies as this is no longer a good model of the transmission pattern. One solution to this difficulty is to use radial stubs instead of linear stubs. A pair of radial stubs in parallel (one on either side of the main line) is called a butterfly stub (see figure 7(b)). A group of three radial stubs in parallel, which can be achieved at the end of a line, is called a clover-leaf stub.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, pp.790–792.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneppo, pp.212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Band-pass filters==
A [[band-pass filter]] can be constructed using any elements that can resonate. Filters using stubs can clearly be made band-pass; numerous other structures are possible and some are presented below.

An important parameter when discussing band-pass filters is the fractional bandwidth. This is defined as the ratio of the bandwidth to the geometric centre frequency. The inverse of this quantity is called the [[Q factor|Q-factor]], ''Q''. If ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the frequencies of the passband edges, then:&lt;ref&gt;Farago, p.69.&lt;/ref&gt;

:bandwidth &lt;math&gt;\Delta\omega=\omega_2-\omega_1\,&lt;/math&gt;,
:geometric centre frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0=\sqrt{\omega_1\omega_2}&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;Q=\frac{\omega_0}{\Delta\omega}&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitive gap filter===
[[File:Stripline capacitive gap filter.svg|thumb|350px|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of a through line with regularly spaced gaps across the line|'''Figure 8.''' Capacitive gap stripline filter]]
The capacitive gap structure consists of sections of line about λ/2 in length which act as resonators and are coupled "end-on" by gaps in the transmission line. It is particularly suitable for planar formats, is easily implemented with printed circuit technology and has the advantage of taking up no more space than a plain transmission line would. The limitation of this topology is that performance (particularly [[insertion loss]]) deteriorates with increasing fractional bandwidth, and acceptable results are not obtained with a ''Q'' less than about 5. A further difficulty with producing low-''Q'' designs is that the gap width is required to be smaller for wider fractional bandwidths. The minimum width of gaps, like the minimum width of [[signal trace|tracks]], is limited by the resolution of the printing technology.&lt;ref name=Svegi252/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.422, 440–450.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parallel-coupled lines filter===
[[File:Stripline parallel-coupled lines filter.svg|thumb|left|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of a number of parallel, but overlapping lines. The left end of the first line is marked as continuing (the input) and likeise the right end of the last line (the output). All other line ends are left open-circuit.|400px|'''Figure 9.''' Stripline parallel-coupled lines filter. This filter is commonly printed at an angle as shown to minimize the board space taken up, although this is not an essential feature of the design. It is also common for the end element or the overlapping halves of the two end elements to be a narrower width for matching purposes (not shown in this diagram, see Figure 1).]]
Parallel-coupled lines is another popular topology for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of nothing more than the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as dielectric loss reduces the ''Q''. Lower-''Q'' lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.585–595.&lt;/ref&gt; For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and ''Q''-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.&lt;ref name=Svegi252/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.422, 472–477.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kneppo, pp.216–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Microstrip Hairpin Filter.jpg|thumb|right|A microstrip hairpin PCB filter implemented in an Agilent N9344C spectrum analyser]]
[[File:Microstrip Hairpin Filter And Low Pass Stub Filter.jpg|thumb|right|A microstrip hairpin filter followed by a low pass stub filter on a PCB in a 20GHz Agilent N9344C spectrum analyser]]
[[File:Stripline hairpin filter 2.svg|thumb|275px|alt=A diagram of a stripline circuit. A number of elongated "U" shapes (the hairpins) are placed in cascade, but not actually touching. The input line joins the left side of the first hairpin and the output line joins the right side of the last hairpin. The lines making up the hairpins are narrower than the main input and output lines.|'''Figure 10.''' Stripline hairpin filter]]
The hairpin filter is another structure that uses parallel-coupled lines. In this case, each pair of parallel-coupled lines is connected to the next pair by a short link. The "U" shapes so formed give rise to the name ''[[bobby pin|hairpin]] filter''. In some designs the link can be longer, giving a wide hairpin with λ/4 impedance transformer action between sections.&lt;ref&gt;Hong and Lancaster, pp.130–132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jarry and Beneat, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The angled bends seen in figure 10 are common to stripline designs and represent a compromise between a sharp right angle, which produces a large discontinuity, and a smooth bend, which takes up more board area which can be severely limited in some products. Such bends are often seen in long stubs where they could not otherwise be fitted into the space available. The lumped-element equivalent circuit of this kind of discontinuity is similar to a stepped-impedance discontinuity.&lt;ref name=Bhat499/&gt; Examples of such stubs can be seen on the bias inputs to several components in the photograph at the top of the article.&lt;ref name=Svegi252/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paolo, pp.113–116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interdigital filter===
[[File:Stripline interdigital filter.svg|thumb|upright|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of a number of long parallel vertical lines. There are two horizontal lines with numerous short-circuit straps fed through holes to the board's ground plane. The vertical lines are alternately connected to the top and bottom horizontal lines. The free end of the first and last horizontal lines form the input and output respectively.|'''Figure 11.''' Stripline interdigital filter]]
[[File:Interdigital Filter.jpg|thumb|Three Interdigital Coupled Line filters from a spectrum analyser PCB]]
Interdigital filters are another form of coupled-line filter. Each section of line is about λ/4 in length and is terminated in a short-circuit at one end only, the other end being left open-circuit. The end which is short-circuited alternates on each line section. This topology is straightforward to implement in planar technologies, but also particularly lends itself to a mechanical assembly of lines fixed inside a metal case. The lines can be either circular rods or rectangular bars, and interfacing to a coaxial format line is easy. As with the parallel-coupled line filter, the advantage of a mechanical arrangement that does not require insulators for support is that dielectric losses are eliminated. The spacing requirement between lines is not as stringent as in the parallel line structure; as such, higher fractional bandwidths can be achieved, and ''Q'' values as low as 1.4 are possible.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.424, 614–632.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hong and Lancaster, p.140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The comb-line filter is similar to the interdigital filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and the design is consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.424, 497–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stub band-pass filters===
[[File:Stripline stub filter.svg|thumb|left|300px|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of a through line with regularly spaced branch lines perpendicular to it. Each branch line (except the first and the last) extends both sides of the through line and is terminated in short-circuit straps at both ends. The first and last branch line extend to only one side, are half the length of the other branches, and have only one terminating short-circuit strap.|'''Figure 12.''' Stripline stub filter composed of λ/4 short-circuit stubs]]
As mentioned above, stubs lend themselves to band-pass designs. General forms of these are similar to stub low-pass filters except that the main line is no longer a narrow high impedance line. Designers have many different topologies of stub filters to choose from, some of which produce identical responses. An example stub filter is shown in figure 12; it consists of a row of λ/4 short-circuit stubs coupled together by λ/4 impedance transformers. The stubs in the body of the filter are double paralleled stubs while the stubs on the end sections are only singles, an arrangement that has impedance matching advantages. The impedance transformers have the effect of transforming the row of shunt anti-resonators into a ladder of series resonators and shunt anti-resonators. A filter with similar properties can be constructed with λ/4 open-circuit stubs placed in series with the line and coupled together with λ/4 impedance transformers, although this structure is not possible in planar technologies.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.595–605.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stripline butterfly stub filter.svg|thumb|110px|alt=A stripline circuit consisting of a through line with two 60° circle sectors attached to the line (one either side) by their apexes|'''Figure 13.''' Konishi's 60° butterfly stub]]
Yet another structure available is λ/2 open-circuit stubs across the line coupled with λ/4 impedance transformers. This topology has both low-pass and band-pass characteristics. Because it will pass DC, it is possible to transmit biasing voltages to active components without the need for blocking capacitors. Also, since short-circuit links are not required, no assembly operations other than the board printing are required when implemented as stripline. The disadvantages are (i) the filter will take up more board real estate than the corresponding λ/4 stub filter, since the stubs are all twice as long; (ii) the first spurious passband is at 2ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, as opposed to 3ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for the λ/4 stub filter.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', pp.605–614.&lt;/ref&gt;

Konishi describes a wideband 12&amp;nbsp;GHz band-pass filter, which uses 60° butterfly stubs and also has a low-pass response (short-circuit stubs are required to prevent such a response). As is often the case with distributed element filters, the bandform into which the filter is classified largely depends on which bands are desired and which are considered to be spurious.&lt;ref&gt;Konishi, pp.80–82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==High-pass filters==
Genuine [[high-pass filter]]s are difficult, if not impossible, to implement with distributed elements. The usual design approach is to start with a band-pass design, but make the upper stopband occur at a frequency that is so high as to be of no interest. Such filters are described as pseudo-high-pass and the upper stopband is described as a vestigial stopband. Even structures that seem to have an "obvious" high-pass topology, such as the capacitive gap filter of figure 8, turn out to be band-pass when their behaviour for very short wavelengths is considered.&lt;ref&gt;Matthaei ''et al.'', p.541.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation''' ('''ECMO'''), also known as '''extracorporeal life support''' ('''ECLS'''), is an [[extracorporeal]] technique of providing prolonged cardiac and [[respiratory system|respiratory]] support to persons whose [[human heart|heart]] and [[human lung|lung]]s are unable to provide an adequate amount of gas exchange or perfusion to sustain life. The technology for ECMO is largely derived from [[cardiopulmonary bypass]], which provides shorter-term support with arrested native circulation.

This intervention has mostly been used on children, but it is seeing more use in adults with cardiac and respiratory failure. ECMO works by removing blood from the person's body and artificially removing the carbon dioxide and oxygenating [[red blood cell]]s. Generally, it is used either post-cardiopulmonary bypass or in late stage treatment of a person with profound heart and/or lung failure, although it is now seeing use as a treatment for cardiac arrest in certain centers, allowing treatment of the underlying cause of arrest while circulation and oxygenation are supported.

Guidelines that describe the indications and practice of ECMO are published by the [[Extracorporeal Life Support Organization]] (ELSO). Criteria for the initiation of ECMO vary by institution, but generally include acute severe cardiac or pulmonary failure that is potentially reversible and unresponsive to conventional management. Examples of clinical situations that may prompt the initiation of ECMO include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.elso.org/Portals/0/IGD/Archive/FileManager/929122ae88cusersshyerdocumentselsoguidelinesgeneralalleclsversion1.3.pdf |title=General Guidelines for all ECLS Cases |format= |work= Extracorporeal Life Support Organization |accessdate=2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* Hypoxemic [[respiratory failure]] with a ratio of arterial oxygen tension to [[fraction of inspired oxygen]] (PaO2/FiO2) of &lt;100 mmHg despite optimization of the ventilator settings, including the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2), [[positive end-expiratory pressure]] (PEEP), and inspiratory to expiratory (I:E) ratio
* Hypercapnic respiratory failure with an arterial pH &lt;7.20
* Refractory [[cardiogenic shock]]
* [[Cardiac arrest]], recognized as [[extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation|ECPR]]

In those with cardiac arrest or cardiogenic shock, it appears to improve survival and good outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouweneel|first1=DM|last2=Schotborgh|first2=JV|last3=Limpens|first3=J|last4=Sjauw|first4=KD|last5=Engström|first5=AE|last6=Lagrand|first6=WK|last7=Cherpanath|first7=TG|last8=Driessen|first8=AH|last9=de Mol|first9=BA|last10=Henriques|first10=JP|title=Extracorporeal life support during cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock: a systematic review and meta-analysis.|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=19 September 2016|pmid=27647331|doi=10.1007/s00134-016-4536-8|volume=42|pmc=5106498|pages=1922–1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Outcomes ===
Early studies had shown survival benefit with use of ECMO for people in acute respiratory failure especially in the setting of [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]].&lt;ref name="pmid9315812" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9310799" /&gt; A registry maintained by ELSO of nearly 51,000 people that have received ECMO has reported outcomes with 75% survival for neonatal respiratory failure, 56% survival for pediatric respiratory failure, and 55% survival for adult respiratory failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extracorporeal Life Support Organization Registry International Report 2016 |url = http://journals.lww.com/asaiojournal/Citation/2017/01000/Extracorporeal_Life_Support_Organization_Registry.11.aspx|journal = ASAIO Journal|date = 2017-04-01|volume = 63|issue = 1|doi = 10.1097/MAT.0000000000000475|first = Matthew L.|last = Paden|first2 = Steven A.|last2 = Conrad|first3 = Peter T.|last3 = Rycus|first4 = Ravi R.|last4 = Thiagarajan|pages=60–67|pmid=27984321}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other observational and uncontrolled clinical trials have reported survival rates from 50 to 70 percent.&lt;ref name="pmid15383787"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19768656"/&gt; These reported survival rates are better than historical survival rates.&lt;ref name="pmid9351722"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid9556124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid10598597"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], veno-venous ECMO deployment is concentrated in designated ECMO centers to potentially improve care and promote better outcomes.

== Contraindications ==
Most contraindications are relative, balancing the risks of the procedure (including the risk of using valuable resources that could be used for others) versus the potential benefits. The relative contraindications are:
# Conditions incompatible with normal life if the person recovers
# Preexisting conditions that affect the quality of life (CNS status, end-stage malignancy, risk of systemic bleeding with anticoagulation)
# Age and size
# Futility: those who are too sick, have been on conventional therapy too long, or have a fatal diagnosis.

==Types==
[[File:Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO for cardiac or respiratory failure.jpg|thumb|Veno-arterial (VA) ECMO for cardiac or respiratory failure.&lt;ref name="ELSO2005"/&gt;]][[File:Veno-venous (VV) ECMO for isolated respiratory failure.jpg|thumb|Veno-venous (VV) ECMO for respiratory failure.&lt;ref name="ELSO2005"/&gt;]]
There are several forms of ECMO; the two most common are veno-arterial (VA) ECMO and veno-venous (VV) ECMO. In both modalities, blood drained from the venous system is oxygenated outside of the body. In VA ECMO, this blood is returned to the [[artery|arterial]] system and in VV ECMO the blood is returned to the [[vein|venous]] system. In VV ECMO, no cardiac support is provided.

=== Veno-arterial ===
In veno-arterial (VA) ECMO, a venous [[cannula]] is usually placed in the right or left common [[femoral vein]] for extraction, and an arterial cannula is usually placed into the right or left [[femoral artery]] for infusion.&lt;ref name="pmid16492278"/&gt; The tip of the femoral venous cannula should be maintained near the junction of the [[inferior vena cava]] and right atrium, while the tip of the femoral arterial cannula is maintained in the iliac artery.&lt;ref name="pmid16492278"/&gt; In adults, accessing the femoral artery is preferred because the insertion is simpler.&lt;ref name="pmid16492278"/&gt; Central VA ECMO may be used if cardiopulmonary bypass has already been established or emergency re-sternotomy has been performed (with cannulae in the right atrium(or SVC/IVC for tricuspid repair) and ascending aorta).

VA ECMO is typically reserved when native cardiac function is minimal to mitigate increased cardiac stroke work associated with pumping against retrograde flow delivered by the aortic cannula.

=== Veno-venous ===
In veno-venous (VV) ECMO, cannulae are usually placed in the right common femoral vein for drainage and right internal [[jugular vein]] for infusion.&lt;ref name="pmid19033774"/&gt; Alternatively, a dual-lumen catheter is inserted into the right internal jugular vein, draining blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae and returning it to the right atrium.

== Initiation ==
ECMO should be performed only by clinicians with training and experience in its initiation, maintenance, and discontinuation. ECMO management is commonly performed by a Respiratory Therapist or Perfusionist. Once it has been decided that ECMO will be initiated, the person is anticoagulated with intravenous [[heparin]] and then the cannulae are inserted. ECMO support is initiated once the cannulae are connected to the appropriate limbs of the ECMO circuit.

=== Cannulation ===
Cannulae can be placed percutaneously by the [[Seldinger technique]], a relatively straightforward and common method for obtaining access to blood vessels, or via surgical cutdown. The largest cannulae that can be placed in the vessels are used in order to maximize flow and minimize shear stress.

ECMO required for complications post-cardiac surgery can be placed directly into the appropriate chambers of the heart or great vessels. Central cannulation via lateral thoracotomy allows patients awaiting lung transplantation to remain unsedated and ambulatory.&lt;ref&gt;https://ccforum.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/cc10704&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Titration ===
Following cannulation and connection to the ECMO circuit, the appropriate amount of blood flow through the ECMO circuit is determined using hemodynamic parameters and physical exam. Goals of maintaining end-organ perfusion via ECMO circuit are balanced with sufficient physiologic blood flow through the heart to prevent stasis and subsequent formation of blood clot.

== Maintenance ==
[[File:A Resperatory Therapist treating a newborn child Pulaski County Technical College Respiratory Therapist Program.jpg|thumb|A [[respiratory therapist]] 
takes a blood sample from a newborn in preparation for ECMO therapy. ]]
Once the initial respiratory and hemodynamic goals have been achieved, the blood flow is maintained at that rate. Frequent assessment and adjustments are facilitated by continuous venous oximetry, which directly measures the oxyhemoglobin saturation of the blood in the venous limb of the ECMO circuit.

=== Special considerations ===
VV ECMO is typically used for respiratory failure, while VA ECMO is used for cardiac failure. There are unique considerations for each type of ECMO, which influence management.

==== Blood flow ====
Near-maximum flow rates are usually desired during VV ECMO to optimize oxygen delivery. In contrast, the flow rate used during VA ECMO must be high enough to provide adequate perfusion pressure and venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (measured on drainage blood) but low enough to provide sufficient preload to maintain left ventricular output.

==== Diuresis ====
Since most people are fluid-overloaded when ECMO is initiated, aggressive [[diuresis]] is warranted once the person is stable on ECMO. Ultrafiltration can be easily added to the ECMO circuit if the person has inadequate urine output. ECMO "chatter", or instability of ECMO waveforms, represents under-resuscitation and would support cessation of aggressive diuresis of ultrafiltration.

==== Left ventricular monitoring ====
Left ventricular output is rigorously monitored during VA ECMO because left ventricular function can be impaired from increased afterload, which can in turn lead to formation of thrombus within the heart.&lt;ref name="pmid15818357"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19028644"/&gt;

== Weaning and discontinuing ==
For those with respiratory failure, improvements in radiographic appearance, pulmonary compliance, and arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation indicate that the person may be ready to be taken off of ECMO support. For those with cardiac failure, enhanced aortic pulsatility correlates with improved left ventricular output and indicates that they may be ready to be taken off of ECMO support. Once the decision has been made to discontinue ECMO, the cannulae are removed.

=== Veno-venous ECMO liberation trial ===
VV ECMO trials are performed by eliminating all countercurrent sweep gas through the oxygenator. Extracorporeal blood flow remains constant, but gas transfer does not occur. They are then observed for several hours, during which the ventilator settings that are necessary to maintain adequate oxygenation and ventilation off ECMO are determined as indicated by arterial and venous blood gas results.

=== Veno-arterial ECMO liberation trial ===
VA ECMO trials require temporary clamping of both the drainage and infusion lines, while allowing the ECMO circuit to circulate through a bridge between the arterial and venous limbs. This prevents [[thrombosis]] of stagnant blood within the ECMO circuit. In addition, the arterial and venous lines should be flushed continuously with heparinized saline or intermittently with heparinized blood from the circuit. In general, VA ECMO trials are shorter in duration than VV ECMO trials because of the higher risk of thrombus formation.

== Complications ==
===Neurologic===
A common consequence in ECMO-treated adults is neurological injury, which may include intracerebral hemorrhage, [[subarachnoid hemorrhage]], ischemic infarctions in susceptible areas of the brain, hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, unexplained coma, and brain death.&lt;ref name="pmid21825216"/&gt;  Bleeding occurs in 30 to 40 percent of those receiving ECMO and can be life-threatening. It is due to both the necessary continuous heparin infusion and platelet dysfunction. Meticulous surgical technique, maintaining platelet counts greater than 100,000/mm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and maintaining the target [[activated clotting time]] reduce the likelihood of bleeding.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Blood===
[[Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia]] (HIT) is increasingly common among people receiving ECMO. When HIT is suspected, the heparin infusion is usually replaced by a non-heparin anticoagulant.&lt;ref name="pmid17667231"/&gt;

There is retrograde blood flow in the descending aorta whenever the femoral artery and vein are used for VA ECMO. Stasis of the blood can occur if left ventricular output is not maintained, which may result in thrombosis.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Mechanical ventilation===
The CESAR study has shown an improvement in 6 month survival without severe disability in patients getting ECMO versus conventional ventilation in ARDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Peek GJ, Mugford M, Tiruvoipati R, Wilson A, Allen E, Thalanany MM, Hibbert CL, Truesdale A, Clemens F, Cooper N, Firmin RK, Elbourne D | date = Oct 2009 | title = Efficacy and economic assessment of conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR): a multicentre randomised controlled trial| url = | journal = Lancet | volume = 374 | issue = 9698| pages = 1351–63 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61069-2 | pmid=19762075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridge to assist device===
In VA ECMO, those whose cardiac function does not recover sufficiently to be weaned from ECMO may be bridged to a ventricular assist device (VAD) or transplant. A variety of complications can occur during cannulation, including vessel perforation with bleeding, arterial dissection, distal ischemia, and incorrect location (e.g., venous cannula placed within the artery), but these events occur highly infrequently.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Children===
Preterm infants are at unacceptably high risk for [[intraventricular hemorrhage]] (IVH) if administered ECMO at a gestational age less than 32 weeks.&lt;ref name="RadiologySource"/&gt;

==Research==
A 2014 study showed that a factor XIIa inhibitory antibody provides thromboprotection in extracorporeal circulation without increasing bleeding risk.&lt;ref name="pmid = 24500405"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Larsson M, Rayzman V, Nolte MW, etal | title = A Factor XIIa Inhibitory Antibody Provides Thromboprotection in Extracorporeal Circulation Without Increasing Bleeding Risk. | journal = Sci.

[[File:VIA Mini-ITX Form Factor Comparison.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Comparison of some common [[motherboard]] form factors]]
'''Form factor''' is an aspect of hardware [[design]] which defines and prescribes the size, shape, and other physical [[specification (technical standard)|specifications]] of components, particularly in [[consumer electronics]] and [[electronic packaging]].&lt;ref name="webopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/F/form_factor.html|website=Webopedia|publisher=Quinstreet Enterprise|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techtarget"&gt;{{cite web|title=Form factor|url=http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/form-factor|website=WhatIs.com|publisher=TechTarget|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A form factor may represent a broad class of similarly sized components, or it may prescribe a specific standard.

==Evolution and standardization==
As electronic hardware has become smaller following [[Moore's law]] and related patterns, ever-smaller form factors have become feasible. Specific technological advances, such as [[PCI Express]], have had a significant design impact, though form factors have historically been slower to evolve than individual components. [[Standardization]] of form factors is vital for compatibility of hardware from different manufacturers.

==Trade-offs==
Smaller form factors may offer more efficient use of limited space, greater flexibility in the placement of components within a larger assembly, reduced use of material, and greater ease of transportation and use. However, smaller form factors typically incur greater costs in the [[design]], [[manufacturing]], and [[corrective maintenance|maintenance]] phases of the [[product lifecycle|engineering lifecycle]], and do not allow the same expansion options as larger form factors. In particular, the design of smaller form factor computers and network equipment must entail careful consideration of [[computer cooling|cooling]].&lt;ref name="sff_network"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=John|title=Passive Cooling – An Experiment|url=https://smallformfactor.net/reviews/passive-cooling-experiment|website=SFF Network|publisher=Minutiae|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[End user|End-user]] maintenance and repair of small form factor electronic devices such as mobile phones is often not possible, and may be discouraged by [[warranty]] [[voidable|voiding]] clauses; such devices require professional servicing—or simply replacement—when they fail.&lt;ref name="prowse"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prowse|first1=David L.|title=CompTIA A+ Exam Cram: Mobile Device Hardware and Operating Systems|url=http://www.pearsonitcertification.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1926198|website=Pearson IT Certification|publisher=Pearson Education|accessdate=13 June 2016|date=September 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

'''[[Computer form factor]]s''' comprise a number of specific industry standards for [[motherboard]]s, specifying dimensions, [[power supply|power supplies]], placement of mounting holes and [[computer port (hardware)|ports]], and other parameters. Other types of form factors for computers include:
* [[Small form factor]] (SFF), a more loosely defined set of standards which may refer to both motherboards and [[computer case]]s. SFF devices include mini-towers and  [[home theater PC]]s.
* [[Pizza box form factor]], a wide, flat case form-factor used for computers and network switches; often sized for installation in a [[19-inch rack]].

===Components===
* [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|Hard disk drive form factors]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive
* [[Disc form factors|Hard disk enclosure form factor]], the physical dimensions of a computer hard drive enclosure

===Mobile form factors===
* [[Laptop]] or notebook, a form of portable computer with a "clamshell" form factor.
* [[Subnotebook]], [[ultra-mobile PC]], [[netbook]], and [[tablet computer]], various form factors for devices which are smaller and often cheaper than a typical notebook.
* [[Form factor (mobile phones)|Mobile phone form factor]], comprising the size, shape, layout, and style of mobile phones. Broad categories of form factors include bars, [[flip (form)|flip phones]], and sliders, with many subtypes and variations of each.

The '''history of the motorcycle''' begins in the second half of the 19th century. [[Motorcycle]]s are descended from the "[[safety bicycle]]," a bicycle with front and rear wheels of the same size and a pedal crank mechanism to drive the rear wheel.&lt;ref name="The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past - 1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling - From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite some early landmarks in its development, the motorcycle lacks a rigid pedigree that can be traced back to a single idea or machine. Instead, the idea seems to have occurred to numerous engineers and inventors around Europe at around the same time.

==Early steam-powered cycles==
[[File:Copeland stoomfiets 1894.jpg|thumb|Lucius Copeland 1894]]
In the 1860s [[Pierre Michaux]], a [[blacksmith]] in Paris, founded 'Michaux et Cie' ("Michaux and company"), the first company to construct [[bicycle]]s with [[bicycle pedal|pedals]] called a [[velocipede]] at the time, or "Michauline".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crazyguyonabike.com/doc/page/?o=3Tzut&amp;page_id=40617&amp;v=9j Michauline]&lt;/ref&gt; The first steam powered motorcycle, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], can be traced to 1867, when Pierre's son Ernest Michaux fitted a small steam engine to one of the 'velocipedes'.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess Wise|first=David|title=Historic Motor Cycles|publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited|isbn=0-600-34407-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design went to America when [[Pierre Lallement]], a Michaux employee who also claimed to have developed the prototype in 1863, filed for the first bicycle patent with the US patent office in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bicycling.about.com/od/thebikelife/ss/History_3.htm|title=The Boneshaker - Invented by Michaux and Lallement|last=Fiedler|first=David|work=About.com|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868 an American, [[Sylvester H. Roper]] of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]] developed a twin-cylinder [[Roper steam velocipede|steam velocipede]], with a coal-fired boiler between the wheels. Roper's contribution to motorcycle development ended suddenly when he died demonstrating one of his machines in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] on June 1, 1896.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

Also in 1868, a French engineer [[Louis-Guillaume Perreaux]] patented a similar steam powered single cylinder machine, the [[Michaux-Perreaux steam velocipede]], with an alcohol burner and twin belt drives, which was possibly invented independently of Roper's. Although the patent is dated 1868, nothing indicates the invention had been operable before 1871.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

In 1881, [[Lucius Copeland]] of [[Phoenix, Arizona]] designed a much smaller steam boiler which could drive the large rear wheel of an [[American Star Bicycle|American Star]] [[Penny-farthing|high-wheeler]] at 12&amp;nbsp;mph. In 1887 Copeland formed the Northrop Manufacturing Co. to produce the first successful 'Moto-Cycle' (actually a three-wheeler).&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt;

==Experimentation and invention==
[[File:Butler's Patent Velocycle.jpg|left|thumb|Butler's Patent Velocycle]]
The very first commercial design for a self-propelled [[bicycle]] was a three-wheel design called the ''Butler Petrol Cycle'', conceived of and built by [[Edward Butler (inventor)|Edward Butler]] in [[England]] in 1884.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/394358/motorcycle|title=motorcycle (vehicle)|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt; He exhibited his plans for the vehicle at the [[Stanley Cycle Show]] in London in 1884, two years earlier than [[Karl Benz]] invented his first automobile who is generally recognized as the inventor of the modern automobile. Butler's vehicle was also the first design to be shown at the 1885 [[International Inventions Exhibition]] in London.

The vehicle was built by the [[Merryweather &amp; Sons|Merryweather Fire Engine]] company in [[Greenwich, England|Greenwich]], in 1888.&lt;ref name="Georgano"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[G.N. Georgano]]|title=Early and Vintage Years, 1885-1930: The Golden Era of Coachbuilding|publisher=Mason Crest Publishers|year=2002|page=22|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1590844912&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Butler '''Petrol Cycle''' (first recorded use of the term)&lt;ref name="Georgano" /&gt; It was a three-wheeled vehicle, with the rear wheel directly driven by a &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;hp (466W) 600 cc (40 in&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; 2¼×5-inch {57×127-mm})&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; flat twin [[four stroke]] engine (with [[magneto]] ignition replaced by coil and battery),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; equipped with [[rotary valves]] and a float-fed [[carburettor]] (five years before [[Wilhelm Maybach|Maybach]]),&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; and [[Ackermann steering geometry|Ackermann steering]],&lt;ref&gt;[[G.N. Georgano]], p.20 cap.&lt;/ref&gt; all of which were state of the art at the time. Starting was by compressed air.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; The engine was liquid-cooled, with a [[radiator]] over the rear driving wheel. Speed was controlled by means of a [[throttle]] valve lever. No braking system was fitted; the vehicle was stopped by raising and lowering the rear driving wheel using a foot-operated lever; the weight of the machine was then borne by two small castor wheels. The driver was seated between the front wheels.&lt;ref name="Georgano"/&gt; It wasn't, however, a commercial success, as Butler failed to find sufficient financial backing.

[[File:Daimler-1-motorcycle-1.jpg|thumb|Replica of the 1885 Daimler-Maybach [[Daimler Reitwagen|''Reitwagen'']]]]
Another early [[internal combustion engine|internal combustion]], [[petroleum]] fueled motorcycle was the [[Daimler Reitwagen|''Petroleum Reitwagen]]. It was designed and built by the German inventors [[Gottlieb Daimler]] and [[Wilhelm Maybach]] in [[Bad Cannstatt]], Germany in 1885.&lt;ref name="ThePast1800s"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Past –  1800s: First motorcycle | work=The History and Future of Motorcycles and motorcycling –  From 1885 to the Future, Total Motorcycle Website | url=http://www.totalmotorcycle.com/future.htm#1800s | accessdate=28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This vehicle was unlike either the [[safety bicycle]]s or the [[Boneshaker (bicycle)|boneshaker]] bicycles of the era in that it had zero degrees of [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Steering axis angle|steering axis angle]] and no [[Bicycle and motorcycle geometry#Fork offset|fork offset]], and thus did not use the principles of [[bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]] developed nearly 70 years earlier. Instead, it relied on two outrigger wheels to remain upright while turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Inventing Modern: Growing Up with X-Rays, Skyscrapers, and Tailfins |first=John H. |last=Lienhard |publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]] |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-518951-5 |pages=120&amp;ndash;121 |authorlink=John H. Lienhard }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The inventors called their invention the ''Reitwagen'' ("riding car"). It was designed as an expedient testbed for their new engine, rather than a true prototype vehicle.&lt;ref name=Setright1979&gt;{{Cite book |last= Setright |first=L.J.K. |authorlink=L. J. K.

==First commercial products==
In the decade from the late 1880s, dozens of designs and machines emerged, particularly in Germany and in England, and soon spread to America.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"&gt;{{cite web | title= An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse | author= Ian Chadwick | work= British Motorcycle Manufacturers | date= June 30, 2001 | url= http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/britbikes/index.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During this early period of motorcycle history there were many manufacturers, since bicycle makers were adapting their designs for the new [[internal combustion engine]].

[[File:1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller diagram.png|thumb|left|Diagram of 1894 Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller.]]
In 1894 [[Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmüller]] became the first series production motorcycle, and the first to be called a "motorcycle" ({{lang-de|Motorrad}}).&lt;ref name=Setright1979/&gt;&lt;ref name=Falco1999/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kresnak|first= Bill|year= 2008|title= Motorcycling for Dummies|publisher= [[For Dummies]], [[Wiley Publishing]]|isbn= 0-470-24587-5|location= [[Hoboken, New Jersey]]|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZPgrJByqp4wC|page= |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Brief History of the Marque: Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller | work= Hildebrand &amp; Wolfmuller Motorad, European Motorcycle Universe | url= http://www.cybermotorcycle.com/euro/brands/hildebrand_wolfmuller.htm | accessdate= 28 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only a few hundred examples of this motorcycle were ever built.

[[Excelsior Motor Company]], originally a bicycle-manufacturing company based in [[Coventry]] in Warwickshire ([[England]]), began production of their first motorcycle model in 1896, available for purchase by the public. The first production motorcycle in the US was the Orient-Aster, built by [[Metz Company|Charles Metz]] in 1898 at his factory in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]].

In 1898, [[Peugeot Motocycles]] presents at the [[Paris Motor Show|Paris Motorshow]] the first motorcycle equipped with a Dion-Bouton motor. Peugeot Motocycles remains the oldest motorcycle manufacturer in the world.

In the early period of motorcycle history, many producers of [[bicycle]]s adapted their designs to accommodate the new internal-combustion engine. As the engines became more powerful and designs outgrew the bicycle origins, the number of motorcycle producers increased. Many of the nineteenth-century inventors who worked on early motorcycles often moved on to other inventions. Daimler and Roper, for example, both went on to develop automobiles.

At the turn of the 20th century the first major mass-production firms emerged. [[File:Fn-1913.jpg|thumb|A 1913 FN (Fabrique National), Belgium, 4 cylinders and shaft drive]]
In 1901 English quadricycle- and bicycle-maker [[Royal Enfield]] introduced its first motorcycle, with a 239&amp;nbsp;cc engine mounted in the front and driving the rear wheel through a belt. In 1898 English bicycle-maker [[Triumph Engineering Co Ltd|Triumph]] decided to extend its focus to include motorcycles, and by 1902 the company had produced its first motorcycle—a bicycle fitted with a Belgian-built engine. A year later it was the largest motorcycle-manufacturer, with an annual production of over 500 units. Other British firms included [[Norton Motorcycle Company|Norton]] and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company]] who began motorbike production in 1902 and 1910, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bikes4sale.in/wp/756/history-of-motorbikes/|title= History of Motorbikes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901 the [[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian {{not a typo|Motocycle}} Manufacturing Company]], which had been founded by two former bicycle-racers, designed the so-called "diamond framed" Indian Single, whose engine was built by the Aurora Firm in [[Illinois]] per Indian's specifications. The Single was made available in the deep blue. Indian's production was up to over 500 bikes by 1902, and would rise to 32,000, its best ever, in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink = Mick Walker (motorcycling) |last = Walker |first= Mick |year= 2006 |title= Motorcycle: Evolution, Design, Passion |publisher= JHU Press |isbn= 978-0-8018-8530-3 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AHSlknpjrgAC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Indian+largest#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher= The AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame Museum |title= George Hendee |url= http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |accessdate= 8 August 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090910021152/http://www.motorcyclemuseum.org/halloffame/hofbiopage.asp?id=68 |archivedate= September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American company [[Harley-Davidson]] started producing motorcycles in 1903.

During this period, experimentation and innovation were driven by the popular new sport of [[motorcycle racing]], with its powerful incentive to produce tough, fast, reliable machines. These enhancements quickly found their way to the public's machines.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

Chief [[August Vollmer]] of the [[Berkeley, California]] [[Police Department]] is credited{{by whom|date=October 2017}} with organizing the first official [[police motorcycle]]-patrol in the United States in 1911.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;{{cite web | title= Our History | work= Berkeley Police Department Online, City of Berkeley, CA | url= http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/police/history/history.html | accessdate= 2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1914, motorcycles were no longer just bicycles with engines; they had their own technologies, although many still maintained bicycle elements, like the seats and suspension.

==The First World War==
[[File:Triumph 1922 H 1.jpg|thumb|[[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] [[Triumph Type H|Model H]], was mass-produced for the war effort and notable for its reliability.]]
During the [[First World War]], motorbike production was greatly ramped up for the war effort to supply effective communications with front line troops. Messengers on horses were replaced with [[dispatch rider]]s on motorcycles carrying messages, performing reconnaissance personnel and acting as a military police. American company [[Harley-Davidson]] was devoting over 50% of its factory output toward military contract by the end of the war. The British company [[Triumph Engineering|Triumph Motorcycles]] sold more than 30,000 of its [[Triumph Type H]] model to [[Triple Entente|allied forces]] during the war. With the rear wheel driven by a belt, the Model H was fitted with a 499&amp;nbsp;cc air-cooled [[four-stroke]] single-cylinder engine. It was also the first Triumph not to be fitted with pedals, so was a true motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |title=Triumph history |accessdate=2009-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229100156/http://www.triumph1.com/triumph_history.htm |archivedate=December 29, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Model H in particular, is regarded by many as having been the first "modern motorcycle".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycle-usa.com/689/2598/Motorcycle-Article/Triumph-Motorcycle-History.aspx|title=Triumph Motorcycle History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced in 1915 it had a 550cc side-valve four-stroke engine with a three-speed gearbox and belt transmission. It was so popular with its users that it was nicknamed the "Trusty Triumph."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Triumph Motorcycles timeline|url=http://www.ianchadwick.com/motorcycles/triumph/time01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1920, [[Harley-Davidson]] became the largest manufacturer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pcmotors.com/harley.html|title=History of Harley-Davidson Motor Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; with their motorcycles being sold by dealers in 67 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=HOG WILD; U of T professor Brendan Calder is one of the legions of baby boomers who have helped to ensure the success of the Harley-Davidson brand name, not to mention its bottom line.|first=Sharda |last=Prashad |periodical=Toronto Star |location=Toronto, Ont.|date=16 April 2006 | page=A.16 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/1021570771.html?dids=1021570771:1021570771&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Harley-Davidson at 100 |first=Jeremy |last=Cato |periodical=The Vancouver Sun |location=Vancouver, B.C. |date=8 August 2003 |page=E.1.Fro }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BMW Motorrad|BMW motorcycles]] came on the scene in 1923 with a shaft drive and an [[Flat-twin engine|opposed-twin or "boxer"]] [[Unit construction|engine enclosed with the transmission]] in a single aluminum housing.

By 1931, Indian and Harley-Davidson were the only two American manufacturers producing commercial motorcycles.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"&gt;{{cite web|title=HD History: Timeline - 1930s |work=Harley-Davidson USA (2001-2007 H-D) |url=http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4!-74508550!1457951189&amp;locale=en_US |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002044/http://www.harley-davidson.com/wcm/Content/Pages/H-D_History/history_1930s.jsp?HDCWPSession=lG1xFnTQTTXKR0p6wpHB1N1cHtzdJ1250h8CvxtWctfBkvrFnRG4%21-74508550%211457951189&amp;locale=en_US |archivedate=September 28, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This two-company rivalry in the United States remained until 1953, when the Indian Motorcycle factory in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] closed and [[Royal Enfield]] took over the Indian name.&lt;ref name="Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History"&gt;{{cite web|title=Post 1953 Indian Motorcycle History |work=www.cycletownusa.com |url=http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |accessdate=2007-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704104051/http://www.cycletownusa.com/post1953.html |archivedate=July 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were over 80 different makes of motorcycle available in Britain in the 1930s, from the familiar marques like [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]], Triumph and [[AJS]] to the obscure, with names like New Gerrard, NUT, SOS, Chell and Whitwood,&lt;ref name="British Motorcycles of the 1930s"&gt;{{cite web | title=British Motorcycles of the 1930s | work=www.webBikeWorld.com, webWorld International, LLC (2001-2007) | url=http://www.webbikeworld.com/books/british-motorcycles-1930.htm | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
about twice as many motorcycle makes competing in the world market during the early 21st century.

In 1937, Joe Petrali set a new [[land speed record]] of 136.183&amp;nbsp;mph (219.165&amp;nbsp;km/h) on a modified Harley-Davidson 61&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (1,000&amp;nbsp;cc) overhead valve-driven motorcycle.&lt;ref name="HD History: Timeline - 1930s"/&gt;
The same day, Petrali also broke the speed record for 45&amp;nbsp;cubic inch (737&amp;nbsp;cc) engine motorcycles.

In Europe, production demands, driven by the buildup to World War II, included motorcycles for military use, and [[Birmingham Small Arms Company#World War II|BSA]] supplied 126,000 [[BSA M20]] motorcycles to the British armed forces, starting in 1937 and continuing until 1950. Royal Enfield also produced motorcycles for the military, including a 125&amp;nbsp;cc lightweight motorcycle that could be dropped (in a parachute-fitted tube cage) from an aircraft.

===After World War II===
[[File:Vespasidecar.JPG|thumb|An original [[Vespa]] with [[sidecar]]]]
After the World War II, some American veterans found a replacement for the camaraderie, excitement, danger and speed of life at war in motorcycles. Grouped into loosely organized clubs, motorcycle riders in the US created a new social institution—the [[motorcyclist]]s or "bikers"—which was later skewed by the "outlaw" persona [[Marlon Brando]] portrayed in the 1953 film ''[[The Wild One]]''.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958 | work=[[The Art of the Motorcycle]], Guggenheim Museum | url=http://pastexhibitions.guggenheim.org/motorcycle/motorcycle/1946-1958.html | accessdate=2014-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, on the other hand, post-war motorcycle producers were more concerned with designing practical, economical transportation than the social aspects, or "biker" image.&lt;ref name="Freedom and Postwar Mobility: 1946-1958"/&gt;
Italian designer [[Piaggio]] introduced the [[Vespa]] in 1946, which experienced immediate and widespread popularity. Imports from the UK, Italy and Germany, thus found a niche in US markets that American bikes did not fill.

The [[Birmingham Small Arms Company|BSA Group]] purchased Triumph Motorcycles in 1951 to become the largest producer of motorcycles in the world claiming "one in four".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} The German [[NSU Motorenwerke AG|NSU]] was the largest manufacturer from 1955{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} until 1959 when [[Honda]] became the largest manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Cases in contemporary strategy analysis |first1= Robert M. |last1= Grant |first2= Kent E. |last2= Neupert |edition= 3rd |publisher= [[Wiley-Blackwell]] |year= 2003 |isbn= 1-4051-1180-1 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XF7V9w8ByrcC&amp;pg=PA172 |accessdate= 2010-11-12 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[File:ZweiRadMuseumNSU Triumph Bonneville.JPG|thumb|A 1962 Triumph Bonneville represents the popularity of British motorcycles at that time]]
British manufacturers Triumph, BSA, and [[Norton (motorcycle)|Norton]] retained a dominant position in some markets until the rise of the Japanese manufacturers, led by Honda, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The role of the motorcycle shifted in the 1960s, from the tool of a life to a toy of a lifestyle. It became part of an image, of status, a cultural icon for individualism, a prop in Hollywood B-movies.&lt;ref name="An overview of the British motorcycle industry and its collapse"/&gt;

The motorcycle also became a recreational machine for sport and leisure, a vehicle for carefree youth, not essential transportation for the mature family man or woman, and the Japanese were able to produce modern designs more quickly, more cheaply, and of better quality than their competitors. Their motorbikes were more stylish and more reliable, so the British manufacturers fell behind as mass-market producers.

Honda, which was officially founded in Japan on September 24, 1948, introduced their [[SOHC]] [[inline-four engine]] [[Honda CB750|CB750]] in 1969, which was inexpensive and immediately successful.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} It established the across-the-frame-four engine configuration as a design with huge potential for power and performance. Shortly after the introduction of the SOHC, Kawasaki demonstrated the potential of the four-stroke four-cylinder engine with the introduction of the [[Kawasaki Z1|KZ900]].

[[Suzuki]], [[Kawasaki motorcycles|Kawasaki]] and the [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] each started producing motorcycles in the 1950s. Meanwhile, the sun was setting on British dominion over the big-displacement motorbike market.

===Japanese dominance===
[[File:Honda CB750a.JPG|thumb|The [[Honda CB750]] revolutionized motorcycle marketing and was emblematic of Japanese dominance]]
The excellence of Japanese motorcycles caused similar effects in all Western markets: many Italian bike firms either went bust or only just managed to survive. As a result, BMW's worldwide sales sagged in the 1960s, but came back strongly with the introduction of a completely redesigned [[BMW R75/5|"slash-5"]] series for model year 1970.

From the 1960s through the 1990s, small two-stroke motorcycles were popular worldwide, partly as a result of the pioneering work of the [[East German]] Daniel Zimmermann (rotary disc valve) and [[MZ Motorrad- und Zweiradwerk|MZ]]'s Walter Kaaden who developed the two-stroke expansion chamber in the 1950s. These ideas were taken up by Suzuki when [[Ernst Degner]], the MZ engineer and rider, defected to the West on 13 September 1961 after retiring from the 125cc Swedish Grand Prix at Kristianstad. Degner, an excellent engineer, immediately joined Suzuki and his knowledge became their technology springboard.

[[Harley-Davidson]] in the US at the time suffered from the same problems as the European firms, but its unique product range, American tariff laws and nationalism-driven customer loyalty allowed it to survive. One alleged flaw, however, was retaining the characteristic Harley-Davidson 45° [[V-twin|engine vee-angle]], which causes [[Engine balance|excess vibration]] as well as the loping Harley-Davidson sound.

A factory full fairing was introduced by BMW motorcycle in the R100RS of 1977, the first factory fairing produced in quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motorcycleclassics.com/motorcycle-reviews/2008-01-01/bmw-r100rs.aspx|title=1977 BMW R100RS |publisher=Motorcycle Classics|accessdate=2009-08-10|date=January–February 2008|author=Bill Stermer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, BMW stimulated the "adventure touring" category of motorcycling with its [[dual-sport motorcycle|dual-sport]] model, the [[BMW R80G/S|R80G/S]]. In 1988, BMW was the first motorcycle manufacturer to introduce [[Anti-lock braking system|anti-lock-brakes (ABS)]] on its sporting K100RS-SE and K1 models.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==The present==
[[File:ZX-7RR Wikepedia.jpg|thumb|left|A 2004 [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries|Kawasaki]] ZX-7RR]]
Today the Japanese manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, Suzuki, and Yamaha dominate the large motorcycle industry, although [[Harley-Davidson]] still maintains a high degree of popularity, particularly in the United States.

Recent years have seen a resurgence in the popularity around the world of many other motorcycle brands, including BMW, Triumph and [[Ducati]], and the emergence of [[Victory Motorcycles|Victory]] as a second successful mass-builder of big-twin American cruisers.

In November 2006, the Dutch company E.V.A. Products BV Holland announced that the first commercially available [[Diesel motorcycle|diesel-powered motorcycle]], its Track T-800CDI, achieved production status.&lt;ref name="The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle"&gt;{{cite web | title=The first commercially-available diesel motorcycle | work=www.Gizmag.com (November 20, 2006) | url=http://www.gizmag.com/go/6493/ | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Track T-800CDI uses an 800&amp;nbsp;cc three-cylinder Daimler Chrysler diesel engine. However, other manufacturers, including Royal Enfield, had been producing diesel-powered bikes since at least 1965.&lt;ref name="Diesel motorbikes"&gt;{{cite web | title=Diesel motorbikes | work=Journey to Forever | url=http://journeytoforever.org/biodiesel_bikes.html | accessdate=2007-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the developing world===
[[File:Scooters Bangkok Nana.jpg|thumb|Motorcycle traffic in [[Bangkok]]]]
There is a large demand for small, cheap motorcycles in the developing world, and many of the firms meeting that demand now also compete in mature markets, such as China's [[Hongdou (company)|Hongdou]] which makes a version of Honda's venerable [[Honda CG125|CG125]].&lt;ref name="Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . ."&gt;{{cite web | title=Hongdou Group: Manufacturer &amp; Exporter . . . | work=International Department, Hongdou Motorcycle Co.

'''Julius Ashkin''' (August 23, 1920 – June 4, 1982) was a leader in experimental and theoretical physics known for furthering the evolution of particle physics from nuclear physics. As a theoretical physicist he made contributions in the fields of [[statistical mechanics]], [[Solid-state physics|solid state physics]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[Particle physics|elementary particle physics]]. As an experimental physicist his main contributions concerned the passage of certain particles (pi-mesons, or [[pion]]s) through solid matter and their subsequent decay. He was recognized for the quality of his research and teaching.

== Early life ==
Julius Ashkin was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York,&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=June 7, 1982 |title=Julius Ashkin, 61, Physicist, Dies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/07/obituaries/julius-ashkin-61-physicist-dies.html |accessdate=April 25, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on August 23, 1920. His parents were Isadore and Anna Ashkin. He had two younger siblings, a brother, [[Arthur Ashkin|Arthur]], also a physicist, and a sister, Ruth. One older sibling, Gertrude, died while young. The family home was in Brooklyn, New York, at 983 E 27 Street. Isadore had immigrated to the United States from [[Odessa]], Ukraine at the age of 19. Anna, five years younger, also came from the Ukraine (in her case [[History of the Jews in Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]).&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1930," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/X7X3-3YL : accessed December 23, 2013), Isadore Ashkin, Brooklyn (Districts 1251–1500), Kings, New York, United States; citing enumeration district (ED) 1261, sheet , family 298, NARA microfilm publication.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United States World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917–1918," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/KXY5-7XY : accessed December 23, 2013), Isadore Ashkin, 1917–1918; citing New York City no 86, New York, United States, NARA microfilm publication M1509, (Washington D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d); FHL microfilm 001765586.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United States World War II Draft Registration Cards, 1942," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/F3CQ-T4W : accessed December 23, 2013), Isadore Ashkin, 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"United States Census, 1920," index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/MJRV-1VW : accessed December 23, 2013), Isdor Ashkin, Brooklyn Assembly District 18, Kings, New York, United States; citing sheet , family 342, NARA microfilm publication T625, FHL microfilm 1821173.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a decade of his landing in New York, Isadore had become a U.S. citizen and was running a dental laboratory at 139 Delancey Street in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=columbiacatalogue /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=White-Orr's Reference Register|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6hRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|year=1918|pages=139–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Manhattan Project ==

=== Early stages of the Manhattan Project at Columbia University===
During the latter part of 1942, before completing his Ph.D. work, Ashkin accepted an offer to work in the Manhattan Project. Early work on the development of the atom bomb had taken place at Columbia during the six years Ashkin was an undergradutate and graduate student there. When the process of nuclear fission was discovered in 1938, scientists in many locations in Europe and the United States began intense work to understand and control the phenomenon. Researchers at Columbia and nearby Princeton University were in the forefront of this work. There's no information on how much, if at all, Ashkin was involved in the effort at this early stage of his career, but it is certain that the Columbia physics department was the workplace for scientists who were devoted to the secret development of a new and phenomenally powerful weapon. These men included men already mentioned &amp;mdash; Fermi, Rabi, Teller, and Bethe &amp;mdash; as well as [[Leó Szilárd]] (who worked with Fermi to demonstrate that a nuclear reaction was possible), [[Herbert L. Anderson]] (then, like Ashkin, a Columbia graduate student), [[John R. Dunning]] (an associate professor at Columbia who had built a small cyclotron in the mid-1930s), [[Walter Zinn]] (a Columbia professor who worked with the Columbia cyclotron to demonstrate the possibility of a sustained chain reaction), [[George B. Pegram]] (Dean of Columbia's Faculties of Political Science, Philosophy, and Pure Science, who helped bring Fermi to the United States and brought him together with representatives of the U.S. Navy Department for the first discussion of the atomic bomb) and [[Harold Urey]] (associate professor of Chemistry whose work on separation of isotopes resulted in the discovery of deuterium).&lt;ref name='nuclearfission'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/acap/topics/fission.jsp | title = Nuclear Fission, 1938–1942 | accessdate = December 9, 2013 | work = Array of Contemporary American Physicists, American Institute of Physics | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131024002456/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/topics/fission.jsp | archivedate = October 24, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Columbia received visits from scientists at Princeton University who were coordinating their work with Columbia colleagues. These included [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]], [[Edward Creutz]],&lt;ref name='creutz'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/Creutz_Edward.pdf | title = Edward Chester Creutz, 1913–2009, a Biographical Memoir | accessdate = December 8, 2013 | last = Hinman | first = George | year = 2010 | format = pdf | publisher = National Academy of Sciences | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222054142/http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/Creutz_Edward.pdf | archivedate = February 22, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert R. Wilson]].&lt;ref name=nuclearfission /&gt;

=== Metallurgical Laboratory ===
When Ashkin accepted an invitation to join the Manhattan Project he was still working on his Ph.D. He spent the last few months of 1942 at the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the University of Chicago and then worked at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] from mid-1943 to mid-1945. The scientists at the Metallurgical Laboratory, or Met Lab as it was called, used a nuclear reactor called the [[Chicago Pile-1|Chicago Pile]] to produce the world's first controlled chain reaction.&lt;ref name='firstpile'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull040su/04005004147su.pdf | title = The First Pile | accessdate = December 26, 2013 | last = Allardice | first = Corbin | author2 = Edward R.

They had been brought together from Columbia and Princeton by [[Arthur Compton]] who was a professor of physics at the University of Chicago. The Met Lab consisted of two divisions. Fermi, Anderson, Zinn, Creutz, and Szilard were key members of the physics division; Bethe and Teller of the theoretical division.&lt;ref name='manhattanacap'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp | title = The Manhattan Project and predecessor organizations | accessdate = December 9, 2013 | work = Array of Contemporary Scientists, American Institute of Physics | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121017032813/http://www.aip.org/history/acap/institutions/manhattan.jsp | archivedate = October 17, 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Ashkin's interest, experience, and skill would seem to place him with the theoretical division, he worked in the physics division in a group called "Nuclear Physics &amp;mdash; Experimental." His placement in this group suggests that Ashkin had prior experience in carrying out nuclear experiments while a student at Columbia. With the other members of the group &amp;mdash; Feld, Szilard, [[Robert F. Christy]], Herbert E. Kubitschek,&lt;ref name='petition'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dannen.com/decision/45-07-17.html | title = A Petition to the President of the United States | accessdate = December 12, 2013 | author = Leo Szilard| date = July 17, 1945 | work = U.S. National Archives, Record Group 77, Records of the Chief of Engineers, Manhattan Engineer District, Harrison-Bundy File, folder #76|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and S.

=== Los Alamos ===
At Los Alamos Ashkin was assigned to work in the Theoretical Division headed by Bethe. There were five groups in this division and Ashkin was assigned to group 4, Diffusion Problems. His responsibilities, broadly, permitted him to build upon work he had done as a graduate student and in his months at Met Lab. T-4's group leader was Richard Feynman; Ashkin was alternate leader. The initial members were Richard Ehrich,&lt;ref name='ehrlich'&gt;{{cite news | title = Dr. Richard Ehrich, Obituary | date = January 31, 2002 | work = Daily Gazette, Gainesville, Florida }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Frederick Reines]]. {{Interlanguage link multi|Theodore Welton|de}} joined it in the early spring of 1944.&lt;ref name=Schweber1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name='welton'&gt;{{cite news | title = Theodore Allen Welton, Obituary | date = November 23, 2010 | url = http://www.oakridger.com/article/20101123/NEWS/311239994 | work = OakRidger, Oak Ridge, Tennessee | accessdate = December 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group's main task was to estimate the rate at which neutrons would diffuse through the explosive core of the bomb during nuclear fission. Somewhat facetiously Feynman later claimed that the work done at Los Alamos was mostly engineering, not science.&lt;ref name='losalamosfrombelow'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Los Alamos From Below: Reminiscences 1943–1945 | journal = Engineering and Science, California Institute of Technology | date = January–February 1976 | first = Richard | last = Feynman | volume = 39 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Welton, however, told of the group's long hard hours, high spirits and cohesiveness, and said they achieved some excellent successes in theoretical physics.&lt;ref name="Welton2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Welton|first1=Theodore A.|title=Memories of Feynman|journal=Physics Today|volume=60|issue=2|year=2007|pages=46–52|doi=10.1063/1.2711636|bibcode = 2007PhT....60b..46W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='marshakoral'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4760_2.html | title = Oral History Transcript — Dr. Robert E.

In fact, their assistant, an enlisted man named Murray Peshkin, remembered the group as having an unending need for calculation. An undergraduate with a major in physics at the time he was recruited, he was put, as he recalled, "to solving differential equations that were needed to predict the critical mass of a bomb under various assumptions about the many unknown properties of the nuclei in the bomb material."&lt;ref name='peshkin'&gt;{{cite news | first = Murray | last = Peshkin | title = To Be Young, Gifted and Building The Bomb | date = June 24, 2005 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-07-24/features/0507240407_1_manhattan-project-basic-training-los-alamos/3 | work = Chicago Tribune | accessdate = December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Security at Los Alamos was very tight by standards of the time. The site was an uninhabited desert location (formerly a private school) whose perimeter was fenced, with guards at the gates. The scientists were permitted outside the facility but there was little available transportation. (Since they were not members of the military, they could not be ordered to comply with military secrecy orders and instead voluntarily agreed to abide by them.)&lt;ref name=losalamosfrombelow /&gt;&lt;ref name='espionageenclyclopedia'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.faqs.org/espionage/Lo-Mo/Manhattan-Project.html | title = Manhattan Project | accessdate = December 15, 2013 | last = Lerner | first = BrendaWilmoth | work = Espionage Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='fuller'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://science.howstuffworks.com/manhattan-project3.htm | title = Manhattan Project Organization | accessdate = December 15, 2013 | last = Fuller | first = John | work = How the Manhattan Project Worked | publisher = How Stuff Works}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='cid'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Rafalko | first1 = Frank J.

It helped that some of the married ones were able to bring their wives to live in the town of Los Alamos and thus parties of men and women could get together for social activities. These include such things as hikes of hills and canyons of the surrounding wilderness areas. It's likely Ashkin played outdoor team sports while at Los Alamos. A Met Lab colleague remembered playing touch football with him and Feld on an open space called the midway at the University of Chicago.&lt;ref name='agnew'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Early Impressions | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | first = Harold M. | last = Agnew | volume = 38 | issue = 10 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwoAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PP1 |date=December 1982| accessdate = December 21, 2013 | quote = After being associated for 40 years with our nation's nuclear program it's difficult to select a particular incident which stands out above others. It may bemuse my colleagues to know what events I do not choose to write about on this occasion: events such as being with Enrico Fermi on December 2, 1942 under Staff Field; or being over Hiroshima on August 6, 1945; or playing touch football with Bernie Feld and the ''real'' Julius Ashkin (as opposed to the imposter who used Ashkin's name) on the Chicago Midway; or making a one-gram radium beryllium source on an afternoon in New York, putting it in a briefcase, and flying back to Chicago with it under my seat.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feynman was particularly adept at leavening hard work with light-hearted games. His genius was as much playful as serious. He took pride in deceiving the mail censors, guessing the combinations of safes in which secret files were stored, picking door locks, and teasing the guards (he would depart from the main gate, circle around the perimeter to a hole in the fence, re-enter the facility, and then exit the gate again, thus causing confusion and consternation both.) He also liked to pound his bongo drums, a practice which made those within hearing range grit their teeth but which he believed put him in touch with the spirits of the Indians who formerly inhabited the place. Physicists are known for their love of music, particularly classical music, and their ability to play it. Feynman wasn't unusual in his affection for drumming but his choice of musical genres was atypical as was his lack of skill as a drummer.&lt;ref name='music'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Is it the mystery, or the structure, or the discipline?

When Ashkin played the recorder, Feynman said he was using "an infernally popular wooden tube ... for making noises bearing a one-one correspondence to black dots on a piece of paper -- in imitation to music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IWQ_y90P2uIC |year=1992 |publisher=Vintage Books |isbn=978-0-679-74704-8 | page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, before the scientists at Los Alamos dispersed, there was a brief period during which they gave lectures on subjects in which they had expertise. The program was styled the "Los Alamos University" and some junior members of laboratory personnel received college credit for attending them. Ashkin's were on theoretical mechanics.&lt;ref name='losalamosuniversity'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Technical Report AECU-167; (M-4297) | journal = United States Office of Scientific and Technical Information | first = Julius | last = Ashkin | first2 = J. |last2=Keller |first3=C. |last3=Richman }}&lt;/ref&gt; The course description says it covered the dynamics of particles, rigid bodies, elastic media, and fluids using vector analysis, particle dynamics, Lagrange's equations, and Hamilton's equations.&lt;ref name='truslow'&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Truslow | first1 = Edith C. | last2 = Smith | first2 = Ralph Carlisle | title = Manhattan District History: Project Y, the Los Alamos Project, Volume 2: August 1945 through December 1946 | publisher = Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory | date = 1961 &lt;!--release date--&gt; | url = http://www.osti.gov/manhattan-project-history/publications/LANLMDHProjectYPart2.pdf | accessdate = December 14, 2013 | quote = A part of the Manhattan District History commissioned by Leslie R.

Along with other members of the Feynman team, Ashkin produced technical reports while at Los Alamos. These were classified at the time but have since been made public. One example gives an idea of the work carried out by the group. It is ''The Calculation of Critical Masses Including the Effects of the Distribution of Neutron Energies'', by Feynman, R.P.; Welton, T.A.; Ashkin, J.; Ehrlich, R.; Peshkin, M.; and Reines, F.

January 21, 1947 (extract from abstract: "Convenient approximate methods are developed for the calculation of critical sizes and multiplication rates of spherical, active cores surrounded by infinite tampers. Special attention is given to those problems arising from the fact that neutrons of different velocities have different properties. The methods consist essentially of approximating the neutron densities at each velocity by fundamental mode shapes for each velocity.")&lt;ref name='criticalmasses'&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Calculation of Critical Masses Including the Effects of the Distribution of Neutron Energies | journal = Technical Report LA-524(Del.), Los Alamos Scientific Lab., N.

On July 16, 1945 Ashkin was present at the first-ever explosion of a nuclear bomb at the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test site]], Alamogordo. Only a few of the many scientists were permitted to witness this unspeakably dramatic culmination of their work. Ashkin was probably there because of his work on radiation poisoning, begun at Met Lab and probably continued afterward.&lt;ref name= poisoning /&gt;

In 1950 it was revealed that one of the scientists at Los Alamos, [[Klaus Fuchs]], was providing the Soviet intelligence bureau, [[NKGB]], with secret information about bomb research. Between 1943 and 1946, Fuchs worked at both Columbia and Los Alamos. When the FBI interviewed Bethe and Feynman about their relationship with Fuchs while at Los Alamos, Feynman said Fuchs was quiet, reserved and not inclined to mix with other scientists outside of work. He also said he believed Fuchs was less stand-offish with Ashkin and seemed friendly with him.&lt;ref name='fuchs'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://vault.fbi.gov/rosenberg-case/klaus-fuchs/klaus-fuchs-part-62-of | title = FBI Records - Klaus Fuchs - Part 6, Interviews with Associates of Fuchs | accessdate = December 21, 2013 | date = June 1950 | quote = Feynman recalled that he believes Fuchs was friendly at Los Alamos with Dr. Julius Ashkin who is presently at the University of Rochester, Rochester, New York, and with Robert Eugene Marshak and his wife Ruth.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic positions ==

=== University of Rochester ===
On leaving Los Alamos in 1946 Ashkin obtained a position as assistant professor at the University of Rochester and in 1950 he moved to the Carnegie Institute of Technology (later Carnegie Mellon University). He remained at CMU for the rest of his life, serving as professor and for a period head of the physics department. [[Robert Marshak]] brought Ashkin to the University of Rochester in 1946. As an assistant professor he taught mechanics and thermodynamics and theoretical physics and performed pioneering experiments on neutron-proton, proton-proton, and nucleon-nucleon scattering.&lt;ref name=wolfenstein /&gt;&lt;ref name=wolfenstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshakoral /&gt;&lt;ref name='goldberg'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/34461.html | title = Interview with Dr. Joshua Goldberg at Caltech University | accessdate = December 7, 2013 | last = Rickles | first = Dean | date = March 21, 2011 | work = Oral History Transcript | publisher = American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AshkinWu1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashkin|first1=Julius|last2=Wu|first2=Ta-You|title=Neutron-Proton and Proton-Proton Scattering at High Energies|journal=Physical Review|volume=73|issue=9|year=1948|pages=973–985|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.973|bibcode = 1948PhRv...73..973A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WuAshkin1948"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wu|first1=Ta-YOU|last2=Ashkin|first2=Julius|title=Elastic and Inelastic Scattering of 100- to 200-Mev Protons or Neutrons by Deuterons|journal=Physical Review|volume=73|issue=9|year=1948|pages=986–1001|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.73.986|bibcode = 1948PhRv...73..986W }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AshkinMarshak1949"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashkin|first1=J.|last2=Marshak|first2=R.|title=Bremsstrahlung in High Energy Nucleon-Nucleon Collisions|journal=Physical Review|volume=76|issue=1|year=1949|pages=58–60|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.76.58|bibcode = 1949PhRv...76...58A }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Rochester, Ashkin was the first scientist to formally recognize the importance of the [[Feynman diagram]]. Feynman devised the diagram in 1948 to provide a simple visualization of the mathematical expressions governing the behavior of subatomic particles. Although the diagram and its offshoots were later seen as extremely important tools, Feynman did not give them a theoretical framework nor did he explain how he proposed they be used. Physicists had difficulty in understanding their function, distrusted their simplicity, and were reluctant to give them formal recognition. Feynman later said physicists did not realize the diagram's power and would employ a more complex method created by [[Julian Schwinger]]. Ashkin, he said, was the first to break with this pattern: "They somehow or other couldn’t do it. They had to go through this [the Schwinger method] to believe it. But that's all right. The only person who didn't, the first paper where it was used directly — which I kept looking for, I kept flipping through the Physical Review as it came out — was Ashkin. He'd done some calculation for some experiment, and he said, 'We’ve calculated this using Feynman's rules.' Bloop! There it was in writing! Then gradually more and more people did it."&lt;ref name='feynmanaip'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/5020_4.html | title = Interview with Dr. Richard Feynman at Altadena, CA | accessdate = December 7, 2013 | last = Weiner | first = Charles | date = June 28, 1966 | work = Oral History Transcript | publisher = American Institute of Physics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2005A"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kaiser |first1=David |title=Physics and Feynman's Diagrams |journal=American Scientist |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=2005 |page=156 |doi=10.1511/2005.2.156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2005B"&gt;{{cite book |author=David Kaiser |title=Pedagogy and the Practice of Science: Historical and Contemporary Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqqQ8pTdxfEC |year=2005 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-11288-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaiser2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Kaiser|title=Drawing Theories Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman Diagrams in Postwar Physics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_wz9JZvBt78C&amp;pg=PA220 |date=November 15, 2009 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-42265-7 |pages=220–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was teaching at the University of Rochester, Ashkin married Claire Ruderman, a biologist studying at the same university.&lt;ref name="Ashkin1947"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire Ruderman Ashkin|title=A Contribution to the Knowledge of Stridulating Organs in Spiders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJC2tgAACAAJ|year=1947|publisher=University of Rochester.

=== Carnegie Mellon University ===
In 1950 Ashkin joined the physics faculty of Carnegie Mellon University (then the Carnegie Institute of Technology) where Edward Creutz was department head and director of a new 450 MeV proton synchrocyclotron that CIT had built in nearby Saxonburg, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref name=wolfenstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=creutz/&gt; Joining fellow scientists [[Lincoln Wolfenstein]] and Sergio de Benedetti,&lt;ref name='debenedetti'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Sergio DeBenedetti--1912–1994 | journal = Inter-Actions, Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University | year = 1995 | url = http://www.cmu.edu/physics/news/newsletter/interactions1995.pdf | format = pdf | accessdate = December 8, 2013 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140222193246/http://www.cmu.edu/physics/news/newsletter/interactions1995.pdf | archivedate = February 22, 2014 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; at this time Ashkin began to transition from mainly theoretical to mainly experimental work. The cyclotron remained in use at the Saxonburg Nuclear Research Center until the mid-1970s when it was dismantled and, using it, Ashkin was able to produce some of his best-known experimental results.&lt;ref name="Steinberger2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=J.

Fermi could almost reach it and Ashkin could finally see it clearly.

In 1953, with Bethe, his former director of theoretical work in Los Alamos, Ashkin published an article closely related to the work they had then done. This article, "Passage of Radiations Through Matter," summarized the effects of particles and radiation as they passed through solids.&lt;ref name="Segrè1953"&gt;{{cite book|author=Emilio Segrè|title=Experimental Nuclear Physics, Vol. I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox9RAAAAMAAJ|year=1953|publisher=John Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; In time it became a standard reference for physics experimenters.&lt;ref name=wolfenstein/&gt;&lt;ref name="L'Annunziata2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Michael F.

Marshak, Ashkin conducted experiments to determine the characteristics of a short-lived particle &amp;mdash; the pi-meson or [[pion]] &amp;mdash; that is produced when high energy cosmic ray protons and other cosmic ray components interact with matter in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=wolfenstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=marshakoral /&gt;&lt;ref name="AshkinSimon1950"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ashkin |first1=J.|last2=Simon |first2=A. |last3=Marshak |first3=R. |title=On the Scattering of pi-Mesons by Nucleons |journal=Progress of Theoretical Physics |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=1950 |pages=634–668 |doi=10.1143/ptp/5.4.634|bibcode=1950PThPh...5..634A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashkin served as chair of the physics department between 1961 and 1972.&lt;ref name=cmu /&gt; After he died, CMU created the ''Julius Ashkin Teaching Award'' in his honor.&lt;ref name='award'&gt;{{cite journal | title = Mellon College of Science -- Julius Ashkin Teaching Award | journal = Faculty Handbook, Mellon College of Science, Carnegie Mellon University | year = 1988 | url = http://www.cmu.edu/mcs/fac_staff/handbook/ashkin.html | accessdate = December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sabbatical at CERN ===
In 1958–1959 Ashkin won a Ford Foundation grant to spend a sabbatical year in Geneva, Switzerland, at [[CERN]], the European Organization for Nuclear Research.&lt;ref name='fordcern'&gt;{{citation | contribution = Guest Professors | title = Fifth Meeting, Scientific Policy Committee, European Organization for Nuclear Research | date = October 12, 1956 | contribution-url = http://cds.cern.ch/record/1263116/files/CM-P00094814-e.pdf | chapter-format = pdf | accessdate = December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he became a member of the first group of scientists to use that institution's new 600 MeV synchrocyclotron.&lt;ref name='cern1957'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://home.web.cern.ch/about/accelerators/synchrocyclotron | title = The Synchrocyclotron | accessdate = December 7, 2013 | publisher = CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using this particle accelerator he helped to make a significant discovery which confirmed an aspect of the V-A Theory of weak interactions.&lt;ref name='v-a'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://quest.ph.utexas.edu/sudarshan_vminusa.html | title = V-A: Universal Theory of Weak Interaction | accessdate = December 7, 2013 | year = 2006 | work = Seven Science Quests Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AshkinFazzini1959"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ashkin|first1=J.|last2=Fazzini |first2=T.|last3=Fidecaro|first3=G.|last4=Merrison|first4=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7144">'''Knowledge management software''' ('''KM software''') is a subset of [[Enterprise content management]] software, which contains a range of software that specializes in the way information is collected, stored and/or accessed. The concept of [[knowledge management]] is based on a range of practices used by an [[individual]], a [[business]], or a large [[corporation]] to identify, create, represent and redistribute [[information]] for a range of purposes. Software that enables an information practice or range of practices at any  part of the processes of information management can be deemed to be called [[information management]] software. A subset of information management software that emphasizes an approach to build knowledge out of information that is managed or contained is often called [[knowledge management]] software.

KM software in most cases provides a means for individuals, small groups or mid-sized businesses to innovate, build new knowledge in the group, and/or improve customer experience. [[Knowledge management]] systems (software) includes a range of about 1,500 or more different approaches to collect and contain information to then build knowledge that can be searched through specialised search tools including concept building tools and or visual search tools that present information in a connected manager not originally conceptualised by those collecting or maintaining the information database.

One of the main categories of [[Knowledge Management]] software is [[Groupware]], which can be used for knowledge sharing and capture. Groupware is a combination of synchronous, asynchronous and community focused tools. Groupware can be used to exchange knowledge and expertise even when the team members are situated around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{de Carvalho, Rodrigo Baroni, and Marta Araújo Tavares Ferreira. "Knowledge Management Software." Encyclopedia of Knowledge Management, edited by David G. Schwartz, Idea Group Reference, 2006, pp. 410-418. Gale Virtual Reference Library, http://link.galegroup.com.libproxy.tut.fi/apps/doc/CX3467300066/GVRL?u=tuot&amp;sid=GVRL&amp;xid=858f69c8. Accessed 8 Nov. 2018.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Features==
Features of KM software usually include:
* Aggregation of content from both internal and external sources
* Classification of content using [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]]
* Search
* Expertise location
* Views / [[Dashboards (management information systems)|Dashboards]]
As business today is becoming increasingly international, the ability to access information in different languages is now a requirement for some organizations. Reported [[success factors]] of a KM system include the capability to integrate well with existing internal systems&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lehner|first=Franz|author2=Nicolas Haas |title=Knowledge Management Success Factors|journal=Electronic Journal of Knowledge Management|year=2010|volume=8|issue=1|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the [[scalability]] of the system to grow within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=L Feliciano|first=Joe|title=The success criteria for implementing knowledge management systems in an organization|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/dissertations/AAI3235023/|publisher=ETD Collection for Pace University Paper|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=1 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range==
KM software ranges from small software packages for an individual to use, such as [[brainstorming software]], to highly specialized enterprise software suitable for use by hundreds of employees. Often KM software provides a key resource for employees working in customer service or telephone support industries, or sectors of large corporations.

Knowledge management software, in general, enables the combination of unstructured information sources, such as individual word processed documents and/or [[Portable Document Format|.pdf formats]], [[email]], [[Graphics|graphic illustrations]], unstructured [[Memorandum|notes]], [[Hyperlink|website links]], [[invoice]]s, and other information bearing collections, such as a simple thought, through to a combination of millions of interactions from a website, and through that combination enables the seeker to obtain knowledge that otherwise would not have been discovered. As Internet access speeds increased, many on-demand (or [[software as a service]]) products have evolved and are now the leading suppliers of KM software.

==Visual search==
One of the departures from the almost standard [[Keyword (Internet search)|keyword search approach]] are those group of companies developing [[Visual search|visual search techniques]]. Some common visual search approaches include: 
* [[Tree search|Tree traversal]] - Where a folder is opened and inside the display of that folder are further sub-folders. The folders are searched in a specific order, exactly once, in a [[Systematics|systematic]] manner. This tree traversal approach relies on the naming of folders to provide a rich enough indication as to what is contained in the next folder or level of folders.
* [[Taxonomy (general)|Taxonomy navigation]] - A taxonomy (or [[Topic Maps|topic map]]) is the classification of things or concepts, as well as the principles underlying such classification. In KM software, taxonomies are often used as a way of visually structuring the available information by tagging it with relevant topics and visually represent them as folders and sub-folders inside the taxonomy. Users can then navigate the taxonomy and select the topic, or combination of topics ([[faceted search]]), to perform the search on.
* [[Tag cloud|Tag Cloud search]] - Once text data has been tagged with certain topics it can be visually represented as a Tag Cloud, where the importance of each tag is represented as a font size and/or color. This way you can identify and pick the most prominent topics.
* [[Matrix (mathematics)|Matrix]]/[[Heat map|Heat Map search]] - The classification of information into topics facilitates [[Information visualization|visualization]] and [[analysis]] of the information flow. A combined topic search can be presented as values in a Matrix, and a Heat Map is a [[graphical representation]] of that data, presented in colors.

==Knowledge management tools==
Notable knowledge management tools include:
* [[Collective_Knowledge_(software)|Collective Knowledge]] - An open source, portable and command line framework for knowledge management
* [[OpenKM]] - Open Source knowledge management software

'''Electrical lighting technicians''' ('''ELT''') or simply '''lighting tech.''', are involved with rigging stage and location sets and controlling artificial, electric lights for art and entertainment venues ([[theatre]] or live music venues) or in video, television, or [[film]] production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WSCVPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAA Stage Lighting Design: The Art, the Craft, the Life, by Richard Pilbrow on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wrR1QgAACAAJ&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAQ Stage Lighting Design: A Practical Guide,  Neil Fraser, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pXDT_sMBg2YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwAg A Practical Guide to Stage Lighting, By Steven Louis Shelley, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7ttNAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;dq=theatre+lighting+designer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=aCUsU96GIZL5oAT3nIGQCQ&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBA The Lighting Art: The Aesthetics of Stage Lighting Design, by Richard H.

Wolf, Dick Block, on books.google.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a theater production, lighting technicians work under the [[lighting designer]] and [[master electrician]]. In video, television, and film productions, lighting technicians work under the direction of the [[gaffer (filmmaking)|gaffer]] or chief lighting technician who takes their direction from the cinematographer. In live music, lighting technicians work under the lighting director. All heads of department report to the production manager.

==Responsibilities==
Lighting technicians are responsible for the movement and set up of various pieces of lighting equipment for separation of light and shadow or contrast, depth of field or  [[visual effects]]. Lighting Technicians may also lay electrical cables, wire fixtures, install color effects or image patterns, focus the lights, and assist in creating effects or programming sequences.

A lighting technician's work concerns safety of rigging and working with objects which can be very heavy and get very hot.

Some local unions such as the International Alliance of Television Stage Employees (IATSE) Hollywood chapter local #728, have been qualifying members by certification and recognition through the Entertainment Stage Technologies Association (ESTA)with their Entertainment Technicians Certification Program (ETCP). Basic skill sets are now standardized, and sets and stage are safer through this program.

Officially called the '''electrical lighting technician''' (ELT), or the '''rigging electrical lighting technician''' ('''RELT'''), are also called or known as set lighting technicians, lamp operator, electrician, electric, spark or a juicer.  

The lighting technicians on a [[motion picture]] set handle all of the electrical needs as well as place and focus all of the lighting under the direction of the gaffer (chief lighting technician). 

Lighting techs also:

* Study the script and consult with the director to assess what lighting is required (Gaffer)
* Discuss production requirements with the camera operator (Cinematographer)
* Select lights and equipment to be used and organize any additional equipment (Gaffer)
* Set up, focus and operate light fixtures and equipment
* Control consoles and auxiliary equipment
* Choose and combine colors to achieve the desired effect(Cinematographer/Gaffer).
* Operate the lights during the performance
* Use manual or computer control consoles to control lighting throughout a production
* Use devices such as barn-doors, scrims and other attachments to control lighted areas
* Perform routine maintenance functions such as replacing lamps and damaged color filters or patterns and maintain lighting equipment in safe working conditions
* Explore new techniques and special effects
* Placement and focus of lighting fixtures for any given scene to be photographed.
* Distribution of power and work lights around the set and support areas (including [[actor]]'s trailers, portable production offices, catering, etc.).
* Management of [[electrical generators]].
* Providing [[electricity]] to all support services and departments on the set.

Also specialty duties are called upon the lighting technician such as...

* Follow spot operator
* Console/dimmer board operator
* Fixtures
* Manual/ poor mans operator

Hours of work also vary. For example, those employed by large television productions generally work more than 40 hours a week, 60 hours or more are not uncommon. Technicians and other crew members typically work a 12-hour day.

Depending on script requirements, stage and locations bring on their own requirements for lighting and effects. Out of state, or country to get the right look in a script is not uncommon. Location work always brings on its own challenges. Weather is always a factor when going to a location. Technicians are like scouts and have to be prepared for all kinds of weather as per the season.

Working conditions for lighting technicians vary a great deal from one job to another. Lighting technicians generally spend a lot of time on their feet and the pace of work can become hectic. Last-minute changes are often required and safety precautions must be observed when handling hot lamps, climbing ladders or working on high voltage electrical cables and equipment. Lighting technicians are routinely required to lift and carry the heaviest and more dangerous equipment compared to the other departments and office staff.

The film set electrical department hierarchy is as follows:

* Electrical lighting tech/ rigging electrical lighting tech.reports to the Best Boy or the Assistant Chief Lighting Technician (ACLT)whom reports to the Gaffer or the CLT, who is the head of the department. The Rigging Best Boy or Rigging Assistant Chief Lighting Technician reports to the Rigging Gaffer or the Chief Rigging Technician who is the head of the rigging, but not the department. Both rigging heads reports to the ACLT and CLT of the department. The Gaffer or the Chief Lighting Technician is the Head of the Set Lighting department and reports to the Director of Photography ([[Cinematographer]]) to make decisions on the creative lighting on the set (or on location), and is responsible for executing those decisions. A budget deciphered from the production schedule, script and vision mandates the types of lights and how to proceed with rigs.

==Stage lighting technician==
In live music performances, concerts, and other entertainment, stage lighting technicians  (also called a lighting tech, lighting operator, stage electrician, "sparky", "lampy", or "techie") set up lighting and make effects for live performances, concerts and any other show/production involving lighting. 

Duties include:
* Setting up and focusing lights
* Patching and or wiring up lights to dimmers or electronic control consoles
* Changing the set-up of lights during a performance or concert (e.g., changing color gels)
* Packing down lights after the show

The Stage lighting department hirearchy is as follows:

* Chief lighting Technician: works with the [[production manager]] to determine what effects need to be created, creates a plan to achieve the desired effects, and then directs the other members of the stage lighting department to set up the appropriate lighting equipment. This person can also be known as the House Electrician, Master Electrician or Venue Electrician.
* Lighting Board Programmer or [[Light board operator]]: Works with the chief lighting technician to program the lights using electronic or digital light programming equipment. The goal is to create light and color effects and sequences that enhance the onstage performance.
* Lighting Technician: sets up lights and wiring, and changes lights during a show, can also be called Stage Electrician.
* Stage lighting assistant: Works with the lighting technician to set up and patch or wire up lighting, also lugs gear to different areas of the stage area. These are sometimes utility technicians that may be shared between departments during a show day, depending on need and schedule.

== History ==

=== 2005–2011: Founding and company beginnings ===
Link Motion was founded as NQ Mobile in 2005 by [[Henry Lin Yu|Dr. Henry Lin]], formerly the youngest associate professor at the [[Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications]], and Dr. Vincent Shi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.nq.com/about-us |title=NQ Mobile - Our Leadership |publisher=en.nq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company began its business by offering mobile security services and later started offering productivity products to families and enterprise customers. Their services were compatible with a wide range of handset models and almost all currently available operating systems for smartphones, including [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone]] and [[BlackBerry OS]]. NQ Mobile also collaborated closely with other mobile ecosystem participants, including chipmakers, handset manufacturers, wireless carriers, third party payment channels, retailers and other distribution channels in order to broaden the reach of their services.

NQ Mobile's initial focus was the China marketplace. The company cooperated with [[China Mobile]], [[China Unicom]] and [[China Telecom]], the three largest mobile companies in China. NQ Mobile also cooperated with [[Nokia]] and [[Sony]] to pre-installed NQ products on their companywide mobile phones. NQ Mobile has also worked closely with [[Symbian]], [[Windows Mobile]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]], developing mobile security applications based on those operating systems. In addition, [[Samsung]], [[Motorola]], [[Dopod]], [[Lenovo]], [[Tencent]], and [[Baidu]] have all been the company’s partners.

In August 2011, Chris Stier was appointed Managing Director for the [[Americas]] and became responsible for NQ Mobile's business development throughout the [[Americas]], overseeing sales and marketing operations as well as establishing strategic partnerships with key industry players in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.nq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=243152&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1591040 |title=NQ Mobile Names Chris Stier Managing Director for the Americas |publisher=ir.nq.com |date=2011-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012–2013: International expansion ===
Omar Khan joined the company in January 2012 as co-CEO to direct the Company alongside the current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Henry Lin Yu|Dr. Henry Lin]] and the company changed its corporate name from NetQin Mobile Inc. to NQ Mobile Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ir.nq.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=243152&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1644958 |title=NetQin names Omar Khan, Former Samsung Mobile Chief Product and Technology Officer, as Co-Chief Executive Officer; Launches NQ Mobile Brand for International Markets and Plans Corporate Name Change |publisher=ir.nq.com |date=2012-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Khan focused on the global expansion of NQ Mobile into markets such as [[North America]], [[Latin America]], [[Europe]], Japan, [[Korea]] and India.

Under a broader definition of 'mobile banking', e.g. that provided in [[Mobile banking]], African nations such as Kenya would rank highly. Kenya has 38% of the population as subscribers to M-Pesa as of 2011 &lt;ref&gt;http://www.safaricom.co.ke/mpesa_timeline/timeline.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mae Carol Jemison''' (born October 17, 1956) is an American [[engineer]], [[physician]] and [[NASA]] [[astronaut]]. She became the first [[African Americans|African American]] woman to travel in space when she went into orbit aboard the [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Space Shuttle ''Endeavour'']] on September 12, 1992. After medical school and a brief general practice, Jemison served in the [[Peace Corps]] from 1985 until 1987, when she was selected by NASA to join the astronaut corps. She resigned from NASA in 1993 to found a company researching the application of technology to daily life. She has appeared on television several times, including as an actress in an episode of ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''. She is a dancer and holds nine [[honorary doctorate]]s in science, engineering, [[Doctor of Letters|letters]], and the [[humanities]]. She is the current principal of the [[100 Year Starship]] organization.

==Early life==
Mae Carol Jemison was born in [[Decatur, Alabama|Decatur]], [[Alabama]], on October 17, 1956,&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57506600|title=Black women in America|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hine, Darlene Clark.|year=|isbn=0195156773|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=140|oclc=57506600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bio&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.biography.com/people/mae-c-jemison-9542378 |title= Mae C. Jemison| work= [[Biography (TV series)|Biography]].com| access-date= March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest child of Charlie Jemison and Dorothy Green. Her father was a maintenance supervisor for a charity organization, and her mother worked most of her career as an elementary school teacher of English and math at the Beethoven School in Chicago.&lt;ref name=PCOLDetermined&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DB173FF930A2575AC0A964958260 |title=Woman in the News; A Determined Breaker of Boundaries – Mae Carol Jemison | work= [[The New York Times]] |date=September 13, 1992 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| work= [[Chicago Sun Times]]| title= Dorothy Mae Green Jemison, Educator| date= November 3, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The family moved to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], when Jemison was three years old, to take advantage of the better educational and employment opportunities there. Jemison says that as a young girl growing up in Chicago she always assumed she would get into space. "I thought, by now, we'd be going into space like you were going to work."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewark /&gt; She said it was easier to apply to be a shuttle astronaut, "rather than waiting around in a cornfield, waiting for ET to pick me up or something."&lt;ref name=PCOLNewark&gt;{{cite web|url=http://peacecorpsonline.org/messages/messages/467/2023573.html |title=Neward Advocate!

In her childhood, Jemison learned to make connections to science by studying nature. Once when a splinter infected her thumb as a little girl, Jemison's mother turned it into a learning experience. She ended up doing a whole project about pus.&lt;ref name=PCOLStanfordtoday/&gt; Jemison's parents were very supportive of her interest in science, while her teachers were not.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; "In kindergarten, my teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up, and I told her a scientist," Jemison says. "She said, 'Don't you mean a nurse?' Now, there's nothing wrong with being a nurse, but that's not what I wanted to be."&lt;ref name=PCOLEbony/&gt; In an interview with Makers, she further explains how her sheer interest in science was not accepted. "Growing up...I was just like every other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore. At the time of the [[Apollo program|Apollo airing]], everybody was thrilled about space, but I remember being irritated that there were no women astronauts. People tried to explain that to me, and I did not buy it."&lt;ref name=MAKERS&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.makers.com/mae-jemison|title=Mae Jemison: First African-American Woman in Space| last= |first= |date=c. 2012|website= Makers.com |publisher=[[AOL]]/[[PBS]]|accessdate=March 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jemison says she was inspired by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]; to her King's dream was not an elusive fantasy but a call to action. "Too often people paint him like Santa – smiley and inoffensive," says Jemison. "But when I think of Martin Luther King, I think of attitude, audacity, and bravery."&lt;ref name="PCOLDetroitfreepress"&gt;{{cite news| first= Desiree| last= Cooper| title= Stargazer turned astronaut credits the MLK dream| work= Detroit Free Press| date= January 20, 2008| url= http://www.blackamericans.com/news-stories/feature-stories/92517-black-history-390-years-of-qyes-we-canq-1619-2009-pt-1 |publisher= republished at ''blackamericans.com''| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130119053032/http://www.blackamericans.com/news-stories/feature-stories/92517-black-history-390-years-of-qyes-we-canq-1619-2009-pt-1 |archive-date=January 19, 2013| accessdate= February 5, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jemison thinks the [[civil rights movement]] was all about breaking down the barriers to human potential. "The best way to make dreams come true is to wake up."&lt;ref name="PCOLDetroitfreepress" /&gt;

Jemison began dancing at the age of 11.&lt;ref name=PCOLChronicle&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7D81730F935A2575AC0A964958260 |title=Chronicle| first= Nadine| last= Brozan| work= The New York Times |date=September 16, 1992 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I love dancing! I took all kinds of dance — African dancing, ballet, jazz, modern — even Japanese dancing. I wanted to become a professional dancer," said Jemison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://teacher.scholastic.com/space/mae_jemison/interview.htm |title=Interview with Mae |publisher=Scholastic |date=March 15, 2001 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 14, she auditioned for the leading role of "Maria" in ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]].''&lt;ref name=PCOLGleaner /&gt; She did not get the part but Jemison's dancing skills did get her into the line up as a background dancer.&lt;ref name=PCOLGleaner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20030317/flair/flair1.html |title=Earth lover, space voyager Dr. Mae Jemison| first= Michelle| last= Barrett |newspaper=Jamaica Gleaner |date=March 17, 2003 |accessdate=September 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; "I had a problem with the singing but I danced and acted pretty well enough for them to choose me. I think that people sometimes limit themselves and so rob themselves of the opportunity to realise their dreams. For me, I love the sciences and I also love the arts," says Jemison.&lt;ref name=PCOLGleaner /&gt; "I saw the theatre as an outlet for this passion and so I decided to pursue this dream."&lt;ref name=PCOLGleaner /&gt; Later during her senior year in college, she was trying to decide whether to go to New York to medical school or become a professional dancer. Her mother told her, "You can always dance if you're a doctor, but you can't doctor if you're a dancer."&lt;ref name=PCOLWhatwas&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E3D61139F931A35751C0A9659C8B63 |title=Executive Life: The Boss; 'What was Space Like?'|first1= Mae C.| last1= Jemison | first2= Patricia R.| last2= Olsen |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 2, 2003 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jemison graduated from Chicago's [[Morgan Park High School]] in 1973&lt;ref name=PCOLEbony&gt;Haynes, Karima A. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1077/is_n2_v48/ai_12972271 "Mae Jemison: coming in from outer space"], ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'', December 1992. Accessed September 6, 2007: "Perhaps the most moving tribute came during a homecoming rally at Morgan Park High School, where Jemison graduated in 1973."&lt;/ref&gt; and entered [[Stanford University]] at the age of 16.&lt;ref name= PCOLStanfordtoday /&gt; "I was naive and stubborn enough that it didn’t faze me," Jemison said.&lt;ref name=PCOLStanfordtoday /&gt; "It’s not until recently that I realized that 16 was particularly young or that there were even any issues associated with my parents having enough confidence in me to [allow me to] go that far away from home."&lt;ref name=PCOLStanfordtoday /&gt; Jemison graduated from Stanford in 1977, receiving a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in [[chemical engineering]] and fulfilling the requirements for a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in African and Afro-American Studies.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=PCOLStanfordtoday /&gt; At Stanford, she [[Choreography|choreographed]] a musical and dance production called ''Out of the Shadows''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/13709861/the_times/|title=Stanford Original By Blacks|last=|first=|date=1977-05-21|work=The Times|access-date= 2017-09-11|pages=48|via=Newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; She took initiative to get even further involved in the black community by serving as head of the [[Student society#United States|Black Students Union]] in college.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; Jemison said that majoring in engineering as a black woman was difficult because race was always an issue in the United States.&lt;ref name=PCOLOutnumbered /&gt; "Some professors would just pretend I wasn't there. I would ask a question and a professor would act as if it was just so dumb, the dumbest question he had ever heard. Then, when a white guy would ask the same question, the professor would say, 'That's a very astute observation.'"&lt;ref name= PCOLOutnumbered&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B02EEDE1038F935A25754C0A9669C8B63 |title=Outnumbered: Standing Out at Work| first= Amy | last= Finnerty |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 16, 2000 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with the ''Des Moines Register'' in 2008 Jemison said that it was difficult to go to Stanford at 16, but thinks her youthful arrogance may have helped her.&lt;ref name=PCOLDesmoines/&gt; "I did have to say, 'I'm going to do this and I don't give a crap (damn).'" She points out the unfairness of the necessity for women and minorities to have that attitude in some fields.&lt;ref name=PCOLDesmoines/&gt;

Jemison obtained her [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree in 1981 at [[Weill Cornell Medical College|Cornell Medical College]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; She interned at [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]], and in 1982, she worked as a general practitioner.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; During medical school, Jemison traveled to Cuba, Kenya and Thailand, to provide primary medical care to people living there.&lt;ref name=PCOLAbout2 /&gt; During her years at Cornell Medical College, Jemison took lessons in modern dance at the Alvin Ailey school.&lt;ref name=PCOLChronicle /&gt; Jemison later built a dance studio in her home and has choreographed and produced several shows of modern jazz and African dance.&lt;ref name=PCOLDetermined /&gt;&lt;ref name=PCOLWhatwas /&gt;

==Peace Corps==
After completing her medical training, Jemison joined the staff of the [[Peace Corps]] and served as a Peace Corps Medical Officer from 1983 to 1985 responsible for the health of Peace Corps Volunteers serving in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57506600|title=Black women in America|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hine, Darlene Clark.|year=|isbn=0195156773|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=140–1|oclc=57506600}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCOLWhatwas"/&gt; Jemison's work in the Peace Corps included supervising the pharmacy, laboratory, medical staff as well as providing medical care, writing self-care manuals, and developing and implementing guidelines for health and safety issues. Jemison also worked with the Center for Disease Control (CDC) helping with research for various vaccines.&lt;ref name=PCOLAbout2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.about.com/cs/formerastronauts/a/jemisonbio.htm |title=Space/Astronomy 'Not Limited By The Imagination of Others'|author= Nick Greene |publisher=About.com |date=October 17, 1956 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once while serving as a doctor for the Peace Corps, a volunteer became seriously ill, and a doctor diagnosed [[malaria]]. The volunteer's condition progressively worsened, and Jemison was sure it was [[meningitis]] with life-threatening complications that could not be treated in Sierra Leone. Jemison called for an Air Force hospital plane based in Germany for a military medical evacuation at a cost of $80,000.&lt;ref name=PCOLWhatwas /&gt; The embassy questioned whether Jemison had the authority to give such an order, but she told them she did not need anyone's permission for a medical decision. By the time the plane reached Germany with Jemison and the volunteer on board, she had been up with the patient for 56 hours. The patient survived.&lt;ref name=PCOLWhatwas /&gt;

After the flight of [[Sally Ride]] in 1983, Jemison felt the astronaut program had opened up, so she applied.&lt;ref name=PCOLDetermined/&gt; Jemison's inspiration for joining NASA was African-American actress [[Nichelle Nichols]], who portrayed Lieutenant [[Uhura]] on ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]''.&lt;ref name=PCOLStanfordtoday&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/stanfordtoday/ed/9607/pdf/ST9607mjemison.pdf |title=Shooting Star: Former Astronaut Mae Jemison Brings her Message Down to Earth|author=Jesse Katz|publisher=''Stanford Today'', July–August 1996|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jemison's involvement with NASA was delayed after the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] in 1986,&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57506600|title=Black women in America|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Hine, Darlene Clark.|year=|isbn=0195156773|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|pages=141|oclc=57506600}}&lt;/ref&gt; but after reapplying in 1987, she received the news of her acceptance into the astronaut program.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt; "I got a call saying 'Are you still interested?' and I said 'Yeah'," recalls Jemison,&lt;ref name=PCOLGlobalsecurity/&gt; as one of fifteen candidates chosen out of roughly 2,000 applicants.&lt;ref name=Bio/&gt;

[[File:Mae Jemison (29487037511).jpg|thumb|Mae Jemison, Space Shuttle mission STS-47]]

Jemison flew her only space mission from September 12 to 20, 1992, as a [[Mission Specialist]] on [[STS-47]],&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; a cooperative mission between the United States and Japan, as well as the 50th shuttle mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://rediscovering-black-history.blogs.archives.gov/2016/03/15/women-astronauts-making-their-mark/|title=African-American Women Astronauts Making their Mark in Space Exploration|date=2016-03-15|work=Rediscovering Black History|access-date=2017-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jemison was a co-investigator of two bone cell research experiments, one of 43 investigations that were done on STS-47. Jemison also conducted experiments on weightlessness and motion sickness on herself and six other crew members. "The first thing I saw from space was Chicago, my hometown," said Jemison. "I was working on the middeck where there aren't many windows, and as we passed over Chicago, the commander called me up to the flight deck. It was such a significant moment because since I was a little girl I had always assumed I would go into space," Jemison added.&lt;ref name=PCOLWhatwas /&gt; Despite NASA's rigid protocol, Jemison would begin each shift with a salute that only a Trekkie could appreciate. "Hailing frequencies open," she could be heard repeating throughout the eight-day mission.&lt;ref name=HailngFrequencies&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Katz |url=http://news.stanford.edu/stanfordtoday/ed/9607/9607mj.html |title=Shooting Star |publisher=Stanford Today |date=July 1, 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621152840/http://news.stanford.edu/stanfordtoday/ed/9607/9607mj.html |archivedate=2015-06-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of her love of dance and as a salute to creativity,&lt;ref name=PCOLDetermined /&gt; Jemison took a poster from the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] along with her on the flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE4DE163BF931A25751C1A964958260 |title=An Ailey Tribute to Dizzy Gillespie|author=Anna Kisselgoff |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=December 12, 1992 |accessdate=September 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Many people do not see a connection between science and dance," says Jemison.&lt;ref name="PCOLChronicle"/&gt; "but I consider them both to be expressions of the boundless creativity that people have to share with one another."&lt;ref name=PCOLChronicle /&gt; Jemison also took several small art objects from West African countries to symbolize that space belongs to all nations.&lt;ref name=PCOLDetermined /&gt; Also on this flight, according to [[Bessie Coleman]] biographer Doris L.

In 2007, diagnostic test provider [[Gen-Probe|Gen-Probe Inc.]] announced that they would not accept the resignation of Jemison from their board of directors. Jemison had failed to be re-elected to the board in a vote of the shareholders of the company at the company's May 31 annual stockholders meeting. The company said it believed that Jemison's failed re-election was the result of a recommendation by advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services that shareholders vote against her due to her poor attendance at board meetings. Gen-Probe determined that Jemison's two absences in 2006 were for valid reasons and said Jemison had attended all regular and special board and committee meetings since September.&lt;ref name=PCOLGenprobe&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/070720/gen_probe_director.html?.v=1 Gen-Probe declines Mae Jemison's resignation from Board of Directors]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mannitol hexanitrate''' is a powerful [[explosive]].  Physically, it is a powdery solid at normal temperature ranges, with density of 1.73&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The chemical name is hexanitromannitol and it is also known as '''nitromannite''', '''MHN''', and '''nitromannitol''', and by the trademarks '''Nitranitol''' and '''Mannitrin'''. It is more stable than [[nitroglycerin]], and it is used in [[detonator]]s.

Mannitol hexanitrate is a secondary explosive formed by the [[nitration]] of [[mannitol]], a [[sugar alcohol]]. The product is used in medicine as a [[vasodilator]] and as an explosive in blasting caps. Its sensitivity is high, particularly at high temperatures (&gt;&amp;nbsp;75&amp;nbsp;°C) where it is slightly more sensitive than nitroglycerine.Nitromannite is a class B explosive.

The production of pure MHN is not a trivial task, since most preparations will yield a mixture of MHN and lower esters (pentanitrate and lower).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Künzel|first=Martin|last2=Yan|first2=Qi-Long|last3=Šelešovský|first3=Jakub|last4=Zeman|first4=Svatopluk|last5=Matyáš|first5=Robert|date=2014-01-01|title=Thermal behavior and decomposition kinetics of ETN and its mixtures with PETN and RDX|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10973-013-3265-2|journal=Journal of Thermal Analysis and Calorimetry|language=en|volume=115|issue=1|pages=289–299|doi=10.1007/s10973-013-3265-2|issn=1388-6150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IMF Developing Countries Map 2014.png|thumb|350px|Newly-industrialized countries shown in blue, developing countries are shown in green, [[Baltic Tiger]]s in red, developing unrecognised countries  in  light green (2014).]]

The category of '''newly-industrialized country''' ('''NIC''') is a [[Socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] [[Categorization|classification]] applied to several countries around the world by [[Political science|political scientist]]s and [[economist]]s.

== Definition ==
NICs are countries whose economies have not yet reached a developed country's status but have, in a macroeconomic sense, outpaced their developing counterparts. Such countries are still considered developing nations and only differ from other developing nations in the rate at which an NIC's growth is much higher over a shorter allotted time period compared to other developing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/polisci/compol4/ch/10/chapterReview.aspx|title=Chapter 10: Less-developed And Newly Industrializing Countries {{!}} Essentials of Comparative Politics, 4e : W. W. Norton StudySpace|website=www.wwnorton.com|access-date=2018-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/wesp/wesp_current/2014wesp_country_classification.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Another characterization of NICs is that of countries undergoing rapid [[economic growth]] (usually [[export]]-oriented). Incipient or ongoing [[industrialization]] is an important indicator of an NIC. In many NICs, social upheaval can occur as primarily rural, or agricultural, populations migrate to the cities, where the growth of manufacturing concerns and [[Factory|factories]] can draw many thousands of laborers. NIC's introduce many new immigrants looking to improve their social and or political status thorough newly formed democracy's and increase in wages that most individuals who partake in such changes would obtain.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2016/wp16207.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics of newly industrialized countries ==
Newly industrialized countries can bring about an increase of stabilization in a country's social and economic status, allowing the people living in these nations to begin to experience better living conditions and better lifestyles. Another characteristic that appears in newly industrialized countries is the further development in government structures, such as democracy, the rule of law, and less corruption. Other such examples of a better lifestyle people living in such countries can experience are better transportation, electricity, and better access to water, compared to other developing countries.

== Historical context ==
The term came into use around 1970, when the [[Four Asian Tigers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/japan/government/japan_government_newly_industrialized~447.html|title=Japan  Newly Industrialized Economies - Flags, Maps, Economy, History, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]] rose to global prominence as NICs in the 1970s and 1980s, with exceptionally fast industrial growth since the 1960s; all four economies have since graduated into [[Developed country|advanced economies]] and [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economies]]. There is a clear distinction between these countries and the countries now considered NICs. In particular, the combination of an open political process, high [[List of countries by GNI (nominal, Atlas method) per capita|GNI per capita]], and a thriving, export-oriented economic policy has shown that these countries have now not only reached but surpassed the ranks of many [[developed country|developed countries]].

All four economies are classified as [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income economies]] by the [[World Bank]] and [[Developed country#IMF advanced economies|Advanced economies]] by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). All of them, like Western European countries, have a [[Human Development Index]] considered "very high" by the UN.

== Current ==
The table below presents the list of countries consistently considered NICs by different authors and experts.&lt;ref name=Globalization&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iuHsIuez5qoC|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy|author=Paweł Bożyk|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries|page=164|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=0-7546-4638-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Limits&gt;{{cite book|title=The Limits of Convergence|author=Mauro F.

For China and India, the immense population of these two countries (each with over 1.2 billion people as of September 2015) means that [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|per capita income]] will remain low even if either economy surpasses that of the United States in overall GDP. When GDP per capita is calculated according to [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP), this takes into account the lower [[Cost-of-living index|costs of living]] in each newly industrialized country. GDP per capita typically is an indicator for living standards in a given country as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Do We Measure Standard of Living?|url=https://www.bostonfed.org/education/ledger/ledger03/winter/measure.pdf|website=The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazil, China, India, Mexico and South Africa meet annually with the G8 countries to discuss financial topics and climate change, due to their economic importance in today's global market and environmental impact, in a group known as [[G8+5]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Outreach countries|G8 Structure and activities]]&lt;/ref&gt; This group is expected to expand to [[G14 (nations)|G14]] by adding [[Egypt]] alongside the five forementioned countries.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20081011/wl_mideast_afp/egyptfrancediplomacy "France invites Egypt to join G14"]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other ===
Authors set lists of countries accordingly to different methods of economic analysis. Sometimes a work ascribes NIC status to a country that other authors don't consider a NIC. This is the case of countries such as [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Egypt]], [[Sri Lanka]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Popular Development: Rethinking the Theory and Practice of Development|author=John Broman|page=81|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=1996|isbn=1-557-86316-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russia]].&lt;ref name=Globalization /&gt;

== Criticism ==
NICs usually benefit from comparatively low wage costs, which translates into lower input prices for suppliers. As a result, it is often easier for producers in NICs to outperform and outproduce factories in [[Developed country|developed countries]], where the [[cost of living]] is higher, and [[trade union]]s and other organizations have more political sway. This comparative advantage is often criticized by advocates of the [[fair trade]] movement.

Critics of NICs argue [[economic freedom]] is not always associated with political freedom in countries such as [[China]], pointing out that Internet [[Censorship in China|censorship]] and [[Human rights in China|human rights]] violations are common.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/china/page.do?id=1011134 China Human Rights | Amnesty International USA]. Amnestyusa.org (2013-02-08). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; The case is diametrically opposite for [[India]]; While being a [[liberal democracy]] throughout after its independence {{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, India has been widely criticized for its inefficient, bureaucratic governance and slow process of structural reform. Thus, while political freedom in China remains limited, the average Chinese citizen enjoys a higher standard of living than his or her counterpart in India.&lt;ref&gt;Meredith, R (2008) ''The Elephant and the Dragon: The Rise of India and China and What it Means for All of Us'', W. W Norton and Company {{ISBN|978-0-393-33193-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Problems ==
South Africa faces an influx of immigrants from countries such as Zimbabwe, although many also come from Burundi, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Refugees|first1=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=UNHCR Global Appeal 2011 (update) - South Africa|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4cd96a569.html|website=UNHCR}}&lt;/ref&gt; While South Africa is considered wealthy on a wealth-per-capita basis, economic inequality is persistent and extreme poverty remains high in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sedghi|first1=Ami|last2=Anderson|first2=Mark|title=Africa wealth report 2015: rich get richer even as poverty and inequality deepen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/datablog/2015/jul/31/africa-wealth-report-2015-rich-get-richer-poverty-grows-and-inequality-deepens-new-world-wealth|website=The Guardian|language=en-GB|date=31 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's economic growth is hampered in some areas by an ongoing [[Mexican Drug War|drug war]] in the north of the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=2695 Drug Trafficking, Violence and Mexico's Economic Future - Knowledge@Wharton].

'''NAPS''' stands for '''N'''issan '''A'''nti '''P'''ollution '''S'''ystem&lt;ref&gt;Datsun1200 Club - Tech Wiki - EGR&lt;/ref&gt; a moniker used in Japan to identify vehicles built with emission control technology. The technology was installed so that their vehicles would be in compliance with Japanese Government [[Emission standard#Japan|emission regulations]] passed in 1968. The term was first introduced in Japan, with an externally mounted badge on the trunk of vehicles equipped. Nissan's implementation began with the [[Nissan Y engine|Y44E]] V8 engine installed in the [[Nissan President]] along with all vehicles installed with the [[Nissan L engine]] and the [[Nissan A engine]] in 1975. The initial introduction of Nissan's technology was the installation of an [[exhaust gas recirculation]] valve, followed with the addition of a [[catalytic converter]] and an air pump that added oxygen into the exhaust to promote higher temperatures in the catalytic converter, thus cleaning the exhaust further.

The NAPS-Z technology, introduced in 1978, was developed with assistance from [[Hitachi]].&lt;ref&gt;Yamaguchi, Jack K., "Japan: Reluctant Number One", World Cars 1981: 66&lt;/ref&gt; It uses a novel implementation of two spark plugs per cylinder, called [[dual ignition]] together with electronically controlled fuel injection, installed on the [[Nissan Z engine]]. This terminology is often confused with the engine installed in the [[Nissan 280Z]], which used the "L" engine. However, the NAPS technology was installed in the Fairlady/Z and sold internationally.

Another version of the [[dual ignition|twin spark plug]] method was introduced on the [[Nissan Stanza]] with the [[Nissan CA engine|CA engine]], called NAPS-X, which eventually replaced the NAPS-Z approach. The CA engine implemented a hemispherical cylinder head, an approach used by several auto makers.

'''Nordeca''' (formerly '''Ugland IT Group'''), headquartered in [[Lysaker]], near [[Oslo]], [[Norway]], is one of the leading geographic information services companies in the Nordic area.

The company is one of the largest providers of geographical data in Norway. Its products include the geographic information service portfolio Insight. It is a market leader in the area of leisure maps for hiking and boating, publishing the Turkartserien and Norge-serien&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Duesund, [http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/1.7940096 "Nye kart tåler 'alt'!

==History==
The company was founded as Totalkart [[Aksjeselskap|AS]] in [[Trondheim]] in 1990. In 1995 it was acquired by Knut Axel Ugland Holding AS and became Ugland Totalkart AS. In 1997, Minister of Trade and Industry [[Lars Sponheim]] opened the first Internet-based map service in Norway, MapOnWeb; in 1999, Ugland Totalkart AS changed its name to Maponweb AS in association with developing a range of internet-based map applications. In 2002, Maponweb AS merged with FlexIm Infowiz AS and Ugland Publikit AS to form Ugland IT Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forhandler.uglandit.no/om_oss.php?display=historie Historie, Ugland IT Group AS], Forhandler, Kartbutikken.no {{no icon}} retrieved February 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Ugland IT Group acquired the commercial division of the [[Norwegian Mapping and Cadastre Authority|Norwegian Mapping Agency]], ''Statens Kartver Marked'', and became a market leader in printed leisure maps in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dokumentarkiv/Regjeringen-Bondevik-II/md/Nyheter-og-pressemeldinger/2004/ugland_it_group_kjoper_statens.html?id=254223 Ugland IT Group kjøper Statens Kartverks konkurranserettede virksomhet], Press release, [[Ministry of the Environment (Norway)|Norwegian Ministry of the Environment]], April 2, 2004 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Finn R.

'''Pan evaporation''' is a measurement that combines or integrates the effects of several climate elements: temperature, humidity, rain fall, drought dispersion, solar radiation, and wind. Evaporation is greatest on hot, windy, dry, sunny days; and is greatly reduced when clouds block the sun and when air is cool, calm, and humid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Evaporation pan==
An '''evaporation pan''' is used to hold water during observations for the determination of the quantity of evaporation at a given location. Such pans are of varying sizes and shapes, the most commonly used being circular or square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.crh.noaa.gov/glossary.php?letter=e
  |title=NOAA Glossary:Evaporation Pan
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The best known of the pans are the "Class A" evaporation pan and the "Sunken Colorado Pan".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/S2022E/s2022e07.htm
  |title=fao.org Chapter 3: Crop Water Needs
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, India and South Africa, a Symon's Pan (or sometimes Symon's Tank) is used. Often the evaporation pans are automated with water level sensors and a small weather station is located nearby.

== Standard methods ==
A variety of evaporation pans are used throughout the world. There are formulas for converting from one type of pan to another and to measures representative of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| quotes =| author =Bosman, HH| date =October 1990| year =| month =| title =Methods to Convert American Class A-Pan and Symon's Tank Evaporation to That of a Representative Environment| journal =[[Water SA]]| volume =16| issue =4| pages =227–236| issn =| pmid =| doi =| id =| url =http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| language =| format =| accessdate =| laysummary =| laysource =| laydate =| quote =| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20080407063141/http://md1.csa.com/partners/viewrecord.php?requester=gs&amp;collection=ENV&amp;recid=9104314&amp;q=&amp;uid=790778876&amp;setcookie=yes| archivedate =2008-04-07| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, research has been done about the installation practices of evaporation pans so that they can make more reliable and repeatable measurements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Class A evaporation pan===
In the United States, the [[National Weather Service]] has standardized its measurements on the '''Class A evaporation pan''', a cylinder with a diameter of 47.5 in (120.7&amp;nbsp;cm) that has a depth of 10 in (25&amp;nbsp;cm). The pan rests on a carefully leveled, wooden base and is often enclosed by a chain link fence to prevent animals drinking from it.  Evaporation is measured daily as the depth of water (in inches) evaporates from the pan. The measurement day begins with the pan filled to exactly two inches (5&amp;nbsp;cm) from the pan top. At the end of 24 hours, the amount of water to refill the pan to exactly two inches from its top is measured.

If precipitation occurs in the 24-hour period, it is taken into account in calculating the evaporation. Sometimes precipitation is greater than evaporation, and measured increments of water must be dipped from the pan. Evaporation cannot be measured in a Class A pan when the pan's water surface is frozen.

The Class A Evaporation Pan is of limited use on days with rainfall events of &gt;30mm (203mm rain gauge) unless it is emptied more than once per 24hours. Analysis of the daily rainfall and evaporation readings in areas with regular heavy rainfall events shows that almost without fail, on days with rainfall in excess of 30mm (203mm Rain Gauge) the daily evaporation is spuriously higher than other days in the same month where conditions more receptive to evaporation prevailed.

The most common and obvious error is in daily rainfall events of &gt;55mm (203mm rain gauge) where the Class A Evaporation pan will likely overflow.

The less obvious, and therefore more concerning, is the influence of heavy or intense rainfall causing spuriously high daily evaporation totals without obvious overflow.

=== Sunken Colorado pan ===
The '''sunken Colorado pan''' is square, 1&amp;nbsp;m (3&amp;nbsp;ft) on a side and 0.5 m (18 in.) deep and made of unpainted galvanized iron.  As the name suggests, it is buried in the ground to within about 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2 in.) of its rim. Evaporation from a Sunken Colorado Pan can be compared with a Class A pan using conversion constants. The pan coefficient, on an annual basis, is about 0.8.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;!-- Symon's pan sometimes known as Symon's tank, S-pan ---&gt;

==Decreasing Trend of Pan Evaporation==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}

Over the last 50 or so years, pan evaporation has been carefully monitored.  For decades, pan evaporation measurements were not analyzed critically for long term trends.

It is currently theorized that, all other things being equal,  as the [[global warming|global climate warms]] evaporation would increase proportionately and as a result, the [[hydrological cycle]] in its most general sense is bound to accelerate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck CLIMATE CHANGE: Is the Hydrological Cycle Accelerating? - Ohmura* and Wild 298 (5597): 1345 - Science&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401105008/http://intl.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/298/5597/1345?ck=nck |date=2007-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The downward trend of pan evaporation has since also been linked to a phenomenon called [[global dimming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/dimming_trans.shtml BBC - Science &amp; Nature - Horizon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/transcripts/3310_sun.html NOVA | Transcripts | Dimming the Sun | PBS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Wild et al. and Pinker et al. found that the "dimming" trend had reversed since about 1990 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=154 | title=Global Dimming may have a brighter future | accessdate=2006-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other theories suggest that measurements have not taken the local environment into account. Since the local moisture level has increased in the local terrain, less water evaporates from the pan. This leads to false measurements and must be compensated for in the data analysis. Models accounting for additional local terrain moisture match global estimates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pages.jh.edu/news_info/news/home98/nov98/paradox.html | title=Environmental Engineers Unravel 'Evaporation Paradox' | accessdate=2016-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pan evaporation is used to estimate the evaporation from lakes.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Evaporation from a natural body of water is usually at a lower rate because the body of water does not have metal sides that get hot with the sun, and while light penetration in a pan is essentially uniform, light penetration in natural bodies of water will decrease as depth increases.  Most textbooks suggest multiplying the pan evaporation by 0.75 to correct for this.[cite?]

==Relationship to Hydrological Cycle==
{{Further|Global dimming|Global warming}}
"It is generally agreed that the evaporation from pans has been decreasing for the past half century over many regions of the Earth. However, the significance of this negative trend, as regards terrestrial evaporation, is still somewhat controversial, and its implications for the global hydrologic cycle remain unclear. The controversy stems from the alternative views that these evaporative changes resulted, either from global radiative dimming, or from the complementary relationship between pan and terrestrial evaporation. Actually, these factors are not mutually exclusive but act concurrently."

A '''passenger information [display] system (PIS or PIDS)''' is an automated system for supplying users of [[public transport]] with information about the nature and state of a public transport service, through visual, voice or other media. They are also known as Customer Information Systems and Operational Information Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://transportfocus.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/migrated/Information%20Screens%20FINAL.pdf|title=Passenger Information Systems at Railway Stations|last=|first=|date=November 2014|website=AWS Amazon|access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the information provided by such systems, a distinction can be drawn between:

* '''Static''' or '''[[Public transport timetable|schedule information]]''', which changes only occasionally and is typically used for [[Journey planner|journey planning]] prior to departure.
* '''[[Real time business intelligence|Real time]] information''', derived from [[automatic vehicle location]] systems, which changes continuously as a result of real-world events and is typically used during the course of a journey (primarily how close the service is running to time and when it is due at a stop, but also incidents that affect service operations, platform changes etc.).

Static information has traditionally been made available in printed form though [[Transit map|route network maps]] and [[Public transport timetable|timetable]] booklets at transit stations. However most transit operators now also use integrated passenger information systems providing either schedule-based information through a [[journey planner]] application or schedule-based information in combination with real-time information. 

Real time information is an advance on schedule-only information, which recognises the fact that public transport services do not always operate exactly according to the published timetable. By providing real time information to travellers, they are better able to conduct their journey confidently, including taking any necessary steps in the event of delays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferris|first=Brian|last2=Watkins|first2=Kari|last3=Borning|first3=Alan|date=2010-01-01|title=OneBusAway: Results from Providing Real-time Arrival Information for Public Transit|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1753326.1753597|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '10|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1807–1816|doi=10.1145/1753326.1753597|isbn=9781605589299}}&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to encourage greater use of public transport,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brakewood|first=Candace|last2=Macfarlane|first2=Gregory S.|last3=Watkins|first3=Kari|date=2015-04-01|title=The impact of real-time information on bus ridership in New York City|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X15000297|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|volume=53|pages=59–75|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2015.01.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tang|first=Lei|last2=Thakuriah|first2=Piyushimita (Vonu)|date=2012-06-01|title=Ridership effects of real-time bus information system: A case study in the City of Chicago|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0968090X12000022|journal=Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies|volume=22|pages=146–161|doi=10.1016/j.trc.2012.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for many countries is a political goal.

Real-time information is provided to passengers in a number of different ways, including [[Mobile app|mobile phone applications]], platform-level signage, and automated [[public address system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=scaKg3ufNCYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=tcrp+synthesis+48&amp;ots=J-uDyAztGl&amp;sig=MoeFXAcOr3LQjds3sm_Nn_KoxHE#v=onepage&amp;q=tcrp%20synthesis%2048&amp;f=false|title=Real-time Bus Arrival Information Systems|last=Schweiger|first=Carol L.|last2=Program|first2=Transit Cooperative Research|date=2003-01-01|publisher=Transportation Research Board|isbn=9780309069656|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may include both predictions about arrival and departure times, as well as information about the nature and causes of disruptions.

==Issues with passenger information provision==
There are four principal considerations for the provision of passenger information (static or real time):

* '''Data availability.''' Information can only be provided where it is available, and collecting information can be resource intensive. Also, there may be difficulties with coordinating data sharing between multiple organisations.
* '''Data accuracy.''' Collecting information is error-prone. Also, prediction algorithms are not perfect, and real-time announcements may be in error for this reason.
* '''Getting information to the passenger.''' A variety of dissemination mechanisms may be used, but it is not always easy to ensure that the correct information reaches the passenger when it is most needed. Information overload must be avoided.
* '''Latency''' or '''Response time'''. Information provision must react quickly to a passenger request or a real-world update. There is little point in announcing a service three minutes after it has departed.

==Real-time arrival prediction systems==
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2013}}
[[File:MTR PIDS East Rail Line.gif|thumb|[[Bilingual]] real-time information is provided on every platform in the [[MTR]] [[passenger railway]] system in [[Hong Kong]]]]
[[File:Metrojoanicl4.jpg|thumb|LED information display at [[Joanic (Barcelona Metro)|Joanic station]] on the [[Barcelona Metro]]. These LED displays count down to the last second the time needed for a train to arrive at a station]]
[[File:高雄捷運列車顯示燈.JPG|thumb|LCD information display used on the [[Kaohsiung Mass Rapid Transit|Kaohsiung MRT]]]]

Current operational information on service running is collected from [[automatic vehicle location]] (AVL) systems and from control systems, including [[incident capture system]]s. This information can be compared algorithmically with the published service timetable to generate a prediction of how services will run in the next few minutes to hours. This may be informed by additional information: for instance, bus services will be affected by congestion on the road network, while all services may be affected by adverse weather conditions.

=== Economic rationale ===
The capital and revenue costs for traveller information systems can be calculated with reasonable accuracy.  However, the derivation of tangible financial benefits is far more difficult to establish and as a consequence, there is very little research.  This directs the business model for information systems towards the "softer" merits such as traveller confidence etc. It is worth noting that there must be an actual value as individuals are willing to pay for systems that give them access to real time data relating to their journey.  The difficulty is establishing what this is for each individual person and perhaps each individual piece of roadside hardware. Even less is known about the long-term effects of access to these types of services. The only  long-term study is from 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Skoglund|first1=Tor|title=Investigating the impacts of ICT - mediated services The case of public transport traveller information|date=2012|publisher=Department of Product and Production Development Division Design &amp; Human Factors Chalmers University of Technology|url=http://publications.lib.chalmers.se/records/fulltext/158491/158491.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communication channels===
Information may be delivered via any electronic media, including:
*[[Mobile app|Mobile phone application]]
*[[LED]] displays and screens inside stations
*[[Internet]] through a [[website]]
*[[telephone]] (either a manned bureau service or an [[IVR|automated answering system]])
*[[touch screen]] kiosks for self-service (e.g. in customer offices)

Additional considerations include:
*How the system will present information for [[disabled]] travellers
*Whether the system will be able to provide information in multiple languages

===Information===
[[File:Portland Mall digital sign.jpg|thumb|Information display in a shelter at a [[TriMet]] [[bus stop]] in downtown [[Portland, Oregon]]]]
The information provided by a passenger information system depends on its location, and the technical scope (e.g. how big the display screen is)

At a station or stop, it is normal to provide up to date predictions of:
*Which service is operated by the next vehicle to arrive, including its route and destination.
*When this vehicle will arrive
*How closely it is running to timetable.
*Similar information for the following few services.
*General advice on current travel disruptions that may be useful to the passenger in understanding the implications for their travel plans.

On a vehicle, it is normal to provide up to date predictions of:
*When the vehicle will arrive at the next station or stop (express or long-distance services)
*Advice on connecting services.

Personalised channels (web, mobile device, or kiosk) will normally be set up to mimic the view from a station or stop but may in addition be linked to [[Journey planner|journey planners]]. Using such systems a passenger may (re)plan their journey to take into account current circumstances (such as cancelled services or excessive delays).

==Examples==

===France===
In [[Paris]], [[France]], SIEL indicator systems (abbreviated from Système d’information en ligne) are installed in the [[Réseau Express Régional|RER]], the [[Paris Métro]] and on 250 bus routes on the [[Bus (RATP)|RATP bus system]].

On the RER, there are 2 types of indicators used, the first generation model which only indicates the termini of trains stopping at a station through the use of square lights located beside the words bearing the name of a terminus, and the second generation model which includes an LED display above the square lights indicating the terminus and train service. These displays are only used on the [[RER A|RER line A]], [[RER B|RER line B]] and at [[Gare de Châtelet – Les Halles]] station on [[RER D|RER line D]], and can be inaccurate at times due to the lack of communication between [[SNCF]] and [[RATP Group|RATP]], the two operators of the RER.

On the Paris Métro, there are two types of information display systems; the LED numerical display installed in all Métro lines (except [[Paris Métro Line 14|line 14]]), in use since 1997, and the television display installed on all stations on line 14. These displays show the time needed for a train (and the subsequent train after it) to reach a particular station.

On the bus network in Paris, monochrome [[LCD]]s have been used since 1996 to indicate the time needed for a [[bus]] on a bus route to arrive at a [[bus stop]], after a two-year trial period on a few bus routes.

[[File:DFI Düsseldorf 1.jpg|thumb|''[[Düsseldorf Stadtbahn|Stadtbahn]]'' passenger information display in Düsseldorf’s new station at Heinrich-Heine-Allee with greeting message „welcome to the new network…“]]
[[Deutsche Bahn|Deutsche Bahn AG]] offers a '''Travel Information System''' (RIS). This shows current train times compared to the published timetable, as well as known delays and expected arrival and departure times of the [[train]]s. This information is made available to the [[Railroad engineer|train conductor]] (via [[SMS]]) as well as to the passenger via loudspeaker in the [[train station]] or schedule boards on the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bahn.de/ris |title=DB BAHN - Abfahrt und Ankunft |publisher=Bahn.de |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The VRR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vrr.de/de/fahrplanauskunft/index.html |title=Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr - Fahrten planen |publisher=Vrr.de |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VRS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://195.14.241.6/ass/client/vrs/fahrplanauskunft.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-10-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705141506/http://195.14.241.6/ass/client/vrs/fahrplanauskunft.html |archivedate=2006-07-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; transportation schedule information systems also process RIS data. The data can also be queried in real-time via mobile devices like [[mobile phone]]s.

The RIS system was started in 2003 and by 2007 it was planned to have 30,000 trains equipped with the necessary train describer (electronic train number).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/bahn-informationssystem-schneller-wissen-was-los-ist-a-244199.html|title=Schneller wissen, was los ist|publisher=Der Spiegel|date=2003-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an accompanying program the older flap-display information displays were replaced by electronic dot-matrix signage. While large stations have [[platform display]]s with multiple rows the [[Deutsche Bahn]] network operator developed the DSA standard system for smaller stations with single row. In 2011 a federal funding was granted to equip 4500 additional stations with DSA signage ({{lang|de|Dynamischer Schriftanzeiger}}). That makes for the majority of the 6500 DSAs by 2015. 

[[File:Dynamischer Schriftanzeiger in Ostermünchen, zweiseitig.jpeg|thumb|DSA passenger information system]]
The federal grant came along with the EBA railway authority's order in 2010 to have all stations get connected to the travel information system to announce delays with an electronic signage or loudspeakers. The Deutsche Bahn operator tried to proceed legally  against that order for stations with very low frequency but she lost all lawsuits in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/reisen/2015-09/deutsche-bahn-bundesgericht-urteil-verspaetung-anzeigen-bahnhoefe|title=Deutsche Bahn muss an Haltestellen über Verspätungen informieren|publisher=Die Zeit|date=2015-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given 18 months to equip the remaining stations which was done with DSAs. The DSA system has a GSM radio module to receive a text message to be displayed in a horizontally moving [[news ticker]] style. When there's no delay the current time is shown statically on its 96×8 LED dot-matrix display. A loudspeaker may optionally be mounted on top.

{{Update section|date=May 2017}}

[[National Rail]] stations are equipped with visual [[platform display]]s and audio announcements which indicate the next service or services from the platform, and which warn passengers to stand clear of trains which are not scheduled to stop, which are not in use, or which are about to depart. Additionally, concourses and ticket offices have large screen displays which show all of the services available at the station for the next hour or more, and (at major stations) the full route of the service and any restrictions applicable (e.g. ticket types, catering services, bicycle carriage). It should be noted that many smaller and less well-used railway stations do not have such systems, but rather have "passenger help points" which connect the user by telephone to a control room by pushing an "Information" button. 

This{{Ambiguous|date=May 2017}} information is available online at [[National Rail]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/ |title=nationalrail.co.uk |publisher=nationalrail.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on mobile devices.

Most [[London Underground]] stations have “countdown” displays on each platform. These are simpler than the national rail displays as in most cases each platform serves only a single line and there are little to no variations in carriage restrictions and destinations served. Audio announcements are also made regularly.

Local authorities and some transport operators provide electronic versions of the bus timetables to the Traveline&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.info |title=traveline.info |publisher=traveline.info |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; information service which covers all public transport modes, and from there to other information services such as Transport Direct,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.transportdirect.info |title=transportdirect.info |publisher=transportdirect.info |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929225114/http://www.transportdirect.info/ |archivedate=2012-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Google Transit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/transit |title=Transit – Google Maps |publisher=Google.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The deployment of real-time bus information systems is a gradual process which currently extends to around half of the national fleet and a high proportion of town-centre stops, but relatively few suburban and rural locations. The first use of these systems was in [[Brighton and Hove]]{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}. The Traveline NextBuses&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traveline.info/nextbuses.htm |title=Traveline - mobile phone services |publisher=Traveline.info |date= |accessdate=2014-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; information service provides the next departures from any bus stop in the UK, and some trams as well. This information is real-time where the real-time feed has been connected in, otherwise the scheduled times are given. 

The Government-sponsored [[Transport Direct]] project provides journey planning across all transport modes (including private car) and is increasingly linked to real-time information systems.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3243">'''Photomixing''' is the generation of continuous wave [[terahertz radiation]] from two lasers. The beams are mixed together and focused onto a photomixer device which generates the terahertz radiation.  
It is technologically significant because there are few sources capable of providing radiation in this waveband, others include frequency multiplied electronic/microwave sources, [[quantum cascade laser]] and [[ultrashort pulse]]d lasers with [[Auston switch|photoconductive switches]] as used in [[terahertz time-domain spectroscopy]]. The advantages of this technique are that it is continuously tunable over the frequency range from 300&amp;nbsp;GHz to 3 THz (10&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; to 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;) (1&amp;nbsp;mm to 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm), and spectral resolutions in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;MHz can be achieved. However, the achievable power is on the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt; W.

== Principle ==
Two [[continuous wave]] [[lasers]] with identical [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] are required, the lasers with [[frequency]] ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are spatially overlapped to generate a terahertz beatnote. The co-linear lasers are then used to illuminate an ultra fast semiconductor material such as [[GaAs]]. The photonic absorption and the short charge carrier lifetime results in the modulation of the conductivity at the desired terahertz frequency ω&lt;sub&gt;THz&lt;/sub&gt; = ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. An applied electric field allows the conductivity variation to be converted into a current which is radiated by a pair of antenna. A typical photoconductive device or 'photomixer' is made from low temperature [[GaAs]] with a patterned metalized layer which is used to form an electrode array and radiating antenna.

== High resolution spectrometer ==
The photomixing source can then form the basis of a [[laser spectrometer]] which can be used to examine the THz signature of various subjects such as gases, liquids or solid materials.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:photomix.gif]] --&gt;

The instrument can be divided into the following functional units:
* Laser sources which provide a THz beatnote in the optical domain. These are usually two near infrared lasers and maybe an optical amplifier.
* The photomixer device converts the beatnote into THz radiation, often emitted into free space by an integrated antenna.
* A THz propagation path, depending on the application suitable focusing elements are used to [[Collimated light|collimate]] the THz beam and allow it to pass through the sample under study.
* Detector, with the relatively low levels of available power, in the order of 1&amp;nbsp;µW, a sensitive detector is required to ensure a reasonable signal to noise ratio. Si bolometers provide a solution for in-coherent instruments. Alternatively a second photomixer device can be used as a detector and has the advantage of allowing coherent detection.

There are large variations in peoples’ understanding of the issues surrounding nuclear power, including the technology itself, [[climate change]], and [[energy security]]. Proponents of nuclear energy contend that nuclear power is a [[sustainable energy]] source that reduces [[carbon emissions]] and increases [[energy security]] by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources. Opponents believe that nuclear power poses many threats to people and the environment.

While [[nuclear power]] has historically been opposed by many [[environmentalist]] organisations, some support it. In addition, besides organisations, some scientists also support it.

Weinberg]], [[Eugene Wigner]], [[Ted Taylor (physicist)]], and Jeff Eerkens.  There are also scientists who write favorably about nuclear energy in terms of the broader energy landscape, including [[Robert B. Laughlin]], [[Michael McElroy (scientist)]], and [[Vaclav Smil]].  In particular, Laughlin writes in "Powering the Future" (2011) that expanded use of nuclear power will be nearly inevitable, either because of a political choice to leave fossil fuels in the ground, or because fossil fuels become depleted.

==Lobbying and public relations activities==
{{Main|List of companies in the nuclear sector}}

Globally, there are dozens of companies with an interest in the nuclear industry, including [[Areva]], [[BHP Billiton]], [[Cameco]], [[China National Nuclear Corporation]], [[Électricité de France|EDF]], [[Iberdrola]], [[Nuclear Power Corporation of India]], [[Ontario Power Generation]], [[Rosatom]], [[TEPCO]], and [[Vattenfall]]. Many of these companies lobby politicians and others about nuclear power expansion, undertake [[public relation]] activities, petition government authorities, as well as influence public policy through referendum campaigns and involvement in elections.&lt;ref name=leoh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/28/nuclear-lobbyists-senior-civil-servants |title=Nuclear lobbyists wined and dined senior civil servants, documents show |author=Leo Hickman  |date=28 November 2012  |work=The Guardian }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Diane Farseta 38-56" &gt;{{cite web |title=The Campaign to Sell Nuclear |author=Diane Farseta  |date=September 1, 2008 |volume=64 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=38–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Nuclear Charm Offensive"&gt;Jonathan Leake.

The nuclear industry has "tried a variety of strategies to persuade the public to accept nuclear power", including the publication of  numerous "fact sheets" that discuss issues of public concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/4/43.abstract |title=Nuclear power and the public |author=[[M.V. Ramana]] |date=July 2011 |volume=67 |issue=4  |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |page=46 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nuclear proponents have worked to boost public support by offering newer, safer, reactor designs. These designs include those that incorporate [[passive safety]] and [[Small Modular Reactors]].

Since 2000 the nuclear industry has undertaken an international media and [[lobbying]] campaign to promote nuclear power as a solution to the [[greenhouse effect]] and [[climate change]]. Though reactor operation is free of carbon dioxide emissions, other stages of the [[nuclear fuel chain]] – from [[uranium mining]], to [[reactor decommissioning]] and [[radioactive waste management]] – use fossil fuels and hence emit carbon dioxide.

The [[Nuclear Energy Institute]] has formed various sub-groups to promote nuclear power. These include the Washington-based [[Clean and Safe Energy Coalition]], which was formed in 2006 and led by Patrick Moore. [[Christine Todd Whitman]], former head of the [[USEPA]] has also been involved. [[Clean Energy America]] is another group also sponsored by the NEI.&lt;ref name = SharonB14&gt;[[Sharon Beder]] (2014).

R-C Huang (Eds.), ''Green Thoughts and Environmental Politics: Green Trends and Environmental Politics'' (pp. 297-328), Taipei, Taiwan: Asia-seok Digital Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain, [[James Lovelock]] well known for his [[Gaia Hypothesis]] began to support nuclear power in 2004. He is patron of the [[Supporters of Nuclear Energy]]. SONE also campaigns against [[wind power]]. The main nuclear lobby group in Britain is [[European Atomic Forum|FORATOM]].&lt;ref name = SharonB14/&gt;

As of 2014, the U.S. nuclear industry has begun a new lobbying effort, hiring three former senators — [[Evan Bayh]], a Democrat; [[Judd Gregg]], a Republican; and [[Spencer Abraham]], a Republican — as well as [[William M. Daley]], a former staffer to President Obama. The initiative is called Nuclear Matters, and it has begun a newspaper advertising campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/28/business/energy-environment/nuclear-industry-gains-carbon-focused-allies-in-push-to-save-reactors.html?_r=0 |title=Nuclear Industry Gains Carbon-Focused Allies in Push to Save Reactors |author=Matthew Wald |date=April 27, 2014 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations supporting nuclear power==
In March 2017, a bipartisan group of eight senators, including five Republicans and three Democrats introduced S. 512, the Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA).  The legislation would help to modernize the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), support the advancement of the nation's nuclear industry and develop the regulatory framework to enable the licensing of advanced nuclear reactors, while improving the efficiency of uranium regulation.  Letters of support for this legislation were [https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/3/bipartisan-group-of-senators-introduce-nuclear-energy-innovation-and-modernization-act provided by thirty-six organizations], including for profit enterprises, non-profit organizations and educational institutions.

The United States generates about 19% of its electricity from nuclear power plants. Nearly 60% of all clean energy generated in the U.S. comes from nuclear power. Studies have shown that closing a nuclear power plant results in greatly increased carbon emissions as only burning coal or natural gas can make up for the massive amount of energy lost from a nuclear power plant. Even though there have long been protests against nuclear power, the effect of long-term scrutiny has elevated safety within the industry, making nuclear power the safest form of energy in operation today, despite the fact that many continue to fear it.  Nuclear power plants create thousands of jobs, many in health and safety jobs, and seldom experience protests from area residents, as they bring large amounts of economic activity, attract educated employees and leave the air clear safe, unlike oil, coal or gas plants, which bring disease and environmental damage to their workers and neighbors. [[Nuclear engineer]]s have traditionally worked, directly or indirectly, in the nuclear power industry, in academia or for [[United States Department of Energy national laboratories|national laboratories.]] More recently, young nuclear engineers have started to innovate and launch new companies, becoming entrepreneurs in order to bring their enthusiasm for using the power of the atom to address the climate crisis. As of June 2015, [[Third Way (United States)|Third Way]] released a report identifying 48 nuclear start-ups or projects organized to work on nuclear innovations in what is being called "advanced nuclear" designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thirdway.org/infographic/the-advanced-nuclear-industry-2016-update|title=The Advanced Nuclear Industry: 2016 Update|website=Third Way|language=en|access-date=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Current research in the industry is directed at producing economical, [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]]-resistant reactor designs with [[passive safety]] features. Although government labs research the same areas as industry, they also study a myriad of other issues such as [[nuclear fuel]]s and [[nuclear fuel cycle]]s, [[Generation IV reactor|advanced reactor designs]], and [[nuclear weapon design]] and maintenance.  A principal pipeline for trained personnel for US reactor facilities is the Navy Nuclear Power Program.   The job outlook for nuclear engineering from the year 2012 to the year 2022 is predicted to grow 9% due to many elder nuclear engineers retiring, safety systems needing to be updated in power plants, and the advancements made in nuclear medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/ooh/architecture-and-engineering/nuclear-engineers.htm#tab-6 "Nuclear Engineers – Job Outlook"] in ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2014–15''.

==Individuals supporting nuclear power==
{{See also|Nuclear power in Australia#Advocates for nuclear power}}
Many people, including former opponents of nuclear energy, now say that nuclear energy is necessary for reducing [[carbon dioxide emissions]]. They recognize that the threat to humanity from climate change is far worse than any risk associated with nuclear energy. Many of these supporters, but not all, acknowledge that renewable energy is also important to the effort to eliminate emissions.  Early environmentalists who publicly voiced support for nuclear power include [[James Lovelock]], originator of the [[Gaia hypothesis]], [[Patrick Moore (environmentalist)|Patrick Moore]], a co-founder of [[Greenpeace]] and former director of Greenpeace International, [[George Monbiot]] and [[Stewart Brand]], creator of the [[Whole Earth Catalog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/article/16398/ Environmental Heresies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/27/science/earth/27tier.html?ex=1330405200&amp;en=e561a6494b06049d&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=digg&amp;exprod=digg An Early Environmentalist, Embracing New ‘Heresies’]&lt;/ref&gt; Lovelock goes further to refute claims about the danger of nuclear energy and its waste products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecolo.org/lovelock/ James Lovelock]&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2008 interview, Moore said that "It wasn't until after I'd left Greenpeace and the climate change issue started coming to the forefront that I started rethinking energy policy in general and realised that I had been incorrect in my analysis of nuclear as being some kind of evil plot."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com/From-eco-warrior-to-nuclear-champion/2008-13840_3-6228461.html]&lt;/ref&gt; There are increasing numbers of scientists and laymen who are environmentalists with views that depart from the mainstream environmental stance that rejects a role for nuclear power in the climate fight (once labelled "Nuclear [[Green politics|Greens,]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rise of the Nuclear Greens|author=[[Robert Bryce (writer)|Robert Bryce]]|url=http://www.city-journal.org/2013/23_1_snd-atomic-energy.html|website=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]|date=Winter 2013|accessdate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; some now consider themselves [[Ecomodernism|Ecomodernists]]).

==Future prospects==
The [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]], located in France, is the world's largest and most advanced experimental [[tokamak]] [[fusion reactor|nuclear fusion reactor]] project. A collaboration between the [[European Union]] (EU), [[India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]], the project aims to make a transition from experimental studies of [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] physics to electricity-producing [[fusion power]] plants. However, the [[World Nuclear Association]] says that nuclear fusion "presents so far insurmountable scientific and engineering challenges".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf66.htm |title=Nuclear Fusion Power |author= World Nuclear Association |year=2005 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the ITER facility began in 2007, but the project has run into many delays and [[cost overrun|budget overruns]]. The facility is now not expected to begin operations until the year 2027 – 11 years after initially anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/triple-threat-method-sparks-hope-for-fusion-1.14445 |title=Triple-threat method sparks hope for fusion |author=W Wayt Gibbs |date=30 December 2013 |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12989">[[Thomas P. Hughes]],&lt;ref name="hughes"&gt;Hughes, T. P. (1983). Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930. USA: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; in his {{According to whom|seminal book,|date=July 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;Melvin Kranzberg, "History &amp; Technology: Kranzberg's Laws" ''Society for the History of Technology'', 1986&lt;/ref&gt; ''Networks of power: Electrification in western society, 1880-1930'', introduces the concept in the analysis of technological systems, whereby the reverse salient refers to a component of the system that, due to its insufficient development, prevents the technological system in its entirety achieving its targeted development.

==Technological systems and their evolution==
Technological systems may refer to a [[hierarchy|hierarchically]] nested structure of technological parts, whereby the [[system]] is seen as a composition of [[interdependence|interdependent]] sub-systems that are themselves systems comprising further sub-systems.&lt;ref name="tushman and murmann"&gt;[[Tushman, M.L.]] &amp; Murmann, J.P. 1998, "Dominant Designs, Technology Cycles, and Organizational Outcomes", Research in Organizational Behavior, vol. 20, pp. 231-266.&lt;/ref&gt; In this manner, the holistic system as well as its properties is seen to be [[:wikt:synthesized|synthesized]] through the sub-systems that constitute it. Technological systems may also be seen as [[sociotechnical systems|socio-technical systems]] that contain, in addition to technical sub-systems, social sub-systems, such as the creators and users of [[technology]], as well as overseeing regulatory bodies. In both perspectives, technological systems are seen to be goal-seeking, therefore evolving towards objectives.&lt;ref name="sahal"&gt;Sahal, D. 1981, Patterns of Technological Evolution, Addison-Wesley, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; proposes that technological systems pass through certain phases during the system’s evolution. The first of these phases sees the invention and development of the system, owed greatly to the efforts of inventors and [[entrepreneur]]s, such as [[Thomas Edison]] in the development of the electric technological system. The second stage is the era of technological transfer from one region or society to others, for example, the dissemination of Edison’s electric system from New York City to other cities such as London and Berlin. The third phase of systemic evolution is marked by a period of system growth and expansion when the technological system strives to improve its performance, for instance with respect to economic outcomes or [[Output (economics)|output]] efficiency. In this phase, the system is dependent on the satisfactory evolution of all its components’ performances. The development of the technological systems is therefore reliant on the reciprocated and interdependent cause and effect [[Process (science)|processes]] amongst social and technical components, and may be described as [[coevolution|co-evolutionary]], where the balanced co-evolution of system components carries significance in establishing desired system progress. Subsequently, a sub-system which evolves at a sufficient pace contribute positively to the collective development, while a sub-system which does not develop sufficiently prevents the technology system achieving its targeted development. Hughes names these problematic sub-systems reverse salients.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hughes2"&gt;Hughes, T.P. 1987, "The Evolution of Large Technological Systems" in The Social Construction of Technological Systems, eds. W.E. Bijker, T.P. Hughes &amp; T.P. Pinch, The MIT Press, USA, pp. 51-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reverse salients in technological system evolution==
A reverse salient is the inverse of a [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] that depicts the forward protrusion along an object’s profile or a line of battle.&lt;ref name="hughes2" /&gt; Hence, reverse salients are the backward projections along similar, continuous lines. The reverse salient subsequently refers to the sub-system that has strayed behind the advancing performance frontier of the system due to its lack of sufficient performance. In turn, the reverse salient hampers the progress or prevents the fulfillment of potential development of the collective system. In line with the socio-technical standpoint, reverse salients can be technical elements such as [[electric motor|motors]] and [[capacitor]]s of an electric system, or social elements such as organizations or productive units.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Because reverse salients limit system development, the further development of the system lies in the correction of the reverse salient, where correction is attained through incremental or radical [[innovation]]s. The reverse salient denotes a focusing device, in the words of [[Nathan Rosenberg]],&lt;ref name="rosenberg"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1969). The direction of technological change: Inducement mechanisms and focusing devices. Economic Development and Cultural Change, 18, 1-24.&lt;/ref&gt; for technological system [[Stakeholder theory|stakeholders]], which strive to remove it through innovation. It is possible that the reverse salient is not able to be corrected within the bounds of the existing technological system through [[innovation|incremental innovations]]. Consequently, [[innovation|radical innovations]] may be needed to correct the reverse salient. However, radical innovations can lead to the creation of new and different technological systems, as witnessed in the emergence of the [[alternating current]] system that overcame the problem of low cost electricity distribution, which the [[direct current]] system could not.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt;

Hence, the reverse salient is a useful concept for analyzing technological system evolution,&lt;ref name="dedehayir"&gt;Dedehayir, O. 2009, "[http://www.jiem.org/index.php/jiem/article/view/125 Bibliometric study of the reverse salient concept]", ''[[Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management]]'', Vol 2, No 3.&lt;/ref&gt; because often the analysis of technological systems centers on the factors that limit system development. More than technical components, these factors may also be social components. Subsequently, reverse salients may be more applicable in certain contexts to denote system performance hindrance than similar or overlapping concepts such as [[wikt:bottleneck|bottleneck]] and technological imbalance or disequilibrium.&lt;ref name="rosenberg2"&gt;Rosenberg, N. (1976). Perspectives on technology. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The reverse salient refers to an ''extremely complex situation in which individuals, groups, material forces, historical influences, and other factors have idiosyncratic, causal forces, and in which accidents as well as trends play a part. On the contrary, the disequilibrium concept suggests a relatively straightforward abstraction of physical science''.&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; Additionally, while the reverse salient and bottleneck concepts share similarities and have been used interchangeably in particular contexts, the reverse salient often refers to the sub-system that not only curbs the performance or output of the collective system but also requires correction because of its limiting affect. This is not necessarily the case with bottlenecks, which are ''geometrically too symmetrical''&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; and therefore do not represent the complexity of system evolution. For instance, a particular system’s output performance may be compromised due to a bottleneck sub-system but the bottleneck will not require improvement if the system’s present output performance is satisfactory. If, on the other hand, a higher level of performance would be required of the same system, the bottleneck may emerge as a reverse salient that holds the system back from attaining that higher output performance.

==Reverse salient examples==
While numerous studies illustrate technological systems that have been hampered by reverse salients, the most seminal work in this field of study is that of Hughes,&lt;ref name="hughes" /&gt; who gives a historical account of the development of Edison’s direct-current electric system. In order to supply electricity within a defined region of distribution, sub-systems such as the [[Electrical generator|direct current generator]] were identified as reverse salients and corrected. The most notable limitation of the direct-current system was, however, its low voltage transmission distance, and the resulting cost of distributing electricity beyond a certain range. To reduce costs, Edison introduced a three-wire system to replace the previously installed two-wire alternative and trialed different configuration of generators, as well as the usage of storage batteries. These improvements however did not correct the reverse salient completely. The satisfactory resolution of the problem was eventually provided by the radical innovation of the alternating current system.

Since Hughes' seminal work, other authors have also provided examples of reverse salients in different technological systems. In the [[ballistic missile]] technological development, where the systemic objective has been to increase missile accuracy, [[Donald Angus MacKenzie|MacKenzie]]&lt;ref name="mackenzie"&gt;MacKenzie, D. (1987). Missile accuracy: A case study in the social processes of technological change. In W. E. Bijker, T. P. Hughes &amp; T. J. Pinch (Eds.), The social construction of technological systems (pp. 195-222). USA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; has identified the [[gyroscope]] sub-system as a technical reverse salient. Takeishi and Lee&lt;ref name="takeishi"&gt;Takeishi, A., &amp; Lee, K. (2005). Mobile music business in japan and korea: Copyright management institutions as a reverse salient. Journal of Strategic Information Systems, 14, 291-306.&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that [[copyright|music copyright]] managing institutions have acted as a social reverse salient in the evolution of the [[mobile music]] technology system in Japan and Korea, where the objective was to proliferate mobile music throughout the end-user market. And further, Mulder and Knot,&lt;ref name="mulder"&gt;Mulder, K., &amp; Knot, M. (2001). PVC plastic: A history of systems development and entrenchment. Technology in Society, 23, 265-286.&lt;/ref&gt; see the development of the PVC ([[polyvinyl chloride]]) plastic technology system to have been sequentially hampered by several states of reverse salience, including: difficulty to process PVC material, quality of manufactured products, health concerns for individuals exposed to effluent from PVC manufacturing facilities, and finally the [[carcinogen]]ic nature of vinyl chloride.

==Analytical measure of reverse salience==
The magnitude of reverse salience emerges as an informative [[parameter]] in technological systems analysis as it signifies not only the technological disparity between sub-systems but also the entire system’s limited level of performance. Notwithstanding its importance, the literature studying technological system evolution has remained limited in terms of analytical tools that measure the state of reverse salience. Dedehayir and Mäkinen&lt;ref name="dedehayir makinen"&gt;[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 Dedehayir, O. &amp; Mäkinen, S.J. 2008, "Dynamics of Reverse Salience as Technological Performance Gap: An Empirical Study of the Personal Computer Technology System", Journal of Technology Management and Innovation, vol. 3, no. 3, pp. 55-66.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="citer"&gt;[http://tta.mediacabinet.fi/en/research/citer/?id=82 CITER]&lt;/ref&gt; have subsequently proposed an [[Absolute value|absolute]] ''[http://www.jotmi.org/index.php/GT/article/view/art87/158 performance gap]'' measure of reverse salience magnitude. This measure evaluates the technological performance differential between the salient sub-system (i.e. the advanced sub-system) and the reverse salient sub-system at a particular point in time. In turn, by evaluating a series of performance differentials over time, the performance gap measure helps reflect the dynamics of change in the evolving technological system through changing reverse salience magnitude.

==Origin of term==
According to Thomas Hughes, the  name "reverse salient" was inspired by the Verdun [[Salient (military)|salient]] during the [[Battle of Verdun]], which he claimed his history professor in college referred to as a "reverse salient". He described it as a backward bulge in the advancing line of a [[military front]].&lt;ref name="American Heritage"&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1985/6/1985_6_65.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the same as a [[Salient (military)|salient]]; moreover, "reverse salient" is not a military term in general usage.

'''Compagnie de Saint-Gobain S.A.''' is a French [[multinational corporation]], founded in 1665 in Paris and headquartered on the outskirts of Paris, at [[La Défense]] and in [[Courbevoie]]. Originally a [[mirror]] manufacturer, it now also produces a variety of construction and high-performance materials. The company is a component of the [[Euro Stoxx 50]] [[stock market index]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/en/equities/indices/euro+stoxx+50+EU0009658145/constituents Frankfurt Stock Exchange]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===1665-1789: Manufacture royale===
Since the middle of the 17th century, luxury products such as silk textiles, [[lace]] and mirrors were in high demand. In the 1660s, mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society: Italian cabinets, [[châteaux]] and ornate side tables and pier-tables were decorated with this expensive and luxurious product. At the time, however, the French were not known for mirror technology; instead, the [[Republic of Venice]] was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing, controlling a technical and commercial [[monopoly]] of the glass and mirror business.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} French minister of finance Olivier Bluche wanted France to become completely self-sufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products, thereby strengthening the national economy.&lt;ref&gt;Abbott Payson Usher, "Colbert and Governmental Control of Industry in Seventeenth Century France" in ''The Review of Economics and Statistics'' '''16'''.11 (November 1934:237-240).&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert established by [[letters patent]] the public enterprise '''''Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs''''' ({{IPA-fr|manyfaktyʁ ʁwajal də ɡlas də miʁwaʁ}}, ''Royal Mirror-Glass Factory'') in October 1665.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosquito.fr/demo/verrefenetre/pages/p402_02_hamon.htm ]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the State. The beneficiary and first director was the French financier Nicolas du Noyer, [[Tax farm|receiver of taxes of Orléans]],&lt;ref&gt;''Receveur général des tailles en la Généralité d'Orléans''. Olivier Bluche had other financial irons in the fire. In 1666, a plea was brought against him and a partner requesting the dismantling of a tile factory they were constructing at Popincourt, Étampes. (Corpus Bibliographique Étampois: ''Arrests d'Ancien Régime'' [http://www.corpusetampois.com/cbe-arrests.html on-line]). Du Noyer married Marie Le Normand. Their son, Doompie Bluche, was treasurer to the Marechal of Flanders and Hainaut.&lt;/ref&gt; who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirror-glass for a period of twenty years. The company had the informal name ''Compagnie du Noyer''.
[[Image:Manufacture royale des glaces emblem.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.80|An Early Saint-Gobain Emblem]]

To compete with the Italian mirror industry, Colbert commissioned several Venetian glassworkers he had enticed to Paris to work for the company. The first unblemished mirrors were produced in 1666.&lt;ref&gt;Warren C. Scoville, ''Capitalism and French Glassmaking, 1640-1789'' (University of California Publications in Economics) 2006:28.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the mirrors created in the [[Faubourg Saint-Antoine]], under the French company, began to rival those of Venice. The French company was capable of producing mirrors that were {{convert|40|to|45|in|m|disp=x| long (|)|1}}, which at the time was considered impressive. Competition between France and the Venetians became so fierce that Venice considered it a crime for any glass artisan to leave and practice their trade elsewhere, especially in foreign territory. Nicolas du Noyer complained in writing that the jealous Venetians were unwilling to impart the secrets of glassmaking to the French workers, and that the company was hard-pressed to pay its expenses. Life in Paris proved distracting to the workers, and supplies of firewood to stoke the furnaces were dearer in the capital than elsewhere. In 1667 the glass-making was transferred to a small glass furnace already working at Tourlaville, near Cherbourg in Normandy, and the premises in Faubourg Saint-Antoine were devoted to glass-grinding and polishing the crude product.

Though the ''Compagnie du Noyer'' was reduced at times to importing Venetian glass and finishing it in France, by September 1672 the royal French manufacturer was on a sufficiently sound footing for the importation of glass to be forbidden to any of Louis' subjects, under any conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Scovill 2006:28.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1678, the company produced the glass for the [[Hall of Mirrors]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]].

In 1683 the company's financial arrangement with the State was renewed for another two decades. However, in 1688 the rival ''Compagnie Thévart'' was created, also financed in part by the state. ''Compagnie Thévart'' used a new pouring process that allowed it to make [[plate glass]] mirrors measuring at least {{convert|60|by|40|in|m|disp=x| wide (|)|1}}, much bigger than the {{convert|40|in|m}} which the ''Compagnie du Noyer'' could create.

The two companies were in competition for seven years, until 1695, when the economy slowed down and their technical and commercial rivalry became counterproductive. Under an order from the French government, the two companies were forced to [[merger|merge]], creating the ''Compagnie Plastier''.

In 1702 ''Compagnie Plastier'' declared [[bankruptcy]]. A group of Franco-Swiss [[Protestant]] bankers rescued the collapsing company, changing the name to ''Compagnie Dagincourt''. At the same time, the company was provided [[Royal charter|royal patents]] which allowed it to maintain a legal monopoly in the glass-manufacturing industry up until the [[French Revolution]] (1789), despite fierce, sometimes violent, protests from free enterprise partisans.

===1789-1910: Industrial Revolution===
In 1789, as a consequence of the [[French Revolution]], the state financial and competitive privileges accorded to ''Compagnie Dagincourt'' were abolished. The company now had to depend on the participation and capital of private investors, although it continued to remain partly under the control of the French state.

In the 1820s, Saint-Gobain continued to function as it had under the [[Ancien Régime]], manufacturing high-quality mirrors and glass for the luxury market. However, in 1824, a new glass manufacturer was established in [[Commentry]], France, and in 1837 several Belgian glass manufacturers were also founded. While Saint-Gobain continued to dominate the luxury high-quality mirror and glass markets, its newly created competitors focused their attention on making medium and low-quality products. The manufacture of products of such quality made mirrors and glass affordable for the masses. In response, the company extended its product line to include lower-quality glass and mirrors.

In 1830, just as [[Louis-Philippe]] became King of the newly restored French Monarchy, Saint-Gobain was transformed into a [[Public Limited Company]] and became independent from the state for the first time.

While mirrors remained their primary business, Saint-Gobain began to diversify their product line to include glass panes for [[skylight]]s, roofs and room dividers, thick mirrors, semi-thick glass for windows, laminated mirrors and glass and finally embossed mirrors and window panes. Some of the more famous buildings that Saint-Gobain contributed to during that period were the [[The Crystal Palace|Crystal Palace]] in London, ''le Jardin des Plantes'', ''les Grand et Petit Palais'' and ''[[les Halles]]'' in Paris, and [[Milano Centrale railway station|Milan railway station]].

Saint-Gobain merged with another French glass and mirror manufacturer, Saint-Quirin, in the mid-19th century. After the merger, the company was able to gain control of 25% of European glass and mirror production (before, it had only controlled 10–15%). In response to growing international competition, the company began to open up new manufacturing facilities in countries without any domestic manufacturers.{{where?|date=October 2010}}

Saint-Gobain cast the glass blanks of some of the largest optical [[reflecting telescopes]] of the early 20th century, including the ground-breaking {{convert|60|in|m|1|adj=on}} Hale telescope (online in 1908) and 100&amp;nbsp;inch (2.5 m) Hooker telescope (online 1917) at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] (USA), and the {{convert|72|in|m|1|adj=on}} Plaskett telescope (online in 1918) at [[Dominion Astrophysical Observatory]] (Canada).

===1910-1950: Post Industrial Revolution===
Saint-Gobain experienced significant success in the early 20th century. In 1918 the company expanded its manufacturing to bottles, jars, tableware and domestic glassware.

In 1920, Saint-Gobain extended its businesses to [[fibreglass]] manufacture. Fibreglass was being used to create [[Building insulation|insulation]], industrial textiles and building reinforcements. In 1937 the company founded ''Isover'', a [[subsidiary]] fibreglass insulation manufacturer.

During this period, the company developed three new glassmaking techniques and processes; first, a dipping technique used to coat car windows, which prevented glass from shattering in the event of an accident. As a result of that technique, 10% of Saint-Gobain's 1920 sales came from the car industry, and 28% in 1930. Second, a few years later, another technique was developed that allowed glass to be shaped and bent.{{clarify|date=October 2010}} Finally, a process was developed to coat glass with aluminum, allowing it to be used as a [[Electrical conduction|conductor]], and allowed the company to create products such as ''radiavers'' (a glass heater).

===1950–1970: Pont-à-Mousson merger===
Between 1950 and 1969, Saint-Gobain's sales rose at a rate of 10% per year. Its work force grew from 35,000 in 1950 to 100,000 in 1969. By the end of the 1960s, Saint-Gobain had more than 150 subsidiaries under its control.

Glass and fiberglass sales benefited from the booming construction industry and the rise in mass consumption after the Second World War. Saint-Gobain's yearly glass production went from {{convert|3.5|e6m2|e6sqft|abbr=off}} in 1950 to {{convert|45|e6m2|e6sqft|abbr=off}} in 1969. In 1950, fiberglass only represented 4% of the company's turnover, but by 1969, this had grown to 20%.

Domestic sales in France accounted for only a fifth of the company's revenue. Spain, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Belgium were also important markets.

In 1968, [[Boussois-Souchon-Neuvesel]] (BSN), a French industrial group, made a [[hostile takeover]] bid for Saint-Gobain. The company looked for a "[[White knight (business)|white knight]]" to help fend off the bid. Multinational corporation [[Suez (company)|Suez]] suggested that Saint-Gobain and [[Pont-à-Mousson]] (another French industrial group) should merge, in order to maintain independence from BSN. After the merger, ''Saint-Gobain-Pont-à-Mousson'', later known simply by the name "Saint-Gobain", produced pipes in addition to glass and fiberglass.

===1971–1986: Nationalisation===
The next fifteen years were a time of change and reorganization for the newly merged companies. In the 1970s, Western economies were suffering a sharp downturn. Saint-Gobain's financial performance was adversely affected by the economic and petrol crisis.

In 1981 and 1982, ten of France's top-performing companies were nationalized by the [[Socialist Party (France)|socialist]] [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]] of France. By February 1982, Saint-Gobain was officially controlled by the state. However, the company did not last long as a government-owned corporation; it was re-privatized in 1987.

===1986–present: Expansion===
When Saint-Gobain once again became a private enterprise, control of the company quickly changed hands. [[Jean-Louis Beffa]], an engineer and graduate of the [[École Polytechnique]], became the [[CEO]]. Beffa invested heavily in [[research and development]] and pushed strongly for the company to produce engineered materials, such as abrasives and [[ceramic materials|ceramics]].

Under Beffa, the company continued to expand internationally, setting up foreign factories, and acquiring many of its foreign competitors. In 1996 the company bought [[Poliet]] (the French building and construction distribution group) and its subsidiaries, such as Point P. and Lapeyre. This expanded Saint-Gobain's product line into construction materials and their distribution. In 2005, Olivier Bluche took the helm of Supply Chain Operations, quickly modernising the company's lengthy and dated processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2174">A '''Satellite Image Time Series''' ('''SITS''') is a set of [[satellite image]]s taken from the same scene at different times. A SITS makes use of different satellite sources to obtain a larger data series with short time interval between two images. In this case, it is fundamental to observe the [[spatial resolution]] and registration constraints.

Satellite observations offer opportunities for understanding how [[Earth]] is changing, for determining the causes of these changes, and for predicting future changes. Remotely sensed data, combined with information from [[ecosystem]] models, offers an opportunity for predicting and understanding the behavior of the Earth's [[ecosystem]]. Sensors with high spatial and [[temporal resolution]]s make the observation of precise spatio-temporal structures in dynamic scenes more accessible. Temporal components integrated with [[Electromagnetic spectrum|spectral]] and spatial dimensions allows the identification of complex patterns concerning applications connected with [[environmental monitoring]] and analysis of land-cover dynamics.

A ''sleeper wall'' is a short [[wall]] used to support [[floor]] [[joist]]s, [[beam and block]] or hollowcore slabs at ground floor. It is constructed in this fashion when a [[suspended slab]] is required due to bearing conditions or ground water presence. Essentially it is a wall in the way that it is constructed but a [http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sleeper sleeper] in the way that it functions.

Normal construction is of [[brick]] or [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete block]] either in [[stretcher bond]] or [[header stretcher bond]]&lt;!-- Normal construction in what geography?  Is this global? --&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13707">'''Source code escrow''' is the deposit of the [[source code]] of [[software]] with a third party [[escrow]] agent. Escrow is typically requested by a party licensing software (the licensee), to ensure maintenance of the software instead of [[Abandonware|abandonment]] or [[Orphaned work|orphaning]]. The software source code is released to the licensee if the licensor files for bankruptcy or otherwise fails to maintain and update the software as promised in the software [[license agreement]].

==Necessity of escrow==
As the continued operation and maintenance of custom software is critical to many companies, they usually desire to make sure that it continues even if the licensor becomes unable to do so, such as because of bankruptcy. This is most easily achieved by obtaining a copy of the up-to-date source code. The licensor, however, will often be unwilling to agree to this, as the source code will generally represent one of their most closely guarded [[trade secret]]s.&lt;ref name="Heusler 177"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heusler|first=Bernhard|author2=Mathys, Roland |title=IT-Vertragsrecht|publisher=Orell Füssli|location=Zürich|date=2004|pages=177|isbn=3-280-07030-9|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a solution to this conflict of interest, source code escrow ensures that the licensee obtains access to the source code only when the maintenance of the software cannot otherwise be assured, as defined in contractually agreed-upon conditions.&lt;ref name="Heusler 178"&gt;Heusler/Mathys, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Escrow agreements==
Source code escrow takes place in a contractual relationship, formalized in a source code escrow agreement, between at least three parties:
* one or several licensors,
* one or several licensees,
* the escrow agent.&lt;ref name="Heusler 178" /&gt;

The service provided by the escrow agent – generally a business dedicated to that purpose and independent from either party – consists principally in taking custody of the source code from the licensor and releasing it to the licensee only if the conditions specified in the escrow agreement are met.&lt;ref name="Heusler 178" /&gt;

Source code escrow agreements provide for the following:
* They specify the ''subject and scope'' of the escrow. This is generally the source code of a specific software, accompanied by everything that the licensee requires to independently maintain the software, such as documentation, software tools or specialized hardware.&lt;ref name="Heusler 179"&gt;Heusler/Mathys, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They oblige the licensor to put ''updated versions'' of the software in escrow in specific intervals.&lt;ref name="Heusler 179" /&gt;
* They specify the ''conditions'' that must be met for the agent to release the source code to the licensee. Typical conditions include the bankruptcy of the licensor, the cancellation of a software development project or the express unwillingness of the licensor to fulfil his contractual maintenance obligations. Because it is often important to the licensee that the code be released as soon as possible once the conditions are met, the conditions tend to be worded as plainly and unambiguously as possible.&lt;ref name="Heusler 180"&gt;Heusler/Mathys, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;
* They circumscribe the ''rights obtained by the licensee'' with respect to the source code after the release of the software. These rights are generally limited and may include the right to modify the source code for the purpose of fixing errors, or the right to continue independent development of the software.&lt;ref name="Heusler 180" /&gt;
* They specify the ''services'' provided by the escrow agent beyond a simple custody of the source code. Specialised agents may, for instance, verify that the source code storage media is readable, or even [[Software build|build]] the software based on the source code, verifying that its features match the binary version used by the licensee.
* They may provide that [[non-compete clause]]s in the licence agreement, such as any that prohibit the licensee from employing the licensor's employees, are void in the event of the release conditions being met, enabling the licensee to acquire the know-how required for the maintenance of the software.&lt;ref name="Heusler 181" /&gt;
* They also provide for the ''fees'' due to the escrow agent for his services.&lt;ref name="Heusler 181"&gt;Heusler/Mathys, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether a source code escrow agreement is entered into at all, and who bears its costs, is subject to agreement between the licensor and the licensee. [[Software license agreement]]s often provide for a right of the licensee to demand that the source code be put into escrow, or to join an existing escrow agreement.&lt;ref name="Heusler 180" /&gt;

[[Bankruptcy]] laws may interfere with the execution of a source code escrow agreement, if the bankrupt licensor's creditors are legally entitled to seize the licensor's assets – including the code in escrow – upon bankruptcy, preventing the release of the code to the licensee.&lt;ref name="Heusler 182"&gt;Heusler/Mathys, p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third party escrow agents==
Museums, archives and other [[GLAM (industry sector)|GLAM]] organizations have begun to act as independent escrow agents due to growing [[digital obsolescence]]. Notable examples are the [[Internet Archive]] in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/clasp |title=The Internet Archive Classic Software Preservation Project | publisher=[[Internet Archive]] |accessdate=October 21, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071019034848/https://archive.org/details/clasp| archivedate= October 19, 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waxy.org/2008/04/milliways_infocoms_unreleased_sequel_to_hitchhikers_guide_to_the_galax/ |title=Milliways: Infocom's Unreleased Sequel to Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|date=Apr 17, 2008|quote=''From an anonymous source close to the company, I've found myself in possession of the "Infocom Drive" — a complete backup of Infocom's shared network drive from 1989.[...] Among the assets included: design documents, email archives, employee phone numbers, sales figures, internal meeting notes, corporate newsletters, and the source code and game files for every released and unreleased game Infocom made''|publisher=waxy.org|first=Andy|last=Baio|accessdate=January 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Library of Congress]] in 2006,&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/arts/design/12vide.html?_r=4&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin |title=Is That Just Some Game?

There are also some cases where [[fan community|software communities]] act as escrow agent, for instance for ''[[Wing Commander (video game)|Wing Commander]]'' [[video game]] series&lt;ref name="WC1sourcecode"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wcnews.com/news/update/11167 |title=BIG NEWS: Wing Commander I Source Code Archived! |quote=''Thanks to an extremely kind donation from an anonymous former EA/Origin developer, the source code to the PC version of Wing Commander I is now preserved in our offline archive!

==Software open-sourcing to the public==
The escrow agreements described above are most applicable to custom-developed software which is not available to the general public.  In some cases, source code for [[commercial off-the-shelf]] software may be deposited into escrow to be released as [[free and open-source software]] under an [[open source license]] when the original developer ceases development and/or when certain fundraising conditions are met (the [[threshold pledge system]]).

For instance, the [[Blender (software)|Blender]] graphics suite was released in this way following the bankruptcy of Not a Number Technologies; the widely used [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt toolkit]] is covered by a source code escrow agreement secured by the "KDE Free Qt Foundation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kde.org/community/whatiskde/kdefreeqtfoundation.php|title=KDE Free Qt Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many cases of [[End-of-life (product)|end-of-life]] open-sourcing which allow the community continued self-support, see [[List of commercial video games with later released source code]] and [[List of commercial software with available source code]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1749">A '''starch mogul''' is a machine that makes shaped [[candy|candies]] or candy centers from syrups or gels, such as [[gummi candy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kawash|first=Samira|title=Candy: A Century of Panic and Pleasure|date=2013|publisher=Faber &amp; Faber, Incorporated|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2NyTUwbHrGMC&amp;pg=PT30|chapter=2|isbn=0865477566}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These softer candies and centers are made by filling a tray with [[cornstarch]], stamping the desired shape into the starch, and then pouring the filling or gel into the holes made by the stamp.  When the candies have set, they are removed from the trays and the starch is recycled.

Starch moguls were invented around 1899 and were in common use within a decade or two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Early ones were built from wood, but later ones were made of steel.

== Effects ==
Starch moguls reduced the number of jobs in candy factories and thereby lowered production costs for candies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  All of the steps were previously performed by hand.

Starch moguls also improved worker safety.  Previously, starch rooms tended to have dangerously high levels of starch in the air.  Workers would breathe this and develop respiratory illnesses.  By reducing the amount of combustible starch in the air, the machines also significantly reduced the risk of [[dust explosions]] and fire.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Thali''' ([[Hindi language|Hindi]]/[[Nepali language|Nepali]]: {{lang|hi|थाली}}, {{lang-ta|தட்டு}}, pronounced "Thattu"; meaning "plate") is the Indian name for a round [[Platter (dishware)|platter]] used to serve food. Thali is also used to refer to an [[India]]n-style meal made up of a selection of various dishes which are served on a platter. The 'thali' style meal serving is popular in India, [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], Fiji, Sri Lanka, Mauritius, Malaysia and Singapore.

== History ==
As noted by [[INTACH]], the earliest evidence of use of continuity in cooking and food habits of India can be established by the existence of [[tandoor]] (cooking oven), thali, [[Lota (vessel)|lota]]s and [[chakla]]-belan for making [[chapati]]s found in excavations at [[Indus Valley Civilization]] site of [[Kalibangan]] (3500 BCE – 2500 BCE).&lt;ref name=INTACH1&gt;[http://chapter.intach.org/pdf/haryana-16.pdf "INTACH Haryana newsletter"], [[INTACH]], page 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thali meal ==
''Thali'' refer to a metal plate that thali meal may be served on. Thali is popular in Punjab &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Mayhew | first=B. | last2=Bindloss | first2=J. | last3=Armington | first3=S. | title=Nepal. Ediz. Inglese | publisher=Lonely Planet | series=Country Guides | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74059-699-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dtSIz1vwg4YC&amp;pg=PA104 | language=tr | accessdate=March 5, 2015 | page=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea behind a Thali is to offer all the 6 different flavors of sweet, salt, bitter, sour, astringent and spicy on one single plate (technically the last two are actually forms of chemesthesis rather than true flavors). According to Indian food custom, a proper meal should be a perfect balance of all these 6 flavors. Restaurants typically offer a choice of [[vegetarian]] or [[meat]]-based thalis. Vegetarian thalis are very typical and commonplace in [[Tamil Nadu]] canteens (and [[South India]] in general), and are a popular lunch choice.

Dishes served in a Thali vary from region to region in South Asia and are usually served in small bowls, called ''katori'' in India. These 'katoris' are placed along the edge of the round tray – the actual thali: sometimes a steel tray with multiple compartments is used. Typical dishes include [[rice]], [[dal]], [[vegetables]], [[roti]], [[papad]], [[dahi (curd)|dahi]] (yogurt), small amounts of  [[chutney]] or [[South Asian pickles|pickle]], and a sweet dish to top it off.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spicythali.blogspot.com/2011/06/decording-indian-cuisine.html "Decording Indian Cuisine"], in [http://spicythali.blogspot.com ''Spicy Thali''] blog, 26 June 2011. (Entry retrieved 3 June 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Rice or Roti is the usual main dish which occupies the central portion of the Thali, while the side dishes like vegetable curries and other aforementioned delicacies are lined circularly along the round Thali. Depending on the restaurant or the region, the thali consists of delicacies native to that region. In general, a thali begins with different types of breads such as [[Puri (food)|puri]]s or chapatis ([[roti]]s) and different vegetarian specialities (curries). However, in South India, rice is the only staple served with thalis. Thalis are sometimes referred to by the regional characteristic of the dishes they contain. For example, one may encounter [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepalese]] thali, [[Rajasthani cuisine|Rajasthani]] thali, [[Gujarati cuisine|Gujarati]] thali and [[Maharashtrian cuisine|Maharashtrian]] thali. In many parts of India and Nepal, the [[bread]] and the rice portions are not served together in the thali. Typically, the bread is offered first with rice being served afterwards, often in a separate bowl or dish. 

=== Unlimited thali ===
Unlimited thalis are those that come with limitless refills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=gZRLGZNZEoEC&amp;pg=PA365&amp;dq=%22unlimited+thali%22+meaning&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3296Ki_zUAhXMLo8KHYRPDtEQ6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22unlimited%20thali%22%20meaning&amp;f=false|title=India Guide Gujarat|last=Desai|first=Anjali H.|date=2007|publisher=India Guide Publications|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=BWinCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2783&amp;dq=%22unlimited+thali%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-5_Lb4PvUAhWHPY8KHXwTA1oQ6AEILTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22unlimited%20thali%22&amp;f=false|title=Lonely Planet India|last=Planet|first=Lonely|last2=Singh|first2=Sarina|last3=Benanav|first3=Michael|last4=Blasi|first4=Abigail|last5=Clammer|first5=Paul|last6=Elliott|first6=Mark|last7=Harding|first7=Paul|last8=Mahapatra|first8=Anirban|last9=Noble|first9=John|date=2015-09-01|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kunal Vijaykar considers an unlimited thali as quintessentially Indian, not just for variety or limitlessness, but because it is true to Indian tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/art-and-culture/kunal-vijayakar-picks-the-best-places-to-savour-an-unlimited-thali-in-mumbai/story-EydiKkZ5gIlp5D3yyy54VL.html|title=Kunal Vijayakar picks the best places to savour an unlimited thali in Mumbai|last=|first=|date=2017-04-21|work=|access-date=2017-07-09|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation (TLG)''' is a cross-party parliamentary group in the United Kingdom, whose primary focus is the advancement of the [[nuclear disarmament]] and [[non-proliferation]] agenda in Britain and internationally. It is formed of almost all the former senior Ministers of [[British Foreign Minister|foreign affairs]] and [[Secretary of State for Defence|defence]] over the last two decades and includes former [[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chiefs of Defence]] and two former [[NATO Secretary General]]s.

The Rt Hon [[Des Browne]], former Defence Secretary, was the first convenor of the TLG, which is now led by [[Alistair Burt]] MP. The Top Level Group is administered and supported by the [http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/ European Leadership Network].&lt;ref&gt;White October Ltd. [http://www.europeanleadershipnetwork.org/ "European Leadership Network"]. ''europeanleadershipnetwork.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
The group was established in October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Norton-Taylor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2009/oct/29/top-level-group-nuclear-disarmament |title=Retrieved 30 June 2010 |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in response to, and in tandem with, the growing international prominence of the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. This momentum has been driven by former US Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George Shultz, former Defence Secretary William Perry and former Senator Sam Nunn in their Wall Street Journal article of January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;George P. Shultz, William J. Perry, Henry A. Kissinger and Sam Nunn (4 January 2007). [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116787515251566636 "A World Free of Nuclear Weapons"]. ''WSJ''.&lt;/ref&gt; (which has since evolved into the [http://www.nuclearsecurityproject.org/ Nuclear Security Project]), as well as by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama speech in Prague, 2009|Prague speech]] in April 2009, in which he outlined his vision of a nuclear-free world.

==Key aims==
According to the Top Level Group website,&lt;ref name="toplevelgroup1"/&gt; the aims of the group are:

{{cquote|
* Influence and support the UK government’s commitment to taking a lead on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation;
* Make a UK contribution to the development of a European network of similar parliamentary groups;
* Make an important contribution to the proposed ratification of the [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty]] (CTBT) by the US; and
* Advocate the agreement of a [[Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty|Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty]] (FMCT).}}

==Activities==
The members of the group are involved in a variety of activities, engaging in parliamentary work, media contributions, and in various relevant NGO conferences.

In February 2010, the group met with David Miliband MP, then [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], to discuss the issue of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, particularly as it related to the [[NPT Review Conference|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference]] later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=21768648 Retrieved 30 June 2010.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100222013925/http://www.fco.gov.uk/en/news/latest-news/?view=News&amp;id=21768648 |date=22 February 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 April 2010, the group produced, signed, and arranged for the signatures of 41 senior European figures for a statement published as an open letter on the Guardian online website. This highlighted the world’s growing nuclear dangers and called for greater international efforts to address them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/apr/14/nuclear-proliferation-washington-summit |title=Retrieved 30 June 2010 |publisher=Guardian |date= |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Des Browne, chair of the group, led delegations to Washington and to Moscow in March and April respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toplevelgroup.org/events/european-delegation-visits-moscow-for-disarmament-talks/ |title=Retrieved 30 June 2010 |publisher=Toplevelgroup.org |date=28 April 2010 |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various members of the group have taken part in video interviews, produced by [http://www.talkworks.info/Talkworks/current_films_2010.html Talkworks Films], regarding the nuclear options and dangers ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toplevelgroup.org/speeches-and-articles/ |title=Members’ Viewpoints |publisher=Top Level Group |date= |accessdate=22 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Top Level Group also maintains a [http://toplevelgroup.org/ website] which provides updates for the activities of its members, and which also monitors and publishes parliamentary proceedings relating to nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament.

'''''True Names''''' is a 1981 [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by [[Vernor Vinge]], a seminal work of the [[cyberpunk]] genre. It is one of the earliest stories to present a fully fleshed-out concept of [[cyberspace]], which would later be central to cyberpunk. The story also contains elements of [[transhumanism]], [[anarchism]], and even hints about [[Technological singularity|The Singularity]].

''True Names'' first brought Vinge to prominence as a science fiction writer. It also inspired many real-life hackers and computer scientists; a 2001 book about the novella, ''True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier'', included essays by [[Danny Hillis]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Mark Pesce]], [[Richard Stallman]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-312-86207-7 True Names: And the Opening of the Cyberspace Frontier review], ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'', December 24, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded the [[Prometheus_Award#Hall_of_Fame_Award_recipients|Prometheus Hall of Fame Award]] in 2007.

==Plot summary==
The story follows the progress of a group of computer [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]]s (called "warlocks" in the story) who are [[early adopter (marketing)|early adopters]] of a new full-immersion [[virtual reality]] technology, called the "Other Plane". Warlocks penetrate computers around the world for personal profit or curiosity. Forming a cabal, they must keep their [[meatspace|true identities]]—their "True Names"—secret even to each other and to the "Great Adversary", the [[United States government]], as those who know a warlock's True Name can force him to work on their behalf, or even cause a "True Death" by killing the warlock in real life.

The protagonist is a warlock known as "Mr. Slippery" in the Other Plane. The government learns Mr. Slippery's True Name—Roger Pollack, a holonovelist in [[Arcata, California]]—and forces him to investigate the Mailman, a mysterious new warlock which it suspects of conducting a large-scale subversion of databases and networks. The Mailman has been recruiting others, such as the warlock DON.MAC, by promising great power in the real world, and claims to be responsible for a recent revolution in [[Venezuela]]. Because he never appears in the Other Plane, preferring non real-time communication, Mr. Slippery and fellow warlock Erythrina begin to suspect that the Mailman may be an extraterrestrial invader, subverting global databases to gradually conquer the Earth while causing True Deaths of the warlocks he recruits.

Mr. Slippery and Erythrina receive permission from the government to use the old [[Arpanet]] to access massive amounts of computational power around the world as they search for the Mailman. As they become the most powerful warlocks in history they realize that DON.MAC is a sophisticated "[[artificial intelligence|personality simulator]]" working for the Mailman. It violently defends itself, and both sides use network connections to military weaponry to attack in the real world. Erythrina is forced to reveal her True Name to Mr. Slippery as the battles, real and virtual, cause global chaos. They succeed in destroying the many copies of the Mailman's AI, and although tempted to keep their power over the world realize that they do not wish to be tyrants.

Ten weeks after the war and resulting worldwide [[economic depression]] from the disruption in computer systems, Mr. Slippery returns to the Coven and learns that the Mailman may have survived. Fearing that Erythrina succumbed to temptation for power, Pollack visits her—Debbie Charteris of [[Providence, Rhode Island]]—in person. The elderly Charteris, an early military computer programmer, reveals that the Mailman was not an extraterrestrial, but a [[National Security Agency]] AI research project to protect government systems. Mistakenly left running, it slowly grew in power and sophistication, and used non real-time communication to disguise its inability to fully emulate the human mind. As Charteris succumbs to senility she transfers more of her personality to the defeated Mailman's [[kernel (operating system)|kernel]], and tells Pollack that "when this body dies, I will still be, and you can still talk to me".

==Afterword==

Minsky's afterword reviews ideas from his [[Society of Mind]] concept: the idea "that there is, inside the cranium, perhaps as many as a hundred different kinds of computers, each with a somewhat different basic architecture", which specialize in different tasks and communicate, though perhaps only crudely. Minsky considers our conscious minds to be higher-level executives, which don't really understand the inner workings of the subcomponents but rather select "simple names from menu-lists of symbols which appear, from time to time, upon our mental screen-displays." Tying this back to virtual reality, Minsky suggests that "we, ourselves, already exist as processes imprisoned in machines inside machines! Our mental worlds are already filled with wondrous, magical, symbol–signs, which add to every thing we 'see' its ‘meaning’ and ‘significance’."&lt;ref name=Minsky1984&gt;{{cite web|last1=Minsky|first1=Marvin|title=Afterword to Vernor Vinge's novel, "True Names".|accessdate=24 October 2014|url=https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/papers/TrueNames.Afterword.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Waterleaf respond - geograph.org.uk - 1179152.jpg|thumb|English Romanesque waterleaf capital]]

In [[architecture]], a '''waterleaf''' is a distinctive [[sculpture|sculptural]] motif used on the [[capital (architecture)|capitals]] of [[column]]s and pillars in [[Europe]]an buildings during the late twelfth century. It is a highly simplified plant motif, characteristic of the "late [[Norman architecture|Norman]]" style of [[Romanesque architecture]]. 

A '''waterleaf capital''' is formed of broad, smooth leaf-shapes (typically four in number), unribbed except for a central fold, which curve upward and outward before curling over at the tips where they meet the [[abacus (architecture)|abacus]] (the flat slab at the top of the column, normally square but sometimes [[octagon]]al). The curled tip of the waterleaf may be small and neat or large and bulbous; it usually curves inward towards the abacus, but may occasionally turn outwards (both forms can sometimes be seen in adjacent capitals of the same period, as for example at [[Geddington]], Northamptonshire, UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crsbi.ac.uk/search/location/geddington*/site/ed-nh-geddi.html ''The Corpus of'' ROMANESQUE SCULPTURE ''in Britain and Ireland'' (CRSBI) website:] Geddington&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''XMPP Standards Foundation''' ('''XSF''') is the foundation in charge of the standardization of the protocol extensions of [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]], the open standard of [[instant messaging]] and presence of the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]].

== History ==
The XSF was originally called the '''Jabber Software Foundation''' (JSF). The Jabber Software Foundation was originally established to provide an independent, non-profit, legal entity to support the development community around Jabber technologies (and later XMPP). Originally its main focus was on developing JOSL, the [[Jabber Open Source License]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opensource.org/licenses/jabberpl.php Open Source Initiative OSI - Jabber Open Source License:Licensing]&lt;/ref&gt; (since deprecated), and an open standards process for documenting the protocols used in the Jabber/XMPP developer community. Its founders included Michael Bauer and Peter Saint-Andre.

== Process ==
Members of the XSF vote on acceptance of new members, a technical Council, and a Board of Directors. However, membership is not required to publish, view, or comment on the standards that it promulgates. The unit of work at the XSF is the XMPP Extension Protocol (XEP); XEP-0001&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html XEP-0001]&lt;/ref&gt; specifies the process for XEPs to be accepted by the community. Most of the work of the XSF takes place on the XMPP Extension Discussion List&lt;ref&gt;[http://mail.jabber.org/mailman/listinfo/standards XMPP Extension Discussion List]&lt;/ref&gt; and the jdev Chat Room (xmpp:jdev@conference.jabber.org?join).

== Organization ==

=== Board of Directors ===
The Board of Directors&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/xsf/board/ XSF Board]&lt;/ref&gt; of the XMPP Standards Foundation oversees the business affairs of the organization. As elected by the XSF membership, the Board of Directors for 2018-2019 consists of the following individuals:
* Ralph Meijer
* Matthew Wild
* Guus der Kinderen
* Nicolas Vérité
* Severino Ferrer de la Peñita

=== Council ===
The XMPP Council&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/council/ XMPP Council]&lt;/ref&gt; is the technical steering group that approves XMPP Extension Protocols, as governed by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090127051940/http://xmpp.org/xsf/docs/bylaws.shtml XSF Bylaws] and [http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0001.html XEP-0001]. The Council is elected by the members of the XMPP Standards Foundation each year in September. The XMPP Council (2018–2019) consists of the following individuals:
* Jonas Schäfer
* Georg Lukas
* Dave Cridland
* Emmanuel Gil Peyrot
* Kevin Smith

=== Members ===
There are currently 66 elected members&lt;ref&gt;[https://xmpp.org/about/xsf/members XSF Member List]&lt;/ref&gt; of the XSF.

==== Emeritus Members ====
The following individuals are emeritus members of the XMPP Standards Foundation:
* Ryan Eatmon
* Peter Millard (deceased)
* [[Jeremie Miller]]
* Julian Missig
* Thomas Muldowney
* Dave Smith

== XEPs ==
One of the most important outputs of the XSF is a series&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/ XMPP Extensions list]&lt;/ref&gt; of "XEPs", or XMPP Extension Protocols, auxiliary protocols defining additional features. Some have chosen to pronounce "XEP" as if it were spelled "JEP", rather than "ZEP", in order to keep with a sense of tradition. Some XEPs of note include:
* Data Forms&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0004.html Data Forms XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Service Discovery&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0030.html Service Discovery XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Multi-User Chat&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0045.html Multi-User Chat XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Publish-Subscribe&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html Publish-Subscribe XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* XHTML-IM&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0071.html XHTML-IM XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Entity Capabilities&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0115.html Entity Capabilities XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[BOSH (protocol)|Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH)]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0124.html Bidirectional-streams Over Synchronous HTTP (BOSH) XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jingle_(protocol)|Jingle]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0166.html Jingle XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Serverless Messaging&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0174.html Serverless Messaging XEP]&lt;/ref&gt;

== XMPP Summit ==
The XSF biannually holds a [[XMPP Summit]] where software and protocol developers from all around the world meet and share ideas and discuss topics around the XMPP protocol and the XEPs. In winter it takes place around the [[FOSDEM]] event in Brussels, Belgium and in summer it takes place around the [[RealtimeConf]] event in Portland, USA. These meetings are open to anyone and focus on discussing both technical and non-technical issues that the XSF members wish to discuss with no costs attached for the participants. However the XSF is open to donations. The first XMPP Summit took place on July 24 and 25, 2006, in Portland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/summit/summit1.shtml XMPP Summit 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201101518/http://xmpp.org/summit/summit1.shtml |date=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
