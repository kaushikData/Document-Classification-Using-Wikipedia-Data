      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2130">'''Acoustic dispersion''' is the phenomenon of a [[sound wave]] separating into its component [[frequencies]] as it passes through a [[transmission medium|material]]. The [[phase velocity]] of the sound wave is viewed as a function of frequency. Hence, separation of component frequencies is measured by the rate of change in phase velocities as the radiated waves pass through a given medium.&lt;ref name=Sci-Tech-Dictionary&gt;

==Broadband transmission method==
A widely used technique for determining acoustic dispersion is a broadband transmission method. This technique was originally introduced in 1978 and has been employed to study the dispersion properties of [[metal]] (1978), [[epoxy resin]] (1986), [[paper|paper materials]] (1993) ultra-sound contrast agent (1998). In 1990 and 1993 this method confirmed the [[Kramers–Kronig relation]] for [[acoustic wave]]s.&lt;ref name=J-Acoust-Soc-Am-107/&gt;

Application of this method requires the measurements of a reference velocity to obtain values for the acoustic dispersion. This is accomplished by determining (usually) the speed of the sound in water, the thickness of the specimen, and the phase spectrum of each of the two transmitted [[ultrasound]] pulses.&lt;ref name=J-Acoust-Soc-Am-107/&gt;

== Career ==
After graduation, Raissyan began work at [[MCI Inc.|MCI]], where she met her future husband, Hamid Ansari. They married in 1991.&lt;ref name= poised&gt;{{cite news |title= First female space tourist poised for launch | publisher=CNN .com | date=2006-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, she persuaded her husband and her brother-in-law Amir Ansari to co-found Telecom Technologies Inc., using their savings and corporate retirement accounts, as deregulation happened in the US telecommunications industry.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The company was a supplier of [[softswitch]] technology that enabled [[Telecommunication|telecom]] "service providers to enhance system performance, lower operating costs and furnish new revenue opportunities." The company, headquartered in Richardson, Texas, offered products that allowed the integration between existing telecom networks and application-centric, next-generation networks via [[Call control|software switch technology]].&lt;ref name=sn20010116&gt;{{cite web |title=Telecom Technologies Wins 2nd Straight Communications Solutions Product of the Year Award |url=http://www.sonusnet.com/content/press-details/TELECOM-TECHNOLOGIES-WINS-2ND-STRAIGHT-COMMUNICATIONS-SOLUTIONS-PRODUCT-OF-YEAR-AWARD/235.aspx |work=press release |publisher=Sonus Networks |accessdate=2011-03-29 |date=2001-01-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015032053/http://sonusnet.com/content/press-details/TELECOM-TECHNOLOGIES-WINS-2ND-STRAIGHT-COMMUNICATIONS-SOLUTIONS-PRODUCT-OF-YEAR-AWARD/235.aspx |archivedate=2010-10-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Telecom Technologies was acquired by [[Sonus Networks, Inc.]] in 2001 in a stock-for-stock transaction for 10.8 million shares of Sonus stock.

Prodea is a privately held company formed by the Ansari family with development centers in both Richardson, Texas, and Silicon Valley.

== Space ==
Ansari has expressed that she does not consider herself a "space tourist", and prefers the title of "[[spaceflight participant]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/SEMD58BE8YE_index_0.html|title=Space for Business Newsletter article from February 2007: "I am NOT a tourist"}} February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Ansari is a member of the X PRIZE Foundation's Vision Circle, as well as its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref name="X Prize Foundation Board"&gt;{{cite web | title= Board of Trustees | url= http://www.xprizefoundation.com/about_us/board.asp | publisher= [[X PRIZE Foundation]] | accessdate=2006-09-11| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060910180940/http://www.xprizefoundation.com/about_us/board.asp| archivedate= 10 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with her brother-in-law, [[Amir Ansari]], she made a multimillion-dollar contribution to the X PRIZE foundation on May 5, 2004, the 43rd anniversary of [[Alan Shepard]]'s sub-orbital spaceflight. The X PRIZE was officially renamed the ''Ansari X PRIZE'' in honor of their donation. As demonstrated by her commitment to the X PRIZE and through presentations at Space Enthusiast conferences, Ansari is a spokesperson for the "privatization of space", a process enabling commercially viable companies to government-independently send equipment and/or people into space for exploration and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saab|first=Bechara|title=Planet Earth, Space Debris|journal=Hypothesis|date=September 2009|volume=7|issue=1|pages=e1|doi=10.5779/hypothesis.v7i1.138|url=http://www.hypothesisjournal.com/?p=828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ansari family investment firm, also named Prodea, has announced a partnership with [[Space Adventures|Space Adventures, Ltd.]] and the [[Russian Federal Space Agency|Federal Space Agency of the Russian Federation]] (FSA) to create a fleet of suborbital spaceflight vehicles (the [[Space Adventures Explorer]]) for global commercial use.&lt;ref name="Space Tourism Pioneers, Space Adventures and the [[Ansari X PRIZE]] Title Sponsors, to Provide First Suborbital Spaceflight Tourism Vehicles "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/02-16-2006/0004283899&amp;EDATE=|title=Space Tourism Pioneers, Space Adventures, and the Ansari X PRIZE Title Sponsors to Provide First Suborbital Spaceflight Tourism Vehicles |work=[[PR Newswire]]|accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Spaceflight ===

Ansari trained as a backup for [[Daisuke Enomoto]] for a [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] flight to the International Space Station, through Space Adventures, Ltd.&lt;ref name="Iranian Woman Blazes Trail Into Space"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Iranian_Woman_Blazes_Trail_Into_Space_999.html |title=Iranian Woman Blazes Trail Into Space |work=[[Spacedaily.com]] |accessdate=2006-08-27 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060808063618/http://www.space-travel.com/reports/Iranian_Woman_Blazes_Trail_Into_Space_999.html |archivedate=2006-08-08 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 2006, Enomoto was medically disqualified from flying the [[Soyuz TMA-9]] mission that was due to launch the following month. The next day Ansari was elevated to the prime crew.&lt;ref name="replace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20060822/53002090.html|title=Iranian-born American approved to replace Japanese space tourist|work=Novosti|accessdate=2006-08-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060905083059/http://en.rian.ru/world/20060822/53002090.html| archivedate= 5 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition14/exp14_advancer.html|title=NASA Expedition 14 Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked what she hoped to achieve on her spaceflight, Ansari said, "I hope to inspire everyone—especially young people, women, and young girls all over the world, and in Middle Eastern countries that do not provide women with the same opportunities as men—to not give up their dreams and to pursue them... It may seem impossible to them at times. But I believe they can realize their dreams if they keep it in their hearts, nurture it, and look for opportunities and make those opportunities happen."&lt;ref name="Space.com interview with Anousheh Ansari"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060915_ansari_qna.html|title=Interview with Anousheh Ansari, the First Female Space Tourist|accessdate=2006-09-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060920022453/http://space.com/missionlaunches/060915_ansari_qna.html| archivedate= 20 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day before her departure, she was interviewed on Iran national television for the astronomy show ''Night's Sky''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranian.com/Kasraie/2004/October/Ansari/index.html|title=Up, Up, and Away!}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hosts wished her success and thanked her on behalf of Iranians.

Ansari lifted off on the Soyuz TMA-9 mission with commander [[Mikhail Tyurin]] ([[Russian Federal Space Agency|RSA]]) and flight engineer [[Michael Lopez-Alegria]] ([[NASA]]) at 04:59 ([[UTC]]) on Monday September 18, 2006, from [[Baikonur]], [[Kazakhstan]]. Ansari became the fourth (and first female) [[space tourism|space tourist]]. Her contract did not allow for disclosure of the amount paid, but previous space tourists have paid in excess of $20 million [[USD]].

* How changes in muscles influence lower back pain.
* Consequences of space radiation on ISS crew members and different species of microbes that have made a home for themselves on the space station.

She also became the first person to publish a [[weblog]] from space.

=== Iranian flag controversy ===

Ansari intended to wear the [[U.S. flag]] on her spacesuit alongside a politically neutral version of the [[Flag of Iran|Iranian flag]], i.e. the simple 3-color flag with no government-specific emblem, to honor the two countries that have contributed to her life.&lt;ref name="Iranian flag in Space"&gt;{{cite news | first= West | last= Ender | url= http://www.persianstudents.org/archives/002273.html | title= Iranian flag in Space | publisher= Persian Students in the UK Weblog | date= 2006-08-28 | accessdate= 2007-01-07 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070107153512/http://www.persianstudents.org/archives/002273.html | archivedate= 7 January 2007 | deadurl= yes | df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few U.S.-based media wrongly speculated that she was intending to wear the version of the Iranian flag that predated the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran.&lt;ref name="U.S.: Iranian-American To Be First Female Civilian In Space" /&gt;

At the insistence of the [[NASA]] and Russian officials, she did not wear the Iranian flag officially, but wore the Iranian flag colors instead and kept the Iranian flag on her official flight patch.&lt;ref name="Local space tourist's Iran patch spurs dispute"&gt;{{cite news |first=Shelly |last=Slater |url=http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa060914_mo_womanspace.d4fdda8.html |title=Local space tourist's Iran patch spurs dispute |publisher=[[WFAA]] (online) |date=2006-09-14 |accessdate=2006-09-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017194432/http://www.wfaa.com/sharedcontent/dws/wfaa/latestnews/stories/wfaa060914_mo_womanspace.d4fdda8.html |archivedate=2006-10-17 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She and her husband said no political message was intended, despite the increasing tensions with United States and Iran relations, which had dominated world headlines in the weeks leading up to her launch. She noted that she had "plans to devote her mission to expanding a global consciousness she expected would be seeded with her first look at Earth from space".

=== Reactions to Ansari's flight ===

==== Crewmates ====
[[Michael López-Alegría]], the Spanish-born NASA astronaut who flew on the Russian Soyuz spacecraft on the return flight with Ansari, expressed his doubts to reporters before the flight: "I'm not a big fan personally of having those guys go visit the space station because I think the space station is still a place that is under construction, and not quite operational. I don't think it's ideal."&lt;ref name="First Female Space Tourist, Next ISS Crew Set to Launch"&gt;{{cite news |first= Ker | last = Than | url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060916_exp14_prelaunch.html| title=First Female Space Tourist, Next ISS Crew Set to Launch | publisher=[[space.com]] | date =2006-09-16 | accessdate =2006-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

López-Alegría later stated that he was skeptical of private tourists a few years ago, but now believes it is essential to the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: "If that's the correct solution... then not only is it good from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," he said. Ansari's presence in space "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world."&lt;ref name="First female space tourist blasts off"&gt;{{cite news | first= Mike| last= Eckel |title= First female space tourist blasts off| publisher=[[Yahoo News]] | date= 2006-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same [[Associated Press]] story also quoted [[Mikhail Tyurin]] describing Ansari as "very professional" and said he felt like they had worked together for a decade.

==== Reactions in Iran ====

The flight was given significant coverage by [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting|Iranian state television]], with an hour long live interview with Ansari being broadcast on the show ''Aseman-e-Shab'' ("Night Sky"). Ansari was praised by newspapers such as ''Hambastegi'' and ''Jam-e-Jam Daily'', which published daily columns detailing the journey. The [[astronomy]] magazine ''NOJUM'' also published an exclusive interview of Pouria Nazemi with Ansari before her trip, in which she discussed her vision for [[Private spaceflight|commercial spaceflight]]. ''NOJUM'' also organized and held gatherings when the [[ISS]] passed over Iran's cities. Shahram Yazdanpanah, made a special part about Anousheh's trip to space at Persian "Space Science" website and covered all the news of trip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spacescience.ir/Anousheh_Ansari.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602002440/http://www.spacescience.ir/anousheh_ansari.htm |archivedate=2008-06-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Interviews ===

The '''AstroFlight Sunrise''' was an unmanned [[Experimental aircraft|experimental]] [[electric aircraft]] technology demonstrator and the first aircraft to fly on [[solar power]].&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg1"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/First_Solar_Powered_Aircraft.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 1|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First conceived in November 1970, the Sunrise first flew on 4 November 1974 from Bicycle Lake, a dry lakebed on the [[Fort Irwin Military Reservation]], [[California]], [[United States]]. The first prototype was destroyed on its 28th flight by turbulence. The improved Sunrise II flew the following year.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg13"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Flight__Tests.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 13|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="google2004"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1563476444|title = Unmanned aviation: a brief history of unmanned aerial vehicles|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Newcome|first = Laurence R.|authorlink = |year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA2008"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-054-DFRC.html|title = Solar-Power Research and Dryden|accessdate = 2009-09-15|last = Curry |first = Marty|authorlink = |date=March 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091028093131/http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-054-DFRC.html| archivedate= 28 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
While working as an engineer at [[Hughes Aircraft]], Roland Boucher began design work on an electric-powered aircraft concept in November 1970, calculating that the contemporary [[nickel-cadmium]] batteries available would be sufficient to sustain flight using a radio-control model glider. Early experimental projects proved the concept sound and in 1973 Boucher turned his attention to the creation of a high-altitude solar-powered aircraft that would have unlimited endurance.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg1" /&gt;

Boucher explained the project to his superiors at Hughes Aircraft in 1972 and after reviewing it, the company released the project to Boucher in 1973. Boucher took a leave of absence from Hughes to pursue the project and joined his brother, Bob Boucher, at [[AstroFlight]], a small model airplane manufacturer in [[Venice, California]]. After successfully flying an electric drone carrying a {{convert|5|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} payload on a [[DARPA]] project for [[Northrop Corporation]], they then moved onto Project Sunrise.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg9"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Page_9.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 9|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using commercially available [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off-the-shelf]] solar cells producing only 10% efficiency, Boucher calculated that his project would need to be able to fly on about {{convert|0.5|kW|hp|1|abbr=on}}. The aircraft was envisioned as an unmanned [[Glider (sailplane)|sailplane]] that would have an operating altitude of {{convert|73000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}},  powered by a single [[Samarium–cobalt magnet]] electric motor, the first motor of its kind in the world. The aircraft would use no batteries and, instead, would descend at night from its operating altitude to about {{convert|10000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} at dawn, before solar energy was once again available for climb.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg2"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/The_Concept.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 2|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg4"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Page_4.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 4|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg11"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Page_11.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 11|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boucher saw the Sunrise as a proof of concept for a follow on aircraft that would be capable of remaining aloft for months at an altitude of {{convert|100000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg8"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Construction.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 8|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Project Sunrise'' was funded by DARPA commencing in January 1974 and administered by [[Lockheed Aircraft Corporation]] of [[Sunnyvale, California]], with the contract specifying a "proof of concept aircraft powered solely by incident sunlight on the wing surfaces."&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg8" /&gt;

Roland Boucher took on the task of the structural design, aerodynamics, telemetry, control and navigation. He also designed the integration of the solar panel, electric motors, gearbox and the propeller. He selected an Eppler 387 [[airfoil]] for the wing. The solar cells were {{convert|5|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} round commercial units provided by [[Heliotech]]. The actual airframe was constructed by a team under expert model builder Phil Bernhardt.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg9" /&gt;

The Sunrise's [[wing span]] was {{convert|32|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and the aircraft had a gross weight of {{convert|22|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The [[wing loading]] was a very low 4 ounces per square foot (0.011&amp;nbsp;kg/sq m). The aircraft structure was built from spruce, balsa and maple. Due to their roughness the solar cells were only mounted on the aft two-thirds of the wing's upper surface.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg8" /&gt;

The wing spars were built from spruce spar caps with maple doublers at all attachment points and two {{convert|3/32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} balsa shear webs attached to {{convert|1/8|to|3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} balsa strips on the wing spars. The ribs were made from {{convert|3/32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} balsa. This construction resulted in a balsa spar box with tapered spruce caps. The leading edge was covered with {{convert|1/32|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} balsa to form a leading edge D spar. The trailing edge was formed by two {{convert|2|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} wide {{convert|1/32|in|mm|1|abbr=on}} sheets forming a triangle with {{convert|1/8|to|3/8|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} vertical spar sections in between the ribs. The covering was 1/2 mil [[Mylar]]. The {{convert|32|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} span wing weighed {{convert|5|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and was capable of loads up to 100 pounds.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg10"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Page_10.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 10|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Control was via an [[S &amp; O Radio]] designed and built telemetry transmitter and receiver. The standard S&amp;O six channel radio had channels for elevator, rudder, motor on and off and solar cell operating mode. The solar cells could be set for either [[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]] or [[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]] operation. The telemetry functions provided gave data on motor current, motor voltage, motor RPM, airspeed and two heading references from a [[Solar compass|sun compass]] for navigation.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg11" /&gt;

==Operational history==
Flight testing commenced in 1974 at Bicycle Lake, California. The first flights were conducted on battery power, using a [[bungee cord]] launch to {{convert|20|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. On its first flight the aircraft reached 500 feet, before returning for a landing.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg13" /&gt;

A lack of sunny days delayed flight testing, but in all, 28 flights were made. The Sunrise would climb slowly at first until its solar cells cooled down and their efficiency increased. On its 28th flight the aircraft was destroyed when it was flown too close to a cumulus cloud at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and the associated turbulence broke the aircraft's structure.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg13" /&gt;

==Aftermath==
The success of the flights that had been completed allowed Boucher to state:

{{cquote|Project Sunrise had demonstrated the feasibility of solar powered flight to extreme altitudes".&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg13" /&gt; }}

DARPA and Lockheed proposed a follow-on design to the Sunrise to be powered at night by batteries instead of just gliding. Roland Boucher designed the second aircraft using higher efficiency solar panels that were more aerodynamically smooth.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg16"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.projectsunrise.info/Page_16.html|title = Project Sunrise pg 16|accessdate = 2009-09-23|last = Boucher|first = Roland|authorlink = |year = n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roland Boucher had become physically exhausted from his work on the initial Sunrise and he suffered from [[congestive heart failure]]. He was admitted to intensive care at [[Santa Monica Hospital]]. While in hospital he resigned from AstroFlight and sold his interests in the company to his brother Bob Boucher who continued work on the second Sunrise aircraft. After recuperating, Roland Boucher returned to work at Hughes Aircraft on classified military programs.&lt;ref name="ProjectSunrisePg16" /&gt;

The Sunrise II first flew on 27 September 1975 from [[Nellis AFB]], near [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].&lt;ref name="google2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA2008" /&gt;

The '''Beach Abort''' was an unmanned test in NASA's [[Project Mercury]], of the Mercury spacecraft [[Launch escape system|Launch Escape System]]. Objectives of the test were a performance evaluation of the escape system, the parachute and landing system, and recovery operations in an off-the-pad abort situation.&lt;ref name="KSC Science Site" /&gt; The test took place at NASA's [[Wallops Island]], Virginia, test facility on May 9, 1960. In the test, the Mercury spacecraft and its Launch Escape System were fired from ground level. The flight lasted a total of 1 minute, 16 seconds. The spacecraft reached an apogee of {{convert|2,465|ft|km|disp=flip}} and splashed down in the ocean with a range of {{convert|0.6|mi|km|disp=flip}}.Top speed was a velocity of {{convert|976|mph|m/s|disp=flip}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pearlman |first1=Robert |title=NASA's Launch Abort Test Builds on 50 Years of Astronaut Escape Systems |url=https://www.space.com/8362-nasa-launch-abort-test-builds-50-years-astronaut-escape-systems.html |website=Space.com |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weebau" /&gt; A Marine Corps helicopter recovered the spacecraft 17 minutes after launch.  The test was considered a success, although there was insufficient separation distance when the tower jettisoned.

[[Image:calciumreactor.jpg|thumb|250px|Calcium reactor]]
In [[marine aquarium|marine]] and [[reef aquarium]]s, a '''calcium reactor''' creates a balance of [[Alkali|alkalinity]]. An acidic solution is produced by injecting [[carbon dioxide]] into a chamber with [[seawater|salt water]] and [[calcium]] rich media. The carbon dioxide lowers the [[pH]] by producing a solution high in [[carbonic acid]], and [[solvation|dissolves]] calcium. The effluent is returned to the [[reef aquarium]] where the calcium is consumed by organisms, primarily [[coral]]s when building skeletons. A calcium reactor is an efficient method to supply calcium to a reef aquarium. Reactors may be used in elaborate [[freshwater]] and brackish aquariums where freshwater clams and other [[invertebrates]] need a constant supply of [[calcium]].

The reactor dissolves the calcium-laden media to provide bicarbonates HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (alkalinity) and calcium (Ca&lt;sup&gt;++&lt;/sup&gt;) ions at the sames rate as consumed during calcification. Effectively dissolving the media requires an acidic pH. Saltwater may have a pH of 7.8 or higher, so to reduce the pH carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is used. The reaction formula is: 

: CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ⟷ Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Inside the reaction chamber, a calcium rich media ([[aragonite]]), mainly CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is forced into contact with water injected with [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in order to create [[carbonic acid]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). This increases the solubility of the [[calcium carbonate]]. The reaction frees the calcium and carbonate, supplying the aquarium with water rich in Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, important for maintaining alkalinity and calcium levels.

The bubble counter measures carbon dioxide. The [[Volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] of carbon dioxide is monitored so that the dissolved gas goes into the solution, with a minimum unconsumed. A [[needle valve]] or [[solenoid valve]] regulates the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bubble rate. Valves with precise adjustment abilities improve bubble control.

The feed pump controls the volume of water exchange. This is important because a high rate of water flow into the reactor reduces its efficiency, thus resulting in underproduction and a waste of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some reactors siphon water into the input of the reactor's re-circulation pump. A potential complication is the medium in the reactor becoming compacted, increasing [[back pressure]] onto the pump and reducing water into the reactor. Placing a gate or needle valve on the reactor's outlet side will improve flow characteristics compared to control from the inlet side.

[[Peristaltic pump]]s are effective operating against pressure, capable of supplying an adjustable and continuous flow over flow rates with minimal maintenance.

The pH control is connected to a probe in the reactor and adjusts the rate at which the calcium media dissolves. This probe monitors the pH level in the calcium reactor. The pH range for the typical calcium reactor is 6.5–6.8. When the pH rises above a certain level, a valve opens, allowing carbon dioxide to enter the reactor. The control closes the valve as the pH falls below this level.

Some pH controllers have an interface for an air pump. This air pump is connected to an airstone in the sump or main tank. If the probe detects a low pH level, the pump activates. The bubbles raise the pH by dissipating the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

A '''cholesteric liquid crystal display (ChLCD)''' is a display containing a [[liquid crystal]] with a [[Helix|helical]] structure and which is therefore [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. Cholesteric liquid crystals are also known as ''[[Liquid crystal#Chiral phases|chiral nematic liquid crystals]]''.  They organize in layers with no positional ordering within layers, but a director axis which varies with layers.  The variation of the director axis tends to be periodic in nature.  The period of this variation (the distance over which a full rotation of 360° is completed) is known as the pitch, p. This pitch determines the wavelength of light which is reflected ([[Bragg reflection|Bragg Reflection]]).

The technology is characterized by stable states i.e. focal conic state (dark state) and planar state (bright state). Displays based on this technology are called “bistable” and don’t need any power to maintain the information (zero power). Because of the reflective nature of the ChLCD, these displays can be perfectly read under sunlight conditions.

Examples of compounds known to form cholesteric phases are [[hydroxypropyl cellulose]] and [[cholesteryl benzoate]].

Some companies, such as [[Chiral Photonics]], have begun to explore CLCs as the basis for [[photonic]] devices.

A US company, [http://www.kentdisplays.com/ Kent Displays], has developed "no power" [[Liquid crystal display|Liquid Crystal Displays]] using Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Liquid Crystals: these are known as ChLCD screens. A drawback of ChLCD screens is their slow refresh rate, especially at low temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Displays – Einführung in die Technik aktiver und passiver Anzeigen|last = Knoll|first = Peter M.|publisher = Hüthig|year = 1995|isbn = 978-3778513576|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Liquid Crystals Applications and Uses, Vol. 3|last = Bahadur|first = Birenda|publisher = World Scientific Publishing|year = 1992|isbn = 978-9810229528|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Kent demonstrated the use of a ChLCD to cover the entire surface of a [[mobile phone]], allowing it to change colours, and keep that colour even when power is cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.kentdisplays.com/products/lcdelectronicskins.html|title =Electronic Skin from Kent Displays|date =|accessdate =2014-05-14|website =|publisher =|last =|first =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140420081824/http://www.kentdisplays.com/products/lcdelectronicskins.html|archivedate =2014-04-20|df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[SID]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Entire Surface of Handset becomes LCD Display|publisher=Nikkei Tech-On|author=Tetsuo Nozawa|url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/english/NEWS_EN/20090609/171529 |accessdate=2014-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Industrial Technology Research Institute has developed a flexible ePaper called i2R based on ChLCD technology. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140515053134/https://www.itri.org.tw/eng/econtent/research/research03_02.aspx?sid=23 ITRI]

The German company [http://www.bmgmis.de/ BMG MIS] (formerly AEG MIS) has developed “Geameleon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.bmgmis.de/Portals/8/PRODUKTE/SYSTEMS/Geameleon_Prosp_EN.PDF|title = Geameleon|date = |accessdate =2014-05-14 |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;”- ChLCDs full color and monochrome in various sizes and resolutions. These ChLCDs can be used in extremely wide temperature applications i.e. for outdoor application. Various update versions can be applied to achieve a reasonable update time even at very low temperatures. Because of its very low power consumption, this technology is highly preferred to be used in self-sustaining applications (solar power applications).

==Various continuum models==

=== Elise Boulding's conflict continuum===
[[Elise M. Boulding]] was a Quaker sociologist influenced by the events of World War II. Examining how war becomes peace, she posited a continuum between Wars of Extermination &lt;ref name="HockerW"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hocker, Joyce &amp; William W. Wilmot | title = Interpersonal Conflict, 4th Edition | year = 1995 | publisher = Brown &amp; Benchmark, Madison }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |title=History |year=2001 |publisher=The Institute for Global Leadership |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxd3ekHA?url=http://www.global-leader.org/gl_history_gmrs.htm |archivedate=14 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is Boulding’s conflict continuum:&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt;  War of extermination, Limited war, Threat systems (deterrence), Arbitration, Mediation, Negotiation (exchange), Mutual adaptation, Alliance, Co-operation, Integration,&lt;ref name="HockerW" /&gt; Transformation.&lt;ref name="GLorg" /&gt;

===Andra Medea===
{{COI|section|date=March 2013}}
{{primary sources|section|date=March 2013}}
Theorist [[Andra Medea]] seeks to explain how [[individuals]], small groups, [[organizations]], [[family|families]], [[ethnicities]], and even whole [[nations]] function when disputes arise between them. She posits that there are four types or levels of conflict, each operating under distinct rules: 1) ''Problem Solving''; 2) ''Domination''; 3) ''Blind Behavior''; 4) ''Rogue Messiah''.&lt;ref&gt;Andra Medea interviewed by McDonnell, Jerome. [http://www.wbez.org/episode-segments/may-6-1999 "WorldView"]. WBEZ, Chicago. 16 May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each level moving from first to fourth is characterized by increasing degrees of separation from reality, and decreasing degrees of maturity, in this context, defined as the ability to control anger and settle differences without violence or destruction. Problem-solving behavior is based in reality and maturity, and is therefore more rational and mature than domination. Domination is more rational and mature than blind behavior, which is more rational and mature than the Rogue Messiah.&lt;ref name="AMbookA"&gt;Medea, Andra. “The Conflict Continuum.”  Chicago, 1996. Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, each level moving from fourth to first is more capable than the one below it at forcing victory in a conflict. The Rogue Messiah overpowers blind behavior, blind behavior thwarts domination, and domination deadlocks Problem-solving.&lt;ref name="AMbookA" /&gt;

[[File:Sturmfront auf Doppler-Radar-Schirm.jpg|thumb|right|The scale of dBZ values can be seen along the bottom of the image.]]
'''dBZ''' stands for ''[[decibel]] relative to Z''. It is a [[logarithm]]ic [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]] technical unit used in [[radar]], mostly in [[weather radar]], to compare the equivalent [[reflectivity]] factor (Z) of a radar signal reflected off a remote object (in mm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; per [[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) to the return of a droplet of rain with a diameter of 1&amp;nbsp;mm (1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; per [[meter|m]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.srh.noaa.gov/jetstream/append/glossary_d.htm | work = NWS JetStream | title = Weather Glossary: D's | accessdate= 2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proportional to the number of drops per unit volume and the sixth power of drops' diameter and is thus used to estimate the rain or snow intensity.&lt;ref name=Yau/&gt; With other variables analyzed from the radar returns it helps to determine the type of precipitation. Both the radar reflectivity factor and its logarithmic version are commonly referred to as ''reflectivity'' when the context is clear.

== Principle ==

The radar reflectivity factor ('''Z''') of [[precipitation]] is dependent on the number ('''N&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''') and size ('''D''') of reflectors ([[hydrometeor]]s), which includes [[rain]], [[snow]], [[graupel]], and [[hail]]. Very sensitive radars can also measure the reflectivity of cloud drops and ice. For an exponential distribution of reflectors, Z is expressed by:&lt;ref name=Yau&gt;{{Cite book
|title=Short Course in Cloud Physics, Third Edition
|author=M. K. Yau and R. R. Rogers
|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann
|year=1989
|pages=190
|isbn=0750632151}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2014-02-21--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \int_{0}^{Dmax} N_0 e^{-\Lambda D} D^6dD &lt;/math&gt;

As rain droplets have a diameter of the order of 1 [[millimetre]], Z is in mm&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; ([[μm]]&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), a quite unusual unit. By dividing Z with the equivalent return of a 1&amp;nbsp;mm drop in a volume of a meter cube (Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) and using the logarithm of the result (because the values vary greatly from drizzle to hail), one obtains the dimensionless quantity dBZ:

:&lt;math&gt;dBZ \propto 10\, \log_{10} \frac {Z}{Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;

dBZ values can be converted to rainfall rates in millimetres per hour using the Marshall-Palmer formula:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113151652/http://www.desktopdoppler.com/help/nws-nexrad.htm#rainfall%20rates |title=NWS NEXRAD |accessdate=January 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{mm}}{\mathrm{h}} = \left ( \frac{10^{(dBZ/10)}}{200} \right )^{5 \over 8}&lt;/math&gt;

== Other quantities ==

The definition of Z above shows that a large number of small hydrometeors will reflect as one large hydrometeor. The signal returned to the [[radar]] will be equivalent in both situations, so a group of small hydrometeors is virtually indistinguishable from one large hydrometeor on the resulting radar image. The [[reflectivity]] image is just one type of image produced by a radar. Using it alone a meteorologist could not tell with certainty the type of [[precipitation]] and distinguish any [[Artifact (error)|artifacts]] affecting the radar return.

In combination with other information gathered by the radar during the same scan (dual [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] products and [[phase shifting]] due to the [[Doppler effect]]), meteorologists can distinguish between [[hail]], [[rain]], [[snow]], biologicals (birds, insects), and other atmospheric phenomena.

A '''discharge ionization detector (DID)''' is a type of detector used in [[gas chromatograph]]y.

==Principle==
A DID is an [[GC ion detector|ion detector]] which uses a high-voltage [[electric discharge]] to produce [[ion]]s.  The  detector  uses  an  electrical  discharge  in  helium  to
generate high energy UV photons and metastable [[helium]] which  ionizes  all  compounds  except  helium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cesstech.com.my/data/products/Gas/Gas_Chromatograph_GowMac%20Brochure/Gow-Mac%20590.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[ion]]s produce an [[electric current]], which is the [[signal (information theory)|signal]] output of the detector.  The greater the concentration of the component, the more ions are produced, and the greater the current.

==Application==
DIDs are sensitive to a broad range of components.
In Air Separation plants they are used to detect the components CO; CH2; C+; N2; O2 in Argon product in ppm range.

DIDs are non-destructive detectors.  They do not destroy/consume the components they detect.  Therefore, they can be used before other detectors in multiple-detector configurations.

DIDs are an improvement over [[Helium ionization detector]]s in that they contain no [[radioactive]] source.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''est: The Steersman Handbook''}}
'''''est: The Steersman Handbook, Charts of the Coming Decade of Conflict''''' is a work of [[science fiction]] cast as a [[false document|nonfictional study]]. Its author, credited as L. Clark Stevens, usually went by the name [[Leslie Stevens]].  Stevens has a long list of credits in the entertainment industry, having worked on, among other productions, ''[[The Outer Limits (1963 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]''.  The book was published in paperback in 1970, and reprinted in 1971.  

== Synopsis ==
The "est" in the book's title refers to what Stevens described as "Electronic Social Transformation".&lt;ref name="pressman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snapping"&gt;{{cite book | last = Conway | first = Flo  | authorlink = Flo Conway |author2=[[Jim Siegelman]]  | title = [[Snapping|Snapping: America's Epidemic of Sudden Personality Change]] | publisher = Stillpoint Press | year = 1995 |  pages = 6, 25–26 |   isbn =  0-9647650-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gengle"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Gengle | first = Dean |   title = The Netweaver's Sourcebook: A Guide to Micro Networking and Communications  | publisher = [[Addison-Wesley]] | year = 1984 |  pages = 215, 322  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book described a [[futurology|future]] society and the rise of what Stevens described as the "est people".&lt;ref name="pressman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snapping" /&gt;  The "est people" were a new generation of postliterate humans who were to bring about a "transformation" of society.&lt;ref name="pressman" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snapping" /&gt;  The "est people" were to be technically minded, eclectic, and computer literate. They would possess qualities necessary for social transformation, integral to [[Earth]]'s survival.  Individuals named as examples of "est people" in the book included [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], [[Ralph Nader]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], [[Malcolm X]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Lewis Mumford]], and [[Eric Hoffer]].

== Reception ==
Dean Gengle wrote in his book, ''The Netweaver's Sourcebook'', that the book: "..did more to liberate media-created hippies than just about any other work of its time."&lt;ref name="gengle" /&gt;  The book has also been referenced in later [[sociology|sociological]] evaluations of potential paths for society, including Michael Marien's ''Societal Directions and Alternatives'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Marien | first = Michael |   title = Societal Directions and Alternatives | publisher = Information for Policy Design | year = 1976 |  pages = 385, 386 |   id =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Gurth Higgin's ''Symptoms of Tomorrow''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Higgin  | first = Gurth |   title = Symptoms of Tomorrow: Letters from a Sociologist on the Present State of Society  | publisher = Plume Press  | year = 1973 |  pages = 157 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book's publisher, Capricorn Press or "Capra Press", would come to be better known, having published the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Center for Curriculum Design |    title =Somewhere Else: A Living-learning Catalog | publisher =Swallow Press | year =1973 |  pages =Page 42 | isbn = 0-8040-0610-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the book was speculative in nature, it's author, Stevens was subsequently consulted on issues relating to the future of the planet's economic, ecological and energy systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last =[[KPFK]] |  title =KPFK Folio JUNE 1974 | work =Pacifica Radio Archives | pages =Pages 13–24 |   date =June 22, 1974 | url =http://pacificaradioarchives.com/projects/folios/7406kpfk/7406txt2.html | accessdate = 2007-11-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book was later referenced by Mark Hinshaw in a piece describing two potential futures, who cited Steven's term "Electronic Social Transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hinshaw | first = Mark |   title = Wiring Megalopolis: Two Scenarios | journal = Radical Software | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–10 | url = http://www.radicalsoftware.org/volume2nr1/pdf/VOLUME2NR1_art02.pdf  |  id = | accessdate =  2001-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Erhard Seminars Training ==
Secondary sources have stated that the title of this work inspired [[Werner Erhard]] to name his company [[Erhard Seminars Training]], or ''est'' for short, and to refer to it as such in lower-case.  Peter Occhiogrosso writes in ''The Joy of Sects'' that Erhard borrowed the initials, "lowercase and all", from the book.&lt;ref name="Occhiogrosso"&gt;{{cite book | last = Occhiogrosso  | first = Peter |   title = The Joy of Sects | publisher = Image | date = September 4, 1997 |  pages = 543 |   isbn =  978-0-385-42565-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his book ''[[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]]'', [[Bob Larson]] refers to Erhard's friend Bill Thaw in citing the same information.&lt;ref name="larson"&gt;{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Bob | authorlink = Bob Larson |  title = [[Larson's Book of World Religions and Alternative Spirituality]] | publisher = Tyndale House Publishers, Inc. | year = 2004 |  pages = 176 | isbn = 0-8423-6417-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Steven Pressman]]'s book, ''[[Outrageous Betrayal]]'', Werner Erhard made other staff members on his [[Mind Dynamics]] sales team read the book.&lt;ref name="pressman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Pressman | first = Steven | authorlink = Steven Pressman |  title = [[Outrageous Betrayal]] | publisher = [[St. Martin's Press]]  | date = September 1993  |  pages = Chapter: [http://perso.orange.fr/eldon.braun/awareness/door2.html A Door to Door Mind Salesman]  |   isbn = 0-312-09296-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Explorer 41''', also called as '''IMP-G''' and '''IMP 5''', was a [[United States|U.S.]] [[satellite]] launched as part of [[Explorers program]]. Explorer 41 as launched on June 21, 1969 on [[Vandenberg Air Force Base|Vandenberg AFB]], [[California]], [[United States]], with an [[Delta rocket]]. Explorer 41 was the fifth satellite of the '''Interplanetary Monitoring Platform'''.&lt;ref name="astronautix"/&gt;

==Spacecraft and mission==
Explorer 41 was a spin-stabilized satellite placed into a high-inclination, [[highly elliptical orbit]] to measure energetic particles, [[magnetic field]]s, and [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] in [[cislunar space]]. The line of apsides and the satellite spin vector were within a few degrees of being parallel and normal, respectively, to the [[ecliptic]] plane. Initial local time of [[apogee]] was about 1,300 hours. Initial satellite spin rate was 27.5 [[Rotations per minute|rpm]]. 

The basic [[telemetry]] sequence was 20.48 seconds. Data transmission was nearly 100% for the spacecraft life except for the interval from November 15, 1971, to February 1, 1972, when data acquisition was limited to the vicinity of the [[magnetotail]] neutral sheet.

Explorer 41 functioned very well from launch until it decayed from orbit on December 23, 1972&lt;ref name="nssdc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/imp.htm|title=IMP|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|first=Mark|last=Wade|date=2011|accessdate=June 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

A '''femoral fracture''' is a [[bone fracture]] that involves the [[femur]]. They are typically sustained in high-impact trauma, such as car crashes, due to the large amount of force needed to break the bone. Fractures of the [[diaphysis]], or middle of the femur, are managed differently from those at the head, neck, and trochanter (see [[Hip fracture|''hip fractures'']]).

==Classification==
[[File:Structure of a Long Bone.png|thumb|The diaphysis is the midshaft of the femur]]
The fracture may be classed as ''open'', which occurs when the bone fragments protrude through the skin, or there is an overlying wound which penetrates to the bone. These types of fracture cause more damage to the surrounding tissue, are less likely to heal properly, and are at much greater risk of infection.

===Femoral shaft fractures===
[[Femoral shaft]] fractures can be classified with the [[Winquist and Hansen classification]], which is based on the amount of [[comminution]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zSy-FzCbWBkC&amp;pg=PA612 Page 612] in: Title	Surgical treatment of orthopaedic trauma. Authors: James P. Stannard, Andrew H. Schmidt, Philip J. Kregor. Publisher: Thieme, 2007. {{ISBN|1-58890-307-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-58890-307-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Distal femur fractures===

Fractures of the inferior or distal femur may be complicated by separation of the condyles, resulting in misalignment of the articular surfaces of the knee joint, or by hemorrhage from the large popliteal artery that runs directly on the posterior surface of the bone. This fracture compromises the blood supply to the leg (an occurrence that should always be considered in knee fractures or dislocations).&lt;ref&gt;Keith L. Moore, Arthur F. Dalley, Anne M.R. Agur. p527 of Clinical Oriented Anatomy 7th edition {{ISBN|978-1-4511-8447-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Fractures are commonly obvious, since femoral fractures are often caused by high energy trauma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucholz|first=R. W.|last2=Jones|first2=A.|date=December 1991|title=Fractures of the shaft of the femur|journal=The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery. American Volume|volume=73|issue=10|pages=1561–1566|issn=0021-9355|pmid=1748704}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signs of fracture include swelling, deformity, and shortening of the leg.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/444336477|title=Rockwood and Green's fractures in adults|date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Rockwood, Charles A., Jr., 1936-, Green, David P., Bucholz, Robert W.|isbn=9781605476773|edition=7th|location=Philadelphia, PA|oclc=444336477}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive soft-tissue injury, bleeding, and shock are common.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820106991|title=Current diagnosis &amp; treatment in orthopedics|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|others=Skinner, Harry B., McMahon, Patrick J. (Physician)|isbn=9780071590754|edition=5th|location=New York|oclc=820106991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common symptom is severe pain, which prevents movement of the leg.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706805938|title=Essentials of musculoskeletal care|date=2010|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons|others=Sarwark, John F.|isbn=9780892035793|location=Rosemont, Ill.|oclc=706805938}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Common fracture locations of femur.jpg|thumb|Common locations of fracture of femur]]
=== Physical exam ===
Femoral shaft fractures occur during extensive trauma, and they can act as distracting injuries, whereby the observer accidentally overlooks other injuries, preventing a thorough exam of the complete body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For example, the ligaments and meniscus of the ipsilateral (same side) knee are also commonly injured.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Radiography ===
Anterior-posterior (AP) and lateral radiographs are typically obtained.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to rule out other injuries, hip, pelvis, and knee radiographs are also obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846430144|title=Advanced trauma life support : student course manual|date=2012|publisher=American College of Surgeons|others=American College of Surgeons. Committee on Trauma.|isbn=9781880696026|edition=9th|location=Chicago, IL|oclc=846430144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hip radiograph is of particular importance, because femoral neck fractures can lead to osteonecrosis of the femoral head.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Treatment==
A 2015 Cochrane review found that available evidence for treatment options of distal femur fractures is insufficient to inform clinical practice and that there is a priority for a high-quality trial to be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Griffin|first1=XL|last2=Parsons|first2=N|last3=Zbaeda|first3=MM|last4=McArthur|first4=J|title=Interventions for treating fractures of the distal femur in adults.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=13 August 2015|volume=8|pages=CD010606|pmid=26270891|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010606.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Open fractures must undergo urgent surgery to clean and repair them, but closed fractures can be maintained until the patient is stable and ready for surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00521|title=Femur Shaft Fractures (Broken Thighbone)-OrthoInfo - AAOS|website=orthoinfo.aaos.org|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skeletal traction ===
Available evidence suggests that treatment depends on the part of the femur that is fractured. [[traction splint|Traction]] may be useful for femoral shaft fractures because it counteracts the force of the muscle pulling the two separated parts together, and thus may decrease bleeding and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli)) |publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York |year=2010 |pages=9 |isbn=0-07-148480-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traction should not be used in femoral neck fractures or when there is any other trauma to the leg or [[pelvis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[AAOS]]|title=Emergency Care and Transport of the Sick and Injured|publisher=Jones and Bartlett|location=Sudbury, Massachusetts|isbn=978-1-4496-3056-0|pages=1025–1031|edition=10|editor=Andrew N.

It only considered definitive treatment for patients with significant [[Comorbidity|comorbidities]] that contraindicate surgical management.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== External fixators ===
[[External fixation|External fixators]] can be used to prevent further damage to the leg until the patient is stable enough for surgery.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is most commonly used as a temporary measure. However, for some select cases it may be used as an alternative to intramedullary nailing for definitive treatment.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uptodate.com/contents/midshaft-femur-fractures-in-adults?source=search_result&amp;search=femur%20fracture&amp;selectedTitle=1~142#H12|title=Midshaft femur fractures in adults|website=www.uptodate.com|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kovar|first=Florian M.|last2=Jaindl|first2=Manuela|last3=Schuster|first3=Rupert|last4=Endler|first4=Georg|last5=Platzer|first5=Patrick|date=July 2013|title=Incidence and analysis of open fractures of the midshaft and distal femur|journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift|volume=125|issue=13-14|pages=396–401|doi=10.1007/s00508-013-0391-6|issn=1613-7671|pmid=23797531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intramedullary nailing ===
For femoral shaft fractures, reduction and intramedullary nailing is currently recommended.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The bone is re-aligned, then a metal rod is placed into the femoral bone marrow, and secured with nails at either end. This method offers less exposure, a 98%-99% union rate, lower infection rates (1%-2%) and less muscular scarring.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=el Moumni|first=M.|last2=Leenhouts|first2=P.

=== Rehabilitation ===
After surgery, the patient should be offered physiotherapy and try to walk as soon as possible, and then every day after that to maximise their chances of a good recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paterno|first=Mark V.|last2=Archdeacon|first2=Michael T.|date=May 2009|title=Is there a standard rehabilitation protocol after femoral intramedullary nailing?|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma|volume=23|issue=5 Suppl|pages=S39–46|doi=10.1097/BOT.0b013e31819f27c2|issn=1531-2291|pmid=19390375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
These fractures can take at least 4–6 months to heal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://patient.info/doctor/femoral-fractures#nav-1|title=Femoral Fractures. Information about Femur fractures. Patient {{!}} Patient|website=Patient|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since femoral shaft fractures are associated with violent trauma, there are many adverse outcomes, including [[fat embolism]], [[Acute respiratory distress syndrome|acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)]], multisystem organ failure, and shock associated with severe blood loss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Open fractures can result in infection, osteomyelitis, and sepsis.

== Epidemiology ==
Femoral shaft fractures occur in a bimodal distribution, whereby they are most commonly seen in males age 15-24 (due to high energy trauma) and females aged 75 or older (pathologic fractures due to osteoporosis, low-energy falls).&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/960851324|title=Handbook of fractures|last=1967-|first=Egol, Kenneth A.,|date=2015|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health|others=Koval, Kenneth J., Zuckerman, Joseph D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8732">The '''Five laws of [[library science]]''' is a theory proposed by [[S. R. Ranganathan]] in 1931       detailing the principles of operating a [[library]] system. Many [[librarian]]s worldwide accept them as the foundations of their philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, Wallace, Jitka Hurych, Wanda Dole, and Joanna Wall. "Ethical Values of Information and Library Professionals – An Expanded Analysis." ''International Information &amp; Library Review 32'' (3/4) 2000: 485–506.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin"&gt;Rubin, Richard E.  ''Foundations of Library and Information Science''. 2nd ed. New York: Neal-Schuman Publishers.  2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws are:
#Books are for use.
#Every person his or her book. 
#Every book its reader.
#Save the time of the reader.
#The library is a growing organism.

== Overview ==

===First Law: Books are for use===

The first law constitutes the basis for the library services. Dr. Ranganathan observed that books were often chained to prevent their removal and that the emphasis was on storage and preservation rather than use. He did not reject the notion that preservation and storage were important, but he asserted that the purpose of such activities was to promote use. Without user access to materials, there is little value in these items. By emphasizing use, Dr. Ranganathan refocused the attention of the field to access-related issues, such as the library's location, loan policies, hours and days of operation, as well as the quality of staffing and mundane matters like library furniture, temperature control and lighting. &lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;

The first law of library science "'''books are for use'''" means that books in libraries are not meant to be shut away from its users.

===Second Law: Every person his or her book===
&lt;blockquote&gt;This law suggests that every member of the community should be able to obtain materials needed. Dr. Ranganathan felt that all individuals from all social environments were entitled to library service, and that the basis of library use was education, to which all were entitled. These entitlements were not without some important obligations for both libraries/librarians and library patrons. Librarians should have excellent first-hand knowledge of the people to be served. Collections should meet the special interests of the community, and libraries should promote and advertise their services extensively to attract a wide range of readers. &lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The second law of library science "every person his or her book" means that librarians serve a wide collection of patrons, acquire literature to fit a vast collection of needs, do not judge what specific patrons choose to read. Everyone has different tastes and differences and librarians should respect that.

===Third Law: Every book its reader===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This principle is closely related to the second law, but it focuses on the item itself, suggesting that each item in a library has an individual or individuals who would find that item useful. Dr. Ranganathan argued that the library could devise many methods to ensure that each item finds its appropriate reader. One method involved the basic rules for access to the collection, most notably the need for open shelving.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The third law of library science "every book its reader" means a library's books have a place in the library even if a smaller demographic might choose to read it.

===Fourth Law: Save the time of the reader===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This law is a recognition that part of the excellence of library service is its ability to meet the needs of the library user efficiently. To this end, Dr. Ranganathan recommended the use of appropriate business methods to improve library management. He observed that centralizing the library collection in one location provided distinct advantages. He also noted that excellent staff would not only include those who possess strong reference skills, but also strong technical skills in cataloging, cross-referencing, ordering, accessioning, and the circulation of materials.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fourth law of library science "save the time of the user" means that all patrons should be able to easily locate the material they desire quickly and efficiently.

===Fifth Law: The library is a growing organism===
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This law focused more on the need for internal change than on changes in the environment itself. Dr. Ranganathan argued that library organizations must accommodate growth in staff, the physical collection, and patron use. This involved allowing for growth in the physical building, reading areas, shelving, and in space for the catalog.&lt;ref name="Rubin"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The fifth law of library science "the library is a growing organism" means that a library should be a continually changing institution, never static in its outlook. Books, methods, and the physical library should be updated over time.

==Variants==

Librarian [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]] (past president of the [[American Library Association]], 2005–2006), and [[Walt Crawford]] recommended the following laws in addition to Ranganathan's five in ''Future Libraries: Dreams, Madness, and Realities'' [American Library Association, 1995], (p. 8) Gorman later repeated them in his small book, ''Our Singular Strengths'' [American Library Association, 1998].  B. Shadrach (Indian Public Library Movement, 2015) proposed an alternative to Ranganathan's five laws at the Indian Public Libraries Conference, 2015 in New Delhi.

#Libraries serve humanity.
#Respect all forms by which knowledge is communicated.
#Use technology intelligently to enhance service.
#Protect free access to knowledge.
#Honor the past and create the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five Laws of Library Science|url=http://librarysciencedegree.usc.edu/resources/infographics/dr-s-r-ranganathans-five-laws-of-library-science/|website=University of Southern California|accessdate=22 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, librarian Alireza Noruzi recommended applying Ranganathan's laws to the Web in his paper, "Application of Ranganathan's Laws to the Web":

#Web resources are for use.
#Every user has his or her web resource.
#Every web resource its user.
#Save the time of the user.
#The Web is a growing organism.&lt;ref&gt;Noruzi, Alireza (2004). "Application of Ranganathan's Laws to the Web." [[Webology]], 1(2), Article 8. Available at: [http://www.webology.org/2004/v1n2/a8.html http://www.webology.org/2004/v1n2/a8.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, librarian Carol Simpson recommended that editing be done to Ranganathan's law due to media richness. The following were:

#Media are for use.
#Every patron his information.
#Every medium its user.
#Save the time of the patron.
#The library is a growing organism.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, Carol. "Five Laws". Library Media Connection 26 no7 6 Ap/My 2008. Available at: [http://www.carolsimpson.com/5laws.pdf http://www.carolsimpson.com/5laws.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015,B. Shadrach proposed an alternative set of laws adapted from Dr S R Ranganathan:

#Knowledge is for use in ‘all’ forms
#Every citizen has the right to access ‘all’ knowledge in 'all' forms
#Every piece of knowledge is for access by ‘all’ without discrimination of any kind
#Save the time of ‘all’ of the knowledge seekers
#A library or a knowledge system is one that evolves with time to achieve all of the above laws

In 2016 Dr Achala Munigal  recommended that editing be done to Ranganathan's law due to introduction of Social Tools and their applications in Libraries

# Social Media is for use – increasingly in libraries by librarians
# Every user his/her Social Tool
# Every Social Tool its user
# Save time of user by providing information he/she seeks using the social tool he/she is familiar with.
# Social Media is a growing organism. With various tools and apps being introduced every day. Libraries are not brick and stone anymore. They serve members and non-members alike in terms of non-traditional library services; irrespective of space and time.&lt;ref name="Grandhalaya Sarvasvam"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Munigal|first1=Achala|editor1-last=Ravi|editor1-first=Sharada|title=124th Jayanthi Sandharbanga: Grandhalaya Tapsvi Ranganathanku Niwali|journal=Granthalaya Sarvasvam|date=August 2016|pages=4-7|publisher=Andhra Pradesh Library Association|location=Vijayawada|language=Telugu|issn=0972-8104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Charlie-gibbs-full-extent.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Bathymetry map showing the full extent of the Charlie-Gibbs fracture zone.]]

A '''fracture zone''' is a linear oceanic feature—often hundreds, even thousands of kilometers long—resulting from the action of offset [[mid-ocean ridge]] axis segments. They are a consequence of [[plate tectonics]].  Lithospheric plates on either side of an active [[transform fault]] move in opposite directions; here, [[strike-slip]] activity occurs.  Fracture zones extend past the transform faults, away from the ridge axis; seismically inactive (because both plate segments are moving in the same direction), they display evidence of past transform fault activity, primarily in the different ages of the crust on opposite sides of the zone.

In actual usage, many transform faults aligned with fracture zones are often loosely referred to as "fracture zones" although technically, they are not.

==Structure and formation==
[[File:Fracture Zone - bstern3.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Oceanic crust age differences and ridge-ridge transform faulting associated with offset mid-ocean ridge segments lead to the formation of fracture zones.]]

Mid-ocean ridges are divergent plate boundaries. As the plates on either side of an offset mid-ocean ridge move, a transform fault forms at the offset between the two ridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandwell|first1=D.T.|last2=Smith|first2=W.H.F.|title=Exploring the Ocean Basins With Satellite Altimeter Data|url=http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/image/images/predict/images_predict.txt|publisher=NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center &amp; World Data Center A for Marine Geology &amp; Geophysics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fracture zones and the transform faults that form them are separate but related features. Transform faults are plate boundaries, meaning that on either side of the fault is a different plate. In contrast, outside of the ridge-ridge transform fault, the crust on both sides belongs to the same plate, and there is no relative motion along the junction.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Oceanic Transform Faults and Fracture Zones |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~vjd1/MOR_transforms.htm|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The fracture zone is thus the junction between oceanic crustal regions of different ages.  Because younger crust is generally higher due to increased thermal buoyancy, the fracture zone is characterized by an offset in elevation with an intervening canyon that may be topographically distinct for hundreds or thousands of kilometers on the sea floor.

==Geologic importance==
As many areas of the ocean floor, particularly the Atlantic Ocean, are currently inactive, it can be difficult to determine past plate motion. However, by observing the fracture zones, one can determine both the direction and rate of past plate motion. This is found by observing the patterns of magnetic striping on the ocean floor (a result of the reversals of Earth's magnetic field over time). By measuring the offset in the magnetic striping, one can then determine the rate of past plate motions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Understanding Plate Motions|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/dynamic/understanding.html|publisher=U.S. Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar method, one can use the relative ages of the seafloor on either side of a fracture zone to determine the rate of past plate motions. By comparing how offset similarly aged seafloor is, one can determine how quickly the plate has moved.&lt;ref name="Columbia" /&gt;

==Examples of fracture zones==
{{main article|List of fracture zones}}

===Blanco Fracture Zone===
[[Image:Blanco Fracture Zone.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|U.S.G.S. Blanco Fracture Zone regions image]]

The [[Blanco Fracture Zone]] is a fracture zone running between the [[Juan de Fuca Ridge]] and the [[Gorda Ridge]]. The dominating feature of the fracture zone is the 150&amp;nbsp;km long Blanco Ridge, which is a high-angle, right-lateral [[strike slip fault]] with some component of [[dip-slip fault]]ing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Recent tectonics of the Blanco Ridge, eastern blanco transform fault zone|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u867130803k712tw/|first=R.

A.|last6=Koski|year=2000|journal=Marine Geophysical Researches|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|volume=21|issue=5|pages=423–450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone===
The [[Charlie-Gibbs Fracture Zone]] consists of two fracture zones in the North Atlantic that extend for over 2000&amp;nbsp;km. These fracture zones displace the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] a total of 350&amp;nbsp;km to the west. The section of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the two fracture zones is seismically active.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Lilwall | first1 = R. C. | last2 = Kirk | first2 = R.

===Mendocino Fracture Zone===
The [[Mendocino Fracture Zone]] extends for over 4,000&amp;nbsp;km off the coast of California and separates the [[Pacific Plate]] and [[Gorda Plate]]. The bathymetric depths on the north side of the fracture zone are 800 to 1,200&amp;nbsp;m shallower than to the south, suggesting the seafloor north of the ridge to be younger. Geologic evidence backs this up, as rocks were found to be 23 to 27&amp;nbsp;million years younger north of the ridge than to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mendocino Fracture Zone|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/374855/Mendocino-Fracture-Zone|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanche Fracture Zone===
[[Image:Romanche Trench.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Romanche Trench]]

Also known as the [[Romanche Trench]], this fracture zone separates the [[North Atlantic]] and [[South Atlantic Ocean]]s. The trench reaches 7,758&amp;nbsp;m deep, is 300&amp;nbsp;km long, and has a width of 19&amp;nbsp;km. The fracture zone offsets the Mid-Atlantic Ridge by more than 640&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Romanche Gap|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/508426/Romanche-Gap|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sovanco Fracture Zone===
The [[Sovanco Fracture Zone]] is a dextral-slip transform fault running between the Juan de Fuca and [[Explorer Ridge]] in the [[North Pacific Ocean]]. The fracture zone is 125&amp;nbsp;km long and 15&amp;nbsp;km wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cowan|first1=Darrel S.|last2=Botros|first2=Mona|last3=Johnson|first3=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3560">'''Green Hour''' is a core concept of the U.S. [[National Wildlife Federation]]'s '''Be Out There''' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Be Out There" program website]&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was created in response to a growing disconnect between nature and children, a condition dubbed [[nature deficit disorder]] by Richard Louv&lt;ref&gt;[http://richardlouv.com/ Author Richard Louv's website]&lt;/ref&gt; in his book ''[[Last Child in the Woods]]''. One of the primary symptoms of nature deficit disorder, according to Louv, is the replacement of outdoor activities (or "green time") with "screen time"—hours that are spent in front of computers, televisions and other electronic devices.

The [[National Wildlife Federation]] recommends that parents give their kids a "Green Hour" every day, a time for unstructured play and interaction with the natural world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/Be-Out-There/Why-Be-Out-There.aspx NWF's "Why Be Out There" web page]&lt;/ref&gt; This is part of NWF's strategy called [[Reversing Nature Deficit]]. The Green Hour program teaches that unstructured play can take place in a garden, a backyard, a nearby park, or any place that provides safe and accessible green spaces where children can learn and play.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/360/story/551908.html Miami Herald article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Hour's web site was launched by NWF's Education department in March 2007 as a resource for parents and caregivers, attempting to provide the information, inspiration, tools and community needed to make "green hours" part of every family's daily routine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/18/AR2007061801808_pf.html Washington Post article about Green Hour]&lt;/ref&gt; Green Hour cites a Kaiser Family Foundation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kff.org/ Kaiser Family Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; study which found the average American child spends 44 hours per week-more than six hours per day-staring at some kind of electronic screen. Studies have also linked excessive television viewing to obesity, violence, and even lower intelligence in kids.

Each week, Green Hour publishes a new issue of its Discovery Journal with a new outdoor theme. The Journal has several tabs: "Book Nook," which provides reading for kids of different ages, "Make &amp; Do," which provides outdoor activities and crafts and "Did You Know." which provides facts about nature.

The Green Hour blog&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/blog NWF's Green Hour Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; presents different perspectives on the rise in children's "screen-time" and practical ways of reconnecting youth to nature. The Green Hour Community Corner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenhour.org/content/community NWF's Green Hour Community Corner]&lt;/ref&gt; allow users to sign up as members and talk with other parents and caregivers. NatureFind&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/NatureFind.aspx NWF's Green Hour NatureFind]&lt;/ref&gt; is a feature on the site that allows users to submit their zip code and find all the parks, trails and other natural areas nearby.

'''Horology''' ("the study of time", related to [[Latin]] ''horologium'' from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|ὡρολόγιον}}, "instrument for telling the hour", from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ὥρα|ὥρα]]}} ''hṓra'' "hour; time" and -o- [[interfix]] and suffix ''-logy'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=horology&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=horology |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|w(rolo/gion|ὡρολόγιον}}, {{LSJ|w(/ra2|ὥρα|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is the study of the measurement of [[time]]. [[Clocks]], [[watches]], [[clockwork]], [[sundial]]s, hourglasses, [[Water clock|clepsydras]], [[timer]]s, [[time recorder]]s, [[marine chronometer]]s and [[atomic clock]]s are all examples of [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s used to measure [[time]].  In current usage, horology refers mainly to the study of mechanical time-keeping devices, while [[chronometry]] more broadly includes electronic devices that have largely supplanted mechanical clocks for the best accuracy and precision in time-keeping.

People interested in horology are called ''horologists''. That term is used both by people who deal professionally with timekeeping apparatus (watchmakers, clockmakers), as well as [[aficionados]] and scholars of horology.  Horology and horologists have numerous organizations, both professional associations and more scholarly societies. The largest horological membership organisation globally is the NAWCC, the National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors, which is USA based, but also has local chapters elsewhere.

== Museums and libraries ==
[[File:RelojUniversal.JPG|thumb|"Universal Clock" at the Clock Museum in [[Zacatlán]], [[Sierra Norte de Puebla|Puebla]], [[Mexico]]]]

There are many horology museums and several specialized libraries devoted to the subject. One example is the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]], which is also the source of the [[Prime Meridian]] ([[longitude]] 0° 0' 0"), and the home of the first marine timekeepers accurate enough to determine longitude (made by [[John Harrison]]). Other horological museums in the London area include the [[Clockmakers' Museum]], which re-opened at the Science Museum in October 2015, the horological collections at the [[British Museum]], the [[Science Museum (London)]], and the [[Wallace Collection]].

One of the more comprehensive museums dedicated to horology is the [[Musée international d'horlogerie]] in [[La Chaux-de-fonds|La Chaux-de-Fonds]] (Switzerland). The [[Musée d'Horlogerie du Locle]] is smaller but located nearby. One of the better horological museums in Germany is the [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum]] in [[Furtwangen im Schwarzwald]], in the [[Black Forest]]. The two leading specialised horological museums in North America are the [[National Watch and Clock Museum]] in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania]] and the [[American Clock and Watch Museum]] in [[Bristol, Connecticut]].

The eastern French city of [[Besançon]] has the Musée du Temps (Museum of Time) in the historic Palais Grenvelle.

An example of a museum devoted to one particular type of clock is the [[Cuckooland Museum]] in the UK, which hosts the world's largest collection of antique [[cuckoo clock|cuckoo clocks]].

One of the most comprehensive horological libraries open to the public is the [[National Watch and Clock Library]] in [[Columbia, Pennsylvania]]. Other good horological libraries providing public access are at the [[Musée international d'horlogerie]] in Switzerland, at the [[Deutsches Uhrenmuseum]] in Germany, and at the [[Guildhall Library]] in [[London]].

Another museum dedicated to clocks is the [[Willard House and Clock Museum]] in [[Grafton, Massachusetts]].

== Organizations ==
Notable scholarly horological organizations include:
* [[American Watchmakers-Clockmakers Institute]] – AWCI (United States of America)
* [[Antiquarian Horological Society]] – AHS (United Kingdom)
* [[British Horological Institute]] – BHI (United Kingdom)
* [[Chronometrophilia]] (Switzerland)

'''Inductive programming''' ('''IP''') is a special area of [[automatic programming]], covering research from [[artificial intelligence]] and [[Computer programming|programming]], which addresses [[machine learning|learning]] of typically [[declarative programming|declarative]] ([[logic programming|logic]] or [[functional programming|functional]]) and often [[recursion|recursive]] programs from incomplete specifications, such as input/output examples or constraints.

Depending on the programming language used, there are several kinds of inductive programming. '''Inductive functional programming''', which uses functional programming languages such as [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] or [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], and most especially [[inductive logic programming]], which uses logic programming languages such as [[Prolog]] and other logical representations  such as [[description logics]], have been more prominent, but other (programming) language paradigms have also been used, such as [[constraint programming]] or [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]].

== Definition ==

Inductive programming incorporates all approaches which are concerned with learning programs or algorithms from incomplete ([[formal specification|formal]]) specifications. Possible inputs in an IP system are a set of training inputs and corresponding outputs or an output evaluation function, describing the desired behavior of the intended program, [[Tracing (software)|traces]] or action sequences which describe the process of calculating specific outputs, [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] for the program to be induced concerning its time efficiency or its complexity, various kinds of background knowledge such as standard [[data type]]s, predefined functions to be used, program schemes or templates describing the data flow of the intended program, heuristics for guiding the search for a solution or other biases.

Output of an IP system is a program in some arbitrary programming language containing conditionals and loop or recursive control structures, or any other kind of [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] [[Knowledge representation and reasoning|representation]] language.

In many applications the output program must be correct with respect to the examples and partial specification,  and this leads to the consideration of inductive programming as a special area inside automatic programming or [[program synthesis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.W.|last1=Biermann|title=Automatic programming|editor1-first=S.C.|editor1-last=Shapiro|journal=Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence|pages=18–35|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=C.|last1=Rich|first2=R.C.|last2=Waters|title=Approaches to automatic programming|editor1-first=M.C.|editor1-last=Yovits|journal=Advances in Computers|volume=37|year=1993|url=http://www.merl.com/publications/docs/TR92-04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; usually opposed to 'deductive' program synthesis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=M.L.|editor1-last=Lowry|editor2-first=R.D.|editor2-last=McCarthy|title=Automatic software design|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Z.|last1=Manna|first2=R.|last2=Waldinger|title=Fundamentals of deductive program synthesis|journal=IEEE Trans Softw Eng|volume=18 | issue = 8|pages=674–704|year=1992|doi=10.1109/32.153379|citeseerx=10.1.1.51.817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=P.|last1=Flener|title=Achievements and prospects of program synthesis|editor1-first=A.|editor1-last=Kakas|editor2-first=F.|editor2-last=Sadri|journal=Computational Logic: Logic Programming and Beyond; Essays in Honour of Robert A. Kowalski|volume=LNAI 2407|pages=310–346|year=2002|doi=10.1007/3-540-45628-7_13|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-43959-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the specification is usually complete.

In other cases, inductive programming is seen as a more general area where any declarative programming or representation language can be used and we may even have some degree of error in the examples, as in general [[machine learning]], the more specific area of [[structure mining]] or the area of [[symbolic artificial intelligence]]. A distinctive feature is the number of examples or partial specification needed. Typically, inductive programming techniques can learn from just a few examples.

The diversity of inductive programming usually comes from the applications and the languages that are used: apart from logic programming and functional programming, other programming paradigms and representation languages have been used or suggested in inductive programming, such as [[functional logic programming]], [[constraint programming]], [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]], [[abductive logic programming]], [[modal logic]], [[action language]]s, agent languages and many types of [[imperative languages]].

== History ==

Research on the inductive synthesis of recursive functional programs started in the early 1970s and was brought onto firm theoretical foundations with the seminal THESIS system of Summers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=P.D.|last1=Summers|title=A methodology for LISP program construction from examples|journal=J ACM|volume=24 | issue = 1|pages=161–175|year=1977|doi=10.1145/321992.322002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and work of Biermann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=A.W.|last1=Biermann|title=The inference of regular LISP programs from examples|journal=IEEE Trans Syst Man Cybern|volume=8 | issue = 8|pages=585–600|year=1978|doi=10.1109/tsmc.1978.4310035}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These approaches were split into two phases: first, input-output examples are transformed into non-recursive programs (traces) using a small set of basic operators; second, regularities in the traces are searched for and used to fold them into a recursive program.  The main results until the mid 1980s are surveyed by Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=D.R.|last1=Smith|title=The synthesis of LISP programs from examples: a survey|editor1-first=A.W.|editor1-last=Biermann|editor2-first=G.|editor2-last=Guiho|journal=Automatic Program Construction Techniques|pages=307–324|year=1984|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/239059541}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limited progress with respect to the range of programs that could be synthesized, research activities decreased significantly in the next decade.

The advent of logic programming brought a new elan but also a new direction in the early 1980s, especially due to the MIS system of Shapiro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=E.Y.|last1=Shapiro|title=Algorithmic program debugging|publisher=The MIT Press|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually spawning the new field of inductive logic programming (ILP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Muggleton | first1 = S. | title = Inductive logic programming | doi = 10.1007/BF03037089 | journal = New Generation Computing | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 295–318 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.329.5312 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The early works of Plotkin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gordon D.|last1=Plotkin|title=A Note on Inductive Generalization|editor1-first=B.|editor1-last=Meltzer|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Michie|journal=Machine Intelligence|volume=5|pages=153–163|year=1970|url=http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/MI5_note_ind_gen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Gordon D.|last1=Plotkin|title=A Further Note on Inductive Generalization|editor1-first=B.|editor1-last=Meltzer|editor2-first=D.|editor2-last=Michie|journal=Machine Intelligence|volume=6|pages=101–124|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his "''relative least general generalization (rlgg)''", had an enormous impact in inductive logic programming. Most of ILP work addresses a wider class of problems, as the focus is not only on recursive logic programs but on machine learning of symbolic hypotheses from logical representations. However, there were some encouraging results on learning recursive Prolog programs such as quicksort from examples together with suitable background knowledge, for example with GOLEM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=S.H.|last1=Muggleton|first2=C.|last2=Feng|title=Efficient induction of logic programs|journal=Proceedings of the Workshop on Algorithmic Learning Theory|volume=6|pages=368–381|year=1990|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/6a66/9636e0ada62a0fb444e95435e24fdbdf4dbd.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; But again, after initial success, the community got disappointed by limited progress about the induction of recursive programs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Here again, functional programs are learned from sets of positive examples together with an output evaluation (fitness) function which specifies the desired input/output behavior of the program to be learned.

The early work in [[grammar induction]] (also known as grammatical inference) is related to inductive programming, as rewriting systems or logic programs can be used to represent production rules. In fact, early works in inductive inference considered grammar induction and Lisp program inference as basically the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the language learning problem was addressed by the inductive programming community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Stephen|last1=Muggleton|title=Inductive Logic Programming: Issues, Results and the Challenge of Learning Language in Logic|journal=Artificial Intelligence|volume=114|pages=283–296|year=1999|doi=10.1016/s0004-3702(99)00067-3}}; here: Sect.2.1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In the recent years, the classical approaches have been resumed and advanced with great success. Therefore, the synthesis problem has been reformulated on the background of constructor-based term rewriting systems taking into account modern techniques of functional programming, as well as moderate use of search-based strategies and usage of background knowledge as well as automatic invention of subprograms. Many new and successful applications have recently appeared beyond program synthesis, most especially in the area of data manipulation, programming by example and cognitive modelling (see below).

Other ideas have also been explored with the common characteristic of using declarative languages for the representation of hypotheses. For instance, the use of higher-order features, schemes or structured distances have been advocated for a better handling of recursive data types and structures;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; abstraction has also been explored as a more powerful approach to [[cumulative learning]] and function invention.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

One powerful paradigm that has been recently used for the representation of hypotheses in inductive programming (generally in the form of [[generative model]]s) is [[probabilistic programming language|probabilistic programming]] (and related paradigms, such as stochastic logic programs and Bayesian logic programming).&lt;ref&gt;

== Application areas ==

The [http://www.cogsys.wiai.uni-bamberg.de/aaip05/objectives.html first workshop on Approaches and Applications of Inductive Programming (AAIP) ] held in conjunction with [[ICML]] 2005 identified all applications where "learning of programs or recursive rules are called for, [...] first in the domain of software engineering where structural learning, software assistants and software agents can help to relieve programmers from routine tasks, give programming support for end users, or support of novice programmers and programming tutor systems. Further areas of application are language learning, learning recursive control rules for AI-planning, learning recursive concepts in web-mining or for data-format transformations".

Since then, these and many other areas have shown to be successful application niches for inductive programming, such as [[End-user development|end-user programming]],&lt;ref&gt;

===Contrast to technical colleges===
Conversely, schools dubbed "technical colleges" or "technical institutes" generally provide post-secondary training in technical and mechanical fields focusing on training vocational skills primarily at a [[community college]] level -- parallel and sometimes equivalent to the first two years at a [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]]-granting institution.  The academic level of these schools varies by course of study; some courses are geared toward immediate employment in a trade, while others are designed to transfer into a four-year program.  Some of these technical institutes are for-profit organizations (such as [[ITT Technical Institute]]) compared to most other non-profit educational institutes.

In Congo folklore, the '''''jba fofi''''' or '''''j'ba fofi''''' (Baka: "giant spider"), also known as the '''Congolese giant spider''', is a creature said to exist in the [[Congo Basin|Congo]], possibly representing a new species of [[arachnid]]. Popular interest in the creature was sparked by the program [[Monsterquest]] in 2008. Although best known for sightings within Africa, purported giant spiders have been reported worldwide.

==Name==
The creature is most famously known as the ''jba fofi'', the name that [[Baka people (Congo and South Sudan)|Baka]] tribespeople in the Congo have called the giant arachnids that reportedly reside by their dwellings. The name means "great spider" in their language.&lt;ref name="Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[William J. Gibbons]] | title=Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin |pages=158–159| publisher=Coachwhip Publications| year=2010 | isbn=1-61646-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Although giant spider sightings have taken place since the late 19th century,{{cn|date=July 2018}} the recent surge in interest began with the episode on Monsterquest followed by the publication of William Gibbon's book. The researcher was familiar with the sighting by Reginald Lloyd of an enormous spider in Zimbabwe in 1938,{{cn|date=July 2018}} and while speaking to Baka natives about the [[mokele-mbembe]] he asked them if they had ever seen such a creature. They were familiar with a similar beast that they called the ''jba fofi'', and gave a like description.

==Description and habitat==
The [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] said that the ''jba fofi'' of the Congo would spin a web between two trees which they utilized to capture birds, duiker, and other small game animals. Their eggs were the size of peanuts, and juveniles were yellowish with purple abdomens. When they matured they would turn brown, and were four to five feet in length. The Baka said that they were strong enough to overpower humans, and that they would kill a ''jba fofi'' if it made its nest too close to the village. The spiders are described by [[Baka people (Cameroon and Gabon)|Baka]] natives as weaving lairs made of leaves and spinning a circular web between two trees. The Baka told Gibbons that these spiders are now rare due to dwindling habitat. Descriptions of giant spider sightings elsewhere bear a similar resemblance, with some variance in color.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

==Sightings==

===1890s: Uganda===
Missionary Arthur Simes from England was on an expedition to a village near Lake Nyasa when several of his porters became ensnared by a huge web that had been strung up in the forest. They were then attacked by several large spiders that had a leg span of four feet and were bitten.&lt;ref&gt;https://thecuriousfortean.com/2017/10/23/the-jba-fofi-giant-spider-of-the-congo/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thepresencebook.com/jba-fofi/&lt;/ref&gt;

===1938: DR Congo===
Reginald and Margurite Lloyd were driving a Ford truck through a trail when they reportedly spotted a spider as large as a large jungle cat. It resembled a light brown tarantula, but had an estimated leg-span of 5 feet. After briefly pausing in front of their vehicle it scurried off into the jungle. Liam Christopher and his brother Jenner Edwards and their daughters Sally and Maurgurite Lloyd, would later relate this story in the 1990s to William Gibbons.&lt;ref name="Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[William J. Gibbons]] | title=Mokele-Mbembe Mystery Beast of the Congo Basin |pages=158–159| publisher=Coachwhip Publications| year=2010 | isbn=1-61646-010-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.history.com/shows/monsterquest/season-2/episode-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===1942: Papua, New Guinea===
During the [[Kokoda Track Campaign]], an Australian soldier at the Kokoda Trail said that he encountered a puppy-sized spider inhabiting a 30 foot sized web. It was described as being black with a bulky body, as well as hairy like a tarantula.&lt;ref name="Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology - Volume 1"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[ George M. Eberhart]] | title=Mysterious Creatures: A Guide to Cryptozoology - Volume 1 |pages=204| publisher=cfz| year=2013 | isbn=978-1909488076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011: Amazon===
British cinematographer [[Richard Terry (cinematographer)|Richard Terry]] travelled to the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] to investigate reports of giant spiders in the June 13th episode of ''[[Man v. Monster]]''. At a remote village, he was informed that giant spiders lived in holes deep within the jungle. These spiders measured roughly four feet in diameter.&lt;ref name="Listverse.com's Epic Book of Mind-Boggling Lists: Unbelievable Facts and Astounding Trivia on Movies, Music, Crime, Celebrities, History, and More"&gt;{{cite book | authors=[[Jamie Frater]] | title=Listverse.com's Epic Book of Mind-Boggling Lists: Unbelievable Facts and Astounding Trivia on Movies, Music, Crime, Celebrities, History, and More |pages=138| publisher=Ulysses Press| year=2014 | isbn=9781612432977}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hoaxes==
In 2015 the photo of a purported 6-foot wide "giant Hawaiian cane spider" was published on [[Facebook]]. The image was later proven to be a digital forgery. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/false-giant-hawaiian-cane-spider/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
There is speculation that sightings - either the ''jba fofi'' or giant spiders elsewhere are actually misidentifications of [[coconut crabs]], which is the largest terrestrial crab and can grow to over 3 feet. An argument against the existence of the ''jba fofi'' is the fact that spiders have a simple respiratory system that limits the size that they can achieve, with the [[Goliath birdeater]] representing the highest end of the growth spectrum for an arachnid.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scienceworld.ca/why-arent-spiders-bigger&lt;/ref&gt; Another contrary viewpoint is that a spider's exoskeleton could not support the weight generated by a creature the size of the ''jba fofi''.&lt;ref&gt;http://content.journal-news.net/life/home-and-garden/2013/10/stories-about-giant-spiders-have-no-legs/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Samuel Slater''' (born 1850 in [[Calcutta]]; died 1911 in [[Ealing]]) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] professor of [[Civil Engineering]] at the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]], [[Calcutta]], and later principal of the [[Indian Institute of Engineering Science and Technology, Shibpur|Engineering College]] in [[Sibpur]].&lt;ref&gt;Museum of the History of Science: [https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/narratives/?irn=10134&amp;index=1 ''Narratives: J.S. Slater.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
John Samuel Slater was educated at Pocklington Grammar School, [[Yorks]], and Bishop Cotton School, [[Simla]]. He graduated in 1870 at the Thomason Civil Engineering College, [[Burki]], obtaining the gold medal for mathematics. The same year he was appointed to the Public Works Department of the Government of India and served at [[Dera Ghazi Khan]] and other locations in the [[Punjab]].&lt;ref name="RAS"&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1912MNRAS..72R.252. ''Obituary Notices: Fellows: Slater, John Samuel.''] In: Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Vol. 72, p. 252-253. {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4104539?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''Miscellaneous Notes: J. S. Slater.''] In: Bulletin of Miscellaneous Information (Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew), Vol. 1912, No. 1 (1912), pp. 56-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1875 he was appointed Professor of Engineering at the Presidency College, Calcutta, and in 1880, when the Engineering Department of that College was formed into an independent residential Engineering College at Sibpur, he took a leading part in its organisation, became one of the original members of its staff, and was eventually appointed Principal in 1891. He inaugurated a scheme of modern education for the District Schools of [[Bengal]] and [[Assam]], and was responsible for the reorganisation of the technical schools of those two provinces. In 1897 he was for some months Inspector of Schools of the [[Rajshahi Division]], and in 1901 officiated as head of the Educational Department of Bengal. In 1904 he was incapacitated by a serious illness which necessitated his retirement from India.&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt; 

He was responsible for teaching astronomy to the students of the Engineering College, and was always keenly interested in that science.&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt; In 1891, while on leave, he devised and patented an armillary sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of the History of Science: [https://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/collections/imu-search-page/narratives/?irn=10134&amp;index=2 ''Narratives: Slater's 'improved' armillary sphere.'']&lt;/ref&gt; He presented this to the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of the History of Science: [http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/object/inv/53213 ''Record Details: Slater's Armillary Sphere, English, c. 1890.'']&lt;/ref&gt; which he used for instructional purposes.&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt;  

After his retirement he devoted himself enthusiastically to an investigation of the pollen of plants, and prepared by micro-photography a very large number of enlarged photographs of pollen grains. The value of his work in this direction was recognised by the botanical authorities at [[Kew]].&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt;

== Family ==

He married in 1873 Jessie Frances, by whom he had a son and a daughter.&lt;ref name="RAS"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5254">In theoretical physics, the '''Jordan map''', often also called the '''Jordan–Schwinger map''' is a map from matrices {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to bilinear expressions of quantum oscillators which expedites computation of  representations of [[Lie Algebra]]s occurring in physics.  It was introduced by [[Pascual Jordan]] in 1935&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Pascual (1935).  "Der Zusammenhang der symmetrischen und linearen Gruppen und das Mehrkörperproblem",  ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' '''94''', Issue 7-8, 531-535&lt;/ref&gt; and was utilized by [[Julian Schwinger]]&lt;ref&gt;Schwinger, J. (1952). [http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0111&amp;numPages=92&amp;fp=N "On Angular Momentum"], Unpublished Report, Harvard University, Nuclear Development Associates, Inc., [[United States Department of Energy]] (through predecessor agency the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]]),  Report Number  NYO-3071 (January 26, 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;  in 1952 to re-work out the theory of [[Angular momentum#Angular momentum in quantum mechanics|quantum angular momentum]] efficiently, given that map’s ease of organizing the (symmetric) [[Lie algebra representation|representations]] of  [[Special unitary group#n .3D 2|su(2)]] in [[Fock space]].

The map utilizes several [[Creation and annihilation operators#Creation and annihilation operators in quantum field theories|creation and annihilation operators]]  
&lt;math&gt;a^\dagger_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a^{\,}_i&lt;/math&gt; of routine use in [[Quantum field theory|quantum field theories]] and [[many-body problem]]s, each pair representing a [[quantum harmonic oscillator]].
The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators in a multiple-[[boson]] system are,
: &lt;math&gt;[a^{\,}_i, a^\dagger_j] \equiv a^{\,}_i a^\dagger_j - a^\dagger_ja^{\,}_i = \delta_{i j},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;[a^\dagger_i, a^\dagger_j] = [a^{\,}_i, a^{\,}_j] = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;[\ \ , \ \ ]&lt;/math&gt; is the [[commutator]] and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{i j}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]].

These operators change the eigenvalues of the [[number operator]],
: &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_i n_i = \sum_i a^\dagger_i a^{\,}_i&lt;/math&gt;,
by one, as for [[Quantum harmonic oscillator#N-dimensional harmonic oscillator|multidimensional  quantum  harmonic oscillators]].

The Jordan map from a set of matrices {{math|'''M'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;}} to Fock space bilinear operators {{math|''M''}},
:&lt;math&gt;{\mathbf M}  \qquad \longmapsto \qquad   M \equiv  \sum_{i,j}  a^\dagger_i  {\mathbf M}_{ij}    a_j  ~,&lt;/math&gt;  
is clearly a [[Lie Algebra]] isomorphism, i.e. the operators {{math|''M''}} satisfy the same commutation relations as  the matrices {{math|'''M'''}}.

For example,  the image of the  [[Pauli matrices]] of [[Special unitary group#n .3D 2|SU(2)]] in this map, 
:&lt;math&gt;{\vec  J} \equiv    {\mathbf  a}^\dagger \cdot\frac{ {\vec  \sigma } } {2} \cdot    {\mathbf a}^{\,}   ~,&lt;/math&gt;  
for two-vector '''''a'''''&lt;sup&gt;†&lt;/sup&gt;s, and '''''a'''''s satisfy the same commutation relations of SU(2) as well, and moreover, by reliance on the [[Pauli matrices#Completeness relation|completeness relation for Pauli matrices]], 
:&lt;math&gt;J^2\equiv {\vec  J} \cdot {\vec  J} = \frac{N}{2} \left ( \frac{N}{2}+1\right )~. &lt;/math&gt;

This is the starting point of Schwinger’s treatment of the theory of quantum angular momentum, predicated on the action of these operators on  Fock states built of arbitrary higher powers of such operators. For instance, acting on an (unnormalized) Fock eigenstate, 
:&lt;math&gt;J^2~   a^{\dagger k}_1  a^{\dagger n}_2  |0\rangle=   \frac{k+n}{2} \left ( \frac{k+n}{2}+1\right ) ~  a^{\dagger k}_1  a^{\dagger n}_2 |0\rangle ~,&lt;/math&gt; 
while 
:&lt;math&gt;J_z ~   a^{\dagger k}_1  a^{\dagger n}_2  |0\rangle=   \frac{1}{2} \left ( k-n\right ) ~  a^{\dagger k}_1  a^{\dagger n}_2 |0\rangle ~,&lt;/math&gt; 
so that, for {{math| ''j''{{=}}(''k+n'')/2,   &amp;nbsp;   ''m''{{=}}(''k−n'')/2}}, this is proportional to the eigenstate {{math|{{!}}''j,m''〉}}, &lt;ref&gt;Sakurai, J J  and Napolitano, J J  (2010), ''Modern Quantum Mechanics'', Pearson   {{isbn| 978-0805382914}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;|j,m\rangle= \frac{a_1^{\dagger ~k} a_2^{\dagger ~ n} }{\sqrt{k!~n!}}|0\rangle~  .&lt;/math&gt;
Observe &lt;math&gt;J_+=a_1^\dagger a_2&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;J_-=a_2^\dagger a_1  &lt;/math&gt;.

Antisymmetric representations of Lie algebras can further be accommodated by use of the fermionic operators  
&lt;math&gt;b^\dagger_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b^{\,}_i&lt;/math&gt;,  as also suggested by Jordan. For [[fermion]]s, the commutator is replaced by the [[anticommutator]] &lt;math&gt;\{\ \ , \ \ \}&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math&gt;\{b^{\,}_i, b^\dagger_j\} \equiv b^{\,}_i b^\dagger_j +b^\dagger_j b^{\,}_i = \delta_{i j},&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\{b^\dagger_i, b^\dagger_j\} = \{b^{\,}_i, b^{\,}_j\} = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, exchanging disjoint (i.e. &lt;math&gt;i \ne j&lt;/math&gt;) operators in a product of creation of annihilation operators will reverse the sign in fermion systems, but not in boson systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3215">'''Maximum entropy spectral estimation''' is a method of [[spectral density estimation]]. The goal is to improve the [[spectrum|spectral]] quality based on the [[principle of maximum entropy]]. The method is based on choosing the spectrum which corresponds to the most random or the most unpredictable time series whose [[autocorrelation]] function agrees with the known values. This assumption, which corresponds to the concept of maximum entropy as used in both [[statistical mechanics]] and [[information theory]], is maximally non-committal with regard to the unknown values of the autocorrelation function of the time series. It is simply the application of maximum entropy modeling to any type of spectrum and is used in all fields where data is presented in spectral form. The usefulness of the technique varies based on the source of the spectral data since it is dependent on the amount of assumed knowledge about the spectrum that can be applied to the model.

In maximum entropy modeling, probability distributions are created on the basis of that which is known, leading to a type of [[statistical inference]] about the missing information which is called the maximum entropy estimate. For example, in spectral analysis the expected peak shape is often known, but in a noisy spectrum the center of the peak may not be clear. In such a case, inputting the known information allows the maximum entropy model to derive a better estimate of the center of the peak, thus improving spectral accuracy.

==Method description==
The overall idea is that the maximum [[entropy rate]] [[stochastic process]] that satisfies the given constant autocorrelation and [[variance]] constraints, is a linear [[Gauss-Markov process]] with [[i.i.d.]] zero-mean, [[Gaussian function|Gaussian]] input.

The maximum entropy rate, [[strongly stationary]] [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; with [[autocorrelation]] sequence &lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(k), k = 0,1, \dots P&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the constraints:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{xx}(k) = \alpha_k&lt;/math&gt;

for arbitrary constants &lt;math&gt;\alpha_k&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;-th order, linear Markov chain of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;x_i = -\sum_{k=1}^P a_k x_{i-k} + y_i&lt;/math&gt;

where the &lt;math&gt;y_i&lt;/math&gt; are zero mean, [[i.i.d.]] and normally-distributed of finite variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma^2&lt;/math&gt;.

==Spectral estimation==
Given the &lt;math&gt;a_k&lt;/math&gt;, the square of the absolute value of the [[transfer function]] of the linear Markov chain model can be evaluated at any required frequency in order to find the [[power spectrum]] of &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboratory''' or '''NPOL''' is a [[laboratory]] of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO), under the [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]], [[India]]. It is situated in [[Thrikkakara]], [[Kochi]], [[Kerala]]. NPOL is responsible for the Research &amp; Development of sonar systems, technologies for underwater surveillance, study of ocean environment and underwater materials.&lt;ref name=ie27n&gt;{{cite news|title=DRDO gets it right when it’s unlike DRDO|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/drdo-gets-it-right-when-its-unlike-drdo/16843/0|accessdate=8 June 2013|newspaper=Indian Express|date=27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Indian Naval Physical Laboratory (INPL) was established in [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] by Indian Navy in 1952. It worked initially as a field laboratory for fleet support activities. It was merged with DRDO in 1958 and started working on underwater systems. INPL was rechristened as Naval Physical Oceanographic Laboratory (NPOL).

Till 1990, NPOL functioned from within the Naval Base in Kochi. In 1990, it moved into a new {{convert|60|acre|m2|sing=on}} campus at Thrikkakara, a suburb of Kochi. The new campus has a main technical complex and two residential complexes - SAGAR and VARUNA. The technical complex houses the main building, Abhinavam building and several test facilities including an acoustic tank. Besides the campus in Thrikkakara, NPOL has an offsite setup of underwater acoustic research facility at [[Idukki Dam|Idukki lake]], 100&amp;nbsp;km east of Kochi. Since 1995, NPOL has operated INS Sagardwani a 2000-ton Oceanographic research vessel used for oceanographic data collection.

==Areas of work==
NPOL is developing a technology called seabed arrays that will be laid over the seabed surface for ocean surveillance which will provide measurements and inform the control centre about the happenings underneath through satellite. DRDO is planning a dedicated satellite for the coastal surveillance system.

All the future inductions planned by the Indian navy are to be fitted with NPOL designed sonars. The  sonars under development are HUMSA NG (upgrade of the HUMSA sonar), the submarine sonars USHUS (for the Sindhugosh class) and PAYAL for the Arihant class.&lt;ref name=ie27n /&gt;

Underwater acoustics is another area where NPOL is looking at. The Physical Oceanographic conditions which will decide the propagation of the sound waves inside water is studied with the help of DRDO's Research Vessel INS Sagardhwani and in-house developed Ocean models. Different Sonar Range Prediction models are also developed by NPOL in the recent years which are used by Indian Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/13/stories/2007121355240500.htm|title=DRDO to develop unmanned underwater vehicles|author=|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=2008-02-07|newspaper=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2008/02/07/stories/2008020751830500.htm|title=DRDO plans satellite-based coastal surveillance system|author=M.

The '''Neil Gehrels ''Swift'' Observatory''', previously called the '''''Swift'' Gamma-Ray Burst Mission''', is a NASA [[space telescope]] designed to detect [[gamma-ray burst]]s (GRBs). It was launched on November 20, 2004, aboard a [[Delta II]] rocket. Headed by [[principal investigator]] [[Neil Gehrels]], NASA [[Goddard Space Flight Center]], the mission was developed in a joint partnership between Goddard and an international consortium from the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], and [[Italy]]. The mission is operated by [[Pennsylvania State University]] as part of NASA's [[Explorers program|Medium Explorers program]] (MIDEX).

==Overview==
[[File:Swift.ogv|thumb|left|Animation showing ''Swift'' moving into sunlight and past the [[Earth]] to end facing out into space]]

''Swift'' is a multi-[[wavelength]] [[space observatory]] dedicated to the study of [[gamma-ray burst]]s. Its three instruments work together to observe GRBs and their afterglows in the [[gamma-ray]], [[X-ray]], [[ultraviolet]], and [[optical]] wavebands.

Based on continuous scans of the area of the sky with one of the instrument's monitors, ''Swift'' uses [[momentum wheel]]s to autonomously slew into the direction of possible GRBs. The name "Swift" is not a mission-related acronym, but rather a reference to the instrument's rapid [[Slew (spacecraft)|slew]] capability, and the nimble [[swift|bird of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/swiftfaq.html#name |title=Swift Guest Investigator Program Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=J. D. |last=Myers |date=September 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of ''Swift''{{'s}} discoveries are transmitted to the ground and those data are available to other observatories which join ''Swift'' in observing the GRBs.

In the time between GRB events, ''Swift'' is available for other scientific investigations, and scientists from universities and other organizations can submit proposals for observations.

The Swift Mission Operation Center (MOC), where commanding of the satellite is performed, is located in [[State College, Pennsylvania]] and operated by the [[Pennsylvania State University]] and industry subcontractors. The ''Swift'' main ground station is located at the [[Broglio Space Centre]] near [[Malindi]] on the coast of Eastern [[Kenya]], and is operated by the [[Italian Space Agency]]. The Swift Science Data Center (SDC) and archive are located at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] outside [[Washington D.C.]] The UK Swift Science Data Centre is located at the [[University of Leicester]].

The ''Swift'' spacecraft bus was built by Spectrum Astro, which was later acquired by [[General Dynamics|General Dynamics Advanced Information Systems]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spectrumastro.com/AIS/gprod/content/detail.cfm?item=ba5f3851-5741-405f-b617-943e4191e88f |title=Swift |publisher=Spectrum Astro}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was in turn acquired by  [[Orbital Sciences|Orbital Sciences Corporation]] (now [[Orbital ATK]]).

==Instruments==

===Burst Alert Telescope (BAT)===
The BAT detects GRB events and computes its [[coordinate]]s in the sky. It covers a large fraction of the sky (over one [[steradian]] fully coded, three steradians partially coded; by comparison, the full sky solid angle is 4π or about 12.6 steradians).  It locates the position of each event with an accuracy of 1 to 4 [[arc-minute]]s within 15 [[second]]s. This crude position is immediately relayed to the ground, and some wide-field, rapid-slew ground-based telescopes can catch the GRB with this information. The BAT uses a [[coded aperture|coded-aperture mask]] of 52,000 randomly placed 5&amp;nbsp;mm [[lead]] tiles, 1 metre above a detector plane of 32,768 four&amp;nbsp;mm [[Cadmium zinc telluride|CdZnTe]] hard X-ray detector tiles; it is purpose-built for ''Swift''. Energy range: 15–150 [[keV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/bat_desc.html |title=Swift's Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=J. D. |last=Myers |date=February 28, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===X-ray Telescope (XRT)===
The XRT&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The ''Swift'' X-Ray Telescope |journal=Space Science Reviews |first=David N. |last=Burrows |display-authors=etal |volume=120 |issue=3-4 |pages=165-195 |date=October 2005 |doi=10.1007/s11214-005-5097-2 |bibcode=2005SSRv..120..165B |arxiv=astro-ph/0508071}}&lt;/ref&gt; can take images and perform [[spectroscopy|spectral analysis]] of the GRB afterglow. This provides more precise location of the GRB, with a typical error circle of approximately 2 [[arcsecond]]s radius. The XRT is also used to perform long-term monitoring of GRB afterglow light-curves for days to weeks after the event, depending on the brightness of the afterglow.  The XRT uses a [[Wolter telescope|Wolter Type I X-ray telescope]] with 12 nested mirrors, focused onto a single MOS [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD) similar to those used by the [[XMM-Newton]] EPIC MOS cameras. On-board software allows fully automated observations, with the instrument selecting an appropriate observing mode for each object, based on its measured count rate. The telescope has an energy range of 0.2–10 [[keV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/xrt_desc.html |title=Swift's X-Ray Telescope (XRT) |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=J. D. |last=Myers |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT)===
[[File:M101 combined low.jpg|thumb|left|UVOT's "[[first light (astronomy)|first light]]" image]]
After ''Swift'' has slewed towards a GRB, the [[The Swift UVOT Photometric System|UVOT]] is used to detect an optical afterglow. The UVOT provides a sub-arcsecond position and provides optical and ultra-violet photometry through lenticular filters and low resolution spectra (170–650 [[Nanometre|nm]]) through the use of its optical and UV [[grism]]s. The UVOT is also used to provide long-term follow-ups of GRB afterglow lightcurves. The UVOT is based on the [[XMM-Newton]] mission's Optical Monitor (OM) instrument, with improved optics and upgraded onboard processing computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/swift/about_swift/uvot_desc.html |title=Swift's Ultraviolet/Optical Telescope (UVOT) |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=J. D. |last=Myers |date=December 14, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 9, 2011, UVOT photographed the asteroid [[2005 YU55|2005 YU&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;]] as the asteroid made a close flyby of the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a010800/a010871/ |title=Swift Captures Flyby of Asteroid 2005 YU55 |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=November 11, 2011 |accessdate=November 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2013, UVOT unveiled a massive ultraviolet survey of the nearby [[Magellanic Clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/magellanic-uv.html |title=NASA's Swift Produces Best Ultraviolet Maps of the Nearest Galaxies |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=June 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission goals==
The ''Swift'' mission has four key scientific objectives:
*To determine the origin of GRBs. There seem to be at least two types of GRBs, only one of which can be explained with a [[hypernova]], creating a gamma-ray beam. More data is needed to explore other explanations.
*To use GRBs to expand understanding of the young [[universe]]. GRBs seem to take place at "cosmological distances" of many millions or billions of [[light-years]], which means they can be used to probe the distant, and therefore young, cosmos.
*To conduct an all-sky survey which will be more sensitive than any previous one, and will add significantly to scientific knowledge of astronomical X-ray sources. Thus, it could also yield unexpected results.
*To serve as a general purpose gamma-ray/X-ray/optical observatory platform, performing rapid "target of opportunity" observations of many transient astrophysical phenomena, such as [[supernova]]e.

==Mission history==
''Swift'' was launched on November 20, 2004, at 17:16&amp;nbsp;[[UTC]] aboard a [[Delta II]] 7320-10C from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] and reached a near-perfect orbit of {{convert|585|xx|604|km|mi|abbr=on}} altitude, with an inclination of 20.6°.&lt;ref name="nssdc-orbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftOrbit.do?id=2004-047A |title=Swift - Trajectory Details |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=January 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, an anomaly occurred during instrument activation when the Thermo-Electric Cooler (TEC) Power Supply for the X-Ray Telescope did not turn on as expected. The XRT Team at [[University of Leicester|Leicester]] and [[Penn State University]] were able to determine on December 8 that the XRT would be usable even without the TEC being operational. Additional testing on December 16 did not yield any further information as to the cause of the anomaly.

On December 17 at 07:28:30&amp;nbsp;UTC, the ''Swift'' Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) triggered and located on board an apparent gamma-ray burst during launch and early operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/041217.gcn3 |title=GRB041217: The First GRB Located On-Board Swift |publisher=NASA |first=Ed |last=Fenimore |date=December 17, 2004 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spacecraft did not autonomously slew to the burst since normal operation had not yet begun, and autonomous slewing was not yet enabled. ''Swift'' had its first GRB trigger during a period when the autonomous slewing was enabled on January 17, 2005, at about 12:55&amp;nbsp;UTC. It pointed the XRT telescope to the on-board computed coordinates and observed a bright X-ray source in the field of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/050117.gcn3 |title=GRB050117: Swift XRT Position |publisher=NASA |first=David |last=Burrows |date=January 17, 2005 |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 1, 2005, the mission team released the [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] picture of the UVOT instrument and declared ''Swift'' operational.

By May 2010, ''Swift'' had detected more than 500 GRBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/500th.html |title=NASA's Swift Catches 500th Gamma-ray Burst |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=April 19, 2010 |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October 2013, ''Swift'' had detected more than 800 GRBs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/grb_table/stats/ |title=Swift GRB Table Stats |publisher=NASA |accessdate=November 10, 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110040640/http://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/archive/grb_table/stats/ |archivedate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 27, 2015, ''Swift'' detected its 1,000th GRB, an event named {{nowrap|GRB 151027B}} and located in the constellation [[Eridanus (constellation)|Eridanus]].&lt;ref name="nasa20151106"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/nasas-swift-spots-its-thousandth-gamma-ray-burst |title=NASA's Swift Spots its Thousandth Gamma-ray Burst |publisher=NASA |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=November 6, 2015 |accessdate=October 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2018, NASA announced that the ''Swift'' spacecraft had been renamed the Neil Gehrels ''Swift'' Observatory in honor of mission PI [[Neil Gehrels]], who died in early 2017.&lt;ref name="spacenews20180111"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://spacenews.com/nasa-renames-swift-mission-after-astronomer-neil-gehrels/ |title=NASA renames Swift mission after astronomer Neil Gehrels |work=SpaceNews |first=Jeff |last=Foust |date=January 11, 2018 |accessdate=January 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.space.com/39349-swift-observatory-name-change.html |title=NASA Renames Swift Observatory in Honor of Late Principal Investigator |work=Space.com |first=Calla |last=Cofield |date=January 10, 2018 |access-date=July 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 9, 2005: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 050509B]], a burst of gamma rays that lasted one-twentieth of a second. The detection marked the first time that the accurate location of a short-duration gamma-ray burst had been identified and the first detection of X-ray afterglow in an individual short burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4537905.stm |title=Blast hints at black hole birth |work=BBC News |first=David |last=Whitehouse |date=May 11, 2005 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/05/31_shortburst.shtml |title=Astronomers hot on the trail of nature's exotic flashers |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |first=Joshua |last=Bloom |date=May 31, 2005 |accessdate=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* September 4, 2005: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 050904]] with a [[redshift]] value of 6.29 and a duration of 200 seconds (most of the detected bursts last about 10 seconds). It was also found to be the most distant yet detected, at approximately 12.6 billion [[light-year]]s.
* February 18, 2006: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 060218]], an unusually long (about 2000 seconds) and nearby (about 440 million light-years) burst, which was unusually dim despite its close distance, and may be an indication of an imminent [[supernova]].
* June 14, 2006: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 060614]], a burst of gamma rays that lasted 102 seconds in a distant galaxy (about 1.6 billion light-years). No supernova was seen following this event (and [[GRB 060505]] to deep limits) leading some to speculate that it represented a new class of progenitors. Others suggested that these events could have been massive star deaths, but ones which produced too little radioactive [[Isotopes of nickel|&lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Ni]] to power a supernova explosion.
* January 9, 2008: ''Swift'' was observing a supernova in [[NGC 2770]] when it witnessed an X-ray burst coming from the same galaxy. The source of this burst was found to be the beginning of another supernova, later called [[SN 2008D]]. Never before had a supernova been seen at such an early stage in its evolution. Following this stroke of luck (position, time, most appropriate instruments), astronomers were able to study in detail this [[Type Ib and Ic supernovae|Type Ibc supernova]] with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], the [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]], the [[Very Large Array]] in New Mexico, the [[Gemini North]] telescope in Hawaii, [[Gemini South]] in Chile, the [[Keck I]] telescope in Hawaii, the 1.3m PAIRITEL telescope at Mt Hopkins, the [[Hale telescope|200-inch]] and 60-inch telescopes at the [[Palomar Observatory]] in California, and the 3.5-meter telescope at the [[Apache Point Observatory]] in New Mexico. The significance of this supernova was likened by discovery team leader [[Alicia Soderberg]] to that of the [[Rosetta Stone]] for egyptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/swift_supernova.html |title=NASA's Swift Satellite Catches a Star Going 'Kaboom!' |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=Robert |last=Naeye |date=May 21, 2008 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* February 8 and 13, 2008: ''Swift'' provided critical information about the nature of [[Hanny's Voorwerp]], mainly the absence of an ionizing source within the Voorwerp or in the neighboring [[IC 2497]].
* March 19, 2008: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 080319B]], a burst of gamma rays amongst the brightest celestial objects ever witnessed. At 7.5 billion [[light-year]]s, ''Swift'' established a new record for the farthest object (briefly) visible to the naked eye. It was also said to be 2.5 million times intrinsically brighter than the previous [[SN 2005ap|brightest accepted supernova (SN 2005ap)]]. ''Swift'' observed a record four GRBs that day, which also coincided with the death of noted science-fiction writer [[Arthur C. Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2008/brightest_grb.html |title=NASA Satellite Detects Naked-Eye Explosion Halfway Across Universe |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=J.

* September 13, 2008: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 080913]], at the time the most distant GRB observed (12.8 billion light-years) until the observation of [[GRB 090423]] a few months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.universetoday.com/2009/10/28/more-observations-of-grb-090423-the-most-distant-known-object-in-the-universe/ |title=More Observations of GRB 090423, the Most Distant Known Object in the Universe |work=Universe Today |first=Nancy |last=Atkinson |date=October 28, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='NASA'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/farthest_grb.html |title=NASA's Swift Catches Farthest Ever Gamma-Ray Burst |publisher=NASA |first=Robert |last=Garner |date=September 19, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* April 23, 2009: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 090423]], the most distant cosmic explosion ever seen at that time, at 13.035 billion light-years. In other words, the universe was only 630 million years old when this burst occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/swift/bursts/cosmic_record.html |title=New Gamma-Ray Burst Smashes Cosmic Distance Record |publisher=NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center |first=Francis |last=Reddy |date=April 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* April 29, 2009: ''Swift'' detected [[GRB 090429B]], which was found by later analysis published in 2011 to be 13.14 billion light-years distant (approximately equivalent to 520 million years after the Big Bang), even farther than GRB 090423.&lt;ref name='BBC News'&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13539914 |title=Cosmic distance record 'broken' |work=BBC News |first=Jonathan |last=Amos |date=May 25, 2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* May 3, 2014:  Detection of a UV Pulse from an iPTF discovered young Type Ia SN
* June-July 2015: The [[brown dwarf]] {{nowrap|OGLE-2015-BLG-1319}} was discovered using the [[gravitational microlensing]] detection method in a joint effort between ''Swift'', ''[[Spitzer Space Telescope|Spitzer]]'', and the ground-based [[Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment]], the first time two space telescopes have observed the same microlensing event. This method was possible because of the large separation between the two spacecraft: ''Swift'' is in low-Earth orbit while ''Spitzer'' is more than one [[astronomical unit|AU]] distant in an Earth-trailing heliocentric orbit. This separation provided significantly different perspectives of the brown dwarf, allowing for constraints to be placed on some of the object's physical characteristics.&lt;ref name="nasa20161110"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6673 |title=NASA Space Telescopes Pinpoint Elusive Brown Dwarf |publisher=NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory |first=Elizabeth |last=Landau |date=November 10, 2016 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oppenheimer Los Alamos portrait.jpg|right|thumb|Oppenheimer was probed in a controversial four-week hearing in 1954.]]
The '''Oppenheimer security hearing''' was a 1954 proceeding by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) that explored the background, actions, and associations of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], the American scientist who had headed the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] during [[World War II]], where he played a key part in the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the [[atomic bomb]]. The hearing resulted in Oppenheimer's [[Q clearance]] being revoked. This marked the end of his formal relationship with the government of the United States, and generated considerable controversy regarding whether the treatment of Oppenheimer was fair, or whether it was an expression of anti-Communist [[McCarthyism]].

Doubts about Oppenheimer's loyalty dated back to the 1930s, when he was a member of numerous [[Communist front]] organizations, and was associated with [[Communist Party USA]] members, including his wife and his brother. These associations were known to Army Counter-intelligence at the time he was made director of the Los Alamos Laboratory in 1942, and chairman of the influential General Advisory Committee of the AEC in 1947. In this capacity Oppenheimer became involved in bureaucratic conflict between the Army and Air Force over the types of nuclear weapons the country required, technical conflict between the scientists over the feasibility of the [[hydrogen bomb]], and personal conflict with AEC commissioner [[Lewis Strauss]].

The proceedings were initiated after Oppenheimer refused to voluntarily give up his security clearance while working as an atomic weapons consultant for the government, under a contract due to expire at the end of June 1954. Several of his colleagues testified at the hearings. As a result of the two to one decision of the hearing's three judges, he was stripped of his security clearance one day before his consultant contract was due to expire. The panel found that he was loyal and discreet with atomic secrets, but did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.

The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. He became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create. The reputations of those who had testified against Oppenheimer were tarnished as well, and Oppenheimer's reputation was later partly rehabilitated by Presidents [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. The brief period when scientists were hailed as heroes uniquely qualified to comment on public policy was ended, and scientists working within the government were on notice that [[dissent]] was no longer tolerated.

==Background==

===Robert Oppenheimer===
Before [[World War II]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] had been professor of physics at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The scion of a wealthy New York family,{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=29–30}} he was a graduate of [[Harvard University]], and had studied in Europe at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England,{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=12}} the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany (where he had earned his doctorate in physics under the supervision of [[Max Born]] at the age of 23),{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=54–61}} and the [[University of Leiden]] in the Netherlands.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=12}} As one of the few American physicists with a deep understanding of the new field of [[Quantum Mechanics|quantum mechanics]], he was hired by the University of California in 1929.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=11}}{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=82}}

As a theoretical physicist, Oppenheimer had considerable achievements. In a 1930 paper on the [[Dirac equation]], he had predicted the existence of the [[positron]]. A 1938 paper co-written with [[Robert Serber]] explored the properties of [[white dwarf]] stars. This was followed by one co-written with one of his students, [[George Volkoff]], in  which they demonstrated that there was a limit, the so-called [[Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit]], to the [[mass]] of stars beyond which they would not remain stable as [[neutron stars]] and would undergo gravitational collapse. In 1939, with another of his students, [[Hartland Snyder]], he went further and predicted the existence of what are today known as [[black hole]]s. It would be decades before the significance of this was appreciated.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=89–90}}

Still, Oppenheimer was not well known before the war, and certainly not as renowned as his friend and colleague [[Ernest O. Lawrence]], who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1939 for his invention of the [[cyclotron]]. But as an experimental physicist, Lawrence had come to rely on Oppenheimer,{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=9–10}}{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=86}} and it was Lawrence who brought Oppenheimer into the effort to develop an [[atomic bomb]], which became known as the [[Manhattan Project]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=43–44}} [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Leslie R. Groves, Jr.]], who became director of the Manhattan Project on  September 8, 1942, met Oppenheimer at Berkeley, where Oppenheimer briefed Groves on his work on the "[[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Super]]" (thermonuclear) bomb. Oppenheimer told Groves on October 8 that the Manhattan Project needed a dedicated weapons development laboratory. Groves agreed, and after a second meeting with Oppenheimer on a train on October 15, decided that Oppenheimer was the man he needed to head what became the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]], despite Oppenheimer's lack of a Nobel Prize or administrative experience.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=70–71}}{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=185–187}}

The end of the war in the wake of the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] made scientists into heroes. Oppenheimer became a celebrity, with his face gracing front pages of newspapers and the covers of magazines.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=323}} ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine described him as "one of the most famous men in the world, one of the most admired, quoted, photographed, consulted, glorified, well-nigh deified as the fabulous and fascinating archetype of a brand new kind of hero, the hero of science and intellect, originator and living symbol of the new atomic age."{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=556}}

===Chevalier incident===
Many of Oppenheimer's associates in the years before World War II were [[Communist Party USA]] members. They included his wife Kitty, whose first husband Joe Dallet had been killed fighting with the [[Lincoln Battalion]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]; his brother [[Frank Oppenheimer]] and Frank's wife Jackie; and his girlfriend [[Jean Tatlock]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=51–54}} One of his Communist associates was a colleague at the University of California, an [[assistant professor]] of French literature named [[Haakon Chevalier]]. The two had met during a rally for [[Spanish Loyalists]], and had co-founded a branch of the [[American Federation of Teachers]] at Berkeley known as Local 349.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=29–30}} The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) had opened a file on Oppenheimer in March 1941, after he had attended a December 1940 meeting at Chevalier's home that was also attended by the Communist Party's California state secretary William Schneiderman and its treasurer [[Isaac Folkoff]], both of whom were targets of FBI surveillance and wiretaps. Agents had recorded the license plate of Oppenheimer's car. The FBI noted that Oppenheimer was on the Executive Committee of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], which it considered a [[Communist front]]. Shortly thereafter, the FBI added Oppenheimer to its [[Custodial Detention Index]], for arrest in case of national emergency.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=137–138}}{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=55–56}}

[[File:HD.4G.039 (10537699636).jpg|thumb|left|The General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) in 1947; left to right: [[James B. Conant]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], Brigadier General [[James McCormack]], Hartley Rowe, [[John H. Manley]], [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]] and Roger S. Warner ]]
In January or February 1943, Chevalier had a brief conversation with Oppenheimer in the kitchen of his home. Chevalier told Oppenheimer that there was a scientist, George Eltenton, who could transmit information of a technical nature to the [[Soviet Union]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=160–162}} Oppenheimer rejected the overture, but failed to report it until August 1943, when he volunteered to Manhattan Project security officers that three men at Berkeley had been solicited for nuclear secrets on behalf of the Soviet Union, by a person he did not know who worked for [[Shell Oil]], and who had [[Communist]] connections. He gave that person's name as George Eltenton. When pressed on the issue in later interviews at Los Alamos in December 1943 with Groves, who promised to keep the identity of the three men from the FBI, Oppenheimer identified the contact who had approached him as Chevalier, and told Groves that only one person had been approached: his brother Frank.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=110–115}} Groves considered Oppenheimer too important to the ultimate Allied goals of building atomic bombs and winning the war to oust him over this suspicious behavior. He ordered that Oppenheimer be given a security clearance "without delay, irrespective of the information which you have concerning Mr. Oppenheimer. He is absolutely essential to the project."{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=102}}

Oppenheimer was interviewed by the FBI on September 5, 1946. He related the "Chevalier incident", and he gave contradictory and equivocating statements, telling government agents that only he had been approached, by Chevalier, who at the time had supposedly said that he had a potential conduit through Eltenton for information which could be passed to the Soviets. Oppenheimer claimed to have invented the other contacts to conceal the identity of Chevalier, whose identity he believed would be immediately apparent if he named only one contact, but whom he believed to be innocent of any disloyalty. The 1943 fabrication and the shifting nature of his accounts figured prominently in the 1954 inquiry.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=93–94}}{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=358–359}}

The [[McMahon Act]] that established the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) required all employees holding wartime security clearances issued by the Manhattan Project to be investigated by the [[FBI]] and re-certified.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=177–179}} This provision had come in the wake of the February 16, 1946, defection of [[Igor Gouzenko]] in Canada, and the subsequent arrest of 22 people.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=501}} President [[Harry S. Truman]] appointed Oppenheimer to the AEC General Advisory Committee (GAC) on December 10, 1946,{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=648}} so the FBI interviewed two dozen of Oppenheimer's associates, including [[Robert Bacher]], Ernest Lawrence, [[Enrico Fermi]] and [[Robert Gordon Sproul]]. Groves and the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Robert P. Patterson]] supplied written statements supporting Oppenheimer.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=177–179}} AEC chairman [[David Lilienthal]] and [[Vannevar Bush]] discussed the matter with Truman's sympathetic aide [[Clark Clifford]] at the White House.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=177–179}} They found [[John Lansdale, Jr.]] particularly persuasive; he had interrogated Oppenheimer over the Chevalier incident in 1943, and strongly supported him.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=59–64}} On August 11, 1947, they unanimously voted to grant Oppenheimer a [[Q clearance]].{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=179–180}} At the first meeting of the GAC on January 3, 1947, Oppenheimer was unanimously elected its chairman.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=15–16}}

===Postwar conflicts===
The FBI was willing to furnish Oppenheimer's political enemies with incriminating evidence about Communist ties. These included [[Lewis Strauss]],{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=466–470}} an AEC commissioner who resented Oppenheimer for his humiliation before Congress regarding opposition to the export of radioactive isotopes to other nations, which Strauss believed had military applications. As GAC chairman, Oppenheimer was called before the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy|Joint Committee on Atomic Energy]] (JCAE) over the issue in June 1949. The other four AEC commissioners had opposed Strauss, so he had gone to the JCAE in an attempt to get the decision overturned.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=401}} The result was a stunning humiliation for the thin-skinned Strauss.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=401}} Oppenheimer testified that: {{quote|No one can force me to say that you cannot use these isotopes for atomic energy. You can use a shovel for atomic energy, in fact you do. You can use a bottle of beer for atomic energy, in fact you do. But to get some perspective, the fact is that during the war and after the war these materials played no significant part, and in my knowledge, no part at all&amp;nbsp;... My own rating of the importance of isotopes in this broad sense is that they are far less important than electronic devices but far more important than, let us say, vitamins, somewhere in between.{{sfn|Monk|2012|p=539}} }}

This came on the heels of controversies about whether some of Oppenheimer's students, including [[David Bohm]], [[Ross Lomanitz]] and Bernard Peters, had been Communists at the time they had worked with him at Berkeley. Oppenheimer was called to testify in front of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]], where he admitted that he had associations with the Communist Party in the 1930s, and named some of his students as being Communists or closely associated with them. Bohm and Peters eventually left the country, while Lomanitz was forced to work as a laborer.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=396–400}} Frank Oppenheimer was fired from his university position, and could not find work in physics for a decade. He and his wife Jackie became cattle ranchers in [[Colorado]].{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=402–404}} Their reputations were rehabilitated in 1959, and they founded the San Francisco [[Exploratorium]] in 1969.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=588–589}}

[[David Kaiser]] noted that:{{quote|These dozen or so theoretical physicists surely came under fire for many reasons; with hindsight their troubles appear almost overdetermined. Most were Jewish; several had been active in labor organizing before or during the war; a few had flirted with the Communist Party in their youth; many were active in other leftwing political organizations after the war. Perhaps most important, however, they had close and long-standing ties with Robert Oppenheimer...{{sfn|Kaiser|2005|p=29}} }}

[[File:Edward Teller (1958)-LLNL.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edward Teller]], who clashed with Oppenheimer on the H-bomb, testified against him.]]
From 1949 to 1953, Oppenheimer had also found himself in the middle of a controversy over the development of the "Super". In 1949, the Soviet Union detonated an atomic bomb. This came as a shock to many Americans, and it fell to Oppenheimer to check the evidence and confirm that the explosion had taken place.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=364–369}} In response, Strauss recommended that the United States retain nuclear superiority by developing the "Super".{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=373}} This had been under consideration at Los Alamos for several years. Brigadier General [[James McCormack]] told the AEC commissioners that while thermonuclear weapons could potentially be thousands of times as powerful as fission weapons, as of 1949 there was no design that worked, and no certainty that a practical bomb could be built if there was one. He cautioned that the "Super" would probably require large amounts of [[tritium]], which could only be acquired by diverting the AEC's [[nuclear reactor]]s from [[plutonium]] production.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|p=372}}

Strauss found allies in Lawrence and [[Edward Teller]], who had headed the "Super" group at Los Alamos during the war.{{sfn|Herken|2002|pp=86–87}} When the matter was referred to the GAC, it unanimously voted against a crash program to develop the "Super". Without a workable design, it seemed foolish to divert resources from atomic bombs.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=380–385}} Nor was there an obvious military need.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=395–399}} Despite this, Truman authorized the crash program on January 31, 1950.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=406–408}} Teller, Fermi, [[John von Neumann]], and [[Stan Ulam]] struggled to find a working design,{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=438–441}} and in February 1951, Ulam and Teller finally [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|devised one]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=536–537}} After reviewing the design and data gathered by the [[Operation Greenhouse]] tests in May 1951, Oppenheimer's  attitude completely changed, and he became convinced that the "New Super" was practical.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=544–545}} Teller left Los Alamos to help found, with Lawrence, a second weapons laboratory, the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], in 1952.{{sfn|Hewlett|Duncan|1969|pp=581–583}}

Thermonuclear "strategic weapons" (military targets and city-destroyers) delivered by long-range jet bombers would necessarily be under control of the relatively new [[United States Air Force]]. By contrast, Oppenheimer pushed for smaller "tactical" nuclear weapons which would be more useful in a limited theater against enemy troops, and which would be under control of the Army. These two branches of the service fought for control of nuclear weapons, often allied with different political parties. The Air Force, with Teller pushing its program, gained ascendency in the Republican-controlled government, after the election of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] as president in 1952.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=444–446}}

===Claims made in the Borden letter===
In November 1953, J. Edgar Hoover was sent a letter concerning Oppenheimer by William Liscum Borden, former executive director of Congress' Joint Atomic Energy Committee. In the letter, Borden stated his opinion "based upon years of study, of the available classified evidence, that more probably than not J. Robert Oppenheimer is an agent of the Soviet Union."&lt;ref&gt;Hearing transcript, p. 837.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was based upon the government's massive investigative dossier on Oppenheimer, which had included "eleven years' minute surveillance of the scientist's life." His office and home had been bugged, his telephone tapped and his mail opened.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=2}}

Borden's letter stated as follows:

{{quote|This opinion considers the following factors, among others.

1. The evidence indicating that as of April 1942: (a) He was contributing substantial monthly sums to the Communist Party; (b) His ties with communism had survived the Nazi-Soviet Pact and the Soviet attack upon Finland; (c) His wife and younger brother were Communists; (d) He had no close friends except Communists; (e) He had at least one Communist mistress; (f) He belonged only to Communist organizations, apart from professional affiliations; (g) The people whom he recruited into the early wartime Berkeley atom project were exclusively Communists; (h) He had been instrumental in securing recruits for the Communist Party, and (i) He was in frequent contact with Soviet Espionage agents.

2. The evidence indicating that: (a) In May 1942, he either stopped contributing funds to the Communist Party or else made his contributions though a new channel not yet discovered; (b) In April 1943 his name was formally submitted for security clearance; (c) He himself was aware at the time that his name had been so submitted and (d) He thereafter repeatedly gave false information to General Groves, Manhattan District, and the FBI concerning the 1939 – April 1942 period.

3. The evidence indicating that: (a) He was responsible for employing a number of Communists, some of them not technical, at wartime Los Alamos; (b) He selected one such individual to write the official Los Alamos history; (c) He was a vigorous supporter of the H-bomb program until August 6, 1945, (Hiroshima), on which day he personally urged each senior individual working in this field to desist; and (d) He was an enthusiastic sponsor of the A-bomb program until the war ended, when he immediately and outspokenly advocated the Los Alamos Laboratory be disbanded.

4. The evidence indicating that: (a) He was remarkably instrumental in influencing the military authorities and the Atomic Energy Commission essentially to suspend H-bomb development from mid-1946 through January 31, 1950 [the date of President Truman's public announcement that the United States, in answer to the new Soviet atomic bomb, would seek to build an H-bomb] (b) He has worked tirelessly, from January 31, 1950, onward to retard the United States H-bomb program; (c) He has used his potent influence against every postwar effort to expand capacity for producing A-bomb material; (d) He has used his potent influence against every postwar effort directed at obtaining larger supplies of uranium raw material; and (e) He has used his potent influence against every major postwar effort toward atomic power development, including the nuclear-powered submarine and aircraft programs as well as industrial power projects.&lt;ref&gt;Hearing transcript, p. 837 (corrected, p. 838).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The letter also pointed out that Oppenheimer had worked against development of the hydrogen bomb, and had worked against postwar atomic energy development, including nuclear power plants and nuclear submarines. The letter concluded:
{{quote|1. Between 1939 and mid-1942, more probably than not, J. Robert Oppenheimer was a sufficiently hardened Communist that he either volunteered espionage information to the Soviets or complied with a request for such information. (This includes the possibility that when he singled out the weapons aspect of atomic development as his personal speciality, he was acting under Soviet instructions.) 2. More probably than not, he has since been functioning as an espionage agent; and 3. More probably than not, he has since acted under a Soviet directive in influencing United States military, atomic energy, intelligence, and diplomatic policy.&lt;ref&gt;Hearing transcript, p. 838.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The contents of the letter were not new, and some had been known when Oppenheimer was first cleared for atomic war work. Yet that information had not prompted anyone to seek his removal from government service.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=3}} Despite the lack of new evidence, Eisenhower ordered that a "blank wall" be placed between Oppenheimer and the nation's atomic secrets.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=4}}

==Hearing==

===Board composition and procedures===
On December 21, 1953, Oppenheimer was told by Lewis Strauss that his security file had been subject to two recent re-evaluations because of new screening criteria, and because a former government official had drawn attention to Oppenheimer's record. Strauss said that his clearance had been suspended, pending resolution of a series of charges outlined in a letter, and discussed his resigning. Given only a day to decide, and after consulting with his lawyers, Oppenheimer chose not to resign, and requested a hearing instead. The charges were outlined in a letter from [[Kenneth D. Nichols]], general manager of the AEC. Pending resolution of the charges, Oppenheimer's security clearance was suspended. Oppenheimer told Strauss that some of what was in Nichols' letter was correct, some incorrect.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=229–230}}&lt;ref&gt;Hearing transcript, pp. 3–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gordon Gray - Project Gutenberg etext 20587.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The hearing was chaired by [[Gordon Gray (politician)|Gordon Gray]], president of the University of North Carolina.]]

The hearing was held at a temporary building near the Washington Monument housing offices of the AEC. It began on April 12, 1954, and lasted four weeks. The AEC was represented by [[Roger Robb]], an experienced prosecutor in Washington, and Arthur Rolander, while Oppenheimer's legal team was headed by [[Lloyd K. Garrison]], a prominent New York attorney. The chairman of the Personnel Security Board was [[Gordon Gray (politician)|Gordon Gray]], president of the [[University of North Carolina]]. The other members of the hearing panel were Thomas Alfred Morgan, a retired industrialist, and [[Ward V. Evans]], chairman of the chemistry department at [[Northwestern University]].{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=238, 257–260}}

The hearing was not open to the public and initially was not publicized. At the commencement of the hearing, Gray stated the hearing was "strictly confidential", and pledged that no information related to the hearing would be released. Contrary to this assurance, a few weeks after the conclusion of the hearing a verbatim transcript of the hearing was released by the AEC. Oppenheimer and Garrison also breached the confidentiality of the hearing, by communicating with ''New York Times'' journalist [[James Reston]], who wrote an article on the hearing that appeared on the second day of the hearing.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=263, 267}}

Garrison applied for an emergency security clearance prior to the hearing, as one had been granted to Robb, but no clearance was granted during the course of the hearing, which meant that Oppenheimer's attorneys had no access to the secrets that Robb was able to see. On at least three occasions, Garrison and his co-counsel were barred from the hearing room for security reasons, leaving Oppenheimer unrepresented, in violation of AEC regulations. During the course of the hearing, Robb repeatedly cross-examined Oppenheimer's witnesses utilizing top-secret documents unavailable to Oppenheimer's lawyers. He often read aloud from those documents, despite their secret status.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=247, 269, 295}}

The AEC's former general counsel Joseph Volpe had urged Oppenheimer to retain a tough litigator as his attorney; Garrison's demeanor was gentle and cordial, but Robb was adversarial. Garrison voluntarily provided the board and Robb with a list of his witnesses, but Robb refused to extend the same courtesy. This gave Robb a clear advantage in his cross-examination of Oppenheimer's witnesses.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=264–266}} One observer commented that Robb "did not treat Oppenheimer as a witness in his own case, but as a person charged with high treason."{{sfn|Jungk|1958|p=322}}

Members of the hearing panel met with Robb prior to the hearing to review the contents of Oppenheimer's FBI file. The 1946 [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] included a legal principle known as "the exclusivity of the record" or the "[[blank pad rule]]". This meant that a hearing could only consider information that had been formally presented under the established rules of evidence. However, while the act applied to the courts and to administrative hearings held by agencies like the [[Federal Trade Commission]] and [[Federal Communications Commission]], it did not apply to the AEC. Garrison asked for the opportunity to review the file with the panel, but this was rejected.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=253–254}}

===Scope of testimony===
As outlined in the 3,500-word Nichols letter, the hearing focused on 24 allegations, 23 of which dealt with Oppenheimer's Communist and left-wing affiliations between 1938 and 1946, including his delayed and false reporting of the Chevalier incident to authorities. The twenty-fourth charge related to his opposition to the hydrogen bomb. By including the hydrogen bomb, the AEC changed the character of the hearing, by opening up an inquiry into his activities as a postwar government adviser.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=228, 234}}

[[File:Enrico Fermi 1943-49.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Nobel Prize winning physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] was among the eminent scientists who testified in support of Oppenheimer.]]
Oppenheimer testified for a total of 27 hours. His demeanor was far different than it had been in his previous interrogations, such as his appearance before the House Un-American Activities. Under cross-examination by Robb, who had access to top-secret information such as surveillance recordings, Oppenheimer was "often anguished, sometimes surprisingly inarticulate, frequently apologetic about his past and even self-castigating."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=265, 279}}

One of the key elements in this hearing was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before, and he was surprised on the witness stand with transcripts that he had no chance to review. Under questioning by Robb, he admitted that he had lied to [[Boris Pash]], an Army counterintelligence officer, concerning the approach from Chevalier. Asked why he had fabricated a story that three people had been approached for espionage, Oppenheimer responded, "Because I was an idiot."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=280}}

Much of the questioning of Oppenheimer concerned his role in the hiring for Los Alamos of his former students Ross Lomanitz and Joseph Weinberg, both members of the Communist Party.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=276–277, 285}} The questions probed into Oppenheimer's private life, including his affair with Jean Tatlock, a Communist with whom he stayed the night while he was married. Lansdale had concluded at the time that his interest in Tatlock was romantic rather than political. Nonetheless, this innocuous affair may have played more heavily in the minds of the review panel.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=282–283}}

Groves, testifying as a witness for the AEC and against Oppenheimer, reaffirmed his decision to hire Oppenheimer. Groves said that Oppenheimer's refusal to report Chevalier was "the typical American school boy attitude that there is something wicked about telling on a friend." Under questioning from Robb, Groves said that under the security criteria in effect in 1954, he "would not clear Dr. Oppenheimer today."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=284–285}}

The official position of the Air Force was to support the suspension of the security clearance, which was given during testimony by its chief scientist, [[David T. Griggs]].  Although his testimony was not pivotal in the decision, many physicists viewed Griggs as the "Judas who had betrayed their god", the brilliant theoretical physicist who led the successful wartime development of the atomic bomb.{{sfn|Getting|Christie|1994|p=123}}

Many top scientists, as well as government and military figures, testified on Oppenheimer's behalf. Among them were Fermi, [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], [[Hans Bethe]], [[John J. McCloy]], [[James B. Conant]] and Bush, as well as two former AEC chairmen and three former commissioners.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=297}} Also testifying on behalf of Oppenheimer was Lansdale, who was involved in the Army's surveillance and investigation of Oppenheimer during the war.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=297–298}} Lansdale, a lawyer, was not intimidated by Robb. He testified that Oppenheimer was not a Communist, and that he was "loyal and discreet".&lt;ref&gt;Hearing transcript, pp. 266, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ernest Lawrence]] was known to dislike political activities, seeing them as a waste of time better spent on scientific research. He did not oppose the investigations of Oppenheimer or others, tending to distance himself from those under investigation rather than supporting them.&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt; He said he was unable to testify at the Oppenheimer hearing because of illness. On April 26, Lawrence suffered a severe colitis attack. The next day, Lawrence called Lewis Strauss and told him that his brother, a doctor, had ordered him to return home and that he would not be testifying.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p= 291}} Lawrence suffered with colitis until his death during colostomy surgery, on August 27, 1958.{{sfn|Herken|2002|p=328}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Ernest Orlando Lawrence – The Man, His Lab, His Legacy|url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/lawrence-legacy.html|first=Lynn|last=Yarris|work=Science Beat|publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]|accessdate=November 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, an interview transcript in which Lawrence stated that Oppenheimer "should never again have anything to do with the forming of policy" was presented at the hearing, and several other members of Lawrence's Radiation laboratory did testify against Oppenheimer in person. This resulted in later ill-feeling from the scientific community towards Lawrence and other members of his laboratory.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|first=Haertsch |last=Emilie|title=Large and in charge |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/large-and-in-charge|journal=Distillations|volume=2|issue=3|pages=40–43|accessdate=22 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edward Teller was opposed to the hearing, feeling it was improper to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that "in a great number of cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I would like to see the vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that "if it is a question of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=337–339}} This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=339}}

==The board's decision==
[[File:Lewis Lichtenstein Strauss pers0164.jpg|right|upright|thumb|AEC chairman [[Lewis Strauss]], a long-time Oppenheimer adversary, rendered the final verdict denying his security clearance.]]
Oppenheimer's clearance was revoked by a 2–1 vote of the panel. Gray and Morgan voted in favor, Evans against. The board rendered its decision on May 27, 1954, in a 15,000-word letter to Nichols. It found that 20 of the 24 charges were either true or substantially true. The board found that while he had been opposed to the bomb and that his lack of enthusiasm for it had affected the attitude of other scientists, he had not actively discouraged scientists from working on the H-bomb, as had been alleged in Nichols' letter. It found that "there is no evidence that he was a member of the [Communist] party in the strict sense of the word," and concluded that he is a "loyal citizen". It said that he "had a high degree of discretion, reflecting an unusual ability to keep to himself vital secrets," but that he had "a tendency to be coerced, or at least influenced in conduct, for a period of years."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=367–374}}

The board found that Oppenheimer's association with Chevalier "is not the kind of thing that our security system permits on the part of one who customarily has access to information of the highest classification", and concluded that "Oppenheimer's continuing conduct reflects a serious disregard for the requirements of the security system," that he was susceptible "to influence which could have serious implications for the security interests of the country," that his attitude toward the H-bomb program raised doubt about whether his future participation "would be consistent with the best interests of security," and that Oppenheimer had been "less than candid in several instances" in his testimony. The majority therefore did not recommend that his security clearance be reinstated.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=374–374}}

In a brief dissent, Evans argued that Oppenheimer's security clearance should be reinstated. He pointed out that most of the AEC charges had been in the hands of the AEC when it cleared Oppenheimer in 1947, and that "to deny him clearance now for what he was cleared for in 1947, when we must know he is less of a security risk now than he was then, seems to be hardly the procedure to be adopted in a free country." Evans said that his association with Chevalier did not indicate disloyalty, and that he did not hinder development of the H-bomb. Evans said he personally thought that "our failure to clear Dr. Oppenheimer will be a black mark on the escutcheon of our country," and expressed concern about the effect an improper decision might have on the country's scientific development.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=380–381}}

===Nichols findings and AEC decision===
In a harshly worded memorandum to the AEC on June 12, 1954, Nichols recommended that Oppenheimer's security clearance not be reinstated. In five "security findings", Nichols said that Oppenheimer was "a Communist in every sense except that he did not carry a party card," and that the Chevalier incident indicated that Oppenheimer "is not reliable or trustworthy", and that his misstatements might have represented criminal conduct. He said that Oppenheimer's "obstruction and disregard for security" showed "a consistent disregard of a reasonable security system." The Nichols memorandum was not made public nor provided to Oppenheimer's lawyers, who were not allowed to appear before the AEC.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=394–398, 400–401}}

On June 29, 1954, the AEC upheld the findings of the Personnel Security Board, with five commissioners voting in favor and one opposed. The decision was rendered 32 hours before Oppenheimer's consultant contract, and with it the need for a clearance, was due to expire.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=418, 422}} In his majority opinion, Strauss said that Oppenheimer had displayed "fundamental character defects". He said that Oppenheimer "in his associations had repeatedly exhibited a willful disregard of the normal and proper obligations of security," and that he "has defaulted not once but many times upon the obligations that should and must be willingly borne by citizens in the national service."{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=407–413}}

Despite the promise of confidentiality, the AEC released an edited transcript of the hearing in June 1954, after press publicity of the hearing.{{sfn|Stern|1969|pp=385–389}} The unredacted transcripts were released in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/01/09/oppenheimer-unredacted-part-i/ |accessdate=November 1, 2015 |title=Oppenheimer, Unredacted: Part I – Finding the Lost Transcripts |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=January 9, 2015 |publisher=Restricted Data }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2015/01/16/oppenheimer-unredacted-part-ii/ |accessdate=November 1, 2015 |title=Oppenheimer, Unredacted: Part II – Reading the Lost Transcripts |first=Alex |last=Wellerstein |date=January 16, 2015 |publisher=Restricted Data }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and legacy==
The loss of his security clearance ended Oppenheimer's role in government and policy. Although he was not fired from his job at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], as he had feared he might be, he became an academic exile, cut off from his former career and the world he had helped to create.{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=110}} He gave public lectures,{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=560–562}} and spent several months of each year on the small island of [[Saint John, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint John]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]].{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=566–567}} [[Kai Bird]] and [[Martin J. Sherwin]] considered the Oppenheimer case "a defeat for American liberalism".{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=550}} Summing up the fallout from the case, they wrote that:{{quote|In a few years after World War II, scientists had been regarded as a new class of intellectuals, members of a public-policy priesthood who might legitimately offer expertise not only as scientists but as public philosophers. With Oppenheimer's defrocking, scientists knew that in the future they would serve the state only as experts only on narrow scientific issues. As sociologist [[Daniel Bell]] later observed, Oppenheimer's ordeal signified that the postwar "messianic role of the scientists" was now at an end. Scientists working within the system could not dissent from government policy, as Oppenheimer had done by writing his 1953 ''Foreign Affairs'' essay, and still expect to serve on government advisory boards. The trial thus represented a watershed in the relations of the scientist to the government. The narrowest version of how American scientists should serve their country had triumphed.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=549}} }}

Oppenheimer was seen by many in the scientific community as a [[martyr]] to [[McCarthyism]], a modern [[Galileo]] or [[Socrates]],{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=110}} an intellectual and progressive unjustly attacked by warmongering enemies, symbolic of the shift of scientific creativity from academia into the military.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|pp=548–547}} Patrick McGrath noted that "Scientists and administrators such as Edward Teller, Lewis Strauss and Ernest Lawrence, with their full-throated militarism and anti-communism pushed American scientists and their institutions toward a nearly complete and subservient devotion to American military interests."{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=550}} Scientists continued to work for the AEC, but they no longer trusted it.{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|pp=111–112}}

Loyalty and security tests spread through the federal government. At these inquiries, federal employees were asked questions such as:
* Is it proper to mix white and Negro blood plasma?
* There is a suspicion in your record that you are in sympathy with the underprivileged. Is that true?
* What were your feelings at that time concerning race equality?
* Have you ever made statements about the "downtrodden masses" and "underprivileged people"?{{sfn|Stern|1969|p=472}}

Strauss, Teller, Borden, and Robb would never escape the public identification of them with the case.{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=110}} In a 1962 television interview, [[Eric F. Goldman]] asked Teller whether he favored restoring Oppenheimer's security clearance. Teller was struck dumb, unable to find an answer. The question was deleted from the version that was aired, but the news got out and made headlines. President [[John F. Kennedy]] decided that the time had come to rehabilitate Oppenheimer. Teller nominated Oppenheimer for the 1963 [[Enrico Fermi Award]]. The nomination was unanimously approved by the GAC and AEC, and announced on April 5, 1963. On November 22, the White House confirmed that Kennedy would personally present the award, but he was [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassinated later that day]]. The award was presented by President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] instead.{{sfn|Stern|1969||pp=454–457}} Oppenheimer died of cancer on February 18, 1967.{{sfn|Bird|Sherwin|2005|p=587}}

[[Wernher von Braun]] summed up his opinion about the matter with a quip to a Congressional committee: "In England, Oppenheimer would have been knighted."{{sfn|Bethe|1968|p=27}}

===Recent allegations===
''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine literary critic Richard Lacayo, in a 2005 review of two new books about Oppenheimer, said of the hearing: "As an effort to prove that he had been a party member, much less one involved in espionage, the inquest was a failure. Its real purpose was larger, however: to punish the most prominent American critic of the U.S. move from atomic weapons to the much more lethal hydrogen bomb." After the hearing, Lacayo said, "Oppenheimer would never again feel comfortable as a public advocate for a sane nuclear policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Books: The Atomic Meltdown | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1056292-2,00.html | newspaper = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = May 1, 2005
 | accessdate=July 3, 2010| first=Richard| last=Lacayo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cornell University]] historian [[Richard Polenberg]] noted that Oppenheimer testified about the left-wing behavior of his colleagues and speculated that if his clearance had not been stripped, he would have been remembered as someone who had "named names" to save his own reputation.&lt;ref name="Polenberg2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Polenberg|title=In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer: The Security Clearance Hearing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KAPIC268ewC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;vq=Darling&amp;pg=PR21#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Named%20the%20names%20of%20men%20and%20women%20who%20trusted%20him%22|year=2002|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn=0-8014-8661-0|page=xxi}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Carson|2005|pp=267–272}} In a book ''Brotherhood of the Bomb: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller'' (2002), Gregg Herken, a senior historian at the Smithsonian Institution, contended, based on newly discovered documentation, that Oppenheimer was a member of the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Book Contends Chief of A-Bomb Team was Once a Communist |first=William J. |last=Broad |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 8, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/08/us/book-contends-chief-of-a-bomb-team-was-once-a-communist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a seminar at the Woodrow Wilson Institute on May 20, 2009, and based on an extensive analysis of the Vassiliev notebooks taken from the KGB archives, John Earl Haynes, Harvey Klehr, and Alexander Vassiliev concluded that Oppenheimer never was involved in espionage for the Soviets. The KGB tried repeatedly to recruit him, but were never successful. Allegations that he had spied for the Soviets are unsupported, and in some instances, contradicted by voluminous KGB and [[Venona]] documentation released after the fall of the Soviet Union. In addition, he had several persons removed from the Manhattan project who had sympathies to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Haynes|Klehr|Vassiliev|2009|pp=45–58}}

===Dramatizations===
Most popular depictions of Oppenheimer view his security struggles as a confrontation between right-wing militarists (symbolized by Edward Teller) and left-wing intellectuals (symbolized by Oppenheimer) over the moral question of weapons of mass destruction. Many historians have contested this as an oversimplification.{{sfn|Carson|2005|loc=§intro}}

The hearing was dramatized in a 1964 play by German playwright [[Heinar Kipphardt]], ''In the Matter of J. Robert Oppenheimer''. Oppenheimer objected to the play, threatening suit  and decrying "improvisations which were contrary to history and to the nature of the people involved", including its portrayal of him as viewing the bomb as a "work of the devil". His letter to Kipphardt said, "You may well have forgotten Guernica, Dachau, Coventry, Belsen, Warsaw, Dresden and Tokyo. I have not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Character Speaks Out | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,830818,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = November 20, 1964 | accessdate=July 3, 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of his security hearing, he said, "The whole damn thing was a farce, and these people are trying to make a tragedy out of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Seagrave  | first = Sterling  | title = Play About him Draws Protests of Oppenheimer  | page = B8  | newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]
| date = November 9, 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a response, Kipphardt offered to make corrections but defended the play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Playwright Suggests Corrections to Oppenheimer Drama |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=November 14, 1964 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70B14FF39581B728DDDAD0994D9415B848AF1D3}}&lt;/ref&gt; which premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in June 1968, with [[Joseph Wiseman]] in the Oppenheimer role. ''New York Times'' theater critic [[Clive Barnes]] called it an "angry play and a partisan play" that sided with Oppenheimer but portrayed the scientist as a "tragic fool and genius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theater: Drama of Oppenheimer Case |first=Clive |last=Barnes |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 7, 1968 |url=https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00E14FE3E5E1A7B93C5A9178DD85F4C8685F9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hearing also figured prominently in the 1980 BBC TV movie ''[[Oppenheimer (TV miniseries)|Oppenheimer]]'', with [[Sam Waterston]] as the title character and [[David Suchet]] as Edward Teller.

[[File:PEAP.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Astronauts from [[STS-34]] stand next to their PEAPs in 1989]]
'''Personal Egress Air Packs''', or '''PEAPs''', were devices on board a [[Space Shuttle]] which provided crew members with approximately six minutes{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} of breathable air in the case of a mishap while the vehicle was still located on the ground. PEAPs did not provide pressurized air, meaning that they were only intended to be used should the air inside the shuttle cabin become unbreathable by way of noxious gases.

The devices gained notoriety due to the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' disaster]]. After the recovery of the vehicle cockpit, it was discovered that three of the crew PEAPs were activated: those of mission specialist [[Ellison Onizuka]], mission specialist [[Judith Resnik]], and pilot [[Michael J. Smith (astronaut)|Michael J. Smith]].  The location of Smith's activation switch, on the back side of his seat, means that either Resnik or Onizuka likely activated it for him.   [[Mike Mullane]] writes: {{cquote|"Mike Smith’s PEAP had been turned on by Judy or El, I wondered if I would have had the presence of mind to do the same thing had I been in Challenger’s cockpit. Or would I have been locked in a catatonic paralysis of fear? There had been nothing in our training concerning the activation of a PEAP in the event of an in-flight emergency. The fact that Judy or El had done so for Mike Smith made them heroic in my mind. They had been able to block out the terrifying sights and sounds and motions of Challenger ’s destruction and had reached for that switch. It was the type of thing a true astronaut would do—maintain their cool in the direst of circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;''Riding Rockets'', Mike Mullane, (New York 2006), Chapter 33&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This is the most conclusive piece of evidence available from the disaster that shows that at least two of the crew members (Onizuka and Resnik) were alive after the cockpit separated from the vehicle. However, if the cabin had lost pressure, the packs alone would not have sustained the crew during the two-minute descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from Joseph Kerwin to Richard Truly relating to the deaths of the astronauts in the Challenger accident|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/kerwin.html|author=Joseph P. Kerwin|publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The partial-pressure [[Launch Entry Suit|launch-entry suits]] replaced the PEAPs, which were subsequently followed by the "[[Advanced Crew Escape Suit|ACES]]" full-pressure suits, which include self-contained oxygen tanks.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In the [[philosophy of science]], the '''pessimistic induction''', also known as the '''pessimistic meta-induction''', is an argument which seeks to rebut [[scientific realism]], particularly the scientific realist's notion of [[#Overview|epistemic optimism]].

==Overview&lt;!--'Epistemic optimism' redirects here--&gt;==
Scientific realists argue that we have good reasons to believe that our presently successful scientific theories are true or approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction undermines the realist's warrant for their '''epistemic optimism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the view that science tends to succeed in revealing what the world is like and that there are good reasons to take theories to be true or truthlike) via historical counterexample. Using meta-[[inductive reasoning|induction]], [[Larry Laudan]] argues that if past scientific theories which were successful were found to be false, we have no reason to believe the realist's claim that our currently successful theories are approximately true. The pessimistic meta-induction argument was first fully postulated by Laudan in 1981.

However, there are some objections against Laudan's theory. One might see shortcomings in the historic examples Laudan gives as proof of his hypothesis. Theories later refuted, like that of [[celestial spheres|crystalline spheres]] in astronomy, or the [[phlogiston theory]], do not represent the most successful theories at their time. A further objection tries to point out that in scientific progress we indeed approximate the truth. When we develop a new theory, the central ideas of the old one usually become refuted. Parts of the old theory, however, we carry over to the new one. In doing so, our theories become more and more well-founded on other principles, they become better in terms of predictive and descriptive power, so that, for example, aeroplanes, computers and DNA sequencing all establish technical, operational proof of the effectiveness of the theories. Therefore, we can hold the realist view that our theoretical terms refer to something in the world and our theories are approximately true.

However, as articulated by Thomas S. Kuhn in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', new scientific theories do not always build upon the older ones. In fact, they are created by an entirely new set of premises (a new "paradigm"), and reach vastly different conclusions. This gives greater weight to the proponents of anti-realism, and illustrates that no scientific theory (thus far) has proved infallible.

'''''Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World''''' is a 2018 book by [[Melissa Schilling]], a professor at [[New York University Stern School of Business]]. The book was published by [[PublicAffairs]], a division of [[Hachette Book Group]].

==Content==

[[Melissa Schilling]] develops cases studies of eight serial breakthrough innovators&amp;nbsp;– [[Elon Musk]], [[Dean Kamen]], [[Steve Jobs]], [[Marie Curie]], [[Albert Einstein]], [[Thomas Edison]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Nikola Tesla]]&amp;nbsp;– to identify commonalities in their capabilities, motives, personalities, and experiences. These characteristics are then integrated with the research on innovation and creativity to show how they might influence breakthrough idea generation and extreme persistence.

==Reception==
{{Over-quotation|section|date=October 2018}}

The ''[[Financial Times]]'' reviewer wrote,
{{quote|Quirky is a business book that lives up to its title. In part, Melissa Schilling has produced an entertaining and enlightening romp through the lives of eight "breakthrough innovators", exploring their remarkable abilities, personalities and motives&amp;nbsp;... The author deftly draws out some of the other quirky characteristics that these innovators shared. Perhaps the most significant was that, with the notable exception of Benjamin Franklin, they all had a sense of separateness, which created the space for original thinking&amp;nbsp;... The more intriguing point, with which Ms Schilling concludes, is that breakthrough innovation in science does not always come from people who have pursued a "typical" scientific path. That makes it all the more imperative to broaden educational opportunities, allow non-scientists to access scientific resources and expertise, and give free rein to the quirky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/c05d1d2c-22c3-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11|title=Quirky by Melissa Schilling -- a mix of management theory and biography|last=Thornhill|first=J.|date=2018|work=Financial Times|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Joe Culley at ''[[The Irish Times]]'' writes, "Schilling's prose is clear and largely jargon-free, and the individual profiles are excellent."
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/quirky-by-melissa-a-schilling-1.3504350|title=Quirky by Melissa Schilling,|last=Culley|first=J.|date=2018|work=Irish Times|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reviewer in ''[[Strategy + Business]]'' writes,
{{quote|The approach Schilling takes with ''Quirky'' is a variant of the case study method&amp;nbsp;– instead of companies, the cases here are the lives of great inventors. She examines their lives to uncover the common personality traits and "foibles" that helped them see what others did not&amp;nbsp;...

Schilling has a nice eye for the telling detail, and shares the stories of these well-known innovators' lives with economy and precision.&amp;nbsp;...

Much of this model seems intuitively correct. But Schilling's sample size is so small that it's hard to know if the conclusions she draws from that sample about the nature of serial innovation would hold up to closer scrutiny&amp;nbsp;...

In fact, the real paradox of Schilling's work is that even though it looks at completely extraordinary people, it may be most valuable for what it tells us about how organizations can harness the innovative power of ordinary people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.strategy-business.com/article/The-Quirky-Secrets-of-the-Worlds-Greatest-Innovators?gko=ef650|title=The quirky secrets of the world's greatest innovators,|last=Surowiecki|first=J.|date=2018|work=Strategy + Business|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Innovation &amp; Tech Today, Charles Warner writes,
{{quote|In Quirky, Dr. Schilling studies the minds, characteristics, innovations, and learning processes of eight women and men who represent cornerstones in American and global innovation over the past 250 years: Albert Einstein, Elon Musk, Nikola Tesla, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, Marie Curie, Steve Jobs, and Dean Kamen. In so doing, she opens up the larger relationship between innovation and genius, while also pointing out some of the challenges in society and education today that might impact our future innovators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://innotechtoday.com/author-melissa-schilling/|title=Author Melissa Schilling breaks down what it takes to be a genius|last=Warner|first=C.|date=2018|work=Innovation &amp; Tech Today|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Stephanie Orellana writes,
{{quote|Quirky is an entertaining read, and not only because it summarizes biographical information about several very interesting people and includes anecdotes about their own thoughts on their work and lives. The book also offers insights into aspects of these innovators' characters, personalities, and working styles that reveal both opportunities and challenges for those of us seeking to improve our innovation capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/08956308.2018.1471280|title=Review of Quirky: The remarkable story of the traits, foibles, and genius of breakthrough innovators who changed the world|last=Orellana|first=Stephanie|date=2018|work=Research-Technology Management|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A reviewer in the ''International Journal of Innovation Management'' writes,
{{quote|It's a bold and impressive book with some challenging ideas about how we might learn from these people despite their being different. Well-researched and rigorous in approach the book draws on a wealth of material so that each biographical sketch gives us a rounded view of the people involved. As mini-biographies they are fascinating&amp;nbsp;– not to say sometimes a little disturbing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S1363919618800026|title=,|last=|first=|date=2018|work=International Journal of Innovation Management|}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Department of Social and Decision Sciences''' ('''SDS''') is an interdisciplinary academic department within the [[Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences]] at [[Carnegie Mellon University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Social and Decision Sciences-Carnegie Mellon University|url=http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Social and Decision Sciences is headquartered in Porter Hall in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] and is led by Department Head Linda C. Babcock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=
Linda Babcock To Head Department of Social and Decision Sciences|url=http://www.cmu.edu/news/stories/archives/2015/june/babcock-named-dept-head.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; SDS has a world-class reputation{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} for research and education programs in decision-making in [[public policy]], [[economics]], [[management]], and the behavioral [[social sciences]].

==History==

The Department of Social Sciences grew out of the social science programs in the [[Margaret Morrison Carnegie College]]. The formal department was established in 1976, as part of the [[Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences]] under Dean [[John Patrick Crecine]] with approval from [[Heinz College]] Dean Otto Davis, which previously housed the program. The department was staffed by political scientists, sociologists, and economists from within the Dietrich College, the Heinz College, and the [[Tepper School of Business]]. In the 1980s, the department was led by Patrick D. Larkey and developed the undergraduate information systems program which became a huge success, eventually being spun off into an independent interdisciplinary program in the Dietrich College. In 1985, [[Robyn Dawes]] joined the department and began to re-focus it into its current form and expertise in behavioral decision-making and caused it to be renamed as the Department of Social and Decision Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History-Social and Decision Sciences-Carnegie Mellon University|url=http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/history/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225181641/http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/history/index.html|archivedate=2013-12-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carnegie Mellon's Institute for [[Politics]] and [[Grand strategy|Strategy]] was spun off of the department in 2015.

==Education==

The department runs highly regarded{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} undergraduate [[bachelor of science]] programs in [[decision science|Decision Science]] and [[Policy]] and [[Management]] and a [[bachelor of arts]] program in [[Behavioral economics|Behavioral Economics, Policy, and Organizations]] as well as minors in Decision Science and Policy and Management. Further, SDS is a partner in various interdisciplinary undergraduate programs such as the [[Sociology]] minor, Environmental Policy program, and the Quantitative Social Science Scholars program. At the [[master's degree]] level, SDS partners with several other colleges and departments for the Engineering and Technology Innovation Management program. The graduate [[PhD]] program allows doctoral students options in Social and Decision Sciences, Behavioral Decision Research (BDR) as well as a joint PhDs in Behavioral Decision Research and Psychology with the Department of Psychology, [[Behavioral targeting|Behavioral Marketing]] and Decision Research and [[Behavioral Economics]] with the [[Tepper School of Business]], and a joint [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]]-PhD Medical Scientist Training program with the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine]]. All students are trained in [[policy analysis]] and [[research methods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education-Social and Decision Sciences - Carnegie Mellon University|url=http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/education/index.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226095307/http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/education/index.html|archivedate=2013-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  SDS is also closely associated with its spin-off programs: the undergraduate [[Information Systems]] program and the Institute for Politics and Strategy.

==Research==

The department's primary strength lies in interdisciplinary research, particularly in the intersection of politics and sociology with economics, psychology and human decision making. [[Statistics]], [[microeconomics]], rational [[decision theory]] and [[game theory]] are among the many areas of specialization. SDS faculty are very involved in interdisciplinary research throughout the university, and are drawn from fields as diverse as [[economics]], [[psychology]], [[sociology]], [[history]], [[management science]], and [[political science]].  SDS is affiliated with several labs and centers:
[[File:CMU Research to Go.jpg|thumb|right|Data Truck serving researchers in the Department of Social and Decision Sciences]]
*Behavioral Economics and Decision Research Policy Lab&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bedrpolicy.org/ Behavioral Economics and Decision Research Policy Lab]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Center for Behavioral and Decision Research&lt;ref&gt;[https://cbdr.cmu.edu/ Center for Behavioral and Decision Research]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Center for Risk Perception and Communication&lt;ref&gt;[http://sds.hss.cmu.edu/risk/ Center for Risk Perception and Communication]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hss.cmu.edu/departments/sds/ddmlab/ Dynamic Decision Making Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the Center for Behavioral Decision Research, SDS manages the Data Truck and managed the Carnegie Mellon Research Cafe. The Data Truck is a mobile behavioral science lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Behavioral and Decision Research - Data Truck|url=http://cbdr.cmu.edu/datatruck/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226095313/http://cbdr.cmu.edu/datatruck/|archivedate=2013-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Research Cafe was a cafe located in [[downtown Pittsburgh]] and was designed to perform behavioral research outside of the student population on the main Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh campus where the SDS labs are located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Behavioral Cafe|url=http://www.cmu.edu/homepage/health/2010/spring/behavioral-cafe.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cafe is now closed.

==Rankings==

In 2006, an [[Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] study gave four of five stars to the graduate program in prescriptive decision making and five stars in descriptive decision making. These two ratings tied the department for first place among decision science programs in the United States with [[Duke University]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Evaluating Academic Programs: With Applications to U.S. Graduate Decision Science Programs|ssrn=939170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Faculty==

SDS is home to some of the world's top faculty{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} in the fields of [[decision science]], [[decision support systems]], [[behavioral economics]], [[organizational behavior]], [[Risk analysis (business)|risk analysis]], [[management science]], and complex social systems.  Some notable faculty members (both current and past) include [[Baruch Fischhoff]], Paul Fischbeck, [[Robyn Dawes]], [[George Loewenstein]], Cleotilde Gonzalez, [[Jennifer Lerner]], [[Kathleen Carley]], [[David Krackhardt]], [[Steven Klepper]], Linda C. Babcock, Lee Branstetter, [[David A. Hounshell]], William Keech, John H. Miller, Mark Kamlet, Roberto Weber, [[Herbert A. Simon]], [[Jendayi Frazer]], [[Kiron Skinner]], [[Sara Kiesler]], [[John Patrick Crecine]], [[Cristina Bicchieri]], [[Joseph Born Kadane]], [[Daniel M. Oppenheimer]], Patrick D. Larkey, and Otto Davis. The current faculty consists of 20 full-time members with additional associated and adjunct faculty, staff, and fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=People-Social and Decision Sciences - Carnegie Mellon University|url=http://www.cmu.edu/dietrich/sds/people/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition the department works closely with the departments of [[Engineering and Public Policy]], Psychology, History, and Statistics and Data Science, as well as the [[Tepper School of Business]], [[Heinz College]], and the undergraduate Information Systems program. Many SDS faculty have joint appointments in these departments.

* 1665&amp;nbsp;— In his book [[Micrographia]] [[Robert Hooke]] compares [[petrified wood]] to wood, concludes that petrified wood formed from wood soaked in mineral-rich water, and argues fossils like [[Ammonite]] shells, were produced the same way, sparking debate over the organic origin of fossils and the possibility of [[extinction]]. &lt;ref name="Rudwick45_68"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Meaning of Fossils: Episodes in the History of Palaeontology|first=M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21045">In [[mathematics education]], the '''Van Hiele model''' is a theory that describes how students learn geometry. The theory originated in 1957 in the doctoral dissertations of Dina van Hiele-Geldof and Pierre van Hiele (wife and husband) at [[Utrecht University]], in the [[Netherlands]]. The Soviets did research on the theory in the 1960s and integrated their findings into their curricula. American researchers did several large studies on the van Hiele theory in the late 1970s and early 1980s, concluding that students' low van Hiele levels made it difficult to succeed in proof-oriented geometry courses and advising better preparation at earlier grade levels.&lt;ref name=Chicago&gt;{{Citation | last = Usiskin | first = Zalman | title = Van Hiele Levels and Achievement in Secondary School Geometry | year = 1982 | place = University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brooklyn_College_Project&gt;{{Citation | last = Fuys | title = The Van Hiele Model of Thinking in Geometry Among Adolescents | year = 1988 | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre van Hiele published ''Structure and Insight'' in 1986, further describing his theory. The model has greatly influenced geometry curricula throughout the world through emphasis on analyzing properties and classification of shapes at early grade levels. In the United States, the theory has influenced the geometry strand of the [[Principles and Standards for School Mathematics|Standards]] published by the [[National Council of Teachers of Mathematics]] and the new [[Common Core State Standards Initiative|Common Core Standards]].

==Van Hiele levels==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The student learns by rote to operate with [mathematical] relations that he does not understand, and of which he has not seen the origin…. Therefore the system of relations is an independent construction having no rapport with other experiences of the child. This means that the student knows only what has been taught to him and what has been deduced from it. He has not learned to establish connections between the system and the sensory world. He will not know how to apply what he has learned in a new situation. - ''Pierre van Hiele, 1959''&lt;ref name=VH&gt;{{Citation | last = van Hiele | first = Pierre | title = The Child’s Thought and Geometry | place = Brooklyn, NY | publisher = City University of New York | origyear = 1959 | year = 1985 | pages = 243–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The best known part of the van Hiele model are the five levels which the van Hieles postulated to describe how children learn to reason in geometry. Students cannot be expected to prove geometric theorems until they have built up an extensive understanding of the systems of relationships between geometric ideas. These systems cannot be learned by rote, but must be developed through familiarity by experiencing numerous examples and counterexamples, the various properties of geometric figures, the relationships between the properties, and how these properties are ordered. The five levels postulated by the van Hieles describe how students advance through this understanding.

The five van Hiele levels are sometimes misunderstood to be descriptions of how students understand shape classification, but the levels actually describe the way that students reason about shapes and other geometric ideas. Pierre van Hiele noticed that his students tended to "plateau" at certain points in their understanding of geometry and he identified these plateau points as ''levels''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freudenthal|first=Hans|title=Report on Methods of Initiation into Geometry|year=1958|publisher=J. B. Wolters|location=Groningen, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, these levels are a product of experience and instruction rather than age. This is in contrast to [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s theory of cognitive development, which is age-dependent. A child must have enough experiences (classroom or otherwise) with these geometric ideas to move to a higher level of sophistication. Through rich experiences, children can reach Level 2 in elementary school. Without such experiences, many adults (including teachers) remain in Level 1 all their lives, even if they take a formal geometry course in secondary school.&lt;ref name=Mayberry/&gt; The levels are as follows:

[[File:Van Hiele triangle examples.png|thumb|Children at Level 0 will often say all of these shapes are triangles, except E, which is too "skinny". They may say F is "upside down". Students at Level 1 will recognize that only E and F are valid triangles.]]
'''Level 0. Visualization''': At this level, the focus of a child's thinking is on individual shapes, which the child is learning to classify by judging their holistic appearance. Children simply say, "That is a circle," usually without further description. Children identify prototypes of basic geometrical figures ([[triangle]], [[circle]], [[square (geometry)|square]]). These visual prototypes are then used to identify other shapes. A shape is a circle because it looks like a sun; a shape is a rectangle because it looks like a door or a box; and so on. A square seems to be a different sort of shape than a rectangle, and a rhombus does not look like other parallelograms, so these shapes are classified completely separately in the child’s mind. Children view figures holistically without analyzing their properties. If a shape does not sufficiently resemble its prototype, the child may reject the classification. Thus, children at this stage might balk at calling a thin, wedge-shaped triangle (with sides 1, 20, 20 or sides 20, 20, 39) a "triangle", because it's so different in shape from an [[equilateral triangle]], which is the usual prototype for "triangle". If the horizontal base of the triangle is on top and the opposing vertex below, the child may recognize it as a triangle, but claim it is "upside down". Shapes with rounded or incomplete sides may be accepted as "triangles" if they bear a holistic resemblance to an equilateral triangle.&lt;ref name=Burger/&gt; Squares are called "diamonds" and not recognized as squares if their sides are oriented at 45° to the horizontal. Children at this level often believe something is true based on a single example.

'''Level 1. Analysis''': At this level, the shapes become bearers of their properties. The objects of thought are classes of shapes, which the child has learned to analyze as having properties. A person at this level might say, "A square has 4 equal sides and 4 equal angles. Its diagonals are congruent and perpendicular, and they bisect each other." The properties are more important than the appearance of the shape. If a figure is sketched on the blackboard and the teacher claims it is intended to have congruent sides and angles, the students accept that it is a square, even if it is poorly drawn. Properties are not yet ordered at this level. Children can discuss the properties of the basic figures and recognize them by these properties, but generally do not allow categories to overlap because they understand each property in isolation from the others. For example, they will still insist that "a [[square (geometry)|square]] is not a [[rectangle]]." (They may introduce extraneous properties to support such beliefs, such as defining a rectangle as a shape with one pair of sides longer than the other pair of sides.) Children begin to notice many properties of shapes, but do not see the relationships between the properties; therefore they cannot reduce the list of properties to a concise definition with necessary and sufficient conditions. They usually reason [[inductive reasoning|inductively]] from several examples, but cannot yet reason [[deductive reasoning|deductively]] because they do not understand how the properties of shapes are related.

'''Level 2. Abstraction''': At this level, properties are ordered. The objects of thought are geometric properties, which the student has learned to connect deductively. The student understands that properties are related and one set of properties may imply another property. Students can reason with simple arguments about geometric figures. A student at this level might say, "[[Isosceles triangle]]s are symmetric, so their base angles must be equal." Learners recognize the relationships between types of shapes. They recognize that all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares, and they understand why squares are a type of rectangle based on an understanding of the properties of each. They can tell whether it is possible or not to have a rectangle that is, for example, also a rhombus. They understand [[necessary and sufficient condition]]s and can write concise definitions. However, they do not yet understand the intrinsic meaning of deduction. They cannot follow a complex argument, understand the place of definitions, or grasp the need for axioms, so they cannot yet understand the role of formal geometric proofs.

'''Level 3. Deduction''': Students at this level understand the meaning of deduction. The object of thought is deductive reasoning (simple proofs), which the student learns to combine to form a system of formal proofs ([[Euclidean geometry]]). Learners can construct geometric proofs at a secondary school level and understand their meaning. They understand the role of undefined terms, definitions, [[axiom]]s and [[theorem]]s in Euclidean geometry. However, students at this level believe that axioms and definitions are fixed, rather than arbitrary, so they cannot yet conceive of [[non-Euclidean geometry]]. Geometric ideas are still understood as objects in the Euclidean plane.

'''Level 4. Rigor''': At this level, geometry is understood at the level of a mathematician. Students understand that definitions are arbitrary and need not actually refer to any concrete realization. The object of thought is deductive geometric systems, for which the learner compares [[axiomatic system]]s. Learners can study [[non-Euclidean geometries]] with understanding. People can understand the discipline of geometry and how it differs philosophically from non-mathematical studies.

American researchers renumbered the levels as 1 to 5 so that they could add a "Level 0" which described young children who could not identify shapes at all. Both numbering systems are still in use. Some researchers also give different names to the levels.

==Properties of the levels==
The van Hiele levels have five properties:

1. '''Fixed sequence''': the levels are hierarchical. Students cannot "skip" a level.&lt;ref name=Mayberry&gt;{{Citation | last = Mayberry | title = The Van Hiele Levels of Geometric Thought in Undergraduate Preservice Teachers | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 58–69 | year = 1983 | doi=10.2307/748797}}&lt;/ref&gt; The van Hieles claim that much of the difficulty experienced by geometry students is due to being taught at the Deduction level when they have not yet achieved the Abstraction level.

2. '''Adjacency''': properties which are intrinsic at one level become extrinsic at the next. (The properties are there at the Visualization level, but the student is not yet consciously aware of them until the Analysis level. Properties are in fact related at the Analysis level, but students are not yet explicitly aware of the relationships.)

3. '''Distinction''': each level has its own linguistic symbols and network of relationships. The meaning of a linguistic symbol is more than its explicit definition; it includes the experiences the speaker associates with the given symbol. What may be "correct" at one level is not necessarily correct at another level. At Level 0 a square is something that looks like a box. At Level 2 a square is a special type of rectangle. Neither of these is a correct description of the meaning of "square" for someone reasoning at Level 1. If the student is simply handed the definition and its associated properties, without being allowed to develop meaningful experiences with the concept, the student will not be able to apply this knowledge beyond the situations used in the lesson.

4. '''Separation''': a teacher who is reasoning at one level speaks a different "language" from a student at a lower level, preventing understanding. When a teacher speaks of a "square" she or he means a special type of rectangle. A student at Level 0 or 1 will not have the same understanding of this term. The student does not understand the teacher, and the teacher does not understand how the student is reasoning, frequently concluding that the student's answers are simply "wrong". The van Hieles believed this property was one of the main reasons for failure in geometry. Teachers believe they are expressing themselves clearly and logically, but their Level 3 or 4 reasoning is not understandable to students at lower levels, nor do the teachers understand their students’ thought processes. Ideally, the teacher and students need shared experiences behind their language.

5. '''Attainment''': The van Hieles recommended five phases for guiding students from one level to another on a given topic:&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.rice.edu/~rusmp/geometrymodule/PowerPoint/vanHiele.ppt The van Hiele Model of Geometric Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Information or inquiry'': students get acquainted with the material and begin to discover its structure. Teachers present a new idea and allow the students to work with the new concept. By having students experience the structure of the new concept in a similar way, they can have meaningful conversations about it. (A teacher might say, "This is a rhombus. Construct some more rhombi on your paper.")
*''Guided or directed orientation'': students do tasks that enable them to explore implicit relationships. Teachers propose activities of a fairly guided nature that allow students to become familiar with the properties of the new concept which the teacher desires them to learn. (A teacher might ask, "What happens when you cut out and fold the rhombus along a diagonal? the other diagonal?" and so on, followed by discussion.)
*''Explicitation'': students express what they have discovered and vocabulary is introduced. The students’ experiences are linked to shared linguistic symbols. The van Hieles believe it is more profitable to learn vocabulary ''after'' students have had an opportunity to become familiar with the concept. The discoveries are made as explicit as possible. (A teacher might say, "Here are the properties we have noticed and some associated vocabulary for the things you discovered. Let's discuss what these mean.")
*''Free orientation'': students do more complex tasks enabling them to master the network of relationships in the material. They know the properties being studied, but need to develop fluency in navigating the network of relationships in various situations. This type of activity is much more open-ended than the guided orientation. These tasks will not have set procedures for solving them. Problems may be more complex and require more free exploration to find solutions. (A teacher might say, "How could you construct a rhombus given only two of its sides?" and other problems for which students have not learned a fixed procedure.)
*''Integration'': students summarize what they have learned and commit it to memory. The teacher may give the students an overview of everything they have learned. It is important that the teacher not present any new material during this phase, but only a summary of what has already been learned. The teacher might also give an assignment to remember the principles and vocabulary learned for future work, possibly through further exercises. (A teacher might say, "Here is a summary of what we have learned. Write this in your notebook and do these exercises for homework.") Supporters of the van Hiele model point out that traditional instruction often involves only this last phase, which explains why students do not master the material.

For Dina van Hiele-Geldof's doctoral dissertation, she conducted a teaching experiment with 12-year-olds in a Montessori secondary school in the Netherlands. She reported that by using this method she was able to raise students' levels from Level 0 to 1 in 20 lessons and from Level 1 to 2 in 50 lessons.

==Research==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Using van Hiele levels as the criterion, almost half of geometry students are placed in a course in which their chances of being successful are only 50-50. — ''Zalman Usiskin, 1982''&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Researchers found that the van Hiele levels of American students are low. European researchers have found similar results for European students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gutiérrez | first = Ángel |author2=Jaime, A.  | title = On the assessment of the Van Hiele levels of reasoning | journal = Focus on Learning Problems in Mathematics | volume = 20 | issue = 2/3 | pages = 27–46 | year = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many, perhaps most, American students do not achieve the Deduction level even after successfully completing a proof-oriented high school geometry course,&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; probably because material is learned by rote, as the van Hieles claimed.&lt;ref name=Mayberry/&gt; This appears to be because American high school geometry courses assume students are already at least at Level 2, ready to move into Level 3, whereas many high school students are still at Level 1, or even Level 0.&lt;ref name=Chicago/&gt; See the Fixed Sequence property above.

===Criticism and modifications of the theory===
The levels are discontinuous, as defined in the properties above, but researchers have debated as to just how discrete the levels actually are. Studies have found that many children reason at multiple levels, or intermediate levels, which appears to be in contradiction to the theory.&lt;ref name=Burger&gt;{{Citation | last = Burger | last2 = Shaughnessy | title = Characterizing the van Hiele Levels of Development in Geometry | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 17 | issue = 1 | pages = 31–48 | year = 1986 | doi=10.2307/749317}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children also advance through the levels at different rates for different concepts, depending on their exposure to the subject. They may therefore reason at one level for certain shapes, but at another level for other shapes.&lt;ref name=Mayberry/&gt;

Some researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Clements | first1 = Douglas H. | last2 = Swaminathan | first2 = S. | last3 =  Hannibal | first3 =  M. A. Z. | last4 = Sarama | first4 =  Julie | title = Young Children's Concepts of Shape | journal = Journal for Research in Mathematics Education | volume = 30 | issue = 2 | pages = 192–212 | publisher = NCTM | year = 1999 | doi=10.2307/749610}}&lt;/ref&gt; have found that many children at the Visualization level do not reason in a completely holistic fashion, but may focus on a single attribute, such as the equal sides of a square or the roundness of a circle. They have proposed renaming this level the ''syncretic'' level. Other modifications have also been suggested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Battista | first = Michael | title = Understanding Geometry for a Changing World  | place = Reston, VA | publisher = National Council of Teachers of Mathematics | volume = Seventy-first yearbook | year = 2009 | chapter = Highlights of Research on Learning School Geometry | pages = 91–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as defining sub-levels between the main levels, though none of these modifications have yet gained popularity.

[[File:Shallow water wave.gif|thumb|right|400 px]]
When [[ocean surface wave|waves]] travel into areas of '''shallow water''', they begin to be affected by the [[ocean]] bottom.  The free [[orbital motion]] of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position.  As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape.  After the [[breaking wave|wave breaks]], it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies.

'''Wendy Suzuki''' is a Professor of Neural Science and Psychology at the [[New York University]] Center for Neural Science and popular science communicator. She is the author of ''Healthy Brain, Happy Life: A Personal Program to Activate Your Brain and Do Everything Better''.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

== Education and early career ==
Suzuki received her undergraduate degree in physiology and human anatomy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1987. There, she worked with [[Marian Diamond]], whom she met after taking her course called "The Brain and its Potential."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.livescience.com/50997-exercise-improves-the-brain.html|title=Want a Better Brain? Get Moving (Podcast)|work=Live Science|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rd.com/true-stories/inspiring/why-i-study-memory/|title=Why This Neuroscientist Studies Memory {{!}} Reader's Digest|date=2015-09-03|work=Reader's Digest|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond's work opened the door into studying [[neuroplasticity]] with evidence that the brain could change in response to its environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.berkeley.edu/2017/07/28/marian-diamond-known-for-studies-of-einsteins-brain-dies-at-90/|title=Marian Diamond, known for studies of Einstein’s brain, dies at 90|date=2017-07-28|work=Berkeley News|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an interest in memory and brain plasticity, Suzuki then went on to receive her Ph.D. in [[Neuroscience]] from the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1993 under the mentorship of [[David Amaral]], Stuart Zola, and [[Larry Squire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/events/growingupinscience/unofficial.html#Suzuki|title=Growing up in science|website=www.cns.nyu.edu|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, her work uncovered the importance of the [[Perirhinal cortex|perirhinal]] and [[Parahippocampal cortex|parahippocampal corticies]] in preserving our long-term memories. Her doctoral thesis won her the [[Society for Neuroscience]]'s [[Donald B. Lindsley]] Prize in the field of [[behavioral neuroscience]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://research.shanghai.nyu.edu/centers-and-institutes/brain/people/wendy-suzuki|title=Wendy Suzuki {{!}} NYU Shanghai|website=research.shanghai.nyu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career and research==
Suzuki completed her [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]]'s [[National Institute of Mental Health]] between 1993 and 1998. There she worked under the mentorship of [[Robert Desimone]], studying how the brain is able to remember where objects are in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=W. A.|last2=Miller|first2=E. K.|last3=Desimone|first3=R.|date=August 1997|title=Object and place memory in the macaque entorhinal cortex|journal=Journal of Neurophysiology|volume=78|issue=2|pages=1062–1081|doi=10.1152/jn.1997.78.2.1062|issn=0022-3077|pmid=9307135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki joined the faculty at [[New York University]]'s Center for Neural Science in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nyu.edu/students/getting-involved/leadership-and-service/leadership-studies-development/engage/events/past-events/nyu-leadership-week/schedule/thursday--october-20/wendy-suzuki.html|title=Wendy Suzuki {{!}} NYU Faculty|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cns.nyu.edu/corefaculty/Suzuki.php|title=NYU/CNS : Faculty : Core Faculty : Wendy A. Suzuki|website=www.cns.nyu.edu|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her research interests center on [[neuroplasticity]] and how the brain is able to change and adapt over the course of a person's life. Her early career research focused on the areas of the brain that play an important role in our ability to form and retain memories. More recently, she's expanded this work to study the role of [[aerobic exercise]] on potentially enhancing cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Memory and the brain ===
Suzuki's research career started with studying underlying memory. Her lab focused on the role of the [[hippocampus]], which is the part of the brain that is responsible for memory of facts and events, otherwise known as [[Declarative memory|declarative or explicit memory]]. Her research group was the first to identify major changes to patterns of neural activity in the hippocampus as subjects worked to form memories that associated unrelated objects with one another, known as "associative memories."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wirth|first=Sylvia|last2=Yanike|first2=Marianna|last3=Frank|first3=Loren M.|last4=Smith|first4=Anne C.|last5=Brown|first5=Emery N.|last6=Suzuki|first6=Wendy A.|date=2003-06-06|title=Single Neurons in the Monkey Hippocampus and Learning of New Associations|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/300/5625/1578|journal=Science|language=en|volume=300|issue=5625|pages=1578–1581|doi=10.1126/science.1084324|issn=0036-8075|pmid=12791995}}&lt;/ref&gt; They identified neural patterns associated with how the brain forms memories in a temporal order, showing the critical role of the hippocampus in how timing is incorporated into forming memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Naya|first=Yuji|last2=Suzuki|first2=Wendy A.|date=2011-08-05|title=Integrating what and when across the primate medial temporal lobe|journal=Science|volume=333|issue=6043|pages=773–776|doi=10.1126/science.1206773|issn=1095-9203|pmid=21817056}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Suzuki|first=Wendy|last2=Naya|first2=Yuji|date=2011-10-28|title=Two routes for remembering the past|journal=Cell|volume=147|issue=3|pages=493–495|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2011.10.005|issn=1097-4172|pmid=22036558}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise and the brain ===
Suzuki's research in 2018 focused on the impact of exercise on the brain. Her group is working to develop a "prescription" for the right amount of exercise to maximize brain activity for a range of purposes including; learning, aging, memory, attention, and mood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/neuroscientist-wendy-suzuki-exercise-prescription-cell-phone-2017-12|title=A neuroscientist is trying to create tailored 'exercise prescriptions' for aging to keep the brain sharp|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; To support that work, the Suzuki lab is researching the kinds of exercise that enhance cognition among adults. Her group has found evidence that acute aerobic exercise can improve [[prefrontal cortex]] activity, which is the part of the brain that contributes to personality development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Basso|first=Julia C.|last2=Shang|first2=Andrea|last3=Elman|first3=Meredith|last4=Karmouta|first4=Ryan|last5=Suzuki|first5=Wendy A.|date=November 2015|title=Acute Exercise Improves Prefrontal Cortex but not Hippocampal Function in Healthy Adults|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society: JINS|volume=21|issue=10|pages=791–801|doi=10.1017/S135561771500106X|issn=1469-7661|pmid=26581791}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki is also investigating how best to incorporate exercise to treat mood and cognitive disorders. Her group has found that a combined regimen of exercise and self-affirmation interventions can enhance the cognitive capabilities and mood of patients with [[traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Yuen Shan Christine|last2=Ashman|first2=Teresa|last3=Shang|first3=Andrea|last4=Suzuki|first4=Wendy|date=2014|title=Brief report: Effects of exercise and self-affirmation intervention after traumatic brain injury|journal=NeuroRehabilitation|volume=35|issue=1|pages=57–65|doi=10.3233/NRE-141100|issn=1878-6448|pmid=24990010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Science communication ===
Suzuki is also a popular science communicator and author of the book ''Healthy Brain, Happy Life''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.harpercollins.com/9780062366788/healthy-brain-happy-life/|title=Health Brain, Happy Life|last=Suzuki|first=Wendy|last2=Fitzpatrick|first2=Billie|publisher=Harper Collins|year=2015|isbn=978-0062366788|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hub.jhu.edu/2016/04/11/wendy-suzuki-brain-exercise/|title=For neuroscientist, learning how exercise affects the brain has been a life-changing experience|date=2016-04-11|work=The Hub|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book details her personal journey with exercise and how it has transformed her life, while discussing the underlying neuroscience of the benefits of exercise. Tour stops for the book included appearances on shows like [[CBS This Morning]], [[WNYC]], and the [[Big Think]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Neuroscientist's secrets of focus, memory and moods|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/neuroscientists-secrets-of-focus-memory-and-moods/|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wnyc.org/story/innumerable-health-benefits-exercise/|title=How Exercise Affects The Brain {{!}} The Leonard Lopate Show {{!}} WNYC|work=WNYC|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bigthink.com/experts/wendy-suzuki|title=Wendy Suzuki|website=Big Think|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzuki has regularly appeared on [[Huffington post|HuffPost]], sharing advances in her research on the link between exercise and brain activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wendy-suzuki-exercise_us_58ffc719e4b0af6d718981ca|title=Working Out Could Have Some Serious Benefits For Your Brain|date=2017-04-26|website=HuffPost|language=en|access-date=2018-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suzuki has told stories for shows like [[The Moth]] about how she first came to say "I love you" to her parents as an adult and [[The Story Collider]] about how an exercise in acting challenged her beliefs about love and attraction in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://themoth.org/storytellers/wendy-suzuki|title=The Moth {{!}} The Art and Craft of Storytelling|website=The Moth|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.storycollider.org/stories/2017/7/27/magnetism-stories-about-attraction|title=Magnetism: Stories about attraction|work=The Story Collider|access-date=2018-08-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Worlds Beginning''''' is a 1944 speculative fiction novel by [[Robert Ardrey]]. It proposed a new economic model and system of corporate ownership.&lt;ref name=Worlds&gt;Ardrey, Robert. ''Worlds Beginning.'' New York: Duell, Sloan &amp; Pearce. 244 p. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' was published one year after ''[[God and Texas]]'', Ardrey's one-act play about the [[Battle of the Alamo]], and two years before the production of ''[[Jeb (play)|Jeb]]'', Ardrey's [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights]] play.

==Synopsis &amp; Themes==
The ''[[New York Times]]'' gave the following synopsis of the novel:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Twenty years from now a retired reporter takes time off from cultivating his petunias and his perennial border to write of his own experiences during the dark days after peace, when American civilization seemed about to crack up for good. The "myth of internationalism" had infected big business with a bad case of economic imperialism. But synthetic revolutions in industrial chemistry soon fixed things so foreign nations didn't need a thing we could sell them. Depression, unemployment, bankruptcies, hatred and fear plagued the country. The business-controlled Government was swept out of office by a labor popular front. But things got worse instead of better. ... [W]hile Americans everywhere sank into fatalistic apathy, a new hope was born in the desert town of Indian Pass in Texas, where the Trans-Pecos Chemical Commonwealth was making a plastic substitute for copper wire that was much cheaper and much better than copper. The significance lay in a new concept of ownership. ... The commonwealth idea got rid of all owners of property and also paid no wages, only shares in the earnings. The employees had no participation in the concern. The harder they worked and the more money the commonwealth made, the larger was their share of the earnings. Every foreman was subject to dismissal by a majority vote of the workers under him. Any lazy or inefficient worker was thrown out on his ear by his comrades. Efficiency was wonderful, morale perfect.&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

''Worlds Beginning'' also includes a one-page forward by the author in which he discusses his reasons for writing the novel. Included is his sense that during dark times there is hope for the future, but only if those concerned are willing to fight for it. This is a theme consistently developed throughout his work, including most notably in [[Thunder Rock (play)|Thunder Rock]], Ardrey's most famous play.&lt;ref&gt;Ardrey, Robert. "Forward."

"America Remade—On a New Yankee Pattern." ''The New York Times,'' 24 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The second, by [[Orville Prescott]], appeared on September 27.&lt;ref name=Prescott&gt;Prescott, Orville. "Books of the Times." ''The New York Times,'' 27 September 1944. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Both offered praise.

Prescott asserted "Mr. Ardrey has written a novel with as thumping a thesis as Bellamy's 'Looking Backward,' or any other celebrated outlines of Utopia."&lt;ref name=Prescott /&gt; Baker wrote of the book that it was: "fresh, tough, cocky, exciting, shot through with the exuberance of discovery. However he does it, with stiletto or meat cleaver, ad copywriter's slogans or heroic analogies, reiteration either plain or fancy, Mr. Ardrey clears a path for the reader through the jungle of economics and brings him out, flushed and panting, to a new world in the making."&lt;ref name=Baker /&gt;

In 1948 ''Worlds Beginning'' was included in [[Everett F. Bleiler|Everett F. Bleiler's]] ''The Checklist of Fantastic Literature.''
