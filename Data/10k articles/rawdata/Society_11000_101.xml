In the past, the FBI and Royal Canadian Mounted Police also were members.

The organization was created in 2008.
The [[United States]]' [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] is the lead agency in the organization.
The co-deputy agencies are the [[United States Treasury]] and the [[United States Department of Defense]].  Other participating agencies include the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]], the [[United States Federal Bureau of Investigation]], the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]], and the [[United States Internal Revenue Service]].

The Afghan Threat Finance Cell was set up at the initiative of General [[David Petraeus]], when he was promoted to command of [[CentCom]], based on the experience of the earlier [[Iraqi Threat Finance Cell]], that had reported to him when he was in command in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref name=SmallWarsJournal&gt;

 |quote=Gen. Petraeus at this time had moved from commander in Iraq to commander of CENTCOM writ large and saw as one of his priorities the establishment of a threat finance cell in Afghanistan akin to the ITFC. When he was asked at a House of Representatives hearing in April of 2009 to comment on how forces in Afghanistan were combating threat finance networks, he responded that the key would be getting the Afghan Threat Finance Cell set up because of the ITFC’s success in Iraq.

Tracking both illicit and legitimate financial transactions led to 27 approved targets to be named on the "[[Joint Prioritized Effects List]]".&lt;ref name=KetkNbc2012-02-10/&gt;  The Joint Prioritized Effects List is colloquially called the "kill or capture list".  Once an individual is named on this list, special forces are authorized to covertly target and raid that individual's home or workplace.

In February 2011, [[Dexter Filkins]], writing in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', reported:&lt;ref name=TheNewYorker2011-02-14/&gt;

Culture consists of the social behaviour and norms in human societies transmitted through social learning.&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011/&gt; Arthropods play many roles in human culture, including as food, in art, in stories, and in mythology and religion. Many of these [[Insects in culture|concern insects]], which are important both economically and symbolically, from the work of [[honeybee]]s to the [[scarab (artifact)|scarabs]] of [[Ancient Egypt]]. Other [[arthropods]] with cultural significance include [[crustaceans]] such as [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, and [[crayfish]], which are popular subjects in art, especially [[still life]]s, and [[arachnids]] such as [[spider]]s and [[scorpion]]s, whose [[venom]] has medical applications. The [[Cancer (astrology)|crab]] and the [[Scorpio (astrology)|scorpion]] are [[astrology|astrological]] signs of the [[zodiac]].

[[Crustacean]]s are an important source of food, providing nearly 10,700,000&amp;nbsp;[[ton]]s in 2007; the vast majority of this output is of [[Decapoda|decapods]]: [[crab]]s, [[lobster]]s, [[shrimp]]s, [[crayfish]], and [[Dendrobranchiata|prawns]].

Other commercially important [[taxon|taxa]] include ''[[Portunus pelagicus]]'', several species in the genus ''[[Chionoecetes]]'', the blue crab (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]''), [[Charybdis (genus)|''Charybdis'' spp.]], ''[[Edible crab|Cancer pagurus]]'', the [[Dungeness crab]] (''Metacarcinus magister''), and ''[[Scylla serrata]]'', each of which yields more than 20,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/figis/servlet/TabLandArea?tb_ds=Capture&amp;tb_mode=TABLE&amp;tb_act=SELECT&amp;tb_grp=COUNTRY |title=Global Capture Production 1950-2004 |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=August 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lobsters are caught using [[lobster trap|baited, one-way traps]] with a colour-coded marker buoy to mark cages. Lobster is fished in water between {{convert|1|and|500|fathom|m|sigfig=1|disp=flip}}, although some lobsters live at {{convert|2000|fathom|m|disp=flip}}. Cages are of plastic-coated galvanised steel or wood. A lobster fisher may tend as many as 2,000 traps. Around 2000, owing to overfishing and high demand, lobster [[aquaculture]] expanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.uwphoto.no/articles_folder/lobster_farming_in_Norway.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031004033227/http://articles.uwphoto.no/articles_folder/lobster_farming_in_Norway.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2003-10-04 |author1=Asbjørn Drengstig |author2=Tormod Drengstig |author3=Tore S.

[[File:Fried spiders Skuon Cambodia.jpg|thumb|Cooked [[tarantula]] spiders are a delicacy in [[Cambodia]].]]

Spiders are sometimes used as food. Cooked [[tarantula]] spiders are considered a delicacy in [[Cambodia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Ray, N. | year=2002 | title=Lonely Planet Cambodia | publisher=Lonely Planet Publications| isbn=1-74059-111-9 | page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Piaroa]] Indians of southern Venezuela&amp;nbsp;– provided the highly irritant hairs, the spiders' main defence system, are removed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Weil, C. |title=Fierce Food |year=2006 |publisher=Plume |isbn=0-452-28700-6 |url=http://www.budgettravel.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2006/10/24/AR2006102400797.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511192407/http://www.budgettravel.com/bt-dyn/content/article/2006/10/24/AR2006102400797.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-05-11 |accessdate=2008-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In science and engineering==

Insects feature in a variety of ways in [[biomimicry]], where for example the cooling system of [[termite]] mounds has been imitated  in [[architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Termite research |url=http://www.esf.edu/efb/turner/termitePages/termiteMain.html |publisher=esf.edu |accessdate=23 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spider]] [[venom]]s may be a less polluting alternative to conventional [[pesticide]]s, as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to [[vertebrate]]s. Australian [[Australian funnel-web spider|funnel web spiders]] are a promising source, as most of the world's insect pests have had no opportunity to develop any [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to their venom, and funnel web spiders thrive in captivity and are easy to "milk". It may be possible to target specific pests by [[genetic engineering|engineering]] genes for the production of spider [[toxin]]s into [[virus]]es that infect species such as [[cotton bollworm (disambiguation)|cotton bollworm]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Spider Venom Could Yield Eco-Friendly Insecticides | publisher=National Science Foundation (USA)| url=https://www.nsf.gov/discoveries/disc_summ.jsp?cntn_id=100676&amp;org=NSF |accessdate=2008-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[Baloch people|Baloch]]''' are the majority ethnic inhabitants of the region of [[Sistan and Baluchestan Province|Balochistan]] in [[Iran]]. They speak Rakhshani [[Balochi language|Balochi]], an [[Indo-Iranian languages|Iranian language]]. They mainly inhabit mountainous terrains, which have allowed them to maintain a distinct [[cultural identity]] and resist domination by neighbouring rulers. The Baloch are predominantly Muslim, with most belonging to the [[Hanafi]] school of [[Sunni Islam]], but there are also a few number of [[Shia Islam|Shia]] in Balochistan. Approximately 25 percent of the Baloch population live in Iran: media reports indicate there are 1.5 million Baloch in Iran. The utter vast majority of the Baloch population reside in Pakistan, and a significant number i.e. 600,000 reside in southern Afghanistan. They are also spread in other [[List of countries|countries of the world]], such as the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf states]] and Europe. In Iran, the Baloch are divided into two groups: the Makorani and the Sarhadi. The cities such as [[Iranshahr (city)|Iranshahr]], [[Chabahar]], [[Nikshahr]], [[Sarbaz]], and [[Saravan, Iran|Saravan]] are known as the Makoran region, while [[Zahedan]] and [[Khash, Iran|Khash]] are known as Sarhad region.

Balochistan of Iran has been regarded as the most underdeveloped, desolate, and poorest region of the country. The government of Iran has been trying to reverse this situation by implementing new plans such as the creation of the Chabahar [[Free trade zone|Free Trade Zone]].

'''Cerro Largo''' is a municipality in the northwestern part of the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It occupies an area of 174.64&amp;nbsp;km² (67.43&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) at 28º09'0" south 54º45'0" west,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.travelmath.com/city/Cerro+Largo,+Brazil |title=The latitude and longitude of Cerro Largo, Brazil is: |date= |work= |publisher=travelmath |accessdate=9 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; at an elevation of 211&amp;nbsp;m (692&amp;nbsp;ft) above sea level. Its population {{As of|2010|lc=on}} was 15,174 inhabitants.

==Regional language==
Cerro Largo was settled soon after 1900 mostly by [[German-Brazilian|German Brazilians]] from the old German settlements on the eastern part of the state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the ''Altkolonie'' (in [[German language|German]]). [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language but [[Riograndenser Hunsrückisch]] is still spoken by many citizens in the area. It is the birthplace of São Paulo's current archbishop, Cardinal [[Odilo Scherer]]. In 2012 the state chamber of deputies voted unanimously in favor of recognizing this Germanic dialect an official historical culture good to be preserved.

'''Cheri Gaulke''' (born 1954) is a visual artist most known for her role in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|Feminist Art Movement]] in [[southern California]] in the 1970s and her current work on gay and lesbian families.&lt;ref name="gaulke1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaulke|first=Cheri|title=Cheri Gaulke, Artist|url=http://cherigaulke.wordpress.com/about/|work=Bio|accessdate=October 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She holds a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design]] and a Master of Arts degree (in Feminist Art/Education) from [[Goddard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaulke|first=Cheri|title=Cheri Gaulke, Artist|url=http://cherigaulke.wordpress.com/about/|work=Bio|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1975, Gaulke moved to [[Los Angeles]] and became involved with the [[Feminist Studio Workshop]] at the [[Woman's Building]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doin' It In Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|isbn=0-930209-22-2|pages=21–33 [22]|author=Gaulke, Cheri|contribution=1+1=3: Art and Collaboration at the WB|editor=Meg Linton and Sue Maberry|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Feminist Studio Workshop, Gaulke studied with [[Suzanne Lacy]] and focused primarily on [[performance art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doin' It In Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|isbn=0-930209-22-2|pages=193–227 [220]|author=Klein, Jennie|contribution=The Ritual Body as Pedagogical Tool: The performance Art of the Woman's Building|editor=Meg Linton and Sue Maberry|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she created a character she called Cinderella, who Gaulke describes as not conforming to any specific sex or gender role and thus "in a constant state of transformation."&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Citizen Artist: 20 Years of Art in the Public Arena|year=1998|publisher=Critical Press|author=Gaulke, Cheri|edition=Volume 1|authorlink=Acting Like Women: Performance Art of the Woman's Building|editor=Linda Frye Burnham and Steven Durland|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her solo work, Gaulke collaborated with Anne Gauldin to produce The Malta Project, in which the two performed rites related to female spirituality at [[prehistoric]] temples throughout [[Malta]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Performing Prehistory: Would you rather be a goddess or a cyborg?' Cheri Gaulke and Anne Gauldin's The Malta Project.|journal=n.paradoxa|year=2014|volume=33|pages=73–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaulke has been a co-founder of two collaborative feminist performance groups: [[Feminist Art Workers]] (1976–81), co-founded with [[Nancy Angelo]], Candace Compton, [[Vanalyne Green]], and Laurel Klick,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Woman's Building|url=http://womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm|work=Timeline|accessdate=October 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125014956/http://www.womansbuilding.org/timeline.htm#|archive-date=2011-11-25|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sisters of Survival (SOS), co-founded in 1981 with Nancy Angelo, [[Jerri Allyn]], Anne Gauldin, and Sue Maberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Moravec|first=Michelle|title=Topographies of Anti-Nuclear Art in Late Cold War Los Angeles|journal=International Journal of Regional and Local History|volume=6|issue=1|pages=58–71|doi=10.1179/jrl.2010.6.1.58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Gaulke has moved away from performance, the feminist art strategies that she helped to innovate in the 1970s in southern California continue in her work.  Her art continues to be a vehicle for social commentary and as a way to tell the stories of individuals and groups under-represented in society.  She works in a variety of media, but mostly video, [[installation art]], [[artists' book]]s, and [[public art]]. Such projects have included a video in collaboration with lesbian and gay teens, a photographic wall installation about lesbian and gay families, a [[video installation]] with Latino teenagers about the [[L.A. River]], and a video installation about kids’ perspectives on a river in [[North Carolina]]. Gaulke has completed three public art projects;- a Metro-Rail Station in Los Angeles that tells stories about an oft-ignored urban river, an outdoor sculptural piece for a library in Lake View Terrace, and three stainless steel and glass glowing “Pillars of Community” for the City of [[Lakewood, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakewoodcity.org/more/emagazine_archive/07_2005_pillars_of_community_art_project.asp |title=Lakewood Connect |publisher=Lakewoodcity.org |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A black granite memorial honoring the service of Filipino WWII veterans was dedicated on November 11, 2006 in a park in [[Historic Filipinotown]], Los Angeles, the first such monument in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.la.ca.us/council/cd13/cd13press/cd13cd13press13242318_11132006.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926002242/http://www.ci.la.ca.us/council/cd13/cd13press/cd13cd13press13242318_11132006.pdf |date=September 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991 Gaulke was an Artist Book Resident at [[Women's Studio Workshop]] in Rosendale, NY. While a resident, Gaulke published ''Impedement'', a handmade artist's book that investigates the abuse of women’s footwear and feet through the ages, from the ancient Chinese [[foot binding]] to [[High-heeled footwear|high heeled shoes]] of the present. Personal and historical narratives illustrate the results of cultures’ persisting [[Foot fetishism|foot fetish]]. Nested within the book is a pop-up which presents the reader with a packet of “seeds” for change. ''Impedement'' was published as an edition of 200.&lt;ref&gt;“Impedement.” Women’s Studio Workshop. Retrieved 2014-01-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaulke has received grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], the [[California Arts Council]], the City of Los Angeles Cultural Affairs Department, and the Brody Arts Fund. She has exhibited her work in numerous formats all over the world, including exhibitions at the [[Los Angeles Art Association]] (LAAA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gaulke|first=Cheri|title=Cheri Gaulke, Artist|url=http://cherigaulke.wordpress.com/category/exhibitions/|work=Exhibitions|accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Museum of Modern Art]] as well as on buses and in churches.  Gaulke's 2013 video ''Cycle of the Witch'', which explores the development of her identity from her childhood as a Midwestern minister's daughter to her adulthood as a lesbian feminist artist living in Los Angeles, was screened at the 'Tapping the Third Realm' exhibition at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] and at Loyola Marymount University in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cherigaulke.com/portfolio/cycle-of-the-witch/|title=''Cycle of the Witch''|year=2013|website=Cheri Gaulke|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.otis.edu/old-ben-maltz-gallery/press-release/tapping-third-realm|title=Tapping the Third Realm|date=August 15, 2013|website=Otis College of Art and Design|publisher=Otis College of Art and Design|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her 2016 video 'I Am Be,' which retells the myth of Demeter and Persephone to explore the theme of sexual violence, was screened at the Harvard Westlake School in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://awbw.org/screening-of-i-am-be-by-cheri-gaulke/|title=Screening of ''I Am Be'' by Cheri Gaulke|date=October 5, 2016|website=AWBW: Art Transforming Trauma|publisher=A Window Between Worlds|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986 Gaulke received the Vesta Award from the Los Angeles Woman's Building for Contributions to Performance art,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Doin' It In Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|publisher=OTIS College of Art and Design|isbn=0-930209-22-2|pages=21–33 [31]|author=Gaulke, Cheri|authorlink=1+1=3: Art and Collaboration at the WB|editor=Meg Linton and Sue Maberry|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she was honored with a mid-career fellowship from the Cultural Affairs Department (COLA grant) in 2004-05.&lt;ref name="gaulke1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesilverlakenews.com/index.php?pageId=47729 |title=Silver Lake California : WHO'S WHO IN SILVER LAKE |publisher=Thesilverlakenews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, she received the Art as a Hammer Award from the [[Center for the Study of Political Graphics]].

{{Chinatown}}
A '''Chinatown''' ({{zh|c=唐人街|j=tong&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; yan&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; gaai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;|p= Tángrénjiē}}) is an [[ethnic enclave]] of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] or [[Han people|Han]] people located outside [[mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], or [[Taiwan]], most often in an urban setting. Areas known as "Chinatown" exist throughout the world, including Asia, Australia, the Americas, Africa and Europe.

The development of most Chinatowns typically resulted from mass migration to an area without any, or with very few Chinese residents. [[Binondo]] in [[Manila]], established in 1594, is recognised as the world's oldest Chinatown. Notable early examples outside Asia include [[San Francisco]]'s [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown]] in the United States and [[Melbourne]]'s [[Chinatown, Melbourne|Chinatown]] in Australia, which were founded in the mid-19th century during the [[California gold rush]] and [[Victoria gold rush]] respectively. A more modern example, in [[Montville, Connecticut]], was caused by the displacement of Chinese workers in the [[Manhattan Chinatown]] following the [[September 11th attacks]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citylab.com/amp/article/440190/|title=Connecticut's Unexpected Chinatowns|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031214821/http://www.citylab.com/amp/article/440190/|archivedate=2016-10-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/20160722/fortune-friction-and-decline-as-casino-chinatown-matures|title=Fortune, friction and decline as casino 'Chinatown' matures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
The ''[[Oxford Dictionary]]'' defines "Chinatown" as "... a district of any non-Chinese town, especially a city or [[seaport]], in which the population is predominantly of Chinese origin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Chinatown|title=Definition of Chinatown|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228215015/http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/Chinatown|archivedate=2014-02-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some Chinatowns may have little to do with China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kitv.com/news/hawaii/where-you-live/where-you-live-chinatown/24595340 |title=Where You Live Chinatown |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301230646/https://www.kitv.com/news/hawaii/where-you-live/where-you-live-chinatown/24595340 |archivedate=2014-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some "Vietnamese" enclaves are in fact a city's "second Chinatown", and some Chinatowns are in fact pan-Asian, meaning they could also be counted as a [[Koreatown]] or [[Little India (location)|Little India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWSK9-Gf0g8C&amp;pg=PA33 |title=Little Saigons: Staying Vietnamese in America}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example includes [[Asiatown, Cleveland|Asiatown]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. It was initially referred to as a [[Old Chinatown, Cleveland|Chinatown]] but was subsequently renamed due to the influx of non-Chinese [[Asian Americans]] who opened businesses there. Today the district acts as a unifying factor for the Chinese, Taiwanese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, Cambodian, Laotian, Nepalese and Thai communities of Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmiserable.com/cleveland/archive/?p%3D713 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101411/http://www.unmiserable.com/cleveland/archive/?p=713 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further ambiguities with the term can include Chinese [[ethnoburb]]s which by definition are "...[[suburban]] ethnic clusters of residential areas and business districts in large metropolitan areas &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-5743-9780824836719.aspx|title=Ethnoburb: The New Ethnic Community in Urban America|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303214959/http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/p-5743-9780824836719.aspx|archivedate=2014-03-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the intended purpose is to be " ... as isolated from the white population as Hispanics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-26/asians-in-thriving-enclaves-keep-distance-from-whites.html|title=Asians in Thriving Enclaves Keep Distance From Whites|author=|date=|website=bloomberg.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150122212519/http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-06-26/asians-in-thriving-enclaves-keep-distance-from-whites.html|archivedate=22 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' blurs the line further by categorizing very different Chinatowns such as [[Chinatown, Manhattan]], which exists in an urban setting as "traditional"; [[Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley|Monterey Park's Chinatown]], which exists in a "suburban" setting (and labeled as such); and [[Chinatown, Austin|Austin, Texas's Chinatown]], which is in essence a "Chinese themed mall", known as "fabricated". This contrasts with narrower definitions, where the term only described Chinatown in a city setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/travel/chinatown-revisited.html?_r=0|title=Chinatown Revisited|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706171445/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/travel/chinatown-revisited.html?_r=0|archivedate=2017-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cities in [[Spain]], the term denotes an area, neighborhood or district where prostitution or other businesses related to the [[sex industry]] are concentrated; i.e. a [[red-light district]]. Some examples of this are the Chinatown of Salamanca and the Chinatown of [[Barcelona]], although in Barcelona there was a small Chinese community in the 1930s.

==History==
{{See also|Chinese emigration}}
Trading centres populated predominantly by Chinese men and their native spouses have long existed throughout [[Southeast Asia]]. [[Chinese emigration|Emigration]] to other parts of the world from [[China]] accelerated in the 1860s with the signing of the [[Treaty of Peking]] (1860), which opened the border for free movement. Early emigrants came primarily from the coastal [[Chinese province|provinces]] of [[Guangdong]] (Canton, Kwangtung) and [[Fujian]] (Fukien, Hokkien) in [[southeastern China]] – where the people generally speak [[Taishanese|Toishanese]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]] (Chiuchow) and [[Hokkien]].  In the late 19th century and early 20th century, a significant amount of [[Chinese emigration]] to [[North America]] originated from four counties called [[Sze Yup]], located west of the [[Pearl River Delta]] in [[Guangdong]] province, making Toishanese a dominant [[Varieties of Chinese|variety]] of the [[Chinese language]] spoken in [[Chinatowns in Canada and the United States]].

As conditions in China have improved in recent decades, many Chinatowns have lost their initial mission, which was to provide a transitional place into a new culture. As net migration has slowed into them, the smaller Chinatowns have slowly decayed, often to the point of becoming purely historical and no longer serving as [[ethnic enclave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nhpr.org/post/chinatown-ghost-town |title=From Chinatown to Ghost Town |publisher=Nhpr.org |date=2011-11-14 |accessdate=2013-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101042729/http://nhpr.org/post/chinatown-ghost-town |archivedate=2013-11-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Binondo]]'s Chinatown located in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]] is the oldest Chinatown in the world, established in 1594.&lt;ref&gt;Raitisoja, Geni [http://en.radio86.com/travel/travel-destinations/chinatown-manila-oldest-world "Chinatown Manila: Oldest in the world"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402180844/http://en.radio86.com/travel/travel-destinations/chinatown-manila-oldest-world |date=2011-04-02 }}, ''Tradio86.com'', July 8, 2006, accessed March 19, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Asian Chinatowns, although not yet called by that name, have a long history. Those in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], [[Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Takekoshi|first=Yosaburo|title=economic aspects of the history of the civilization of Japan, Vol. 2|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Binondo]] in Manila, [[Hoi An]] and Bao Vinh in central Vietnam&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first=Qingxin|title=Maritime Silk Road|year=2006|publisher=China International Press|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; all existed in 1600.

Chinese presence in [[India]] dates back to the 5th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/07/31/2003181147|title=Calcutta's Chinatown facing extinction over new rule - Taipei Times|author=|date=|website=www.taipeitimes.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513234646/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/07/31/2003181147|archivedate=13 May 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinatown first appeared in the Indian city of [[Chinatown, Kolkata|Calcutta]] (now renamed [[Chinatown, Kolkata|Kolkata]]) and subsequently in [[Chinatown, Mumbai|Mumbai]] and [[Chennai]]. The first Chinese settler in [[Chinatown, Kolkata|Calcutta]] was Young Atchew around 1780.

The [[Chinatown, Bangkok|Chinatown]] centered on [[Yaowarat Road]] in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], was founded at the same time as the city itself, in 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Yaowarat Heritage Centre|url=http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/yaowarat-heritage-centre.html|title=The History of Chinatown Bangkok|accessdate=2 October 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920194046/http://www.tour-bangkok-legacies.com/yaowarat-heritage-centre.html|archivedate=20 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the West===
[[File:Liverpool port 19th century.gif|thumb|left|Chinese seamen established one of the earliest Chinatowns around [[Liverpool docks|the docks in Liverpool]] in the mid-19th century.]]
An early enclave of Chinese people emerged in the 1830s in [[Liverpool]], [[England]] when the first direct trading vessel from [[China]] arrived in Liverpool's docks to trade in goods including [[silk]] and [[cotton wool]].&lt;ref name="LCBA"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Liverpool Chinatown |publisher=The Liverpool Chinatown Business Association |url=http://web.ukonline.co.uk/lcba/ba/history.html |accessdate=31 January 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124032329/http://web.ukonline.co.uk/lcba/ba/history.html |archivedate=24 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Chinese immigrants arrived in Liverpool in the late 1850s in the employ of the [[Blue Funnel Shipping Line]], a [[cargo ship|cargo transport]] company established by [[Alfred Holt]]. The [[Commerce|commercial]] [[shipping line]] created strong [[Economic history of China (pre-1911)|trade]] links between the cities of [[Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong]] and Liverpool, mainly in the importation of silk, cotton and [[tea]].&lt;ref name="LCBA" /&gt;

The [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown in San Francisco]] is one of the largest in North America and the oldest north of [[Mexico]]. It served as a port of entry for early Chinese immigrants from the 1850s to the 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191373 Documentary film about the early history of San Francisco's Chinatown] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106231830/https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/191373 |date=2014-01-06 }}, KPIX-TV, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt; The area was the one geographical region deeded by the city government and private property owners which allowed Chinese persons to inherit and inhabit dwellings within the city. Many Chinese found jobs working for large companies seeking a source of labor, most famously as part of the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]]&lt;ref name="Foster2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Foster|title=Northern California History Weekends|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8VA0GAmdjK4C|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=1 October 2001|publisher=Globe Pequot|isbn=978-0-7627-1076-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[First transcontinental railroad in North America|Transcontinental Railroad]]. Other early immigrants worked as mine workers or independent prospectors hoping to strike it rich during the 1849 [[Gold Rush]]. Other cities in [[North America]] where Chinatowns were founded in the mid-nineteenth century include almost every major settlement along the West Coast from [[San Diego]] to [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]].

Economic opportunity drove the building of further Chinatowns in the United States. The initial Chinatowns were built in the [[Western United States]] in states such as [[California]], [[Oregon]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], [[Idaho]], [[Utah]], [[Colorado]], and [[Arizona]]. As the [[transcontinental railroad]] was built, more Chinatowns started to appear in railroad towns such as [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Cincinnati]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Butte Montana]], and many east coast cities such as [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[Baltimore]]. With the passage of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]], many [[American South|southern states]] such as [[Arkansas]], [[Louisiana]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] began to hire Chinese for work in place of slave labor.&lt;ref name="Okihiro2015"&gt;{{cite book|last=Okihiro|first=Gary Y.|title=American History Unbound: Asians and Pacific Islanders|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WaowDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|year=2015|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0-520-27435-8|page=201|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502225136/https://books.google.com/books?id=WaowDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA201|archivedate=2018-05-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of Chinatowns was not always peaceful, especially when labor disputes arose. Racial tensions flared when lower-paid Chinese workers replaced white miners in many mountain-area Chinatowns, such as in Wyoming with the [[Rock Springs Massacre]]. Many of these frontier Chinatowns became extinct as American racism surged and the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] was passed.

Other Chinatowns in European capitals, including [[Chinatown, Paris|Paris]] and [[Chinatown, London|London]], were established at the turn of the 20th century. The first Chinatown in London was located in the [[Limehouse]] area of the [[East End of London]]&lt;ref&gt;Sales, Rosemary; d'Angelo, Alessio; Liang, Xiujing; Montagna, Nicola. "London's Chinatown" in Donald, Stephanie; Kohman, Eleonore; Kevin, Catherine. (eds) (2009). [https://books.google.com/books?id=wVJkryx7cJAC&amp;pg=PA45 ''Branding Cities: Cosmopolitanism, Parochialism, and Social Change'']. [[Routledge]]. pp. 45–58.&lt;/ref&gt; at the start of the 20th century. The Chinese population engaged in business which catered to the Chinese sailors who frequented the [[London Docklands|Docklands]]. The area acquired a bad reputation from exaggerated reports of [[opium]] dens and [[slum housing]].

France received a large settlement of Chinese immigrant laborers, mostly from the city of [[Wenzhou]], in the [[Zhejiang]] province of China. Significant Chinatowns sprung up in [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] and the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]].

===1970s to the present===
By the late 1970s, refugees and exiles from the [[Vietnam War]] played a significant part in the redevelopment of Chinatowns in developed Western countries. As a result, many existing Chinatowns have become pan-Asian business districts and residential neighborhoods. By contrast, most Chinatowns in the past had been largely inhabited by Chinese from southeastern China.

In 2001, the events of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] have resulted in a mass migration of about 14,000 Chinese workers from [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan's Chinatown]] to [[Montville, Connecticut]]  due to the fall of the garment industry and workers transitioning to casino jobs fueled by the development of the [[Mohegan Sun]] casino.

In 2012, [[Chinatown, Tijuana|Tijuana's Chinatown]] formed as a result of availability of direct flights to China.  The [[La Mesa (Tijuana)|La Mesa District of Tijuana]] was formerly a small enclave, but has tripled in size as a result of direct flights to [[Shanghai]], with an ethnic Chinese population rise from 5,000 in 2009 to roughly 15,000 in 2012, overtaking [[Mexicali]]'s Chinatown as the largest Chinese enclave in Mexico.

===Chinese-themed shopping centers===
[[Image:Splendid China Tower.JPG|thumb|right|[[Splendid China Mall]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].]]
In recent years, Chinese-themed shopping centers have started to take on a role as historical and touristic centers, though the centers themselves are not "Chinatowns" by definition, usually as they are built in areas where the Chinese populations are intermixed with the general population at large. For example, the "Chinatown" in [[Albany, New York]] has been created as an attraction rather than an enclave, intended to give the feeling of the "old Chinatown" in an upscale setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/01/11/story8.html?page=all |title=Albany’s new ‘Chinatown’ features teahouse; other businesses sought |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2013-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111020159/http://www.bizjournals.com/albany/stories/2010/01/11/story8.html?page=all |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new Chinatown in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] will be built with a five-star hotel, and is intended mainly as a visitor attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwaytv3.com/2012/02/05/developers-plan-chinatown-outside-raleigh |title=Developers Plan Chinatown Outside Raleigh |publisher=Wwaytv3.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530183452/https://www.wwaytv3.com/2012/02/05/developers-plan-chinatown-outside-raleigh |archivedate=2013-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of Chinese-themed malls exist in [[Richmond, British Columbia]], [[Chinatown, Houston|Houston]], [[Chinatown, Las Vegas|Las Vegas]], [[Dubai Chinatown|Dubai]], and [[Santo Domingo]] have received official recognition as a "Chinatown". While many Chinese-themed areas have in many cases displaced original Chinese enclaves as places where authentic [[Chinese cuisine]] restaurants and shopping can be found, they are not considered tourist attractions as the most notable historic Chinatown districts are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/Menuism/best-chinese-restaurants_b_2194073.html |title=The Best Chinese Probably Isn't In Chinatown |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2012-12-04 |accessdate=2014-02-28 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111121538/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/Menuism/best-chinese-restaurants_b_2194073.html |archivedate=2013-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bonnie Tsui in her book states that the newer "commercial Chinatowns" rely on the Chinatown being built before the local Chinese population arrives.&lt;ref name=tsui&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5qkGWDO2c4C&amp;pg=PT246 |title=American Chinatown: A People's History of Five Neighborhoods|author=Bonnie Tsui}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The features described below are characteristic of many modern Chinatowns.

===Demographics===
The early Chinatowns such as those in [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]] in the [[United States]] were naturally destinations for people of Chinese descent as [[Chinese emigration|migration]] were the result of opportunities such as the California Gold Rush and the Transcontinental Railroad drawing the population in, creating natural Chinese enclaves that were almost always 100% exclusively Han Chinese, which included both people born in [[China]] and in the enclave, in this case [[American born Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-planning.org/ftp/general_plan/Chinatown.htm#CHI_HOS_4_1 |title=Chinatown Area Plan (San Francisco Chinatown) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519123247/http://www.sf-planning.org/ftp/general_plan/Chinatown.htm |archivedate=2014-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some free countries such as the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], housing laws that prevent [[Housing discrimination (United States)|discrimination]] also allows neighborhoods that may have been characterized as "All Chinese" to also allow non-Chinese to reside in these communities.  For example, the Chinatown in [[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] show sizeable white and black races residing within the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Chinatown-Philadelphia-PA.html|title=Chinatown Philadelphia PA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702164650/http://www.city-data.com/neighborhood/Chinatown-Philadelphia-PA.html|archivedate=2014-07-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A recent study also suggests that the demographic change is also driven by [[gentrification]] of what were previously Chinatown neighborhoods.  The influx of [[Luxury real estate|luxury housing]] is speeding up the gentrification of such neighborhoods. The trend for emergence of these types of natural enclaves is on the decline (with the exceptions being the continued growth and emergence of newer Chinatowns in [[Chinatowns in Queens|Queens]] and [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|Brooklyn]] in New York City), only to be replaced by newer "Disneyland-like" attractions, such as a new Chinatown that will be built in the [[Catskills]] region of [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/china-city-america-new-disney-chinese-themed-development-plans-bring-6-billion-catskills-new-York|title=China City Of America: New Disney-Like Chinese-Themed Development Plans To Bring $6 Billion To Catskills In New York State|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307120550/http://www.ibtimes.com/china-city-america-new-disney-chinese-themed-development-plans-bring-6-billion-catskills-new-york|archivedate=2014-03-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This includes the endangerment of existing historical Chinatowns that will eventually stop serving the needs of Chinese immigrants.  Newer developments like those in [[Norwich, Connecticut]] and the [[Chinese enclaves in the San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel Valley]], which are not necessarily considered "Chinatowns" in the sense that they do not necessarily contain the Chinese architectures or Chinese language signs as signatures of an officially sanctioned area that was designated either in law or signage stating so, differentiate areas that are called "Chinatowns" versus locations that have "significant" populations of people of Chinese descent.  For example, [[San Jose, California]] in the [[United States]] has 63,434 people (2010 U.S. Census) of Chinese descent, and yet "does not have a [[Chinatown, San Jose, California|Chinatown]]".  Some "official" Chinatowns have Chinese populations much lower than that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212194457/http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/searchresults.xhtml?refresh=t |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-02-12 |title=American FactFinder |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural styles===
{{Main|Chinese architecture}}
Many tourist-destination metropolitan Chinatowns can be distinguished by large red arch entrance structures known in Mandarin Chinese as ''[[Paifang]]'' (sometimes accompanied by [[imperial guardian lion]] statues on either side of the structure, to greet visitors).  Other Chinese architectural styles such as the Chinese Garden of Friendship in [[Sydney Chinatown]] and the [[Chinese stone lions]] at the gate to the [[Victoria, British Columbia]] Chinatown are present in some Chinatowns.  [[Mahale Chiniha]], the Chinatown in [[Iran]], contains many buildings that were constructed in the Chinese architectural style.

Paifangs usually have special inscriptions in Chinese. Historically, these gateways were donated to a particular city as a gift from the [[Republic of China]] and [[People's Republic of China]], or local governments (such as Chinatown, San Francisco), and business organizations. The long-neglected Chinatown in [[Havana, Cuba]], received materials for its paifang from the People's Republic of China as part of the Chinatown's gradual renaissance. Construction of these red arches is often financed by local financial contributions from the Chinatown community. Some of these structures span an entire intersection, and some are smaller in height and width. Some paifang can be made of [[wood]], [[masonry]], or [[steel]] and may incorporate an elaborate or simple design.

===Chinese language signs===
[[Chinese characters]] are very commonly seen in areas officially labeled as "Chinatown", and many stores that are located in such districts use Chinese [[calligraphy]] on storefront signs.  Many Chinatowns, such as the one in [[Oakland, California]], employ bilingual street signs that are in Chinese as well as English.

In [[Chinatown, Washington, DC|Washington, DC's Chinatown]], storefront signs are required to have a translation in [[Chinese characters]] when the establishment is located in this district, whether the store is Chinese in nature or not.  Local franchises of national chains, such as [[Starbucks]] coffeeshops and [[CVS Pharmacy|CVS]] drugstores conform to this rule.&lt;ref name="WashDC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/12/the-end-of-chinatown/308732/ |title=The End of Chinatown |publisher=Theatlantic.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-26 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130710042817/http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2011/12/the-end-of-chinatown/308732/ |archivedate=2013-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chinese restaurants===
{{Main|Chinese restaurant|Chinese cuisine}}
{{weasel|section|date=March 2015}}
[[File:Chinatown cooks.jpg|thumb|right|Cooks at a [[Manhattan Chinatown]] restaurant taking a break]]
Most Chinatowns are centered on food, and as a result Chinatowns worldwide are usually popular destinations for various ethnic Chinese and other Asian cuisines such as [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnamese]], [[Thai cuisine|Thai]], and [[Malaysian cuisine|Malaysian]]. Some Chinatowns, such as in [[Chinatown, Singapore|Singapore]], have developed their own localized style of [[Chinese cuisine]]. Chinatown restaurants serve both as major economic components and as social gathering places. In the Chinatowns in many western countries, restaurant work may be the only type of employment available for poorer immigrants, especially those who cannot converse fluently in the language of the adopted country. Most Chinatowns generally have a range of authentic and tourist-oriented restaurants.

Some restaurants in Chinatown do not cater towards non-Chinese customers. Because of ethnic Chinese immigration and the expanded palate of many contemporary cultures, the remaining [[American Chinese cuisine|American Chinese]] and [[Canadian Chinese cuisine]] restaurants are seen as anachronisms,{{who|date=March 2015}} but remain popular and profitable. In many Chinatowns, there are now many large, authentic Cantonese [[seafood]] restaurants, restaurants specializing in other varieties of Chinese cuisine such as [[Hakka cuisine]], [[Szechuan cuisine]], [[Shanghai cuisine]], and small restaurants with [[delicatessen]] foods.

====Cantonese seafood restaurants====
{{see also|List of seafood restaurants}}
[[Cantonese cuisine|Cantonese seafood restaurants]] (海鮮酒家, Pinyin: ''Hǎixiān Jiǔjiā'', pronounced in Cantonese as ''hoy seen jau ga'') typically use a large dining room layout, have ornate designs, and specialize in seafood such as expensive Chinese-style [[lobster]]s, [[crab]]s, [[prawn]]s, [[clam]]s, and [[oyster]]s, all kept live in [[fish tank]]s until preparation. Some seafood restaurants may also offer [[dim sum]] in the morning through the early afternoon hours, as waiters announce the names of dishes while pushing steaming carts of food and pastries around the restaurant. These restaurants are also a popular place for weddings, [[banquet]]s, and other special events.

These types of restaurants flourished and became in vogue in Hong Kong during the 1960s, and subsequently began opening in various Chinatowns overseas. Owing to their higher menu prices and greater amount of investment capital required to open and manage one (due to higher levels of staffing needed), they tend to be more common in Chinatowns and satellite communities in developed countries and in fairly affluent Chinese immigrant communities, notably in Australia, Canada, and the United States, where they have received significant population of Hong Kong Chinese émigrés. Poorer immigrants usually cannot start these kinds of restaurants, although they too are employed in them. There are generally fewer of them in the older Chinatowns; for example, they are practically non-existent in [[Vancouver]]'s Chinatown, but are found in its suburbs such as [[Richmond, British Columbia]], [[Canada]]. Competition between these restaurants is often fierce; hence owners of seafood restaurants hire and even "steal" the best chefs, many of whom are from [[Hong Kong]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

====Barbecue delicatessens/restaurants====
[[File:Cantonese roast duck in Los Angeles Chinatown.jpg|thumb|A display of Cantonese roast duck for sale in a delicatessen in [[Chinatown, Los Angeles]]]]
Also, Chinese [[barbecue]] [[Delicatessen|deli]] restaurants, called ''[[siu laap]]'' (燒臘 ''shāo là'') and sometimes called a "noodle house" or ''mein ga'' (麵家 ''miàn jiā''), are generally more modest in size and decor, and serve less expensive fare such as [[wonton]] noodles (or ''wonton mein''), [[chow fun]] (炒粉 ''chǎo fěn'', stir-fry rice noodles), [[Yeung Chow fried rice]] (揚州炒飯 ''Yángzhōu chǎofàn''), and [[rice pudding|rice porridge]] or [[congee]], known as ''juk'' in Cantonese Chinese. They also tend to have displays of whole pre-cooked roasted ducks and [[suckling pig]]s hanging in their windows, a common feature in most Chinatowns worldwide. These delis also serve barbecue [[pork]] (叉燒 ''chāshāo'', ''[[cha siu]]''), [[tripe]], [[chicken feet]], and other Chinese-style items less familiar to the typical Western palate. Food is usually intended for [[take-out]]. Some of these Chinatown restaurants sometimes have reputations for being "[[greasy spoon]]s" and for poor service, whereas others may be clean and well-lit, with suitable decor and attentive waitstaff.

Vietnamese immigrants, both ethnic Chinese and non-Chinese, have opened restaurants in many Chinatowns, serving Vietnamese [[pho]] [[beef noodle soup]]s and Franco-Vietnamese [[sandwich]]es. Some immigrants have also started restaurants serving [[Teochew cuisine|Teochew]] Chinese cuisine. Some Chinatowns both old and new may also contain several pan-Asian restaurants offering a variety of Asian noodles under one roof.

====Localized cuisines====

=====Chop suey and chow mein eateries (United States)=====
Often lit by [[neon sign]]age, restaurants offering [[chop suey]] or [[chow mein]], mainly for the benefit of non-Chinese customers, were frequent in older Chinatowns. These dishes also are offered in standard barbecue restaurants and takeouts (take-away restaurants).

=====Chifas (Peru)=====
A special feature of the Chinatown in [[Lima, Peru]] (''Barrio Chino de Lima'') is the chifa, a [[Chinese-Peruvian]] type of restaurant which mixes Cantonese Chinese cuisine with local Peruvian flavors. Chifa is the [[Peruvian Spanish]] derivative of the Cantonese phrase ''jee fon'' (饎飯 ''chì fàn''), which renders as "cook rice" or as "cook meal'". This type of restaurant is popular with native Peruvians.

Most Chinatown businesses are engaged in the [[International trade|import-export]] and [[wholesale]] businesses; hence a large number of [[trading company|trading companies]] are found in Chinatowns.

====Markets and supermarkets====
{{Main|Asian supermarket}}
In addition to the restaurant trade, grocery stores and seafood markets serve a key function in Chinatown economies, and these stores sell Chinese ingredients to such restaurants as well as to the general public. Some markets are [[wholesaler]]s, while smaller Chinatown grocers and markets are often characterized by sidewalk vegetable and fruit stalls, a quintessential image of many Chinatowns. Many local residents buy fresh food daily, taking advantage of its ready availability, and also avoiding the space, ventilation, and electrical requirements of large refrigerators at home.

Stores also sell a variety of grocery items imported from East Asia (chiefly Mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea) and Southeast Asia (principally Vietnam, Thailand, and Malaysia). For example, most Chinatown markets stock items such as sacks of Thai [[jasmine rice]], Chinese [[chrysanthemum]] and [[oolong]] [[tea]]s, bottles of [[oyster sauce]], rice [[vermicelli]], Hong Kong [[soybean]] beverages, Malaysian snack items, Taiwanese [[rice cracker]]s, and Japanese [[seaweed]] and Chinese specialties such as black [[duck egg]]s (often used in rice porridge), ''[[bok choy]]'', and [[Eleocharis dulcis|water chestnuts]]. These markets may also sell fish (especially [[tilapia]]) and other seafood items, which are kept alive in aquariums, for Chinese and other Asian cuisine dishes. Until recently, these items generally could not be found outside the Chinatown enclaves, although since the 1970s [[Asian supermarket]]s have proliferated in the suburbs of North America and Australia, competing strongly with the old Chinatown markets.

====Chinese bakeries====
{{Main|Chinese bakery products}}
Many Chinatowns have had ethnic bakeries for years, offering a large variety of steamed, boiled, or fried delicacies as well as baked goods.  Most of the foods on offer were of Chinese origin, but storekeepers often added items adopted or adapted from the surrounding national culture.  Chinese bakeries in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Taiwan were especially influential in mixing ingredients and techniques from other world cultures, developing new foods that have become standard items. In North America and elsewhere, the non-Chinese population has gradually discovered these delicacies, and Chinese bakeries have begun to sell their products to a wider market.

====Religious supplies====
In keeping with [[Buddhist]] and [[Taoist]] funeral traditions, Chinese specialty shops also sell [[incense]] and funeral items which provide material comfort in the afterlife of the deceased. Shops sell specially crafted paper replicas of small houses, radios, televisions, telephones, jewelry, and other symbolic material items. They also sell "[[Hell Bank Notes|hell money]]" currency notes, intended to be ritually burned in a furnace.

These businesses also sell red, wooden Buddhist altars and small statues for worship. Per Chinese custom, an offering of fresh oranges is usually placed in front of the statue in the altar. Sometimes altars are stacked atop each other. These altars may be found in many Chinatown businesses as well as homes, to bring good luck and prosperity.

===Antiquated features===
[[File:Far East Chop Suey Little Tokyo LA.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Far East Chop Suey restaurant in Little Tokyo, Los Angeles: Restaurants like this are now rare, but were once a common sight in the United States]]
Many early Chinatowns featured large numbers of Chinese-owned [[chop suey]] restaurants, laundry businesses, and [[opium den]]s, until around the mid-20th century when most of these businesses began to disappear. Though some remain, they are generally seen as [[anachronism]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} In early years of Chinatowns, the opium dens were patronized as a relaxation and to escape the harsh and brutal realities of a hostile non-Chinese society, although in North American Chinatowns, they were also frequented by non-Chinese. Additionally, due to the inability on the part of Chinese immigrant men to bring a wife and lack of available local Chinese women for men to marry, [[brothel]]s became common in some Chinatowns of the 19th century. [[Chinese laundry|Chinese laundries]], which were labor-intensive but required very little capital or language fluency, were fairly common.

These traditional businesses no longer exist in many Chinatowns and have been replaced by Chinese grocery stores, restaurants that serve more authentic Chinese cuisine, and other establishments. While opium dens no longer exist, illegal basement [[gambling]] parlors are still places of recreation in many Chinatowns, where men gather to play [[mahjong]] and other games.

===Annual events===
Many Chinatowns close off streets for [[parade]]s, [[street festival]]s, [[Chinese acrobatics]] and [[martial arts]] demonstrations, and [[amusement ride]]s, under the request of the promoters or organizers for the major event. Smaller festivals may also be held in a [[parking lot]]/[[car park]], playground, local park, or school grounds within Chinatown.

====Chinese New Year====
{{Main|Chinese New Year}}
Most Chinatowns present ''[[Chinese New Year]]'' (also known as Lunar New Year) festivities with [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] and [[lion dance]]s accompanied by the rhythm of clashing [[cymbal]]s, clanging on a [[gong]], clapping of hardwood clappers, pounding of [[drum]]s, and loud Chinese [[firecracker]]s. Special performances are held in front of Chinese businesses, where the "lion" character attempts to "eat" a head of [[lettuce]] or to catch an [[orange (fruit)|orange]] in its mouth. The lion costume typically contains two dancers, and performances may involve several athletic stunts. Dragon dancers often perform in larger groups, animating a long tubular dragon costume. In return, storekeepers usually donate some money to the performers, who usually belong to local [[martial arts]] clubs.

Ironically, many lion and dragon dances are considered better preserved in true form in overseas Chinatowns rather than in China itself. This discrepancy is attributed to the fact that traditional Chinese customs, including lion and dragon dances, were unable to flourish during the political and social instabilities of [[Late Imperial China|Imperial China]] under rule of the [[Qing Dynasty]], and were almost eliminated completely under the [[Communist]] regime of the People's Republic of China under Chairman [[Mao Zedong]]. However, due to the migration of Chinese all over the world (particularly Southeast Asia), these dance traditions were continued by overseas Chinese and performed in Chinatowns.

Chinese New Year dragon and lion dances are intended particularly to scare off evil spirits and bring good fortune to the community. They are also specially commissioned to celebrate a [[grand opening]] of a new Chinatown business, such as a restaurant or bank. Ceremonial [[wreath]]s and leafy green plants with red-colored ribbons strewn across are also usually placed in front of new Chinatown businesses by well-wishers (particularly family members, wholesalers, community organizations, and so on), to assure future success.

====Mid-Autumn Festival====
{{Main|Mid-Autumn Festival}}
The Mid-Autumn Festival or "August Moon Festival" is an annual celebration that occurs sometime between August to October, depending on the lunar calendar and local customs.  Many stores sell special [[mooncake]]s in conjunction with this particular festival. In addition to street celebrations, [[dragon boat race]]s are held on this occasion in some cities.

====Miss Chinatown Beauty Pageant====
Some Chinatowns hold an annual "Miss Chinatown" [[beauty pageant]], such as [[Miss New York Chinese Pageant]] (formerly known as '''Miss Greater Chinatown NYC Beauty Pageant'''), "Miss Chinatown San Francisco," "Mr &amp; Miss Chinatown Philippines," "Miss Chinatown Hawaii," "Miss Chinatown Houston" or "Miss Chinatown Atlanta"{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}.

==Benevolent and business associations==
{{Main|Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association}}
[[File:Zhonghua Huiguan, San Francisco (6540).JPG|thumb|left|upright|Headquarters of the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association in [[Chinatown, San Francisco]].]]

A major component of many Chinatowns is the family benevolent association, which provides some degree of aid to immigrants. These associations generally provide social support, religious services, death benefits (members' names in Chinese are generally enshrined on tablets and posted on walls), meals, and recreational activities for ethnic Chinese, especially for older Chinese migrants. Membership in these associations can be based on members sharing a common [[Chinese surname]] or belonging to a common clan, spoken [[Chinese dialect]], specific village, region or country of origin, and so on. Many have their own facilities.

Some examples include San Francisco's prominent [[Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association]] (中華總會館 ''Zhōnghuá Zǒng Huìguǎn''), aka [[Chinese Six Companies]], and Los Angeles' Southern California Teochew Association. The Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association is among the largest umbrella groups of benevolent associations in the North America, which branches in several Chinatowns. Politically, the CCBA has traditionally been aligned with the [[Kuomintang]] and the [[Republic of China]].

The London Chinatown Chinese Association is active in [[Chinatown, London]]. [[Chinatown, Paris]] has an institution in the ''Association des Résidents en France d'origine indochinoise'' and it servicing overseas Chinese immigrants in Paris who were born in the former [[French Indochina]].

Traditionally, Chinatown-based associations have also been aligned with ethnic Chinese business interests, such as restaurant, grocery, and laundry (antiquated) associations in Chinatowns in North America. In Chicago's Chinatown, the On Leong Merchants Association was active.

[[File:Boston Signs.jpg|thumb|upright|Official signs in [[Boston]] pointing towards "[[Chinatown, Boston|Chinatown]]"]]
Although the term "Chinatown" was first used in Asia, it does not come from a Chinese language.  Its earliest appearance seems to have been in connection with the [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinese quarter]] of [[Singapore]], which by 1844 was already being called "China Town" or "Chinatown" by the British colonial government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Simmond's Colonial Magazine and Foreign Miscellany|date=Jan–Apr 1844|page=335|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/ferg/issn/14606011.html|title=Trade and Commerce in Singapore|accessdate=2011-12-20|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222220928/http://www.nla.gov.au/ferg/issn/14606011.html|archivedate=2011-12-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=1844-07-23|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This may have been a word-for-word translation into English of the Malay name for that quarter, which in those days was probably "Kampong China" or possibly "Kota China" or "Kampong Tionghua/Chunghwa/Zhonghua".

The first appearance of a Chinatown outside Singapore may have been in 1852, in a book by the Rev. Hatfield, who applied the term to the Chinese part of the main settlement on the remote South Atlantic island of [[St. Helena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hatfield|first=Edwin F.|title=St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope|year=1852|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island was a regular way-station on the voyage to Europe and North America from Indian Ocean ports, including Singapore.

[[File:ChinatownSign.jpg|left|thumb|Sign inside [[Jefferson Station (Philadelphia)|Jefferson Station]] in [[Philadelphia]] pointing to "[[Chinatown, Philadelphia|Chinatown]]"]]
One of the earliest American usages dates to 1855, when San Francisco newspaper ''[[The Daily Alta California]]'' described a "pitched battle on the streets of [SF's] Chinatown". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Alta California|date=1855-12-12|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other ''Alta'' articles from the late 1850s make it clear that areas called "Chinatown" existed at that time in several other California cities, including Oroville and San Andres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Alta California|date=1857-12-12|page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Alta California|date=1858-06-04|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1869, "Chinatown had acquired its full modern meaning all over the U.S. and Canada.  For instance, an Ohio newspaper wrote: "From San Diego to Sitka..., every town and hamlet has its 'Chinatown'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Defiance Democrat|date=1869-06-12|page= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In British publications before the 1890s, "Chinatown" appeared mainly in connection with California.  At first, Australian and New Zealand journalists also regarded Chinatowns as Californian phenomena.  However, they began using the term to denote local Chinese communities as early as 1861 in Australia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Ballarat Star|date=1861-02-16|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1873 in New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Tuapeka Times|date=1873-02-06|page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most other countries, the custom of calling local Chinese communities "Chinatowns" is not older than the twentieth century.

Several alternate English names for Chinatown include '''China Town''' (generally used in [[British English|British]] and [[Australian English]]), '''The Chinese District''', '''Chinese Quarter''', and '''China Alley''' (an antiquated term used primarily in several [[rural]] towns in the [[American West|western United States]] for a Chinese community; some of these are now historical sites). In the case of Lillooet, British Columbia, Canada, China Alley was a parallel commercial street adjacent to the town's Main Street, enjoying a view over the river valley adjacent and also over the main residential part of Chinatown, which was largely of [[adobe]] construction. All traces of Chinatown and China Alley there have disappeared, despite a once large and prosperous community.

===Chinese===
[[File:Sign for Stowell Street - geograph.org.uk - 911781.jpg|right|thumb|Street sign in [[Chinatown, Newcastle]] with {{lang|zh|唐人街}} below the street name.]]
In [[Chinese language|Chinese]], Chinatown is usually called {{lang|zh|唐人街}}, in [[Cantonese]] ''Tong yan gai'', in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] ''Tángrénjiē'', in [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] ''Tong ngin gai'', and in [[Taishan dialect|Toisan]] ''Hong ngin gai'', literally meaning "Tang people's street(s)". The [[Tang Dynasty]] was a zenith of the Chinese civilization, after which some Chinese call themselves. Some Chinatowns are indeed just one single street, such as the relatively short [[Chinatown, Victoria, British Columbia|Fisgard Street]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.

A more modern Chinese name is  {{lang|zh|華埠}} (Cantonese: Waa Fau, Mandarin: Huábù) meaning "Chinese City", used in the semi-official Chinese translations of some cities' documents and signs. ''Bù'', pronounced sometimes in Mandarin as ''fù'', usually means ''seaport''; but in this sense, it means ''city'' or ''town''. Likewise, ''Tong yan fau'' ({{lang|zh|唐人埠}} ''Tángrén bù'' "Tang people's town") is also used in Cantonese nowadays. The literal word-for-word translation of ''Chinatown''—''Zhōngguó Chéng'' ({{lang|zh|中國城}}) is also used, but more frequently by visiting Chinese nationals rather than immigrants of Chinese descent who live in various Chinatowns.

Some Chinatowns have unique Chinese names used by the local Chinese. For example, the Chinese name for [[Chinatown, Singapore|Chinatown]] in [[Singapore]] is ''Niúchēshǔi'' ({{lang|zh|牛车水}}, [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Gû-chia-chúi''), which literally means "ox-cart water" from the Malay 'Kreta Ayer' in reference to the water carts that used to ply the area. The Chinatown in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]], while officially known as [[Petaling Street]] (Malay: ''Jalan Petaling''), is referred to by Malaysian Chinese by its Cantonese name ''ci&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cong&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; gaai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' ({{lang|zh|茨厂街}}, pinyin: ''Cíchǎng Jiē''), literally "tapioca factory street", after a tapioca starch factory that once stood in the area. In Manila, the area is called Mínlúnluò Qū {{lang|zh|岷倫洛區}}, literally the "district near the Rivers Mín Coherent to the River Luò". This is however a transliteration of the local term "Binondo" and an allusion to its proximity to the [[Pasig River]].

===Other languages===
In [[Francophone]] regions (such as France and [[Quebec]]), Chinatown is often referred to as '''''le quartier chinois''''' (''the Chinese Quarter''; plural: ''les quartiers chinois'').  The most prominent Francophone Chinatowns are located in [[Chinatown, Paris|Paris]] and [[Chinatown, Montreal|Montreal]].

The Spanish-language term is usually '''''barrio chino''''' (''Chinese neighborhood''; plural: ''barrios chinos''), used in Spain and [[Latin America]]. (However, ''barrio chino'' or its [[Catalan language|Catalan]] cognate ''barri xinès'' do not always refer to a Chinese neighborhood: these are also common terms for a disreputable district with drugs and prostitution, and often no connection to the Chinese.).

The Vietnamese term for Chinatown is ''Khu người Hoa'' (Chinese district) or ''phố Tàu'' (Chinese street). Vietnamese language is prevalent in Chinatowns of Paris, Los Angeles, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, and Montreal as ethnic Chinese from Vietnam have set up shop in them.

In Japanese, the term "chūkagai" (literally "Chinese Street") is the translation used for [[Yokohama Chinatown|Yokohama]] and [[Nagasaki Chinatown]].

In [[Indonesia]], chinatown is known as '''''Pecinan''''', a shortened term of ''pe-cina-an'', means everything related to the Chinese people. Most of these pecinans usually located in [[Java]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.id/books?id=oQifRGYy55sC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Pecinan+Chinatown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Pecinan%20Chinatown&amp;f=false|title=Cleavage, Connection and Conflict in Rural, Urban and Contemporary Asia|last=Bunnell|first=Tim|last2=Parthasarathy|first2=D.|last3=Thompson|first3=Eric C.|date=2012-12-11|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789400754829|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171023010943/https://books.google.co.id/books?id=oQifRGYy55sC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=Pecinan+Chinatown&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Pecinan%20Chinatown&amp;f=false|archivedate=2017-10-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some languages have adopted the English-language term, such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[German language|German]].

===Africa===
{{Main|Chinatowns in Africa}}
There are three noteworthy Chinatowns in Africa located in the coastal African nations of [[Madagascar]], [[Mauritius]], and [[South Africa]].  South Africa has the largest Chinatown and the largest Chinese population of any African country and remains a popular destination for Chinese immigrants coming to Africa.  Derrick Avenue in [[Cyrildene]], [[Johannesburg]] hosts South Africa's largest Chinatown.

===Americas===
{{main|Chinatowns in the Americas}}
In the [[Americas]], which includes North America, Central America and South America, Chinatowns have been around since the 1800s.  The most prominent ones exist in the United States and Canada in [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Vancouver]].  New York City is home to the largest [[Chinese Americans in New York City|ethnic Chinese population outside of Asia]], including several Chinatowns in and around [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Manhattan]], [[Chinatown, Flushing|Flushing]], and [[Chinatown, Brooklyn|Brooklyn]].  There is also a [[Little Fuzhou]] developing in Manhattan and in a nearby area of Brooklyn.  [[Chinatown, San Francisco|San Francisco]], a Pacific port city, has the oldest and longest continuous running Chinatown in the Western Hemisphere.&lt;ref name="Bacon, Daniel page 50"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards, Rand page 198"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In Canada, [[Chinatown, Vancouver|Vancouver's Chinatown]] is the country's largest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vancouverchinatown.ca/ |title=Chinatown Vancouver Online |publisher=Vancouverchinatown.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903032520/http://www.vancouverchinatown.ca/ |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest Chinatown in the Americas is in [[Mexico City]] and dates back to at least the early 17th century.&lt;ref name="Mann2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Mann|first=Charles C.|authorlink=Charles C.

Latin American Chinatowns may include the descendants of original migrants – often of mixed Chinese and [[Latin]] parentage – and more recent immigrants from [[East Asia]]. Most [[Asian Latin American]]s are of [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hakka people|Hakka]] origin. Estimates widely vary on the number of Chinese descendants in Latin America. Notable Chinatowns also exist in [[Chinatown, Lima|Lima]], [[Peru]].

===Asia===
{{Main|Chinatowns in Asia}}
Chinatowns in Asia are widespread with a large concentration of [[overseas Chinese]] in [[East Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]] and ethnic Chinese whose ancestors came from southern China – particularly the provinces of [[Guangdong]], [[Fujian]], and [[Hainan]] – and settled in countries such as [[Brunei]], [[Cambodia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Myanmar]], [[Singapore]], the [[Philippines]], [[Thailand]], and [[Vietnam]] centuries ago—starting as early as the [[Tang Dynasty]], but mostly notably in the 17th through the 19th centuries (during the reign of the [[Qing Dynasty]]), and well into the 20th century. Today the Chinese diaspora in Asia is largely concentrated in Southeast Asia however the legacy of the once widespread overseas Chinese communities in Asia is evident in the many Chinatowns that are found across East Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

It extends between the corners of [[Swanston Street|Swanston]] and [[Exhibition Street, Melbourne|Exhibition Street]]s.  Melbourne's Chinatown originated during the [[Victorian gold rush]] in 1851, and is notable as the oldest Chinatown in Australia. It has also been claimed to be the longest continuously running Chinese community outside of Asia, but only because the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] all but destroyed the Chinatown in San Francisco in California.&lt;ref name="Bacon, Daniel page 50"&gt;Bacon, Daniel: Walking the Barbary Coast Trail 2nd ed., page 50, Quicksilver Press, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Richards, Rand page 198"&gt;Richards, Rand: Historic San Francisco, 2nd Ed., page 198, Heritage House Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;

Several urban Chinatowns exist in major European capital cities. There is [[Chinatown, London]], England as well as major Chinatowns in [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]]  and [[Manchester]]. &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[[Berlin]], Germany has two established Chinatowns, with the ''Dong Xuan Center'' around Herzbergstrasse of [[Lichtenberg (locality)|Lichtenberg]] in the East, and the area around Kantstrasse of [[Charlottenburg]] in the West.&lt;/span&gt; [[Antwerp, Belgium]] has also seen an upstart Chinese community, that has been recognized by the local authorities since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chinatown-antwerpen.be |title=China Town Antwerpen |publisher=Chinatown-antwerpen.be |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920075100/http://www.chinatown-antwerpen.be/ |archivedate=2011-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The city council of [[Cardiff]] has plans to recognize the Chinese Diaspora in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.britishchineseonline.com/forum/showthread.php?t=28439 |title=What happened to cardiff china town? - Discussion Board |publisher=Britishchineseonline.com |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2011-09-11 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chinatown, Paris|Chinatown in Paris]], located in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris|13th arrondissement]], is the largest in Europe, where many Vietnamese – specifically ethnic Chinese refugees from Vietnam – have settled and in [[Belleville, Paris|Belleville]] in the northeast of Paris as well as in [[Lyon]]. In [[Italy]], there is a Chinatown in [[Milan]] between Via Luigi Canonica and [[Via Paolo Sarpi]] and others in [[Rome]] and [[Prato]]. In the Netherlands, Chinatowns exist in [[Amsterdam]], [[Rotterdam]] and [[the Hague]].

In the United Kingdom, several exist in Birmingham, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Newcastle Upon Tyne. The Chinatown in Liverpool is the oldest Chinese community in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.halfandhalf.org.uk |title=Liverpool and it's Chinese Children |publisher=Halfandhalf.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-09-11 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002184856/http://www.halfandhalf.org.uk/ |archivedate=2011-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Chinatown, London|Chinatown in London]] was established in the [[Limehouse]] district in the late 19th century.

==In popular culture==

Chinatowns have been referenced in various films including ''[[The Joy Luck Club (film)|The Joy Luck Club]]'', ''[[Big Trouble in Little China]]'', and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''.  Also, many films in which [[Jackie Chan]] appears reference locations in Chinatown, particularly the ''[[Rush Hour (film series)|Rush Hour]]'' series with [[Chris Tucker]].

Chinatowns have also been mentioned in the song "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" by [[Carl Douglas]] whose song lyrics says "... There was funky China men from funky Chinatown...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kung Fu Fighting|author=Carl Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[martial arts]] actor [[Bruce Lee]] is well known as a person who was born in the [[Chinatown, San Francisco|Chinatown of San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/arts/bruce-lees-huge-bronze-statue-turns-into-a-mecca-in-las-chinatown-video-5380451|title=Bruce Lee's Huge Bronze Statue Turns Into a Mecca in L.A.'s Chinatown (VIDEO)|first=Liz|last=Ohanesian|date=12 February 2015|website=laweekly.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180104233447/https://www.laweekly.com/arts/bruce-lees-huge-bronze-statue-turns-into-a-mecca-in-las-chinatown-video-5380451|archivedate=4 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable [[Chinese Americans]] such as politician [[Gary Locke]] and NBA player [[Jeremy Lin]] grew up in suburbs with lesser connections to traditional Chinatowns.  Neighborhood activists and politicians have increased in prominence in some cities, and some are starting to attract support from non-Chinese voters.

ISSN 0047-9462 Oral history (1981) describes the Chinatown of Winnemucca, Nevada, during 1901–10. Though many Chinese left Winnemucca after the Central Pacific Railroad was completed in 1869, around four hundred Chinese had formed a community in the town by the 1890s. Among the prominent buildings was the Joss House, a place of worship and celebration that was visited by Chinese president Sun Yat-Sen in 1911. Beyond describing the physical layout of the Chinatown, the author recalls some of the commercial and gambling activities in the community.

[[Political corruption]] is acknowledged as a significant problem by many observers, but some believe its size has been overstated by international media.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The government’s anti-corruption efforts have not been evaluated as effective, according to several sources, which has been attributed to poor enforcement of anti-corruption legislation and the ineffectiveness of anti-corruption agencies. Anti-corruption agencies have been hindered by excessive political influence and continuous replacement of staff. Recent involvement of high-ranking public officials in corruption cases has been reported in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greece Corruption Profile- Political Climate|url=http://www.business-anti-corruption.com/country-profiles/europe-central-asia/greece/show-all.aspx|publisher=Business Anti-Corruption Portal|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2012 Human Rights Reports: Greece|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/hrrpt/2012/eur/204291.htm|publisher=The US Department of State|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alleged origin of Greek corruption ==
Commentators both within and outside Greece have attributed this flaw in Greek culture to a mismanagement of [[Ottoman Greece]] by the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In Ottoman-occupied Greece [[tax resistance]] became a form of patriotism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Itano|first=Nicole|title=Taxing Times in Greece|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1958721,00.html|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reguly|first=Eric|title=The roots of the Greek tragedy: bloated bureaucracy and tax evasion|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/the-roots-of-the-greek-tragedy-bloated-bureaucracy-and-tax-evasion/article582943/|accessdate=10 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=10 June 2011|location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes a condition for survival. Property and commercial tax systems were left in shambles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rozenweig|first=Luc|author2=Stephane Monclare |title=Pour En Finir Avec Crise|journal=[[Politique Internationale]]|date=Spring 2012|issue=135|url=http://www.politiqueinternationale.com/revue/read2.php?id_revue=135&amp;id=1099&amp;content=texte&amp;search=|accessdate=10 September 2012}} This is a transcript of an interview with [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] in which he mentions the Ottoman impact upon Greece's property and commercial tax systems.&lt;/ref&gt; Greece became independent in 1822, but the corruption in modern Greece and the resistance to pay taxes to [[Ottoman Empire]] Era is connected by the fact that part of the ethnic Greek officials of the Ottoman Empire kept their positions after Greek independence and established the way the Greek state was run. Immediately after independence, Greeks were subjected to a heavy tax burden caused by the debt accumulated during the independence war, which was combined with the poverty and devastation caused by the war. Tax evasion was, however, a larger problem among the high-ranking officials, who were accustomed to being unchecked by the Ottomans and sought to preserve that status in the Greek state.

Data for 2012 indicated that the Greek "shadow economy" or "underground economy", from which little or no tax was collected, was a full 24.3% of GDP - compared with 28.6% for Estonia, 26.5% for Latvia, 21.6% for Italy, 17.1% for Belgium, 14.7% for Sweden, 13.7% for Finland, and 13.5% for Germany &lt;ref name="go.bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite news| title = Will Euro Austerity Push the Shadow Economy Even Deeper Into the Dark?|  url = http://go.bloomberg.com/market-now/2012/12/06/will-euro-austerity-push-the-shadow-economy-even-deeper-into-the-dark/   |work= Bloomberg  | date = 6 December 2012| accessdate= 8 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Media Coverage"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.academia.edu/6655991/Media_Coverage_of_the_2010_Greek_Debt_Crisis_Inaccuracies_and_Evidence_of_Manipulation/

For Greece, where the percentage of self-employed was more than double the EU average in 2013, a well known pattern is followed, where tax evasion is correlated with the percentage of working population that is self-employed &lt;ref name="Media Coverage"/&gt;. 

Several successive Greek governments had in the past attempted to improve the situation. A rapid increase in government revenues through implementing a more effective tax collecting system has been recommended. Implementing the proper reforms, is however estimated to be a slow process, requiring at least two legislative periods before they start to work.&lt;ref name="Fakelaki"&gt;{{cite web|title=Griechenland: Abkehr von den Fakelaki|url=http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2010-05/griechenland-korruption-schwarzarbeit?page=all |work=Zeit|date=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the last quarter of 2005, 49% of the companies inspected by the tax authorities were found to have committed tax offences while in January 2006 it fell to 41.6%.&lt;ref name="Ethnos Forodiafygi" /&gt; A study by researchers from the [[University of Chicago]] concluded that tax evasion in 2009 by self-employed professionals alone in Greece (accountants, dentists, lawyers, doctors, personal tutors and independent financial advisers) was €28 billion or 31% of the budget deficit that year.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;

The [[Tax Justice Network]] has said that there are over €20 billion in [[Switzerland|Swiss]] bank accounts held by Greeks.&lt;ref name="Skai TJN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/182717/20-dis-euro-ehoun-krupsei-oi-ellines-stin-elvetia/ |title=20 δισ. ευρώ έχουν κρύψει οι Έλληνες στην Ελβετία |year=2011 |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former Finance Minister of Greece, Evangelos Venizelos, was quoted as saying "Around 15,000 individuals and companies owe the taxman 37 billion euros".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boyes|first=Roger|title=Rich greeks pack up their troubles along with their euros|accessdate=20 November 2011|newspaper=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the TJN puts the number of Greek-owned [[Offshore investment|off-shore companies]] to over 10,000.&lt;ref name="Ta Nea TJN"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tanea.gr/ellada/article/?aid=4515967 |script-title=el:Υπερδύναμη στις οφ σορ η Ελλάδα |year=2011 |publisher=[[Ta Nea]] |accessdate=12 October 2011|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A mid-2017 report indicated Greeks have been "taxed to the hilt" and many believed that the risk of penalties for tax evasion were less serious than the risk of bankruptcy. One method of evasion is the so-called black market, grey economy or shadow economy: work is done for cash payment which is not declared as income; as well, VAT is not collected and remitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/18/world/europe/greece-bailout-black-market.html|title=Greeks Turn to the Black Market as Another Bailout Showdown Looms|first=Liz|last=Alderman|date=18 February 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A January 2017 report&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; by the DiaNEOsis think-tank indicated that unpaid taxes in Greece at the time totaled approximately 95 billion euros, up from 76 billion euros in 2015, much of it was expected to be uncollectable. Another early 2017 study estimated that the loss to the government as a result of tax evasion was between 6% and 9% of the country's GDP, or roughly between 11 billion and 16 billion euros per annum.&lt;ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com"/&gt;

The shortfall in the collection of VAT (sales tax) is also significant. In 2014, the government collected 28% less than was owed to it; this shortfall was about double the average for the EU. The uncollected amount that year was about 4.9 billion euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-23/if-poland-can-fix-tax-fraud-so-can-greece|title=If Poland Can Fix Tax Fraud, So Can Greece|date=23 June 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DiaNEOsis study estimated that 3.5% of GDP is lost due to VAT fraud, while losses due to smuggling of alcohol, tobacco and petrol amounted to approximately another 0.5% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref name="keeptalkinggreece.com"/&gt;

=== Fakelaki ===
{{Further information|Fakelaki}}
In Greek, ''fakelaki'' means "little envelope" but is also used in Greek popular culture as a [[jargon]] term referring to the bribery of public servants and private companies by [[Greece|Greek]] citizens in order to "expedite" service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/162177/whats-wrong-and-right-about-greece/|title=What's Wrong—and Right—With Greece|work=The Nation|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this practice, sums of money are stuffed in the [[File folder|file]]s and passed across the desk to secure appointments, documents approval and [[License|permits]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.innovationsinnewspapers.com/index.php/2010/02/25/watchdog-journalism-greece-fakelaki-and-the-world-bank/|title=Watchdog Journalism, Greece, "Fakelaki", and the World Bank|work=What's Next: Innovations in Newspapers blog|accessdate=15 March 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302204429/http://www.innovationsinnewspapers.com/index.php/2010/02/25/watchdog-journalism-greece-fakelaki-and-the-world-bank/|archivedate=2 March 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was mainly associated with the corruption amongst the doctors of the National Healthcare Service (ESY).

== Government efforts at revenue collection ==
Following similar actions by the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Germany]], the Greek government is in talks with [[Switzerland]] to tax bank accounts in Switzerland owned by Greek citizens.&lt;ref name="Skai Elvetia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skai.gr/news/finance/article/184756/mehri-to-telos-tou-2011-i-sumfonia-gia-ti-forologisi-ton-katatheseon-stin-elvetia-/ |script-title=el:Μέχρι το τέλος του 2011 η συμφωνία για τη φορολόγηση των καταθέσεων στην Ελβετία |trans-title=Deal to tax Swiss bank accounts to be reached by end of 2011 |publisher=[[Skai TV]] |accessdate=30 October 2011|language=el}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2011 the [[Minister for Finance (Greece)|Ministry of Finance]] revealed that Greek Swiss bank account holders will either have to pay a tax or reveal information such as the identity of the bank account holder to the Greek internal revenue services.&lt;ref name="Skai Elvetia" /&gt; The Greek and Swiss governments were hoping to reach a deal on the matter by the end of 2011&lt;ref name="Skai Elvetia" /&gt; but that deadline was not met.

Estimates in 2015 indicated that the amount of Greeks' evaded taxes stored in Swiss banks was around 80 billion euros. By then, a tax treaty to address this issue was finally under serious negotiation between the Greek and Swiss governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek minister slams Swiss over tax evasion|url=http://www.thelocal.ch/20150624/greek-minister-slams-swiss-over-tax-evasion|publisher=The Local ch|date=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swiss await Greek input on hidden billions|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-await-greek-input-on-hidden-billions/41292816|publisher=Swissinfo.ch|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An agreement was ratified by Switzerland on 1 March 2016 creating a new tax transparency law that would allow for a more effective battle against tax evasion. Starting in 2018, banks in both Greece and Switzerland will exchange information about the bank accounts of citizens of the other country to minimize the possibility of hiding untaxed income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-16-3185_en.htm|title=European Commission - PRESS RELEASES  - Press release - EU-Swiss relations|website=europa.eu|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anticorruption measures ===
The Inspector General of Public Administration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gedd.gr/ |title=Website of the General inspector of civil services |publisher=Gedd.gr |accessdate=2012-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; has started an online census of civil servants. In connection with this census he has uncovered a number of offenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/griechenland-herkules-versus-verwaltung-1.975855 SZ: Herkules versus Verwaltung], 16 July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source.  The current reference is to a German newspaper article which gives no support to the alleged incident.|date=May 2018}}

The OECD, the Greek government and the European Commission, developed a project to fight corruption, the National Anti-Corruption Action Plan (NACAP). It was scheduled to operate from October 2016 to December 2017 with some of the funding provided by the European Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/greece-oecd-anti-corruption.htm|title=Greece-OECD project: Technical support on anti-corruption - OECD|website=www.oecd.org|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the country's health ministry announced an electronic platform designed to tackle corruption in the healthcare system. Health Minister Andreas Ksanthos made this comment: "We believe that a new culture is needed, another style of the social health system, to convince patients that they can be offered services with dignity without seeking connections with people in charge or financial transactions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/health-consumers/news/greece-creates-e-platform-to-tackle-corruption-in-healthcare/|title=Greece creates e-platform to tackle corruption in healthcare|website=EURACTIV.com|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tax collection improvements ===
In 2010 the government has implemented a tax reform. The year 2012 saw the introduction of a duty of non-cash [[payment]]s for amounts over 1,500 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rechtsanwalt-griechenland.de/bekaempfung-der-steuerhinterziehung-in-griechenland.html |title=Maßnahmen zur Bekämpfung der Steuerhinterziehung in Griechenland |publisher=Kosmidis &amp; Partner Anwaltsgesellschaft |date=2010-05-00 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blog.handelsblatt.com/global-reporting/2011/02/11/bargeld-lacht-aber-nicht-mehr-in-griechenland/ |title=Bargeld lacht – aber nicht mehr in Griechenland |newspaper=Handelsblatt Global Reporting |author=[[Gerd Höhler]] |date=11 February 2011 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Greek police have established a special unit, which deals exclusively with tax offenses. Germany has offered experts from its financial management and tax investigation office to help build a more efficient tax administration.&lt;ref&gt;zeit.de 17. November 2011: [http://www.zeit.de/wirtschaft/2011-11/steuern-griechenland/komplettansicht ''Auf der Jagd nach den reichen Griechen. - Rund 60 Milliarden Euro an Steuern schulden die Griechen dem Staat. Die Regierung in Athen greift nun hart durch, unterstützt von einem Deutschen.'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, months later it was not clear whether Greek officials would accept the offer.&lt;ref&gt;reuters.com 19 February 2012: [https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/19/us-eurozone-germany-greece-idUSTRE81I0BA20120219 ''Germany urges Greece to accept offers of help'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, Greek finance minister Evangelos Venizelos called upon all persons who owed the state more than 150,000 euros to pay their outstanding taxes by 24 November or find their names on a black list published on the Internet. The government later revealed the list, which also includes a number of prominent Greeks, including pop stars and sportsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/macht-die-steuersuender-dingfest/1838898.html |title=Griechenland: "Macht die Steuersünder dingfest!" |author=Gerd Höhler |newspaper=Tagesspiegel |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Forokarta ===
{{Further information|Forokarta}}
The Forokarta is a "tax card" proposed by the government of [[Greece]] in August 2011, which would be used to facilitate collection of receipts for purchases; this would allow the [[Ministry of Finance (Greece)|Greek finance ministry]] to clamp down on rampant tax evasion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite2_1_05/08/2011_401354|accessdate=24 August 2011|title=New tax system in the pipeline|date=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16792848|accessdate=24 August 2011|title=Tax evasion: Dues and don’ts|date=12 August 2011|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; by comparing individuals' spending to their income, and by comparing business' ''actual'' revenues to their accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13455/45874|accessdate=24 August 2011|title=How the state will track your spending|date=7 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321004656/http://www.athensnews.gr/issue/13455/45874|archivedate=21 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2015, this measure is largely defunct and can be considered a failed project.

=== Electronic payments to fight tax avoidance ===
In 2016 and 2017, the government was encouraging the use of [[credit card]] or [[debit cards]] to pay for goods and services in order to reduce cash only payments. By January 2017, taxpayers were only granted tax-allowances or deductions when payments were made electronically, with a "paper trail" of the transactions that the government could easily audit. This was expected to reduce the problem of businesses taking payments but not issuing an invoice;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornosnews.gr/en/greek-news/economy/26979-tax-evasion-safari-in-greek-tourist-spots-snags-major-violators.html|title=Tax evasion 'safari' in Greek tourist spots snags major violators - TornosNews.gr|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that tactic had been used by various companies to avoid payment of VAT (sales) tax as well as income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2016/12/13/fin-ministry-bill-gives-tax-breaks-to-greeks-making-payments-with-credit-and-debit-cards/|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=Fin Ministry Bill Gives Tax Breaks to Greeks Making Payments With Credit and Debit Cards|date=13 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2016/0411/Why-Greeks-swap-of-cash-for-cards-could-end-a-culture-of-tax-evasion|accessdate=28 August 2017|title=WORLD EUROPE Why Greeks' swap of cash for cards could end a culture of tax evasion|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 28 July 2017, numerous businesses were required by law to install a [[point of sale]] (POS) device to enable them to accept payment by credit or debit card. Failure to comply with the electronic payment facility can lead to fines of up to 1,500 euros. The requirement applied to around 400,000 firms or individuals in 85 professions. The greater use of electronic payments was one of the factors that had already achieved significant increases in VAT collection in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekathimerini.com/220705/article/ekathimerini/business/clear-incentives-for-greater-card-use|title=Clear incentives for greater card use, Nick Malkoutzis - Kathimerini|publisher=|accessdate=10 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lagarde list ==
{{Main article|Lagarde list}}
The Greek government has not completed an investigation of a list of 1,991 persons purported to hold accounts with Swiss bank [[HSBC Finance|HSBC]] that it received in 2010 from former French finance minister [[Christine Lagarde]]. Initially, officials claimed at various times to have lost or misplaced the information. On 29 October 2012 the government changed its position saying it would not use stolen information to prosecute suspected offenders. Instead, Greek authorities arrested [[Kostas Vaxevanis]], journalist and editor of the weekly magazine ''[[Hot Doc]]'', who published the "[[Lagarde list]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Λίστα Λαγκάρντ |url=http://www.zougla.gr/politiki/article/lista c|publisher=zougla |date=26 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was charged for breaching privacy laws that could have seen him sentenced to two years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek officials accused of persecution as 'Lagarde List' journalist appears in court |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/greece/9641410/Greek-officials-accused-of-persecution-as-Lagarde-List-journalist-appears-in-court.html |publisher=The Telegraph| date=30 October 2012|location=London|first=Damien|last=McElroy}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after a trial lasting only a day, he was acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Greek bank list editor Costas Vaxevanis acquitted |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20172516 |publisher=BBC News| date=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another trial, in 2015 found the former minister of economy 
[[:el:Γεώργιος Παπακωνσταντίνου|Giorgos Papakonstantinou]] guilty for document distortion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tovima.gr/society/article/?aid=688805 A year in jail for Langarde list at Giorgos Papakonstantinou] Το Βήμα  24 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The list includes an advisor to former Greek prime minister Antonis Samaras, as well as a former minister and a member of Samaras' New Democracy political party. The list also contains the names of officials in the finance ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Controversial 'Lagarde List' Has Leaked, And It's Bad News For The Greek Prime Minister |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/lagarde-list-of-swiss-bank-accounts-leaked-2012-10 |publisher=Business Insider| date=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr Vaxevanis said he thought the government had not acted on the list because it included friends of ministers, businessmen and powerful publishers.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;Mark Lowen, [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20163430 Greek journalist Costas Vaxevanis on trial over bank list], BBC News, November 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He also accused much of the Greek media of ignoring the story.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt; "The Greek press is muzzled", he said. "There is a closed system of power in Greece, wielded by the political elite, businessmen and journalists."&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

This article is about the '''[[demographics|demographic]] features of the [[population]] of [[Gibraltar]]''', including [[ethnic group|ethnicity]], education level, health of the populace, economic status, religious affiliations and other aspects of the population.

==Ethnic origins==
One of the main features of Gibraltar’s population is the diversity of their [[ethnic group|ethnic origins]]. The demographics of Gibraltar reflects Gibraltarians' [[Culture of Gibraltar|racial and cultural fusion]] of the many [[European ethnic groups|European]] and non-European immigrants who came to the [[Rock of Gibraltar|Rock]] over three hundred years. They are the descendants of economic migrants that came to Gibraltar after the majority of the Spanish population left in 1704.

===Spanish===
The majority of the Spanish population in Gibraltar (about 5000), with few exceptions, left Gibraltar when the Dutch and English took the village in 1704. The few [[Spaniard]]s who remained in Gibraltar in August 1704 were augmented by others who arrived in the fleet with [[Prince George of Hesse-Darmstadt]], possibly some two hundred in all, mostly [[Catalan people|Catalans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iteg.org/documentos/spaniards_in_gibraltar.pdf Spaniards in Gibraltar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060304033327/http://www.iteg.org/documentos/spaniards_in_gibraltar.pdf |date=2006-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Menorca|Menorcans]] are a small and interesting group. Their migration to Gibraltar started since the beginning of the common British rule in 1713, thanks to the links between both British possessions during the 18th century, first looking for work in several trades, especially when Gibraltar needed to be rebuilt after the 1783 Grand Siege. Immigration continued even after Menorca (the original English name was "Minorca") was returned to Spain in 1802 by the [[Treaty of Amiens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Jackson |year=1990 |title=The Rock of the Gibraltarians. A History of Gibraltar |publisher=Gibraltar Books | edition = second |location=Grendon, Northamptonshire, UK |isbn=0-948466-14-6 | page=225}}: "The open frontier helped to increase the Spanish share, and naval links with Minorca produced the small Minorcan contingent."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C | title=Gibraltar, identity and empire | author=Edward G. Archer | publisher=Routledge | year=2006 | isbn=978-0-415-34796-9 | pages=42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immigration]] from Spain (like the exiles from the Spanish Civil War) and intermarriage with [[Andalusian people|Spaniards]] from the [[Campo de Gibraltar|surrounding Spanish towns]] was a constant feature of [[History of Gibraltar|Gibraltar's history]] until the then Spanish [[dictator]], General [[Francisco Franco]], closed the border with Gibraltar in 1969, cutting off many Gibraltarians from their relatives on the Spanish side of the frontier.

Together, Gibraltarians of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] origin are one of the bigger groups (more than 24% according to last names, even more taking into account the fact that many Spanish women married native Gibraltarians).&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1 ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 43. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===British===
[[British people|Britons]] have come and settled or gone since the first days of the conquest. One group of Britons have had temporary residence in Gibraltar (to work in the administration and the garrison). This group, who represented a larger proportion in the beginning of the British period, are nowadays only about 3% of the total population (around 1,000 persons).

A larger group is formed by the Britons who moved to Gibraltar and settled down. Some of them, since the beginning, moved to Gibraltar to earn a living as traders and workers. Others moved to Gibraltar on a temporary assignment and then married with local women. Major construction projects, such as the dockyard in the late 1890s and early 20th century brought large numbers of workers from Great Britain.

13% of Gibraltarian residents are from the United Kingdom proper and the electoral roll shows that 27% of Gibraltar's population has British surnames.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 40. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genoese and other Italians===
[[Genoa|Genoese]] came during the 18th and 19th centuries, especially from the poorer parts of [[Liguria]], some of them annually following fishing shoals, as repairmen for the [[Royal Navy|British navy]], or as successful traders and merchants;&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 37. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; many others came during the Napoleonic period to avoid obligatory conscription to the French Army.&lt;ref name="google24"&gt;Levey, David: [https://books.google.com/books?id=VKW6uqxsj4YC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=french+gibraltar+ethnic&amp;ei=nGOrSqv8OaSCywSMtvilCg#v=onepage&amp;q=french%20gibraltar%20ethnic&amp;f=false ''Language change and variation in Gibraltar'', page 24. John Benjamins Publishing Company.]&lt;/ref&gt; Genoese formed the larger group of the new population in the 18th century and middle 19th century. Other [[Italians]] came from islands like [[Sardinia]] and [[Sicily]]. Nowadays, people with Genoese/Italian last names represent about 20% of the population.

===Portuguese===
[[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] were one of the earliest groups to move to Gibraltar, especially from the [[Algarve]] region in the far south of [[Portugal]]. Most of them went to work as labourers and some as traders. Their number increased significantly during the 18th century, and again when many Spaniards left their jobs in Gibraltar after General Franco closed the border in 1969. About 10% of last names in Gibraltar have Portuguese origin.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 41. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moroccans===
[[Moroccan people|Moroccans]] have always had a significant presence in Gibraltar. However, the modern community has more recent origins. Moroccans began arriving in Gibraltar soon after the Spanish government imposed the first restrictions on Spanish workers in Gibraltar in 1964. By the end of 1968 there were at least 1,300 Moroccan workers resident in Gibraltar and this more than doubled following the final closure of the frontier with Spain in June 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/migration/documents/briefing3.pdf|title=Sussex Migration Briefing - Steps to resolving the situation of Moroccans in Gibraltar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also a significant amount of [[Moroccan Jews]] in Gibraltar, representing Jews of both [[Sephardic]] origin and Arabic speaking Jews of Morocco (although almost no Gibraltarian Jews today speak Arabic as a first language). Most notably the [[Hassan (surname)|Hassan]] family which runs Gibraltar's largest law firm [[Hassans|Hassans International Law Firm]]&lt;ref&gt;Legal 500, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and the late [[Joshua Hassan|Sir Joshua Hassan]] who served four terms as Chief Minister for a total of 17 years.&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html |title=Obituary: Sir Joshua Hassan |accessdate=23 November 2009 |last=Nash |first=Elizabeth |date=2 July 1997 |work=The Independent |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5lV0KbHCi?url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-sir-joshua-hassan-1248542.html |archivedate=23 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other groups===
Other groups include:
*[[Maltese people|Maltese]] were in the same imperial route to the east as Gibraltar. They came when jobs were scarce at home and others to escape the law in [[Malta]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 44. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jew]]s, most of them of [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] origin, were able to re-establish their rites, [[Alhambra decree|forbidden in Catholic Spain]], right after the British occupation in 1704. Also a significant number of Jews from London settled in Gibraltar, especially since the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Great Siege]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 38. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]], came as merchants after the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1870; many others migrated as workers after the closure of the frontier with Spain in 1969 to replace Spanish ones.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, Edward G.: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2ip0C6odET4C&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=archer+identity+empire+gibraltar&amp;ei=F2SrSsKWA6nEzgSMnfGsCg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Gibraltar, identity and empire''], page 45. Routledge Advances in European Politics.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[French people|French]], many of whom came after the French Revolution in 1789, set up trade and commerce.&lt;ref name="google24"/&gt;
*[[Austrians]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Japanese people|Japanese]], [[Polish people|Polish]] or [[Danes]].

'''''Drag Me to Hell''''' is a 2009 American [[supernatural horror film]] co-written and directed by [[Sam Raimi]]. The plot, written with his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]], focuses on a loan officer, who, because she has to prove to her boss that she can make the "hard decisions", chooses not to extend an elderly woman's mortgage. In retaliation, the woman places a [[curse]] on the loan officer that, after three days of escalating torment, will plunge her into the depths of [[Hell]] to burn for eternity.

Raimi wrote ''Drag Me to Hell'' with his brother, Ivan, before working on the [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film premiered at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and was released to critical acclaim. It was also a box office success, grossing over $90 million worldwide.  ''Drag Me to Hell'' won the award for [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]] at the 2009 [[Scream Awards]] and the 2010 [[Saturn Awards]].

==Plot==
In 1969, in [[Pasadena]], a couple seeks the aid of the [[mediumship|medium]] Shaun San Dena, saying their son has been hearing evil spirits' voices after stealing a silver necklace from a "gypsy wagon". San Dena aids the family by carrying out a [[séance]], but they are attacked by an unseen force that drags the boy to [[Hell]].

In present-day [[Los Angeles]], bank loan officer Christine is in competition for a promotion with Stu Rubin. Her boss advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions. An elderly woman, Sylvia Ganush, asks for a third extension on her mortgage payment, and despite Ganush's financial and medical problems, Christine denies her an extension to prove herself. Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house. Ganush is taken away, accusing Christine of "shaming" her and swears revenge.

In the parking garage Christine is ambushed by Ganush, who is hiding in the back seat. Ganush rips a button from Christine's coat and intones words in another language. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay meet [[fortune teller]] Rham Jas, who tells Christine that she is being haunted by a dark spirit, likely the result of a [[curse]]. At home, Christine is attacked by the entity and has nightmares about Ganush. At work the next day, she hallucinates and bleeds profusely from her nose. She leaves the office, and, amid the general panic, Stu steals a file from Christine's desk.

Christine goes to beg Ganush for forgiveness but discovers that Ganush has died. Christine returns to Jas, who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object (the button), she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the "Lamia". It will torment her for three days before taking her to Hell. He suggests a sacrifice to appease it. Christine reluctantly sacrifices her pet kitten. She meets Clay’s parents at their house for dinner, where she is again tormented by the Lamia, plagued with grotesque hallucinations.

Christine returns to Jas, who requests a fee of $10,000. He introduces her to San Dena who prepares a séance to trap the Lamia's spirit in a goat and kill it, but things go wrong and the Lamia inhabits first her body and then her assistant Milos. San Dena excorcises the Lamia, but dies from the effort. Jas explains that the plan failed. He seals the button in an envelope and tells Christine that she can be rid of the curse by giving the button to someone else, thereby passing the curse on to that person. Christine decides to give the envelope to Stu, but changes her mind. Jas advises Christine that she can give the button to a dead person. Christine digs up Ganush's grave, and "formally" gifts her the button after some struggle, just before dawn.

Christine returns home and prepares to meet Clay at [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Los Angeles Union Station]] for a weekend trip. She gets a message from her boss telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confessed to stealing her work and was fired. Clay reveals to her that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car. She realizes that the envelope was mistaken for the  other and that the curse was never lifted. Horrified, Christine backs away and falls onto the tracks. As Clay looks on, unable to reach her, a train barrels towards her, just as fiery hands emerge from the tracks and drag Christine into Hell. Clay, holding the button in his hand at the edge of the train platform stares horrified at the tracks.

==Production==

===Background===
The original story for ''Drag Me to Hell'' was written ten years before the film went into production and was written by [[Sam Raimi]] and his brother [[Ivan Raimi]]. The film went into production under the name ''The Curse''.&lt;ref name="prod"&gt;{{cite web | title = Drag Me to Hell Production Notes | url = http://www.dragmetohell.net/assets/production/production_notes.html | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090519202048/http://www.dragmetohell.net/assets/production/production_notes.html | archivedate = May 19, 2009 | work = Drag Me To Hell Official Website | publisher = [[Universal Pictures]] | location = Los Angeles, California | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raimis wrote the script as a [[morality tale]], desiring to write a story about a character who wants to be a good person, but makes a sinful choice out of greed for her own betterment and pays the price for it.&lt;ref name="festival-cannes"&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Press Conference (8:00) | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10041.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Raimis tried to make the character of Christine the main focal point in the film, and tried to have Christine in almost all the scenes in the film.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Elements of the film's story are drawn from the [[British cinema|British]] [[horror film]] ''[[Night of the Demon]]'' (itself an adaptation of [[M.R. James]]' short story "[[Casting the Runes]]") such as the similar-shaped demons and the three-day curse theme in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Movie Review: Drag Me to Hell : Mountain Xpress | url = http://www.mountainx.com/movies/review/drag_me_to_hell | first = Ken | last = Hanke | date = 2009-06-03 | work = [[Mountain Xpress]] | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety" /&gt; The most significant parallel is that both stories involve the passing of a cursed object, which has to be passed to someone else, or its possessor will be devoured by one or more demons. Unlike his past horror films, Raimi wanted the film to be rated PG-13 and not strictly driven by gore, stating, "I didn't want to do exactly the same thing I had done before."&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="15cannes"&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Press Conference (15:30) | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10041.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After finishing the script, Raimi desired to make the picture after the first draft of the script was completed, but other projects such as the [[Spider-Man in film|''Spider-Man'' film series]] became a nearly decade-long endeavor, pushing opportunities to continue work on ''Drag Me to Hell'' to late 2007.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Raimi offered director [[Edgar Wright]] to direct ''Drag Me to Hell'' which Wright turned down as he was filming ''[[Hot Fuzz]]'' and felt that "If I did it, it would just feel like karaoke."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/latest/305032-hero_worship_sam_raimi|work=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]|title=Hero Worship: Sam Raimi|author=Wright, Edgar|authorlink=Edgar Wright|accessdate=July 8, 2013|date=July 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the previous three ''Spider-Man'' films, Raimi came back to the script of ''Drag Me to Hell'', wanting to make a simpler and lower-budget film.&lt;ref name="CannesInterview"&gt;{{cite web | title = ''Drag Me to Hell'' : Cannes Interview | url = http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/mediaPlayer/10040.html | work = [[Cannes Film Festival]] | format = Video | year = 2009 | accessdate = 2009-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Sam Raimi's friend and [[Film producer|producer]] [[Robert Tapert]] of [[Ghost House Pictures]] had the company sign on to finance the film.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; [[Universal Studios]] agreed to distribute domestically.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt;

===Casting===
After completing the script and having the project greenlit, Raimi started casting the film.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; [[Ellen Page]] was originally cast for the main role of Christine, but dropped out of the project due to [[Screen Actors Guild#2008–09 Screen Actors Guild labor dispute|SAG strike]]-related scheduling issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.movieweb.com/news/NElPVqonXe3xpl | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110611043502/http://www.movieweb.com/news/ellen-page-quits-sam-raimis-drag-me-to-hell | archivedate = June 11, 2011 | title = Ellen Page Quits Sam Raimi's ''Drag Me to Hell'' | date = February 29, 2008 | publisher = MovieWeb | quote = We were racing to start production so that we could accommodate Ellen's schedule. But like so many other productions trying to start before the potential SAG strike date, this one needed more time and we had to push back the start of production.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main role eventually went to Lohman, who didn't enjoy [[horror film]]s, but enjoyed doing the stunts during filming.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Stage actress [[Lorna Raver]] auditioned for the role of Mrs. Ganush. Raver was not aware of the specific nature of her character until being cast, stating that all she had read was "about a little old lady coming into the bank because they're closing down her house. It was only later that I saw the whole script and said, 'Oh my!'"&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; To prepare for this role, Raver met with a Hungarian dialect coach and asked to have portions of the script translated into Hungarian.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Raimi would later ask Raver to use some of the Hungarian words in the scenes of Ganush's attacking Christine.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; [[Dileep Rao]], who plays Rham Jas, made producer [[Grant Curtis]] mildly hesitant in casting him, stating that during his audition "he was a little bit younger than he read in the script. But as we were looking at his reading, Sam said, 'There's no minimum age requirement on wisdom.' Dileep has that wisdom and presence on screen, and that’s what made him right. Once he got on camera, he brought that shoulder for Alison to lean on."&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Many of the actors playing secondary characters in ''Drag Me to Hell'' have appeared previously in Raimi's films, including Joanne Baron, Tom Carey, [[Molly Cheek]], Aimee Miles, John Paxton, [[Ted Raimi]], Bill E. Rogers, [[Chelcie Ross]], and [[Octavia Spencer]].&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt;

===Filming===
Raimi said he set out to create “a horror film with lots of wild moments and lots of suspense and big shocks that’ll hopefully make audiences jump. But I also wanted to have a lot of dark humor sprinkled throughout. I spent the last decade doing ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' and you come to rely on a lot of people doing things for you and a lot of help, but it’s refreshing and wonderful to be reminded that, as with most filmmakers, the best way to do it is yourself, with a tight team doing the main jobs."&lt;ref name="PostMag"&gt;{{cite web | last = Blair | first = Iain | title = Director's Chair: Sam Raimi Drag me to Hell | url = http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?tier=4&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;sid=&amp;nm=&amp;id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802031958/http://www.postmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&amp;nm=&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=9A2AE6F97AE946859A3C884BDE603E22 | archivedate=August 2, 2009 | work = Post Magazine | date = July 1, 2009 | accessdate  = July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production for ''Drag Me to Hell'' began on location in [[Tarzana, Los Angeles|Tarzana, California]].&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; The production team included director of photography [[Peter Deming]] (''[[Evil Dead II]]'', ''[[Mulholland Drive (film)|Mulholland Dr.]]''), production designer Steve Saklad (''[[Juno (film)|Juno]]''), and visual effects supervisor Bruce Jones. The film was produced by [[Grant Curtis]] and [[Rob Tapert]]. Tapert and Raimi are longtime collaborators, having attended college together in Michigan.&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

===Editing===
''Drag Me to Hell'' was edited by [[Bob Murawski]], who has collaborated with Raimi on several films including the ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' series, ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'', and ''[[Army of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

Raimi has said of working with Murawski on ''Drag Me to Hell'', "He’d come (down to the set) to see how things were going and to let me know if he’d just cut something that wasn’t working the way he’d wanted it to, or to suggest a pick-up shot I should get for a piece he felt we needed in a sequence I hadn’t realized I needed. He’s very detail-oriented... So we’re very close collaborators."

Raimi finds editing with Murawski to be "relaxing", adding, "I love it. For me, it's so relaxing, unlike pre-production, which is fraught with anxiety and fear about how we'e going to do things, and production, which is so rushed and a sleepless time and you're just racing to finish every shot and worrying about focus and so on. So post is soothing and I can watch the film come together, so it's a time of discovery for me as Bob and I fit all the pieces together. I see new possibilities in post, as Bob puts the film together, sometimes in a way I never imagined..."&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

The film was edited by Murawski on an Avid computer system in a West Los Angeles facility. The color grading was completed at Company 3 with colorist Stephen Nakamura. Nakamura used DaVinci Resolve. It was CO3's first start-to-finish feature in 4K resolution.&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

"For us, post is a very creative time where it's not just about this factory producing the blueprinted product. It's really a very creative, experimental time where we try and take everything that's been written and then shot to the next level," said Raimi.&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

The final sound mix was completed at the Dub Stage in Burbank with mixers Marti Humphrey and Chris Jacobson.&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

===Effects===
The effects in ''Drag Me to Hell'' were created in many different ways, including [[Chroma key|green screen]], [[puppet]]s, prosthetics and [[computer-generated imagery]].&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; Bruce Jones was the visual effects supervisor on the film. Of Jones, Raimi commented, "He brought a great can-do approach to the film... He's got a great team of artists and technicians with him, and he's got great instincts."&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

There were hundreds of visual effects in the film, and different effects houses were utilized. According to Raimi, the [[Bay Area]]'s Tippett Studio was a big player. "We also had work done by Amalgamated Pixels, Ghost VFX, KNB Effects, Home Digital, Cinesoup and IE Effects," said Raimi. According to Raimi, “Bob (Murawski) and I kept adding visual effects as post proceeded. In this film, the supernatural, the unseen, is almost another character, so sequences were developed — even in post — that would suggest the presence of the supernatural, and we kept on adding. The same with the sound effects, so it was a very ongoing, very live process in post."&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt;

Director of photography [[Peter Deming]] tried to use realistic lighting in the film. Said Deming, "Normally, you'd put all corrected bulbs in, but we went with what was there, including the shots in the street. We used the streetlight look and mixed that with interior lighting. There were a lot of odd color sources that we chose to leave the way they would be naturally. It's a heightened sense of realism."&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt; One of the earliest projects the special effects teams did was the scene in which Mrs. Ganush attacks Christine in her car. To film the action, which included close-ups of Christine jamming her foot on the pedal, hitting the brake, and shifting gears, the team created a puzzle car which allowed the front engine compartment and back trunk — as well as all four sides and doors — to come away from the car. The roof came off in two directions.&lt;ref name="prod" /&gt;

The [[film score]] was composed by [[Christopher Young]]. Young has worked with director Raimi previously on his films ''[[The Gift (2000 film)|The Gift]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. The soundtrack was released on August 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fangoria.com/musick/musick-news/3602-drag-me-to-hell-soundtrack-hits-stores.html|work=[[Fangoria]]|accessdate=November 24, 2009|date=August 17, 2009|author=Zimmerman, Samuel|title=Drag Me to Hell soundtrack hits stores}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Raimi stated that emphasis was on using the soundtrack to create a world that didn't exist, a world of the "supernatural".&lt;ref name="PostMag" /&gt; The score contains elements of Young's previous work on ''[[Flowers in the Attic (film)|Flowers in the Attic]]''. This is particularly apparent in the utilization of the ethereal childlike soprano vocals that feature prominently throughout the soundtrack.

All tracks composed by Christopher Young.

Positive critical reception of the film generally praised the film's scary but humorous and campy tone. Owen Gleiberman of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film an A rating, stating that "Raimi has made the most crazy, fun, and terrifying horror movie in years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Drag Me to Hell &gt; Movie Review &gt; Entertainment Weekly|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20281263,00.html|date=May 27, 2009|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Betsy Sharkey of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' praised the film, stating that it "should not be dismissed as yet another horror flick just for teens.

Still, there's no denying it delivers far more than competing PG-13 thrillers."&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite web | last = Debruge | first = Peter | title = Drag Me to Hell Review | url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940322.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1 | date = 2009-05-20 | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | accessdate = 2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloody Disgusting]] gave the film four and a half stars out of five, with the review calling it "quite simply the most PERFECT horror film I've seen in a long, long while... [It's] a blast and moved quickly from start to finish [and] is well on its way to becoming an immediate classic."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/film/1667/review|title=Drag Me to Hell|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was then ranked thirteenth in Bloody Disgusting's list of the 'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18415|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 2|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviews have also received the film as a [[comedy horror]] in a more classic [[Sam Raimi|Raimi]] vein. Vic Holtreman of Screenrant claims the film is a long-awaited movie that combines both genres as ''[[Army of Darkness]]'' had done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://screenrant.com/drag-me-to-hell-reviews-vic-10582/ |title=Drag Me To Hell Review |publisher=Screen Rant |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer at [[UGO Networks]] says that the film is very much more a comedy than horror and that this is in keeping with [[Sam Raimi|Raimi]] not having produced a "true horror" film since he began directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/movies/drag-me-to-hell-review-should-have-just-been-evil-dead |title=Drag Me To Hell Review - Should Have Just Been Evil Dead |publisher=UGO.com |date=2009-05-21 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">The '''Embassy Property Purchase Scandal''' is a scandal that resulted in the [[Kenya]]n Minister for Foreign Affairs [[Moses Wetangula]] leaving his post. Wetangula left his ministerial post on October 27, 2010  due to ongoing investigation on his alleged involvement in the Kenyan Tokyo embassy scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Daily Nation, October 27, 2010: [http://www.nation.co.ke/News/Kenya%20minister%20steps%20aside%20over%20saga/-/1056/1041378/-/foio57z/-/index.html Kenya minister steps aside over saga]&lt;/ref&gt; 

It was alleged that instead of accepting free property from the government of Japan for the embassy, 1.6 billion shillings was withheld from the sale of Kenyan property in Nigeria and used to buy a less suitable property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.rfi.fr/africa/20101027-expensive-tokyo-embassy-leads-kenyan-resignations Expensive Tokyo embassy leads to Kenyan resignations]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Saitoti]] served as acting foreign minister during Wetangula’s absence. Wetangula returned to the ministry in August 2011, though he permanently left the position a few months later.

Later on 30th Wednesday 2016, Former Foreign Affairs permanent secretary Thuita Mwangi and two others were acquitted of all charges in relation to the Tokyo Embassy scam.

In making the ruling, a Nairobi court said the prosecution had failed to prove the case against the three.

The former PS had been charged alongside former ambassador to Libya Anthony Muchiri and former chargé d'affaires in Tokyo Allan Mburu.

They were charged with abuse of office in procuring the embassy and ambassador’s residence in Tokyo at a price of Sh1.4 billion, and for failing to involve the ministerial tender committee in approving the purchase.

The '''Family Court of Australia attacks''' were a series of shootings and bombings in [[New South Wales]], Australia from 1980 to 1985. They were targeted at judges, and other people, associated with the [[Family Court of Australia]]. In the attacks two people were shot dead, two killed by bombs, a court building was damaged by a bomb, and another bomb was found attached to a motor vehicle. In late July 2015 a man was arrested and charged over the attacks.

The attacks are considered to have begun on 22 February 1980, when Stephen Blanchard was shot dead in his home.&lt;ref name=star-30years&gt;{{cite news |title=Man arrested more than 30 years later for Sydney shooting and bombing spree that killed 4 |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2015/07/29/man-arrested-more-than-30-years-later-for-sydney-shooting-and-bombing-spree-that-killed-4.html |accessdate=30 July 2015 |work=thestar.com |agency=Associated Press (AP) |publisher=Toronto Star Newspapers Ltd |date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; His body was found six days later on the opposite side of Sydney in [[Cowan Creek]] on the [[Hawkesbury River]].&lt;ref name=sun-tele-7-jul-13&gt;{{cite news |last1=Coulthart|first1=Ross |title=Investigation exposes the dad accused of an unsolved crime spree that killed four people |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/investigation-exposes-the-dad-accused-of-an-unsolved-crime-spree-that-killed-four-people/story-fni0cwl5-1226675335935 |accessdate=30 July 2015 |work=The Sunday Telegraph |date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 1980, Family Court judge [[David Opas]] was shot outside his home. He died later that night in hospital.&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt;

On 6 March 1984, judge [[Richard Gee (judge)|Richard Gee]], who had taken on Opas' cases after his death, was injured by a bomb at his [[Belrose, New South Wales|Belrose]] home.&lt;ref name=sun-tele-7-jul-13/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt; On 14 April 1984, the [[Parramatta Courthouse|Family Court building]] in Parramatta was bombed, without any injuries.&lt;ref name=newscom-court/&gt;

On 4 July 1984 Pearl Watson, the wife of Family Court judge [[Ray Watson (judge)|Ray Watson]], became the first fatality of the bombing campaign when she opened the door of their unit in [[Greenwich, New South Wales|Greenwich]], triggering an [[improvised explosive device]] on the doorstep.&lt;ref name=sun-tele-7-jul-13/&gt; Judge Watson is believed to have been the target but was only injured.&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt; Like Richard Gee, Watson had taken on some Family Court cases from his predecessor after Gee had been injured in the March 1984 bombing.&lt;ref name="coulthart"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Coulthart|first1=Ross|title=Investigation exposes the dad accused of an unsolved crime spree that killed four people|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/opinion/investigation-exposes-the-dad-accused-of-an-unsolved-crime-spree-that-killed-four-people/news-story/9e0c22589a2c76bbf88be1ba57d9efff|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=Sunday Telegraph|date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then on 21 July 1985&lt;ref name="yahoo7-sun-night-7-jul-13"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/sunday-night/features/a/17866516/the-family-court-murders/ |title=The Family Court Murders |date=7 July 2013 |work=[[Sunday Night (Australian TV program)|Sunday Night]] |access-date=30 July 2015 |via=au.news.yahoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graham Wykes, a [[Jehovah's Witness]] minister was killed, and another 13 people injured when their [[Casula]] [[Kingdom Hall]] was bombed.&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt;

Also in 1985, an unexploded bomb was found in [[Northmead, New South Wales|Northmead]] under the bonnet of a car. The address was formerly that of a solicitor who acted for a woman in a Family Court case. His name was still listed at that address in the [[phone book]].&lt;ref name=newscom-court&gt;{{cite news |title=Man, 68, arrested for Family Law Court murders and bombings in Sydney in the early 1980s |url=http://www.news.com.au/national/crime/man-68-arrested-for-family-law-court-murders-and-bombings-in-sydney-in-the-early-1980s/story-fns0kb1g-1227461618497 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |work=news.com.au |date=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The attacks were considered an unsolved mystery of Australian crime.&lt;ref name="coulthart" /&gt; In 1984 a {{AUD|500,000}} reward was offered for information,&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt; but was never claimed.&lt;ref name=sun-tele-7-jul-13/&gt;

== Investigations ==
There were two coronial inquests into the attacks. The first was held in 1986 at Glebe Coroner's Court, investigating the death of Graham Wykes.&lt;ref name="wykes-ci"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article118196564 |title=Courts Church bomb linked to court blasts |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |volume=60, |issue=18,452 |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=9 April 1986 |accessdate=3 January 2017 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was held in 1987 by [[Kevin Waller]] into the death of Pearl Watson.&lt;ref name=smh-12-02-87&gt;{{cite news |title=Man linked to bombed judges |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&amp;dat=19870212&amp;id=BStWAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=0OQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4409,6827436&amp;hl=en |accessdate=29 July 2015 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=12 February 1987 |format=scan| via=news.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waller recorded an open verdict, expressing frustration and disappointment that insufficient evidence had been found to charge the main suspect, who had been connected in some way to all of the victims.&lt;ref name="waller"&gt;{{cite news|title=Kevin Waller: First state coroner sought justice in times of disaster|url=http://www.smh.com.au/comment/obituaries/kevin-waller-first-state-coroner-sought-justice-in-times-of-disaster-20140117-3105w.html|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=18 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the State Crime Command's homicide squad restarted an investigation into the crimes.&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb&gt;{{cite news |title=Man charged over Sydney family law court bombings in 1980s |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-07-29/man-arrested-over-sydney-family-law-court-bombings-murders/6656690 |accessdate=29 July 2015 |work=[[ABC News (Australia)]] |date=29 July 2015 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arrest ==
On 29 July 2015 a 68-year-old man was arrested at [[Campbelltown, New South Wales]]. He was charged with "... numerous offences, including four counts of murder and attempted murder." and was refused bail. He now faces 32 charges: "four counts of murder, one of attempted murder, and 13 counts of burning or maiming with an explosive substance in a total of five bombings."&lt;ref name=daily-tele-court-30-jul-15/&gt;

He appeared in Campbelltown Local Court on 30 July 2015. The case was adjourned to 6 August at Central Local Court.&lt;ref name=daily-tele-court-30-jul-15&gt;{{cite news |title=Alleged Family Court bomber fronts court |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/breaking-news/alleged-family-court-bomber-fronts-court/story-fni0xqi3-1227463152848 |accessdate=30 July 2015 |work=The Daily Telegraph (on-line) |agency=AAP |date=30 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the August hearing the suspect did not appear and did not apply for bail.

The man had been a "[[person of interest]]" in the original investigation, and was named as Leonard John Warwick—the brother-in-law of the first victim, Stephen Blanchard.&lt;ref name="revenge"&gt;{{cite news|title=Road to revenge|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/road-to-revenge-20140824-3e8yo.html|accessdate=3 January 2017|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick was remanded in custody until 10 February 2017.&lt;ref name=abc-court-bomb /&gt; Warwick pleaded not guilty to all charges on 2 March 2017, and the judge, Justice Garling, set a trial date of February 2018.&lt;ref name="plead"&gt;{{cite news|title=Accused Family Court bomber formally pleads not guilty over murders and bombings|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-03-03/accused-family-court-bomber-leonard-warwick-pleads-not-guilty/8321354|accessdate=29 May 2017|work=ABC News|date=3 March 2017|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Frito Bandito''' was the [[cartoon]] [[mascot]] for [[Fritos]] [[corn chips]] from 1967 to 1971.  The Bandito was created by the [[Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]] Agency, and animated by [[Tex Avery]].  The character was voiced by [[Mel Blanc]], who used an exaggerated Mexican accent not unlike another character of his, [[Speedy Gonzales]].  The Frito Bandito spoke broken English and robbed people of their Fritos corn chips, a reference to the "Mexican bandit" stereotype in [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies.  

Pressure from the [[National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee]] and others prompted an update to the character; his [[Gold teeth|gold tooth]] and [[Shaving|stubble]] were eliminated and his hair combed.  The character was retired in 1971. He was replaced by the Muncha Bunch, a group of cowboys, and W.C. Fritos, a character modeled after comedian [[W.C. Fields]].

==History==

The Frito Bandito character was developed by the advertising firm [[Foote, Cone &amp; Belding]] and launched by [[Frito-Lay]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=Noriega&gt;{{cite book |last1=Noriega |first1=Chon A. |title=Shot in America: Television, the State, and the Rise of Chicano Cinema |date=2000 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |pages=35 |url=http://www.questia.com/read/109755947/shot-in-america-television-the-state-and-the-rise |url-access=subscription |via=[[Questia Online Library|Questia]] |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Mel Blanc]] provided the character's voice, while the animation was directed by [[Tex Avery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behnken |first1=Brian D. |last2=Smithers |first2=Gregory D. |title=Racism in American Popular Media: From Aunt Jemima to the Frito Bandito |date=2015 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-4408-2977-2 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=euT1BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was a stereotypical [[Mexican revolution]]ary with a [[sombrero]], [[handlebar moustache]] and thick [[Spanish language|Spanish]] accent. He carried two pistols and robbed people of their [[Fritos]] corn chips at gunpoint. The Frito Bandito was originally featured in commercials which aired during children's television shows, but due to the character's popularity, Frito-Lay soon began using the Bandito in all print and television advertising.&lt;ref name=Noriega/&gt;

Frito-Lay was one of several [[United States|American]] companies which featured Mexican revolutionaries in its advertising during the late 1960s—others included the [[Liggett Group|Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company]], the [[Elgin National Watch Company|Elgin Watch Company]], and [[American Motors Corporation|American Motors]].{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=37}} In 1968, two [[Mexican-American]] advocacy groups were founded in opposition to the use of racist stereotypes in advertising: the [[National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee]] (NMAADC) in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[Involvement of Mexican-Americans in Gainful Endeavors]] (IMAGE) in [[San Antonio, Texas]].{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=39}} In response from pressure from the groups, Frito-Lay modified the character to appear more friendly. The gold tooth and beard were also removed. Following the [[assassination of Robert F. Kennedy]] in 1968, the Bandito no longer brandished pistols.{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=43}}&lt;ref name=McComb&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McComb |first1=Don |title=Introduction |journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry |date=1990 |volume=14 |issue=1 |page=3 |doi=10.1177/019685999001400101 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the controversy, Frito-Lay stood by the character. The company cited a survey of four cities in [[California]] and [[Texas]] conducted by Foote, Cone &amp; Belding which found that 85% of [[Mexican American]]s liked the Frito Bandito.{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=43}}&lt;ref name=McComb/&gt; In response, IMAGE and NMAADC shifted their protests to local [[television station]]s which aired Bandito commercials. In 1969, [[KPIX-TV|KPIX]] and [[KRON-TV|KRON]] in [[San Francisco|San Francisco, California]] and [[KNBC]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] became the first stations to ban the character.{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=45-46}}{{sfn|McComb|1990|p=4}} Groups also lobbied the [[Federal Communications Commission]] for free air time to respond to the Frito Bandito under the [[FCC fairness doctrine|fairness doctrine]].{{sfn|McComb|1990|p=4}}{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=46}}

In 1969, Frito-Lay introduced another cartoon mascot: W.C. Fritos (based on comedian [[W.C. Fields]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew F.|last=Smith|title=Fast Food and Junk Food: An Encyclopedia of What We Love to Eat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-WcKK01H1cC&amp;pg=PA291|date=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-39393-8|page=291}}&lt;/ref&gt; By July 1970, the company had stopped airing Bandito commercials in the states of California, [[Oregon]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]], replacing them with ads featuring a group of cartoon cowboys known as Muncha Buncha.{{sfn|Noriega|2000|p=46}} Frito-Lay ended the Frito Bandito campaign in 1971.&lt;ref name=Noriega/&gt;

==Jingle==
The Frito Bandito campaign included a song sung to the tune of the traditional Mexican song "[[Cielito Lindo]]":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Arellano |first1=Gustavo |title=Ask a Mexican |date=2008 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-1-4165-4003-8 |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TsDH5ZgNqjcC&amp;pg=PA120 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gastón Gabriel Mansilla Yupanqui''' (b. 1990), is a Peruvian university student. He studied at [[Universidad Nacional Federico Villarreal]].&lt;ref name="elcomercio.pe"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1359959/noticia-gaston-mansilla-me-siento-indignado-este-pais-no-hay-justicia|title=Gastón Mansilla: “Me siento indignado, en este país no hay justicia” - Lima - Sociedad - El Comercio Peru|website=Elcomercio.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt; He killed Víctor Ríos Acevedo (a.k.a. Niño Viejo/Old Boy) on Saturday January 7, 2012 in an apparent act of self-defense near the intersection of Tacna Avenue and Colmena Avenue, in [[Lima]], Peru.&lt;ref name="elcomercio.pe1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1359076/noticia-universitario-que-mato-asaltante-fue-detenido-bajo-norma-derogada|title=Universitario que mató a asaltante fue detenido bajo norma derogada|date=10 January 2012|website=Elcomercio.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mansilla, two muggers approached him armed with switchblades&lt;ref name="elcomercio.pe"/&gt; and demanded his phone and backpack.  Mansilla, who had a valid concealed weapons permit at the time of the attack, drew his .38 caliber pistol and during a scuffle fired at point blank range, killing Acevedo.  Acevedo's accomplice, Christian Arenas Perona, attempted to flee, but was immediately detained by police.  According to Mansilla's attorney, an eyewitness corroborates Mr. Mansilla's story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1360743/noticia-gaston-mansilla-no-me-arrepiento-usado-mi-arma|title=Gastón Mansilla: “No me arrepiento de haber usado mi arma” - Lima - Sociedad - El Comercio Peru|website=Elcomercio.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansilla was arrested and charged with second degree murder and/or violation of the Peruvian Law of Proportionality,&lt;ref name="elcomercio.pe1"/&gt; a law that had been repealed in 2003. Under the terms of this law, self-defense must be conducted only with a weapon similar to that employed by an attacker. In this case the assailants were armed with knifes.

The Third Penal Court's decision to keep Mansilla in jail during the investigation was immediately objected to by his family and friends who staged a demonstration calling for his immediate release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1359935/noticia-realizaron-planton-libertad-joven-que-disparo-asaltante|title=Realizaron plantón por libertad de joven que disparó a asaltante - Lima - Sociedad - El Comercio Peru|website=Elcomercio.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Education Faculty dean Manuel Asmat and Congressman Juan Díaz Dios presented a writ of ''[[habeas corpus]]'' on Mansilla's behalf.

Congressman Díaz indicated that he would send a report to OCMA and to the president of the Justice System.

On 12 January 2012, José Luis Pérez, head of the Instituto Nacional Penitenciario (INPE), received a judicial order for Mansilla's release&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.terra.com.pe/nacional/gaston-mansilla-saldria-en-libertad-en-las-proximas-horas,c4d1e521be6d4310VgnVCM20000099f154d0RCRD.html|title=Movistar Store|website=Noticias.terra.com.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt; issued by Juan Carlos Aranda Giraldo, who presides over the second penal court, revoking the detention order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvo-peru.com/2012/01/12/gaston-mansilla-recuperaria-su-libertad-en-pocas-horas/] {{dead link|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansilla was liberated on 13 January 2012.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On 13 January 2012 OCMA suspended Puma while the disciplinary process against her is resolved.  On 13 January the judge appeared on the TV Program ''90 seconds'' to defend her actions.  "I am not inept," she declared.  "I have no reason to regret making an [[appeal]]able jurisdictional decision."  She denied that the decision to jail Mansilla pending the investigation was prompted by the Law of Proportionality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rpp.com.pe/2012-01-13-jueza-que-ordeno-reclusion-de-mansilla-no-tengo-por-que-arrepentirme-noticia_440679.html|title=Jueza que ordenó reclusión de Mansilla: No tengo por qué arrepentirme|website=Rpp.com.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The judge turned in her letter of resignation at that time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elcomercio.pe/lima/1362882/noticia-jueza-que-encarcelo-gaston-mansilla-investigada-pese-renuncia|title=Jueza que encarceló a Gastón Mansilla será investigada pese a renuncia|date=19 January 2012|website=Elcomercio.pe}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this did not end the disciplinary investigation against her.

A '''German Salvadoran''' is a [[Salvadoran]] descendant of [[Germans|German]] citizens who have adopted the two nationalities. German Salvadorans are a small ethnic minority, there are few speakers of [[German language|German]], a large majority adopted the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] as well as within the white Salvadoran 90% are descendants of [[Spaniards]]. That does not mean that the country does not have important relations with [[Germany]].

== History ==
One of the most famous Germans who immigrated to [[El Salvador]], was Walter Thilo Deininger, in Cuzcatlan to 1885. Whoever soon built his coffee estate and other industries. Besides a confraternity called (La cofradía de Don Balta), the neighbors were saying, the character of Walter was phlegmatic and good-natured. Soon arrived more German families to [[Cuscatlán Department]], [[El Salvador]], as well as important people like Jürgen Hübner-a German historian and author of "Die Deutschen und El Salvador (The Germans and El Salvador). In the early twentieth century between 10 and 15 families immigrated, although the majority later left the country due to political problems.&lt;ref&gt;('''In Spanish''') ''La Prensa Gráfica'' [http://www.laprensagrafica.com/2013/09/22/la-cofradia-de-don-balta La cofradía de Don Balta] El Salvador, 22 September 2013. Retrieved, 26-11-2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relations between El Salvador and Germany ===
[[Germany]] is one of the main [[European Union|European]] trading partner of [[El Salvador]] and is the largest importer of Salvadoran coffee. The Chamber of Commerce German-Salvadoran consists of around 85 companies. the [[Central American]] integration process was Germany on June 27, 2008 extra-regional observer of the [[Central American]] Integration SICA located in [[San Salvador]]. In addition to a German school in [[San Salvador]].&lt;ref&gt;('''In German''') [http://www.auswaertiges-amt.de/DE/Aussenpolitik/Laender/Laenderinfos/ElSalvador/Bilateral_node.html Auswärtiges Amt-El Salvador] ''Information from Germany about El Salvador''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6558">'''Group dating''' is a modern pattern for dating where a group of single men and a group of single women organise a night out, with the hope of forming romantic partnerships. It is most popular in [[Japan]], where it is known as ''gōkon''.  In other cultures, '''group dating''' is becoming more popular as a safe alternative to single dating (especially [[Blind date|blind dating]]), also helping to ease tension, because both parties will feel more comfortable having the company of their friends.&lt;ref name="Barker2006"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2006-03-08-group-online-dating_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |title=Invite the gang for a night of online dating |date=March 9, 2006 |first1=Olivia |last1=Barker |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group dating is often recommended by parenting experts as more [[age appropriate]] form of dating for preteens than one-on-one dating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentsconnect.com/articles/dealing_w_preteen_dating.jhtml |title=Dealing With Preteen Dating |work=Parents Connect|accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japan== 
In Japan, a {{nihongo|'''''gōkon'''''|合コン}} is a group [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]], typically used to form at least some friendships between two groups that are each of a single sex.  Generally, a single man and woman who know each other organize the ''gōkon'' in advance, each agreeing to bring three or four eligible friends. The venue is usually a restaurant, an [[izakaya]], or anywhere people can eat, drink and make a bit of noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.japanfortheuninvited.com/articles/compa-parties.html |publisher=Japan for the Uninvited |title=Compa Parties |date= June 23, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''gōkon'' comes from the Japanese words ''[[konpa]]'' (a party for members of a single group, class, or club) and ''gōdō'' ("together", "combination").  Generally speaking, ''gōkon'' are not primarily intended to result in one-night stands (something more associated with ''[[nanpa]]''), but rather for making friends and possibly forming long-term relationships. Typically groups of men and women will sit opposite each other and converse with one another, while simultaneously whispering discussions with their same-sex peers about which potential partners they find attractive. Sometimes games are played to reduce tension and encourage a convivial atmosphere.

Recently, writing a [[texting|text]] message on a [[mobile phone]] and showing it to others has become popular as an alternative to whispering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ojr.org/japan/wireless/1094780193.php |title=Matchmaking parties, conquered by keitai |last1=Azuma |first1=Hiroki "Azzie" |date=9 September 2004 |work=Keitai Log |publisher=Japan Media Review |accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
According to an article in ''[[USA Today]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Group online dating, its creators and practitioners say, is safer than traditional Internet dating: With friends in tow, there's little fear that a date will spike your drink during a trip to the bathroom. It's more natural, akin to happy-hour mixing. Going out in groups improves your odds, at least in theory. And if the opposing social circle doesn't live up to its virtual profile, well, it's a night out with your gang."&lt;ref name="Barker2006"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to a ''[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]'' article:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The Concept] is part of a growing trend in the lucrative online dating market – harnessing the power of friends. Several sites are tapping into the idea that most real-world relationships begin, like it or not, with the help and influence of friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20080525/news_1c25datesm.html |title=Online matchmakers ease pressure with group dates |date=2008-05-25 |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |accessdate=18 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Gōkon-style events have also developed independently at [[Oxford]] and [[Cambridge]] universities, where they are known as a Crewdate and [[formal swap]], respectively.

The '''hydrosphere''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ὕδωρ ''hydōr'', "water"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Du%28%2Fdwr ὕδωρ], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and σφαῖρα ''sphaira'', "sphere"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dsfai%3Dra^ σφαῖρα], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt;) is the combined mass of [[water]] found on, under, and above the surface of a [[planet]], [[minor planet]] or [[natural satellite]]. Although, the hydrosphere has been around for longer than 4 billion years. It continues to change in size. This is caused by sea floor spreading and [[continental drift]], which rearranges the land and ocean. &lt;ref&gt;“Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change.” Our Changing Planet: an Introduction to Earth System Science and Global Environmental Change, by Fred T. Mackenzie, 2nd ed., Pearson Education, 2011, pp. 88–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that there are 1,386 million cubic kilometers of water on Earth.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998&gt;{{cite report|url=http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |publisher=UNESCO |date=1998 |accessdate=13 June 2013 |title=World Water Resources: A New Appraisal and Assessment for the 21st Century |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927160221/http://webworld.unesco.org/water/ihp/publications/waterway/webpc/world_water_resources.html |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes water in liquid and frozen forms in groundwater, oceans, lakes and streams. Saltwater accounts for 97.5% of this amount. [[Fresh water]] accounts for only 2.5%. Of this fresh water, 68.9% is in the form of ice and permanent snow cover in the Arctic, the Antarctic, and mountain glaciers.  30.8% is in the form of fresh [[groundwater]]. Only 0.3% of the fresh water on Earth is in easily accessible lakes, reservoirs and river systems.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; The total mass of the [[Earth]]'s hydrosphere is about 1.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]], which is about 0.023% of Earth's total mass. About 20 × 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; [[tonnes]] of this is in [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]] (for practical purposes, 1 cubic meter of water weighs one tonne). Approximately 71% of Earth's [[Planetary surface|surface]], an area of some 361 million square kilometers (139.5 million square miles), is covered by [[ocean]]. The average [[salinity]] of Earth's oceans is about 35&amp;nbsp;grams of [[salt]] per kilogram of sea water (3.5%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Michael J.|last=Kennish|year=2001|title=Practical handbook of marine science|page=35|edition=3rd|publisher=CRC Press|series=Marine science series|isbn=0-8493-2391-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water cycle==
{{main article|Water cycle}}
[[File:Watercyclesummary.jpg|right|393x393px]]
The [[water cycle]] refers to the transfer of water from one state or reservoir to another. Reservoirs include [[Water vapor|atmospheric moisture]] (snow, rain and clouds), streams, oceans, rivers, lakes, [[groundwater]], [[wikt:subterranean#English|subterranean]] [[aquifer]]s, [[polar ice cap]]s and saturated soil. [[Solar energy]], in the form of heat and light ([[insolation]]), and [[gravity]] cause the transfer from one state to another over periods from hours to thousands of years. Most [[evaporation]] comes from the oceans and is returned to the earth as snow or rain.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|27}} [[Sublimation (phase transition)|Sublimation]] refers to evaporation from snow and ice. Transpiration refers to the expiration of water through the minute pores or stomata of trees. [[Evapotranspiration]] is the term used by [[hydrology|hydrologists]] in reference to the three processes together, transpiration, sublimation and evaporation.&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;

[[Marq de Villiers]] has described the hydrosphere as a [[closed system]] in which water exists. The hydrosphere is intricate, complex, interdependent, all-pervading and stable and "seems purpose-built for regulating life."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003&gt;{{cite book|author= Marq de Villiers|title= Water: The Fate of Our Most Precious Resource|url= |accessdate= |year=2003|publisher= McClelland &amp; Stewart|location=Toronto, Ontario|isbn=978-0-7710-2641-6|oclc = 43365804|edition=2|pages=453}}, revised 2003|[[Governor General's Award for English-language non-fiction|Governor General's Award]] (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|26}} De Villiers claimed that, "On earth, the total amount of water has almost certainly not changed since geological times: what we had then we still have. Water can be polluted, abused, and misused but it is neither created nor destroyed, it only migrates. There is no evidence that water vapor escapes into space."&lt;ref name=deVilliersWater2003 /&gt;{{rp|26}}

"Every year the turnover of water on Earth involves 577,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of water. This is water that evaporates from the oceanic surface (502,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and from land (74,200 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). The same amount of water falls as atmospheric precipitation, 458,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on the ocean and 119,000 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on land. The difference between precipitation and evaporation from the land surface (119,000 - 74,200 = 44,800 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) represents the total runoff of the Earth's rivers (42,700 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year) and direct groundwater runoff to the ocean (2100 km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/year). These are the principal sources of fresh water to support life necessities and man's economic activities."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

Water is a basic necessity of life. Since 2/3 of the Earth is covered by water, the Earth is also called the blue planet and the watery planet.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;According to planetary geologist, [[Ronald Greeley]], "Water is very common in the outer solar system."{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Europa holds more water than earth's oceans.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrosphere plays an important role in the existence of the atmosphere in its present form. Oceans are important in this regard. When the Earth was formed it had only a very thin atmosphere rich in hydrogen and helium similar to the present atmosphere of Mercury. Later the gases hydrogen and helium were expelled from the atmosphere. The gases and water vapor released as the Earth cooled became its present atmosphere. Other gases and water vapor released by volcanoes also entered the atmosphere. As the Earth cooled the water vapor in the atmosphere condensed and fell as rain. The atmosphere cooled further as atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in to rain water. In turn this further caused the water vapor to condense and fall as rain. This rain water filled the depressions on the Earth's surface and formed the oceans. It is estimated that this occurred about 4000 million years ago. The first life forms began in the oceans. These organisms did not breathe oxygen. Later, when [[cyanobacteria]] evolved, the process of conversion of carbon dioxide into food and oxygen began. As a result, Earth's atmosphere has a distinctly different composition from that of other planets and allowed for [[Evolutionary history of life|life to evolve on Earth]].

==Recharging reservoirs==
According to Igor A. Shiklomanov, it takes 2500 years for the complete recharge and replenishment of oceanic waters, 10,000 years for [[permafrost]] and ice, 1500 years for deep groundwater and mountainous glaciers, 17 years in lakes and 16 days in rivers.&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt;

==Specific fresh water availability==
"Specific water availability is the residual (after use) per capita quantity of fresh water."&lt;ref name=Shiklomanov1998 /&gt; Fresh water resources are unevenly distributed in terms of space and time and can go from floods to water shortages within months in the same area. In 1998 76% of the total population had a specific water availability of less than 5.0 thousand m3 per year per capita. Already by 1998, 35% of the global population suffered "very low or catastrophically low water supplies" and Shiklomanov predicted that the situation would deteriorate in the twenty-first century with "most of the Earth's population will be living under the conditions of low or catastrophically low water supply" by 2025. There is only 2.5% of fresh water in the hydrosphere and only 0.25% of water is accessible for our use.

'''''Intercourse''''' is a 1987 book by [[Andrea Dworkin]], in which Dworkin offers a [[radical feminism|radical feminist]] analysis of [[sexual intercourse]] in literature and society. Dworkin is often said to argue that "all heterosexual sex is rape", based on the line from the book that says "violation is a synonym for intercourse." However, Dworkin has denied this interpretation, stating, "What I think is that sex must not put women in a subordinate position. It must be reciprocal and not an act of aggression from a man looking only to satisfy himself. That's my point."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.snopes.com/quotes/mackinnon.asp| title= Rape Seeded | website= Snopes.com |first= Barbara |last= Mikkelson | date= 28 September 2007 | accessdate= 25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thesis ==
In ''Intercourse'', Dworkin extended her earlier analysis of [[pornography]] to a discussion of [[heterosexuality|heterosexual]] [[sexual intercourse|intercourse]] itself. In works such as ''[[Woman Hating]]'' and ''[[Pornography: Men Possessing Women]]'', Dworkin had argued that pornography and erotic literature in patriarchal societies consistently eroticized women's sexual subordination to men, and often overt acts of exploitation or violence. In ''Intercourse'', she went on to argue that that sort of sexual subordination was central to men's and women's experiences of sexual intercourse in a male supremacist society, and reinforced throughout mainstream culture, including not only pornography but also in classic works of male-centric literature.

&lt;!-- This needs restructuring. Perhaps an overview discussion of the structure of the book by chapter? --&gt;
Extensively discussing works such as ''[[The Kreutzer Sonata]]'', ''[[Madame Bovary]]'', and ''[[Dracula]]'' (and citing from religious texts, legal commentary, and pornography), Dworkin argued that the depictions of intercourse in mainstream art and culture consistently emphasized heterosexual intercourse as the only or the most genuine form of "real" sex; that they portrayed intercourse in violent or invasive terms; that they portrayed the violence or invasiveness as central to its eroticism; and that they often united it with male contempt for, revulsion towards, or even murder of, the "carnal" woman. She argued that this kind of depiction enforced a male-centric and coercive view of sexuality, and that, when the cultural attitudes combine with the material conditions of women's lives in a sexist society, the experience of heterosexual intercourse itself becomes a central part of men's subordination of women, experienced as a form of "occupation"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Andrea | last= Dworkin| url= http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/IntercourseI.html |title=Chapter 7, "Occupation/Collaboration"| work= Intercourse| publisher= Basic Books; republished at NoStatusQuo.com |year= 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is nevertheless expected to be pleasurable for women and to define their very status ''as women''. Dworkin describes the view of intercourse enforced by saying:

{{quotation|This is nihilism, or this is truth. He has to push in past boundaries. There is the outline of a body, distinct, separate, its integrity an illusion, a tragic deception, because unseen there is a slit between the legs, and he has to push into it. There is never a real privacy of the body that can coexist with intercourse: with being entered. The vagina itself is muscled and the muscles have to be pushed apart. The thrusting is persistent invasion. She is opened up, split down the center. She is occupied--physically, internally, in her privacy. ...

There is no analogue anywhere among subordinated groups of people to this experience of being made for intercourse: for penetration, entry, occupation. There is no analogue in occupied countries or in dominated races or in imprisoned dissidents or in colonialized cultures or in the submission of children to adults or in the atrocities that have marked the twentieth century ranging from Auschwitz to the Gulag. There is nothing exactly the same, and this is not because the political invasion and significance of intercourse is banal up against these other hierarchies and brutalities. Intercourse is a particular reality for women as an inferior class; and it has, in it, as part of it, violation of boundaries, taking over, occupation, destruction of privacy, all of which are construed to be normal and also fundamental to continuing human existence. There is nothing that happens to any other civilly inferior people that is the same in its meaning and in its effect even when those people are forced into sexual availability, heterosexual or homosexual; while the subject people, for instance, may be forced to have intercourse with those who dominate them, the God who does not exist did not make human existence, broadly speaking, dependent on their compliance. The political meaning of intercourse for women is the fundamental question of feminism and freedom: can an occupied people--physically occupied inside, internally invaded--be free; can those with a metaphysically compromised privacy have self-determination; can those without a biologically based physical integrity have self-respect?&lt;ref name= Int&gt;{{cite book| title= Intercourse|first=Andrea | last= Dworkin |publisher= Basic Books| year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|122–124}}|Andrea Dworkin}}

== Controversy ==
Such descriptions are often cited by Dworkin's critics, claiming that ''Intercourse'' argued that "All heterosexual intercourse is rape." That statement, however, is not directly made in the book, and her comparisons of intercourse to "occupation," "possession," "collaboration," etc. are made in the context of discussions of the way in which intercourse is depicted "the discourse of male truth--literature, science, philosophy, pornography",&lt;ref name= Int /&gt;{{rp|122}} and the enforcement of those terms through men's social power over women.

Dworkin rejected the interpretation that "All heterosexual intercourse is rape" as a grave misunderstanding of her work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/LieDetect.html | title= The Lie Detector: The Andrea Dworkin Online Library| publisher= Pushing Buttons/ACLU| accessdate= 25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in  a later interview, she explained:

{{quotation|No, I wasn't saying that [all heterosexual sex is rape] and I didn't say that, then or ever. ... The whole issue of intercourse as this culture's penultimate expression of male dominance became more and more interesting to me. In ''Intercourse'' I decided to approach the subject as a social practice, material reality. This may be my history, but I think the social explanation of the all sex is rape slander is different and probably simple. Most men and a good number of women experience sexual pleasure in inequality. Since the paradigm for sex has been one of conquest, possession, and violation, I think many men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I don't think they need it. I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality. It's important to say, too, that the pornographers, especially ''Playboy'', have published the "all sex is rape" slander repeatedly over the years, and it's been taken up by others like ''Time'' who, when challenged, cannot cite a source in my work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview| url= http://www.nostatusquo.com/ACLU/dworkin/MoorcockInterview.html | subject= Dworkin, Andrea | interviewer= [[Michael Moorcock]] | title= Fighting Talk | work= New Statesman &amp; Society| location= London| date= 21 April 1995| publisher= republished online with permission at NoStatusQuo.com| accessdate= 25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Andrea Dworkin}}

Journalist [[Cathy Young]] wrote that she found Dworkin's explanation hard to square with what Young described as Dworkin's frequent willingness to criticize ordinary heterosexual practices as violent or coercive. Young also wrote that, given Dworkin's expressed views, arguments over whether Dworkin actually said that heterosexual intercourse is rape can be dismissed as "quibbling". Young wrote, "whatever her defenders say, Dworkin ''was'' anti-sex."&lt;ref name=hitrun&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.reason.com/blog/show/109179.html| publisher= Reason.com | title= The Dworkin Whitewash| first= Cathy |last= Young |authorlink=Cathy Young|date= 17 April 2005| work= Hit &amp; Run'' blog''| accessdate= 6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kensiu''' (Kensiw) is an [[Austro-Asiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic language]] of the [[Jahaic languages|Jahaic]] (Northern [[Aslian languages|Aslian]]) subbranch. It is spoken by a small community of 300 in [[Yala Province]] in southern [[Thailand]] and also reportedly by a community of approximately 300 speakers in [[Western Malaysia]] in [[Perak]] and [[Kedah]] States. Speakers of this language are [[Negrito]]s who are known as the [[Mani people]] or Maniq of Thailand.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

==History==
The Thai Maniq and the Malaysian [[Semang]] are reportedly the first modern humans to enter the [[Malay peninsula]]. After the Negrito, the next wave of migrants to arrive were speakers of the Mon–Khmer languages coming most likely from southwestern China. In the course of the millennia, the Negrito lost their original languages and adopted the Mon–Khmer languages of their neighbours and still speak these languages today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter36/text36.htm#ch6 ''The Negrito of Thailand: The Mani''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520173144/http://www.andaman.org/BOOK/chapter36/text36.htm |date=2013-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==

The Maniq settle around the mountainous jungle areas in Southern Thailand and Northern Malaysia. They are considered the original inhabitants of Peninsular Malaysia.  
In Thailand, they are commonly known as the Sakai, Khon Paa or Ngok Paa, the forest people.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

The Maniq in Southern Thailand live in the border provinces of Narathiwat and Yala and in the Baantat Mountain Range of Satul, Trang and Phatthalung provinces.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

In Malaysia, the Maniq are situated between Northern Kedah and the borders of Thailand. However, they have been settling into villages near Baling, Kedah since 1965. There were reports that stated that they are found in Southern Kedah. In 1969, a survey gave a figure of 98 Maniq in Kedah alone. There is a total of 200 Maniq in Thailand and around 2500 in Malaysia. This figure could not be ascertained due to the nomadic lifestyle that the Maniq adopted.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
There are 28 vowels in the Kensiu language: 14 oral [[monophthong]]s and 12 nasal monophthongs, as well as 1 oral and 1 nasal [[diphthong]]. Front, central and back vowels at a tongue height intermediate to the close-mid and open-mid positions (i.e. [[Mid vowel|true-mid]]) are also present. The language does not seem to have any [[Phonation|voice register]] distinction.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

;Nasality and tongue height
It can be observed that there is a contrasting nasal monophthong for each oral monophthong except {{IPA|/ə/}} and {{IPA|/ɚ/}}. The frequency of the nasal vowels are also much less than the oral ones and they are often in a conditioned environment.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

The vowels in Kensiu have five distinctive tongue heights for the front and central vowels and four for the back vowels. The close-mid vowels {{IPA|/e̝, ɚ, ẽ̝/}} have a slightly higher tongue height than their mid counterparts {{IPA|/e, ə, o/}}.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

;Vowel Description&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

The vowels listed below do not include nasalized vowels. Nasalized vowels are marked by a [[tilde]], e.g. {{IPA|/ĩ/}} would be the nasalized equivalent of {{IPA|/i/}}. They also differ from the description of [[Cardinal vowels|Cardinal Vowels]] (CV) with the same symbol.

*{{IPA|/i/}}: Slightly lower and more backed than CV 1.
*{{IPA|/e̝/}}: Lower and further back than CV 2. It does not occur in the environment of final voiced bilabial stops or liquids.
*{{IPA|/e/}}: Lower and more backed than /e̝/. It is unmarked diacritically since it is closer to the position of rest for the tongue.
*{{IPA|/ɛ/}}: Slightly higher and more backed than CV 3. The distribution and frequency are similar to that of {{IPA|/e̝/}}.
*{{IPA|/ɯ/}}: Significantly more fronted than CV 16 but not enough to compare with CV 17. It is also lower in tongue height compared to its comparable cardinal vowel.
*{{IPA|/ɚ/}}: A close-mid central unrounded vowel. It has a [[Retroflex vowel|retroflexed]] quality, probably influenced by Malay contact. It is slightly higher than the schwa {{IPA|[ə]}}. It can occur in stressed syllables in limited environments but is mainly found in unstressed syllables.
*{{IPA|/ə/}}: A mid central unrounded vowel. The tongue height appears to be midway between the close-mid and open-mid positions as shown in the IPA chart. It rarely occurs in stressed syllables.
*{{IPA|/ʌ/}}: Tongue height is slightly higher than CV 14 but significantly more fronted. It is commonly found in unstressed syllables. It also frequently occurs in the closed syllable pattern, CVC.
*{{IPA|/a/}}: An open central unrounded vowel. It is the vowel that occurs most frequently and can co-occur with every initial single consonant and final consonant.
*{{IPA|/u/}}: Slightly lower and fronted than CV 8.
*{{IPA|/o̝/}}: Slightly lower and more fronted than CV 7.
*{{IPA|/o/}}: A mid back rounded vowel.
*{{IPA|/ɔ/}}: Slightly higher and more fronted than CV 6.
*{{IPA|/ie/}}: A close front unrounded lowering diphthong. It occurs only in stressed syllables, always with a final stop. It has an allophone, {{IPA|[ie̝]}}, before a final glottal stop.

;Vowel Contrasts
The vowels do not occur in all environments. The central vowels {{IPA|/ɯ, ɚ, ʌ/}} do not occur in open syllables and {{IPA|/ɚ, ə, ʌ/}} do not occur with final [[Approximant consonant|approximants]] {{IPA|/w, j/}}. The vowels {{IPA|/i, e̝/}} seem to occur rarely with the final [[nasal stop|nasals]] {{IPA|/m, n, ɲ/}}. The incidence of final nasal consonants is very low, however, and it is not possible to conclusively state this as a restriction. With regard to approximants, only {{IPA|/i, e̝, ɛ, a, õ̝/}} can occur with a final {{IPA|/w/}}. {{IPA|/i, ɪ/}} do not occur with a final {{IPA|/j/}}. The diphthong cannot combine with a final approximant and this is probably due to the vocalic nature of the approximants that would violate the syllable patterns.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

;Consonant Allophonic Description and Distribution
[[Unvoiced stop]]s are characteristically [[Aspiration (phonetics)|unaspirated]], but three of the five are (though infrequently) realised as aspirated stops, apparently as a result of borrowings.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

*/p/ is normally realised as a voiceless unaspirated bilabial stop [p], but also has a rare aspirated [[allophone]] [pʰ] in initial position which appears to be the result of a [[Malay language|Malay]] borrowing.
*/t/ is normally realised as an unaspirated alveolar stop syllable initial and final and has a rare aspirated allophone, [tʰ], which appears syllable initial in a [[Thai language|Thai]] borrowing. /t/ has one other occasional allophone [t̪], a voiceless dental or fronted alveolar stop. No phonological conditioning has been recognised that would account for this allophone to date.
*/c/ is a voiceless palatal stop that occurs syllable initial and final, albeit infrequently.
*/k/ is realised phonetically as a voiceless unaspirated velar stop, [k], syllable initially and finally. /k/ has an infrequent aspirated realisation [kʰ] which appears to be in contrast with /kʰ/ in syllable initial position in a limited number of words, majority of which are Thai borrowings.
*/ʔ/ occurs syllable initially and finally on a very frequent basis. Its syllable final distribution seems to be restricted primarily to stressed syllables.
*/b, d, ɟ, g/ are phonetically realised as voiced bilabial alveolar, palatal and velar stops, [b, d, ɟ, g] respectively syllable initially, but as prestopped nasals morpheme final. The voiced stops have a word final allophone with a final nasal assimilating to the same point of articulation as the stop: /b/, [-bm], /d/, [-dn], [ɟ], [-ɟɲ], /g/, [-gŋ].
*/m, n, ɲ, ŋ/, nasal plosives at the bilabial, alveolar, palatal and velar points of articulation, are relatively infrequent in comparison to the oral plosives. The palatal nasal /ɲ/ is the least frequent and least widely distributed of all the nasals. All four nasals occur both syllable initial and final.
*/ɸ/ is a voiceless bilabial fricative which only occurs in syllable final position.
*/s/, a voiceless alveolar fricative, has a palatal allophone [ʃ] in both syllable initial and final positions which appears to be in free variation with [s]. Individual speakers seem to use one allophone consistently, although either realisation is deemed correct by all speakers.
*/h/ is a voiceless glottal fricative that occurs both syllable initial and final.
*/l/ is realised as a palatal allophone [ʎ] in syllable final position. Syllable initially, /l/ is realised as 'clear' lateral approximant [l].
*/w/, a voiced labio-velar central approximant, occurs both syllable initially and finally. It can also occur in the second consonant position of a syllable initial consonant cluster in stressed syllables.
*/ɻ/ is normally realised as a voiced retroflexed central approximant in either syllable initial or final position. However, this phoneme is perceived as a flap [ɾ] when it is the second consonant of a syllable initial cluster. There is one additional occurrence of /ɻ/ which is phonetically realised as a trill [r].

===Suprasegmentals===

;Stress
Kensiu has fixed non-contrastive primary stress which falls on the final syllable of the [[lexeme]]. In addition, minor syllables may be either completely unstressed or secondarily stressed, depending on the presence of [[reduplication]]. The normal, unmarked case, in which no reduplication has taken place, would be completely unstressed. The less frequent, marked case occurs when the final syllable is copied, producing an initial syllable that bears secondary stress. In any event, the application of stress is completely predictable and, while acoustically differing, stress is not contrastive in Kensiu.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

;Tone
Kensiu is not a [[tonal language]], but there is a very small number of pairs of lexemes that contrast only on the basis of a pitch difference. One member of each of these pairs has a normal (mid-level) pitch while the other member has a high level pitch. This pitch difference correlates with a change in meaning.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| gūj 'language' || gúj 'head'
|-
| kēc 'to be stuck' || kéc 'to cut'
|-
| kāp 'to bite' || káp 'deaf and mute'
|}

In addition to these pairs, there are a couple of other lexemes that are spoken with the high pitch, but for which no contrasting mid-level pitch lexeme has yet been found.

;Nasality
Nasality is a [[suprasegmental feature]] of Kensiu vowels. There is a set of 13 nasal vowels.

===Word and syllable structure===
;Word and syllable patterns
Typically, Mon–Khmer languages may have three types of syllables:

*Major syllables with a full inventory of vowels and initial and final consonants. They may occur as monosyllabic words or as the final syllable of disyllabic words, i.e. 'CVC, 'CCVC, CV.'CVC, 'CV.CVC.
*Minor syllables with either a limited inventory of possible [[epenthetic]] vowels occurring medially in an initial consonant cluster or a broader inventory of vowels, but fixed final syllable stress, i.e. CV.'CVC or CV2.CV1C where V2 = [e, a, u, or ɪ] and V1 is essentially unrestricted. Minor syllables occur only as non-final syllables. In Kensiu, they can also have the pattern of CVC.'CV(C).
*Presyllables which have either an epenthetic schwa or a slightly larger inventory of vowels, e.g. [ə, u, i], disrupting an initial consonant cluster. Schwa [ə] presyllables vary with consonant clusters, C&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;CVC ~ CCVC, in some forms. Presyllables occur only as pre-final syllables in disyllabic words.

Kensiu appears to have all three of the above types of syllables, but with the added features of tri- and tetra-syllabic words and with fixed stress in multisyllabic words. In Kensiu, two, three and even four syllable words occur. However, the three and four syllable words appear to be largely Malay borrowings.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

;Reduplication
[[Reduplication]] in Kensiu is a relatively productive process, and it impacts the syllable structure. Reduplicated lexemes generally have the syllable structure CVC.CVC. In addition, occasional initial consonant clusters may be found in the second syllable but not in the first, e.g. [pʌt.plit] ''pʌtplit'' 'to blink quickly, repeatedly'.

There are essentially 3 productive means of reduplication in Kensiu:
&lt;br&gt;
1. Identical consonants, changed vowel (V&lt;sub&gt;−α&lt;/sub&gt;~V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;)
:C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;−α&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;
2. Identical final consonant and vowel, changed initial consonant (C&lt;sub&gt;−β&lt;/sub&gt;~C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;)
:C&lt;sub&gt;−β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;
3. Identical final consonant, changed initial consonant and vowel (C&lt;sub&gt;−β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;−α&lt;/sub&gt;~C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α)&lt;/sub&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;−β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;−α&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;.C&lt;sub&gt;β&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
All 3 strategies copy the base morpheme, with the first syllable as the newly created bound morpheme and the second syllable as the base. The first strategy appears to be the most productive, with the least restrictions on possible constituents. The second strategy copies the final consonant and the vowel of the base identically, but changes the initial consonant of the reduplicative prefixal morpheme. The third reduplicative strategy results in only the final consonant being copied from the base, while the initial consonant and the vowel change. Other general observations regarding reduplication include a high incidence of nasal vowels and of final /ɸ/ in these forms.&lt;ref name="bishop1996" /&gt;

==Morphology and syntax==

Kensiu is a [[Subject–verb–object|SVO]] language. [[Modifiers]] follow the [[Head (linguistics)|head]] as in the following examples:&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, M. M. (1992). Lost in space: discovering spatial [[Locative case|locatives]] in Kensiu. Retrieved from http://msea-ling.info/digidata/495.992/b10212.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{interlinear|lang= kns |number=(1)
|ʔuʔ ŋɔk ʔep bə'lɰʔ jɛʔ
|he sit LOC leg I
|'He sits in my lap.'}}

{{interlinear|lang= kns |number=(2)
|jo̝h'ʔuʔ hɔs ʔep tobm ʔi'huʔ ʔɔdn

|jɛʔ ma ɟɰp pe̝ ga'de̝ ʔep ɟa'la
|I FUT go LOC store LOC yala
|'I will go to the store in Yala.'}}

Spatial locatives in Kensiu indicate position, direction and proximity. There is a contrast between an enclosed location and a nonenclosed location, resulting in the use of two different [[morphemes]], 'ka'pɪgn' and 'ʔep' respectively. With regard to spatial proximity, there are different features that are used to contrast locations, e.g. reach, sight, hearing and walking distance in designating a range of space starting from the speaker's location.

===Words===
There are not many single syllable words in use. A word is usually composed of the following parts:&lt;ref name="Glossary of Aslian Languages." /&gt;

*Major syllable
*[[Minor syllable]]
*Presyllable

===Vocabulary===
Kensiu is one of the Aslian languages that use loan words from other languages, especially [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref name="Glossary of Aslian Languages." /&gt; There are also quite a few words that are [[cognates]] with words from the [[Austroasiatic]] language family.

===Terms of reference and address===
The kinship system of the Maniq closely resembles the [[Hawaiian kinship]] system. However, the Kensiu terminology differs from the Hawaiian system considerably in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, N. (1996). Who's who in Kensiw? Terms of reference and address in Kensiw. The Mon–Khmer Studies Journal, 26, 245-253. Retrieved from {{cite web |url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bishop1996who.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719030049/http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/bishop1996who.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Cousins and siblings are differentiated in terms of relative age rather than sex.
*The term used for aunt and mother are the same but separate terms for father and uncle are used.
*In the second ascending generation, lineal kinsmen (grandparents) use different terms from collateral kinsmen (siblings of grandparents).
*The first descending generation differentiates between one's children and one's siblings' children by the use of younger or elder, specifying whether the connecting parent is older or younger than ego.

==Orthography==

===Writing system===
The alphabet for the Kensiu language was constructed using the [[Thai language|Thai]] script. The decision to use which Thai symbols or graphs were based on the principle of using symbols which most closely represent the value of the symbol in the Thai language. This minimized the number of symbols that would have been reassigned in the Kensiu writing system. This principle also helped to simplify the Kensiu alphabet, so that it would be easier for a reader to transfer reading skills between the two languages. As for the Kensiu features that differ from Thai, adjustments were made to the Thai script.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

===Vowels===
Kensiu vowels differ from Thai in that there are additional vowel heights, contrastive nasalization and no contrastive vowel length.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt; This led to some creative uses of Thai orthographic symbols. A Pali dot was also used to differentiate these contrasting heights in the front, central and back vowels.

Kensiu also has contrastive nasalization that Thai does not have. Since the consonant graphs used to write Kensiu are of the middle or low class Thai consonants, it was believed that the 'ห' from the high class consonants could be used to mark nasalization. The consonant graph was chosen over a diacritic because:&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

*The vowel graphs are already extensive in number.
*The consonant graph maintains a linear order which is easier to learn than diacritics which are non-linear.

The consonant graph is similar to that of Thai's. To many Thai speakers today, Thai words beginning with 'ห' are nasalized even though nasalization is non-contrastive in Thai.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt; This factor also contributed to the choice of 'ห' as a marker for nasalization.

For glottal final syllables, the short vowel symbol is used to denote the vowel height and position as well as a final glottal consonant. The decision to use the short vowels only for syllables ending in a glottal was based on a reader's reaction to the use of the short vowel symbols in the minor syllables and presyllables. Initially, the presyllables and minor syllables were written using short vowels while major syllables were written using long vowels. This was meant to reflect the stress-timing where the major syllable always has primary stress, resulting in a perceived lengthened vowel. However, the reader associated the final glottal stop inalienably with the vowel quality when reading short Thai vowel symbols. As a result, the vowel symbols were changed so that long vowels were used in all syllable types and short vowels used in glottal final syllables only.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

===Consonants===
For Kensiu consonants that are the same as the Thai consonants, the Thai symbol for the consonant was used. For the Kensiu consonants that are not the same as Thai, the consonants were matched with a Thai symbol that has (or has had in the past) the same point and manner of articulation.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

The Kensiu consonants that differ from Thai consonants are:&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;
*Two voiced plosives, /ɟ/ and /g/
*One nasal, /ɲ/
*Two fricatives, /ɸ/ and /ɣ/
*A set of pre-stopped nasals, /bm/, /dn/, /ɟɲ/ and /gŋ/

The voiced palatal /ɟ/ and velar /g/ plosives and the palatal nasal /ɲ/ are not currently found in spoken Thai. In these cases, the Thai symbol that was chosen historically bore the same features as the Kensiu consonant. This resulted in &lt;ย&gt; being assigned to /ɟ/ and &lt;ฆ&gt; to /g/ as both of these are historically voiced plosives. &lt;ญ&gt; was then assigned to /ɲ/.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

The two Kensiu fricatives /ɸ/ and /ɣ/ are not found in the Thai language as well. As a result, &lt;ฟ&gt; was chosen to represent /ɸ/ due to its similarity in point and manner of articulation. &lt;ร&gt; was chosen to represent /ɣ/ as /ɣ/ is the Kensiu pronunciation of /ɻ/ found in Malay words that have been borrowed.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

The pre-stopped nasals /bm/, /dn/, /ɟɲ/ and /gŋ/ contrast with /m/, /n/, /ɲ/ and /ŋ/ in the final syllable position, resulting in the need to distinguish between these consonants in the orthography. The unaspirated stops were initially used to represent the pre-stopped nasals but the reader was unable to decode the word. Eventually, a garand were written above the oral stops representing /bm/, /dn/, /ɟɲ/ and /gŋ/. Writing in this manner allows the reader to recognize the consonant cluster as the representation of the pre-stopped nasal.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

===Consonant clusters===
In Kensiu, the consonant clusters are symbolized in the same manner as Thai clusters. Kensiu has a few more consonant clusters ending in /w/ than Thai does, (i.e. /pw/, /bw/, /tw/, /gw/, /hw/, /mw/, and /lw/).

===Tone===
Kensiu is not a tonal language even though there are some words that have a contrastive high tone and a normative pitch or mid-tone. The mid-tone is unmarked but the high tone is marked by a maitree.&lt;ref name="bishoppeterson2002" /&gt;

==Relationship with other languages==

Kensiu is closely related to most of the indigenous dialects of Southern Thailand. For example, Kensiu and Kintaq Bong (a Northern [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] language) are dialects of the same language. There are also exchanges in lexicon between Kensiu and languages such as Mendriq, Mintil, Bateg Nong, Jehai and Che Wong. What is most interesting is that Che Wong seems to be more closely related to Kensiu although it is spoken some 200 miles away, further than where Mintil is spoken. Kensiu is also relatively more closely related to Mendriq as compared to Jehai, which is spoken 100 miles away.&lt;ref name="Austroasiatic Subgroupings And Prehistory In The Malay Peninsula"&gt;Geoffrey Benjamin (1976) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20019154 Austroasiatic Subgroupings and Prehistory in the Malay Peninsula] Jenner ''et al''  Part I, pp. 37-128&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endangerment==
Kensiu can be considered endangered due to these critical factors:&lt;ref name="Glossary of Aslian Languages." /&gt;
*It belongs to a minority group whose descendants feel embarrassed to speak.
*In recent times, the need to have more contact with other people have risen thus forcing them to learn and speak the surrounding majority group's language, such as Thai or the local Malay languages.
*It does not have a widely used orthography.
*The government's policy limits their settlement areas and forces them to adapt to the cultures and languages of the majority group.
*Modernization, especially with Thai and Malay radio and television have influenced these minority speakers to lifestyles.

All the above factors have a major part to play in the decreasing use of Kensiu.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1744">The '''Krakowiacy''' are a subethnic group of the [[Polish nation]], who reside in the historic province of [[Lesser Poland]], in the area of the city of [[Kraków]]. They use their own dialect, which belongs to Lesser Polish dialect of the [[Polish language]]. Like most Poles, the Krakowiacy are [[Roman Catholics]]. 

In the south (see [[Gorals]]), the extent of the Krakowiacy reaches the line marked by the towns of [[Bielsko-Biała]], [[Wadowice]], [[Kalwaria Zebrzydowska]], [[Myślenice]], [[Lipnica Murowana]] and [[Tarnów]]. In the east, the boundary between the Krakowiacy and the [[Sandomierzacy]] is not well established, reaching as far as [[Tarnów]] and [[Połaniec]]. In the west, the Krakowiacy reach the [[Przemsza]] river, which has for centuries marked the border between Lesser Poland and [[Silesia]]. In the north, they reach the line marked by [[Częstochowa]] and [[Kielce]]. 

The folklore of the Krakowiacy inspired several Polish artists, especially in the [[Young Poland]] period. Furthermore, [[Wojciech Bogusławski]]’s Krakowiacy i Gorale, regarded as first Polish national opera, was first presented in [[Warsaw]], on March 1, 1794. 

The Krakowiacy are divided into two subgroups: 
* Eastern Krakowiacy (Krakowiacy Wschodni), which inhabit the areas north and east of Kraków, from [[Jędrzejów]] and [[Miechów]] to Tarnów, 
* Western Krakowiacy (Krakowiacy Zachodni), residing west and north of Kraków. Their traditional clothes are associated with Kraków costume (''stroj krakowski'').

==Latin Kings==

=== Overview ===
The Latin King street gang was formed in Humboldt Park in Chicago in the early 1950s. The Latin Kings were seen as a Latino progress movement to improve quality in immigrant families overcoming racial discrimination.

=== Subdivisions and size ===
Founded with the philosophy of "overcoming racial prejudice" and creating an organization of "Kings" and "Queens," the Latin Kings evolved into a criminal enterprise operating throughout the United States under two umbrella factions—Motherland, also known as KMC (King Manifesto and Constitution), and Bloodline (New York City). All members of the gang identify as Latin Kings. Only today individuals  of any nationality may be accepted as members. {{citation needed|date=March 2015}}
 
====Motherland faction====

Latin Kings associating with the Motherland faction also identify as "Almighty Latin King Nation (ALKN)," and make up more than 160 structured chapters operating in 158 cities in 31 states. The membership of those Latin Kings in Chicago is estimated to be 20,000 to 35,000.&lt;ref name="pop size"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs32/32146/appb.htm |title=National Gang Threat Assessment 2009 |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2011-02-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214194554/http://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs32/32146/appb.htm |archivedate=2011-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Bloodline faction====

The Bloodline Manifesto was founded by [[Luis Felipe (murderer)|Luis Felipe]] AKA "King Blood" in 1986 in the New York State Collins correctional Facility. Latin Kings associating with New York State Bloodline Chapter also identify as the "Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation (ALKQN)." Membership is estimated to be as many as 7,500, divided among several dozen Tribes operating in 15 cities in 5 states. New York State Bloodline Latin Kings share a common culture and structure with KMC and respect them as the Motherland, but not all chapters report to the Chicago leadership hierarchy.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Organizational structure===
The Latin Kings have a hierarchical organizational structure: they have numerous "chapters" or "tribes" across the country,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.chicagobreakingnews.com/2008/09/drug-charges-coming-against-chicago-street-gang.html |title=FBI: Arrests wipe out Latin Kings leadership |publisher=Chicago Breaking News |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which adhere to a regional, state, and a national system. Officers ( Inca, El-Cacique and War Lord ) are supported by a "Crown Council" of the 5 Crowns Council members. In Chicago they have 7 and Imperial Kings Chapters have slightly different rules about the structure such as in a Connecticut Charter Kings. The Council sets rules and regulations and holds disciplinary hearings.&lt;ref name="gangwar2004" /&gt;

The hierarchy rises to regional officers and ultimately to two supreme regional Incas based in Chicago. The head (or heads) of the entire criminal organization are known as "coronas" ("crowns" in English). The Breakdown of the Crown is the Structure with Color Coded and mathematical using every angle to equal 360• The Crown Structure is Broken down from First Crown Black Onyx Stone for Unity goes to Second Crown Honesty Pearl White , To Green Emerald Third Crown War Lord to keep the Respect and order in the Nation and Ruby Red for The Love and Blood spilt Fourth Crown and 5th Crown is 1st Crown Advisor and Amber Yellow for the Truth is a structural and it works like the Mafia. One retired detective said in 2004: "When you compare them to other street gangs like the [[Bloods]] and the [[Crips]], none compare to the organization of the Latin Kings."&lt;ref name="gangwar2004" /&gt;

===Discipline===
When any member believes that another member has violated a regulation, they begin the disciplinary process by submitting a Procedures for Violation Form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M-Rn9ldraCUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0|title=The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation: Street Politics and the Transformation of a New York City Gang|first1=David C.|last1=Brotherton|first2=Luis|last2=Barrios|date=5 February 2004|publisher=Columbia University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form includes a variety of information about the allegation including the violation, the version of the accused, and members present or other witnesses. If the member is found to be guilty of the violation at their Crown hearing, they may be subject to a range of penalties depending on the severity of the offense:

''Non-Corporal Punishments''
* Probation – for a period ranging between two weeks and two months, can be imposed in addition to other punishments
* Fines (Multas) – may also be used as a way to recoup the expense of gang property when it is destroyed or lost by a member
* Stripping – the member is stripped of their rank and titles, unlikely to ever rise to their previous rank again
* Suspension – the member is stripped of all offices and duties, is not permitted to wear their colors, and is addressed as a novice
* Community service – particular assignments made on a case-by-case basis

''Corporal Punishments''
* B.O.S. (Beat on sight) – beating of undetermined length of time
* Three minute physical – three-minute beating by at least three members
* Five minute physical – five-minute beating by five members
* T.O.S. (Terminate on sight) – death

===Markings===

The Latin King colors are black and gold. Gang markings consist of a 5 or 3-point "sacred crown," writings of LK, ALK, ALKN, ALKQN abbreviations (or the whole words); and drawings of the Lion and/or the King Master.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1189885548231634246&amp;q=crown+town+latin+kings&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2%2C7|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20130124170838/http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1189885548231634246&amp;q=crown+town+latin+kings&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2%2C7|deadurl=yes|title=Salcedo v. Com., 712 SE 2d 8 - Va: Court of Appeals 2011 - Google Sch…|date=24 January 2013|archivedate=24 January 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin King symbolism is usually accompanied with the name and number of the Tribe, region or city of the gang. The Latin Kings are members of the [[People Nation]] alliance of gangs, and are therefore opposed to the rival [[Folk Nation]] gang alliance.&lt;ref name="Florida Department of Corrections"/&gt;

===Culture===

Most Kings wear black/and or gold. The teams Kings represent are usually Chicago teams; such as the [[Chicago Cubs]], and [[Chicago Blackhawks]]. but also the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], [[Pittsburgh Penguins]], [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Los Angeles Kings]] and [[Boston Bruins]].

==="Kingism" ideology===
According to L.A.Kaufman's in the February 2015 issue of the ''[[New York Magazine]]'', 

&lt;blockquote&gt;What also made the Kings different was their unique mixture of intense discipline, revolutionary politics and a homemade religion called "Kingism"—adding idealism and a bootcamp rigor to the usual gang camaraderie—a potent mixture for troubled ghetto kids whose lives lacked structure and hope.&lt;ref name="New York Magazine"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qOgCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=Kingism--adding+idealism+and+a+bootcamp+rigor+to+the+usual+gang+camaraderie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wQWOydPizg&amp;sig=vlJyd22j9taZBjqDX9G4aKy_B24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Lz7xTOz3Ac-YnwfX_LnwCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=New York Magazine|publisher=Books.google.com|accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Kingism as an ideology is a unique blend of tribal gang rhetoric and religious mysticisms. As one member put it, the Manifesto is "considered our Bible," and reading it is to go "from the darkness to the light."&lt;ref name="kingism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-latin-kings-gang-history-20141129-story.html |title=The Inca: Gang leader's trial revealed Latin Kings' culture |accessdate=2016-06-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229193838/http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-latin-kings-gang-history-20141129-story.html |archivedate=2016-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can readily be seen in the following passage from the King's manifesto explaining the significance of the salute, which readily combines organizational fealty with [[Judeo-Christian]] [[theism]] and some variety of nature worship:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A fist upon our heart. It means "I DIE FOR YOU" for you are flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood, son of my mother who is the universal nature and follower of Yahve, who is the Almighty King of Kings.&lt;ref name="kingism" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Latin Kings operate under strict codes and guidelines that are conveyed in a lengthy constitution, and they follow the teachings of the King Manifesto.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KhetLynY5jsC&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=latin+king+manifesto&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XjvY3150y-&amp;sig=YSIZ34lK__yjmd4qLC75bYBG1Hs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=8chsSryrJoXEMIfV-fgG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8 |title=The Almighty Latin King and Queen ...|publisher=Google Books |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}{{Full citation needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/09-06-2006/0004427820&amp;EDATE= |title=Eighteen Members of Almighty Latin King/Queen Nation Named in Federal and State Charges, Reports U.S. Attorney |publisher=.prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715114158/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F09-06-2006%2F0004427820&amp;EDATE= |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Manifesto there are three stages, or cycles of Nation life that constitute Kingism.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rXeTZvvoJRQC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=latin+kings+Primitive+Stage&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t9YRCIsgAE&amp;sig=wB5LugquOM3UMuxflu0f-yaN9D0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qr_FS7XlFKTuNLfItcQO&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CA0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=latin%20kings%20Primitive%20Stage&amp;f=false |title=The Almighty Latin King and Queen ...|publisher=Google Books |date=2004-02-18 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are:

# '''The Primitive Stage''': "That stage in life where the King warrior acts on impulse, executing his action without giving them the serious thought that they demand. A stage of immaturity where the King warrior's time is spent gang banging, getting high, and being recognized as big and bad."
# '''The Conservative Stage''': "At this level the King warrior becomes tired of the primitive stage. He no longer wishes to participate in the senseless routine of gang fighting, hanging on the corner or being recognized as big and bad. Most often at this level the King warrior gets married and retires. It is inappropriate to call this stage maturity stage due to the fact that the King warrior at this time does not really become mature in the sense of maturity. Instead he becomes mummified or reaches a level of accepting life as it has been taught to him by the existing system that exploits all people of color-dehumanizes them and maintains them under the economic and social yoke of slavery."  
# '''The New King Stage''': "The stage of awareness and decision. The new King recognizes that the time for revolution is at hand. Revolution of the mind! The revolution of knowledge! A revolution that will bring freedom to the enslaved, to all Third World people as we together sing and praise with joy what time it is-it is Nation time! ... For him there are no horizons between races, sexes and senseless labels. for him everything has meaning, human life is placed above materialistic values ... When a man become a new King the will of the Nation becomes his will, for to be at variance with the Nation is one thing that cannot endure. The Almighty Latin King Nation requires wholehearted and complete devotion."&lt;ref&gt;Brotherton, D (2013). The almighty Latin king and queen nation: Street politics and the transformation of a New York City gang. Columbia University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Manifesto, "The New King is the end product of complete awareness, perceiving three-hundred and sixty degrees of enlightenment; his observations are free and independent; his thoughts are not clouded by any form of prejudice. The New King no longer views the rival warrior as the cause of his ills; instead, he fights against the Anti-King System (social injustices and inequality), a system which seeks to deny and oppress his people: the Oppressed [[Third World]] Peoples.&lt;ref name="google2" /&gt;

==Bloodline Latin Kings==

Bloodline Latin kings are the same as Chicago Latin kings. Latin kings have different chapters in almost every city in the United States of America all  chapters report to the motherland Chicago, Illinois.

===Leadership===
In the early 1980s, to avoid imprisonment for his criminal activities in Chicago, [[Luis Felipe (murderer)|Luis Felipe]] (a.k.a. King Blood) fled to New York. Soon after arriving in New York Felipe was arrested and convicted of murdering his girlfriend. In 1986, while in prison, Felipe started his own chapter of the Latin Kings known as the Bloodline. He designated himself as Inca and Supreme Crown of the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]. In 1995 Antonio Fernandez (a.k.a. [[King Tone]]) was designated Inca and Supreme Crown of New York State and New Jersey, and the ALKQN once again began a transformation.&lt;ref name="Almighty"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Almighty Latin King and Queen Nation: Street Politics and the Transformation of a New York City Gang|first=David C. |last=Brotherton |publisher=Columbia University Press |date=February 2004 |isbn=0-231-11418-4 |pages=xvi–xix, 158, 159|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Street gang: 1986–1995===
From 1986 to the internal power struggle that erupted in 1994, the ALKQN solidified its role as a gang through crimes such as murder, [[racketeering]], and [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO Act]] charges.&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

In 1991, Felipe was returned to prison after a short release for parole violations stemming from the receipt of stolen goods. However, Felipe continued to guide the ALKQN members, who now numbered about 2,000, both incarcerated and free. In 1994, with the rapid growth of the Latin Kings, an internal power struggle erupted and violence within the Kings ensued. Between June 1993 and February 1994, seven Latin Kings were murdered. Following the outbreaks of internal gang violence, Luis Felipe and 19 others were charged with murder and [[racketeering]]; the indictments ended in 1995 with 39 Latin Kings and 1 Latin Queen indicted under the RICO Act.&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

The details of the charges against Felipe were later revealed: Felipe was charged with ordering the killing of William (Lil Man) Cartagena. Cartegena was taken to an abandoned [[Bronx]] apartment where he was [[strangled]], [[decapitated]], [[mutilated]] and his corpse set on fire. Although Felipe was in prison, the government later alleged he had ordered a TOS ("Terminate On Sight") to all Latin Kings for the murder of Cartagena. This letter and many others were how Felipe was initially linked to three murders on the streets of New York; testimony from former Kings was used as further evidence of the orders. The letters had been copied and stored by the [[New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision|NY Department of Corrections]], who were not aware of the significance of the letters until a federal task force was formed that linked homicide investigators from the [[NYPD]], [[FBI|FBI agents]], and [[Department of Corrections|DOC]] investigators.&lt;ref name="Leader"&gt;{{cite news|title=Leader of Latin Kings Is Convicted in Slayings |first=Lynda |last=Richardson |date=November 20, 1996 |publisher=[[New York Times]] |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE7D9113AF933A15752C1A960958260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation: 1996–1999===
In 1996, following the trial of Luis Felipe,&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/291023/Latin-Kings-A-Street-Gang-Story/overview |title=Latin Kings: A Street Gang Story - Trailer - Cast - Showtimes - NYTimes.com |publisher=Movies.nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antonio Fernandez, who was recently blessed as the Inca and Supreme Crown of [[New York State]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/docs/programs/latin_kings/synopsis.html |title=Documentaries: Home |publisher=[[HBO]] |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; kneeled with other Latin Kings in front of the [[United States district court|Federal District Court in Manhattan]] and is quoted as stating, "It's time for a fresh start ... Now they can't hold our past against us." 1996 is believed to be the beginning of the ALKQN's transformation from a street gang to a "street organization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/20/nyregion/leader-of-latin-kings-is-convicted-in-slayings.html |title=Leader of Latin Kings Is Convicted in Slayings |publisher=nytimes.com |date= November 20, 1996|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latin Kings and Queens began appearing en masse at political demonstrations in support of the Latino community. To further its transformation and efforts to legitimize, the organization began to hold its monthly meetings (universals) at St. Mary's Episcopal Church in [[Harlem|West Harlem]]. At this time, the membership of the Latin Kings is believed to have swelled to 3,000 incarcerated and 4,000 free. The monthly universals drew attendance of 500–600 regularly. Internal changes to the organization began to take place as Fernandez amended the ALKQN manifesto to include parliamentary elections and new procedures for handling inter-organizational grievances and removing death as a possible punishment, replacing it with "vanishing", the act of being banished from the movement.&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

For the ALKQN, 1997 began with Felipe being sentenced to the harshest penalty passed down since [[World War II]]. Felipe was sentenced to 250 years in prison, the first 45 to be spent in [[solitary confinement]]. He was a close friend of criminal (YACS) member Pavle Stanimirovic writes about it as he witnessed this brutality in Solitary confinement. The other 39 members were sentenced to an average of 20 years in prison for their roles in the crimes. The year would bring further legal troubles as Fernandez and 31 others are arrested in a raid in the [[Lower East Side]] and charged with disorderly conduct. The Special Commissioner of Investigation for Schools soon after charges the ALKQN with infiltrating the school system; a school security guard with five years of service was dismissed on charges of unprofessional conduct for his association with the Latin Kings. The year came to a close with Fernandez being arrested in December by the FBI for [[domestic abuse]].&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

The pending charges against Fernandez were dropped in early 1998. Following the release of Fernandez, a joint operation of the [[FBI]], [[New York City Police Department]] (NYPD), [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] (INS), [[New York State Police]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) comes to a close with the arrests of 92 suspected ALKQN members. The Latin King leadership insists over half of those arrested are not members. The operation, dubbed Operation Crown, cost the city over one million dollars and took 19 months to complete.

Fernandez was released after four days on $350,000 bail, which was paid for by contributions from community members must mandatory pay their dues collected every week that goes into the "Caja" Box that the treasurer would be in charge of collecting. Over half of the arrested were charged with [[misdemeanor]]s, other were charged with weapons possession and drug trafficking. Fernandez was eventually permitted, though on house arrest, to attend monthly universal meetings. It was during his time on [[house arrest]] that the Latin Queens underwent a shake up in leadership, dismissing many of the leaders in order to bring in more politically focused members.&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

The Latin Kings during this period begin to gain legitimacy. First, [[Lolita Lebrón]], who was a member of the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], appointed the New York State ALKQN to protect her during a demonstration in front of the United Nations. Following the U.N. demonstration, Rafael Cancel-Miranda, a Puerto Rican nacionalista who spent 25 years in federal prison, attended a monthly universal. Before years' end, Adelfa Vera, Puerto Rican activist, attended a monthly universal and was given sacred ALKQN beads by the present leadership. Adelfa was praised during the meeting and stated "These kids are hope for our liberation struggle. I can die in peace, because we found the continuation."&lt;ref name="Almighty" /&gt;

In 1998, Fernandez&lt;ref name="nytimes2" /&gt; pleaded guilty to conspiracy to sell and distribute heroin. In 1999, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison, which he began serving at [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth|Leavenworth Federal Penitentiary]] in [[Kansas]] and was placed in solitary confinement. He was eventually transferred again and placed in general population. He has since been released.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Massachusetts ==
Operation Dethrone was an investigation by the Western [[Massachusetts]] Gang Task Force, consisting of the FBI, the [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]] Police Department, the Hampden County Sheriff's Department, the Holyoke Police Department, the [[Massachusetts State Police]], the Springfield Police Department, and the West Springfield Police Department. The first phase of the investigation, went after the Lawrence chapter of the ALKQN, was converted to an Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force/High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area case involving numerous federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. After the significant disruption of the [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]] chapter in February 2004, information provided by cooperating defendants led to the significant disruption of the Springfield chapter in June 2005. 57 ALKQN members have been indicted.&lt;ref name=sc&gt;{{cite web|title=Gang Success Stories|url=https://www2.fbi.gov/hq/cid/ngic/success.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin Queens==
While originally the Latin Kings are thought to be a male organization, it eventually began to absorb women and give them an equal share.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} The Latin Queens constituted the female Queen Anubis and Queen Maat of the ALKQN.&lt;ref name="Cultural1104"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cultural Criminology Unleashed |last=Ferrell |publisher=Routledge Cavendish |date=November 2004 |isbn=1-904385-37-0 |pages=67–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin Queen agenda is composed of self-respect, independence, family support, ethnic identity and self-empowerment. Seeking such goals has attracted a wide variety of females who had been drug addicted, victimized and/or neglected by families, spouses and partners. Sociologists studying the Latin Kings and Queens have observed the different methods in which both groups attempt to "reclaim and regulate" their environments. The Latin Queens are believed to focus more on their private space issues such as home life and protection and nurturing of their bodies, as opposed to the Latin Kings, who are more concerned with loss of public spaces in their own communities.&lt;ref name="Cultural1104" /&gt;

The evolution of the ALKQN has been viewed by outside sources as being assisted by the addition and greater role in which Queen Loki and Queen Vailor have played, exposing the ALKQN to a greater range of cross-class supporters than would have been possible prior to their integration.&lt;ref name="Cultural1104" /&gt; In countries such as [[Spain]], Latin Queens are helping to legitimize the ALKQN through integration with government sponsored programs. In [[Catalonia]], the 200 persons including Queen Tragedy and King Zeus and the rest of the Latin Kings and Queens tribe was designated as the Cultural Association of Latin Kings and Queens of Catalonia. The "cultural program" designation was bestowed through government sponsored programs to assist gangs with integration into society and is led by Latin Queen Melody, Erika Jaramillo.&lt;ref name="Latin09"&gt;{{cite news|title=Latin Kings Gang a "Cultural Association" in Barcelona |first=Tito |last=Drago |publisher=Inter Press Service (IPS) |date=September 21, 2006 |url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=34820 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208221030/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=34820 |archivedate=February 8, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Specialists are largely in agreement as to the ethnolinguistic classification of the ethnic groups of Laos.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"&gt;[http://www.asianlii.org/asia/other/ADBLPRes/2006/4.pdf Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document]&lt;/ref&gt; For the purposes of the 1995 census, the government of Laos recognized 149 ethnic groups within 47 main ethnicities.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt; whereas the [[Lao Front for National Construction]] (LFNC) recently revised the list to include 49 ethnicities consisting of over 160 ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt; 

The term ''ethnic minorities'' is used by some to classify the non-Lao ethnic groups, while the term ''indigenous peoples'' is not used by the Lao PDR.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples Development Planning Document"/&gt; These 160 ethnic groups speak a total of 82 distinct living languages.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=LA Ethnologue report for Laos]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a small community of '''Nigerians in the Netherlands''', which began to grow in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The earliest Nigerian asylum-seekers came to the Netherlands in 1987. As of 2006, the primary modes of migration of Nigerians are for marriage, work or study.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Nigerians in the Netherlands for training are employees of [[Royal Dutch Shell]]. There is also some circular migration between [[British Nigerian|Nigerians in the United Kingdom]] and in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study, based on the cohort arriving in 1998, estimated that 25% of Nigerians who arrive in the Netherlands leave after four years. Nigerians point to the relative difficulty of finding work or starting businesses as a major driver for onward migration to the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographic characteristics==
{{asof|2009}}, statistics of the Dutch [[Centraal Bureau voor de Statistiek]] with regards to people of Nigerian origin showed:
*5,283 persons of first-generation background (3,037 men, 2,246 women)
*4,170 persons of second-generation background (2,110 men, 2,060 women), of which:
**2,969 persons with one parent born in the Netherlands (1,507 men, 1,462 women)
**1,201	persons with both parents born outside the Netherlands (603 men, 598 women)
For a total of 9,453 persons (5,147 men, 4,306 women). This represented roughly three times the 1996 total of 3,136 persons. The population has shown a year-on-year increase every year since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|CBS|2009}}; the year 1996 is the earliest for which statistics are available online&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of second-generation Nigerians born in the Netherlands has also shown a consistent rise since 1996. The majority of Nigerian adults in the Netherlands are married, have children, and live in families, rather than alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment==
The Netherlands love Nigerians however they do have a relatively low unemployment rate compared to other migrant groups, as a result of the fact that most migrated for marriage or specifically for employment purposes, rather than as asylum-seekers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 500 Nigerians holding Dutch passports working for large Dutch and international organisations such as [[ABN AMRO]], [[Nike, Inc|Nike]], the [[United Nations]], the former [[CMG (company)|CMG
Consulting]], [[IBM Global Services]], [[Celtel]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], [[KPN]], and the trade unions federation [[Federatie Nederlandse Vakbeweging|FNV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many migrants complain that it is difficult to find work commensurate with their qualifications, and that companies impose Dutch-language requirements for even unskilled work such as cleaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
There is a large amount of coverage in Dutch media about the criminal activities of Nigerians in the Netherlands, which one scholar has described as a "moral panic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Dijk|2001|p=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, a study by international NGO Terre des Hommes estimated that roughly 500 Nigerian minors were employed as prostitutes in the Netherlands, and accused the Dutch embassy in Lagos of complicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2001-11-14|title=Meer Nigeriaanse meisjes in Nederlandse prostitutie|periodical=Trouw|accessdate=2009-10-27|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2001/11/14/2373642/Meer_Nigeriaanse_meisjes_in_Nederlandse_prostitutie.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were typically brought in under false pretences as asylum-seekers. As Dutch law prohibits the deportation of [[unaccompanied minor]]s until it can be ascertained that someone would receive them at their origin, these girls would be placed in shelters, but later disappear.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2182980.ece/Nigerian_human_traffickers_go_on_trial_in_the_Netherlands|title=Nigerian human traffickers go on trial in the Netherlands|date=2009-03-16|accessdate=2009-11-03|first=Sheila|last=Kamerman|first2=Dick|last2=Wittenberg|periodical=[[NRC Handelsblad]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their number was estimated to have risen 25% by 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|date=2002-03-13|first=Heleen|last=Tiemersma|title=Hulp aan kinderprostituee in gevaar|periodical=Trouw|accessdate=2009-10-27|url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2002/03/13/2132914/Hulp_aan_kinderprostituee_in_gevaar.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human traffickers bringing such minors into the Netherlands used occult or "black magic" rituals as a way of exercising psychological control over them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Dijk|2001|p=558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2000 and 2002, Nigerian migrants' involvement in [[advance-fee fraud]] scams also began to show significant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|van Heelsum|Hessels|2006|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=NLC Handelsblad|url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/Features/article2017172.ece/Amsterdam_is_the_centre_of_Nigerian_spam_network|title=Amsterdam is the centre of Nigerian spam network|date=2008-10-08|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 and 2007 report of the [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] pointed to the Netherlands as a major hub of such scams, consisting of counterfeit checks and notifications for false lotteries sent by Nigerian networks in the Netherlands.

An '''out of print''' ('''OOP''') item, typically a [[Out-of-print book|book]], is something that is no longer being [[published]]. It can also include any print or visual medium or [[sound recording]], or video recording such as [[DVD]] or [[Blu-Ray]].

An item goes out of print when a publisher does not reprint, re-press, or reissue after all copies have been sold to retailers.    Reasons may include:
*the perception of the publisher that continuing to produce the work is no longer a commercially viable venture, i.e. that there is no longer a market for it
*a limited [[print run]] (''[[Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern]]'')
*antiquation, or the [[obsolescence]] of content or format ([[laserdisc]], [[VHS]], [[compact cassette]])
*plans for a revised or reformatted edition
*the presence of errors, flaws, fabrication, offensive content, or [[plagiarism]] (sometimes preceded by a [[product recall|recall]])
*[[ban (law)|banning]] or [[censorship]]
*[[intellectual property]] obstacles, such as the expiration of a publisher's license to release content owned by another copyright holder. For example, a [[novelization]] of a film that was released 10 years ago is likely to go OOP for this reason. ''See [[The Criterion Collection#Licenses|licensing]] section in [[The Criterion Collection]] article for an example.''

Out of print items are often pursued by collectors through aftermarket retailers such as [[used bookstore]]s, record shops, and online [[auction sites]]. Sellers of out of print merchandise on auction sites will typically include "OOP" or its equivalent in product descriptions. The designation is sometimes misappropriated&amp;mdash;an example is in [[keyword stuffing]], where the acronym is used to generate numerous search results even as it does not apply to the items retrieved. The abbreviation is sometimes placed in descriptions of items whose publication or production status is unclear (such as DVDs said to be returning to the "[[Disney Vault]]") to affect interest in the product.

'''Richard Farson''' Ph.D., (November 16, 1926 – June 13, 2017)&lt;ref name="obit"/&gt; was an American psychologist, author, and educator. He was the president and chief executive officer of the [[Western Behavioral Sciences Institute]], which he co-founded in 1958 with physicist Paul Lloyd and social psychologist Wayman Crow.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The non-profit WBSI explores ways in which human relations can be improved, democracy strengthened, and people better enabled to reach their potential. Farson directs WBSI's centerpiece program, the International Leadership Forum, a think tank of influential leaders that addresses critical policy issues of the day.

Long interested in the field of design, Farson was founding dean of the School of Design at the [[California Institute of the Arts]] and a 30-year member of the board of Directors of the International Design Conference in Aspen,&lt;ref&gt;International Design Conference in Aspen Papers http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/specialcoll/services/rjd/findingaids/IDCAf.html&lt;/ref&gt; of which he was president for seven years. He served on the [[American Institute of Architects]] Board of Directors and is a Senior Fellow of the [[Design Futures Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Design Futures Council Senior Fellows {{cite web |url=http://www.di.net/about/senior_fellows/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106072349/http://www.di.net/about/senior_fellows/ |archivedate=2007-11-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early career==
Farson attended the [[University of Minnesota]] as a naval officer trainee and then [[Occidental College]], where he received bachelor's and master's degrees. His psychology graduate study was done at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. He then attended [[Harvard Business School]] as a Ford Foundation Training Fellow on the Human Relations Faculty, and the [[University of Chicago]], from which he received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1955.

Farson met psychologist [[Carl Rogers]] at Occidental College in the summer of 1949 and began what was to be a lifelong association. Rogers invited Farson to study with him at the University of Chicago where he became Rogers’ research assistant and eventually an intern and counselor at the Counseling Center and a research associate at the Industrial Relations Center. Farson and Rogers collaborated over several decades on a number of research, education, publication and media projects, including their widely reprinted article, "Active Listening," which introduced that term into the lexicon of human relations training, and the Academy Award-winning documentary film, "[[Journey Into Self]]."

Following two years of postdoctoral active duty as a research officer studying motivation, morale, leadership and training at the U.S. Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego, Farson entered private practice in La Jolla, Calif., as a consulting psychologist. At the same time he teamed with his former University of Chicago professor, [[Thomas Gordon (psychologist)]], best known for his books and programs in parent and leadership effectiveness training, to form the management consulting firm Gordon and Farson Associates.

In 1958 Farson, along with physicist Paul E. Lloyd and social psychologist Wayman Crow, formed the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute (WBSI), an independent, nonprofit organization devoted to research, education and advanced study in human affairs. As president of WBSI during its first decade, Farson led a number of research projects in education, leadership, communication in large organizations, self-directed therapeutic groups and the use of mass media approaches to community mental health. In the latter effort, he conducted the first televised psychotherapy group in the series "Human Encounter," aired in 1966.

After a decade as president, Farson elected to become chairman of the board of WBSI and accepted an appointment as the founding dean of the newly formed School of Design at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], where the emphasis was on social and environmental design. Farson’s continuing interest in these issues is also evidenced by his 30-year membership on the board of directors of the International Design Conference in Aspen, a forum for interdisciplinary discussions of the designed environment. He was twice elected its president, serving from 1976 to 1980 and again from 1994 to 1997. In 1999 he was elected the Public Director (non-architect) to the national Board of Directors of the [[American Institute of Architects]], and in 2001 was named Senior Fellow of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071106072334/http://www.di.net/about/board_advisors/ Design Futures Council].

From 1973 to 1975, Farson was president of [[Esalen Institute]], a non-profit organization devoted to the exploration of human potential. In 1975, he joined the faculty of the [[Saybrook Graduate School and Research Center]], where he supervised the doctoral research of advanced graduate students.

Returning to the presidency of WBSI in 1979, Farson guided the institute’s development of educational, scholarly and therapeutic communities formed through the use of advanced computer communication technologies. The centerpiece of this effort was the School of Management and Strategic Studies, a network of senior executives from 26 countries who joined a distinguished faculty to deliberate, via computer conferencing, on the new requirements of leadership. This project, begun in 1981, launched the now burgeoning field of online [[distance learning]].

==Rights==
A student of social movements, Farson has had a long-time involvement with civil rights issues, notably his pioneering efforts on behalf of women's and children's rights, marked by his 1969 ''Look'' magazine article, "The Rage of Women," and his 1974 book, [http://www.youthrights.net/index.php?title=Birthrights ''Birthrights: A Bill of Rights for Children,''] each of which was the first to bring to a national audience the need for legislative and policy reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19690825&amp;id=X_sNAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=uHsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5002,3696449|title=St. Petersburg Times - Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthrights.net/index.php?title=Youth_rights_movement|title=National Youth Rights Association|website=National Youth Rights Association|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Farson died in La Jolla, California, on June 13, 2017. He was 90.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/lajollalight/obituary.aspx?n=richard-farson&amp;pid=186139414|title=Dr. Richard Farson's Obituary on La Jolla Light|website=La Jolla Light|accessdate=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a '''Salvadoran diaspora in Mexico'''.

==Migration history==
The largest wave of Salvadorans arrived in Mexico as refugees during the [[Salvadoran Civil War]].

==Demographics==
During the 2010 Census, there were 8,088 El Salvador-born individuals registered as living in Mexico.&lt;ref name=INEGI2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Censo de Población y Vivienda 2010|url=http://internet.contenidos.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos//prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/2010/perfil_socio/uem/702825047610_1.pdf|website=[[National Institute of Statistics and Geography (Mexico)|National Institute of Statistics and Geography]]|accessdate=12 June 2015|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Salvadoran consul in Mexico José Antonio Domínguez Mena, as of December 2016 only 10% to 15% of Salvadoran nationals were registered with the [[Instituto Nacional de Migración]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De los salvadoreños en México, sólo 15% está registrado en el INM|url=http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/nacional/de-los-salvadorenos-en-mexico-solo-15-esta-registrado-en-el-inm.html|website=www.elfinanciero.com.mx|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scottish Cant''' (often simply '''Cant''') is a [[cant (language)|cant]] spoken in [[Scotland]] by [[Scottish Travellers|Lowland Scottish Travellers/Gypsies]].&lt;ref name = "Queen's"&gt;Kirk, J. &amp; Ó Baoill, D. ''Travellers and their Language'' (2002) [[Queen's University Belfast]] {{ISBN|0-85389-832-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
A certain amount of [[Northern Romani dialects|Romani]] words have entered Lowland Scottish Cant through intermarriage with [[Romanichal|British Romani]] groups, between 25-35% of Scottish Cant originates in a Romani-derived lexicon.&lt;ref name="Economy 2002"&gt;wilde 1889, cited in Not just lucky white heather and clothes pegs: putting European Gypsies and Traveller economic niches in context. In: Ethnicity and Economy:Race and class revisited. C. Clark (2002). Strathclyde University.&lt;/ref&gt; Containing up to 50% or more Romani loan words in some groups of the central belt of Scotland, those who are [[Romanichal]] or Scottish border gypsies.&lt;ref name="Economy 2002"/&gt; Which demonstrates the intermarriage and links between Scottish travellers and English Romani populations, historically and in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;Roma, Gypsies, Travellers. Jean-Pierre Liégeois. Published by Council of Europe&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with indigenous Highland Traveller populations who are an [[Indigenous peoples|autochthonous]] group of travelling people and not to be confused with British [[New Age Travellers]]. Scottish Highland Cant essentially remains a [[Germanic language]].&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt; The [[Scottish Gaelic]] element in the dialects of Scottish Cant is put anywhere between 0.8% and 20%.&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;

==Use of archaic Scots==
Scottish Cant uses numerous terms derived from Scots which are no longer current in [[Modern Scots]] as spoken by non-Travellers, such as ''mowdit'' "buried", ''mools'' "earth", both from ''muild(s)'', and ''gellie'', from ''gailey'' (galley), "a bothy".&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;

==Gaelic influences==
Loans from Gaelic include words like:&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;
* ''cluishes'' "ears" (Gaelic ''cluasan'' or ''cluais'', a [[dative case|dative]] form of ''cluas'' "ear")
* ''shain'' "bad" (Gaelic ''sean'' "old")

==Romani influences==
There are Romani loans and the percentage of Romani lexical borrowings is said to be up to 50% of the [[lexicon]]; some examples are:&lt;ref name = "Queen's"/&gt;
* ''gadgie'' "man" (Romani ''[[Gadjo (non-Romani)|gadžó]]'' "a non-Romani person")
* ''pannie'' "water" (Romani ''paní'')

'''''Seigneur''''' (English: ''Lord'', German: ''Herr''), was the name formerly given in [[France]] to someone who had been granted a [[fief]] by the crown, with all its associated rights over person and property. This form of lordship was called ''seigneurie'', the rights that the ''seigneur'' was entitled to were called ''seigneuriage'', and the ''seigneur'' himself was the ''seigneur justicier'', because he exercised greater or lesser  [[jurisdiction]] over his fief. Since the repeal of the [[feudal system]] on 4 August 1789 in the wake of the [[French Revolution]], this office has no longer existed and the title has only been used for [[sovereign]] princes by their families.

In common speech, the term ''grandseigneur'' has survived. Today this usually means an elegant, urbane gentleman. Some even use it in a stricter sense to refer to a man whose manners and way of life reflect his noble ancestry and great wealth. In addition, ''Le Grand Seigneur'' had long been the name given by the French to the Ottoman [[sultan]]. ''Notre Seigneur Jésus-Christ '' is the French equivalent of the English ''Our Lord Jesus Christ''.

The word ''[[seignorage]]'' is also derived from ''seigneur''.

The word shares the same provenance as the Italian ''[[Signore]]'', Portuguese ''[[Senhor]]'' and Spanish ''Señor'', which in addition to meaning "Mister" were used to signify a feudal lord.

The title is still used for the hereditary ruler of [[Sark]], an island in the [[English Channel]] which swears fealty to the [[The Crown|British Crown]].

'''Servitka Roma''' (Ukrainian '''Серви''', Russian '''Сэрвы''') is a subgroup of [[Romani people|Romani]]. They formed as a group in [[Ukraine]], where their ancestors had come from [[Serbia]]. Servitka Roma are part of the [[Romani people in Ukraine]] and [[Romani people in Russia|in Russia]], where they are well integrated into general society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.imninalu.net/Gypsies.htm|title=Roma and Gypsies|website=www.imninalu.net|access-date=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also the most numerous group of Ukrainian Roma. Servitka Romani dialect belongs to Ukrainian Group of Romani dialects as classified by L.N. [[Cherenkov]]. Most of Servitka Roma speak poor [[Romani language|Romani]] and use many Ukrainian and Russian words.

Servitka Roma are [[Orthodox Christians]]. Their traditional occupations are smithing and [[fortune-telling]]. In the 19th century many young Servitka Roma also served in [[Cossack]] armies.

Presently, Servitka Roma are one of the best-educated Romani groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They are known as excellent performers of [[Ruska Roma]]ni music and are often incorrectly considered to be Ruska Roma.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''smallpox virus retention controversy''' is a debate that has been ongoing among international scientists and other officials since [[smallpox]] was declared eradicated by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) in 1980. It centers on whether to finally and irreversibly destroy the two last remnants of the virus that causes smallpox, which reside in government laboratories in the [[United States]] and [[Russia]]. Advocates of final destruction maintain that there is no longer any valid rationale for retaining the samples, which represent a hazard, while opponents of it maintain that the samples are needed for further research as smallpox virus may still exist in the world outside of the two labs, and thus may re-emerge, particularly as a [[bio-weapon]].

==Background==
The last cases of smallpox occurred in an outbreak of two cases, one of which was fatal, in [[Birmingham]], UK, in 1978. A [[Medical photography|medical photographer]], [[Janet Parker]], contracted the disease at the [[University of Birmingham Medical School]] and died on September 11, 1978.&lt;ref name= Pennington&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1590/S0042-96862003001000014 |author=Pennington H. |title=Smallpox and bioterrorism |url= http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862003001000014&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en |journal=Bull. World Health Organ. |volume=81 |issue=10 |pages=762–7 |year=2003 |pmid=14758439 |pmc=2572332 |doi-broken-date=2018-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this incident, all known stocks of smallpox were destroyed or transferred to one of two WHO reference laboratories which had [[BSL-4]] facilities—the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) in the United States and the [[State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR]] in [[Koltsovo, Novosibirsk Oblast|Koltsovo]], Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Connor|first=Steve|title=How terrorism prevented smallpox being wiped off the face of the planet for ever|publisher=''The Independent''|date=2002-01-03|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/how-terrorism-prevented-smallpox-being-wiped-off-the-face-of-the-planet-for-ever-672121.html|accessdate=2008-10-03 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984, these two labs have been the only ones authorized by the WHO to hold stocks of live smallpox virus.

In 1986, the WHO first recommended destruction of all virus, and later set the date of destruction to be 30 December 1993. This was postponed to 30 June 1999,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800EED61639F936A15752C0A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|date=1996-01-25|title=Final Stock of the Smallpox Virus Now Nearer to Extinction in Labs|first=Lawrence|last= Altman|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; then again to 30 June 2002. Due to resistance from the U.S. and Russia, in 2002 the [[World Health Assembly]] agreed to permit the temporary retention of the virus stocks for specific research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17323271.300-stay-of-execution.html|title=Stay of execution|date=2002-01-26|publisher=''New Scientist''|accessdate=2007-11-23|first=Debora|last=MacKenzie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Destroying existing stocks would reduce the risk involved with ongoing smallpox research; the stocks are not needed to respond to a smallpox outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BMJ|year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|page=774|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of smallpox virus?|last=Hammond|first=Edward|doi=10.1136/bmj.39155.695255.94|pmc=1851992|pmid=17431261|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scientists have argued that the stocks may be useful in developing new vaccines, antiviral drugs, and diagnostic tests;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=BMJ|year=2007|volume=334|issue=7597|page=775|title=Should the US and Russia destroy their stocks of smallpox virus?|last=Agwunobi|first=John O.|doi=10.1136/bmj.39156.490799.BE|pmc=1851995|pmid=17431262|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7597/775}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review by a team of public health experts appointed by the WHO, however, concluded that no essential public health purpose is served by the U.S. and Russia continuing to retain virus stocks.&lt;ref name=AGIES&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/csr/resources/publications/WHO_HSE_GAR_BDP_2010_4/en/index.html Comments on the Scientific Review of Variola Virus Research, 1999‐2010.] Advisory Group of Independent Experts to review the smallpox research program (AGIES) WHO document WHO/HSE/GAR/BDP/2010.4&lt;/ref&gt; The latter view is frequently supported in the scientific community, particularly among veterans of the WHO Smallpox Eradication Program (1958–79).&lt;ref name=eradedit&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lane |first1=J.Michael |last2=Poland |first2=Gregory A. |year=2011 |title=Why not destroy the remaining smallpox virus stocks? |journal=Vaccine |volume=29 |issue=16 |pages=2823–2824 |doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2011.02.081 |pmid=21376120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ad Hoc Committee on Orthopox Infections==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
An ''Ad Hoc'' Committee on Orthopox Infections, advising the WHO, has debated the fate of the remaining samples of smallpox in the remaining two official repositories since 1980. Smallpox expert [[D. A. Henderson]] has been foremost in favor of destruction, while [[U.S. Army]] scientist [[Peter Jahrling]] has been against it on the basis that further research is needed since he believes that smallpox almost certainly exists outside of the repositories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Preston|Preston, Richard]] (2002), ''[[The Demon in the Freezer]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists have expressed similar opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Damon|first1=Inger k|title=Are we there yet?

==U.S. pro-retention argument (2011)==
In 2011, [[Kathleen Sebelius]], Secretary of the U.S. [[Department of Health and Human Services]], laid out the rationale of the [[Obama Administration]] in a ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed piece. She said, in part:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[In 1980], the WHO called on all nations to destroy their collections of smallpox virus or transfer them to the WHO-sanctioned collections at one of two labs in Russia or the United States. The global public health community assumes that all nations acted in good faith; however, no one has ever attempted to verify or validate compliance with the WHO request…. Although keeping the samples may carry a minuscule risk, both the United States and Russia believe the dangers of destroying them now are far greater…. It is quite possible that undisclosed or forgotten stocks exist. Also, 30 years after the disease was eradicated, the virus’ genomic information is available online and the technology now exists for someone with the right tools and the wrong intentions to create a new smallpox virus in a laboratory…. Destroying the virus now is merely a symbolic act that would slow our progress and could even stop it completely, leaving the world vulnerable…. Destruction of the last securely stored viruses is an irrevocable action that should occur only when the global community has eliminated the threat of smallpox once and for all. To do any less keeps future generations at risk from the re-emergence of one of the deadliest diseases humanity has ever known. Until this research is complete, we cannot afford to take that risk.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kathleen Sebelius|Sebelius, Kathleen]], (2011), [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/26/opinion/26iht-edsebelius26.html?_r=0 “Why We Still need Smallpox”], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (25 April 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*On July 1, 2014, the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) notified the regulatory agency, the [[Division of Select Agents and Toxins]] (DSAT) of the U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), that employees had discovered vials labelled "variola" (smallpox) in an unused portion of a storage room in a U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) laboratory located on the NIH [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]] campus. An investigation is ongoing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2014/s0708-NIH.html “CDC Media Statement on Newly Discovered Smallpox Specimens]” (July 8, 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A media statement was released by the CDC regarding the Bethesda ''variola major'' (smallpox virus) situation seven days after the discovery. It confirmed that ''variola major'' had been found and it had been transferred to a [[BSL-4]] laboratory at the CDC in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]]. Overnight [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] testing had shown the vials did contain ''variola major''. The vials were believed to have been from the 1950s. Further testing to find out if the virus was viable was in progress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further testing showed that the vials which dated from the 1950s contained viable (live) ''variola major'' virus. As of the end of 2014 the vials were placed in a secure freezer to await destruction. The protocol for destruction of ''variola major'' virus involves a member of the WHO being present at the destruction. Usually the observer watches via close circuit television outside the room where the ''variola virus'' will be [[autoclave]]d to destroy it. As a result of the [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola]] outbreak in parts of [[Africa]] at the time, the WHO were overstretched and stated they had no one locally with sufficient security clearance to enter a BSL-4 laboratory. Due to this the WHO were planning to fly an official into Atlanta to oversee the destruction at a future date.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The vials were finally destroyed on February 24, 2015, under the supervision of WHO officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/AboutFDA/ReportsManualsForms/Reports/UCM532877.pdf|title=FDA Review of the 2014 Discovery of Vials Labeled "Variola" and Other Vials Discovered in an FDA-Occupied Building on the NIH Campus|date=13 December 2016|publisher=Director of Laboratory Science and Safety, FDA|access-date=21 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==WHO 2018 position==
As of  May 2018, based on the latest (19th) meeting of the WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research (1–2 November 2017), the question remained as to whether the use of live variola virus for their further development was "essential for public health".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/smallpox/variola-research-november-2017/en/|title=WHO Advisory Committee on Variola Virus Research Report of the Nineteenth Meeting|publisher=World Health Organization|date=May 2018|accessdate=May 31, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Société des gens de lettres de France''' ({{IPA-fr|sɔsjete dɛ ʒɑ̃ də lɛtʁ də fʁɑ̃s|lang}}, "Society of Men of Letters of France"), or '''SGDLF''', is a writers' association founded in 1838 by the notable French authors [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Alexandre Dumas]], and [[George Sand]]. 

It is a private association recognised in France as an establishment in the public interest by decree of December 10, 1891.  

Members of the society must be writers whose work has been published by a [[publishing house]] ([[self-published]] works do not qualify). It is directed by a volunteer committee consisting of 24 writers, and is currently led by the novelist [[Alain Absire]].

==Purpose==
It is the only writer-run writers' association in France with the expressed aim of defending the moral rights, the legal interests, and the social and legal status of all writers. It protects, considers, and proposes new rules and arrangements for the benefit of the community of writers.  

The SGDLF offers social and legal assistance to its members. It has facilities for the deposit of completed works, helping writers guarantee their rights as original author in case of a legal dispute. Each year it organises diverse cultural events and awards a number of [[€]]75,000 prizes in recognition of published works.

==Headquarters==
The SGDLF occupies the 18th-century [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Hôtel de Massa]] on rue de Faubourg-Saint-Jacques in the  [[14th arrondissement of Paris]].  It is building with the strange history of having been moved stone by stone in 1928, from its original site on the [[Champs-Élysées]] to its present site in the garden of the [[Observatoire de Paris]].

'''Standpoint feminism''' is a theory that [[feminist]] social science should be practiced from the standpoint of [[women]] or particular groups of women,&lt;ref name="Hill Collins 2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill Collins |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia Hill Collins |title=Black feminist thought: knowledge, consciousness, and the politics of empowerment |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2009 |isbn=9780415964722}}&lt;/ref&gt; as some scholars (e.g. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] and [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]]) say that they are better equipped to understand some aspects of the world. A feminist or women's standpoint [[epistemology]] proposes to make women's experiences the point of departure, in addition to, and sometimes instead of men's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clough |first=Patricia |title=Feminist thought: desire, power, and academic discourse |publisher=Blackwell |location=Oxford, UK; Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1994 |isbn=9781557864864}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
[[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], teaching at [[University of California, Berkeley]] when the women's movement was in its early stages, looked at the experience of female academics and began to ask about life stories of these women. As a feminist inspired by [[Karl Marx]], Smith turned her attention to the development of "a sociology for women". She founded feminist standpoint theory, which looked at the social world from the perspectives of women in their everyday worlds and the ways in which women socially construct their worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Macionis | first1 = John J. | last2 = Gerber | first2 = Linda M. | title = Sociology: seventh Canadian edition | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall | location = Toronto | year = 2011 | page = 12 | edition = 7th | isbn = 9780138002701 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As theorized by [[Nancy Hartsock]] in 1983, standpoint feminism is founded in [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Lukács | first1 = Georg | author-link1 = Georg Lukács | contribution = Reification and the consciousness of the proletariat | editor-last1 = Lukács | editor-first1 = Georg (author) | editor-last2 = Livingstone | editor-first2 = Rodney (translator) | editor-link1 = Georg Lukács | title = History and class consciousness: studies in Marxist dialectics | publisher = MIT Press | location = London, UK Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1990 | origyear = 1971 | isbn = 9780850361971 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Wylie | first1 = Alison | author-link1 = Alison Wylie | contribution = Feminism in philosophy of science making sense of contingency and constraint | editor-last1 = Fricker | editor-first1 = Miranda | editor-last2 = Hornsby | editor-first2 = Jennifer | editor-link1 = Miranda Fricker | editor-link2 = Jennifer Hornsby | title = The Cambridge companion to feminism in philosophy | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge, UK New York | year = 2000 | page = 175 | isbn = 9780521624695 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hartsock argued that a feminist standpoint could be built out of [[Marx]]'s understanding of experience and used to criticize [[patriarchal]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hartsock | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Hartsock | title = Comment on Hekman's "Truth and Method: Feminist Standpoint Theory Revisited": truth or justice? | journal = [[Signs (journal)|Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society]] | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 367–374 | publisher = [[The University of Chicago Press]] via JSTOR | date = Winter 1997 | jstor = 3175277 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, a feminist standpoint is essential to examining the systemic [[oppression]]s in a [[society]] that standpoint feminists say devalues women's [[knowledge]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Standpoint feminism makes the case that, because women's lives and roles in almost all societies are significantly different from men's, women hold a different type of knowledge. Their location as a subordinated group allows women to see and understand the world in ways that are different and challenging to the existing male-biased conventional wisdom.&lt;ref name="Narayan, U. 1989 pp.256-272"&gt;{{citation | last1 = Narayan | first1 = Uma | author-link1 = Uma Narayan | contribution = The project of feminist epistemology | editor-last1 = Jaggar | editor-first1 = Alison M. | editor-last2 = Bordo | editor-first2 = Susan R. | editor-link1 = Alison Jaggar | editor-link2 = Susan Bordo | title = Gender/body/knowledge: feminist reconstructions of being and knowing | publisher = Rutgers University Press | location = New Brunswick, New Jersey | pages = 256–272 | year = 1989 | isbn = 9780813513799 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standpoint feminism unites several feminist epistemologies. Standpoint feminist theorists attempt to criticize dominant conventional epistemologies in the social and natural sciences, as well as defend the coherence of feminist knowledge.&lt;ref name="Andermahr, S. 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Andermahr | first1 = Sonya | last2 = Lovell | first2 = Terry | last3 = Wolkowitz | first3 = Carol | title = A concise glossary of feminist theory | publisher = Arnold | location = London New York | year = 1997 | isbn = 9780340596630 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, feminist standpoint theories addressed women's standing in the sexual division of labor. Standpoint theorists such as [[Donna Haraway]] sought to show standpoint as the "notion of situated knowledge...to counter the apparent relativism of Standpoint theory".&lt;ref name="Andermahr, S. 1997"/&gt;

This theory is considered to have potentially radical consequences because of the focus on power and the fact that it challenges the idea of an "essential truth",&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Hartsock | first = Nancy | author-link = Nancy Hartsock | contribution = The feminist standpoint: developing the ground for a specifically historical materialism | editor-last1 = Harding | editor-first1 = Sandra | editor-last2 = Hintikka | editor-first2 = Merrill B. | editor-link1 = Sandra Harding | title = Discovering reality: feminist perspectives on epistemology, metaphysics, methodology, and philosophy of science | pages = 283–310 | publisher = Kluwer Academic Publishers | location = Dordrecht Netherlands Boston, Massachusetts London | year = 2003 | isbn = 9781402013195 | edition = 2nd | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the hegemonic reality created, passed down and imposed by those in power.

==Establishing a standpoint==
There has been agreement between feminist standpoint theorists that a standpoint is not just a perspective that is occupied simply by the fact of being a woman. Whereas a perspective is occupied as a matter of the fact of one's socio-historical position and may well provide the starting point for the emergence of a standpoint, a standpoint is earned through the experience of collective political struggle, a struggle that requires both science and politics.&lt;ref name=Bowell&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowell|first1=T.|title=Feminist Standpoint Theory|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fem-stan/|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then went to say that while both the dominant and the dominated occupy perspectives, the dominated are much more successfully placed to achieve a standpoint. However, this is not saying that those who occupy perspectives that are not-marginalized cannot help in reaching a shared critical conscientious with relation to the effects of power structures and epistemic production. Only through such struggles can we begin to see beneath the appearances created by an unjust social order to the reality of how this social order is in fact constructed and maintained. This need for struggle emphasizes the fact that a feminist standpoint is not something that anyone can have simply by claiming it. It is an achievement. A standpoint differs in this respect from a perspective, which anyone can have simply by 'opening one's eyes.'&lt;ref&gt;Harding, S. (1991). ''Whose Science/ Whose Knowledge?'' Milton Keynes: Open University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mansplaining==
Part of the feminist version of the standpoint theory is a concept called [[mansplaining]]. From a feminist point of view, mansplaining is defined as a male explaining something to a female in an incorrect and simple way. Mansplaining also makes the male who is doing the explaining seems overconfident about the topic and makes him seem condescending. It is even said that the concept that the man is explaining sometimes is something that the woman he is explaining it to already knew and that he may have even interrupted the woman who was first trying to explain it. 
It is not clear where this idea of mansplaining began but a common idea is that this kind of activity has been around for centuries. However, in more modern times the birth of the idea was in the year 2008 with [[Rebecca Solnit]]'s essay "Men Explain Things To Me", which appeared in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In this essay Solnit did not use the term mansplaining but talked about the experience she had where a male explained a book to her, which she had actually written. From there, the term slowly increased and gained popularity through feminist blogs. 
According to this idea, women are seen as inferior to men. Women are also seen as being a lot more interrupted by men because men just have the need to prove their point a lot more than women do. This concept says that men have the tendency to interrupt and that women have the tendency to be interrupted not only by men but by other women as well. Women have also been shown to accept being interrupted in a lot more of a kindly manner than men do. This may be drawn back to the point from this feminist concept that men see themselves as the ones who have the power and are inferior when it comes to explaining things. This goes along with the feminist view of the standpoint theory because feminist feel that women are seen as less powerful than men just because they are female and that if something needs to be explained correctly that men are the ones who take control and they explain it even when they are not really experts in that subject.
On the other hand, others view this concept as problematic and stereotypical towards males as it makes all men seem like they are constantly trying to take control and that they seem like they know more than women do. One author explains that the term isn’t fair to explain men who highly support gender equality and this concept can also be seen as gender inequality.&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, A. (2016, March 31), [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/it-s-man-s-and-woman-s-world/201603/the-psychology-mansplaining "The Psychology of Mansplaining"], ''Psychology Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strong objectivity and the relation to feminist standpoint==
According to Nancy Naples&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.uconn.edu/naples/|title=Faculty Biography Page for Nancy Naples|last=Naples|first=Nancy|date=|website=University of Connecticut|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, "The notion of strong objectivity was first articulated by feminist philosopher [[Sandra Harding]]. Strong objectivity builds on the insights of feminist standpoint theory, which argues for the importance of starting from the experiences of those who have been traditionally left out of the production of knowledge. By starting inquiry from the lived experiences of women and others who have been traditionally outside of the institutions in which knowledge about social life is generated and classified, more objective and more relevant knowledge can be produced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naples|first1=Nancy A.|title=Stong Objectivity|journal=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|date = 2007|doi =  10.1111/b.9781405124331.2007.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Naples also stated that Harding argued that knowledge produced from the point of view of subordinated groups may offer stronger objectivity due to the increased motivation for them to understand the views or perspectives of those in positions of power. A scholar who approaches the research process from the point of view of strong objectivity is interested in producing knowledge for use as well as for revealing the relations of power that are hidden in traditional knowledge production processes. Strong objectivity acknowledges that the production of power is a political process and that greater attention paid to the context and social location of knowledge producers will contribute to a more ethical and transparent result.

Joseph Rouse says, "The first lesson suggested by standpoint theories has not been sufficiently emphasized in the literature. Standpoint theories remind us why a naturalistic conception of knowing is so important. Knowledge claims and their justification are part of the world we seek to understand. They arise in specific circumstances and have real consequences. They are not merely representations in an idealized logical space, but events within a causal nexus. It matters politically as well as epistemically which concepts are intelligible, which claims are heard and understood by whom, which features of the world are perceptually salient, and which reasons are understood to be relevant and forceful, as well as which conclusions credible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.2009.01068.x|last=Rouse|first=Joseph|title=Standpoint Theories Reconsidered|work=Hypatia|accessdate=6 December 2012|url=https://wesfiles.wesleyan.edu/home/jrouse/StandpointAPATlk.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Black feminist==
Black feminist thought is a collection of ideas, writings, and art that articulates a standpoint of and for black women of the African Diaspora. Black feminist thought describes black women as a unique group that exists in a "place" in US social relations where intersectional processes of race, ethnicity, gender, class, and sexual orientation shape black women's individual and collective consciousness, self-definitions, and actions.&lt;ref&gt;Few, L. A. (2007). ''Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology''.&lt;/ref&gt; As a standpoint theory, black feminist thought conceptualizes identities as organic, fluid, interdependent, multiple, and dynamic socially constructed "locations" within historical context. Black feminist thought is grounded in black women's historical experience with enslavement, anti-lynching movements, segregation, Civil Rights and Black Power movements, sexual politics, capitalism, and patriarchy. Distinctive tenets of contemporary black feminist thought include: (1) the belief that self-authorship and the legitimatization of partial, subjugated knowledge represents a unique and diverse standpoint of and by black women; (2) black women's experiences with multiple oppressions result in needs, expectations, ideologies, and problems that are different from those of black men and white women; and (3) black feminist consciousness is an ever-evolving concept. Black feminist thought demonstrates Black women's emerging power as agents of knowledge. By portraying African-American women as self-defined, self-reliant individuals confronting race, gender, and class oppression, Afrocentric feminist thought speaks to the importance that knowledge plays in empowering oppressed people. One distinguishing feature of Black feminist thought is its insistence that both the changed consciousness of individuals and the social transformation of political and economic institutions constitute essential ingredients for social change. New knowledge is important for both dimensions to change.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, P. H. (1990). ''Black Feminist Thought: Knowledge, Consciousness, and the Politics of Empowerment''. Boston: UnwinHyman.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tina Campt]] uses standpoint theory to examine the narrative of the [[Afro-German]] [[Hans Hauck]] in her book ''Other Germans''.

First introduced by [[Patricia Hill Collins]], black feminist standpoint is known to be a collective wisdom of those who have similar perspectives from subordinate groups of society. Collins offers two main interpretations of the consciousness of oppressed groups.
* The first claims that those who are being oppressed identify with the dominant groups and therefore have no effective self-governing interpretation of their own oppression.
* The second approach assumes that the subordinate are 'less human' than those above them making them less capable of understanding and speaking of their own experiences. While Black women may have common experiences, this does not imply that all Black women have developed the same thoughts as one another.
Black feminist standpoint theory aims to bring awareness to these marginalized groups and offer ways to improve their position in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2016|title=Black Feminist Women and Standpoint Theory|url=|journal=HubPages|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill Collins|first1=Patricia|title=Black Feminist Thought|date=1 June 2002|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|location=New York|isbn=9781135960148|url=https://www.taylorfrancis.com/books/9781135960148|doi=10.4324/9780203900055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though similar in some ways, Black feminist standpoint theory has many differences compared to the original theories of [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]] and [[Nancy Hartsock]] about standpoint theory. Black feminist standpoint argues that the knowledge gained about an individual or other groups in society is gained from multiple factors related to their historical position in society. Black women offer an alternative position that reveals a representation of others from a different perspective. Feminist standpoint theory aims to acknowledge the diversity of women by welcoming the views of other oppressed groups of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reynolds|first=Tracey|date=4 July 2002|title=Re-thinking a black feminist standpoint|url=|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|doi=10.1080/01419870220136709|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike those in the privileged social groups, black women have access to knowledge about everyone from the most oppressed to the most privileged. This is due to the fact that certain realities of oppression are invisible to those who are in the dominant groups because they do not experience this oppression in the same way as the oppressed group. The privileged group may be totally unaware of how their actions may affect the subordinate group. Black women, on the other hand, have a better perspective (o different standpoint) from direct experience and can offer suggestions to help other marginalized groups of our society. This standpoint of black women can also be seen as a "bifurcated consciousness", which is the ability to see things both from the perspective of the dominant and from the perspective of the oppressed and, therefore, to see both perspectives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Not all women, however, have exactly the same experiences. Because of this, there is no singular standpoint of all women. This led to the development of black feminist epistemology. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] first introduced the idea of Black feminist [[epistemology]] saying that it derives from the personal experience of Black women dealing with both [[racism]] and [[sexism]]. She uses this [[epistemology]] to empower black women to hold their own control. She describes them as "outsiders within". By this she means that Black women have experienced enough from the inside to understand where they lie socially while also having enough distance from the dominant groups to offer a critique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Heidi Mirza]] also offers an analysis of black feminist standpoint theory saying that new dialogues are formed out of the unique perspective of black feminist women. Mirza recognizes that black women are sometimes known as the "other" and offers her term saying they have a status as a 'third space' between the margins of race, gender, and class. Mirza suggests that in this space, there is "no official language and discourse. Because of this, Black women are put in the position of 'active agents' and are responsible to share their perspective and offer new insights."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

It was not until the latter part of the 1990s that there was more of a focus on black women. A number of both films and published works by and about black women began to emerge. This marked an important transition from years past when the only works to be published or put on screen were those of more dominant groups. The only works of black women that are recognized previous to this time are those from the early part of the nineteenth century. The works of [[Mary Prince]] (1831) and [[Mary Seacole]] (1837) are the more commonly known writings today. Aside from those few, the next notable published work was not until [[Sylvia Wynter]] (1962) and [[Maryse Condé]] (1988), leaving a gap of over 120 years of little to no work of black women. This gap shows how powerless black women were in a market position. Although we see more and more work of Black women in our society today, there still remains a lack of control and limited input over their works; it must be confined to certain areas in order for them to have any opportunity and publication.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Essentialism===
Criticism of standpoint feminism has come from [[Postmodern feminism|postmodern feminists]], who argue that there is no concrete "women's experience" from which to construct knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Benhabib | first = Seyla | author-link = Seyla Benhabib | title = From identity politics to social feminism: a plea for the nineties | journal = Philosophy of Education Yearbook 1995 | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | page = 14 | publisher = Urbana: Philosophy Education Society | date = 1995 | url = http://ojs.ed.uiuc.edu/index.php/pes | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the lives of women across space and time are so diverse it is impossible to generalize about their experiences.  Standpoint feminism has absorbed this criticism, to an extent (see below).

== Contemporary standpoint feminism ==

Many standpoint feminists now recognize that because of the many differences that divide women it is impossible to claim one single or universal "women’s experience".&lt;ref name="Narayan, U. 1989 pp.256-272"/&gt; Because sexism does not occur in a [[vacuum]], it is important to view it in relation to other systems of domination and to analyze how it interacts with [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[colonialism]], and [[classism]] in a "matrix of domination".&lt;ref name="Hill Collins 2000"/&gt;

Contemporary standpoint feminist theory perceives that it is "a relational standpoint, rather than arising inevitably from the experience of women"&lt;ref name="Andermahr, S. 1997"/&gt; (see [[difference feminism]]). Standpoint feminists have recently argued that individuals are both oppressed in some situations and in relation to some people while at the same time are privileged in others. Their goal is to situate women and men within multiple systems of domination&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zinn | first1 = Maxine Baca | last2 = Dill | first2 = Bonnie Thornton | author-link1 = Maxine Baca Zinn | title = Theorizing difference from multiracial feminism | journal = [[Feminist Studies]] | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–331 | publisher = Feminist Studies, Inc. via JSTOR | jstor = 3178416 | date = Summer 1996 | doi = 10.2307/3178416 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.2307/3178416 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a way that is more accurate and more able to confront oppressive power structures. One of the critiques of this stance is that such an intense focus on the many differences between women obliterates the very similarities that might bond women together. If this is that case, trying to create a broad-based feminist community or building consensus on specific policy becomes difficult.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15019">In [[Human subject research|research of human subjects]], a '''survey''' is a list of questions aimed at extracting specific data from a particular group of people. Surveys may be conducted by phone, mail, via the internet, and sometimes face-to-face on busy street corners or in malls. Surveys are used to increase knowledge in fields such as [[social research]] and [[demography]]. 

Survey research is often used to assess thoughts, opinions, and feelings.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shaughnessy|first1=J.|last2=Zechmeister|first2=E.|last3=Jeanne|first3= Z.|title=Research methods in psychology|edition=9th|year=2011|publisher=[[McGraw Hill]]|location=New York, NY|pages=161–175}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveys can be specific and limited, or they can have more global, widespread goals. [[Psychologists]] and [[sociologists]] often use surveys to analyze behavior, while it is also used to meet the more pragmatic needs of the media, such as, in evaluating political candidates, public health officials, [[professional organizations]], and [[advertising]] and marketing directors. A survey consists of a predetermined set of questions that is given to a sample.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;  With a representative sample, that is, one that is representative of the larger population of interest, one can describe the attitudes of the population from which the sample was drawn. Further, one can compare the attitudes of different populations as well as look for changes in attitudes over time. A good sample selection is key as it allows one to generalize the findings from the sample to the population, which is the whole purpose of survey research.

==Types==

===Census===
{{Main article|Census}}
A ''census'' is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording [[information]] about the members of a specific given [[population]]. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population.&lt;ref name="BaffourKing2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baffour|first1=Bernard|last2=King|first2=Thomas|last3=Valente|first3=Paolo|title=The Modern Census: Evolution, Examples and Evaluation|journal=International Statistical Review|volume=81|issue=3|year=2013|pages=407–425|issn=0306-7734|doi=10.1111/insr.12036}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used mostly in connection with [[Population and housing censuses by country|national population and housing censuses]]; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The [[United Nations]] defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as "individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years.

===Other household surveys===
{{See|List of household surveys in the United States}}
Other surveys than the census may explore characteristics in households, such as fertility, family structure, and demographics.

Household surveys with at least 10,000 participants include:
*'''[[General Household Survey]]''', conducted in private households in [[Great Britain]]. It is a repeated [[cross-sectional study]], conducted annually, which uses a sample of 9,731 households in the 2006 survey.
*'''[[Generations and Gender Survey]]''', conducted in several countries in [[Europe]] as well as [[Australia]] and [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Demographic Research, Volume 17, Book 1|publisher=BoD – Books on Demand|year=2008|isbn=9783837031959}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme has collected least one wave of surveys in 19 countries, with an average of 9,000 respondents per country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Generations and Gender Programme|url=http://www.ggp-i.org/about/about-ggp.html|website=www.ggp-i.org|accessdate=2016-02-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206055218/http://www.ggp-i.org/about/about-ggp.html|archivedate=2016-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia Survey]]''', where the wave 1 panel consisted of 7,682 households and 19,914 individuals
*'''[[Integrated Household Survey]]''', a survey made up of multiple other surveys in the [[UK]]. It includes about 340,000 respondents, making it the largest collection of social data in the UK after the census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/method-quality/specific/social-and-welfare-methodology/integrated-household-survey/index.html Integrated Household Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[National Survey of Family Growth]]''', conducted in the [[United States]] by the [[National Center for Health Statistics]] division of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] to understand trends related to fertility, family structure, and demographics in the United States.&lt;ref name=official&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg.htm|title = National Survey of Family Growth|publisher = [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|accessdate = April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006-2010 NSFG surveyed 22,682 interviews.
*'''[[Panel Study of Income Dynamics]]''' in the [[United States]], wherein data have been collected from the same families and their descendants since 1968. The study started with over 18,000 nationally representative individuals.&lt;ref name=psid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psidonline.isr.umich.edu/Studies.aspx|title=PSID - Studies|website=University of Michigan, Institute for Social Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; It involved more than 9,000 individuals as of 2009.
*'''[[Socio-Economic Panel]]''', a longitudinal panel dataset of the population in [[Germany]]. It is a household based study which started in 1984 and which reinterviews adult household members annually. In 2007, the study involved about 12,000 households, with more than 20,000 adult persons sampled.
*'''[[UK households: a longitudinal study]]''', now known as ''Understanding Society''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.understandingsociety.org.uk/ Understandingsociety.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Its sample size is 40,000 households from the [[United Kingdom]] or approx. 100,000 individuals.

===Opinion poll===
{{Main article|Opinion poll}}
[[File:Dewey Defeats Truman.jpg|thumb|November 3, 1948: President [[Harry S. Truman]], shortly after being elected as President, smiles as he holds up a copy of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' issue predicting his electoral defeat. This image has become iconic of the consequences of bad polling data.]]

An ''opinion poll'' is a survey of [[public opinion]] from a particular [[sampling (statistics)|sample]]. Opinion polls are usually designed to represent the opinions of a population by conducting a series of questions and then extrapolating generalities in ratio or within [[confidence intervals]].

==Methodology==
{{Main article|Survey methodology}}
A single survey is made of at least a sample (or full population in the case of a census), a method of data collection (e.g., a questionnaire) and individual questions or items that become data that can be analyzed statistically. A single survey may focus on different types of topics such as preferences (e.g., for a presidential candidate), opinions (e.g., should abortion be legal?), behavior (smoking and alcohol use), or factual information (e.g., income), depending on its purpose. Since survey research is almost always based on a sample of the population, the success of the research is dependent on the representativeness of the sample with respect to a target population of interest to the researcher. That target population can range from the general population of a given country to specific groups of people within that country, to a membership list of a professional organization, or list of students enrolled in a school system  (see also [[sampling (statistics)]] and [[survey sampling]]).

==Interpretation==

===Correlation and causality===
{{Further|Correlation does not imply causation}}
When two variables are related, or correlated, one can make predictions for these two variables.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt;  However, it is important to note that [[correlation does not imply causation|this does not mean causality]]. At this point, it is not possible to determine a causal relationship between the two variables; correlation does not imply causality. However, correlation evidence is significant because it can help identify potential causes of behavior. Path analysis is a statistical technique that can be used with correlational data. This involves the identification of mediator and moderator variables. A mediator variable is used to explain the correlation between two variables. A moderator variable affects the direction or strength of the correlation between two variables. A spurious relationship is a relationship in which the relation between two variables can be explained by a third variable.

Moreover, in survey research, correlation coefficients between two variables might be affected by [[Observational_error | measurement error]], what can lead to wrongly estimated coefficients and biased substantive conclusions. Therefore, when using survey data, we need to [[Correction_for_attenuation| correct correlation coefficients for measurement error]]. The Survey Quality Predictor software ([http://sqp.upf.edu SQP]) provides information about the quality of a survey question, i.e. the strength of the relationship between the latent concept of interest that the survey questions intends to measure, and the measured value given by the survey question and gives the necessary information to the user to correct their correlation coefficients for measurement error  (&lt;ref&gt;DeCastellarnau, A. and Saris, W. E. (2014). A simple procedure to correct for measurement errors in survey research. European Social Survey Education Net (ESS EduNet). Available at:  [http://essedunet.nsd.uib.no/cms/topics/measurement/ http://essedunet.nsd.uib.no/cms/topics/measurement]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Saris | first1 = W. E. | last2 = Revilla | first2 = M. | year = 2015 | title = Correction for measurement errors in survey research: necessary and possible | url = | journal = Social Indicators Research | volume =  127| issue = 3| pages =  1005–1020| doi = 10.1007/s11205-015-1002-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;)

===Reported behavior versus actual behavior===
The value of collected data completely depends upon how truthful [[respondent]]s are in their answers on questionnaires.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; In general, survey researchers accept respondents’ answers as true. Survey researchers avoid reactive measurement by examining the accuracy of verbal reports, and directly observing respondents’ behavior in comparison with their verbal reports to determine what behaviors they really engage in or what attitudes they really uphold.&lt;ref name="Shaughnessy2011"/&gt; Studies examining the association between self reports (attitudes, intentions) and actual behavior show that the link between them—though positive—is not always strong—thus caution is needed when extrapolating self-reports to actual behaviors,&lt;ref&gt;Morwitz, Vicki G., and David Schmittlein. "Using segmentation to improve sales forecasts based on purchase intent: Which" intenders" actually buy?." Journal of Marketing Research (1992): 391-405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chandon, Pierre, Vicki G. Morwitz, and Werner J. Reinartz. "Do intentions really predict behavior? Self-generated validity effects in survey research." Journal of Marketing 69.2 (2005): 1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ajzen, Icek, and Martin Fisbbein. "Factors influencing intentions and the intention-behavior relation." Human Relations 27.1 (1974): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Dishonesty is pronounced in some sex-related queries, with men often amplifying their number of sex partners, while women tend to downplay and slash their true number.&lt;ref&gt;Wiederman, Michael W. "The truth must be in here somewhere: Examining the gender discrepancy in self‐reported lifetime number of sex partners." Journal of Sex Research 34.4 (1997): 375-386.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Statistical Society of London]] pioneered the [[questionnaire]] in 1838.&lt;ref&gt;

The most famous public survey in the [[United States of America]] is the [[United States Census | national census]]. Held every ten years since 1790, the census attempts to count all persons, and also to obtain demographic data about factors such as household income, ethnicity, and religion. The  results of the [[2010 US census]] appear online at  https://www.census.gov/2010census/data/

[[Nielsen ratings]] (carried out since 1947) provide another example of public surveys in the United States. Nielsen ratings track media-viewing habits (radio, television, internet, print) the results of which are used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to make decisions by and about the mass media. Some Nielsen ratings localize the [[data points]] to give [[marketing firm]]s more specific information with which to target customers. Demographic data is also used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to understand what influences work best to market consumer products, political campaigns, etc.

Following the invention of the telephone survey (used at least as early as the 1940s&lt;ref&gt;

'''T. Gnananandam''' was a [[Pastor]] of the [[Protestant]] [[Convention of Baptist Churches of Northern Circars]] and was Principal of the [[Baptist Theological Seminary]], [[Kakinada]] during 1968-1969,&lt;ref name="Souvenir"&gt;C. L. Johnson (Edited), ''Canadian Baptist Mission 125 year's Jubilee Celebrations of Baptist Churches in Northern Circars'', Baptist Theological Seminary, Kakinada, 1999, p.217-219.[http://www.worldcat.org/title/canadian-baptist-mission-125-years-jubilee-celebration-1874-1999-souvenir/oclc/433990749]&lt;/ref&gt; the shortest ever in the history of the [[seminary]].
==Studies==
From 1945-1951,&lt;ref name="Directory"/&gt; Gnananandam studied [[Bachelor of Divinity]] at [[Serampore College]], [[Serampore]] during the Principalships of G. H. C. Angus and C. E. Abraham.&lt;ref name="Directory"&gt;[[S. J. Samartha]], [[M. P. John]] (Compiled), ''Directory of students 1910-1967'', Serampore College (Theology Department), Serampore, 1967, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Career==
Gnananandam became Principal of the [[seminary]] in 1968 succeeding [[Paul Antrobus]] at a crucial time when efforts were made to close-down the institution as it remained a residual seminary due to the [[ecumenical]] initiatives it undertook to form the [[Andhra Christian Theological College]] in 1964.

The ''Indian Church History Review'' of the Church History Association of India records that the [[seminary]] was completely shut down in July 1969 and the students on its rolls were transferred to the [[Ramayapatnam]] Baptist Theological Seminary in [[Ramayapatnam]].  It was only after a few months that T. Gnananandam finally relocated to [[Ramayapatnam]] to join the faculty there.&lt;ref name="CHAI"&gt;''Indian Church History Review'', Volume 13, [[Church History Association of India]], 1979, pp.81-82.

The '''Udis''' (self-name ''Udi'' or ''Uti'') are a native people of the [[Caucasus]]. Currently, they live in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Russia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Armenia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Ukraine]] and many other countries. The total number is about 10,000 people. They speak the [[Udi language]]. Some also speak [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]] and [[Armenian language]]s depending on where they reside. Their religion is [[Christianity]].

== History ==
The Udi are considered to be the descendants of the people of [[Caucasian Albania]]. According to the classical authors, the Udi inhabited the area of the eastern Caucasus along the coast of the Caspian Sea, in a territory extending to the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] in the north, as well as the ancient province of [[Utik]]. Today, most Udis belong to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] while others are still trying to restore the [[Church of Caucasian Albania|Parthian Church of Caucasian Albania]]. Centuries of life in the sphere of [[Turco-Persian|Turco-Persian society]] influenced their culture, as is expressed in Udi folk traditions and the material culture.&lt;ref name="red book"&gt;[http://www.eki.ee/books/redbook/udis.shtml The Red Book of Peoples: The Udis]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Udi are first mentioned in [[Herodotus]]' ''[[Herodotus Histories|Histories]]'' (5th century BC). Describing the [[Battle of Marathon]], during the Greek-Persian war (490 BC), the author noted that Udi soldiers also were at war as a part of nine [[satrapy]] of the Persian army. The Udis are mentioned in the ''[[Geographica]]'' of the ancient Greek writer [[Strabon]] (1st century BC) in his description of the [[Caspian Sea]] and the Caucasian Albania.  

The ethnic term "Udi" was mentioned first in the [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural history]] by the ancient Roman author [[Pliny the Elder]] (1st century AD). Further ancient information about the Udi people can be found in books by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century), [[Gaius Asinius Quadratus]] and many other authors. Since the 5th century, the Udi people are often mentioned in the Armenian sources. More extensive information is given in ''The History of Aluank''&lt;ref&gt;[http://udins.ru/%20index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=103 Movses Kagancatvasiy, ''The History of Aluank'' (в 3-х книгах)]&lt;/ref&gt; by Movses Kagancatvasiy. The Udi were one of the predominating Albanian tribes &lt;ref&gt;[http://udins.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=25&amp;Itemid=95 К. В. Тревер К вопросу о культуре Кавказской Албании (доклад на XXV Международном конгрессе востоковедов, 1960 год)]&lt;/ref&gt; and they were considered the creators of Caucasian Albania. The Byzantines cooperated extensively with their leader [[Sandilch]] in the latter half of the 6th century.

Both capitals of Caucasian Albania: Kabalak (also called Kabalaka, Khabala, Khazar, today's Qabala) and Partav (also called Partaw, today's [[Barda, Azerbaijan|Barda]]), were located in the historical territory of the Udi. They occupied extensive territories from the bank of the Caspian Sea to the [[Caucasian Mountains]], on the left and right banks of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]]. One of the regions in this area was named "Utik". After the conquest of the Caucasian Albania by the Arabs, the number of the Udi and their territory were gradually reduced.

== Udi villages ==
Until 1991, the main Udi villages were Vartashen and Nij in Azerbaijan, as well as the village of Zinobiani in Georgia. In the recent past, Udi people also lived in [[Mirzəbəyli|Mirzabeily]], [[Soltannuxa|Soltan Nuha]], [[Corlu, Azerbaijan|Jourlu]], [[Mıxlıqovaq|Mihlikuvah]], [[Kərimli, Oghuz|Vardanli]] (now Kərimli), Bajan, Kirzan, and [[Yenikənd, Qabala|Yenikend]], in contemporary times they have mostly assimilated with the people of Azerbaijan.&lt;ref name="kuznetsov"&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/kagantv/udiny.html Игорь Кузнецов. Удины]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Vartashen was mainly a Udi village, where the Vartashen dialect of the [[Udi language]] was spoken by about 3000 people in the 1980s. The Udis of Vartashen belonged to the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and had Armenian surnames. During the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]], the Udis as well as the [[Armenians in Azerbaijan|Armenians]] were expelled to Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://chai-khana.org/en/fading-on-being-udi-in-armenia|title=Fading - On Being Udi in Armenia|last=Avetisyan|first=Armine|date=|website=Chaikhana|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 50 Udi people remained among some 7000 ethnic Azeris in the town, which was renamed to [[Oghuz (city)|Oğuz]].&lt;ref name="schulze"&gt;Wolfgang Schulze: ''[http://udilang.narod.ru/papers/Schulze_History-of-Udi.pdf Towards a History of Udi.]'' International Journal of Diachronic Linguistics 1, 2005, pp. 55–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the only place of concentrated Udi settlement are the village of Nij in Azerbaijan and the village of Zinobiani in Georgia, which was founded by Udi refugees from Vartashen in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="schulze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kuznetsov" /&gt;

A significant group of Udi live in the [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] village of Zinobiani, founded by Udi from Vartashen in the 1920s. Small groups reside in [[Russia]] in the [[Rostov Oblast|Rostov region]] (Shahty, [[Taganrog]], [[Rostov-na-Donu]], [[Azov]], Aleksandrovka); in the [[Krasnodar Krai|Krasnodar territory]] ([[Krasnodar]], areas of Dinskoy, Leningrad, Kushchevsky); in the [[Stavropol Krai|Stavropol Territory]] (Minvody, Pyatigorsk); in the [[Volgograd Oblast|Volgograd region]] ([[Volgograd]], Dubovy Ovrag); and also in [[Sverdlovsk Oblast|Sverdlovsk]], Ivanovo, Kaluga areas, [[Moscow]], [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Astrakhan]]; in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in the outskirts of [[Tbilisi]], [[Poti]], [[Rustavi]], in [[Armenia]] mainly in the [[Lori Province]], and Aktau in [[Kazakhstan]]. Some also live in [[Ukraine]]'s ([[Kharkiv oblast]]).&lt;ref name="schulze" /&gt;

== Language ==
{{main|Udi language}}
The [[Udi language]] is a [[Northeast Caucasian languages|Northeast Caucasian language]] of the [[Lezgic languages|Lezgic branch]]. The two primary dialects are ''Nij'' (Nidzh) and ''Vartashen.'' The people today also speak [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. The Udi are commonly bilingual, and less frequently trilingual, depending on residence and work. Many use Udi only in daily life, but for official purposes, the Udi use the language of the country in which they reside, such as Azerbaijani or Russian.

=== Dialects ===
The Udi language has two dialects: Nidzh and Vartashen. Nidzh dialect has sub-dialects that are divided into three subgroups - bottom, intermediate, top. Linguists believe the dialects originated according to geographic groupings of the Udi from the Tauz region: the villages of Kirzan and Artzah (Karabah, v. Seysylla, Gasankala) moved to Nidzh and Oguz.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/kagantv/udiny.html Игорь Кузнецов. Удины.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vartashen dialect has two sub-dialects: Vartashen and Oktomberry. 

=== History ===
In the past the Udi language was one of the widespread languages of Caucasian Albania on the basis of which, in the 5th century the [[Caucasian Albanian alphabet|Caucasian Albanian script]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vehi.net/istoriya/armenia/kagantv/yazyk.html И. В. Кузнецов. Заметки к изучению агванского (кавказско-албанского) письма]&lt;/ref&gt; was created. The alphabet had 52 letters. The language was widely used, as major Bible texts were translated into the Caucasian Albanian language. Church services were conducted in it. After the fall of the Albanian state, the Caucasian Albanian liturgical language was gradually replaced by Armenian in church.{{reference needed|date=January 2018}}

Due to their Caucasian Udi language and their Christian faith, the Udis are regarded as the last remnants of the old Caucasian Albanians. Under Persian rule, some of them converted to Islam, and soon adopted the Azeri language. The Armenian Apostolic Church held services exclusively in ancient Armenian language and refused to ordain a local Udi priest, against which Udis protested:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Archives of Armenia]], fund 56, list 1, file 5214, p. 1 (in Armenian, English translation taken from [http://www.raa-am.com/Nizh/NIZH_E_1.htm A Brief introduction on Nizh village.] Samvel Karapetian, Research on Armenian Architecture (RAA), Հայկական ճարտարապետությունն ուսումնասիրող հիմնադրամ (Armenian Architecture Research Fund), consulted on 25 January 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;:
{{Cquote
| quote = ...our strong desire is that our pastor be a representative of our people, for although we belong to the Church of St. Gregory the Enlightener, our language is different: we are the Uti and we know that these people live nowhere except for the villages of Nizh and Vardashen. We do not have the slightest command of the Armenian language; nor have we any idea about what the Gospel says...
}}
Whereas the Udis of Vartashen remained in the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Udi Christians of Nij changed from the Armenian to the Russian Orthodox Church soon after the beginning of Russian rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raa-am.com/Nizh/NIZH_E_1.htm A Brief introduction on Nizh village.] Samvel Karapetian, Research on Armenian Architecture (RAA), Հայկական ճարտարապետությունն ուսումնասիրող հիմնադրամ (Armenian Architecture Research Fund), consulted on 25 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Population and changes ==
In 1880, the population of the Udi people living in the area around [[Qabala]] in northern Azerbaijan&lt;ref&gt;[http://lingvarium.org/maps/caucas/13.gif Map showing in dark green the Udi area in 1800]&lt;/ref&gt; was estimated at 10,000. In the year 1897, the number of the Udi people was given around 4.000, in 1910, it was around 5.900. They were counted as 2.500 in the census of 1926, as 3.700 in 1959, as 7.000 in 1979, and in 1989, the Udi people numbered 8.652. In census of 1999 in Azerbaijan, there were 4152 Udis.&lt;ref&gt;Петрушевский И. П., Очерки по истории феодальных отношений в Азербайджане и Армении в XVI&amp;nbsp;– начале XIX в.в., Л., 1949, с. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Udi people in Azerbaijan"&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2002 Russia Census]], 3721 residents identified as Udi. Most of the Udi people (1573 persons) in Russia have been registered in Rostov region.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

The '''Uzbeks''' (''Oʻzbek/Ўзбек'', pl. ''Oʻzbeklar/Ўзбеклар'') are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[ethnic group]]; the largest Turkic ethnic group in [[Central Asia]]. They comprise the majority [[population]] of [[Uzbekistan]] but are also found as a minority group in [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Russia]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="China"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Minorities/min-Uzbek.html|title=Uzbek Minority – Chinese Nationalities (Ozbek)|publisher=|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uzbek diaspora communities also exist in [[Turkey]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[Uzbeks in Pakistan|Pakistan]].

==Etymology==
The origin of the word ''Uzbek'' remains disputed. One view holds that it is [[eponym]]ously named after [[Oghuz Khagan]], also known as ''Oghuz Beg'', became the word ''Uzbek''.&lt;ref name="H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin p.312"&gt;A. H. Keane, A. Hingston Quiggin, A. C. Haddon, Man: Past and Present, p.312, Cambridge University Press, 2011, Google Books, quoted: "Who take their name from a mythical Uz-beg, Prince Uz (beg in Turki=a chief, or hereditary ruler)."&lt;/ref&gt;
Another states that the name means ''independent'' or the ''lord itself'', from ''Oʻz'' (self) and the Turkic title ''[[Beg (title)|Bek/Bey/Beg]]''. There is another theory which holds that the pronunciation of ''Uz'' comes from one of the [[Oghuz Turks]] variously known as ''Uz'' or ''Uguz'' united with the word ''Bey'' or ''Bek'' to form ''uguz-bey'', meaning "leader of an [[oghuz (tribe)|oguz]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacLeod|first=Calum|title=Uzbekistan: Golden Road to Samarkand|page=31|author2=Bradley Mayhew }}{{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Before, 5th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was part of [[Sogdia]], mainly inhabited by Sogdians, an Indo-Iranian people. It was part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] and later part of [[Sasanian Empire]]. From 5th to 6th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was part of the [[Hephthalite Empire]]. From 6th to 8th century, what is today's Uzbekistan was under the rule of [[Göktürk Khanate]]. Turkic and Chinese migration into central Asia occurred during the Chinese [[Tang Dynasty]], and Chinese armies commanded by [[Turks in the Tang military|Turkic generals]] stationed in large parts of central Asia. But Chinese influence ended with the [[An Lushan rebellion]]. From the 9th century on, [[Transoxania]] was under the rule of Turkic [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]], their arrival in Transoxania signalled a definitive shift from Iranian to Turkic predominance in Central Asia. Kara-Khanid ruler [[Sultan Satuq Bughra Khan]] was the first Turkic ruler to convert Islam, most people of Central Asia soon followed. In the 12th century, Transoxania was conquered by Qara Khitai (Western Liao), a sinicized [[Khitan people|Khitan]] dynasty, they brought to Central Asia the Chinese system of government. In the 13th century, Kara-Khanid Khanate was destroyed by the Turkic [[Khwarazmian dynasty]], a vassal of the Qara Khitai.

Although [[Turko-Mongol]] infiltration into Central Asia had started early,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

}}&lt;/ref&gt; as late as the 13th century when [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Mongol]] armies finally conquered the entire region, the majority of Central Asia's peoples were [[Iranian peoples]] such as [[Sogdians]], [[Bactrians]] and, more ancient, the [[Saka]]–[[Massagetae]] tribes. It is generally believed that these ancient [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European-speaking]] peoples were linguistically assimilated by smaller but dominant Turkic-speaking groups while the sedentary population finally adopted the [[Persian language]], the traditional ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the eastern Islamic lands.&lt;ref name="Iranica"&gt;Richard H. Rowland, Richard N. Frye, C. Edmund Bosworth, Bertold Spuler, Robert D. McChesney, Yuri Bregel, Abbas Amanat, Edward Allworth, Peter B. Golden, Robert D. McChesney, Ian Matley, Ivan M. Steblin-Kamenskij, Gerhard Doerfer, Keith Hitchins, Walter Feldman. ''Central Asia'', in [[Encyclopaedia Iranica]], v., Online Edition, 2007, ([http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v5f2/v5f2a017.html LINK])&lt;/ref&gt; The language-shift from [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] to Turkic and New Persian was predominantly the result of an ''elite dominance'' process.&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Nauta, "Der Lautwandel von a &gt; o and von a &gt; ä in der özbekischen Schriftsprache," Central Asiatic Journal 16, 1972, pp. 104–18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Raun, Basic course in Uzbek, Bloomington, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; This process was dramatically boosted during the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol conquest]] when millions were either killed or pushed further south to the [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] region.

The modern [[Uzbek language]] is largely derived from the [[Chagatai language]] which gained prominence in the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid Empire]]. The position of Chagatai (and later Uzbek) was further strengthened after the fall of the [[Timurids]] and the rise of the [[Muhammad Shaybani|Shaybanid Uzbek Khaqanate]] that finally shaped the Turkic language and identity of modern Uzbeks, while the unique grammatical&lt;ref&gt;A. von Gabain, "Özbekische Grammatik", Leipzig and Vienna, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; and phonetical features of the Uzbek language as well as the modern Uzbek culture reflect the more ancient Iranian roots of the Uzbek people.&lt;ref name="Iranica" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

===Genetic origins===
The modern Uzbek population represents varying degrees of diversity derived from the high traffic invasion routes through Central Asia. Once populated by [[Iranian people|Iranian]] tribes and other [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European people]], Central Asia experienced numerous invasions emanating out of [[Mongolia]] that would drastically affect the region. According to recent [[genetic genealogy]] testing from a University of Oxford study, the genetic admixture of the Uzbeks clusters somewhere between the [[Iranian peoples]] and the [[Mongols]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the 3d century B.C., Central Asia experienced nomadic expansions of Altaic-speaking oriental-looking people, and their incursions continued for hundreds of years, beginning with the Hsiung-Nu (who may be ancestors of the Huns), in ~300 B.C., and followed by the Turks, in the 1st millennium A.D., and the Mongol expansions of the 13th century. High levels of [[haplogroup C-M130|haplogroup 10]] [C-M130] and its derivative, [[haplogroup C-M210|haplogroup 36]] [C-M210], are found in most of the Altaic-speaking populations and are a good indicator of the genetic impact of these nomadic groups. The expanding waves of Altaic-speaking nomads involved not only eastern Central Asia—where their genetic contribution is strong, [...]—but also regions farther west, like Iran, Iraq, Anatolia, and the Caucasus, as well as Europe, which was reached by both the Huns and the Mongols. In these western regions, however, the genetic contribution is low or undetectable (...), even though the power of these invaders was sometimes strong enough to impose a language replacement, as in Turkey and Azerbaijan (...). The difference could be due to the population density of the different geographical areas. Eastern regions of Central Asia must have had a low population density at the time, so an external contribution could have had a great genetic impact. In contrast, the western regions were more densely inhabited, and it is likely that the existing populations were more numerous than the conquering nomads, therefore leading to only a small genetic impact. Thus, the admixture estimate from North-East Asia is high in the east, but is barely detectable west of Uzbekistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/342096 |author=Tatjana Zerjal|title=A Genetic Landscape Reshaped by Recent Events: Y-Chromosomal Insights into Central Asia |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |year=2002 |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=466–482 |pmid=12145751 |pmc=419996|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==

===Ancient history===
[[File:Kaunakes Bactria Louvre AO31917.jpg|thumb|upright|Female statuette bearing the kaunakes. Chlorite and limestone, [[Bactria]], beginning of the 2nd millennium BC]]
The heart of Central Asian history goes back to the earliest [[Bronze Age]] colonists of the Tarim Basin were people of Caucasoid physical type who entered probably from the north and west, who may have spoken languages ancestral to the Indo-European [[Tocharian languages]] documented later in the Tarim Basin. These early settlers occupied the northern and eastern parts of the Tarim Basin, where their graves have yielded mummies dated about 1800 BC. They participated in a cultural world centered on the eastern steppes of central Eurasia, including modern northeastern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan.
[[File:Napoli BW 2013-05-16 16-24-01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] at the [[Battle of Issus]].]]

The first people known to have inhabited Central Asia were [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] nomads who arrived from the northern grasslands of what is now Uzbekistan sometime in the first millennium BC. These nomads, who spoke Iranian dialects, settled in Central Asia and began to build an extensive irrigation system along the rivers of the region. At this time, cities such as Bukhoro (Bukhara) and Samarqand (Samarkand) began to appear as centers of government and culture. By the 5th century BC, the [[Bactria]]n, [[Sogdiana|Soghdian]], and [[Yuezhi|Tokharian]] states dominated the region.

As China began to develop its silk trade with the West, Iranian cities took advantage of this commerce by becoming centers of trade. Using an extensive network of cities and settlements in the province of [[Mawarannahr]] (a name given the region after the Arab conquest) in Uzbekistan and farther east in what is today China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, the Soghdian intermediaries became the wealthiest of these Iranian merchants. Because of this trade on what became known as the [[Silk Route]], Bukhoro and Samarqand eventually became extremely wealthy cities, and at times Mawarannahr (Transoxiana) was one of the most influential and powerful Persian provinces of antiquity.&lt;ref name=eh&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Early history". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Alexander the Great conquered Sogdiana and Bactria in 327 BC, marrying [[Roxana]], daughter of a local Bactrian chieftain. The conquest was supposedly of little help to Alexander as popular resistance was fierce, causing Alexander's army to be bogged down in the region that became the northern part of Hellenistic [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. For many centuries the region of Uzbekistan was ruled by Persian empires, including the [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] Empires.

===Early Islamic period===
The [[Muslim conquests|conquest of Central Asia]] by Muslim [[Arabs]], which was completed in the 8th century AD, brought to the region a new religion that continues to be dominant. The Arabs first invaded Mawarannahr in the middle of the 7th century through sporadic raids during their conquest of Persia. Available sources on the Arab conquest suggest that the Soghdians and other Iranian peoples of Central Asia were unable to defend their land against the Arabs because of internal divisions and the lack of strong indigenous leadership. The Arabs, on the other hand, were led by a brilliant general, [[Qutaybah ibn Muslim]], and were also highly motivated by the desire to spread [[Islam|their new faith]] (the official beginning of which was in AD 622). Because of these factors, the population of Mawarannahr was easily subdued. The new religion brought by the Arabs spread gradually into the region. The native religious identities, which in some respects were already being displaced by Persian influences before the Arabs arrived, were further displaced in the ensuing centuries. Nevertheless, the destiny of Central Asia as an Islamic region was firmly established by the Arab victory over the Chinese armies in 750 in a [[Battle of Talas|battle]] at the [[Talas River]].&lt;ref name=eip&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Early Islamic period". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Despite brief Arab rule, Central Asia successfully retained much of its Iranian characteristic, remaining an important center of culture and trade for centuries after the adoption of the new religion. Mawarannahr continued to be an important political player in regional affairs, as it had been under various Persian dynasties. In fact, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], which ruled the Arab world for five centuries beginning in 750, was established thanks in great part to assistance from Central Asian supporters in their struggle against the then-ruling [[Umayyad Caliphate]].&lt;ref name=eip/&gt;

During the height of the Abbasid Caliphate in the 8th and 9th centuries, Central Asia and Mawarannahr experienced a truly golden age. Bukhoro became one of the leading centers of learning, culture, and art in the Muslim world, its magnificence rivaling contemporaneous cultural centers such as [[Baghdad]], [[Cairo]], and [[Córdoba, Spain|Cordoba]]. Some of the greatest historians, scientists, and geographers in the history of Islamic culture were natives of the region.&lt;ref name=eip/&gt;

As the Abbasid Caliphate began to weaken and local Islamic Iranian states emerged as the rulers of Iran and Central Asia, the [[Persian language]] continued its preeminent role in the region as the language of literature and government. The rulers of the eastern section of Iran and of Mawarannahr were Persians. Under the [[Samanids]] and the [[Buyids]], the rich Perso-Islamic culture of Mawarannahr continued to flourish.&lt;ref name=eip/&gt;

===Samanid Empire===
The Samanids were a Persian state that reigned for 180 years, encompassing a vast territoriy stretching from Central Asia to West Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Tabaḳāt-i-nāsiri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.31, By Minhāj Sirāj Jūzjānī&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The historical, social and economic setting By M. S. Asimov, pg.79&lt;/ref&gt; The Samanids were descendants of [[Bahram Chobin]],&lt;ref name="America pg. 123"&gt;Iran and America: Re-Kind[l]ing a Love Lost By Badi Badiozamani, Ghazal Badiozamani, pg. 123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lineage of Samanids pg.79"&gt;History of Bukhara by Narshakhi, Chapter XXIV, Pg 79&lt;/ref&gt; and thus descended from the [[House of Mihran|House of Mihrān]], one of the [[Seven Great Houses of Iran]]. In governing their territory, the Samanids modeled their state organization after the [[Abbasids]], mirroring the [[caliph]]'s court and organization.&lt;ref&gt;The Monumental Inscriptions from Early Islamic Iran and Transoxiana By Sheila S. Blair, pg. 27&lt;/ref&gt; They were rewarded for supporting the [[Abbasids]] in [[Transoxania]] and [[greater Khorasan|Khorasan]], and with their established capitals located in [[Bukhara]], [[Balkh]], [[Samarkand]], and [[Herat]], they carved their kingdom after defeating the [[Saffarids]].&lt;ref name="America pg. 123"/&gt;

The Samanid Empire was the first native Persian dynasty to arise after the Muslim Arab conquest. The four grandsons of the dynasty's founder, [[Saman Khuda]], had been rewarded with provinces for their faithful service to the Abbasid caliph [[al-Mamun]]: Nuh obtained [[Samarkand]]; Ahmad, [[Fergana]]; Yahya, Shash; and Elyas, [[Herat]]. Ahmad's son Nasr became governor of [[Transoxania]] in 875, but it was his brother and successor, [[Ismail Samani]] who overthrew the Saffarids and the Zaydites of Tabaristan, thus establishing a semiautonomous rule over Transoxania and Khorasan, with Bukhara as his capital.

====Samanids defeat the Saffarids and Zaydids====
Samanid rule in [[Bukhara]] was not formally recognized by the caliph until the early 10th century when the Saffarid ruler [[Amr-i Laith Saffari|'Amr-i Laith]] had asked the caliph for the investiture of Transoxiana. The caliph, [[Al-Mu'tadid]] however sent the Samanid amir, [[Ismail Samani]], a letter urging him to fight Amr-i Laith and the Saffarids whom the caliph considered usurpers. According to the letter, the caliph stated that he prayed for Ismail who the caliph considered as the rightful ruler of [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].&lt;ref&gt;The book of government, or, Rules for kings: the Siyar al-Muluk, or, Siyasat-nama of Nizam al-Mulk, Niẓām al-Mulk, Hubert Darke, pg.18–19&lt;/ref&gt; The letter had a profound effect on Ismail, as he was determined to oppose the Saffarids.

The two sides fought in [[Balkh]], northern [[Afghanistan]] during the spring of 900. During battle, Ismail was significantly outnumbered as he came out with 20,000 horsemen against Amr's 70,000 strong cavalry.&lt;ref&gt;History of Islam (Vol 3) By Akbar Shah Najeebabadi, pg. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Ismail's horsemen were ill-equipped with most having wooden stirrups while some had no shields or lances. Amr-i Laith's cavalry on the other hand, were fully equipped with weapons and armor. Despite fierce fighting, Amr was captured as some of his troops switched sides and joined Ismail.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Khallikan's biographical dictionary By Ibn Khallikān, pg.329&lt;/ref&gt;

Isma'il thereafter sent an army to Tabaristan in accordance with the caliph's directive.&lt;ref&gt;Tabaḳāt-i-nāsiri: a general history of the Muhammadan dynastics of Asia, pg.32, By Minhāj Sirāj Jūzjānī&lt;/ref&gt; The area at that time was then controlled by the [[Zaydid]]s. The Samanid army defeated the [[Zaydid]] ruler and the Samanids gained control of the region.

===Turkification of Transoxiana===
[[File:Costumes of Uzbek men.jpg|thumb|upright|Clothing of Uzbek men, [[Khiva]]]]
In the 9th century, the continued influx of nomads from the northern steppes brought a new group of people into Central Asia. These people were the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] who lived in the great grasslands stretching from [[Mongolia]] to the [[Caspian Sea]]. Introduced mainly as slave soldiers to the Samanid Dynasty, these Turks served in the armies of all the states of the region, including the Abbasid army. In the late 10th century, as the Samanids began to lose control of [[Transoxiana]] (Mawarannahr) and northeastern Iran, some of these soldiers came to positions of power in the government of the region, and eventually established their own states, albeit highly [[Persianate society|Persianized]]. With the emergence of a Turkic ruling group in the region, other Turkic tribes began to migrate to Transoxiana.&lt;ref name=tm&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Turkification of Mawarannahr". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of the Turkic states in the region was the Persianate [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid Empire]], established in the last years of the 10th century. The Ghaznavid state, which captured Samanid domains south of the [[Amu Darya]], was able to conquer large areas of Iran, [[Afghanistan]], and northern [[India]] apart from Central Asia, during the reign of [[Mahmud of Ghazna|Sultan Mahmud]]. The Ghaznavids were closely followed by the Turkic [[Qarakhanids]], who took the Samanid capital Bukhara in 999 AD, and ruled Transoxiana for the next two centuries. Samarkand was made the capital of the Western Qarakhanid state.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;

The dominance of Ghazna was curtailed, however, when the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] led themselves into the western part of the region, conquering the Ghaznavid territory of [[Khorazm]] (also spelled Khorezm and Khwarazm).&lt;ref name=tm/&gt; The Seljuks also defeated the Qarakhanids, but did not annex their territories outright. Instead they made the Qarakhanids a vassal state.&lt;ref name="sinor"&gt;{{citation|last = Golden|first = Peter. B.|contribution = The Karakhanids and Early Islam|year = 1990|title = The Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia|editor-last = Sinor|editor-first = Denis|publisher = Cambridge University Press|isbn = 0-521-24304-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuks]] dominated a wide area from [[Asia Minor]] to the western sections of Transoxiana in the 11th century. The Seljuk Empire then split into states ruled by various local Turkic and Iranian rulers. The culture and intellectual life of the region continued unaffected by such political changes, however. Turkic tribes from the north continued to migrate into the region during this period.&lt;ref name=tm/&gt; The power of the Seljuks however became diminished when the Seljuk Sultan [[Ahmed Sanjar]] was defeated by the [[Kara-Khitans]] at the [[Battle of Qatwan]] in 1141.

In the late 12th century, a Turkic leader of Khorazm, which is the region south of the Aral Sea, united Khorazm, Transoxiana, and Iran under his rule. Under the rule of the Khorazm [[shah]] [[Kutbeddin Muhammad]] and his son, [[Muhammad II of Khwarazm|Muhammad II]], Transoxiana continued to be prosperous and rich while maintaining the region's Perso-Islamic identity. However, a new incursion of nomads from the north soon changed this situation. This time the invader was [[Genghis Khan]] with his [[Mongol]] armies.&lt;ref name=tm/&gt;

===Mongol period===
The Mongol invasion of Central Asia is one of the turning points in the history of the region. The Mongols had such a lasting impact because they established the tradition that the legitimate ruler of any Central Asian state could only be a blood descendant of Genghis Khan.&lt;ref name=mp&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Mongol period". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mongol invasion of Central Asia|Mongol conquest of Central Asia]], which took place from 1219 to 1225, led to a wholesale change in the population of Mawarannahr. The conquest quickened the process of Turkification in some parts of the region because, although the armies of Genghis Khan were led by Mongols, they were made up mostly of Turkic tribes that had been incorporated into the Mongol armies as the tribes were encountered in the Mongols' southward sweep. As these armies settled in Mawarannahr, they intermixed with the local populations which did not flee. Another effect of the Mongol conquest was the large-scale damage the soldiers inflicted on cities such as Bukhoro and on regions such as Khorazm. As the leading province of a wealthy state, Khorazm was treated especially severely. The [[irrigation]] networks in the region suffered extensive damage that was not repaired for several generations.&lt;ref name=mp/&gt; Many Iranian-speaking populations were forced to flee southwards in order to avoid persecution.

===Rule of Mongols and Timurids===
[[File:Teymur.jpg|thumb|upright|Timur feasts in [[Samarkand]]]]

Following the death of Genghis Khan in 1227, his empire was divided among his four sons and his family members. Despite the potential for serious fragmentation, [[Yassa|Mongol law]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] maintained orderly succession for several more generations, and control of most of Mawarannahr stayed in the hands of direct descendants of [[Chagatai Khan|Chaghatai]], the second son of Genghis. Orderly succession, prosperity, and internal peace prevailed in the Chaghatai lands, and the Mongol Empire as a whole remained strong and united.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Rule of Timur". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the early 14th century, however, as the empire began to break up into its constituent parts, the Chaghatai territory also was disrupted as the princes of various tribal groups competed for influence. One tribal chieftain, [[Timur]] (Tamerlane), emerged from these struggles in the 1380s as the dominant force in Mawarannahr. Although he was not a descendant of Genghis, Timur became the de facto ruler of Mawarannahr and proceeded to conquer all of western Central Asia, Iran, the [[Caucasus]], Asia Minor, and the southern steppe region north of the [[Aral Sea]]. He also invaded Russia before dying during an invasion of China in 1405.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;

Timur initiated the last flowering of Mawarannahr by gathering in his capital, Samarqand, numerous artisans and scholars from the lands he had conquered. By supporting such people, Timur imbued his empire with a very rich Perso-Islamic culture. During Timur's reign and the reigns of his immediate descendants, a wide range of religious and palatial construction projects were undertaken in Samarqand and other population centers. Timur also patronized scientists and artists; his grandson [[Ulugh Beg]] was one of the world's first great astronomers. It was during the Timurid dynasty that Turkic, in the form of the [[Chaghatai dialect]], became a [[literary language]] in its own right in Mawarannahr, although the Timurids were Persianate in nature. The greatest Chaghataid writer, [[Ali Shir Nava'i]], was active in the city of [[Herat]], now in northwestern Afghanistan, in the second half of the 15th century.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt;

The Timurid state quickly broke into two halves after the death of Timur. The chronic internal fighting of the Timurids attracted the attention of the [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] nomadic tribes living to the north of the Aral Sea. In 1501 the Uzbeks began a wholesale invasion of Mawarannahr.&lt;ref name=rt/&gt; Under the leadership of [[Muhammad Shaybani]], the Uzbeks conquered the key cities of [[Samarkand]] and [[Herat]] in 1505 and 1507, respectively, and founded the [[Khanate of Bukhara]].

===Uzbek period===
[[File:Mirza Abdulhuq and Rustom Beg in 1841.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[lithography|lithograph]] of two Uzbek [[Khan (title)|Khans]] from [[Afghanistan]] in 1841.]]
By 1510 the Uzbeks had completed their conquest of Central Asia{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}, including the territory of the present-day Uzbekistan. Of the states they established, the most powerful, the [[Khanate of Bukhoro]], centered on the city of Bukhoro. The khanate controlled Mawarannahr, especially the region of [[Tashkent]], the [[Fergana Valley]] in the east, and northern Afghanistan. A second Uzbek state, the [[Khanate of Khiva]] was established in the oasis of [[Khorazm]] at the mouth of the Amu Darya. The Khanate of Bukhoro was initially led by the energetic [[Shaybanid Dynasty]], the successors of [[Muhammad Shaybani]]. The Shaybanids initially competed against Iran for a few years, which was led by the [[Safavid Dynasty]], for the rich far-eastern territory of present-day Iran.&lt;ref name="Eraly2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Abraham Eraly|title=Emperors Of The Peacock Throne: The Saga of the Great Moghuls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h7kPQs8llvkC&amp;pg=PT25|date=17 September 2007|publisher=Penguin Books Limited|isbn=978-93-5118-093-7|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle with the Safavids also had a religious aspect because the Uzbeks were [[Sunni]] Muslims, and Iran was [[Shia]].&lt;ref name=up&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Uzbek period". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Near the end of the 16th century, the Uzbek states{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} of Bukhoro and Khorazm began to weaken because of their endless wars against each other and the Persians and because of strong competition for the throne among the khans in power and their heirs. At the beginning of the 17th century, the Shaybanid Dynasty was replaced by the [[Janid Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

Another factor contributing to the weakness of the Uzbek khanates in this period was the general decline of trade moving through the region. This change had begun in the previous century when ocean trade routes were established from Europe to India and China, circumventing the Silk Route. As European-dominated ocean transport expanded and some trading centers were destroyed, cities such as Bukhoro, [[Merv]], and Samarqand in the Khanate of Bukhoro and [[Khiva]] and [[Urganch]] (Urgench) in Khorazm began to steadily decline.&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

The Uzbeks' struggle with Iran also led to the cultural isolation of Central Asia from the rest of the Islamic world. In addition to these problems, the struggle with the nomads from the northern steppe continued. In the 17th and 18th centuries, [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads and Mongols continually raided the Uzbek khanates, causing widespread damage and disruption. In the beginning of the 18th century, the Khanate of Bukhoro lost the fertile Fergana region, and a [[Khanate of Kokand|new Uzbek khanate]] was formed in [[Quqon]].&lt;ref name=up/&gt;

===Russo-Soviet era===
[[File:Defence of the Samarkand Citadel.JPG|thumb|The Defence of the Samarkand Citadel in 1868. From the Russian Illustrated Magazine "Niva" (1872).]]

====[[Russian Empire]]====
In the 19th century, Russian interest in the area increased greatly, sparked by nominal concern over British designs on Central Asia; by anger over the situation of Russian citizens held as slaves; and by the desire to control the trade in the region and to establish a secure source of [[cotton]] for Russia. When the [[United States Civil War]] prevented cotton delivery from Russia's primary supplier, the southern United States, Central Asian cotton assumed much greater importance for Russia.&lt;ref name=rc&gt;Lubin, Nancy. "Russian conquest". In Curtis.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=January 2014}}

As soon as the Russian conquest of the [[Caucasus]] was completed in the late 1850s, the Russian [[Ministry of War (Russia)|Ministry of War]] began to send military forces against the Central Asian khanates. Three major population centers of the khanates—Tashkent, Bukhoro, and Samarqand—were captured in 1865, 1867, and 1868, respectively. In 1868 the Khanate of Bukhoro signed a treaty with Russia making Bukhoro a Russian [[protectorate]]. Khiva became a Russian protectorate in 1873, and the Quqon Khanate finally was incorporated into the Russian Empire, also as a protectorate, in 1876.&lt;ref name=rc/&gt;

By 1876, Russia had incorporated all three khanates (hence all of present-day Uzbekistan) into its empire, granting the khanates limited autonomy. In the second half of the 19th century, the Russian population of Uzbekistan grew and some industrialization occurred.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Uzbekistan.pdf "Country Profile: Uzbekistan"].

====Soviet Union====
{{further information|Amersfoort concentration camp|German mistreatment of Soviet prisoners of war|Islam in the Netherlands#The Second World War|Soviet Central Asia}}

In the 1940s, [[Nazi Germany]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded]] the [[Soviet Union]]. In response, many Central Asians, including Uzbeks or [[Samarqand]]ites, were sent to [[Battle of Smolensk (1941)|fight the Germans]] in the area of [[Smolensk]]. However, a number of them, including [[Hatam Kadirov]] and [[Zair Muratov]], were captured, transported to the [[Netherlands]], abused and killed. Their bodies were buried in [[Rusthof cemetery]] near [[Amersfoort]]. For some time, these 101 victims were not identified, apart from the fact that they were Soviets, until an investigation by journalist [[Remco Reiding]]. Their plight was also studied by Uzbek historian Bahodir Uzakov of [[Gouda, South Holland]]. Witness [[Henk Broekhuizen]] said that, despite having seeing them once as a teenager, he would recall the soldiers' faces, whenever he closed his eyes.&lt;ref name=Soldat&gt;[http://www.soldat.ru/search/f_glory/soldiers.html "Soviet Field of Glory"] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC2017CentralAsians"&gt;{{cite news |author=Rustam Qobil |publisher=BBC |title=Why were 101 Uzbeks killed in the Netherlands in 1942? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-39849088 |date=2017-05-09 |accessdate=2017-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moscow's control over Uzbekistan weakened in the 1970s as Uzbek party leader [[Sharaf Rashidov]] brought many cronies and relatives into positions of power. In the mid-1980s, Moscow attempted to regain control by again purging the entire Uzbek party leadership. However, this move increased [[Uzbek nationalism]], which had long resented Soviet policies such as the imposition of cotton monoculture and the suppression of [[Islam]]ic traditions. In the late 1980s, the liberalized atmosphere of the Soviet Union under Mikhail S. Gorbachev (in power 1985–91) fostered political opposition groups and open (albeit limited) opposition to Soviet policy in Uzbekistan. In 1989, a series of violent ethnic clashes, involving Uzbeks, brought the appointment of ethnic Uzbek outsider Islam Karimov as Communist Party chief.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Post-Soviet era===
When the Supreme Soviet of Uzbekistan reluctantly approved independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Karimov became president of the Republic of Uzbekistan.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; On August 31, 1991, Uzbekistan declared independence, marking September 1 as a national holiday.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Language ==
[[File:Adib-i sani.jpg|thumb|200 px|right|upright|A page in [[Uzbek language]] Arabic script printed in Tashkant 1911]]
{{Main article|Uzbek language}}
The [[Uzbek language]] is a [[Turkic language]] of the [[Karluk languages|Karluk]] group. Modern Uzbek is written in wide variety of scripts including [[Arabic]], [[Latin]], and [[Cyrillic]]. After the independence of Uzbekistan from the former [[Soviet Union]], the government decided to replace the Cyrillic script with a modified Latin alphabet, specifically for Turkic languages.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Islam in Uzbekistan}}
'''Uzbeks''' come from a predominantly [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslim]] background, usually of the [[Hanafi]] school,&lt;ref name=EofI&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title = Ozbek| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| edition = CD-ROM Edition v. 1.0| publisher = Koninklijke Brill NV| location = Leiden, The Netherlands| year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; but variations exist between northern and southern Uzbeks. According to a 2009 [[Pew Research Center]] report, Uzbekistan's population is 96.3% Muslim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pewforum.org/uploadedfiles/Topics/Demographics/Muslimpopulation.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of Uzbeks from the former [[USSR]] came to practice religion with a more liberal interpretation due to the movement of [[Jadidism]] which arose as an indigenous reform movement during the time of [[Tsarist Empire|Russian imperial rule]], while Uzbeks in Afghanistan and other countries to the south have remained more conservative adherents of Islam. However, with Uzbek independence in 1991 came an Islamic revival amongst segments of the population. People living in the area of modern Uzbekistan were first converted to [[Islam]] as early as the 8th century, as [[Arabs]] conquered the area, displacing the earlier faith of [[Manichaeism]].

==Migration history==
Large numbers of Vietnamese students began to choose Japan as a destination in the early 20th century, spurred by the exiled prince [[Cường Để]] and the [[Đông Du|Đông Du Movement]] (literally, "Travel East movement" or "Eastern Travel movement") he and [[Phan Bội Châu]] pioneered. By 1908, 200 Vietnamese students had gone to study at Japanese universities.&lt;ref name="Tran"&gt;{{citation|title=A Vietnamese Royal Exile in Japan: Prince Cường Để (1882-1951)|first=My-Van|last=Tran|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|pages=3–5, 41–47|isbn=0-415-29716-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chandler"&gt;{{citation|title=In Search of Southeast Asia: A Modern History|first=David P.|last=Chandler|first2=David Joel|last2=Steinberg|pages=315–316|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|year=1987|isbn=0-8248-1110-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the community of Vietnamese people in Japan is dominated by [[Vietnam War]] refugees and their families, who compose about 70% of the total population.&lt;ref name="Shingaki"/&gt; Japan began to accept refugees from Vietnam in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="Hosoya"&gt;{{citation|url=http://opac.kanto-gakuin.ac.jp/cgi-bin/retrieve/sr_bookview.cgi/U_CHARSET.utf-8/NI10000682/Body/link/11hosoya.pdf|title=A Case Study of Indochinese Refugees in Japan: Their experiences at school and occupations|last=Hosoya|first=Sari|pages=210–228|journal=Keizai Keiei Kenkyūsho Nenbō|volume=28|access-date=2008-01-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409124735/http://opac.kanto-gakuin.ac.jp/cgi-bin/retrieve/sr_bookview.cgi/U_CHARSET.utf-8/NI10000682/Body/link/11hosoya.pdf|archive-date=2008-04-09|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy of accepting foreign migrants marked a significant break from Japan's post-[[World War II]] orientation towards promoting and maintaining a myth of a racially homogeneous Japan. Most of these migrants settled in [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] and [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]] prefectures, the locations of the initial resettlement centres. As they moved out of the resettlement centres, they often gravitated to [[Koreans in Japan|Zainichi Korean]]-dominated neighbourhoods; however, they feel little sense of community with Zainichi Koreans, seeing them not as fellow ethnic minorities but as part of the mainstream.&lt;ref name="Shingaki"/&gt;

[[Guest worker]]s began to follow the refugees to Japan in the so-called "third wave" of Vietnamese migration beginning in the 1990s. As contract workers returned home to Vietnam from the countries of the former [[Eastern Bloc]], which by then had begun their transition away from Communism, they began to look for other foreign destinations in which they could earn good incomes, and Japan proved attractive due to its nearby location and high standard of living. By the end of 1994, the annual number of Vietnamese workers going to Japan totalled 14,305 individuals, mostly under industrial traineeship visas. In contrast to other labour-exporting countries in [[Southeast Asia]], the vast majority of migrants were men, due to the Vietnamese government's restrictions on migration for work in traditionally female-dominated fields such as [[domestic helper|domestic work]] or entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|chapter=Labour Emigration and Emigration Pressures in Transitional Vietnam|last=Anh|first=Dang Nguyen|title=Migration in the Asia Pacific: Population, Settlement and Citizenship Issues|editor-first=Robyn R.|editor-last=Iredale|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2003|pages=169–180|isbn=1-84064-860-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integration==
The refugees have suffered various difficulties adjusting to Japanese society, especially in the areas of education and employment; their attendance rate in senior high school is estimated to be only 40%, as compared to 96.6% for Japanese nationals, a fact attributed both to the refugees' lack of [[Japanese language]] proficiency as well as the schools' own inability to adjust to the challenges of educating students with different cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Hosoya"/&gt; Tensions have also arisen between migrants admitted to Japan as adults, and [[Immigrant generations|1.5 or 2nd-generation]] children born or educated in Japan, due to language barriers and differences in culture; the former feel the latter are too reserved and distant, while the latter deride the former for their poor Japanese language skills&lt;!--'and '... - what?--&gt;. Most Vietnamese do not take on [[Japanese name]]s, or prefer to use their [[Vietnamese name]]s even if they have a Japanese name, though they feel a Japanese name may be necessary for job-seeking and they sometimes complain of being teased for having "[[katakana]] names".  [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic churches]] quickly came to play an important role in their community.&lt;ref name="Shingaki"/&gt;

'''Westley Allan Dodd''' (July 3, 1961 &amp;ndash; January 5, 1993) was an American [[serial killer]] and convicted [[sex offender]]. His [[capital punishment|execution]] (which was performed at his own request) on January 5, 1993, was the first legal [[hanging]] in the United States since 1965.

== Early life ==
Westley Allan Dodd was born in [[Toppenish, Washington]], on July 3, 1961, the oldest of Jim and Carol Dodd's three children.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite web |  first = Timothy | last = Egan |url = https://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/us/illusions-are-also-left-dead-as-child-killer-awaits-noose.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm |title = Illusions Are Also Left Dead As Child-Killer Awaits Noose | work = [[The New York Times]] | publisher = New York Times Company| location= New York City| date = December 29, 1992 | dead-url=no|archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/66kir6sDh?url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/12/29/us/illusions-are-also-left-dead-as-child-killer-awaits-noose.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | archivedate = April 7, 2012 | accessdate = April 7, 2012 | df = }}

== Criminal history ==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
{{overly detailed|date=January 2015}}

===Sex offenses===
At the age of 13, Dodd began exposing himself to children in his neighborhood. His father eventually told an Oregon newspaper that he was aware of the boy's behavior, but largely chose to look the other way, especially since he was otherwise "a well-behaved child who never had problems with drugs, drinking, or smoking". By the time he entered high school, Dodd had progressed to molestation, beginning with his younger cousins, and then neighborhood kids he offered to babysit and the children of a woman his father was dating. At the age of 15, Dodd was arrested for indecent exposure, but police let him go with a recommendation of juvenile counseling.

In August 1981, Dodd tried to abduct two little girls, but they reported him to the police. No action was taken. The following month, he enlisted in the Navy, and was assigned to a submarine base in [[Bangor, Washington]], where he started abusing children who lived on the base. Once, Dodd offered some boys $50 to come with him to a motel room for a game of strip poker. This time, he was arrested. Despite confessing to police that he planned to molest the boys, he was released, with no charges filed. Shortly afterwards, he was arrested again for exposing himself to a boy and discharged from the Navy. Dodd spent 19 days in jail and underwent court-ordered counseling. In May 1984, he was arrested for molesting a 10-year-old boy, but received only a suspended sentence.

Dodd planned his entire life around easy access to "targets", as he referred to children. He moved into an apartment block that housed families with children, and worked at fast food restaurants, as a charity truck driver, and other such jobs. He repeatedly molested the pre-school-aged children of a neighbor, but the woman feared that pressing charges would be too traumatic for the boys.

In 1987, Dodd tried to lure a young boy into a vacant building, but the boy refused to go with him and instead told police. Once again, Dodd received minimal punishment because he had not actually touched the boy or exposed himself. Prosecutors were aware of his history of sexual offenses, and recommended five years in prison, but he only spent 118 days in jail and probation. After getting out of jail, he moved to [[Vancouver, Washington]], and got a job as a shipping clerk.

In the early autumn of 1989, Dodd decided that David Douglas Park in Vancouver was a good place to find potential victims.&lt;ref name="seattletimes" /&gt; He was arrested several times over the next few years for child molestation, each time serving short jail sentences and being given court-mandated therapy.&lt;ref name="seattletimes" /&gt; All his victims (over 50 in all) were below the age of 12, some of them as young as two. Most of them were boys.

Dodd's [[sexual fantasy|sexual fantasies]] became increasingly violent over the years; he wrote about wanting to [[cannibalize]] the [[genitals]] of his victims and perform "experimental surgeries" to turn them into obedient [[zombie]]s. A psychiatrist who evaluated Dodd following one of his convictions said that he fit the legal criteria for a "sexual [[psychopath]]".&lt;ref name="seattletimes" /&gt;

===Murders===
On September 4, 1989, Dodd lured two brothers, 11- and 10-year-old Cole and William Neer, to a secluded area, where he forced them to undress, tied them to a tree and performed sex acts on them both. When he was done, he stabbed them repeatedly with a knife and fled the scene. The boys were soon discovered in the park. Cole was dead at the scene, while William died en route to the hospital.

Soon afterward, Dodd moved to [[Portland, Oregon]], where he made several unsuccessful attempts at luring children. On October 29, Dodd encountered four-year-old Lee Iseli and his nine-year-old brother Justin at a local park. The former was playing alone on a slide, and Dodd succeeded in convincing the boy to come with him. Justin had gone home, so Dodd told Lee that he "would drive him back to his house". He managed to bring Lee to his apartment in Vancouver apparently unnoticed, and he ordered the boy to undress. Dodd then tied Lee to his bed and molested him, taking photographs of the abuse. Dodd kept Lee overnight while he continued to molest him, all the while jotting down every detail in his diary. The next morning, he strangled Lee to death with a rope and hung his body in the closet, photographing it as a macabre "trophy". He would later confess to police that he had not originally planned to kill the boy, but eventually decided that it was necessary to keep him from telling anyone. Dodd stuffed Lee's nude body in trash bags and threw it in some bushes near Vancouver Lake. He burned Lee's clothing in a trash barrel except for the boy's underwear, which he kept as a souvenir of the crime. Three days later, Lee's body was discovered, which sparked a manhunt for the killer. Dodd kept a low profile and mostly stayed in his apartment, writing down future plans for child abduction and also constructing a homemade torture rack for the next victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Martin Gilman|last=Wolcott|title=The Evil 100|publisher=[[Citadel Press]]|location=New York City|page=282|date=2004|ISBN=978-0806525556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On November 13, Dodd snatched a 6-year-old boy from the bathroom of the New Liberty Theater in [[Camas, Washington]], but the child began fighting and crying as Dodd was leaving the theater through the lobby carrying the boy in his arms. Despite Dodd's attempts to calm the boy, theater employees became suspicious. Once outside, Dodd released his victim before getting into his car and driving away. The boy's mother's boyfriend came out to the theater lobby and was told that the boy was almost abducted. The boyfriend went outside the theater in the direction where Dodd was last seen. Dodd's car broke down a short distance away from the theater. In order not to raise Dodd's suspicion and to stall for time, the boyfriend offered to help him. The boyfriend immediately got Dodd into a headlock and brought him back to the theater where the Camas police were called. Camas police contacted the task force investigating the kidnapping and murder of Lee Iseli. Dodd was brought to the Camas PD Headquarters, where task force lead detectives CW Jensen and Dave Trimble interviewed him over the course of three days. Eventually, Dodd confessed to all three murders. Jensen and Trimble then served the [[search warrant]] at a home in Vancouver where Dodd rented a room.

During the search of Dodd's room, police discovered a homemade torture rack, along with newspaper clippings about his crimes, a briefcase containing Lee Iseli's underwear, a photo album containing pictures of Lee Iseli, and assorted photographs of children in underwear advertisements. They also discovered Dodd's diary, in which he detailed the murders.

Dodd was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of the Neer brothers and Lee Iseli, plus attempted kidnapping of another child. He initially pleaded not guilty to all charges, but later changed his plea to guilty.

==Trial==
During his trial in Clark County Superior Court, the prosecution read aloud excerpts of Dodd's diary, and displayed the photographs of Lee Iseli. The defense did not call any witnesses, or present any evidence, suggesting only that Dodd must be legally insane. Prosecutors requested the death penalty, and the jury agreed. Dodd would claim that speaking in his own defense was pointless, and ultimately, "the system had failed repeatedly". He stated that he would like to die by hanging, and that he was willing to die if "it brought peace to the victims' families".

Dodd was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] in 1990 for stabbing the Neer brothers to death, as well as for the separate rape and murder of Lee Iseli.

==Execution==
Less than four years elapsed between the murders and Dodd's execution. He refused to [[appeal]] his case or the capital sentence. He insisted that he was uncontrollable and would kill again, stating in one court brief: "I must be executed before I have an opportunity to escape or kill someone else. If I do escape, I promise you I will kill and rape again, and I will enjoy every minute of it."&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt; He also said in some interviews that death would give him relief from guilt over the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Kroll|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-01-07/news/9303151248_1_westley-allan-dodd-walla-walla-state-penitentiary-pamphlet|title=Interview With A Monster|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=January 7, 1993|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial, he wrote a pamphlet on how parents could protect children from child molesters such as himself. {{Citation needed|date=September 2018}} 

By Washington state law, Dodd had to choose one of two methods for his execution: [[lethal injection]], or hanging. He chose hanging, later stating in interviews that he chose that method "because that's the way Lee Iseli [his final victim] died". His hanging was the first use of that method for an execution in the United States since [[George York and James Latham]] were hanged by Kansas in 1965. His execution was witnessed by 12 members of local and regional media,&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press Bulletin, Jan 4 1993, 23:26&lt;/ref&gt; prison officials, and representatives of the families of the three victims. He ate salmon and potatoes for his [[last meal]]. His last words, spoken from the second floor of the indoor gallows, were recorded by the media witnesses as:

Look to the Lord, and you will find peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1993/01-05/280183_killer__39_s_final_words____39_.html|title=Killer's Final Words: 'There Is Peace'|newspaper=[[Kitsap Sun]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Bremerton, Washington|date=January 5, 1993|accessdate=July 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Dodd was executed by hanging at 12:05&amp;nbsp;a.m. on January 5, 1993 at [[Washington State Penitentiary]] in [[Walla Walla, Washington|Walla Walla]]. He was pronounced dead by the prison doctor and his body transported to [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] for [[autopsy]]. The King County Medical Examiner, Donald Reay, found that Dodd had died quickly and probably with little pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Dodd strangled, autopsy finds | work = The Bulletin | publisher = The (Bend, Oregon) Bulletin | date = January 7, 1993 | url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=D5ZTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=I4cDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3219%2C6181081 | accessdate = April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[cremation|cremated]] following the autopsy, and his ashes turned over to his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Gary|last=King|title=Driven To Kill|date=2011|ISBN=978-1452454504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Dodd's crimes are included in the [[Netflix]] series ''[[Real Detective]]''. In the episode titled "Malice" detective [[C. W. Jensen]] describes his involvement in bringing Dodd to justice and the effect it had on him personally.

Dodd was the basis for an [[unseen character]], a child killer named "Wayne Dobbs", in the 2002 film ''[[Insomnia (2002 film)|Insomnia]]'', starring [[Al Pacino]]. He was fictionalized as a man who murdered a young boy in a way similar to Dodd's murder of Lee Iseli. Dodd was also mentioned in [[Michael Connelly]]'s novel ''[[The Concrete Blonde]]''.

Several books have been written about the case, including: ''When The Monster Comes Out Of The Closet'' by Lori Steinhorst, who communicated with Dodd in writing and by phone almost daily for 18 months prior to his execution; ''Driven to Kill'' by [[true crime]] author Gary C. King;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =Driven to Kill| work =The True Crime Website of Author Gary C.

'''Women in [[Seychelles]]''' enjoy the same legal, political, economic, and social rights as men.&lt;ref name=cs&gt;Tartter, Jean R. "Status of Women". [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/sctoc.html Indian Ocean country studies: Seychelles] (Helen Chapin Metz, editor). [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 1994). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family life ==
Seychellois society is essentially [[matriarchal]].&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Mothers tend to be dominant in the household, controlling most current expenditures and looking after the interests of the children.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; [[Unwed mother]]s are the societal norm, and the law requires fathers to [[child support|support their children]].&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Men are important for their earning ability, but their domestic role is relatively peripheral.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; Older women can usually count on financial support from family members living at home or contributions from the earnings of grown children.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt;

===  Violence against women ===
Domestic [[violence against women]] was a continuing problem.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Police rarely intervened in domestic disputes unless it involved a weapon or major assault.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; The authorities often dismissed the few cases that reached a prosecutor, or the court gave the perpetrator a light sentence.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; There was growing societal concern about domestic violence and increased recognition of the need to address it.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

[[Rape]], [[Marital rape|spousal rape]], and [[domestic abuse]] are criminal offences punishable by a maximum of 20 years' imprisonment.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; During 2007, the [[Family Tribunal]] registered 74 domestic violence complaints.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; The police registered 56 rape cases and four cases of attempted sexual assault.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; The Social Affairs Division of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Development (Seychelles)|Ministry of Health and Social Development]] and [[Women in Action and Solidarity Organization]], a local NGO, provided counseling services to rape victims.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

== Wider society ==
[[File:Miss Seychelles 08 Elena Angione.jpg|thumb|left|Miss Seychelles 2008, Elene Angine]]
There is no officially sanctioned [[gender discrimination]] in employment and women are well represented in business.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; As of 1994, women formed nearly half of the enrollment at the prestigious [[Seychelles Polytechnic]], the highest level of education on the islands.&lt;ref name=cs/&gt; As of 2007, there were 10 women in the 34-seat [[National Assembly of Seychelles|National Assembly]], seven elected by direct election and three by [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref name=hr&gt;[https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2007/100502.htm Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: Seychelles (2007)] [[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] (March 11, 2008). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; Following the July 2007 cabinet reshuffle, there were two women in the cabinet.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

[[Prostitution]] is illegal but remains prevalent.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; Police generally do not apprehend prostitutes unless their actions involved other crimes.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

The law prohibits [[sexual harassment]] but is rarely enforced.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt; [[Inheritance law]]s do not discriminate against women.&lt;ref name=hr/&gt;

'''''Yesenia''''' is a 1971 Mexican film directed by [[Alfredo B. Crevenna]] based on an original story by [[Yolanda Vargas Dulché]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Una gitana para tres actrices y un capitán para dos actores|url=http://www.eltelegrafo.com.ec/noticias/espectaculos/22/una-gitana-para-tres-actrices-y-un-capitan-para-dos-actores|website=eltelegrafo.com.ec|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is starred [[Jacqueline Andere]] as the titular character, along to [[Jorge Lavat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline Andere será homenajeada en China por Yesenia|url=http://www.lametiche.com/noticia/jacqueline-andere-sera-homenajeada-en-china-por-yesenia/|website=lametiche.com|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
