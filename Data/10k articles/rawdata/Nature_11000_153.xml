[[File:MotionIntegralsDerivativesAbsementActergy.svg|400px|thumb|Integrals and derivatives of displacement, including absement, as well as integrals and derivatives of energy, including actergy. (Janzen etal 2014)]]

In [[kinematics]], '''absement''' (or '''absition''') is a measure of sustained [[displacement (vector)|displacement]] of an object from its initial [[position (vector)|position]], i.e. a measure of how far away and for how long. Absement changes as an object remains displaced and stays constant as the object resides at the initial position. It is the first time-[[integral]] of the displacement&lt;ref name=PWTMG&gt;Jin-Song Pei, Joseph P. Wright, Michael D. Todd, Sami F. Masri, François Gay-Balmaz (2015). [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11071-014-1882-3 Understanding memristors and memcapacitors in engineering mechanics applications]. Springer. Abstract: "for example, a new concept and state variable called “absement,” the time integral of deformation, emerge."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Jeltsema&gt;Dimitri Jeltsema (2012). [https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1032 Memory Elements: A Paradigm Shift in Lagrangian Modeling of Electrical Circuits].  	arXiv:1201.1032. Abstract: "Although time-integrated charge is a somewhat unusual quantity in circuit theory, it may be considered as the electrical analogue of a mechanical quantity called absement."&lt;/ref&gt; (the area under a displacement vs. time graph), so the displacement is the rate of change (first time-[[derivative]]) of the absement. The [[dimensional analysis|dimension]] of absement is [[length]] multiplied by [[time in physics|time]]. Its [[SI unit]] is '''meter second''' (m·s), which corresponds to an object having been displaced by 1&amp;nbsp;[[meter]] for 1&amp;nbsp;[[second]]. This is not to be confused with a [[meter per second]] (m/s), a unit of [[velocity]], the time-derivative of position.

For example, opening the gate of a gate valve (of rectangular cross section) by 1&amp;nbsp;mm for 10&amp;nbsp;seconds yields the same absement of 10&amp;nbsp;mm·s as opening it by 5&amp;nbsp;mm for 2&amp;nbsp;seconds. The amount of water having flowed through it is linearly proportional to the absement of the gate, so it is also the same in both cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maya Burhanpurkar]]. ''Absement: Direct Evidence of the Time-Integral of Distance''. Canada-Wide Science Fair 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''absement'' is a [[portmanteau]] of the words ''absence'' and ''displacement''. Similarly, ''absition'' is a portmanteau of the words ''absence'' and ''position''.&lt;ref name=mann2006&gt;"[http://wearcam.org/acmmm2006/ Absement, displacement, and velocity-sensitive music keyboard in which each key is a water jet]", by Mann, Janzen, and Post, In Proceedings of the 14th annual ACM international conference on Multimedia, pp. 519-528. ACM, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespectrumofriemannium.com/2012/11/10/log053-derivatives-of-position/|title=LOG#053. Derivatives of position|date=2012-11-10|website=The Spectrum Of Riemannium|access-date=2016-03-08|author=Amarashiki}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence in nature==
Whenever the rate of change {{var|f}}′ of a quantity {{var|f}} is proportional to the displacement of an object, the quantity {{var|f}} is a linear function of the object's absement. For example, when the fuel [[volumetric flow rate|flow rate]] is proportional to the position of the throttle lever, then the total amount of fuel consumed is proportional to the lever's absement.

The first published paper on the topic of absement introduced and motivated it as a way to study 
flow-based musical instruments, such as the [[hydraulophone]], to model empirical observations of some hydraulophones in which obstruction of a water jet for a longer period of time resulted in a buildup in [[Loudness|sound level]], as [[water]] accumulates in a [[sounding mechanism]] (reservoir), up to a certain maximum filling point beyond which the sound level reached a maximum, or fell off (along with a slow decay when a water jet was unblocked)&lt;ref name=mann2006/&gt;.  Absement has also been used to model artificial muscles&lt;ref&gt;ROBUST CONTROL LAW FOR PNEUMATIC ARTIFICIAL MUSCLES, Jonathon E. Slightam and Mark L. Nagurka, Proceedings of the ASME/Bath 2017 Symposium on Fluid Power and Motion Control, FPMC 2017, October 16-19, 2017, Sarasota, USA&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as for real muscle interaction in a physical fitness context&lt;ref&gt;Effectiveness of Integral Kinesiology Feedback
for Fitness-based Games, Steve Mann, Max Lv Hao, Ming-Chang Tsai, Maziar Hafezi, Amin Azad, and Farhad Keramatimoezabad, 2018 IEEE Games, Entertainment, Media Conference (GEM), pages 43-50&lt;/ref&gt;.  Absement has also been used to model human posture&lt;ref&gt;Postural strategy for mediolateral weight shifting in healthy adult, J Tousignant, C Cherriere, A Pouliot-Laforte, É Auvinet, Gait &amp; Posture, 2018 - Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;.

As the displacement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of [[electric charge]], the absement can be seen as a mechanical analogue of the time-integrated charge, a quantity useful for modelling some types of memory elements.&lt;ref name=Jeltsema/&gt;

==Applications==
In addition to modeling fluid flow and for lagrangian modeling of electric circuits (Jeltsema 2012), absement is used in physical fitness and kinesiology to model muscle bandwidth, and as a new form of physical fitness training.&lt;ref&gt;"Actergy as a Reflex Performance Metric: Integral-Kinematics Applications", Janzen etal., in Proceedings of the IEEE GEM 2014, pp. 311-2. DOI: 10.1109/GEM.2014.7048123&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Integral Kinematics (Time-Integrals of Distance, Energy, etc.) and Integral Kinesiology", by Mann etal, in Proceedings of the IEEE GEM 2014, pp. 270-2.&lt;/ref&gt;  In this context, it gives rise to a new quantity called ''actergy'', which is to energy as energy is to power.  Actergy has the same units as action (joule-seconds) but is the time-integral of total energy (time-integral of the Hamiltonian rather than time-integral of the Lagrangian).

Fluid flow in a throttle:
{{quote|A vehicle's distance travelled results from its throttle's absement. The further the throttle has been opened, and the longer it's been open, the more the vehicle's travelled.|&lt;ref&gt;"What does the area under a distance-time graph correspond to?" Quora, 23 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Relation to PID controllers==
[[PID controller]]s are controllers that work on a signal that is proportional to a physical quantity (e.g. displacement, proportional to position) and its integral(s) and derivative(s), thusly defining PID in the context of Integrals and Derivatives of a position of a control element in the Bratland sense&lt;ref&gt;Bratland, Magne, Bjørn Haugen, and Terje Rølvåg. "Modal analysis of active flexible multibody systems containing PID controllers with non-collocated sensors and actuators." Finite Elements in Analysis and Design 91 (2014): 16-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|depending on the type of sensor inputs, PID controllers can contain gains proportional to position, velocity, acceleration or the time integral of position (absement)…||Bratland et al.}}

Example of PID controller (Bratland 2014):
* P, Position;
* I, Absement;
* D, Velocity.

==Higher integrals==
Just as displacement and its derivatives form kinematics, also displacement and its integrals form "integral kinematics" (Janzen ''et al.'' 2014), giving rise to the ordered list of ''n''-th derivatives of displacement:
{{ordered list
| start=-5
|9=Abseleration|10=Absity|11='''Absement'''|12=[[Displacement (vector)|Displacement]]|13=[[Velocity]]|14=[[Acceleration]]|15=[[Jerk (physics)|Jerk]]|16=[[Jounce]]/Snap|17=Crackle|18=[[Pop (physics)|Pop]]|7=Absounce|8=Abserk|19=Lock|20=Drop}}

==Absement and absementom==
Recent work in mechanics and [[memristor]]s and [[memcapacitor]]s further builds on the concept of absement, and assigns it the letter ''a'',&lt;ref name=PWTMG/&gt; and makes extensive use of plots such as the graph of absement as a function of displacement:
{{quote|text=... amplitude of the sinusoidal displacement with period ''T'' = 2''π''/''ω'', and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = ''A''/''ω'' is the value about which the analytic absement ''a''(''t'') oscillates.}}

:(See Table 4, "Analytic Displacement and Absement" versus "Piecewise Continuous Displacement and Absement").

==Strain absement==
Strain absement is the time-integral of [[strain (mechanics)|strain]], and is used extensively in mechanical systems and memsprings:
: a quantity called absement which allows mem-spring models to display hysteretic response in great abundance.&lt;ref name=PWTMG/&gt;

Today the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets. Aeronomy is a branch of [[atmospheric physics]].  Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and [[sounding rockets]] which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere.  [[Atmospheric tide]]s dominate the dynamics of the [[mesosphere]] and lower [[thermosphere]], essential to understanding the atmosphere as a whole.  Other phenomena studied are [[upper-atmospheric lightning]] discharges, such as [[Sprite (lightning)|red sprites]], sprite halos or blue jets.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Atmospheric tides==
{{Main|Atmospheric tide}}
[[Atmospheric tide]]s are global-scale periodic oscillations of the [[atmosphere]]. In many ways they are analogous to ocean [[tides]]. Atmospheric tides form an important mechanism for transporting energy input into the lower atmosphere from the upper atmosphere, while dominating the dynamics of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere.  Therefore, learning about atmospheric tides is essential in understanding the atmosphere as a whole.  Modeling and observations of atmospheric tides are needed in order to monitor and predict changes in the Earth's atmosphere.&lt;ref name=VollandAT&gt;Volland, H., "Atmospheric Tidal and Planetary Waves", Kluwer Publ., Dordrecht, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Upper-atmospheric lightning|Sprites (lightning)}}
[[Upper-atmospheric lightning]] or upper-atmospheric discharge are terms sometimes used by researchers to refer to a family of electrical-breakdown phenomena that occur well above the altitudes of normal [[lightning]]. The preferred current usage is '''[[transient luminous event]]s''' ('''TLEs''') to refer to the various types of electrical-discharge phenomena induced in the upper atmosphere by tropospheric lightning. TLEs includes red sprites, sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.&lt;ref&gt;Earle R. Williams (November 2001) "Sprites, elves, and glow discharge tubes," ''Physics Today'', '''54''' (11) :  41-47.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5981">[[File:Kloster Agios Dionysios.jpg|thumb|The old monastery of Agios Dionysios]]
The '''Monastery of Agios Dionysios in Olympus''' ({{lang-el|Μονή Αγίου Διονυσίου εν Ολύμπω}}) is a [[Greek Orthodox]] [[monastery]] on the slopes of [[Mount Olympus]], the most important monastery in the [[Pieria Prefecture]]. 
It is located at the [[Enipeas (Thessaly)|Enipeas]] ravine at an altitude of 850&amp;nbsp;m ({{coord|40.094|N|22.429|E|}}) 
The original monastery was established in 1542, was destroyed by [[Axis occupation of Greece|the Germans]] in 1943. A new monastery was established at a distance of some 5&amp;nbsp;km to the northeast of the old one, closer to the town of [[Litochoro]]. ({{coord|40.118|N|22.484|E|}}) .
The Agios Dionysios Monastery is a [[stauropegic]] monastery, subordinated directly to the [[Patriarch of Constantinople]] (Istanbul).

Beside the monasteries [[Kanalon Monastery|Kanalon]] and [[Agia Triada Monastery, Sparmos|Agia Triada, Sparmos]] it is one of the [[List of churches and monasteries in Mount Olympus|monasteries located at Mount Olympus]].

== Name ==
Originally the name of the ancient monastery was Agia Triada, [[Holy Trinity]], (Greek Αγία Τριάδα).&lt;ref&gt;https://orthodoxwiki.org/Holy_Trinity&lt;/ref&gt; In the course of time, however, the name of its founder,  Saint Dionysius of Olympus , has prevailed. The new monastery was named directly after Saint Dionysius.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.johnsanidopoulos.com/2011/01/saint-dionysios-of-olympus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Old Monastery ==
The old monastery was founded  and devoted to the Holy Trinity by Saint Dionysius in 1542. 
Surrounded by strong high walls and towered by a watchtower, it resembles a small fortress. During various conflicts it served as a shelter for civilians, but also for fighting troops. 
Today the visitor can see a ruin from the outside. In its history the monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt several times. It was destroyed in 1821 by [[Veli Pasha]] and again by the German [[Wehrmacht]] in April 1943. 
Assuming that the building might serve as a refuge for Greek resistance fighters, the Germans first bombed it and later demolished it with explosives.

=== The chapel of Saint Dionysios ===
[[File:Kapelle des Heiligen Dionysios.jpg|thumb|The chapel of Saint Dionysios]]

Twenty minutes' walk from the old monastery is the chapel of Saint Dionysius. It is located at the Enipeas River in a southeastern direction from the monastery. Who from Litochoro ascends to Prionia comes necessarily by the chapel. It is built under an overhanging rock, just above a spring. It consists of a small devotional space where the saint celebrated the sacred liturgy during his time as a hermit. A small shed served him as a sleeping place.

== New Monastery ==
[[File:Abaton.jpg|thumb|Sign informing visitors of the ''abaton'' rule.]]
The monks abandoned the destroyed monastery and moved into the [[Metochion]], the estate of the monastery. The Metochion was founded in 1650 and consisted, apart from the lands, of a church, the economic buildings and another building in which the monks lived, who took care of the farm. 

After the Second World War, this estate was gradually expanded into a monastery. The older part of the new monastery is equipped with a heavy iron door and thus separated from the rest of the system. It contains the cells of the monks, the refectory and the administrative building.
As is usual with  Greek Orthodox monasteries, the this part of the building is subject to the ''[[abaton]]'' ("inaccessible") rule, prohibiting access to female visitors.
Just outside are the stables, workshops and the cheese factory. All   buildings  outside the ''abaton'', such as the new church or the museum, were built after 1985.

=== The church ===
The monastery church was built in classical orthodox style. An image of Saint Dionysius adorns the entrance. Inside, in addition to the usual sumptuous decor of an Orthodox church, there are some special features. It is striking that many chairs, standing consoles and other items are decorated with [[marquetry]]. The inserts are made of ivory or mother-of-pearl. On a small table stands an icon depicting the resurrection of Jesus Christ. Next to it is a little basket with notes and ball-point pens. Believers who want to make a request to the saint can put it here on paper.

=== The museum ===
To the west of the complex is the museum. In troubled times, of which the old monastery lived some, monks were hiding the monastic treasures in secret vaults. A selection of rescued exhibits:

* Three silver skulls, into which bone pieces of saints were worked, are exhibited together with other relics.
* Old documents, including the document from the year 949 of the Islamic calendar (1542 AD), in which the Ottoman occupiers allow the repair (in fact probably the foundation) of a monastery on Mount Olympus.
* Through a magnifying glass one can admire the finest wood carvings within a metal cross.
* A epitaph, embroidered with gold threads, made in the years 1578 and -79 by Arsenius, a monk of the [[Meteora]] monasteries.
* Some of the rescued icons of the old monastery.

Quite inconspicuous, but significant, some framed black-and-white photographs hang near the entrance. They show the old monastery in the mountains just before its destruction. A soldier of the Wehrmacht made these pictures secretly and sent them to the monastery a few years ago.

This protein was the first to have its structure solved by [[X-ray crystallography]] by [[Max Perutz]] and [[John Kendrew|Sir John Cowdery Kendrew]] in 1958, for which they received a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].]]

A '''biomolecule''' or '''biological molecule''' is a loosely used term for [[molecule]]s and [[ion]]s that are present in [[organism]]s, essential to some typically biological process such as cell division, morphogenesis, or development.&lt;ref&gt;Bunge, M. (1979). ''Treatise on Basic Philosophy'', vol. 4. Ontology II: A World of Systems, p. 61-2. [https://books.google.com/books?id=4hpNzUzH1E4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;pg=PA61 link].&lt;/ref&gt; Biomolecules include large [[macromolecule]]s (or polyanions) such as [[protein]]s, [[carbohydrate]]s, [[lipid]]s, and [[nucleic acid]]s, as well as [[small molecule]]s such as primary [[metabolite]]s, [[secondary metabolite]]s, and [[natural product]]s. A more general name for this class of material is biological materials. Biomolecules are usually [[endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] but may also be [[exogeny|exogenous]]. For example, [[pharmaceutical drug]]s may be natural products or [[semisynthesis|semisynthetic]] ([[biopharmaceutical]]s) or they may be [[total synthesis|totally synthetic]].

[[Biology]] and its subsets of [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]] study biomolecules and their [[organic reaction|reactions]]. Most biomolecules are [[organic compound]]s, and just four [[chemical element|elements]]—[[oxygen]], [[carbon]], [[hydrogen]], and [[nitrogen]]—make up 96% of the [[human body]]'s mass. But many other elements, such as the various [[biometal (biology)|biometals]],  are present in small amounts.

The uniformity of specific types of molecules (the biomolecules) and of some [[metabolic pathway]]s as invariant features between the diversity of life forms is called "biochemical universals"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Green |first=D. E. |last2=Goldberger |first2=R. |title=Molecular Insights into the Living Process |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1967 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=&amp;id=xi6FAAAAIAAJ |via=[[Google Books]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; or "theory of material unity of the living beings", a unifying concept in biology, along with [[cell theory]] and [[evolution theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gayon |first=J. |chapter=La philosophie et la biologie |title=Encyclopédie philosophique universelle |volume=vol.

==Nucleosides and nucleotides==
{{Main|Nucleosides|Nucleotides}}

'''Nucleosides'''  are molecules formed by attaching a [[nucleobase]] to a [[ribose]] or [[deoxyribose]] ring. Examples of these include [[cytidine]] (C), [[uridine]] (U), [[adenosine]] (A), [[guanosine]] (G), and [[thymidine]] (T).

Nucleosides can be [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]] by specific [[kinase]]s in the cell, producing [[nucleotide]]s. 
Both [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] are [[polymer]]s, consisting of long, linear molecules assembled by [[polymerase]] enzymes from repeating structural units, or monomers, of mononucleotides. DNA uses the deoxynucleotides C, G, A, and T, while RNA uses the ribonucleotides (which have an extra hydroxyl(OH) group on the pentose ring) C, G, A, and U. Modified bases are fairly common (such as with methyl groups on the base ring), as found in [[ribosome|ribosomal]] RNA or [[transfer RNA]]s or for discriminating the new from old strands of DNA after replication.&lt;ref name=slabaugh&gt;{{cite book |author1=Slabaugh, Michael R. |author2=Seager, Spencer L.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Organic and Biochemistry for Today |publisher=[[Brooks Cole]] |location=Pacific Grove |year=2007 |isbn=0-495-11280-1 |edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each nucleotide is made of an acyclic [[nitrogenous base]], a [[pentose]] and one to three [[phosphate|phosphate groups]]. They contain carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and phosphorus. They serve as sources of chemical energy ([[adenosine triphosphate]] and [[guanosine triphosphate]]), participate in [[cell (biology)|cellular]] signaling ([[cyclic guanosine monophosphate]] and [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]]), and are incorporated into important cofactors of enzymatic reactions ([[coenzyme A]], [[flavin adenine dinucleotide]], [[flavin mononucleotide]], and [[nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate]]).&lt;ref name=Alberts&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Alberts B, Johnson A, Lewis J, Raff M, Roberts K, Wlater P |last-author-amp=yes |title=Molecular biology of the cell |publisher=[[Garland Science]] |location=New York |year=2002 |pages=120–1 |isbn=0-8153-3218-1 |edition=4th |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mboc4.TOC&amp;depth=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DNA and RNA structure===
{{Main|DNA|Nucleic acid structure}}

DNA structure is dominated by the well-known [[double helix]] formed by Watson-Crick [[base-pair]]ing of C with G and A with T. This is known as [[B-DNA|B-form]] DNA, and is overwhelmingly the most favorable and common state of DNA; its highly specific and stable base-pairing is the basis of reliable genetic information storage. DNA can sometimes occur as single strands (often needing to be stabilized by single-strand binding proteins) or as [[A-DNA|A-form]] or [[Z-DNA|Z-form]] helices, and occasionally in more complex 3D structures such as the crossover at [[Holliday junction]]s during DNA replication.&lt;ref name=Alberts/&gt;

[[Image:Twort groupI intron RNAribbon stereo.jpg|thumb|right|Stereo 3D image of a group I intron ribozyme (PDB file 1Y0Q); gray lines show base pairs; ribbon arrows show double-helix regions, blue to red from 5' to 3' end; white ribbon is an RNA product.]] 
RNA, in contrast, forms large and complex 3D tertiary structures reminiscent of proteins, as well as the loose single strands with locally folded regions that constitute [[messenger RNA]] molecules. Those RNA structures contain many stretches of A-form double helix, connected into definite 3D arrangements by single-stranded loops, bulges, and junctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Saenger W |year=1984 |title=Principles of Nucleic Acid Structure |publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] |isbn=0387907629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples are tRNA, ribosomes, [[ribozyme]]s, and [[riboswitch]]es. These complex structures are facilitated by the fact that RNA backbone has less local flexibility than DNA but a large set of distinct conformations, apparently because of both positive and negative interactions of the extra OH on the ribose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richardson JS, Schneider B, Murray LW, Kapral GJ, Immormino RM, Headd JJ, Richardson DC, Ham D, Hershkovits E, Williams LD, Keating KS, Pyle AM, Micallef D, Westbrook J, Berman HM |year=2008 |title=RNA Backbone: Consensus all-angle conformers and modular string nomenclature |journal=RNA |volume=14 |pages=465–481 |pmc=2248255 |doi=10.1261/rna.657708 |pmid=18192612}}&lt;/ref&gt; Structured RNA molecules can do highly specific binding of other molecules and can themselves be recognized specifically; in addition, they can perform enzymatic catalysis (when they are known as "[[ribozyme]]s", as initially discovered by Tom Cech and colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kruger K, Grabowski PJ, Zaug AJ, Sands J, Gottschling DE, Cech TR |year=1982 |title=Self-splicing RNA: autoexcision and autocyclization of the ribosomal RNA intervening sequence of Tetrahymena |journal=Cell |volume=31 |pages=147–157 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(82)90414-7 |pmid=6297745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saccharides==
[[Monosaccharide|'''Monosaccharides''']] are the simplest form of [[carbohydrate]]s with only one simple sugar. They essentially contain an [[aldehyde]] or [[ketone]] group in their structure.&lt;ref name=Peng09&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Peng, Bo |author2=Yu Qin  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Fructose and Satiety |journal=Journal of Nutrition |volume= |issue= |pages=6137–42 |date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of an aldehyde group in a monosaccharide is indicated by the prefix ''aldo-''. Similarly, a ketone group is denoted by the prefix ''keto-''.&lt;ref name=slabaugh/&gt; Examples of monosaccharides are the [[hexose]]s,  [[glucose]], [[fructose]], [[Triose]]s, [[Tetrose]]s, [[Heptose]]s, [[galactose]], [[pentose]]s, ribose, and deoxyribose. Consumed fructose and [[glucose]] have different rates of gastric emptying, are differentially absorbed and have different metabolic fates, providing multiple opportunities for 2 different saccharides to differentially affect food intake.&lt;ref name=Peng09/&gt; Most saccharides eventually provide fuel for cellular respiration.

'''[[Disaccharide]]s''' are formed when two monosaccharides, or two single simple sugars, form a bond with removal of water. They can be hydrolyzed to yield their saccharin building blocks by boiling with dilute acid or reacting them with appropriate enzymes.&lt;ref name=slabaugh/&gt; Examples of disaccharides include [[sucrose]], [[maltose]], and [[lactose]].

'''[[Polysaccharide]]s''' are polymerized monosaccharides, or complex carbohydrates. They have multiple simple sugars. Examples are [[starch]], [[cellulose]], and [[glycogen]]. They are generally large and often have a complex branched connectivity. Because of their size, polysaccharides are not water-soluble, but their many hydroxy groups become hydrated individually when exposed to water, and some polysaccharides form thick colloidal dispersions when heated in water.&lt;ref name=slabaugh/&gt; Shorter polysaccharides, with 3 - 10 monomers, are called [[oligosaccharide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A fluorescent indicator-displacement molecular imprinting sensor was developed for discriminating saccharides. It successfully discriminated three brands of orange juice beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Jin, Tan |author2=Wang He-Fang |author3=Yan Xiu-Ping  |last-author-amp=yes |title=Discrimination of Saccharides with a Fluorescent Molecular Imprinting Sensor Array Based on Phenylboronic Acid Functionalized Mesoporous Silica |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=81 |issue=13 |pages=5273–80 |year=2009 |pmid=19507843 |doi=10.1021/ac900484x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The change in fluorescence intensity of the sensing films resulting is directly related to the saccharide concentration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bo Peng  |author2=Yu Qin  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Lipophilic Polymer Membrane Optical Sensor with a Synthetic Receptor for Saccharide Detection |journal=Anal. Chem. |volume=80 |issue=15|pages=6137–41 |year=2008 |pmid=18593197 |doi=10.1021/ac800946p}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lignin==
[[Lignin]] is a complex polyphenolic macromolecule composed mainly of beta-O4-aryl linkages. After cellulose, lignin is the second most abundant biopolymer and is one of the primary structural components of most plants. It contains subunits derived from [[paracoumaryl alcohol|''p''-coumaryl alcohol]], [[coniferyl alcohol]], and [[sinapyl alcohol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor= K. Freudenberg |editor2=A.C. Nash |year=1968 |title=Constitution and Biosynthesis of Lignin |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer-Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is unusual among biomolecules in that it is [[racemic]]. The lack of optical activity is due to the polymerization of lignin which occurs via [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] coupling reactions in which there is no preference for either configuration at a [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral center]].

==Lipids==
[[Lipid]]s (oleaginous) are chiefly '''[[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s''', and are the basic building blocks of [[cell membrane|biological membranes]]. Another biological role is energy storage (e.g., [[triglyceride]]s). Most lipids consist of a [[polar molecule|polar]] or [[hydrophilic]] head (typically glycerol) and one to three nonpolar or [[hydrophobic]] fatty acid tails, and therefore they are [[amphiphilic]]. Fatty acids consist of unbranched chains of carbon atoms that are connected by single bonds alone ('''[[saturated fat|saturated]]''' fatty acids) or by both single and [[double bond]]s ('''[[unsaturated fat|unsaturated]]''' fatty acids). The chains are usually 14-24 carbon groups long, but it is always an even number.

For lipids present in biological membranes, the hydrophilic head is from one of three classes:

* [[Glycolipid]]s, whose heads contain an [[oligosaccharide]] with 1-15 saccharide residues.
* [[Phospholipid]]s, whose heads contain a positively charged group that is linked to the tail by a negatively charged phosphate group.
* [[Sterol]]s, whose heads contain a planar steroid ring, for example, [[cholesterol]].

Other lipids include [[prostaglandins]] and [[leukotrienes]] which are both 20-carbon fatty acyl units synthesized from [[arachidonic acid]].
They are also known as fatty acids

==Amino acids==
[[Amino acids]] contain both [[amino]] and [[carboxylic acid]] [[functional group]]s. (In [[biochemistry]], the term amino acid is used when referring to those amino acids in which the amino and carboxylate functionalities are attached to the same carbon, plus [[proline]] which is not actually an amino acid).

Modified amino acids are sometimes observed in proteins; this is usually the result of enzymatic modification after [[translation (biology)|translation]] ([[protein synthesis]]). For example, phosphorylation of serine by [[kinases]] and dephosphorylation by [[phosphatases]] is an important control mechanism in the [[cell cycle]]. Only two amino acids other than the standard twenty are known to be incorporated into proteins during translation, in certain organisms:

* [[Selenocysteine]] is incorporated into some proteins at a UGA [[codon]], which is normally a stop codon.
* [[Pyrrolysine]] is incorporated into some proteins at a UAG codon. For instance, in some [[methanogen]]s in enzymes that are used to produce [[methane]].

Besides those used in [[protein synthesis]], other biologically important amino acids include [[carnitine]] (used in lipid transport within a cell), [[ornithine]], [[GABA]] and [[taurine]].

===Protein structure===
{{main|Protein structure|Protein primary structure|Protein secondary structure|Protein tertiary structure|Protein quaternary structure}}
The particular series of amino acids that form a protein is known as that protein's [[primary structure]]. This sequence is determined by the genetic makeup of the individual. It specifies the order of side-chain groups along the linear polypeptide "backbone".

Proteins have two types of well-classified, frequently occurring elements of local structure defined by a particular pattern of [[hydrogen bond]]s along the backbone: [[alpha helix]] and [[beta sheet]]. Their number and arrangement is called the [[secondary structure]] of the protein. Alpha helices are regular spirals stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the backbone CO group ([[carbonyl]]) of one amino acid residue and the backbone NH group ([[amide]]) of the i+4 residue. The spiral has about 3.6 amino acids per turn, and the amino acid side chains stick out from the cylinder of the helix. Beta pleated sheets are formed by backbone hydrogen bonds between individual beta strands each of which is in an "extended", or fully stretched-out, conformation. The strands may lie parallel or antiparallel to each other, and the side-chain direction alternates above and below the sheet. Hemoglobin contains only helices, natural silk is formed of beta pleated sheets, and many enzymes have a pattern of alternating helices and beta-strands. The secondary-structure elements are connected by "loop" or "coil" regions of non-repetitive conformation, which are sometimes quite mobile or disordered but usually adopt a well-defined, stable arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Richardson | first = JS | authorlink = Jane S. Richardson | year = 1981 | title = The Anatomy and Taxonomy of Proteins | journal = Advances in Protein Chemistry | volume = 34 | pages = 167&amp;ndash;339 [http://kinemage.biochem.duke.edu/teaching/Anatax/] | doi = 10.1016/S0065-3233(08)60520-3 | pmid=7020376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overall, compact, [[dimension|3D]] structure of a protein is termed its [[tertiary structure]] or its "fold". It is formed as result of various attractive forces like [[hydrogen bonding]], [[disulfide bridges]], [[hydrophobic interactions]], [[hydrophilic]] interactions, [[van der Waals force]] etc.

When two or more [[polypeptide]] chains (either of identical or of different sequence) cluster to form a protein, [[quaternary structure]] of protein is formed. Quaternary structure is an attribute of [[polymer]]ic (same-sequence chains) or [[heteromeric]] (different-sequence chains) proteins like [[hemoglobin]], which consists of two "alpha" and two "beta" polypeptide chains.

====Apoenzymes====
An [[apoenzyme]] (or, generally, an apoprotein) is the protein without any small-molecule cofactors, substrates, or inhibitors bound. It is often important as an inactive storage, transport, or secretory form of a protein. This is required, for instance, to protect the secretory cell from the activity of that protein.
Apoenzymes becomes active enzymes on addition of a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]]. Cofactors can be either inorganic (e.g., metal ions and [[iron-sulfur clusters]]) or organic compounds, (e.g., [Flavin group|flavin] and [[heme]]). Organic cofactors can be either [[prosthetic groups]], which are tightly bound to an enzyme, or [[coenzymes]], which are released from the enzyme's active site during the reaction.

====Isoenzymes====
[[Isoenzymes]], or isozymes, are multiple forms of an enzyme, with slightly different [[protein sequence]] and closely similar but usually not identical functions. They are either products of different [[genes]], or else different products of [[alternative splicing]]. They may either be produced in different organs or cell types to perform the same function, or several isoenzymes may be produced in the same cell type under differential regulation to suit the needs of changing development or environment. LDH ([[lactate dehydrogenase]]) has multiple isozymes, while [[fetal hemoglobin]] is an example of a developmentally regulated isoform of a non-enzymatic protein. The relative levels of isoenzymes in blood can be used to diagnose problems in the organ of secretion .

Chemically, '''black carbon''' ('''BC''') is a component of fine [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM ≤ 2.5&amp;nbsp;µm in [[aerodynamic diameter]]). Black carbon consists of pure carbon in several linked forms.  It is formed through the incomplete combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, [[biofuel]], and [[biomass]], and is emitted in both [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] and naturally occurring [[soot]].&lt;ref name="Anenberg, ''et al.'', 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Anenberg SC, Schwartz J, Shindell D, Amann M, Faluvegi G, Klimont Z, Janssens-Maenhout G, Pozzoli L, Van Dingenen R, Vignati E, Emberson L, Muller NZ, West JJ, Williams M, Demkine V, Hicks WK, Kuylenstierna J, Raes F, Ramanathan V |title=Global air quality and health co-benefits of mitigating near-term climate change through methane and black carbon emission controls |journal=Environ Health Perspect |date=June 2012 |volume=120 |issue=6 |pages=831–839 |doi=10.1289/ehp.1104301|pmid=22418651| pmc=3385429 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[climatology]], black carbon is a [[climate forcing]] agent. Black carbon [[Global warming|warms the Earth]] by absorbing sunlight and heating the atmosphere and by reducing [[albedo]] when deposited on snow and ice (direct effects) and indirectly by interaction with clouds, with the total forcing of 1.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jgrd.50171/abstract|title = Bounding the role of black carbon in the climate system: A scientific assessment|last = Bond|date = 2013|journal = J.

The term ''black carbon'' is also used in [[soil sciences]] and geology, referring either to deposited atmospheric black carbon or to directly incorporated black carbon from vegetation fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Masiello | first1 = C.A. | year = 2004 | title = New directions in black carbon organic geochemistry | url = | journal = MARINE CHEMISTRY | volume = 92 | issue = | pages = 201–213 | doi=10.1016/j.marchem.2004.06.043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schmidt | first1 = M.W.I. | last2 = Noack | first2 = A.G. | year = 2000 | title = Black carbon in soils and sediments: Analysis, distribution, implications and current challenges | url = | journal = GLOBAL BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLES | volume = 14 | issue = | pages = 777–793 | doi=10.1029/1999gb001208 | bibcode=2000GBioC..14..777S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially in the tropics, black carbon in soils significantly contributes to fertility as it is able to absorb important plant nutrients.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser B (2007) Prehistorically modified soils of central Amazonia: a model for sustainable agriculture in the twenty-first century.

==Overview==
{{Essay-like|section|date=February 2013}}
The term black carbon was coined by [[Tihomir Novakov]], referred to as "the godfather of black carbon studies" by [[James Hansen]], in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chen|first1=Allan|title=Carbonaceous Aerosols and Climate Change: How Researchers Proved Black Carbon is a Significant Force in the Atmosphere|url=http://eetd.lbl.gov/newsletter/nl17/eetd-nl17-4-blackcarbon.html|publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory|accessdate=2015-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoke or soot was the first pollutant to be recognized as having significant [[environmental impact]] yet one of the last to be studied by the contemporary atmospheric research community.  [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] recognized that soot was composed of carbon and that it was produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, M., Chemical History of a Candle, Harper, New York, 1861&lt;/ref&gt;

Soot is composed of a complex mixture of organic compounds which are weakly absorbing in the visible spectral region and a highly absorbing black component which is variously called “elemental”, “graphitic” or “black carbon”. The term elemental carbon has been used in conjunction with thermal and wet chemical determinations and the term  graphitic carbon suggests the presence  of [[graphite]]-like micro-crystalline structures in soot as evidenced by [[Raman Spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | title = Raman scattering and the characterization of  atmospheric aerosol particles | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 266 | issue = 708–710| page = 1977 | doi=10.1038/266708a0| bibcode = 1977Natur.266..708R}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term black carbon is used to imply that this soot component is primarily responsible for the absorption of visible light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yasa | first1 = Z. | last2 = Amer | first2 = N.M. | last3 = Rosen | first3 = H. | last4 = Hansen | first4 = A.D.A | last5 = Novakov | first5 = T. | year = 1979 | title = Photoacoustic investigations of urban aerosol particles | url = | journal = Appl.

===Early mitigation attempts===
The disastrous effects of coal pollution on human health and mortality in the early 1950s in London led to the UK [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. This act led to dramatic  reductions of soot concentrations in the United Kingdom which were followed by similar reductions in US cities like Pittsburgh and St. Louis. These reductions were largely achieved by the decreased use of soft coal for domestic heating by switching either to “smokeless” coals or other forms of fuel, such as fuel oil and natural gas.  The steady reduction of smoke pollution in the industrial cities of Europe and United States caused a shift in research emphasis away from soot emissions and the almost complete neglect of black carbon as a significant aerosol constituent, at least in the United States.

In the 1970s, however, a series of studies substantially changed this picture and demonstrated that black carbon as well as the organic soot components continued to be a large component in urban aerosols across the United States and Europe&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Novakov | first1 = T. | last2 = Chang | first2 = S.G. | last3 = Harker | first3 = A.B. | year = 1974 | title = Sulfates as pollution particulates:Catalytic formationon carbon(soot) particles | url = | journal = Science | volume = 186 | issue = | pages = 259–261 | doi=10.1126/science.186.4160.259|bibcode = 1974Sci...186..259N | pmid=17782021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chang | first1 = S.G. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | year = 1975 | title = Formation of pollution particulate nitrogen compounds by NO-soot and NH3-soot gas particle surface reactions | url = | journal = Atmos.

In the less-developed regions of the world where there were limited or no controls on soot emissions the air quality continued to degrade as the population increased.  It was not generally realized until many years later that from the perspective of global effects the emissions from these regions were extremely important.

===Influence on Earth's atmosphere===
Most of the developments mentioned above relate to air quality in urban atmospheres. The first indications of the role of black carbon in a larger, global context came from studies of the Arctic Haze phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell. J.M., Visual Range in the polar regions with particular reference to the Alaskan Arctic, ''J. Almos. Terr. Phys.'', suppl., 195-211, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;  Black carbon was identified in the Arctic haze aerosols&lt;ref name=Rosen&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Novakov | first2 = T. | last3 = Bodhaine | first3 = B. | year = 1981 | title = Soot in the Arctic | url = | journal = Atmos.

In general, aerosol particles can affect the radiation balance leading to a cooling or heating effect with the magnitude and sign of the temperature change largely dependent on aerosol optical properties, aerosol concentrations, and the albedo of the underlying surface.  A purely scattering aerosol will reflect energy that would normally be absorbed by the earth-atmosphere system back to space and leads to a cooling effect. As one adds an absorbing component to the aerosol, it can lead to a heating of the earth-atmosphere system if the reflectivity of the underlying surface is sufficiently high.

Early studies of the effects of aerosols on atmospheric radiative transfer on a global scale assumed a dominantly scattering aerosol with only a small absorbing component, since this appears to be a good representation of naturally occurring aerosols. However, as discussed above, urban aerosols have a large black carbon component and if these particles can be transported on a global scale then one would expect a heating effect over surfaces with a high surface albedo like snow or ice.  Furthermore, if these particles are deposited in the snow an additional heating effect would occur due to reductions in the surface albedo.

===Measuring and modeling spatial distribution===
Levels of Black carbon are most often determined based on the modification of the optical properties of a fiber filter by deposited particles. Either filter transmittance, filter reflectance or a combination of transmittance and reflectance is measured. [[Aethalometers]] are frequently used devices that optically detect the changing absorption of light transmitted through a filter ticket. The USEPA Environmental Technology Verification program evaluated both the Aethalometer &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=EPA|first=|date=February 2014|title=ETV Joint Verification Statement|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/P100MH5J.PDF?Dockey=P100MH5J.PDF|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also the Sunset Laboratory thermal-optical analyzer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.epa.gov/nrmrl/archive-etv/web/html/vt-ams.html#bcm]&lt;/ref&gt; A multiangle absorption photometer takes into account both transmitted and reflected light.  Alternative methods rely on satellite based measurements of optical depth for large areas or more recently on spectral noise analysis for very local concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dekoninck | first1 = L. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 2013 | title = An instantaneous spatiotemporal model to predict a bicyclist's Black Carbon exposure based on mobile noise measurements | url = | journal = Atmospheric Environment | volume =  79| issue = | pages =  623–631| doi = 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2013.06.054 | bibcode = 2013AtmEn..79..623D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s and early 1980s surprisingly large ground level concentrations of black carbon were observed throughout the western Arctic.&lt;ref name=Rosen/&gt; Modeling studies indicated that they could lead to heating over polar ice. One of the major uncertainties in modeling the effects of the Arctic haze on the solar radiation balance was limited knowledge of the vertical distributions of black carbon.

During 1983 and 1984 as part of the [[NOAA]] AGASP program, the first measurements of such distributions in the Arctic atmosphere were obtained with an [[aethalometer]] which had the capability of measuring black carbon on a real-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hansen | first1 = A.D.A. | last2 = Rosen | first2 = H. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = The Aethalometer: an instrument for real-time measurement of optical absorption by aerosol particles | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 191–196 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90265-1| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..191H }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These measurements showed substantial concentrations of black carbon found throughout the western Arctic troposphere including the North Pole.  The vertical profiles showed either a strongly layered structure or an almost uniform distribution up to eight kilometers with concentrations within layers as large as those found at ground level in typical mid-latitude urban areas in the United States.&lt;ref name=Rosen2&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosen | first1 = H. | last2 = Hansen | first2 = A.D.A. | last3 = Novakov | first3 = T. | year = 1984 | title = Role of graphitic carbon particles in radiative transfer in the Arctic haze | url = | journal = The Science of the Total Environment | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 103–110 | doi=10.1016/0048-9697(84)90253-5| bibcode = 1984ScTEn..36..103R }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The absorption [[optical depth]]s associated with these vertical profiles were large as evidenced by a vertical profile over the Norwegian arctic where absorption optical depths of 0.023 to 0.052 were calculated respectively for external and internal mixtures of black carbon with the other aerosol components.&lt;ref name=Rosen2/&gt;

Optical depths of these magnitudes lead to a substantial change in the solar radiation balance over the highly reflecting Arctic snow surface during the March–April time frame of these measurements modeled the Arctic aerosol for an absorption optical depth of 0.021 (which is close to the average of an internal and external mixtures for the AGASP flights), under cloud-free conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Porch | first1 = W.M. | last2 = McCracken | first2 = M.C. | year = 1982 | title = Parametric study of the effects of arctic soot on solar radiation | url = | journal = Atmos.

===Presence in soils===
Up to 30% of the total carbon stored in soils is contributed by black carbon.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} Especially for tropical soils black carbon serves as a reservoir for nutrients. Experiments showed that soils without high amounts of black carbon are significantly less fertile than soils that contain black carbon. An example for this increased soil fertility are the [[Terra preta]] soils of central Amazonia, which are presumably human-made by pre-Columbian native populations. Terra Preta soils have on average three times higher soil organic matter (SOM) content, higher nutrient levels and a better nutrient retention capacity than surrounding infertile soils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Glaser | first1 = B. | last2 = Haumaier | first2 = L. | last3 = Guggenberger | first3 = G. | last4 = Zech | first4 = W. | year = 2001 | title = The 'Terra preta' phenomenon: a model for sustainable agriculture in the humid tropics | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 88 | issue = | pages = 37–41 | doi=10.1007/s001140000193|bibcode = 2001NW.....88...37G }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the [[slash and burn]] agricultural practice used in tropical regions does not only enhance productivity by releasing nutrients from the burned vegetation but also by adding black carbon to the soil. Nonetheless, for a sustainable management, a [[slash-and-char]] practice would be better in order to prevent high emissions of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and volatile black carbon. Furthermore, the positive effects of this type of agriculture are counteracted if used for large patches so that soil erosion is not prevented by the vegetation.

==Emission sources==

===By region===
Developed countries were once the primary source of black carbon emissions, but this began to change in the 1950s with the adoption of pollution control technologies in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 ("Until about the 1950s, North America and Western Europe were the major sources of soot emissions, but now developing nations in the tropics and East Asia are the major source problem.").&lt;/ref&gt;   Whereas the United States emits about 21% of the world’s CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, it emits 6.1% of the world’s soot.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union and United States might further reduce their black carbon emissions by accelerating implementation of black carbon regulations that currently take effect in 2015 or 2020&lt;ref&gt;Clean Air Fine Particle Implementation Rule, 72 Fed. Reg. 20586, 20587 (April 25, 2007) (to be codified as 40 C.F.R. pt. 51), ''available at''http://www.epa.gov/fedrgstr/EPA-AIR/2007/April/Day-25/a6347.pdf; Press Release, European Union, Environment: Commission welcomes final adoption of the air quality directive, (April 14, 2008), ''available at'' http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/08/570&amp;type = HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en.&lt;/ref&gt; and by supporting the adoption of pending International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization, Press Release, IMO Environment meeting Approves Revised Regulations on Ship Emissions, International Maritime Organization (4 April 2008),'' available at''http://www.imo.org/About/mainframe.asp?topic_id=1709&amp;doc_id=9123(The IMO has approved amendments to MARPOL Annex VI Regulations for the Prevention of Air Pollution from Ships which are now subject to adoption at an October 2008  meeting.).&lt;/ref&gt; Existing regulations also could be expanded to increase the use of clean diesel and [[clean coal technology|clean coal technologies]] and to develop second-generation technologies.

Today, the majority of black carbon emissions are from developing countries&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 2-3 (October 18, 2007), ''available at''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110647.pdf [hereinafter Bond Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; and this trend is expected to increase.&lt;ref name="Reference Jacobson"&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The largest sources of black carbon are Asia, Latin America, and Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Tami Bond, ''Summary: Aerosols'', Air Pollution as a Climate Forcing: A Workshop, Honolulu, Hawaii, April 29-May 3, 2002, ''available at'' http://www.giss.nasa.gov/meetings/pollution2002/&lt;/ref&gt;  China and India together account for 25-35% of global black carbon emissions.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael,'' supra'' note 1, at 226&lt;/ref&gt; Black carbon emissions from China doubled from 2000 to 2006.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan" /&gt;  Existing and well-tested technologies used by developed countries, such as clean diesel and clean coal, could be transferred to developing countries to reduce their emissions.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony,'' supra'' note 4, at 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon emissions are highest in and around major source regions. This results in regional hotspots of atmospheric solar heating due to black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221&lt;/ref&gt;  Hotspot areas include:&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Indo-Gangetic plains of India
* eastern China 
* most of Southeast Asia and Indonesia 
* equatorial regions of Africa 
* Mexico and Central America 
* most of Brazil and Peru in South America.

Approximately three billion people live in these hotspots.&lt;ref name="V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, id"/&gt;

===By source===
[[File:Tahmand alumiiniumpott.JPG|thumb|Black carbon on a cooking pot. Result of a biofuel cooking.]]
Approximately 20% of black carbon is emitted from burning biofuels, 40% from fossil fuels, and 40% from open biomass burning.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.'' at 224.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar estimates of the sources of black carbon emissions are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;See Bond Testimony, ''supra'' note 42, at 2 (figure 1)&lt;/ref&gt;

*42%    Open biomass burning (forest and savanna burning)
*18%	Residential biofuel burned with traditional technologies
*14%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for transportation
*10%	[[Diesel exhaust|Diesel engines]] for industrial use
*10% 	Industrial processes and power generation, usually from smaller boilers
*6%	Residential [[coal]] burned with traditional technologies&lt;ref&gt;Bond Testimony,'' id.'' at 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon sources vary by region.  For example, the majority of soot emissions in South Asia are due to biofuel cooking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Venkataraman | first1 = C. | last2 = Habib | first2 = G. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2005 | title = Residential Biofuels in South Asia: Carbonaceous Aerosol Emissions and Climate Impacts | url = | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5714| pages = 1454–1456 | doi=10.1126/science.1104359|bibcode = 2005Sci...307.1454V | pmid=15746423}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas in East Asia, coal combustion for residential and industrial uses plays a larger role. In Western Europe, traffic seems to be the most important source since high concentrations coincide with proximity to major roads or participation to (motorized) traffic.&lt;ref name="Dons et al."&gt;{{cite journal

Fossil fuel and biofuel soot have significantly greater amounts of black carbon than climate-cooling aerosols and particulate matter, making reductions of these sources particularly powerful mitigation strategies. For example, emissions from the diesel engines and marine vessels contain higher levels of black carbon compared to other sources.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 5-6 (showing that shipping emissions produce more than 3 times as much black carbon as POC, while off-road vehicles produce 40% more black carbon than POC, and on-road vehicles produce 25-60% more black carbon than POC).&lt;/ref&gt;  Regulating black carbon emissions from diesel engines and marine vessels therefore presents a significant opportunity to reduce black carbon’s global warming impact.&lt;ref&gt;Although shipping only accounts for 1.7% of the global black carbon inventory, given the expected increase in shipping throughout regions especially sensitive to black carbon like the Arctic, it still represents a strong option for black carbon reductions.

Biomass burning emits greater amounts of climate-cooling [[aerosol]]s and particulate matter than black carbon, resulting in short-term cooling.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', ''supra'' note 27&lt;/ref&gt;  However, over the long-term, biomass burning may cause a net warming when CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions and deforestation are considered.&lt;ref&gt;Mark. Z. Jacobson, ''The Short-Term Cooling but Long-Term Global Warming Due to Biomass Burning'', 17 ''Journal of Climate'' 2909, 2923 (". . . whereas aerosol particles emitted during burning may cause a short-term cooling of global climate, longer-lived greenhouse gases may cause warming (or cancel the cooling) after several decades. As such, reducing biomass burning may cause short-term warming but long-term cooling or no change in temperature.

==Impacts==
Black carbon is a form of ultrafine [[particulate matter]], which when released in the air causes premature human mortality and disability.  In addition, atmospheric black carbon changes the radiative energy balance of the climate system in a way that raises air and surface temperatures, causing a variety of detrimental environmental impacts on humans, on agriculture, and on plant and animal ecosystems.

===Public health impacts===
Particulate matter is the most harmful to public health of all air pollutants in Europe. Black carbon particulate matter contains very fine [[carcinogen]]s and is therefore particularly harmful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/highlights/black-carbon-better-monitoring-needed|title=Black carbon: Better monitoring needed to assess health and climate change impacts|website=European Environment Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that from 640,000 to 4,900,000 premature human deaths could be prevented every year by utilizing available mitigation measures to reduce black carbon in the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Weinhold|first=Bob|title=Global Bang for the Buck: Cutting Black Carbon and Methane Benefits Both Health and Climate|journal=Environ.

Humans are exposed to black carbon by inhalation of air in the immediate vicinity of local sources. Important indoor sources include candles and biomass burning whereas traffic and occasionally forest fires are the major outdoor sources of black carbon exposure. Concentrations of black carbon decrease sharply with increasing distance from (traffic) sources which makes it an atypical component of [[particulate matter]]. This makes it difficult to estimate exposure of populations. For particulate matter epidemiological studies have traditionally relied on single fixed site measurements or inferred residential concentrations.&lt;ref name="Dons et al. 2013 hourly"&gt;{{cite journal

The public health benefits of reduction in the amount of soot and other particulate matter has been recognized for years. However, high concentrations persist in industrializing areas in Asia and in urban areas in the West such as [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=Lydersen|first=Kari|title=Black Carbon Testing Finds High Levels| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/us/22cnccarbon.html|accessdate=April 22, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 21, 2011|quote=Major American cities generally have background levels of one to three micrograms of black carbon per cubic meter.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Health Organization|WHO]] estimates that air pollution causes nearly two million premature deaths per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs313/en/index.html|title=Ambient (outdoor) air quality and health|website=World Health Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; By reducing black carbon, a primary component of fine particulate matter, the health risks from air pollution will decline.  In fact, public health concerns have given rise to leading to many efforts to reduce such emissions, for example, from diesel vehicles and cooking stoves.

===Climate impacts===
'''Direct effect''' Black carbon particles directly absorb sunlight and reduce the planetary albedo when suspended in the atmosphere.

'''Semi-direct effect''' Black carbon absorb incoming solar radiation, perturb the temperature structure of the atmosphere, and influence cloud cover. They may either increase or decrease cloud cover under different conditions.&lt;ref name="Koch and Del Genio, 2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koch|first=D.|author2=A.D.Del Genio|title=Black carbon semi-direct effects on cloud cover: review and synthesis|journal=Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics|date=2010|volume=10|pages=7685–7696|doi=10.5194/acp-10-7685-2010|url=http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/10/7685/2010/acp-10-7685-2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Snow/ice albedo effect''' When deposited on high albedo surfaces like ice and snow, black carbon particles reduce the total surface albedo available to reflect solar energy back into space. Small initial snow albedo reduction may have a large forcing because of a positive feedback: Reduced snow albedo would increase surface temperature. The increased surface temperature would decrease the snow cover and further decrease surface albedo.&lt;ref name=JGR032612&gt;{{cite journal|author1=T. C. Bond|author2=S. J. Doherty |author3=D. W.

'''Indirect effect''' Black carbon may also indirectly cause changes in the absorption or reflection of solar radiation through changes in the properties and behavior of clouds. Research scheduled for publication in 2013 shows black carbon plays a role second only to carbon dioxide in climate change. Effects are complex, resulting from a variety of factors, but due to the short life of black carbon in the atmosphere, about a week as compared to carbon dioxide which last centuries, control of black carbon offers possible opportunities for slowing, or even reversing, climate change.&lt;ref name=JGR032612/&gt;&lt;!--{{cite journal|author2=S.

====Radiative forcing====
Estimates of black carbon’s globally averaged direct radiative forcing vary from the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]]’s estimate of + 0.34 watts per square meter (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) ± 0.25,&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 132 (2007), available at http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm. (Magnitudes and uncertainties added together, as per standard uncertainty rules)&lt;/ref&gt;  to a more recent estimate by V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael of 0.9 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a"&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''Global and regional climate changes due to black carbon'', 1 NATURE GEOSCIENCE  221-22 (23 March 2008) ("The BC forcing of 0.9 W m–2 (with a range of 0.4 to 1.2 W m–2) … is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other GHGs such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.")&lt;/ref&gt;

The IPCC also estimated the globally averaged snow albedo effect of black carbon at +0.1 ± 0.1 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

Based on the IPCC estimate, it would be reasonable to conclude that the combined direct and indirect snow albedo effects for black carbon rank it as the third largest contributor to globally averaged positive radiative forcing since the pre-industrial period. In comparison, the more recent direct radiative forcing estimate by Ramanathan and Carmichael &lt;ref name="Ramanathan_a" /&gt; would lead one to conclude that black carbon has contributed the second largest globally averaged radiative forcing after carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and that the radiative forcing of black carbon is “as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other greenhouse gasses (GHGs) such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, or tropospheric ozone.”

====Effects on Arctic ice and Himalayan glaciers====
According to the {{abbr|IPCC|Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change}}, “the presence of black carbon over highly reflective surfaces, such as snow and ice, or clouds, may cause a significant positive radiative forcing.”&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397. ("While the radiative forcing is generally negative, positive forcing occurs in areas with a very high surface reflectance such as desert regions in North Africa, and the snow fields of the Himalayas."); J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 14, at 425. (The brown haze over India, heavy with fossil fuel and biofuel soot, reaches to the Himalayas. If prevailing winds deposit even a fraction of this soot on glaciers, the snow black carbon content could be comparable to that in the Alps.").&lt;/ref&gt;  The IPCC also notes that emissions from [[biomass]] burning, which usually have a negative forcing,&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen, et al., ''Efficacy of Climate Forcing'', 110 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D18104, 1 (2005), ''available at'' {{cite web |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022162835/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2005/2005_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archivedate=2011-10-22 |df= }} (Accounting for forcing efficacies and for indirect effects via snow albedo and cloud changes, we find that fossil fuel soot, defined as black carbon + OC (organic carbon), has a net positive forcing while biomass burning black carbon + OC has a negative forcing).&lt;/ref&gt;  have a positive forcing over snow fields in areas such as the Himalayas.&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''supra'' note 13, at 397.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Charles Zender, black carbon is a significant contributor to Arctic ice-melt, and reducing such emissions may be “the most efficient way to mitigate Arctic warming that we know of”.&lt;ref&gt;Zender Testimony, ''supra''note 3, at 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The “climate forcing due to snow/ice albedo change is of the order of 1.0&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at middle- and high-latitude land areas in the Northern Hemisphere and over the Arctic Ocean.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 425.&lt;/ref&gt;  The “soot effect on snow albedo may be responsible for a quarter of observed global warming.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''id.'' at 428&lt;/ref&gt; “Soot deposition increases surface melt on ice masses, and the meltwater spurs multiple radiative and dynamical feedback processes that accelerate ice disintegration,” according to [[NASA]] scientists James Hansen and Larissa Nazarenko.&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''id.'' at 425&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this feedback process, “BC on snow warms the planet about three times more than an equal forcing of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.”&lt;ref&gt;See ''supra'' note 18&lt;/ref&gt;  When black carbon concentrations in the Arctic increase during the winter and spring due to [[Arctic Haze]], surface temperatures increase by 0.5&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;P.K.

Black carbon emissions from northern Eurasia, North America, and Asia have the greatest absolute impact on Arctic warming.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn,''supra'' note 34, at 1732.&lt;/ref&gt; However, black carbon emissions actually occurring within the Arctic have a disproportionately larger impact per particle on Arctic warming than emissions originating elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt; As Arctic ice melts and shipping activity increases, emissions originating within the Arctic are expected to rise.&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Quinn, ''id.'' at 1732; J. Hansen &amp; M.

Thus, in that case, reduction of some of the pollutants [including soot] may make it possible to keep further Arctic warming very small and thus probably avoid loss of all sea ice.")&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global warming===
In its 2007 report, the IPCC estimated for the first time the direct [[radiative forcing]] of black carbon from fossil fuel emissions at +&amp;nbsp;0.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², and the radiative forcing of black carbon through its effect on the surface albedo of snow and ice at an additional +&amp;nbsp;0.1&amp;nbsp;W/m².&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, ''Changes in Atmospheric Constituents and in Radiative Forcing'', in CLIMATE CHANGE 2007: THE PHYSICAL SCIENCE BASIS.  CONTRIBUTION OF WORKING GROUP I TO THE FOURTH ASSESSMENT REPORT OF THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE 129, 136, 163 (2007), ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies and public testimony by many of the same scientists cited in the IPCC’s report estimate that emissions from black carbon are the second-largest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide emissions, and that reducing these emissions may be the fastest strategy for slowing climate change.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''See id''. at 164, 170, 174–76, 217–34 (citing studies by Ramanathan, Jacobson, Zender, Hansen, and Bond); ''supra'' notes 3-4 (Zender Testimony and Ramanathan Testimony); ''infra'' notes 9 and 42 (Jacobson Testimony and Bond Testimony).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1950, many countries have significantly reduced black carbon emissions, especially from fossil fuel sources, primarily to improve public health from improved air quality, and “technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related BC” throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Climate Change, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform 4 (18 October 2007), ''available at ''http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110734.pdf [hereinafter Ramanathan Testimony] (The developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more. Thus the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon); ''but compare'' Bond, T. C., E. Bhardwaj, R. Dong, R. Jogani, S. Jung, C. Roden, D. G. Streets, and N. M. 'Trautmann Historical emissions of black and organic carbon aerosol from energy-related combustion, 1850–2000'', 21 Global Biogeochemical Cycles GB2018 (2007) (Previous work suggests a rapid rise in [global] black carbon emissions between 1950 and 2000; this work supports a more gradual, smooth increase between 1950 and 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Given black carbon’s relatively short lifespan, reducing black carbon emissions would reduce warming within weeks. Because black carbon remains in the atmosphere only for a few weeks, reducing black carbon emissions may be the fastest means of slowing climate change in the near term.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/science/earth/16degrees.html "Third-World Stove Soot Is Target in Climate Fight"] article by Elizabeth Rosenthal in ''[[The New York Times]]'' April 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Control of black carbon, particularly from fossil-fuel and biofuel sources, is very likely to be the fastest method of slowing global warming in the immediate future,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mark Z. Jacobson, Testimony for the Hearing on Black Carbon and Arctic, U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform (18 October 2007), ''available at'' http://oversight.house.gov/images/stories/documents/20071018110606.pdf [hereinafter Jacobson Testimony]&lt;/ref&gt; and major cuts in black carbon emissions could slow the effects of climate change for a decade or two.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony, ''supra'' note 8, at 3 ("Thus a drastic reduction in BC has the potential of offsetting the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced warming for a decade or two.").&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing black carbon emissions could help keep the climate system from passing the tipping points for [[abrupt climate change]]s, including significant sea-level rise from the melting of Greenland and/or Antarctic ice sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Lenton,  Hermann Held,  Elmar Kriegler, Jim Hall, Wolfgang Lucht, Stefan Rahmstorf, and Hans Joachim Schellnhuber, ''Tipping elements in the Earth’s climate system'', 105 PROC. OF THE NAT’L ACAD. OF SCI. 6 (12 February 2008) ("The greatest threats are tipping the Arctic sea-ice and the Greenland ice sheet. . ."); J. Hansen, ''Climate Catastrophe'', NEW SCIENTIST (28 July 2007) (...the primary issue is whether global warming will reach a level such that ice sheets begin to disintegrate in a rapid, non-linear fashion on West Antarctica, Greenland or both.").&lt;/ref&gt;

“Emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions”.&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 1, at 221 (". . . emissions of black carbon are the second strongest contribution to current global warming, after carbon dioxide emissions.") Numerous scientists also calculate that black carbon may be second only to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in its contribution to climate change, including Tami C. Bond &amp; Haolin Sun, ''Can Reducing Black Carbon Emissions Counteract Global Warming'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHN. (2005), at 5921 ("BC is the second or third largest individual warming agent, following carbon dioxide and methane."); ''and'' J. Hansen, ''A Brighter Future'', 53 CLIMATE CHANGE 435 (2002), ''available at'' http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2002/2002_Hansen_1.pdf (calculating the climate forcing of BC at 1.0±0.5 W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt; Calculation of black carbon’s combined climate forcing at 1.0–1.2&amp;nbsp;W/m², which “is as much as 55% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; forcing and is larger than the forcing due to the other [GHGs] such as CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, CFCs, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or tropospheric ozone.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan and G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 222.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scientists estimate the total magnitude of black carbon’s forcing between + 0.2 and 1.1&amp;nbsp;W/m² with varying ranges due to uncertainties. (See Table 1.) This compares with the IPCC’s climate forcing estimates of 1.66&amp;nbsp;W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 0.48&amp;nbsp;W/m² for CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. (See Table 2.)&lt;ref&gt;IPCC, "Technical Summary", in ''Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science basis,''. Contribution of Working Group I to the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 21 (2007) ''available at'' http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg1.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, black carbon forcing is two to three times as effective in raising temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere and the Arctic than equivalent forcing values of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;James Hansen &amp; Larissa Nazarenko, ''Soot Climate Forcing Via Snow and Ice Albedos'', 101 Proc. of the Nat'l. Acad. of Sci. 423 (13 January 2004) ("The efficacy of this forcing is »2 (i.e. for a given forcing it is twice as effective as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in altering global surface air temperature)"); ''compare'' Zender Testimony, ''supra'' note 7, at 4 (figure 3); See J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko, ''supra'' note 18, at 426. ("The efficacy for changes of Arctic sea ice albedo is &gt;3. In additional runs not shown here, we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in Antarctica is also &gt;3."); ''See also'' Flanner, M.G., C.S. Zender, J.T. Randerson, and P.J. Rasch, ''Present-day climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow'', 112 J. GEOPHYS. RES. D11202 (2007) ("The forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset, triggering strong snow-albedo feedback in local springtime. Consequently, the "efficacy" of black carbon/snow forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.").&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson calculates that reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot particles would eliminate about 40% of the net observed global warming.&lt;ref&gt;Gross global warming should result in about 2&amp;nbsp;°C (4&amp;nbsp;°F) temperature rise. However, observed global warming is only about 0.8 °C because cooling particles off set much of the warming. Reducing fossil fuel and biofuel soot would reduce about 40% of the observed warming and about 16% of the gross warming.  Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 13, at 3. ("The figure also shows that fossil-fuel plus biofuel soot may contribute to about 16% of gross global warming (warming due to all greenhouse gases plus soot plus the heat island effect), but its control in isolation could reduce 40% of net global warming.").&lt;/ref&gt;  (See Figure 1.) In addition to black carbon, fossil fuel and biofuel soot contain aerosols and particulate matter that cool the planet by reflecting the sun’s radiation away from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.'' at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  When the aerosols and particulate matter are accounted for, fossil fuel and biofuel soot are increasing temperatures by about 0.35&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id''&lt;/ref&gt;

Black carbon alone is estimated to have a 20-year [[Global Warming Potential]] (GWP) of 4,470, and a 100-year GWP of 1,055–2,240.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''id.''  As an aerosol, there is not standardized formula for developing global warming potentials (GWP) for black carbon. However, attempts to derive GWP100 range from 190 – 2240 relative to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The Integrated Assessment of Black Carbon and Tropospheric Ozone published in 2011 by the United Nations Environment Programme and World Meteorological Organization calculates that cutting black carbon, along with tropospheric ozone and its precursor, methane, can reduce the rate of global warming by half and the rate of warming in the Arctic by two-thirds, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. By trimming “peak warming”, such cuts can keep current global temperature rise below 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C for 30 years and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C for 60 years, in combination with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cuts. (FN: UNEP-WMO 2011.)

The reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as well as SLCFs could keep global temperature rise under 1.5&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2030, and below 2&amp;nbsp;˚C through 2070, assuming CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is also cut.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; See the graph on page 12 of the [http://www.unep.org/dewa/Portals/67/pdf/Black_Carbon.pdf UNEP-WMO report].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

==Control technologies==
Ramanathan notes that “developed nations have reduced their black carbon emissions from fossil fuel sources by a factor of 5 or more since 1950.  Thus, the technology exists for a drastic reduction of fossil fuel related black carbon.” &lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan Testimony, ''supra'' note 4, at 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson believes that “[g]iven proper conditions and incentives, [soot] polluting technologies can be quickly phased out.  In some small-scale applications (such as domestic cooking in developing countries), health and convenience will drive such a transition when affordable, reliable alternatives are available.  For other sources, such as vehicles or coal boilers, regulatory approaches may be required to nudge either the transition to existing technology or the development of new technology.”&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

Hansen states that “technology is within reach that could greatly reduce soot, restoring snow albedo to near pristine values, while having multiple other benefits for climate, human health, agricultural productivity, and environmental aesthetics.  Already soot emissions from coal are decreasing in many regions with transition from small users to power plants with scrubbers.”&lt;ref&gt;J. Hansen &amp; L. Nazarenko,''supra'' note 14, at 428&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacobson suggests converting “[U.S.] vehicles from fossil fuel to electric, plug-in-hybrid, or hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, where the electricity or hydrogen is produced by a renewable energy source, such as wind, solar, geothermal, hydroelectric, wave, or tidal power.  Such a conversion would eliminate 160 Gg/yr (24%) of U.S. (or 1.5% of world) fossil-fuel soot and about 26% of U.S. (or 5.5% of world) carbon dioxide.”&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jacobson’s estimates, this proposal would reduce soot and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions by 1.63 GtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;–eq. per year.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson offers an estimate of total U.S. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions in 2005 of 6270 metric tonnes, 26% of which is 1630.'' Id.''&lt;/ref&gt; He notes, however, “that the elimination of hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides would also eliminate some cooling particles, reducing the net benefit by at most, half, but improving human health,” a substantial reduction for one policy in one country.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson Testimony, ''supra'' note 9, at 9&lt;/ref&gt;

For diesel vehicles in particular there are several effective technologies available.&lt;ref&gt;Manufacturers of Emission Controls Association (MECA), "Emission Control Technologies for Diesel-Powered Vehicles," 9  (December 2007) ("Diesel oxidation catalysts installed on a vehicle’s exhaust system can reduce total PM typically by as much as 25 to over 50 percent by mass, under some conditions depending on the composition of the PM being emitted"), available at:http://www.meca.org/galleries/default-file/MECA%20Diesel%20White%20Paper%2012-07-07%20final.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;  Newer, more efficient [[diesel particulate filter]]s (DPFs), or traps, can eliminate over 90% of black carbon emissions,&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', ("DPFs can achieve up to, and in some cases, greater than a 90 percent reduction in PM. High efficiency filters are extremely effective in controlling the carbon fraction of the particulate, the portion of the particulate that some health experts believe may be the PM component of greatest concern").&lt;/ref&gt; but these devices require [[ultra-low sulfur diesel]] fuel (ULSD).  To ensure compliance with new particulate rules for new on-road and non-road vehicles in the U.S., the EPA first required a nationwide shift to ULSD, which allowed DPFs to be used in diesel vehicles in order to meet the standards.  Because of recent EPA regulations, black carbon emissions from diesel vehicles are expected to decline about 70 percent from 2001 to 2020.”&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at 5, ("Mobile source black carbon emissions are estimated at 234 Gg in 2001, representing 54 percent of the nationwide black carbon emissions of 436 Gg.  Under Scenario F, mobile source emissions are projected to decline to 71 Gg, a reduction of 163 Gg."&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, “BC emissions in the United States are projected to decline by 42 percent from 2001 to 2020.&lt;ref&gt;Bahner, Mark A., Weitz, Keith A., Zapata, Alexandra and DeAngelo, Benjamin, Use of Black Carbon and Organic Carbon Inventories for Projections and Mitigation Analysis," 1, (2007) available at: http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/conference/ei16/session3/k.weitz.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the full fleet is subject to these rules, EPA estimates that over 239,000 tons of particulate matter will be reduced annually.&lt;ref&gt;EPA, Heavy-Duty Highway Diesel Program, available at: http://www.epa.gov/oms/highway-diesel/index.htm ("Once this action is fully implemented…Soot or particulate matter will be reduced by 110,000 tons a year"); EPA, Clean Air Nonroad Diesel Rule—Facts and Figures, available at: http://www.epa.gov/nonroad-diesel/2004fr/420f04037.htm ("Environmental Benefits When the Fleet of Older Nonroad Engines Has Fully Turned Over by 2030: Annual reductions of Fine PM (PM2.5): 129,000 tons").&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the US diesel oxidation catalysts are often available and DPFs will become available as ULSD is more widely commercialized.

Another technology for reducing black carbon emissions from diesel engines is to shift fuels to compressed natural gas. In [[New Delhi]], India, the [[supreme court]] ordered shift to compressed natural gas for all public transport vehicles, including buses, taxis, and rickshaws, resulted in a climate benefit, “largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines.”&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("When aerosol emissions are included, the switch to CNG fueling results in a climate benefit, largely because of the dramatic reduction of black carbon emissions from the diesel bus engines"). The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court.  ''See'' Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking'', Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, the fuel switch for the vehicles reduced black carbon emissions enough to produce a 10 percent net reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq., and perhaps as much as 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("However, when aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e)").&lt;/ref&gt; The main gains were from diesel bus engines whose CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. emissions were reduced 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;''Id.'', at Section 3.1 ("In total there is about a 10% reduction of net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions, and if buses are considered separately, net CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(e) emissions are reduced by about 20%").&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a study examining these emissions reductions, “there is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.”&lt;ref&gt;C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', 1, ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Technologies are also in development to reduce some of the 133,000 metric tons of particulate matter emitted each year from ships.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D., B. Lerner, C. Granier, T. Baynard, E. Lovejoy, P. Massoli, A. R. Ravishankara, and E. Williams, ''Light absorbing carbon emissions from commercial shipping'', 35 Geophysical Res. Letters L13815 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;  Ocean vessels use diesel engines, and particulate filters similar to those in use for land vehicles are now being tested on them.  As with current particulate filters these too would require the ships to use ULSD, but if comparable emissions reductions are attainable, up to 120,000 metric tons of particulate emissions could be eliminated each year from international shipping. That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;ref&gt;That is, if particulate filters could be shown reduce black carbon emissions 90 percent from ships as they do for land vehicles, 120,000 metric tons of today’s 133,000 metric tons of emissions would be prevented.&lt;/ref&gt; Other efforts can reduce the amount of black carbon emissions from ships simply by decreasing the amount of fuel the ships use.  By traveling at slower speeds or by using shore side electricity when at port instead of running the ship’s diesel engines for electric power, ships can save fuel and reduce emissions.

Reynolds and Kandlikar estimate that the shift to [[compressed natural gas]] for public transport in New Delhi ordered by the Supreme Court reduced climate emissions by 10 to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;Conor C. O. Reynolds &amp; Milind Kandlikar, ''Climate Impacts of Air Quality Policy: Switching to a Natural Gas-Fueled Public Transportation System in New Delhi'', ENVIRON. SCI. TECHNOL. (forthcoming 2008) ("Between 2001 and 2003, public transport vehicles in New Delhi were required to switch their fuel to natural gas in an attempt to reduce their air pollution impacts. …[W]hen [black carbon and other] aerosol emissions are taken into account in our model, the net effect of the switch is estimated to be a 10% reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (eq), and there may be as much as a 30% reduction…. There is a significant potential for emissions reductions through the [UNFCCC] Clean Development for such fuel switching projects.") The fuel switching policy was implemented with the aid of the Indian Supreme Court. See Urvashi Narain and Ruth Greenspan Bell, ''Who Changed Delhi’s Air? The Roles of the Court and the Executive in Environmental Policymaking,'' Resources for the Future Discussion Paper 05-48 (December 2005) http://www.rff.org/rff/documents/rff-dp-05-48.pdf ("[T]he main role of the Supreme Court was to force the government to implement previously announced policies. … [T]he Delhi experience for instituting change has become a model for other Indian cities as well as neighboring countries.")&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramanathan estimates that “providing alternative energy-efficient and smoke-free cookers and introducing transferring technology for reducing soot emissions from coal combustion in small industries could have major impacts on the radiative forcing due to soot.” &lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''supra'' note 4, at 226.&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically, the impact of replacing biofuel cooking with black carbon-free cookers (solar, bio, and natural gas) in South and East Asia is dramatic: over South Asia, a 70 to 80% reduction in black carbon heating; and in East Asia, a 20 to 40% reduction.”&lt;ref&gt;V. Ramanathan &amp; G. Carmichael, ''id.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biodegradation ==

Condensed aromatic ring structures indicate black carbon degradation in soil. [[Saprophytic fungi]] are being researched for their potential role in the degradation of black carbon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Direct molecular evidence for the degradation and mobility of black carbon in soils from ultrahigh-resolution mass spectral analysis of dissolved organic matter from a fire-impacted forest|journal=Organic Chemistry soil|year=2006|author1=Hockaday WC|author2=Grannas AM|author3=Kim S,|author4=Hatcher PG|volume=37|issue=4|pages=501–510|doi=10.1016/j.orggeochem.2005.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy options==
Many countries have existing national laws to regulate black carbon emissions, including laws that address particulate emissions.  Some examples include:

*banning or regulating slash-and-burn clearing of forests and savannas;
*requiring shore-based power/electrification of ships at port, regulating idling at terminals, and mandating fuel standards for ships seeking to dock at port;
*requiring regular vehicle emissions tests, retirement, or retrofitting (e.g. adding particulate traps&lt;ref&gt;O. Boucher and M.S. Reddy, ''Climate trade-off between black carbon and carbon dioxide emissions'', 36 [[Energy Policy (journal)|ENERGY POLICY]] 193, 196-198 (2007) (Particulate traps on diesel engines reduce black carbon emissions and associated climate forcing but are partially offset by an increase in fuel consumption and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Where the fuel penalty is 2-3%, black carbon reductions will produce positive benefits for the climate for the first 28-68 years, assuming reduction in black carbon emission is 0.150.30 g/mile, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions are 15002000 g/mile, and a 100-year GWP of 680 is used for black carbon. The net positive benefits for climate will continue for up to centuries in northern regions because of black carbon's effect on snow and ice albedo).&lt;/ref&gt;), including penalties for failing to meet air quality emissions standards, and heightened penalties for on-the-road "super-emitting" vehicles;
*banning or regulating the sale of certain fuels and/or requiring the use of cleaner fuels for certain uses;
*limiting the use of chimneys and other forms of biomass burning in urban and non-urban areas;
*requiring permits to operate industrial, power generating, and oil refining facilities and periodic permit renewal and/or modification of equipment; and
*requiring filtering technology and high-temperature combustion (e.g. [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] coal) for existing power generation plants, and regulating annual emissions from power generation plants.

The International Network for Environmental Compliance &amp; Enforcement issued a Climate Compliance Alert on Black Carbon in 2008 which cited reduction of [[carbon black]] as a cost-effective way to reduce a major cause of global warming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inece.org/climate/INECEClimateComplianceAlert_BlackCarbon.pdf "Jump-Starting Climate Protection: INECE Targets Compliance with Laws Controlling Black Carbon"] analysis by [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]], June 12, 2008, accessed April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
The ionic lattice is modeled as an assembly of hard elastic spheres which are compressed together by the mutual attraction of the electrostatic charges on the ions. They achieve the observed equilibrium distance apart due to a balancing short range repulsion.

===Electrostatic potential===
The electrostatic potential energy, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;pair&lt;/sub&gt;, between a pair of ions of equal and opposite charge is:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{pair} = -\frac{z^2 e^2 }{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''z'' = magnitude of charge on one ion
:''e'' = elementary charge, 1.6022{{e|&amp;minus;19}} [[coulomb|C]]
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = [[permittivity of free space]]
::4{{pi}}''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.112{{e|&amp;minus;10}} C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/(J·m)
:''r'' = distance separating the ion centers

For a simple lattice consisting ions with equal and opposite charge in a 1:1 ratio, interactions between one ion and all other lattice ions need to be summed to calculate ''E''&lt;sub&gt;M&lt;/sub&gt;, sometimes called the [[Erwin Madelung|Madelung]] or lattice energy:

:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{M} = -\frac{z^2 e^2 M}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''M'' = [[Madelung constant]], which is related to the geometry of the crystal
:''r'' = closest distance between two ions of opposite charge

===Repulsive term===
Born and Lande suggested that a repulsive interaction between the lattice ions would be proportional to {{sfrac|1|''r{{isup|n}}''}} so that the repulsive energy term, ''E''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;, would be expressed:
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{R} = \frac{B}{r^n}&lt;/math&gt;
where
:''B'' = constant scaling the strength of the repulsive interaction
:''r'' = closest distance between two ions of opposite charge
:''n'' = Born exponent, a number between 5 and 12 expressing the steepness of the repulsive barrier

===Total energy===
The total intensive potential energy of an ion in the lattice can therefore be expressed as the sum of the Madelung and repulsive potentials:

:&lt;math&gt;E(r) = -\frac{z^2 e^2 M}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r} + \frac{B}{r^n}&lt;/math&gt;

Minimizing this energy with respect to ''r'' yields the equilibrium separation ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the unknown constant ''B'':

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}E}{\mathrm{d}r} &amp;= \frac{z^2 e^2 M}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r^2} - \frac{n B}{r^{n+1}} \\
0 &amp;= \frac{z^2 e^2 M}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_0^2} - \frac{n B}{r_0^{n+1}} \\
r_0 &amp;= \left( \frac{4 \pi \epsilon_0 n B}{z^2 e^2 M}\right) ^\frac{1}{n-1} \\
B &amp;= \frac{z^2 e^2 M}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 n} r_0^{n-1}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Evaluating the minimum intensive potential energy and substituting the expression for ''B'' in terms of ''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; yields the Born–Landé equation:

:&lt;math&gt;E(r_0) = - \frac{M z^2 e^2 }{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r_0}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

==Calculated lattice energies==

The '''[[David A. Johnston]] Cascades Volcano Observatory''' (CVO) is a [[volcano observatory]] that monitors volcanoes in the northern [[Cascade Range]]. It was established in the summer of 1980, after the eruption of [[Mount St. Helens]].&lt;ref name="MONITOR"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vzKE9HDdQRUC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=cvo+vancouver+1980&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=eM1IBiDS09&amp;sig=Y0QV_b6LhxNAAy4w8Yl6n7qxoIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi-gJPq-P3aAhWSON8KHY6dAhcQ6AEwCnoECAAQZQ#v=onepage&amp;q=cvo%20vancouver%201980&amp;f=false Google Books, ''Monitoring Volcanoes: Techniques and Strategies Used by the Staff of the Cascades Volcano Observatory, 1980-90'', Editors - John W. Ewert and Donald A.

The Cascade Range's extent includes northern [[California]], and Cascade volcanoes in that state, such as [[Mount Shasta]] and [[Lassen Peak]], previously fell under the CVO's jurisdiction. However, these volcanoes now fall under the jurisdiction of the [[California Volcano Observatory]] (CalVO), formed in February 2012 and based in [[Menlo Park, California]], which monitors and researches volcanic activity throughout California and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klemetti|first=Erik|title=Meet the USGS's Newest Volcano Observatory: CalVO|url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/02/meet-the-usgss-newest-volcano-observatory-calvo/|work=Eruptions|publisher=Wired.com|accessdate=11 February 2012|date=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cascades Volcano Observatory is part of the [[United States Geological Survey]], a scientific agency of the [[United States government]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wovo.org/1201.html WOVO.org: World Organization of Volcano Observatories]&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in [[Vancouver, Washington]] in the [[Portland, Oregon]] metropolitan area.

The '''Chon Aike Formation''' is an extensive geological formation, present in the [[Deseado Massif]] in north-central [[Santa Cruz Province, Argentina|Santa Cruz Province]], [[Patagonia]], Argentina. It covers an area of approximately {{convert|100000|km2}} and consists of [[rhyolitic]] volcanic rocks, particularly [[ignimbrite]]s and [[lava]]s, with smaller amounts of [[agglomerate]]s and [[tuff]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Channing|Zamuner|Zúñiga|2007|loc=Regional geological setting, pp. 401–402}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[dacite|dacitic]] rocks, plant fossils have been found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fossilworks.org/bridge.pl?a=collectionSearch&amp;collection_no=29375 Estancia Bajo Pellegrini] at [[Fossilworks]].org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
The Chon Aike Formation forms part of the Chon Aike Province, also known as the Tobífera Series, a [[large igneous province]] that covers {{convert|1700000|km2|sqmi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sruoga|Rubinstein|Hinterwimmer|2004|loc=Geological setting, pp. 32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The northern part of the formation, Río Pinturas, has been dated to the Late Jurassic (140–160&amp;nbsp;{{Abbr|Ma|Million years ago}}), while the western and eastern sections have been dated to 162&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;11&amp;nbsp;Ma and 168&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;2&amp;nbsp;Ma respectively, indicating Middle Jurassic eruptions. Fossil flora, however, suggests a Middle to Late Jurassic age. (See [[La Matilde Formation]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pankhurst|Leat|Sruoga|Rapela|1998|loc=Chon Aike Formation, pp. 118–119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the break-up of [[Gondwana]] around 180–165&amp;nbsp;Ma, the opening of the [[Weddell Sea]] lead to [[Extension (geology)|extension]] along the western margin of the [[South American Plate]], resulting in intra-plate volcanism in the Chon Aike area and rifting in the [[Magallanes Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Franzese|Spalletti|Pérez|Macdonald|2003|loc=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Chon Aike volcanism was probably related to the subduction of the Pacific [[Phoenix Plate|Phoenix]] and [[Farallon Plate|Farallon]] plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Torsvik|Rousse|Labails|Smethurst|2009|loc=6.1 Jurassic reconstructions (180 and 150 Ma), p. 1325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemistry]] and [[physics]] are branches of [[science]] that both study [[matter]]. The difference between the two lies in their scope and approach. Chemists and physicists are trained differently, and they have different professional roles, even when working in a team. The division between chemistry and physics becomes diffuse at the interface of the two branches, notably in fields such as [[physical chemistry]], [[chemical physics]], [[quantum mechanics]], [[nuclear physics]]/[[Nuclear chemistry|chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[spectroscopy]], [[solid state physics]], [[solid-state chemistry]], [[crystallography]], and [[nanotechnology]].

== Scope ==
Physics and chemistry may overlap when the system under study involves matter composed of electrons and nuclei made of protons and neutrons. On the other hand, chemistry is not concerned with other forms of matter such as [[quarks]], [[Mu lepton|mu]] and [[tau lepton]]s and [[dark matter]].

Although fundamental laws that govern the behavior of matter apply both in chemistry and physics, the disciplines of physics and chemistry are distinct. Physics is concerned with nature from a very large scale (the entire universe) down to a very small scale ([[subatomic particles]]). All physical phenomena that are measurable follow some behavior that is in accordance with the most basic principles studied in physics.&lt;ref name=APS /&gt;&lt;ref name=IOP /&gt;

Physics is involved with the fundamental principles of physical phenomena and the basic forces of nature, and also gives insight into the aspects of space and time. Physics also deals with the basic principles that explain matter and energy, and may study aspects of atomic matter by following concepts derived from the most fundamental principles.

Chemistry focuses on how substances interact with each other and with energy (for example heat and light).&lt;ref name=IUPAC /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACS /&gt; The study of change of matter ([[chemical reactions]]) and [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] lies at the heart of chemistry, and gives rise to concepts such as [[Organic chemistry|organic]] [[functional group]]s and rate laws for chemical reactions. Chemistry also studies the properties of matter at a larger scale (for example, [[astrochemistry]]) and the reactions of matter at a larger scale (for example, technical chemistry), but typically, explanations and predictions are related back to the underlying atomic structure, giving more emphasis on the methods for the identification of molecules and their mechanisms of transformation than any other science.

== Approach ==
Although both physics and chemistry are concerned with matter and its interaction with energy, the two disciplines differ in approach. In physics, it is typical to abstract from the specific type of matter, and to focus on the common properties of many different materials.&lt;ref name=PhysApproach /&gt;&lt;ref name=PhysThinking /&gt;  In [[optics]], for example, materials are characterized by their [[index of refraction]], and materials with the same index of refraction will have identical properties. Chemistry, on the other hand, focuses on what compounds are present in a sample, and explores how changing the [[Chemical structure|structure]] of molecules will change their reactivity and their physical properties.&lt;ref name=ChemThinking /&gt;

The two sciences differ in the role that theory plays within the discipline. Physics can be divided into experimental and [[theoretical physics]]. Historically, theoretical physics has correctly predicted phenomena that were out of experimental reach at the time, and could be verified only after experimental techniques caught up.&lt;ref name=PhysTheory /&gt;  In chemistry, the role of theory historically has been a retrospective one, summarizing experimental data and predicting the outcome of similar experiments.&lt;ref name=ChemTheory /&gt;  However, with the increasing power of computational methods in chemistry, it has become possible to predict whether a hypothetical compound is stable or not before experimental data is available.

== Training ==
In a typical undergraduate program for physics majors, required courses are in the sub-disciplines of physics, with additional required courses in mathematics. Because much of the insight of physics is described by [[differential equations]] relating matter, space, and time (for example [[Newton's law of motion]] and the [[Maxwell equations]] of [[electromagnetism]]), students have to be familiar with differential equations. In a typical undergraduate program for chemistry majors, emphasis is placed on laboratory classes and understanding and applying models describing [[chemical bond]]s and [[molecular structure]]. Emphasis is also placed in the methods for analysis and the formulas and equations used when considering the chemical transformation. Students take courses in math, physics, chemistry, and often [[biochemistry]]. Between the two programs of study, there is a large area of overlap ([[calculus]], introductory physics, [[quantum mechanics]], [[thermodynamics]]). However, physics places a larger emphasis on fundamental theory (with its deep mathematical treatment) while chemistry places more emphasis in combining the most important mathematical definitions of the theory with the approach of the molecular models. [[Laboratory]] skills may differ in both programs, as students may be involved in different technologies, depending on the program and the institution of higher education (for example, a chemistry student may spend more laboratory time dealing with [[Laboratory glassware|glassware]] for [[distillation]] and purification or on a form of [[chromatography]]-[[spectroscopy]] instrument, while a physics student may spend much more time dealing with a [[laser]] and non-linear optics technology or some complex electrical circuit).

== Careers in chemistry and physics ==
According to Bureau of Labor Statistics (United States Department of Labor), there are 80,000 [[chemist]]s and 17,000 [[physicist]]s working in the United States as of May 2010.&lt;ref name=LaborStats /&gt;  In addition, 21,000 chemists and 13,500 physicists teach in high school. Chemistry is the only science that has an entire industry, the [[chemical industry]], named after it, and many chemists work in this industry, in [[research and development]], production, training, or management. Other industries employing chemists include the [[Petroleum industry|petroleum]], pharmaceutical, and food industry. While there is no industry named after physics, many industries have grown out of physics research, most notably the [[semiconductor]] and [[electronics industry]]. Physicists are also employed outside of science, for example in finance, because of their training in modeling complex systems.&lt;ref name=CareersNonScience /&gt;

== Topics at the interface of chemistry and physics ==
Chemistry and physics are not strictly separated sciences, and chemists and physicists work in interdisciplinary teams to explore the following topics.
* [[Quantum chemistry]]
* [[Spectroscopy]]
* [[Thermodynamics]]
* [[Material science]] or [[Materials engineering]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1955">In [[geochemistry]], '''compatibility''' is a measure of how readily a particular [[trace element]] substitutes for a [[major element]] within a [[mineral]].  

Compatibility of an [[ion]] is controlled by two things: its [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] and its [[ionic radius]].  Both must approximate those of the major element for the trace element to be compatible in the mineral.  For instance, [[olivine]] (an abundant mineral in the upper [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]]) has the chemical formula (Mg,Fe)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. [[Nickel]], with very similar chemical behaviour to [[iron]] and [[magnesium]], substitutes readily for them and hence is very compatible in the mantle.  The compatibility of an element in a [[Rock geology|rock]] is a [[weighted mean|weighted average]] of its compatibility in each of the minerals present.  By contrast, an incompatible element is one that is least stable within its [[crystal]] structure.

Compatibility controls the partitioning of different elements during [[melting]].  If an element is incompatible in a rock, it partitions into a [[magma|melt]] as soon as melting begins.

In general, when an element is referred to as being “compatible” without mentioning what rock it is compatible in, the mantle is implied.  Thus incompatible elements are those that are enriched in the [[continental crust]] and depleted in the mantle.  Examples include: [[rubidium]], [[barium]], [[uranium]], and [[lanthanum]].  Compatible elements are depleted in the crust and enriched in the mantle, with examples nickel and [[titanium]].

{{Ancient Roman religion}}

'''Diana''' (Classical Latin: {{IPA-la|dɪˈaːna|}}) is a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[goddess]] of the [[hunting|hunt]], the [[moon]], and [[nature]], associated with wild animals and woodland. She is [[Syncretism|equated]] with the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]], who absorbed much of Artemis' mythology early in Roman history, including a birth on the island of [[Delos]] to parents [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] and [[Latona]], and a twin brother, [[Apollo]],&lt;ref name=Lar&gt;''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', [[The Book People]], Haydock, 1995, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; though she had [[Diana Nemorensis|an independent origin in Italy]].

Diana was known as the virgin goddess of childbirth and women. She was one of the three maiden goddesses, along with [[Minerva (mythology)|Minerva]] and [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], who swore never to marry. [[Oak]] groves and deer were especially sacred to her. Diana made up a triad with two other Roman deities; [[Egeria (mythology)|Egeria]] the water nymph, her servant and assistant midwife; and [[Virbius]], the woodland god.&lt;ref&gt;''The Clay-footed Superheroes: Mythology Tales for the New Millennium'' {{ISBN|978-0-865-16719-3}} p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana is revered in modern [[Neopagan]] religions including [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman Neopaganism]], [[Stregheria]], and [[Wicca]]. From the medieval to the modern period, as folklore attached to her developed and was eventually adapted into neopagan religions, the mythology surrounding Diana grew to include a consort ([[Lucifer]]) and daughter ([[Aradia]]), figures sometimes recognized by modern traditions.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt; In the ancient, medieval, and modern periods, Diana has been considered a [[triple deity]], merged with a goddess of the moon ([[Luna (goddess)|Luna]]/[[Selene]]) and the underworld (usually [[Hecate]]).&lt;ref name=servius/&gt;&lt;ref name=diana_religion&gt;Green, C.M.C. (2007). ''Roman Religion and the Cult of Diana at Aricia''. New York: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Diana (pronounced with long 'ī' and 'ā') is an adjectival form developed from an ancient [[Asterisk (historical linguistics)|*]]''divios'', corresponding to later 'divus', 'dius', as in [[Dius Fidius]], [[Dea Dia]] and in the neuter form ''dium'' meaning the sky.&lt;ref&gt;G.Dumézil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 3, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
It is derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*d(e)y(e)w'', meaning "bright sky" or "daylight"; the same word is also the root behind the name of the Aryan   [[Vedic]] sky god [[Dyaus]], as well as the Latin words [[deus]] (god), ''dies'' (day, daylight), and "diurnal" (daytime).

On the [[Linear B|Tablets of Pylos]] a theonym διϝια (''diwia'') is supposed as referring to a deity precursor of Artemis. Modern scholars mostly accept the identification.&lt;ref&gt;H. F. Pairault below cites three. Contrary G. Rousseau.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Request quotation|date=April 2013}}

The ancient Latin writers [[Varro]] and [[Cicero]] considered the etymology of Dīāna as allied to that of ''dies'' and connected to the shine of the Moon.

{{Quote box
 |quote  = ... people regard Diana and the moon as one and the same. ... the moon ''(luna)'' is so called from the verb to shine ''(lucere)''. Lucina is identified with it, which is why in our country they invoke Juno Lucina in childbirth, just as the Greeks call on Diana the Light-bearer. Diana also has the name ''Omnivaga'' ("wandering everywhere"), not because of her hunting but because she is numbered as one of the seven planets; her name Diana derives from the fact that she turns darkness into daylight ''(dies)''. She is invoked at childbirth because children are born occasionally after seven, or usually after nine, lunar revolutions ...

==Description==
[[File:Seignac, Diane chassant (5613442047).jpg|thumb|left|''Diana Hunting'', [[Guillaume Seignac]]]]
The persona of Diana is complex, and contains a number of archaic features. Diana was originally considered to be a goddess of the wilderness and of the hunt, a central sport in both Roman and Greek culture.&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries/&gt; Early Roman inscriptions to Diana celebrated her primarily as a huntress and patron of hunters. Later, in the Hellenistic period, Diana came to be equally or more revered as a goddess not of the wild woodland but of the "tame" countryside, or ''[[villa rustica]]'', the idealization of which was common in Greek thought and poetry. This dual role as goddess of both civilization and the wild, and therefore the civilized countryside, first applied to the Greek goddess [[Artemis]] (for example, in the 3rd century BCE poetry of [[Anacreon]]).&lt;ref name=roman_lyric/&gt; By the 3rd century CE, after Greek influence had a profound impact on Roman religion, Diana had been almost fully combined with Artemis and took on many of her attributes, both in her spiritual domains and in the description of her appearance. The Roman poet [[Nemesianus]] wrote a typical description of Diana: She carried a bow and a quiver full of golden arrows, wore a golden cloak, purple half-boots, and a belt with a jeweled buckle to hold her tunic together, and wore her hair gathered in a ribbon.&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries/&gt;

===As a triple goddess===
Diana was often considered an aspect of a [[triple deity|triple goddess]], known as ''Diana triformis'': Diana, [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]], and [[Hecate]]. According to historian C.M. Green, "these were neither different goddesses nor an amalgamation of different goddesses. They were Diana...Diana as huntress, Diana as the moon, Diana of the underworld."&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; At her [[sacred grove]] on the shores of Lake Nemi, Diana was venerated as a triple goddess beginning in the late 6th century BCE.

[[Andreas Alföldi]] interpreted an image on a late Republican coin as the Latin Diana "conceived as a threefold unity of the divine huntress, the Moon goddess and the goddess of the nether world, [[Hekate]]".&lt;ref&gt;Alföldi, "Diana Nemorensis", ''American Journal of Archaeology'' (1960:137-44) p 141.&lt;/ref&gt; This coin, minted by P. Accoleius Lariscolus in 43 BCE, has been acknowledged as representing an archaic statue of Diana Nemorensis.&lt;ref name=alfoldi&gt;A. Alföldi"Diana Nemorensis" in ''American journal of Archaeology'' '''64''' 1960 p. 137-144.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents Artemis with the bow at one extremity, Luna-Selene with flowers at the other and a central deity not immediately identifiable, all united by a horizontal bar. The iconographical analysis allows the dating of this image to the 6th century at which time there are Etruscan models. The coin shows that the triple goddess cult image still stood in the ''lucus'' of Nemi in 43 BCE. Lake Nemi was called ''Triviae lacus'' by Virgil (''Aeneid'' 7.516), while [[Horace]] called Diana ''montium custos nemoremque virgo'' ("keeper of the mountains and virgin of Nemi") and ''diva triformis'' ("three-form goddess").&lt;ref&gt;Horace, ''Carmina'' 3.22.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two heads found in the sanctuary&lt;ref&gt;Excavation of 1791 by cardinal Despuig not mentioned in the report: cf. P. Riis who cites E. Lucidi ''Memorie storiche dell'antichissimo municipio ora terra dell'Ariccia e delle sue colonie Genzano e Nemi'' Rome 1796 p. 97 ff. finds at ''Valle Giardino''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Roman theatre at Nemi, which have a hollow on their back, lend support to this interpretation of an archaic triple Diana. &lt;ref&gt;NSA 1931 p. 259-261 platesVI a-b.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===As goddess of crossroads and the underworld===
The earliest epithet of Diana was ''Trivia'', and she was addressed with that title by Virgil,&lt;ref&gt;''Aeneid'' 6.35, 10.537.&lt;/ref&gt; Catullus,&lt;ref&gt;''Carmina'' 34.14 ''tu potens Trivia''...&lt;/ref&gt; and many others. "Trivia" comes from the Latin ''trivium'', "triple way", and refers to Diana's guardianship over roadways, particularly Y-junctions or three-way crossroads. This role carried a somewhat dark and dangerous connotation, as it metaphorically pointed the way to the underworld.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; In the 1st-century CE play ''[[Medea (Seneca)|Medea]]'', [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca's]] title character calls on Trivia to cast a spell, evokes the triple goddess of Diana, Selene, and Hecate, and specifies that she requires the powers of the latter.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; The symbol of the crossroads is relevant to several aspects of Diana's domain. It can symbolize the paths hunters may encounter in the forest, lit only by the full moon; this symbolizes making choices "in the dark" without the light of guidance.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

Diana's role as a goddess of the underworld, or at least of ushering people between life and death, caused her early on to be conflated with [[Hecate]] (and occasionally also with [[Proserpina]]). However, her role as an underworld goddess appears to pre-date strong Greek influence (though the early Greek colony of [[Cumae]] had a cult of Hekate and certainly had contacts with the Latins&lt;ref&gt;Dionysius Hal. VII 6, 4: the people of Aricia help Aristdemos in bringing home the Etruscan booty.&lt;/ref&gt;). A theater in her sanctuary at Lake Nemi included a pit and tunnel that would have allowed actors to easily descend on one side of the stage and ascend on the other, indicating a connection between the phases of the moon and a descent by the moon goddess into the underworld.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; It is likely that her underworld aspect in her original Latin worship did not have a distinct name, like Luna was for her moon aspect. This is due to a seeming reluctance or taboo by the early Latins to name underworld deities, and the fact that they believed the underworld to be silent, precluding naming. Hekate, a Greek goddess also associated with the boundary between the earth and the underworld, became attached to Diana as a name for her underworld aspect following Greek influence.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

===As goddess of childbirth===
Diana was often considered to be a goddess associated with fertility and childbirth, and the protection of women during labor. This probably arose as an extension of her association with the moon, whose cycles were believed to parallel the menstrual cycle, and which was used to track the months during pregnancy.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; At her shrine in Aricia, worshipers left votive terracotta offerings were left for the goddess in the shapes of babies and wombs, and the temple there also offered care of pups and pregnant dogs. This care of infants also extended to the training of both young people and dogs, especially for hunting.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt; In her role as a protector of childbirth, Diana was called ''Diana [[Lucina (mythology)|Lucina]]'' or even ''[[Juno Lucina]]'', because her domain overlapped with that of the goddess Juno. The title of Juno may also have had an independent origin as it applied to Diana, with the literal meaning of "helper" - Diana as ''Juno Lucina'' would be the "helper of childbirth".&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

===As a "frame god"===
[[File:Mengs, Diana als Personifikation der Nacht.jpg|thumb|left|''Diana as Personification of the Night''. [[Anton Raphael Mengs]], c. 1765.]]
According to a theory proposed by [[Georges Dumézil]], Diana falls into a particular subset of celestial gods, referred to in histories of religion as ''frame gods''. Such gods, while keeping the original features of celestial divinities (i.e. transcendent heavenly power and abstention from direct rule in worldly matters), did not share the fate of other celestial gods in Indoeuropean religions - that of becoming ''dei otiosi'', or gods without practical purpose,&lt;ref&gt;Mircea Eliade ''Tre' d'histoire des religionsait'' Paris, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; since they did retain a particular sort of influence over the world and mankind.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumezil ''La religion Romaine archaique'' Paris 1974, part 3, chap.1.&lt;/ref&gt; The celestial character of Diana is reflected in her connection with inaccessibility, virginity, light, and her preference for dwelling on high mountains and in sacred woods. Diana, therefore, reflects the heavenly world in its sovereignty, supremacy, impassibility, and indifference towards such secular matters as the fates of mortals and states. At the same time, however, she is seen as active in ensuring the succession of kings and in the preservation of humankind through the protection of childbirth.&lt;ref name="Artemis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Artemis|url=http://www.greekmythology.com/Olympians/Artemis/artemis.html|accessdate=2012-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; These functions are apparent in the traditional institutions and cults related to the goddess:
# The institution of the [[rex Nemorensis]], Diana's ''sacerdos'' (priest) in the Arician wood, who held the position until someone else challenged and killed him in a duel, after breaking a branch from a certain tree of the wood. This ever open succession reveals the character and mission of the goddess as a guarantor of kingly status through successive generations.&lt;ref name="OvidFasti"&gt;Ovid ''Fasti'' III, 262-271.&lt;/ref&gt; Her function as bestower of authority to rule is also attested in the story related by Livy in which a Sabine man who sacrifices a [[:wikt:heifer|heifer]] to Diana wins for his country the seat of the Roman empire.&lt;ref&gt;[[Titus Livius]] ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab Urbe Condita]]'' 1:31-1:60.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Diana was also worshiped by women who wanted to be pregnant or who, once pregnant, prayed for an easy delivery. This form of worship is attested in archaeological finds of votive statuettes in her sanctuary in the [[nemus Aricinum]] as well as in ancient sources, e.g. Ovid.&lt;ref name="OvidFasti" /&gt;

According to Dumezil, the forerunner of all ''frame gods'' is an Indian epic hero who was the image ([[avatar]]) of the Vedic god Dyaus. Having renounced the world, in his roles of father and king, he attained the status of an immortal being while retaining the duty of ensuring that his dynasty is preserved and that there is always a new king for each generation. The Scandinavian god [[Heimdallr]] performs an analogous function: he is born first and will die last. He too gives origin to kingship and the first king, bestowing on him regal prerogatives.
Diana, although a female deity, has exactly the same functions, preserving mankind through childbirth and royal succession.

F. H. Pairault, in her essay on Diana, qualified Dumézil's theory as "''impossible to verify''".

==Worship==
[[File:Scene of sacrifice in honour of Diana. Fresco from the triclinium of House of the Vettii in Pompeii.jpg|thumb|An ancient [[Pompeian Styles|Fourth-Pompeian-Style]] [[Roman art|Roman wall painting]] depicting a scene of sacrifice in honor of the [[goddess Diana]]; she is seen here accompanied by a deer. The fresco was discovered in the [[triclinium]] of [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]], Italy.]]
Diana was an ancient goddess common to all Latin tribes. Therefore, many sanctuaries were dedicated to her in the lands inhabited by Latins. Her primary sanctuary was a woodland grove overlooking [[Lake Nemi]], a body of water also known as "Diana's Mirror", where she was worshiped as [[Diana Nemorensis]], or "Diana of the Wood". In Rome, the cult of Diana may have been almost as old as the city itself. Varro mentions her in the list of deities to whom king [[Titus Tatius]] promised to build a shrine. His list included Luna and Diana Lucina as separate entities. Another testimony to the antiquity of her cult is to be found in the ''lex regia'' of King [[Tullus Hostilius]] that condemns those guilty of incest to the ''sacratio'' to Diana. She had a temple in Rome on the [[Aventine Hill]], according to tradition dedicated by king [[Servius Tullius]]. Its location is remarkable as the Aventine is situated outside the [[pomerium]], i.e. original territory of the city, in order to comply with the tradition that Diana was a goddess common to all Latins and not exclusively of the Romans. Being placed on the Aventine, and thus outside the ''[[pomerium]]'', meant that Diana's cult essentially remained a ''foreign'' one, like that of [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]; she was never officially ''transferred'' to Rome as [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] was after the sack of [[Veii]].

Other known sanctuaries and temples to Diana include Colle di Corne near [[Tusculum]],&lt;ref&gt;Pliny the Elder ''Naturalis Historia'' XVI, 242.&lt;/ref&gt; where she is referred to with the archaic Latin name of ''deva Cornisca'' and where existed a [[collegium]] of worshippers;&lt;ref&gt;CIL, 975; CIL XIV,2633.&lt;/ref&gt; at Évora, Portugal;&lt;ref&gt;Hifler, Joyce.

===Sanctuary at Lake Nemi===
{{main|Diana Nemorensis}}
[[File:John Robert Cozens 002.jpg|thumb|left|An 18th-century depiction of Lake Nemi as painted by [[John Robert Cozens]]]]
Diana's worship may have originated at an open-air sanctuary overlooking [[Lake Nemi]] in the [[Alban Hills]] near [[Ariccia|Aricia]], where she was worshiped as [[Diana Nemorensis]], or ("Diana of the Sylvan Glade").&lt;ref name=forest_folklore&gt;Porteous, A. (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=ZtUoAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=nemoralia+diana&amp;ots=zUXaHlBhDY&amp;sig=gscYt4kIpjEeeMy5VF0Sym3Ee1s#v=onepage&amp;q=nemoralia%20&amp;f=false The Forest in Folklore and Mythology]''. Courier Corporation. {{ISBN|0486420108}}, 9780486420103&lt;/ref&gt; According to legendary accounts, the sanctuary was founded by [[Orestes]] and [[Iphigenia]] after they fled from the [[Tauri]]. In this tradition, the Nemi sanctuary was supposedly built on the pattern of an earlier Temple of Artemis Tauropolos,&lt;ref name=carlsen&gt;Carlsen, J. (2009).

Her cult there was first attested in Latin literature by [[Cato the Elder]], in a surviving quote by the late grammarian [[Priscian]].&lt;ref&gt;Supposed Greek origins for the Aricia cult are strictly a literary ''[[topos]]''. (Gordon 1932:178 note, and p. 181).&lt;/ref&gt; By the 4th century BCE, the simple shrine at Nemi had been joined by a temple complex.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; The sanctuary served an important political role as it was held in common by the [[Latin League]].&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxliv"&gt;''commune Latinorum Dianae templum'' in [[Varro]], ''Lingua Latina'' V.43; the cult there was of ''antiqua religione'' in [[Pliny's Natural History]], xliv. 91, 242 and [[Ovid's Fasti]] III 327–331.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poulsen&gt;Poulsen, B.

Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legend has it that Diana's high priest at Nemi, known as the [[Rex Nemorensis]], was always an escaped slave who could only obtain the position by defeating his predecessor in a fight to the death.&lt;ref name=forest_folklore/&gt; Sir [[James George Frazer]] wrote of this sacred grove in ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', basing his interpretation on brief remarks in [[Strabo]] (5.3.12), [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2,27.24) and [[Servius]]' commentary on the ''[[Aeneid]]'' (6.136). Legend tells of a tree that stood in the center of the grove and was heavily guarded. No one was allowed to break off its limbs, with the exception of a runaway slave, who was allowed, if he could, to break off one of the boughs. He was then in turn granted the privilege to engage the Rex Nemorensis, the current king and priest of Diana, in a fight to the death. If the slave prevailed, he became the next king for as long as he could defeat his challengers. However, [[Joseph Fontenrose]] criticised Frazer's assumption that a rite of this sort actually occurred at the sanctuary. &lt;ref&gt;Fontenrose, J. (1966). ''The Ritual Theory of Myth''. University of California Press, ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

A festival to Diana, the [[Nemoralia]], was held yearly at Nemi on the Ides of August (August 13-15&lt;ref&gt;The date coincides with the founding dates celebrated at Aricium. Arthur E. Gordon, "On the Origin of Diana", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''63''' (1932, pp. 177-192) p 178.&lt;/ref&gt;). Worshipers traveled to Nemi carrying torches and garlands, and once at the lake, they left pieces of thread tied to fences and tablets inscribed with prayers.&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, Fasti, trans. James George Frazer, Loeb Classical Library (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1931), 3:259-275.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anguelova, V. N. (2011). The Sound of Silence: Sacred Place in Byzantine and Post-Byzantine Devotional Art.&lt;/ref&gt; Diana's festival eventually became widely celebrated throughout Italy, which was unusual given the provincial nature of Diana's cult. The poet [[Statius]] wrote of the festival:&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;
:''"It is the season when the most scorching region of the heavens takes over the land and the keen dog-star Sirius, so often struck by Hyperion's sun, burns the gasping fields. Now is the day when Trivia's Arician grove, convenient for fugitive kings, grows smoky, and the lake, having guilty knowledge of Hippolytus, glitters with the reflection of a multitude of torches; Diana herself garlands the deserving hunting dogs and polishes the arrowheads and allows the wild animals to go in safety, and at virtuous hearths all Italy celebrates the Hecatean Ides."'' (Statius ''Silv.'' 3.I.52-60)

Statius describes the triple nature of the goddess by invoking heavenly (the stars), earthly (the grove itself) and underworld (Hecate) imagery. He also suggests by the garlanding of the dogs and polishing of the spears that no hunting was allowed during the festival.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

===Spread and conflation with Artemis===
[[File:Ipogeo di via livenza, diana cacciatrice.jpg|thumb|A Roman fresco depicting Diana hunting, 4th century AD, from the Via Livenza hypogeum in Rome.]]
Rome hoped to unify into and control the Latin tribes around Nemi,&lt;ref name="autogeneratedxliv"/&gt; so Diana's worship was imported to Rome as a show of political solidarity. Diana soon afterwards became Hellenized, and combined with the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] [[Artemis]], "a process which culminated with the appearance of Diana beside Apollo [the brother of Artemis] in the first ''[[lectisternium]]'' at Rome" in 399 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1932:179.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of identification between the two goddesses probably began when artists who were commissioned to create new cult statues for Diana's temples outside Nemi were struck by the similar attributes between Diana and the more familiar Artemis, and sculpted Diana in a manner inspired by previous depictions of Artemis. Sibyllene influence and trade with [[Massilia]], where similar cult statues of Artemis existed, would have completed the process.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt;  

According to Françoise Hélène Pairault's study,&lt;ref&gt;"Diana Nemorensis, déesse latine, déesse hellénisée" in ''Mélanges d' archéologie et d'histoire'' '''81''' 1969 p. 425-471.&lt;/ref&gt; historical and archaeological evidence point to the fact that the characteristics given to both Diana of the Aventine Hill and [[Diana Nemorensis]] were the product of the direct or indirect influence of the cult of Artemis, which was spread by the Phoceans among the Greek towns of Campania [[Cumae|Cuma]] and [[Capua]], who in turn had passed it over to the Etruscans and the Latins by the 6th and 5th centuries BCE.

Evidence suggests that a confrontation occurred between two groups of Etruscans who fought for supremacy, those from [[Tarquinia]], [[Vulci]] and [[Caere]] (allied with the Greeks of Capua) and those of [[Clusium]]. This is reflected in the legend of the coming of Orestes to Nemi and of the inhumation of his bones in the Roman Forum near the temple of Saturn.&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''ad Aeneidem'' II 116; VI 136; [[Hyginus]] ''Fabulae'' 261.&lt;/ref&gt; The cult introduced by Orestes at Nemi is apparently that of the [[Artemis Tauropolos]]. The literary amplification&lt;ref&gt;Ovid ''Metamorphoses'' XIV 331-2 ''Scythicae regnum nemorale Dianae''; Lucanus ''Pharsalia'' III 86 "qua sublime nemus Scythicae qua regna Dianae". Silius Italicus ''Punica'' IV 367; VIII 362; Valerius Flaccus ''Argonauticae'' II 305.&lt;/ref&gt; reveals a confused religious background: different Artemis were conflated under the epithet.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Bayet]], "Les origines de l'Arcadisme romain" p.135; M. P. Nilson ''Griechische Religionsgeschichte'' Munich 1955 p. 485 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; As far as Nemi's Diana is concerned there are two different versions, by [[Strabo]]&lt;ref&gt;Strabo V 249: αφιδρύματα της ταυροπόλου.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Servius Honoratus]]. Strabo's version looks to be the most authoritative as he had access to first-hand primary sources on the sanctuaries of Artemis, i.e. the priest of Artemis Artemidoros of Ephesus. The meaning of ''Tauropolos'' denotes an Asiatic goddess with lunar attributes, lady of the herds.&lt;ref&gt;Suidas s.v. :η Άρτεμις εν Ταύροις της Σκυθίας τιμωμένη; η από μέρους, των ποιμνίων επστάσις. η ότι  η αυτη τη σελήνη εστι καί εποχειται ταύροις. Darehnberg -Saglio-Pottier ''Dictionnaire des antiquités '' s.v. Diana fig.. 2357.&lt;/ref&gt; The only possible ''interpretatio graeca'' of high antiquity concerning ''Diana Nemorensis'' could have been the one based on this ancient aspect of a deity of light, master of wildlife. ''Tauropolos'' is an ancient epithet attached to Artemis, [[Hecate]], and even [[Athena]].&lt;ref&gt;Hesichius s.v.

This religious complex is in turn supported by the triple statue of Artemis-Hecate.&lt;ref name=alfoldi/&gt;

In Rome, Diana was regarded with great reverence and was a patroness of lower-class citizens, called plebeians, as well as [[slavery|slaves]], who could receive asylum in her temples. [[Georg Wissowa]] proposed that this might be because the first slaves of the Romans were Latins of the neighboring tribes.&lt;ref&gt;as quoted by Dumézil ''La religion romaine archaique'' Paris, 1974, part 3, chap. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Temple of Artemis]] at Ephesus had the same custom of the asylum.

===In Rome===
[[File:Diane de Versailles Leochares 2.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Diana of Versailles]]'', a 2nd-century Roman version in the Greek tradition of iconography ([[Louvre Museum]], [[Paris]]).]]
Worship of Diana probably spread into the city of Rome beginning around 550 BCE,&lt;ref name=gordon&gt;Gordon, A.E. (1932). "On the Origin of Diana", ''Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association'' '''63''' (1932, pp. 177-192) p 178.&lt;/ref&gt; during her Hellenization and combination with the Greek goddess Artemis. Diana was first worshiped along with her brother and mother, [[Apollo]] and [[Latona]], in their temple in the [[Campus Martius]], and later in the [[Temple of Apollo Palatinus]].&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries/&gt;

The first major temple dedicated primarily to Diana in the vicinity of Rome was the [[Temple of Diana (Rome)|Temple of Diana Aventina]] (Diana of the [[Aventine Hill]]). According to the Roman historian [[Livy]], the construction of this temple began in the 6th century BCE and was inspired by stories of the massive [[Temple of Artemis]] at [[Ephesus]], which was said to have been built through the combined efforts of all the cities of [[Asia Minor]]. Legend has it that [[Servius Tullius]] was impressed with this act of massive political and economic cooperation, and convinced the cities of the [[Latin League]] to work with the Romans to build their own temple to the goddess.&lt;ref name="livy"&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab urbe condita (book)|Ab urbe condita]],'' 1.45&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no compelling evidence for such an early construction of the temple, and it is more likely that it was built in the 3rd century BCE, following the influence of the temple at Nemi, and probably about the same time the first temples to [[Vertumnus]] (who was associated with Diana) were built in Rome (264 BCE).&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; The misconception that the Aventine Temple was inspired by the Ephesian Temple might originate in the fact that the cult images and statues used at the former were based heavily on those found in the latter.&lt;ref name=gordon/&gt; Whatever its initial construction date, records show that the Avantine Temple was rebuilt by [[Lucius Cornificius]] in 32 BCE.&lt;ref name=carlsen/&gt; If it was still in use by the 4th century CE, the Aventine temple would have been permanently closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. Today, a short street named the ''Via del Tempio di Diana'' and an associated plaza, ''Piazza del Tempio di Diana'', commemorates the site of the temple. Part of its wall is located within one of the halls of the Apuleius restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wantedinrome.com/yellowpage/apuleius.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later temple dedications often were based on the model for ritual formulas and regulations of the Temple of Diana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Scheid]]|title=An Introduction to Roman Religion|translator=Janet Lloyd|date=2003|publisher=Indiana University Press|place=Bloomington, IN|trans-title=La Religion des Romains|origyear=1998|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman politicians built several minor temples to Diana elsewhere in Rome to secure public support. One of these was built in the [[Campus Martius]] in 187 BCE; no Imperial period records of this temple have been found, and it is possible it was one of the temples demolished around 55 BCE in order to build a theater.&lt;ref name=carlsen/&gt; Diana also had a public temple on the [[Quirinal Hill]], the sanctuary of Diana Planciana. It was dedicated by Plancius in 55 BCE, though it is unclear which Plancius.&lt;ref name=carlsen/&gt;

In their worship of Artemis, Greeks filled their temples with sculptures of the goddess created by well-known sculptors, and many were adapted for use in the worship of Diana by the Romans, beginning around the 2nd century BCE (the beginning of a period of strong [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic influence]] on Roman religion). The earliest depictions of the [[Artemis of Ephesus]] are found on Ephesian coins from this period. By the [[Roman imperial period (chronology)|Imperial period]], small marble statues of the Ephesian Artemis were being produced in the Western region of the Mediterranean and were often bought by Roman patrons.&lt;ref name=Nielsen&gt;Nielsen, M.

Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romans obtained a large copy of an Ephesian Artemis statue for their temple on the Aventine Hill.&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries&gt;Poulsen, B.

Museum Tusculanum Press. {{ISBN|8763507889}}, 9788763507882.&lt;/ref&gt; Diana was usually depicted for educated Romans in her Greek guise. If she was shown accompanied by a deer, as in the ''[[Diana of Versailles]]'', this is because Diana was the patroness of hunting. The deer may also offer a covert reference to the myth of [[Actaeon|Acteon]] (or Actaeon), who saw her bathing naked. Diana transformed Acteon into a stag and set his own hunting dogs to kill him.

===At Mount Tifata===
In [[Campania]], Diana had a major temple at Mount [[Tifata]], near [[Capua]]. She was worshiped there as ''Diana Tifatina''. This was one of the oldest sanctuaries in Campania. As a rural sanctuary, it included lands and estates that would have been worked by slaves following the Roman conquest of Campania, and records show that expansion and renovation projects at her temple were funded in part by other conquests by Roman military campaigns. The modern Christian church of [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] was built on the ruins of the Tifata temple.&lt;ref name=carlsen/&gt;

===Roman provinces===
In the Roman provinces, Diana was widely worshiped alongside local deities. Over 100 inscriptions to Diana have been cataloged in the provinces, mainly from [[Gaul]], [[Upper Germania]], and [[Britannia]]. Diana was commonly invoked alongside another forest god, [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]], as well as other "mountain gods". In the provinces, she was occasionally conflated with local goddesses such as [[Abnoba]], and was given high status, with ''Augusta'' and ''regina'' ("queen") being common epithets.&lt;ref name=deo&gt;[http://www.deomercurio.be/en/dianae.html Diane Abnobae: to Diana Abnoba]. Deo Mercurio. Access date 21 Nov 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Household worship===
Diana was not only regarded as a goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, but was often worshiped as a patroness of families. She served a similar function to the hearth goddess [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], and was sometimes considered to be a member of the [[Di Penates|Penates]], the deities most often invoked in household rituals. In this role, she was often given a name reflecting the tribe of family who worshiped her and asked for her protection. For example, in what is now [[Wiesbaden]], Diana was worshiped as ''Diana Mattiaca'' by the [[Mattiaci]] tribe. Other family-derived named attested in the ancient literature include ''Diana Cariciana'', ''Diana Valeriana'', and ''Diana Plancia''. As a house goddess, Diana often became reduced in stature compared to her official worship by the Roman state religion. In personal or family worship, Diana was brought to the level of other household spirits, and was believed to have a vested interest in the prosperity of the household and the continuation of the family. The Roman poet [[Horace]] regarded Diana as a household goddess in his ''[[Odes (Horace)|Odes]]'', and had an altar dedicated to her in his villa where household worship could be conducted. In his poetry, Horace deliberately contrasted the kinds of grand, elevated hymns to Diana on behalf of the entire Roman state, the kind of worship that would have been typical at her Aventine temple, with a more personal form of devotion.&lt;ref name=roman_lyric&gt;Cairns, F. (2012). ''Roman Lyric: Collected Papers on Catullus and Horace''. Volume 301 of Beiträge zur Altertumskunde. Walter de Gruyter, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Images of Diana and her associated myths have been found on [[Sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] of wealthy Romans. They often included scenes depicting sacrifices to the goddess, and on at least one example, the deceased man is shown joining Diana's hunt.&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries/&gt;

===Conflation with other goddesses===
[[File:MUFT_-_Diana_Abnoba.jpg|thumb|right|Wooden statue of Diana Abnoba, Museum for Prehistory in Thuringia]]
Diana was initially a hunting goddess and goddess of the local woodland at Nemi,&lt;ref name="Britanica15"&gt;{{cite web|title=Diana, Roman religion|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/Diana-Roman-religion|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as her worship spread, she acquired attributes of other similar goddesses. As she became conflated with Artemis, she became a [[moon goddess]], supplanting the earlier [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] goddess [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]].&lt;ref name=Britanica15 /&gt; She also became the goddess of childbirth and ruled over the countryside. Catullus wrote a poem to Diana in which she has more than one alias: Latonia, [[Lucina (mythology)|Lucina]], [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]], [[Trivia (mythology)|Trivia]], Luna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/35900939/Latin-Oration|title=Latin Oration|work=scribd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], Diana was often venerated at games held in Roman amphitheaters, and some inscriptions from the [[Danubian provinces]] show that she was conflated with [[Nemesis]] in this role, as ''Diana Nemesis''.&lt;ref name=Poulsen_sanctuaries/&gt;

Outside of Italy, Diana had important centers of worship where she was syncretised with similar local deities in [[Gaul]], [[Germania Superior|Upper Germania]], and [[Britannia]]. Diana was particularly important in the region in and around the [[Black Forest]], where she was conflated with the local goddess [[Abnoba]] and worshiped as ''Diana Abnoba''.&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Jufer &amp; Thierry Luginbühl (2001). ''Les dieux gaulois : répertoire des noms de divinités celtiques connus par l'épigraphie, les textes antiques et la toponymie.'' Paris: Editions Errance. {{ISBN|2-87772-200-7}}. p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some late antique sources went even further, syncretizing many local "great goddesses" into a single "Queen of Heaven". The [[Platonist]] philosopher [[Apuleius]], writing in the late [[2nd century]], depicted the goddess declaring:
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "I come, Lucius, moved by your entreaties: I, mother of the universe, mistress of all the elements, first-born of the ages, highest of the gods, queen of the shades, first of those who dwell in heaven, representing in one shape all gods and goddesses. My will controls the shining heights of heaven, the health-giving sea-winds, and the mournful silences of hell; the entire world worships my single godhead in a thousand shapes, with divers rites, and under many a different name. The Phrygians, first-born of mankind, call me the Pessinuntian Mother of the gods; the native Athenians the Cecropian Minerva; the island-dwelling Cypriots Paphian Venus; the archer Cretans Dictynnan Diana; the triple-tongued Sicilians Stygian Proserpine; the ancient Eleusinians Actaean Ceres; some call me Juno, some Bellona, others Hecate, others Rhamnusia; but both races of Ethiopians, those on whom the rising and those on whom the setting sun shines, and the Egyptians who excel in ancient learning, honour me with the worship which is truly mine and call me by my true name: Queen Isis."

Later poets and historians looked to Diana's identity as a triple goddess to merge her with triads heavenly, earthly, and underworld (cthonic) goddesses. [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]] said that the same goddess was called Luna in heaven, Diana on earth, and [[Proserpina]] in hell.&lt;ref name=servius&gt;[[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]], ''Commentary on Virgil's Aeneid'' 6.118.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Michael Drayton]] praises the Triple Diana in poem ''The Man in the Moone'' (1606): "So these great three most powerful of the rest, [[Phoebe (mythology)|Phoebe]], Diana, [[Hecate]], do tell. Her sovereignty in Heaven, in Earth and Hell".&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Chalmers, Samuel Johnson (1810), ''The Works of the English Poets, from Chaucer to Cowper VOL.IV'' p.421.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gil Harootunian, Gil Haroian-Guerin (1996).

==Mythology==
[[File:Volubilis mosaic Diana and her nymph.jpg|thumb|Mosaic depicting Diana and her nymph being surprised by Actaeon. Ruins of [[Volubilis]], 2nd century CE.]]
Unlike the [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]], Roman gods were, originally, considered to be [[numen]]a: divine powers of presence and will that did not necessarily have physical form. At the time Rome was founded, Diana and the other major Roman gods probably did not have much mythology per se, or any depictions in human form. The idea of gods as having [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] qualities and human-like personalities and actions developed later, under the influence of Greek and Etruscan religion.&lt;ref name=novaroma&gt;[http://www.novaroma.org/religio_romana/deities.html Gods and Goddesses of Rome]. ''Nova Roma''.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 3rd century BCE, Diana is found listed among the twelve major gods of the Roman pantheon by the poet [[Ennius]]. Though the [[Capitoline Triad]] were the primary state gods of Rome, early Roman myth did not assign a strict hierarchy to the gods the way Greek mythology did, though the Greek hierarchy would eventually be adopted by Roman religion as well.&lt;ref name=novaroma/&gt;

Once Greek influence had caused Diana to be considered identical to the Greek goddess [[Artemis]], Diana acquired Artemis' physical description, attributes, and variants of her myths as well. Like Artemis, Diana is usually depicted in art wearing a short skirt, with a hunting bow and quiver, and often accompanied by hunting dogs. A 1st-century BCE Roman coin (see above) depicted her with a unique, short hairstyle, and in triple form, with one form holding a bow and another holding a [[poppy]].&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

===Myth of Actaeon===
Diana's mythology incorporated stories which were variants of earlier stories about Artemis. Possibly the most well-known of these is the myth of [[Actaeon]]. In [[Ovid]]'s version of this myth, part of his poem ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', he tells of a pool or grotto hidden in the wooded valley of Gargaphie. There, Diana, the goddess of the woods, would bathe and rest after a hunt. Actaeon, a young hunter, stumbled across the grotto and accidentally witnessed the goddess bathing without invitation. In retaliation, Diana splashed him with water from the pool, cursing him, and he transformed into a deer. His own hunting dogs caught his scent, and tore him apart.&lt;ref name=diana_religion/&gt;

Ovid's version of the myth of Actaeon differs from most earlier sources. Unlike earlier myths about Artemis, Actaeon is killed for an innocent mistake, glimpsing Diana bathing. An earlier variant of this myth, known as the Bath of [[Athena|Pallas]], had the hunter intentionally spy on the bathing goddess Pallas (Athena), and earlier versions of the myth involving Artemis did not involve the bath at all.&lt;ref name=diana_actaeon&gt;Schlam, C.C. (1984). Diana and Actaeon: Metamorphoses of a Myth. ''Classical Antiquity'', Vol. 3, No. 1 (Apr., 1984), pp. 82-110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore==
[[File:Bronze satuette Diana CdM Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Gallo-Roman religion|Gallo-Roman]] bronze statuette of Diana (latter 1st century)]]

===The "Society of Diana"===
Diana is the only pagan goddess mentioned by name in the [[New Testament]] ([[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] 19). As a result, she became associated with many folk beliefs involving goddess-like supernatural figures that [[Catholic]] clergy wished to demonize. In the [[Middle Ages]], legends of night-time processions of spirits led by a female figure are recorded in the church records of northern Italy, western Germany, and southern France. The spirits were said to enter houses and consume food which then miraculously re-appeared. They would sing and dance, and dispense advise regarding healing herbs and the whereabouts of lost objects. If the house was in good order, they would bring fertility and plenty. If not, they would bring curses to the family. Some women reported participating in these processions while their bodies still lay in bed. Historian [[Carlo Ginzburg]] has referred to these legendary spirit gatherings as "The Society of Diana".&lt;ref name=stregheria/&gt;

Local clergy complained that women believed they were following Diana or [[Herodias]], riding out on appointed nights to join the processions or carry out instructions from the goddess.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia&gt;Magliocco, Sabina. (2009). Aradia in Sardinia: The Archaeology of a Folk Character. Pp. 40-60 in ''Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon''. Hidden Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reports of these legends appear in the writings of [[Regino of Prüm]] in the year 899, followed by many additional reports and variants of the legend in documents by [[Ratherius]] and others. By 1310, the names of the goddess figures attached to the legend were sometimes combined as '''Herodiana'''.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt; It is likely that the clergy of this time used the identification of the procession's leader as Diana or Herodias in order to fit an older folk belief into a Biblical framework, as both are featured and demonized in the New Testament. Herodias was often conflated with her daughter [[Salame]] in legend, which also holds that, upon being presented with the severed head of [[John the Baptist]], she was blown into the air by wind from the saint's mouth, through which she continued to wander for eternity. Diana was often conflated with [[Hecate]], a goddess associated with the spirits of the dead and with witchcraft. These associations, and the fact that both figures are attested to in the Bible, made them a natural fit for the leader of the ghostly procession. Clergy used this identification to assert that the spirits were evil, and that the women who followed them were inspired by demons. As was typical of this time period, though pagan beliefs and practices were near totally eliminated from Europe, the clergy and other authorities still treated paganism as a real threat, in part thanks to biblical influence; much of the Bible had been written when various forms of paganism were still active if not dominant, so medieval clergy applied the same kinds of warnings and admonitions for any non-standard folk beliefs and practices they encountered.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt; Based on analysis of church documents and parishioner confessions, it is likely that the spirit identified by the Church as Diana or Herodias was called by names of pre-Christian figures like [[Holda]] (a Germanic goddess of the winter solstice), or with names referencing her bringing of prosperity, like the Latin '''Abundia''' (meaning "plenty"), '''Satia''' (meaning "full" or "plentiful") and the Italian Richella (meaning "rich").&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt; Some of the local titles for her, such as ''bonae res'' (meaning "good things"), are similar to late classical titles for Hecate, like ''bona dea''. This might indicate a cultural mixture of medieval folk ideas with holdovers from earlier pagan belief systems. Whatever her true origin, by the 13th century, the leader of the legendary spirit procession had come to be firmly identified with Diana and Herodias through the influence of the Church.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt;

===''The Golden Bough''===
[[Image:Golden bough.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting of the Golden Bough incident in the ''[[Aeneid]]'']]
In his wide-ranging, comparative study of mythology and religion, ''[[The Golden Bough]]'', anthropologist [[James George Frazer]] drew on various lines of evidence to re-interpret the legendary rituals associated with Diana at [[Nemi]], particularly that of the ''rex Nemorensis''. Frazer developed his ideas in relation to [[J. M. W. Turner]]'s painting, also titled ''The Golden Bough'', depicting a dream-like vision of the woodland lake of Nemi. According to Frazer, the ''rex Nemorensis'' or king at Nemi was the incarnation of a [[Life-death-rebirth deity|dying and reviving god]], a [[solar deity]] who participated in a mystical marriage to a goddess. He died at the harvest and was reincarnated in the spring. Frazer claimed that this motif of death and rebirth is central to nearly all of the world's religions and mythologies. In Frazer's theory, Diana functioned as a goddess of fertility and childbirth, who, assisted by the sacred king, ritually returned life to the land in spring. The king in this scheme served not only as a high priest but as a god of the grove. Frazer identifies this figure with [[Virbius]], of which little is known, but also with [[Jupiter]] via an association with sacred oak trees. Frazer argued furthemore that Jupiter and Juno were simply duplicate names of Jana and [[Janus]]; that is, Diana and Dianus, all of whom had identical functions and origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frazer, Sir James|title= The Golden Bough|location= London|publisher= Wordsworth|date= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazer's speculatively reconstructed folklore of Diana's origins and the nature of her cult at Nemi were not well received even by his contemporaries. Godfrey Lienhardt noted that even during Frazer's lifetime, other anthropologists had "for the most part distanced themselves from his theories and opinions", and that the lasting influence of ''The Golden Bough'' and Frazer's wider body of work "has been in the literary rather than the academic world."&lt;ref name="Lienhardt"&gt;{{Citation|issn=0044-8370|volume=24|issue=1|year=1993|first=Godfrey|last=Lienhardt|title=Frazer's anthropology: science and sensibility|pages=1–12|journal=[[Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Ackerman wrote that, for anthropologists, Frazer is "an embarrassment" for being "the most famous of them all" and that most distance themselves from his work. While ''The Golden Bough'' achieved wide "popular appeal" and exerted a "disproportionate" influence "on so many [20th century] creative writers", Frazer's ideas played "a much smaller part" in the history of academic social anthropology.&lt;ref name=Lienhardt/&gt;

Folk legends like the one above, linking Diana to forbidden gatherings of women with spirits, may have influenced later works of folklore like [[Charles Godfrey Leland]]'s ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', which prominently featured Diana at the center of an Italian witch-cult.&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt; In Leland's interpretation of supposed Italian folk witchcraft, Diana is considered Queen of the Witches. In this belief system, Diana is said to have created the world of her own being having in herself the seeds of all creation yet to come. It was said that out of herself she divided the darkness and the light, keeping for herself the darkness of creation and creating her brother [[Lucifer]]. Diana was believed to have loved and ruled with her brother, and with him bore a daughter, [[Aradia]] (a name likely derived from Herodias), who leads and teaches the witches on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Charles G. Leland, ''Aradia: The Gospel of Witches'', Theophania Publishing, US, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aradia_sardinia/&gt;

Leland's claim that ''Aradia'' represented an authentic tradition from an underground witch-cult secretly having worshiped Diana since ancient times has been dismissed by most scholars of folklore, religion, and medieval history. After the 1921 publication of [[Margaret Murray]]'s ''The Witch-cult in Western Europe'', which hypothesized that the European [[witch-hunt|witch trials]] were actually a persecution of a pagan religious survival, American sensationalist author Theda Kenyon's 1929 book ''Witches Still Live'' connected Murray's thesis with the witchcraft religion in ''Aradia''.&lt;ref name = "Kenyon"&gt;Hutton, 2000, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Clifton 62"&gt;Clifton, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against Murray's thesis would eventually include arguments against Leland. Witchcraft scholar [[Jeffrey Burton Russell|Jeffrey Russell]] devoted some of his 1980 book ''A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans'' to arguing against the claims Leland presented in ''Aradia''.&lt;ref name="Russell"&gt;{{cite book | first= Jeffrey | last=Russell | authorlink=Jeffrey Burton Russell | title=A History of Witchcraft: Sorcerers, Heretics and Pagans | publisher =Thames and Hudson | year=1982 | isbn=0-19-820744-1| page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Elliot Rose's ''A Razor for a Goat'' dismissed ''Aradia'' as a collection of incantations unsuccessfully attempting to portray a religion.&lt;ref name="Rose"&gt;{{cite book | first=Elliot | last=Rose | title=A Razor for a Goat | publisher = University of Toronto Press | year=1962|pages=148–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Triumph of the Moon'', historian [[Ronald Hutton]] doubted not only of the existence of the religion that ''Aradia'' claimed to represent, and that the traditions Leland presented were unlike anything found in actual [[medieval literature]].&lt;ref name="Hutton145"&gt;Hutton, 2000, pp. 145–148.&lt;/ref&gt; but also of the existence of Leland's sources, arguing that it is more likely that Leland created the entire story than that Leland could be so easily "duped".&lt;ref name="Hutton301"&gt;{{cite book | first=Ronald | last=Hutton | authorlink=Ronald Hutton | title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy | publisher =Oxford University Press | year=1991 |page=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious scholar Chas S. Clifton took exception to Hutton's position, writing that it amounted to an accusation of "serious literary fraud" made by an "[[argument from ignorance|argument from absence]]".&lt;ref name="Clifton67"&gt;Clifton, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern worship==
Because Leland's claims about an Italian witch-cult are questionable, the first verifiable worship of Diana in the modern age was probably begun by [[Wicca]]. The earliest known practitioners of Neopagan witchcraft were members of [[Gardnerian Wicca|a tradition]] begun by [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]. Published versions of the devotional materials used by Gardner's group, dated to 1949, are heavily focused on the worship of [[Aradia]], the daughter of Diana in Leland's folklore. Diana herself was recognized as an aspect of a single "great goddess" in the tradition of [[Apuleius]], as described in the Wiccan [[Charge of the Goddess]] (itself adapted from Leland's text).&lt;ref name=gardenrianBOS&gt;Kelly, A. ''The Gardnerian Book of Shadows''. Accessed online 26 Nov 2018 at http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/gbos/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some later Wiccans, such as [[Scott Cunningham]], would replace Aradia with Diana as the central focus of worship.&lt;ref name=cunningham&gt;Cunningham, S. (2009). ''Cunningham's Book of Shadows: The Path of An American Traditionalist''. {{ISBN|0-73871-914-5}}. Llewellyn: Woodbury, MN.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s, [[Victor Henry Anderson]] founded the [[Feri Tradition]] of Neopagan witchcraft, which drew from both Charles Leland's folklore and the Gardnerian tradition. Anderson claimed that he had first been initiated into a witchcraft tradition as a child in 1926,&lt;ref&gt;Wallworth, William (2015). "Victor Henry Anderson (1917–2001)". Deadfamilies.com. Archived from the original on 19 February 2015. Retrieved 19 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had been told the name of the goddess worshiped by witches was Tana.&lt;ref name=Faerywolf&gt;Faerywolf, S. (2018). ''Forbidden Mysteries of Faery Witchcraft''. Llewellyn Worldwide. {{ISBN|0738756644}}, 9780738756646&lt;/ref&gt; The name Tana originated in Leland's ''Aradia'', where he claimed it was an old [[Etruscan religion|Etruscan]] name for Diana. The Feri Tradition founded by Anderson continues to recognize Tana/Diana as an aspect of the Star Goddess related to the element of fire, and representing "the fiery womb that gives birth to and transforms all matter."&lt;ref name=Faerywolf/&gt; (In ''Aradia'', Diana is also credited as the creatrix of the material world and Queen of Faeries&lt;ref name=gary&gt;Gary, Gemma (2018). "Forward". In Leland, Charles G. ''Aradia or the Gospel of Witches''. London: Troy Books Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;).

A few Wiccan traditions would elevate Diana to a more prominent position of worship, and there are two distinct modern [[Dianic tradition|branches of Wicca]] focused primarily on Diana. The first, founded during the early 1970s in the United States by Morgan McFarland and Mark Roberts, has a [[Second-wave feminism|feminist]] theology and only occasionally accepts male participants, and leadership is limited to female priestesses.&lt;ref name=Adler1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mcfarlanddianic.org/a-chronology.php| archive-date=27 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727074227/http://www.mcfarlanddianic.org/a-chronology.php | title= The McFarland Dianics -- A Chronology - Spring Equinox, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; McFarland Dianic Wiccans base their tradition primarily on the work of [[Robert Graves]] and his book ''[[The White Goddess]]'', and was inspired by references to the existence of medieval European "Dianic cults" in [[Margaret Murray]]'s book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]''.&lt;ref name=McFarlandSite1 /&gt; The [[Dianic Wicca|second Dianic tradition]], founded by [[Zsuzsanna Budapest]] in the mid 1970s, is characterized by an exclusive focus on the feminine aspect of the divine, and as a result is exclusively female. This tradition combines elements from [[British Traditional Wicca]], Italian folk-magic based on the work of Charles Leland, feminist values, and healing practices drawn from a variety of different cultures.&lt;ref name=Budapest1&gt;Budapest, Zsuzsanna. ''Holy Book of Women's Mysteries'', The. 1980 (2003 electronic). {{ISBN|0-914728-67-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Adler1&gt;[[Margot Adler|Adler, Margot]].

Chapter 8: Women, Feminism, and the Craft".&lt;/ref&gt;

A third [[Neopagan]] tradition heavily inspired by the worship of Diana through the lens of Italian folklore is [[Stregheria]], founded in the 1980s. It centers around a pair of deities regarded as divine lovers, who are known by several variant names including Diana and [[Dianus]], alternately given as Tana and Tanus or Jana and Janus (the later two deity names were mentioned by James Frazer in ''The Golden Bough'' as later corruptions of Diana and Dianus, which themselves were alternate and possibly older names for Juno and [[Jupiter]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Modern Witchcraft and Neo-Paganism'', Shelley Rabinovitch &amp; James Lewis, page 262, (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition was founded by author Raven Grimassi, and influenced by Italian folktales he was told by his mother. One such folktale describes the moon being impregnated by her lover the [[morning star]],{{dn|date=November 2018}} a parallel Leland's mythology of Diana and her lover Lucifer.&lt;ref name=stregheria&gt;Magliocco, Sabina.

Pp. 55-86 in Michael Strmiska, ed., ''Modern Paganism in World Cultures: Comparative Perspectives''. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-Clio.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana was also a subject of worship in certain [[Feraferia]]n rites, particularly those surrounding the autumnal equinox, beginning in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Butyrin, Svetlana. "[http://www.phaedrus.dds.nl/mabon5.htm Early Autumnal Festival]". Accessed online 26 Nov 2018, http://www.phaedrus.dds.nl/mabon5.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===In language===
Both the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] words for "[[fairy]]" ''Zână''&lt;ref name="DEX"&gt;''[http://www.toatecuvintele.ro/cuvant/Z%C3%A2n%C7%8E Zână]'' in [[Dicționarul explicativ al limbii române|DEX]] '98''&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sânziană]], the [[Leonese language|Leonese]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word for "water nymph" ''[[xana]]'', and the Spanish word for "shooting target" and "morning call" (''diana'') seem to come from the name of Diana.

[[File:Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry - Diana Reposing - Walters 3712.jpg|thumb|''Diana Reposing'' by [[Paul-Jacques-Aimé Baudry]]. The nude goddess, identified by the [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]] in her hair and the bow and [[quiver]] at her side, reclines on a blue drapery.]]
Since the [[Renaissance]], Diana's myths have often been represented in the visual and dramatic arts, including the opera ''[[L'arbore di Diana]]''. In the 16th century, Diana's image figured prominently at the châteaus of [[Château de Fontainebleau|Fontainebleau]], [[Château de Chenonceau|Chenonceau]], &amp; at [[Château d'Anet|Anet]], in deference to [[Diane de Poitiers]], mistress of [[Henry II of France|Henri of France]]. At [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] she was incorporated into the Olympian iconography with which [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], the Apollo-like "Sun King" liked to surround himself. Diana is also a character in the 1876 [[Léo Delibes]] ballet ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]''. The plot deals with Sylvia, one of Diana's nymphs and sworn to chastity, and Diana's assault on Sylvia's affections for the shepherd Amyntas.

====In literature====
* In "[[The Knight's Tale]]" in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', Emily prays to Diana to be spared from marriage to either Palamon or Arcite.
* In "Ode" by [[John Keats]], he writes 'Browsed by none but Dian's fawns' (line 12)
* In the sonnet "To Science" by [[Edgar Allan Poe]], science is said to have "dragged Diana from her car".
* Diana Soren, the main character in [[Carlos Fuentes]]' novel ''Diana o la cazadora soltera'' (''Diana, or The Lone Huntress''), is described as having the same personality as the goddess.
* In "Castaway" by [[Augusta Webster]], women who claim they are virtuous despite never having been tempted are referred to as "Dianas." (Line 128)
* In Jonathan Swift's poem: "The Progress of Beauty", as goddess of the moon, Diana is used in comparison to the 17th/early 18th century everyday woman Swift satirically writes about. Starts: 'When first Diana leaves her bed...'
* In Geoffrey of Monmouth's ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' ("History of the Kings of Britain"), Diana leads the Trojan Brutus to Britain, where he and his people settle.
* The character of Diana is the principal character in the children's novel ''The Moon Stallion'' by [[Brian Hayles]] (1978) and the BBC Television series of the same name ''Diana'' is played by the actress [[Sarah Sutton]].
;In Shakespeare
[[File:Giampietrino 05.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Diana as the Huntress, by [[Giampietrino]]]]
* In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]'' Diana appears to Pericles in a vision, telling him to go to her temple and tell his story to her followers.
* Diana is referenced in ''[[As You Like It]]'' to describe how Rosalind feels about marriage.
* Diana is referred to in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' when Orsino compares Viola (in the guise of Cesario) to Diana. "Diana's lip is not more smooth and rubious".
* Speaking of his wife, Desdemona, [[Othello]] the [[Moors|Moor]] says, "Her name, that was as fresh as Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black as my own face."
* There is a reference to Diana in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' where Hero is said to seem like 'Dian in her orb', in terms of her chastity.
* In ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'', Falstaff styles himself and his highway-robbing friends as "Diana's foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the moon" who are governed by their "noble and chase mistress the moon under whose countenance [they] steal".
* In ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' Diana appears as a figure in the play and Helena makes multiple allusions to her, such as, "Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly..." and "...wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian/was both herself and love..." The Steward also says, "...; Dian no queen of virgins,/ that would suffer her poor knight surprised, without/ rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward." It can be assumed that 'Dian' is simply a shortening of 'Diana' since later in the play when Parolles' letter to Diana is read aloud it reads 'Dian'.&lt;ref name="Yale University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Wilbur L.|title=The Yale Shakespeare: the complete works|year=1993|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|location=United States of America|isbn=1-56619-104-1|pages=365–399}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The goddess is also referenced indirectly in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''. The character Hippolyta states "And then the moon, like to a silver bow new bent in Heaven". She refers to Diana, goddess of the moon, who is often depicted with a silver hunting bow. In the same play the character Hermia is told by the Duke Theseus that she must either wed the character Demetrius "Or on Diana's alter to protest for aye austerity and single life". He refers to her becoming a nun, with the goddesse Diana having connotations of chastity.
* In ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' Portia states "I will die as chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will". (I.ii)
* In ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo describes Rosaline, saying that "She hath Dian's wit".
;In games and comics
* The character of Diana from the video game ''[[League of Legends]]'' is largely based on the goddess.
* [[William Moulton Marston]] drew from the Diana archetype in creating [[Wonder Woman]] of [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]], Paradise Island, and even gave her the proper name "Diana" for [[DC Comics]]. Most versions of Wonder Woman's origin story state that she is given the name Diana in tribute to the goddess. 
* Diana also is one of the primary gods in the video game ''Ryse''.
* In the manga and anime series ''[[Sailor Moon]]'', Diana is the feline companion to Chibiusa, Usagi's daughter.  Diana is the daughter of Artemis and Luna.  All of these characters are advisers to rulers of the kingdom of the moon and therefore have moon-associated names.

====In painting and sculpture====
[[Image:Diana by Augustus Saint-Gaudens 01.jpg|right|thumb|''Diana'' (1892&amp;ndash;93), [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]]. Bronze, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], [[New York City]].]]
Diana has been one of the most popular themes in art. Painters like [[Titian]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[François Boucher]], [[Nicholas Poussin]] and made use of her myth as a major theme. Most depictions of Diana in art featured the stories of Diana and [[Actaeon]], or [[Callisto (mythology)|Callisto]], or depicted her resting after hunting. Some famous work of arts with a Diana theme are:
* [[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]], [[Diana and Callisto]], and [[Death of Actaeon]] by Titian.
* ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', ''[[Diana Returning from the Hunt]]'', ''Diana Resting After a Bath'', and ''[[Diana Bathing (Boucher)|Diana Getting Out of Bath]]'' by [[François Boucher]].

* A sculpture by [[Christophe-Gabriel Allegrain]] can be seen at the Musée du Louvre.
* ''[[Diana (Saint-Gaudens)|"Diana of the Tower"]]'' a copper statue by [[Augustus Saint-Gaudens]] was created as the weather vane for the second [[Madison Square Garden (1890)|Madison Square Garden]] in 1893. It now is on display at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]
* A [https://web.archive.org/web/20140823073936/http://www.dictionaryofsydney.org/item/18337 sculpture] by French sculptor François-Léon Sicard in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20030408220426/http://www.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/waterexhibition/OrnamentalFountains/ArchibaldFountain.html Archibald Fountain], Sydney NSW Australia
* In Parma at the convent of San Paolo, Antonio Allegri da Correggio painted the chamber of the Abbess Giovanna Piacenza's apartment. He was commissioned in 1519 to paint the ceiling and mantel of the fireplace. On the mantel he painted an image of Diana riding in a chariot possibly pulled by a stag.
* ''Fuente de la Diana Cazador'' [Fountain of the Huntress Diana], a fountain sculpture of huntress Diana with arrow pointing skyward, stands in the roundabout at [[Paseo de la Reforma]], [[Zona Rosa, Mexico City|Zona Rosa]], [[Mexico City]]'s Mexican Federal District.
* [[Beaux Arts architecture]] and garden design (late 19th and early 20th centuries) used classic references in a modernized form. Two of the most popular of the period were of [[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] (goddess of orchards) as a metaphor for Agriculture, and Diana, representing Commerce, which is a perpetual hunt for advantage and profits.
[[Image:DianaAndPomona.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pomona (mythology)|Pomona]] (left, symbolizing [[agriculture]]), and Diana (symbolizing [[commerce]]) as building decoration]]

====In film====
*In [[Jean Cocteau]]'s 1946 film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1946 film)|La Belle et la Bête]]'', it is Diana's power which has transformed and imprisoned the beast.
*Diana/[[Artemis]] appears at the end of the 'Pastoral Symphony' segment of ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]''.
*In his 1968 film ''[[La Mariée était en noir]]'' [[François Truffaut]] plays on this mythological symbol. Julie Kohler, played by Jeanne Moreau, poses as Diana/[[Artemis]] for the artist Fergus. This choice seems fitting for Julie, a character beset by revenge, of which Fergus becomes the fourth victim. She poses with a bow and arrow, while wearing white.
* In the 1995 comedy ''[[Four Rooms]]'', a coven of witches resurrects a petrified Diana on New Year's Eve.
* French based collective LFKs and his film/theatre director, writer and visual artist Jean Michel Bruyere produced a series of 600 shorts and "medium" film, an interactive audiovisual 360° installation (''Si poteris narrare licet'' ("if you are able to speak of it, then you may do so" ...... ) in 2002, and a 3D 360° audiovisual installation ''La Dispersion du Fils'' &lt;http://www.newmediaart.eu/str10.html&gt; from 2008 to 2016 as well as an outdoor performance, "Une Brutalité pastorale" (2000), all about the myth of Diana and Actaeon.

==== In music ====
* Diana is a character in ''[[Hippolytus and Aricia]]'', an [[opera]] by [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]].
* Diana is mentioned along with two other goddesses, [[Luna (goddess)|Luna]] and [[Lucina (goddess)|Lucina]], in [[Mike Oldfield]]'s 1978 album, ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]''.
* For the album art of [[progressive metal]] band [[Protest the Hero]]'s second studio album ''[[Fortress (Protest the Hero album)|Fortress]]'', Diana is depicted protected by rams and other animals. The theme of Diana is carried throughout the album.
* The Norwegian classical [[composer]] [[Martin Romberg]] wrote a [[Mass (music)|mass]] for [[mixed choir]] in seven parts after a selection of poems from Leland's text ''Aradia'', in which Diana features heavily. The ''Witch Mass'' was premiered at the Vestfold International Festival in 2012 with [[Grex Vocalis]]. In order to create the right atmosphere for the music, the festival blocked of an entire road tunnel in [[Tønsberg]] to use it as a venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tb.no/kultur/ticker/kultur/tunnelen-blir-konsertarena/s/2-2.516-1.7178211|title= Report from the planning of the concert|publisher= tb.no.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was released on CD through Lawo Classics in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.challengerecords.com/products/14482758027365/|title=Witch Mass on CD|publisher= challengerecords.com.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electrojet''' is an [[electric current]] which travels around the [[E region]] of the Earth's [[ionosphere]]. There are two electrojets: above the magnetic equator (the [[equatorial electrojet]]), and near the Northern and Southern Polar Circles (the Auroral Electrojets).  Electrojets are Hall currents carried primarily by electrons at altitudes from 100 to 150&amp;nbsp;km.  In this region the electron gyro frequency ([[Larmor frequency]]) is much greater than the electron-neutral collision frequency.  In contrast, the principal [[E region]] ions (O2+ and NO+) have gyrofrequencies much lower than the ion-neutral collision frequency.

[[Kristian Birkeland]] was the first to suggest that polar electric currents (or auroral electrojets) are connected to a system of filaments (now called "[[Birkeland current]]s") that flow along geomagnetic field lines into and away from the polar region.&lt;ref name="NAPE"&gt;{{cite book|last=Birkeland|first=Kristian|title=The Norwegian Aurora Polaris Expedition 1902-1903|year=1908|publisher=H. Aschehoug &amp; Co|location=New York and Christiania (now Oslo)|url=https://archive.org/details/norwegianaurorap01chririch}} out-of-print, full text online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Equatorial Electrojet ==
The worldwide solar-driven wind results in the so-called Sq (solar quiet) current system in the E region of the Earth's ionosphere (100–130&amp;nbsp;km altitude). Resulting from this current is an electrostatic field directed E-W (dawn-dusk) in the equatorial day side of the ionosphere. At the magnetic dip equator, where the geomagnetic field is horizontal, this electric field results in an enhanced eastward current within ± 3 degrees of the magnetic equator, known as the [[equatorial electrojet]].

== Auroral Electrojet==
The term 'auroral electrojet' is the name given to the large horizontal currents that flow in the D and E regions of the auroral ionosphere. Although horizontal ionospheric currents can be expected to flow at any latitude where horizontal ionospheric electric fields are present, the auroral electrojet currents are remarkable for their strength and persistence. There are two main factors in the production of the electrojet. First of all, the conductivity of the auroral ionosphere is generally larger than that at lower latitudes. Secondly, the horizontal electric field in the auroral ionosphere is also larger than that at lower latitudes. Since the strength of the current is directly proportional to the vector product of the conductivity and the horizontal electric field, the auroral electrojet currents are generally larger compared to those at lower latitudes. 
During magnetically quiet periods, the electrojet is generally confined to the auroral oval. However during disturbed periods, the electrojet increases in strength and expands to both higher and lower latitudes. This expansion results from two factors, enhanced particle precipitation and enhanced ionospheric electric fields.

'''Fatih Sultan Mehmet Nature Park''' ({{lang-tr|'Fatih Sultan Mehmet Tabiat Parkı}}) is a [[nature park]] located in [[Sarıyer]] district of [[Istanbul Province]], Turkey.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt; 

Fatih Sultan Mehmet Nature Park is situated southwest of Sarıyer and southeast of [[Belgrad Forest]]. It covers an area of {{convert|111.85|ha|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="b1"/&gt; It was established in 2011 by the [[Ministry of Environment and Forest (Turkey)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]]. The protected area is named in honor of [[Ottoman sultan]] [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] (reigned 1444–1446, 1451–1481), who [[Fall of Constantinople|conquered Istanbul]] in 1453.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

The nature park offers outdoor recreational activities for visitors on daily basis. There are playgrounds for children. Marsh area around the pond has to be avoided for security reasons. Admission is charged for visitors and vehicles.&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

==Ecosystem==
;Flora
The nature park is situated inside the Fatih Forest, which has a dense middle-aged vegetation. The plants are mostly [[deciduous tree]]s, however there are also [[coniferous tree]]s. These are Kasnak oak (''[[Quercus vulcanica]]''), Turkey oak (''[[Quercus cerris]]''), common hornbeam (''[[Carpinus betulus]]''), sweet chestnut (''[[Castanea sativa]]''), oriental plane (''[[Platanus orientalis]]''), common ash (''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''), blackthorn (''[[Prunus spinosa]]''), black pine (''[[Pinus nigra]]''), black pine (''[[Pinus nigra]]''), blackbeery (''[[Rubus]]''), spineless butcher's-broom (''[[Ruscus hypoglossum]]''), giant heather (''[[Erica arborea]]''), Japanese laurel (''[[Aucuba japonica]]''), laurestine (''[[AViburnum tinus]]''), Australian laurel (''[[Pittosporum tobira]]'') and European ivy (''[[Hedera helix]]'').&lt;ref name="itp"/&gt;

'''Frans Michel Penning''' (12 September 1894 – 6 December 1953) was a Dutch experimental [[physicist]].&lt;ref name=Obituary&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arjenboogaard.nl/penning.html |archivedate=2015-08-11|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811030108/http://www.arjenboogaard.nl/penning.html |title=Frans Michel Penning (1894-1953) |accessdate=2014-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD from the University of Leiden in 1923,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|author=Frans Michel Penning |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Penning_1923.pdf |title=Metingen over isopyknen van gassen bij lage temperaturen |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied low pressure gas discharges at the Philips Laboratory in Eindhoven, developing new electron tubes during World War II. Many detailed observations of gas [[ionization]] were done with colleagues, finding notable results for helium and magnetic fields.  He made precise measurements of [[Townsend discharge]] coefficients and cathode voltage fall. Penning made important contributions to the advancement of high resolution [[Mass spectrometry]].

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Penning was born in west Netherlands in the town of Gorinchem  on 12 September 1894.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt; Penning attended the University of Leiden. He studied mathematics and physics as a graduate student under [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]]. Penning's doctoral work involved measuring thermodynamic properties of various gases at extremely low temperatures. Penning received his PhD on June 25, 1923 with a dissertation entitled 'Metingen over isopyknen van gassen bij lage temperaturen' (Measurements on Isometric Density Lines of Gases at Low Temperatures).&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Family===
His father [[Louwrens Penning]], was a popular novelist in the Dutch literary community; most known for romanticizing the Anglo-Boer War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=R.M. Kemperink|author2=Dr. J.A.E. Kuys|author3=E. Pelzers|author4=P van Wissing|author5=W.

Gietman (final editing)|date=2002|pages=116–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was Adriana Jenneke Machelina Heijmans. Penning married to Margje Derksen in 1921 and they had four children named Lourens, Hendricus, Paul, and Nellie.&lt;ref name="F.M.

==Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium==

===Early career===
In 1924, Penning was hired as an experimental physicist at the Dutch section of the Phillips research department located in the Strijp district of Eindhoven. Gilles Holst, former assistant to Heike Kamerlingh Onnes, and head of the [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium]] (NatLab), tasked Penning with continuing research on gas discharge phenomena to develop new lamps.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vries|first1=Marc de|last2=Boersma|first2=Kees|title=80 years of research at the Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium (1914-1994): the role of the Nat.

Penning investigated breakdown energy potentials of low pressure inert gas discharges. In 1926, Penning observed that electrons under direct voltage current in low-pressure mercury discharges reach high velocities due to high-frequency oscillations in the gas. This observations challenged Irving Langmuirs observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penning|first1=F. M.|title=Scattering of Electrons in Ionised Gases|journal=Nature|date=1926|volume=118|issue=2965|pages=301–301|doi=10.1038/118301a0|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/118301a0|language=En|issn=1476-4687|bibcode=1926Natur.118..301P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penning also investigated the impact gas density and electrode distance have on the voltage and stability of noble gas mixture discharges by measuring Paschen curves.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;
[[File:0772GM0277 Natlab Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|right|Philips Natuurkundig Labarotorium (NatLab) located in the Strijp district of Eindhoven, Netherlands.]]

===Penning ionization===
[[Penning ionization]] is a form of [[chemi-ionization]], an ionization process involving reactions between neutral atoms or molecules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berry|first1=R. Stephen|title=The Theory of Penning Ionization|journal=Radiation Research|date=1974|volume=59|issue=2|pages=367–375|doi=10.2307/3573984|jstor=3573984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Penning effect, as it is often called, describes an ionization chain reaction caused by high energy collision between excited inert gas (i.g. Argon) metastable atoms and trace gas impurities whose ionization potential is less than the stored potential of the meta-stable molecule. These collisions cause the release of electrons; which can interact with other stable noble gas molecules to create more meta-stables, resulting in more ionizing reactions. Penning first reported the effect in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Penning, F. M. ''Die Naturwissenschaften'', 1927, '''15''', 818.  ''Über Ionisation durch metastabile Atome.''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Penning effect]] is used in gas-discharge [[neon lamp]]s and [[fluorescent lamp]]s, where the lamp is filled with a [[Penning mixture]] to improve the electrical characteristics.

===Penning gauge===
Penning invented a type of [[cold cathode]] vacuum gauge known as the [[Penning gauge]],&lt;ref name="Penning1937"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penning|first1=F.M.|title=Ein neues manometer für niedrige gasdrucke, insbesondere zwischen l0−3 und 10−5 mm|journal=Physica|volume=4|issue=2|date=1937|pages=71–75|issn=0031-8914|doi=10.1016/S0031-8914(37)80123-8|bibcode = 1937Phy.....4...71P }}&lt;/ref&gt; which Phillips commercialized.
[[File:Patent image 2-US2197079A Penning Gauge.png|thumb|left| 1936 Patent schematic of the method and device used to measure low pressure gases by cold cathode, developed by F.M. Penning while working at the NatLab]]
Penning investigated the effect of magnetic fields on low pressure gas discharges. He determined that the energy current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field could be used to reliably measure the pressure. In his first attempt to measure the energy current, Penning used a triode ion gauge system with a linear electron flight path. This method worked, but was fragile and ineffective at very low pressures. In his second attempt, he equipped his vacuum tube with a ring shaped cathode and two anode plates above and below in a magnetic field. Electrons now traveled a longer flight path out of the ring, between electrodes in a spiral orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/2012/10/pennings-vacuum-gauge |title=Penning’s vacuum gauge |last= Sella |first=Andrea |work=Chemistry World |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |accessdate=2012-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing the electron flight path allowed for more collisions with meta-stable atoms. This amplified the electron signal, which was sufficient to measure gas pressure. The Penning manometer (vacuum gauge) emerged as a practical application.&lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;

===Penning trap===
The [[Penning trap]] stores charged particles by magnetic and electric fields.  It was named after Penning by [[Hans Georg Dehmelt]] who built the first trap. Dehmelt got inspiration from the vacuum gauge built by Penning where a current through a discharge tube in a magnetic field is proportional to the pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans G. Dehmelt - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/dehmelt-bio.html|website=www.nobelprize.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Penning traps are currently used for magnetic measurements and are an active research topic. The introduction of this trap lead to new approaches in high resolution mass spectrometry with mass spectrometers such as the ion cyclotron, resonance spectrometer, or ion trap.

===Late career===
For a short period during world war two Penning worked at the Phillips Tube Factory developing high frequency electron tubes. Penning with M.J. Druyveseyn, wrote a review of his work on gas discharges that was published in 1940 in the American Review of modern Physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Druyvesteyn|first1=M. J.|last2=Penning|first2=F. M.|title=The Mechanism of Electrical Discharges in Gases of Low Pressure|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|date=1 April 1940|volume=12|issue=2|pages=87–174|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.12.87|url=https://journals.aps.org/rmp/abstract/10.1103/RevModPhys.12.87|bibcode=1940RvMP...12...87D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the German occupation of Holland, Penning didn’t see the final publication until 1946.
After the war he focused on the phenomena of cathode fall during glow-discharge reactions. Penning created a cathode tube with a more stable voltages by removing the oxide layer from the cathode; this allowed for consistent measurement of cathode fall .&lt;ref name=auto1 /&gt;
In the 1950s Penning’s health began to deteriorate. He passed away on December 6, 1953 at Ultrech.&lt;ref name=Obituary /&gt;

When a [[vacuum tube]] circuit malfunctions and draws excessive current, the [[Plate electrode|anode]] ("plate") may overheat, sometimes causing a visible [[red]] or orange glow. In [[consumer electronics]], this is universally indicative that the tube is experiencing an [[Overcurrent|overload]] condition, though the reasons for the overload may vary.

Some high-powered vacuum tubes (e.g. large transmitter or [[induction heating]] tubes) have [[Fused quartz|silica]] envelopes and/or [[graphite]] or [[zirconium]] coated [[tantalum]] plates which are intended to operate at glowing temperatures and thus employ ''radiation cooling''. The zirconium plate coating acts as a [[getter]], and proper getter action in these tubes depends on the plate running at high temperatures. Such tubes may develop excessive gas content if underloaded for long periods of time. One trade name for this type of plate coating is [[Eimac]]'s "pyrovac".

==Causes==
In consumer equipment, it is usually a sign of a [[short circuit|short]]ed or badly mistuned [[external electric load|load]], or a badly out-of-bias condition. When testing, repairing or restoring vacuum tube-based equipment, it is wise to watch the plates of all the tubes for this condition.

==Dangers==
If the tube is overloaded, not only can the plate warp, causing a short to outer grids or beam-shaping elements, but the [[emissive layer]] on the [[cathode]] will be consumed very quickly. The equipment's power supply and the tube's load ([[output transformer]]s, [[flyback transformer]]s, etc.) are likely to be damaged by a sustained overload condition, so power should be immediately disconnected when a glowing plate is found.

==Common Occurrences==
In modern-day repair and maintenance of early tube-based consumer electronics devices, a glowing plate will be rarely encountered. As a visible symptom of a destructive failure, checking for an overheated tube is essential to ensure the safe and reliable operation of the equipment undergoing maintenance. 

Most frequently, a glowing plate overload will be found in rectifiers and output tubes. In particular: 
*[[Rectifier]] tubes (5U4, 80, etc.), usually due to shorted [[capacitor]]s or other substantial short circuits within the device. The power supply's output may be easily disconnected from the rest of the circuit in order to determine whether the overload is occurring in the supply or elsewhere.
*Horizontal and vertical output tubes in television sets (6CD6, 21LU8, etc.), usually due to a shorted coupling capacitor upsetting the bias or the driving [[oscillator]] operating well out of its design range. [[Deflection yoke]]s are sometimes faulty.
**Horizontal output tubes may also be overloaded by a flyback transformer with shorted turns, a defective damper (i.e. 6W4), high voltage rectifier (i.e. 1B3) or high voltage regulator (i.e. 6BK4) tube.
**Early color television receivers also used a complex dynamic convergence system, which was driven by both the horizontal and vertical output stages. Failure of part of this system could overload either tube, though this author has never seen such a failure in person.
*Audio output tubes in radios, stereos, public address systems and guitar amplifiers (50C5, 6L6, etc.), usually due to a bad coupling capacitor upsetting the bias or a shorted load.

If any tube presents a glowing plate, the equipment should be shut down immediately to avoid further damage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="874">'''Green coke''' (raw coke) is the primary solid carbonization product from high boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained at temperatures below 900 K. It contains a fraction of matter that can be released as volatiles during subsequent heat treatment at temperatures up to approximately 1600 K. This mass fraction, called volatile matter, is in the case of green coke between 4 and 15 wt.%, but it depends also on the heating rate.

Raw coke is an equivalent term to green coke although it is now less frequently used. The proportion of volatile matter of green coke depends on temperature and time of cooking, but also on the method for its determination.

The '''''Handbook to the Birds of Australia''''' is a two-volume work published in [[London]] in 1865 by the author [[John Gould]].  It was published in [[octavo]] format (250 x 170&amp;nbsp;mm), containing some 1290 pages, bound in green cloth with gilt lyrebirds on the front covers and with decorated gilt spines.  The two volumes are separately paginated and include no illustrations  It is essentially a revision and update of the text originally published with Gould’s monumental illustrated folio [[The Birds of Australia (Gould)|The Birds of Australia]], which was published in seven volumes between 1840 and 1848.  The author says in his Preface:

&lt;blockquote&gt;”Nearly twenty years have elapsed since my folio work on the Birds of Australia was completed.  During that period many new species have been discovered, and much additional information acquired respecting those comprised therein; consequently it appeared to me that a careful ''résumé'' of the entire subject would be acceptable to the possessors of the former edition, as well as to the many persons in Australia who are now turning their attention to the ornithology of the country in which they are resident.  Indeed I have been assured that such a work is greatly needed to enable the explorer during his journeyings, or the student in his quiet home, to identify the species that may come under his notice, and as a means by which the curators of the museums now established in the various colonies may arrange and name the collections intrusted to their charge.  With these views the present Handbook has been prepared.”&lt;ref&gt;Gould (1865), p.xxi (vol.1).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1972 Lansdowne Editions published a facsimile reprint of the Handbook, with the two volumes bound in one, including a foreword (“A Note on the Handbook”) by Allan McEvey, Curator of Birds at the [[Museum Victoria|National Museum of Victoria]], as well as a biographical note on John Gould by John Currey.  In his foreword McEvey says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The essential status of the ''Handbook'' emerges from its historical position; it looks back to the beginning of Australian ornithology, summarizing the known,  and forward to the great ''Catalogue'' by [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe|Sharpe]] and others, and to the Australian works of [[Edward Pierson Ramsay|Ramsay]], [[Archibald James Campbell|Campbell]], [[Alfred John North|North]] and [[Gregory Mathews|Mathews]].  From this transitional point it provides the present-day worker with an invaluable link between the early and the recent.  Here will be found the familiar quote, (e.g. on the strength of Shrike-tit mandibles), the elusive reference, (e.g. an early note on the possible breaking of Emu’s eggs by the Buzzard), and many an easily over-looked observation (e.g. the remarks on the flight of the Owlet-nightjar).  If one sees the text in historical perspective and reads critically (e.g. Gould’s comments on the nesting sites of pardalotes are inadequate) it may generally be said that the ''Handbook'' entry offers the best starting-point for the serious gathering of information on any particular Australian species.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"But in addition to the extraordinary amount of good observation it records, and to its plentiful snippets of ornithological and, indeed, Australian history, the ''Handbook'' offers pleasing samples of natural history prose of the nineteenth century which, verbose or not, reflect the dignity that the age expected of its science.  It is true that Gould broadly speaking, was deaf to the song of Australian birds, but this probably shows the subjectiveness of nationality rather than a lack of appreciative ability.  He was an Englishman, attuned to a mellow countryside and a seasonal bird-song, now in an arid land, looking – and listening – for ornithological differences.  The Murray Scrub (mallee) was a far cry from Dorset, and 26 Charlotte Street; he heard little that stimulated nostalgic affection; and one does not become an Australian in two years  But he was not insensitive and his various comments illustrate both his inevitable limitation and his response to the aesthetic.”&lt;ref&gt;McEvey (1972), pp.xi-xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Lilliput''' and '''Blefuscu''' are two fictional island [[Fictional country|nations]] that appear in the first part of the 1726 novel ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]]. The two islands are neighbours in the [[Indian Ocean|South Indian Ocean]], separated by a channel {{convert|800|yard}} wide. Both are inhabited by tiny people who are about [[1:12 scale|one-twelfth the height of ordinary human beings]]. Both kingdoms are empires, i.e. realms ruled by a self-styled emperor. The capital of Lilliput is Mildendo. In some pictures, the islands are arranged like an [[egg]], as a reference to their egg-dominated histories and cultures.

==Geography==
Swift gives the location of Lilliput and Blefuscu as Latitude 30°2′S, to the northwest of [[Van Diemen's Land]] (Tasmania). Because this area is actually occupied by Australia, and on the basis of other textual evidence, some have concluded that Swift intended to place Lilliput in the Pacific Ocean, to the northeast, not northwest, of Van Diemen's Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bracher |first1=Frederick |year=1944 |title=The Maps in 'Gulliver's Travels' |journal=Huntington Library Quarterly |publisher=University of California Press |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=67–68 |jstor=3815865 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Four Essays on Gulliver's Travels |chapter=The Geography and Chronology of ''Gulliver's Travels'' |last=Case |first=Arthur E.  |year=1945 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton |pages=50–68 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the map (see illustration) indicates, mainland Australia had been barely explored by Europeans at that time.

Lilliput is said to extend 5,000 ''blustrugs'', or twelve miles in circumference.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; Blefuscu is located northeast of Lilliput, across an 800-yard (730 m) channel.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; The only cities mentioned by Swift are Mildendo,&lt;ref&gt;Swift, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; the capital of Lilliput, and Blefuscu, capital of Blefuscu.&lt;ref name="Swift, chapter 7"&gt;Swift, chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernised Lilliput is the setting of a 1958 sequel children's novel, ''Castaways in Lilliput'', by [[Henry Winterfeld]]. This book provides more geographical detail: other cities in addition to Mildendo include Plips (a major city and cathedral town), Wiggywack (a suburb of Mildendo and seat of the Island Council),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Castaways in Lilliput |last=Winterfeld |first=Henry |authorlink=Henry Winterfeld |others=trans. Kyrill Schabert |year=1958 |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |location=San Diego |isbn= |page=94 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tottenham (on the west coast),&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; and Allenbeck (at the mouth of a river on the west coast).&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and politics==
Lilliput is said to be ruled by an Emperor, Golbasto Momarem Evlame Gurdilo Shefin Mully Ully Gue. He is assisted by a [[first minister]] (who carries a white staff) and several other officials (who later brings [[articles of impeachment]] against Gulliver on grounds of [[treason]]): the ''galbet'' or high [[admiral]], Skyresh Bolgolam; the [[lord high treasurer]], Flimnap; the general, Limnoc; the [[chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]], Lalcom; and the [[chief justice|grand justiciary]], Balmuff.&lt;ref name="Swift, chapter 7"/&gt; Blefuscu is also ruled by an Emperor, who is not named.

Both nations follow the teachings of a prophet, Lustrog, as recorded in their scripture, known as the Blundecral ("which is their [[Alcoran]]", an older term for the Qur'ān of [[Islam]]). Sectarian divisions exist in the debate between "Little-Endians" and "Big-Endians" (see below).

===Satirical interpretations===
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2010}}
Lilliput and Blefuscu were intended as, and understood to be, satirical portraits of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of France]], respectively, as they were in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|30}} Only the internal politics of Lilliput are described in detail; these are parodies of British politics, in which the great central issues of the day are belittled and reduced to unimportance.&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|30}}

For instance, the two major political parties of the day were the [[British Whig Party|Whigs]] and the [[British Tory Party|Tories]]. The Tories are parodied as the ''Tramecksan'' or "High-Heels" (due to their adhesion to the [[high church]] party of the [[Church of England]], and their exalted views of royal supremacy), while the Whigs are represented as the ''Slamecksan'' or "Low-Heels" (the Whigs inclined toward [[low church]] views, and believed in [[parliamentary supremacy]]). These issues, generally considered to be of fundamental importance to the [[constitution of the United Kingdom|constitution of Great Britain]], are reduced by Swift to a difference in fashions.&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|31}}

The Emperor of Lilliput is described as a partisan of the Low-Heels, just as [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] employed only Whigs in his administration; the Emperor's heir is described as having "one of his heels higher than the other", which describes the encouragement by the Prince of Wales (the future [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]) of the political opposition during his father's life; once he ascended the throne, however, George II was as staunch a favourer of the Whigs as his father had been.&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|31}}{{clarify|reason=We are told the book was published in 1726, before George II ascended the throne in 1727, so the current wording misleads our readers by implying that his behaviour once on the throne is part of Swift's satire. But it's hard for me to fix this myself, as I am currently unable to easily check what the supposedly supporting citation actually says.|date=January 2018}}

[[File:Gulliver's_Travel.jpg|thumb|left|Gulliver inspecting the army of Lilliput]]The novel further describes an intra-Lilliputian quarrel over the practice of breaking eggs. Traditionally, Lilliputians broke boiled eggs on the larger end; a few generations ago, an Emperor of Lilliput, the Present Emperor's great-grandfather, had decreed that all eggs be broken on the smaller end after his son cut himself breaking the egg on the larger end. The differences between Big-Endians (those who broke their eggs at the larger end) and Little-Endians had given rise to "six rebellions... wherein one Emperor lost his life, and another his crown". The Lilliputian religion says an egg should be broken on the convenient end, which is now interpreted by the Lilliputians as the smaller end. The Big-Endians gained favour in Blefuscu.

[[File:Willmann, Colin, &amp; Outhwaite, Gulliver and the Emperor of Lilliput, cph.3b18907.jpg|thumb|left|Gulliver and the Emperor of Lilliput, from a French edition of ''Gulliver's Travels'' (1850s)]]
The Big-Endian/Little-Endian controversy reflects, in a much simplified form, British quarrels over religion. England had been, less than 200 years previously, a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] (Big-Endian) country; but a series of reforms beginning in the 1530s under [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] (ruled 1509–1547), [[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]] (1547–1553), and [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] (1558–1603) had converted most of the country to [[Protestantism]] (Little-Endianism), in the episcopalian form of the [[Church of England]]. At the same time, revolution and reform in Scotland (1560) had also converted that country to [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Protestantism, which led to fresh difficulties when England and Scotland were united under one ruler, [[James I of England|James I]] (1603–25).&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Religiously inspired revolts and rebellions followed, in which, indeed, one king, [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] (1625–49) lost his life, and his son [[James II of England|James II]] lost his crown and fled to France (1685–1688). Some of these conflicts were between Protestants and Catholics; others were between different branches of Protestantism. Swift does not clearly distinguish between these different kinds of religious strife.

Swift has his Lilliputian informant blame the "civil commotions" on the propaganda of the Emperor of Blefuscu, i.e. the King of France; this primarily reflects the encouragement given by King [[Louis XIV of France]] to James II in pursuit of his policies to advance the toleration of Catholicism in Great Britain. He adds that "when (the commotions) were quelled, the (Big-Endian) exiles always fled for refuge to that empire (Blefuscu/France)". This partially reflects the exile of [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] on the Continent (in France, Germany, the Spanish Netherlands, and the Dutch Republic) from 1651 to 1660, but more particularly the exile of the Catholic King James II from 1688–1701. James II was dead by the time Swift wrote ''Gulliver's Travels'', but his heir [[James Francis Edward Stuart]], also Catholic, maintained his pretensions to the British throne from a court in France (primarily at [[Saint-Germain-en-Laye]]) until 1717, and both Jameses were regarded as a serious threat to the stability of the British monarchy until the end of the reign of George II. The court of the Pretender attracted those [[Jacobitism|Jacobites]], and their Tory sympathizers, whose political activity precluded them staying safely in Great Britain; notable among them was Swift's friend, the Anglican Bishop of Rochester [[Francis Atterbury]], who was exiled to France in 1722.

Swift's Lilliputian claims that the machinations of "Big-Endian exiles" at the court of the Emperor of Blefuscu have brought about a continuous war between Lilliput and Blefuscu for "six and thirty moons" (Lilliputians calculate time in 'moons', not years; their time-scale, while not one-twelfth the size of normal humans, appears to be somewhat faster, since the emperor was stated to be "past his prime" before he was thirty.) This is an allusion to the wars fought under [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] against France under Louis XIV, the [[War of the Grand Alliance]] (1689–97) and the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–13).&lt;ref name=Greenberg1970/&gt;{{rp|30}} In both cases, the claims of the exiled House of Stuart were marginal to other causes of war, but were an important propaganda point in Great Britain itself, as both James II and James Francis Edward were accused of allying with foreigners to force Catholicism on the British people.

In the novel, Gulliver washes up on the shore of Lilliput and is captured by the inhabitants while asleep. He offers his services to the Emperor of Lilliput in his war against Blefuscu, and succeeds in capturing the (one-twelfth sized) Blefuscudian fleet. Despite a triumphant welcome, he soon finds himself at odds with the Emperor of Lilliput, as he declines to conquer the rest of Blefuscu for him and to force the Blefuscudians to adopt Little-Endianism.

Gulliver's position reflects the decision of the Tory government to withdraw from the War of the Spanish Succession. Britain's allies considered the important objects of the war to have been met, and that the larger claims which the Whigs claimed were excessive. The withdrawal was seen by the Whigs as a betrayal of British interests. Swift (a Tory) is here engaged in an apology.

Gulliver is, after further adventures, condemned as a traitor by the Council of Lilliput, and condemned to be blinded; he escapes his punishment by fleeing to Blefuscu. This condemnation parallels that issued to the chief ministers of the Tory government that had made peace with France, [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]], who was impeached and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]] from 1715 to 1717; and [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke]], who, after his political fall, received vague threats of capital punishment and fled to France in 1715, where he remained until 1723.

===Early history===
In chapter 4 of ''Gulliver's Travels'', Gulliver alludes to his plans to publish a treatise on the empire of Lilliput.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, chapter 4 ("a greater work, which is now almost ready for the press; containing a general description of this empire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes; with a particular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning, and religion; their plants and animals; their peculiar manners and customs, with other matters very curious and useful")&lt;/ref&gt; In 1728, [[John Arbuthnot]] wrote ''An account of the state of learning in the empire of Lilliput: Together with the history and character of Bullum the Emperor's Library-Keeper''; this purported to be transcribed from Gulliver's description. Arbuthnot used this work to satirise [[Richard Bentley]], master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The life of Richard Bentley, DD |last=Monk |first=James Henry Monk |authorlink=James Henry Monk |publisher=J. G. &amp; F. Rivington |location=London |year=1833 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lbIDAAAAYAAJ |page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also described the early history of Lilliput and Blefuscu. At one time (Gulliver is told), Blefuscu was a commonwealth and had its own language and an extensive literature. Lilliput, meanwhile, was divided among several petty kingdoms. The first emperor of Blefuscu attacked and subdued Lilliput, but later the Lilliputians won their independence and set up their own emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=An account of the state of learning in the empire of Lilliput: Together with the history and character of Bullum the Emperor's Library-Keeper |last=Arbuthnot |first=John |authorlink=John Arbuthnot |publisher=J.

===Post-Swift===
Winterfeld's sequel children's chapter book ''Castaways in Lilliput'' provides further details of Lilliputian history. The Emperor of Gulliver's time, Mully Ully Gue, is said to have reigned 1657–1746. (This contradicts Swift's account, in which the Emperor is only 28 years old and has reigned about seven years when Gulliver arrives in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt;) His descendant, Alice, is the reigning Queen in the 1950s when three Australian children visit the island.&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; The monetary system has apparently also been changed, the ''sprug'' of Swift's novel replaced by the ''onze'', equal to ten ''dimelings'' or 100 ''bims''.&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Technology has kept pace with the outside world, so the Lilliputians have trains, automobiles, helicopters, telephones, and telegraphs.

====Flag of Lilliput====
Winterfeld describes the flag of Lilliput as having blue and white stripes with a golden crown on a red field. These symbols are also painted on the police helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language===
Swift presents a number of Lilliputian words and phrases, and further states that the official languages of Lilliput and Blefuscu are about as far apart as typical European languages. Arbuthnot explains further that Blefuscu originally had its own language and an extensive literature, but during the period when it occupied Lilliput, the Blefuscudian language was much altered by contact with Lilliputian. Blefuscudian remained an old language of scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;Arbuthnot, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; In [[T. H. White]]'s sequel, ''[[Mistress Masham's Repose]]'', the protagonist Maria studies the Lilliputian language from a book owned by her professor friend. This is a rare copy of Gulliver's 1735 treatise: ''A General Description of the Empire of Lilliput, from its first Erection, through a long Series of Princes; with a Particular Account of their Wars and Politicks, Laws, Learning, &amp; Religion, their Plants and Animals, their peculiar Manners and Customs, with other Matters very curious and useful, to which is added a Brief Vocabulary of their Language, with its English Correspondencies''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mistress Masham's Repose]] |last=White |first=T. H. |authorlink=T. H. White |publisher= |location= |year=1946 |url= |page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Winterfeld's sequel, English has become the official language, due to a decision of the Council of the Island in 1751.&lt;ref&gt;Winterfeld, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lilliput House.jpg|right|thumb|Lilliput House, overlooking [[Lough Ennell]] in [[County Westmeath]] ]]

* Lilliput is reputedly named after the real area of Lilliput on the shores of [[Lough Ennell]] near Dysart, just a few miles from [[Mullingar]], in [[County Westmeath]], Ireland. Swift was a regular visitor to the [[Robert Rochfort|Rochfort]] family at Gaulstown House. It is said that it was when [[Dean (Christianity)|Dean]] Swift looked across the expanse of Lough Ennell one day and saw the tiny human figures on the opposite shore of the lake that he conceived the idea of the Lilliputians featured in ''Gulliver's Travels''. There is also an early Christian association – [[St. Patrick]]'s sister, Lupita, is known to the Lilliput area, which may recall her name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/product/?fid=FI_70862 Discover Ireland – The Belvedere Trail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928165359/http://www.discoverireland.com/za/ireland-things-to-see-and-do/listings/product/?fid=FI_70862 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the townland known from ancient times as Nure was renamed Lileput or Lilliput shortly after the publication of ''Gulliver's Travels'' in honour of Swift's association with the area. Lilliput House has stood in the locality since the Eighteenth Century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lilliputboathire.com/lilliput.htm Jonathan Swift Amenity Park, Lilliput]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lilliput and Blefuscu were the names used for Britain and France, respectively, in a series of semi-fictional transcripts (with mutated names of people and places) of debates in the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. This series was written by [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]], [[Samuel Johnson]], and [[John Hawkesworth (book editor)|John Hawkesworth]], and was printed in [[Edward Cave]]'s periodical ''[[The Gentleman's Magazine]]'' from 1738 to 1746.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samueljohnson.com/debates/ Samuel Johnson: The Parliamentary Debates / Debates in Parliament (Extracts)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040307131843/http://www.samueljohnson.com/debates/ |date=7 March 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word ''[[wikt:lilliputian|lilliputian]]'' has become an adjective meaning "very small in size", or "petty or trivial". When used as a noun, it means either "a tiny person" or "a person with a narrow outlook, who minds the petty and trivial things."
* The use of the terms "Big-Endian" and "Little-Endian" in the story is the source of the computing term ''[[endianness]]''.
* Neela Mahendra, the love interest in [[Sir Salman Rushdie]]'s novel [[Fury (Rushdie novel)|''Fury'']], is an "Indo-Lilly", a member of the Indian Diaspora from the politically unstable country of Lilliput-and-Blefuscu.
* Several [[Phobos (moon)#Craters on Phobos|craters]] on Mars' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]] are named after Lilliputians. Perhaps inspired by [[Johannes Kepler]] (and quoting [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]]), Swift's satire ''Gulliver's Travels'' refers to two moons in Part 3, Chapter 3 (the "Voyage to [[Laputa]]"), in which the astronomers of Laputa are described as having [[Moons of Mars#Early speculation|discovered two satellites of Mars]] orbiting at distances of 3 and 5 Martian diameters, and periods of 10 and 21.5 hours, respectively.&lt;ref name=galileo&gt;[http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath151/kmath151.htm MathPages – Galileo's Anagrams and the Moons of Mars].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Lilliput is mentioned throughout the 2005 ''Malplaquet'' trilogy of children's novels by Andrew Dalton.&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Andrew.''The Temples of Malplaquet''. Lutterworth Press 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-7188-3047-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Andrew. ''The Lost People of Malplaquet''. Lutterworth Press 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-7188-3050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dalton, Andrew. ''The New Empire of Malplaquet''. Lutterworth Press 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-7188-3093-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taking much of their initial inspiration from [[T. H. White]]'s ''[[Mistress Masham's Repose]]'', the books describe the adventures of a large colony of Lilliputians living secretly in the enormous and mysterious grounds of an English Country House ([[Stowe House]] in Buckinghamshire). Their longed-for return to their ancestral homeland is one of the major themes of the stories.
* In the ''[[Gabby (film series)|Gabby]]'' cartoon shorts, it is the main and only major location mentioned.

This is a list of the '''[[Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs) in the [[Ceredigion]]''' [[Area of Search]] (AOS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=County search of SSSIs|url=http://www.ccw.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/protecting-our-landscape/special-landscapes--sites/sites-search-results.aspx?lang=en|publisher=[[Countryside Council for Wales]]|accessdate=21 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305031552/http://www.ccw.gov.uk/landscape--wildlife/protecting-our-landscape/special-landscapes--sites/sites-search-results.aspx?lang=en|archivedate=5 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
SSSIs in the UK are [[SSSI notification|notified]] using the concept of an Area of Search, an area of between {{convert|400|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size.&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.11, p. 17. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Areas of Search were conceived and developed between 1975 and 1979 by the [[Nature Conservancy Council]] (NCC), based on regions created by the [[Local Government Act 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;Joint Nature Conservation Committee (1998 revision); ''Guidelines for the Selection of Biological SSSIs'', section 4.5, pp. 14–15. {{ISBN|1873701721}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas England had its Areas of Search based on 46 counties, those in Wales were based on a combination of the counties and smaller districts. In 1974, Wales was divided into 8 counties, with 37 [[Districts of Wales|districts]]. The NCC created 12 Welsh Areas of Search; they mostly follow county borders, but the larger counties ([[Dyfed]], [[Powys]] and [[Gwynedd]]) were divided into multiple Areas using district borders. [[Mid Glamorgan|Mid]] and [[South Glamorgan]] were merged into a single AOS, whilst [[Llanelli (district)|Llanelli district]] was included in the [[West Glamorgan]] AOS.

Due to subsequent local government reorganisation in the UK since 1972, many counties and districts have been divided, merged or renamed. Using the AOS system alone would make it difficult to search for individual SSSI citations via the [[Countryside Council for Wales]] (CCW) database without knowing 1972 region divisions. As a result, the CCW groups Welsh SSSIs using the [[Local government in Wales|subdivisions of Wales]] formed in April 1996 by the [[Local Government (Wales) Act 1994]], resulting in 22 [[Principal areas#Wales|principal areas]].

Ceredigion AOS lies within the county of [[Ceredigion]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="66579">The following is a list of [[bolide]]s and fireballs seen on Earth in 2017. These are small asteroids (known as [[meteoroid]]s) the regularly impact the Earth. Although most are so small that they burn up in the atmosphere before reaching the surface, some larger objects may reach the surface as fragments, known as [[meteorite]]s.

Meteors with a recorded [[absolute magnitude]] are then converted to an asteroidal absolute magnitude under (M&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = M&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + 31) and then converted to a diameter assuming that meteoroids brighten by approximate 10 magnitudes when entering the atmosphere. Objects reported only to the [[American Meteor Society]] are only listed if observed by at least 10 people, and are cross-referenced with [https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov https://fireballs.ndc.nasa.gov] if possible, to determine further physical characteristics. The fourth and third to last parameters are calculated from http://convertalot.com/asteroid_impact_calculator.html , assuming a density of 1.5 g/cm^3, an impact angle of 45°, and a velocity of 17&amp;nbsp;km/s (if not provided). The actual values for both may vary by as much as the value itself, so be aware that these values are only estimates.

'''Mare Nubium''' ("sea of clouds") is a [[lunar mare]] in the [[Nubium basin]] on the Moon's near side. The mare is located just to the southeast of [[Oceanus Procellarum]].

==Formation==
The basin containing Mare Nubium is believed to have been part of the [[Pre-Nectarian]] system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpod.org/cwm/DataStuff/Lunar%20Basins.htm Impact Basin Database]&lt;/ref&gt; The mare material is of the [[Imbrian]] and [[Eratosthenian]] age.&lt;ref&gt;Geologic Map of the Near Side of the Moon, USGS I-703, Don E. Wilhelms and John F. McCauley, 1971 ([http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/mapcatalog/usgs/I703/ L&amp;PI web version])&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Bullialdus (crater)|Bullialdus]] crater, a prominent feature on the west side of the mare, is of [[Eratosthenian]] age.&lt;ref name="arval"&gt;{{cite web
  |title=Observatorio ARVAL - Moon Map
  |publisher=Observatorio ARVAL
  |url=http://www.oarval.org/MoonMapen.htm
  |accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other features within the mare include [[Pitatus (crater)|Pitatus]] on the southern margin and [[Guericke (crater)|Guericke]] bounding the mare to the north. [[Opelt (crater)|Opelt]], [[Gould (crater)|Gould]], [[Kies (crater)|Kies]], [[Nicollet (crater)|Nicollet]], [[Wolf (crater)|Wolf]], [[Birt (crater)|Birt]], and [[Rupes Recta]] (the Straight Wall) lie within the mare.

==Names==
Like most of the other maria on the Moon, Mare Nubium was named by [[Giovanni Riccioli]], whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert]] had included it among the Continens Meridionalis ("Southern Continent") in his map of ''c''.1600,&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.15&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Michael Van Langren]] had labelled it the Mare Borbonicum (after the [[House of Bourbon]]) in his 1645 map.&lt;ref&gt;Ewen A. Whitaker, ''Mapping and Naming the Moon'' (Cambridge University Press, 1999), p.41, 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exploration==
The first released images from the [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] in 2009 were of the lunar highlands 200 km south of Mare Nubium.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:NEQUA.jpg|thumb|inside front cover of ''NEQUA or the Problem of the Ages'']]
'''''NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages''''', according to Reginald's Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Literature 1700–1974,&lt;ref&gt;Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy Literature 1700–1974, Reginald, Robert, Gale Research Co. 1979, {{ISBN|0810310511}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the first [[feminist science fiction]] books published in the United States. It was first serialized in the newspaper ''Equity''. Two editions were published in Topeka Kansas in 1900. The title page lists Jack Adams &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfencyclopedia.com/entry/adams_jack|title=Authors : Adams, Jack : SFE : Science Fiction Encyclopedia|work=sfencyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the author. Jack Adams is a pseudonym.

== Plot ==
In the body of the work it is revealed that Jack Adams is actually a woman (Cassie) dressing in men’s clothing, who has spent several years searching for her betrothed on various ocean voyages. She is so successful in her masquerade as a male that she actually works for the ship captains. The voyage described in Nequa is to the Arctic, where the ship becomes trapped in the ice. After several harrowing adventures the ship is freed and then proceeds to sail north. The Captain of the ship, Rafael Ganoa ( Cassie’s  betrothed) is amazed to find that when they reach a certain spot, which should be close to the north pole, the compasses show that the ship is suddenly traveling south.

Actually they have sailed into the inside of the earth, where they meet the Altrurians, a society which has developed into a more cooperative society than those on the outside of the earth.  Individual members of the Altrurian Society describe how the evolution of Altrurian society took place. These explanations reflect Populist thought of the time with definite feminist proclivities, providing the tone of a [[political novel]].

Jack Adams exposes his/her secret and is chastised by her betrothed Captain Ganoe as having broken several conventions that exist among the outer earth society. Jack Adams/Cassie Van Ness now called Nequa (the teacher) takes a manuscript that she has written about this voyage and leaves in one of the new aeroplanes for the outside world to have the manuscript you have been reading, published.

== History ==
Compilations which have include information about Nequa, have resulted in misunderstandings about the authorship of the book. The article "New World That Eve Made: Feminist Utopias Written by Nineteenth-Century Women"  authored by Barbara Quissell which appeared in Kenneth Roemers’ ''America as Utopia''&lt;ref&gt;''America as Utopia'', Roemer, Kenneth M., Burt Franklin Publisher, 1980, {{ISBN|0891021698}},&lt;/ref&gt; discusses A. O. Grigsby as a woman writer.

"In Science-Fiction, the early years: A full description of more than 3000 stories",&lt;ref&gt;''Science-Fiction The Early Years'', Bleiler, E. F., Kent State University Press, 1991, {{ISBN|0873384164}}, page 3&lt;/ref&gt; Everett Franklin [[Bleiler]] gives a synopsis and lists the authors as Alcanoan O. Grigsby, a male, and Mary P. Lowe, a female.

A. O. Grigsby (Alconoan O. Grigsby) was a [[Populist]] and later a Socialist who was editor of several newspapers from the 1890s through 1900. Mary P. Lowe was an editor of ''The New Woman'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kshs.org/newspaper/newspaper_reels/search/city:Topeka/title:New%20Woman/county:SN/state:KS/begyr:/endyr:/arrange:title/submit:SEARCH|title=Newspapers on Microfilm|work=kshs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[women’s suffrage]] paper and co-editor with A. O. Grigsby of "Equity", a Populist newspaper, complete editions of which are available on microfilm from the Kansas State Historical Society.

The first edition of ''NEQUA'' listed A.O. Grigsby and Mary P. Lowe as the copyright holders. There was also an explanation printed in the first edition which credits Dr. T. A. H. Lowe with the original ideas found in ''NEQUA''.

Dr. T. A. H. Lowe studied [[Eclectic Medicine]] at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;''A Profile in Alternative Medicine: The Eclectic Medical College of Cincinnati, 1835-1942'', Haller,John S., Kent State University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0585262209}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''NEQUA'' contains many ideas which are similar to other [[hollow earth]] books, particularly one titled ''[[Mizora]]''.  ''[[Mizora]]'' first appeared in serialized form in the ''Cincinnati Commercial'', a newspaper, while Dr. Lowe was enrolled at the Eclectic Medical Institute. 
Two other Eclectic Physicians also wrote [[subterranean fiction]].

[[John Uri Lloyd]] was a teacher in the Pharmacy Department at the Eclectic Medical Institute in Cincinnati. He wrote ''[[Etidorhpa]]''  which had elements of secret Masonic rituals and alchemy  woven throughout the book.  [[Cyrus Teed]]  was also an Eclectic Institute physician who preached the existence of a world inside of the earth. He became leader of [[Koreshanity]] which built a commune in Florida.

According to Worldcat&lt;ref&gt;Worldcat OCLC 14067001&lt;/ref&gt; ''NEQUA'' in printed form is only owned by eleven libraries. Out of print for 115 years, interest in its political, social&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sfsite.com/fsf/2013/cur1307.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and economic systems have reappeared on the &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesymzonian.wordpress.com/2012/12/17/nequa-or-narratorial-reliability-in-a-utopia/|title=Nequa, or, Narratorial Reliability in a Utopia|work=A Study of the Hollow Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; internet.
A third edition,&lt;ref&gt;Worlcat 898746905  {{ISBN|978-0-9910895-0-5}}
&lt;/ref&gt; published in 2015 by Green Snake Press, includes a new introduction and an epilogue, consisting of background material about the persons originally involved in the writing and publishing of ''NEQUA''. The original copyright was held by newspaper editors and publishers who were political organizers using the printed word to further their political cause. ''NEQUA'' was published online &lt;ref&gt;{{Gutenberg | no=55505 | name=NEQUA or The Problem of the Ages}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2017.

The '''Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument''' is a marine [[national monument (United States)|national monument of the United States]] off the coast of [[New England]], on the edge of [[Georges Bank]]. It was created by President [[Barack Obama]] on September 15, 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/21/2016-22921/northeast-canyons-and-seamounts-marine-national-monument|title=Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument|date=2016-09-21|work=Federal Register|access-date=2017-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the first U.S. national marine monument in the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/09/northeast_canyons_seamounts_martine_national_monument_map.pdf |title=Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument | publisher=The Pew Charitable Trusts | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/obama-create-first-marine-national-monument-atantic-n648686 "Obama to Create First Marine National Monument in the Atlantic"] ''NBC News'', 15 September 2016, Accessed 16 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
President [[Barack Obama]] designated the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument (NCSMNM) on September 21, 2016, using the [[Antiquities Act|Antiquities Act of 1906]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is the first and only Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It was created in response to citizens requesting for area in the Northeast Atlantic to be protected, due to its importance as a biodiversity hotspot, habitat for numerous rare and endangered species, and a valuable scientific and historical site.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/15/fact-sheet-president-obama-continue-global-leadership-combatting-climate|title=FACT SHEET: President Obama to Continue Global Leadership in Combatting Climate Change and Protecting Our Ocean by Creating the First Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean|last=|first=|date=September 15, 2016|website=obamawhitehouse.archives.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal considerations ==
According to President Barack Obama in the Federal Register,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is the smallest area feasible to provide necessary management; designating a smaller zone would lead to an inaccurate interpretation and protection of biodiversity within the fragile area. The designation of the Marine National Monument occurred after numerous meetings and deliberations with stakeholders including conservationists, community members, fishermen, and local businesses; administrative officials gathered social, economic, and environmental data to inform the creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Residing at depths of ~4,000 meters, [[Deep-water coral|deep sea corals]] and other foundational species are highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbances such as bottom trawling and mining extractions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The objective of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is to maintain biodiversity for research, while encouraging and providing support to fisheries to become more efficient, resilient, and sustainable.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/mediacenter/2016/september/22_northeast_canyons_and_seamounts_faq.html|title=Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument FAQs|last=|first=|date=|website=greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three years, following the creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] and [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] will administer a management plan for the area, adapting to requests and changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretaries-pritzker-jewell-applaud-presidents-designation-northeast-canyons-and|title=Secretaries Pritzker, Jewell Applaud President’s Designation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument|last=|first=|date=September 15, 2016|website=doi.gov/pressreleases|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholders will continue to be engaged throughout the process through meetings with administrators.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Five commercial fishing industries, Massachusetts Lobstermen’s Association, Atlantic Offshore Lobstermen’s Association, Long Island Commercial Fishing Association, Garden State Seafood Association, and Rhode Island Fishermen’s Alliance, took the creation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument to court in the beginning of March 2017.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://earthjustice.org/sites/default/files/files/Memorandum%20on%20motion%20to%20intervene.pdf|title=THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA:Memorandum of Law in Support of Defendant Intervenor Applicants’ Motion to Intervene |last=|first=|date=March 29, 2017|website=earthjustice.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=3 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They state that President Barack Obama did not have the right to designate the Marine National Monument under the Antiquities Act.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;In a legal document published on March 29, 2017, it was stated that the fishermen do not want any restrictions on their industries, and argue that the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is unlawful and harmful to their businesses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The final designation of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument protects 40% of the originally proposed area, after intense deliberation, considering equity to those affected.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Areas within the Marine National Monument will remain open to recreational fishing and all military activity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequent to the creation of the Marine National Monument, a 60-day transition period was allowed for all commercial industries, besides the Atlantic Lobster and Deep-Sea Red Crab fisheries, which are permitted to continue fishing in the area for seven years after the creation of the monument.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In order to evolve fishing industries into sustainable businesses, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will provide commercial fisheries with access to updated vessels and equipment, increasing efficiency and minimizing cost. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will also provide beneficial services to commercial fisheries, such as stock assessments and marine surveys.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
On 5 October 2018, a judge ruled that the Monument complied with the law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/overnights/410154-overnight-energy-judge-upholds-obamas-marine-monument thehill.com] ('Judge upholds Obama's marine monument']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and geology==
The Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument is located within the New England and mid-Atlantic regions, 130 miles southeast of [[Cape Cod]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It comprises a total area of 4,913 square miles,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and protects several underwater [[seamount]]s ([[Bear Seamount|Bear]], [[Mytilus Seamount|Mytilus]], [[Physalia Seamount|Physalia]], and [[Retriever Seamount]]s) and three [[submarine canyon]]s in the edge of the continental shelf (Oceanographer, Lydonia, and Gilbert).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretaries-pritzker-jewell-applaud-presidents-designation-northeast-canyons-and | website = [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] | date = September 15, 2016 | title = Secretaries Pritzker, Jewell Applaud President’s Designation of Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
The area is home to rare and [[endangered species]], including [[sperm whale]]s, [[fin whale]]s, [[sei whale]]s and [[Kemp’s ridley sea turtle]]s.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite press release | url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2016/09/15/fact-sheet-president-obama-continue-global-leadership-combatting-climate | title=FACT SHEET: President Obama to Continue Global Leadership in Combatting Climate Change and Protecting Our Ocean by Creating the First Marine National Monument in the Atlantic Ocean |publisher=[[WhiteHouse.gov]] |date=15 September 2016 | accessdate=15 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuclear energy policy''' is a national and international [[policy]] concerning some or all aspects of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], such as [[uranium mining]], ore concentration, conversion, [[Enriched uranium|enrichment]] for [[nuclear fuel]], [[electricity generation|generating electricity]] by [[nuclear power]], storing and [[nuclear fuel reprocessing|reprocessing]] [[spent nuclear fuel]], and disposal of [[radioactive waste]].

Nuclear energy policies often include the regulation of energy use and standards relating to the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. Other measures include efficiency standards, safety regulations, [[emission standard]]s, [[fiscal policy|fiscal policies]], and [[legislation]] on energy trading, transport of [[nuclear waste]] and [[contamination|contaminated]] materials, and their storage.  Governments might subsidize nuclear energy and arrange international treaties and trade agreements about the import and export of [[nuclear technology]], [[electricity]], [[nuclear waste]], and [[uranium]].

Since about 2001 the term [[nuclear renaissance]] has been used to refer to a possible [[nuclear power]] industry revival, but nuclear electricity generation in 2012 was at its lowest level since 1999.&lt;ref name=wna13/&gt;&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;[http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf104.html The Nuclear Renaissance (by the World Nuclear Association)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the March 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs.

Since nuclear energy and [[nuclear weapon]]s technologies are closely related, [[military]] aspirations can act as a factor in energy policy decisions. The fear of [[nuclear proliferation]] influences some international nuclear energy policies.

After 1986's [[Chernobyl disaster]], public fear of nuclear power led to a virtual halt in reactor construction, and several countries decided to phase out nuclear power altogether.&lt;ref name=res&gt;[https://archive.is/20130201052835/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS101123+06-May-2009+BW20090506 Research and Markets: International Perspectives on Energy Policy and the Role of Nuclear Power] ''Reuters'', May 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[World energy resources and consumption|increasing energy demand]] was believed to require new sources of electric power, and rising [[Price of petroleum|fossil fuel prices]] coupled with concerns about [[greenhouse gas]] emissions (see [[Climate change mitigation]]) have sparked heightened interest in nuclear power and predictions of a [[nuclear renaissance]].

In 2004, the largest producer of nuclear energy was the [[United States]] with 28% of worldwide capacity, followed by France (18%) and Japan (12%).&lt;ref name=wec&gt;{{cite journal | title = Survey of energy resources | publisher = [[World Energy Council]] | year = 2004 | url = http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2004.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 2007-07-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070925194158/http://www.worldenergy.org/documents/ser2004.pdf | archivedate = 2007-09-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, 31 countries operated nuclear power plants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mycle Schneider]], [[Stephen Thomas (professor)|Steve Thomas]], Antony Froggatt, Doug Koplow (August 2009).

===Nuclear concerns===
{{Main|Nuclear power debate}}
[[Nuclear accidents]] and [[High-level radioactive waste management|radioactive waste disposal]] are major concerns.&lt;ref name = bm/&gt; Other concerns include [[nuclear proliferation]], the [[Economics of new nuclear power plants|high cost of nuclear power plants]], and [[nuclear terrorism]].&lt;ref name = bm&gt;[[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]].

===Energy security===
For some countries, nuclear power affords energy independence. In the words of the French, "We have no [[coal]], we have no [[petroleum|oil]], we have no [[natural gas|gas]], we have no choice."&lt;ref name=platts/&gt; Japan—similarly lacking in indigenous natural resources for power supply—relied on nuclear power for 1/3 of its energy mix prior to the Fukushima nuclear disaster; since March 2011, Japan has sought to offset the loss of nuclear power with increased reliance on imported liquefied natural gas, which has led to the country's first trade deficits in decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nbr.org/research/activity.aspx?id=352 How Can Japan Compete in a Changing Global Market?, Clara Gillispie, The National Bureau of Asian Research, July 201&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the discussion of a future for nuclear energy is intertwined with a discussion of [[energy security]] and the use of energy mix, including [[renewable energy development]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

Proponents  have long made inflated projections of the expected growth of nuclear power, but major accidents and high costs have kept growth much lower.  In 1973 and 1974, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] predicted a worldwide installed nuclear capacity of 3,600 to 5,000 gigawatts by 2000. The IAEA's 1980 projection was for 740 to 1,075 gigawatts of installed capacity by the year 2000.  Even after the 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], the [[Nuclear Energy Agency]] forecasted an installed nuclear capacity of 497 to 646 gigawatts for the year 2000.  The actual capacity in 2000 was 356 gigawatts.  Moreover, construction costs have often been much higher, and times much longer than projected, failing to meet optimistic projections of “unlimited cheap, clean, and safe electricity.”&lt;ref name=mycles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/68/5/8.abstract?etoc |title=2011-2012 world nuclear industry status report |author=[[Mycle Schneider]] and [[Antony Froggatt]] |date=September/October 2012 vol. 68 no. 5 |work=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages=8–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Nuclear Association]] has reported that “nuclear power generation suffered its biggest ever one-year fall through 2012 as the bulk of the Japanese fleet remained offline for a full calendar year”. Data from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] showed that nuclear power plants globally produced 2346 TWh of electricity in 2012 – seven per cent less than in 2011. The figures illustrate the effects of a full year of 48 Japanese power reactors producing no power during the year. The permanent closure of eight reactor units in Germany was also a factor. Problems at Crystal River, Fort Calhoun and the two San Onofre units in the USA meant they produced no power for the full year, while in Belgium Doel 3 and Tihange 2 were out of action for six months. Compared to 2010, the nuclear industry produced 11% less electricity in 2012.&lt;ref name=wna13&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Nuclear_power_down_in_2012_2006131.html |title=Nuclear power down in 2012 |author=WNA |date=20 June 2013 |work=World Nuclear News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been mass protests against the French-backed 9900 MW [[Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project]] in Maharashtra and the 2000 MW [[Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant]] in Tamil Nadu. The state government of West Bengal state has also refused permission to a proposed 6000 MW facility near the town of Haripur that intended to host six Russian reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasentinel.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3889&amp;Itemid=614 |title=India's Rising Nuclear Safety Concerns |author=Siddharth Srivastava |date=27 October 2011 |work=Asia Sentinel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is little support across the world for building new nuclear reactors, a 2011 poll for the BBC indicates. The global research agency [[GlobeScan]], commissioned by BBC News, polled 23,231 people in 23 countries from July to September 2011, several months after the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]]. In countries with existing nuclear programmes, people are significantly more opposed than they were in 2005, with only the UK and US bucking the trend. Most believe that boosting energy efficiency and renewable energy can meet their needs.&lt;ref name=rb2011&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15864806 |title=Nuclear power 'gets little public support worldwide' |author=Richard Black  |date=25 November 2011 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Just 22% agreed that "nuclear power is relatively safe and an important source of electricity, and we should build more nuclear power plants". In contrast, 71% thought their country "could almost entirely replace coal and nuclear energy within 20 years by becoming highly energy-efficient and focusing on generating energy from the Sun and wind". Globally, 39% want to continue using existing reactors without building new ones, while 30% would like to shut everything down now.&lt;ref name=rb2011/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the March 2011 [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]], China, Germany, Switzerland, Israel, Malaysia, Thailand, United Kingdom, and the Philippines are reviewing their nuclear power programs. Indonesia and Vietnam still plan to build nuclear power plants.&lt;ref name="Jo Chandler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Aubrey Belford"/&gt;&lt;ref name="piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="news.xinhuanet.com"/&gt;  Countries such as Australia, Austria, Denmark, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, New Zealand, and Norway remain opposed to nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18441163 |title=Nuclear power: When the steam clears |date=March 24, 2011 |work=The Economist |page= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to environmentalism:

'''[[Environmentalism]]''' &amp;ndash; broad philosophy, ideology&lt;ref&gt;http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/progress/ideology.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://reason.com/archives/2002/02/01/debunking-green-myths&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Gibson. Environmentalism: Ideology and Power. Nova Science Pub Inc. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and [[social movement]] regarding concerns for environmental [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and improvement of the health of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], particularly as the measure for this health seeks to incorporate the concerns of non-human elements. Environmentalism advocates the preservation, restoration and/or improvement of the natural environment, and may be referred to as a movement to control [[pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/environmentalism&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|limit=2}}

== What ''type'' of thing is environmentalism? ==

Environmentalism can be described as all of the following:

* a [[philosophy]] &amp;ndash; the study of knowledge and the nature of life
** an [[environmental philosophy]] &amp;ndash; a branch of philosophy that studies the fundamental workings of human's relation to the environment and our place in it 
** a branch of [[ethics]] &amp;ndash; environmentalism concerns moral relationships and the intrinsic value of both humans and the environment 
*** a branch of [[environmental ethics]] &amp;ndash;  environmental ethics describes the moral aspects that connect humans and non humans concerning the environment and what obligations human species have to non human species&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2016/entries/ethics-environmental/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Brennan|first=Andrew|last2=Lo|first2=Yeuk-Sze|date=2016-01-01|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Fall 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ideology]] &amp;ndash; a system of ideas that focus on environmental thought and form how one thinks about maintaining the environment 
* [[Political movement]] &amp;ndash; environmentalists seek to both change and create policy concerning environmental issues in order to protect the environment from further harm 
** [[Social movement]] &amp;ndash; as a collective group environmentalists seek to create social environmental change and protect environmental liberties through both radical and non radical ecological groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Riordan|first=T.|date=1977-01-01|title=Environmental Ideologies|url=http://epn.sagepub.com/content/9/1/3|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3–14|doi=10.1068/a090003|issn=0308-518X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental movement ==

[[Environmental movement]]
* [[Conservation movement]] &amp;ndash; seeks to protect natural areas for [[sustainable consumption]], as well as traditional (hunting, fishing, trapping) and spiritual use.
** [[Environmental conservation]] &amp;ndash; process in which one is involved in conserving the natural aspects of the environment. Whether through [[reforestation]], [[recycling]], or pollution control, environmental conservation sustains the natural quality of life.
* [[Environmental health]] movement &amp;ndash; dates at least to [[Progressive Era]], and focuses on urban standards like clean water, efficient sewage handling, and stable population growth. Environmental health could also deal with [[nutrition]], [[preventive medicine]], [[aging]], and other concerns specific to human well-being. Environmental health is also seen as an indicator for the state of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], or an early warning system for what may happen to humans
* [[Environmental justice]] &amp;ndash; movement that began in the U.S. in the 1980s and seeks an end to [[environmental racism]] and prevent low-income and minority communities from an unbalanced exposure to highways, garbage dumps, and factories. The Environmental Justice movement seeks to link "social" and "ecological" environmental concerns, while at the same time preventing [[de facto]] racism, and classism. This makes it particularly adequate for the construction of labor-environmental alliances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a912901178 ''Uniting to Win: Labor-Environmental Alliances'', by Dan Jakopovich]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ecology movement]] &amp;ndash; involves the [[Gaia theory (science)|Gaia Theory]], as well as [[Value of Earth]] and other interactions between humans, science, and responsibility.
** [[Deep Ecology]] &amp;ndash; ideological spinoff of the ecology movement that views the diversity and integrity of the planetary ecosystem, in and for itself, as its primary value.
* [[Bright green environmentalism]] &amp;ndash; currently popular sub-movement that emphasizes the idea that through technology, good design and more thoughtful use of energy and resources, people can live responsible, sustainable lives while enjoying prosperity.
* [[Anti-nuclear movement]] &amp;ndash; opposes the use of various [[nuclear technology|nuclear technologies]].
**  Positions
*** [[Nuclear disarmament]]
*** Opposes the use of [[nuclear power]]
**[[List of anti-nuclear groups|Anti-nuclear groups]]
*** [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]
*** [[Friends of the Earth]]
*** [[Greenpeace]]

The '''Pliensbachian''' is an [[age (geology)|age]] of the [[geologic timescale]] and [[stage (stratigraphy)|stage]] in the stratigraphic column. It is part of the [[Early Jurassic|Early or Lower Jurassic]] [[epoch (geology)|epoch]] or [[series (stratigraphy)|series]] and spans the time between 190.8 ± 1.5 [[annum|Ma]] and 182.7 ± 1.5 Ma (million years ago).&lt;ref name="benton, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Benton|first=Michael J.|title=Prehistoric Life|year=2012|publisher=Dorling Kindersley|location=Edinburgh, Scotland|isbn=978-0-7566-9910-9|pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pliensbachian is preceded by the [[Sinemurian]] and followed by the [[Toarcian]].&lt;ref&gt;See Gradstein ''et al.'' (2004) for a detailed geologic timescale&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drzewica Formation Reconstruction.jpg|right|thumb|Example of a Pliensbachian ecosystem, the [[Drzewica Formation]] of [[Szydłowiec]] in [[Poland]], characterised by a very damp ecosystem, populated by dinosaur megafauna]]
The Pliensbachian ended with the [[extinction event]] called the [[Toarcian turnover]]. During the Pliensbachian, the middle part of the [[Lias Group|Lias]] was deposited in Europe. The Pliensbachian is roughly coeval with the [[Charmouthian]] regional stage of [[North America]].

==Stratigraphic definitions==
The Pliensbachian takes its name from the hamlet of [[Pliensbach]] in the community of [[Zell unter Aichelberg]] in the [[Swabian Alb]], some 30&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Stuttgart]] in [[Germany]]. The name was introduced into scientific literature by German palaeontologist [[Albert Oppel]] in 1858.

The base of the Pliensbachian is at the first appearances of the ammonite species ''[[Bifericeras|Bifericeras donovani]]'' and [[genus|genera]] ''[[Apoderoceras]]'' and ''[[Gleviceras]]''. The Wine Haven profile near [[Robin Hood's Bay]] ([[Yorkshire]], [[England]]) has been appointed as global reference profile for the base ([[GSSP]]).&lt;ref&gt;Meister ''et al.'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The top of the Pliensbachian (the base of the Toarcian stage) is at the first appearance of ammonite genus ''[[Eodactylites]]''.

===Biostratigraphy===
[[File:Pleuroceras spinatum MHNT.PAL.CEP.2001.86.jpg|right|thumb|''Pleuroceras spinatum'' [[:fr:Muséum de Toulouse|Museum of Toulouse]]]]
The Pliensbachian contains five ammonite [[biozone]]s in the [[boreal domain]]:
*zone of ''[[Pleuroceras spinatum]]''
*zone of ''[[Amaltheus|Amaltheus margaritatus]]''
*zone of ''[[Prodactylioceras|Prodactylioceras davoei]]''
*zone of ''[[Tragophylloceras|Tragophylloceras ibex]]''
*zone of ''[[Uptonia|Uptonia jamesoni]]''

In the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethys domain]], the Pliensbachian contains six biozones:
*zone of ''[[Emaciaticeras|Emaciaticeras emaciatum]]''
*zone of ''[[Arieticeras|Arieticeras algovianum]]''
*zone of ''[[Fuciniceras|Fuciniceras lavinianum]]''
*zone of ''Prodactylioceras davoei''
*zone of ''Tragophylloceras ibex''
*zone of ''Uptonia jamesoni''

'''Soil nailing''' is a [[construction]] remedial measure to treat unstable natural soil slopes or as a construction technique that allows the safe over-steepening of new or existing soil slopes. The technique involves the insertion of relatively slender reinforcing elements into the slope – often general purpose [[rebar|reinforcing bars]] (rebar) although proprietary solid or hollow-system bars are also available. Solid bars are usually installed into pre-drilled holes and then [[grout]]ed into place using a separate grout line, whereas hollow bars may be drilled and grouted simultaneously by the use of a [[Sacrificial part|sacrificial]] [[drill bit]] and by pumping grout down the hollow bar as drilling progresses. Kinetic methods of firing relatively short bars into soil slopes have also been developed. Bars installed using drilling techniques are usually fully grouted and installed at a slight downward inclination with bars installed at regularly spaced points across the slope face. A rigid facing (often pneumatically applied [[concrete]], otherwise known as [[shotcrete]]) or isolated soil nail head plates may be used at the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Goldstein |first1=Natalie |date=Sep–Oct 2001 |title=Soil Nailing |journal=Erosion Control |volume=8 |issue=6 |pages= |publisher=Forester Media |url=http://www.erosioncontrol.com/september-october-2001/soil-nailing-construction.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710200250/http://www.erosioncontrol.com/september-october-2001/soil-nailing-construction.aspx |archive-date=2011-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively a flexible reinforcing mesh may be held against the soil face beneath the head plates. Rabbit proof wire mesh and environmental erosion control fabrics and may be used in conjunction with flexible mesh facing where environmental conditions dictate.

Soil nail components may also be used to stabilize [[retaining wall]]s or existing fill [[Grade (slope)|slopes]] ([[Embankment (transportation)|embankments]] and [[levee]]s); this is normally undertaken as a remedial measure.

Since its first application using modern techniques in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1972,&lt;ref&gt;"Construction d'un mur de soutènement entre Versailles-Chantiers et Versailles-Matelots", S. Rabejac and P. Toudic, General review of the railways, 93rd edition, pp 232-237.&lt;/ref&gt; soil nailing is now a well-established technique around the world. One of the first national guideline publications for soil nailing was produced in Japan in 1987.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} The U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] issued guideline publications in 1996&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"&gt;{{cite report |author= |date=October 1998 |title=Manual for Design and Construction Monitoring of Soil Nail Walls |url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/engineering/geotech/library_arc.cfm?pub_number=160 |publisher=U.S. Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) |location=Washington, D.C. |id=FHWA-SA-96-069}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2003.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"&gt;{{cite report |author= |date=2003 |title=Geotechnical Engineering Circular No. 7: Soil Nail Walls |url=http://isddc.dot.gov/OLPFiles/FHWA/016917.pdf |publisher=FHWA |id=FHWA-IF-03-017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preliminary Analysis ==
Four main points to be considered in determining if soil nailing would be an effective retention technique are as follows. First, the existing ground conditions should be examined. Next, the advantages and disadvantages for a soil nail wall should be assessed for the particular application being considered. Then other systems should be considered for the particular application. Finally, cost of the soil nail wall should be considered.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|13–14}} Soil nail walls can be used for a variety of soil types and conditions.  The most favorable conditions for soil nailing are as follows: The soil should be able to stand unsupported one to two meters high for a minimum of two days when cut vertical or nearly vertical. Also all soil nails within a cross section should be located above the [[groundwater table]]. If the soil nails are not located above the groundwater table, the groundwater should not negatively affect the face of the excavation, the bond between the ground and the soil nail itself.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|14–15}} Based upon these favorable conditions for soil nailing stiff to hard fine-grained soils which include stiff to hard clays, clayey silts, silty clays, sandy clays, and sandy silts are preferred soils. Sand and gravels which are dense to very dense soils with some apparent cohesion also work well for soil nailing. Weathered rock is also acceptable as long as the rock is weathered evenly throughout (meaning no weakness planes). Finally, glacial soils work well for soil nailing.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;

A list of unfavorable or difficult soil conditions for soil nailing can include dry, poorly graded cohesion-less soils, soils with a high groundwater table, soils with cobbles and boulders, soft to very soft fine-grained soils, highly corrosive soils, weathered rock with unfavorable weakness planes, and loess.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}} Other difficult conditions include prolonged exposure to freezing temperatures, a climate that has a repeated freeze-and-thaw cycle, and granular soils that are very loose.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|16}}

== Origins ==
Soil nailing evolved from the [[New Austrian tunnelling method]], which is a system for underground excavations in rock. This method consists of passive steel reinforcement in the rock followed by the application of reinforced shotcrete. This concept of combining passive steel reinforcement and shotcrete has also been applied to the stabilization of rock slopes since the early 1960s.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|23}}

The first application of soil nailing was implemented in 1972 for a railroad widening project near [[Versailles (city)|Versailles, France]]. Soil nails were used to stabilize an {{convert|18|m|ft}} high slope consisting of sandy soil.  This method proved to be more cost-effective, while at the same time cut down the construction time when compared to other conventional support methods.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|23}} Germany was the next country to investigate soil nailing. From 1975 to 1981 the [[University of Karlsruhe (TH)|University of Karlsruhe]] and the construction company Bauer collaborated to establish a research program.  This program conducted full-scale testing of experimental walls with different configurations and developed analysis procedures for use in design.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|23}} The United States first used soil nailing in 1976 for the support of a {{convert|13.7|m|ft}} deep foundation excavation in dense silty sands. Soil nailing was implemented in the expansion of The Good Samaritan Hospital in [[Portland, Oregon]]. This retaining system was produced in approximately half the time at about 85% of the cost of conventional retaining systems.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|24}}

In the 1980s, the late Professor Ron Bridle, who served as Britain’s Chief Highway Engineer between 1975 and 1980, conceived a novel way of undertaking the soil nailing process which involved firing the nails from the barrel of a compressed air cannon. Working with what is now [[Cardiff University]], Professor Bridle and his co-inventors, Colin Campbell, Professor Ben Barr (deceased) and Bernard Myles, submitted a patent application in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Patents Granted: ''EP0239258B1'' (Ron Bridle) March 1991; ''EP0540060B1'' (Colin Campbell; Ben Barr; Ron Bridle; Bernard Myles) 1995&lt;/ref&gt;  This method was based on using a compressed air cannon, which could accelerate a 40mm diameter, 6m long steel tube (nail) to speeds up to 400&amp;nbsp;km/hr in a single shot. The significant advantage of this innovation was that it was typically cheaper and faster than the conventional soil nailing process.

The ballistic soil nailer apparatus was developed from a declassified British military cannon originally developed for military applications by [[Ferranti|Ferranti International Plc]]. Cardiff University and Ferranti entered into a cross-licensing agreement in 1989 to facilitate the commercial development of the ballistic soil nailing technique.  Cardiff University, through its Technology Transfer company, University College Cardiff Consultants Limited (UC3) entered into a partnership with a local company, Ryan International Limited to commercialise the technology.

Subsequent commercial activity culminated in UC3 assigning the soil nailing patents to a French multinational, civil engineering company, Terre Armee Internationale (TAI) in May 1996.  During this time the ballistic soil nailing technology was used commercially, but when TAI was acquired by another French company, Freyssinet, the ballistic soil nailing patents were reassigned to UC3, by an agreement dated September 2000.  In the same year, a UK company, Soil Nailing Limited UK was established by Bernard Myles to use the ballistic soil nailing process commercially and to further develop the technology, which included a collaboration with the Sumitomo Corporation of Japan.

The ballistic soil nailing process originally conceived by the late Professor Ron Bridle has been used successfully throughout the USA, Canada and New Zealand.  Further examples of its use in Cairns, Australia (on a number of road and construction projects) is provided in a paper authored by Andrew McIlveen, Director McIlveen Ford Consultants Pty Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Ballistic Nail Soiling - Department of Transport and Main Roads&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
After a preliminary analysis of the site, initial designs of the soil nail wall can be begin. This begins with a selection of [[Limit state design|limit states]] and design approaches. The two most common limit states used in soil nail wall design is strength limit and service limit states.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|77}} The strength limit state is the limit state that addresses potential failure mechanisms or collapse states of the soil nail wall system.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|77}} The service limit state is the limit state that addresses loss of service function resulting from excessive wall deformation and is defined by restrictions in stress, deformation and facing crack width under regular service conditions.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|77}} The two most common design approaches for soil nail walls are [[limit state design]] and service load design.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|77}}

Initial design considerations include wall layout (wall height and length), soil nail vertical and horizontal spacing, soil nail pattern on wall face, soil nail inclination, soil nail length and distribution, soil nail material and relevant ground properties.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|123}} With all these variables in the mind of the design engineer the next step is to use simplified charts to preliminarily evaluate nail length and maximum nail force. Nail length, diameter and spacing typically control external and internal stability of the wall. These parameters can be adjusted during design until all external and internal stability requirements are met.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|130}} After the initial design is completed, final design progresses where the soil nail wall has to be tested for external and internal failure modes, seismic considerations and aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|144}} Drainage, frost penetration and external loads such as wind and hydrostatic forces also have to be determined and included in the final examination of the design.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|144}} Soil nail walls are not ideal in locations with highly plastic clay soils.  Soils with high plasticity, a high liquid limit and low undrained shear strengths are at risk of long-term deformation (creep).&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|144}}

== Construction ==
With the design complete, construction is the next step. Most soil nail wall construction follows a specific procedure. First a cut is excavated and temporary bracing is put in place if necessary. This is done with conventional earth moving equipment and hydraulic [[drills]].&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|33}} Next, holes for the soil nails are drilled at predetermined locations as specified by the design engineer. The equipment used for this step is dependent on the stability of the material in which the soil nail wall is supporting. Rotary or rotary percussive methods using air flush or dry auger methods can be used with stable ground.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|33}} For unstable ground, single tube and duplex rotary methods with air and water flush or hollow stem auger methods are used.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|33}} With the holes drilled, the next step is to install and grout the nails into place. After all nails are inserted, a drainage system is put into place. Synthetic drainage mat is placed vertically between the nail heads, which are extended down to the base of the wall where they are most commonly connected to a footing drain.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|35}} A layer of [[shotcrete]] is applied and bearing plates are installed before a final facing is put in place to complete the soil nail wall.&lt;ref name="FHWA-1998"/&gt;{{rp|35}} Variations of the steps described above may be necessary to accommodate additional preparation tasks or supplementary activities for specific project conditions.

In terms of construction, soil nail walls have a decisive advantage over other alternatives. Soil nail walls require a smaller [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] than [[Earth anchor|ground anchor]] walls and have less environmental impact.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|17}} Installation of soil nail walls is relatively rapid and typically uses less materials and smaller construction equipment than ground anchor walls.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|17}}

== Cost comparison ==
One great advantage of soil nail walls is their cost-effectiveness over other alternatives. When conventional soil nailing construction procedures are used, soil nail walls are much more economical than concrete gravity walls and similarly or more cost effective than ground anchor walls.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|18}}

== Inspection and performance monitoring ==
Inspection activities play a vital role in the production of high-quality soil nail walls because conformance to project plans and specifications should result in a soil nail wall that will perform its intended duty for its designed duration. Inspections usually involve evaluation of the following: conformance of system components to material specification, conformance of construction methods to execution specifications, conformance to short-term performance specifications, and long-term monitoring.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|156}} Short-term performance specifications are checked with loads tests, which use hydraulic jacks and pumps to perform several load applications. Three common load tests for short-term performance are verification or ultimate load tests, proof tests and creep tests. Verification or ultimate load tests are conducted to verify the compliance of the soil nails with pullout capacity and strengths resulting from the contractor's installation method.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|163}} Proof tests are intended to verify that the contractor's construction procedure has been consistent and that the nails have not been drilled and grouted in a soil zone not tested in the verification stage.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|163}} Creep tests are performed to ensure that the nail design loads can be safely carried throughout the structure's service life.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|163}}

Long-term performance monitoring is used to collect data to ensure adequate performance and refine future design practices. Parameters to be measured include vertical and horizontal movement of the wall face, local movements or deterioration of facing elements, drainage to the ground, loads, load distribution and load changes in the nails, temperature and rainfall.&lt;ref name="FHWA-2003"/&gt;{{rp|170}} These parameters are measured using several specific tools including [[inclinometer]]s, [[load cell]]s and [[strain gauge]]s.

'''''Son of Man''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[novel]] by American writer [[Robert Silverberg]], published in 1971. The book is about Clay, a 20th-century man, who travels billions of years into the future and meets humanity in its future forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.concatenation.org/frev/sonofman.html |title=Review of the Robert Silverberg SF novel Son of Man |publisher=Concatenation.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/s/robert-silverberg/son-of-man.htm |title=Son of Man by Robert Silverberg |publisher=Fantasticfiction.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the issues discussed in the book are sexuality, [[telepathic]] communication between people, physical prowess or frailty, division of humans by [[caste]] or ability, and the preservation of ancient [[wisdom]], among other things.

==Reception==
[[Norman Spinrad]] has described it as "brilliant".&lt;ref name=Spinrad&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=EvCsY3IEJ14C&amp;pg=PA158&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22son+of+man%22+silverberg+review&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=P2ZwIyJaha&amp;sig=z_3kVrYYMCPgEPLT46l1eBpUtv4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjg8afekJ3VAhVm2IMKHWESBCwQ6AEI0wEwHw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22son%20of%20man%22%20silverberg%20review&amp;f=false Science Fiction in the Real World], by [[Norman Spinrad]]; published 1990 by [[Southern Illinois University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matt Hughes (writer)|Matt Hughes]] considers it "an artifact of its period, a remarkable, heady, head-trippy plunge into a [[New Wave science fiction|new way of writing sf]], and into a new way of thinking", but notes that because Silverberg is addressing "the timeless questions -- what are we? where do we come from? where are we going?", the book has not become "stale and musty".&lt;ref name=Hughes&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/01a/sm287.htm Son of Man, by Robert Silverberg], reviewed by [[Matt Hughes (writer)|Matt Hughes]], at the ''[[SF Site]]''; published 2009; retrieved July 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5778">[[File:Roman - Sucellus - Walters 54998.jpg|thumb|right|This statue of Sucellus is the earliest known likeness of the god (ca. 1st century AD). It is from a Roman home in France and was found in a household shrine ([[lararium]]). [[Walters Art Museum]], [[Baltimore]].]]
In [[Gallo-Roman religion]], '''Sucellus''' or '''Sucellos''' was a [[deity]] depicted as carrying a large mallet (also described as a hammer) and also an ''[[olla]]'' and/or barrel. Originally a [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic deity]], his cult flourished not only among [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Romans]], but also to some extent among the neighbouring peoples of [[Raetia]] and [[Roman Britain|Britain]]. He has been associated with agriculture and wine, particularly in the territory of the [[Aedui]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Miranda Green |author-link=Miranda Aldhouse-Green |title=Symbol and Image in Celtic Religious Art |date=2003 |publisher=Routledge |page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gaul god Sucellus.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Celtic god Sucellus with his characteristic hammer and ''olla''.]]

==Sculptures==
[[File:Nantosuelta-Sucellus.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Relief of Nantosuelta and Sucellus from Sarrebourg. Now in the [[Museums of Metz]].]] 
He is usually portrayed as a middle-aged bearded man, with a long-handled [[hammer]], or perhaps a beer [[barrel (storage)|barrel]] suspended from a pole. His companion [[Nantosuelta]] is sometimes depicted alongside him. When together, they are accompanied by symbols associated with prosperity and domesticity.

In a well-known relief from [[Sarrebourg]], near [[Metz]], Nantosuelta, wearing a long gown, is standing to the left. In her left hand she holds a small house-shaped object with two circular holes and a peaked roof – perhaps a dovecote – on a long pole. Her right hand holds a [[patera]] which she is tipping onto a cylindrical altar. 
To the right Sucellus stands, bearded, in a tunic with a cloak over his right shoulder. He holds his mallet in his right hand and an ''[[olla]]'' in his left. 
Above the figures is a dedicatory inscription and below them in very low relief is a raven. This sculpture was dated by Reinach, from the form of the letters, to the end of the first century or start of the second century.{{sfnp|Reinach|1922|pages=217–232}}

==Inscriptions==
At least eleven inscriptions to Sucellus are known,{{sfnp|Jufer|Luginbühl|2001|page=63}} mostly from [[Roman Gaul|Gaul]]. One (''RIB'' II, 3/2422.21) is from [[Eboracum]] (modern [[York]]) in [[Roman Britain|Britain]].

In an inscription from [[Augusta Raurica|Augusta Rauricorum]] (modern [[Augst]]), Sucellus is identified with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{AE|1926|00040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''In honor(em) / ''
:''d(omus) d(ivinae) deo Su/''
:''cello Silv(ano) / ''
:''Spart(us) l(ocus) d(atus) d(ecreto) d(ecurionum)''

The [[Syncretism#Ancient Rome|syncretism]] of Sucellus with [[Silvanus (mythology)|Silvanus]] can also be seen in artwork from [[Narbonensis]].{{sfnp|Duval|1993|page=78}}

==Etymology==
[[File:Sucellus BritMu022a.jpg|upright|thumb|Bronze statue of Sucellus from [[Vienne]].]]
In [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]], the root ''cellos'' can be interpreted as 'striker', derived from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*-kel-do-s'' whence also come Latin ''per-cellere'' ('striker'), Greek ''klao'' ('to break') and Lithuanian ''kálti'' ('to hammer, to forge').{{sfnp|Delamarre|2003|page=113}} The prefix ''su-'' means 'good' or 'well' and is found in many Gaulish personal names.{{sfnp|Delamarre|2003|pages=283-284}} ''Sucellus'' is therefore commonly translated as 'the good striker.'

An alternate etymology is offered by Celticist Blanca María Prósper, who posits a derivative of the Proto-Indo-European root ''*kel-'' ‘to protect’, i.e. ''*su-kel-mó(n)'' "having a good protection" or ''*su-kel-mṇ-'', an agentive formation meaning "protecting well, providing good protection", with a thematic derivative built on the oblique stem, ''*su-kel-mn-o-'' (and subsequent simplification and assimilation of the sonorant cluster and a secondary full grade of the root). Prósper suggests the name would then be comparable to the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indic]] personal name ''Suśarman-'', found in [[Hindu mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Prósper |first=Blanca María |title=Celtic and Non-Celtic Divinities from Ancient Hispania: Power, Daylight, Fertility, Water Spirits and What They Can Tell Us about Indo-European Morphology |journal=The Journal of Indo-European Studies |volume=43 |number= 1 &amp; 2 |date= 2015 |pages= 35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fra Angelico 009.jpg|thumb|280px|Jesus separating people at the Last Judgement, by [[Fra Angelico]], 1432-14]]

'''The Sheep and the Goats''' or "'''the Judgment of the Nations'''" is a pronouncement of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] recorded in [[Matthew 25|chapter 25]] of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew's Gospel]] in the [[New Testament]]. It is sometimes characterised as a [[Parables of Jesus|parable]], although unlike most parables it does not purport to relate a story of events happening to other characters. According to Anglican theologian [[Charles Ellicott]], "we commonly speak of the concluding portion of this chapter as the parable of the Sheep and the Goats, but it is obvious from its very beginning that it passes beyond the region of parable into that of divine realities, and that the sheep and goats form only a subordinate and parenthetic illustration".&lt;ref name="ellicott"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://biblehub.com/commentaries/ellicott/matthew/25.htm |title=Matthew 25 |website=biblehub.com |access-date=2018-04-15 |department=Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portion concludes the section of Matthew's Gospel known as the [[Olivet Discourse]] and immediately precedes Matthew's account of Jesus' [[Passion of Jesus|passion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerusalem Bible]] sub-title for chapters 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

This story and the [[parable of the ten virgins]] and the [[Parable of the talents or minas|parable of the talents]] in the same chapter "have a common aim, as impressing on the [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] the necessity at once of watchfulness and of activity in good, but each has ... a very distinct scope of its own".&lt;ref name="ellicott" /&gt;

==Text of the passage==
{{Christian Eschatology}}
The text of the passage appears in Matthew's Gospel and is the final portion of a section containing a series of parables. From {{bibleref2|Matthew|25:31–46|WEB}}:
{{blockquote|"But when the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then he will sit on the throne of his glory. Before him all the nations will be gathered, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left. Then the King will tell those on his right hand, ‘Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; for I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me drink. I was a stranger, and you took me in. I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you visited me. I was in prison, and you came to me.’

“Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you a drink? When did we see you as a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?  When did we see you sick, or in prison, and come to you?’

 “The King will answer them, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.’ Then he will say also to those on the left hand, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels; for I was hungry, and you didn’t give me food to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me no drink; I was a stranger, and you didn’t take me in; naked, and you didn’t clothe me; sick, and in prison, and you didn’t visit me.’

 “Then they will also answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn’t help you?’

 “Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Most certainly I tell you, because you didn’t do it to one of the least of these, you didn’t do it to me.’ These will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”}}

==Interpretation==

This passage directly addresses, in Jesus's own words, one of the most vexed questions in Christian theology – who goes to Heaven, and why. A related question is whether only orthodox Christians may be saved, or whether 'virtuous pagans' also may. The three main theological positions in this regard are:

* Justification by Works ([[Pelagianism]]): The doctrine that one can be saved simply by doing good works.
* [[Justification by Faith]]: The doctrine that one is saved by, and only by, faith. This doctrine is primarily associated with [[Martin Luther]] and his successors.
* [[Predestination]]: The doctrine that God has pre-decided (or, decided out of the flow of time as we know it) who will be saved and who will be damned, using criteria in principle unknowable to human beings. This doctrine is associated with [[Calvinism]], [[Jansenism]], and arguably [[Augustine_of_Hippo|St. Augustine]].

This parable seems on a natural reading to support the first view, justification by works. The 'sheep' are saved because of the good deeds they have done, independent of any framework of knowledge or belief, or hope of future benefit. Some [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theologians in particular have therefore attempted to get out from under the passage either by restricting the range of the phrase 'the least of these my brethren', or denying that the passage has any literal application to the after-life. The first option seems to be unnatural and to go against the spirit of the [[parable of the Good Samaritan]]. As associate professor of Biblical Languages at Union Presbyterian Seminary, E. Carson Brisson, says, "Let it be noted that this list of afflicted and needy individuals is, at first glance, a list of the very ones who appear to be bereft of God's favor. These are ‘the least.’ These are truly ‘other.’"&lt;ref&gt;Brisson, E Carson. "Matthew 25:14-30." ''Interpretation'' 56.3 (2002): 307-310. ''ATLA Religion Database with ATLASerials''. Web. 5 Sept. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The first option also does not support predestination, but at most might indicate, say, that unbelievers are to be judged by how well they treat believers.

Believers in justification by faith may still accept that good works may function as a test or measure of belief. See James 2:14-17, which appears to indirectly reference this parable:

{{Quote|What does it profit, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can faith save him? If a brother or sister is naked and destitute of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Depart in peace, be warmed and filled,” but you do not give them the things which are needed for the body, what does it profit? Thus also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.}}

==Circumnavigation==
Lauwers spent seven years planning his voyage and building his yacht,&lt;ref name="worldsail"/&gt; a [[E. G. van de Stadt|Van de Stadt]]-designed 47 named ''Vision Quest''.&lt;ref name="museum" /&gt;

He was instructed for two years on the synoptics of the Southern Hemisphere by meteorologist Bob Leighton who, together with colleagues from the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]'s National Meteorological Operations Centre, also provided regular forecasts during Lauwers' journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P003272b.htm |title=Biographical Entry – Leighton, Robert Murray (Bob) |publisher=Encyclopedia of Australian Science |date=25 May 2006 |accessdate=15 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171231031532/http://www.eoas.info/biogs/P003272b.htm |archivedate=31 December 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museum"/&gt;

His circumnavigation attempt commenced on 20 December 1999&lt;ref name="wssr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sailing.org/news/16816.php#.Wl2-K6iWbIU |title=WSSR Records subsequent to the May 2000 issue of Ocean Passages |publisher=World Sailing |accessdate=18 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121815251600/http://www.sailing.org/news/16816.php#.Wl2-K6iWbIU |archivedate=8 February 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;   from [[Port Phillip Bay]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia.
During his voyage he encountered many hardships. Equipment problems included autopilot malfunctions, failed radar, and a self-destructing wind generator.&lt;ref name="sailbook" /&gt;

The voyage took seven and a half months, finishing on 9 August 2000.&lt;ref name="worldsail"/&gt; Welcome celebrations were planned for Lauwers to finish his voyage on Saturday 12 August, but with a gale developing in [[Bass Strait]], he decided to enter the Bay and cross the official finish line on the 9th. He anchored and stayed on board until continuing on to the Williamstown Pier and planned celebrations.&lt;ref name="marsh"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wssr"/&gt;
His official welcome home at the Royal Yacht Club of Victoria was attended by over a thousand people including Premier [[Steve Bracks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/123482474 |title=Disabled sailor back on dry land – but only just |first=Steve |last=Waldon |work=[[The Age]] |page=5 |location=Melbourne |date=13 August 2000 |accessdate=15 January 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120070142/https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/123482474/ |archivedate=20 January 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of his crew members such as Lauwers and [[Liesl Tesch]], founder of Sailors with Disabilities, David Pescud said, "People are people first and your disability is either part of your life; it owns you or you own it.
