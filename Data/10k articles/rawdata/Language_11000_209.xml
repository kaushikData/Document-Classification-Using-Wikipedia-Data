[[File:Ramiz Rövşən 1992.jpg|300px|thumbnail|right|Azərbaycan yazıçıları — Rəşad Məcid, Ramiz Rövşən, Afaq Məsud və Vaqif Bayatlı Odər (1992-ci il)]]
'''Afag Masud''' ({{lang-az|Afaq Məsud}}) (b. 3 June 1957, [[Baku]]) is an [[Azerbaijan]]i writer.

==Contributions==
Born Afag Masud qizi Valiyeva in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], she became interested in professional writing in her teenage years. She wrote and published her first novel ''Gargish'' ("Curse") in 1978, at the age of 21. In the following years, she published 8 more novels as well as numerous short stories, essays and plays. In her works, Masud uses [[psychologism]] to emphasize the experiences of her protagonists. She abandons the idea of setting novels in a specific locale pointing out the universal nature of the described issues. Even though almost all of the protagonists in her works are female and the problems dealt with are for the most part gender-specific, Masud disagrees with those who consider her a [[feminist]] writer.&lt;ref name="bakupages"&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://www.baku.ru/enc-show.php?cmm_id=276&amp;id=61686&amp;c=1752 Unknown Bakuvians: Afag Masud]. ''Baku.ru ''&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also famous for translating works by authors such as [[Franz Kafka]], [[Guy de Maupassant]] and [[Gabriel Garcia Marquez]] into [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]].&lt;ref name="bakupages"/&gt; She currently works as the editor-in-chief of the Azerbaijani literary magazine ''Khazar''.

'''Baniwa''' (Baniva), or '''Karu''', or in older sources ''Itayaine (Iyaine)'', is an [[Arawakan languages|Arawakan]] language spoken in [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Amazonas State, Brazil|Amazonas]], [[Brazil]]. It forms a subgroup with the [[Tariana language|Tariana]], [[Piapoco language|Piapoco]], [[Resígaro language|Resígaro]] and [[Guarequena language|Guarequena]] languages.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Negation in Tariana: A North Arawak Perspective in the Light of Areal Diffusion|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004257023_006|date = 2014-01-01|doi = 10.1163/9789004257023_006|first = Alexandra Y.|last = Aikhenvald|first2 = Alexandra Y.|last2 = Aikhenvald}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10,000 speakers.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title = On Negation in Kurripako Ehe-Khenim|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/b9789004257023_005|date = 2014-01-01|doi = 10.1163/9789004257023_005|first = Tania|last = Granadillo|first2 = Tania|last2 = Granadillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aikhenvald (1999) considers the three main varieties to be dialects; Kaufman (1994) considers them to be distinct languages, in a group he calls "Karu". They are:
*Baniwa of Içana (''Baniua do Içana'')
*Curripaco (Kurripako, Ipeka-Tapuia-Curripako)
*Katapolítani-Moriwene-Mapanai (Catapolitani, Kadaupuritana)

Various (sub)dialects of all three are called ''Tapuya''. All are spoken by the [[Baniwa people]].  Ruhlen lists all as "Izaneni"; Greenberg's ''Adzánani'' (= Izaneni) presumably belongs here.

=== Alignment System ===
Baniwa has [[active–stative]] alignment.&lt;ref&gt;Aikhenvald, "Arawak", in Dixon &amp; Aikhenvald, eds., ''The Amazonian Languages'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the subject of an [[Intransitive verb|intransitive]] clause is sometimes marked in the same way as the agent of a [[Transitive verb|transitive]] clause, and sometimes marked in the same way as the patient of a transitive clause. In Baniwa alignment is realized through verbal agreement, namely [[prefixes]] and [[Clitic|enclitics]].

Prefixes are used to mark:
* Active intransitive subjects (S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Agents of transitive clauses (A)
* Possessors
* Arguments of [[Preposition and postposition|adpositions]]
Enclitics are used to mark:
* Stative intransitive subjects (S&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;)
* Patients of transitive clauses (O)

The differences between active and stative intransitive clauses can be illustrated below:
* Transitive: '''''ri-'''kapa'''-ni''''' 'He sees him/it'
* Active Intransitive: '''''ri-'''emhani'' 'He walks'
* Stative Intransitive: ''hape-ka-'''ni''''' 'He is cold'

=== Noun Classification System ===
Baniwa has an interesting system of noun classification that combines a [[grammatical gender|gender]] system with a [[Classifier (linguistics)|noun classifier]] system.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Classifiers in Multiple Environments: Baniwa of Içana/Kurripako—A North Arawak Perspective on JSTOR |journal = International Journal of American Linguistics |volume=73 |issue=4 |page=475 |last = Aikhenvald|first = Alexandra|year = 2007 |doi=10.1086/523774 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baniwa has two genders: feminine and nonfeminine. Feminine gender agreement is used to refer to female referents, whilst nonfeminine gender agreement is used for all other referents. The two genders are only distinguished in third person singular. Aihkenvald (2007) considers the bipartite gender system to be inherited from Proto-Arawak.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In addition to gender, Baniwa also has 46 classifiers. Classifiers are used in three main contexts:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* As a derivational suffix on nouns, e.g. ''tʃipaɾa'''-api''''' (metal.object-CL.hollow) 'pan'
* With numerals, e.g. ''apa-'''api''' mawapi'' (one-CL.hollow blowgun+CL.long.thin) 'one blow gun'
* With adjectives, e.g. ''tʃipaɾa'''-api''''' ''maka-'''api''''' (metal.object-CL.hollow big-CL.hollow) 'big pan'
Aihkenvald (2007) divides Baniwa classifiers into four different classes. One set of classifiers is used for humans, animate beings and body parts. Another set of classifiers specify the shape, consistency, quantification or specificity of the noun. Two more classes can be distinguished. One is only used with numerals and the other is only used with adjectives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Classifiers for Humans and animate beings:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"

|-

=== Negation ===
There are two main strategies for [[Negation (linguistics)|negation]] in the Kurripako-Baniwa varieties:&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
* Independent negative markers
* The [[privative]] derivational prefix ''ma-''
Different varieties have different negative markers. This is so prominent that speakers identify Kurripako dialects according to the words for 'yes' and 'no'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; 
{| class="wikitable"
!Dialect
!Spoken in
!Yes
!No
|-
|Aha-Khuri
|Colombia, Venezuela &amp; Brazil
|''Aha''
|''Khuri''
|-
|Ehe-Khenim
|Venezuela
|''Ehe''
|''Khenim''
|-
|Oho-Karo
|Colombia &amp; Brazil
|''Oho''
|''Karo''
|-
|Oho-Ñame
|Colombia &amp; Brazil
|''Oho''
|''Ñame''
|}
The independent negative markers come before the verb. They are used as clausal negators in declarative and interrogative sentences. They are also used to link clauses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The privative suffix is attached to nouns to derive a verb which means 'lacking' the noun from which it was derived. The opposite of the privative prefix is the attributive prefix ''ka-''. This derives a verb which means 'having' the noun from which it was derived.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The difference can be illustrated below:
* Noun: ''iipe'' 'meat'
* Privative: '''''ma-'''iipe &gt; meepe'' 'be thin' (lit. lack meat)
* Attributive: '''''ka-'''iipe &gt; keepe'' 'be fat' (lit. have meat)
The prefix is used in combination with the restrictive suffix ''-tsa'' to form negative imperatives, e.g. '''''ma-'''ihnia'''-tsa''''' 'don't eat!'. A privative prefix is also reconstructed in Proto-Arawak privative as ''*ma-.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Negation in Arawak Languages  »  Brill Online|url = http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/9789004257023|date = 2014-01-01|doi = 10.1163/9789004257023|first = Lev|last = Michael|first2 = Tania|last2 = Granadillo|first3 = Lev Michael{{!}}Tania|last3 = Granadillo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Word Order ===

'''Brayim Younisi''' (1926 - February 8, 2012) (alternatively spelled '''Ibrahim Younisi''' or '''Ebrahim Younesi''' or '''Brayim Khan''')
({{lang-ckb|ئیبراهیم یونسی}}) ({{lang-fa|ابراهیم یونسی}})  was an Iranian Kurdish writer, novelist and translator.

== Biography ==
Brayim was born in Bana ([[Baneh]]) in Kurdistan, Iran Part. He translated 81 books, mostly from English and a few from French literature into [[Persian language|Persian]]. He has also authored more than 10 books. Although he was writing in Persian language, many of his books have been written in the Kurdish context and topics. In 1949 in Tehran he went to military school and become a lieutenant. After [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] was overthrown in a coup d'état in 1955 he was fired from the Iranian army and sentenced to death. However, he was forgiven and eventually spent 8 years in jail under the Pahlavi regime (Shah). After jail he went to a higher school of economy and received a doctorate of philosophy from the [[Sorbonne]] in 1978 in Economy.&lt;ref name=Newspaper&gt;{{cite web |last=Hamshahri News |first=Newspaper |title=زندگینامه: ابراهیم یونسی (1305-1390) |url=http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/news-159946.aspx |work=NewsPaper |publisher=Hamshahri Online |accessdate=11 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212142016/http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/news-159946.aspx |archivedate=12 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Autobiography ===
Brayim wrote an autobiography in 2005, collecting memories from the beginning of his life, and marking challenging issues in his life in a beautifully written novel called ''Winter and no spring after'' (زمستان بي بهار). In his book, he described the way of living for Kurdish people in the 1920s in his hometown in Bane which is a very small town hidden in the beautiful [[Zagros]] Mountains. Using memories in the book can also track events in the 20th century in Iran.

=== Lifetime activities ===
He started his first translation about half a century ago by translating the novel ''Great Expectations'' from [[Charles Dickens]]. He introduced many of the most important novels from western literature for the first time into Persian:
''Literature and Western man'' by Priestley, John Boynton and ''Aspects of the Novel'' by [[E. M. Forster]].
However his writings are not only limited to literature. He also published books in history and politics. His very important publications on the Kurds and Kurdistan are among the most respected books in Kurdology. For example: ''A Modern History of the Kurds: Third Edition'' by David McDowall and ''[http://www.saradistribution.com/kurds_turks_arabs.htm KURDS TURKS &amp; ARABS]'' by C. J. Edmonds.

Another strength of Brayim is his own written novels, many of which have been published multiple times in Iran. The images he has created in his book "گورستان غريبان" ''[https://books.google.com/books/about/%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86_%D8%BA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86.html?id=TWYLAQAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y Stranger Cemetery]''
and "دعا براي آرمن" ''A Pray For the Aarman'' are remarkable in the Kurdish and Iranian novel writings history.

His death on 7 February 2012, almost on the same day as 200th birthday anniversary of [[Charles Dickens]] is noticeable, while he translated a few of his books such as ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]''.

=== Political life ===
He was the first governor of the Kurdistan province in Iran's first government after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979 in [[Mehdi Bazargan]]'s cabinet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Caitilin Dubh''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], fl. c. 1624.

Caitilin Dubhh is one of a very small number of pre-18th-century Irish female poets. Her surname is unknown; ''dubh'' is a nickname. Liam P. O Murchu (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;149) says ''"The absence of a surname points to her probable low social status; as the theme of wandering from place to place is found in some of the poems, it is possible that she was recognised as a semi-professional keening woman who went where her services were needed. She seems to have operated on the periphery of the literary culture of the early seventeenth century, and the poems ascribed to her provide an intriguingt insight into the possibility of female authorship at a period in Irish literary history when the official practise of poetry was still a predominantly male preserve. In personality she seems to have been agreeable, but formidable."''

Five surviving compositions, all [[elegy|elegies]], are known to be by her. They survived in a 17th-century collection of poems addressed to the [[O'Briens]] of [[Thomond]], the individuals concerned been:

* [[Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond]], died 1624
* [[Dermod O'Brien, 5th Baron Inchiquin]], died 1624, the subject of two elegies
* Maire O'Brien, daughter of the 3rd Earl of Thomond
* Toirdhealbhach Rua Mac Mathghamhna, husband of the above, died 1629.

Caitilin's poems on Inchiquin, Maire, and Mac Mathghamhna ''"contain sentiments of personal loss and, addressing the deceased in the first person, convey a sense of familiar acquaintance. It was this familiarity, combined with Caitilin Dubh's sureness of touch in the elegiac genre, that ensured the preservation of her poems in manuscript form."'' (O Murchu, p.&amp;nbsp;149).

In [[communications technology]], the technique of [[Compressed Sensing]] (CS) may be applied to [[speech processing|the processing of speech signals]] under certain conditions. In particular, Compressed Sensing can be used to reconstruct a [[sparse vector]] from a smaller number of measurements, provided the signal can be represented in sparse domain. By "sparse domain" is meant a domain in which only a few measurements have non-zero values. 

==Theory==
Suppose a signal &lt;math&gt;{x \in R^{N}}&lt;/math&gt; can be represented in a domain where only &lt;math&gt;{\it M}&lt;/math&gt; coefficients out of &lt;math&gt;{\it N}&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;{M \ll N}&lt;/math&gt;) are non zero, then the signal is said to be sparse in that domain.
This reconstructed sparse vector can be used to construct back the original signal if the sparse domain of signal is known. CS can be applied to speech signal only if sparse domain of speech signal is known.

Consider a speech signal &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt;, which can be represented in a domain &lt;math&gt;{\Psi}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;{x} = {\Psi \boldsymbol\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;, where speech signal  &lt;math&gt;{x \in R^{\it N}}&lt;/math&gt;, dictionary matrix &lt;math&gt;{\Psi \in R^{\it {N \times N}}}&lt;/math&gt; and the sparse coefficient vector  &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol\alpha \in R^{\it N}}&lt;/math&gt;. This speech signal is said to be sparse in domain &lt;math&gt;{\Psi}&lt;/math&gt;, if the number of significant (non zero) coefficients in sparse vector &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;{\it{K}}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;{\it{K \ll N}}&lt;/math&gt;.

The observed signal &lt;math&gt;{x} &lt;/math&gt; is of dimension &lt;math&gt;{\it{N \times 1}}&lt;/math&gt;. To reduce the complexity for solving &lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; using CS speech signal is observed using a measurement matrix &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; such that

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{y =\Phi x}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|1}}}}
        
   
where &lt;math&gt;{y \in R^{\it M}}&lt;/math&gt;, and measurement matrix &lt;math&gt;{\Phi \in R^{\it M \times N}}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;{\it {M \ll N}}&lt;/math&gt;.
 
Sparse decomposition problem for eq. 1 can be solved as standard &lt;math&gt;{l_1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization&lt;ref name="Donoho"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Donoho D.|doi=10.1109/TIT.2006.871582|citeseerx = 10.1.1.212.6447|title=Compressed sensing|year=2006|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|issue=4|pages=1289}}&lt;/ref&gt; as

{{NumBlk|:|&lt;math&gt;{\boldsymbol{\hat{\mathbf{\boldsymbol\alpha}}}=\mbox{minimize}\;\Vert \mathbf{\boldsymbol\alpha}  \Vert_1 \;\;\;\;\mbox{s.t.}\;\;\;\;   \mathbf{y}=\mathbf{\Phi x}=\mathbf{\Phi \Psi} \mathbf{\boldsymbol\alpha} = \mathbf{A \boldsymbol\alpha}, \;\mbox{where} \;\;\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{\Phi \Psi}}&lt;/math&gt;|{{EquationRef|2}}}}
  
If measurement matrix &lt;math&gt;{\Phi}&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the [[restricted isometry property|restricted isometric property]] (RIP) and is incoherent with [[Sparse dictionary learning|dictionary matrix]] &lt;math&gt;{\Psi}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Candes E. |author2=Romberg J. |author3=Tao T. |title= Robust uncertainty principles: exact signal reconstruction from highly incomplete frequency information|doi=10.1109/TIT.2005.862083|url=http://statweb.stanford.edu/~candes/papers/ExactRecovery.pdf|year=2006|journal=IEEE Transactions on Information Theory|volume=52|issue=2|pages=489|arxiv=math/0409186}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the reconstructed signal is much closer to the original speech signal.
  
Different types of measurement matrices like [[random matrix|random matrices]] can be used for speech signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zhang G. |author2=Jiao S. |author3=Xu X. |author4=Wang L. |doi=10.1109/ICINFA.2010.5512379|title=Compressed sensing and reconstruction with bernoulli matrices|work=The 2010 IEEE International Conference on Information and Automation|year=2010|isbn=978-1-4244-5701-4|pages=455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Li K. |author2=Ling C. |author3=Gan L. |doi=10.1109/ICASSP.2011.5947166|title=Deterministic compressed-sensing matrices: Where Toeplitz meets Golay|work=2011 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP)|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4577-0538-0|pages=3748}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Estimating the sparsity of a speech signal is a problem since the speech signal varies greatly over time and thus sparsity of speech signal also varies highly over time. If sparsity of speech signal can be calculated over time without much complexity that will be best. If this is not possible then worst-case scenario for sparsity can be considered for a given speech signal.
  
Sparse vector (&lt;math&gt;{\hat{\boldsymbol\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;) for a given speech signal is reconstructed from as small as possible a number of measurements (&lt;math&gt;{y}&lt;/math&gt;) using &lt;math&gt;{l_1}&lt;/math&gt; minimization.&lt;ref name="Donoho" /&gt; Then original speech signal is reconstructed form the calculated sparse vector &lt;math&gt;{\hat{\boldsymbol\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt; using the fixed dictionary matrix as &lt;math&gt;{\Psi}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;{\hat{x}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{\Psi}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\hat{\boldsymbol\alpha}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Christensen M. |author2=Stergaard J. |author3=Jensen S. |doi=10.1109/ACSSC.2009.5469828|title=On compressed sensing and its application to speech and audio signals|work=2009 Conference Record of the Forty-Third Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4244-5825-7|pages=356}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Estimation of both the dictionary matrix and sparse vector from random measurements only has been done iteratively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Raj C. S. |author2=Sreenivas T. V. |title= Time-varying signal adaptive transform and IHT recovery of compressive sensed speech|journal= Interspeech|pages= 73–76|year= 2011|url=http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/46137/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The speech signal reconstructed from estimated sparse vector and dictionary matrix is much closer to the original signal.
Some more iterative approaches to calculate both dictionary matrix and speech signal from just random measurements of speech signal have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Chetupally S.R. |author2=Sreenivas T.V. |title= Joint pitch-analysis formant-synthesis framework for CS recovery of speech|journal= Interspeech|year= 2012|pages=946–949|url=http://eprints.iisc.ernet.in/47277/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The application of structured sparsity for joint speech localization-separation in reverberant acoustics has been investigated for multiparty speech recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Asaei A. |author2=Bourlard H. |author3=Cevher V. |title= Model-based Compressive Sensing for Multiparty Distant Speech Recognition|journal= ICASSP|pages= 4600–4603|year= 2011|url=http://publications.idiap.ch/index.php/publications/show/1931/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further applications of the concept of sparsity are yet to be studied in the field of speech processing. The idea behind applying CS to speech signals is to formulate algorithms or methods that use only those random measurements (&lt;math&gt;{y})&lt;/math&gt;) to carry out various forms of application-based processing such as speaker recognition and speech enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Abrol Vinayak |author2=Sharma Pulkit |url=http://www.isca-speech.org/archive/interspeech_2013/i13_3274.html|title=Speech Enhancement Using Compressed Sensing|work=2013 Conference Record of 14th Interspeech|year=2013|pages=3274–3278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan Isaac Slobin''' (born May 7, 1939) is a [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[psychology]] and [[linguistics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Slobin has made major contributions to the study of children's [[language acquisition]], and his work has demonstrated the importance of cross-linguistic comparison for the study of language acquisition and [[psycholinguistics]] in general.

Dan (not 'Daniel') Slobin received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[psychology]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1960 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[social psychology]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1964.  In addition to working at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], Slobin has served as a [[visiting professor]] at several universities around the world, including [[Boğaziçi University]], [[Tel-Aviv University]], [[Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics]], [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS), and [[Stanford University]].

Slobin has extensively studied the organization of information about spatial relations and motion events by speakers of different languages, including both children and adults.  He has argued that becoming a competent speaker of a language requires learning certain language-specific modes of thinking, which he dubbed "thinking for speaking".  Slobin's "thinking for speaking" view can be described as a contemporary, moderate version of the [[Linguistic relativity|Sapir–Whorf hypothesis]], which claims that the language we learn shapes the way we perceive reality and think about it.  This view is often contrasted with the "[[Language acquisition|language acquisition device]]" view of [[Noam Chomsky]] and others, who think of language acquisition as a process largely independent of [[learning]] and [[cognitive development]].

== Research work ==
Dan Slobin did a research study, published in 2007, titled the ''Children use canonical sentence schemas: A crosslinguistic study of word order and inflections.'' The aim of the study was to show that we must not generalize that the acquiring of English language in children is the same as the acquiring of "x" languages. Slobin proposed that children "construct a canonical sentence schema as a preliminary organizing structure for language behaviour. This canonical sentence schemas provide a functional explanation for the order of words and inflectional strategies based on each child's attempt to quickly master basic communication skills in his or her languages."&lt;ref name="art1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0010-0277(82)90033-6|pmid= 6891309|quote= The subjects are monolingual children of professional parents who reside in Berkeley, Rome, Dubrovnik, Istanbul or Ankara. The subjects were ranging between the age of 2–4 and speak one of the following four different languages: English, which is claimed to be order and unflectional; Italian, weakly ordered and weakly inflectional; Serbo-Croatian, weakly order and inflectional; Turkish, minimally ordered and inflectional|title= Children use canonical sentence schemas: A crosslinguistic study of word order and inflections|journal= Cognition|volume= 12|issue= 3|pages= 229|year= 1982|last1= Slobin|first1= Dan I.|last2= Bever|first2= Thomas G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the experiment, Dan Slobin modified an existing method—the task-comparison research methods where he provided the "design for the testing of 48 children (three girls and three boys in each of the eight age groups: 2;0, 2;4, 2;8, 3;0, 3;4, 3;8, 4;0, 4;4). In the task, each child was presented with a pair of toy animals or dolls and was asked to demonstrate an action of one object upon the other. For example: "Here's a camel. Let's think of a little story about him. How about, 'the camel is sleeping'. Can you show me what that would be like?" Over the ten-day period, each child received three different kinds of the test. There were 18 verbs and 18 forms of the test allowing for permutations of word order and case inflections. The results is presented in table forms showing percentages of first-choice in all four languages by order of choice, whether it is Subject-Object, Noun-Object, etc.&lt;ref name="art1" /&gt; The most significant data gathered from the results was that Turkish children perform extremely accurate on all the grammatical sentences, even from the youngest age. Overall, the Turkish subjects perform better than children learning other languages. "The English and Italian children in the younger ages perform at an intermediate level and the Serbo-Croatian children had the greatest difficulty."&lt;ref name="art1" /&gt;

Slobin believes that language is acquired and is a learning as well as cognitive development in a child. His choice of method is the result of his theoretical stance where in task-comparison activity, his subjects get exposed to a consistent variety of tests, administered differently over a period of ten days. In task-comparison, his subjects get to perform or answer questions by displaying the instructions given.&lt;ref name="art1" /&gt;

His research generally showed that "children seemed prepared to learn both inflectional and word-order languages".&lt;ref name="art1" /&gt; His results contradicted his assumptions of "earlier expectations based on the alleged naturalness of fixed word order, the acquisition of Turkish is not at all impaired by the fact that word order is not a cue for semantic relations since all languages differ from one another on a range of dimensions". That is to say, "one can't make generalizations about the acquisition of English as simply as an example of acquisition of a particular "type" of language". Slobin successfully displayed this with the experiment results.&lt;ref name="art2"&gt;http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=aph&amp;AN=25961017&amp;site=ehost-live[full citation needed]&lt;/ref&gt; However, his subjects were mainly from different European countries as well as North America and none from any parts of the Asian continent countries. His other work, The frog-story project, gained recognition worldwide.

== Other work ==
Dan Slobin also designed a project, along with Ruth Berman in the beginning of 1980. He created "The frog-story project", a research tool which was a children's storybook that tells a story in 24 pictures with no words.&lt;ref name="art2" /&gt; This makes it possible to elicit narratives that are comparable in content but differing in form, across age and languages. There is now data from dozens of languages and most of the world's major language types. The Berman &amp; Slobin study compared English, German, Spanish, Hebrew and Turkish on a range of dimensions.

His project was also mentioned in Raphael Berthele, a professor in the University of Fribourg, Switzerland on her work in the ''Crosslinguistic approaches to the psychology approach'' by Elena Lieven, Jiansheng Guo.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=OCik4NYDgNAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=crosslinguistic+approaches#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Crosslinguistic Approaches to the Psychology of Language|isbn=978-0-203-83788-7|author1=Guo|first1=Jiansheng|last2=Lieven|first2=Elena|last3=Budwig|first3=Nancy|last4=Ervin-Tripp|first4=Susan|last5=Nakamura|first5=Keiko|last6=Ozcaliskan|first6=Seyda|date=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dialogic telephony cards''' was a line of PC [[expansion card]]s developed in 1990s by [[Dialogic Inc.]], at the time Media &amp; Signaling Division of [[Intel Corporation]], for [[computer telephony]] applications .

The cards were available in [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]], [[VMEbus|VME]], [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] and [[PCIe]] bus versions, and were used in PC-based [[proprietary software]] solutions for automated [[telephone]] systems running on the [[Wintel]] platform, including Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP, NT Server/Server 2000/Server 2003, as well as [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[Linux]].

The cards were produced in analog phone (2 to 24-port [[RJ-11]]) and digital [[ISDN]] ([[T-carrier|T1]] up to 96 channels, or [[E-carrier|E1]] up to 120 channels, 1 to 4 port [[RJ-48C]] or [[BNC connector|BNC]]) line configurations depending on usage.

==Hardware==
The cards contain up to 18 [[Motorola 56K|Motorola 56002]], Motorola 56321, or Freescale 56303 [[Digital signal processor|DSPs]] and an [[Intel 960]], [[Intel 486]] or [[ARMv7]] host processor. The cards can handle multiple phone calls simultaneously and route them to the intended point of service. There were several versions that could handle from 24 to 192 voice/conferencing channels on digital ISDN intefaces and from two to 32 analog ports (phone lines).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voxeo.com/dialogic/ Dialogic specs]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dialogic cards are capable of making and answering calls, identifying [[caller ID]], playing back sounds to the caller and recording sounds from the line, and detecting Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) signals (touch tones) dialed by the caller. They can also tear down a call and detect when the caller has hung up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yavagal|first=Asoke K. Talukder, Hasan Ahmed, Roopa R.|title=Mobile computing : technology, applications, and service creation|year=2010|publisher=Tata McGraw Hill|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0-07-014457-6|pages=70|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple cards can be connected together for increased processing capabilities using proprietary CTBus connector.

[[Cisco Systems]] uses these cards in its ''Unity'' product line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/voice_ip_comm/unity/5x/installation/guide/umexnofo/5xcuigumenofoappa.html At Cisco.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
Dialogic System Release 6, proprietary software developed by Dialogic Inc., provided predictive dialing, conferencing and [[interactive voice response]] (IVR) services which take calls from clients or customers and route the callers to the appropriate individual or data system. The software was used for automated answering services  in [[AT&amp;T]], [[PG&amp;E]], [[Bank of America]] and other large corporations. Although often complicated and difficult to [[navigate]], these systems allowed corporations to  streamline their telephone service and provide information to customers without the need for human interaction.

'''Drawdown charts''' are rectangular pieces of non-fluorescent [[paper]]&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg, H., ''American Paint Journal'', March 31, 1980, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; which are used to test a variety of [[coating]] properties.  These properties include [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]], spreading rate, penetration, and flow &amp; leveling behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Koleske, ''Paint and Coating Testing Manual'', p. 420, {{ISBN|0-8031-2060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This non-fluorescent material has to be especially rugged in order to maintain its structure and give reliable readings, as the coatings tested are often [[Corrosive substance|corrosive]] or [[abrasive]].
These charts are necessary in the testing of any coating as they give reliable and accurate readings for any type of coating before the coating is applied to the intended material.

==Drawdown bars==

Drawdown bars are used in collaboration with drawdown charts.  The bars are generally made of [[stainless steel]] or [[aluminum]] and touch the chart at each end, while the center is slightly raised to a desired height in order to obtain the desired film thickness.&lt;ref&gt;Koleske, ''Paint and Coating Testing Manual'', p. 418, {{ISBN|0-8031-2060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with the charts, the bars have to be especially resistant to [[corrosion]] because of the corrosive nature of some coatings.&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Patton ''Paint Flow and Pigment Dispersion'', 2nd edition. J. Wiley and Sons, New York, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a multiplicity of more complicated designs including some in which the paint is already in the chart apparatus, but the bar method described above is the most commonly used.

==Procedure==

Initially the desired coating is applied in a puddle on the drawdown chart.  Then the bar is placed at the top of the chart, and drawn down over the paint in order to spread it evenly along the length of the chart.  Once this evenly spread paint dries, it can be tested for a variety of properties.&lt;ref&gt;Koleske, ''Paint and Coating Testing Manual'', p. 419, {{ISBN|0-8031-2060-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drucilla Cornell''' (born 16 June 1950),&lt;ref name=Congress&gt;{{cite web|title=Cornell, Drucilla|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr87001013.html |publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=6 March 2015|quote=data sheet (b. 06-16-50)}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an American philosopher and feminist theorist, whose work has been influential in political and legal philosophy, ethics, deconstruction, critical theory, and feminism.  Cornell is an emerita Professor of Political Science, Comparative Literature and Women’s &amp; Gender Studies at [[Rutgers University]]  the State University of New Jersey; Professor Extraordinaire at the [[University of Pretoria]], South Africa; and a visiting professor at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]].  

==Education==
She received her [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) in [[Philosophy]] and [[Mathematics]] from [[Antioch College]] in 1978, and her [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from [[UCLA|University of California Los Angeles]] Law School in 1981.

==Career==
All of Cornell’s diverse work is dedicated to thinking the possibility of a more just future through political and legal philosophy, feminism, and critical theory.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Grosz, “Drucilla Cornell, Identity, and the ‘Evolution’ of Politics,” in Time Travels (Durham NC: Duke University Press, 2005), 71. &lt;/ref&gt;  Cornell is perhaps best known for her numerous interventions into feminist legal philosophy: ''Beyond Accommodation: Ethical Feminism, Deconstruction and the Law'' (1991); ''Transformations: Recollective Imagination and Sexual Difference'' (1993); ''The Imaginary Domain: Abortion, Pornography and Sexual Harassment'' (1995); and ''At The Heart of Freedom: Feminism, Sex, and Equality'' (1998).  In these texts, Cornell moves beyond feminist debates over formal equality, sexuate rights, and essentialism to develop the original concepts of “ethical feminism” and “[[Imaginary_Domain|the imaginary domain]]” which position feminism as a fundamentally ethical project oriented toward the re-imagination of sexual difference through law, politics and aesthetics.  Cornell is also widely known for her highly influential work in deconstruction, most notably ''The Philosophy of the Limit'' (1992), in which she famously renames deconstruction “the philosophy of the limit,” and argues for the political and ethical significance of Jacques Derrida’s work.  These attempts to rethink law and jurisprudence as the opening of the possibility of justice led Cornell to her later works: ''Just Cause: Freedom, Identity and Rights'' (2000); ''Defending Ideals: War, Democracy, and Political Struggles'' (2004); ''Moral Images of Freedom: A Future for Critical Theory'' (2008); and ''Symbolic Forms for a New Humanity: Cultural and Racial Reconfigurations of Critical Theory'' (co-authored with Kenneth Michael Panfilio, 2010).  These texts draw upon feminist, race, and critical theory to argue for the importance of imagination and symbolic forms in the project of freedom, the preservation of dignity, and creating a new future for humanity.  Cornell’s interest in the aesthetic is further brought out in ''Between Women and Generations: Legacies of Dignity'' (2004) and ''Clint Eastwood and Issues of American Masculinity'' (2009). In these texts she explores film and women’s personal narrative as crucial sites for the aesthetic reconfiguration of what it means to be human, both individually and collectively.  Finally, Cornell’s work in South Africa with the uBuntu Project has led to her most recent works ''uBuntu and the Law: African Ideals and Postapartheid Jurisprudence'' (co-edited with Nyoko Muvangua, 2011) and ''Law and Revolution in South Africa: uBuntu, Dignity and the Struggle for Constitutional Transformation'' (2014).  Here, Cornell explores the role of indigenous values, especially uBuntu, in the law, politics and ethics of the new South Africa.  This work in South Africa continues to build on Cornell’s career-long project of reimagining law as a force of revolutionary ethical transformation by looking beyond the Euro-American intellectual tradition.  The depth and range of Cornell’s visionary work has led to her being called “one of the last grand critical theorists of our time.” &lt;ref&gt;Cornel West, on Moral Images of Freedom: A Future for Critical Theory by Drucilla Cornell&lt;/ref&gt;

==On deconstruction and the law==
She played a key role in organizing the conference on [[deconstruction]] and justice at the Benjamin N. [[Cardozo School of Law]] in 1989, 1990, and 1993—a conference at which [[Jacques Derrida]] is thought by many to have made his definitive philosophical turn towards ethical thought.

==Playwriting==
Her first play, produced in 1989, was a dramatic adaptation of ''Finnegans Wake'' which continues to be performed on [[Bloomsday]]. Her other plays, 'The Dream Cure', 'Background Interference', and 'Lifeline', have been produced in New York and other cities including Los Angeles, Atlanta, Boca Rotan, Florida, and Cape Town, South Africa. She has also produced a documentary film on the African humanist ethic of uBuntu, entitled ''uBuntu Hokae''.

==Imaginary Domain==
The ''Imaginary Domain'' refers to the legal and moral ideal that was named to protect the psychic space necessary to rework individual sexual difference, sexuate being, racialized and ethnic identifications, as well as any other complex fantasies of personhood.

Drucilla Cornell coined the phrase the imaginary domain in the book by the same name in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornell|first=Drucilla|title=The Imaginary Domain: Abortion, Pornography and Sexual Harassment|date=July 16, 1995|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415911603}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was originally intended to intervene in feminist debates that had become acrimonious about whether women or any other identity could appeal to established identities as the basis of right. Cornell argued that it was possible to defend a practical ideal of the imaginary domain without having to resolve these particular debates, since as a moral or legal right, it was the person who was given the imagined space to recreate and re-symbolize all of his or her identifications. Thus, the imaginary domain did not fall into notions of right as necessarily inscribing victim identities or states of injury, since at least at the level of fantasy, the person is protected as the site of her own identifying configurations.

==Work in South Africa==
From 2008 to the end of 2009, Professor Cornell held the National Research Foundation Chair in Customary Law, Indigenous Values, and the Dignity Jurisprudence at the [[University of Cape Town]], South Africa. She founded the uBuntu project in 2003, and continues to be the co-director of that project with Chuma Himonga. She is also a co-director of the uBuntu Township Project, with Madoda Sigonyela. Professor Cornell is an advocate and researcher for Khulamani, an on the ground organisation of people who suffered under apartheid and are now struggling to find new and creative ways to counter the devastation that remains because of the system of [[racialized]] capitalism. The uBuntu Project is publishing several books. The first, ''uBuntu and the Law: Indigenous Ideals and Postapartheid Jurisprudence'', was published by Fordham University Press in 2012. The second, ''The Dignity Jurisprudence of the South African Constitutional Court'', is forthcoming in the fall of 2012, also from Fordham Press.

'''Effectuation''' is a way of thinking that serves [[entrepreneurs]] in the processes of opportunity identification and new venture creation. Effectuation includes a set of [[decision-making]] principles [[expert]] entrepreneurs are observed to employ in situations of [[uncertainty]].&lt;ref name="SEA"&gt;{{cite web

Situations of uncertainty are situations in which the future is unpredictable, goals are not clearly known and there is no independent environment that serves as the ultimate [[wikt:selection|selection]] mechanism.&lt;ref name="Sarasvathy et al."&gt;{{cite journal

==Founding==

Effectuation is a principle introduced by Saras Sarasvathy in 2001. Since 1997 Sarasvathy conducted a [[research]] among 45 expert entrepreneurs. Sarasvathy interviewed the entrepreneurs and let them solve cases in order to see how they think and where they start. It appeared that 89% of the expert entrepreneurs used effectuation more often than [[Causation (sociology)|causation]]. Causation is the opposite of effectuation. Where effectuation is used in situations of uncertainty, [[causal reasoning]] is used when the future is [[Predictability|predictable]].&lt;ref name="Sarasvathy et al."/&gt; With causal reasoning, entrepreneurs will determine goals to achieve and look for the resources to do so. At the opposite with effectuation, entrepreneurs will determine goals according to the resources in their possession.

==Principles of effectuation==

There are five core principles that define Effectual Logic. These are:&lt;ref name="SEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sarasvathy&gt;{{cite journal

* ''The Bird in Hand Principle''. Entrepreneurs start with what they have. They will look at who they are, what they know and who they know. Their [[education]], [[taste (sociology)|taste]]s and [[experience]] are examples of factors which are important in this stage. Besides these examples, this is also the stage where entrepreneurs look at their 3Fs, better known as friends, family and fools. From this point, they will look at their abilities. So an entrepreneur does not start with a given goal, but with the tools he or she has.
* ''The Affordable Loss Principle''. An entrepreneur does not focus on possible [[profit (economics)|profit]]s, but on the possible losses and how they can minimize those losses.
* ''The Crazy Quilt Principle''. Entrepreneurs cooperate with parties they can trust. These parties can limit the affordable loss by giving pre-[[Contract|commitment]].
* ''The Lemonade Principle''. Entrepreneurs will look at how to leverage contingencies. Surprises are not necessarily seen as something bad, but as opportunities to find new markets.
* ''The Pilot-in-the-plane''. In this stage, all the previous principles are put together. The future cannot be predicted, but entrepreneurs can control some of the factors which determine the future.

==An example==

The most simple and clear example Saras Sarasvathy gives to describe effectual reasoning and to distinguish effectual reasoning from causation  is about a chef cooking a meal.&lt;ref name="Sarasvathy et al."/&gt;
By using causation, the client chooses a menu in advance and the chef prepares this menu by looking for the right ingredients and following the recipes to make the dishes. In the effectual process, the approach would be rather different. The client would not ask for a specific menu, but he asks the chef to make something with the ingredients available. The chef chooses one of the many different meals he is able to make with the available ingredients.

The most important difference between causal reasoning and effectuation is therefore that an entrepreneur using causation has a given goal and searches for means to reach his goal. If the entrepreneur uses effectuation instead, he will start with the means he has and from this point he looks at possible goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3024">In [[combinatorial number theory]], the '''Erdős–Graham problem''' is the problem of proving that, if the set {2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;4,&amp;nbsp;...} of [[integer]]s greater than one is [[Partition of a set|partition]]ed into finitely many subsets, then one of the subsets can be used to form an [[Egyptian fraction]] representation of unity. That is, for every ''r''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, and every ''r''-coloring of the integers greater than one, there is a finite monochromatic subset ''S'' of these integers such that

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n\in S}\frac{1}{n} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In more detail, [[Paul Erdős]] and [[Ronald Graham]] conjectured that, for sufficiently large ''r'', the largest member of ''S'' could be bounded by ''b&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;'' for some constant ''b'' independent of ''r''. It was known that, for this to be true, ''b'' must be at least ''[[e (mathematical constant)|e]]''.

[[Ernie Croot]] proved the conjecture as part of his [[Ph.D]] thesis, and later (while a [[post-doctoral]] student at [[UC Berkeley]]) published the proof in the ''[[Annals of Mathematics]]''. The value Croot gives for ''b'' is very large: it is at most ''e''&lt;sup&gt;167000&lt;/sup&gt;. Croot's result follows as a corollary of a more general theorem stating the existence of Egyptian fraction representations of unity for sets ''C'' of [[smooth number]]s in intervals of the form [''X'', ''X''&lt;sup&gt;1+δ&lt;/sup&gt;], where ''C'' contains sufficiently many numbers so that the sum of their reciprocals is at least six. The Erdős–Graham conjecture follows from this result by showing that one can find an interval of this form in which the sum of the reciprocals of all smooth numbers is at least 6''r''; therefore, if the integers are ''r''-colored there must be a monochromatic subset ''C'' satisfying the conditions of Croot's theorem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4139">'''Gabriel Ruhumbika''' (born 1938) is a [[Tanzania]]n novelist, short story writer, translator and academic. His first novel, ''[[Village in Uhuru]]'', was published in 1969. He has written several subsequent novels in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]. He has also taught literature at a number of universities, and is currently a professor of Comparative Literature at the [[University of Georgia]] in the USA.

==Early life==
Ruhumbika was born in 1938 on [[Ukerewe Island]] in [[Lake Victoria]]. After studying for an undergraduate degree at the [[Makerere University]] in Uganda, he completed a PhD in African literature at the [[University of Paris-Sorbonne]] in France.&lt;ref name=SEAL/&gt;

==Career==
Ruhumbika's first novel, ''[[Village in Uhuru]]'', was published in 1969; this was the second English-language Tanzanian novel, after [[Peter Palangyo]]'s ''[[Dying in the Sun]]'' (1968).&lt;ref name=Gerard/&gt; This is a historical novel, based on real events relating to questions of ethnic and national identity in the context of the [[Tanganyika African National Union]]'s struggles for sovereignty in [[Tanganyika]] (now Tanzania).&lt;ref name=Gerard/&gt;&lt;ref name=Killam/&gt; Although ''Village in Uhuru'' was written and first published in English, Ruhumbika decided to write all of his subsequent novels in Swahili, a decision similar to that of Kenyan writer [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]].&lt;ref name=SEAL/&gt;

His Swahili-language novels, which mainly cover the [[Pan-African]] [[Uhuru Movement]], include ''Miradi Bubu ya Wazalendo'' (''Invisible Enterprises of the Patriots'', 1991) and ''Janga Sugu la Wazawa'' (''Everlasting Doom for the Children of the Land'', 2002).&lt;ref name=SEAL/&gt; He also wrote a collection of short stories, ''Uwike Usiwike Kutakuche'' (''Whether the Cock Crows or Not It Dawns''). Outside of his own writings, he has worked as a translator, mainly from French to Swahili, although he also translated [[Aniceti Kitereza]]'s novel ''Myombekere and His Wife Bugonoka, Their Son Ntulanalwo, and Daughter Bulihwali'' from [[Kikerewe language|Kikerewe]] into English.&lt;ref name=CGEAL/&gt;

Ruhumbika has also taught literature at various universities, in both Africa and the USA.&lt;ref name=SEAL/&gt; He has lectured at the [[University of Dar es Salaam]] (from 1970 to 1985) and [[Hampton University]] in [[Virginia]] (from 1985 to 1992). Since 1992, he has been a Professor of Comparative Literature at the [[University of Georgia]].&lt;ref name=CGEAL/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gabriel Ruhumbika {{!}} Comparative Literature|url=http://www.cmlt.uga.edu/people/faculty/gabriel-ruhumbika|publisher=[[University of Georgia]]|accessdate=1 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Francis Le Feuvre''', who wrote under the pen-names of ''George d'La Forge'' and ''Bouanhomme George'', was a [[Jèrriais]] prose author born at La Forge, Millais, Saint Ouen, [[Jersey]], on 29 September 1891 and died in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], on 27 October 1984.

==Life==
He took his pen-name from the family forge where his father, also called George Le Feuvre, carried on his trade as blacksmith and with his wife, Florence Giffard brought up their family. George attended Mabel Mauger's dame school in Saint Ouen from the age of 6. It was there that he first started learning English and French. He moved on to St Ouen's Wesleyan School. The Le Feuvre family was separated in 1901 when George senior, Florence, and their two younger sons, Sidney and John, emigrated to Jersey's cod-fishing settlements at the [[Gaspé Peninsula|Gaspé]] coast in [[Canada]]. George junior was left behind with his brother Frank and their grandparents, so that, should the ship be lost during the ocean crossing at least two boys would be left as survivors. In 1903, his grandfather died and the forge was sold. George went to live with his godparents in Saint Brelade, and attended La Moye School. George left school at age 14 to go to work in the offices of solicitor William Binet in [[Saint Helier]]. He continued working in the legal environment and was appointed Commis [[List of Viscounts of Jersey|Vicomte]] for the [[Courts of Jersey|Police and Petty Debts Court]] in 1914.

As a young man, he took part in amateur dramatic productions, including works by [[Edwin John Luce|E. J. Luce]].

He served as secretary to the [[Connétable (Jersey and Guernsey)|Connétable]] of Saint Peter, and served in the North-West Battalion of the Royal Militia 1908-1915. In 1916 he enlisted in the Royal Field Artillery and saw action on the Western Front of the First World War. Although he devoted many pieces of writing to his proud memories of peacetime military service in the Militia, in contrast he avoided describing, except in passing, his experiences in the First World War in the battles of the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Messines Ridge and Cambrai.
[[File:Le Ménage ès Feuvres Jersey.jpg|thumb|Le Ménage ès Feuvres, Saint Ouen, Jersey - former home of George F. Le Feuvre]]
In 1916 he married Marguerite Adrienne Jeanne Marie Forgeard, stepdaughter of a French army captain. They had one daughter, Reine, born in 1917. Marguerite died during the influenza pandemic, in March 1919. George never remarried, and remained a single man for the rest of his life.

===Canada===
Demobilised in 1919, and having no family ties remaining in Jersey, he decided to join the rest of his family in Canada. He had met his three brothers during the war, when he, Frank (who had signed up for the British Army) and his two other brothers (who had enlisted in Canada) were briefly reunited. The brothers had sworn to meet up again if they survived the war, and George had heard about their life in Canada and the brothers and sisters he had never seen who had been born there. He later explained to his readers that although he loved Jersey so much, the experience of meeting his brothers on the battlefield had inspired him to rejoin his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Le Feuvre|first=George F.|title=D'èrtou en Améthique|newspaper=Jersey Evening Post|date=12 December 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to find a civil service post in Quebec, George joined the civil service in [[Ottawa]].

===Detroit===
In 1922, in search of new opportunities, he moved to Detroit in the United States where he joined the [[Ford Motor Company]], first as a nightwatchman. He worked his way up the administration at the Great Lakes Engineering Works. During the course of his employment he learned to fly.

In 1933 he was naturalised as a United States citizen. In 1936 he was appointed purchasing director for Ford's sites in Michigan and Ohio. After the end of the war, at the age of 55, he decided to take retirement in 1946 and travel.

===Jersey, Canada, USA===

Revisiting Jersey in 1946, he was offered the post of editor of the last French language newspaper in Jersey, Les Chroniques de Jersey. Wishing to be free of commitments that would tie him down, he turned down the offer, but agreed to provide a weekly column in Jèrriais from wherever he happened to be.

In subsequent decades, George established a pattern of spending part of the year in North America and the rest staying with friends in Jersey and indulging his love of travel. He eventually acquired a house in Jersey, Le Ménage ès Feuvres, that used to belong to his family until sold after the death of his great-uncle Charles. He undertook a renovation of the property and moved in &lt;!-- not a mistake--&gt;in 1965. He continued to divide his time between Jersey and North America - Ottawa and Michigan to visit his brothers, Fort Lauderdale in Florida where he maintained a home, and San Antonio, Texas, home to his granddaughter.

The occasion of his 90th birthday in 1981 was marked with a dinner given in his honour by Le Don Balleine, and a celebratory mass in the chapel of [[Saint Ouen's Manor]]. The [[Jersey Evening Post]] celebrated the 900th column published in that newspaper in 1982. On 22 March 1984 he was elected a ''Membre d'Honneur'' of La [[Société Jersiaise]]. He died in a nursing home in San Antonio on 27 October 1984.

For almost forty years he maintained a flow of articles in Jèrriais back to Jersey for publication in newspapers, first in ''Les Chroniques de Jersey'' (1946–1954) and later in the ''Evening Post'' (subsequently ''Jersey Evening Post'' ) (1964–1984). Selections of his articles were published in book form as ''Jèrri Jadis'' (1973) and ''Histouaithes et Gens d'Jèrri'' (1976).

His first column for Les Chroniques de Jersey was published on 23 November 1946. Articles appeared weekly, or nearly weekly, until the end of 1951. In 1952-1954 articles relating George's travels appeared sporadically. A final article in Les Chroniques de Jersey, an appreciation of the newspaper, appeared in its final issue on 30 December 1959.

In 1953 George became the first secretary of L'Assembliée d'Jèrriais, founded to promote the Jersey language. Between 1952-1977 he was a regular contributor to its quarterly magazine Lé Bulletîn d'Quart d'An.

On the death in 1964 of writer Edward Le Brocq, whose weekly column in Jèrriais had transferred from Les Chroniques de Jersey on its closure at the end of 1959 to the Evening Post, George took up the rôle of providing a weekly column.

The publication of ''Jèrri Jadis'' resulted in the award of the Prix Littéraire du Cotentin to George in 1974.

On 13 January 1981, the Jersey Evening Post celebrated the 800th article by George published in that newspaper: "Eight hundred articles, each of about 800 words and delivered regularly from wherever he happens to be (which is usually America, where he has lived for many years) is a remarkable achievement." And when the milestone of the 900th article appeared (on 5 August 1983), the Jersey Evening Post described him as "Jersey heritage's most remarkable guardian".

From 14 April 1982, George's articles in Jèrriais were accompanied in the Jersey Evening Post by a parallel translation into English. His last article was published on 26 October 1984.

[[Image:Hoechstalemannisch.png|thumb|180px|Distribution of [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]] dialects.]]

The '''German-speaking part of Switzerland''' ({{lang-de|Deutschschweiz}}, {{lang-fr|Suisse alémanique}}, {{lang-it|Svizzera tedesca}}, {{lang-rm|Svizra tudestga}}) comprises about 65 percent of [[Switzerland]] (North Western Switzerland, Eastern Switzerland, Central Switzerland, most of the [[Swiss Plateau]] and the greater part of the [[Swiss Alps]]).

The variety of the [[German language]] spoken in Switzerland is called [[Swiss German]] which refers to any of the [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]] dialects and which are divided into [[Low Alemannic German|Low]], [[High Alemannic German|High]] and [[Highest Alemannic German|Highest Alemannic]]. The only exception within German-speaking Switzerland is the municipality of [[Samnaun]] where an [[Austro-Bavarian#Regions where Austro-Bavarian is spoken|Austro-Bavarian dialect]] is spoken.

German is the sole official language in 17 Swiss cantons ([[Aargau]], [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], [[Appenzell Innerrhoden]], [[Basel-Stadt]], [[Basel-Landschaft]], [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]], [[Canton of Lucerne|Lucerne]], [[Nidwalden]], [[Obwalden]], [[Canton of Schaffhausen|Schaffhausen]], [[Schwyz]], [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]], [[Canton of St. Gallen|St. Gallen]], [[Thurgau]], [[Canton of Uri|Uri]], [[Canton of Zug|Zug]], and [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation, article 1 |url = http://www.admin.ch/ch/e/rs/101/a1.html |accessdate=2009-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; French and German are co-official in 3 cantons ([[Canton of Bern|Bern]], [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]], and [[Valais]]). In the trilingual canton of [[Graubünden]], more than half the population speaks German, while most of the rest speak one of the other official languages, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].

While the French-speaking Swiss prefer to call themselves ''Romands'' and their part of the country ''la [[Romandie]]'', the German-speaking Swiss used to refer to (and, colloquially, still do) the French-speaking Swiss as "Welsche", and to their area as ''Welschland'', which has the same etymology as the English [[Wiktionary:Welsh|Welsh]] (see ''[[Walha]]''). In Germany ''Welsch'' and ''Welschland'' refer to Italy; there, the term is antiquated, rarely used, and somewhat disparaging.

By the [[Middle Ages]], a marked difference had developed between the rural cantons of the German-speaking part of Switzerland and the city cantons, divided by views about trade and commerce. After the [[Swiss Reformation|Reformation]], all cantons were either Catholic or Protestant, and the denominational influences on culture added to the differences. Even today, where all cantons are somewhat denominationally mixed, the different historical denominations can be seen in the mountain villages, where Roman Catholic Central Switzerland abounds with chapels and statues of saints, and the farm houses in the very similar landscape of the Protestant Bernese Oberland show Bible verses carved on the housefronts, instead.

The '''Korean alphabet''', known as '''Hangul''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɑː|n|g|uː|l}} {{Respell|HAHN|gool}};&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;{{cite web |title=Hangul |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hangul |website=[[Dictionary by Merriam-Webster]] |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]] |accessdate=15 August 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Korean language|Korean]]  {{lang|ko|한글}} {{IPA-ko|ha(ː)n.ɡɯl}}) has been used to write the [[Korean language]] since its creation in the 15th century by [[Sejong the Great]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=알고 싶은 한글 |url=http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/setting/002.html |website=국립국어원 |publisher=National Institute of Korean Language |accessdate=4 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud 15p"&gt;{{harvnb|Kim-Renaud|1997|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be written '''{{lang|ko-Latn|Hangeul}}''' following the standard Romanization.

It is the official [[writing system]] of [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. It is a co-official writing system in the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] and [[Changbai Korean Autonomous County]] in [[Jilin|Jilin Province]], [[China]]. It is sometimes used to write the [[Cia-Cia language|Cia-Cia]] language spoken near the town of [[Bau-Bau]], [[Indonesia]].

The alphabet consists of 14 [[consonant]]s and 10 [[vowel]]s. Its letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] blocks, vertically and horizontally. For example, the Korean word for "[[honeybee]]" (''kkulbeol'') is written {{lang|ko|꿀벌}}, not {{lang|ko|ㄲㅜㄹㅂㅓㄹ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.korean.go.kr/eng_hangeul/principle/001.html |title=Individual Letters of Hangeul and its Principles |date=2008 |website=National Institute of Korean Language |access-date=2017-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it combines the features of alphabetic and syllabic writing systems, it has been described as an "alphabetic syllabary" by some [[Linguistics|linguists]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Taylor |first1=Insup |title=The Korean writing system: An alphabet? A syllabary? a logography? |journal=Processing of Visible Language |date=1980 |pages=67–82 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-1068-6_5 |url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4684-1068-6_5 |accessdate=17 October 2017 |publisher=Springer |location=[[Boston, Mass.]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pae |first1=Hye K. |title=Is Korean a syllabic alphabet or an alphabetic syllabary |journal=Writing Systems Research |date=1 January 2011 |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=103–115 |doi=10.1093/wsr/wsr002 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1093/wsr/wsr002 |accessdate=17 October 2017 |issn=1758-6801 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As in traditional Chinese writing, Korean texts were traditionally written top to bottom, right to left, and are occasionally still written this way for stylistic purposes. Today, it is typically written from left to right with [[word divider|spaces]] between words and [[punctuation|western-style punctuation]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2013/10/economist-explains-7 |title=How was Hangul invented? |date=2013-10-08 |work=[[The Economist]] |access-date=2017-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[linguistics|linguists]] consider it among the most phonologically faithful writing systems in use today. One interesting feature of Hangul is that the shapes of its consonants seemingly mimic the shapes of the speaker's mouth when pronouncing each consonant.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/a-linguist-explains-why-korean-is-the-best-written-language-2016-6 |title=A linguist explains why Korean is the best written language |last=Cock |first=Joe |date=2016-06-28 |work=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=2017-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hangeul.svg|thumb|300px|The word "Hangul", written in the Korean alphabet]]
The Korean alphabet was originally called [[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]] ({{lang|ko|훈민정음}}), after the document that introduced the script to the Korean people in 1446.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cha.go.kr/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?ctgryLrcls=CTGRY168&amp;nttId=57977&amp;bbsId=BBSMSTR_1205&amp;mn=EN_03_03|title=Hunminjeongeum Manuscript|last=|first=|date=2006|website=Korean Cultural Heritage Administration|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171203224537/http://www.cha.go.kr/cop/bbs/selectBoardArticle.do?ctgryLrcls=CTGRY168&amp;nttId=57977&amp;bbsId=BBSMSTR_1205&amp;mn=EN_03_03|archivedate=2017-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[North Korea]]ns call the Korean alphabet Chosŏn'gŭl ({{lang|ko-kp|조선글}}) after [[Chosŏn]], the North Korean [[Names of Korea|name for Korea]].&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud 2p"&gt;{{harvnb|Kim-Renaud|1997|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McCune–Reischauer]] system is used there.

Today, [[South Korea]]ns call the Korean alphabet ''hangeul'' ({{lang|ko-kr|한글}}), a name coined by Korean linguist [[Ju Si-gyeong]] in 1912. The name combines the ancient Korean word ''han'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko-Hang|한}}), meaning "great", and ''geul'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko-Hang|글}}), meaning "script". The word ''han'' is used to refer to Korea in general, so the name also means "Korean script".&lt;ref name="Lee, Iksop 13p"&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Ramsey|2000|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NN-yIdLOkCoC&amp;pg=PA13 13]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been [[romanized]] in multiple ways:
* ''Hangeul'' or ''han-geul'' in the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]], which the [[South Korea]]n government uses in English publications and encourages for all purposes.
* ''Han'gŭl'' in the [[McCune–Reischauer]] system, is often capitalized and rendered without the [[diacritic]]s when used as an English word, Hangul, as it appears in many English dictionaries.
* ''Hānkul'' in the [[Yale romanization of Korean|Yale romanization]], a system recommended for technical linguistic studies.

=== Other names ===
Until the early 20th century, the Korean elite preferred to write using [[Chinese characters]] called [[Hanja]]. They referred to Hanja as ''jinseo'' (진서) or "true letters". Some accounts say the elite referred to the Korean alphabet derisively as 'amkeul'' (암클) meaning "women's script", and '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ahaetgeul'' (아햇글) meaning "children's script", though there is no written evidence of this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/eng_hangeul/another/001.html|title=Different Names for Hangeul|last=|first=|date=2008|website=National Institute of Korean Language|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of the Korean alphabet referred to it as ''jeong'eum'' (정음) meaning "correct pronunciation", ''gunkmun'' (국문) meaning "national script", and ''[['eonmun]]'' (언문) meaning "vernacular script".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Origin of Hangul}}

=== Creation ===
Before the creation of the new Korean alphabet, Koreans primarily wrote using [[Classical Chinese]] alongside native phonetic writing systems that predate the modern Korean alphabet by hundreds of years, including [[Idu script]], [[Hyangchal]], [[Gugyeol]] and Gakpil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJfv8Iyd2m4C&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage|title=Asia's Orthographic Dilemma|last1=Hannas|first1=Wm C.|publisher=[[University of Hawaii Press]]|isbn=9780824818920|page=57|language=en|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CpZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA66#v=onepage|title=Multilingual Access and Services for Digital Collections|last1=Chen|first1=Jiangping|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781440839559|page=66|language=en|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="phonetic"&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 January 2005|title=Invest Korea Journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00a2AAAAIAAJ|language=en|publisher=Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency|volume=23|accessdate=20 September 2016|quote=They later devised three different systems for writing Korean with Chinese characters: Hyangchal, Gukyeol and Idu. These systems were similar to those developed later in Japan and were probably used as models by the Japanese.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=1 July 2000|title=Korea Now|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAlWAAAAYAAJ|language=en|publisher=Korea Herald|volume=29|accessdate=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to fundamental differences between the Korean and Chinese languages, and the large number of characters, many lower class Koreans were illiterate.&lt;ref name="NAKL Back2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korean.go.kr/eng_hangeul/setting/002.html|title=The Background of the invention of Hangeul|last=|first=|date=2008|website=National Institute of Korean Language|publisher=The National Academy of the Korean Language|accessdate=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; To promote literacy among the common people, the fourth king of the [[Joseon]] dynasty, [[Sejong the Great]], personally created and promulgated a new alphabet.&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud 15p" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NAKL Back2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VCqLBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage|title=Concise History of the Language Sciences: From the Sumerians to the Cognitivists

The Korean alphabet was designed so that people with little education could learn to read and write. A popular saying about the alphabet is, "A wise man can acquaint himself with them before the morning is over; even a stupid man can learn them in the space of ten days."&lt;ref name="Haerye"&gt;''[[Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye]]'', postface of [[Jeong Inji]], p. 27a, translation from [[Gari K. Ledyard]], ''The Korean Language Reform of 1446'', p. 258&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hunmin jeong-eum.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''Hunminjeong'eum Eonhae''. The Hangul-only column, third from the left ({{Script/Korean|나랏말ᄊᆞ미}}), has pitch-accent diacritics to the left of the syllable blocks.]]

The project was completed in late December 1443 or January 1444, and described in 1446 in a document titled ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' (''The Proper Sounds for the Education of the People''), after which the alphabet itself was originally named.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The publication date of the ''Hunminjeongeum'', October 9, became [[Hangul Day]] in South Korea. Its North Korean equivalent, Chosŏn'gŭl Day, is on January 15.

Another document published in 1446 and titled ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum Haerye|Hunminjeong'eum Haerye]]'' ("''Hunminjeong'eum'' Explanation and Examples") was discovered in 1940. This document explains that the design of the consonant letters is based on [[articulatory phonetics]] and the design of the vowel letters are based on the principles of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']] and [[vowel harmony]].

=== Opposition ===
The Korean alphabet faced opposition in the 1440s by the literary elite, including politician [[Choe Manri]] and other [[Korean Confucian]] scholars. They believed [[Hanja]] was the only legitimate writing system. They also saw the circulation of the Korean alphabet as a threat to their status.&lt;ref name="NAKL Back2" /&gt; However, the Korean alphabet entered popular culture as King Sejong had intended, used especially by women and writers of popular fiction.&lt;ref name="Pratt"&gt;Pratt, Rutt, Hoare, 1999.

[[Yeonsangun of Joseon|King Yeonsangun]] banned the study and publication of the Korean alphabet in 1504, after a document criticizing the king entered the public.&lt;ref name="NAKL process"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The National Academy of the Korean Language |title=4.

=== Revival ===
The late 16th century, however, saw a revival of the Korean alphabet as ''[[Gasa (poetry)|gasa]]'' and ''[[sijo]]'' poetry flourished. In the 17th century, the Korean  alphabet novels became a major [[genre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&amp;m=all&amp;articleID=b24h2804b |title=Korea Britannica article |language=ko|publisher=Enc.daum.net |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of the Korean alphabet had gone without [[Orthography|standardisation]] for so long that spelling had become quite irregular.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;

In 1796, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] scholar [[Isaac Titsingh]] became the first person to bring a book written in Korean to [[Western world|the West]]. His collection of books included the Japanese book, ''[[Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu]]'' (''An Illustrated Description of Three Countries'') by [[Hayashi Shihei]].&lt;ref&gt;WorldCat, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Sangoku+Ts%C5%ABran+Zusetsu&amp;qt=results_page ''Sangoku Tsūran Zusetsu'']; alternate [[romaji]] [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Sankoku+Ts%C5%ABran+Zusetsu&amp;qt=results_page ''Sankoku Tsūran Zusetsu'']&lt;/ref&gt; This book, which was published in 1785, described the [[Joseon Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;Cullen, Louis M. (2003). {{Google books|ycY_85OInSoC|''A History of Japan, 1582-1941: Internal and External Worlds,'' p. 137.|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Korean alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Vos, Ken.

Thanks to growing [[Korean nationalism]], the [[Gabo Reform]]ists' push, and Western missionaries' promotion of the Korean alphabet in schools and literature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Silva | first1 = David J. | year = 2008 | title = Missionary Contributions toward the Revaluation of Han'geul in Late 19th Century Korea | journal = International Journal of the Sociology of Language | volume = 192 | pages = 57–74 | doi=10.1515/ijsl.2008.035}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Korean alphabet was adopted in official documents for the first time in 1894.&lt;ref name="NAKL process" /&gt; Elementary school texts began using the Korean alphabet in 1895, and ''[[Tongnip Sinmun]]'', established in 1896, was the first newspaper printed in both Korean and English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://korea.assembly.go.kr/history_html/history_07/mod_09.jsp |title=Korean History |publisher=Korea.assembly.go.kr |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reforms and prohibition under Japanese rule ===
After the [[Japanese forced occupation|Japanese conquest]], which occurred in 1910, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] was made the official language of Korea. However, the Korean alphabet was still taught in Korean-established schools built after the annexation and Korean was written in a mixed Hanja-Hangul script, where most lexical roots were written in Hanja and grammatical forms in the Korean alphabet. Japan banned earlier Korean literature from public schooling, which became mandatory for children.

[[Hangul orthography|Orthography of the Korean alphabet]] was partially standardized in 1912, when the vowel ''arae'a'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}})–which has now disappeared from Korean–was restricted to [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] roots: the emphatic consonants were standardized to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅺ, ㅼ, ㅽ, ㅆ, ㅾ}} and final consonants restricted to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ, ㄴ, ㄹ, ㅁ, ㅂ, ㅅ, ㅇ, ㄺ, ㄻ, ㄼ}}. Long vowels were marked by a diacritic dot to the left of the syllable, but this was dropped in 1921.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;

A second colonial reform occurred in 1930. The ''arae-a'' was abolished: the emphatic consonants were changed to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄲ, ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅆ, ㅉ}} and more final consonants {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ, ㅈ, ㅌ, ㅊ, ㅍ, ㄲ, ㄳ, ㄵ, ㄾ, ㄿ, ㅄ}} were allowed, making the orthography more [[morphophonemic]]. The double-consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅆ}} was written alone (without a vowel) when it occurred between nouns, and the nominative particle {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-가}} was introduced after vowels, replacing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|-이}}.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;

[[Ju Si-gyeong]], the linguist who had coined the term Hangul to replace ''Eonmun'' or "Vulgar Script" in 1912, established the Korean Language Research Society (later renamed the Hangul Society), which further reformed orthography with ''Standardized System of Hangul'' in 1933. The principal change was to make the Korean alphabet as morphophonemically practical given the existing letters.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt; A system for transliterating foreign orthographies was published in 1940.

However, Japan banned the Korean language from schools in 1938 as part of a policy of [[cultural assimilation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enc.daum.net/dic100/viewContents.do?&amp;m=all&amp;articleID=b24h2804b |publisher=[[Daum (web portal)|Daum]] / [[Britannica]] |title=Hangul &lt;span lang="ko"&gt;한글&lt;/span&gt; |work=The modern and contemporary history of hangul (&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;한글의 근·현대사&lt;/span&gt;)|quote=&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;1937년 7월 중일전쟁을 도발한 일본은 한민족 말살정책을 노골적으로 드러내, 1938년 4월에는 조선어과 폐지와 조선어 금지 및 일본어 상용을 강요했다.&lt;/span&gt;|language=Korean|accessdate=2008-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and all Korean-language publications were outlawed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/krtoc.html |title=under The Media |publisher=Lcweb2.loc.gov |date=2011-03-22 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further reforms ===
The definitive modern Korean alphabet orthography was published in 1946, just after Korean independence from Japanese rule. In 1948, North Korea attempted to make the script perfectly morphophonemic through the addition of new letters, and in 1953, [[Syngman Rhee]] in South Korea attempted to simplify the orthography by returning to the colonial orthography of 1921, but both reforms were abandoned after only a few years.&lt;ref name="Pratt" /&gt;

Both [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] have used the Korean alphabet or [[Korean mixed script|mixed script]] as their official writing system, with ever-decreasing use of Hanja. Beginning in the 1970s, Hanja began to experience a gradual decline in commercial or unofficial writing in the South due to government intervention, with some South Korean newspapers now only using Hanja as abbreviations or disambiguation of homonyms. There has been widespread debate as to the future of Hanja in South Korea. North Korea instated the Korean alphabet as its exclusive writing system in 1949, and banned the use of Hanja completely.

=== Contemporary use ===

While both North Korea and South Korea claim 99 percent literacy, a 2003 study found that 25 percent of those in the older generation in the South were not completely literate in the Korean alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hankyoreh]]''.

==Letters==
{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}} Letters in the Korean alphabet are called ''jamo'' (자모). There are 19 [[consonant]]s and 21 [[vowel]]s used in the modern alphabet. They are firstly named in [[Hunmongjahoe]], a [[hanja]] textbook written by [[Choe Sejin]].

==Alphabetic order==
[[Alphabetical order|Alphabetic order]] in the Korean alphabet is called the ''ganada'' order, ({{lang|ko|가나다 순|nocat=yes}}) after the first three letters of the alphabet. The alphabetical order of the Korean alphabet does not mix consonants and vowels. Rather, first are [[velar consonant]]s, then [[Coronal consonant|coronals]], [[Labial consonant|labials]], [[sibilant]]s, etc. The vowels come after the consonants.

=== Historical orders ===
The order from the ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]'' in 1446 was:

:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㅋ ㆁ ㄷ ㅌ ㄴ ㅂ ㅍ ㅁ ㅈ ㅊ ㅅ ㆆ ㅎ ㅇ ㄹ ㅿ}} 
:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ ㅡ ㅣ ㅗ ㅏ ㅜ ㅓ ㅛ ㅑ ㅠ ㅕ}}

In 1527, [[Choe Sejin]] reorganized the alphabet in [[Hunmongjahoe]]:

:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㆁ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅈ ㅊ ㅿ ㅇ ㅎ}}
:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ ㆍ}}

This is the basis of the modern alphabetic orders. It was before the development of the Korean tense consonants and the double letters that represent them, and before the conflation of the letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} (') and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} (ng). Thus, when the [[North Korea]]n and [[South Korea]]n governments implemented full use of the Korean alphabet, they ordered these letters differently, with North Korea, placing new letters at the end of the alphabet and South Korea grouping similar letters together.

=== North Korean order ===
The new, double, letters are placed at the end of the consonants, just before the ' {{lang|ko|ㅇ|nocat=yes}}, so as not to alter the traditional order of the rest of the alphabet.

: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㄴ ㄷ ㄹ ㅁ ㅂ ㅅ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ ㄲ ㄸ ㅃ ㅆ ㅉ ㅇ}}
: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ ㅑ ㅓ ㅕ ㅗ ㅛ ㅜ ㅠ ㅡ ㅣ ㅐ ㅒ ㅔ ㅖ ㅚ ㅟ ㅢ ㅘ ㅝ ㅙ ㅞ}}

All digraphs and [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraph]]s, including the old diphthongs {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅐ}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}}, are placed after the simple vowels, again maintaining Choe's alphabetic order.

The order of the final letters is:

:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ ㄲ ㅆ}}

Unlike when it is initial, this {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} is pronounced, as the nasal {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} ''ng,'' which occurs only as a final in the modern language. The double letters are placed to the very end, as in the initial order, but the combined consonants are ordered immediately after their first element.

=== South Korean order ===
In the Southern order, double letters are placed immediately after their single counterparts:

:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱㄲㄴㄷㄸㄹㅁㅂㅅㅆㅇㅈㅉㅊㅋㅌㅍㅎ}}
:{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ ㅐ ㅑ ㅒ ㅓ ㅔ ㅕ ㅖ ㅗ ㅘ ㅙ ㅚ ㅛ ㅜ ㅝ ㅞ ㅟ ㅠ ㅡ ㅢ ㅣ}}

The modern [[monophthong]]al vowels come first, with the derived forms interspersed according to their form: ''i'' is added first, then iotized, then iotized with added ''i''. [[Diphthong]]s beginning with ''w'' are ordered according to their spelling, as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} plus a second vowel, not as separate [[Digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s.

The order of the final letters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|받침}}) is:
:(none) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㄲ ㄳ ㄴ ㄵ ㄶ ㄷ ㄹ ㄺ ㄻ ㄼ ㄽ ㄾ ㄿ ㅀ ㅁ ㅂ ㅄ ㅅ ㅆ ㅇ ㅈ ㅊ ㅋ ㅌ ㅍ ㅎ}}

("None" means there is no final letter.)

Every syllable begins with a consonant (or the silent ㅇ) that is followed by a vowel (e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}} = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|다}}). Some syllables such as "{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|달}}" and "{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|닭}}" have a final consonant or final consonant cluster ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|받침}}). Then, 399 combinations are possible for "two-letter syllables" and 10,773 possible combinations for syllables with more than two "letters" (27 possible final endings), for a total of 11,172 possible combinations of Korean alphabet "letters" to form syllables.

Letters in the Korean alphabet were named by Korean linguist [[Choe Sejin]] in 1527. South Korea uses Choe's traditional names, most of which follow the format of ''letter'' + ''i'' + ''eu'' + ''letter''. However, as the syllables {{lang|ko|윽}} ''euk'', {{lang|ko|읃}} ''eut'', and {{lang|ko|읏}} ''eut'' did not occur in the language, Choe gave those letters the modified names {{lang|ko|기역}} ''gi'''yeok''''', {{lang|ko|디귿}} ''di'''geut''''', and {{lang|ko|시옷}} ''si'''eut''''', using native syllables.

Originally, Choe gave {{lang|ko|ㅈ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅊ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅋ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅌ}}, {{lang|ko|ㅍ}}, and {{lang|ko|ㅎ}} the irregular one-syllable names of ''ji'', ''chi'', ''ḳi'', ''ṭi'', ''p̣i'', and ''hi'', because they should not be used as final consonants, as specified in ''[[Hunminjeongeum|Hunminjeong'eum]]''. However, after establishment of the new orthography in 1933, which let all consonants be used as finals, the names changed to the present forms.

North Korea regularised Choe's original names when it made the Korean alphabet its official orthography.

=== In North Korea ===
The chart below shows names used in North Korea for consonants in the Korean alphabet. The letters are arranged in North Korean alphabetic order, and the letter names are romanised with the [[McCune–Reischauer|McCune-Reischauer]] system, which is widely used in North Korea. The tense consonants are described with the word {{lang|ko|된}} ''toen'' meaning "hard".

In North Korea, an alternative way to refer to a consonant is ''letter'' + ''ŭ'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}}), for example, gŭ ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|그}}) for the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}}, and ''ssŭ'' ({{lang|ko|쓰|nocat=yes}}) for the letter {{lang|ko|ㅆ|nocat=yes}}.

As in South Korea, the names of vowels in the Korean alphabet are the same as the sound of each vowel.

==Stroke order==
Letters in the Korean alphabet have adopted certain rules of Chinese calligraphy, although {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}} use a circle, which is not used in printed Chinese characters.

==Letter design==
{{Calligraphy}}
Scripts typically transcribe languages at the level of [[morpheme]]s ([[logogram|logographic scripts]] like Hanja), of [[syllable]]s ([[Syllabary|syllabaries]] like ''[[kana]]''), of [[segment (linguistics)|segment]]s ([[alphabet]]ic scripts like the [[Latin script]] used to write English and many other languages), or, on occasion, of [[distinctive features]]. The Korean alphabet incorporates aspects of the latter three, grouping sounds into [[syllable]]s, using distinct symbols for [[Segment (linguistics)|segments]], and in some cases using distinct strokes to indicate [[distinctive feature]]s such as [[place of articulation]] ([[labial consonant|labial]], [[coronal consonant|coronal]], [[velar consonant|velar]], or [[glottal consonant|glottal]]) and [[manner of articulation]] ([[plosive]], [[nasal stop|nasal]], [[sibilant consonant|sibilant]], [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]]) for consonants, and [[iotization]] (a preceding ''i-''sound), [[Vowel harmony|harmonic class]] and [[i-mutation]] for vowels.

For instance, the consonant {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} ṭ {{IPA|[tʰ]}} is composed of three strokes, each one meaningful: the top stroke indicates {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} is a plosive, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆆ}} ''ʔ'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} ''g'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} ''d'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}} ''j'', which have the same stroke (the last is an [[Affricate consonant|affricate]], a plosive–fricative sequence); the middle stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} is aspirated, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}} ''h'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅋ}} ''ḳ'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅊ}} ''ch'', which also have this stroke; and the bottom stroke indicates that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} is alveolar, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} ''n'', {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} ''d'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄹ}} ''l''. (This element is said to represent the shape of the tongue when pronouncing coronal consonants, though this is not certain.) Two consonants, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱ}}, have dual pronunciations, and appear to be composed of two elements corresponding to these two pronunciations: {{IPA|[ŋ]}}~silence for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} and {{IPA|[m]}}~{{IPA|[w]}} for obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱ}}.

With vowel letters, a short stroke connected to the main line of the letter indicates that this is one of the vowels that ''can'' be iotized; this stroke is then doubled when the vowel ''is'' iotized. The position of the stroke indicates which harmonic class the vowel belongs to, [[yin and yang|"light"]] (top or right) or [[yin and yang|"dark"]] (bottom or left). In the modern alphabet, an additional vertical stroke indicates [[i-mutation]], deriving {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅐ}} {{IPA|[ɛ]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅚ}} {{IPA|[ø]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅟ}} {{IPA|[y]}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}} {{IPA|[a]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}} {{IPA|[o]}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} {{IPA|[u]}}. However, this is not part of the intentional design of the script, but rather a natural development from what were originally [[diphthong]]s ending in the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Indeed, in many [[Dialects of Korean|Korean dialects]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} including the standard [[Seoul Dialect|dialect of Seoul]], some of these may still be diphthongs. Note: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}} {{IPA|[e]}} as a morpheme is ㅓ combined with ㅣ as a vertical stroke. As a phoneme, its sound is not by i-mutation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}} {{IPA|[ʌ]}}.

Some linguists have praised the Korean alphabet for its [[featural alphabet|featural]] design; beyond the fact that the shapes of the letters are related to the [[feature (phonology)|features]] of the sounds they represent, the Korean alphabet also attracts approval for the fact that vowels are made from vertical or horizontal lines so that they are easily distinguishable from consonants.

Although the design of the script may be featural, for all practical purposes it behaves as an alphabet. The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} is not read as three letters ''alveolar aspirated plosive'', for instance, but as a single consonant ''t''. Likewise, the former diphthong {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}} is read as a single vowel ''e''.

Beside the letters, the Korean alphabet originally employed [[diacritic mark]]s to indicate [[pitch accent]]. A syllable with a high pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|거성}}) was marked with a dot (&lt;span lang="ko" style="font-family: '은 자모 바탕', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif"&gt;ᅟᅠ〮&lt;/span&gt;) to the left of it (when writing vertically); a syllable with a rising pitch ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|상성}}) was marked with a double dot, like a colon (&lt;span lang="ko" style="font-family: '은 자모 바탕', Malgun Gothic, UnJamoBatang, UnBatang, Code2000, serif"&gt;ᅟᅠ〯&lt;/span&gt;). These are no longer used, as modern Seoul Korean has lost tonality. [[Vowel length]] has also been neutralized in Modern Korean,&lt;ref name="Kim-Renaud_Tranter"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=I7PTXPq_nSAC&amp;pg=PA127|title=The Languages of Japan and Korea|last=Kim-Renaud|first=Young-Key|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2012|isbn=9780415462877|editor-last=Tranter|editor-first=Nicolas|location=Oxon, UK|pages=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is no longer written.

=== Consonant design ===
The consonant letters fall into five [[wiktionary:homorganic|homorganic]] groups, each with a basic shape, and one or more letters derived from this shape by means of additional strokes. In the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' account, the basic shapes iconically represent the articulations the [[tongue]], [[palate]], [[teeth]], and [[throat]] take when making these sounds.

The Korean names for the groups are taken from Chinese [[phonetics]]:
* [[Velar consonant]]s ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|아음, 牙音}} ''a'eum'' "molar sounds")
**{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} ''g'' {{IPA|[k]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅋ}} ḳ {{IPA|[kʰ]}}
** Basic shape: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} is a side view of the back of the tongue raised toward the velum (soft palate). (For illustration, access the external link below.) {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅋ}} is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} with a stroke for the burst of aspiration.
* [[Sibilant consonant]]s (fricative or palatal) ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|치음, 齒音}} ''chieum'' "dental sounds"):
** {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} s {{IPA|[s]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}} j {{IPA|[tɕ]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅊ}} ch {{IPA|[tɕʰ]}}
** Basic shape: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} was originally shaped like a wedge ∧, without the [[serif]] on top. It represents a side view of the teeth. The line topping {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}} represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The stroke topping {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅊ}} represents an additional burst of aspiration.
* [[Coronal consonant]]s ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|설음, 舌音}} ''seoreum'' "lingual sounds"):
**{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} ''n'' {{IPA|[n]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} ''d'' {{IPA|[t]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} ṭ {{IPA|[tʰ]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄹ}} ''r'' {{IPA|[ɾ, l]}}
** Basic shape: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} is a side view of the tip of the tongue raised toward the [[alveolar ridge]] (gum ridge). The letters derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} are pronounced with the same basic articulation. The line topping {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} represents firm contact with the roof of the mouth. The middle stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} represents the burst of aspiration. The top of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄹ}} represents a [[flap consonant|flap]] of the tongue.
* [[Bilabial consonant]]s ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|순음, 唇音}} ''suneum'' "labial sounds"):
**{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} ''m'' {{IPA|[m]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} ''b'' {{IPA|[p]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅍ}} ''p̣'' {{IPA|[pʰ]}}
** Basic shape: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} represents the outline of the lips in contact with each other. The top of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} represents the release burst of the ''b''. The top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅍ}} is for the burst of aspiration.
* [[Dorsal consonant]]s ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|후음, 喉音}} ''hueum'' "throat sounds"):
**{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} '/''ng'' {{IPA|[ʔ, ŋ]}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}} ''h'' {{IPA|[h]}}
** Basic shape: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} is an outline of the throat. Originally {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} was two letters, a simple circle for silence (null consonant), and a circle topped by a vertical line, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}}, for the nasal ''ng''. A now obsolete letter, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆆ}}, represented a [[glottal stop]], which is pronounced in the throat and had closure represented by the top line, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱㄷㅈ}}. Derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆆ}} is {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}}, in which the extra stroke represents a burst of aspiration.

=== Vowel design ===
[[File:Hangul Vowel Diag.svg|thumb|450px|A diagram showing the derivation of vowels in the Korean alphabet.]]

Vowel letters are based on three elements:

* A horizontal line representing the flat Earth, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yin]]''.
* A point for the Sun in the heavens, the essence of ''[[yin and yang|yang]]''. (This becomes a short stroke when written with a brush.)
* A vertical line for the upright Human, the neutral mediator between the Heaven and Earth.

Short strokes (dots in the earliest documents) were added to these three basic elements to derive the vowel letter:

====Simple vowels====
* Horizontal letters: these are mid-high back vowels.
** bright {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}} ''o''
** dark {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} ''u''
** neutral {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}} ''eu'' (''ŭ'')
* Vertical letters: these were once low vowels.
** bright {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}} ''a''
** dark {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}} ''eo'' (''ŏ'')
** neutral {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} ''i''

====Compound vowels====
The Korean alphabet does not have a letter for ''w'' sound. Since an ''o'' or ''u'' before an ''a'' or ''eo'' became a {{IPA|[w]}} sound, and {{IPA|[w]}} occurred nowhere else, {{IPA|[w]}} could always be analyzed as a [[phoneme|phonemic]] ''o'' or ''u'', and no letter for {{IPA|[w]}} was needed. However, vowel harmony is observed: "dark" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}}&amp;nbsp;''u'' with "dark" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}}&amp;nbsp;''eo'' for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅝ}} ''wo;'' "bright" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}}&amp;nbsp;''o'' with "bright" {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}}&amp;nbsp;''a'' for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅘ}} ''wa'':

* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅘ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wa''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''o''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''a''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅝ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wo''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''u''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''eo''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅙ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wae''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''o''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅐ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ae''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅞ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''we''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''u''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''e''&lt;/small&gt;

The compound vowels ending in {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} ''i'' were originally [[diphthong]]s. However, several have since evolved into pure vowels:

* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅐ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ae''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''a''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt; (pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}})
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''e''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''eo''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt; (pronounced {{IPA|[e]}})
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅙ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wae''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅘ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wa''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅚ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''oe''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''o''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt; (formerly pronounced {{IPA|[ø]}}, see [[Korean phonology#Monophtongs|Korean phonology]])
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅞ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''we''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅝ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wo''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅟ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''wi''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''u''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt; (formerly pronounced {{IPA|[y]}}, see [[Korean phonology#Monophtongs|Korean phonology]])
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅢ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ui''&lt;/small&gt; = {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''eu''&lt;/small&gt; + {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''i''&lt;/small&gt;

====Iotized vowels====
There is no letter for ''y''. Instead, this sound is indicated by doubling the stroke attached to the baseline of the vowel letter. Of the seven basic vowels, four could be preceded by a ''y'' sound, and these four were written as a dot next to a line. (Through the influence of Chinese calligraphy, the dots soon became connected to the line: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓㅏㅜㅗ}}.) A preceding ''y'' sound, called "iotization", was indicated by doubling this dot: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅕㅑㅠㅛ}} &lt;small&gt;''yeo, ya, yu, yo''&lt;/small&gt;. The three vowels that could not be iotized were written with a single stroke: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡㆍㅣ}} &lt;small&gt;''eu, (arae a), i''&lt;/small&gt;.

The simple iotized vowels are:

* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅑ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ya''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''a''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅕ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''yeo''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''eo''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅛ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''yo''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''o''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅠ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''yu''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''u''&lt;/small&gt;

There are also two iotized diphthongs:

* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅒ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''yae''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅐ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ae''&lt;/small&gt;
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅖ}}&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''ye''&lt;/small&gt; from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅔ}} &amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;''e''&lt;/small&gt;

The Korean language of the 15th century had [[vowel harmony]] to a greater extent than it does today. Vowels in grammatical [[morpheme]]s changed according to their environment, falling into groups that "harmonized" with each other. This affected the [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] of the language, and Korean phonology described it in terms of ''yin'' and ''yang'': If a root word had ''yang'' ('bright') vowels, then most suffixes attached to it also had to have ''yang'' vowels; conversely, if the root had ''yin'' ('dark') vowels, the suffixes had to be ''yin'' as well. There was a third harmonic group called "mediating" ('neutral' in Western terminology) that could coexist with either ''yin'' or ''yang'' vowels.

The Korean neutral vowel was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} ''i''. The ''yin'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡㅜㅓ}} ''eu, u, eo''; the dots are in the ''yin'' directions of 'down' and 'left'. The ''yang'' vowels were {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍㅗㅏ}} ''ə, o, a,'' with the dots in the ''yang'' directions of 'up' and 'right'. The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'' states that the shapes of the non-dotted letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡㆍㅣ}} were chosen to represent the concepts of ''yin'', ''yang'', and mediation: Earth, Heaven, and Human. (The letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}} ''ə'' is now obsolete except in the Jeju language.)

The third parameter in designing the vowel letters was choosing {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} as the graphic base of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}} and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}}. A full understanding of what these horizontal and vertical groups had in common would require knowing the exact sound values these vowels had in the 15th century.

The uncertainty is primarily with the three letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍㅓㅏ}}. Some linguists reconstruct these as {{IPA|*a, *ɤ, *e}}, respectively; others as {{IPA|*ə, *e, *a}}. A third reconstruction is to make them all middle vowels as {{IPA|*ʌ, *ɤ, *a}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conf.ling.cornell.edu/whitman/FrellWhitman.pdf The Japanese/Korean Vowel Correspondences] by Bjarke Frellesvig and John Whitman.  Section 3 deals with Middle Korean vowels.&lt;/ref&gt; With the third reconstruction, Middle Korean vowels actually line up in a vowel harmony pattern, albeit with only one front vowel and four middle vowels:

{|class="wikitable"

|- style="vertical-align:top;"
|style="color:red;"|&amp;nbsp;{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅏ}} {{IPA|*a}}
|}

However, the horizontal letters {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡㅜㅗ}} &lt;small&gt;''eu,&amp;nbsp;u,&amp;nbsp;o''&lt;/small&gt; do all appear to have been mid to high [[back vowel]]s, {{IPA|[*ɯ, *u, *o]}}, and thus to have formed a coherent group phonetically in every reconstruction.

====Traditional account====
{{See also|Origin of Hangul}}
The generally accepted account&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The explanation of the origin of the shapes of the letters is provided within a section of [[Hunminjeongeum]] itself, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|훈민정음 해례본 제자해}} (Hunminjeongeum Haeryebon Jajahae ''or'' Hunminjeongeum, Chapter: Paraphrases and Examples, Section: Making of Letters), which states: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|牙音ㄱ 象舌根閉喉之形. (아음(어금니 소리) ㄱ은 혀뿌리가 목구멍을 막는 모양을 본뜨고), 舌音ㄴ 象舌附上腭之形 ( 설음(혓 소리) ㄴ은 혀(끝)가 윗 잇몸에 붙는 모양을 본뜨고), 脣音ㅁ 象口形. ( 순음(입술소리) ㅁ은 입모양을 본뜨고), 齒音ㅅ 象齒形.

Here, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}} symbolically stands for the (sun in) heaven, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}} stands for the (flat) earth, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} stands for an (upright) human. The original sequence of the Korean vowels, as stated in [[Hunminjeongeum]], listed these three vowels first, followed by various combinations. Thus, the original order of the vowels was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ ㅡ ㅣ ㅗ ㅏ ㅜ ㅓ ㅛ ㅑ ㅠ ㅕ}}. Note that two positive vowels ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅗ ㅏ}}) including one {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}} are followed by two negative vowels including one {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}}, then by two positive vowels each including two of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}}, and then by two negative vowels each including two of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆍ}}.

The same theory provides the most simple explanation of the shapes of the consonants as an approximation of the shapes of the most representative organ needed to form that sound. The original order of the consonants in Hunminjeong'eum was: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ ㅋ ㆁ ㄷ ㅌ ㄴ ㅂ ㅍ ㅁ ㅈ ㅊ ㅅ ㆆ ㅎ ㅇ ㄹ ㅿ}}.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} representing the {{IPA|/k/}} sound geometrically describes a tongue just before the moment of pronunciation as the tongue blocks the passage of air.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅋ}} representing the {{IPA|/kʰ/}} sound is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} by adding another stroke.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} representing the {{IPA|/ŋ/}} sound may have been derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} by addition of a stroke.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} representing the {{IPA|/t/}} sound is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} by addition of a stroke.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅌ}} representing the {{IPA|/tʰ/}} sound is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} by adding another stroke.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄴ}} representing the {{IPA|/n/}} sound geometrically describes a tongue making contact with an upper palate just before making the "n" sound.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} representing the {{IPA|/p/}} sound is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} by adding strokes.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅍ}} representing the {{IPA|/pʰ/}} sound is a variant of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}}, which is obtained by rotating 90 degrees and extending the horizontal strokes.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} representing the {{IPA|/m/}} sound geometrically describes a closed mouth before opening the lips.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}} representing the {{IPA|/tɕ/}} sound is derived from the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} by adding strokes.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅊ}} representing the {{IPA|/tɕʰ/}} sound is derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}} by adding another stroke.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} representing the {{IPA|/s/}} sound geometrically describes a near contact between the tongue and the teeth.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}&lt;!-- not a diagram of the tooth? - While the literal text of 훈민정음 해례본 제자해 talks only about teeth (or a tooth), all root consonants (ㄱ, ㄴ, ㅁ) include the shape of the tongue.  It is more likely the shape of ㅅ represents the contact between the teeth AND the tongue (dental consonants) --&gt;

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆆ}} representing the {{IPA|/ʔ/}} sound geometrically describes an open throat with a bar to indicate that there is an aspiration.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}} representing the {{IPA|/h/}} sound is derived from ㆆ with the extra stroke representing a stronger flow of the aspiration.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} representing the absence of a consonant geometrically describes an open mouth, which necessarily accompanies the following vowel.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄹ}} representing the {{IPA|/ɾ/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} sounds geometrically describes a backward-bending tongue.

{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅿ}} representing a weak {{IPA|/z/}} sound is also derived from the shape of the teeth, but has a different origin than {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}}{{clarify|date=May 2013}} and is not derived from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} by addition of a stroke.

====Ledyard's theory of consonant design====
[[File:King Sejong statue inscription.jpg|thumb|A close-up of the inscription on the statue of King Sejong above. It reads ''Sejong Daewang'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|세종대왕}} and illustrates the forms of the letters originally promulgated by Sejong. Note the dots on the vowels, the geometric symmetry of ''s'' and ''j'' in the first two syllables, the asymmetrical lip at the top-left of the ''d'' in the third, and the distinction between initial and final ''ieung'' in the last.]]
[[File:Phagspa-Hangul comparison.svg|thumb|
(Top) 'Phags-pa letters {{IPA|[k, t, p, s, l]}}, and their supposed Korean derivatives {{IPA|[k, t, p, ts, l]}}. Note the lip on both 'Phags-pa {{IPA|[t]}} and the Korean alphabet {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}}.&lt;br/&gt;
(Bottom) Derivation of 'Phags-pa ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' from variants of the letter {{IPA|[h]}} (left) plus a subscript {{IPA|[w]}}, and analogous composition of the Korean alphabet ''w'', ''v, ''f'' from variants of the basic letter {{IPA|[p]}} plus a circle.]]

Although the ''Hunminjeong'eum Haerye'' explains the design of the consonantal letters in terms of [[articulatory phonetics]], as a purely innovative creation, several theories suggest which external sources may have inspired or influenced King Sejong's creation. Professor [[Gari Ledyard]] of Columbia University studied possible connections between Hangul and the Mongol [['Phags-pa script]] of the [[Yuan dynasty]]. He believed that the role of 'Phags-pa script in the creation of the Korean alphabet was quite limited:

{{quotation|It should be clear to any reader that in the total picture, that ['Phags-pa script's] role was quite limited ... Nothing would disturb me more, after this study is published, than to discover in a work on the history of writing a statement like the following: "According to recent investigations, the Korean alphabet was derived from ''the Mongol's [[phags-pa script]]''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Korean language reform of 1446: the origin, background, and Early History of the Korean Alphabet'', Gari Keith Ledyard. University of California, 1966, p. 367–368.&lt;/ref&gt; An affine theory states that the consonants are derived from the shape of the speaker's lips and tongue during the pronunciation of the consonants (initially, at least), but this would appear somewhat to strain credulity.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Daniels and William Bright, ''The World's Writing Systems'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 219-220&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ledyard posits that five of the Korean letters have shapes inspired by 'Phags-pa; a sixth basic letter, the null initial {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}}, was invented by Sejong. The rest of the letters were derived internally from these six, essentially as described in the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye''. However, the five borrowed consonants were not the graphically simplest letters considered basic by the ''Hunmin Jeong-eum Haerye'', but instead the consonants basic to Chinese phonology: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}}, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅈ}}, and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄹ}}.

The ''Hunmin Jeong-eum'' states that King Sejong adapted the {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|古篆}} (''gojeon'', "''Gǔ'' Seal Script") in creating the Korean alphabet. The {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|古篆}} has never been identified. The primary meaning of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|古}} ''gǔ'' is "old" ("Old Seal Script"), frustrating philologists because the Korean alphabet bears no functional similarity to Chinese {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|篆字}} ''zhuànzì'' [[seal script]]s. However, Ledyard believes {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|古}} ''gǔ'' may be a pun on {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|蒙古}} ''Měnggǔ'' "Mongol", and that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|古篆}} is an abbreviation of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|蒙古篆字}} "Mongol Seal Script", that is, the formal variant of the 'Phags-pa alphabet written to look like the Chinese seal script. There were 'Phags-pa manuscripts in the Korean palace library, including some in the seal-script form, and several of Sejong's ministers knew the script well.

If this was the case, Sejong's evasion on the Mongol connection can be understood in light of Korea's relationship with [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] China after the fall of the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]], and of the literati's contempt for the Mongols as "barbarians".

According to Ledyard, the five borrowed letters were graphically simplified, which allowed for consonant clusters and left room to add a stroke to derive the aspirate plosives, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅋㅌㅍㅊ}}. But in contrast to the traditional account, the non-plosives ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ ㄴ ㅁ ㅅ}}) were derived by ''removing'' the top of the basic letters. He points out that while it is easy to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} by removing the top, it is not clear how to derive {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} in the traditional account, since the shape of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅂ}} is not analogous to those of the other plosives.

The explanation of the letter ''ng'' also differs from the traditional account. Many Chinese words began with ''ng'', but by King Sejong's day, initial ''ng'' was either silent or pronounced {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in China, and was silent when these words were borrowed into Korean. Also, the expected shape of ''ng'' (the short vertical line left by removing the top stroke of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}}) would have looked almost identical to the vowel {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} {{IPA|[i]}}. Sejong's solution solved both problems: The vertical stroke left from {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}} was added to the null symbol {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} to create {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} (a circle with a vertical line on top), iconically capturing both the pronunciation {{IPA|[ŋ]}} in the middle or end of a word, and the usual silence at the beginning. (The graphic distinction between null {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} and ''ng'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆁ}} was eventually lost.)

Another letter composed of two elements to represent two regional pronunciations was {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱ}}, which transcribed the Chinese [[Syllable onset|initial]] {{lang|zh|微}}. This represented either ''m'' or ''w'' in various Chinese dialects, and was composed of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁ}} [m] plus {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} (from 'Phags-pa [w]). In 'Phags-pa, a loop under a letter represented ''w'' after vowels, and Ledyard hypothesized that this became the loop at the bottom of {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱ}}. In 'Phags-pa the Chinese initial {{lang|zh|微}} is also transcribed as a compound with ''w'', but in its case the ''w'' is placed under an ''h''. Actually, the Chinese consonant series {{lang|zh|微非敷}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f'' is transcribed in 'Phags-pa by the addition of a ''w'' under three graphic variants of the letter for ''h'', and the Korean alphabet parallels this convention by adding the ''w'' loop to the labial series {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅁㅂㅍ}} ''m'', ''b'', ''p'', producing now-obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱㅸㆄ}} ''w'', ''v'', ''f.'' (Phonetic values in Korean are uncertain, as these consonants were only used to transcribe Chinese.)

As a final piece of evidence, Ledyard notes that most of the borrowed Korean letters were simple geometric shapes, at least originally, but that {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄷ}} ''d'' [t] always had a small lip protruding from the upper left corner, just as the 'Phags-pa ''d'' [t] did. This lip can be traced back to the Tibetan letter ''d''.

==Obsolete letters==

Numerous obsolete Korean letters and sequences are no longer used in Korean. Some of these letters were only ever used to represent the sounds of Chinese [[rime table]]s. Some of the Korean sounds represented by these obsolete letters still exist in some dialects.

In the original Korean alphabet system, double letters were used to represent Chinese [[Voice (phonetics)|voiced]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|濁音}}) consonants, which survive in the [[Shanghainese (dialect)|Shanghainese]] [[slack voice|slack]] consonants and were not used for Korean words. It was only later that a similar convention was used to represent the modern "tense" ([[Faucalized voice|faucalized]]) consonants of Korean.

The sibilant ("dental") consonants were modified to represent the two series of Chinese sibilants, [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]] and [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]], a "round" vs. "sharp" distinction (analogous to ''s'' vs ''sh'') which was never made in Korean, and was even being lost from southern Chinese. The alveolar letters had longer left stems, while retroflexes had longer right stems:

=== Most common ===
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|[[wikt:ㆍ|ㆍ]]}} ''ə'' (in Modern Korean called ''arae-a'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|아래아}} "lower ''a"''): Presumably pronounced {{IPAblink|ʌ}}, similar to modern {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅓ}} (''eo''). It is written as a dot, positioned beneath the consonant. The ''arae-a'' is not entirely obsolete, as it can be found in various brand names, and in the [[Chejuan language|Jeju language]], where it is pronounced {{IPAblink|ɒ}}. The ''ə'' formed a medial of its own, or was found in the diphthong {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆎ}} ''əy'', written with the dot under the consonant and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} (''i'') to its right, in the same fashion as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅚ}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅢ}}.
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|[[wikt:ㅿ|ㅿ]]}} ''z'' (''bansiot'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|반시옷}} "half ''s''", ''banchieum'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|반치음}}): An unusual sound, perhaps IPA {{IPA|[ʝ̃]}} (a [[nasalized]] [[Voiced palatal fricative|palatal fricative]]). Modern Korean words previously spelled with {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅿ}} substitute {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅅ}} or {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}}.
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|[[wikt:ㆆ|ㆆ]]}} ''ʔ'' (''yeorinhieuh'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|여린히읗}} "light hieut" or ''doenieung'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|된이응}} "strong ieung"): A [[glottal stop]], "lighter than {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎ}} and harsher than {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}}".
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|[[wikt:ㆁ|ㆁ]]}} ''ŋ'' (''yesieung'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|옛이응}}): The original letter for {{IPA|[ŋ]}}; now conflated with {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} ''ieung''. (With some computer [[typeface|fonts]] such as [[Arial Unicode MS]], ''yesieung'' is shown as a flattened version of ''ieung,'' but the correct form is with a long peak, longer than what one would see on a [[serif]] version of ''ieung''.)
* {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|[[wikt:ㅸ|ㅸ]]}} ''β'' (''gabyeounbieup'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|가벼운비읍}}, ''sungyeongeumbieup'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|순경음비읍}}): IPA {{IPA|[f]}}. This letter appears to be a digraph of ''bieup'' and ''ieung'', but it may be more complicated than that. There were three other, less-common letters for sounds in this section of the Chinese [[rime table]]s, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅱ}} ''w'' ({{IPA|[w]}} or {{IPA|[m]}}), a theoretical {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆄ}} ''f'', and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅹ}} ''ff'' {{IPA|[v̤]}}; the bottom element appears to be only coincidentally similar to ''ieung''. Whatever its exact shape, it operates somewhat like a following ''h'' in the Latin alphabet (one may think of these letters as ''bh, mh, ph,'' and ''pph'' respectively). Koreans do not distinguish these sounds now, if they ever did, conflating the [[fricative]]s with the corresponding [[plosive]]s.

==Restored letters==
[[File:NOoK-example.png|thumb|The words {{lang|ko|놉니다, 흘렀다, 깨달으니, 지어, 고와, 왕, 가져서}} written in New Orthography.]]
To make the Korean alphabet a perfect [[morphophonology|morphophonological]] fit to the Korean language, North Korea introduced six new letters, which were published in the ''[[New Orthography for the Korean Language]]'' and used officially from 1948 to 1954.

Two obsolete letters were restored: {{angle bracket|{{lang|ko|ㅿ}}}} ({{lang|ko|리읃}}), which was used to indicate an alternation in pronunciation between initial {{IPA|/l/}} and final {{IPA|/d/}}; and {{angle bracket|{{lang|ko|ㆆ}}}} ({{lang|ko|히으}}), which was only pronounced between vowels. Two modifications of the letter {{lang|ko|ㄹ}} were introduced, one for a {{lang|ko|ㄹ}}, which is silent finally, and one for a {{lang|ko|ㄹ}}, which doubled between vowels. A hybrid {{lang|ko|ㅂ-ㅜ}} letter was introduced for words that alternated between those two sounds (that is, a {{IPA|/b/}}, which became {{IPA|/w/}} before a vowel). Finally, a vowel {{angle bracket|{{lang|ko|1}}}} was introduced for variable [[iotation]].

* 11,172 precomposed syllables in the Korean alphabet make up the [[Hangul Syllables|Korean Alphabet syllables]] block (U+AC00–U+D7A3)

==Morpho-syllabic blocks==
Except for a few grammatical morphemes prior to the twentieth century, no letter stands alone to represent elements of the Korean language. Instead, letters are grouped into [[syllable|syllabic]] or [[morpheme|morphemic]] blocks of at least two and often three: a consonant or a doubled consonant called the ''initial'' (&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;초성, 初聲&lt;/span&gt; ''choseong'' [[syllable onset]]), a vowel or [[diphthong]] called the ''medial'' (&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;중성, 中聲&lt;/span&gt; ''jungseong'' [[syllable nucleus]]), and, optionally, a consonant or consonant cluster at the end of the syllable, called the ''final'' (&lt;span lang="ko"&gt;종성, 終聲&lt;/span&gt; ''jongseong'' [[syllable coda]]). When a syllable has no actual initial consonant, the [[zero consonant|null initial]] {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} ''ieung'' is used as a placeholder. (In the modern Korean alphabet, placeholders are not used for the final position.) Thus, a block contains a minimum of two letters, an initial and a medial. Although the Korean alphabet had historically been organized into syllables, in the modern orthography it is first organized into morphemes, and only secondarily into syllables within those morphemes, with the exception that single-consonant morphemes may not be written alone.

The sets of initial and final consonants are not the same. For instance, {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}} ''ng'' only occurs in final position, while the doubled letters that can occur in final position are limited to {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅆ}} ''ss'' and {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄲ}} ''kk''.

Not including obsolete letters, 11,172 blocks are possible in the Korean alphabet.

=== Letter placement within a block ===
{{Alphabet}}
The placement or "stacking" of letters in the block follows set patterns based on the shape of the medial.

Consonant and vowel sequences such as {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅄ}} ''bs,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅝ}} ''wo,'' or obsolete {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅵ}} ''bsd,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㆋ}} ''üye'' are written left to right.

Vowels (medials) are written under the initial consonant, to the right, or wrap around the initial from bottom to right, depending on their shape: If the vowel has a horizontal axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅡ}} ''eu,'' then it is written under the initial; if it has a vertical axis like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅣ}} ''i,'' then it is written to the right of the initial; and if it combines both orientations, like {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅢ}} ''ui,'' then it wraps around the initial from the bottom to the right:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{|
|- align=center
|  style="width:30px; background:#faa; height:60px;"|initial||  style="background:#afa; width:30px;"|medial
|}
{{col-break|gap=1em}}

|- align=center
|  style="background:#afa; height:30px;"|med.&amp;nbsp;1
|}
{{col-end}}

A final consonant, if present, is always written at the bottom, under the vowel. This is called {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|받침}} ''batchim'' "supporting floor":

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{|
|- align=center
|  style="width:30px; background:#faa; height:40px;"|initial
|  style="background:#afa; width:30px;"|medial
|- align=center
|  style="background:#aaf; height:20px;" colspan="2"|final
|}
{{col-break|gap=1em}}
{|
|- align=center

|- align=center
|  style="background:#afa; height:20px;"|medial
|- align=center

|}
{{col-break|gap=1em}}
{|
|- align=center

|  style="background:#afa; width:30px;" rowspan="2"|med.&lt;br&gt;2
|- align=center
|  style="background:#afa; height:20px;"|med.
|- align=center
|  style="background:#aaf; height:20px;" colspan="2"|final
|}
{{col-end}}

A complex final is written left to right:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
{|
|- align=center
|  style="background:#faa; height:40px;"|initial
| style="background:#afa;" colspan="2"|medial
|-  style="text-align:center; background:#aaf;"
| colspan="2" style="height:20px;"|final 1
||final 2
|}
{{col-break|gap=1em}}
{|
|- align=center
| colspan="2"  style="background:#faa; width:60px; height:20px;"|initial
|- align=center
|  style="background:#afa; height:20px;" colspan="2"|medial
|-  style="text-align:center; background:#aaf;"
|  style="height:20px;"|final 1
||final 2
|}
{{col-break|gap=1em}}
{|
|- align=center
|  style="width:30px; background:#faa; height:20px;"|initial
|  style="background:#afa; width:30px;" colspan="2" rowspan="2"|med.&lt;br&gt;2
|- align=center
|  style="background:#afa; height:20px;"|med.
|-  style="text-align:center; background:#aaf;"
| colspan="2" style="height:20px;"|fin. 1
||fin. 2
|}
{{col-end}}

Blocks are always written in phonetic order, initial-medial-final. Therefore:
* Syllables with a horizontal medial are written downward: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|읍}} ''eup'';
* Syllables with a vertical medial and simple final are written clockwise: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|쌍}} ''ssang'';
* Syllables with a wrapping medial switch direction (down-right-down): {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|된}} ''doen'';
* Syllables with a complex final are written left to right at the bottom: {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|밟}} ''balp''.

=== Block shape ===
Normally the resulting block is written within a square of the same size and shape as a Hanja (Chinese character) by compressing or stretching the letters to fill the bounds of the block; therefore someone not familiar with the scripts may mistake the Korean alphabet for Hanja or Chinese.

However, some recent fonts (for example Eun,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wazu.jp/gallery/Fonts_Korean.html|title=Korean Unicode Fonts|first=Craig|last=Welch|website=www.wazu.jp}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|HY깊은샘물M}}, UnJamo]) move towards the European practice of letters whose relative size is fixed, and use whitespace to fill letter positions not used in a particular block, and away from the East Asian tradition of square block characters ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|方块字}}). They break one or more of the traditional rules:
* Do not stretch initial consonant vertically, but leave [[Space (punctuation)|white space]] below if no lower vowel and/or no final consonant.
* Do not stretch right-hand vowel vertically, but leave white space below if no final consonant. (Often the right-hand vowel extends farther down than the left-hand consonant, like a [[descender]] in European typography)
* Do not stretch final consonant horizontally, but leave white space to its left.
* Do not stretch or pad each block to a [[fixed width]], but allow [[kerning]] (variable width) where syllable blocks with no right-hand vowel and no double final consonant can be narrower than blocks that do have a right-hand vowel or double final consonant.

These fonts have been used as design accents on signs or headings, rather than for typesetting large volumes of body text.

=== Linear Korean ===
There was a minor and unsuccessful movement in the early twentieth century to abolish syllabic blocks and write the letters individually and in a row, in the fashion of writing [[Latin alphabet]] as in English and other European languages.  e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅎㅏㄴㄱㅡㄹ}} for {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|한글}} ''Hangeul.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vj8ShHzUxrYC&amp;pg=PA162 |title=Korea: A Historical and Cultural Dictionary - Keith L. Pratt, Richard Rutt, James Hoare - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1999-09-13 |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called 풀어쓰기 (''pul-eo-sseu-gi'' 'unassembled writing').

Avant-garde typographer Ahn Sangsu made a font for the "Hangul Dada" exposition that exploded the syllable blocks; but while it strings out the letters horizontally, it retains the distinctive vertical position each letter would normally have within a block, unlike the century-old linear writing proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ezer |first=Oded |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/oded_ezer/317881477/ |title=Hangul Dada, Seoul, Korea|publisher=Flickr |accessdate=2012-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such an idea of writing Korean with Hangul jamo without being assembled into syllabic characters is of a historical interest only as it foregoes the most distinctive feature of the Hangul writing system, that is, the standard convention of 모아쓰기 (''mo-a-sseu-gi'' 'assembled writing').

==Orthography==
Until the 20th century, no official orthography of the Korean alphabet had been established. Due to liaison, heavy consonant assimilation, dialectal variants and other reasons, a Korean word can potentially be spelled in multiple ways. Sejong seemed to prefer [[Morphophonology|morphophonemic]] spelling (representing the underlying root forms) rather than a [[phoneme|phonemic]] one (representing the actual sounds). However, early in its history the Korean alphabet was dominated by phonemic spelling. Over the centuries the orthography became partially morphophonemic, first in nouns and later in verbs. The modern Korean alphabet is as morphophonemic as is practical. The difference between phonetic Romanization, phonemic orthography and morpho-phonemic orthography can be illustrated with the phrase ''motaneun sarami'':

After the [[Gabo Reform]] in 1894, the [[Joseon Dynasty]] and later the [[Korean Empire]] started to write all official documents in the Korean alphabet. Under the government's management, proper usage of the Korean alphabet and Hanja, including orthography, was discussed, until the Korean Empire was [[Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty|annexed]] by Japan in 1910.

The [[Government-General of Korea]] popularised a writing style that mixed Hanja and the Korean alphabet, and was used in the later Joseon dynasty. The government revised the spelling rules in 1912, 1921 and 1930, to be relatively phonemic.

The [[Hangul Society]], founded by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], announced a proposal for a new, strongly morphophonemic orthography in 1933, which became the prototype of the contemporary orthographies in both North and South Korea. After Korea was divided, the North and South revised orthographies separately. The guiding text for orthography of the Korean alphabet is called ''Hangeul Matchumbeop'', whose last South Korean revision was published in 1988 by the Ministry of Education.

=== Mixed scripts ===
[[File:Gardena in mixed Latin-hangul.jpg|thumb|The U.S. city of [[Gardena, California|Gardena]] in the Korean alphabet, with the {{IPA|[ɡ]}} written as Latin {{angle bracket|G}}. (Compare this large {{angle bracket|G}} with the smaller {{angle bracket|G}} in all-Latin ''Gardena'' below: The large {{angle bracket|G}} is fused (at bottom-right) with the Korean alphabet {{angle bracket|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㄱ}}}} that would normally be used to transcribe ''Gardena''.)]]
Since the Late Joseon dynasty period, various [[Korean mixed script|Hanja-Hangul mixed systems]] were used. In these systems, Hanja were used for lexical roots, and the Korean alphabet for grammatical words and inflections, much as ''kanji'' and ''kana'' are used in Japanese. Hanja have been almost entirely phased out of daily use in North Korea, and in South Korea they are mostly restricted to parenthetical glosses for proper names and for disambiguating homonyms.

[[Hindu–Arabic numeral system|Indo-Arabic numerals]] are mixed in with the Korean alphabet, e.g. {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|2007년 3월 22일}} (22 March 2007).

[[Latin script]] and occasionally other scripts may be sprinkled within Korean texts for illustrative purposes, or for unassimilated [[loanword]]s. Very occasionally non-Hangul letters may be mixed into Korean syllabic blocks, as {{nobreak|{{lang|nocat=yes|ko|Gㅏ}}}} ''Ga'' at right.

==Readability==
Because of syllable clustering, words are shorter on the page than their linear counterparts would be, and the boundaries between syllables are easily visible (which may aid reading, if segmenting words into syllables is more natural for the reader than dividing them into phonemes).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the component parts of the syllable are relatively simple phonemic characters, the number of strokes per character on average is lower than in Chinese characters. Unlike syllabaries, such as Japanese kana, or Chinese logographs, none of which encode the constituent phonemes within a syllable, the graphic complexity of Korean syllabic blocks varies in direct proportion with the phonemic complexity of the syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike linear alphabets such as [[Latin-script alphabet|those derived from Latin]], Korean orthography allows the reader to "utilize both the horizontal and vertical visual fields".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1980|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, since Korean syllables are represented both as collections of phonemes and as unique-looking graphs, they may allow for both visual and aural retrieval of words from the [[lexicon]].

==Style==
[[File:Hangul TypeStyles sansPen.svg|150x150px|right]]
The Korean alphabet may be written either vertically or horizontally. The traditional direction is from top to bottom, right to left. Horizontal writing in the style of the Latin script was promoted by [[Ju Si-gyeong]], and has become overwhelmingly prevalent.

In ''[[Hunmin Jeongeum]]'', the Korean alphabet was printed in sans-serif angular lines of even thickness. This style is found in books published before about 1900, and can be found in stone carvings (on statues, for example).

Over the centuries, an ink-brush style of [[calligraphy]] developed, employing the same style of lines and angles as traditional Korean calligraphy. This brush style is called ''gungche'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|궁체 宮體}}), which means "Palace Style" because the style was mostly developed and used by the maidservants (''gungnyeo,'' {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|궁녀 宮女}}) of the court in [[Joseon|Joseon dynasty]].

Modern styles that are more suited for printed media were developed in the 20th century. In 1993, new names for both [[Ming (typefaces)|Myeongjo]] ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|明朝}}) and [[East Asian gothic typeface|Gothic]] styles were introduced when Ministry of Culture initiated an effort to standardize typographic terms, and the names ''Batang'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|바탕}}, meaning "background") and ''Dotum'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|돋움}}, meaning "stand out") replaced Myeongjo and Gothic respectively. These names are also used in [[Microsoft Windows]].

A sans-serif style with lines of equal width is popular with pencil and pen writing and is often the default typeface of Web browsers. A minor advantage of this style is that it makes it easier to distinguish ''-eung'' from ''-ung'' even in small or untidy print, as the ''jongseong ieung'' ({{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅇ}}) of such fonts usually lacks a [[serif]] that could be mistaken for the short vertical line of the letter {{lang|nocat=yes|ko|ㅜ}} ''(u)''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1876">In [[broadcast programming]], a '''hot switch''' or '''hotswitching''' is where the ending of one [[television show]] leads directly into the start of the show in the next time slot without a [[television commercial]] break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=PBS Plans Promotional Breaks Within Programs |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/31/business/media/31adco.html?hp |quote=Under the new plan, there would be no break between shows, a transition known as a “hot switch” used by many cable networks.  |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=May 30, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is used to reduce the chances that people will switch to another [[TV network]] during the commercial break and allow the [[cold open]] of the new show to attract viewers; sometimes however, this will cause a commercial break right after the [[opening credits]]. It can also be called "seamless" broadcasting and is frequently used during [[Marathon (television)|television marathons]] and back-to-back airings of episodes of the same series. The technique is also used by many local network affiliates in the [[United States]] to seamlessly transition from a local newscast to a network newscast.

==Examples==
In December 1992, for the premiere of ''[[The Jackie Thomas Show]]'', a hot switch was used where the end of an episode of ''[[Roseanne]]'' had the Connor family watching the new show on television, and then the new show then began. To see if this worked, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] paid [[ACNielsen]] for a minute by minute ratings report, and found that most viewers stayed with the new show for the entire [[television pilot|pilot episode]].&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Bill. "ABC's Extra Careful Look At 'Jackie Thomas Show'." New York Times, 1992-12-07, p. D8.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''ITL International Journal of Applied Linguistics''''' is a [[Peer review|refereed]] [[Academic journal|journal]] that welcomes manuscripts in the broad area of [[applied linguistics]], particularly  contributions relating to [[language acquisition]] (second language acquisition and foreign/second language teaching, including computer-assisted learning) and educational linguistics. The journal publishes reports of empirical studies and  theoretical articles; each issue also includes book reviews. The journal is published twice a year by the Department of Linguistics at the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|K.U.Leuven]], the Department of Applied Linguistics of the [[Vlekho|VLEKHO]] ([[Brussels]]) and the Department of Applied Linguistics of the [[Lessius Hogeschool]] ([[Antwerp]]). The name ITL refers to the center of applied linguistics at the K.U.Leuven where the journal was founded (Instituut voor Toegepaste Linguïstiek). The journal has recently merged with ''Interface, Journal of Applied Linguistics'', formerly published by the Department of Applied Linguistics (VLEKHO, Brussels), and now bears the name ''ITL International Journal of Applied Linguistics''.

The ancient and original form did not include the words, "a sinner", which were added later.&lt;ref name=Ware &gt;''On the Prayer of Jesus'' by Ignatius Brianchaninov, Kallistos Ware 2006 {{ISBN|1-59030-278-8}} pages xxiii–xxiv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mathewes-Green2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederica Mathewes-Green|title=The Jesus Prayer: The Ancient Desert Prayer that Tunes the Heart to God|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hHIG2hFP8QYC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2009|publisher=Paraclete Press|isbn=978-1-55725-659-1|page=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often repeated continually as a part of personal [[ascetic]] practice, its use being an integral part of the [[eremitic]] tradition of [[prayer]] known as [[Hesychasm]].{{efn|{{lang-grc|ἡσυχάζω}}, ''isycházo'', "to keep stillness".}} The prayer is particularly esteemed by the spiritual fathers of this tradition (see ''[[Philokalia]]'') as a method of opening up the heart (''kardia'') and bringing about the '''Prayer of the Heart''' ({{lang|el|Καρδιακή Προσευχή}}). The Prayer of The Heart is considered to be the Unceasing Prayer that the apostle [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] advocates in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="OrthodoxWiki"/&gt; [[Theophan the Recluse]] regarded the ''Jesus Prayer'' stronger than all other prayers by virtue of the power of the [[Holy Name of Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Ware /&gt;

As distinct from the prayer itself, the Eastern Orthodox theology of the Jesus Prayer enunciated in the 14th century by [[Gregory Palamas]] was generally rejected by Latin Catholic theologians until the 20th century, but Pope John Paul II called Gregory Palamas a saint,&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/1979/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19791130_turkey-efeso_fr.html Pope John Paul II, Homily at Ephesus, 30 November 1979]&lt;/ref&gt; cited him as a great writer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_12111997_en.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 12 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; and an authority on theology&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/alpha/data/aud19901114en.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 14 November 1990]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1997/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_12111997_it.html Pope John Paul II, General Audience, 19 November 1997]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2000/apr-jun/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20000525_jubilee-science_en.html Pope John Paul II, Jubilee of Scientists]&lt;/ref&gt; and spoke with appreciation of Palamas's intent "to emphasize the concrete possibility that man is given to unite himself with the Triune God in the intimacy of his heart".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]]'s [http://www.catholicculture.org/library/view.cfm?recnum=5660 Angelus Message], 11 August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Jesus Prayer can be seen the Eastern counterpart of the [[rosary]], which has developed to hold a similar place in the Christian West.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosarium Virginis Mariae]] [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The prayer's origin is most likely the [[Thebaid|Egyptian desert]], which was settled by the monastic [[Desert Fathers]] and [[Desert Mothers]] in the 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Antoine Guillaumont reports the finding of an inscription containing the Jesus Prayer in the ruins of a cell in the Egyptian desert dated roughly to the period being discussed&amp;nbsp;– Antoine Guillaumont, ''Une inscription coe sur la prière de Jesus'' in ''Aux origines du monachisme chrétien, Pour une phénoménologie du monachisme'', pp. 168–83. In ''Spiritualité orientale et vie monastique'', No 30. Bégrolles en Mauges (Maine &amp; Loire), France: Abbaye de Bellefontaine.&lt;/ref&gt;

A formula similar to the standard form of the Jesus Prayer is found in a letter attributed to [[John Chrysostom]], who died in AD&amp;nbsp;407. This "Letter to an Abbot" speaks of "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy" and "Lord Jesus Christ, son of God, have mercy on us" being used as ceaseless prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://khazarzar.skeptik.net/pgm/PG_Migne/John%20Chrysostom_PG%2047-64/Epistula%20ad%20abbatem.pdf ''Epistula ad abbatem'', p. 5]&lt;/ref&gt; However, some consider this letter dubious or spurious and attribute it to an unknown writer of unknown date.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolopoulos, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

What may be the earliest explicit reference to the Jesus Prayer in a form that is similar to that used today is in ''Discourse on Abba Philimon'' from the ''[[Philokalia]]''. Philimon lived around AD&amp;nbsp;600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McGinn, Bernard |title=The essential writings of Christian mysticism |publisher=Modern Library |location=New York |year=2006 |page=125 |isbn=0-8129-7421-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKkJs-KHCakC&amp;pg=PA125}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The version cited by Philimon is, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy upon me," which is apparently the earliest source to cite this standard version.&lt;ref name="Philokalia507"&gt;{{cite book |author=Palmer, G.E.H. |title=The Philokalia, Volume 2 |publisher=Faber |location=London |year= |page=507 |isbn=|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=aBkJAARHyoMC&amp;pg=PA507}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the prayer itself was in use by that time, [[John S. Romanides]] writes that "We are still searching the Fathers for the term 'Jesus prayer.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romanity.org/htm/rom.00.en.some_underlying_positions_of_this_website.htm John S. Romanides, ''Some Underlying Positions of This Website'', 11, note]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar idea is recommended in the ''[[Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' of [[John Climacus]] (circa 523–606), who recommends the regular practice of a ''monologistos'', or one-worded "Jesus Prayer".&lt;ref name="Mathewes-Green2009" /&gt; The use of the Jesus Prayer according to the tradition of the ''Philokalia'' is the subject of the 19th century anonymous Russian spiritual classic ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'', also in the original form, without the addition of the words "a sinner".&lt;ref name="wayofpilgrim" /&gt;

Though the Jesus Prayer has been practiced through the centuries as part of the Eastern tradition, in the 20th century, it also began to be used in some Western churches, including some Latin Catholic and [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] churches.

==Theology==
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox theology}}

The [[hesychasm|hesychastic]] practice of the Jesus Prayer is founded on the biblical view by which God's name is conceived as the place of his presence.&lt;ref name="raduca-2006"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Vasile Răducă, ''Ghidul creştinului ortodox de azi'' (''Guide for the contemporary Eastern Orthodox Christian''), second edition, [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas Ed.]], [[Bucharest]], 2006, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-973-50-1161-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Orthodox mysticism has no images or representations. The mystical practice (the prayer and the meditation) doesn't lead to perceiving representations of God (see below [[#Palamism, the underlying theology|Palamism]]). Thus, the most important means of a life consecrated to praying is the invoked ''name of God'', as it is emphasized since the 5th century by the [[Thebaid]] [[hermit|anchorites]], or by the later [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] [[Hesychasm|hesychasts]]. For the Orthodox the power of the Jesus Prayer comes not only from its content, but from the very invocation of Jesus name.&lt;ref name="bulgakov-orthodoxy"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Sergei Bulgakov]], ''Ortodoxia'' (''The Orthodoxy''), translation from [[French language|French]], Paideia Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1997, pp. 161, 162-163, {{ISBN|973-9131-26-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scriptural roots===
Theologically, the Jesus Prayer is considered to be the response of the Holy Tradition to the lesson taught by the parable of [[Pharisee and the Publican|the Publican and the Pharisee]], in which the Pharisee demonstrates the improper way to pray by exclaiming: "Thank you Lord that I am not like the Publican", whereas the Publican prays correctly in humility, saying "Lord have mercy on me, a sinner" ({{bibleverse||Luke|18:10-14|KJV}}).&lt;ref name="goarch-jp"&gt;Steven Peter Tsichlis, [http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7104.asp The Jesus Prayer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050207085923/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article7104.asp |date=2005-02-07 }}, [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. Retrieved March 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palamism, the underlying theology===

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
The [[essence–energies distinction]], a central principle in Orthodox theology, was first formulated by [[Gregory of Nyssa]] and developed by [[Gregory Palamas]] in the 14th century in support of the mystical practices of [[Hesychasm]] and against [[Barlaam of Seminara]]. It stands that God's ''essence'' ({{Lang-grc|Οὐσία}}, ''[[ousia]]'') is distinct from God's ''energies'', or manifestations in the world, by which men can experience the Divine. The energies are "unbegotten" or "uncreated". They were revealed in various episodes of the [[Bible]]: the [[burning bush]] seen by [[Moses]], the [[Tabor Light|Light]] on [[Mount Tabor]] at the [[Transfiguration of Jesus|Transfiguration]].

[[Apophatic theology|Apophatism]]&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Orthodox theology doesn't stand [[Thomas Aquinas]]' interpretation to the ''Mystycal theology'' of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite]] (''modo sublimiori'' and ''modo significandi'', by which Aquinas unites positive and negative theologies, transforming the negative one into a correction of the positive one). Like pseudo-Denys, the Eastern Church remarks the [[antinomy]] between the two ways of talking about God and acknowledges the superiority of apophatism. Cf. Vladimir Lossky, op. cit., p. 55, [[Dumitru Stăniloae]], op. cit., pp. 261–262.&lt;/ref&gt; (negative theology) is the main characteristic of the Eastern theological tradition. [[wikt:incognoscible|Incognoscibility]] is not conceived as [[agnosticism]] or refusal to know God, because the Eastern theology is not concerned with abstract concepts; it is contemplative, with a discourse on things above rational understanding. Therefore, dogmas are often expressed antinomically.&lt;ref name="lossky"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Vladimir Lossky]], ''Teologia mistică a Bisericii de Răsărit'' (''The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church''), translation from [[French language|French]], Anastasia Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1993, pp. 36–37, 47–48, 55, 71. {{ISBN|973-95777-3-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of contemplation, is experience of God, [[lighting|illumination]] called the Vision of God or in Greek [[theoria]].&lt;ref&gt;The Vision of God by [[Vladimir Lossky]] SVS Press, 1997. ({{ISBN|0-913836-19-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Eastern Orthodox the knowledge or {{lang|el|[[noesis]]}} of the uncreated energies is usually linked to apophatism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Dumitru Stăniloae|Fr.

===Repentance in Eastern Orthodoxy===
{{see also|Eastern Orthodox view of sin}}
The Eastern Orthodox Church holds a non-juridical view of sin, by contrast to the [[atonement (satisfaction view)|satisfaction view]] of [[Atonement in Christianity|atonement]] for sin as articulated in the [[Western Christianity|West]], firstly by [[Anselm of Canterbury]] (as debt of honor){{Request quotation|date=August 2012}}) and [[Thomas Aquinas]] (as a moral debt).{{Request quotation|date=August 2012}}  The terms used in the East are less legalistic (''grace'', ''punishment''), and more medical (''sickness'', ''healing'') with less exacting precision. Sin, therefore, does not carry with it the guilt for breaking a rule, but rather the impetus to become something more than what men usually are. One repents not because one is or isn't virtuous, but because human nature can change. Repentance ({{Lang-grc|μετάνοια}}, ''[[metanoia (theology)|metanoia]]'', "changing one's mind") isn't remorse, justification, or punishment, but a continual enactment of one's freedom, deriving from renewed choice and leading to restoration (the return to man's [[Fall of Man|original state]]).&lt;ref name="goarch-repentance"&gt;John Chryssavgis, [http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8493.asp Repentance and Confession - Introduction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317005146/http://www.goarch.org/en/ourfaith/articles/article8493.asp |date=2008-03-17 }}, [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]]. Retrieved 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in the [[Sacred Mystery|Mystery]] of [[Confession (religion)|Confession]] for which, not being limited to a mere confession of sins and presupposing recommendations or penalties, it is primarily that the priest acts in his capacity of spiritual father.&lt;ref name="raduca-2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="russ-catechism"&gt;[http://orthodoxeurope.org/page/10/1.aspx An Online Orthodox Catechism], [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Retrieved 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mystery of Confession is linked to the spiritual development of the individual, and relates to the practice of choosing an elder to trust as his or her spiritual guide, turning to him for advice on the personal spiritual development, confessing sins, and asking advice.

As stated at the local Council of Constantinople in 1157, Christ brought his redemptive sacrifice not to the [[God the Father|Father]] alone, but to the [[Trinity]] as a whole. In the Eastern Orthodox theology redemption isn't seen as ''ransom''. It is the ''reconciliation'' of God with man, the manifestation of God’s love for humanity. Thus, it is not the anger of God the Father but His love that lies behind the sacrificial death of his son on the cross.&lt;ref name="russ-catechism" /&gt;

The redemption of man is not considered to have taken place only in the past, but continues to this day through [[theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|theosis]]. The initiative belongs to God, but presupposes man's active acceptance (not an action only, but an attitude), which is a way of perpetually receiving God.&lt;ref name="goarch-repentance" /&gt;

===Distinctiveness from analogues in other religions===
The practice of contemplative or meditative chanting is known in several religions including [[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], and [[Islam]] (e.g. [[japa]], [[zikr]]). The form of internal contemplation involving profound inner transformations affecting all the levels of the self is common to the traditions that posit the ontological value of personhood.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Louchakova, ''Ontopoiesis and Union in the Jesus Prayer: Contributions to Psychotherapy and Learning'', in ''Logos pf Phenomenology and Phenomenology of Logos. Book Four&amp;nbsp;– The Logos of Scientific Interrogation. Participating in Nature-Life-Sharing in Life'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer Ed.]], 2006, p. 292, {{ISBN|1-4020-3736-8}}. [[Google Scholar]]: [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=exqlzPD9KGMC].&lt;/ref&gt; The history of these practices, including their possible spread from one religion to another, is not well understood. Such parallels (like between unusual psycho-spiritual experiences, breathing practices, postures, spiritual guidances of elders, peril warnings) might easily have arisen independently of one another, and in any case must be considered within their particular religious frameworks.

Although some aspects of the Jesus Prayer may resemble some aspects of other traditions, its Christian character is central rather than mere "local color". The aim of the Christian practicing it is not limited to attaining humility, love, or purification of sinful thoughts, but rather it is becoming holy and seeking union with God (''theosis''), which subsumes all the aforementioned virtues. Thus, for the Eastern Orthodox:&lt;ref name="panagiotis-ro"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Hristofor Panaghiotis, ''Rugăciunea lui Iisus. Unirea minţii cu inima şi a omului cu Dumnezeu'' (''Jesus prayer. Uniting the mind with the heart and man with God by Panagiotis K. Christou''), translation from [[Greek language|Greek]], second edition, Panaghia Ed., Rarău Monastery, [[Vatra Dornei]], pp. 6, 12-15, 130, {{ISBN|978-973-88218-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The Jesus Prayer is, first of all, a prayer addressed to God. It's not a means of self-deifying or self-deliverance, but a counterexample to [[Fall of Man|Adam's pride]], repairing the breach it produced between man and God.
:* The aim is not to be dissolved or absorbed into nothingness or into God, or reach another state of mind, but to (re)unite{{efn|''Unite'' if referring to one person; ''reunite'' if talking at an anthropological level.}} with God (which by itself is a process) while remaining a distinct person.
:* It is an invocation of Jesus' name, because [[Christian anthropology]] and [[soteriology]] are strongly linked to [[Christology]] in Orthodox monasticism.
:* In a modern context the continuing repetition is regarded by some as a form of [[meditation]], the prayer functioning as a kind of [[mantra]]. However, Orthodox users of the Jesus Prayer emphasize the ''invocation'' of the name of Jesus Christ that Hesychios describes in ''Pros Theodoulon'' which would be [[contemplation]] on the Triune God rather than simply emptying the mind.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}
:* Acknowledging "a sinner" is to lead firstly to a state of humbleness and repentance, recognizing one's own sinfulness.
:* Practicing the Jesus Prayer is strongly linked to mastering passions of both soul and body, e.g. by [[Eastern Orthodoxy#Fasting|fasting]]. For the Eastern Orthodox not the body is wicked, but "the bodily way of thinking" is; therefore [[salvation]] also regards the body.
:* Unlike "seed syllables" in particular traditions of chanting [[mantra]]s, the Jesus Prayer may be translated into whatever language the pray-er customarily uses. The emphasis is on the meaning, not on the mere utterance of certain sounds.
:* There is no emphasis on the psychosomatic techniques, which are merely seen as helpers for uniting the mind with the heart, not as prerequisites.

A magistral way of meeting God for the Orthodox,&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware"&gt;{{Ro icon}} ''Puterea Numelui sau despre Rugăciunea lui Iisus'' (''The Power of the Name. The Jesus Prayer in Orthodox Spirituality'') in [[Kallistos Ware]], ''Rugăciune şi tăcere în spiritualitatea ortodoxă'' (''Prayer and silence in the Orthodox spirituality''), translation from [[English language|English]], Christiana Ed., [[Bucharest]], 2003, p. 23, 26, {{ISBN|973-8125-42-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Jesus Prayer does not harbor any secrets in itself, nor does its practice reveal any esoteric truths.&lt;ref name="ioan-rarau"&gt;{{Ro icon}} Fr. Ioan de la Rarău, ''Rugăciunea lui Iisus. Întrebări şi răspunsuri'' (''Jesus Prayer. Questions and answers''), Panaghia Ed., Rarău Monastery, [[Vatra Dornei]], p. 97. {{ISBN|978-973-88218-6-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, as a [[hesychasm|hesychastic]] practice, it demands setting the mind apart from rational activities and ignoring the physical senses for the experiential knowledge of God. It stands along with the regular expected actions of the believer (prayer, almsgiving, repentance, fasting etc.) as the response of the Orthodox Tradition to [[Paul the Apostle]]'s challenge to "pray without ceasing" ({{bibleverse|1|Thess|5:17}}).&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="panagiotis-ro" /&gt; It is also linked to the [[Song of Solomon]]'s passage from the [[Old Testament]]: "I sleep, but my heart is awake" (Song of Solomon 5:2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=song%20of%20songs%205:2;&amp;version=50; |title=Song of songs 5:2;&amp;nbsp;– Passage Lookup&amp;nbsp;— New King James Version |publisher=BibleGateway.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analogy being that as a lover is always conscious to his or her beloved, people can also achieve a state of "constant prayer" where they are always conscious of God's presence in their lives.

==Practice==
The practice of the Jesus Prayer is integrated into the mental [[asceticism|ascesis]] undertaken by the Orthodox [[monasticism|monastic]] in the practice of [[hesychasm]]. Yet the Jesus Prayer is not limited only to monastic life or to clergy. Anyone may practice this prayer, laypeople and clergy, men, women and children.

[[Image:Eastern-Orthodox-prayer-rope 2006-06-02.jpg|thumb|left|Eastern Orthodox [[prayer rope]]]]
[[Image:Rublev's saviour.jpg|thumb|left|[[Christ the Redeemer (icon)|Christ the Redeemer]] by [[Andrei Rublev]] ({{circa|1410}}, [[Tretyakov Gallery]], [[Moscow]])]]
In the Eastern tradition the prayer is said or prayed repeatedly, often with the aid of a [[prayer rope]] ({{lang-ru|chotki}}; {{lang-el|komvoskini}}), which is a cord, usually woolen, tied with many knots. The person saying the prayer says one repetition for each knot. It may be accompanied by [[poklon|prostrations]] and the [[sign of the cross]], signaled by beads strung along the prayer rope at intervals.
The prayer rope is "a tool of prayer" and an aid to beginners or those who face difficulties practicing the Prayer.

The Jesus Prayer may be practiced under the guidance and supervision of a spiritual guide (pneumatikos, {{lang|el|πνευματικός}}), and or [[Starets]], especially when psychosomatic techniques (like rhythmical breath) are incorporated. A person that acts as a spiritual "father" and advisor may be an official certified by the Church [[Confessor]] (Pneumatikos Exolmologitis) or sometimes a spiritually experienced monk (called in [[Greek language|Greek]] Gerontas ([[Elder (Christianity)|Elder]]) or in Russian [[Starets]]). It is possible for that person to be a layperson, usually a "practical theologician" (i.e. a person well versed in Orthodox theology but without official credentials, certificates, diplomas etc.).

===Techniques===
There are no fixed rules for those who pray, "the way there is no mechanical, physical or mental technique which can force God to show his presence" ([[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Kallistos Ware]]).&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware" /&gt;

In ''[[The Way of a Pilgrim]]'', the pilgrim advises, "as you draw your breath in, say, or imagine yourself saying, 'Lord Jesus Christ,' and as you breathe again, 'have mercy on me.'"&lt;ref name="wayofpilgrim"&gt;{{cite book |last=French |first1=R. M. |url=http://desertfathers.webs.com/thewayofthepilgrim.htm |title=The Way of a Pilgrim |editor-last=French |editor-first=R. M. |publisher= Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge |year=1930 |accessdate=2016-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another option is to say (orally or mentally) the whole prayer while breathing in and again the whole prayer while breathing out and yet another, to breathe in recite the whole prayer, breathe out while reciting the whole prayer again. One can also hold the breath for a few seconds between breathing in and out.

Monks may pray this prayer many hundreds of times each night as part of their private cell vigil ("cell rule"). Under the guidance of an Elder (Russian ''[[Starets]]''; Greek ''Gerondas''), the monk aims to internalize the prayer, so that he is praying unceasingly. Diadochos of Photiki refers in ''On Spiritual Knowledge and Discrimination'' to the automatic repetition of the Jesus Prayer, under the influence of the [[Holy Spirit]], even in sleep. This state is regarded as the accomplishment of Paul the Apostle's exhortation to the Thessalonians to "pray without ceasing" ({{bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|5:17|KJV}}).

The Jesus Prayer can be used for a kind of "psychological" self-analysis. According to the ''Way of the Pilgrim'' account and Mount Athos practitioners of the Jesus Prayer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailygreece.com/2008/03/post_246.php |title=greek news: Οι τρόποι της ευχής |publisher=Dailygreece.com |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; "one can have some insight on his or her current psychological situation by observing the intonation of the words of the prayer, as they are recited. Which word is stressed most. This self-analysis could reveal to the praying person things about their inner state and feelings, maybe not yet realised, of their unconsciousness."&lt;ref name="byethost1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prayercraft.byethost8.com/JesusPrayer.htm |title=On the Jesus Prayer |publisher=Prayercraft.byethost8.com |date=2004-11-27 |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"While praying the Jesus Prayer, one might notice that sometimes the word 'Lord' is pronounced louder, more stressed, than the others, like: ''Lord'' Jesus Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In this case, they say, it means that our inner self is currently more aware of the fact that Jesus is the Lord, maybe because we need reassurance that he is in control of everything (and our lives too). Other times, the stressed word is 'Jesus': Lord ''Jesus'' Christ, (Son of God), have mercy on me, (a/the sinner). In that case, they say, we feel the need to personally appeal more to his human nature, the one that is more likely to understands our human problems and shortcomings, maybe because we are going through tough personal situations. Likewise if the word 'Christ' is stressed it could be that we need to appeal to Jesus as Messiah and Mediator, between humans and God the Father, and so on. When the word 'Son' is stressed maybe we recognise more Jesus' relationship with the Father. If 'of God' is stressed then we could realise more Jesus' unity with the Father. A stressed 'have mercy on me' shows a specific, or urgent, need for mercy. A stressed 'a sinner' (or 'the sinner') could mean that there is a particular current realisation of the sinful human nature or a particular need for forgiveness.

"In order to do this kind of self-analysis one should better start reciting the prayer relaxed and naturally for a few minutes{{spaced ndash}} so the observation won't be consciously 'forced', and then to start paying attention to the intonation as described above.

Also, a person might want to consciously stress one of the words of the prayer in particular when one wants to express a conscious feeling of situation. So in times of need stressing the 'have mercy' part can be more comforting or more appropriate. In times of failures, the 'a sinner' part, etc....)."&lt;ref name="byethost1"/&gt;

===Levels of the prayer===
[[Image:StJohnClimacus.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Icon of ''[[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]]'' (the steps toward theosis as described by [[John Climacus]]) showing monks ascending (and falling from) the ladder to Jesus]]
[[Paul Nicolaevich Evdokimov|Paul Evdokimov]], a 20th-century [[Russia]]n philosopher and theologian, writes&lt;ref name="evdokimov-prayer"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [[Paul Evdokimov]], ''Rugăciunea în Biserica de Răsărit'' (''Prayer in the Church of the East''), translation from [[French language|French]], Polirom Ed., [[Bucharest]], 1996, pp. 29-31, {{ISBN|973-9248-15-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; about beginner's way of praying: initially, the prayer is excited because the man is emotive and a flow of psychic contents is expressed. In his view this condition comes, for the modern men, from the separation of the mind from the heart: "The prattle spreads the soul, while the silence is drawing it together." Old fathers condemned elaborate phraseologies, for one word was enough for the publican, and one word saved the thief on the cross. They only uttered Jesus' name by which they were contemplating God. For Evdokimov the acting faith denies any formalism which quickly installs in the external prayer or in the life duties; he quotes [[Seraphim of Sarov]]: "The prayer is not thorough if the man is self-conscious and he is aware he's praying."

"Because the prayer is a living reality, a deeply personal encounter with the living God, it is not to be confined to any given classification or rigid analysis"&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt; an on-line catechism reads. As general guidelines for the practitioner, different number of levels (3, 7 or 9) in the practice of the prayer are distinguished by Orthodox fathers. They are to be seen as being purely informative, because the practice of the Prayer of the Heart is learned under personal spiritual guidance in Eastern Orthodoxy which emphasizes the perils of temptations when it's done by one's own. Thus, [[Theophan the Recluse]], a 19th-century [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian]] spiritual writer, talks about three stages:&lt;ref name="goarch-jp" /&gt;
# The oral prayer (the prayer of the lips) is a simple recitation, still external to the practitioner.
# The focused prayer, when "the mind is focused upon the words" of the prayer, "speaking them as if they were our own."
# The prayer of the heart itself, when the prayer is no longer something we do but who we are.
Once this is achieved the Jesus Prayer is said to become "self-active" ({{lang|el|αυτενεργούμενη}}). It is repeated automatically and unconsciously by the mind, becoming an internal habit like a (beneficial) [[Earworm]]. Body, through the uttering of the prayer, mind, through the mental repetition of the prayer, are thus unified with "the heart" (spirit) and the prayer becomes constant, ceaselessly "playing" in the background of the mind, like a background music, without hindering the normal everyday activities of the person.&lt;ref name="byethost1"/&gt;

Others, like Father [[Archimandrite]] Ilie Cleopa, one of the most representative spiritual fathers of contemporary [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] monastic spirituality,&lt;ref name="cleopa-dict"&gt;{{Ro icon}} [http://biserica.org/WhosWho/DTR/I/IlieCleopa.html Ilie Cleopa] in ''Dicţionarul teologilor români'' (''Dictionary of Romanian Theologians''), electronic version, Univers Enciclopedic Ed., Bucharest, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; talk about nine levels (see [[#External links|External links]]). They are the same path to [[Theosis (Eastern Orthodox theology)|theosis]], more slenderly differentiated:
# The prayer of the lips.
# The prayer of the mouth.
# The prayer of the tongue.
# The prayer of the voice.
# The prayer of the mind.
# The prayer of the heart.
# The active prayer.
# The all-seeing prayer.
# The contemplative prayer.

In its more advanced use, the monk aims to attain to a sober practice of the Jesus Prayer in the heart free of images. It is from this condition, called by [[John Climacus]] and Hesychios the "guard of the mind", that the monk is raised by the [[divine grace]] to contemplation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

==Variants of repetitive formulas==
A number of different repetitive prayer formulas have been attested in the history of Eastern Orthodox monasticism: the Prayer of St. Ioannikios the Great (754–846): "My hope is the Father, my refuge is the Son, my shelter is the Holy Ghost, O Holy Trinity, Glory unto You," the repetitive use of which is described in his ''Life''; or the more recent practice of [[Nikolaj Velimirović]].

Similarly to the flexibility of the practice of the Jesus Prayer, there is no imposed standardization of its form. The prayer can be from as short as "Lord, have mercy" ([[Kyrie eleison]]), "Have mercy on me" ("Have mercy upon us"), or even "Jesus", to its longer most common form. It can also contain a call to the [[Theotokos]] (Virgin Mary), or to the saints. The single essential and invariable element is Jesus' name.&lt;ref name="kallistos-ware" /&gt;

:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner. (a very common form) (Sometimes "{{lang|el|τον αμαρτωλόν}}" is translated "a sinner" but in Greek the article "{{lang|el|τον}}" is a definite article, so it could be translated "the sinner".)
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me.&lt;ref name="OrthodoxWiki"/&gt; (a very common form in the Greek tradition)
:* Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on me. (common variant on [[Mount Athos]])[http://www.pelagia.org/htm/b01.en.a_night_in_the_desert_of_the_holy_mountain.05.htm]
:* Jesus, have mercy.&lt;ref&gt;"The Gurus, the Young Man, and Elder Paisios" by Dionysios Farasiotis&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saintjonah.org/services/stpachomius.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, have mercy on me, a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Prayer_Trinity.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art==
The Jesus Prayer is a core part of the plot in [[J.&amp;nbsp;D. Salinger]]'s pair of stories ''[[Franny and Zooey]]''. Its use in that book is itself referenced in [[Jeffrey Eugenides]]'s novel, [[The Marriage Plot]].
The prayer is also a central theme of the 2006 Russian film ''[[Ostrov (film)|Ostrov]]''.

==Catholic Church==
Part four of the [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]], which is dedicated to Christian prayer, devotes paragraphs 2665 to 2669 to prayer to Jesus.

{{quote|To pray "Jesus" is to invoke him and to call him within us. His name is the only one that contains the presence it signifies. Jesus is the Risen One, and whoever invokes the name of Jesus is welcoming the Son of God who loved him and who gave himself up for him. This simple invocation of faith developed in the tradition of prayer under many forms in East and West. The most usual formulation, transmitted by the spiritual writers of the Sinai, Syria, and Mt. Athos, is the invocation, "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us sinners." It combines the Christological hymn of {{bibleverse||Philippians|2:6-11|ESV}} with the cry of the publican and the blind men begging for light. By it the heart is opened to human wretchedness and the Savior's mercy. The invocation of the holy name of Jesus is the simplest way of praying always. When the holy name is repeated often by a humbly attentive heart, the prayer is not lost by heaping up empty phrases, but holds fast to the word and "brings forth fruit with patience." This prayer is possible "at all times" because it is not one occupation among others but the only occupation: that of loving God, which animates and transfigures every action in Christ Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P9F.HTM |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church, 2666-2668 |publisher=Catholic Church |date= |accessdate=2010-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In his poem ''The Book of the Twelve Béguines'', [[John of Ruysbroeck]], a 14th-century [[Flanders|Flemish]] [[mysticism|mystic]] [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope Pius X]] in 1908, wrote of "the uncreated Light, which is not God, but is the intermediary between Him and the 'seeing thought'" as illuminating the contemplative not in the highest mode of contemplation, but in the second of the four ascending modes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bookoftwelvebg00janvuoft#page/40/mode/2up John Francis's translation of Jan van Ruysbroeck, ''The Book of the Twelve Béguines'' (John M. Watkins 1913), p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar methods of prayer in use in the Catholic Church are recitation, as recommended by [[John Cassian]], of "O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me" or other verses of Scripture; repetition of a single monosyllabic word, as suggested by the [[Cloud of Unknowing]]; the method used in [[Centering Prayer]]; the method used by [[World Community for Christian Meditation|The World Community for Christian Meditation]], based on the Aramaic invocation ''[[Maranatha]]''; the use of [[Lectio Divina]]; etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=332 Thomas Keating, ''Centering Prayer and the Christian Contemplative Tradition'' (Monastic Interreligious Dialogue, Bulletin 40, January 1991)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310163401/http://www.monasticdialog.com/a.php?id=332 |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] says:
{{quote|The name of Jesus is at the heart of Christian prayer. All liturgical prayers conclude with the words "through our Lord Jesus Christ". The [[Hail Mary]] reaches its high point in the words "blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus". The Eastern prayer of the heart, the Jesus Prayer, says: "Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner." Many Christians, such as [[Joan of Arc]], have died with the one word "Jesus" on their lips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P1E.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church, 435]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Use by other Christians==
In addition to Roman Catholics and Eastern Orthodox, many Christians of other traditions also use the Jesus Prayer, primarily as a centering prayer or for contemplative prayer. The prayer is sometimes used with the [[Anglican rosary]]. The structure and content of the Jesus Prayer also bears a resemblance to the "[[Sinner's Prayer]]" used by many [[evangelical Protestant]]s.

'''Karakalpak''' is a [[Turkic language]] spoken by [[Karakalpaks]] in [[Karakalpakstan]]. It is divided into two dialects,  Northeastern Karakalpak and Southeastern Karakalpak. It developed alongside neighboring [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] and [[Uzbek language]]s, being markedly influenced by both. Typologically, Karakalpak belongs to the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] branch of the Turkic languages, thus being closely related to and partially mutually intelligible to Kazakh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/language/kaa|title=Karakalpak|website=Ethnologue|access-date=2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Karakalpak is a member of the [[Kipchak languages|Kipchak]] branch of [[Turkic languages]], which includes [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Kumyk language|Kumyk]], [[Nogai language|Nogai]], and [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]]. Due to its proximity to [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], much of Karakalpak's vocabulary and grammar has been influenced by Uzbek. Like [[Turkish language|Turkish]], Karakalpak has [[vowel harmony]], is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] and has no [[grammatical gender]]. Word order is usually [[subject–object–verb]].

==Geographic distribution==
Karakalpak is spoken mainly in the [[Karakalpakstan]] Autonomous Republic of [[Uzbekistan]]. Approximately 2,000 people in [[Afghanistan]] and smaller diaspora in parts of [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Turkey]], and other parts of the world speak Karakalpak.

===Official status===
Karakalpak has official status in the Karakalpakstan Autonomous Republic.

===Dialects===
The [[Ethnologue]] identifies two dialects of Karakalpak: Northeastern and Southwestern.  [[Karl Heinrich Menges|Menges]] mentions a third possible dialect spoken in the [[Fergana Valley]].  The Southwestern dialect has /tʃ/ for the Northeastern /ʃ/.

==Phonology==
Karakalpak has 21 native consonant phonemes and regularly uses four non-native phonemes in loan words.  Non-native sounds are shown in parentheses.

[[File:Bashkir arabic alphabet.jpg|thumb|500 px|Bashkir Arabic script]]
[[Image:Suwretxana.JPG|thumb|300 px|March 2006. A photo laboratory in [[Nukus]] – with the signboard written in Karakalpak language using Latin alphabet]]

Karakalpak was written in the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Persian script|Persian]] script until 1928, in the [[Latin script]] (with additional characters) from 1928 to 1940, after which [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] was introduced.  Following Uzbekistan's independence in 1991, the decision was made to drop Cyrillic and revert to the Latin alphabet.  Whilst the use of Latin script is now widespread in [[Tashkent]], its introduction into Karakalpakstan remains gradual.  The Cyrillic and Latin alphabets are shown below with their equivalent representations in the IPA.  Cyrillic letters with no representation in the Latin alphabet are marked with asterisks. The last changes to the new Karakalpak alphabet were made in 2016: instead of letters with apostrophes, letters with acutes were introduced.&lt;ref name="лотин"&gt;{{cite web|title=Латын жазыўына тийкарланған қарақалпақ әлипбеси|url=http://www.karsu.uz/index.php/kk/9-uncategorised/904-latyn-zhazy|work=Каракалпакский  государственный университет им.

[[Kraol language|Kraol]], [[Thmon language|Thmon]], Khaonh, and [[Mel language|Mel]] all have about 70% lexical similarity with [[Stieng language|Stieng]], a Southern Bahnaric language (Barr &amp; Pawley 2013:32).

Khaonh is spoken in the following villages of [[Kratié Province]], Cambodia (Barr &amp; Pawley 2013).
*Chhok, Thmei commune, [[Kratié District]]
*Khnach, Thmei commune, [[Kratié District]]

In [[mathematics]], a '''Kleene algebra''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|l|eɪ|n|i}} {{respell|KLAY|nee}}; named after [[Stephen Cole Kleene]]) is an idempotent (and thus partially ordered) [[semiring]] endowed with a [[closure operator]].&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pouly|author2=Jürg Kohlas|title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; It generalizes the operations known from [[regular expression]]s.

== Definition ==

Various inequivalent definitions of Kleene algebras and related structures have been given in the literature.&lt;ref&gt;For a survey, see: {{cite book | zbl=0732.03047 | last=Kozen | first=Dexter | chapter=On Kleene algebras and closed semirings | title=Mathematical foundations of computer science, Proc. 15th Symp., MFCS '90, Banská Bystrica/Czech. 1990 | series=Lecture Notes Computer Science | volume=452 | pages=26–47 | year=1990 | authorlink=Dexter Kozen | editor1-last=Rovan | editor1-first=Branislav | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/6971/1/90-1131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we will give the definition that seems to be the most common nowadays.

A Kleene algebra is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''A'' together with two [[binary operation]]s + : ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'' and · : ''A'' &amp;times; ''A'' → ''A'' and one function &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; : ''A'' → ''A'', written as ''a'' + ''b'', ''ab'' and ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; respectively, so that the following axioms are satisfied.
* [[Associativity]] of + and ·: ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') = (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' and ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c'' for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''A''.
* [[Commutativity]] of +: ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' for all ''a'', ''b'' in ''A''
* [[Distributivity]]: ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = (''ab'') + (''ac'') and (''b'' + ''c'')''a'' = (''ba'') + (''ca'') for all ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' in ''A''
* [[Identity element]]s for + and ·: There exists an element 0 in ''A'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A'': ''a'' + 0 = 0 + ''a'' = ''a''. There exists an element 1 in ''A'' such that for all ''a'' in ''A'': ''a''1 = 1''a'' = ''a''.
* [[absorbing element|Annihilation]] by 0: ''a''0 = 0''a'' = 0 for all ''a'' in ''A''.
The above axioms define a [[semiring]]. We further require:
* + is [[idempotent]]: ''a'' + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.
It is now possible to define a [[partial order]] ≤ on ''A'' by setting ''a'' ≤ ''b'' [[if and only if]] ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' (or equivalently: ''a'' ≤ ''b'' if and only if there exists an ''x'' in ''A'' such that ''a'' + ''x'' = ''b''; with any definition, ''a'' ≤ ''b'' ≤ ''a'' implies ''a'' = ''b''). With this order we can formulate the last four axioms about the operation &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;:
* 1 + ''a''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  for all ''a'' in ''A''.
* 1 + (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'' ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;  for all ''a'' in ''A''.
* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''ax'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;''x'' ≤ ''x''
* if ''a'' and ''x'' are in ''A'' such that ''xa'' ≤ ''x'', then ''x''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) ≤ ''x'' &lt;ref&gt;Kozen (1990), sect.2.1, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuitively, one should think of ''a'' + ''b'' as the "union" or the "least upper bound" of ''a'' and ''b'' and of ''ab'' as some multiplication which is [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in order theory|monotonic]], in the sense that ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''ax'' ≤ ''bx''. The idea behind the star operator is ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + ''a'' + ''aa'' + ''aaa'' + ... From the standpoint of [[programming language theory]], one may also interpret + as "choice", · as "sequencing" and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; as "iteration".

|-
! [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|Regular expressions]] 
| | | || not written  || &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; || ∅  || ε
|}
Let Σ be a finite set (an "alphabet") and let ''A'' be the set of all [[Regular expression#Formal language theory|regular expression]]s over Σ. We consider two such regular expressions equal if they describe the same [[formal language|language]]. Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra. In fact, this is a [[free object|free]] Kleene algebra in the sense that any equation among regular expressions follows from the Kleene algebra axioms and is therefore valid in every Kleene algebra.

Again let Σ be an alphabet. Let ''A'' be the set of all [[regular language]]s over Σ (or the set of all [[context-free language]]s over Σ; or the set of all [[recursive language]]s over Σ; or the set of ''all'' languages over Σ). Then the [[union (set theory)|union]] (written as +) and the [[concatenation#Concatenation of sets of strings|concatenation]] (written as ·) of two elements of ''A'' again belong to ''A'', and so does the [[Kleene star]] operation applied to any element of ''A''. We obtain a Kleene algebra ''A'' with 0 being the [[empty set]] and 1 being the set that only contains the [[empty string]].

Let ''M'' be a [[monoid]] with identity element ''e'' and let ''A'' be the set of all [[subset]]s of ''M''. For two such subsets ''S'' and ''T'', let ''S'' + ''T'' be the union of ''S'' and ''T'' and set ''ST'' = {''st'' : ''s'' in ''S'' and ''t'' in ''T''}. ''S''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as the submonoid of ''M'' generated by ''S'', which can be described as {''e''} ∪ ''S'' ∪ ''SS'' ∪ ''SSS'' ∪ ... Then ''A'' forms a Kleene algebra with 0 being the empty set and 1 being {''e''}. An analogous construction can be performed for any small [[category theory|category]].

The [[linear subspace]]s of a unital [[algebra over a field]] form a Kleene algebra.  Given linear subspaces ''V'' and ''W'', define ''V'' + ''W'' to be the sum of the two subspaces, and 0 to be the trivial subspace {0}.  Define ''V'' · ''W'' = span {v · w | v ∈ V, w ∈ W}, the [[linear span]] of the product of vectors from ''V'' and ''W'' respectively.  Define 1 = span {I}, the span of the unit of the algebra.  The closure of ''V'' is the [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]] of all powers of ''V''.

:&lt;math&gt;V^{*} = \bigoplus_{i = 0}^{\infty} V^{i}&lt;/math&gt;

Suppose ''M'' is a set and ''A'' is the set of all [[binary relation]]s on ''M''. Taking + to be the union, · to be the composition and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; to be the [[reflexive transitive closure]], we obtain a Kleene algebra.

Every [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]] with operations &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; turns into a Kleene algebra if we use &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; for +, &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; for · and set ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 for all ''a''.

A quite different Kleene algebra can be used to implement the [[Floyd–Warshall algorithm]], computing the [[shortest path problem|shortest path's length]] for every two vertices  of a [[graph theory|weighted directed graph]], by [[Kleene's algorithm]], computing a regular expression for every two states of a [[deterministic finite automaton]].
Using the [[extended real number line]], take ''a'' + ''b'' to be the minimum of ''a'' and ''b'' and ''ab'' to be the ordinary sum of ''a'' and ''b'' (with the sum of +∞ and −∞ being defined as +∞). ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is defined to be the real number zero for nonnegative ''a'' and −∞ for negative ''a''. This is a Kleene algebra with zero element +∞ and one element the real number zero. 
A weighted directed graph can then be considered as a deterministic finite automaton, with each transition labelled by its weight.
For any two graph nodes (automaton states), the regular expressions computed from Kleene's algorithm evaluates, in this particular Kleene algebra, to the shortest path length between the nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Handbook of Graph Theory|series=Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications|first1=Jonathan L.|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|publisher=CRC Press|year=2003|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mKkIGIea_BkC&amp;pg=PA65|isbn=9780203490204}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties ==

Zero is the smallest element: 0 ≤ ''a'' for all ''a'' in ''A''.

The sum ''a'' + ''b'' is the [[least upper bound]] of ''a'' and ''b'': we have ''a'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and ''b'' ≤ ''a'' + ''b'' and if ''x'' is an element of ''A'' with ''a'' ≤ ''x'' and ''b'' ≤ ''x'', then ''a'' + ''b'' ≤ ''x''. Similarly, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the least upper bound of the elements ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Multiplication and addition are monotonic: if ''a'' ≤ ''b'', then 
* ''a'' + ''x'' ≤ ''b'' + ''x'', 
* ''ax'' ≤ ''bx'', and 
* ''xa'' ≤ ''xb'' 
for all ''x'' in ''A''.

Regarding the star operation, we have 
* 0&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 and 1&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, 
* ''a'' ≤ ''b'' implies ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; (monotonicity),
* ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; ≤ ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; for every natural number ''n'', where ''a''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is defined as ''n''-fold multiplication of ''a'',
* (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;,
* (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, 
* 1 + ''a''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;) = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 + (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'', 
* ''ax'' = ''xb'' implies (''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''x'' = ''x''(''b''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;),
* ((''ab'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''a'' = ''a''((''ba'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;),
* (''a''+''b'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; = ''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;(''b''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;, and
* ''pq'' = 1 = ''qp'' implies ''q''(''a''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)''p'' = (''qap'')&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Kozen (1990), sect.2.1.2, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

If ''A'' is a Kleene algebra and ''n'' is a natural number, then one can consider the set M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') consisting of all ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] with entries in ''A''.
Using the ordinary notions of matrix addition and multiplication, one can define a unique &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-operation so that M&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') becomes a Kleene algebra.

== History ==

Kleene introduced regular expressions and gave some of their algebraic laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite techreport| author=S.C. Kleene| title=Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata|date=Dec 1951| number=RM-704| pages=98| institution=U.S. Air Force / RAND Corporation| url=http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_memoranda/2008/RM704.pdf}} Here: sect.7.2, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Kleene, Stephen C.| title=Representation of Events in Nerve Nets and Finite Automata| journal=Automata Studies, Annals of Mathematical Studies| year=1956| volume=34| publisher=Princeton Univ. Press| url=http://www.dlsi.ua.es/~mlf/nnafmc/papers/kleene56representation.pdf}} Here: sect.7.2, p.26-27&lt;/ref&gt;
Although he didn't define Kleene algebras, he asked for a decision procedure for equivalence of regular expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Kleene (1956), p.35&lt;/ref&gt;
Redko proved that no finite set of ''equational'' axioms can characterize the algebra of regular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=V.N. Redko| url=http://umj.imath.kiev.ua/archiv/1964/01/umj_1964_01_10002_20139.pdf | title=On defining relations for the algebra of regular events| journal={{ill|Ukrainskii Matematicheskii Zhurnal|uk|Український математичний журнал}} | year=1964| volume=16| number=1 | pages=120–126}} (In Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;
Salomaa gave complete axiomatizations of this algebra, however depending on problematic inference rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=[[Arto Salomaa]]| title=Two complete axiom systems for the algebra of regular events| journal=J. Assoc. Comput. Mach|date=Jan 1966| volume=13| number=1| pages=158–169| url=http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/ansatte/henglein/papers/salomaa1966.pdf| doi=10.1145/321312.321326}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The problem of providing a complete set of axioms, which would allow derivation of all equations among regular expressions, was intensively studied by [[John Horton Conway]] under the name of ''regular algebras'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=J.H. | last=Conway | authorlink=John Horton Conway | title=Regular algebra and finite machines | publisher=Chapman and Hall | year=1971 | isbn=0-412-10620-5 | zbl=0231.94041 | location=London }}  Chap.IV.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the bulk of his treatment was infinitary.
In 1981, [[Dexter Kozen|Kozen]] gave a complete infinitary equational deductive system for the algebra of regular languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Dexter Kozen| chapter=On induction vs. &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;-continuity| title=Proc.

Sci.| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/indvsstarcont.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1994, he gave the [[#Definition|above]] finite axiom system, which uses unconditional and conditional equalities,&lt;ref&gt;considering ''a''≤''b'' as an abbreviation for ''a''+''b''=''b''&lt;/ref&gt; and is equationally complete for the algebra of regular languages, that is, two regular expressions ''a'' and ''b'' denote the same language only if ''a''=''b'' follows from the [[#Definition|above]] axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Dexter Kozen| title=A Completeness Theorem for Kleene Algebras and the Algebra of Regular Events| journal=Information and Computation|date=May 1994| volume=110| number=2| pages=366–390| url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/~kozen/papers/ka.pdf| doi=10.1006/inco.1994.1037}} &amp;mdash; An earlier version appeared as: {{cite techreport| author=Dexter Kozen| title=A Completeness Theorem for Kleene Algebras and the Algebra of Regular Events|date=May 1990| number=TR90-1123| pages=27| institution=Cornell| url=http://ecommons.library.cornell.edu/handle/1813/6963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Generalization (or relation to other structures) ==
Kleene algebras are a particular case of [[closed semiring]]s, also called [[quasi-regular semiring]]s or [[Lehmann semiring]]s, which are semirings in which every element has at least one quasi-inverse satisfying the equation: a* = aa* + 1 = a*a + 1. This quasi-inverse is not necessarily unique.&lt;ref name="Golan2003"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jonathan S. Golan|title=Semirings and Affine Equations over Them|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jw4Hmgz5ETQC&amp;pg=PA157|date=30 June 2003|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-1-4020-1358-4|pages=157–159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"/&gt; In a Kleene algebra, a* is the least solution to the [[fixpoint]] equations: X = aX + 1 and X = Xa + 1.&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"/&gt;

Closed semirings and Kleene algebras appear in [[algebraic path problem]]s, a generalization of the [[shortest path]] problem.&lt;ref name="PoulyKohlas2012b"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marc Pouly|author2=Jürg Kohlas|title=Generic Inference: A Unifying Theory for Automated Reasoning|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-01086-0|pages=232 and 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lualhati Torres Bautista''' (born December 2, 1945) is one of the foremost Filipino female [[novelist]]s in the history of contemporary [[Philippine literature]]. Her novels include ''[[Dekada '70 (novel)|Dekada '70]]'', ''[[Bata, Bata, Pa'no Ka Ginawa?]]'', and ''[[‘GAPÔ]]''.

==Biography==
Bautista was born in Tondo, [[Manila]], Philippines on December 2, 1945, to Esteban Bautista and Gloria Torres. She graduated from Emilio Jacinto Elementary School in 1958, and from Torres High School in 1962. She was a journalism student at the [[Lyceum of the Philippines]], but dropped out because she had always wanted to be a writer and schoolwork was taking too much time.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} Her first short story, "Katugon ng Damdamin,"&lt;ref&gt;''Liwayway Magazine'', November 17, 1963 issue&lt;/ref&gt; was published in Liwayway Magazine and thus started her writing career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ong|first1=ed. by Aihwa|last2=Peletz|first2=Michael G.|title=Bewitching women, pious men : gender and body politics in Southeast Asia|date=1995|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=0520088611|pages=217|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fdE_M46KtjYC&amp;pg=PA217|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a lack of formal training, Bautista as a writer became known for her honest realism, courageous exploration of Philippine women's issues, and compelling female protagonists who confront difficult situations at home and in the workplace with uncommon grit and strength.

==Works as novelist==
Bautista garnered several [[Palanca Awards]] (1980, 1983 and 1984) for her novels ''[[‘GAPÔ]]'', ''[[Dekada '70 (novel)|Dekada '70]]'' and ''[[Bata, Bata… Pa’no Ka Ginawa?]]'', which exposed injustices and chronicled women's activism during the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] era.

''‘GAPÔ'', the Palanca Awards 1980 grand prize winner, published in 1992, is the story of a man coming to grips with life as an [[Amerasian]]. It is a multi-layered scrutiny of the politics behind US bases in the [[Philippines]], seen from the point of view of ordinary citizens living in [[Olongapo City]].

''Dekada '70'' is the story of a family caught in the middle of the tumultuous decade of the 1970s. It details how a middle-class family struggled and faced the changes that empowered Filipinos to rise against the Marcos government. These events happened after the [[Plaza Miranda bombing|bombing of Plaza Miranda]], the suspension of the [[writ of habeas corpus]], the proclamation of martial law and the random arrests of political prisoners. The oppressive nature of the Marcos regime, which made the people become more radical, and the shaping of the decade were all witnessed by the female protagonist, Amanda Bartolome, the mother of five boys.

''Bata, Bata… Pa'no Ka Ginawa?'', literally, "Child, Child… How Were You Made?", narrates the life of Lea, a working mother and a social activist, who has two children. In the end, all three, and especially Lea, have to confront Philippine society’s view of single motherhood. The novel deals with the questions of how it is to be a mother, and how a mother executes this role through modern-day concepts of parenthood.

Bautista's 2013 book ''In Sisterhood'' received the Filipino Readers' Choice Award Nominee for Fiction in Filipino/Taglish in 2014, organized by the Filipino Book Bloggers Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/award/show/11235-filipino-readers-choice-award Filipino Readers' Choice Award Winners], date retrieved: 5 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Bautista launched the book ''Sixty in the City'', about the life of friends Guia, Roda and Menang, who are in their mid-60s and realize that there's a good life in being just a wife, mother and homemaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27837872-sixty-in-the-city Sixty in the City, Lualhati Bautista], date retrieved: 4 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short stories==

Two of Bautista's short stories won the [[Palanca Awards]], namely "Tatlong Kwento ng Buhay ni Juan Candelabra"  (Three Stories in the Life of Juan Candelabra), first prize, 1982; and "Buwan, Buwan, Hulugan mo Ako ng Sundang" (Moon, Moon, Drop Me a dagger), third prize, 1983.

In 1991 Bautista with Cacho Publishing House, published a compilation of short stories entitled ''Buwan, Buwan, Hulugan Mo Ako ng Sundang: Dalawang Dekada ng Maiikling Kuwento''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buwan, Buwan, Hulugan Mo Ako ng Sundang|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5761514-buwan-buwan-hulugan-mo-ako-ng-sundang|website=Goodreads|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As screenwriter==

Bautista's venture as a screenwriter produced several critically acclaimed works. Her first screenplay was ''Sakada'' (Seasonal Sugarcane Workers), 1976, which exposed the plight of Filipino peasants. Her second film was ''Kung Mahawi Man ang Ulap'' in 1984, which was nominated for awards in the [[Film Academy of the Philippines]]. Also written during the same year was ''Bulaklak ng City Jail'', based on her novel about imprisoned women, which won almost all awards for that year from various awards guilds including [[Star Awards]] and [[Metro Manila Film Festival]]. In 1998 her work was used for Chito Rono's film adaptation of ''Bata Bata Paano Ka Ginawa'', starring Vilma Santos. In 2000 she wrote ''Gusto Ko Nang Lumigaya'', the screenplay for Maryo J Delos Reyes' political drama thriller.

==Other honors==
Bautista became a national fellow for fiction of the [[University of the Philippines]] Creative Writing Center in 1986. She also served as vice-president of the Screenwriters Guild of the Philippines and as chair of the Kapisanan ng mga Manunulat ng Nobelang Popular.

She was the only Filipino included in a book on foremost international women writers published in Japan in 1991.

Bautista was honored by the Ateneo Library of Women's Writings on March 10, 2004 during the 8th Annual Lecture on Vernacular Literature by Women. In 2005, the Feminist Centennial Film Festival presented her with a recognition award for her outstanding achievement in screenplay writing. In 2006, she was given the Diwata Award for best writer by the 16th International Women's Film Festival of the UP Film Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rizal.lib.admu.edu.ph/aliww/splprg_bautista.html Lualhati Bautista, Ateneo Library of Women's Writings], date retrieved: 27 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Web&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/bimbifanatics/theauthor.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+13:37:37 Lualhati Torres Bautista: The Author], Geocities.com, date retrieved 27 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translations of her novels==
Excerpts of Bautista's novels have been anthologized in ''Tulikärpänen'', a book of short stories written by Filipino women published in Finland by The Finnish-Philippine Society (FPS), a non-governmental organization founded in 1988. ''Tulikärpänen'' was edited and translated by Riitta Vartti, et al.  In ''Firefly: Writings by Various Authors'', the English version of the Finnish collection, the excerpt from the Filipino novel ''Gapô'' was given the title "The Night in Olongapo", while the excerpt from ''Bata, Bata, Pa'no Ka Ginawa?'' was titled "Children's Party".&lt;ref name="Vartti"&gt;[http://www.oovrag.com/books/firefly.shtml Firefly: Writings by Various Authors (Lualhati Bautista Translated into Finnish and English), Edited and Translated by Riitta Vartti, et al.

A full translation of Bautista's best works could better represent the characteristics of Filipino writing in international publishing. ''Dekada '70'' has been translated to the Japanese language and was published by Mekong Publishing House in the early 1990s. ''Tatlong Kuwento ng Buhay ni Julian Candelabra'' (1st prize, Palanca Memorial Awards for Literature, 1983) was translated in English and published by The Lifted Brow in Australia.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

A '''mechanical pencil''' (US English)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macmillandictionary.com/dictionary/american/mechanical-pencil mechanical pencil – definition. American English definition of mechanical pencil by Macmillan Dictionary]. Macmillandictionary.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''propelling pencil''' (UK English),&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/pro-pelling-pencil propelling pencil]. Cambridge Dictionary on-line {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828161030/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/pro-pelling-pencil |date=August 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; also '''clutch pencil''', is a [[pencil]] with a replaceable and mechanically extendable solid pigment core called a "lead" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɛ|d}}. The [[pencil lead|lead]], often made of [[graphite]], is not bonded to the outer casing, and can be mechanically extended as its point is worn away. Other names include '''microtip pencil''', '''automatic pencil''', '''drafting pencil''', '''technical pencil''', '''click pencil''',{{cn|date=August 2017}} '''pump pen''', '''pump pencil''', '''leadholder''', '''pen pencil''' (Indian English), and '''lead pencil''' (Bangladeshi and American English).

Mechanical pencils are used to provide lines of constant width without [[pencil sharpener|sharpening]] in [[technical drawing]] and in quick, neat writing. They have also been used for fine-art drawing. Since they do not have to be sharpened, they are also very popular with students. Mechanical pencils were first used in the 18th century, with many designs patented in the 19th and 20th centuries.

==History==
[[Image:Sampson Mordan 1822 pencil-holders patent.png|thumb|left|Detail of the first patent for a mechanical pencil of Sampson Mordan, 1822]]
[[Conrad Gesner]] described a leadholder pencil in 1565, but the lead had to be  manually adjusted to sharpen it.&lt;ref name=HP11&gt;[[Henry Petroski]], ''The Pencil:A History of Design and Circumstances'', Random House, 2011 Random House, 2011 {{ISBN|0307772438}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant example of a mechanical pencil was found aboard the wreckage of [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']], which sank in 1791.&lt;ref&gt;National Geographic Magazine, Vol. 168, No. 4 (October 1985), p. 450 (illustrated p. 451)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first patent for a refillable pencil with lead-propelling mechanism was issued to [[Sampson Mordan]] and [[John Isaac Hawkins]] in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1822. After buying out Hawkins' patent rights, Mordan entered into a business partnership with Gabriel Riddle from 1823 to 1837. The earliest Mordan pencils are thus hallmarked SMGR.&lt;ref name="LHM"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.leadholder.com/main-history.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824085520/http://www.leadholder.com/main-history.html | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2007-08-24 | title = History of Leadholders | publisher = Leadholders.com | date = 2008-01-04 | accessdate = 2008-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hill"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://markhillcollects.blogspot.com/2009/04/sampson-mordan-pencils.html | title=Sampson Mordan Pencils| publisher=Mark Hill Collects: The 20th Century Design and Collectibles Blog| date=2009-04-30 | accessdate=2009-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1837, Sampson Mordan ended the partnership with Riddle and continued to manufacture pencils as "S. Mordan &amp; Co". His company continued to manufacture pencils and a wide range of silver objects until [[World War II]], when the factory was bombed.

Between 1822 and 1874, more than 160 patents were registered pertaining to a variety of improvements to mechanical pencils. The first [[spring (device)|spring]]-loaded mechanical pencil was patented in 1877 and a twist-feed mechanism was developed in 1895. The 0.9&amp;nbsp;mm lead was introduced in 1938, and later it was followed by 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7 sizes. Eventually, 1.3 and 1.4&amp;nbsp;mm mechanisms were available, and 0.4 and 0.2 versions are now produced.

The mechanical pencil became successful in [[Japan]] with some improvements in 1915 by [[Tokuji Hayakawa]], a metal worker who had just finished his apprenticeship. It was introduced as the "Ever-Ready Sharp Pencil". Success was not immediate, since the metal shaft—essential for the pencil's long life—was unfamiliar to users. However, the Ever-Ready Sharp began selling in huge numbers after a company from [[Tokyo]] and [[Osaka]] made large orders.&lt;ref name=Sharp&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/only_one/index.html | work = Product Story | title = 1915: Hayakawa Mechanical Pencil | publisher = SHARP Corporate | date = | accessdate = 8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sharp-world.com/corporate/info/his/h_company/1915_1919/index.html | title = 1915-1919 : Invention of Ever-Sharp Pencil | publisher = SHARP Corporate | date = | accessdate = March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Tokuji Hayakawa's company got its name from that pencil: [[Sharp Corporation|Sharp]].&lt;ref name=Sharp/&gt;

At nearly the same time in the US, [[Charles R. Keeran]] was developing a similar pencil that would be the precursor of most of today's pencils. Keeran's design was ratchet-based, whereas Hayakawa's was screw-based. These two development histories – Hayakawa and Keeran – are often mistakenly combined into one.&lt;ref name=TaleOfTwoPencils&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.vintagepens.com/Eversharp_history.htm | title = A Tale of Two Pencils: Keeran's Eversharp &amp; Hayakawa's Ever-Ready Sharp | journal = The PENNANT | date = Winter 2001 | first = David | last = Nishimura | publisher = Pen Collectors of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keeran patented his lead pencil in 1915&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|1130741|"C. B. Keeran, Lead Pencil, Application Filed Oct.10, 1913."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon afterwards arranged production.&lt;ref name=TaleOfTwoPencils/&gt; After some improvements, his design was marketed as the "[[Eversharp]]" pencil by the Wahl Adding Machine Company; by the early 1920s, Wahl had sold more than 12,000,000 Eversharps.&lt;ref name=TaleOfTwoPencils/&gt;

Some of the manufacturers are: [[Pentel]], Pilot, [[Tombow]], [[Uni-ball]] and Zebra of Japan; [[Faber-Castell]], [[Lamy]], [[Rotring]] and [[Staedtler]] of Germany; [[Société Bic|Bic]] of France; [[PaperMate]] of USA; [[Caran d'Ache]] of Switzerland; Parker of UK and numerous Chinese, other Asian and European manufacurers.

==Mechanism types==
[[Image:Mechpencil05.jpg|thumb|A [[Pentel]] Sharp ratchet drafting pencil disassembled, showing three 0.5 mm graphite leads.]]
[[Image:Staedtler 925-25 05 Mechanical Pencil.JPG|thumb|A [[Staedtler]] 925-25 05 assembled (top) and disassembled (bottom).]]
[[File:Pentel Graphgear 0.5mm explosion.jpg|thumb|A Pentel GraphGear 1000 featuring a clip-operated retractable lead guide pipe.]]

Mechanical pencils can be divided into two basic types: those that both hold the lead and can actively propel it forward, and those that only hold the lead in position.

[[Screw]]-based pencils advance the lead by twisting a screw, which moves a slider down the barrel of the pencil. This was the most common type in the earlier part of the twentieth century. Many of these have a locking mechanism one way to allow the lead to be pushed back into the pencil.

A clutch pencil (or leadholder) tends to use thicker leads (2–5.6&amp;nbsp;mm) and generally holds only one piece of lead at a time. A typical clutch pencil is activated by pressing the eraser cap on the top, to open the jaws inside the tip and allow the lead to freely drop through from the barrel (or back into it when retracting). Because the lead falls out freely when the jaws are opened, its forward movement cannot be controlled except by external means. This can be easily done by keeping the tip of the pencil a few millimeters above a work surface or the palm of one's hand. Some clutch pencils do have mechanisms which incrementally advance the lead, such as the Alvin Tech-Matic leadholder, but these are not normally considered to be in the same category as most pencils with propelling mechanisms.

[[Ratchet (device)|Ratchet]]-based pencils are a variant of the clutch pencil, in which the lead is held in place by two or three small jaws inside a ring at the tip. The jaws are controlled by a button on the end or the side of the pencil. When the button is pushed, the jaws move forward and separate, allowing the lead to advance. When the button is released and the jaws retract, the "lead retainer" (a small rubber device inside the tip) keeps the lead in place, preventing the lead from either falling freely outward or riding back up into the barrel until the jaws recover their grip. Other designs use a precisely-fitted metal sleeve to guide and support the lead, and do not need a rubber retainer.

In one type of ratchet-based pencil (developed by Tombow Pencil Co.), shaking the pencil back and forth causes a weight inside the pencil to operate a mechanism in the cap. A button may be present on the top or side of the pencil, to allow the user to advance the lead manually when necessary. Another variation advances the lead automatically. In this design, the lead is advanced by a ratchet but only prevented from going back into the pencil, just held from falling by a small amount of [[friction]]. The nib is a spring-loaded collar that, when depressed as the lead is worn away, extends out again when pressure is released.

An advanced ratchet type has a mechanism that rotates the pencil lead 9° counter-clockwise every time the lead is pressed on to the paper (which counts as one stroke), to distribute wear evenly. This ''auto-rotation'' mechanism keeps the lead 50% narrower than in the common propelling mechanical pencils, resulting in uniform thickness of the lines written onto the paper. The design was first developed by Mitsubishi Pencil Company, and named ''Kuru Toga'' under the Uni brand.&lt;ref name="Kurutoga Website"&gt;[http://www.mpuni.co.jp/product/category/sharp_pen/kurutoga/index.html Kurutoga Website] Kuru Toga, which in Japanese, means "spinning to a taper". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919122735/http://www.mpuni.co.jp/product/category/sharp_pen/kurutoga/index.html |date=September 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of pencil is most suited for Asian languages that have multiple strokes per letter or word, where the pencil is frequently lifted off the paper. The mechanism is not suitable for cursive writing used in western scripts. Another recent auto-rotation movement by Uni rotates the lead 18 degrees per stroke (or 20 strokes per complete revolution), which is better suited for western scripts.

There exist protection mechanisms that prevent the lead from breaking (within certain limits) when excessive pressure is exerted while writing. A mechanism employed in the ''DelGuard'' system by Zebra of Japan, causes the lead sleeve to extend outward when excessive pressure is applied at an angle. When excess vertical pressure is applied on the lead, the lead is automatically retracted inwards.

Higher-end mechanical pencils sometimes feature a retractable lead guide pipe. This allows the lead guide pipe to retract back into the pencil body, which will keep it protected in storage and during transit and makes it 'pocket-safe'.

==Lead variations==
[[File:Caran dache fixpencil 0012.jpg|thumb|A mechanical pencil by [[Caran d'Ache (company)|Caran d'Ache]]]]
In spite of the name, pencil leads do not contain the toxic chemical element [[lead]], but are typically made with graphite and clay, or plastic polymers. Compared to standard pencils, mechanical pencils have a smaller range of marking types, though numerous variations exist. Most mechanical pencils can be refilled, but some inexpensive models are meant to be disposable and are discarded when empty.

===Diameter===
Mechanical pencil mechanisms use only a single lead diameter. Some pencils, such as the [[Pentel]] Function 357, place several mechanisms within the same housing, so as to offer a range of thicknesses (in this case three: 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm). 1.00&amp;nbsp;mm leads also exist, but they are very rare. (See table below.)

Different sizes of lead diameters are available to accommodate various preferences and pencil builds, as shown in the table below. The more common lead sizes are 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm, whose line widths provide a favourable balance between precision and strength. Less common lead sizes can range from 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm up to 5.6&amp;nbsp;mm. [[Pentel]] has also previously demonstrated a prototype 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm pencil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nichima.co.jp/news/entry/1747.html|title=ニュース - 文マガ|website=www.nichima.co.jp|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pencils with sub-millimeter leads can usually hold multiple leads at the same time, reducing the frequency of refills. One exception was the Pentel 350 E, possibly Pentel's first mechanical pencil,&lt;ref name=Pentel350&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leadholder.com/lh-thin-pentel-350.html |title=Pentel 350 Series Mechanical Pencil {{!}} Leadholder |publisher=Leadholder.com |accessdate=November 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626050201/http://leadholder.com/lh-thin-pentel-350.html |archivedate=June 26, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which could only hold a single stick of 0.5&amp;nbsp;mm lead. Refill leads can be bought in small tubes and inserted into the barrel as needed.

===Hardness===
As with non-mechanical pencils, the leads of mechanical pencils are available in a range of [[Pencil hardness|hardness ratings]], depending on the user's desired balance between darkness and durability. A commonly-used mechanical pencil lead is identical in density, but not in thickness to a traditional [[Number two pencils|HB (US #2)]] pencil lead.

===Pigments===
Mechanical pencils with colored leads are less common, but do exist. [[Crayola]]'s "Twistable" product line includes two different types of colored pencils (erasable and non-erasable) with mechanical feed mechanisms, but does not offer refill leads. Several companies such as [[Pentel]], [[Pilot (pen company)|Pilot]], and [[Uni-ball]] (Mitsubishi Pencil Co.) currently manufacture colored refill leads in a limited range of diameters (0.5&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.7&amp;nbsp;mm, or 2&amp;nbsp;mm) for their own products. [[Koh-i-Noor Hardtmuth|Koh-i-Noor]] makes mechanical colored pencils with replaceable leads in 2.0, 3.15 and 5.6&amp;nbsp;mm sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penciltalk.org/2009/07/koh-i-noor-2-0mm-leadholders-and-colour-leads Koh-I-Noor 2.0mm leadholders and colour leads]. pencil talk.

The '''National Language Debate''' in [[Fiji]] concerns the status of the country's three official languages - [[English language|English]], [[Fijian language|Fijian]], and Hindustani (the name used in the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 constitution]] for [[Fiji Hindi]]).  From [[British Empire|colonial times]], the sole official language was English, but the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|1997 Constitution]] gave equal status, for the first time, to Fijian and Hindustani, alongside English.

==Compulsory subject?==
There is considerable debate as to whether Fijian, and possibly also Hindi, should be compulsory school subjects.  In May and June 2005, a number of prominent Fiji Islanders called for the status of Fijian to be upgraded; the present Education Minister, [[Ro (title)|Ro]] [[Teimumu Kepa]] endorsed calls for it to be made compulsory, as did [[Great Council of Chiefs]] [[Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs|Chairman]] [[Ovini Bokini|Ratu Ovini Bokini]].  Similar calls came from [[Misiwini Qereqeretabua]], the Director of the [[Institute of Fijian Language and Culture]], and from [[Apolonia Tamata]], a [[linguistics]] [[lecturer]] at [[Suva]]'s [[University of the South Pacific]], who both said that recognition of the Fijian language is essential to the nation's basic identity, as a unifying factor in Fiji's multicultural society.

[[Fiji Labour Party]] (FLP) leader [[Mahendra Chaudhry]] also endorsed the call for Fijian to be made a national language and a compulsory school subject, provided that the same status be given to [[Hindi language|Hindi]] - a position echoed by [[Krishna Vilas]] of the [[National Reconciliation Committee]].

Academic and former Education Minister [[Taufa Vakatale]] said that she supported making [[Hindi language|Hindi]] available in all schools, but considered that Fijian should get priority.  ''"If the Indians in the country lost their language, there is a whole continent of people in India who would still have the language,"'' she said.  ''"In the whole world only 330,000 people know how to speak in Fijian and if it is lost, there is nowhere it can be revived from, that is why the Fijian language is very important to preserve."''

A investigation by the [[Rewa Province|Rewa]] [[Local government in Fiji|Provincial Council]], made public on 23 November 2005, revealed that 26 percent of indigenous children in the first and second grades of nine Rewa schools could not speak their own language.  The council was exploring ways to redress this area of concern.

[[Vice-President of Fiji|Vice-President]] [[Ratu]] [[Joni Madraiwiwi]] added his own voice on 9 January 2006 to the campaign to make Fijian a compulsory subject.  Addressing the 72nd annual meeting of the [[Fijian Teachers Association]] in [[Suva]], Madraiwiwi said that it was dangerous to assume that Fijian children would automatically learn their own language.  His parents' generation had emphasized prioritizing English on the assumption that Fijian could be learned later, but this had resulted in a generation knowing little Fijian, and unless the language was made compulsory at all levels of primary education, it would be lost to the next generation, he said.

==Why Fijian?==
[[Kamlesh Arya]], President of the [[Arya Pratindhi Sabha]] organization, said on 29 June 2005 that language was the window by which people could appreciate and absorb tradition, and that making both Fijian and Hindustani compulsory school subjects would promote social and cultural understanding between the two races. His organization taught Fijian to [[Indians in Fiji|Indo-Fijian]] students in primary schools at its own expense, he said.  Given the geographical and numerical limitations of the Fijian language, it needed to be given special attention on its own merit.

[[House of Representatives of Fiji|Parliamentarian]] [[Gaffar Ahmed]] of the FLP spoke out on 4 August 2005 in favour of establishing Fijian as the national language.  ''"To achieve national unity, multi-cultural and multi-racial harmony, we should have one common language which must be taught at all schools,"'' he told the House of Representatives.  He said that his own inability to speak Fijian was his greatest handicap as a Fijian citizen.

'''Original Oratory''' (often shortened to "'''OO'''") is a [[National Speech and Debate Association#Events|competitive event]] in the [[National Speech and Debate Association]], [[Stoa USA]], [[National Catholic Forensic League]], and other [[high school]] [[Individual events (speech)|forensic]] [[competition]]s in which competitors deliver an original speech on a subject of their choosing, though the speech must be factual. Though the rules for the category change from organization to organization, generally, an Oratory must be written and memorized by the performer and should be no more than ten minutes in length. No more than 150 words can be quoted. The finished speech must be approved by the National Speech and Debate Association. This speech is frequently highly persuasive and is normally about a slightly controversial topic. An orator is given free choice of subject and judged solely on the effectiveness of development and presentation.

Oratory topics are usually related to current problems in the world, and are delivered in a persuasive way as to motivate the audience to make a choice. However, this may not always be the case. Some orations may alert the audience of an imminent threat or inspire them to act now to initiate change. According to the [[National Speech and Debate Association]], the competitor is judged on:
* '''Speech Effectiveness''': Did the speech have any inspiration or purpose to make the audience react?
* '''Bodily Movement''': What gestures did the speaker perform to help the audience better visualize what you're saying?
* '''Supportment''': Was what the speaker said backed up by proof? Was the evidence visualized with current proof, past proof, or quoted by words from other experienced people?
* '''Factual''': Is what the speaker said really true? Was the purpose of your Oration mostly truthful and not mostly opinion based?

These are the questions the competitor and the judge should ask themselves before performing an Oration, to either an audience, or especially yourself. The key to gain the audience's attention isn't through your topic, it's through your passion. For instance, your topic could be that people today are lazy, but instead of changing it, they are accepting it. Now the topic itself '''interests''' the audience or judge.

== Judges ==

Judges are usually Original Oratory competitors, coaches, sponsors, parents, or friends of the host tournament. Coaches are prohibited from judging their own schools, and alumni competitors must wait two years before they are allowed to judge the school from which they graduated. In some states and leagues, alumni are not allowed to judge the school from which they graduated for up to four years; this is to ensure that one may not judge one's former teammates.

== Steps of an Oration ==

Because the oratory is the speaker's original work, Oratory does require some preparation, which  sets Oratory apart from Impromptu. The following are recommended parts of a good Oration:

1. '''Introduction''': The best way to deliver an Oratory is to grab the audience's attention and make them want to listen to the speaker's message, and not just ''hear'' another figure trying to persuade. Intro hooks include ''story'', ''startling fact'', ''question'', and ''joke''.

2. '''Body''': To keep an audience's attention the subject should be shown to be relevant to the audience; facts and startling figures can do this, although humorous examples and jokes also can help in explaining a topic.  There is suggested to be two sources per paragraph supporting your points.  There may be more or less depending on the specific needs of the paragraph. Award-winning oration often include both facts and humor.

3. '''Conclusion''': If one did not make a good impression on the audience before, chances are slim that one will not recover with a smashing conclusion. Reiterate, go over the main points of the speech and make it memorable for the audience.

== An example of speech construction ==
While having a factual baseline is still one of the most important parts of the speech, the inclusion of humor and personal anecdotes may boost performance. An oratory may follow a pattern:

'''Introduction''': The introduction may begin with a joke, a story, or an interesting fact, often called the "Attention Getting Device". A successful oratory will either make the audience and judge laugh or grab their attention. Apart from grabbing the attention of those listening, the main purpose of the introduction is to explain in an interesting and creative manner what your speech is about. It is often important to explicitly state from the very beginning what you are talking about so the judge and audience don't have to guess. This also makes it easier for the judge, because they know what sort of things to look for when listening to the speech. This is often done in a creative way, for example, if you were doing an oratory about school you might say, "First we'll stop at our lockers as we discuss the problem of school, then we'll head to pre-calc as we talk about the causes and effects that school has on our society, and finally, we'll go to lunch as I present a solution to this problem."

'''Problem''': After the introduction, an oratory will usually explain in a little more detail than what was given in the introduction what the topic is about. When doing this, the orator should explain why this topic is important. For example, if the topic is about individuality or being your own person, an Orator might explain that a decrease in individuality is bad because it lowers your ability to stand up for what you believe in or it makes you conform to standards instead of forming your own beliefs and values.

'''Causes/Effects''': Next, the orator could explain what is causing the problem. Since Oratory is generally a speech used to encourage people to take action against a problem, it is important to explain what specifically is causing the problem. This allows the audience to know specifically what they need to look out for. An orator will possibly explain that by attacking the problem by the "roots" (what causes it), it will be easiest to solve it. Similarly, it is important to explain the negative effects of the causes. Discussing the causes is important to the oratory because it validates the fact that the topic is, in fact, a significant problem.

'''Solution''': The most important part of an oratory is often considered the "solution." This should be creative, innovative, and should be presented in such a way that will encourage both the judge and the audience to take proactive measures to act against the problem. In an oratory about individuality, the solutions might be to 1) Relax and decide what you yourself want to do, 2) Resist temptations to simply follow others even though it might be the easiest way 3) Even if others don't follow you, if you think its right, then it is the best path for you personally to take. This part of the oratory will also explain the positive benefits of following these solutions which will make the judge and the audience want to listen to them (i.e. it gives the speech merit). It is imperative that the solution is not forgotten, otherwise an oratory is simply a wasted ten minutes. No one wants to hear about a problem without being told what they can do to fix it.

'''Conclusion''': Judges look at the conclusion and judge based on whether or not it ties in with the introduction. If you told a story about a problem you got yourself in for your introduction, use the conclusion to finish the story and tell how you fixed the problem. If it was a fact, elaborate on the fact. By tying the introduction to the conclusion, it gives the speech a feeling of fluidity.

Some other common patterns are Introduction – Cause – Effect – Solution – Conclusion and Introduction – Problem – Cause – Solution – Conclusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3053">'''Paul Detienne''' (30 December 1924, [[Rochefort, Belgium]] – 31 October 2016, [[Brussels]]) was a Belgian [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, noted for his literary endeavours in the [[Bengali language]]. His pen name was '''Father Detienne''' (Bengali: ফাদার দ্যতিয়েন).&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/A-few-good-men-and-the-language-they-loved/articleshow/30130869.cms Times of India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harmonyindia.org/hportal/VirtualPageView.jsp?page_id=22328&amp;index1=8 Harmony magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

He began his religious training in the early 1940s and arrived in [[West Bengal]] in 1949, where he stayed until 1977. He studied [[Bengali language]] and literature at [[St Xavier’s College, Kolkata]] and at [[Santiniketan]] and went on to become a noted writer of Bengali in his own right. He is best known for his column ''Diaryr Chhenra Pata'' (''ডায়েরির ছেঁড়াপাতা'',''Torn Pages of My Diary'') which first appeared in the premiere Bengali literary magazine ''[[Desh (magazine)|Desh]]'' and ran on and off for many years. They were eventually compiled into a book. Other diaristic books he published include ''Atpoure Dinpanjee'' (''আটপৌরে দিনপঞ্জি'') and ''Rojnamcha'' (''রোজনামচা'') as well as the compilation ''Godyo Songraha'' (''গদ্য সংগ্রহ''). 
[[File:Paul Detienne (Bengali writings).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.1|Bengali writings of Father Detienne]]
Father Detienne is credited with rescuing the Bengali ''Itihasmala'' (''ইতিহাসমালা'') by [[William Carey (missionary)|William Carey]], the 18th-century missionary who did pioneering work on the Bengali language. He also translated writers such as [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Saint-Exupéry]] and [[Mircea Eliade]] into Bengali. His life's work was rewarded by the [[Paschimbanga Bangla Academy]] in 2010, when he won the prestigious [[Rabindra Smriti Puroshkar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuites.be/Prix-litteraire-pour-le-Pere-Paul.html Prize news]&lt;/ref&gt;

He returned to Belgium in 1977 and worked as [[hospital chaplain]] till retirement in 1989. He collaborated also with the Belgian Jesuit theological journal [http://www.nrt.be Nouvelle revue théologique] as a book reviewer. He reviewed approximately 800 books in 20 years, which are available [http://www.nrt.be/index.php?page=recensions&amp;lang=fr&amp;lang=fr&amp;annee=1999-2016&amp;numero=tous&amp;theme=tous&amp;recenseur=10298&amp;recherche=&amp;auteur=&amp;action=chercher&amp;afficher_tout=1 online].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2396">In mathematics,  '''primitive recursive set functions''' or  '''primitive recursive ordinal functions''' are analogs of [[primitive recursive function]]s, defined for sets or ordinals rather than natural numbers. They were introduced by {{harvtxt|Jensen|Karp|1971}}.

==Definition==

A primitive recursive set function is a function from sets to sets that can be obtained from the following basic functions by repeatedly applying the following rules of substitution and recursion:

The basic functions are:
*Projection: ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''n'',''m''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;
*Zero: ''F''(''x'') = 0
*[[Axiom of adjunction|Adjoining an element to a set]]: ''F''(''x'',''y'') = ''x'' ∪ {''y''}
*Testing membership: ''C''(''x'',''y'',''u'',''v'') = ''x'' if ''u'' ∈ ''v'', ''y'' otherwise.

The rules for generating new functions by substitution are
*''F''('''x''','''y''') = ''G''('''x''',''H''('''x'''),'''y''')
*''F''('''x''','''y''') = ''G''(''H''('''x'''),'''y''')
where '''x''' and '''y''' are finite sequences of variables.

The rule for generating new functions by recursion is
*''F''(''z'','''x''') = ''G''(∪&lt;sub&gt;''u''∈''z''&lt;/sub&gt;''F''(''u'','''x'''),''z'','''x''')

A primitive recursive ordinal function is defined in the same way, except that the initial function ''F''(''x'',''y'') = ''x''∪{''y''} is replaced by ''F''(''x'') = ''x''∪{''x''} (the successor of ''x''). The primitive recursive ordinal functions are the same as the primitive recursive set functions that map ordinals to ordinals.

One can also add more initial functions to obtain a larger class of functions. For example, the ordinal function ω&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt; is not primitive recursive, because the constant function with value ω (or any other infinite set) is not primitive recursive, so one might want to add this constant function to the initial functions.

[[File:Grama Bay. Albania 2017-08 06.jpg|right|thumb|250px|One of the antique rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay]]
The '''rock inscriptions of the Grama Bay''' (Albanian ''mbishkrimet shkëmbore në Gjirin e Gramës'') is an archaeological site in Southwestern [[Albania]], [[Vlorë County]], in the [[Grama Bay]] located on the [[Ionian Sea|Ionian coast]] of the [[Karaburun Peninsula, Albania|Karaburun Mountains]], including roughly 1,500 [[epigraphy|rock inscriptions]] that date from the 3rd century BC to the 15th-16th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.persee.fr/doc/reg_0035-2039_2007_num_120_2_7870&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the bay originates from the Greek word ''γράμμα'' meaning ’letter’.

The little bay with difficult overland access but with abundant springs had always been a favorite stopping place and shelter for the ones sailing along the coast: mariners, soldiers, merchants and pirates. The city of [[Oricum]], located 12&amp;nbsp;km to the north, was founded in the 7th century BC, and the inhabitants started to use the Grama Bay as a quarry in the 3rd century BC from where they could extract limestone of good quality. The first inscriptions carved into the eastern rock face of the bay were made by the quarry workers themselves. During the following 2,000 years further mariners made their signs on the rock which ended up in the former quarry covered by 1,500 inscriptions. Majority is written in [[Ancient Greek]] and [[Latin]], but inscriptions in [[Messapian language]] as well as ones made by [[Byzantine Greeks]] or [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] are also included. These typically give the name of the people and that of their vessels and often invoke the Dioscuri. Historical figures also showed up in the Grama Bay and put their marks on the rock, such as [[Pompey]] in 48 BC or [[John V Palaiologos]] in around 1369. The Roman statesman [[Sulla]] was actually never visiting the bay, but in 86 BC after defeating [[Mithridates VI of Pontus]] during the [[First Mithridatic War]] he ordered to commemorate his triumph with a new inscription made on the Grama Bay’s rocks. The medieval inscriptions call upon the Lord for his help. 

Those arriving to the Grama Bay after the 15th century continued the tradition of making their own [[graffiti|graffito]], but these pieces are of less archaeological value. Most considerably one can see inscriptions made by the hands of [[Himara|Himariote]]s during the 19th-20th centuries as well as graffito of [[Enver Hoxha]]’s soldiers in the second half of the 20th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21100">In [[software]], a '''spell checker''' (or '''spell check''') is a [[software feature]] that checks for misspellings in a [[text]]. Features are often in [[application software|software]], such as a [[word processor]], [[email client]], electronic [[dictionary]], or [[search engine]].

The original version of this poem was written by Jerrold H. Zar in 1992.  An unsophisticated spell checker will find little or no fault with this poem because it checks words in isolation.  A more sophisticated spell checker will make use of a [[language model]] to consider the context in which a word occurs.

[[File:Spell checker.jpg|thumb|[[Google Chrome]] spell checker in action for the above poem, the word "chequer" marked as unrecognized word]]

==Design==
A basic spell checker carries out the following processes:
* It scans the text and extracts the words contained in it.
* It then compares each word with a known list of correctly spelled words (i.e. a dictionary). This might contain just a list of words, or it might also contain additional information, such as hyphenation points or lexical and grammatical attributes.
* An additional step is a language-dependent algorithm for handling [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Even for a lightly inflected language like [[English language|English]], the spell-checker will need to consider different forms of the same word, such as plurals, verbal forms, [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s, and [[possessive (linguistics)|possessive]]s. For many other languages, such as those featuring agglutination and more complex declension and conjugation, this part of the process is more complicated.

It is unclear whether morphological analysis&amp;mdash;allowing for many different forms of a word depending on its grammatical role&amp;mdash;provides a significant benefit for English, though its benefits for highly [[synthetic language]]s such as German, Hungarian or Turkish are clear.

As an adjunct to these components, the program's [[user interface]] will allow users to approve or reject replacements and modify the program's operation.

An alternative type of spell checker uses solely statistical information, such as [[n-gram]]s, to recognize errors instead of correctly-spelled words. This approach usually requires a lot of effort to obtain sufficient statistical information. Key advantages include needing less runtime storage and the ability to correct errors in words that are not included in a dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Patent 6618697, Method for rule-based correction of spelling and grammar errors&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- The cited U.S. patent was used to implement a dictionary-less spelling correction algorithm for Graffiti on the Palm Pilot in only about 8k of memory. Another reference is "What Makes a Great Invention?", Wall Street Journal, 10/23/2003, https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB106684550065867100. An n-gram based algorithm is also included in Solr: http://lucidworks.com/blog/getting-started-spell-checking-with-apache-lucene-and-solr/.--&gt;

In some cases spell checkers use a fixed list of misspellings and suggestions for those misspellings; this less flexible approach is often used in paper-based correction methods, such as the ''see also'' entries of encyclopedias.

Clustering algorithms have also been used for spell checking&lt;ref&gt;de Amorim, R.C.; Zampieri, M.

==History==
In 1961, [[Les Earnest]], who headed the research on this budding technology, saw it necessary to include the first spell checker that accessed a list of 10,000 acceptable words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Earnest|first=Les|title=The First Three Spelling Checkers|url=http://www.stanford.edu/~learnest/spelling.pdf|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=10 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022091418/http://www.stanford.edu/~learnest/spelling.pdf|archivedate=22 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Gorin, a graduate student under Earnest at the time, created the first true spelling checker program written as an applications program (rather than research) for general English text: Spell for the DEC PDP-10 at Stanford University's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, in February 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Peterson | first1 = James | title = Computer Programs for Detecting and Correcting Spelling Errors | date = Dec 1980 | url = http://simson.net/ref/2006/csci_e-180/ref/spelling-p676-peterson.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gorin wrote SPELL in assembly language, for faster action; he made the first spelling corrector by searching the word list for plausible correct spellings that differ by a single letter or adjacent letter transpositions and presenting them to the user.  Gorin made SPELL publicly accessible, as was done with most SAIL (Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory) programs, and it soon spread around the world via the new ARPAnet, about ten years before personal computers came into general use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Earnest | first1 = Les | title = Visible Legacies for Y3K | url = http://stanford.edu/~learnest/legacies.pdf | accessdate = 2011-02-18 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110720044806/http://stanford.edu/~learnest/legacies.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Spell, its algorithms and data structures inspired the Unix ispell program.
  
The first spell checkers were widely available on mainframe computers in the late 1970s.  A group of six linguists from [[Georgetown University]] developed the first spell-check system for the IBM corporation.&lt;ref name="cled.georgetown.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cled.georgetown.edu/faculty/|title=Georgetown U Faculty &amp; Staff: The Center for Language, Education &amp; Development|accessdate=2008-12-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205140452/http://cled.georgetown.edu/faculty/|archivedate=2009-02-05|df=}}, citation: "Maria Mariani... was one of a group of six linguists from Georgetown University who developed the first spell-check system for the IBM corporation."&lt;/ref&gt;

The first spell checkers for personal computers appeared for [[CP/M]] and [[TRS-80]] computers in 1980, followed by packages for the [[IBM PC]] after it was introduced in 1981. Developers such as Maria Mariani,&lt;ref name="cled.georgetown.edu"/&gt; [[Random House]],&lt;ref name="pc198211"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vy3cBZkjbZgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=The Spelling Bee Is Over | work=PC Magazine | date=November 1982 | accessdate=21 October 2013 | author=Advertisement | pages=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft-Art, Microlytics, Proximity, Circle Noetics, and Reference Software{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} rushed [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] packages or end-user products into the rapidly expanding software market, primarily for the PC but also for [[Apple Macintosh]], [[VAX]], and [[Unix]]. On the PCs, these spell checkers were standalone programs, many of which could be run in [[Terminate and Stay Resident|TSR]] mode from within word-processing packages on PCs with sufficient memory.

However, the market for standalone packages was short-lived, as by the mid-1980s developers of popular word-processing packages like [[WordStar]] and [[WordPerfect]] had incorporated spell checkers in their packages, mostly licensed from the above companies, who quickly expanded support from just [[English language|English]] to [[Europe]]an and eventually even [[Asian language]]s. However, this required increasing sophistication in the morphology routines of the software, particularly with regard to heavily-[[agglutinative]] languages like [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. Although the size of the word-processing market in a country like [[Iceland]] might not have justified the investment of implementing a spell checker, companies like WordPerfect nonetheless strove to localize their software for as many national markets as possible as part of their global [[marketing]] strategy.

[[Firefox]] 2.0, a [[web browser]], has spell check support for user-written content, such as when editing Wikitext, writing on many [[webmail]] sites, [[blogs]], and [[social networking]] websites. The web browsers [[Google Chrome]], [[Konqueror]], and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], the email client [[Kmail]] and the [[instant messaging]] [[client (computing)|client]] [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]] also offer spell checking support, transparently using previously [[GNU Aspell]] and currently [[Hunspell]] as their engine. [[Mac OS X]] now has spell check system-wide, extending the service to virtually all bundled and third party applications.

Some spell checkers have separate support for medical dictionaries to help prevent medical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2017 |url=https://e-medtools.com/openmedspel.html |title=Medical Spell Checker for Firefox and Thunderbird |publisher=e-MedTools |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Quathamer |first1=Dr. Tobias |year=2016 |url=https://github.com/toddy15/medicalterms |title=German medical dictionary words |publisher=Dr. Tobias Quathamer |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Friedman |first1=Richard A. |last2=D |first2=M |year=2003 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/health/cases-do-spelling-and-penmanship-count-in-medicine-you-bet.html |title=CASES; Do Spelling and Penmanship Count? In Medicine, You Bet |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=2018-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==
The first spell checkers were "verifiers" instead of "correctors." They offered no suggestions for incorrectly spelled words. This was helpful for [[typos]] but it was not so helpful for logical or phonetic errors. The challenge the developers faced was the difficulty in offering useful suggestions for misspelled words. This requires reducing words to a skeletal form and applying pattern-matching algorithms.

It might seem logical that where spell-checking dictionaries are concerned, "the bigger, the better," so that correct words are not marked as incorrect. In practice, however, an optimal size for English appears to be around 90,000 entries. If there are more than this, incorrectly spelled words may be skipped because they are mistaken for others. For example, a linguist might determine on the basis of [[corpus linguistics]] that the word ''[[baht]]'' is more frequently a misspelling of ''bath'' or ''bat'' than a reference to the Thai currency. Hence, it would typically be more useful if a few people who write about Thai currency were slightly inconvenienced than if the spelling errors of the many more people who discuss baths were overlooked.
[[Image:Spell check.PNG|right|thumb|A screenshot of [[Enchant (software)|Enchant]], the [[AbiWord]] spell checker.]]
The first MS-DOS spell checkers were mostly used in proofing mode from within word processing packages. After preparing a document, a user scanned the text looking for misspellings. Later, however, batch processing was offered in such packages as [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s short-lived CoAuthor and allowed a user to view the results after a document was processed and correct only the words that were known to be wrong. When memory and processing power became abundant, spell checking was performed in the background in an interactive way, such as has been the case with the Sector Software produced Spellbound program released in 1987 and [[Microsoft Word]] since Word 95.

In recent years, spell checkers have become increasingly sophisticated; some are now capable of recognizing simple [[grammatical]] errors. However, even at their best, they rarely catch all the errors in a text (such as [[homophone]] errors) and will flag [[neologism]]s and foreign words as misspellings. Nonetheless, spell checkers can be considered as a type of [[foreign language writing aid]] that non-native language learners can rely on to detect and correct their misspellings in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Banks, T. (2008). [http://eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED501062.pdf ''Foreign Language Learning Difficulties and Teaching Strategies'']. (pp. 29). Master's Thesis, Dominican University of California. Retrieved 19 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spell-checking non-English languages ==

English is unusual in that most words used in formal writing have a single spelling that can be found in a typical dictionary, with the exception of some jargon and modified words. In many languages, words are often [[concatenation|concatenated]] into new combinations of words. In German, compound nouns are frequently coined from other existing nouns. Some scripts do not clearly separate one word from another, requiring word-splitting algorithms. Each of these presents unique challenges to non-English language spell checkers.

==Context-sensitive spell checkers==
# Recently, research has focused on developing algorithms that are capable of recognizing a misspelled word, even if the word itself is in the vocabulary, based on the context of the surrounding words. Not only does this allow words such as those in the poem above to be caught, but it mitigates the detrimental effect of enlarging dictionaries, allowing more words to be recognized. For example, ''[[baht]]'' in the same paragraph as ''Thai'' or ''Thailand'' would not be recognized as a misspelling of ''bath''. The most common example of errors caught by such a system are [[homophone]] errors, such as the bold words in the following sentence:
:'''Their''' coming '''too''' '''sea''' if '''its''' '''reel'''.

The most successful algorithm to date is Andrew Golding and Dan Roth's "[[Winnow (algorithm)|Winnow]]-based  spelling correction algorithm",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u13k033301184r82/ |title=Journal Article |author= |date= |work= |publisher=SpringerLink |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1999, which is able to recognize about 96% of context-sensitive spelling errors, in addition to ordinary non-word spelling errors. A [[Context sensitive user interface|context-sensitive]] spell checker appears in [[Microsoft Office 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB116786111022966326 |title=Review |author=Walt Mossberg |date= 4 January 2007|work= |publisher=Wall Street Journal |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://smallseo.tools/grammar-checker |title=Spell and Grammar Checker |author=Malik Junaid Rasheed |date= 4 September 2016|work= |publisher=Small SEO Tools |accessdate=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Wave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2009/05/googles-context-sensitive-spell-checker.html |title=Google Operating System  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=googlesystem.blogspot.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}} {{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.co.uk/2009/05/googles-context-sensitive-spell-checker.html|title=Google's Context-Sensitive Spell Checker |author= |date=May 29, 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Ghotit Dyslexia Software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ghotit.com |title=Ghotit Dyslexia Software for People with Learning Disabilities |author= |date= |work= |publisher=Ghotit.com |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; context spell checker tuned for people with dyslexia.

== Criticism ==

Some critics{{Who|date=August 2010}} of technology and computers have attempted to link spell checkers to a trend of skill losses in writing, reading, and speaking. They claim that computers have made people lazy, often not proofreading written work except for a simple pass through a spell checker. Supporters{{Who|date=August 2010}} claim that these changes may actually be beneficial to society, by making writing and learning new languages more accessible to ordinary people. They claim that the skills lost by the use of automated spell checkers are replaced by better skills, such as faster and more efficient research skills.{{clarifyme|date=October 2016}} Other supporters of technology point out that these skills are not being lost by people who use written language frequently in their work, such as authors and journalists.&lt;ref&gt;Baase, Sara. A Gift of Fire: Social, Legal, and Ethical Issues for Computing and the Internet. 3. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2007. Pages 357-358. {{ISBN|0-13-600848-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of the folly of relying completely on spell checkers is shown in the Spell-checker Poem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulhensel.org/teachspell.html |title=Candidate for a Pullet Surprise |author=Jerrold H. Zar |date= |work=Northern Illinois University |publisher= |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; above. It was originally composed by Dr Jerrold H. Zar&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bios.niu.edu/zar/zar.shtml |title=Retired faculty page |author= |date= |work= |publisher=NIU.edu |accessdate=6 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1991, assisted by Mark Eckman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grammar.about.com/od/spelling/a/spellcheck.htm |title=The Spell Checker Poem, by Mark Eckman and Jerrold H. Zar
 |author= Richard Nordquist |date= |work= |publisher=About.com |accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an original length of 225 words, and containing 123 incorrectly used words. According to most unsophisticated spell checkers, the poem is valid, but most people can tell at a simple glance that most words are used incorrectly. As a result, spell checkers are sometimes derided as '''spilling chuckers''' or similar, slightly misspelled names.

Not all critics are opponents of technological progress, however. An article based on research by Galletta et al.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.education.com/magazine/article/spell_check/ Education.com] Is Spell Check Creating a Generation of Dummies?&lt;/ref&gt; reports that higher verbal skills are needed for highest performance when using a spell checker.{{clarifyme|date=October 2016}} The theory suggested that only writers with higher verbal skills could recognize and ignore false positives or incorrect suggestions. However, it was found that those with the higher skills lost their unaided performance advantage in multiple categories of errors, performing as poorly as the low verbals with the spell-checkers turned on. The conclusion points to some evidence of a loss of skill.

Wobé is known for claims that it has the largest number of [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]] (fourteen) of any language in the world.&lt;ref name=Bearth&amp;Link&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/sal/article/view/1070.html | title = The tone puzzle of Wobe | first1 = Thomas | last1 = Bearth | first2 = Christa | last2 = Link | journal = Studies in African Linguistics | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | year = 1980 | pages = 147–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has not been confirmed by other researchers, many of whom believe that some of these will turn out to be sequences of tones or prosodic effects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/elanguage/sal/article/view/1154.html | first = John Victor | last = Singler | title = On the underlying representation of contour tones in Wobe | journal = Studies in African Linguistics | volume = 15 | issue = 1 | year = 1984 | pages = 59–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Paul | last = Newman | chapter = Contour Tones in Grebo | title = The Phonological Representation of Suprasegmentals |  editor1-first = Harry | editor1-last = van der Hulst | editor2-first = Koen | editor2-last = Bogers | editor3-first = Marten | editor3-last = Mous | series = Publications in African Languages and Linguistics (Book 4) | publisher = De Gruyter Mouton | year = 1986 | pages = 190–191 (notes 12 and 14)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newman believes Singler is a valuable counterweight to Bearth &amp; Link, but does not accept all his criticism; he accept the Wobe 43 toneme, for example, but believes it should be analyzed as /32/ (all tones being off by 1 compared to related dialects).&lt;/ref&gt; though the Wèè languages in general do have extraordinarily large tone systems.

The fourteen posited tones are:&lt;ref name=Bearth&amp;Link /&gt;

'''Yerkish''' is an artificial [[language]] developed for use by [[human|non-human]] [[primate]]s. It employs a [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]] whose keys contain ''lexigrams'', [[symbol]]s corresponding to objects or ideas.&lt;ref name=interactive&gt;{{cite web |title=Interactive Lexigram, History of Ape Language |url=http://www.greatapetrust.org/science/history-of-ape-language/interactive-lexigram/ |website=[[Great Ape Trust]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100520131446/http://www.greatapetrust.org/science/history-of-ape-language/interactive-lexigram/ |archivedate=May 20, 2010 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''lexigram''' represents a word but is not necessarily indicative of the object to which it refers. Lexigrams were notably used by the [[Georgia State University]] Language Research Center to communicate with [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s. Researchers and primates were able to communicate using lexigram boards made in up to three panels with a total of 384 keys.&lt;ref name=interactive/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kluger, [http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,2008759,00.html "Inside the Minds of Animals"], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', August 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:LexigramSue.jpg|thumbnail|right|Lexigram representing [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]], a developer of the language]]
The language was developed by [[Ernst von Glasersfeld]] and used by Duane Rumbaugh and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] of Georgia State University while working with primates at the [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]] of [[Emory University]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. Primates were taught to communicate by means of a lexigram board, a computerized array of keys labeled with lexigrams. Von Glasersfeld coined the term "lexigram" in 1971, created the first 120 of them, and designed the grammar that regulated their combination. This artificial language was called Yerkish in honor of [[Robert M. Yerkes]], the founder of the laboratory within which the lexigrams were first used.

The first ape trained to communicate in Yerkish was the chimpanzee [[Lana (chimpanzee)|Lana]], beginning in 1973 within the context of the LANA project. Von Glaserfeld created approximately 150 of the first words in the Yerkish language, and went on to use 25 of them in his initial experiment with Lana - a chimpanzee whom researchers were hoping would not only interpret the  Yerkish language, but would also participate in communication with others through this newfound language. A keyboard was created for Lana with each key representing various nouns or verbs such as food, eat, apple, drink, etc. After pressing a certain key, the corresponding item would emerge from a food dispenser placed next to the keyboard, and through a series of experiments, researchers hoped that Lana would learn to interpret what each key would correlate to and learn to meaningfully communicate her requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bettoni|first=Marco|date=2007|title=The Yerkish Language.

==History==

=== Zanerian College of Penmanship ===
[[Image:Zanerian College of Penmanship.jpg|thumb|right|Zanerian College of Penmanship]]
Founded by Master Penman [[Charles Paxton Zaner]], the company’s history can be traced back to 1888 when it was known as the Zanerian College of Penmanship. Zaner was able to streamline the [[Spencerian script]] method—which was widely used in the 19th century—by adapting a [[handwriting]] approach that was more practicable for modern business documents and personal communication.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=c7CRrquqifEC&amp;pg=PT242 Zaner-Bloser Script]&lt;/ref&gt; Zaner’s enthusiasm about this utilitarian art inspired him to open a school that would prepare students for successful careers in the penmanship industry.&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zaner-Bloser company history|url=https://www.zaner-bloser.com/our-history-zaner-bloser|work=Zaner-Bloser company history|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1891, Zaner sold shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship to another skilled penman, Elmer Ward Bloser (forming the partnership that later created the Zaner-Bloser Company). While most [[penmanship]] schools at the time focused on training students for careers in ornamental writing, the Zanerian College emphasized the importance of an eclectic education by teaching psychology, physiology, and English composition.&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history" /&gt;

=== Formation ===
In 1895, the Zanerian College of Penmanship became known as the Zaner-Bloser Company, which continued to offer penmanship courses and began publishing professional materials about handwriting and illustration and selling handwriting supplies.&lt;ref name="IAMPETH Zanerian College:Historical Beginnings of the Zaner-Bloser Company"&gt;{{cite web|title=IAMPETH Zanerian College|url=http://www.iampeth.com/zanerian_college.php|work=Historical Beginnings of the Zaner-Bloser Company|accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zaner &amp; Bloser Company published ''The Zaner Method of Arm Movement Writing'' in 1904, making the simplified Zanerian writing style more readily accessible to children in elementary schools all over the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arm Movement Method of Rapid Writing|url=https://www.iampeth.com/pdf/arm-movement-method-rapid-writing|website=IAMPETH|accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Zaner-Bloser, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Highlights for Children]].&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history" /&gt;

== Contributors ==

===Charles Paxton Zaner===
[[Image:CP Zaner.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Paxton Zaner]]
Charles Paxton Zaner, born near Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 1864, began showing a fondness for handwriting early in his youth. In 1882, he enrolled in G. W. Michael's Pen Art Hall in Oberlin, Ohio. After graduation, Zaner worked as a penman at two different business colleges before deciding to open his own school in 1888—the Zanerian College of Penmanship.&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history" /&gt;

In 1889, fellow Master Penman Lloyd Kelchner became a partner with Zaner and two years later, Elmer Ward Bloser—another skilled penman—joined the partnership. That same year, Kelchner left the business arrangement, leading Zaner and Bloser to become equal partners in what had then become the Zaner-Bloser Company.&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history" /&gt;

Zaner built a reputation for himself as a Master Penman. He maximized his exposure and recognition in the industry with monthly magazines that included countless lessons in penmanship and pen art, for which he enlisted the help of other industry experts. This, as well as numerous other endeavors, established Zaner as a pivotal figure in what is called the "Golden Age of Ornamental Penmanship".&lt;ref name="Zaner-Bloser company history" /&gt;

===Elmer Ward Bloser===
Elmer Ward Bloser was born in 1865 and raised on his parents’ farm in Pennsylvania. His interest in writing was apparent even as a child, when he sold writing inks and supplies to neighborhood children. In 1883, Bloser began attending G.W. Michael’s Pen Art Hall, where his writing acumen eventually earned him a position as penmanship instructor.&lt;ref name="Zanerian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Paxton Zaner|url=http://www.zanerian.com/Zaner.html|work=Zanerian|accessdate=2013-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloser’s penmanship career advanced with such success that he was considered one of the finest in the industry. In 1891, he purchased shares of the Zanerian College of Penmanship, which later became the Zaner-Bloser Company. After Charles Paxton Zaner's untimely death in 1918, Bloser purchased the company’s remaining shares and continued to manage Zaner-Bloser’s successful operation until his own death in 1929.&lt;ref name="Zanerian"/&gt;
