'''900 West Randolph''' is  proposed skyscraper in [[Chicago]] designed by architectural firm Morris Adjmi. As proposed, the building will contain residences. It is one of two buildings proposed by developer [[Related Companies|Related Midwest]] in the [[West Loop]] opposed by local residents due to their height. The other is [[725 West Randolph]].

Adjmi took cues from the infrastructure of Chicago in designing the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chicago.curbed.com/2018/1/31/16952236/west-loop-condo-tower-development-adjmi|title=Morris Adjmi's 51-story Fulton Market condo tower makes its public debut|last=Koziarz|first=Jay|date=31 January 2018|publisher=Curbed|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berthe Cabra''' née '''Gheude de Contreras''' (27 June 1864, [[Brussels]] – 26 January 1947) was a Belgian married to Commander Alphonse Cabra of the Belgian army with the claim to be the first European woman to travel across Africa from west to east over land between 1905 and 1906.

[[File:Berthe_Cabra.JPG|thumb|left|Cabra c. 1900]]
Berthe was the daughter of Jean-Martin Gheude and d'Euphrosyne d'Alcantara de Contreras. She married Alphonse Cabra on 25 April 1901 and travelled with him across Africa. The mission was to delineate the boundary between the Belgian Congo and the French colonies. [[Leopold II of Belgium|King Leopold II]] allowed Berthe to accompany Alphonse despite his reluctance. The couple left Brussels on 10 April 1905 and travelled from Napoli aboard the ''Margraff'' and reached Mombasa in East Africa. They used the railway line to and crossed Lake Victoria using the [[SS Sybil (1901)|SS Sybil]]. They then moved to the foot of Stanley Falls and then down the Congo river to Matadi and finally Boma reaching in October 1906.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite book|first=Éliane |last=Gubin||title= Dictionnaire des femmes belges, XIXe et XXe siècles|place= Bruxelles|publisher= Éditions Racine|year= 2006|pages= 276-277|isbn=978-2-873864-34-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabra received the Chevalier of the Order of the Crown in 1925, Knight of the Order of Leopold in 1926 and the Congo commemorative medal in 1929. In 1932, she founded a scholarship of 50,000 francs at the Colonial University of Antwerp.&lt;ref name=bio /&gt;

[[File:Nalepka ob plebiscitu Kmet je knez v Jugoslaviji 1920.jpg|thumb|A Yugoslav propaganda sticker. The text reads: "In Yugoslavia, the farmer is the prince. In German Austria, the Jews and the barons are."]]
The '''Carinthian plebiscite''' ({{lang-de|Kärntner Volksabstimmung}}, {{lang-sl|Koroški plebiscit}}) was held on 10 October 1920 in the area predominantly settled by [[Carinthian Slovenes]]. It determined the final southern border between the [[First Austrian Republic|Republic of Austria]] and the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (Yugoslavia) after [[World War I]].

==Background==
{{Main|Austrian-Slovene clashes in Carinthia}}

After the defeat of the multi-ethnic [[Austria-Hungary]] and the ruling [[Habsburg dynasty]] in [[World War I]], new states arose in its former territory. Among these there was an internationally unrecognized [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], which was created in the final days of the war according to the 1917 [[Corfu Declaration]], and merged with the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] on December 1, 1918.

Determination of borders between the new countries was complex and difficult, and not always peaceful: While the northeastern border with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]] along the "[[Julian March]]" was already determined by the 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], the demarcation line between Yugoslavia and the rump state of [[Republic of German-Austria|German-Austria]] was a difficult and highly disputed matter. The principle of [[self-determination]], championed by U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], was taken up by both [[Slovenes]] and [[Austrians|German-Austrians]] in the [[Duchy of Carinthia|Carinthian]], [[Duchy of Styria|Styrian]] and [[Duchy of Carniola|Carniolan]] lands of the defunct Habsburg empire. The rising tensions culminated in clashes of arms, as on [[Marburg's Bloody Sunday]] in [[Styria (Slovenia)|Lower Styria]] and the continued fighting of [[paramilitary]] groups in southeastern Carinthia.

In particular the "Carinthian question" had become an issue in the closing days of World War I, when events developed rapidly, beginning with territorial claims by the Slovenian National Assembly on October 17, 1918. These claims were rejected by the Carinthian provisional ''[[Landtag]]'' assembly on 25 October 1918, declaring the state's accession to German-Austria. From November 5, Yugoslav forces moved into the settlement area of the [[Carinthian Slovenes]] from the [[Karawanks]] mountain range down to the [[Drava]] River and beyond. The ''Landtag'' assembly fled from [[Klagenfurt]] to the northwestern town of [[Spittal an der Drau]] and on 11 November officially demanded self-determination, which in this case amounted to demanding a [[plebiscite]] for a region with a mixed population.

With the occupation of southeastern Carinthia by Yugoslav troops, the confrontation evolved into armed clashes. The provisional Carinthian government under Governor Arthur Lemisch decided to lead off the armed struggle in order to preserve the southern Carinthian border on the Karawanks range. Bitter fighting of paramilitary groups around [[Arnoldstein]] and [[Ferlach]] alarmed the [[Allies of World War I|Entente]] powers. They arbitrated a ceasefire, whereafter a nine-day [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] commission under Lt.Col. [[Sherman Miles]] scouted the disputed region between river and mountains in January and February 1919 and made the crucial recommendation that the Karawanks frontier should be retained, thus opening the possibility of a plebiscite. Yugoslav representatives urged for a border on the Drava; [[United States|American]] delegates however spoke in favor of preserving the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and convinced the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] and [[French Third Republic|French]] delegations. Until May 7, all occupied Carinthian territories were vacated. When Yugoslav forces under General [[Rudolf Maister]] made an attempt to re-enter the region on 28 May 1919, they were forced to withdraw by the Entente authorities.

The question was whether the considerable Slovene-speaking majority in the state's southeastern region, adjoining the Karawanks range, would carry the vote for union with Austria or whether that majority wished to join a newly created South Slavic state. This was to a large extent a consequence of rising [[romantic nationalism]] under the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy and the idea of an autonomy of the "[[Slovene lands]]", referring to the early medieval Slavic principality of [[Carantania]], which had perished in the ninth century. A common state with other southern Slavic peoples seemed the most acceptable compromise toward fulfillment of nationalist strivings.

==Plebiscite==
[[File:Plakat ob plebiscitu Pojdimo vsi k glasovanju 1920.jpg|thumb|Poster in Slovene ("Let us go and vote! It is our sacred duty, our homeland is calling us. You are Carinthians, and you should remain Carinthians!"), featuring zones A and B]]
The [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain]] with the Republic of Austria, signed on 10 September 1919, should have determined the Austrian-Yugoslav border. It ascertained that some small parts of Carinthia—i.e. the [[Meža]] Valley ({{lang-de|Mießtal}}) with the town of [[Dravograd]] (''Unterdrauburg'') and the [[Jezersko, Slovenia|Jezersko]] (''Seeland'') municipal area—should be incorporated into the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, while the fate of wider southeastern Carinthia area down to the Klagenfurt basin was to be determined by a plebiscite.

Wanting to resolve the conflict peacefully, the Allied victors in World War I divided southeastern Carinthia into two zones, "A" in the south and "B" in the north. A two-stage referendum was to be held to determine annexation by either Austria or the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in the smaller Zone B only if a majority of the people in Zone A would have voted for Yugoslavia. The population of Zone A was predominantly Slovene-speaking: according to the pre-war Austrian census of 1910, people in these municipalities who used Slovene as their primary language represented nearly 70% of the population; while the number of ethnic Slovenes was probably higher. German speakers were concentrated in the town of [[Völkermarkt]] and certain smaller localities, especially around [[Bleiburg]] ({{lang-sl|Pliberk}}) and [[Ferlach]] (''Borovlje'').

Before the plebiscite, both sides waged intensive propaganda campaigns. Austrian propaganda emphasized the economic benefits of maintaining the unity of the Klagenfurt Basin and appealed to feelings of Carinthian unity and brotherhood between the Slovene- and German-speaking peoples of Carinthia. Conducted in the Slovene [[Carinthian dialect group|Carinthian dialect]], Austrian propaganda promised that the Slovene language and national identity would be treated as equal to the German in Austria, officially confirmed by the Carinthia ''Landtag'' assembly two weeks before the plebisicite was held. It nevertheless also had an anti-Yugoslav tendency, picturing the conditions in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes as chaotic. Yugoslav propaganda almost exclusively used arguments emphasizing Slovene national awareness. It took an aggressive [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] view from the beginning and turned to economic issues only in the last few weeks before the plebiscite. The campaigners were not capable of using the political instability of the young Austrian republic and its then unenviable position in the international community for advantage.

Despite the six-months term determined by the Treaty of Saint-Germain, the referendum was not held in Zone A until October 10, 1920. In addition to changing the date of the plebiscite, other terms of the Treaty of Saint-Germain allegedly were ignored or changed: an Austrian representative was accepted into the commission, and the plebiscite commission changed rules by not allowing the Yugoslav military to control the border between Zones A and B on 8 June 1920. Instead the Yugoslav army had to withdraw from Zone A in accord with the decision of the plebiscite commission on 18 September 1920. Changes may also have been made in electoral registers which allowed people from northern Zone B voting in Zone A, backing the Austrian side. In the following decades both sides would continue to interpret and instrumentalize the plebiscite's circumstances in their own way.

==Results==
The outcome of the plebiscite held on 10 October, was 22,025 votes (59.1% of the total cast) in favor of adhesion to Austria and 15,279 (40.9%) in favor of annexation by the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. Assumed that the whole German-speaking minority had voted for Austria, also every second Carinthian Slovene had decided to remain with the Republic. While a majority in the remote Alpine villages on the slopes of the Karawanks range voted for Yugoslavia, the inhabitants of the densely settled Klagenfurt Basin were motivated by their evolved social and cultural, not least economic ties to the central Carinthian region.

After the Austrian option had gained a majority of votes in predominantly Slovene Zone A, the second stage of the referendum in northern Zone B, populated chiefly by German speakers, was not carried out. Another Yugoslav foray was fiercely rejected by the Entente powers. The Carinthian Plebiscite region was placed under Austrian administration on 18 November 1920 and declared part of the sovereign Austrian Republic on November 22. Up to today, October 10 is a public [[holiday]] in the [[Carinthia (state)|State of Carinthia]].

The plebiscite ultimately determined the border between Austria and the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes. The border remained unchanged after [[World War II]], even as the Kingdom of Yugoslavia gave way to [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], though at the end of the war [[Yugoslav Partisans]] again briefly occupied the area, including the capital city of Klagenfurt. Since the disintegration of Yugoslavia, the border has separated Austria and [[Slovenia]].

'''Edward William Soja''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|oʊ|dʒ|ə}}; 1940–2015) was a self-described "urbanist,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1360481032000157478|title=Writing the city spatially | doi=10.1080/1360481032000157478 | volume=7|issue=3|journal=City|pages=269–280}}&lt;/ref&gt; a noted [[postmodern]] [[political geography|political geographer]] and [[urban theorist]] on the planning faculty at [[UCLA]], where he was Distinguished Professor of Urban Planning, and the [[London School of Economics]]. He had a Ph.D. from [[Syracuse University]]. His early research focused on planning in [[Kenya]], but Soja came to be known as the world's leading spatial theorist with a distinguished career writing on spatial formations and social justice.

In 2015 he was awarded the [[Vautrin Lud Prize]], the highest honor for a geographer and often called the [[Nobel Prize]] in the field of geography.

In addition to his readings of American feminist cultural theorist [[bell hooks]] (b. 1952), and French intellectual [[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984), Soja's greatest contribution to spatial theory and the field of cultural geography is his use of the work of French Marxist urban sociologist [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1901–1991), author of ''The Production of Space'' (1974). Soja updated Lefebvre's concept of the spatial triad with his own concept of spatial trialectics which includes thirdspace, or spaces that are ''both real and imagined''.

Soja focuses his critical postmodern analysis of space and society, or what he calls spatiality, on the people and places of [[Los Angeles]]. In 2010 the [[University of Minnesota Press]] released his work on [[spatial justice]],&lt;ref&gt;Soja Edward W., 2010, ''Seeking Spatial Justice'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press.&lt;/ref&gt; which was followed in 2014 with his "My Los Angeles" published by the [[University of California Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520281745|title=My Los Angeles|work=University of California Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published in the critical urban theory journal ''City: analysis of urban trends, culture, theory, policy, action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/1360481032000157478 | volume=7 | title=Writing the city spatially1 | journal=City | pages=269–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soja collaborated on research and writing with, most notably, [[Allen J. Scott]] ([[UCLA]]), [[Michael Storper]] ([[UCLA]], [[London School of Economics]]), [[Fredric Jameson]] ([[Duke University]]), [[David Harvey (geographer)|David Harvey]] ([[Johns Hopkins]], [[CUNY]]), Kurt Iveson ([[University of Sydney]]), and various faculty in the departments of Urban Planning, Architecture, Policy Studies, and Geography at UCLA.

Soja served as the doctoral academic advisor to many leading scholars in the field of urban theory and geography including Professor Mustafa Dikec (École d'Urbanisme de Paris),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latts.fr/mustafa-dikec|title=Professor Mustafa Dikec|work=latts.fr/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Walter J. Nicholls ([[University of California, Irvine]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://socialecology.uci.edu/faculty/wnicholl&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Mark Purcell ([[University of Washington]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb |url=http://urbdp.be.washington.edu/people/faculty/departmental/profiles/purcell.html |title=UW Urban Design and Planning - Departmental Faculty |work=washington.edu |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150407180335/http://urbdp.be.washington.edu/people/faculty/departmental/profiles/purcell.html |archivedate=2015-04-07 |df= }},&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Diane Davis ([[Harvard University]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/person/diane-davis/&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Juan Miguel Kanai ([[University of Sheffield]])&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/geography/staff/jaun_miguel_kanai&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. Stefano Bloch ([[University of Arizona]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://geography.arizona.edu/user/stefano-bloch&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thirdspace==
Soja developed a theory of Thirdspace in which "everything comes together… subjectivity and objectivity, the abstract and the concrete, the real and the imagined, the knowable and the unimaginable, the repetitive and the differential, structure and agency, mind and body, consciousness and the unconscious, the disciplined and the transdisciplinary, everyday life and unending history."&lt;ref name="SojaEdward"&gt;Soja, Edward W. ''Thirdspace''. Malden (Mass.): Blackwell, 1996. Print. p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; As he explains, "I define Thirdspace as an-Other way of understanding and acting to change the spatiality of human life, a distinct mode of critical spatial awareness that is appropriate to the new scope and significance being brought about in the rebalanced trialectics of spatiality–historicality–sociality."&lt;ref name="SojaEdward" /&gt; Soja constructs Thirdspace from the spatial trialectics established by [[Henri Lefebvre]] in ''[[The Production of Space]]'' and [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of [[heterotopia (space)|heterotopia]]. He synthesizes these theories with the work of postcolonial thinkers from [[Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak]] to [[bell hooks]], [[Edward Said]] to [[Homi K. Bhabha]].

Like Lefebvre, sometimes called a mystical Marxist, Soja demonstrates leanings towards a monadic mysticism in his Thirdspace. He formulates Thirdspace by analogy with the [[Aleph]], a concept of spatial infinity developed by [[Jorge Luis Borges]].&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. Thirdspace. Malden (Mass.): Blackwell, 1996. Print. p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdspace is a radically inclusive concept that encompasses epistemology, ontology, and historicity in continuous movement beyond dualisms and toward "an-Other": as Soja explains, "thirding produces what might best be called a cumulative trialectics that is radically open to additional otherness, to a continuing expansion of spatial knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Soja, Edward W. Thirdspace. Malden (Mass.): Blackwell, 1996. Print. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Thirdspace is a transcendent concept that is constantly expanding to include "an-Other," thus enabling the contestation and re-negotiation of boundaries and cultural identity. Soja here closely resembles [[Homi K. Bhabha]]'s [[Third Space Theory]], in which "all forms of culture are continually in a process of [[hybridity]]," that "displaces the histories that constitute it, and sets up new structures of authority, new political initiatives… The process of cultural hybridity gives rise to something different, something new and unrecognizable, a new area of negotiation of meaning and representation."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, Jonathan. "The Third Space. Interview with Homi Bhabha." Identity: Community, Culture, Difference. London: Lawrence &amp; Wishart, 1998. Print. P. 211 http://www.wsp-kultur.uni-bremen.de/summerschool/download%20ss%202006/The%20Third%20Space.%20Interview%20with%20Homi%20Bhabha.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visions for Los Angeles==
Soja introduced six visions for the City of Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opa-a2a.org/dissensus/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/soja_edward_w_six_discourses_on_the_postmetropolis.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These are the following:

*'''Flexicity''': Deindustrialization has been occurring alongside a potent reindustrialization process built not just on high technology. 
*'''Cosmopolis''': The primacy of globalization. Globalization of culture, labor and capital. Reworlds the city. 
*'''Exopolis''': The city that no longer conveys the traditional qualities of cityness. No cityness about Los Angeles. Growth of the outer city and city edges. More urban life. 
*'''Metropolarities''': Increasing social inequalities, widening income gaps, new kinds of social polarization and satisfaction that fit uncomfortably within traditional dualisms based on class or race, as well as conventional. New underclass debate. 
*'''Carcereal Archipelagos''': A fortified city with bulging prisons. The City of Quartz. More surveillance. 
*'''Simcity''': A place where simulations of a presumably real world increasingly capture and activate our urban imaginary and infiltrate everything urban life. An electronic generation of hyperreality.

'''Eniro.se''' is a local Swedish search portal offering [[telephone directory]], websearch and maps for Sweden. In addition to this Eniro offers a [[news aggregator]], shopping services, [[Video search engine|video search]], [[image search]] and job search. Its biggest competitor is [[Hitta.se]] who offer similar services.

It was launched in May 2003 when various Swedish web services owned by Eniro, including telephone directory, maps and the search engine [[Evreka]], where merged into one portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2003/?location=http%3a%2f%2fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2firxml%2frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=113211 |title=Eniro lanserar Sveriges främsta söktjänst - eniro.se |publisher=Eniro AB |date=May 15, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026211718/http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2003/?location=http%3A%2F%2Fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2Firxml%2Frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=113211 |archivedate=2007-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Eniro bought {{Interlanguage link multi|Gula Tidningen|sv}} in 2004 and its web service, "Köp &amp; Sälj", was soon integrated into Eniro.se. A jobfinding service was also added in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dagensmedia.se/mallar/dagensmedia_mall.asp?version=28780 |title=Eniro startar jobbsök i kampen om surfarna |date=May 17, 2004 |publisher=Dagens Media |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041213204934/http://www.dagensmedia.se/mallar/dagensmedia_mall.asp?version=28780 |archivedate=2004-12-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review service connected to the Yellow Pages, where users could give reviews of the listed companies, was added in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dagensmedia.se/mallar/dagensmedia_mall.asp?version=67335 |title=Eniro låter besökarna tycka till om företag på Gula Sidorna |date=March 1, 2006 |publisher=Dagens Media }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontpage was revamped in May 2008 with the launch of ''Supersök'' ("Super Search"). This shows search results for the business directory, residential directory, maps, images, videos and news integrated into one page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2008/?location=http%3a%2f%2fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2firxml%2frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=167206 |title=Supersök och få en bättre översikt |publisher=Eniro AB |date=May 22, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209220318/http://eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2008/?location=http%3A%2F%2Fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2Firxml%2Frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=167206 |archivedate=2010-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.idg.se/2.1085/1.165269 |title=Eniro smyglanserar supersök|publisher=IDG.se|date=May 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maps==
Initially, Eniro's map service only offered road maps. Satellite images where added in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2006/?location=http%3a%2f%2fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2firxml%2frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=129355 |title=Se Sverige från gåsryggen - flygfoton över hela landet |publisher=Eniro AB |date=March 21, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526053921/http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2006/?location=http%3A%2F%2Fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2Firxml%2Frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=129355 |archivedate=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution of the aerial photographs provided on Eniro.se is higher than the satellite images provided by international map services such as [[Google Maps]].

In November 2007, Eniro added "Utsikt" to their map service. This function provides photos of cities taken from a 45 degree angle from four directions. The resolution is roughly 0.15 metres per pixel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2007/?location=http%3a%2f%2fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2firxml%2frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=156174 |title=Bättre utsikt på eniro.se med 45-graders flygfoton |publisher=Eniro AB |date=November 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209225916/http://eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2007/?location=http%3A%2F%2Fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2Firxml%2Frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=156174 |archivedate=2010-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, only the three major metropolitan areas were available, but more cities were added during 2008. From June 2008, Eniro claims to cover 33 cities with the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2008/?location=http%3a%2f%2fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2firxml%2frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=167775 |title=Nu ger eniro.se bättre utsikt över 33 städer |publisher=Eniro AB |date=June 2, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209214505/http://eniro.com/sv/Press/Pressmeddelanden/2008/?location=http%3A%2F%2Fse.yhp.waymaker.net%2Firxml%2Frelxml.asp&amp;wayid=167775 |archivedate=2010-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Fleet Telematics System''' ('''FTS''') allows the information exchange between a [[commercial vehicle]] [[Fleet vehicle|fleet]] and their central authority, i.e., the dispatching office. A FTS typically consists of mobile Vehicle Systems (VS) and a stationary Fleet Communication System (FCS). The FCS may be a stand alone application maintained by the motor carrier or an internet service running by the supplier of the system. The FCS usually includes a database in which all vehicle positions and messages are stored.

[[Geographic information system|Digital maps]] are often included which allow visualization of vehicle positions and traces. Communication with the FCS is realized by [[Trunked radio system|trunked radio]], [[Cell phone|cellular]], or [[satellite communication]]. Positioning of vehicles is usually realized
by [[Global Navigation Satellite System|satellite positioning systems]] and/or [[dead reckoning]] using [[gyroscope]] and [[odometer]].

Usually, the VS is equipped with a simple input device allowing drivers to send predefined status messages. Drivers may add simple content, e.g., numeric values, but usually cannot enter arbitrary text. Besides the messages sent by drivers, some VS can also automatically submit messages, e.g., the vehicle’s position, data from sensors in the [[cargo]] body, or vehicle data from the [[CAN-bus]].

In 2002, major European commercial vehicle manufacturers, namely
[[Daimler Chrysler]], [[MAN SE|MAN AG]], [[Scania_(company)|Scania]], [[DAF Trucks|DAF]], [[IVECO]], [[Volvo]], and [[Renault]], agreed to give third parties access to vehicle data using the [[Controller–area network|CAN-bus]] as a connection. The Fleet Management Standard (FMS) is an [[open standard]] allowing, dependent on the vehicle equipment, access to vehicle data such as fuel consumption, engine data, or vehicle weight.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5557">The '''geology of [[Ukraine]]''' is the regional study of rocks, minerals, tectonics, natural resources and groundwater in the country. The oldest rocks in the region are part of the Ukrainian Shield and formed more than 2.5 billion years ago in the [[Archean]] eon of the [[Precambrian]]. Extensive tectonic evolution and numerous [[orogeny]] mountain building events fractured the crust into numerous block, horsts, grabens and depressions and Ukraine was intermittently flooded as the crust downwarped during much of the [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and early [[Cenozoic]], before the formation of the Alps and Carpathians defined much of its current topography and tectonics. Ukraine was impacted by the Pleistocene glaciations within the last several hundred thousand years. The country has numerous metal deposits as well as minerals, building stone and high-quality industrial sands. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=761-766}}&lt;/ref &gt;

==Stratigraphy, Tectonics &amp; Geologic History==
In the Early Archean, the oldest granite layer that now form the [[Precambrian]] crystalline basement rock of Ukraine began to form. These rocks, including [[plagioclase]] granite, [[basalt]] and [[gneiss]], was reworked into [[granulite]] belts due to tectonic evolution in the Archean. The Late Archean was marked by the deposition of ancient [[greywacke]], [[charnockite]] and basic eruptions from numerous volcanoes and fumaroles. 

===Proterozoic (1.5 billion-541 million years ago)===
Tectonic forces had fractured the Archean basement rock into sutures, blocks, troughs and depressions by the start of the [[Proterozoic]], although new folding began. The evolution of the rock units in the Proterozoic produced the stable [[Ukrainian Shield]], which was broken up further into [[horst and graben]] formations by the [[Baikalian orogeny]]. During the [[Riphean (stage)|Riphean]] period, a delineation of Eastern European stratigraphy, the [[Dnieper-Donets Rift]] began to form. 

===Paleozoic (541-251 million years ago)===
In the [[Paleozoic]], the Volyn-Podolia region and southern Ukraine subsided and were flooded by a [[marine transgression]], which immersed the region until the [[Devonian]] (or until the [[Permian]] further south). Ukraine experienced volcanic activity related to the [[Caledonian orogeny]]. The [[Lvov-Volyn Depression]] developed in the [[Volyn-Podolia Platform]] during the Devonian and [[Carboniferous]]. 

Further tectonic changes came about with the [[Hercynian orogeny]], beginning the formation of the [[Prichernomorian Depression]]. Basalt and alkaline volcanic rocks intruded the Dnieper-Donets rift zone during this time and the Dnieper-Donets Depression and Donets Basin formed. These [[syncline]] structures were flooded by the sea in the [[Middle Devonian]]. 

In the late Paleozoic, from the Permian into the [[Triassic]], dry land continental conditions returned.
 
===Mesozoic (251-66 million years ago)===
Much of the Ukrainian Shield was flooded during the [[Cimmerian orogeny]] as a large [[anticline]] formed. The crust downwarped in the Dnieper-Donets Depression and Donets Basin and deeper seas penetrated further inland during the [[Jurassic]]. Faults formed as the [[Alps]] began to build, together with the [[Carpathian Mountains]], separating much of Ukraine from the Precarpathian Foredeep and Transcarpathian Depression. The central Ukrainian Shield was flooded during the [[Cretaceous]].

===Cenozoic (66 million years ago-present)===
In the [[Cenozoic]] an overall uplift of the region led to the retreat of seas to the north, with the exception of a transgression during the [[Eocene]]. Marine basins finally retreated entirely in the [[Oligocene]]. A meganticlinorium had formed in Crimea by the end of the Oligocene. During the [[Pleistocene]] in the recent geologic past, much of Ukraine was covered with glaciers with the exception of areas around the Sea of Azov and Black Sea which were flooded during the time period. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=765}}

==Natural resource geology==
The Proterozoic Ukrainian Shield hosts iron ore deposits in the Krivorozhsky Basin, while iron ore is also found in the Neogene Prichernomorian Depression. Manganese ores are known from Oligocene rocks in the south slope of the Ukrainian shield and titanium is found in magmatic and alluvial deposits. Tungsten, molybdenum, vanadium, nickel, cobalt and chromium occur on the shield as well. 
Mercury deposits in the Donets Basin are hosted in Carboniferous sandstones as well as in the Transcarpathian Trough and Crimea (lead-zinc-gold mineralization are also found, while copper is found in Permian rocks in the Donets Basin). 

Geologists have discovered oil and gas deposits in the Neogene of the Precarpathian Foredeep, the Paleozoic of the Dnieper-Donets Depression and in the Oligocene of the Prichernomorian Depression. Large coal reserves are situated in the Dnieper Lignite Basin, Donets Basin and Lvov-Volyn Depression. Additionally, Ukraine has combustible black shale and peat deposits. 

The construction industry often quarries Precambrian granite from the Ukraine Shield, while chemical industries extract rock salt, talc, mica, feldspar and glass-grade sand. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=765-766}}

The '''Hispaniolan pine forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical coniferous forests|subtropical coniferous forest]] [[ecoregion]] found on the [[Caribbean]] island of [[Hispaniola]], which is shared by [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]. The ecoregion covers {{convert|11600|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 15% of the island. It lies at elevations greater than {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in the mountains of Hispaniola, extending from the [[Cordillera Central, Dominican Republic|Cordillera Central]] of the Dominican Republic and into the [[Massif du Nord]] of Haiti. It is surrounded at lower elevations by the [[Hispaniolan moist forests]] and [[Hispaniolan dry forests]] ecoregions, which cover the remainder of the island.  Annual rainfall is {{convert|1000|-|2000|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="WWF" /&gt;

==Flora==
The natural vegetation of the region consists primarily of stands of pino criollo (''[[Hispaniolan Pine|Pinus occidentalis]]''). Pines are mixed with other conifers, including sabina (''[[Juniperus gracilior]]'') and ''[[Podocarpus aristulatus]]'' (syn. ''P. buchii''). Below {{convert|2100|m|ft|abbr=on}}, pine forests are found on [[Laterite|lateritic soils]] and are interspersed with areas of [[Hispaniolan moist forests|wet montane forest]].  Important broad-leaved species are ''[[Garrya fadyenii]]'' and ''[[Vaccinium cubense]]'' near [[Constanza, Dominican Republic|Constanza]] and the [[Baoruco Mountain Range|Sierra de Bahoruco]], ''[[Rapanea ferruginea]]'' near [[Jarabacoa]] and [[San José de las Matas]], and ''[[Buddleja domingensis]]'' along the Cordillera Central. Plants of montane steppe ({{convert|2100|-|3175|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) include cara de hombre (''[[Lyonia (plant)|Lyonia]]'' spp.), abey (''[[Cojoba arborea]]''), yaya fina (''[[Oxandra]] [[Oxandra lanceolata|lanceolata]]''), pajón (''[[Danthonia]] [[Danthonia domingensis|domingensis]]''), [[Verbena officinalis|''Verbena officinalis'' var. ''officinalis'']], and ''[[Weinmannia]] [[Weinmannia pinnata|pinnata]]''.&lt;ref name="WWF"/&gt;

==Threats==
More than half of the ecoregion's area has been lost to clearing for [[agriculture]], [[pasture]], or [[Plantation#Forestry|plantations]] of exotic trees. The Haitian portion of the ecoregion is more deforested than the Dominican portion.&lt;ref name="WildWord"&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=nt0305|name=Hispaniolan pine forests|accessdate=2009-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cultivation of [[vegetable]]s in a British-type climate, the '''hungry gap''' is the gardeners' name for the period in [[spring (season)|spring]] when there is little or no fresh produce available from a [[vegetable garden]] or [[Allotment (gardening)|allotment]]. It usually starts when overwintered [[brassica]] vegetables such as [[brussels sprout]]s and winter [[cauliflower]]s and January King [[cabbage]]s "bolt" (i.e. run up to [[flowering|flower]]) as the days get warmer and longer, but sooner if a very hard frost kills these crops; and ends when the new season's first [[broad bean]]s are ready.

Means to bridge the gap or part of it include:
*Using stored food: but stored [[potato]]es sprout in store if kept too long in warm weather, and salted-away meat is used up or goes bad in store. See [[Lent#Origin]].
*Autumn-sown broad beans: this is a gamble with the weather, as they are killed in the ground when the ground freezes too deep.
*Heated [[greenhouse]], or [[Hotbed (gardening)|hotbed]]s, to start summer vegetable [[seedling]]s sooner.

==Other meanings==
One variety of [[kale]] is called "Hungry Gap" because it crops during this period: see [[Kale#Cultivars]]. It was introduced to UK agriculture in 1941.

An '''interstellar object''' is a body, other than a [[star]] or [[Substellar object|substar]], that is located in [[interstellar space]] and is not [[gravitationally bound]] to a star.  The term can also be applied to objects that are on an interstellar trajectory but are temporarily passing close to a star, such as certain [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s (including [[exocomet]]s&lt;ref name="Valtonen"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Valtonen| first = Mauri J.| author2 = Jia-Qing Zheng | author3 = Seppo Mikkola| title = Origin of oort cloud comets in the interstellar space| journal = Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy| volume = 54| issue = 1–3| pages = 37–48| date = March 1992| url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/g43v16167077453u/| doi = 10.1007/BF00049542| accessdate = 2008-12-30|bibcode = 1992CeMDA..54...37V }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Francis| first = Paul J.| date  = 2005-12-20| title = The Demographics of Long-Period Comets| journal = The Astrophysical Journal | volume = 635| issue  = 2| pages  = 1348–1361| doi  = 10.1086/497684| bibcode = 2005ApJ...635.1348F

Due to present observational difficulties, an interstellar object can usually only be detected if it passes through the [[Solar System]], where it can be distinguished by its strongly [[hyperbolic trajectory]], indicating that it is not gravitationally bound to the Sun.&lt;ref name=Francis/&gt;&lt;ref name="hyperbolics"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, gravitationally bound objects follow [[elliptic orbit]]s around the Sun, like most asteroids, comets, and objects in the [[Oort cloud]].

It is possible for objects orbiting a star to be ejected due to interaction with a third massive body, thereby becoming interstellar objects.  Such a process was initiated in early 1980s when [[C/1980 E1]], initially gravitationally bound to the Sun, passed near Jupiter and was accelerated sufficiently to reach escape velocity from the Solar System.  This changed its orbit from elliptical to hyperbolic and made it the most eccentric known object at the time, with an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 1.057.&lt;ref name="jpldata"&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is headed for interstellar space.

The first discovered, and to date only known, interstellar object is [[ʻOumuamua]] (1I/ʻOumuamua, previously called C/2017 U1 and A/2017 U1). The object has an orbital eccentricity of about 1.20. 

Recent research suggests that asteroid [[(514107) 2015 BZ509]] may be a former interstellar object, captured some 4.5 billion years ago, as evidenced by its co-orbital motion with Jupiter and its retrograde orbit around the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/05/asteroid-came-another-solar-system-and-it-s-here-stay|title=This asteroid came from another solar system—and it’s here to stay|publisher=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
With the first discovery of an interstellar object, the IAU has proposed a new series of small-body designations for interstellar objects, the ''I numbers,'' similar to the comet numbering system. The [[Minor Planet Center]] will assign the numbers.

A dim object was discovered on October 19, 2017 by the [[Pan-STARRS]] telescope, at an apparent magnitude of 20.

The lack of [[Coma (cometary)|cometary activity]] from ʻOumuamua suggests an origin from the inner regions of whatever stellar system it came from, losing all surface volatiles within the [[Frost line (astrophysics)|frost line]], much like the rocky asteroids, [[extinct comets]] and [[damocloids]] we know from our Solar System. This is only a suggestion, as ʻOumuamua might very well have lost all surface volatiles to eons of [[cosmic radiation]] exposure in interstellar space, developing a thick crust layer after it was expelled from its parent system. 

ʻOumuamua has an [[Orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 1.199, which is the highest eccentricity ever observed for any object in the Solar System by a wide margin.

In September 2018, astronomers described several possible home [[star system]]s from which 'Oumuamua, that was detected passing through the Solar System in October 2017, may have begun its interstellar journey.&lt;ref name="ARX-20180924"&gt;{{Cite arxiv |eprint = 1809.09009|last1 = Feng|first1 = Fabo|title = Plausible home stars of the interstellar object 'Oumuamua found in Gaia DR2|last2 = Jones|first2 = Hugh R.

In November 2018, Harvard astronomers reported that there should be hundreds of 'Oumuamua-size interstellar objects in the Solar System, based on calculated orbital characteristics, and presented several known examples, namely, [[2011 SP25]], [[2017 RR2]], [[2017 SV13]], and [[2018 TL6]].&lt;ref name=MNRAS-20181129"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Siraj |first1=Amir |last2=Loeb |first2=Abraham |title=Identifying Interstellar Objects Trapped in the Solar System through Their Orbital Parameters |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.09632.pdf |format=[[PDF]] |date=29 November 2018  |journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] |volume=000 |pages=1-5 |accessdate=1 December 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all orbiting the sun, but with unusual orbits, and are assumed to have been trapped at some occasion.

'''Jules Trousset''' (28 August 1842 in [[Moulidars]] (Charente) – 1905, Paris) was a 19th-century French encyclopedist, historian and geographer.

== Biography ==
Although he was a well known man in his time, very few things have survived on the life of Jules Trousset. A former teacher and director of publication, he was the author of popular books. He notably wrote the ''Atlas national'' and the ''Encyclopédie d’économie domestique'', both rewarded by [[Learned society|learned societies]]. A committed man, he founded ''Le Réveil républicain. Organe des Comités républicains du canton de Sceaux et de Villejuif'' and was mayor of [[Malakoff]] from 1893 to 1896.

== « Le Trousset » ==
His most famous work is the [[s:Nouveau dictionnaire encyclopédique universel illustré|''Nouveau dictionnaire encyclopédique universel illustré'']], or ''Répertoire des connaissances humaines'', nicknamed "le Trousset", published in Paris between 1885 and 1891, adorned with more than 3,000 engravings.

This work, which paid tribute to [[Pierre Larousse]] with whom he worked, tried to complete all knowledge. Trousset joined hundreds of foreign correspondents to his company. He sold the book by [[Subscription (finance)|subscription]], the buyers paying when all volumes had been received. Success was at the rendezvous.

'''Landscape ecology''' is the science of studying and improving relationships between ecological processes in the environment and particular ecosystems. This is done within a variety of landscape scales, development spatial patterns, and organizational levels of research and policy.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2006. Cross-disciplinarity, landscape ecology, and [[sustainability science]]. Landscape Ecology 21:1-4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wu-2007"&gt;Wu, J. and R. Hobbs (Eds). 2007. Key Topics in Landscape Ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J. 2008. Landscape ecology. In: S. E. Jorgensen (ed), Encyclopedia of Ecology. Elsevier, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a highly interdisciplinary field in [[systems science]], landscape ecology integrates [[biophysical]] and [[Analytic induction|analytical]] approaches with [[humanistic]] and [[holistic]] perspectives across the [[natural sciences]] and [[social sciences]].  Landscapes are spatially heterogeneous geographic areas characterized by diverse interacting patches or ecosystems, ranging from relatively natural terrestrial and aquatic systems such as forests, grasslands, and lakes to human-dominated environments including agricultural and urban settings.&lt;ref name="wu-2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"&gt;Turner, M.G., R. H. Gardner and R. V. O'Neill 2001.  Landscape Ecology in Theory and Practice.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. 1995.  Land Mosaics: The Ecology of Landscapes and Regions.  Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most salient characteristics of landscape ecology are its emphasis on the relationship among pattern, process and scale, and its focus on broad-scale ecological and environmental issues. These necessitate the coupling between biophysical and socioeconomic sciences.  Key research topics in landscape ecology include ecological flows in landscape mosaics, land use and land cover change, scaling, relating landscape pattern analysis with ecological processes, and landscape conservation and [[sustainability]].&lt;ref&gt;Wu &amp; Hobbs 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==

The German term ''Landschaftsökologie''–thus ''landscape ecology''–was coined by German [[Geography|geographer]] [[Carl Troll]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 1939. Luftbildplan und ökologische Bodenforschung (Aerial photography and ecological studies of the earth).  Zeitschrift der Gesellschaft für Erdkunde, Berlin: 241-298.&lt;/ref&gt;  He developed this terminology and many early concepts of landscape ecology as part of his early work, which consisted of applying aerial photograph interpretation to studies of interactions between environment and vegetation.

== Explanation ==
Heterogeneity is the measure of how parts of a landscape differ from one another.  Landscape ecology looks at how this spatial structure affects organism abundance at the landscape level, as well as the behavior and functioning of the landscape as a whole.  This includes studying the influence of pattern, or the internal order of a landscape, on process, or the continuous operation of functions of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, M.G.  1989.  Landscape ecology: the effect of pattern on process. Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics 20:171-197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscape ecology also includes geomorphology as applied to the design and architecture of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998"&gt;Allaby, M. 1998.  Oxford Dictionary of Ecology.  Oxford University Press, New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Geomorphology]] is the study of how geological formations are responsible for the structure of a landscape.

==History==

=== Evolution of theory ===
One central landscape ecology theory originated from [[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] &amp; [[Edward Osborne Wilson|Wilson's]] ''[[The Theory of Island Biogeography]]''.  This work considered the biodiversity on islands as the result of competing forces of colonization from a mainland stock and [[stochastic]] [[extinction]].  The concepts of [[island biogeography]] were generalized from physical islands to abstract patches of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] by Levins' [[metapopulation]] model (which can be applied e.g. to forest islands in the agricultural landscape&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;).  This generalization spurred the growth of landscape ecology by providing [[conservation biology|conservation biologists]] a new tool to assess how [[habitat fragmentation]] affects population viability.  Recent growth of landscape ecology owes much to the development of [[geographic information system]]s (GIS)&lt;ref name="sstein-2009"&gt;Steiniger, S., and Hay, G.J. 2009. Free and Open Source Geographic Information Tools for Landscape Ecology. Ecological Informatics 4(4): 183-195. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/jump-pilot/files/w_other_freegis_documents/articles/sstein_freegitools_ecoinf2009.pdf/download preprint]&lt;/ref&gt; and the availability of large-extent habitat data (e.g. [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] datasets).

=== Development as a discipline ===
Landscape ecology developed in [[Europe]] from historical planning on human-dominated landscapes.  Concepts from general ecology theory were integrated in [[North America]].{{when|date=May 2014}}  While general ecology theory and its sub-disciplines focused on the study of more homogenous, discrete community units organized in a hierarchical structure (typically as [[ecosystem]]s, [[population]]s, [[species]], and communities), landscape ecology built upon heterogeneity in space and time. It frequently included human-caused landscape changes in theory and application of concepts.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"&gt;Sanderson, J. and L. D. Harris (eds.).  2000.  Landscape Ecology: A Top-Down Approach.  Lewis Publishers, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1980, landscape ecology was a discrete, established discipline. It was marked by the organization of the [http://www.landscape-ecology.org/ International Association for Landscape Ecology] (IALE) in 1982.  Landmark book publications defined the scope and goals of the discipline, including Naveh and Lieberman&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"&gt;Naveh, Z. and A. Lieberman.  1984.  Landscape ecology: theory and application.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; and Forman and Godron.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron.  1986. Landscape Ecology.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"&gt;Ryszkowski, L. (ed.).  2002.  Landscape Ecology in Agroecosystems Management.  CRC Press, Boca Raton, Florida, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt; wrote that although study of "the ecology of spatial configuration at the human scale" was barely a decade old, there was strong potential for theory development and application of the conceptual framework.  Today, theory and application of landscape ecology continues to develop through a need for innovative applications in a changing landscape and environment.  Landscape ecology relies on advanced technologies such as remote sensing, GIS, and [[computer simulation|models]].  There has been associated development of powerful quantitative methods to examine the interactions of patterns and processes.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  An example would be determining the amount of [[carbon cycle|carbon]] present in the [[soil]] based on landform over a landscape, derived from GIS maps, [[vegetation]] types, and [[rainfall]] data for a region.

=== Definitions/conceptions of landscape ecology ===
Nowadays, at least six different conceptions of landscape ecology can be identified: one group tending toward the more disciplinary concept of [[ecology]] (subdiscipline of [[biology]]; in conceptions 2, 3, and 4) and another group—characterized by the [[interdisciplinary]] study of relations between human societies and their environment—inclined toward the [[Integrated geography|integrated]] view of [[geography]] (in conceptions 1, 5, and 6):&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: ''What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions''. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751. All the following quotations and descriptions come from this source.&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Interdisciplinary scientific analysis of subjectively defined landscape units'' (e.g. [[Ernst Neef|Neef]] School&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Gotha: Haack; Haase, G. 1990: Approaches to, and methods of landscape diagnosis as a basis of landscape planning and landscape management. Ekológia 9(1): 31-44.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscapes are defined in terms of uniformity in land use. Landscape ecology explores the landscape's natural potential in terms of functional utility for human societies. To analyse this potential, it is necessary to draw on several natural sciences.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape scale'' (e.g. Forman &amp; Godron&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10): 733-740; Forman, R.T.T. &amp; Godron, M. 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;):  'Landscape' is defined as a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems (woods, meadows, marshes, villages, etc.) that is repeated in similar form throughout.  It is explicitly stated that landscapes are areas at a kilometres wide ''human scale'' of perception, modification, etc.  Landscape ecology describes and explains the landscapes' characteristic patterns of ecosystems and investigates the flux of energy, mineral nutrients, and species among their component ecosystems, providing important knowledge for addressing land-use issues.
# ''Organism-centred, multi-scale topological ecology'' (e.g. [[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. &amp; Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2): 87-96; Wiens, J. A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. &amp; Gardner, R.H. (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: Issues and applications. Springer, NY: 371-383.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Explicitly rejecting views expounded by Troll, Zonneveld, Naveh, Forman &amp; Godron, etc., landscape and landscape ecology are defined independently of human perceptions, interests, and modifications of nature. 'Landscape' is defined – regardless of scale – as the 'template' on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes.  Not humans, but rather the respective species being studied is the point of reference for what constitutes a landscape.
# ''Topological ecology at the landscape level of biological organisation'' (e.g. Urban et al.&lt;ref&gt;Urban, D.L.; O'Neill, R.V. &amp; Shugart, H.H., Jr. 1987: Landscape ecology. A hierarchical perspective can help scientists understand spatial patterns. BioScience 37(2): 119-127.&lt;/ref&gt;):  On the basis of ecological hierarchy theory, it is presupposed that nature is working at multiple scales and has different levels of organisation which are part of a rate-structured, nested hierarchy. Specifically, it is claimed that, above the ecosystem level, a landscape level exists which is generated and identifiable by high interaction intensity between ecosystems, a specific interaction frequency and, typically, a corresponding spatial scale. Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that focuses on the influence exerted by spatial and temporal patterns on the organisation of, and interaction among, functionally integrated multispecies ecosystems.

A conceptual introduction.

SPB, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as an interdisciplinary super-science that explores the relationship between human societies and their specific environment, making use of not only various natural sciences, but also social sciences and humanities. This conception is grounded in the assumption that social systems are linked to their specific ambient ecological system in such a way that both systems together form a co-evolutionary, self-organising unity called 'landscape'. Societies' cultural, social and economic dimensions are regarded as an integral part of the global ecological hierarchy, and landscapes are claimed to be the manifest systems of the 'Total Human Ecosystem' (Naveh) which encompasses both the physical ('geospheric') and mental ('noospheric') spheres.
# ''Ecology guided by cultural meanings of lifeworldly landscapes'' (frequently pursued in practice&lt;ref&gt;However, not always under the designation 'landscape ecology', but as part of landscape stewardship, landscape architecture and, first and foremost, environmental or urban and landscape planning.&lt;/ref&gt; but not defined, but see, e.g., Hard;&lt;ref&gt;Hard, G. 1973: Die Geographie. Eine wissenschaftstheoretische Einführung. deGruyter, Berlin: 92-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Trepl&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T.; Trepl, L. &amp; Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research 2012, online first, DOI:10.1080/01426397.2011.640751.&lt;/ref&gt;):  Landscape ecology is defined as ecology that is guided by an external aim, namely, to maintain and develop [[lifeworld]]ly [[landscapes]]. It provides the ecological knowledge necessary to achieve these goals. It investigates how to sustain and develop those populations and ecosystems which (i) are the material 'vehicles' of lifeworldly, aesthetic and symbolic landscapes and, at the same time, (ii) meet societies' functional requirements, including provisioning, regulating, and supporting [[ecosystem services]]. Thus landscape ecology is concerned mainly with the populations and ecosystems which have resulted from traditional, regionally specific forms of land use.

== Relationship to ecological theory ==
Some research programmes of landscape ecology theory, namely those standing in the European tradition, may be slightly outside of the "classical and preferred domain of scientific disciplines" because of the large, heterogeneous areas of study. However, general [[ecology theory]] is central to landscape ecology theory in many aspects.  Landscape ecology consists of four main principles: the development and dynamics of spatial heterogeneity, interactions and exchanges across heterogeneous landscapes, influences of spatial heterogeneity on biotic and [[abiotic]] processes, and the management of spatial heterogeneity.  The main difference from traditional ecological studies, which frequently assume that systems are spatially homogenous, is the consideration of [[spatial pattern]]s.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"&gt;Turner, M.G. and R. H. Gardner (eds.).  1991.  Quantitative Methods in Landscape Ecology.  Springer-Verlag, New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Important terms ==
Landscape ecology not only created new terms, but also incorporated existing ecological terms in new ways.  Many of the terms used in landscape ecology are as interconnected and interrelated as the discipline itself.

=== Landscape ===
{{Main|Landscape}}

Certainly, 'landscape' is a central concept in landscape ecology. It is, however, defined in quite different ways. For example:&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, T., Trepl, L. and V. Vicenzotti, V. 2012: What is landscape ecology? An analysis and evaluation of six different conceptions. Landscape Research online first.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Carl Troll]] conceives of landscape not as a mental construct but as an objectively given 'organic entity', a ''harmonic individuum of space''.&lt;ref&gt;Troll, C. 2007: The geographic landscape and its investigation. In: Wiens, J.A., Moss, M.R., Turner, M.G. &amp; Mladenoff, D.J. (eds): Foundation papers in landscape ecology. New York, Columbia University Press:71–101 [First published as: Troll, C. 1950: Die geographische Landschaft und ihre Erforschung. Studium Generale 3(4/5):163–181].&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Ernst Neef]]&lt;ref&gt;Neef, E. 1967: Die theoretischen Grundlagen der Landschaftslehre. Haack, Gotha; cf. Haase, G. and H. Richter 1983: Current trends in landscape research. GeoJournal 7(2):107–119.&lt;/ref&gt; defines landscapes as sections within the uninterrupted earth-wide interconnection of geofactors which are defined as such on the basis of their uniformity in terms of a specific land use, and are thus defined in an anthropocentric and relativistic way.
According to [[Richard Forman]] and [[Michael Godron]],&lt;ref&gt;Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron, M. 1981: Patches and structural components for a landscape ecology. BioScience 31(10):733–740; Forman, R.T.T. and M. Godron 1986: Landscape ecology. Wiley, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; a landscape is a heterogeneous land area composed of a cluster of interacting ecosystems that is repeated in similar form throughout, whereby they list woods, meadows, marshes and villages as examples of a landscape's ecosystems, and state that a landscape is an area at least a few kilometres wide. 
[[John A. Wiens]]&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. and B.T. Milne, B.T. 1989: Scaling of 'landscapes' in landscape ecology, or, landscape ecology from the beetle's perspective. Landscape Ecology 3(2):87–96; Wiens, J.A.: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds) 1999: Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383.&lt;/ref&gt; opposes the traditional view expounded by [[Carl Troll]], Isaak S. Zonneveld, Zev Naveh, Richard T. T. Forman/Michel Godron and others that landscapes are arenas in which humans interact with their environments on a kilometre-wide scale; instead, he defines 'landscape'—regardless of scale—as "the template on which spatial patterns influence ecological processes".&lt;ref&gt;Wiens, J.A. 1999: The science and practice of landscape ecology. In: Klopatek, J.M. and R.H. Gardner (eds): Landscape ecological analyses: issues and applications. Springer, New York:371–383; cf. Wiens, J.A. 2005: ''Toward a unified landscape ecology''. In: Wiens, J.A. and M.R. Moss (eds): Issues and perspectives in landscape ecology. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge:365–373.&lt;/ref&gt;
Some define 'landscape' as an area containing two or more [[ecosystem]]s in close proximity.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt;

=== Scale and heterogeneity (incorporating composition, structure, and function) ===
{{Main|Scale (spatial)|Heterogeneity}}

A main concept in landscape ecology is ''scale''. Scale represents the real world as translated onto a map, relating distance on a map image and the corresponding distance on earth.&lt;ref&gt;Malczewski, J. 1999. GIS and Multicriteria Decision Analysis. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Scale is also the spatial or temporal measure of an object or a process,&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; or amount of spatial resolution.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Components of scale include composition, structure, and function, which are all important ecological concepts. Applied to landscape ecology, ''composition'' refers to the number of patch types (see below) represented on a landscape and their relative abundance. For example, the amount of [[forest]] or [[wetland]], the length of forest edge, or the density of [[road]]s can be aspects of landscape composition. ''Structure'' is determined by the composition, the configuration, and the proportion of different patches across the landscape, while ''function'' refers to how each element in the landscape interacts based on its life cycle events.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt; ''Pattern'' is the term for the contents and internal order of a heterogeneous area of land.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986" /&gt;

A landscape with structure and pattern implies that it has spatial ''heterogeneity'', or the uneven distribution of objects across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Heterogeneity is a key element of landscape ecology that separates this discipline from other branches of ecology. Landscape heterogeneity is able to quantify with agent-based methods as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wirth|first=E.|last2=Szabó|first2=Gy.|last3=Czinkóczky|first3=A.|date=2016-06-07|title=MEASURE OF LANDSCAPE HETEROGENEITY BY AGENT-BASED METHODOLOGY|url=http://www.isprs-ann-photogramm-remote-sens-spatial-inf-sci.net/III-8/145/2016/|journal=ISPRS Annals of Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences|language=English|volume=III-8|pages=145–151|doi=10.5194/isprs-annals-iii-8-145-2016|issn=2194-9042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patch and mosaic===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Patch]] --&gt;

{{See also|Patch dynamics}}
''Patch'', a term fundamental to landscape ecology, is defined as a relatively homogeneous area that differs from its surroundings.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Patches are the basic unit of the landscape that change and fluctuate, a process called ''patch dynamics''.  Patches have a definite shape and spatial configuration, and can be described compositionally by internal variables such as number of trees, number of tree species, height of trees, or other similar measurements.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

''Matrix'' is the "background ecological system" of a landscape with a high degree of [[Landscape connectivity|connectivity]].  ''Connectivity'' is the measure of how connected or spatially continuous a corridor, network, or matrix is.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  For example, a forested landscape (matrix) with fewer gaps in forest cover (open patches) will have higher connectivity.  ''Corridors'' have important functions as strips of a particular type of landscape differing from adjacent land on both sides.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  A ''network'' is an interconnected system of corridors while ''mosaic'' describes the pattern of patches, corridors, and matrix that form a landscape in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;

=== Boundary and edge ===
{{Main|Edge effect}}

Landscape patches have a boundary between them which can be defined or fuzzy.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000" /&gt; The zone composed of the edges of adjacent ecosystems is the ''boundary''.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; ''Edge'' means the portion of an ecosystem near its perimeter, where influences of the adjacent patches can cause an environmental difference between the interior of the patch and its edge. This edge effect includes a distinctive species composition or abundance.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; For example, when a landscape is a mosaic of perceptibly different types, such as a forest adjacent to a [[grassland]], the edge is the location where the two types adjoin. In a continuous landscape, such as a forest giving way to open woodland, the exact edge location is fuzzy and is sometimes determined by a local gradient exceeding a threshold, such as the point where the tree cover falls below thirty-five percent.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991" /&gt;

=== Ecotones, ecoclines, and ecotopes ===
{{Main|Ecotone|Ecocline|Ecotype}}

A type of boundary is the ''ecotone'', or the transitional zone between two communities.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; Ecotones can arise naturally, such as a [[Shore|lakeshore]], or can be human-created, such as a cleared [[agricultural field]] from a forest.&lt;ref name="Allaby-1998" /&gt; The ecotonal community retains characteristics of each bordering community and often contains species not found in the adjacent communities. Classic examples of ecotones include fencerows, forest to marshlands transitions, forest to grassland transitions, or land-water interfaces such as [[riparian zone]]s in forests. Characteristics of ecotones include [[vegetational sharpness]], [[physiognomic]] change, occurrence of a spatial community mosaic, many [[exotic species]], [[ecotonal species]], [[spatial mass effect]], and [[Biodiversity|species richness]] higher or lower than either side of the ecotone.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"&gt;Walker, S., W. J. Barstow, J. B. Steel, G. L. Rapson, B. Smith, W. M. King, and Y. H. Cottam. 2003. Properties of ecotones: evidence from five ecotones objectively determined from a coastal vegetation gradient. Journal of Vegetation Science 14:579-590.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''[[wikt:ecocline|ecocline]]'' is another type of landscape boundary, but it is a gradual and continuous change in environmental conditions of an ecosystem or community. Ecoclines help explain the distribution and diversity of organisms within a landscape because certain organisms survive better under certain conditions, which change along the ecocline. They contain heterogeneous communities which are considered more environmentally stable than those of ecotones.&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"&gt;Attrill, M.J. and S.D. Rundle. 2002. Ecotone or ecocline: ecological boundaries in estuaries. Estuarine, Coastal, and Shelf Science 55:929-936.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''ecotope'' is a spatial term representing the smallest ecologically distinct unit in mapping and classification of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Relatively homogeneous, they are spatially explicit landscape units used to stratify landscapes into ecologically distinct features. They are useful for the measurement and mapping of landscape structure, function, and change over time, and to examine the effects of disturbance and fragmentation.

=== Disturbance and fragmentation ===
{{Main|Disturbance (ecology)|Habitat fragmentation}}

''Disturbance'' is an event that significantly alters the pattern of variation in the structure or function of a system. ''Fragmentation'' is the breaking up of a habitat, ecosystem, or land-use type into smaller parcels.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995" /&gt; Disturbance is generally considered a natural process. Fragmentation causes land transformation, an important process in landscapes as development occurs.

An important consequence of repeated, random clearing (whether by natural disturbance or human activity) is that contiguous cover can break down into isolated patches. This happens when the area cleared exceed a critical level, which means that landscapes exhibit two phases: connected and disconnected.&lt;ref name="Green-2006"&gt;Green, D.G., Klomp, N.I., Rimmington, G.R. and Sadedin, S. 2006. Complexity in Landscape Ecology, Springer, Amsterdam. {{cite web |url=http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619025437/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~dgreen/books/springer/ |archivedate=2008-06-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theory ==
Landscape ecology theory stresses the role of human impacts on landscape structures and functions. It also proposes ways for restoring degraded landscapes.&lt;ref name="Naveh-1984"/&gt; Landscape ecology explicitly includes humans as entities that cause functional changes on the landscape.&lt;ref name="Sanderson-2000"/&gt; Landscape ecology theory includes the landscape stability principle, which emphasizes the importance of landscape structural heterogeneity in developing resistance to disturbances, [[regeneration (ecology)|recovery from disturbances]], and promoting total system stability.&lt;ref name="Forman-1986"/&gt; This principle is a major contribution to general ecological theories which highlight the importance of relationships among the various components of the landscape. Integrity of landscape components helps maintain resistance to external threats, including development and land transformation by human activity.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt; Analysis of land use change has included a strongly geographical approach which has led to the acceptance of the idea of multifunctional properties of landscapes.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt; There are still calls for a more unified theory of landscape ecology due to differences in professional opinion among ecologists and its interdisciplinary approach (Bastian 2001).

An important related theory is hierarchy theory, which refers to how systems of discrete functional elements operate when linked at two or more scales.  For example, a forested landscape might be hierarchically composed of [[drainage basin]]s, which in turn are composed of local ecosystems, which are in turn composed of individual trees and gaps.&lt;ref name="Forman-1995"/&gt;  Recent theoretical developments in landscape ecology have emphasized the relationship between pattern and process, as well as the effect that changes in spatial scale has on the potential to extrapolate information across scales.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  Several studies suggest that the landscape has critical thresholds at which ecological processes will show dramatic changes, such as the complete transformation of a landscape by an [[invasive species]] due to small changes in temperature characteristics which favor the invasive's [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]] requirements.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;

== Application ==

===Research directions===
Developments in landscape ecology illustrate the important relationships between spatial patterns and ecological processes. These developments incorporate quantitative methods that link spatial patterns and ecological processes at broad spatial and temporal scales.  This linkage of time, space, and environmental change can assist managers in applying plans to solve [[Natural environment|environmental]] problems.&lt;ref name="Turner-2001"/&gt;  The increased attention in recent years on spatial dynamics has highlighted the need for new quantitative methods that can analyze patterns, determine the importance of spatially explicit processes, and develop reliable models.&lt;ref name="Turner-1991"/&gt;  [[Multivariate analysis|Multivariate]] analysis techniques are frequently used to examine landscape level vegetation patterns.  Studies use statistical techniques, such as [[cluster analysis]], [[canonical correspondence analysis]] (CCA), or [[detrended correspondence analysis]] (DCA), for classifying vegetation.  [[Gradient analysis]] is another way to determine the vegetation structure across a landscape or to help delineate critical wetland habitat for conservation or mitigation purposes (Choesin and Boerner 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, J. and C. L. Sagers, C.L. 1998.  Structure of herbaceous plant assemblages in a forested riparian landscape.  Plant Ecology 138:1-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Climate change]] is another major component in structuring current research in landscape ecology.  Ecotones, as a basic unit in landscape studies, may have significance for management under climate change scenarios, since change effects are likely to be seen at ecotones first because of the unstable nature of a fringe habitat.&lt;ref name="Walker-2003"/&gt;  Research in northern regions has examined landscape ecological processes, such as the accumulation of snow, melting, freeze-thaw action, percolation, soil moisture variation, and temperature regimes through long-term measurements in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;Loffler, J. and O.-D. Finch.  2005.  Spatio-temporal gradients between high mountain ecosystems of central Norway.  Arctic, Antarctic, and Alpine Research 37:499-513.&lt;/ref&gt;  The study analyzes gradients across space and time between ecosystems of the central high mountains to determine relationships between distribution patterns of animals in their environment.  Looking at where animals live, and how vegetation shifts over time, may provide insight into changes in snow and ice over long periods of time across the landscape as a whole.

Other landscape-scale studies maintain that human impact is likely the main determinant of landscape pattern over much of the globe.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J.B. and W. M. King.  1995.  Human-mediated vegetation switches as processes in landscape ecology.  ''[[Landscape Ecology (journal)|Landscape Ecology]]'' 10:191-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Landscapes may become substitutes for [[biodiversity]] measures because plant and animal composition differs between samples taken from sites within different landscape categories.  Taxa, or different species, can “leak” from one habitat into another, which has implications for landscape ecology.  As human land use practices expand and continue to increase the proportion of edges in landscapes, the effects of this leakage across edges on assemblage integrity may become more significant in conservation. This is because taxa may be conserved across landscape levels, if not at local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Dangerfield, J.M., A.J. Pik, D.Britton, A. Holmes, M. Gillings, I. Oliver, D. Briscoe, and A. J. Beattie.  2003.  Patterns of invertebrate biodiversity across a natural edge.  Austral Ecology 28:227-236.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to other disciplines===
Landscape ecology has been incorporated into a variety of ecological subdisciplines. For example, a recent development has been the more explicit consideration of spatial concepts and principles applied to the study of lakes, streams, and wetlands in the field of [[landscape limnology]]. [[Seascape ecology]] is a marine and coastal application of landscape ecology&lt;ref&gt;Pittman SJ (ed.). 2017. Seascape Ecology. Wiley &amp; Sons&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, landscape ecology has important links to application-oriented disciplines such as [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]].  In agriculture, landscape ecology has introduced new options for the management of environmental threats brought about by the intensification of agricultural practices.  Agriculture has always been a strong human impact on ecosystems.&lt;ref name="Ryszkowski-2002"/&gt;  In forestry, from structuring stands for fuelwood and timber to ordering stands across landscapes to enhance aesthetics, consumer needs have affected conservation and use of forested landscapes.  Landscape forestry provides methods, concepts, and analytic procedures for landscape forestry.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce, S.G. 1995.  Landscape Forestry.  John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Landscape ecology has been cited as a contributor to the development of [[fishery|fisheries]] biology as a distinct biological science discipline,&lt;ref&gt;Magnuson, J.J. 1991.  Fish and fisheries ecology.  Ecological Applications 1:13-26.&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently incorporated in study design for wetland delineation in [[hydrology]].&lt;ref name="Attrill-2002"/&gt; It has helped shape [[integrated landscape management]].&lt;ref name="Sayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sayer|first1=J|title=Reconciling conservation and development: are landscapes the answer?|journal=Biotropica|date=2009|volume=41|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1744-7429.2009.00575.x/abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lastly, landscape ecology has been very influential for progressing sustainability science and sustainable development planning.  In example, a recent study assessed sustainable urbanization across Europe using evaluation indices, country-landscapes, and landscape ecology tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;Shaker, R.R. (2015) The well-being of nations: an empirical assessment of sustainable urbanization for Europe. International Journal of Sustainable Development &amp; World Ecology, 22(5), 375-387. https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13504509.2015.1055524&lt;/ref&gt;

Landscape ecology has also been combined with [[population genetics]] to form the field of landscape genetics, which addresses how landscape features influence the population structure and gene flow of plant and animal populations across space and time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manel|first=Stéphanie|last2=Schwartz|first2=Michael K.|last3=Luikart|first3=Gordon|last4=Taberlet|first4=Pierre|date=April 2003|title=Landscape genetics: combining landscape ecology and population genetics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534703000089|journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution|volume=18|issue=4|pages=189–197|doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(03)00008-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on how the quality of intervening landscape, known as "matrix," influences spatial variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Storfer|first=A.|last2=Murphy|first2=M.

A '''lineament''' is a linear feature in a [[landscape]] which is an expression of an underlying [[Structural geology|geological structure]] such as a [[fault (geology)|fault]]. Typically a lineament will appear as a fault-aligned valley, a series of fault or fold-aligned hills, a straight coastline or indeed a combination of these features. [[Fracture zone]]s, [[shear zone]]s and [[igneous intrusion]]s such as [[dike (geology)|dykes]] can also be expressed as [[Geomorphology|geomorphic]] lineaments.

Lineaments are often apparent in geological or topographic maps and can appear obvious on aerial or satellite photographs. There are for example, several instances within [[Great Britain]].  In [[Scotland]] the [[Great Glen Fault]] and [[Highland Boundary Fault]] give rise to lineaments as does the [[Malvern Hills|Malvern Line]] in western [[England]] and the [[Neath Disturbance]] in [[South Wales]].

The term 'megalineament' has been used to describe such features on a continental scale. The trace of the [[San Andreas Fault]] might be considered an example.&lt;ref&gt;Whitten &amp; Brooks, The Penguin Dictionary of Geology 1972&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Trans Brazilian Lineament]] and the [[Trans-Saharan Belt]], taken together, form perhaps the longest coherent shear zone on the Earth, extending for about 4,000&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=Attoh2008&gt;{{Cite journal|bibcode=2008AGUSM.S51A..04A

 |journal=American Geophysical Union
 |volume=51
 |author1=Attoh, K. |author2=Brown, L. D. |publisher=American Geophysical Union
 |year=2008
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lineaments have also been identified on other [[planet]]s and their [[natural satellite|moon]]s. Their origins may be radically different from those of terrestrial lineaments due to the differing [[tectonic]] processes involved.

'''Katarina Gavran né Došen''' (portrayed by [[Mirna Medaković]]) is the girl from Zagreb, and she came to Oštrovac when her grandfather Đuro died.

Katarina is nice, smart, witty, stubborn, unruly and very passionate when she fights for her views. She finished medicine from a desire to help people, but after one year of work in the hospital it became clear that her work comes down to the numbers and not people, who are quite frustrating for her. She was in a long-time relationship with Dr Denis Osvaldić who cheated on her from time to time but she didn't know.

Through the 1st season, she broke up with him and started a relationship with Damir (episode 101). The two married at the end of the 1st season.

At the 2nd-season premiere, she and Damir opened the hotel "Đurin son", named after her grandfather.

Later on the season she and Damir try to have a baby, but the doctors told them that they are not compatible, so she and Damir adopted their son Roko. In the penultimate episode of series, she found out that she is pregnant with their child. In the last episode, she gave birth to daughter Đurđica (who was also named after Katarina's grandfather Đuro).

In same episode she said that without grandpa Đuro she would not be with Damir.

'''Damir Gavran''' (portrayed by [[Momčilo Otašević]]) is handsome, witty, sports slick and entertaining ranger in the national park in Oštrovac.

Damir was raised traditionally in a family with lots of love, so that love and care for the family (and village) strongly embedded in him. He is like a good spirit of the village because like he takes care of the national like he takes care of the countryside. While his father is on board and has big plans for the village, Damir is a driver of any action (repair playground, patching holes in the roads, make-up school ...)

When his father tried to reopen sawmill, he was fired after the ministry shut down the park where he worked. He worked brief aboard. Some time later he returned to his job as a ranger, but in 2nd season he was set up by don Ante and he again got fired, but don Ante returned him later on the job.

He falls in love with Katarina from the first moment he saw her on the road when she hit him with a tin in the head. Until 63rd episode of a 1st season he constantly tried to hook up Katarina and in the 63th episode, she kissed him and they spent the night in his log cabin. At the end of the 1st season, the couple married.

In 2nd season they opened a hotel. Later they try to make the baby, but the doctors said that they are not compatible and he and Katarina adopted son Roko and in a penultimate episode, he succeeded to make a baby with Katarina.

**This species was considered as Philautus romeri. A study is done to review 177 nominal species in the genus [[Philautus]] replaced Romer's Tree Frog from genus Philautus to [[Chirixalus]] since species in genus Philautus do not have a free-living tadpoles stage.

**This species has recently undergone genetic boundary divisions and definition changes. Previously ''[[Microhyla ornata]]'' was listed as occurring in Hong Kong, but now this species is listed as restricted to the [[Indian Subcontinent]] and ''Microhyla fissipes'' is the [[Southeast Asia]] and Chinese species. Most online data still report ''Microhyla ornata'' for Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.flickr.com/photos/63048706@N06/6027203271/&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marbled Pigmy Frog (''[[Microhyla pulchra]]'')

==Threats of Hong Kong amphibians==
Despite the semi-terrestrial mode of life, amphibians are closely associated with water because of breeding. Rapid development in Hong Kong has resulted in the loss of many low-lying wetlands which were once important amphibian [[habitats]]; this has led to a severe decline in the populations of certain lowland species, such as the Rough-skinned Floating Frog (''[[Occidozyga lima]]''), which inhabited the once-abundant, but no longer existing paddy fields in [[Tung Chung]] and is now thought to be locally extinct.

Pollution of water bodies and [[acid rain]] also affect an individual's survival. In general, the diversity of amphibians decreases as the pollution level in a water body increases. Only some hardier pollution-tolerant species, such as [[Hylarana guentheri|Günther's Frog]] and [[Duttaphrynus melanostictus|Asian Common Toad]], can thrive in polluted habitats.

Some exotic/market amphibian species are occasionally seen in the countryside, such as the [[Rana catesbeiana|American Bullfrog]]. Some are deliberately released during Buddhist ceremonies. These released animals can adversely affect the local ecosystem and native [[fauna]], as they may prey on, compete with, or spread disease to the native amphibian fauna.&lt;ref&gt;Chan ''et al.'' 2005, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

The following lists the [[rail station|station]]s of all urban rail transit systems in [[Bangkok]], including the [[BTS Skytrain|BTS]], [[Mass Rapid Transit (Bangkok)|MRT]] and [[Suvarnabhumi Airport Rail Link|Airport Rail Link]]. There are currently 77 stations in operation:
* 38 BTS Skytrain stations (23 on the [[Sukhumvit Line]] and 13 on the [[Silom Line]], with Siam being an interchange between the two)
* 34 MRT stations (19 on the [[MRT Blue Line|Blue Line]] and 16 on the [[MRT Purple Line|Purple Line]], with Tao Poon being an interchange between the two)
* 8 Airport Rail Link stations
Where there are designated interchanges between different networks, the two stations are generally given different names, such as Asok BTS station to Sukhumvit MRT. The exception is Phaya Thai, which has a station on the Airport Rail Link and BTS, and is shown as two stations in the list below.

Many more are currently in various stages of planning and construction as shown in the latest [[Mass Rapid Transit Master Plan in Bangkok Metropolitan Region|Mass Rapid Transfer Master Plan]].

Music journalist and author Nick Coleman has gone as far as to say that apart from love, "pop is better on cities than anything else."&lt;ref name ="decline"/&gt;

Popular music often treats cities positively, though sometimes they are portrayed as places of danger and temptation. In many cases, songs celebrate individual cities, presenting them as exciting and liberating. Not all genres share the tendency to be positive about cities; in [[Country music]] cities are often portrayed as unfriendly and dehumanizing, or seductive but full of sin.&lt;ref name ="decline"/&gt;&lt;ref name ="place"/&gt; However, there are many exceptions, for example: [[Lady Antebellum]]'s song ‘This City’, [[Danielle Bradbery]]'s ‘[[Young in America]]’, and many others.

Lyricist and author Sheila Davis writes that including a city in a song's title helps focus the song on the concrete and specific, which is both more appealing and more likely to lead to universal truth than abstract generalizations. Davis also says that songs with titles concerning cities and other specific places often have enduring popularity.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53838">In [[traditional Chinese medicine|Traditional Chinese Medicine]], there are roughly 13,000 medicinals used in China and over 100,000 medicinal prescriptions recorded in the ancient literature.&lt;ref name="Certainprogress"&gt;Certain progress of clinical research on Chinese integrative medicine, Keji Chen, Bei Yu, Chinese Medical Journal, 1999,  112 (10), p. 934, [http://wenku.baidu.com/view/dfc192a0b0717fd5360cdc44.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Plant elements and extracts are the most common elements used in medicines.&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;Foster &amp; Yue 1992, p.11&lt;/ref&gt; In the classic ''Handbook of Traditional Drugs'' from 1941, 517 drugs were listed - 442 were plant parts, 45 were animal parts, and 30 were minerals.&lt;ref name="Foster" /&gt;

Herbal medicine, as used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), came to widespread attention in the United States in the 1970s.

In Vietnam, traditional medicine comprises Thuoc Bac (Northern Medicine) and Thuoc Nam (Southern Medicine). Only those who can understand Chinese characters could diagnose and prescribe remedies in Northern Medicine. The theory of Northern Medicine is based on the Yin-Yang interactions and the eight trigrams, as used in Chinese Medicine.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiarecipe.com/vietmedicine.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/10755530152639710&lt;/ref&gt; Herbs such as [[Gleditsia sinensis]] are used in both Traditional Vietnamese Medicine and TCM.

[[Panax ginseng|Ginseng]] is the most broadly used substance for the most broad set of alleged cures.  Powdered antlers, horns, teeth, and bones are second in importance to ginseng, with claims ranging from curing cancer to curing impotence.

[[Monkshood]] root is commonly used in TCM.&lt;ref&gt;''"Aconitum in Traditional Chinese, Medicine—A valuable drug or an unpredictable risk?"'', ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'', Volume 126,  Issue 1, 29 October 2009, Judith Singhuber, Ming Zhu, Sonja Prinz, Brigitte Kopp, Pages 18-30&lt;/ref&gt; It was once so commonly used it was called "the king of the 100 herbs".&lt;ref name=YTHF&gt;Yang Tianhui: Notes from My Visit to the Fuzi Growing Area of Zhangming County (Song Dynasty, 1099 CE), , Heiner Fruehauf, {{cite web |url=http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/2010/12/yang-tianhui-notes-from-my-visit-to-the-fuzi-growing-area-of-zhangming-county-song-dynasty-1099-ce/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317112442/http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/2010/12/yang-tianhui-notes-from-my-visit-to-the-fuzi-growing-area-of-zhangming-county-song-dynasty-1099-ce/ |archivedate=2011-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IOA&gt;[http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fruehauf_fuziinterview1.pdf ''"The Importance of Aconite (fuzi)"''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725175628/http://www.classicalchinesemedicine.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/fruehauf_fuziinterview1.pdf |date=2011-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[monkshood]] plant contains what is called "the queen of poisons", the highly toxic [[alkaloid]] [[aconitine]].&lt;ref name="pmid19514874"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Chan TY |title=Aconite poisoning |journal=Clinical Toxicology |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=279–85 |date=April 2009 |pmid=19514874 |doi=10.1080/15563650902904407 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aconitine]] is easily absorbed through the skin, eyes and through the lining of the nose; Death may occur through respiratory paralysis. A few minutes after exposure, [[paresthesia]] starts at the mouth and slowly beings to cover the whole body, [[Anesthesia]], hot and cold flashes, nausea and vomiting and other similar symptoms follow. Sometimes there is strong pain, accompanied by cramps, or diarrhea.&lt;ref&gt;{{aut|Roth, L., Daunderer, M. &amp; Kormann, K.}} (1994): ''Giftpflanzen - Pflanzengifte''. {{ISBN|3-933203-31-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

When a person has a negative reaction to the alkaloid, some practitioners of classical Chinese medicine think that this is because it was that the monkshood plant was processed incorrectly or planted on the wrong place or on the wrong day of the year; Not because of an [[drug overdose|overdose]]&lt;ref name=IOA/&gt;&lt;ref name=PZ&gt;Pao Zhi: An Introduction to the Use of Processed Chinese Medicinals, Philippe Sionneau&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also used in TCM to treat arthritis, colic, diarrhea, heart conditions, the common cold, flu-like symptoms, headaches, and [[menstrual cramp]]s. Today, health care professionals worldwide commonly recommend ginger to help prevent or treat nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness, pregnancy, and cancer chemotherapy. It is also used as a treatment for minor stomach upset, as a supplement for [[arthritis]], and may even help prevent heart disease and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/ginger-000246.htm ''Ginger'', University of Maryland Medical Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ginseng ===
{{Further|Panax ginseng}}

[[Ginseng]] root is the most widely sold traditional Chinese medicine.  The name "ginseng" is used to refer to both American (''[[Panax quinquefolius]]'') and Asian or Korean ginseng (''[[Panax ginseng|P. ginseng]]''), which belong to the species Panax and have a similar chemical makeup. Siberian ginseng or Eleuthero (''[[Eleutherococcus senticosus]]'') is another type of plant. Asian ginseng has a light tan, gnarled root that often looks like a human body with stringy shoots for arms and legs. In ancient times, herbalists thought that because of the way ginseng looks it could treat many different kinds of syndromes, from fatigue and stress to asthma and cancer. In traditional Chinese medicine, ginseng was often combined with other herbs and used often to bring longevity, strength, and mental alacrity to its users.  Asian ginseng is believed to enhance the immune system in preventing and treating infection and disease. Several clinical studies report that Asian ginseng can improve immune function. Studies have found that ginseng seems to increase the number of immune cells in the blood, and improve the immune system's response to a flu vaccine. In one study, 227 participants received either ginseng or placebo for 12 weeks, with a flu shot administered after 4 weeks. The number of colds and flu were two-thirds lower in the group that took ginseng.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/asian-ginseng-000249.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ginseng contains stimulants, but may produce side effect including [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]], [[Hypotension|low blood pressure]], and [[mastalgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031015/1539.html http://www.aafp.org/afp/20031015/1539.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  Ginseng may also lead to induction of [[mania]] in depressed patients who mix it with antidepressants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fugh-Berman|first=Adriane |title=Herb-drug interactions|journal=The Lancet|volume=355|issue=9198|pages=134–138|issn=|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6T1B-41CNTJ6-T/2/5571af69320b04517be500e5704b99c1|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(99)06457-0|year=2000|pmid=10675182}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common and characteristic symptoms of acute overdose of ginseng from the genus ''[[Panax]]'' is bleeding.  Symptoms of mild overdose with ''Panax'' ginseng may include dry mouth and lips, excitation, fidgeting, irritability, tremor, palpitations, blurred vision, headache, insomnia, increased body temperature, increased blood pressure, edema, decreased appetite, increased sexual desire, dizziness, itching, eczema, early morning diarrhea, bleeding, and fatigue.&lt;ref name=CMHP/&gt; Symptoms of gross overdose with ''Panax'' ginseng may include nausea, vomiting, irritability, restlessness, urinary and bowel incontinence, fever, increased blood pressure, increased respiration, decreased sensitivity and reaction to light, decreased heart rate, cyanotic facial complexion, red face, seizures, convulsions, and delirium.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The constituents of ginseng include triterpene saponins, aglycone protopanaxadiol, aglycone protopanaxytriol, aglycone oleanolic acid and water-soluble polysaccharides.&lt;ref name="maciociaonline.blogspot.sg"/&gt;

=== Goji berry ===
{{main|Wolfberry}}
Marketing literature for [[goji berry]] ([[wolfberry]]) products including several "goji juices" suggest that wolfberry [[polysaccharides]] have extensive biological effects and health benefits, although none of these claims have been supported by peer-reviewed research.

A May 2008 clinical study published by the peer-reviewed [[Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine]] indicated that [[parameter|parametric]] data, including body weight, did not show significant differences between subjects receiving ''Lycium barbarum'' berry juice and subjects receiving the placebo; the study concluded that subjective measures of health were improved and suggested further research in humans was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amagase H, Nance DM |title=A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, clinical study of the general effects of a standardized Lycium barbarum (Goji) Juice, GoChi |journal=J Altern Complement Med |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=403–12 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18447631 |doi=10.1089/acm.2008.0004 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study, however, was subject to a variety of criticisms concerning its experimental design and interpretations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Daniells S.| title = Questions raised over Goji science.| publisher = NutraIngredients.com-USA| url = http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/Research/Questions-raised-over-Goji-science |date=October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweet wormwood ===

{{See also|Artemisinin}}

Sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]'', Qing Hao) is believed under TCM to treat fever, headache, dizziness, stopping bleeding, and alternating fever and chills.

Sweet wormwood had fallen out of common use under TCM until it was rediscovered in the 1970s when the ''[[Chinese Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments]]'' (340 AD) was found.  This [[pharmacopeia]] contained recipes for a tea from dried leaves, prescribed for fevers (not specifically [[malaria]]).  The plant extracts often used in TCM  are [[antimalarial]], due to the presence of [[artemisinin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Duke SO, Paul RN |title=Development and Fine Structure of the Glandular Trichomes of ''Artemisia annua L.'' |journal=Int.

=== Willow bark ===
''See also [[Aspirin]]''

[[Willow|Plants of the genus ''Salix'']] have been used since the time of [[Hippocrates]] (400 BC) when patients were advised to chew on the bark to reduce fever and inflammation. Willow bark has been used throughout the centuries in China and Europe to the present for the treatment of pain (particularly low back pain and [[osteoarthritis]]), [[headache]], and inflammatory conditions such as [[bursitis]] and [[tendinitis]]. The bark of white willow contains salicin, which is a chemical similar to aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). It is thought to be responsible for the pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects of the herb. In 1829, salicin was used to develop aspirin. White willow appears to be slower than aspirin to bring pain relief, but its effects may last longer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/willow-bark-000281.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Minerals ==
=== Arsenic ===
{{Further|Arsenic}}
[[Realgar|Arsenic sulfide]] (Xiong Huang) is a toxic mineral used in TCM to kill [[parasitic worms]] and treat sore throats, swellings, abscesses, itching, rashes, and malaria.&lt;ref name=plos&gt;Genuis SJ, Schwalfenberg G, Siy A-KJ, Rodushkin I (2012) [http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0049676#pone.0049676-Woolf1  '' Toxic Element Contamination of Natural Health Products and Pharmaceutical Preparations''].

==== Cinnabar ====
Despite its [[toxic]]ity, [[mercury sulfide]] ([[cinnabar]]) has historically been used in Chinese medicine, where it is called ''zhūshā'' ([[wikt:朱砂|朱砂]]), and was highly valued in [[Chinese alchemy|Chinese Alchemy]].  It was also referred to as ''dān'' ([[wikt:丹|丹]]), meaning{{vague|date=October 2016}} all of [[Chinese alchemy]], cinnabar, and the "elixir of immortality".

'''Little Rock''' is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and most populous city of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arkansas]]. It is also the [[county seat]] of [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski County]]. It was incorporated on November 7, 1831, on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] close to the state's geographic center. The city derives its name from a rock formation along the river, named [[The Little Rock|the "Little Rock"]] ([[French language|French]]: ''La Petite Roche'') by the French explorer [[Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe]] in the 1720s. The capital of the [[Arkansas Territory]] was moved to Little Rock from [[Arkansas Post, Arkansas|Arkansas Post]] in 1821. The city's population was 198,541 in 2016 according to the [[United States Census Bureau]]. The six-county [[Little Rock-North Little Rock-Conway, AR Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA) is ranked 78th in terms of population in the United States with 738,344 residents according to the 2017 estimate by the [[United States Census Bureau]].&lt;ref name="FactFinder"&gt;{{cite web |title=American FactFinder |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/nav/jsf/pages/index.xhtml  |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2014-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2011/feb/10/census-data-arkansas-released/?latest |title=Census shows overall state population up 9.1 percent|publisher=Arkansasonline.com|date=2011-02-10|accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Rock is a cultural, economic, government, and transportation center within Arkansas and [[Southern United States|the South]]. Several cultural institutions are in Little Rock, such as the [[Arkansas Arts Center]], the [[Arkansas Repertory Theatre]], and the Arkansas Symphony Orchestra, in addition to the hiking, boating, and other outdoor recreational opportunities. Little Rock's history is available through history museums, historic districts or neighborhoods like the [[Quapaw Quarter]], and historic sites such as [[Little Rock Central High School]]. The city is the headquarters of [[Dillard's]], [[Windstream Communications]], [[Acxiom]]{{dn|date=November 2018}}, [[Stephens Inc.]], [[University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences]], [[Heifer International]], the [[Clinton Foundation]], and the [[Rose Law Firm]]. Other large corporations, such as [[Dassault Falcon Jet]] and [[LM Wind Power]] have large operations in the city. State government is a large employer, with many offices being in downtown Little Rock. Two major Interstate highways, [[Interstate 30]] and [[Interstate 40]], meet in Little Rock, with the Port of Little Rock serving as a shipping hub.

==Etymology==
Little Rock derives its name from a small rock formation on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] called the "Little Rock" (French: ''La Petite Roche''). The Little Rock was used by early river traffic as a landmark and became a well-known river crossing. The Little Rock is across the river from The Big Rock, a large bluff at the edge of the river, which was once used as a rock quarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Historical City |publisher=City of Little Rock |url=http://www.littlerock.org/citymanager/divisions/cityclerksoffice/ourhistoricalcity.aspx |accessdate=September 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Little Rock, Arkansas|History of Arkansas}}

===Prehistory===
[[Archeological]] artifacts provide evidence of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] inhabiting Central Arkansas for thousands of years before Europeans arrived. The early inhabitants may have been the [[Folsom tradition|Folsom]] people, Bluff Dwellers, and [[Mississippian culture]] peoples who built [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] mounds recorded in 1541 by [[Spanish people|Spanish]] [[explorer]] [[Hernando de Soto]]. Historical tribes of the area were the [[Caddo]], [[Quapaw]], [[Osage Nation|Osage]], [[Choctaw]], and [[Cherokee]].

Little Rock was named for a stone outcropping on the bank of the [[Arkansas River]] used by early travelers as a landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansas.com/things-to-do/history-heritage/colorful-names/ |title=Colorful Names |publisher=Arkansas Department of Parks &amp; Tourism |accessdate=14 July 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131124055328/http://www.arkansas.com/things-to-do/history-heritage/colorful-names/ |archivedate=November 24, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named in 1722 by French explorer and [[Merchant|trader]] [[Bernard de la Harpe|Jean-Baptiste Bénard de la Harpe]], marked the transition from the flat [[Mississippi Delta]] region to the [[Ouachita Mountains|Ouachita Mountain]] foothills. Travelers referred to the area as the "Little Rock." Though there was an effort to officially name the city "Arkopolis" upon its founding in the 1820s, and that name did appear on a few maps made by the [[US Geological Survey]], the name Little Rock is eventually what stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GYolAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA61&amp;lpg=RA1-PA61&amp;dq=little+rock+arkopolis&amp;hl=en|title=The Hyde Park Historical Record|date=December 29, 2017|publisher=Hyde Park Historical Society|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRCLFU_855UC&amp;pg=PA5&amp;dq=arkopolis&amp;hl=en|title=Historic Little Rock: An Illustrated History|first=C.

==Geography==
Little Rock is located at {{Coord|34|44|10|N|92|19|52|W|type:city}} (34.736009, −92.331122).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2011-04-23 |date=2011-02-12 |title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Little Rock Arkansas.jpg|thumb|right|2011 astronaut photograph of Little Rock, Arkansas taken from the International Space Station (ISS)]]

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|116.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|116.2|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi}} (0.52%) is water.

Little Rock is located on the south bank of the [[Arkansas River]] in Central Arkansas. Fourche Creek and Rock Creek run through the city, and flow into the river. The western part of the city is located in the foothills of the [[Ouachita Mountains]]. Northwest of the city limits are Pinnacle Mountain and Lake Maumelle, which provides Little Rock's drinking water.

The city of [[North Little Rock]] is located just across the river from Little Rock, but it is a separate city. [[North Little Rock]] was once the 8th ward of Little Rock. An [[Arkansas Supreme Court]] decision on February 6, 1904, allowed the ward to merge with the neighboring town of North Little Rock. The merged town quickly renamed itself Argenta (the local name for the former 8th Ward), but returned to its original name in October 1917.&lt;ref name="NLR"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradbury |first=Cary |title=North Little Rock (Pulaski County) |date=2007-11-14 |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=973 |accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mother Grundy''' is an [[Etiology#Mythology|etiological myth]] referring to a mountain, the "Madre Grande".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mothergrundy.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090710051303/http://www.mothergrundy.org/ |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The myth refers to a woman who is literally "as old as the hills" who came from this mountain, clinging to the "old ways" when the original inhabitants of [[Mexico]] and [[California]] lived around the area of the mountain. These old ways became erroneously associated with [[grundyism]], giving rise to the [[Mrs Grundy|eponym]].

{{Governance}}

'''Ocean governance'''  is the conduct of the policy, actions and affairs regarding the world's [[oceans]]. Within governance, it incorporates the influence of non-state actors, i.e. stakeholders, NGOs and so forth, therefore the state is not the only acting power in policy making. However, in terms of the ocean, this is a complex issue because it is a commons that is not ‘owned’ by any single nation/state. The consequences of this has resulted in humankind abusing the oceans’ resources, by treating them as shared resources, but not taking equal and collective responsibilities in caring for them.&lt;ref&gt;Boesch, D.F. (1999) The role of science in ocean governance. ''Ecological Economics'', 31, pp. 189–198.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that rules on the conduct of the ocean can only be implemented through international agreements.&lt;ref name= DeSombre&gt;DeSombre, E.R. (2006) ''Global Environmental Institutions'', Abingdon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, there is a need for some form of governance to maintain the ocean for its various uses, preferably in a sustainable manner.

==Legal framework==

{{See also|Admiralty law|l1=Admiralty Law}}

There are two major international legal organisations that exist that are involved in ocean governance on a global scale. The [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which was ratified in 1958 is responsible mainly for maritime safety, liability and compensation and they have held some conventions on [[marine pollution]] related to shipping incidents.

===IMO marine pollution conventions===

* 1972 – [[Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter]] (LDC)
* 1969 – International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties (INTERVENTION).
* 1973 – [[MARPOL 73/78|International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships]], as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78).
* 1990 – International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response, and Cooperation (OPRC).
* 2000 – Protocol on Preparedness, Response and Cooperation to Pollution Incidents by Hazardous and Noxious Substances (HNS Protocol).&lt;ref name= DeSombre /&gt;

The IMO sees the regulation of marine pollution as one its most important aspects of governance and in particular, the MARPOL convention is regarded as one of its greatest successes.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization (IMO), http://www.imo.org/About/Pages/Default.aspx [Accessed: 10/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt; The result of MARPOL has meant that oil pollution has decreased due to a change in equipment standards of oil tankers to prevent operational discharge of oil.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, R.B. (1994) ''International Oil Pollution at Sea''. Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the main organisation concerned with the economic, environmental, ethical, peace and security issues is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).

===United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)===

{{Main|UNCLOS|l1=United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea}}

It was first established under the Third UNCLOS in 1973 and fully ratified in 1982. The main aim was to adopt a regime of national seas and international waters on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Birnie, P.W. (1993) The Law of the Sea and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. In: N. Ginsburg, E. Mann Borgese and J. R. Morgan (eds.) ''Ocean Yearbook'', Vol 10, Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, pp. 13–35.&lt;/ref&gt; What was agreed was that the jurisdictional boundaries of individual states were to be enlarged to 200 nautical miles off a state’s coastline. Coastal states were given greater rights to control these areas for protective purposes and the exploitation of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Vallega, A. (2001) ''Sustainable Ocean Governance: A geographical perspective''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In total 38 million square nautical miles of ocean space was put under jurisdiction under the [[EEZ|Exclusive Economic Zones]] (EEZ) and the legalities concerning the continental shelf and territorial sea were altered.&lt;ref name= UNCLOS&gt;Oceans and the Law of the Sea, http://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/convention_historical_perspective.htm [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Convention did not come into full effect despite a number of implementations being carried out between 1973 and 1982. This was profoundly due to a dispute over mineral resources, particularly manganese nodules in the deep-oceans. Developing countries preferred treating these minerals as “[[Common heritage of mankind|common heritage]],” that via an international organisation, they could benefit from a sharing of these resources.&lt;ref&gt;Krasner, S.D. (1985) ''Structural Conflict: The Third World Against Global Liberalism'', Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the developed world, in particular the United States, was not in favour of this and preferring a first-come, first-served basis, due to self-economic interest. Only in 1994 did the United States renounce their objections so that the Convention could be enacted.

====Institutions established by UNCLOS====

* [[International Seabed Authority]] (ISA) – An independent international institution that came into force in 1994, with the aim of acting as a custodian of ocean commons (the Common Heritage of Mankind). However its main purpose is to regulate deep seabed mining.&lt;ref&gt;International Seabed Authority (ISA), http://www.isa.org.jm/en/about [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) – Assists states in affairs to do with the establishment of outer limits of their continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;Oceans and the Law of the Sea, http://www.un.org/Depts/los/clcs_new/commission_purpose.htm#Purpose [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[ITLOS|Regime for the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]] (ITLOS) – This was established to handle disputes with the application and interpretations of UNCLOS.&lt;ref&gt;International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) http://www.itlos.org/index.php?id=8&amp;L=0 [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Meeting of the State Parties (SPLOS) - carried out to conform with the article 319, paragraph 2 (e) to the LOSC Convention and is concerned with administrative matters.&lt;ref name= Repetto&gt;Repetto, M.S. (2005) ''Towards an ocean governance framework and national policy for Peru''. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/depts/los/nippon/unnff_programme_home/fellows_pages/fellows_papers/repetto_0506_peru.pdf&gt; [Accessed:12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participatory Governance in Ocean Governance==

Despite an obvious need for international bodies to control and manage the resources, it has been argued that for sustainable governance of the ocean to occur, it needs to be participatory.&lt;ref&gt;Costanza, R. (1999) The ecological, economic and social importance of the oceans. ''Ecological Economics'', 31, pp. 199–213.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of the potential importance of participatory governance was first truly highlighted in [[Agenda 21]], signed at the [[UNCED]] (United Nations Conference on Environment and Development) in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. It was stated that:
::''“Broad public participation in decision making was a fundamental prerequisite for the achievement of sustainable development.”''&lt;ref&gt;UNCED (1992) Agenda 21. ‘’United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, Rio de Janeiro, 1992’’. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/documents/agenda21/&gt; [Accessed: 11/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

What this means is that the public needs to be more actively involved along with the other stakeholders and authoritative bodies. This stems from democratic principles where the people are empowered to choose their own government, so with environmental concerns perhaps they should be involved in these in a similar manner. With the inclusion of people in a decision making process, it immediately secures legitimacy for these decisions.&lt;ref name= Evans&gt;Evans, J.P. (2012) ''Environmental Governance'', Oxon: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that expert scientific knowledge is important, but often enough “lay-knowledge” is equally credible concerning certain resources (in this case an example would be a fishery) and uncertainties within science itself. By engaging public participation, the benefit is that it is able to frame the environmental decision with the community in mind and how it will impact them.&lt;ref name= Evans /&gt; This would significantly be useful for ocean governance at a local and national level, in particular areas with coastal communities.

Due to the nature of participatory governance being resource intensive, it would be harder to expand this to regional levels and beyond. It is also important to not necessarily enrol too many stakeholders, as there may be the ‘participation paradox’ that essentially means the greater the number of stakeholders, the fewer the responsibilities and involvement of each one and their effectiveness is reduced in the process.&lt;ref&gt;De Vivero, J., Mateos, J. and del Corral, D. (2008) The paradox of public participation in fisheries governance. The rising number of actors and the devolution process. ''Marine Policy'', 32, pp. 319–25.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Importance of Participatory Governance to Integrated Coastal and Ocean Management in Canada (ICOM)===

In 2002, Canada introduced the Oceans Strategy, which was heavily based on participatory governance principles: 
::''“The governance model proposed for Integrated Management is one of collaboration. It involves ocean management decisions based on shared information, on consultation with stakeholders, and on their advisory or management participation in the planning process. It is also based on institutional arrangements that bring together all stakeholders. Participants take an active part in designing, implementing and monitoring the effectiveness of coastal and ocean management plans, and partners enter into agreements on ocean management plans with specific responsibilities, powers and obligations. It is also recognized that in specific cases, Integrated Management and planning may be achieved through co-management.”&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada (2002) Canada’s Ocean Strategy: Our Oceans, Our Future. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/oceans/publications/cosframework-cadresoc/pdf/im-gi-eng.pdf&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Case Study: The Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative====

The aim of the ESSIM Initiative is to create integrated and [[adaptive management]] plans that are a collaborative effort for ecosystem, social, economic and institutional sustainability of the [[Eastern Scotian Shelf]].&lt;ref name=FOC&gt;Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2001) ''The Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management (ESSIM) Initiative: Development of a Collaborative Management and Planning Process''. Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada&lt;/ref&gt; It incorporates maintaining existing jurisdictional responsibilities, inclusion, consensus, accountability, dispute resolution, networking, evolution, and learning by doing, which are all part of the governance principles in the Oceans Strategy.&lt;ref name= FOC /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BL Smith Workgroup Inc. (2004) Eastern Scotia Shelf Integrated Management Initiative: Proposed Collaborative Planning Model. A Discussion Paper. In: ‘’Oceans and Coastal Management Report 2004–2005’’: Nova Scotia: Fisheries and Oceans Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

How it works is that the Stakeholders Roundtable (lead stakeholders and government) and the Planning Office draft up a management plan and this is then reviewed at the ESSIM Forum (an annual stakeholders’ meeting), community meetings and the general public. Overall, an agreement then must be reached with the Stakeholder Roundtable and a final plan given to appropriate federal and provincial government agencies, before acquiring final approval under the Oceans Act.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Canada (1996) Canada Oceans Act, RSC 1996: Bill C-26, Chapter 31, 2nd Session, 35th Parliament, 45, Eliz. 2, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It has been seen as fairly successful in improving communication and cooperation within government agencies, but there is room for greater inclusion of coastal community participation to fully fulfil the participatory theory.&lt;ref&gt;Kearney, J., Berkes, F., Charles, A., Pinkerton, E. and Wiber, M. (2007) The Role of Participatory Governance and Community-Based Management in Integrated Coastal Management in Canada. ''Coastal Management'', 35, pp. 79–104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of implementation==

Ocean governance can be carried out at a local, national, regional or international level. However, there needs to be a link between all levels of implementation for “good” ocean governance to build on the theory of participatory governance at these different levels. Yet one of the greatest problems with ocean governance is that the organisations lack authority and instruments to guarantee compliance and enforcement of these laws.&lt;ref name= UNESCO&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) ''Ocean governance and institutional challenges''. [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/ioc-oceans/priority-areas/rio-20-ocean/ocean-governance/&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local===
Community-based management features in local implementation as stated in [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|Principle 22]] at Rio. What this means is that the state needs to recognise the importance that indigenous and local communities play in sustainable environmental policy making and how they can be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations (1992) Report of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development. Rio de Janeiro, 3–14 June 1992. Annex I “Rio Declaration on Environment and Development” [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.un.org/documents/ga/conf151/aconf15126-1annex1.htm&gt; [Accessed: 11/12/2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Also the stakeholders should take a role of responsibility with the government in a form of co-management to manage ocean resources.

===National===

At a national level, ocean governance is seen as an integrated management process within one state. This means there is a focus on almost all ministries of a government that have a function or authority related to ocean sectors and they collaborate.&lt;ref name= UNESCO /&gt; Due to ocean issues usually being low on a political agenda, it is said that to be successful integrated ocean policy is in need of the highest political direction and oversight to succeed.&lt;ref&gt;Vallejo, S.M. (1994) New structures for decision-making in integrated ocean policy. In: P. B. Payoyo (ed.) ''Ocean governance: Sustainable development of the sea''. Tokyo: United Nations University Press, pp. 71–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regional===

At this scale, the scope of management and challenges are greater, so governance requires more organisations. It comprises Regional Seas Programme of [[UNEP]] creating programmes to be managed and coordinated by countries that share a common body of water. These Action Plans range from chemical waste to conservation of marine ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Environment Program (UNEP): Regional Seas, [online] Available at: &lt;http://www.unep.org/regionalseas/about/default.asp&gt; [Accessed: 12/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt; These however need to be strengthened along with The Global Programme of Action for the Protection of the Marine Environment from Land-based Activities (GPA).&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

To be effective Regional Development Banks (RDBs) and Regional Governmental Organizations (RGOs) are necessary to participate and provide reinforcement of the former organisations. Therefore, a mandate is required for the implementation of sub-regional programs, agreements and conventions to ensure consensus-based decision-making.&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

===International===

The [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly of the United Nations]] is seen as the proficient international body to implement ocean governance. It functions by the Secretary General producing reports on the recommendations by the Consultative Process of ocean matters and the law of the sea, which are then annually reviewed by The General Assembly.&lt;ref name= Repetto /&gt;

==Examples of marine resource governance==
===Fishing===
The direct use of the ocean inherently comes from fishing for food resources, mainly for human consumption. In 2009, 79.9 million tonnes of fish were caught from a marine environment.&lt;ref name= FAO&gt;[[FAO|Fishing and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO) (2010) ''The state of world fisheries and aquaculture 2010''. [online] Available at: http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i1820e/i1820e.pdf [Accessed: 10/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;  While the FAO have stated that over half (53%) of fish stocks were said to be at full exploitation and thus their current catches are close to the maximum sustainable production levels.&lt;ref name= FAO /&gt; Therefore, it is important for an international agreement and policies to be in place, or nations will feel they are welcome to exploit the fish stocks beyond a sustainable level if there are no rules guiding fishing practices. Yet under UNCLOS, it is said that almost 99% of all fisheries are within a nation’s jurisdiction, however this is not preventing problems of exploitation.&lt;ref name= UNCLOS /&gt;

Since the mid-1980s, numerous fishery organisations appeared, which are narrowly focused but struggle to prevent global [[overfishing]].&lt;ref name= DeSombre /&gt; As a result, there are problems with [[illegal fishing]] vessels, violating the laws of a fishery in which they may misreport their catches to authorities or are vessels that are not certified to be within an area of water. The reason for this is usually due to a certain fish species with a high economic value, for example Bluefin Tuna.

Overcoming the problem of poor [[fishery management]] may be work best by transitioning to rights-based fishing and self-governance, which incorporates participatory governance theory. For it to work, there still needs to be a financial incentive that will fund it and ‘shares’ are distributed between the shareholders (individual/corporation, community or fishers’ collective) that are linked directly to the productivity and value of the resource, which consequently will make the shareholders appreciate the resource better and prevent overfishing.&lt;ref name=Allison&gt;Allison, E. H. (2001) Big laws, small catches:  Global ocean governance and the fisheries crisis. ''Journal of International Development'', 13, pp. 933–950.&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is that when shareholders have an individual share, it reduces the competition between them since they are not allowed more than their share.

There is a focus on rights-based approaches in current development programmes, which have an emphasis on creating (or recreating) and supporting local institutions to the fishery.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt; While a freedom of rights will result in economic benefits, there is a possibility of a monopolisation by more larger and powerful shareholders that will squeeze out small-scaled operations. The problem though with fisher folk having more rights, is they subsequently lack the transfer of skills to do with information, assessment, management and negotiation and they also lack sufficient funding due to their self-governing nature.&lt;ref name=Allison /&gt;

An alternative approach has been introducing market incentives to encourage sustainable fishing. The [[Marine Stewardship Council]] (MSC) introduced this through a fishery certification programme, with the incentive that the consumer will buy fish only caught by sustainable fisheries. This in turn creates a cycle that encourages the producer to abide by sustainable practices to gain the custom. To date (December 2011) there are currently 135 certified fisheries in the MSC Program.&lt;ref&gt;Marine Stewardship Council (MSC), http://www.msc.org/track-a-fishery/certified [Accessed: 13/12/2011].&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Niue:

'''[[Niue]]''' &amp;ndash; an island nation in free association with [[New Zealand]] located in the [[South Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ne.html|title=Niue|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is commonly known as the "Rock of Polynesia". Natives of the island call it merely "The Rock". Although self-governing, Niue is in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]], meaning that the [[Monarchy in New Zealand|Sovereign in Right of New Zealand]] is also Niue's [[head of state]]. Most diplomatic relations are conducted by New Zealand on Niue's behalf. Niue is located 2,400 kilometres northeast of New Zealand in a triangle between [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], and the [[Cook Islands]]. The [[Niuean language]] and the [[English language]] are both taught in schools and used in day-to-day business and communications. The people are predominantly Polynesian.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9837">The '''poles of astronomical bodies''' are determined based on their [[axis of rotation]] in relation to the [[celestial pole]]s of the [[celestial sphere]]. [[Astronomical bodies]] include [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[dwarf planet]]s and [[small Solar System bodies]] such as [[comets]] and [[minor planet]]s (i.e. [[asteroid]]s), as well as [[natural satellite]]s and [[minor-planet moon]]s.

== Geographic poles ==
The [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) defines the [[Geographical pole|geographic north pole]] of a [[planet]] or any of its satellites in the [[Solar System]] as the planetary pole that is in the same celestial hemisphere, relative to the [[invariable plane]] of the Solar System, as Earth's North pole.&lt;ref name="report"&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Venus]] rotates in the opposite direction to the other planets, and [[Uranus]] has been knocked on its side and rotates almost perpendicular to the rest of the Solar System. The [[ecliptic]] remains within 3° of the invariable plane over five million years,&lt;ref name="Laskar"&gt;Laskar, Jacques (1988), [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1988A%26A...198..341L "Secular evolution of the Solar System over 10 million years"], ''Astronomy and astrophysics'', no. 198, pp. 341–362 (p.351)&lt;/ref&gt; but is now inclined about 23.44° to Earth's [[celestial equator]] used for the coordinates of poles. This large inclination means that the declination of a pole relative to Earth's celestial equator could be negative even though a planet's north pole (such as Uranus's) is north of the invariable plane.

In 2009 the responsible IAU Working Group decided to define the poles of dwarf planets, minor planets, their satellites, and comets according to the [[right-hand rule]].&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; To avoid confusion with the "north" and "south" definitions relative to the invariable plane, the poles are called "positive" and "negative." The positive pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the right hand are curled in its direction of rotation. The negative pole is the pole toward which the thumb points when the fingers of the left hand are curled in its direction of rotation. This change was needed because the poles of some asteroids and comets precess rapidly enough for their north and south poles to swap within a few decades using the invariable plane definition.

The projection of a planet's geographic north pole onto the [[celestial sphere]] gives its north [[celestial pole]]. The location of the celestial poles of some selected Solar System objects is shown in the following table.&lt;ref name="report" /&gt; The coordinates are given relative to Earth's celestial equator and the vernal equinox as they existed at J2000 (2000 January 1 12:00:00 [[Terrestrial Time|TT]]) which is a plane fixed in inertial space now called the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]] (ICRF). Many poles precess or otherwise move relative to the ICRF, so their coordinates will change. The Moon's poles are particularly mobile.

&lt;/center&gt;

Some bodies in the Solar System, including [[Saturn]]'s [[natural satellite|moon]] [[Hyperion (moon)|Hyperion]] and the asteroid [[4179 Toutatis]], lack a stable geographic north pole. They rotate [[chaos theory|chaotically]] because of their irregular shape and [[gravity|gravitational]] influences from nearby planets and moons, and as a result the instantaneous pole wanders over their surface, and may momentarily vanish altogether (when the object comes to a standstill with respect to the distant stars).

== Magnetic poles ==
Planetary magnetic poles are defined analogously to the Earth's [[North Magnetic Pole|North]] and [[South magnetic pole]]s: they are the locations on the planet's surface at which the planet's [[magnetic field]] lines are vertical. The direction of the field determines whether the pole is a magnetic north or south pole, exactly as on Earth. The Earth's magnetic axis is approximately aligned with its rotational axis, meaning that the [[geomagnetic pole]]s are relatively close to the geographic poles. However, this is not necessarily the case for other planets; the magnetic axis of [[Uranus]], for example, is inclined by as much as 60°.

==Orbital pole==
{{main|Orbital pole}}

In addition to the rotational pole, a planet's orbit also has a defined direction in space. The direction of the angular momentum vector of that orbit can be defined as an [[orbital pole]]. [[Earth's orbit]]al pole, i.e. the [[ecliptic]] pole, points in the direction of the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]].

== Near, far, leading and trailing poles ==
In the particular (but frequent) case of [[synchronous rotation|synchronous]] satellites, four more poles can be defined. They are the '''near''', '''far''', '''leading''', and '''trailing''' poles. For example, [[Io (moon)|Io]], one of the moons of [[Jupiter]], rotates synchronously, so its orientation with respect to Jupiter stays constant. There will be a single, unmoving point of its surface where Jupiter is at the [[zenith]], exactly overhead&amp;nbsp;– this is the ''near pole'', also called the ''sub-'' or ''pro-Jovian'' point. At the [[Antipodal point|antipode]] of this point is the ''far pole'', where Jupiter lies at the [[nadir]]; it is also called the ''anti-Jovian'' point. There will also be a single unmoving point which is farthest along Io's orbit (best defined as the point most removed from the plane formed by the north-south and near-far axes, on the leading side)&amp;nbsp;– this is the ''leading pole''. At its antipode lies the ''trailing pole''. Io can thus be divided into north and south hemispheres, into pro- and anti-Jovian hemispheres, and into leading and trailing hemispheres. These poles are ''mean poles'' because the points are not, strictly speaking, unmoving: there is continuous [[libration]] about the mean orientation, because Io's orbit is slightly eccentric and the gravity of the other moons disturbs it regularly.

These poles also apply to planets that are rotating synchronously with their primary stars, as is likely the case with many [[hot Jupiter]]s and as was once thought to be the case with [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]. Other synchronously rotating objects, such as [[Pluto]] and some [[asteroids]] with large [[asteroid moon]]s, can also be described as having "near" and "far" poles&amp;nbsp;– though "leading" and "trailing" may not be as significant in these cases.

'''Raised-bed gardening''' is a form of [[gardening]] in which the soil is formed in three-to-four-foot-wide (1.0–1.2
m) beds, which can be of any length or shape. The soil is raised above the surrounding soil&lt;ref name="BHOM"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AI_etkFQ1RUC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=raised+bed+gardening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J1hRT8OqAoiRiQKK1-W0Bg&amp;ved=0CHQQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20bed%20gardening&amp;f=false | title=Better Homes &amp; Gardens Vegetable, Fruit &amp; Herb Gardening | publisher=Wiley | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author=Hughes, Megan McConnell | pages=68–69}} {{ISBN|978-0-470-63856-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately six inches to waist-high), is sometimes enclosed by a frame generally made of wood, rock, or concrete blocks, and may be enriched with [[compost]].&lt;ref name="Nones"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwiKzasrYTUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=raised+bed+gardening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J1hRT8OqAoiRiQKK1-W0Bg&amp;ved=0CGgQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20bed%20gardening&amp;f=false | title=Raised-Bed Vegetable Gardening Made Simple | publisher=Countryman Press | year=2010 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author=Nones, Raymond}} {{ISBN|978-0-88150-896-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vegetable]] [[plant]]s are spaced in geometric patterns, much closer together than in conventional row gardening.&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; The spacing is such that when the vegetables are fully grown, their leaves just barely touch each other, creating a [[microclimate]] in which weed growth is suppressed&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; and moisture is conserved.&lt;ref name="MHC"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tr36Tq_gadcC&amp;pg=PA291&amp;dq=raised+bed+gardening&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=J1hRT8OqAoiRiQKK1-W0Bg&amp;ved=0CG4Q6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=raised%20bed%20gardening&amp;f=false | title=Gardening under the arch: homespun hints and money saving tips from the rigorous high country of Alberta's chinook zone | publisher=The Club | year=1982 | accessdate=March 2, 2012 | author=Millarville Horticultural Club | pages=291–292}} {{ISBN|0-88925-406-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Raised beds produce a variety of benefits: they extend the planting season,&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; they can reduce weeds if designed and planted properly,&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; and they reduce the need to use poor native soil.

Waist-high raised beds enable the elderly and physically disabled to grow vegetables without having to bend over to tend them.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt;

==Overview==
Raised beds lend themselves to the development of complex agriculture systems that utilize many of the principles and methods of [[permaculture]]. They can be used effectively to control [[erosion]] and recycle and conserve water and nutrients by building them along contour lines on slopes.&lt;ref name="MHC"/&gt; This also makes more space available for intensive crop production.&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; They can be created over large areas with the use of several commonly available tractor-drawn implements and efficiently maintained, planted and harvested using hand tools.

This form of gardening is compatible with [[square foot gardening]] and [[companion planting]].

Circular raised beds with a path to the center (a slice of the circle cut out) are called [[keyhole garden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20120129/FEAT0106/301299980/1014/SPORTS09 | title=Unlock your creativity with keyhole garden | publisher=[http://www.journalgazette.net ''The Journal Gazette''] (Fort Wayne, IN) | date=January 29, 2012 | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Kemery, Ricky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often the center has a chimney of sorts built with sticks and then lined with feedbags or grasses that allows water placed at the center to flow out into the soil and reach the plants' roots.

===Materials and construction===
Vegetable garden bed construction materials should be chosen carefully. Some concerns exist regarding the use of pressure-treated timber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.finegardening.com/design/articles/pressure-treated-wood-in-beds.aspx | title=Does Pressure-Treated Wood Belong in Your Garden? | publisher=[http://www.finegardening.com Fine Gardening Magazine] | accessdate=March 6, 2012 | author=Lively, Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wood preservation|Pine]] that was treated using [[chromated copper arsenate]] or CCA, a toxic chemical mix for preserving timber that may leach chemicals into the soil which in turn can be drawn up into the plants, is a concern for vegetable growers, where part or all of the plant is eaten. If using timber to raise the garden bed, ensure that it is an untreated&lt;ref name="Nones"/&gt; [[hardwood]] to prevent the risk of chemicals leaching into the soil. A common approach is to use timber [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] joined with steel rods to hold them together. Another approach is to use [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete blocks]], although less aesthetically pleasing, they are inexpensive to source and easy to use. On the market are also prefab raised garden bed solutions which are made from long lasting [[polyethylene]] that is [[UV stabilizers in plastics|UV stabilized]] and food grade so it will not leach undesirable chemicals into the soil or deteriorate in the elements. A double skinned wall provides an air pocket of insulation that minimizes the temperature fluctuations and drying out of the soil in the garden bed. Sometimes raised bed gardens are covered with clear plastic to protect the crops from wind and strong rains.&lt;ref name="Whiting"/&gt; Pre-manufactured raised bed gardening boxes also exist.&lt;ref name="BHOM"/&gt; There are variants of wood, metal, stone and plastic. Each material type has advantages and disadvantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hochbeete-kaufen.net/|title=Hochbeet kaufen - Hochbeete im Test und Vergleich|last=|first=|date=|website=Hochbeete kaufen|publisher=|language=de-DE|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Roki Tunnel''' (also called '''Roksky Tunnel''', {{lang-ka|როკის გვირაბი}}; [[Ossetic language|Ossetic]]: Ручъы тъунел; {{lang-ru|Рокский туннель}}) is a mountain tunnel of the [[Transkam]] road through the [[Greater Caucasus]] Mountains, north of the village Upper Roka. It is the only road joining [[North Ossetia–Alania]] in the [[Russian Federation]] into [[South Ossetia]], a breakaway republic of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].  The road is manned at the town of [[Nizhny Zaramag]] in North Ossetia and is sometimes referred to as the [[Roki]]-[[Nizhny Zaramag]] border crossing.

The tunnel, completed by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] government in 1984, is one of only a handful of routes that cross the North Caucasus Range. It is at about {{convert|2000|meter|ft}}  altitude and its length is {{convert|3,730|meter|ft}}, and near the Roki Pass at about {{convert|3,000|meter|ft}} altitude, which can only be used in summer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=1218534230819 Der Roki-Tunnel – Schlüsselstelle im Georgien-Konflikt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Structurae.de: Roki Tunnel |publisher=Structurae.de |url=http://en.structurae.de/structures/data/index.cfm?id=s0021059 |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other routes between Georgia and Russia include the [[Kazbegi]]–[[Verkhni Lars]] customs checkpoint on the [[Georgian Military Road]], closed June 2006{{hsp}}&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.msn.com/justicefornorthcaucasus/osetia.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=12992 (accessed 2008-8-10)&lt;/ref&gt; and reopened 2010, and the [[Gantiadi]]–[[Adlersky City District|Adler]] crossing in [[Abkhazia]] which Georgia asserts functions illegally.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?idr=527&amp;id=688852 (accessed 2008-8-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

The tunnel has been important throughout the [[Georgian–Ossetian conflict]]. The South Ossetian authorities use tolls levied on tunnel traffic as one of their main sources of revenue. The Georgian government – backed by the [[United States]] – has long called for the South Ossetian side of the tunnel to be placed under the control of international monitors, rather than by the South Ossetian secessionists and their Russian allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Georgian rebel region evacuates children after deadly clashes |publisher=Channel NewsAsia |date=2008-08-05 |url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_world/view/364929/1/.html |accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Russian authorities blocked the [[Kazbegi]]-[[Verkhni Lars]] customs checkpoint between June 2006 and March 2010, the Roki Tunnel was the only available road route from Russia to South Ossetia. The tunnel was also used as a supply route for the Russian troops during the [[2008 South Ossetia War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Evans |first=Michael |title=Georgia: Reckless Saakashvili took on Russian Goliath Putin |work=[[The Times]] |date=2008-08-11 |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article4500160.ece |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SAGA-EO Project''' ('''S'''upport '''A'''ction to '''G'''MES '''A'''frica on '''E'''arth '''O'''bservation) consists of a [[feasibility study]] on critical pieces of the puzzle of the [[Lisbon Declaration]] Implementation Plan on [[Global Monitoring for Environment and Security|GMES Africa]] and to complement previous experience in that field. The main finding driving the concept is that no project tackles the [[Earth observation]] (EO) field as a global approach (technological, organizational and institutional).

The way to implement this EO capacity-building challenge is to set up dedicated EO networks of users belonging to a same [[Africa]]n country and to link them with existing initiatives in Africa and [[Europe]].

The main purpose and objectives of the SAGA-EO project are to study this organisational model and its associated [[technology]] and to prove that the concept is viable in five African countries through the following actions:
#To closely cooperate with the GMES Africa Coordination Team in the preparation of the EU-AU Join Strategic Partnership action plan;
#To define African national EO user network organisational models;
#To identify generic technological solutions, compatible with existing standards, to receive, archive, share, disseminate, advise on EO data;
#To prove that the concept of the proposed organisational model is realistic (five countries identified);
#To provide recommendation on the necessary steps needed for implementing the African EO user network at national level.

The SAGA-EO project guarantees to achieve those objectives and proposed actions based on the following key issues:
*The knowledge of the African context;
*A strong national political willingness;
*A large panel of actors;
*The [[consortium]];
*High-level national African decision makers;
*Well balanced European and African representatives;
*Senior experts in Earth Observation and applications.

Experienced system architect with in-depth knowledge of methodologies, standards and services organisation
*The strategic guidance of the GMES Africa Coordination Team that will provide the global project orientations according to the GMES Africa [[action plan]] findings;
*A technical Advisory Board that will support the project in achieving its global objectives through independent advices;
*The assessment of the African national EO user network model in countries where the network leader has a clear mandate, a geographical continental representation, and high [[internet access]] rate;
*European and African relevant projects (PUMA, AMESD, GMES, ACP Observatory, …) results and lessons are fully re-used;
*Technology: Earth Observation (exhaustive analysis of imagery and products offer, from low to high resolution), [[telecommunications]], web services,
*Synchronised support to the GMES Africa Coordination Team.

This project is in the frame of the [[Seventh Framework Programme]], Theme 9, Space Call 2, FP7-SPACE-2009-1 of the '''[[European Commission]]'''.

Satellite crop monitoring technology allows to perform online crop monitoring on different fields, located in different areas, regions, even countries and on different continents. The technology's significant advantage is a high automation level of sown area condition and its interpretation in an interactive map which can be read by different groups of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.cropio.com/#top/|title=Cropio – Change the way of farming with Cropio|website=about.Cropio.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astrium-geo.com/en/84-deimos-1-optical-satellite-imagery/|title=DMC Constellation : Airbus Defence and Space|website=www.Astrium-Geo.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precisionagriculture.com.au/|title=For Farmers - Precision Agriculture|website=www.PrecisionAgriculture.com.au|access-date=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satellite crop monitoring technology users are:
* agronomists and agriculture companies management (crop vegetation control, crop yield forecasting, management decisions optimization);
* business owners (business prospects estimates, making reasonable decisions on capital investments, providing information for management decisions);

The '''Shark Alliance''' is a global not-for-profit coalition founded in 2006 by [[Pew Charitable Trusts]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pewtrusts.org/news_room_detail.aspx?id=24350 &lt;/ref&gt; of [[non-governmental organizations]] dedicated to restoring and conserving [[shark]] populations by improving shark conservation policies. 
 
The mission of the Shark Alliance is to secure the following:
*Shark fishing limits in line with scientific advice and the precautionary approach, including stronger policies to prevent shark finning
*Safeguards and conservation guidance for sharks through the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
*A United Nations Resolution that includes ambitious timelines for implementation of the International Plan of Action for Sharks and lays out consequences for inaction

The Shark Alliance was initiated and is coordinated by the Pew Environment Group, the conservation arm of The Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-government organization that is working to end [[overfishing]] in the world's oceans.

==Shark Week==
To raise public awareness about the dramatic decline of shark species and Europe’s role in the process, the Shark Alliance proclaimed 8–14 October 2007 to be the first European Shark Week. Using the slogan 'Every Fin Counts!' members of the public were asked to take part in events and sign a [[petition]] asking the [[Directorate-General for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs (European Commission)|fisheries commission of the EU]] for better regulation to protect sharks. During European Shark Week over 100 events were organised around Europe by Shark Alliance members. At the end of the campaign, over 20,000 signatures were presented to the fisheries commission.

In 2010, the Shark Alliance's Shark Week expanded beyond Europe to include North and South America to raise public awareness around the globe. Eventually, the Shark Alliance's Shark Week will include every region, reaching additional countries every year.

==Member Groups==
As of May 2010 the Shark Alliance consists of 85 [[NGO]]s from over 35 different countries:

'''Sulaiman Al Mahri ibn Ahmad ibn Sulayman''' ({{lang-ar|سليمان المهري ابن أحمد ابن سليمان}}) (1480–1550) was a 16th-century [[Arab]] [[navigator]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Islam, Volume 1 By Masudul Hasan pg. 642&lt;/ref&gt; He was called "Al-Mahri" because he was a descendant of the Arabic tribe of Mahara.

Sulaiman Al Mahri ibn Ahmad ibn Sulayman was born in Shihr in 1480. He was a 16th-century Arab navigator. He was called "Al-Mahri" because he was a descendant of the Arabic tribe of Mahara. He was a student of the philosopher and scientist Ibn Majid and lived during the reign of Ottoman Turks.He died in 1550.

He sailed across the Indian Ocean and wrote a book on the geography of the Indian Ocean and the islands of [[Maritime Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} He is best known for reducing [[Ibn Majids]]'s [[Lists of stars|list of stars]] for navigation from 70 to 15.&lt;ref&gt;Medieval Arab Navigation on the Indian Ocean: Latitude Determinations [[Article (publishing)|Journal article]] by Alfred Clark; [[The Journal of the American Oriental Society]], Vol. 113, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Combinations of these lists of stars were used by Arab navigators and mariners up to the early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Between east and west: the Moluccas and the traffic in spices up to the Arrival of Europeans. Philadelphia: [[American Philosophical Society]] By R. A. Donkin&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th-century Arabic book Kitab al-Fawa'id fi wal al-ilmi al bahri wa'l qawa'id (Book of Useful Information on the Principles and Rules of Navigation) was compiled by [[Ibn Majid]] and his student Sulaiman Al Mahri.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Persian Gulf]] States: a general survey By Alvin J. Cottrell pg 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In his journals, Al Mahri noted the islands off the west coast of Siam (Malaya). The most important destination covered by these navigational texts is Malacca, which had become the region's principal trading center for Arab navigators during the 15th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} [[Singapore]], parts of [[Samarra]], Java, China, the coasts of [[Burma]] and [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] were the fiscal points of his texts.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

He grouped the shores of [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] with [[Siam]], and the mainland to the east with China as a single kingdom. This passage from Al-Mahri's book illustrates the limits of Arab navigators: &lt;blockquote&gt;Know that to the south of the Island of Jawa are found many Islands called [[Timor]] and that to the east of [[Timor]] are the Islands of Bandam, also a large number. The latter are places [[sandalwood]], [[aloeswood]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]]. The island is called Isles of [[Clove]] as airs of Jawa are called [[Maluku islands]].&lt;/blockquote&gt; Since many of the islands have not been identified with confidence, the extent of his travel and familiarity with the region is not known.&lt;ref&gt;Early mapping of Southeast Asia By Thomas Suárez pg. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

Al Mahri's division of [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] into two parts helped [[Arab]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigators.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hind: the making of the Indo-Islamic world By André Wink pg. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the mid-16th century Sidi Ali Celeb translated Al Mahri's texts into [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and embroidered his work.&lt;ref&gt;The Persian Gulf States: a general survey By Alvin J. Cottrell pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most common historical sense, 'Syria' refers to the entire northern [[Levant]], including [[Alexandretta]] and the ancient city of [[Antioch]] or in an extended sense the entire [[Levant]] as far south as [[Roman Egypt]], but not including [[Mesopotamia]]. The area of Greater Syria ({{lang-ar|سُـوِرِيَّـة الْـكُـبْـرَى|Sūriyyah al-Kubrá}}; also "Natural Syria" ({{lang-ar|سُـوْرِيَّـة الـطَّـبِـيْـعِـيَّـة|Sūriyyah aṭ-Ṭabī‘iyyah}}) or "Northern Country" {{lang-ar|بِـلَاد الـشَّـام|Bilād ash-Shām}}))&lt;ref name="Abu Sway 2011"/&gt; extends roughly over the medieval Arab Caliphate province of Bilad al-Sham, encompassing the [[Eastern Mediterranean]] or the Levant, and Western Mesopotamia. The Arab conquest of the Levant in the 7th century gave rise to this province, which encompassed much of the region of Syria, and became largely overlapping with this concept. Other sources indicate that the term Greater Syria was coined during [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], after 1516, to designate the approximate area included in present-day Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, and Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Collelo, ed. [http://countrystudies.us/lebanon/15.htm Lebanon: A Country Study] Washington, Library of Congress, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The uncertainty in the definition of the extent of "Syria" is aggravated with the etymological confusion of the similar-sounding names [[Syria (name)|Syria]] and [[Assyria (name)|Assyria]]. The question of the ultimate etymological identity of the two names remains open today, but regardless of etymology, the two names have often been taken as exchangeable or synonymous from the time of Herodotus.&lt;ref name="Herodotus VII.63"/&gt; In the [[Roman Empire]] Syria and Assyria already referred to two separate entities, [[Roman Syria]] and [[Roman Assyria]].

Killebrew and Steiner, treating the Levant as the Syrian region, gave the boundaries of the region as such: the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the west, the Arabian Desert and Mesopotamia to the east, and the [[Taurus Mountains]] of [[Anatolia]] to the north.&lt;ref name="KillebrewSteiner2014"/&gt;

For [[Pliny the Elder]] and [[Pomponius Mela]], Syria covered the entire [[Fertile Crescent]]. In [[Late Antiquity]], "Syria" meant a region located to the East of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], West of the [[Euphrates River]], North of the [[Arabian Desert]] and South of the [[Taurus Mountains]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Taylor &amp; Francis Group|title=The Middle East and North Africa 2004|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pP315Mw3S9EC&amp;pg=PA1015|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-85743-184-1|page=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby including modern [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Jordan]], [[Israel]], the [[State of Palestine]], and parts of Southern Turkey, namely the [[Hatay Province]] and the Western half of the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]]. This late definition is equivalent to the region known in [[Classical Arabic]] by the name ''{{lang|ar-Latn|ash-Shām}}'' ({{lang-ar|اَلـشَّـام}} {{IPA|/ʔaʃ-ʃaːm/}},&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edomond |author-link=Clifford Edward Bosworth |title=AL-SHĀM" |work=[[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] |volume=9 |year=1997 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means ''the north [country]''&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"/&gt; (from the root ''{{lang|ar-Latn|šʔm}}'' {{lang-ar|شَـأم}} "left, north")). After the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant|Islamic conquest of Byzantine Syria]] in the [[7th century]], the name ''Syria'' fell out of primary use in the region itself, being superseded by the Arabic equivalent ''Shām'', but survived in its original sense in Byzantine and Western European usage, and in Syriac Christian literature. In the [[19th century]] the name Syria was revived in its modern Arabic form to denote the whole of [[Bilad al-Sham]], either as ''Suriyah'' or the modern form ''Suriyya'', which eventually replaced the Arabic name of Bilad al-Sham.&lt;ref name="Salibi2003"&gt;{{cite book |author=Kamal S. Salibi |authorlink=Kamal Salibi |title=A House of Many Mansions: The History of Lebanon Reconsidered |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t_amYLJq4SQC |year=2003 |publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-912-7 |pages=61–62 |quote=To the [[Arabs]], this same territory, which the Roman Empire considered [[Arabia]]n, formed part of what they called Bilad al-Sham, which was their own name for Syria. From the classical perspective however, Syria, including Palestine, formed no more than the western fringes of what was reckoned to be Arabia between the first line of cities and the coast. Since there is no clear dividing line between what are called today the [[Syrian Desert|Syrian]] and [[Arabian desert]]s, which actually form one stretch of arid tableland, the classical concept of what actually constituted Syria had more to its credit geographically than the vaguer Arab concept of Syria as Bilad al-Sham. Under the Romans, there was actually a province of Syria, with its capital at Antioch, which carried the name of the territory. Otherwise, down the centuries, Syria, like Arabia and Mesopotamia, was no more than a geographic expression. In Islamic times, the Arab geographers used the name arabicized as Suriyah, to denote one special region of Bilad al-Sham, which was the middle section of the valley of the Orontes river, in the vicinity of the towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]. They also noted that it was an old name for the whole of Bilad al-Sham which had gone out of use. As a geographic expression, however, the name Syria survived in its original classical sense in [[Byzantine]] and [[Western Europe]]an usage, and also in the [[Syriac literature]] of some of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian churches]], from which it occasionally found its way into [[Christian Arab]]ic usage. It was only in the nineteenth century that the use of the name was revived in its modern Arabic form, frequently as Suriyya rather than the older Suriyah, to denote the whole of Bilad al-Sham: first of all in the Christian Arabic literature of the period, and under the influence of Western Europe. By the end of that century it had already replaced the name of Bilad al-Sham even in [[Muslim]] Arabic usage.}}&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War I]], the name 'Syria' was applied to the [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], and the contemporaneous but short-lived [[Arab Kingdom of Syria]].

The boundaries of the region have changed throughout history, and were last defined in modern times by the proclamation of the short-lived Arab Kingdom of Syria and subsequent definition by French and British mandatory agreement. The area was passed to French and British Mandates following [[World War I]] and divided into [[Greater Lebanon]], various Syrian-mandate states, [[Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. The Syrian-mandate states were gradually unified as the [[State of Syria (1924–30)|State of Syria]] and finally became the independent [[Syria]] in 1946. Throughout this period, [[Syrian nationalism|pan-Syrian nationalists]] advocated for the creation of a Greater Syria. [[Antoun Saadeh]] and his party, the [[Syrian Socialist Nationalist Party]], envisioned "Greater Syria" or "Natural Syria" as encompassing the [[Sinai Peninsula]], [[Cyprus]], modern Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], the [[Ahvaz]] region of [[Iran]], and the [[Kilikia]]n region of Turkey.&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sa'adeh |first=Antoun |author-link=Antoun Saadeh |title=The Genesis of Nations |location=[[Beirut]] |year=2004}} Translated and Reprinted&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TheAtlantic1987"&gt;{{cite web |last=Ya'ari |first=Ehud |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/06/behind-the-terror/376326/ |title=Behind the Terror |website=[[The Atlantic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Name of Syria}}

===Syria===
The oldest attestation of the name 'Syria' is from the 8th century BC in a bilingual inscription in [[Hieroglyphic Luwian]] and [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]]. In this inscription the Luwian word ''Sura/i'' was translated to Phoenician ''ʔšr'' "[[Assyria]]."&lt;ref name="Rollinger2006"&gt;{{citation |last=Rollinger |first=Robert |title=2006 {{!}} The terms "Assyria" and "Syria" Again |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Herodotus]] in the 5th century BC, Syria extended as far north as the Halys (the modern [[Kızılırmak River]]) and as far south as Arabia and Egypt.

The name 'Syria' derives from the [[ancient Greek]] name for Syrians, {{lang-el|Σύριοι}} ''{{transl|grc|Syrioi}}'', which the Greeks applied without distinction to various Near Eastern peoples living under the rule of [[Assyria]]. Modern scholarship confirms the Greek word traces back to the cognate {{lang-el|Ἀσσυρία}}, ''{{transl|grc|[[Assyria]]}}'', ultimately derived from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{transl|akk|[[Assur|Aššur]]}}''.&lt;ref&gt;First proposed by [[Theodor Nöldeke]] in 1881; cf. {{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Syria|title=Syria|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=November 2001|accessdate=2013-01-22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical Arabic pronunciation of Syria is ''{{lang|ar-Latn|Sūriya}}'' (as opposed to the [[Modern Standard Arabic]] pronunciation ''{{lang|ar-Latn|Sūrya}}''). That name was not widely used among Muslims before about 1870, but it had been used by Christians earlier. According to the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], "Syrian" meant "Christian" in [[early Christianity]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In English, "Syrian" historically meant a [[Christianity in Syria|Syrian Christian]] such as [[Ephrem the Syrian]]. Following the declaration of [[Syria]] in 1936, the term "Syrian" became to designate citizens of that state, regardless of ethnicity. The adjective "Syriac" (''{{lang|ar-Latn|suryāni}}'' {{lang-ar|سرياني}}) has come into common use since as an [[ethnonym]] to avoid the ambiguity of "Syrian".

Currently, the Arabic term ''{{lang|ar-Latn|Sūriya}}'' refers to the modern state of [[Syria]], as opposed to the historical region of Syria, but that distinction was not as clear until the mid-20th century.

Moreover; in [[Hebrew]], ''sham'' (&lt;span style="font-family:SBL Hebrew, Ezra SIL SR, Ezra SIL, Cardo, Chrysanthi Unicode, TITUS Cyberbit Basic, Arial Unicode MS, Narkisim, Times New Roman"&gt;&lt;big&gt;שָׁמַ)&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/span&gt; is derived from [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''šamû'' meaning "sky".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Caplice, Richard I.; Snell, Daniel C.|title=Introduction to Akkadian|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=E4QP2wKp-NIC&amp;pg=PA6&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;dq=samu+in+akkadian&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RaluJjaHN9&amp;sig=v-MN6uibQCRJtTcgOFVqQhqeO3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwzezw89bVAhVBObwKHTYfCPAQ6AEIUjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=samu%20in%20akkadian&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 August 2017|year=1988|publisher=Gregorian Biblical BookShop|isbn=9788876535666|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the Hebrew word for the sun is ''[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8121.htm shemesh]'', where "shem/sham" from ''[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/8064.htm shamayim] {{refn|group="note"|In [[Hebrew]], mayim (מַיִם) means "water". In [[Genesis 1:6]] [[Elohim]] separated the "water from the water". The area above the earth was filled by sky-water (''[[Heaven in Judaism|sham-mayim]]'') and the earth below was covered by sea-water ([http://biblehub.com/text/genesis/1-10.htm ''yam-mayim'']). }}'' (Akkadian: ''[https://glosbe.com/en/akk/sky šamû]'') means "sky" and ''[http://biblehub.com/hebrew/784.htm esh]'' (Akkadian: ''[https://glosbe.com/en/akk/fire išātu]'') means "fire", i.e. "sky-fire".

Other sources indicate that the term etymologically means "land of the left hand", referring to the fact that for someone in the [[Hejaz]] facing east, north is to the left (so the name of [[Yemen]] ({{lang|ar|اَلْـيَـمَـن}}, ''al-Yaman'') correspondingly means "the right (side)").&lt;ref name="Volume 9 1997 page 261"/&gt; ''Sham'' comes from the [[Semitic root]] ''[[shin (letter)|shin]]–[[hamza]]–[[mem|mim]]'' {{lang|ar|ش ء م}} (referring to unluckiness, which is traditionally associated with the left), as seen in alternative Arabic spellings such as {{lang|ar|شأم}} and {{lang|ar|شآم}}. The Sham region is sometimes defined as the area that was dominated by [[Damascus]], long an important regional centre.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} —In fact, the word ''{{lang|ar|Latn|ash-Shām}}'' {{lang-ar|الـشَّـام}}, on its own, can refer to the city of [[Damascus]].&lt;ref name="CBC2017Syria"&gt;{{cite news |author=Tardif, P. |title='I won't give up': Syrian woman creates doll to help kids raised in conflict |publisher=[[CBC News]] |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/syrian-refugee-sherbrooke-dolls-fundraiser-1.4289512 |date=2017-09-17 |access-date=2018-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no connection with the name of [[Shem]] son of Noah (whose name appears in Arabic as ''{{lang|ar|Latn|sām}}'' {{lang|ar|سَـام}} with a different initial consonant and without any internal [[glottal stop]] consonant).

===Ancient Syria===
[[Herodotus]] uses {{lang-grc|Συρία}} to refer to the stretch of land from the Halys river, including [[Cappadocia]] (The Histories, I.6) in today's Turkey to the Mount Casius (The Histories, II.158), which Herodotus says is located just south of Lake Serbonis (The Histories, III.5). According to Herodotus various remarks in different locations, he describes Syria to include the entire stretch of Phoenician coastal line as well as cities such Cadytis (Jerusalem) (The Histories III.159).&lt;ref name="Herodotus VII.63"&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=Herodotus |author=Herodotus |title=Herodotus VII.63 |url=http://www.fordham.edu/Halsall/ancient/greek-babylon.html |publisher=[[Fordham University]] |quote=VII.63: The Assyrians went to war with helmets upon their heads made of brass, and plaited in a strange fashion which is not easy to describe. They carried shields, lances, and daggers very like the Egyptian; but in addition they had wooden clubs knotted with iron, and linen corselets. This people, whom the Hellenes call Syrians, are called Assyrians by the barbarians. The Chaldeans served in their ranks, and they had for commander Otaspes, the son of Artachaeus. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hellenistic Syria===
In Greek usage, ''Syria'' and ''Assyria'' were used almost interchangeably, but in the [[Roman Empire]], [[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]] and [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]] came to be used as distinct geographical terms. "Syria" in the Roman Empire period referred to "those parts of the Empire situated between Asia Minor and Egypt", i.e. the western [[Levant]], while "Assyria" was part of the [[Parthian Empire|Persian Empire]], and only very briefly came under Roman control (116–118 AD, marking the historical peak of Roman expansion).

===Roman Syria===

[[File:A28 Sergiopolis-Martirion 562.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins at [[Sergiopolis]]]]

In the Roman era, the term Syria is used to comprise the entire northern Levant and has an uncertain border to the northeast that [[Pliny the Elder]] describes as including, from west to east, the [[Kingdom of Commagene]], [[Sophene]], and [[Adiabene]], "formerly known as Assyria".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Pliny (AD 77) |authorlink=Pliny the Elder |url=http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Pliny_the_Elder/5*.html |title=Natural History |chapter=Book 5 Section 66 |publisher=University of Chicago |isbn=84-249-1901-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:The Scene of the Theater in Palmyra.JPG|thumb|[[Palmyra]], one of ancient Syria's wealthiest cities]]
Various writers used the term to describe the entire Levant region during this period; the New Testament used the name in this sense on numerous occasions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/commentarybible00peakuoft#page/n51/mode/1up], quote "In the time of the Greek predominance it came into use. as it is employed to-day, as the name of the whole western borderland of the Mediterranean, and in the NT it is used several times in that sense (Mt. 4:24, Lk. 2:2, Ac. 15:23,41, 18:18, 21:3, Gal. 1:21)".&lt;/ref&gt;

In 64 BC, [[Roman Syria|Syria]] became a province of the Roman Empire, following the conquest by [[Pompey]]. Roman Syria bordered [[Judea (Roman province)|Judea]] to the south, Anatolian Greek domains to the north, Phoenicia to the West, and was in constant struggle with Parthians to the East.

In 135 AD, Syria-Palaestina became to incorporate the entire Levant and Western Mesopotamia. In 193, the province was divided into Syria proper ([[Coele-Syria]]) and [[Phoenice (Roman province)|Phoenice]]. Sometime between 330 and 350 (likely c. 341), the province of ''[[Euphratensis]]'' was created out of the territory of Syria Coele and the former realm of Commagene, with [[Hierapolis]] as its capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=748}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After c. 415 Syria Coele was further subdivided into Syria I, with the capital remaining at [[Antioch]], and Syria II or Salutaris, with capital at [[Apamea, Syria|Apamea]] on the [[Orontes River]]. In 528, [[Justinian I]] carved out the small coastal province [[Theodorias (province)|Theodorias]] out of territory from both provinces.&lt;ref name="ODB1999"&gt;{{cite book | first = Alexander (Ed.) | last = Kazhdan | title = [[Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium]] | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 1991 | isbn = 978-0-19-504652-6 | page=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bilad al-Sham===
{{main|Bilad al-Sham}}

The region was annexed to the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] after the Muslim victory over the [[Byzantine Empire]] at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]], and became known afterwards by its Arabic name, ''ash-Shām''. During the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], the Shām was divided into five ''[[jund]]s'' or military districts. They were ''[[Jund Dimashq]]'' ({{lang-ar|جُـنْـد دِمَـشْـق}}, Military district of Damascus), ''[[Jund Hims|Jund Ḥimṣ]]'' ({{lang-ar|جُـنْـد حِـمْـص}}), ''[[Jund Filastin|Jund Filasṭīn]]'' ({{lang-ar|جُـنْـد فِـلَـسْـطِـيْـن}}, Military district of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]) and ''[[Jund al-Urdunn]]'' ({{lang-ar|جُـنْـد الْأُرْدُنّ}}, "Military district of Jordan"). Later ''[[Jund Qinnasrin|Jund Qinnasrîn]]'' ({{lang-ar|جُـنْـد قِـنَّـسْـرِيْـن}}) was created out of part of Jund Hims. The city of Damascus was the capital of the Islamic Caliphate, until the rise of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]].&lt;ref name="LeStrange1890"&gt;{{cite book |title=Palestine Under the Moslems: A Description of Syria and the Holy Land from A.D. 650 to 1500 |url=https://archive.org/details/palestineundermo00lestuoft |author=Le Strange, G. |authorlink=Guy Le Strange |publisher=Committee of the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] |location=[[London]] |year=1890 |pages=30–234 |oclc=1004386 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blankinship1994"&gt;{{cite book |last=Blankinship |first=Khalid Yahya |authorlink=Khalid Yahya Blankinship |title=The End of the Jihâd State: The Reign of Hishām ibn ʻAbd al-Malik and the Collapse of the Umayyads |location=Albany, New York |publisher=State University of New York Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jz0Yy053WS4C |pages=47–50 |isbn=0-7914-1827-8 |year=1994 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cobb2001"&gt;{{cite book |title=White Banners: Contention in ‘Abbāsid Syria, 750–880 |first=Paul M. |last=Cobb |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2C6KIBw4F9YC |location=Albany, NY |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=2001 |pages=12–182 |isbn=0-7914-4880-0 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman Syria===
{{main|Ottoman Syria|Damascus Eyalet|Syria Vilayet}}

In the later ages of the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] times, it was divided into [[wilayah]]s or sub-provinces the borders of which and the choice of cities as seats of government within them varied over time. The vilayets or sub-provinces of Aleppo, Damascus, and Beirut, in addition to the two special districts of [[Mount Lebanon]] and [[Jerusalem]]. Aleppo consisted of northern modern-day Syria plus parts of southern [[Turkey]], Damascus covered southern Syria and modern-day Jordan, Beirut covered Lebanon and the Syrian coast from the port-city of [[Latakia]] southward to the [[Galilee]], while Jerusalem consisted of the land south of the Galilee and west of the [[Jordan River]] and the [[Arabah|Wadi Arabah]].

Although the region's population was dominated by [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]], it also contained sizable populations of [[Shi'ite]], [[Alawism|Alawite]] and [[Ismaili]] Muslims, [[Syriac Orthodox]], [[Maronite]], [[Greek Orthodox]], [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Melkite]] Christians, [[Mizrahi Jew|Mizrahi]] Jews and [[Druze]]s.

===Arab Kingdom and French occupation===
{{main|Occupied Enemy Territory Administration|Arab Kingdom of Syria|French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon}}

The [[Occupied Enemy Territory Administration]] (OETA) was a military British and French administration over areas of the former Ottoman Empire between 1917–20, during and following [[World War I]]. It officially ended following the assignment of the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]] at the 19–26 April 1920 [[San Remo conference]].

The Arab Kingdom of Syria was the first modern Arab state to come into existence, but only lasted a little over four months (8 March–24 July 1920). During its brief existence, the kingdom was led by Sharif [[Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca|Hussein bin Ali]]’s son [[Faisal bin Hussein]]. Despite its claims to territory of a [[Greater Syria]], Faisal's government controlled a limited area and was dependent on Britain which, along with France, generally opposed the idea of a Greater Syria and refused to recognise Faisal as its king.&lt;ref&gt;Itamar Rabinovich, Symposium: The Greater-Syria Plan and the Palestine Problem in The Jerusalem Cathedra (1982), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom surrendered to French forces on 24 July 1920.

Following the [[San Remo conference]] and the defeat of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]]'s short-lived monarchy in Syria at the [[Battle of Maysalun]], the French general [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]], in breach of the conditions of the mandate, subdivided the [[French Mandate of Syria]] into six states. They were the states of [[State of Damascus|Damascus]] (1920), [[State of Aleppo|Aleppo]] (1920), [[Alawite State]] (1920), [[Jabal al-Druze (state)|Jabal Druze]] (1921), the autonomous [[State of Hatay|Sanjak of Alexandretta]] (1921) (modern-day [[Hatay Province|Hatay]] in Turkey), and [[Greater Lebanon]] (1920) which later became the modern country of [[Lebanon]].

'''Terra Australis''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''South Land'') is a hypothetical [[continent]] first posited in [[Classical antiquity|antiquity]] and which appeared on maps between the 15th and 18th centuries. The existence of Terra Australis was not based on any survey or direct observation, but rather on the idea that continental land in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] should be balanced by land in the [[Southern hemisphere|south]].&lt;ref name=Wilford&gt;John Noble Wilford: The Mapmakers, the Story of the Great Pioneers in Cartography from Antiquity to Space Age, p. 139, Vintage Books, Random House 1982, {{ISBN|0-394-75303-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This theory of balancing land has been documented as early as the 5th century on maps by [[Macrobius]], who uses the term Australis on his maps.&lt;ref&gt;Ambrosius Aurelius Theodosius Macrobius, [https://dx.doi.org/10.7891/e-manuscripta-16478 ''Zonenkarte'']. Retrieved 7 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other names==

Other names for the hypothetical continent have included '''''Terra Australis Ignota''''', '''''Terra Australis Incognita''''' ("the unknown land of the south") or '''''Terra Australis Nondum Cognita''''' ("the southern land not yet known"). Other names were '''''[[Brasil (mythical island)|Brasiliae Australis]]''''' ("the south of Brazil"), and  '''''Magellanica''''' ("the land of [[Ferdinand Magellan|Magellan]]").

==Change of Name==

During the eighteenth century, today's [[Australia]] was not mistaken for ''Terra Australis'', as it sometimes was in the twentieth century. [[James Cook|Captain Cook]] and his contemporaries always referred to the whole of the fifth continent (today's Australia) as [[New Holland (Australia)|''New Holland'']], and to the imagined (but still undiscovered) sixth continent (today's [[Antarctica]]) as ''the Southern Continent'' or ''Terra Australis'', sometimes shortened to ''Australia''. In the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in [[Sydney]] re-allocated the name ''Australia'' to New Holland. Thereafter, its centuries-old Dutch name eventually disappeared and, for some eighty years, the south polar continent was nameless until ''Antarctica'' was coined &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty: Captain Cook's Endeavour Voyage |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |location=Sydney |isbn=9780648043966 |page=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the early 1800s, [[European maritime exploration of Australia|British explorer]] [[Matthew Flinders]] popularized the [[Name of Australia|naming of Australia]] after ''Terra Australis'', giving his rationale that there was "no probability" of finding any significant land mass anywhere more south than Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Flinders, [http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/encounter/collection/B12985211_259_3.htm ''A voyage to Terra Australis'' (Introduction)]. Retrieved 25 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  The continent that would come to be named [[Antarctica]] would be explored decades after Flinders' 1814 book on Australia, which he had titled ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]]'', and after his naming switch had gained popularity.

==Origins of Terra Australis==
Aristotle speculated, "Now since there must be a region bearing the same relation to the southern pole as the place we live in bears to our pole...".&lt;ref&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/meteorology.2.ii.html ''Meteorologica'' Book II 5]&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas were later expanded by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century AD), who believed that the [[Indian Ocean]] was enclosed on the south by land, and that the lands of the [[Northern Hemisphere]] should be balanced by land in the [[Southern hemisphere|south]].&lt;ref name=Wilford /&gt; [[Marcus Tullius Cicero]] used the term ''cingulus australis'' ("southern zone") in referring to the Antipodes in ''[[Somnium Scipionis]]'' ("Dream of Scipio").&lt;ref&gt;Duo [cingulis] sunt habitabiles, quorum australis ille, in quo qui insistunt adversa vobis urgent vestigia, nihil ad vestrum genus ("Two of them [the five belts or zones that gird and surround the earth] are habitable, of which the southern, whose inhabitants are your antipodes, bears no relation to your people"). Alfred Hiatt, "Terra Australis and the Idea of the Antipodes", Anne M. Scott (ed), ''European Perceptions of Terra Australis,'' Ashgate Publishing, 2012, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–10.&lt;/ref&gt; The land (''terra'' in Latin) in this zone was the ''Terra Australis''.&lt;ref&gt;William Eisler,''The Furthest Shore: Images of Terra Australis from the Middle Ages to Captain Cook,'' Cambridge University Press, 1995, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Legends of Terra Australis Incognita—an "unknown land of the South"—date back to Roman times and before, and were commonplace in medieval geography, although not based on any documented knowledge of the continent. Ptolemy's maps, which became well known in Europe during the [[Renaissance]], did not actually depict such a continent, but they did show an Africa which had no southern oceanic boundary (and which therefore might extend all the way to the South Pole), and also raised the possibility that the [[Indian Ocean]] was entirely enclosed by land. Christian thinkers did not discount the idea that there might be land beyond the southern seas, but the issue of [[Antipodes#Historical significance|whether it could be inhabited was controversial]].

The first depiction of Terra Australis on a globe was probably on [[Johannes Schöner]]'s lost 1523 globe on which [[Oronce Fine]] is thought to have based his 1531 double cordiform (heart-shaped) map of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Albert-Marie-Ferdinand Anthiaume, "Un pilote et cartographe havrais au XVIe siècle: Guillaume Le Testu", ''Bulletin de Géographie Historique et Descriptive,'' Paris, Nos 1–2, 1911, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–202, n.b. p.&amp;nbsp;176.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Wieser, ''Magalhães-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Schöner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert,'' Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967)&lt;/ref&gt; On this landmass he wrote "recently discovered but not yet completely explored".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pelletier|first=Monique|title=The cordiform World maps by Oronce Fine|journal=Cartographica Helvetica|year=1995|volume=12|pages=27–37|url=http://www.kartengeschichte.ch/ch/summaries/e12d.html|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of water beyond the tip of South America is called the “Mare Magellanicum,” one of the first uses of navigator Ferdinand Magellan's name in such a context.&lt;ref name=Fineus&gt;Orontius Fineus: Rare Book and Special Collections Division, Library of Congress, 1531, (147.03.00)&lt;/ref&gt;

Schöner called the continent ''Brasiliae Australis'' in his 1533 tract, ''Opusculum geographicum''. In it, he explained: &lt;blockquote&gt;Brasilia Australis is an immense region toward Antarcticum, newly discovered but not yet fully surveyed, which extends as far as Melacha and somewhat beyond. The inhabitants of this region lead good, honest lives and are not Anthropophagi [cannibals] like other barbarian nations; they have no letters, nor do they have kings, but they venerate their elders and offer them obedience; they give the name Thomas to their children [after [[Saint Thomas the Apostle|St Thomas the Apostle]]]; close to this region lies the great island of Zanzibar at 102.00 degrees and 27.30 degrees South.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Schoener, ''Opusculum Geographicum,'' Norimberga, [1533], Pt.II, cap.xx. [https://books.google.com/books?id=EYMEAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=Braziliae&amp;f=false Ioannis Schoneri ... Opusculum geographicum ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Putting Australia on the Map.ogv|thumb|left|Discussion of various names used for Australia over time.]]
Explorers of the [[Age of Discovery]], from the late 15th century on, proved that Africa was almost entirely surrounded by sea, and that the Indian Ocean was accessible from both west and east.  These discoveries reduced the area where the continent could be found; however, many cartographers held to Aristotle's opinion. Scientists, such as [[Gerardus Mercator]] (1569)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zuber|first=Mike A.|date=2011|title=The Armchair Discovery of the Unknown Southern Continent: Gerardus Mercator, Philosophical Pretensions and a Competitive Trade|url=https://www.academia.edu/1910165/The_Armchair_Discovery_of_the_Unknown_Southern_Continent_Gerardus_Mercator_Philosophical_Pretensions_and_a_Competitive_Trade|journal=Early Science and Medicine|volume=16|pages=505–541|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alexander Dalrymple]] as late as 1767&lt;ref name=Wilford /&gt; argued for its existence, with such arguments as that there should be a large [[landmass]] in the [[Southern Hemisphere|south]] as a [[counterweight]] to the known landmasses in the Northern Hemisphere. As new lands were discovered, they were often assumed to be parts of the hypothetical continent.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos Pedro Vairo, TERRA AUSTRALIS Historical Charts of Patagonia, Tierra del Fuego and Antarctica. Ed. Zagier &amp; Urruty Publicationa, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German cosmographer and mathematician [[Johannes Schöner]] (1477–1547) constructed a terrestrial globe in 1515, based on the world map and globe made by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] and his colleagues at St. Dié in Lorraine in 1507. Where Schöner departs most conspicuously from Waldseemüller is in his globe's depiction of an Antarctic continent, called by him Brasilie Regio. His continent is based, however tenuously, on the report of an actual voyage: that of the Portuguese merchants Nuno Manuel and [[Christopher de Haro|Cristóvão de Haro]] to the [[Río de la Plata|River Plate]], and related in the ''Newe Zeytung auss Presillg Landt'' (“New Tidings from the Land of Brazil”) published in Augsburg in 1514.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblio.wdfiles.com/local--files/schuller-1915-nova/schuller_1915_nova.pdf Newen Zeytung auss Presillg Landt]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Zeytung'' described the Portuguese voyagers passing through a strait between the southernmost point of America, or Brazil, and a land to the south west, referred to as ''vndtere Presill'' (or ''Brasilia inferior'').

This supposed “strait” was in fact the Rio de la Plata (or the [[San Matias Gulf]]). By “vndtere Presill”, the Zeytung meant that part of Brazil in the lower latitudes, but Schöner mistook it to mean the land on the southern side of the “strait”, in higher latitudes, and so gave to it the opposite meaning. On this slender foundation he constructed his circum-Antarctic continent to which, for the reasons that he does not explain, he gave an annular, or ring shape. In an accompanying explanatory treatise, ''Luculentissima quaedam terrae totius descriptio'' (“A Most Lucid Description of All Lands”), he explained: “The Portuguese, thus, sailed around this region, the Brasilie Regio, and discovered the passage very similar to that of our Europe (where we reside) and situated laterally between east and west.

From one side the land on the other is visible; and the cape of this region about 60 miles away, much as if one were sailing eastward through the Straits of Gibraltar or Seville and Barbary or Morocco in Africa, as our Globe shows toward the Antarctic Pole. Further, the distance is only moderate from this Region of Brazil to Malacca, where St. Thomas was crowned with martyrdom.” .&lt;ref&gt;[[Chet van Duzer]], ''Johann Schöner's Globe of 1515: Transcription and Study,'' Philadelphia, American Philosophical Society, ''Transactions,'' Volume 100, Part 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

On this scrap of information, united with the concept of the Antipodes inherited from Graeco-Roman antiquity, Schöner constructed his representation of the southern continent. His strait served as inspiration for [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s expedition to reach the Moluccas by a westward route.&lt;ref&gt;Franz von Wieser, ''Magalhães-Strasse und Austral-Continent. Auf den Globen Johannes Schöner. Beitrage zur Geschichte der Erdkunde im xvi. Jahrhundert,'' Innsbruck, 1881 (reprinted Amsterdam, Meridian, 1967), p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

He took Magellan's discovery of Tierra del Fuego in 1520 as further confirmation of its existence, and on his globes of 1523 and 1533 he described it as &lt;small&gt;''TERRA AVSTRALIS RECENTER INVENTA SED NONDUM PLENE COGNITA&lt;/small&gt;'' (“Terra Australis, recently discovered but not yet fully known”). It was taken up by his followers, the French cosmographer [[Oronce Fine]] in his world map of 1531, and the Flemish cartographers [[Gerardus Mercator]] in 1538 and [[Abraham Ortelius]] in 1570. Schöner's concepts influenced the [[Dieppe]] school of mapmakers, notably in their representation of [[Jave la Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;Armand Rainaud, ''Le Continent Austral: Hypotheses et Découvertes,'' Paris, Colin, 1893 (repr. Amsterdam, Meridian Pub. Co., 1965), p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Le Testu 1556 4th projection.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Guillaume Le Testu]]'s 1556 ''Cosmographie Universel'', 4me projection, where the northward extending promontory of the ''Terre australle'' is called ''Grande Jaue''.]]
''Terra Australis'' was depicted on the mid-16th-century [[Dieppe maps]], where its coastline appeared just south of the islands of the East Indies; it was often elaborately charted, with a wealth of fictitious detail. There was much interest in Terra Australis among [[Normandy|Norman]] and [[Brittany|Breton]] merchants at that time. In 1566 and 1570, Francisque and [[André d'Albaigne]] presented [[Gaspard II de Coligny|Gaspard de Coligny]], Admiral of France, with projects for establishing relations with the Austral lands. Although the Admiral gave favourable consideration to these initiatives, they came to nought when Coligny was [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|killed in 1572]].&lt;ref&gt;E.T.

[[Image:Mercator World Map.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Terra Australis occupies a large part of the southern hemisphere. 1587.]]

Gerardus Mercator believed in the existence of a large Southern continent on the basis of cosmographic reasoning, set out in the abstract of his ''Atlas or Cosmographic Studies in Five Books,'' as related by his biographer, Walter Ghim, who said that even though Mercator was not ignorant that the Austral continent still lay hidden and unknown, he believed it could be "demonstrated and proved by solid reasons and arguments to yield in its geometric proportions, size and weight, and importance to neither of the other two, nor possibly to be lesser or smaller, otherwise the constitution of the world could not hold together at its centre".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ghim, "Vita…Gerardi Mercatoris Rupelmundani", ''Gerardi Mercatoris Atlas sive Cosmographice Meditationes de Fabrica Mundi et Fabricate Figura,'' Amsterdami, 1606, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Flemish geographer and cartographer, [[Cornelius Wytfliet]], wrote concerning the ''Terra Australis'' in his 1597 book, ''Descriptionis Ptolemaicae Augmentum: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The terra Australis is therefore the southernmost of all other lands, directly beneath the antarctic circle; extending beyond the tropic of Capricorn to the West, it ends almost at the equator itself, and separated by a narrow strait lies on the East opposite to New Guinea, only known so far by a few shores because after one voyage and another that route has been given up and unless sailors are forced and driven by stress of winds it is seldom visited. The terra Australis begins at two or three degrees below the equator and it is said by some to be of such magnitude that if at any time it is fully discovered they think it will be the fifth part of the world.

Adjoining Guinea on the right are the numerous and vast Solomon Islands which lately became famous by the voyage of Alvarus Mendanius.&lt;ref&gt;Australis igitur terra omnium aliarum terrarum australissima, directe subiecta antarctico circulo, Tropicum Capricorni vltra ad Occidentem excurrens, in ipfo penè aequatore finitur, tenuique difcreta freto Nouam Guineam Orienti obijcit, paucis tãtum hactenus littoribus cognitam, quòd post vnam atque alteram nauigationem, curfus ille intermissus fit, &amp; nisi coactis impulsifquc nautis ventorum turbine, rarius eò adnauigetur.

[[Juan Fernández (explorer)|Juan Fernandez]], sailing from Chile in 1576, claimed he had discovered the Southern Continent.&lt;ref&gt;José Toribio Medina, ''El Piloto Juan Fernandez,'' Santiago de Chile, 1918, reprinted by Gabriela Mistral, 1974, pp.&amp;nbsp;136, 246.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Polus Antarcticus'' map of 1641 by [[Hendrik Hondius II|Henricus Hondius]], bears the inscription: ''”Insulas esse a Nova Guinea usque ad Fretum Magellanicum affirmat Hernandus Galego, qui ad eas explorandas missus fuit a Rege Hispaniae Anno 1576'' (Hernando Gallego, who in the year 1576 was sent by the King of Spain to explore them, affirms that there are islands from New Guinea up to the Strait of Magellan)”.&lt;ref&gt;An on-line image of this map is at: http://nla.gov.au/nla.map-t732.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Luis Váez de Torres]], a [[Galician people|Galician]] or [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigator who commanded the ''San Pedro y San Pablo'', the ''San Pedrico'' and the tender or yacht, ''Los Tres Reyes Magos'' during the 1605–1606 expedition led by [[Pedro Fernandes de Queiros]] in quest of the Southern Continent, proved the existence of a passage south of New Guinea, now known as [[Torres Strait]]. Commenting on this in 1622, the Dutch cartographer and publisher of Queiros' eighth memorial, [[Hessel Gerritsz]], noted on his ''Map of the Pacific Ocean:'' "Those who sailed with the yacht of Pedro Fernando de Quiros in the neighbourhood of New Guinea to 10 degrees westward through many islands and shoals and over 23 and 24 fathoms for as many as 40 days, estimated that Nova Guinea does not extend beyond 10 degrees to the south; if this be so, then the land from 9 to 14 degrees would be a separate land".&lt;ref&gt;Hessel Gerritsz (c. 1581–1632), ''Map of the Pacific Ocean,'' 1622, Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris, département des Cartes et Plans, SH, Arch. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pedro Fernandes de Queirós]], another Portuguese navigator sailing for the Spanish Crown, saw a large island south of New Guinea in 1606, which he named La Austrialia del Espiritu Santo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sl.nsw.gov.au/stories/spanish-quest-terra-australis |title=The Spanish quest for Terra Australis | publisher=State Library of New South Wales |accessdate=2018-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He represented this to the King of [[Spain]] as the Terra Australis incognita. In his 10th Memorial (1610), Queirós said: "It should be noted that New Guinea is the top end of the Austral Land of which I treat [discuss], and that people, and customs, with all the rest referred to, resemble them".&lt;ref&gt;[http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/_transcript/2014/D23411/a6314001.pdf Translation by Dolores Turró of Memorial No. 10]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dutch father and son Isaac and [[Jacob Le Maire]] established the Australische Compagnie (Australian Company) in 1615 to trade with Terra Australis, which they called "Australia".&lt;ref&gt;''Spieghel der Australische Navigatie;'' cited by A. Lodewyckx, "The Name of Australia: Its Origin and Early Use", ''The Victorian Historical Magazine,'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;XIII, No.&amp;nbsp;3, June 1929, pp.&amp;nbsp;100–191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cartographic depictions of the southern continent in the 16th and early 17th centuries, as might be expected for a concept based on such abundant conjecture and minimal data, varied wildly from map to map; in general, the continent shrank as potential locations were reinterpreted.  At its largest, the continent included [[Tierra del Fuego]], separated from South America by a small strait; [[New Guinea]]; and what would come to be called [[Australia]].  In Ortelius's atlas ''Theatrum Orbis Terrarum'', published in 1570, Terra Australis extends north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Pacific Ocean.

As long as it appeared on maps at all, the continent minimally included the unexplored lands around the [[South Pole]], but generally much larger than the real [[Antarctica]], spreading far north&amp;nbsp;– especially in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. [[New Zealand]], first seen by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] explorer [[Abel Tasman]] in 1642, was regarded by some as a part of the continent.

[[Alexander Dalrymple]], the Examiner of Sea Journals for the English [[East India Company]],&lt;ref&gt;Howard T. Fry, ''Alexander Dalrymple (1737–1808) and the Expansion of British Trade,'' London, Cass for the Royal Commonwealth Society, 1970, pp.&amp;nbsp;229–230.&lt;/ref&gt; whilst translating some Spanish documents [[British occupation of Manila|captured in the Philippines in 1762]], found de Torres's testimony.  This discovery led Dalrymple to publish the ''Historical Collection of the Several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean'' in 1770–1771. Dalrymple presented a beguiling tableau of the Terra Australis, or Southern Continent:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The number of inhabitants in the Southern Continent is probably more than 50 millions, considering the extent, from the eastern part discovered by Juan Fernandez, to the western coast seen by Tasman, is about 100 deg. of longitude, which in the latitude of 40 deg. amounts to 4596 geographic, or 5323 stature miles. This is a greater extent than the whole civilized part of Asia, from Turkey to the eastern extremity of China. There is at present no trade from Europe thither, though the scraps from this table would be sufficient to maintain the power, dominion, and sovereignty of Britain, by employing all its manufacturers and ships. Whoever considers the Peruvian empire, where arts and industry flourished under one of the wisest systems of government, which was founded by a stranger, must have very sanguine expectations of the southern continent, from whence it is more than probable Mango Capac, the first Inca, was derived, and must be convinced that the country, from whence Mango Capac introduced the comforts of civilized life, cannot fail of amply rewarding the fortunate people who shall bestow letters instead of quippos ([[quipus]]), and iron in place of more awkward substitutes.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Dalrymple, ''An Historical Collection of the several Voyages and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean,'' Vol.I, London, 1769 and 1770, pp.&amp;nbsp;xxviii–xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Dalrymple's claim of the existence of an unknown continent aroused widespread interest and prompted the British government in 1769 to order [[James Cook]] in [[HM Bark Endeavour|HM Bark ''Endeavour'']] to seek out the Southern Continent to the South and West of [[Tahiti]], discovered in June 1767 by [[Samuel Wallis]] in ''[[HMS Dolphin (1751)|HMS Dolphin]]'' and named by him King George Island.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Cook, Introduction to ''An account of the discoveries made in the South Pacifick Ocean&amp;nbsp;/ by Alexander Dalrymple'' ; first printed in 1767, reissued with a foreword by Kevin Fewster and an essay by Andrew Cook, Potts Point (NSW), Hordern House Rare Books for the Australian National Maritime Museum, 1996, pp.&amp;nbsp;38–9.&lt;/ref&gt; The London press reported in June 1768 that two ships would be sent to the newly discovered island and from there to "attempt the Discovery of the Southern Continent".&lt;ref&gt;''The St. James's Chronicle'', 11 June and ''The Public Advertiser,'' 13 June 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent press report stated: "We are informed, that the Island which Captain Wallis has discovered in the South-Sea, and named George's Land, is about fifteen hundred Leagues to the Westward and to Leeward of the Coast of Peru, and about five-and-thirty Leagues in circumference; that its principal and almost sole national Advantage is, its Situation for exploring the Terra Incognita of the Southern Hemisphere. The Endeavour, a North-Country Cat, is purchased by the Government, and commanded by a Lieutenant of the Navy; she is fitting out at Deptford for the South-Sea, thought to be intended for the newly-discovered Island".&lt;ref&gt;''The St. James's Chronicle, 18 June, ''The Gazetteer,'' 20 June and' 'The Westminster Journal,'' 25 June 1768''.&lt;/ref&gt; The aims of the expedition were revealed in days following: "To-morrow morning Mr. Banks, Dr. Solano [sic], with Mr. Green, the Astronomer, will set out for Deal, to embark on board the Endeavour, Capt. Cook, for the South Seas, under the direction of the Royal Society, to observe the Transit of Venus next summer, and to make discoveries to the South and West of Cape Horn".&lt;ref&gt;''Lloyd's Evening Post,'' 5 August, ''The St. James's Chronicle,'' 6 August, ''Courier du Bas-Rhin'' (Cleves), 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; The London ''Gazetteer'' was more explicit when it reported on 18 August 1768: “The gentlemen, who are to sail in a few days for George's Land, the new discovered island in the Pacific ocean, with an intention to observe the Transit of Venus, are likewise, we are credibly informed, to attempt some new discoveries in that vast unknown tract, above the latitude 40”.&lt;ref&gt;Also in ''Lloyd's Evening Post,'' 19 August and ''The New York Journal,'' 3 November 1768.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this [[first voyage of James Cook]] in respect of the quest for the Southern Continent were summed up by Cook himself. He wrote in his Journal on 31 March 1770 that the ''Endeavour's'' voyage "must be allowed to have set aside the most, if not all, the Arguments and proofs that have been advanced by different Authors to prove that there must be a Southern Continent; I mean to the Northward of 40 degrees South, for what may lie to the Southward of that Latitude I know not".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8106/8106-h/8106-h.htm#ch6 W.J.L.

==Decline of the idea==
[[Image:terraaustralis.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The available territory for a southern continent had diminished greatly in this 1657 map by [[Jan Janssonius]]. ''Terra Australis Incognita'' ("unknown southern land") is printed across a region including the south pole without any definite shorelines.]]
Over the centuries the idea of Terra Australis gradually lost its hold. In 1615, [[Jacob le Maire]] and [[Willem Schouten]]'s rounding of [[Cape Horn]] proved that [[Tierra del Fuego]] was a relatively small island, while in 1642 [[Abel Tasman]]'s first Pacific voyage proved that Australia was not part of the mythical southern continent. Much later, [[James Cook]] sailed around most of New Zealand in 1770, showing that even it could not be part of a large continent. On his [[Second_voyage_of_James_Cook|second voyage]] he [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the globe at a very high southern [[latitude]], at some places even crossing the south [[polar circle]], showing that any possible southern continent must lie well within the cold polar areas.&lt;ref name="Wales"/&gt; There could be no extension into regions with a [[temperate climate]], as had been thought before. In 1814, [[Matthew Flinders]] published the book ''[[A Voyage to Terra Australis]].'' Flinders had concluded that the Terra Australis as hypothesized by [[Aristotle]] and [[Ptolemy]] did not exist, so he wanted the name applied to what he saw as the next best thing: "[[Australia]]". He wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;
There is no probability, that any other detached body of land, of nearly equal extent, will ever be found in a more southern latitude; the name Terra Australis will, therefore, remain descriptive of the geographical importance of this country, and of its situation on the globe: it has antiquity to recommend it; and, having no reference to either of the two claiming nations, appears to be less objectionable than any other which could have been selected.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
...with the accompanying note at the bottom of the page:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Had I permitted myself any innovation upon the original term, it would have been to convert it into AUSTRALIA; as being more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Flinders, ''A Voyage to Terra Australis,'' London, Nicol, 1814, Vol.&amp;nbsp;I, p.&amp;nbsp;iii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His conclusion would soon be revealed as a mistake, but by that time the name had stuck.&lt;ref&gt;Avan Judd Stallard, "Origins of the Idea of Antipodes: Errors, Assumptions, and a Bare Few Facts", ''Terrae Incognitae,'' Volume 42, Number 1, September 2010, pp.&amp;nbsp;34–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Province of Beach==

A land feature known as the "Province of Beach" or "Boeach" – from the Latin ''Provincia boëach'' – appears to have resulted from mistranscriptions of a name in Marco Polo's ''[[Il Milione]]'' (Book III). Polo described his journey by sea from China to India by way of [[Champa]] (''provincia ciamba''; modern southern Vietnam),  ''[[Jave la Grande|Java Major]]''), ''Locach'' (modern [[Lop Buri]]),&lt;ref&gt;Lavo (Thai ลพบร) was named after Lavo, the son of [[Rama]] in [[Hindu mythology]]). (G. E. Gerini, ''Researches on Ptolemy's geography of Eastern Asia (further India and Indo-Malay archipelago),'' London, Royal Asiatic Society, Asiatic Society Monographs vol.1, 1909, p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt;   and [[Sumatra]] (''Java Minor''). In [[Cantonese]], Lavo was pronounced “Lo-huk” 羅斛  and ''Locach'' was Marco Polo's transcription of this name.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on [[Marco Polo]],'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, pp.&amp;nbsp;768–9, note 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Polo, Locach was a kingdom where gold was “so plentiful that no one who did not see it could believe it”. Polo's narrative describes the route southward from Champa toward [[Sumatra]], but by a slip of the pen the name “Java” (which Polo did not himself visit) was substituted for “Champa” as the point of departure,&lt;ref&gt;''Milione: il Milione nelle redazioni toscana e franco–italiana, Le Divisament dou Monde,'' Gabriella Ponchi (ed.), Milano, Arnoldo Mondadori Editore, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;540: cap. clxiii, "La grant isle de Java".&lt;/ref&gt; thereby mis-locating Sumatra  and Lochach south of Java (rather than Champa). Consequently, some geographers believed that Sumatra and Lochcach were near, or extensions of, ''Terra Australis''.&lt;ref&gt;James R. McClymont, "The Theory of an Antipodal Southern Continent during the Sixteenth Century", ''Report of the Fourth Meeting of the Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science,'' Hobart, January 1892, Hobart, the Association, 1893, pp.&amp;nbsp;442–462; Paul Pelliot, ''Notes on Marco Polo,'' Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 1963, Vol.II, p.&amp;nbsp;769.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Kurrent|German cursive script]], ''Locach'' and ''Boeach'' look similar. A feature known as the "Province of Beach" or "Boeach" – from the Latin ''Provincia boëach'' – appears on European maps as early as the 15th century. On a map of the world published in Florence in 1489 by [[Henricus Martellus]], the Latin name ''provincia boëach'' is given to a southern neighbour of Champa. In fact, by 1532, in an edition of [[The Travels of Marco Polo|Marco Polo's ''Travels'']], Locach was changed to ''Boëach'', later shortened to ''Beach''.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Grynaeus and Johann Huttich, ''Novus Orbis Regionum ac Insularum,'' Basel and Paris, 1532, Marco Polo cap.xi, "De provincia Boëach"; cited in Thomas Suarez, ''Early Mapping of Southeast Asia,'' Hong Kong, Periplus, 1999, p.&amp;nbsp;160.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-16th century, according to [[Henry Yule]], the editor of a modern (1921) edition of Polo's ''Travels'', some geographers and cartographers followed the error in older editions of Polo that "placed ... the land of “Boeach” (or Locac)" south-east of Java and "introduced in their maps a continent in that situation”.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Henry Yule (ed.), ''The Book of Ser Marco Polo,'' London, Murray, 1921, Volume 2, pp.&amp;nbsp;276–280.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerard Mercator]] did just that on his 1541 globe,  placing ''Beach provincia aurifera'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province”) in the northernmost part of the ''Terra Australis'' in accordance with the faulty text of Marco Polo's ''Travels''. The landmass of Beach remained in this location on Mercator's world map of 1569, with the amplified description, quoting Marco Polo, ''Beach provincia aurifera quam pauci ex alienis regionibus adeunt propter gentis inhumanitatem'' (“Beach the gold-bearing province, wither few go from other countries because of the inhumanity of its people”) with ''Lucach regnum'' shown somewhat to its south west.&lt;ref&gt;Peter van der Krogt, ''Globi Neerlandici: The Production of Globes in the Low Countries,'' Utrecht, HES Publishers, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;64, plate 2.14.&lt;/ref&gt; Following Mercator, [[Abraham Ortelius]] also showed &lt;small&gt;''BEACH''&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;''LVCACH''&lt;/small&gt; in these locations on his world map of 1571.

In 1596, on a popular map by [[Jan Huygen van Linschoten]], showed  &lt;small&gt;''BEACH''&lt;/small&gt; and &lt;small&gt;''LOCACH''&lt;/small&gt;, projecting from the map's southern edge as the northernmost parts of the ''Terra Australis'' long hypothesized by Europeans.  Ironically, an accidental encounter by the Dutch vessel ''Eendracht'', commanded by [[Dirk Hartog]], with [[Shark Bay, Western Australia]] in 1616, appeared to confirm that land existed where the maps showed ''Beach''; Hartog named the wider  landmass ''[[Eendrachtsland]]'', after his ship. Nevertheless, the old name persisted for some time: in August 1642, the Council of the [[Dutch East India Company]] – evidently still relying on Linschoten's map – despatched [[Abel Tasman]] and [[Franchoijs Jacobszoon Visscher]] on a voyage of exploration to areas, including Beach and its purported gold,  between the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and [[Staten Land]] (near [[Cape Horn]]) and south of the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt; which one of the objects was to obtain knowledge of "all the totally unknown provinces of Beach".&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Heeres, "Abel Janszoon Tasman, His Life and Labours", ''Abel Tasman's Journal,'' Los Angeles, 1965, pp.&amp;nbsp;137, 141–2; cited in Andrew Sharp, ''The Voyages of Abel Janszoon Tasman,'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1968, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antarctica==
[[Antarctica]] was finally [[History of Antarctica#First sighting|sighted]] in the hypothetical area of Terra Australis in 1820. The extent of Terra Australis was finally determined, also proving the [[Southern Hemisphere]] has much less land than the Northern. Terra Australis proved to consist of only two small continents: [[Antarctica]] and [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].

==In fiction==
The unexplored southern continent was a frequent subject of fantastic fiction in the 17th and 18th centuries in the [[Imaginary voyages]] genre. Among the works which dealt with imaginary visits to the continent (which at the time was still believed to be real) were:
* ''[[Mundus alter et idem]], sive Terra Australis antehac semper incognita lustrata'' (1605), a satirical Latin work by [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]], Bishop of Norwich.
* ''The Isle of Pines, or, A late discovery of a fourth island near Terra Australis incognita, by Henry Cornelius van Sloetten'' (1668) by Henry Neville.
* ''La terre australe connue'' (1676) by [[Gabriel de Foigny]].
* ''Histoire des Sevarambes'' (1675–1679) by [[Denis Vairasse|Denis Vairasse d'Allais]].
* ''Voyages et avantures de Jaques Massé'' (c. 1715, falsely dated 1710) by Tyssot de Patot.
* ''Miscellanea aurea: The Fortunate Shipwreck, or a description of New Athens in Terra Australis incognita'' (1720) by Thomas Killigrew.
* ''Relation d'un voyage du Pole Arctique, au Pole Antarctique par le centre du monde'' (1721), anonymous.
* ''Relation du royaume des Féliciens'' (1727) by the Marquis de Lassay.
* ''Viaggi di Enrico Wanton alle Terre incognite Australi'' (1749) by Zaccaria Seriman.
* ''Voyage de Robertson, aux Terres Australes, traduit sur le manuscrit anglois'' (1767), anonymous.
* ''La découverte australe par un homme-volant'' (1781) by [[Nicolas-Edme Rétif|Restif de la Bretonne]].
* The idea of ''Terra Australis'' was also used by [[Terry Pratchett]] in his [[Discworld]] series of novels (1983–2014) where the World is balanced by the strange and little known [[Counterweight Continent]].

Pictured (l-r) [[Thomas C. Fuller]], Wilbur F. Stone, Chief Justice [[Joseph R. Reed]], Henry C. Sluss, and William W. Murray]]
The ''' United States Court of Private Land Claims''' (1891–1904), was a [[United States]] court created to decide land claims guaranteed by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], in the [[New Mexico Territory|territories of New Mexico]], [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]], and [[Utah Territory|Utah]], and in the states of [[Nevada]], [[Colorado]], and [[Wyoming]].

==Origins==
[[File:San-Miguel-del-Bado-Grant-New-Mexico-Map-1894.png|thumb|left|Map of the San Miguel del Bado Grant in central New Mexico, from the United States Court of Private Land Claims, Julian Sandoval Case 25 (1894–1902).]]
During Spanish (1598–1821) and Mexican (1821–1846) rule over what was to become the [[Southwestern United States|U.S. Southwest]], the governments made [[land grant]]s to various individuals and communities. Under the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848), which ended the [[Mexican–American War]], the United States obtained these territories, and in Article VIII guaranteed the rights of Mexican and former Mexican citizens to their property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/mexico/guadhida.htm#art8 "Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo" The Avalon Project, Yale Law School, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804142144/http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/diplomacy/mexico/guadhida.htm |date=2006-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;[http://supreme.justia.com/us/151/389/ ''California Powder Works v. Davis'' (January 22, 1894) 151 U.S. 389, 395] citing Chief Justice Waite in [http://supreme.justia.com/us/124/605/ ''Phillips v. Mound City Land and Water Association'' (February 13, 1888) 124 U.S. 605, 610 ]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in ratifying the treaty eliminated Article 10, which stated that the U.S. government would honor and guarantee all land grants awarded in lands ceded to the United States to citizens of Spain and Mexico by those respective governments.  Thus land grants were subject to being proved.&lt;ref name="Davis" /&gt;

In 1851, Congress passed the first legislation implementing the property protection provisions of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, however it addressed only the Spanish and Mexican grants in California.&lt;ref&gt;"An Act to ascertain and settle the private Land Claims in the State of California" March 3, 1851, 9 ''Statutes at Large'' 631 (sometimes referred to as the Mexican Claims Act).&lt;/ref&gt; Congress focused on California's land grants first because California was already a populous state, and it wanted to encourage further settlement of the [[Public domain (land)|public domain land]] there.

In 1854 the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] established the office of the Surveyor General of New Mexico to ascertain "the origin, nature, character, and extent to all claims to lands under the laws, usages, and customs of Spain and Mexico." At first the Congress tried to deal with each land grant by special bill and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] had a '''Committee on Private Land Claims''', seats on which were sought after as a way of dispensing [[patronage]].  By 1880 the corruption&lt;ref&gt;"no claimant could secure such legislative confirmation of his title unless he had money enough to go to Washington, organize a lobby, fight or buy off bloodsuckers and wield sufficient influence to get a bill through Congress for such purposes." Stone, W.F. (1904) "The United States Court of Private Land Claims" ''New Mexico Bar Association Minutes of the Annual Meeting'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; inherent in determining these claims by politics rather than on a legal basis forced an end to this practice.&lt;ref name="Reeve"&gt;Reeve, Frank D. (1961) ''History of New Mexico'' Lewis Historical Publishing Co., New York, vol. 2, p.255&lt;/ref&gt;  For ten years no claims could be proved as against the United States.

So the U.S. Congress, in 1891, created the '''Court of Private Land Claims''' consisting of five justices appointed for a term to expire on December 31, 1895.  The court itself was to exist only during this period, although its existence and the terms of the justices were from time to time extended until June 30, 1904. This court was given jurisdiction over claims to land in the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and in the states of Nevada, Colorado, and Wyoming, which had not been previously proved and affirmed by the United States.  Many of these Spanish or Mexican land grants were based upon incomplete documentation, in part because those governments did not issue deeds to the grantees, and records were kept variously at the territorial, state, vice-royal or imperial level.

==Work of the Court==
The court heard over three hundred cases involving over thirty-six million acres (150,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of land.  Only eighty-seven land grants were confirmed, for a total of three million acres (12,000&amp;nbsp;km²), or less than 10%.  Many confirmed grants were reduced in size from that claimed.  For example, the Cañon de Chama Grant was reduced from 200,000 to 1,500 acres (800 to 6&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref&gt;Stone, W.F. (1904) "The United States Court of Private Land Claims" ''New Mexico Bar Association Minutes of the Annual Meeting'' p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the many problems facing the court were the old Spanish system of [[metes and bounds]].  Century or two old landmarks were hard to find.  The length of a ''[[Obsolete Spanish and Portuguese units of measurement#Vara|vara]]'' (Spanish yard) might vary depending on the date of the grant.  A grant might be to the ''faldas'' (Spanish skirt) of the mountains, which could be anywhere from the edge of the foothills to timberline.&lt;ref name="Reeve"/&gt;

The '''Venezuelan Coastal Range''' ({{lang-es|Cordillera de la Costa}} or {{lang|es|Serranía de la Costa}}), also known as '''Venezuelan Caribbean Mountain System''' ({{lang-es|Sistema Montañoso Caribe}}) is a [[mountain range]] system and one of the eight [[natural regions of Venezuela]], that runs along the central and eastern portions of [[Venezuela]]'s northern coast. The range is a northeastern extension of the [[Andes]], and is also known as the '''Maritime Andes'''. It covers around 48,866 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, being the 4th largest natural region in Venezuela.

==Geography==
[[Image:Wikipedia Cordillera de la Costa.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Coastal Range of Venezuelan Andes from biological station Rancho Grande]]
The Coastal Range actually consists of two parallel ranges, which run east and west along the coast of the [[Caribbean Sea]]. The [[Cojedes River]] separates the western end of Coastal Range from the [[Cordillera de Mérida]] to the southeast. The range is divided into eastern and western sections by the wide bay between Cape Codera and [[Cumaná]]. 

===Serranía del Litoral — Serranía del Interior===
In eastern section of the range, the parallel ranges are known as the Serranía del Litoral, which runs along the Caribbean coast, and the Serranía del Interior to the south. The valley between these two ranges, which includes [[Lake Valencia (Venezuela)|Lake Valencia]], the valleys of metropolitan [[Caracas]], and the [[Tuy River]] at its eastern end, is the most densely populated region of Venezuela. 

The [[Capital District (Venezuela)|Capital District]] lies in a valley between two branches of the Serranía del Litoral: with Cerro El Ávila (peak) and [[El Ávila National Park]] in the [[Cordillera de la Costa Central]] to the north, and smaller hills to the south.

Both the Littoral and Interior ranges reappear between Cumaná and the [[Gulf of Paria]] to form the eastern section of the Venezuelan Coastal Range. The Littoral range forms the [[Araya Peninsula]] to the west and the [[Paria Peninsula]] to the east, and extends across the straits known as the [[Dragon's Mouths]] to form the [[Northern Range]] of the island of [[Trinidad]].

==Ecoregions==
The lower elevations of the mountains are mostly covered by the [[La Costa xeric shrublands]] [[ecoregion]] of the [[Deserts and xeric shrublands]] [[Biome]]. The [[Araya and Paria xeric scrub]] occupies the arid zones of Araya and Paria peninsulas, with the exception of the montane areas of the Paria Peninsula, which are included in the La Costa xeric shrublands ecoregion. The Araya and Paria xeric scrub also includes [[Isla Margarita]] and extends south on to the mainland to Cumaná. 

At elevations from {{convert|600|-|2675|m|ft}} lie the humid evergreen [[Cordillera de la Costa montane forests]] ecoregion of the montane [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests]] Biome, which form eleven discontinuous enclaves across the high summits of the eastern and western portions of the range.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4834">'''Watershed districts''' are special [[government]] entities in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]] that monitor and regulate the use of [[water]] in [[drainage basin|watershed]]s surrounding various [[lake]]s and [[river]]s in the state.  The districts cover the [[natural region]]s of the watersheds, rather than [[politics|politically]]-defined regions.  They are run by a board of managers, who are appointed by [[county commission|commission]]s in the [[County (United States)|counties]] the districts cover.

The districts were first authorized by legislation in 1955.  As of November 2016 there are 45 districts in the state ([http://www.mnwatershed.org/vertical/sites/%7B8075FBF0-4136-414E-99AC-FC56C14C0AC9%7D/uploads/Watershed_District_Map.pdf see map]).  District boards coordinate activities with the state, as well as the counties, [[city|cities]], and [[soil and water conservation district]]s they cover. In comparison with public bodies in other countries, watershed districts are most similar to the [[internal drainage board]]s of [[England]] and [[Wales]], ''[[Waterschappen]]'' of the [[Netherlands]] and ''Consorzi di bonifica e irrigazione'' of [[Italy]].

The '''Western Indo-Pacific''' is a [[biogeography|biogeographic]] region of the Earth's seas, comprising the tropical waters of the eastern and central [[Indian Ocean]]. It is part of the larger [[Indo-Pacific]], which includes the tropical Indian Ocean, the western and central [[Pacific Ocean]], and the seas connecting the two in the general area of [[Indonesia]]. The Western Indo-Pacific may be classified as a [[marine realm]], one of the great biogeographic divisions of the world's ocean basins, or as a subrealm of the Indo-Pacific.

The Western Indo-Pacific realm covers the western and central portion of the Indian Ocean, including Africa's east coast, the [[Red Sea]], [[Gulf of Aden]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Arabian Sea]], [[Bay of Bengal]], and [[Andaman Sea]], as well as the coastal waters surrounding [[Madagascar]], the [[Seychelles]], [[Comoros]], [[Mascarene Islands]], [[Maldives]], and [[Chagos Archipelago]].

The transition between the Western Indo-Pacific and Central Indo-Pacific occurs at the [[Strait of Malacca]] and in southern [[Sumatra]].

The Western Indo-Pacific does not include the temperate and polar waters of the Indian Ocean, which are part of separate marine realms. The boundary between the Western Indo-Pacific and Temperate Southern Africa marine realms lies in southern [[Mozambique]], where the southernmost [[mangrove]]s and tropical [[coral]]s are found.

==Subdivisions==
The Western Indo-Pacific is further subdivided into marine provinces, and the marine provinces divided into marine ecoregions:

===[[Red Sea and Gulf of Aden]]===

* [[Northern and Central Red Sea]]
* [[Southern Red Sea]]
* [[Gulf of Aden]]
