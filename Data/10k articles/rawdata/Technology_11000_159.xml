An '''alternator''' is an [[Generator (device)|electrical generator]] that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy in the form of [[alternating current]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aylmer-Small|first=Sidney|title=Electrical railroading; or, Electricity as applied to railroad transportation|publisher=Frederick J. Drake &amp; Co.|location=Chicago|date=1908|pages=456–463|chapter=Lesson 28: Alternators|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jdk7AAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons of cost and simplicity, most alternators use a rotating [[magnetic field]] with a stationary [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]].&lt;ref name=Slemon&gt;Gordon R. Selmon, ''Magnetoelectric Devices'', John Wiley and Sons, 1966 no ISBN pp. 391-393&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, a [[linear alternator]] or a rotating armature with a stationary magnetic field is used. In principle, any [[alternating current|AC]] [[electrical generator]] can be called an alternator, but usually the term refers to small rotating machines driven by automotive and other internal combustion engines. An alternator that uses a [[magnet|permanent magnet]] for its [[magnetic field]] is called a [[magneto]]. Alternators in [[power station]]s driven by [[steam turbine]]s are called turbo-alternators.  Large 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz [[three phase]] alternators in power plants generate most of the world's electric power, which is distributed by [[electric power grid]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Plug/Sockets and Voltage of Different Countries|url=http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/|website=World Standards|publisher=World Standards|ref=List of Plug/Sockets and Voltage of Different Countries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Alternating current generating systems were known in simple forms from the discovery of the [[Electromagnetic induction|magnetic induction of electric current]] in the 1830s. Rotating generators naturally produced alternating current but, since there was little use for it, it was normally converted into [[direct current]] via the addition of a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]] in the generator.&lt;ref name="Christopher Cooper 2015, page 93"&gt;Christopher Cooper, The Truth about Tesla: The Myth of the Lone Genius in the History of Innovation, Quarto Publishing Group USA – 2015, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; The early machines were developed by pioneers such as [[Michael Faraday]] and [[Hippolyte Pixii]]. Faraday developed the "rotating rectangle", whose operation was ''heteropolar'' – each active conductor passed successively through regions where the magnetic field was in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Sylvanus P., ''Dynamo-Electric Machinery''. p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lord Kelvin]] and [[Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti|Sebastian Ferranti]] also developed early alternators, producing frequencies between 100 and 300 [[hertz|Hz]].

The late 1870s saw the introduction of first large scale electrical systems with central generation stations to power [[Arc lamp]]s, used to light whole streets, factory yards, or the interior of large warehouses. Some, such as [[Yablochkov candle|Yablochkov arc lamps]] introduced in 1878, ran better on alternating current, and the development of these early AC generating systems was accompanied by the first use of the word "alternator".&lt;ref&gt;Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, And The Race To Electrify The World, Random House – 2004, page 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher Cooper 2015, page 93"/&gt; Supplying the proper amount of voltage from generating stations in these early systems was left up to the engineer's skill in "riding the load".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Scott McPartland, Almost Edison: How William Sawyer and Others Lost the Race to Electrification, ProQuest – 2006, page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In 1883 the [[Ganz Works]] invented the constant voltage generator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[American Society for Engineering Education]]|title=Proceedings, Part 2|year=1995|page=1848|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZVRAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ganz+%22constant+voltage+generator%22&amp;dq=ganz+%22constant+voltage+generator%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlsLXizcHOAhWLaRQKHVfGAOAQ6AEIQTAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; that could produce a stated output voltage, regardless of the value of the actual load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert L.

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Alternator 1.svg|thumb|Diagram of a simple alternator with a rotating magnetic core (rotor) and stationary wire (stator) also showing the current induced in the stator by the rotating magnetic field of the rotor.]]

A conductor moving relative to a magnetic field develops an [[electromotive force]] (EMF) in it ([[Faraday's law of induction|Faraday's Law]]). This EMF reverses its polarity when it moves under magnetic poles of opposite polarity. Typically, a rotating magnet, called the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] turns within a stationary set of conductors wound in coils on an iron core, called the [[stator]]. The field cuts across the conductors, generating an induced EMF (electromotive force), as the mechanical input causes the rotor to turn.

The [[rotating magnetic field]] induces an [[alternating current|AC voltage]] in the stator windings.  Since the currents in the stator windings vary in step with the position of the rotor, an alternator is a synchronous generator.&lt;ref name=Slemon/&gt;

The rotor's magnetic field may be produced by permanent magnets, or by a field coil electromagnet. Automotive alternators use a rotor winding which allows control of the alternator's generated voltage by varying the current in the rotor field winding.  Permanent magnet machines avoid the loss due to magnetizing current in the rotor, but are restricted in size, due to the cost of the magnet material.  Since the permanent magnet field is constant, the terminal voltage varies directly with the speed of the generator.  Brushless AC generators are usually larger than those used in automotive applications.

An automatic voltage control device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the stationary armature coils drops due to an increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the [[voltage regulator]] (VR). This increases the magnetic field around the field coils which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils. Thus, the output voltage is brought back up to its original value.

Alternators used in central [[power station]]s also control the field current to regulate [[reactive power]] and to help stabilize the power system against the effects of momentary [[fault (power engineering)|faults]]. Often there are three sets of stator windings, physically offset so that the rotating magnetic field produces a [[three phase]] current, displaced by one-third of a period with respect to each other.

==Synchronous speeds==

One cycle of alternating current is produced each time a pair of field poles passes over a point on the stationary winding. The relation between speed and frequency is &lt;math&gt;N=120f/P&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; is the frequency in Hz (cycles per second). &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is the number of poles (2,4,6...) and &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; is the rotational speed in [[revolutions per minute]] (RPM). Very old descriptions of [[alternating current]] systems sometimes give the frequency in terms of alternations per minute, counting each half-cycle as one ''alternation''; so 12,000 alternations per minute corresponds to 100&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The output [[frequency]] of an alternator depends on the number of poles and the rotational speed. The speed corresponding to a particular frequency is called the ''synchronous speed'' for that frequency. This table&lt;ref&gt;The Electrical Year Book 1937, published by Emmott &amp; Co. Ltd., Manchester, England, page 72&lt;/ref&gt; gives some examples:

== Classifications ==
Alternators may be classified by method of excitation, number of phases, the type of rotation, cooling method, and their application.&lt;ref name="faa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General (FAA-H-8083-30)|date=2008|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch10.pdf|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|pages=10_160—10_161|accessdate=6 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906013000/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch10.pdf|archive-date=6 September 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== By excitation ===
There are two main ways to produce the magnetic field used in the alternators, by using [[permanent magnet]]s which create their own persistent magnetic field or by using [[field coil]]s. The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called [[Magneto (generator)|magnetos]]. 
 
In other alternators, wound field coils form an [[electromagnet]] to produce the rotating magnetic field.

A device that uses permanent magnets to produce alternating current is called a permanent magnet alternator (PMA). A permanent magnet generator (PMG) may produce either alternating current, or direct current if it has a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]].

==== Direct connected DC generator ====
This method of excitation consists of a smaller [[Direct current|direct-current]] (DC) generator fixed on the same shaft with the alternator. The DC generator generates a small amount of electricity just enough to ''excite'' the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity. A variation of this system is a type of alternator which uses direct current from the battery for initial excitation upon start-up, after which the alternator becomes self-excited.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt;
 
==== Transformation and rectification ====
This method depends on residual magnetism retained in the iron core to generate weak magnetic field which would allow a weak voltage to be generated. This voltage is used to excite the field coils for the alternator to generate stronger voltage as part of its ''build up'' process. After the initial AC voltage buildup, the field is supplied with [[rectifier|rectified voltage]] from the alternator.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt;

==== Brushless alternators ====
A brushless alternator is composed of two alternators built end-to-end on one shaft. Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit but the two parts are readily identifiable on the large versions. The larger of the two sections is the main alternator and the smaller one is the exciter. The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A [[bridge rectifier]], called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field as described above and a stationary armature (power generation windings).

Varying the amount of current through the stationary exciter field coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly, mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output. The result of all this is that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator. &lt;ref&gt; G. K. Dubey, ''Fundamentals of Electrical Drives'', CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|084932422X}},page 350 &lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Small-scale examples are ubiquitous in engine-driven motive-power applications. For example, early Honda four-cylinder motorcycles (CB750F, CB350F, CB500F, CB550F) used a brushless Hitachi 200W alternator. This had a fixed "rotor" winding on the outer cover; the outer end of the iron core was a disc that closed the outer rotor pole. The rotor comprised two intermeshed six-pole "claws" welded to and spaced apart by a non-magnetic ring. This was bolted directly to the end of the five-bearing crank via the hub of one pole. The other pole had an open end to receive the stator winding. The outer cover also held the three-phase stator windings. The magnetic circuit had two auxiliary air gaps between the rotor and its stationary core. The regulator was a conventional automotive type with vibrating points. As it had no slip rings, it was very compact and rugged, but due to the auxiliary air gaps, it had poor efficiency.

===  By number of phases ===
{{Main|Single-phase generator|Polyphase coil}}
Another way to classify alternators is by the number of phases of their output voltage. The output can be single phase, or polyphase. Three-phase alternators are the most common, but polyphase alternators can be two phase, six phase, or more.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt;

=== By rotating part ===
The revolving part of alternators can be the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt; The revolving field type has magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the [[slip ring]] connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases and multiple sections which would each require a slip-ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up to tens of thousands of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.

===Cooling methods===
Many alternators are cooled by ambient air, forced through the enclosure by an attached fan on the same shaft that drives the alternator.  In vehicles such as transit buses, a heavy demand on the electrical system may require a large alternator to be oil-cooled. &lt;ref&gt; Gus Wright, ''Fundamentals of Medium/Heavy Duty Diesel Engines'', Jones &amp; Bartlett Publishers, 2015,  {{ISBN|128406705X}} page 1233&lt;/ref&gt; In marine applications water-cooling is also used. Expensive automobiles may use water-cooled alternators to meet high electrical system demands.

==Specific applications==

===Electric generators===
{{details|Electric generator}}
Most power generation stations use synchronous machines as their generators. Connection of these generators to the utility grid requires synchronization conditions to be met.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6175812 Soft synchronization of dispersed generators to micro grids for smart grid applications]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automotive alternators===
{{details|Alternator (automotive)}}
[[File:Jeep 2.5 liter 4-cylinder engine chromed e.jpg|thumb|Alternator mounted on an automobile engine with a [[serpentine belt]] pulley (belt not present.)]]
Alternators are used in modern [[automobile]]s to charge the [[Automotive battery|battery]] and to power the electrical system when its [[internal combustion engine|engine]] is running.

Until the 1960s, automobiles used DC [[dynamo]] generators with [[commutator (electric)|commutator]]s. With the availability of affordable [[silicon diode]] rectifiers, alternators were used instead.

=== Diesel electric locomotive alternators ===
In later [[diesel electric locomotive]]s and [[diesel electric multiple unit]]s, the [[prime mover (locomotive)|prime mover]] turns an alternator which provides electricity for the [[traction motor]]s (AC or DC).

The traction alternator usually incorporates integral silicon diode rectifiers to provide the traction motors with up to 1200 volts DC (DC traction, which is used directly) or the common inverter bus (AC traction, which is first inverted from dc to three-phase ac).

The first diesel electric locomotives, and many of those still in service, use DC generators as, before silicon power electronics, it was easier to control the speed of DC traction motors. Most of these had two generators: one to generate the excitation current for a larger main generator.

Optionally, the generator also supplies [[head end power]] (HEP) or power for [[electric train heating]]. The HEP option requires a constant engine speed, typically 900 RPM for a 480 V 60&amp;nbsp;Hz HEP application, even when the locomotive is not moving.

=== Marine alternators ===
Marine alternators used in yachts are similar to automotive alternators, with appropriate adaptations to the salt-water environment. Marine alternators are designed to be [[explosion proof]] so that brush sparking will not ignite explosive gas mixtures in an engine room environment. They may be 12 or 24 volt depending on the type of system installed. Larger marine diesels may have two or more alternators to cope with the heavy electrical demand of a modern yacht. On single alternator circuits, the power may be split between the engine starting battery and the domestic or house battery (or batteries) by use of a [[split-charge diode]] ([[battery isolator]]) or a voltage-sensitive relay.

=== Radio alternators ===
High frequency alternators of the variable-reluctance type were applied commercially to radio transmission in the low-frequency radio bands. These were used for transmission of [[Morse code]] and, experimentally, for transmission of voice and music. In the [[Alexanderson alternator]], both the field winding and armature winding are stationary, and current is induced in the armature by virtue of the changing magnetic reluctance of the rotor (which has no windings or current carrying parts). Such machines were made to produce radio frequency current for radio transmissions, although the efficiency was low.

This is known as ''open lung ventilation''. [[High frequency ventilation|High frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)]] with its use of 'super [[Continuous positive airway pressure|CPAP]]' is especially effective in preventing atelectotrauma since it maintains a very high [[mean airway pressure|mean airway pressure (MAP)]], equivalent to a very high PEEP. Atelectotrauma is one of several means by which mechanical ventilation may damage the lungs leading to [[ventilator-associated lung injury]]. The other means are [[volutrauma]], [[barotrauma]], [[rheotrauma]] and [[biotrauma]]. Attempts have been made to combine these factors in an all encompassing term: [[mechanical power]].

Atomic clocks are the most accurate [[time standard|time]] and [[frequency standard]]s known, and are used as [[primary standard]]s for international [[Time dissemination|time distribution services]], to control the wave frequency of television broadcasts, and in [[global navigation satellite system]]s such as [[GPS]].

The principle of operation of an atomic clock is based on [[atomic physics]]; it uses the [[microwave]] signal that [[electron]]s in atoms emit when they change [[energy level]]s. Early atomic clocks were based on [[maser]]s at room temperature. Currently, the most accurate atomic clocks first cool the atoms to near [[absolute zero]] temperature by slowing them with lasers and probing them in [[atomic fountain]]s in a microwave-filled cavity. An example of this is the [[NIST-F1]] atomic clock, one of the national primary time and frequency standards of the United States.

The accuracy of an atomic clock depends on two factors. The first factor is temperature of the sample atoms—colder atoms move much more slowly, allowing longer probe times. The second factor is the frequency and intrinsic width of the electronic transition. Higher frequencies and narrow lines increase the precision.

National standards agencies in many countries maintain a network of atomic clocks which are intercompared and kept synchronized to an accuracy of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; seconds per day (approximately 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;). These clocks collectively define a continuous and stable time scale, the [[International Atomic Time]] (TAI). For civil time, another time scale is disseminated, [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC). UTC is derived from TAI, but has added [[leap seconds]] from [[Universal Time|UT1]], to account for the [[rotation of the Earth]] with respect to the [[solar time]].

==History==
[[File:Atomic Clock-Louis Essen.jpg|thumb|[[Louis Essen]] (right) and Jack Parry (left) standing next to the world's first caesium-133 atomic clock.]]

Since the beginning of development in the 1950s, atomic clocks have been based on the [[hyperfine transition]]s in [[hydrogen-1]], [[caesium-133]], and [[rubidium-87]]. The first commercial atomic clock was the [[Atomichron]], manufactured by the [[National Radio Company|National Company]]. More than 50 were sold between 1956 and 1960. This bulky and expensive instrument was subsequently replaced by much smaller rack-mountable devices, such as the [[Hewlett-Packard]] model 5060 caesium frequency standard, released in 1964.&lt;ref name=Lombardi/&gt;

Since 1967, the [[International System of Units]] (SI) has defined the [[second]] as the duration of {{gaps|9|192|631|770|u=cycles}} of radiation corresponding to the transition between two energy levels of the ground state of the [[caesium-133]] atom. In 1997, the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]] (CIPM) added that the preceding definition refers to a caesium atom at rest at a temperature of [[absolute zero]].&lt;ref&gt;

This definition makes the caesium oscillator the primary standard for time and frequency measurements, called the [[caesium standard]].  The definitions of other physical units, e.g., the [[volt]] and the [[metre]], rely on the definition of the second.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;

The actual time-reference of an atomic clock consists of an electronic oscillator operating at microwave frequency. The oscillator is arranged so that its frequency-determining components include an element that can be controlled by a feedback signal. The feedback signal keeps the oscillator tuned in [[resonance]] with the frequency of the electronic transition of caesium or rubidium.

The core of the atomic clock is a tunable [[microwave cavity]] containing a gas.  In a [[hydrogen maser]] clock the gas emits [[microwaves]] (the gas ''[[maser|mases]]'') on a hyperfine transition, the field in the cavity oscillates, and the cavity is tuned for maximum microwave amplitude. Alternatively, in a caesium or rubidium clock, the beam or gas absorbs microwaves and the cavity contains an electronic amplifier to make it oscillate. For both types the atoms in the gas are prepared in one electronic state prior to filling them into the cavity. For the second type the number of atoms which change electronic state is detected and the cavity is tuned for a maximum of detected state changes.

Most of the complexity of the clock lies in this adjustment process. The adjustment tries to correct for unwanted side-effects, such as frequencies from other electron transitions, temperature changes, and the spreading in frequencies caused by [[ensemble effect]]s.{{clarify|date=May 2014}}  One way of doing this is to sweep the microwave oscillator's frequency across a narrow range to generate a modulated signal at the detector. The detector's signal can then be [[lock-in amplifier|demodulated]] to apply feedback to control long-term drift in the radio frequency. In this way, the quantum-mechanical properties of the atomic transition frequency of the caesium can be used to tune the microwave oscillator to the same frequency, except for a small amount of experimental error. When a clock is first turned on, it takes a while for the oscillator to stabilize. In practice, the feedback and monitoring mechanism is much more complex.

[[File:Clock accuracy.svg|thumb|right|Historical accuracy of atomic clocks from [[NIST]]]]

A number of other atomic clock schemes are in use for other purposes. Rubidium standard clocks are prized for their low cost, small size (commercial standards are as small as 17&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name="Symmetricon-CSAC"/&gt; and short-term stability. They are used in many commercial, portable and aerospace applications. Hydrogen masers (often manufactured in Russia) have superior short-term stability compared to other standards, but lower long-term accuracy.

Often, one standard is used to fix another. For example, some commercial applications use a rubidium standard periodically corrected by a [[global positioning system]] receiver (see [[GPS disciplined oscillator]]). This achieves excellent short-term accuracy, with long-term accuracy equal to (and traceable to) the U.S. national time standards.

The lifetime of a standard is an important practical issue. Modern rubidium standard tubes last more than ten years, and can cost as little as US$50.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Caesium reference tubes suitable for national standards currently last about seven years and cost about US$35,000. The long-term stability of hydrogen maser standards decreases because of changes in the cavity's properties over time.

Modern clocks use [[magneto-optical trap]]s to cool the atoms for improved precision.

==Power consumption==

The power consumption of atomic clocks varies with their size. Atomic clocks on the scale of one chip require less than 30 [[Watt|milliwatt]];&lt;ref name="PTTI-2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lutwak|first=Robert|title=The Chip-Scale Atomic Clock&amp;nbsp;— Prototype Evaluation|journal=36th Annual Precise Time and Time Interval (PTTI) Systems and Applications Meeting|date= 26–29 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primary frequency and time standards like the United States Time Standard atomic clocks, NIST-F1 and NIST-F2, use far greater quantities of power.&lt;ref name="Chip-Scale"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/nist-f2-atomic-clock-040314.cfm|title=NIST Launches a New U.S. Time Standard: NIST-F2 Atomic Clock|website=nist.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluated accuracy==

The planned ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; performance level of NIST-F2 is {{nowrap|1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=S.R. Jefferts |author2=T.P.

The NIST-F2 key advance compared to the NIST-F1 is that the vertical flight tube is now chilled inside a container of liquid nitrogen, at {{convert|-193|C|F}}. This cycled cooling dramatically lowers the background radiation and thus reduces some of the very small measurement errors that must be corrected in NIST-F1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/nist-f2-atomic-clock-040314.cfm |title=NIST launches a new US time standard: NIST-F2 atomic clock |date=3 April 2014|publisher=nist.gov|accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nist.gov/pml/div688/how-nist-f2-works.cfm |title=Background: How NIST-F2 Works |date=2 April 2014|publisher=nist.gov|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first in-house accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2 reported a ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; of {{nowrap|1.1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/2704.pdf Heavner T P, Donley E A, Levi F, Costanzo G, Parker TE, Shirley J H, Ashby N, Barlow S and Jefferts SR, "First accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2," 2014 Metrologia 51, 174–182, May 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a published scientific criticism of that NIST F-2 accuracy evaluation described problems in its treatment of distributed cavity phase shifts and the microwave lensing frequency shift,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |arxiv = 1505.00649|last1 = Li|first1 = Ruoxin|title = Comment on "first accuracy evaluation of NIST-F2" |journal = Metrologia|volume = 52|issue = 2015|pages = 163–166|last2 = Gibble|first2 = Kurt|last3 = Szymaniec|first3 = Krzysztof|year = 2015|doi = 10.1088/0026-1394/52/1/163|bibcode = 2015Metro..52..163G}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is treated significantly differently than in the majority of accurate fountain clock evaluations. The next NIST-F2 submission to the BIPM in March, 2015 again reported a ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; of {{nowrap|1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}},&lt;ref&gt;[ February/March 2015 Evaluation of NIST-F2]&lt;/ref&gt; but did not address the standing criticism. There have been neither subsequent reports to the BIPM from NIST-F2 nor has an updated accuracy evaluation been published.

At the request of the Italian standards organization, NIST fabricated many duplicate components for a second version of NIST-F2, known as IT-CsF2 to be operated by the [[:it:Istituto nazionale di ricerca metrologica|Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica]] (INRiM), NIST's counterpart in Turin, Italy. As of February 2016 the IT-CsF2 caesium fountain clock started reporting a ''u''&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; of {{nowrap|1.7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}} in the BIPM reports of evaluation of primary frequency standards.&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/data/PSFS_reports/it-csf2_57414-57444.pdf February 2016 IT-CsF2 TAI evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[ftp://ftp2.bipm.org/pub/tai/data/PSFS_reports/it-csf2_58284-58299.pdf  June 2018 IT-CsF2 TAI evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secondary representations of the second===
A list of frequencies recommended for secondary representations of the second is maintained by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) since 2006 and is [http://www.bipm.org/en/publications/mep.html available online]. The list contains the frequency values and the respective standard uncertainties for the rubidium microwave transition and for several optical transitions. These secondary frequency standards are accurate at the level of parts in {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;}}; however, the uncertainties provided in the list are in the range of parts in {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt;}} – {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt;}} since they are limited by the linking to the caesium primary standard that currently (2015) defines the second.

For context, a [[femtosecond]] ({{val|1|e=-15|u=s}}) is to a second what a second is to about 31.71 million ({{val|31.71|e=6}}) years and an [[attosecond]] ({{val|1|e=-18|u=s}}) is to a second what a second is to about 31.71 billion ({{val|31.71|e=9}}) years.

21st century experimental atomic clocks that provide non-caesium-based secondary representations of the second are becoming so precise that they are likely to be used as extremely sensitive detectors for other things besides measuring frequency and time. For example, the frequency of atomic clocks is altered slightly by gravity, magnetic fields, electrical fields, force, motion, temperature and other phenomena. The experimental clocks tend to continue improving, and leadership in performance has been shifted back and forth between various types of experimental clocks.

===Quantum clocks===
{{further|Quantum clock}}
In March 2008, physicists at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] described a [[Quantum clock|quantum logic clock]] based on individual [[ion]]s of [[beryllium (element)|beryllium]] and [[aluminium]]. This clock was compared to NIST's [[mercury (element)|mercury]] ion clock. These were the most accurate clocks that had been constructed, with neither clock gaining nor losing time at a rate that would exceed a second in over a billion years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Swenson|first1=Gayle|title=Press release: NIST 'Quantum Logic Clock' Rivals Mercury Ion as World's Most Accurate Clock|url=https://www.nist.gov/news-events/news/2008/03/nist-quantum-logic-clock-rivals-mercury-ion-worlds-most-accurate-clock-0|publisher=NIST|language=en|date=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010, NIST physicists described a second, enhanced version of the quantum logic clock based on individual [[ion]]s of [[magnesium]] and [[aluminium]]. Considered the world's most precise clock in 2010 with a fractional frequency inaccuracy of {{nowrap|8.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−18&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it offers more than twice the precision of the original.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nist.gov/physlab/div847/logicclock_020410.cfm NIST's Second 'Quantum Logic Clock' Based on Aluminum Ion is Now World's Most Precise Clock], NIST, 4 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The accuracy of experimental quantum clocks has since been superseded by experimental [[Atomic clock#Optical clocks|optical lattice clocks]] based on [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] and [[ytterbium-171]].

===Optical clocks===
[[File:JILA's strontium optical atomic clock.jpg|thumb|May 2009- [[JILA]]'s strontium optical atomic clock is based on neutral atoms. Shining a blue laser onto ultracold strontium atoms in an optical trap tests how efficiently a previous burst of light from a red laser has boosted the atoms to an excited state. Only those atoms that remain in the lower energy state respond to the blue laser, causing the fluorescence seen here.&lt;ref name=opticalatomic1&gt;

The theoretical move from microwaves as the atomic "escapement" for clocks to light in the optical range (harder to measure but offering better performance) earned [[John L. Hall]] and [[Theodor W. Hänsch]] the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2005. One of 2012's Physics Nobelists, [[David J. Wineland]], is a pioneer in exploiting the properties of a single ion held in a trap to develop clocks of the highest stability.

New technologies, such as femtosecond frequency combs, optical lattices, and [[quantum information]], have enabled prototypes of next-generation atomic clocks. These clocks are based on optical rather than microwave transitions. A major obstacle to developing an optical clock is the difficulty of directly measuring optical frequencies. This problem has been solved with the development of self-referenced mode-locked lasers, commonly referred to as femtosecond [[frequency comb]]s. Before the demonstration of the frequency comb in 2000, [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] techniques were needed to bridge the gap between radio and optical frequencies, and the systems for doing so were cumbersome and complicated. With the refinement of the frequency comb, these measurements have become much more accessible and numerous optical clock systems are now being developed around the world.

As in the radio range, absorption spectroscopy is used to stabilize an oscillator—in this case a laser. When the optical frequency is divided down into a countable radio frequency using a [[femtosecond comb]], the [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of the [[phase noise]] is also divided by that factor. Although the bandwidth of laser phase noise is generally greater than stable microwave sources, after division it is less.

The primary systems under consideration for use in optical frequency standards are:
* single ions isolated in an ion trap;
* neutral atoms trapped in an optical lattice and&lt;ref name=saoc&gt;

The rare-earth element ytterbium (Yb) is valued not so much for its mechanical properties but for its complement of internal energy levels. "A particular transition in Yb atoms, at a wavelength of 578 nm, currently provides one of the world's most accurate optical atomic frequency standards," said Marianna Safronova.&lt;ref name="Marianna Safronova"&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackbody Radiation Shift: Quantum Thermodynamics Will Redefine Clocks|url=http://www.science20.com/news_articles/blackbody_radiation_shift_quantum_thermodynamics_will_redefine_clocks-98064|accessdate=5 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimated amount of uncertainty achieved corresponds to a Yb clock uncertainty of about one second over the lifetime of the universe so far, 15 billion years, according to scientists at the Joint Quantum Institute (JQI) and the [[University of Delaware]] in December 2012.

In 2013 optical lattice clocks (OLCs) were shown to be as good as or better than caesium fountain clocks. Two optical lattice clocks containing about {{nowrap|10 000 atoms}} of [[Isotopes of strontium|strontium-87]] were able to stay in synchrony with each other at a precision of at least {{nowrap|1.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which is as accurate as the experiment could measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There are two reasons for the possibly better precision. Firstly, the frequency is measured using light, which has a much higher frequency than microwaves, and secondly, by using many atoms, any errors are averaged.&lt;ref name=strontclk&gt;{{cite web |title=Precise atomic clock may redefine time |url=http://www.nature.com/news/precise-atomic-clock-may-redefine-time-1.13363 |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate=24 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Using [[ytterbium-171]] atoms, a new record for stability with a precision of {{val|1.6|e=-18}}&lt;!-- stable to within less than two parts in 10^-18 --&gt; over a 7-hour period was published on 22 August 2013.

[[File:17jila003 3d strontium atomic clock.jpg|thumb|JILA’s 2017 three-dimensional (3-D) quantum gas atomic clock consists of a grid of light formed by three pairs of laser beams. A stack of two tables is used to configure optical components around a vacuum chamber. Shown here is the upper table, where lenses and other optics are mounted. A blue laser beam excites a cube-shaped cloud of strontium atoms located behind the round window in the middle of the table. Strontium atoms fluorescence strongly when excited with blue light.]]

In 2017 JILA reported an experimental 3D quantum gas strontium optical lattice clock in which strontium-87 atoms are packed into a tiny three-dimensional (3-D) cube at 1,000 times the density of previous one-dimensional (1-D) clocks, like the 2015 JILA clock. A synchronous clock comparison between two regions of the 3D lattice yielded a record level of synchronization of {{nowrap|5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;}} in 1 hour of averaging time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The 3D quantum gas strontium optical lattice clock’s centerpiece is an unusual state of matter called a [[degenerate matter|degenerate]] [[Fermi gas]] (a quantum gas for Fermi particles). The experimental data shows the 3D quantum gas clock achieved a precision of {{nowrap|3.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;}} in about two hours. According to Jun Ye "This represents a significant improvement over any previous demonstrations." Ye further commented "The most important potential of the 3D quantum gas clock is the ability to scale up the atom numbers, which will lead to a huge gain in stability." and "The ability to scale up both the atom number and coherence time will make this new-generation clock qualitatively different from the previous generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Optical clocks are currently (2018) still primarily research projects, less mature than rubidium and caesium microwave standards, which regularly deliver time to the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]] (BIPM) for establishing [[International Atomic Time|International Atomic Time (TAI)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bipm.org/en/scientific/tai/|title=BIPM Time Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)|publisher=BIPM|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the optical experimental clocks move beyond their microwave counterparts in terms of accuracy and stability performance this puts them in a position to replace the current standard for time, the caesium fountain clock.&lt;ref name=saoc/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=N.

===Clock comparison techniques===
In June 2015, the European [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory (NPL) in Teddington, UK]]; the French [[Paris Observatory|department of Time-Space Reference Systems at the Paris Observatory (LNE-SYRTE)]]; the German [[Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt|German National Metrology Institute (PTB) in Braunschweig]]; and Italy’s [[:it:Istituto nazionale di ricerca metrologica|Istituto Nazionale di Ricerca Metrologica (INRiM) in Turin]] labs have started tests to improve the accuracy of current state-of-the-art satellite comparisons by a factor 10, but it will still be limited to one part in {{nowrap|1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−16&lt;/sup&gt;}}. These 4 European labs are developing and host a variety of experimental optical clocks that harness different elements in different experimental set-ups and want to compare their optical clocks against each other and check whether they agree. In a next phase these labs strive to transmit comparison signals in the visible spectrum through fibre-optic cables. This will allow their experimental optical clocks to be compared with an accuracy similar to the expected accuracies of the optical clocks themselves. Some of these labs have already established fibre-optic links, and tests have begun on sections between Paris and Teddington, and Paris and Braunschweig. Fibre-optic links between experimental optical clocks also exist between the American [[NIST]] lab and its partner lab [[JILA]], both in [[Boulder, Colorado]] but these span much shorter distances than the European network and are between just two labs. According to Fritz Riehle, a physicist at PTB, "Europe is in a unique position as it has a high density of the best clocks in the world".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In August 2016 the French LNE-SYRTE in Paris and German PTB in Braunschweig reported the comparison and agreement of two fully independent experimental strontium lattice optical clocks in Paris and Braunschweig at an uncertainty of {{nowrap|5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−17&lt;/sup&gt;}} via a newly established phase-coherent frequency link connecting Paris and Braunschweig, using {{convert|1415|km|mi|0|lk=on|abbr=on}} of telecom fibre-optic cable. The fractional uncertainty of the whole link was assessed to be {{nowrap|2.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;}}, making comparisons of even more accurate clocks possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Applications==
The development of atomic clocks has led to many scientific and technological advances such as a system of precise global and regional [[satellite navigation|navigation satellite systems]], and applications in the [[Internet]], which depend critically on frequency and time standards. Atomic clocks are installed at sites of [[time signal]] radio transmitters. They are used at some long wave and medium wave broadcasting stations to deliver a very precise carrier frequency.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Atomic clocks are used in many scientific disciplines, such as for long-baseline [[interferometry]] in [[radioastronomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Global Navigation Satellite Systems===
The [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) operated by the US [[Air Force Space Command]] provides very accurate timing and frequency signals. A GPS receiver works by measuring the relative time delay of signals from a minimum of four, but usually more, GPS satellites, each of which has at least two onboard caesium and as many as two rubidium atomic clocks. The relative times are mathematically transformed into three absolute spatial coordinates and one absolute time coordinate.&lt;ref name="gps.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps |title=Global Positioning System |publisher=Gps.gov |accessdate=26 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730173245/http://www.gps.gov/systems/gps |archivedate=30 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
GPS Time (GPST) is a continuous time scale and theoretically accurate to about 14 [[nanosecond|ns]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=David W.

The GPST is related to but differs from TAI (International Atomic Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). GPST remains at a constant offset with TAI (TAI – GPST = 19 seconds) and like TAI does not implement leap seconds. Periodic corrections are performed to the on-board clocks in the satellites to keep them synchronized with ground clocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://confluence.qps.nl/display/KBE/UTC+to+GPS+Time+Correction|title=UTC to GPS Time Correction|website=qps.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NAVSTAR GPS User Equipment Introduction|format=PDF|url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pubs/gps/gpsuser/gpsuser.pdf }} Section 1.2.2&lt;/ref&gt; The GPS navigation message includes the difference between GPST and UTC. As of July 2015, GPST is 17 seconds ahead of UTC because of the leap second added to UTC on 30 June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=currentNanus&amp;format=txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gps.afspc.af.mil/gps/archive/2012/nanus/2012034.nnu |title=Notice Advisory to Navstar Users (NANU) 2012034 |date=30 May 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |publisher=GPS Operations Center |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408111458/https://gps.afspc.af.mil/gps/archive/2012/nanus/2012034.nnu |archivedate=8 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Receivers subtract this offset from GPS Time to calculate UTC and specific timezone values.

===Time signal radio transmitters===
A [[radio clock]] is a clock that automatically synchronizes itself by means of government radio [[time signal]]s received by a [[radio receiver]]. Many retailers market radio clocks inaccurately as atomic clocks;&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Lombardi, [http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2429.pdf "How Accurate is a Radio Controlled Clock?"], National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; although the radio signals they receive originate from atomic clocks, they are not atomic clocks themselves. 
Normal low cost consumer grade receivers solely rely on the amplitude-modulated time signals and use narrow band receivers (with 10&amp;nbsp;Hz bandwidth) with small ferrite [[Loop antenna#AM broadcast receiver loop antennas|loopstick antennas]] and circuits with non optimal digital signal processing delay and can therefore only be expected to determine the beginning of a second with a practical accuracy uncertainty of ± 0.1 second. This is sufficient for radio controlled low cost consumer grade clocks and watches using standard-quality [[quartz clock]]s for timekeeping between daily synchronization attempts, as they will be most accurate immediately after a successful synchronization and will become less accurate from that point forward until the next synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Lombardi, [http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2429.pdf "How Accurate is a Radio Controlled Clock?], National Institute of Standards and Technology, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
Instrument grade time receivers provide higher accuracy. Such devices incur a transit delay of approximately 1 [[millisecond|ms]] for every 300 kilometres (186&amp;nbsp;mi) of distance from the [[radio transmitter]]. Many governments operate transmitters for time-keeping purposes.

[[File:Safety bicycle 1887.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|An advertisement for a safety bicycle that was to cause the great boom of the 1890s]]

The term "'''bike boom'''" or "'''bicycle [[Fads and trends|craze]]'''" refers to any of several specific historic periods marked by increased [[bicycle]] enthusiasm, popularity, and sales.

Prominent examples include 1819 and 1868, as well as the decades of the 1890s and 1970s &amp;mdash; the latter especially in North America and 2010s in the United Kingdom.

==1819==
{{Main article|History of the bicycle#1817 to 1819: the draisine or velocipede}}
[[File:Quadricycle.JPG|thumb|[[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|Quadracycle]]]]
The first period which may be called a bicycle craze actually refers to a precursor of the bicycle which was pushed along by the feet on the ground as in walking, and did not have [[bicycle pedal|pedals]]. This machine was invented by [[Karl Drais|Baron Karl von Drais]] in Germany, and was called variously a "draisine" (English) or "draisienne" (French) after his name, a "[[velocipede]]" from the [[Latin]] terms for "fast foot", a "hobby horse", or a "[[dandy horse]]", the last name being perhaps the most popular. Drais got a patent for his invention in 1818, and the craze swept Europe and the United States during the summer of 1819 while many manufacturers (notably [[Denis Johnson of London]]) either copied Drais's machine or created their own versions, then quickly died out as many pedestrians began to feel threatened by the machines and municipalities enacted laws prohibiting their use.

During the next 43 years, chiefly in England, inventors continued to explore the concept of [[human-powered transport]], but on vehicles with three or four wheels (called "[[tricycle]]s" and "[[Quadracycle (human-powered vehicle)|quadracycles]]" respectively), which were thought to be more stable, not requiring the balance that is necessary for two-wheeled vehicles. But none of these achieved much popularity.

==1860s and 1870s==
{{Main article|History of the bicycle#1860s and the Michaux or "boneshaker"}}
In the early 1860s the first true bicycle was created in Paris, France, by attaching rotary [[Crank mechanism|cranks]] and [[Bicycle pedal|pedals]] to the front wheel [[Bicycle wheel|hub]] of a dandy-horse. The [[Olivier brothers]] recognized the commercial potential of this invention, and set up a partnership with [[blacksmith]] and bicycle maker [[Pierre Michaux]], using Michaux's name, already famous among enthusiasts of the new sport, for the company. They began the first [[mass-production]] of bicycles (still called "velocipedes") in 1868, as the first real bicycle craze had begun the year before, reaching full force all over Europe and America in 1868 and 1869. But exactly as with the dandy-horse, pedestrians complained about them, and the craze again faded quickly. Another factor in their demise was the extremely uncomfortable ride, because of the stiff [[wrought-iron]] [[Bicycle frame|frame]] and wooden [[Bicycle wheel|wheels]] surrounded by tires made of iron — this led to the pejorative name "boneshaker", which is still used today to refer to this type of bicycle.

Again, England was the only place where the concept remained popular during the early 1870s. But the design changed drastically, with the front wheel becoming larger and larger, and with many other improvements making the ride more comfortable. This type of bicycle was known in its day as the "ordinary", but people later began calling it a "[[penny-farthing]]" because of the resemblance of its wheel sizes to the largest and smallest English copper coins of the time; it is also known as a "high-wheel". Front-wheel sizes quickly grew to as much as 5 feet (~1.5 meters), and the bicycles were considered by the general public to be quite dangerous. In addition, they were expensive, and thus riders were mostly wealthy young men who formed an elite brotherhood. However, bicycle races were staged and well-attended by the public, which spread interest for the high-wheeler worldwide because of the far-flung British colonies, by the end of the decade. [[Albert Pope]] purchased Lallement's original patent and created his "Columbia" bicycle in the U.S. in 1878, and went on to manufacture thousands of bicycles.

==1890s==
{{Main article|History of the bicycle#The safety bicycle: 1880s and 1890s}}
[[File:HotchkissBikeRR.JPG|thumb|[[Smithville, Burlington County, New Jersey#Bicycle railroad|The Mount Holly and Smithville Bicycle Railway]] - 1892-1898]]
The 1890s saw one of the biggest bicycle crazes of all, driven by several significant developments in bicycles: the invention of the "[[safety bicycle]]" with its [[chain-drive]] [[Bicycle gearing|transmission]], whose [[gear ratio]]s allowed smaller wheels without a concurrent loss of speed, and the subsequent invention of the pneumatic (inflatable air-filled) bicycle tire.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments with chain-drive had been attempted in 1869 and 1879, but the first well known chain-drive bicycle was the "Rover" produced in 1885 by [[John Kemp Starley]]. Very quickly, the penny-farthing passed out of fashion, and multitudes of people all over the world began riding the "safety".

September 13, 1892 saw the opening of a [[Hotchkiss Bicycle Railroad|Bicycle Railroad]] between [[Mount Holly, New Jersey]] and the [[Hezekiah Bradley Smith|H. B. Smith Manufacturing Company]] in [[Smithville, Burlington County, New Jersey|Smithville, NJ]] during the Mount Holly fair, with 3,000 riders its first week (for amusement instead of commuting).

[[Coney Island]] wanted one, and the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] featured one.  Several others were built for amusement in [[Atlantic City]], [[Ocean City, New Jersey|Ocean City]] and [[Gloucester City, NJ]] (the first two in 1893 and last in 1894).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Overman victor flyer bicycle.png|thumb|left|The [[Overman Wheel Company|Overman]] Victor Flyer, a popular safety bicycle during the 1890s]]
In the year 1896, there was simultaneously an increase in bicycle popularity and a severe [[Panic of 1896|economic depression]].&lt;ref name="NYWorld"&gt;{{cite news|title=Overman's Struggle, Splendor, and Failure|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/3135628|accessdate=8 February 2016|publisher=The World|date=29 December 1897|location=New York, NY|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles were one of the few areas of the economy where sales were growing; people were buying bicycles "whether they could afford them or not".&lt;ref name="NYWorld" /&gt; This attracted hundreds of manufacturers into the bicycle business.&lt;ref name="NYWorld" /&gt; This increase in production resulted in a downward spiral of market saturation, over-supply and intense price competition.&lt;ref name="NYWorld" /&gt; Many bicycle manufacturers, faced with excess inventory and prices too low to make a profit, went out of business. Several dozen bicycle companies consolidated into the [[American Bicycle Company]] in 1899.

The application of the [[internal-combustion engine]] to the bicycle during the 1890s resulted in the [[motorcycle]], and then soon after, the engine was applied to 4-wheel carriages resulting in the [[motor car]] or "automobile" which in later decades largely supplanted its unmotorized ancestor.

The United Kingdom experienced a mountain bike boom during the 1990s. Road bike customers were seen as reluctant to spend money, while the mountain bike market offered new features such as suspensions and materials such as carbon fibre, aluminum and titanium. The market began to implode by the time of the [[2001 United Kingdom foot-and-mouth outbreak]]. Since then it has barely recovered to the level of its prime years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/green-living/when-did-it-all-start-to-go-downhill-for-mountain-biking-9202637.html|title=When did it all start to go downhill for mountain biking?|date=2014-03-23|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Simon Mottram]] of the cycling clothing brand [[Rapha (sportswear)|Rapha]] traced the boom back to the after-effects of the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]], which closed parts of [[London Underground|the Tube]] and encouraged many commuters onto bicycles. [[2007 Tour de France|Two years later, the Tour de France]] started in London on the anniversary of the attack, and the following year Team GB dominated [[Cycling at the 2008 Summer Olympics|cycling at the Beijing Olympics]].

The '''Buell dryer''' is a multiple hearth direct heated [[Industry|industrial]] [[wikt:dryer|dryer]] (commonly known as a turbo dryer) that has modified for drying [[Kaolinite|china clay]]. Its design is very similar to the [[Herreshoff Kiln]], which is a type of [[calciner]]. The Buell dryer was first developed by [[English China Clays|English Clays Lovering Pochin &amp; Co. Ltd]] for their china clay processing plants in Cornwall. The first Buell was installed in the old [[Cooper (profession)|cooperage]] in [[Nanpean]], and was the first operating mechanical dryer in the [[Cornwall|Cornish]] china clay industry, having started in 1945.

The dryer itself is composed of a large upright [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] chamber, inside of which are 25 to 30 layers of trays or 'hearths'. Hot air and gasses are distributed throughout the dryer by a series of fans and ducts. At the centre of the dryer is a rotating column, to which the trays are attached and positioned radially within the dryer. Material enters the top of the dryer and lands on one of the top trays. As the central column rotates, fixed arms push the material off the tray, dropping it down onto the one below it. Gradually the material works its way down through the dryer in this manner, and exits the bottom of the dryer with the assistance of fans.

Material to be dried usually enters the top of the dryer with a moisture content of around 18%, and exits as a product of around 10 to 8%. Generally these figures all depend on the [[dewatering]] processes employed before the material reaches the dryer. Commonly, the Buell dryer handles shredded [[filter press cakes]] from standard square plate [[filter press]]es.

While the Buell dryer is now thought to be a relatively obsolete drying technology, a very similar dryer made by Wyssmont called the TURBO-DRYER is still widely used worldwide.

TURBO-DRYER is the registered trademark of the Wyssmont company, inc. in Fort Lee, NJ USA. it is usually used for a thermal processor consisting of a stack of rotating toroidal shelves with radial slots wrapped around a set of central fans on a vertical axis in a stationary housing.

While essentially like the Buell dryer it has many improvements over that dryer so that it is not considered an outdated dryer. It frequently out-performs other dryers like vacuum dryers, fluid bed dryers, rotary dryers, flash dryers, indirect contact dryers and belt dryers.

Wyssmont was the first company to do closed-circuit solvent-recovery drying and many of its installation are still used for this type of application.

Although most used with hot air drying it is frequently used for inert gas drying of metals and polymers. It is known for its gentle handling, uniform product, easy startup, low maintenance, low power and "turn it on and forget it" operation.

{{thermodynamics|cTopic=Processes and Cycles}}
In [[electric power generation]] a '''combined cycle''' is an assembly of [[heat engine]]s that work in tandem from the same source of heat, converting it into [[mechanical energy]], which in turn usually drives [[electrical generator]]s. The principle is that after completing its cycle (in the first engine), the temperature of the [[working fluid]] in the system is still high enough that a second subsequent heat engine extracts energy from the heat that the first engine produced. By combining these multiple streams of work upon a single mechanical shaft turning an electric generator, the overall net efficiency of the system may be increased by 50–60%. (That is, from an overall efficiency of say 34% (in a single cycle) to possibly an overall efficiency of 62% in net [[Carnot cycle|Carnot]] thermodynamic efficiency.)

This can be done because heat engines are only able to use a portion of the energy their fuel generates (usually less than 50%). In an ordinary (non-combined cycle) heat engine the remaining heat (i.e., hot exhaust gas) from combustion is wasted.

Combining two or more thermodynamic cycles results in improved overall efficiency, reducing fuel costs. In stationary power plants, a widely used combination is a [[gas turbine]] (operating by the [[Brayton cycle]]) burning [[natural gas]] or [[synthesis gas]] from [[coal]], whose hot exhaust powers a [[steam power plant]] (operating by the [[Rankine cycle]]). This is called a Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) plant, and can achieve a best-of-class real (HHV - see below) [[thermal efficiency]] of around 62% in base-load operation, in contrast to a single cycle steam power plant which is limited to efficiencies of around 35–42%. Many new gas power plants in North America and Europe are of the Combined Cycle Gas Turbine type. Such an arrangement is also used for marine propulsion, and is called a ''[[combined gas and steam]] (COGAS)'' plant. Multiple stage turbine or steam cycles are also common.

Other historically successful combined cycles have used hot cycles with [[mercury vapour turbine]]s, [[magnetohydrodynamic generator]]s or [[molten carbonate fuel cell]]s, with steam plants for the low temperature "bottoming" cycle. Bottoming cycles operating from a steam condenser's heat exhaust are theoretically possible, but uneconomical because of the very large, expensive equipment needed to extract energy from the small temperature differences between condensing steam and outside air or water. However, it is common in cold climates (such as [[Finland]]) to drive community heating systems from a power plant's condenser heat. Such [[cogeneration]] systems can yield theoretical efficiencies above 95%.

In automotive and aeronautical engines, turbines have been driven from the exhausts of [[Otto cycle|Otto]] and [[Diesel cycle]]s. These are called [[turbo-compound engine]]s (not to be confused with [[turbocharger]]s).

==Basic combined cycle==
[[File:Basic-cycles.JPG|thumb|right|Topping and bottoming cycles]]

The [[thermodynamic cycle]] of the basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or [[Brayton cycle]] which is a [[gas turbine]] cycle and the other is [[Rankine cycle]] which is a [[steam turbine]] cycle.&lt;ref name="yahya"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahya|first=S.M|title=Turbines, compressors and fans|publisher=Tata Mc Graw Hill|pages=chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cycle 1-2-3-4-1 which is the [[gas turbine power plant]] cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in high temperature region.

The cycle a-b-c-d-e-f-a which is the Rankine steam cycle takes place at a low temperature and is known as the bottoming cycle. Transfer of heat energy from high temperature [[exhaust gas]] to water and steam takes place by a [[waste heat recovery unit|waste heat recovery]] boiler in the bottoming cycle. During the constant pressure process 4-1 the exhaust gases in the [[gas turbine]] reject heat. The feed water, wet and super heated steam absorb some of this heat in the process a-b, b-c and c-d.

=== Steam generators ===
[[File:Steam-turbines.JPG|thumb|right|Heat transfer from hot gases to water and steam]]
The steam power plant gets its input heat from the high temperature exhaust gases from [[gas turbine]] power plant.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt; The steam generated thus can be used to drive [[steam turbine]]. The Waste Heat Recovery Boiler (WHRB) has 3 sections: Economiser, evaporator and superheater.

== Design principles ==
[[File:Combined cycle animation.ogv|thumb|Explanation of the layout and principle of a combined cycle power generator.]]
[[File:COGES diagram.svg|thumb|right|Working principle of a combined cycle power plant (Legend: 1-Electric generators, 2-Steam turbine, 3-Condenser, 4-Pump, 5-Boiler/heat exchanger, 6-Gas turbine)]]

The efficiency of a heat engine, the fraction of input heat energy that can be converted to useful work, is limited by the temperature difference between the heat entering the engine and the exhaust heat leaving the engine.

In a [[thermal power station]], water is the working medium. High pressure steam requires strong, bulky components. High temperatures require expensive alloys made from [[nickel]] or [[cobalt]], rather than inexpensive [[steel]]. These alloys limit practical steam temperatures to 655&amp;nbsp;°C while the lower temperature of a steam plant is fixed by the temperature of the cooling water. With these limits, a steam plant has a fixed upper efficiency of 35–42%.

An open circuit gas turbine cycle has a [[Gas compressor|compressor]], a [[combustor]] and a [[turbine]]. For gas turbines the amount of metal that must withstand the high temperatures and pressures is small, and lower quantities of expensive materials can be used. In this type of cycle, the input temperature to the turbine (the firing temperature), is relatively high (900 to 1,400&amp;nbsp;°C). The output temperature of the [[flue gas]] is also high (450 to 650&amp;nbsp;°C). This is therefore high enough to provide heat for a second cycle which uses steam as the working fluid (a [[Rankine cycle]]).

In a combined cycle power plant, the heat of the gas turbine's exhaust is used to generate steam by passing it through a [[heat recovery steam generator]] (HRSG) with a [[live steam]] temperature between 420 and 580&amp;nbsp;°C. The condenser of the Rankine cycle is usually cooled by water from a lake, river, sea or [[cooling tower]]s. This temperature can be as low as 15&amp;nbsp;°C.

=== Typical size of CCGT plants ===
Plant size is important in the cost of the plant. The larger plant sizes benefit from [[economies of scale]] (lower initial cost per kilowatt) and improved efficiency.

For large-scale power generation, a typical set would be a 270&amp;nbsp;MW primary gas turbine coupled to a 130&amp;nbsp;MW secondary steam turbine, giving a total output of 400&amp;nbsp;MW. A typical power station might consist of between 1 and 6 such sets.

Gas turbines for large-scale power generation are manufactured by at least four separate groups – General Electric, Siemens, Mitsubishi-Hitachi, and Ansaldo Energia. These groups are also developing, testing and/or marketing gas turbine sizes in excess of 300 MW (for 60 Hz applications) and 400 MW (for 50 Hz applications). Combined cycle units are made up of one or more such gas turbines, each with a waste heat steam generator arranged to supply steam to a single or multiple steam turbines, thus forming a combined cycle block or unit. Combined cycle block sizes offered by three major manufacturers (Alstom, General Electric and Siemens) can range anywhere from 50 MW to well over 1300 MW with costs approaching $670/kW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.platts.com/latest-news/electric-power/boston/combined-cycle-gas-fired-unit-costs-coming-in-21948694 | title=Combined-cycle, gas-fired unit costs coming in below expectations: Duke &amp;#124; S&amp;P Global Platts| date=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Unfired boiler ===

The heat recovery boiler is item 5 in the COGAS figure shown above. Hot gas turbine exhaust enters in [[super heater]] and the [[evaporator]] and then in to economiser section as it flows out from the [[boiler]].
Feed water comes in through the economizer and then exits after having attained saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If the temperature of the gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;

=== Dual pressure boiler===
[[File:Dual-cycle.jpg|thumb|center|Steam turbine plant lay out with dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

It is often desirable if high heat is recovered from the exiting gases. Hence dual pressure boiler is employed for this purpose.&lt;ref name="yahya"/&gt;  It has two [[water]]/[[steam]] drums. Low pressure drum is connected to low pressure economizer or evaporator. The low pressure steam is generated in low temperature zone. The low pressure steam is supplied to the low temperature turbine. Super heater can be provided in the low pressure circuit.

Some part of the feed water from the low-pressure zone is transferred to the high-pressure economizer by a booster [[pump]]. This economizer heats up the water to its [[saturation temperature]]. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the [[boiler]] and is supplied to the high-pressure [[turbine]].
[[File:Unfired-boiler.JPG|thumb|center|Heat exchange in dual pressure heat recovery boiler]]

=== Supplementary firing ===
Supplementary firing may be used in combined cycles (in the HRSG) raising exhaust temperatures from 600&amp;nbsp;°C (GT exhaust) to 800 or even 1000&amp;nbsp;°C. Using supplemental firing will however not raise the combined cycle efficiency for most combined cycles. For single boilers it may raise the efficiency if fired to 700–750&amp;nbsp;°C; for multiple boilers however, supplemental firing is often used to improve peak power production of the unit, or to enable higher steam production to compensate for failure of a second unit.

Maximum supplementary firing refers to the maximum fuel that can be fired with the oxygen available in the gas turbine exhaust. The steam cycle is conventional with reheat and regeneration. Hot gas turbine exhaust is used as the combustion air. Regenerative air preheater is not required. A fresh air fan which makes it possible to operate the steam plant even when the gas turbine is not in operation, increases the availability of the unit.

The use of large supplementary firing in Combined Cycle Systems with high gas turbine inlet temperatures causes the efficiency to drop. For this reason the Combined Cycle Plants with maximum supplementary firing are only of minimal importance today, in comparison to simple Combined Cycle installations. However, they have two advantages that is a) coal can be burned in the steam generator as the supplementary fuel, b) has very good part load efficiency.

The [[Heat recovery steam generator|HRSG]] can be designed with supplementary firing of fuel after the gas turbine in order to increase the quantity or temperature of the steam generated. Without supplementary firing, the efficiency of the combined cycle power plant is higher, but supplementary firing lets the plant respond to fluctuations of electrical load. Supplementary burners are also called ''duct burners''.

More fuel is sometimes added to the turbine's exhaust. This is possible because the turbine exhaust gas (flue gas) still contains some [[oxygen]]. Temperature limits at the gas turbine inlet force the turbine to use excess air, above the optimal [[stoichiometric]] ratio to burn the fuel. Often in gas turbine designs part of the compressed air flow bypasses the burner and is used to cool the turbine blades.

Supplementary firing raises the temperature of the exhaust gas from 800 to 900 degree Celsius. Relatively high flue gas temperature raises the condition of steam (84 bar, 525 degree Celsius) thereby improving the efficiency of steam cycle.

== Fuel for combined cycle power plants ==

Combined cycle plants are usually powered by [[natural gas]], although [[fuel oil]], [[synthesis gas]] or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. [[Biofuel]]s can also be used. Integrated [[solar energy|solar]] combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look [[Integrated solar combined cycle|ISCC section]]). Next generation nuclear power plants are also on the drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the Brayton top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.

The improvement in [[shale gas]] extraction has increased natural gas supplies and reserves dramatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this fact, it is becoming the fuel of choice for an increasing amount of private investors and consumers because it is more versatile than coal or oil and can be used in 90% of energy applications. Chile which once depended on hydro-power for 70% of its electricity supply, is now boosting its gas supplies to reduce reliance on its drought afflicted hydro dams. Similarly China is tapping its gas reserves to reduce reliance on coal, which is currently burned to generate 80% of the country's electricity supply.

Where the extension of a gas pipeline is impractical or cannot be economically justified, electricity needs in remote areas can be met with small-scale Combined Cycle Plants, using renewable fuels.
Instead of natural gas, Combined Cycle Plants can be filled with biogas derived from agricultural and forestry waste, which is often readily available in rural areas.

===Low-grade fuel for turbines===
Gas turbines burn mainly natural gas and light oil. Crude oil, residual, and some distillates contain corrosive components and as such require fuel treatment equipment. In addition, ash deposits from these fuels result in gas turbine deratings of up to 15%. They may still be economically attractive fuels however, particularly in combined-cycle plants.

Sodium and potassium are removed from residual, crude and heavy distillates by a water washing procedure. A simpler and less expensive purification system will do the same job for light crude and light distillates. A magnesium additive system may also be needed to reduce the corrosive effects if vanadium is present. Fuels requiring such treatment must have a separate fuel-treatment plant and a system of accurate fuel monitoring to assure reliable, low-maintenance operation of gas turbines.

== Configuration ==
A single shaft combined cycle plant comprises a gas turbine and a steam turbine driving a common generator. In a multi-shaft combined cycle plant, each gas turbine and each steam turbine has its own generator. The single shaft design provides slightly less initial cost and slightly better efficiency than if the gas and steam turbines had their own generators. The multi-shaft design enables two or more gas turbines to operate in conjunction with a single steam turbine, which can be more economical than a number of single shaft units.

The primary disadvantage of single shaft combined cycle power plants is that the number of steam turbines, condensers and condensate systems – and perhaps the number of cooling towers and circulating water systems – increases to match the number of gas turbines. For a multi-shaft combined cycle power plant there is only one steam turbine, condenser and the rest of the heat sink for up to three gas turbines; only their size increases. Having only one large steam turbine and heat sink results in low cost because of economies of scale. A larger steam turbine also allows the use of higher pressures and results in a more efficient steam cycle. Thus the overall plant size and the associated number of gas turbines required have a major impact on whether a single shaft combined cycle power plant or a multiple shaft combined cycle power plant is more economical.

The combined-cycle system includes single-shaft and multi-shaft configurations. The single-shaft system consists of one gas turbine, one steam turbine, one generator and one Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG), with the gas turbine and steam turbine coupled to the single generator in a tandem arrangement on a single shaft. Key advantages of the single-shaft arrangement are operating simplicity, smaller footprint, and lower startup cost. Single-shaft arrangements, however, will tend to have less flexibility and equivalent reliability than multi-shaft blocks. Additional operational flexibility is provided with a steam turbine which can be disconnected, using a synchro-self-shifting (SSS) Clutch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sssclutch.com/howitworks/100-2SSSPrinciples.pdf|title=SSS Clutch Operating Principle|publisher=SSS Gears Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; for start up or for simple cycle operation of the gas turbine.

Multi-shaft systems have one or more gas turbine-generators and HRSGs that supply steam through a common header to a separate single steam turbine-generator. In terms of overall investment a multi-shaft system is about 5% higher in costs.

Single- and multiple-pressure non-reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems equipped with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 540&amp;nbsp;°C or less. Selection of a single- or multiple-pressure steam cycle for a specific application is determined by economic evaluation which considers plant installed cost, fuel cost and quality, plant duty cycle, and operating and maintenance cost.

Multiple-pressure reheat steam cycles are applied to combined-cycle systems with gas turbines having rating point exhaust gas temperatures of approximately 600&amp;nbsp;°C.

The most efficient power generation cycles are those with unfired HRSGs with modular pre-engineered components. These unfired steam cycles are also the lowest in cost. Supplementary-fired combined-cycle systems are provided for specific application.

The primary regions of interest for cogeneration combined-cycle systems are those with unfired and supplementary fired steam cycles. These systems provide a wide range of thermal energy to electric power ratio and represent the range of thermal energy capability and power generation covered by the product line for thermal energy and power systems.

== Efficiency of CCGT plants ==

By combining both gas and steam cycles, high input temperatures and low output temperatures can be achieved. 
The efficiency of the cycles add, because they are powered by the same fuel source. 
So, a combined cycle plant has a thermodynamic cycle that operates between the gas-turbine's high firing temperature and the [[waste heat]] temperature from the condensers of the steam cycle. 
This large range means that the [[Carnot efficiency]] of the cycle is high. 
The actual efficiency, while lower than the Carnot efficiency, is still higher than that of either plant on its own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memagazine.asme.org/Web/Efficiency_by_Numbers.cfm "Efficiency by the Numbers"] by Lee S. Langston&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/the-difference-between-lcv-and-hcv-or-lower-and-higher-heating-value-or-net-and-gross-is-clearly-understood-by-all-energy-engineers-there-is-no-right-or-wrong-definition.html|title=The difference between LCV and HCV (or Lower and Higher Heating Value, or Net and Gross) is clearly understood by all energy engineers. There is no 'right' or 'wrong' definition.|publisher=Claverton Energy Research Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The electric efficiency of a combined cycle power station, if calculated as electric energy produced as a percentage of the [[lower heating value]] of the fuel consumed, can be over 60% when operating new, i.e. unaged, and at continuous output which are ideal conditions. 
As with single cycle thermal units, combined cycle units may also deliver low temperature heat energy for industrial processes, [[district heating]] and other uses. This is called [[cogeneration]] and such power plants are often referred to as a combined heat and power (CHP) plant.

In general, combined cycle efficiencies in service are over 50% on a [[lower heating value]] and Gross Output basis. 
Most combined cycle units, especially the larger units, have peak, steady-state efficiencies on the LHV basis of 55 to 59%. 
Research aimed at {{convert|1370|C|F}} turbine inlet temperature has led to even more efficient combined cycles and nearly 60% LHV efficiency (54% HHV efficiency) has been reached in the combined cycle unit of [[Baglan Bay power station|Baglan Bay]], a GE H-technology gas turbine with a NEM 3 pressure reheat boiler, using steam from the HRSG to cool the turbine blades. 

In May 2011 [[Siemens AG]] announced they had achieved a 60.75% net efficiency with a 578 megawatts SGT5-8000H gas turbine at the [[Irsching Power Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siemens.com/press/en/pressrelease/?press=/en/pressrelease/2011/fossil_power_generation/efp201105064.htm |title= Siemens pushes world record in efficiency to over 60% while achieving maximum operating flexibility |publisher= [[Siemens AG]] |date= 19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[General Electric]] 9HA was billed to attain 41.5% simple cycle efficiency and 61.4% in combined cycle mode, with a gas turbine output of 397 MW to 470 MW and a combined output of 592 MW to 701 MW. 
Its firing temperature is between {{convert|2600|and|2900|°F|°C}}, its [[overall pressure ratio]] is 21.8 to 1 and is used by [[Électricité de France]] in [[Bouchain]]. On April 28, 2016, this plant was certified by Guinness World Records as the worlds most efficient combined cycle power plant at 62.22%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/431420-most-efficient-combined-cycle-power-plant | title=Most efficient combined cycle power plant}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Chubu Electric]]’s [[Nishi-ku, Nagoya]] power plant 405 MW 7HA is expected to have 62% gross combined cycle efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Air-cooled 7HA and 9HA designs rated at over 61% CC efficiency |publisher= Gas Turbine World |date= April 2014 |url= http://www.gasturbineworld.com/ge-7ha.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For 2018, GE offers its 826 MW HA at over 64% efficiency in combined cycle due to advances in [[additive manufacturing]] and combustion breakthroughs, up from 63.7% in 2017 orders and on track to achieve 65% by the early 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= https://www.genewsroom.com/press-releases/ha-technology-now-available-industry-first-64-percent-efficiency-284144 |title= HA technology now available at industry-first 64 percent efficiency |date= December 4, 2017 |publisher= GE Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2017, [[Mitsubishi]] claims a LHV efficiency of greater than 63% for some members of its J Series turbines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mpshq.com/j-series.html Record-Breaking Efficiency]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Difference between HHV and LHV===
{{or section|date=January 2018}}
To avoid confusion, the efficiency of heat engines and power stations should be stated relative to the Higher Heating Value (HHV) or Lower Heating Value (LHV) of the fuel, to include or exclude the heat that can be obtained from condensing the flue gas. It should also be specified whether Gross output at the generator terminals or Net Output at the power station fence is being considered.

The LHV figure is NOT a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input; it is 11% higher than that. The HHV figure is a computation of electricity net energy compared to energy content of fuel input. If the LHV approach were used for some new condensing boilers, the efficiency would calculate to be over 100%. Manufacturers prefer to cite the higher LHV efficiency, e.g. 60%, for a new CCGT, but utilities, when calculated how much electricity the plant will generate, divide this by 1.11 to get the real, e.g. 54%, HHV efficiency of that CCGT. Coal plant efficiencies are computed on a HHV basis (it doesn't make nearly as much difference for coal burn, as for gas).

The difference between HHV and LHV for gas, can be estimated (using USA units) by 1055Btu/Lb * w, where w is the lbs of water after combustion per lb of fuel. To convert the HHV of natural gas, which is 23875 Btu/lb, to an LHV (methane is 25% hydrogen) would be: 23875 – (1055*0.25*18/2) = 21500. Because the efficiency is determined by dividing the energy output by the input, and the input on an LHV basis is smaller than the HHV basis, the overall efficiency on an LHV basis is higher. So, using the ratio: 23875/21500 = 1.11 you can convert the HHV to an LHV.

So a real best-of-class baseload CCGT efficiency of 54%, as experienced by the utility operating the plant, translates to 60% LHV as the manufacturer's published headline CCGT efficiency.

===Boosting efficiency===

The efficiency of CCGT and GT can be boosted by pre-cooling combustion air. This is practised in hot climates and also has the effect of increasing power output. This is achieved by evaporative cooling of water using a moist matrix placed in front of the turbine, or by using [[Ice storage air conditioning]]. The latter has the advantage of greater improvements due to the lower temperatures available. Furthermore, ice storage can be used as a means of load control or load shifting since ice can be made during periods of low power demand and, potentially in the future the anticipated high availability of other resources such as renewables during certain periods.

== Natural gas integrated power and syngas (hydrogen) generation cycle ==
A [[natural gas]] integrated power and [[syngas]] ([[Hydrogen production|hydrogen]]) generation cycle uses semi-closed (sometimes called closed) [[gas turbine]] cycles &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.egypro.2017.03.1731|title = Demonstration of the Allam Cycle: An Update on the Development Status of a High Efficiency Supercritical Carbon Dioxide Power Process Employing Full Carbon Capture| journal=Energy Procedia| volume=114| pages=5948–5966|year = 2017|last1 = Allam|first1 = Rodney| last2=Martin| first2=Scott| last3=Forrest| first3=Brock| last4=Fetvedt| first4=Jeremy| last5=Lu| first5=Xijia| last6=Freed| first6=David| last7=Brown| first7=G.

The integrated cycle implies that, before combustion, [[methane]] (primer [[natural gas]] component) is mixed with working fluid and converted into [[syngas]] (mix of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and CO ([[carbon monoxide]])) in a catalytic [[Adiabatic process|adiabatic]] (without an indirect heat supply) reactor by using [[sensible heat]] of the hot working fluid leaving, in the simplest case, the [[gas turbine]] outlet. The largest part of produced [[syngas]] (about 75%) is directed into the [[combustion chamber]] of the [[Gas turbine|gas-turbine]] cycle to generate power, but another part of [[syngas]] (about 25%) is withdrawn from the power generation cycle as [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], or their blend to produce chemicals, fertilizers, [[synthetic fuel]]s, and etc.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Safonov, M.Granovskii, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=1993|title=Thermodynamic efficiency of co-generation of energy and hydrogen in gas-turbine cycle of methane oxidation.|url=|journal=Doklady Akademii Nauk (Rossii), 328(1993) 202-204|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov, S.Pozharskii|first=|date=2002|title=Integrated Scheme of Natural Gas Usage with Minimum Production of Entropy.|url=|journal=Canadian Journal of Chemical Engineering, 80(2002)998-1001|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M.Granovskii, M.Safonov|first=|date=2003|title=New Integrated Scheme of the Closed Gas-Turbine Cycle with Synthesis Gas Production.|url=|journal=Chemical Engineering Science, 58(2003)3913-3921|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] benefit owing to this modification is substantiated by [[exergy]] analysis. There are numerous technological options to separate [[syngas]] from working fluid and withdraw it from the cycle (e.g., condensing vapors and removing liquids, taking out gases and vapors by [[Membrane gas separation|membrane]] and [[pressure swing adsorption]] separation, [[amine gas treating]], and [[glycol dehydration]]).

All the environmental advantages of semi-closed [[gas turbine]] cycles as to an absence of [[NOx|NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;]] and the release of non-diluted [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the flue gas stay the same. An effect of integration becomes apparent with the following clarification. Assigning the efficiency of [[syngas]] production in the integrated cycle a value equal to a regular [[syngas]] production efficiency through [[Steam methane reforming|steam-methane reforming]] (some part of [[methane]] is combusted to drive [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reforming), the net-power generation efficiency (with accounting for the consumed electricity required to separate [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]]) can reach levels higher than 60% &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; at a maximum [[temperature]] in the cycle (at the [[gas turbine]] inlet) of about 1300&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C.

The [[natural gas]] integrated cycle with adiabatic catalytic reactor was firstly proposed at Chemistry Department of Moscow State Lomonosov University (Russia) in Prof. M. Safonov (late) group by M. Safonov,[http://www.linkedin.com/in/mikhail-granovskiy M. Granovskii], and S. Pozharskii in 1993.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC)==
{{Main|integrated gasification combined cycle}}
An [[integrated gasification combined cycle]], or IGCC, is a power plant using synthesis gas ([[syngas]]). Syngas can be produced from a number of sources, including coal and biomass. The system uses gas and steam turbines, the steam turbine operating off of the heat left over from the gas turbine. This process can raise electricity generation efficiency to around 50%.

==Integrated solar combined cycle (ISCC)==
An '''Integrated Solar Combined Cycle''' ('''ISCC''') is a hybrid technology in which a [[solar energy|solar thermal]] field is integrated within a combined cycle plant. In ISCC plants, solar energy is used as an auxiliary heat supply, supporting the steam cycle, which results in increased generation capacity or a reduction of fossil fuel use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ Integrated solar combined cycle plants] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928011857/http://www.abengoasolar.com/web/en/nuestros_productos/plantas_hibridas/ |date=2013-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermodynamic benefits are that daily steam turbine startup losses are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.powermag.com/fossil-fuels-solar-energy-the-future-of-electricity-generation/|title=Fossil Fuels + Solar Energy = The Future of Electricity Generation|publisher=POWER magazine|date=2009-01-04|accessdate=2017-12-25|page=1 (paragraph 7)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Major factors limiting the load output of a combined cycle power plant are the allowed pressure and temperature transients of the steam turbine and the heat recovery steam generator waiting times to establish required steam chemistry conditions and warm-up times for the balance of plant and the main piping system. Those limitations also influence the fast start-up capability of the gas turbine by requiring waiting times. And waiting gas turbines consume gas. The solar component, if the plant is started after sunshine, or before, if we have heat storage, allows us to preheat the steam to the required conditions. That is, the plant is started faster and we consume less gas before achieving operating conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energy.siemens.com/hq/pool/hq/energy-topics/pdfs/en/combined-cycle-power-plants/OperationalFlexibilityEnhancementsofCombinedCyclePowerPlants.pdf Operational Flexibility Enhancements of Combined Cycle Power Plants p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; Economic benefits are that the solar components costs are 25% to 75% those of a [[Solar Energy Generating Systems]] plant of the same collector surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf Integrated Solar Combined Cycle Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925233557/http://www.nrel.gov/csp/troughnet/pdfs/kelly_isccs_analysis.pdf |date=2013-09-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Automotive use ==
Combined cycles have traditionally only been used in large power plants. [[BMW]], however, has proposed that automobiles [[turbosteamer|use exhaust heat to drive steam turbines]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoblog.com/2005/12/09/bmw-turbosteamer-gets-hot-and-goes/ "BMW Turbosteamer gets hot and goes"] by John Neff, AutoBlog, December 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This can even be connected to the car or truck's cooling system to save space and weight, but also to provide a [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] in the same location as the radiator and preheating of the water using heat from the [[engine block]].

It may be possible to use the pistons in a reciprocating engine for both combustion and steam expansion as in the [[Six-stroke engine#Crower six-stroke engine|Crower engine]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060227/FREE/302270007/1023/THISWEEKSISSUE "Inside Bruce Crower's Six-Stroke Engine"] By Pete Lyons, AutoWeek, February 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

A turbocharged car is also a combined cycle. Bowman of Southampton offer a commercially proven add-on turbocharger which additionally can generate electric power lowering overall fuel consumption by about 8%.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

== Aeromotive use ==
Some versions of the [[Wright R-3350]] were produced as [[turbo-compound engine]]s. Three turbines driven by exhaust gases, known as ''power recovery turbines'' (unofficially "parts recovery turbines" because they ate exhaust valves on a regular basis) provided nearly 600&amp;nbsp;hp at takeoff. These turbines added power to the engine crankshaft through bevel gears and fluid couplings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.air-and-space.com/20020811%20Camarillo%20page%201.htm|title=Goleta Air and Space Museum: 2002 Camarillo EAA Fly-in|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many successful [[turbo-compound engine]] designs particularly for aircraft but their mechanical complexity and weight are less economical than multistage [[turbine engine]]s. [[Stirling engines]] are also a good theoretical fit for this application.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11001">'''Contamination control''' is the generic term for all activities aiming to control the existence, growth and proliferation of [[contamination]] in certain areas. Contamination control may refer to the atmosphere as well as to surfaces, to particulate matter as well as to microbes and to contamination prevention as well as to [[decontamination]].

[[File:Flooring at Carl Zeiss.JPG|right|thumb|Contamination control measures at a premier lens manufacturer ([[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss]])]]
[[File:Flooring in a material handling area at Pharmaceutical company Lilly, France.jpg|right|thumb|Flooring in a material handling area at the pharmaceutical company Lille, France]]
[[File:Alcatel gowning room 2.jpg|right|thumb|Gowning area at [[Alcatel-Lucent|Alcatel]], [[London]], UK]]

== Function ==
The aim of all contamination control activities is to permanently ensure a sufficient level of cleanliness in controlled environments. This is accomplished by maintaining, reducing, or eradicating  [[:wikt:viable|viable]] and non-viable contamination for either sanitary purposes or in order to maintain an efficient rate of production.

== Usage ==
One of the most common environments that incorporates contamination control into its standards protocol is the [[cleanroom]]. There are many preventive procedures in place within a cleanroom environment. They include subjecting cleanroom staff to strict clothing regulations, and there is often a gowning room where the staff can change clothes under [[Asepsis|sterile]] conditions so as to prevent any [[particulate]]s from entering from the outside environment. Certain areas in the cleanroom have more stringent measures than others: packaging areas, corridors, gowning rooms and transfer hatches incorporate strict contamination control measures in order to maintain cleanroom standards.

Contamination control is also an important asset for industrial [[laboratories]] in the [[pharmaceutical]] and life science sectors. Other places of use include automotive paint shops, entrances to industrial kitchens and food service providers, many manufacturing areas, and [[electronic component]] assembly areas.

More recently, effective contamination control has been a concern for laboratories and other sensitive environments as a bio-security [[crisis management]] measure. Some [[bank]]s and [[insurance]] companies use contamination control products as part of their [[disaster management]] protocols. Preventive measures are devised as preparation for combating potential [[pandemics]] or the proliferation of [[biohazard]]s in any potential terrorist attack.

== Types of contamination ==
Beside particulate matter such as ions and molecules, the most common types of contamination are:
* People – Hair, fibre particles from bodies and clothes, also poor hygiene leading to deposition of microorganisms
* Environment – Dust particles, contaminated air, work surfaces, gases, movement ceilings, walls and floors
* Materials – Micro organisms on packaging, packaging also creates particles, fibres, dust.
* Equipment – Moving parts shavings drive belts.
* Buildings – Paint flaking, rusty pipe work , poorly maintained surfaces.
* Water – Micro organisms grow in water. equipment not cleaned correctly left in a damp condition, spills not mopped up properly etc.

Many types organisms are potentially detrimental to processes in a critical environment. Seven of the most common contaminants are:
*''[[Aspergillus niger]]''
*''[[Burkholderia cepacia]]''
*''[[Clostridium difficile (bacteria)|Clostridium difficile]]''
*''[[Escherichia coli]]''
*[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA)
*''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]''
*''[[Salmonella enteritidis]]''

These and many other damaging contaminants can infiltrate critical areas in a number of ways. [[Particulates]] can enter by air, or on the feet of any carrier moving between the external environment and inside the critical area, for example.

== The effects of contamination ==
Contamination poses a significant risk to technical processes, experiments or production activities, as well as to the individuals involved. Unguarded proliferation of contamination can quickly lead to product damage, yield reduction, [[product recall]]s and other outcomes highly detrimental to business. Products in a range of industries are recalled due to ineffective contamination control systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/00346650010330225|title=Foreign bodies cause most recalls|first=|last=Ray Gibson|date=1 August 2000|publisher=|journal=Nutrition &amp; Food Science|volume=30|issue=4|pages=187–191|via=emeraldinsight.com (Atypon)|doi=10.1108/00346650010330225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on this evidence it could be argued that many businesses are not adequately protecting themselves from the harmful effects of contamination, and many products in many industries are being recalled due to unsafe manufacturing processes.

== Types ==
Body movement causes contamination, and protective clothing such as hats, [[cleanroom suit]]s and [[Surgical mask|face mask]]s are accordingly basic items of contamination control. Apart from people, another common way for contamination to enter is on the wheels of trolleys used to transport equipment.

To prevent airborne contamination, high-efficiency particulate air ([[HEPA]]) filters, airlocks and cleanroom suits are used. HEPA filtration systems used in the medical sector incorporate high-energy ultraviolet light units to kill the live bacteria and viruses trapped by the filter media. These measures restrict the number of particulates within the atmosphere and inhibit the growth of those that are viable.

=== Sticky mats ===
{{Main article|Sticky mat}}
Studies by 3M show that over 80% of contamination enters the cleanroom through entrances and exits, mostly at or near floor level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dycem-cc.com/faq-page|title=Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To combat this problem, suitable flooring systems are used that effectively attract, retain and inhibit the growth of viable organisms. Studies show that the most effective type of flooring system is one of polymer composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://angstromtechnology.com/what-is-a-cleanroom/|title=What is a cleanroom - How to keep a Cleanroom clean|publisher=Angstrom Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polymer mats are particularly effective due to their suppleness&lt;ref&gt;http://ask.technopharm.de/index.php5?id=1059420&amp;Action=showProduct&amp;bmp=10111{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; as they allow for more contact with serrations on shoes and wheels and can accommodate more particles while still remaining effective. An [[electrostatic potential]] adds to the effectiveness of this type of contamination control as it enables particles to be retained until the flooring is cleaned. This method of attracting and retaining particles is more effective than mats with an active [[adhesive]] coating which needs to be peeled and is often not as supple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanroomforum.com|title=Cleanroom and contamination control forum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shieldmedicare.com/english/faq/index.html|title=Ecolab - Contamination Control|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As long as the tack level of the mat is greater than the donor's (such as a foot or a wheel), the contamination touching the surface will be removed. Very high tack surfaces pose a contamination threat because they are prone to pulling off overshoe protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanroom-technology.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=10563|title=Cleanroom Technology - Current industry news and reports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209003444/http://www.cleanroom-technology.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=10563|archivedate=2008-02-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polymeric flooring is produced to ensure a higher level of tackiness than the surfaces it comes into contact with, without causing discomfort and potentially damaging 'stickiness'.

=== Copper alloy surfaces ===
{{Main|Antimicrobial properties of copper|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces}}

Copper-alloy surfaces have intrinsic properties which effectively and quickly destroy microbes and they are being installed in healthcare facilities and in a subway transit system as a protective public health measure in addition to regular cleaning. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) has approved the registration of 355 different [[Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|antibacterial copper alloys]] that kill ''[[E. coli]]'' O157:H7, ''[[methicillin]]''-resistant ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' (''[[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]''), ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''Enterobacter aerogenes'', and ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html|title=TouchSurfaces Clinical Trials: Bacteria|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723235812/http://www.coppertouchsurfaces.org/antimicrobial/bacteria/index.html|archivedate=2012-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has determined that when cleaned regularly, these copper alloy surfaces:

*Continuously reduce bacterial contamination, achieving 99.9% reduction within two hours of exposure;
*Kill greater than 99.9% of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria within two hours of exposure;
*Deliver continuous and ongoing antibacterial action, remaining effective in killing more than 99.9% of the bacteria within two hours;
*Kill more than 99.9% of the bacteria within two hours, and continue to kill 99% of the bacteria even after repeated contamination;
*Help inhibit the buildup and growth of bacteria within two hours of exposure between routine cleaning and sanitizing steps.

As a contamination control measure, EPA has approved a long list of antimicrobial copper products "with public health benefits" made from these copper alloys, such as bedrails, [[handrails]], over-bed tables, [[sinks]], [[faucets]], [[door knobs]], [[toilet]] hardware, [[computer keyboards]], [[health club]] equipment, [[shopping cart]] handles, etc. (For a comprehensive list of products, see: {{sectionlink|Antimicrobial copper-alloy touch surfaces|Approved products}}).

'''Cooling capacity''' is the measure of a cooling system's ability to remove [[heat]].&lt;ref name=Boles&gt;{{cite book|last1=Boles|first1=Yunus A.

Another common unit is the [[ton of refrigeration]], which describes the amount of water at freezing temperature that can be frozen in a day (24 hours).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cooling Capacity|url=http://www.furnacecompare.com/faq/definitions/cooling_capacity.html|publisher=Furnace Compare (furnacecompare.com)|accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictT.html How many? A Dictionary of Units of Measure]&lt;/ref&gt; 1 ton of refrigeration is equivalent to 211 kJ/min or 200 [[Btu]]/min.&lt;ref name=Boles/&gt;

The basic SI units equation for deriving cooling capacity is of the form:
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}=\dot{m}C_p\Delta T&lt;/math&gt;
Where
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is the cooling capacity [kW]
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass rate [kg/s]
:&lt;math&gt;C_p&lt;/math&gt; is the [[specific heat capacity]] [kJ/kg K]
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta T&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature change [K]

'''Culinology''', according to Jeff Cousminer in ''Food Product Design Magazine'', is a term that was coined by the first president and founder of the Research Chefs Association, Winston Riley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naturalproductsinsider.com/articles/2001/01/food-product-design-culinary-connection--january.aspx | title=Practicing Culinology | publisher = Food Product Design |date=January 2001| accessdate=2007-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the word was quite different from what it has come to mean today. Originally, the word was designed to be a combination of two words: "culinary" and "technology". So the first meaning of the word was the convergence of culinary arts and all technology, which includes communications, chemistry, physiology, economics and many others.{{cn|date=April 2014}}

There are accredited culinology educational programs offered by many institutions. The curriculums of such courses combine the disciplines of cooking and food science. According to industry professionals, such as Harry Crane, culinology should "help jump-start product development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Lisa | last=Cornwell | url=https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techinnovations/2005-08-14-culinology_x.htm | title=New degree programs produce chef-scientists | publisher=[[Associated Press]] in [[USA Today]] | date=2005-08-14 | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Culinologists work in diverse aspects of food—from experimental chefs and menu planners to food manufacturing to fine dining. The word is protected by the professional association, the Research Chefs Association, which owns the registered trademark.

The company is known for its development of the [[Aakash (tablet)|Aakash]] [[tablet computer]], which is the world's cheapest tablet at US $37.99/unit. The [[Aakash (tablet)|Aakash]] tablet was developed for [[India]]'s [[Ministry of Human Resource Development (India)|Ministry for Human Resource Development (MHRD)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/meet-aakash-indias-35-laptop/?scp=1&amp;sq=Aakash&amp;st=cse&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first1=Pamposh | last1=Raina | first2=Heather | last2=Timmons | title=Meet Aakash, India's $35 ‘Laptop' | date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=b|first=a|title=Aakash: World's cheapest tablet launched; to be sold for $60 in retail|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2011-10-05/news/30246812_1_tablet-mobile-phones-sim|publisher=Economic Times(India)|accessdate=October 5, 2011|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datawind manufactures a series of mobile, internet devices, such as PocketSurfer smartphones, UbiSurfer netbooks, and Ubislate tablets, and formerly the [[Aakash]] tablets on behalf of the Government of India. The company's devices use a patented, web-delivery platform for faster and low-cost internet access on mobile networks. Datawind used to be listed on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]], but was relisted on the Toronto Venture Exchange in October 2018 after failing to meet listing requirements.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/datawind-to-delist-from-tsx-and-transfer-listing-to-nex-2018-10-10|title=Datawind to Delist from TSX and Transfer Listing to NEX|work=MarketWatch|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Suneet Tuli is Datawind's chief executive officer and is responsible for its vision, strategy, and execution. Raja Tuli is the company's co-chairman and chief technology officer; he is also an inventor with dozens of patents across a broad range of technologies related to the internet, to imaging, and to energy sustenance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/how-a-montreal-company-won-the-race-to-build-the-worlds-cheapest-tablet/article548496/?page=all https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-magazine/how-a-montreal-company-won-the-race-to-build-the-worlds-cheapest-tablet/article548496/?page=all]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Datawind's product range includes PocketSurfer Smartphones and UbiSlate tablets. The company has a portfolio of 14 international patents for its web-delivery platform, which serves as the basis for its product innovations. The company manufactures, markets, and sells UbiSlate tablets to consumers worldwide and also provides a year of free internet browsing in various countries. In collaboration with the government of India, the company has also developed the Aakash tablet, which has gained worldwide attention for being the cheapest tablet.

With its research and development based in Montreal, the company launched its first products in 2004 &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2013-10/18/suneet-singh-tuli&lt;br&gt;

In 2009, the Indian government had pledged a low-cost laptop to improve the quality of education within the country; however, the development process was beset by delays until Datawind won the tender for the tablet in late 2011. In the same year, Datawind made its entry into the Indian market with the launch of the Aakash tablet, developed for the Indian government to enhance the quality of education. To enable ubiquitous, nationwide internet use, the Indian government announced at the October 2011 launch of the Aakash tablet that it will be offered to students at a subsidized price of $35&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and to the public (as the ''Ubislate 7'') for $60.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; At the subsidized price, the tablet would cost the same as a pair of shoes or a basic mobile phone.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some analysts claim that the tablet will not only have a positive impact on the education sector but will also lead to positive changes in healthcare and other sectors besides improving internet penetration in the country. In his study, Rajat Kathuria, external consultant at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), stated that the Indian economy could grow 10.08% faster with every 10% increase in internet and broadband connections in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wadhva|first=Vivek|title=Affordable tablets will give the poor a voice|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-09-22/all-that-matters/42291256_1_aakash-tablet-datawind-india-start|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=September 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ubislate tablets were commercially launched in April 2012, by which time bookings for the device had exceeded three-million units - more than ten times the size of the total market for tablets in India in the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cerejo|first=Roydon|title=Datawind launches Ubislate 7+ and 7C tablets in India|url=http://tech2.in.com/news/tablets/datawind-launches-ubislate-7-and-7c-tablets-in-india/301752|work=tech2.in|accessdate=26 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the commercial launch of the UbiSlate tablets, the company has been among the top three suppliers of tablets in India, according to Cybermedia Research. In the first quarter of 2013, Datawind dominated the Indian, tablet market with the largest market share of tablets sold in India, excluding the Aakash devices that were to be supplied to the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Puri|first=Nitin|title=Datawind becomes India's leading tablet maker for Q1 2013|url=http://tech2.in.com/news/tablets/datawind-launches-ubislate-7-and-7c-tablets-in-india/301752|publisher=Mobile India|accessdate=June 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Going forward, the company has plans to expose itself to tablet markets in the UK, the US, and Canada.

On 26 April 2012, Datawind launched Ubislate 7+ and 7C tablets in India, by which time three- million units had already been booked.

In 2013, according to Cyber Media Research, India‘s quarterly market report, during the first quarter of 2013, as published in [[The Times of India]], Datawind had a market share of 15.3%; the company pulled ahead of rivals Micromax and [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], although this strong market did not include the Aakash series of tablets&lt;ref name="india.blogs.nytimes.com"&gt;[http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/a-conversation-with-datawinds-suneet-singh-tuli/?_r=0 http://india.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/31/a-conversation-with-datawinds-suneet-singh-tuli/?_r=0]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Datawind's low-cost devices allow access to the internet at lower, data costs and faster speeds across congested mobile wireless networks by using the company's patented data compression technology, which serves Web pages as compressed images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gough|first=Andrew|title=Business Traveller takes a look at the smart little Datawind Ubisurfer|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/tried-and-tested/technology/tried-and-tested-the-datawind-ubisurfer|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=Business Traveller}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2011 interview, the company stated that it would lower the price of the tablet by developing patents to shift the device's processing burden to "backend servers in the cloud,"&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite news

DataWind's web-delivery platform reduces bandwidth consumption by creating a parallel processing environment, which shifts the burden of memory and processing power to back-end servers, thus allowing users to access the web with a lower-cost device and lower data costs.

Datawind's web-delivery platform serves as the basis for its product innovations. Based on a patent portfolio of 14 US and international patents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Datawind Aakash2 project completion|url=http://www.dqweek.com/dq-week/news/188022/datawind-announces-aakash2-project-completion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%252Fnetahtml%252FPTO%252Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=raja&amp;FIELD1=IN&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=tuli&amp;FIELD2=IN&amp;d=PG01 http://appft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=raja&amp;FIELD1=IN&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=tuli&amp;FIELD2=IN&amp;d=PG01]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; DataWind's technology accelerates the delivery of web-content across wireless networks, and reduces data consumption by a factor of ten.

Datawind's acceleration and data-reduction is accomplished through the use of proprietary algorithms on its application servers, which constitute a gateway between the primary (Internet-based) content server, selected by the user, and the end user.

Datawind claims that its patented, acceleration technology allows its devices to deliver the fastest, mobile-web experience across cellular networks. A product review by [[PC Magazine]] of the Pocket Surfer stated that "it’s the only device that allows users to browse the web on a GPRS connection with any alacrity." In 2005, [[CNET]] stated that it was impressed with Pocket Surfer's page-load times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnet.com/products/datawind-pocketsurfer/&lt;/ref&gt; Various media outlets conducted live, speed tests on television with competitive products, including some on 3G networks, which resulted in DataWind's Pocket Surfer beating its competition in terms of page download time.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zwn4Rh_e_vc&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business Model==
Datawind's business model focuses on providing to entry-level users a cost-effective, web-access device with free Internet access. The company, as a mobile, virtual-network operator (MVNO), purchases wholesale access to mobile data from wireless-network operators or as part of a bundling relationship in order to offer free, mobile-internet access to its customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=MVNO Dynamics|title=Datawind to launch 99 with bundled data via an MVNO in UK: Total Telecom|url=http://www.mvnodynamics.com/2012/01/28/datawind-to-launch-99-tablet-with-bundled-data-via-an-mvno-in-uk-total-telecom/|accessdate=26 May 2014|date=28 Jan 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Datawind's web-delivery platform reduces bandwidth consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=PTI|title=After Aakash, Datawind launches low cost tablets starting at Rs 3999|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/tech/hardware/after-aakash-datawind-launches-low-cost-tablets-starting-at-rs-3999/articleshow_opt/23827617.cms|accessdate=26 May 2014|newspaper=www.economictimes.com|date=Oct 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2012, in an interview with the [[The New York Times|New York Times]], Datawind‘s CEO explained that the company‘s business model was focused on pursuing price-sensitive, entry-level consumers, on forgoing hardware margins, and on driving a recurring revenue stream (i.e. after sales revenue from network operators, content, subscriptions, device warranties, page impressions, location-based content and advertising). Datawind's advertising revenues are generated by loading applications on its devices.&lt;ref name="india.blogs.nytimes.com"/&gt; The company has formulated a full-service ecosystem of revenue streams that drive down the cost of hardware; hence, the devices act as customer- acquisition tools that provide "free mobile-internet services". Datawind has partnered with numerous firms as part of a comprehensive supplier-and-partner strategy to build applications and generate content for its devices.

== Content, Applications and Advertising Based Partnerships  ==

Datawind has partnerships with multiple firms to develop installed, free content for its devices. The content includes educational, language-based, interactive smart books, multimedia, games, and productivity tools.

On 20 November 2013, according to an article published in [[The Financial Express (India)|The Financial Express]], "DataWind, driving its mission to see smart devices as education tools, partnered with American education provider [[CK-12 Foundation]] providing high quality free mathematics and science learning content that can be used by teachers, students, schools and parents."  CK-12 content would be installed on most of the company's devices; the company stated that installed content on tablets will allow students to learn at their own pace, regardless of their locations; also, this content may be updated at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Datawind tablets to have CK-12 content for free|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/datawind-tablets-to-have-ck12-content-for-free/1196422|accessdate=15 December 2013|newspaper=Financial Express|date=Nov 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Datawind announced content partnerships with [[The Indian Express Group]] and [[Yahoo!]]. According to this agreement the Ubislate 7+ and the Ubislate 7C will come with the Indian Express news application, and customers of these new tablets will receive a 50% discount on annual subscriptions of The Indian Express and The Financial Express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Ubislate 7+ apps and Datawind’s Partnerships|url=http://thetechgears.com/list-of-ubislate-7-apps-and-datawinds-partnerships/|work=thetechgears.com|publisher=Tech Gear}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tablets will also come with Yahoo! Cricket, the Yahoo! Mail application. Yahoo! India will be the default-browser homepage for the Ubislate 7+.

Datawind has also partnered with Blueworld portal to encourage a socially conscious approach to the internet. Blueworld is a social community, which allows anyone to create a profile and to connect with friends, to meet people, to upload an unlimited number of photos, to share videos, to write blogs, to support peers through groups, and to send text messages.

On December 3, 2013, Datawind partnered with IT firm [[Happiest Minds|Happiest Minds Technologies]] to develop applications and solutions for its UbiSlate range of tablets.

'''Drag-reducing agents''' (DRA), or '''drag-reducing polymers''' (DRP's), are additives in pipelines that reduce [[turbulence]] in a pipe. Usually used in [[petroleum]] [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], they increase the pipeline capacity by reducing turbulency and therefore allowing the oil to [[volumetric flow rate|flow]] more efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How Drag Reducing Agents Work|url=http://liquidpower.com/what-is-dra/about-dra-and-how-it-works/|website=www.liquidpower.com|publisher=LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc.|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Drag reducing agents can be broadly classified under the following four categories – [[Polymers]], Solid-particle [[suspensions]], Biological additives, and [[Surfactants]].  These agents are made out of high molecular weight [[polymers]] or micellar systems. The [[polymers]] help with drag reduction by decreasing turbulence in the oil lines. This allows for oil to be pumped through at lower pressures, saving energy and money. Although these drag reducing agents are mostly used in oil lines, there is research being done to see how helpful [[polymers]] could be in reducing drag in [[veins]] and [[arteries]].

==How it works==

Using just a few parts per million of the drag reducer helps to reduce the turbulence inside the pipe. Because the oil pushes up against the inside wall of the pipe, the pipe pushes the oil back down causing a swirling of turbulence to occur. When the polymer is added, it interacts with the oil and the wall to help reduce the contact of the oil with the wall.

[[Polymer degradation|Degradation]] can occur on the polymers during the flow. Because of the pressure and temperature on the polymers, it is easier to break them down. Because of this, the drag reducing agent is re-injected after points like pumps and turns, where the pressure and temperature can be extra high. To safeguard against [[degradation (chemistry)|degradation]] at high temperature, a different class of drag reducing agents are at times used, namely, [[surfactants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01524753 | volume=15 | title=Drag reduction with surfactants at elevated temperatures | year=1976 | journal=Rheologica Acta | pages=658–664 | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Surfactant]]'' is a very convenient contraction of the term ''Surface-active agent''.  It connotes an organic molecule or an unformulated compound having surface-active properties.  All three classes of [[surfactants]], namely, [[anionic]], [[cationic]] and [[nonionic]] [[surfactants]], have been successfully tried as drag-reducing agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01410471 | volume=262 | title=A review on drag reduction with special reference to micellar systems | year=1984 | journal=Colloid &amp; Polymer Science | pages=319–337 | last1 = Shenoy | first1 = A. V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing what will create the ideal drag reducer is key in this process. Ideal molecules have a high [[molecular weight]], shear degradation resistance, are quick to dissolve in whatever is in the pipe, and have low degradation in heat, light, chemicals, and biological areas.

With drag reduction, there are many factors which play a role in how well the drag is reduced. A main factor in this is [[temperature]]. With a higher temperature, the drag reducing agent is easier to degrade. At a low temperature the drag reducing agent will tend to cluster together. This problem can be solved easier than degradation though, by adding another chemical, such as [[aluminum]] to help lower the drag reducing agent's attraction to one another. Another factor is the pipe diameter. With a decreasing pipe diameter, the drag reduction is increased. Going along with this, the roughness of the inside of the pipe has a factor. The rougher the inside, the higher the percent drag reduction occurring. Increasing the pressure in a pipe will help with drag reduction as well, but often that pressure is greater than what the pipe can withstand.

==Areas of use==

Drag reducing agents have been found useful in reducing turbulence in the shipbuilding industry, for fire-fighting operations, oil-well fracturing processes, in irrigation systems and in central heating devices. Drag reducers can work in a couple of different fields. The most popular are [[crude oil]], refined products and non-potable water. Currently there are several studies with ongoing tests in rats looking to see if drag reducers can help with blood flow.

==History==

The earliest works that recorded a decrease in pressure drop during turbulent flow were undertaken in the thirties&lt;ref&gt;Forrest, G. (1931) Paper Trade J, Vol. 22, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brautlecht, C. A. and Sethi, J. R. (1933) Ind. Eng. Chem., Vol. 25, p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brecht, W. and Heller, H. (1939) Das Papier p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; and concerned the transportation of paper pulp.  This was, however, not explicitly referred to as a drag reduction phenomenon.  Toms&lt;ref&gt;Toms, B. A. (1948) Proc. 1st Intern. Congress on Rheology, Vol. II, pp. 135-141, North Holland, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; was the first to recognize the tremendous reduction in wall shear stress caused by the addition of small amount of linear macromolecules to a turbulent flowing fluid.  An extensive bibliography of the first 25 years of drag reduction by polymer additives literature identified over 270 references.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nash|first1=J. M.|last2=Wylie|first2=K.F|title=A Guide to Drag Reduction by Polymer Additives|journal=Previews of Heat and Mass Transfer|date=October 1975|volume= 2|issue= 1|pages=70–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag reducers were introduced into the market in the early 1970s by Conoco Inc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LSPI Timeline|url=http://www.liquidpower.com/about-lspi/history/|website=www.liquidpower.com|publisher=LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc.|accessdate=4 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as LiquidPower Specialty Products Inc. (LSPI), [http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/subs/sublinks.html a Berkshire Hathaway Company]). Its use has allowed pipeline systems to greatly increase in traditional capacity and extended the life of existing systems. The higher flow rates possible on long pipelines have also increased the potential for surge on older systems not previously designed for high velocities.

Both proprietary (such as Conoco T-83) and non-proprietary (such as poly-isobutylene) drag reduction additives have been evaluated by the U.S. Army Mobility Equipment Research and Development Center for enhancement of military petroleum pipeline systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treiber|first1=K.L.|last2=Nash|first2=J.M.|last3=Neradka|first3=V.F.|title=Military Pipeline Experience with Drag Reduction Additives|journal=Fluid Mechanics in the Petroleum Industry, American Society of Mechanical Engineers|date=1975|pages=37–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">An instrument for measuring various parameters of an electrical power distribution system is often called an '''energy analyser'''. The term is also used for [[computer software]] for analysing the use of electrical or other [[energy]] use, for example determining how electrical power is consumed in a building with a view to reducing waste, calculate loads and costs associated with air conditioning, heating, and on-site power generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interenergysoftware.com/BEA/BEA.htm Description of "Building Energy Analyzer" software]&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of HPC/Grid/Cloud computing, EnergyAnalyzer tool development project, an ongoing DST funded project (2011-2014) from,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sxcce.edu.in/hpccloud "HPCCLoud Research Laboratory" ]&lt;/ref&gt; the HPCCLoud Research Laboratory, India is on progress. The EnergyAnalyzer tool development project aims at designing and implementing the EnergyAnalyzer tool which does &lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6349513  "energy consumption analysis and tuning of HPC applications" on peta-exa scale machines]&lt;/ref&gt; energy consumption analysis and tuning of HPC applications using distributed semantic agents.

An electrical energy analyser might measure for single- and three-phase systems  [[volt]]s [[Root mean square|RMS]], [[ampere|amp]]s RMS, [[power factor]], instantaneous [[Power (physics)|power]] in [[watt]]s (W), instantaneous [[volt-ampere]]s (VA), reactive volt-amperes (VAr), [[frequency]] (Hz), average and maximum powers (W), [[harmonic distortion]], energy in [[watt-hour]]s (Wh), reactive volt-ampere-hours (VArh), and [[phase angle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duncaninstr.com/vipsys3.htm List of parameters measured by a typical energy analyser]&lt;/ref&gt; Power- and energy-related parameters tend to be stated in kilowatts rather than watts&amp;mdash;kW, kVA, kVAr, kWh, kVArh. For non-sinusoidal periodic waveforms, some instruments can measure [[harmonic]]s. The instrument, in addition to displaying values, may print or store them, [[computer network|network]]  with other similar instruments at different locations, interact with [[computer software]], etc.

The term is also used for a quite different '''[[electrostatic analyzer]]''' or electrostatic energy analyzer, an instrument used in [[ion optics]] that employs an [[electric field]] to allow the passage of only those [[ions]] or [[electrons]] that have a given specific [[energy]].

'''Extensible Forms Description Language''' ('''XFDL''') is a high-level [[computer language]] that facilitates defining a form as a single, stand-alone object using elements and attributes from [[XML| the Extensible Markup Language (XML)]]. Technically, it is a class of XML originally specified in a [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) Note.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/NOTE-XFDL-19980902 Extensible Forms Description Language (XFDL) 4.0], W3C Note, 2 SEP 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  See Specifications below for links to the current versions of XFDL.  XFDL It offers precise control over form layout, permitting replacement of existing business/government forms with electronic documents in a human-readable, [[open standard]].

In addition to precision layout control, XFDL provides multiple page capabilities, step-by-step guided user experiences, and [[digital signature]]s.  XFDL also provides a syntax for in-line mathematical and conditional expressions and data validation constraints as well as custom items, options, and external code functions.  Current versions of XFDL (see Specifications below) are capable of providing these interactive features via open standard markup languages including XForms,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/REC-xforms-20091020/ XForms 1.1], W3C Recommendation, 20 OCT 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; XPath,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xpath-19991116 XML Path Language (XPath) Version 1.0], W3C Recommendation, 16 NOV 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; XML Schema&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/ XML Schema Part 1: Structures Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004;
[http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-2-20041028/ XML Schema Part 2: Datatypes Second Edition], W3C Recommendation, 28 OCT 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and XML Signatures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xmldsig-core-20080610/ XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition)], W3C Recommendation, 10 JUN 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

XFDL not only supports multiple digital signatures, but the signatures can apply to specific sections of a form and prevent changes to signed content.

These advantages to XFDL led large organizations such as the [[United States Army]] and [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] to migrate to XFDL from using forms in other formats. Later, though, the lack of portable software capable of creating XFDL led them to investigate moving away from it. The Army migrated to [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] fillable [[PDF]]s in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://armypubs.army.mil/news/Memo_Army_Migrating_to_Adobe_Fillable_Forms_10Jul13_Redacted.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:FastPort on SonyEricsson W205.jpg|thumb|FastPort female plug on a [[Sony Ericsson]] [[Sony Ericsson W205|W205]] mobile phone.]]
The '''FastPort''' was a proprietary polyconnection interface used on all [[Sony Ericsson]] [[cellphone]]s between 2005 and 2010. Designed in response to Nokia's  proprietary [[Nokia Pop-Port|Pop-Port]], FastPort provided data transfer, charging, headset and speaker connections through a common interface. It was discontinued in 2010 and replaced with a [[MicroUSB#Mini_and_Micro_connectors|micro-USB]] for charging and data, and a [[TRS_connector|TRRS]] connection for audio (headphones).

==Functions==
===Transfer of data and files === 
[[File:Sony Ericsson DCU-60 Cable FastPort.JPG|thumb|FastPort male plug on a Sony Ericsson DCU-60 data cable. The raised polarity key can be seen on the outer edge of the left hand side hook.]]
A [[USB]] FastPort-cable enables file and data transfer between a [[computer]] and a Sony Ericsson cellphone. Most models could act as a USB-storage-device, [[modem]], phone and could load new [[firmware]] either with Sony Ericsson Update Service application, or with 3rd party software. FastPort was the interface to the PC to realize these functions.

===Charging the battery/powering the phone === 
The port can charge the battery and power the phone while it is connected to, for example, a hands-free solution in a car. The FastPort became the only way to get external power to the phones. Chargers comes in several varieties, from 12/24 volt DC to use in cars, to 100-250 volt AC to use elsewhere.  Some charger-models can only charge the phone (the cable is attached at the middle), in others all the connector pins through to the plug end, thus supporting data/signal transfer while the phone is being charged.

=== Sound accessories and headsets === 
The port also connects wired headsets or speakers, etc.

==Location==
Originally, the FastPort was placed on the bottom edge of the phone (when viewed from the front), for a while on the top edge, and finally on the left edge. These changes caused some accessories to become unusable, such as holders with charging options and docks.

==Layout==
The connector has 12 pins for electrical connections (both power and data), 2 double-sided "hooks" on the plug and matching holes in the phones connector for keeping the plug safely in place. One hook contains a small polarity key to prevent the connector being inserted upside down. The dimension of the connector on the phone is approximately {{convert|20|×|5|mm|abbr=on}}. To help users identify the type of cable and see how to correctly insert the plug, a small symbol is placed on the side intended to be towards the front of the phone. Powerplugs display a small lightning bolt, headsets and hands-free-plugs show an old-fashioned headset, data-cables present a computer screen and music accessories reveal a note-sign.

'''Fault tolerance''' is the property that enables a [[system]] to continue operating properly in the event of the failure of some (one or more faults within) of its components. If its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the failure, as compared to a native designed system in which even a small failure can cause total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in [[high-availability]] or [[life-critical system]]s.  The ability of maintaining functionality when portions of a system break down is referred to as '''graceful degradation'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1186&amp;context=cs_faculty_pubs Adaptive Fault Tolerance and Graceful Degradation], Oscar González et al., 1997, University of Massachusetts - Amherst&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''fault-tolerant design''' enables a system to continue its intended operation, possibly at a reduced level, rather than failing completely, when some part of the system [[failure|fails]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, B. W. (1984). "Fault-Tolerant Microprocessor-Based Systems", IEEE Micro, vol. 4, no. 6, pp. 6–21&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most commonly used to describe [[computer system]]s designed to continue more or less fully operational with, perhaps, a reduction in [[throughput]] or an increase in [[response time (technology)|response time]] in the event of some partial failure. That is, the system as a whole is not stopped due to problems either in the [[computer hardware|hardware]] or the [[software]]. An example in another field is a motor vehicle designed so it will continue to be drivable if one of the tires is punctured, or a structure that is able to retain its integrity in the presence of damage due to causes such as [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]], [[corrosion]], manufacturing flaws, or impact.

Within the scope of an ''individual'' system, fault tolerance can be achieved by anticipating exceptional conditions and building the system to cope with them, and, in general, aiming for [[self-stabilization]] so that the system converges towards an error-free state. However, if the consequences of a system failure are catastrophic, or the cost of making it sufficiently reliable is very high, a better solution may be to use some form of duplication. In any case, if the consequence of a system failure is so catastrophic, the system must be able to use reversion to fall back to a safe mode. This is similar to roll-back recovery but can be a human action if humans are present in the loop.

==Terminology==

[[Image:Graceful Degradation of Transparency.png|thumb|256px|right|An example of graceful degradation by design in an image with transparency. The top two images are each the result of viewing the composite image in a viewer that recognises transparency. The bottom two images are the result in a viewer with no support for transparency. Because the transparency mask (center bottom) is discarded, only the overlay (center top) remains; the image on the left has been designed to degrade gracefully, hence is still meaningful without its transparency information.]]
A highly fault-tolerant system might continue at the same level of performance even though one or more components have failed.  For example, a building with a backup electrical generator will provide the same voltage to wall outlets even if the grid power fails.

A system that is designed to [[fail safe]], or fail-secure, or '''fail gracefully''', whether it functions at a reduced level or fails completely, does so in a way that protects people, property, or data from injury, damage, intrusion, or disclosure.  In computers, a program might fail-safe by executing a [[graceful exit]] (as opposed to an uncontrolled crash) in order to prevent data corruption after experiencing an error.  A similar distinction is made between "failing well" and "[[failing badly]]".

[[Fail-deadly]] is the opposite strategy, which can be used in weapon systems that are designed to kill or injure targets even if part of the system is damaged or destroyed.

A system that is designed to experience '''graceful degradation''', or to '''fail soft''' (used in computing, similar to "fail safe"&lt;ref&gt;Stallings, W (2009): Operating Systems. Internals and Design Principles'', sixth edition&lt;/ref&gt;) operates at a reduced level of performance after some component failures.  For example, a building may operate lighting at reduced levels and elevators at reduced speeds if grid power fails, rather than either trapping people in the dark completely or continuing to operate at full power.  In computing an example of graceful degradation is that if insufficient network bandwidth is available to stream an online video, a lower-resolution version might be streamed in place of the high-resolution version.  [[Progressive enhancement]] is an example in computing, where web pages are available in a basic functional format for older, small-screen, or limited-capability web browsers, but in an enhanced version for browsers capable of handling additional technologies or that have a larger display available.

In [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s, programs that are considered [[Robustness (computer science)|robust]] are designed to continue operation despite an error, exception, or invalid input, instead of crashing completely.  [[Software brittleness]] is the opposite of robustness.  [[Resilience (network)|Resilient networks]] continue to transmit data despite the failure of some links or nodes; [[Resilience (engineering and construction)|resilient buildings and infrastructure]] are likewise expected to prevent complete failure in situations like earthquakes, floods, or collisions.

A system with high [[failure transparency]] will alert users that a component failure has occurred, even if it continues to operate with full performance, so that failure can be repaired or imminent complete failure anticipated.  Likewise, a [[fail-fast]] component is designed to report at the first point of failure, rather than allow downstream components to fail and generate reports then.  This allows easier diagnosis of the underlying problem, and may prevent improper operation in a broken state.

==Redundancy==
{{main article|Redundancy (engineering)}}
Redundancy is the provision of functional capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault-free environment.&lt;ref&gt;Laprie, J. C. (1985). "Dependable Computing and Fault Tolerance: Concepts and Terminology", Proceedings of 15th International Symposium on Fault-Tolerant Computing (FTSC-15), pp. 2–11&lt;/ref&gt;
This can consist of backup components that automatically "kick in" if one component fails. For example, large cargo trucks can lose a tire without any major consequences. They have many tires, and no one tire is critical (with the exception of the front tires, which are used to steer, but generally carry less load, each and in total, than the other four to 16, so are less likely to fail).
The idea of incorporating redundancy in order to improve the reliability of a system was pioneered by [[John von Neumann]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;von Neumann, J. (1956). "Probabilistic Logics and Synthesis of Reliable Organisms from Unreliable Components", in Automata Studies, eds. C. Shannon and J. McCarthy,  Princeton University Press, pp. 43–98&lt;/ref&gt;

Two kinds of redundancy are possible:&lt;ref&gt;Avizienis, A. (1976). "Fault-Tolerant Systems", IEEE Transactions on Computers, vol. 25, no. 12, pp. 1304–1312&lt;/ref&gt; space redundancy and time redundancy. Space redundancy provides additional components, functions, or data items that are unnecessary for fault-free operation.  Space redundancy is further classified into hardware, software and information redundancy, depending on the type of redundant resources added to the system.  In time redundancy the computation or data transmission is repeated and the result is compared to a stored copy of the previous result. The current terminology for this kind of testing is referred to as 'In Service Fault Tolerance Testing or ISFTT for short.

==Criteria==
Providing fault-tolerant design for every component is normally not an option. Associated redundancy brings a number of penalties: increase in weight, size, power consumption, cost, as well as time to design, verify, and test. Therefore, a number of choices have to be examined to determine which components should be fault tolerant:&lt;ref&gt;Dubrova, E. (2013). "Fault-Tolerant Design", Springer, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4614-2112-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''How critical is the component?''' In a car, the radio is not critical, so this component has less need for fault tolerance.
* '''How likely is the component to fail?''' Some components, like the drive shaft in a car, are not likely to fail, so no fault tolerance is needed.
* '''How expensive is it to make the component fault tolerant?''' Requiring a redundant car engine, for example, would likely be too expensive both economically and in terms of weight and space, to be considered.

An example of a component that passes all the tests is a car's occupant restraint system. While we do not normally think of the ''primary'' occupant restraint system, it is [[gravity]]. If the vehicle rolls over or undergoes severe g-forces, then this primary method of occupant restraint may fail. Restraining the occupants during such an accident is absolutely critical to safety, so we pass the first test. Accidents causing occupant ejection were quite common before [[seat belt]]s, so we pass the second test. The cost of a redundant restraint method like seat belts is quite low, both economically and in terms of weight and space, so we pass the third test. Therefore, adding seat belts to all vehicles is an excellent idea. Other "supplemental restraint systems", such as [[airbag]]s, are more expensive and so pass that test by a smaller margin.

Another excellent and long-term example of this principle being put into practice is the braking system: whilst the actual brake mechanisms are critical, they are not particularly prone to sudden (rather than progressive) failure, and are in any case necessarily duplicated to allow even and balanced application of brake force to all wheels. It would also be prohibitively costly to further double-up the main components and they would add considerable weight. However, the similarly critical systems for actuating the brakes under driver control are inherently less robust, generally using a cable (can rust, stretch, jam, snap) or hydraulic fluid (can leak, boil and develop bubbles, absorb water and thus lose effectiveness). Thus in most modern cars the footbrake hydraulic brake circuit is diagonally divided to give two smaller points of failure, the loss of either only reducing brake power by 50% and not causing as much dangerous brakeforce imbalance as a straight front-back or left-right split, and should the hydraulic circuit fail completely (a relatively very rare occurrence), there is a failsafe in the form of the cable-actuated parking brake that operates the otherwise relatively weak rear brakes, but can still bring the vehicle to a safe halt in conjunction with transmission/engine braking so long as the demands on it are in line with normal traffic flow. The culmulatively unlikely combination of total footbrake failure with the need for harsh braking in an emergency will likely result in a collision, but still one at lower speed than would otherwise have been the case.

In comparison with the footpedal activated service brake, the parking brake itself is a less critical item, and unless it is being used as a one-time backup for the footbrake, will not cause immediate danger if it is found to be nonfunctional at the moment of application. Therefore, no redundancy is built into it per se (and it typically uses a cheaper, lighter, but less hardwearing cable actuation system), and it can suffice, if this happens on a hill, to use the footbrake to momentarily hold the vehicle still, before driving off to find a flat piece of road on which to stop. Alternatively, on shallow gradients, the transmission can be shifted into Park, Reverse or First gear, and the transmission lock / engine compression used to hold it stationary, as there is no need for them to include the sophistication to first bring it to a halt.

On motorcycles, a similar level of fail-safety is provided by simpler methods; firstly the front and rear brake systems being entirely separate, regardless of their method of activation (that can be cable, rod or hydraulic), allowing one to fail entirely whilst leaving the other unaffected. Secondly, the rear brake is relatively strong compared to its automotive cousin, even being a powerful disc on sports models, even though the usual intent is for the front system to provide the vast majority of braking force; as the overall vehicle weight is more central, the rear tyre is generally larger and grippier, and the rider can lean back to put more weight on it, therefore allowing more brake force to be applied before the wheel locks up. On cheaper, slower utility-class machines, even if the front wheel should use a hydraulic disc for extra brake force and easier packaging, the rear will usually be a primitive, somewhat inefficient, but exceptionally robust rod-actuated drum, thanks to the ease of connecting the footpedal to the wheel in this way and, more importantly, the near impossibility of catastrophic failure even if the rest of the machine, like a lot of low-priced bikes after their first few years of use, is on the point of collapse from neglected maintenance.

==Requirements==

The basic characteristics of fault tolerance require:

# No [[single point of failure]] – If a system experiences a failure, it must continue to operate without interruption during the repair process.
# [[Fault isolation]] to the failing component – When a failure occurs, the system must be able to isolate the failure to the offending component. This requires the addition of dedicated failure detection mechanisms that exist only for the purpose of fault isolation. Recovery from a fault condition requires classifying the fault or failing component. The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) categorizes faults based on locality, cause, duration, and effect.{{Where|date=June 2017}}{{clarify|date=June 2017}}
# Fault containment to prevent propagation of the failure – Some failure mechanisms can cause a system to fail by propagating the failure to the rest of the system. An example of this kind of failure is the "rogue transmitter" that can swamp legitimate communication in a system and cause overall system failure. [[Firewall (computing)|Firewall]]s or other mechanisms that isolate a rogue transmitter or failing component to protect the system are required.
# Availability of [[Reversion (software development)|reversion modes]]{{clarify|date=June 2014}}

In addition, fault-tolerant systems are characterized in terms of both planned service outages and unplanned service outages. These are usually measured at the application level and not just at a hardware level. The figure of merit is called [[availability]] and is expressed as a percentage. For example, a [[5 nines|five nines]] system would statistically provide 99.999% availability.

Fault-tolerant systems are typically based on the concept of redundancy.

==Replication==

Spare components address the first fundamental characteristic of fault tolerance in three ways:
* [[Replication (computer science)|Replication]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system or subsystem, directing tasks or requests to all of them in [[parallel computing|parallel]], and choosing the correct result on the basis of a [[quorum]];
* [[Redundancy (engineering)|Redundancy]]: Providing multiple identical instances of the same system and switching to one of the remaining instances in case of a failure ([[failover]]);
* Diversity: Providing multiple ''different'' implementations of the same specification, and using them like replicated systems to cope with errors in a specific implementation.

All implementations of [[RAID]], [[RAID|redundant array of independent disks]], except RAID 0, are examples of a fault-tolerant [[data storage device|storage device]] that uses [[data redundancy]].

A [[lockstep (computing)|lockstep]] fault-tolerant machine uses replicated elements operating in parallel. At any time, all the replications of each element should be in the same state. The same inputs are provided to each [[replication (computing)|replication]], and the same outputs are expected. The outputs of the replications are compared using a voting circuit. A machine with two replications of each element is termed [[dual modular redundancy|dual modular redundant]] (DMR). The voting circuit can then only detect a mismatch and recovery relies on other methods. A machine with three replications of each element is termed [[triple modular redundancy|triple modular redundant]] (TMR). The voting circuit can determine which replication is in error when a two-to-one vote is observed. In this case, the voting circuit can output the correct result, and discard the erroneous version. After this, the internal state of the erroneous replication is assumed to be different from that of the other two, and the voting circuit can switch to a DMR mode. This model can be applied to any larger number of replications.

[[Lockstep (computing)|Lockstep]] fault-tolerant machines are most easily made fully [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronous]], with each gate of each replication making the same state transition on the same edge of the clock, and the clocks to the replications being exactly in phase. However, it is possible to build lockstep systems without this requirement.

Bringing the replications into synchrony requires making their internal stored states the same. They can be started from a fixed initial state, such as the reset state. Alternatively, the internal state of one replica can be copied to another replica.

One variant of DMR is '''pair-and-spare'''. Two replicated elements operate in lockstep as a pair, with a voting circuit that detects any mismatch between their operations and outputs a signal indicating that there is an error. Another pair operates exactly the same way. A final circuit selects the output of the pair that does not proclaim that it is in error. Pair-and-spare requires four replicas rather than the three of TMR, but has been used commercially.

==Disadvantages==
Fault-tolerant design's advantages are obvious, while many of its disadvantages are not:

* '''Interference with fault detection in the same component.''' To continue the above passenger vehicle example, with either of the fault-tolerant systems it may not be obvious to the driver when a tire has been punctured. This is usually handled with a separate "automated fault-detection system". In the case of the tire, an air pressure monitor detects the loss of pressure and notifies the driver. The alternative is a "manual fault-detection system", such as manually inspecting all tires at each stop.
* '''Interference with fault detection in another component.''' Another variation of this problem is when fault tolerance in one component prevents fault detection in a different component. For example, if component B performs some operation based on the output from component A, then fault tolerance in B can hide a problem with A. If component B is later changed (to a less fault-tolerant design) the system may fail suddenly, making it appear that the new component B is the problem. Only after the system has been carefully scrutinized will it become clear that the root problem is actually with component A.
* '''Reduction of priority of fault correction.''' Even if the operator is aware of the fault, having a fault-tolerant system is likely to reduce the importance of repairing the fault. If the faults are not corrected, this will eventually lead to system failure, when the fault-tolerant component fails completely or when all redundant components have also failed.
* '''Test difficulty.''' For certain critical fault-tolerant systems, such as a [[nuclear reactor]], there is no easy way to verify that the backup components are functional. The most infamous example of this is [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl]], where operators tested the emergency backup cooling by disabling primary and secondary cooling. The backup failed, resulting in a core meltdown and massive release of radiation.
* '''Cost.''' Both fault-tolerant components and redundant components tend to increase cost. This can be a purely economic cost or can include other measures, such as weight. [[Human spaceflight|Manned spaceships]], for example, have so many redundant and fault-tolerant components that their weight is increased dramatically over unmanned systems, which don't require the same level of safety.
* '''Inferior components.''' A fault-tolerant design may allow for the use of inferior components, which would have otherwise made the system inoperable.  While this practice has the potential to mitigate the cost increase, use of multiple inferior components may lower the reliability of the system to a level equal to, or even worse than, a comparable non-fault-tolerant system.

==Examples==
Hardware fault tolerance sometimes requires that broken parts be taken out and replaced with new parts while the system is still operational (in computing known as ''[[hot swapping]]''). Such a system implemented with a single backup is known as '''single point tolerant''', and represents the vast majority of fault-tolerant systems. In such systems the [[mean time between failure]]s should be long enough for the operators to have time to fix the broken devices ([[mean time to repair]]) before the backup also fails. It helps if the time between failures is as long as possible, but this is not specifically required in a fault-tolerant system.

Fault tolerance is notably successful in computer applications. [[Tandem Computers]] built their entire business on such machines, which used single-point tolerance to create their [[NonStop]] systems with [[uptime]]s measured in years.

Fail-safe architectures may encompass also the computer software, for example by process [[replication (computer science)|replication]].

Data formats may also be designed to degrade gracefully. [[HTML]] for example, is designed to be [[forward compatibility|forward compatible]], allowing new HTML entities to be ignored by [[Web browser]]s that do not understand them without causing the document to be unusable.

==Related terms==
There is a difference between fault tolerance and systems that rarely have problems. For instance, the [[Western Electric]] [[Crossbar switch|crossbar]] systems had failure rates of two hours per forty years, and therefore were highly ''fault resistant''. But when a fault did occur they still stopped operating completely, and therefore were not ''fault tolerant''.

'''Federal furniture''' refers to [[United States|American]] [[furniture]] produced in the [[Federal Period]], which lasted from approximately 1789 to 1823.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/09/na/ht09na.htm "United States, 1600–1800 A.D.". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/ht/09/na/ht09na.htm (October 2004)] Retrieved 22 February 2009 &lt;/ref&gt; Notable furniture makers who worked in the [[federal style]] included [[Duncan Phyfe]] and [[Charles-Honoré Lannuier]]. It was influenced by the [[Georgian style|Georgian]] and [[Adam style|Adam]] styles, and was superseded by the [[American Empire (style)|American Empire style]].

Pieces in this style are characterized by their sharply geometric forms, legs that are usually straight rather than curved, contrasting [[Wood veneer|veneer]]s, and geometric [[inlay]] patterns on otherwise flat surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=uvQNEISK82AC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Federal+furniture&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA10,M1 ''American Federal Furniture and Decorative Arts from the Watson Collection'', by Philip D. Zimmerman et al.] On Google Books&lt;/ref&gt; Pictorial motifs, when extant, usually reference the new federal government with symbols such as the eagle.   

The [[Oval Office grandfather clock]], made by between 1795–1805 in Boston by John and Thomas Seymour, is a noted example of the federal style of furniture.

:''This article focuses on the Burbank, California company. For the general video technique used by Filmlook, Inc. see [[Film look]].''
'''Filmlook, Inc.''' is a [[post-production]] company based in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="MM1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hellooo, Dolly! |url=https://http |publisher=''[[MovieMaker]]'' |date=August 31, 1995 |author=Watson, Jack |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160114075411/http://http// |archivedate=January 14, 2016 |df=mdy }} &lt;/ref&gt;  Established in 1989, it specializes in a form of image processing used on television programs, commonly known as [[film look]].&lt;ref&gt;''Digital Cinema: The Hollywood Insider's Guide to the Evolution of Storytelling''&lt;/ref&gt;  The company has won an [[Emmy Award]] for its technical achievements.&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news |title=1992 Emmy Winners   |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/01/news/1992-emmy-winners.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm |publisher= ''[[New York Times]]'' |date= September 1, 1992| author =staff}} &lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1987, company founder Robert Faber began developing the company's process.&lt;ref name="filmlook.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmlook.com/|title=FILMLOOK Media and Post is a post-production facility located in Burbank, CA.|website=www.filmlook.com|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1989, the company was founded and introduced to the industry.&lt;ref name="filmlook.com"/&gt;

==Details==
The Filmlook process affects three main features to achieve the appearance of film: motion characteristics, gray scale/contrast, and grain pattern.

*Motion characteristics – With some video cameras, you see 60 [[interlaced]] pictures per second versus 24 in film. The Filmlook process attempts to replicate the feel of film. Newer digital cameras can shoot at a progressive 24 frames per second.
*Greyscale/contrast – Filmlook alters the gray scale, color, and contrast to approximate the typical film characteristic – the "film density curve".
*Simulation of grain pattern – A generated grain pattern that can be varied in intensity and attempts to imitate film grain by remaining static for the duration of each (imaginary) film frame (two or three fields).&lt;ref name="filmlook.com"/&gt;

==Background==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
Invented in 1989, the Filmlook image processing was first used in a test run in a 1991 episode of the ABC sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]'' titled "Not With My Carol You Don't". However, the first television series to regularly use Filmlook was ''[[Beakman's World]]'', a kid-oriented science series which ran from 1992–1996 on CBS. In 1995, Filmlook was used on the LL Cool J sitcom ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]''. However, when the series moved from NBC to UPN in 1996, the series began using unprocessed video.

In recent years, Filmlook has become known for its use on nearly all [[Disney Channel]] Original Series made from 2002 to 2008 (except ''[[Phil of the Future]]'' which was shot on film). ''[[That's So Raven]]'', which at one point was the channel's most-watched series, was the first Disney Channel show to use the processing. Since then, four other original series on the channel have had their taped product processed by the company: ''The Suite Life of Zack and Cody'', ''Hannah Montana'', ''That's So Raven'' spinoff ''Cory in the House'' , ''Wizards of Waverly Place''  and ''The Suite Life on Deck''. Filmlook processing has also been used on segments within the Nickelodeon series "The Amanda Show" for commercial parodies and the mock teen series "Moody's Point."

[[File:Fire Poofer.jpg|right|thumb|a flame projector]]
In [[pyrotechnics]], a '''flame projector''' is a [[special effects]] device that projects a column of flame upwards, for a short, determined and controllable, period, usually on the order of a few seconds.&lt;ref name=Kosanke /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=534|title=Lighting control-technology and applications|author=Robert S. Simpson|publisher=Focal Press|date=2003|isbn=0-240-51566-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The simplest form of flame projector is simply a vertical tube mounted on a base, containing powder and a hole for an [[electric match]].&lt;ref name=Kosanke&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Illustrated Dictionary of Pyrotechnics|author=Bonnie J. Kosanke|publisher=Journal of Pyrotechnics|date=1995|isbn=1-889526-01-0|article=Flame Projector|pages=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flame projectors can produce flames of different colours by simply adding a colouring agent. Potassium compounds make purple compounds, for instance. Lithium and strontium are red, sodium is bright yellow, copper and boron compounds are blue or green. &lt;ref name=Kosanke /&gt;

'''Frederic Vester''' (November 23, 1925 – November 2, 2003) was a [[Germany|German]] [[biochemistry|biochemist]], and an expert in the field of [[ecology]].

== Biography ==
Vester was born in [[Saarbrücken]], and studied [[chemistry]] at the universities of [[University of Mainz|Mainz]], [[University of Paris|Paris]] and [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]]. From 1955 to 1957 he was postdoctoral fellow at [[Yale University]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]. From 1957 to 1966 he worked at [[Saarland University]], [[Saarbrücken]], and from 1969 he worked in [[Munich]], first at the [[Max Planck Institute]]. In 1970 he founded the private Munich-based ''Frederic Vester Studiengruppe für Biologie und Umwelt GmbH'' ("Frederic Vester Study Group for Biology and Environment, Ltd.), renamed ''Frederic Vester GmbH'' ("Frederic Vester, Ltd.") after his death.

From 1982 to 1989 he was a [[professor]] at the [[Bundeswehr University Munich]], and from 1989 to 1991 he was Professor for [[Applied economics|Applied Economics]] at the [[University of St. Gallen|Hochschule St. Gallen]], [[Switzerland]]. Vester's ideas influenced the formation of the [[environmental movement]] and the [[Bündnis 90/Die Grünen|Green Party]] in Germany. He was a member of the [[Club of Rome]]. He was married to Anne Vester. The couple had three children and six grandchildren. He died in Munich.

== Work ==
=== Networked Thinking ===
Vester was known as pioneer of networked thinking, a combination of [[cybernetics|cybernetic]] and [[system]]ic ideas and [[complexity]]. Central ideas of network thinking include viewing a system as a network of interrelated effects, leading to [[emergence|emergent]] behavior of the system as a whole. These networks can be described by using protocols, mathematical networks, computer software, so that even someone with the most basic understanding of networks will see relations, including positive and negative [[feedback loop]]s. [[Simulation]]s of systemic networks can help to decide the [[long-term]] effects of [[singular measure]]s.

=== The Sensitivity Model ===
Vester's ''Sensitivity Model'' combines these ideas, and has been used since the 1980s in studies by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[UNESCO]] and other organizations.

== Publications ==
Most of Vesters books were published in German as well as in other languages, though seldom in English. A list of his works includes:
* 1976, ''Ballungsgebiete in der Krise'' (Urban Systems in Crisis)
* 1982, ''Das kybernetische Zeitalter'' (The Cybernetic Age)
* 1985, ''Ein Baum ist mehr als ein Baum'' (A Tree is More than a Tree)
* 1990, ''Leitmotiv vernetztes Denken'' (Key Themes of Networked Thinking)
* 1991, ''Ausfahrt Zukunft: Strategien für den Verkehr von morgen'' (Gateway Future: Strategies for the Transportation of Tomorrow)
* 1999, ''Crashtest Mobilität'' (Crash Test Mobility)
* 2002, ''Aufmerksamkeit im Unterricht'' (Attentiveness in the Classroom)
* 2002, ''Neuland des Denkens'' (Uncharted Territory of Thought)
* 2002, ''Denken, Lernen, Vergessen'' (Thinking, Learning, Forgetting)

* 2007, ''The Art of interconnected Thinking. Ideas and Tools for Tackling Complexity'' (MCB) {{ISBN|3-939314-05-6}}

Vester is also the author of the software tool ''Sensitivity model'' and of several cybernetic games:

* 1997 ''Ecopolicy – das kybernetische Strategiespiel'' (Ecopolicy - The Cybernetic Strategy Game)
* 1980/1996 ''Ökolopoly. Ein kybernetisches Umweltspiel'' (Ecopoly - A Cybernetic Environment Game)

'''[[Green building]]''' in '''[[France]]'''

In July 2007, the French government established six working groups to address ways to redefine France's environment policy. The proposed recommendations were then put to public consultation, leading to a set of recommendations released at the end of October 2007. These recommendations will be put to the French parliament in early 2008.

The name of the process, "Le Grenelle de l'Environnement", refers to a 1968 conference when government negotiated with unions to end weeks of social unrest.

The six working groups addressed climate change, biodiversity and natural resources, health and the environment, production and consumption, democracy and governance, and competitiveness and employment.

Recommendations include:

* invest Eur 1 billion in clean energy over the next four years as part of wide-reaching environmental plan to cut emissions of greenhouse gases, including proposals for ecological taxes;
20% reduction in France's energy consumption by 2020 and a boosting of the use of renewable energy, such as wind power and biofuels, by 20% by 2020;
* freight be transported on new high-speed rail lines and waterways rather than highways; and
* a series of green taxes including a tax on the most polluting vehicles, as well as a tax on transport trucks crossing France's borders.

Building labels

The French regulation (RT) for new construction was following an incremental logic with a regular (every five years) increase in the exigence level requested to achieve by 2020 (RT 2020) a 40% reduction of energy consumption with respect to the RT 2000. Current label are: THPE 2005=20% better than the RT2005. THPE EnR 2005= 30% better than RT2005+ Renewable energy production for the majority of heating.
 
Within the framework of the "Grenelle de l’envronnement", a performance acceleration is expected to meet with the following objectives for tertiary buildings:

I. Low consumption buildings (BBC) by 2010 with minimum requirements concerning the levels of renewable energy and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; absorption materials by 2012.

II. Passive new buildings (BEPAS) or Positive buildings (BEPOS) by 2020.

Labels for refurbishment of existing BBC buildings.

All these developments match with the European and international regulations and frameworks.

'''Hydrophosphination''' is the [[addition reaction|addition]] of a [[phosphorus]]-[[hydrogen]] bond across a [[double bond|carbon-carbon multiple bond]] (Scheme 1) forming a new phosphorus-carbon bond.&lt;ref&gt;Pullarkat, S. A.; Leung, P. Top. Organomet. Chem. 2013, 43, 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrophosphination has a high [[atom economy]].&lt;ref name=Beletskaya&gt;Beletskaya, I. P; Ananikov, V. P; Khemchyan, L. L. Catal. Met. Complexes 2013, 37, 213.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydrophosphination reaction.png|thumbnail|centre|Scheme 1. The reaction of hydrophosphination.]]

Like other metal-catalyzed heterofunctionalizations, addition of an E-H bond to an [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|unsaturated]] substrate, a problem is encountered when E is a donor ([[hydroamination]], hydration, hydrothiolation) because the product phosphines can poison the [[catalyst]]. Another consideration is that the P-H addition to a carbon-carbon multiple bond can occur in a variety of different ways.&lt;ref name=Beletskaya/&gt; The [[chemical selectivity|selectivity]] of the addition is influenced by the catalyst.

==Background==
A variety of routes exist for the synthesis of phosphines without a catalyst, e.g. using radical, thermal, photochemical.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, L. R. ACS Catal. 2013, 3, 2845.{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/cs400685c| title = Mechanisms of Metal-Catalyzed Hydrophosphination of Alkenes and Alkynes| journal = ACS Catalysis| volume = 3| issue = 12| pages = 2845| year = 2013| last1 = Rosenberg | first1 = L. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TundoHe2016"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pietro Tundo|author2=Liang-Nian He|author3=Ekaterina Lokteva|author4=Claudio Mota|title=Chemistry Beyond Chlorine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s7_bjwEACAAJ|date=4 October 2016|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-30071-9|pages=152–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radical-catalyzed hydrophosphination===

[[File:Radical hydrophosphination.png|thumbnail|right|Scheme 2. The reactions of radical hydrophosphination.]]
[[Ultraviolet irradiation]] or conventional free-radical sources initiate [[free radical reaction|radical]] hydrophosphinations. H-atom abstraction from P-H bond produces the phosphino radical, a seven electron species (Scheme 2).&lt;ref&gt;Quin, L. D. A Guide to Organophosphorus Chemistry; John Wiley &amp; Sons: New York, 2000; pp 28-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Phosphines with more than one P-H bond can react more than once to form the tertiary phosphines.

==Hydrophosphination catalysis==

The steps proposed for  metal-catalyzed hydrophosphinations typically include coordination of the primary or secondary phosphine to the metal, activation of the P-H bond (via oxidative addition or proton abstraction by an external base), P-C bond formation (through either insertion, Michael addition, or [2+2] cycloaddition), reductive elimination or addition of the abstracted proton and finally substitution of the newly made phosphine by the starting primary or secondary phosphine.&lt;ref&gt;Glueck, D. S. Top. Organomet. Chem. 2010, 31, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early transition metal and lanthanide catalysts===

[[File:Wiki5.png|thumbnail|right|Scheme 4. Proposed mechanism for Proposed mechanism for hydrophosphination of diphenylacetylene with phenylphosphine (PPhH2) catalyzed by a cationic titanium phosphinidene complex.]]
Most early metal hydrophosphination catalysts are electron-deficient, ''d''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; metal complexes.  Catalysis typically involves inner-sphere P-C bond forming through metal-phosphido intermediates due to the nucleophilicity of the phosphido, being polarized by the metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/B612306F| title = Stoichiometric and catalytic activation of P–H and P–P bonds| journal = Chemical Society Reviews| volume = 37| issue = 8| pages = 1482| year = 2008| last1 = Greenberg | first1 = S. | last2 = Stephan | first2 = D.

Hydrophosphination of simple alkenes and alkynes is catalyzed by lanthanocene complexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja010811i| title = Intramolecular Hydrophosphination/Cyclization of Phosphinoalkenes and Phosphinoalkynes Catalyzed by Organolanthanides:  Scope, Selectivity, and Mechanism| journal = Journal of the American Chemical Society| volume = 123| issue = 42| pages = 10221| year = 2001| last1 = Douglass | first1 = M.

L. | last3 = Marks | first3 = T. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The catalytic cycle for the hydrophosphination of ''α,ω''-pentenylphosphine is shown in Scheme 3. Typical of most electron-poor early metal catalysts for hydrophosphination, this one includes the characteristic P-H bond cleavage and P-C and C-H bond formation steps. The primary phosphine undergoes a  ''σ''-bond metathesis with the bis(trimethylsilyl)methylene ligand forming the lanthanide-phosphido. This is then followed by a 1,2-insertion of the pendant terminal alkene or alkyne on the phosphine into the Ln-P bond. Finally, protonolysis of the Ln-C bond with the starting primary phosphine releases the new phosphine and regenerates the catalyst. Given that the metal is electron-poor, the M-C bond is polar enough to be protonolyzed by the substrate primary phosphine; this is characteristic of electron-poor, early metals.

[[File:Ti cycle.png|thumbnail|right|Scheme 5. Proposed catalytic cycle for hydrophosphination of 1,3-dienes by diphenylphosphine, mediated by a cationic titanium phosphide complex.]]
Since many of the transition metal catalysts that are involved in hydrophosphination employ a phosphido intermediate, it is surprising that there are so few examples of catalysts that involve the metal-phosphinidene intermediate, M=PR. One such example is the Ti-catalyzed hydrophosphination of diphenylacetylene with phenylphosphine (Scheme 4) by Mindiola et al.&lt;ref&gt;Zhao, G. Y.; Basuli, F.; Kilgore, U. J.; Fan, H. J.; Aneetha, H.; Huffman, J. C.; Wu, G.; Mindiola, D. J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2006, 128, 13575.{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/ja064853o| title = Neutral and Zwitterionic Low-Coordinate Titanium Complexes Bearing the Terminal Phosphinidene Functionality.

J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system involves a cationic catalyst precursor that is stabilized by the bulky 2,4,6-tri(isopropyl)phenyl- substituent on the phosphinidene and the close ionic association of methyltris(pentafluorophenyl)borate. This precursor undergoes exchange with phenylphosphine to make the titanium-phenylphosphinidene complex which is the catalyst. The Ti=PPh undergoes a [2+2] cycloaddition with diphenylacetylene to make the corresponding metallacyclobutene. The substrate, phenylphosphine, protonolyzes the Ti-C bond and after a proton shift regenerates the catalyst and releases the new phosphine.

Titanium-catalyzed 1,4-hydrophosphination of 1,3-dienes with [[diphenylphosphine]] has been demonstrated (Scheme 5).&lt;ref&gt;Perrier, A.; Comte, V.; Moise, C.; Le Gendre, P. Chem. – Eur. J. 2010, 16, 64.{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1002/chem.200901863| title = First Titanium-Catalyzed 1,4-Hydrophosphination of 1,3-Dienes| journal = Chemistry – A European Journal| volume = 16| pages = 64| year = 2010| last1 = Perrier | first1 = A. | last2 = Comte | first2 = V. | last3 = Moïse | first3 = C. | last4 = Le Gendre | first4 = P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a rare example of a non-''d&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' early transition metal catalyst that catalyzes hydrophosphination. In the first step, the Ti&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; precursor undergoes an oxidative addition of the P-H bond in diphenylphosphine which generates the Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; catalyst. The rest of the catalysis involve the usual steps: P-C bond formation via 1,2-insertion followed by C-H bond formation and P-H bond activation via protonolysis with the substrate secondary phosphine.

===Late transition metal catalysts===
[[File:Wiki7.png|thumbnail|left|Scheme 6. Proposed mechanism for hydrophosphination of enones catalyzed by the cationic palladium(II) catalyst.]]
Late transition metal hydrophosphination catalysts generally require alkenes and alkynes with electron withdrawing substituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1039/C39900001701| title = Platinum(0)-catalysed hydrophosphination of acrylonitrile| journal = Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications| issue = 23| pages = 1701| year = 1990| last1 = Pringle | first1 = P.

Generally speaking, these metal complexes will first be bound by a primary or secondary phosphine, which then undergoes proton abstraction to make a nucleophilic phosphido ligand. The proton abstraction usually occurs by an external base.This base acts as a co-catalyst which is common to late transition metal hydrophosphination catalysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/om201115n| title = Chiral Phosphapalladacycles as Efficient Catalysts for the Asymmetric Hydrophosphination of Substituted Methylidenemalonate Esters: Direct Access to Functionalized Tertiary Chiral Phosphines| journal = Organometallics| volume = 31| issue = 8| pages = 3022| year = 2012| last1 = Xu | first1 = C. | last2 = Jun Hao Kennard | first2 = G. | last3 = Hennersdorf | first3 = F. | last4 = Li | first4 = Y. | last5 = Pullarkat | first5 = S.

The bound secondary phosphine becomes deprotonated by the base triethylamine, forming the phosphido. Following this the phosphido attacks the β-carbon of the enone, which is bound to the palladium through its oxygen atom. The abstracted proton from the secondary phosphine is delivered to the enone oxygen. Substitution by another secondary phosphine regenerates the catalyst and releases the 1,2-addition product. Other common characteristics of such late metal catalysts that do not require oxidative addition of the P-H bond are: the metal in a 2+ oxidation state, and cationic complexes. These two features are important given that a base is needed because being cationic and in an oxidation state of 2+ increases the acidity of the coordinated primary or secondary phosphine proton and allows for weaker bases/conjugate acids to be used in catalysis.

[[File:Pt cycle.png|thumbnail|left|Scheme 7. Proposed mechanism for hydrophosphination catalyzed by Pt(II) phosphido complex.]]
[[File:Nickel catalyst.png|thumbnail|right|Scheme 8. Proposed mechanism for hydrophosphination catalyzed by Ni(0) catalyst.]]

Some late metal hydrophosphination catalysts rely on oxidative addition of a P-H bond. For example, a Pt(0) catalyst that undergoes oxidative addition of a secondary phosphine to form the corresponding Pt(II) phosphido complex (Scheme 7). Following this, alkenes such as acrylonitrile inserts into the Pt-P bond and then reductively eliminate to afford the hydrophosphinated acrylonitrile. This P-C bond forming step was found to occur through an outer-sphere, Michael-type addition because telomerization was occurring. The carbanion intermediate would attack another molecule of acrylonitrile affording a product that would be expected from many 1,2-insertions of the alkene.&lt;ref&gt;Scriban, C.; Glueck, D.

The following reactivity varies from the other late metal catalysts in that P-C bond forming step involves a [2+2] cycloaddition with alkenes and alkynes forming metallacycles. The Ru-C bond of the metallacycle is then protonolyzed by the conjugate acid of the base co-catalyst. The newly formed phosphine is then substituted by the starting secondary phosphine to regenerate the catalyst and release the new phosphine. What makes this catalyst unique is that it forms metallacycles, or rather P-C bonds, with strongly and mildly activated, simple and electron-rich alkenes and alkynes, whereas the other catalysts discussed are rather limited; generally, early metals catalyzing unactivated substrates and late metals predominantly activated ones.

As stated, characteristic of the late metal catalysts for hydrophosphination that require a base co-catalyst is that they are in the 2+ oxidation state and cationic. Thus, efforts are also underway to use the similar halide-free, cationic ruthenium(II) complex for catalysis.

A '''launch loop''' or '''Lofstrom loop''' is a proposed system for [[orbital launch|launching objects into orbit]] using a moving cable-like system situated inside a sheath attached to the [[Earth]] at two ends and suspended above the [[atmosphere]] in the middle. The design concept was published by [[Keith Lofstrom]] and describes an [[active structure]] [[maglev]] [[cable transport]] system that would be around 2,000&amp;nbsp;km (1,240&amp;nbsp;mi) long and maintained at an altitude of up to 80&amp;nbsp;km (50&amp;nbsp;mi). A launch loop would be held up at this altitude by the [[Self-siphoning beads|momentum of a belt]] that circulates around the structure. This circulation, in effect, transfers the weight of the structure onto a pair of magnetic bearings, one at each end, which support it.

Launch loops are intended to achieve [[non-rocket spacelaunch]] of [[Spacecraft|vehicles]] weighing 5 metric tons by [[Maglev|electromagnetically accelerating]] them so that they are projected into Earth [[orbit]] or even beyond. This would be achieved by the flat part of the cable which forms an acceleration track above the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert L. Forward]], Indistinguishable from Magic, chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is designed to be suitable for launching humans for [[space tourism]], [[space exploration]] and [[space colonization]], and provides a relatively low [[g-force|3''g'' acceleration]].&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

== History ==

Launch loops were described by [[Keith Lofstrom]] in November 1981 Reader's Forum of the [[American Astronautical Society]] News Letter, and in the August 1982 [[L5 Society|L5]] News.

In 1982, [[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] published a series of papers in ''[[Journal of the British Interplanetary Society]]'' which described [[orbital ring]]s and described a form which he called Partial Orbital Ring System (PORS).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Birch (writer)|Paul Birch]] • [http://www.paulbirch.net/OrbitalRings-II.zip Orbital Rings - I 12] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707213633/http://www.paulbirch.net/OrbitalRings-II.zip |date=2007-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The launch loop idea was worked on in more detail around 1983–1985 by Lofstrom.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;December 1983 Analog magazine&lt;/ref&gt; It is a fleshed-out version of PORS specifically arranged to form a mag-lev acceleration track suitable for launching humans into space; but whereas the orbital ring used superconducting [[magnetic levitation]], launch loops use [[electromagnetic suspension]] (EMS).

==Description==
[[File:LaunchLoopRotor.svg|thumb|right|Launch loop accelerator section (return cable not shown)]]
A launch loop is proposed to be a structure 2,000&amp;nbsp;km long and 80&amp;nbsp;km high. The loop runs along at 80&amp;nbsp;km above the earth for 2000&amp;nbsp;km then descends to earth before looping back on itself rising back to 80&amp;nbsp;km above the earth to follow the reverse path then looping back to the starting point. The loop would be in the form of a tube, known as the ''sheath''. Floating within the sheath is another continuous tube, known as the ''rotor'' which is a sort of belt or chain. The rotor is an [[iron]] tube approximately 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;inches) in diameter, moving around the loop at 14&amp;nbsp;km/s (31,000 miles per hour).&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

=== Ability to stay aloft ===

When at rest, the loop is at ground level. The rotor is then accelerated up to speed. As the rotor speed increases, it curves to form an arc.  The structure is held up by the force from the rotor, which attempts to follow a parabolic trajectory.  The ground anchors force it to go parallel to the earth upon reaching the height of 80 kilometers.
Once raised, the structure requires continuous power to overcome the energy dissipated. Additional energy would be needed to power any vehicles that are launched.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

===Launching payloads===
To launch, vehicles are raised up on an 'elevator' cable that hangs down from the West station loading dock at 80&amp;nbsp;km, and placed on the track. The payload applies a magnetic field which generates [[eddy current]]s in the fast-moving rotor. This both lifts the payload away from the cable, as well as pulls the payload along with 3''g'' (30&amp;nbsp;m/s²) acceleration. The payload then rides the rotor until it reaches the required [[Orbital speed|orbital velocity]], and leaves the track.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

If a stable or circular orbit is needed, once the payload reaches the highest part of its trajectory then an on-board [[rocket engine]] ("kick motor") or other means is needed to circularize the trajectory to the appropriate Earth orbit.&lt;ref name=launch1985&gt;[http://launchloop.com/slides/launchloop.pdf PDF version of Lofstrom's 1985 launch loop publication (AIAA conference)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The eddy current technique is compact, lightweight and powerful, but inefficient. With each launch the rotor temperature increases by 80 [[kelvin]]s due to power dissipation. If launches are spaced too close together, the rotor temperature can approach 770&amp;nbsp;°C (1043 K), at which [[Curie point|point]] the iron rotor loses its [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] properties and rotor containment is lost.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

===Capacity and capabilities===
Closed orbits with a perigee of 80&amp;nbsp;km quite quickly decay and re-enter, but in addition to such orbits, a launch loop by itself would also be capable of directly injecting payloads into [[escape velocity|escape orbits]], [[gravity assist]] trajectories past the [[Moon]], and other non closed orbits such as close to the [[Trojan points#L4 and L5|Trojan points]].

To access circular orbits using a launch loop a relatively small 'kick motor' would need to be launched with the payload which would fire at [[apogee]] and would circularise the orbit. For [[geosynchronous orbit|GEO]] insertion this would need to provide a [[delta-v]] of about 1.6&amp;nbsp;km/s, for [[Low Earth orbit|LEO]] to circularise at 500&amp;nbsp;km would require a delta-v of just 120&amp;nbsp;m/s. Conventional [[rocket]]s require delta-vs of roughly 14 and 10&amp;nbsp;km/s to reach GEO and LEO respectively.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

Launch loops in Lofstrom's design are placed close to the equator&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt; and can only directly access equatorial orbits. However other orbital planes might be reached via high altitude plane changes, lunar perturbations or aerodynamic techniques.

Launch rate capacity of a launch loop is ultimately limited by the temperature and cooling rate of the rotor to 80 per hour, but that would require a 17 [[gigawatt|GW]] power station; a more modest 500 MW power station is sufficient for 35 launches per day.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

===Economics===
For a launch loop to be economically viable it would require customers with sufficiently large payload launch requirements.

Lofstrom estimates that an initial loop costing roughly $10 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] with a one-year payback could launch 40,000 metric tons per year, and cut launch costs to $300/kg. For $30 billion, with a larger power generation capacity, the loop would be capable of launching 6 million metric tons per year, and given a five-year payback period, the costs for accessing space with a launch loop could be as low as $3/kg.&lt;ref name=isdc&gt;[http://launchloop.com/LaunchLoop?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=isdc2002loop.pdf Launch Loop slides for the ISDC2002 conference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparisons==

===Advantages of launch loops===
Compared to space elevators, no new high-tensile strength materials have to be developed, since the structure resists Earth's gravity by supporting its own weight with the kinetic energy of the moving loop, and not by tensile strength.

Lofstrom's launch loops are expected to launch at high rates (many launches per hour, independent of weather), and are not inherently polluting. Rockets create pollution such as nitrates in their exhausts due to high exhaust temperature, and can create greenhouse gases depending on propellant choices. Launch loops as a form of electric propulsion can be clean, and can be run on geothermal, nuclear, wind, solar or any other power source, even intermittent ones, as the system has huge built-in power storage capacity.

Unlike space elevators which would have to travel through the [[Van Allen belts]] over several days, launch loop passengers can be launched to low earth orbit, which is below the belts, or through them in a few hours. This would be a similar situation to that faced by the Apollo astronauts, who had radiation doses 200 times lower than the space elevator would give.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn10520-space-elevators-first-floor-deadly-radiation.html New scientist: First floor deadly radiation]&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike space elevators which are subjected to the risks of space debris and meteorites along their whole length, launch loops are to be situated at an altitude where orbits are unstable due to air drag. Since debris does not persist, it only has one chance to impact the structure. Whereas the collapse period of space elevators is expected to be of the order of years, damage or collapse of loops in this way is expected to be rare. In addition, launch loops themselves are not a significant source of space debris, even in an accident. All debris generated has a perigee that intersects the atmosphere or is at escape velocity.

Launch loops are intended for human transportation, to give a safe 3''g'' acceleration which the vast majority of people would be capable of tolerating well,&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt; and would be a much faster way of reaching space than space elevators.

Launch loops would be quiet in operation, and would not cause any sound pollution, unlike rockets.

Finally, their low payload costs are compatible with large-scale commercial [[space tourism]] and even [[space colonisation]].

===Difficulties of launch loops===
A running loop would have an extremely large amount of energy in its linear momentum. While the magnetic suspension system would be highly redundant, with failures of small sections having essentially no effect, if a major failure did occur the energy in the loop (1.5×10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule]]s or 1.5 petajoules) would be approaching the same total ''energy'' release as a [[nuclear bomb]] explosion (350 kilotons of [[TNT equivalent]]), although not emitting nuclear radiation.

While this is a large amount of energy, it is unlikely that this would destroy very much of the structure due to its very large size, and because most of the energy would be deliberately dumped at preselected places when the failure is detected. Steps might need to be taken to lower the cable down from 80&amp;nbsp;km altitude with minimal damage, such as parachutes.

Therefore, for safety and [[astrodynamics|astrodynamic]] reasons, launch loops are intended to be installed over an ocean near the equator, well away from habitation.

The published design of a launch loop requires electronic control of the magnetic levitation to minimise power dissipation and to stabilise the otherwise under-damped cable.

The two main points of instability are the turnaround sections and the cable.

The turnaround sections are potentially unstable, since movement of the rotor away from the magnets gives reduced magnetic attraction, whereas movements closer gives increased attraction. In either case, instability occurs.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt; This problem is routinely solved with existing servo control systems that vary the strength of the magnets. Although servo reliability is a potential issue, at the high speed of the rotor, very many consecutive sections would need to fail for the rotor containment to be lost.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt;

The cable sections also share this potential issue, although the forces are much lower.&lt;ref name=launch1985/&gt; However, an additional instability is present in that the cable/sheath/rotor may undergo [[meander]]ing modes (similar to a [[Lariat chain]]) that grow in amplitude without limit. Lofstrom believes that this instability also can be controlled in real time by servo mechanisms, although this has never been attempted.

===Competing and similar designs===
In works by [[Alexander Bolonkin]] it is suggested that Lofstrom's project has many non-solved problems and that it is very far from a current technology.&lt;ref&gt;Bolonkin, A.A., Non-Rocket Space Launch and Flight, Elsevier, 2006, 488 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paper IAC-2-IAA-1.3.03 by A. Bolonkin at the World Space Congress – 2002, 10–12 October, Houston, TX, USA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society, Vol. 56, 2003, No.9/10 , pp.314-327&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Lofstrom project has expansion joints between 1.5 meter iron plates. Their speeds (under gravitation, friction) can be different and Bolonkin claims that they could wedge in the tube;{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} and the force and friction in the ground 28&amp;nbsp;km diameter turnaround sections are gigantic. In 2008,&lt;ref&gt;Bolonkin A.A., New Concepts, Ideas, and Innovations in Aerospace, Technology and Human Science, NOVA, 2008, 400 pgs.&lt;/ref&gt; Bolonkin proposed a simple rotated close-loop cable to launch the space apparatus in a way suitable for current technology.

Another project, the [[space cable]], is a smaller design by [[John Knapman]] that is intended for launch assist for conventional rockets and suborbital tourism. The space cable design uses discrete bolts rather than a continuous rotor, as with the launch loop architecture. John Knapman has also mathematically shown that the meander instability can be tamed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spacecable.org.uk/Stability%20IAC.pdf Space Cable]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Skyhook (structure)|skyhook]] is another launch system concept.  Skyhook could be either rotating or non-rotating. The non-rotating skyhook hangs from a [[low Earth orbit]] down to just above the Earth's atmosphere (skyhook cable is not attached to Earth).&lt;ref&gt;Smitherman, D. V., "Space Elevators, An Advanced Earth-Space Infrastructure for the New Millennium", NASA/CP-2000-210429 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070221162221/http://www.affordablespaceflight.com/spaceelevator.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  The rotating skyhook changes this design to decrease the speed of the lower end;  the entire cable rotates around its center of gravity. The advantage of this is an even greater velocity reduction for the launch vehicle flying to the bottom end of the rotating skyhook which makes for an even larger payload and a lower launch cost.  The two disadvantages of this are: the greatly reduced time available for the arriving launch vehicle to hook up at the lower end of the rotating skyhook (approximately 3 to 5 seconds), and the lack of choice regarding the destination orbit.

This is a '''list of Byzantine inventions'''. The Byzantine or [[Eastern Roman Empire]] represented the continuation of the [[Roman Empire]] after [[Fall of Rome|a part of it collapsed]]. Its main characteristics were [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] state traditions, [[Greek culture]] and [[Christian faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kinder|Hilgemann|1989|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
*'''Cross-in-square''': The [[cross-in-square]] was the dominant architectural form of middle Byzantine [[Church (building)|churches]]. Marking a decided departure from the oblong ground plan of the [[basilica]], it has been described as "a type of church that was, in its own way, perfect".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ousterhout|1996|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest extant example being the [[Theotokos]] church in [[Constantinople]] (907/908), its development can be traced back with a fair degree of certainty at least to the [[Nea Ekklesia]], consecrated in 880/881.&lt;ref name="Lange 1986, 93, 4"&gt;{{harvnb|Lange|1986|p=93, fn. 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Pendentive dome''': Generally speaking, a [[pendentive]] is a construction solution which allows a circular [[dome]] to be built atop a rectangular floor plan. While preliminary forms already evolved in [[List of Roman domes|Roman dome construction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rasch|1985|pp=129f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first fully developed pendentive dome dates to the reconstruction of the [[Hagia Sophia]] in 563.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heinle|Schlaich|1996|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Devised by Isodorus the Younger, the nephew of the first architect [[Isidore of Miletus]], the in-circle design, with a maximum diameter of 31.24 m, remained unsurpassed until the [[Renaissance]] (see [[Florence Cathedral]]).&lt;ref name="Heinle &amp; Schlaich 1996, 32"&gt;{{harvnb|Heinle|Schlaich|1996|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hagia Sophia became the paradigmatic [[Eastern Orthodox church architecture|Orthodox church form]] and its architectural style was emulated by [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] mosques a thousand years later.&lt;ref name="Heinle &amp; Schlaich 1996, 32"/&gt;
*'''Pointed arch bridge''': The earliest known bridge resting on a [[pointed arch]] is the 5th or 6th century AD [[Karamagara Bridge]] in [[Cappadocia]].&lt;ref&gt;Date: {{harvnb|Galliazzo|1995|p=92}}; {{harvnb|O’Connor|1993|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Hild|1977|p=145}}; {{harvnb|Hellenkemper|1977–1999|pp=730f.}}; {{harvnb|Guillou|1993|p=36}}; {{harvnb|Mango|1976|p=129}}; {{harvnb|Tunç|1978|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its single arch of 17 m spanned an affluent of the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galliazzo|1995|p=92}}; {{harvnb|O’Connor|1993|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Greek inscription, citing from the [[Bible]], runs along one side of its arch rib.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hild|1977|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; The structure is today submerged by the [[Keban Reservoir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Galliazzo|1995|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Warfare ==
*'''Counterweight trebuchet''': The earliest written record of the [[Trebuchet#Counterweight trebuchet|counterweight trebuchet]], a vastly more powerful design than the simple traction trebuchet,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|pp=73–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;  appears in the work of the 12th-century historian [[Niketas Choniates]]. Niketas describes a stone projector used by future emperor [[Andronikos I Komnenos]] at the siege of Zevgminon in 1165. This was equipped with a [[windlass]], an apparatus required neither for the traction nor hybrid trebuchet to launch missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chevedden hypothesizes that the new artillery type was introduced at the [[Siege of Nicaea|1097 Siege of Nicaea]] when emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]], an ally of the besieging [[Crusades|crusaders]], was reported to have invented new pieces of heavy artillery which deviated from the conventional design and made a deep impression on everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|pp=76–86; 110f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hand-trebuchet''': The [[Trebuchet#Hand-trebuchet|hand-trebuchet]] (''cheiromangana'') was a [[fustibalus|staff sling]] mounted on a pole using a [[lever]] mechanism to propel projectiles. Basically a portable trebuchet which could be operated by a single man, it was advocated by emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] around 965 to disrupt enemy formations in the open field. It was also mentioned in the [[Nikephoros Ouranos#Ouranos' Taktika|Taktika]] of general [[Nikephoros Ouranos]] (ca. 1000), and listed in the ''Anonymus De obsidione toleranda'' as a form of artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chevedden|2000|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Greek fire''': The invention and military employment of [[Greek fire]] played a crucial role in the defense of the empire against the [[Byzantine–Arab Wars|early onslaught of the Muslim Arabs]]. Brought to Constantinople by a refugee from Syria by the name of Kallinikos,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=607}}&lt;/ref&gt; the incendiary weapon came just in time to save the capital from the Muslim sieges of [[Siege of Constantinople (674–678)|674–678]] and [[Siege of Constantinople (717–718)|717–718]], which might have otherwise proven fatal to the Byzantine state.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Greek fire, referred to by Byzantine chroniclers as "sea fire" or "liquid fire",&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=608f.}}; {{harvnb|Ellis Davidson|1973|pp=61f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was primarily a naval weapon, used in ship-to-ship battle against enemy [[galley]]s. The exact composition was a well-guarded state secret, to the point that modern scholars continue to debate its ingredients, but the main method of projection is fairly clear, indicating effectively a flame-thrower: The liquid mixture, heated in a [[brazier]] and pressurized by means of a pump, was ejected by an operator through a [[siphon]] in any direction against the enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Haldon|Byrne|1977|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, it could be poured down from swivel [[crane (machine)|cranes]] or hurled in pottery grenades.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=378f., 609}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Greek fire held a fearsome reputation among Byzantium's numerous enemies who began to field – probably differently composed – combustibles of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|pp=609–617}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was, however, no wonder weapon, but dependent on favourable conditions such as a calm sea and wind coming from behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pryor|Jeffreys|2006|p=384}}&lt;/ref&gt; When and how the use of Greek fire was discontinued is not exactly known. According to one theory, the Byzantines lost the secret due to over-compartmentalization long before the [[Siege of Constantinople (1204)|1204 sack of Constantinople]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roland|1992|pp=655–679}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Incendiary grenade''': [[Grenade]]s appeared not long after the reign of [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]] (717–741), when Byzantine soldiers learned that Greek fire could not only be projected by flamethrowers, but also be thrown in stone and ceramic jars.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Forbes|1964|p=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger containers were hurled by [[catapult]]s or trebuchets at the enemy, either ignited before release or set alight by fire arrows after impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pászthory|1986|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grenades were later adopted for use by [[Muslim]] armies: Vessels of the characteristic spheroconical shape which many authors identify as grenade shells were found over much of the Islamic world,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pentz|1988|pp=89f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible workshop for grenade production from the 13th century was excavated at the Syrian city of [[Hama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pentz|1988|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Flamethrower''': for ship-borne [[flamethrower]]s, see Greek fire above. Portable hand-siphons were used in land warfare.

== Daily Life ==
*'''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]''': Under the reign of [[Justinian the Great]] he initiated reforms that had a clear effect on the evolution of jurisprudence as his Corpus Juris Civilis became the foundation of the jurisprudence in the Western world.
*'''Icon''': [[Icon]]s are images of holy beings such as [[Jesus]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] and the [[saint]]s which, painted according to certain traditional rules, have been playing a pivotal role in [[Orthodox Church]] veneration since its early days. The most distinctive Byzantine form are representations on portable wooden panels painted in the [[Hellenistic]] techniques of [[tempera]] or [[Encaustic painting|encaustic]]. Other varieties include (precious) metal [[relief]]s or [[mosaic]]-style panels set with [[tesserae]] of precious stones, gold, silver and [[ivory]]. The use of icons was violently opposed during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm|iconoclastic controversy]] which dominated much of Byzantium's internal politics in the 8th and 9th centuries, but was finally resumed by the victorious [[iconodule]]s. Only few early icons have survived the iconoclasm, the most prominent examples being the 6th–7th century collection from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kazhdan|1991|pp=977–981}}; {{harvnb|Pentcheva|2010|pp=265–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ship mill''': The historian [[Procopius]] records that [[ship mill]]s were introduced by [[Belisarius]] during the [[Siege of Rome (537–538)|siege of Rome]] (537/538), initially as a makeshift solution. After the [[Ostrogoths]] had interrupted the water-supply of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueducts]] on which the city was dependant to run its [[Roman watermill|gristmill]]s, Belisarius ordered riverboats to be fitted with mill gearing; these were moored between bridge piers where the strong current powered the [[water wheel]]s mounted on the vessel. The innovative use quickly found acceptance among [[medieval]] watermillers, reaching [[Paris]] and the [[Francia|Frankish Realm]] only two decades later.&lt;ref name="Wikander 2000, 383f."&gt;{{harvnb|Wikander|2000|pp=383f.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The [[theory of impetus]]''': The theory was introduced by John Philoponus, and it is the precursor to the concepts of inertia, momentum and acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/philoponus/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Hospital''': The concept of hospital as institution to offer medical care and possibility of a cure for the patients due to the ideals of Christian charity, rather than just merely a place to die, appeared in Byzantine Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 349.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Separation of [[conjoined twins]]''': The first known example of separating conjoined twins happened in the Byzantine Empire in the 10th century. A pair of conjoined twins lived in Constantinople for many years when one of them died, so the surgeons in Constantinople decided to remove the body of the dead one. The result was partly successful as the surviving twin lived in three days before dying. But the fact that the second person survived for few days after separating it, was so impressive that it was mentioned a century and half years later again by historians. The next case of separating conjoined twins will be recorded first about 700 years later in the year 1689 in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medievalists.net/2014/01/the-case-of-conjoined-twins-in-10th-century-byzantium/|title=The Case of Conjoined Twins in 10th Century Byzantium - Medievalists.net|date=4 January 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://denysmontandon.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/conjoined-twins.pdf |title=THE UNSPEAKABLE HISTORY OF THORACOPAGUS TWINS’ SEPARATION  |last=Montandon |first=Denys  |date=December 2015 |website=denysmontandon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechatronics''', which is also called '''mechatronic engineering''', is a [[multidisciplinary]] branch of engineering that focuses on the engineering of both [[Electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[mechanical engineering|mechanical systems]], and also includes a combination of [[robotics]], [[electronics]], [[computer engineering|computer]], [[telecommunications]], [[systems engineering|systems]], [[control engineering|control]], and [[Product engineering|product]] engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mme.uwaterloo.ca/undergrad/mechatronics/prospective/prospective.html|title=What is Mechatronics Engineering?|author=Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering Department|work=Prospective Student Information|publisher=University of Waterloo|accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CZU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mechatronics.tul.cz|title=Mechatronics (Bc., Ing., PhD.)|author=Faculty of Mechatronics, Informatics and Interdisciplinary Studies TUL|accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[technology]] advances over time, various subfields of engineering have succeeded in both adapting and multiplying. The intention of mechatronics is to produce a design solution that unifies each of these various subfields. Originally, the field of mechatronics was intended to be nothing more than a combination of mechanics and electronics, hence the name being a combination of both '''mecha'''nics and elec'''tronics'''; however, as the complexity of technical systems continued to evolve, the definition had been broadened to include more technical areas. 

The word ''mechatronics'' originated in [[Wasei-eigo|Japanese-English]] and was created by Tetsuro Mori, an engineer of [[Yaskawa Electric Corporation]]. The word ''mechatronics'' was registered as [[trademark]] by the company in Japan with the registration number of "46-32714" in 1971. However, afterward the company released the right of using the word to public, the word begun being used across the world. Nowadays, the word is translated in each language and the word is considered as an essential term for industry.

French standard NF E 01-010 gives the following definition: "approach aiming at the synergistic integration of mechanics, electronics, control theory, and computer science within product design and manufacturing, in order to improve and/or optimize its functionality".

Many people treat ''mechatronics'' as a modern buzzword synonymous with [[robotics]] and [[electromechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:mecha workaround.svg|right|350X350 px|thumb|Aerial [[Euler diagram]] from [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute|RPI]]'s website describes the fields that make up mechatronics]]
A mechatronics engineer unites the principles of mechanics, electronics, and computing to generate a simpler, more economical and reliable system.
The term "mechatronics" was coined by Tetsuro Mori, the senior engineer of the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese]] company [[Yaskawa]] in 1969. An [[industrial robot]] is a prime example of a mechatronics system; it includes aspects of electronics, mechanics, and computing to do its day-to-day jobs.

[[Engineering cybernetics]] deals with the question of control [[engineering]] of mechatronic systems. It is used to control or regulate such a system (see [[control theory]]). Through collaboration, the mechatronic modules perform the production goals and inherit flexible and agile manufacturing properties in the production scheme. Modern production equipment consists of mechatronic modules that are integrated according to a control architecture. The most known architectures involve [[hierarchy]], [[polyarchy]], [[heterarchy]], and hybrid. The methods for achieving a technical effect are described by control [[algorithm]]s, which might or might not utilize [[formal method]]s in their design. Hybrid systems important to mechatronics include [[Operations management#Production systems|production systems]], synergy drives,
[[Mars Exploration Rover|planetary exploration rovers]], automotive subsystems such as [[anti-lock braking system]]s and spin-assist, and everyday equipment such as autofocus cameras, video, [[hard disk]]s, and CD players.

==Course structure==

==Physical implementations==
Mechanical modeling calls for modeling and simulating physical complex phenomena in the scope of a multi-scale and multi-physical approach. This implies to implement and to manage modeling and optimization methods and tools, which are integrated in a systemic approach.
The specialty is aimed for students in mechanics who want to open their mind to systems engineering, and able to integrate different physics or technologies, as well as students in mechatronics who want to increase their knowledge in optimization and multidisciplinary simulation techniques.
The speciality educates students in robust and/or optimized conception methods for structures or many technological systems, and to the main modeling and simulation tools used in R&amp;D. Special courses are also proposed for original applications (multi-materials composites, innovating transducers and [[actuator]]s, integrated systems, …) to prepare the students to the coming breakthrough in the domains covering the materials and the systems.
For some mechatronic systems, the main issue is no longer how to implement a control system, but how to implement actuators. Within the mechatronic field, mainly two technologies are used to produce movement/motion.

==Variant of the field==
An emerging variant of this field is [[biomechatronics]], whose purpose is to integrate mechanical parts with a human being, usually in the form of removable gadgets such as an [[exoskeleton]]. This is the "real-life" version of [[cyberware]].

Another variant that we can consider is Motion control for Advanced Mechatronics, which presently is recognized as a key technology in mechatronics. The robustness of motion control will be represented as a function of stiffness and a basis for practical realization. Target of motion is parameterized by control stiffness which could be variable according to the task reference. However, the system robustness of motion always requires very high stiffness in the controller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=491410 ″Motion Control and Advanced Mechatronics″].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avionics]] is also considered a variant of mechatronics as it combines several fields such as [[Electronic engineering|electronics]] and telecom with [[Aerospace|Aerospace Engineering]].

==Internet of things==
The [[Internet of things]] (IoT) is the [[Internetworking|inter-networking]] of physical devices, [[Embedded system|embedded]] with [[electronics]], [[software]], [[sensor]]s, [[actuator]]s, and [[Internet access|network connectivity]] which enable these objects to collect and exchange [[data]].

IoT and mechatronics are complementary. Many of the smart components associated with the Internet of Things will be essentially mechatronic. The development of the IoT is forcing mechatronics engineers, designers, practitioners and educators to research the ways in which mechatronic systems and components are perceived, designed and manufactured. This allows them to face up to new issues such as data security, machine ethics and the human-machine interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradley|first1=David|last2=Russell|first2=David|last3=Ferguson|first3=Ian|title=The Internet of Things-The future or the end of mechatronics|journal=Mechatronics|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mobility scooter zoo.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Two people using mobility scooters]] A '''mobility scooter''' is a [[mobility aid]] equivalent to a [[wheelchair]] but configured like a [[motorscooter]]. It is often referred to as a power-operated vehicle/scooter or electric scooter as well.

==Description==
A mobility scooter has a seat over three, four or now five [[wheel|wheels]], a flat area or foot plates for the [[foot|feet]], and handlebars or a delta-style steering arrangement in front to turn one, two or three steerable wheels. The seat may swivel to allow access when the front is blocked by the handlebars. Mobility scooters are usually [[battery (electricity)|battery]] powered. A battery or two is stored on board the scooter and is charged via an onboard or separate [[battery charger]] unit from standard [[electric power]]. [[Gasoline]]-powered scooters may also be available in some countries, though they are rapidly being replaced by electric models. User-powered propelled by a lever used in a push-pull rowing motion to provide [[exercise]] and mobility at the same time.

The tiller, with forward/reverse directions and [[speed]] controls, is the steering column centrally located at the front of the scooter. The tiller may contain other features as well, for example, a speed limiter, lighting controls (for nighttime use) and [[turn signals]].  A battery use indicator is also often included. Forward/reverse direction can be controlled by thumb paddles, finger controls, or a switch. There are two types of mobility scooters: front-wheel drive (FD) or rear-wheel drive (RD). The front-wheel drive is usually a smaller device and is best used indoors. Rider weight capacity is a minimum of {{convert|170|lb|kg}} generally upwards to {{convert|980|lb|kg}} maximum. The rear-wheel drive is used both indoors and outdoors with rider weight capacity of {{convert|350|lb|kg}}. A heavy duty rear-drive can carry up to {{convert|500|lb|kg}}, varying by manufacturer.

The first crude mobility scooter was introduced in 1954 and was billed by [[Sears]] as an electric wheelchair, but it had more in common with mobility scooter with its large seat, extra large battery capacity and three-wheel design. It was not a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=sdwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=1954+Popular+Mechanics+January&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Pv4YT5SlG5PoggekxISEDA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Electric Wheel Chair."] ''Popular Mechanics'', November 1954, P. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobility scooters come in various types:

* User powered, small, light manual scooters for travel, without battery or motor, user powered propelled by a CLD (Central Lever Drive) in a push-pull rowing motion to provide mobility and exercise at the same time.
* small, light scooters for travel, which fold or are easily disassembled into smaller parts for transport;
* large, heavy scooters for rough outdoor terrain;
* mid-range scooters, which are intended for both indoor and outdoor use.
* slow and steady, used for shopping in stores and other places.
Usually mid-range mobility scooters have a speed of about {{convert|5|to|7|mph|km/h|abbr=on|0}}.

==Advantages==

Assistive and small sit-down  electric mobility scooters provide important advantages to people with mobility problems throughout the world. A scooter is useful for persons without the [[endurance|stamina]] or [[arm]]/[[shoulder]] flexibility necessary to use a manual wheelchair. Also, swiveling the seat of an electric scooter is generally easier than moving the foot supports on most conventional wheelchairs. A mobility scooter is very helpful for persons with systemic or whole-body disabling conditions (coronary or [[lung]] issues, some forms of arthritis, [[obesity]], etc.) who are still able to stand and walk a few steps, sit upright without [[torso]] support, and control the steering tiller.

A major selling point of mobility scooters for many users is that they do not look like a wheelchair, [[disability]] still being seen by many as shameful. Mobility scooters are in general more affordable than powered wheelchairs, leading to them being procured as a cheaper alternative.

Recently, manufacturers have been modifying the appearance of scooters to appeal to users.  There are now mobility scooters which look like short, thin, small cars, and others that look very much like [[motorcycle|motorcycles]].

==Limitations==
While a mobility scooter eliminates much of the manual [[physical strength|strength]] problems of an unpowered wheelchair, its tiller steering mechanism still requires upright [[Human position|posture]], [[shoulder]] and [[hand]] strength, and some upper-body mobility and strength. The arm-rest mounted controller typical of powerchair designs may be more suitable for many users.  Scooters also have fewer options for body support, such as [[head]] or [[Human_leg|leg]] rests. They are rarely designed for ease of [[patient]] transfer from seat to bed.

Other drawbacks include longer length, which limits their [[turning radius]] and ability to use some lifts or wheelchair-designed access technologies such as [[kneeling bus]] lifts.  The longer length may also make it difficult to reach door-opener buttons or [[Door_handle|doorknobs]].  Some mobility scooter have low [[ground clearance]] which can make it difficult to navigate certain obstacles, such as travelling in cities without proper [[curb cut]]s. Navigating in restricted spaces, whether in the home or in public spaces and buildings can also be a problem.

While new public buildings are usually designed with accessibility features, at least in North America, the longer length and wider turning radius may make it difficult to use them.  This is a greater problem in older buildings which may have had to make compromises in retrofitting accessibility aids.  For example, an [[elevator]] or lift may be adequate for a wheelchair, but too short for a mobility scooter.  Hallways may be too narrow to make a right-angle turn.  Or the "privacy" wall in most washrooms may restrict the entry so that the scooter cannot maneuver around it.

The weight minimum and limitations may be cause for concern as well with the minimum weight requirement being 170 lbs and the maximum being between 250-400 pounds depending on the make.

These limitations may prevent some [[disability|disabled]] individuals from using scooters. In addition, scooter limitations may vary depending on model and manufacturer. A limitation of one make/model does not necessarily carry over to all. Individual needs may affect the suitability of a particular model.  Four-wheel scooters have a larger turning radius in general, than a three-wheel scooter.  In particular, a purchaser should compare length, width, turning radius and ground clearance to ensure the scooter will fit with most commonly encountered obstacles in the user's environment.

Currently in the [[United States]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] will not approve a power wheelchair for persons who do not need to use the chair "inside their own home", even if their medical needs restrict the use of a mobility scooter. For example, a person with severe [[arthritis]] of both shoulders and [[hand]]s may not be the best candidate for a scooter, but because they can walk a few steps in their own home, such persons are not seen as approved candidates for a power wheelchair either. Various [[disability rights]] groups are campaigning for Medicare to change this policy. For those who do qualify for Medicare, they can reimburse up to 80% of the Medicare allowable value of the scooter.

Such restrictions are also applied in at least some Canadian provinces.  For example, to be eligible for partial funding by the Ontario Assistive Devices Program, the user must require the scooter for use in their own home.

Similar restrictions on [[National Health Service|NHS]] powerchair provision exist in the UK, with manual wheelchairs prescribed for users with any ability to walk. This has led to many users who might be better served by a powerchair privately procuring a mobility scooter as a cheaper substitute.

==Legal issues==
In the UK mobility scooters are widely available with government subsidy under the [[Motability]] scheme. They are legally classified by the Use of Invalid Carriages on Highways Regulations 1988 as either Class II or Class III Invalid Carriages for legal purposes. A Class II scooter must be limited to {{convert|4|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for use on a footway only, while a Class III scooter must be limited to {{convert|8|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} for road/highway use and have an additional 4&amp;nbsp;mph limiter for footway use. {{As of|March 2010}} a government consultation is under way to determine how the law should adapt to increasing scooter use, whether higher road speeds should be allowed and on a replacement for the archaic term "invalid carriage". Due to concerns over safety issues and problems with bringing prosecutions against irresponsible users under existing laws, the consultation will also consider whether to make third party insurance mandatory, consider the introduction of compulsory training for users and discuss how to bring scooter users under wider road traffic legislations.

A  class 2 invalid carriage does not require registration. Class 3 invalid carriages may not be driven by a person under 14 years; they need to be registered with the [[DVLA]] and are subject to [[vehicle excise duty]] ("car tax"), though the rate is zero.

Disability Essex told the Committee about four deaths resulting from mobility scooter accidents in one year in Essex alone, but there is little evidence to suggest that fatalities on this scale are replicated nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmtran/414/414.pdf publications.parliament.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada, mobility scooter users are classified as [[pedestrian|pedestrians]] and thus may legally use sidewalks for travel.  This classification is based on wheel diameter.  However, a mobility scooter weighs approximately {{convert|150|to|180|lb|kg|-1}} without the driver and can cause serious [[injury]] or [[death]].  Users must use care while driving around pedestrians on sidewalks.  There is some growing concern, and even hostility, about the use of mobility scooters in crowded [[urban area|urban areas]].

An Australian senate enquirey into mobility scooters was announced in 2017, after [[John Williams (Australian senator)|John Williams]]' wife Nancy was injured by one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-12-07/senate-committee-to-investigate-mobility-scooter-safety/9233780 |title=Senate committee to investigate mobility scooter safety concerns |author=Anna Henderson |date=7 December 2017 |publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NASA Historical Office was established under its first chief historian, Dr. [[Eugene Emme]] in 1960. The committee was first made up of a wide variety of members, who initially sought to find support and prestige for the new historical program. From 1969-70, the committee began to be increasingly composed of professional historians from universities, who made known their dissatisfaction with the NASA historical program. As a result, the Historical Advisory Committee was reduced in size and reorganized to be composed of only university-based professional historians to oversee the work of the NASA Historical Office.

== Purpose ==

On Line Opinion was founded as an experiment in [[participatory democracy]], through the means of [[participatory journalism]].&lt;ref name="Flew&amp;Young"/&gt; The contributors to On Line Opinion constitute a wide range of writers, such as what might be described as high-profile contributors, including politicians and academics, and what might be called ordinary citizens, that is, those with no particular public profile.&lt;ref&gt;See list of authors at: http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/author.asp&lt;/ref&gt; One of the motivations behind On Line Opinion was to address the limitations of [[academic publishing]], and thus On Line Opinion aims to publish accessible material, sometimes called [[grey literature]], on a more timely basis and with a wider audience, than would otherwise be the case. Research has suggested that, in comparative terms, publication within On Line Opinion is indeed more timely than is the case with other citizen journals, with on average five new articles per day appearing on the website.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, A. and J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1118">In [[telecommunication]]s, a '''primary time standard''' is a [[time standard]] that does not require [[calibration]] against another time standard.  

Examples of primary time, (''i.e.'', frequency standards) are [[caesium standard]]s and [[hydrogen]] [[maser]]s. 

The international [[second]] is based on the [[microwave]] [[frequency]] (9,192,631,770 Hz) associated with the atomic resonance of the [[hyperfine level|hyperfine]] [[ground state]] levels of the [[caesium|caesium-133]] atom in a magnetically neutral environment. Realizable caesium frequency standards use a strong electromagnet to deliberately introduce a [[magnetic field]] which overwhelms that of the Earth. The presence of this strong magnetic field introduces a slight, but known, increase in the atomic [[resonance]] frequency. However, very small variations in the calibration of the electric current in the electromagnet introduce minuscule [[frequency]] variations among different caesium oscillators.

[[File:ProjPointTerm.jpg|thumb|400px|Standard projectile point terminology used in describing Native American projectile points: a - point or tip, b-edge, c- blade or face, d - step, e - tang, f - base, g - notch, h - barb, i - shoulder.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Ritchie, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In [[archaeology|archaeological terms]], a '''projectile point''' is an object that was [[hafting|hafted]] to weapon that was capable of being thrown or projected, such as a spear, dart, or [[Arrowhead|arrow]], or perhaps used as a [[knife]].  They are thus different from weapons presumed to have been kept in the hand, such as [[axe]]s and [[Mace (bludgeon)|mace]]s, and the stone mace or axe-heads often attached to them. 

Stone tools, including projectile points, can survive for long periods, were often lost or discarded, and are relatively plentiful, especially at [[archaeological site]]s, providing useful clues to the human past, including prehistoric [[trade]]. A distinctive form of point, identified though [[lithic analysis]] of the [[lithic reduction|way it was made]], is often a key diagnostic factor in identifying an [[archaeological industry]] or culture.  Scientific techniques exist to track the specific kinds of rock or minerals that used to make stone tools in various regions back to their original sources. 

As well as stone, projectile points were also made of worked [[bone]], [[antler]] or [[ivory]]; all of these are less common in the Americas. In regions where [[metallurgy]] emerged, projectile points were eventually made from [[copper]], [[bronze]], or [[iron]], though the change was by no means immediate. In North America, some late prehistoric points were fashioned from copper that was [[mining|mined]] in the [[Lake Superior]] region and elsewhere.

== History in North America ==
A large variety of prehistoric arrowheads, dart points, and spear points have been discovered.  [[Flint]], [[obsidian]], [[quartz]] and many other rocks and minerals were commonly used to make points in North America.  The oldest projectile points found in North America were long thought to date from about 13,000 years ago, during the [[Paleo-Indian|Paleo-Indian period]], however recent evidence suggests that North American projectile points may date to as old as 15,500 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/science/25archeo.html?hpw | work=The New York Times | title=Clovis People Weren't First in Americas, Texas Spear Points Suggest | date=24 March 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319035529/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/25/science/25archeo.html?hpw | archivedate=19 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the more famous Paleo-Indian types include [[Clovis point|Clovis]], [[Folsom point|Folsom]] and Dalton points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaaca.com/index.htm Authentic Artefacts Collectors Association] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120201207/http://www.theaaca.com/index.htm |date=2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Types ===
Projectile points fall into two general types: dart/spear points, and [[Arrowhead|arrow points]]. Larger points were used to tip spears and [[atlatl]] darts.  Arrow points are smaller and lighter than dart points, and were used to tip arrows.  The question of how to distinguish an arrow point from a point used on a larger projectile is non-trivial. According to some investigators, the best indication is the width of the [[hafting]] area, which is thought to correlate to the width of the shaft.&lt;ref&gt;Wyckoff 1964&lt;/ref&gt; An alternative approach is to distinguish arrow points by their necessarily smaller size (weight, length, thickness).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

Projectile points come in an amazing variety of shapes and styles, which vary according to chronological periods, cultural identities, and intended functions.

Typological studies of projectile points have become more elaborate through the years. For instance, [[Gregory Perino]] began his categorical study of projectile point typology in the late 1950s. Collaborating with Robert Bell, he published a set of four volumes defining the known point types of that time. Perino followed this several years later with a three-volume study of "Selected Preforms, Points and Knives of the North American Indians".&lt;ref&gt;Fraser 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Another recent set of typological studies of North American projectile points has been produced by Noel Justice.&lt;ref&gt;Justice 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice 2002a&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justice 2002b&lt;/ref&gt;

With the success of the initial crowdfunding campaign, a second campaign&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-13|title=Librem 13: A Laptop That Respects Your Rights|website=Crowd Supply|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; was made for a 13-inch model of the [[Librem]], where an additional focus on privacy was given with hardware [[Kill switch|kill switches]] built into the product design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/purism-puts-physical-kill-switches-latest-laptop|title=Purism Puts Physical Kill Switches on Latest Laptop|last=Casey|first=Henry T.|date=2015-06-19|work=|access-date=2017-01-16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 15-inch model was still undergoing design and production, the kill switches feature was backported to it.

The two campaigns raised {{US$|1,052,174|link=yes}} through the support of 1042 initial backers, which allowed the production and delivery of [[Librem]] laptops starting at the end of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-13/updates|title=Updates from Librem 13: A Laptop That Respects Your Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Crowd Supply|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.crowdsupply.com/purism/librem-15/updates|title=Updates from Librem 15: A Laptop That Respects Your Rights|last=|first=|date=|website=Crowd Supply|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As campaign orders have gradually been fulfilled, Purism announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Todd |last=Weaver |title=Growing to Ship from Inventory in 2017 |url=https://puri.sm/posts/growing-to-ship-from-inventory-in-2017/ |work=Purism |date=2016-12-15 |accessdate=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it would be transitioning from a purely [[build to order]] order fulfillment model to a [[build to stock]] model in 2017.

In February 2017, Purism transitioned to become a [[social purpose corporation]], with its articles of incorporation detailing its social purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/about/social-purpose/|title=Social purpose|last=|first=|date=|website=Purism|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was announced in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/3335036|title=Purism Becomes a Social Purpose Corporation|last=|first=|date=2017-05-08|website=Digital Journal|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/purism-now-a-social-purpose-corporation/|title=Purism now a SPC — What this means for you and us|last=|first=|date=2017-05-06|website=Purism|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24th 2017, Purism announced plans to build a smartphone, called the [[Librem#Librem 5 smartphone|Librem 5]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt; {{Cite web|title=Purism will try its hand at security-focused smartphones|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/24/purism-security-focused-smartphone-librem-5/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phone, with launch delayed to early April 2019, will feature [[baseband processor]] separate from the main CPU and hardware kill switches for the baseband, [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], camera, and microphone. Further, this phone would run entirely free and open source software. Purism announced a crowdfunding effort for the phone that would run 60 days, intended to collect {{US$|1.5&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}. Purism has reached its goal two weeks before the end of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/10/success-linux-phone-crowdfunding-campaign-reaches-goal|title=Success — Linux Phone Crowdfunding Campaign Reaches Its Goal - OMG!

On August 24th 2017, Purism launched a funding campaign for a $599 "security and privacy focused phone" [[Librem#Librem 5 smartphone|Librem 5]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The 60-day funding campaign aimed to collect collect {{US$|1.5&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}, however the goal was surpassed two weeks early and concluded with [[United States dollar|US$]]2,677,609.10 raised, 78% over the target.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt; {{Cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2017/10/success-linux-phone-crowdfunding-campaign-reaches-goal|title=Success — Linux Phone Crowdfunding Campaign Reaches Its Goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/|title=Librem 5 – A Security and Privacy Focused Phone – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phone would run entirely free firmware and software: [[Debian]] derivative with a choice of desktop environments [[GNOME]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/gnome-foundation-partners-with-purism-to-support-its-efforts-to-build-the-librem-5-smartphone/|title=GNOME Foundation Partners with Purism to Support Its Efforts to Build the Librem 5 Smartphone – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[KDE Plasma 5#Plasma%20Mobile|KDE Plasma Mobile]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://puri.sm/posts/librem5-kde-partnership-announcement/|title=Purism and KDE to Work Together on World’s First Truly Free Smartphone – Purism|website=puri.sm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Ubuntu Touch]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fossbytes.com/librem-5-ubuntu-touch-support/|title=Open Source Smartphone Librem 5 Will Officially Support Ubuntu Touch|last=Verma|first=Adarsh|date=2018-04-25|work=Fossbytes|access-date=2018-09-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Furthermore, unlike in any other phone, the [[baseband processor]] would be separated from the CPU main bus and instead connected via a fast [[USB (Communications)|USB]] interface, thus isolated from the main CPU RAM bus. Also, the phone would feature hardware kill switches for the isolated [[baseband processor]], [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], camera, and microphone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/Features/Librem-5-and-the-Challenge-of-the-Free-Phone|title=Librem 5 and the Challenge of the Free Phone » Linux Magazine|last=Byfield|first=Bruce|website=Linux Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1878">The [[United States Air Force]]'s '''Rapid Execution and Combat Targeting System''' ('''REACT''') is a modification of the [[LGM-30 Minuteman]] [[Launch control center (ICBM)|launch control centers (LCC's)]] that provides continual monitoring and rapid retargeting of [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] [[ICBM]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/usa/c3i/react.htm REACT at FAS.org]&lt;/ref&gt; It integrates communication systems and weapon systems into a single console.

There is now 1 launch key and three cooperative switches that must be turned simultaneously by the two missile combat crew members to initiate a launch vote. Prior to REACT, there were two keys.

[[File:Missile Combat Crew on alert.jpg|thumb|right|Minuteman crew at REACT console]]

==History==
The previous Minuteman III command and control system, designated [[Command Data Buffer]] or CDB, required over 20 hours to retarget the entire Minuteman force and 30 minutes to retarget a single ICBM. REACT system needs less than 10 hours to retarget all missiles, while individual missiles can be retargeted in matter of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;AAFM Newsletter, Volume 2, Number 15, June 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

REACT was previously known as the ''ICBM integrated Electronics Upgrade'' (I2EU)

REACT incorporates a secure communication link between LCC and Higher Authority ([[SACCS]]) to receive configuration and targeting data without any need for manual data input.

Automatic processing and decoding of Emergency War Orders is another feature which reduces missile crews' workload.

The REACT upgrades began around 1994. All Minuteman LCC's were upgraded.

'''''Rizzoli &amp; Isles''''' is a [[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] television series starring [[Angie Harmon]] as police detective Jane Rizzoli and [[Sasha Alexander]] as medical examiner Dr. Maura Isles. The one-hour drama is based on the series of ''Rizzoli &amp; Isles'' novels by [[Tess Gerritsen]]. It premiered on July 12, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2010/06/09/new-digs-and-big-career-decisions-on-tap-as-tnts-the-closer-returns-for-sixth-season-monday-july-12/20100609tnt01/ |title=New Digs and Big Career Decisions on Tap as TNT's The Closer Returns for Sixth Season Monday, July 12 |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=June 9, 2010 |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aired 105 episodes in seven seasons, concluding on September 5, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/tv/article99036042.html |title= What to Watch on Monday: ‘Rizzoli &amp; Isles’ series ends on TNT  |publisher=The Charlotte Observer |date=September 5, 2016 |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
{{further|List of Rizzoli &amp; Isles episodes}}
The series' backstory is inspired by the Maura Isles/Jane Rizzoli series of novels by [[Tess Gerritsen]]. Rizzoli appears in the series' first novel, ''[[The Surgeon (novel)|The Surgeon]]'', and Isles is introduced in the second, ''[[The Apprentice (Gerritsen novel)|The Apprentice]]'', which serves as the basis for the television series. Boston detective Jane Rizzoli has been investigating a [[serial killer]] named Charles Hoyt. Hoyt, who was banned from medical school for fondling a corpse, used his vast medical knowledge to systematically torture and kill people, usually choosing couples so that he could induce the most fear in his victims. Jane ascertains Hoyt's location, but as she is searching for him, she is hit in the back of the head and knocked unconscious. She is pinned to the floor by scalpels and awakes as Hoyt prepares to cut her throat, but Vince Korsak, Jane's partner, locates her and shoots Hoyt, saving her life. Jane, reasoning that Korsak would never trust her as his partner after seeing her so vulnerable, applies for a new partner.

The series pilot, "See One. Do One. Teach One", is largely based on the novel ''[[The Apprentice (Gerritsen novel)|The Apprentice]]''. Jane and medical examiner Maura Isles investigate a killer with Hoyt's [[modus operandi]] plus an interest in [[necrophilia]]. Jane and Maura discover that the copycat was John Stark (Brendan McCarthy), a soldier who met Hoyt in medical school, had his identity erased for [[CIA]] [[black operations]], and mimicked Hoyt's MO in a killing spree during said operations. Meanwhile, Hoyt escapes from prison and rejoins his apprentice to continue in his killing. Later, Jane's home is broken into, and she is told by someone posing as part of BPD that her neighbor had been killed; she rushes into the van to see the body but finds Hoyt instead. Hoyt and his apprentice knock her out and kidnap her. When she wakes up they attempt to kill her, but she manages to disarm them by Tasing them and burning Hoyt's eye with a flare. In self-defense, she shoots the apprentice to death, and, when Hoyt reaches for her gun, she shoots him through the hands, giving him injuries similar to the ones he gave her.

New twists are introduced when Jane and Maura discover that a recent murder victim is actually Maura's previously unknown half-brother, resulting in her discovery that her father is notorious criminal Patrick Doyle.

Hoyt returns 18 months later&lt;!--Lola's husband was killed two years before "I'm Your Boogie Man" and six months before "See One. Do One. Teach One". Therefore, 18 months passed between episodes 1–8.--&gt; through another apprentice, Lola, in "I'm Your Boogie Man". Having murdered Lola's abusive husband two years earlier, Hoyt uses her [[Stockholm syndrome]] to his advantage and uses her to stalk Jane. Lola seduces and captures Frankie Rizzoli before tying Jane up. She plans to kidnap Jane until Hoyt can escape from prison, but Jane manages to distract Lola long enough for Frankie to kill Lola with her own revolver.

Hoyt returns again when he arranges for another inmate to be stabbed while he is dying of cancer, luring Jane into the prison so that he can taunt her about another unsolved murder he committed. While speaking to Jane in the prison infirmary, Hoyt tells her to look at what he is reading&amp;mdash;Tess Gerritsen's novel ''The Silent Girl''. Although she manages to find the bodies of his victims&amp;mdash;the family of an old college professor of Hoyt's who was unaware of his expulsion&amp;mdash;Hoyt, aided by a third apprentice, manages to capture Jane and Maura, only to have Jane beat Hoyt and then stab him when he and his apprentice try to kill Maura.

==Cast and characters==
{{anchor|Cast|Characters}}

===Main characters===
* '''Jane Clementine Rizzoli ([[Angie Harmon]])''': a [[Boston Police Department|Boston]] [[detective]] in the Homicide Unit. From an [[Italian American]] family, Jane is brash, sarcastic, and often prickly but also a confident and independent woman as well as a brilliant detective. She is the tomboy daughter of an overprotective mother. She is extremely competitive, especially with her younger brother, Frankie (also a cop), who is often caught in her shadow. Jane can tackle a perp like a linebacker. She rarely lets her guard down with anyone, except her best friend, Maura Isles. She is something of a slob; her apartment has been shown on several occasions to be quite messy, and in one episode she claimed to have just opened a box of cereal five years after originally buying it. As a child, she was slightly chubby, earning her the nickname "Roly-Poly Rizzoli". She mentioned in one episode that she played field hockey as an attacker in junior college. She is the eldest Rizzoli sibling,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother |episodelink=List of Rizzoli &amp; Isles episodes#Season 2 (2011) |series=Rizzoli &amp; Isles |network=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] |airdate=5 December 2011 |season=2 |number=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and graduated from high school in 1994, which puts Jane's birth year at 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=Seventeen Ain't So Sweet |episodelink=List of Rizzoli &amp; Isles episodes#Season 2 (2011) |series=Rizzoli &amp; Isles |network=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] |airdate=12 December 2011 |season=2 |number=13 |minutes=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is hopeless with men and allergic to dogs, but she winds up taking in Jo Friday, a stray dog rescued by her former partner, Korsak. Raised in the blue-collar Boston suburb of [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], Jane has fought long and hard to win the respect of her colleagues, but it is her relationship with her equally stubborn mother, Angela Rizzoli, that sometimes proves to be her biggest headache. During her time on the force, she had a traumatic experience at the hands of a serial killer known as "The Surgeon", Charles Hoyt. While trying to rescue one of his victims, she was taken by surprise from behind and almost became a victim herself. She has matching scars in the center of her palms where Hoyt stabbed her with scalpels, keeping her pinned to the ground. Her original partner, Vince Korsak, saved her life, and Jane survived the brutal, near-death attack by Hoyt. Although she put Hoyt behind bars, she is still haunted by him. She learned that she was pregnant at the end of season four, owing to a liaison with her old boyfriend Casey, but lost the baby midway through the fifth season when she was attacked while protecting a key witness in a case.  In the final season, Jane takes a new job as an instructor at the [[FBI Academy]] in [[Quantico, Virginia]], and works her final case with the Boston PD in the series finale, "Ocean-Frank".{{anchor|Isles}}
* '''Dr. Maura Dorothea Isles ([[Sasha Alexander]])''' [[Category:Fictional adoptees]] : the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Chief Medical Examiner. Isles is a forensic expert working at the Boston Police Department. She is Jane's best friend. Maura is a walking [[encyclopedia]], able to spout out facts regardless of whether or not they are relevant to a case. She has a pet tortoise named Bass, after noted forensic anthropologist [[William M. Bass]]. Maura is not easily ruffled and has a steady temperament. She absolutely loves examining dead bodies, but she has a tendency to diagnose living people a little too often. She is the adopted only child of a wealthy family. In high school, she was nicknamed "Maura-The-Bore-A" because her classmates thought she was boring. She is always impeccably dressed and is known around the force as "Queen of the Dead"; her ring tone on Jane's phone appropriately plays [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]]'s "[[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)#Funeral march|Funeral March]]". Maura is the complete opposite of Jane, though they are best friends; Rizzoli is more of a tomboy, while Maura always looks like she is going to a fashion shoot rather than to the morgue or a crime scene. Though Maura is socially awkward and has trouble with men because of her brutal honesty and habit of revealing all their medical conditions, she is not awkward around Jane. She can analyze x-rays and blood chemistries and can slice open muscles and organs but possesses no scalpel with which to dissect human emotions. Maura also cannot lie; if she does, she breaks out in hives. It is later revealed that her biological father is an Irish crime boss named Paddy Doyle, something she finds out while investigating her half-brother's death. She finds out in the episode "What Doesn't Kill You" (3.1) that her father told her biological mother that she died on the day she was born, August 7, 1976. She subsequently visited a cemetery containing a gravestone with the name "Baby Maura Doyle" on it.  In the series finale, "Ocean-Frank", Maura takes a sabbatical from the ME's office to go to [[Paris]], [[France]], and work on her novel.
* '''Angela Rizzoli''' ([[Lorraine Bracco]]): Jane, Frankie and Tommy's overbearing mother. Angela is fiercely protective of her children, saying she has not slept since Jane decided to become a cop. Angela wishes Jane could be a little more feminine and is constantly trying to set her up on dates. After her divorce, she spent some time working in the precinct's café, and dated Lieutenant Cavanagh, but she quit the job and broke up with Cavanagh when she decided that she needed to re-evaluate her life. She currently works at the bar that Vince Korsak bought and that they all frequent.
* '''Vincent "Vince" Walter Korsak ([[Bruce McGill]])''': Rizzoli's former partner. The two maintain a close bond after years of working together, but Korsak is clearly bothered that he is no longer partnered with Jane. He seems to care for her like a daughter and is nearly as protective of her as Angela is. It is revealed in the series pilot that he saved her life from Hoyt. He will drop whatever he is doing on a moment's notice to rescue an animal, and enjoys watching videos of dogs on the Internet. After remaining a detective for nearly his entire career, Korsak was finally promoted to sergeant-detective in season two, and took the lieutenant's exam in season five. In preparing for retirement, Vince bought the local bar that they all frequent, the Dirty Robber, and employed Angela. He was a [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]] and served during the [[Vietnam War]]. Korsak has been divorced 3 times, despite the jokes that he is behind the times he is very wise and observant. He also has several hobbies including playing guitar and sailing, Maura has even once before asked him for his expertise on seaman knots and skills.  In the series finale, "Ocean-Frank", Korsak retires from the Boston PD after a thirty-two year career.
* '''Barold "Barry" Frost ([[Lee Thompson Young]]) (Seasons 1–4):''' Rizzoli's second partner. A whiz when it comes to computers and technology, he is terrified of dead bodies and becomes ill at the sight of blood. He is very protective of Jane and stands by her like a loyal, tough partner. In the season five premiere, he is killed in a car accident while returning from vacation. In the season five finale, the team establish the Barry Frost Memorial Scholarship, intended for students who are academically gifted and seek to go into professions that would help others but lack the resources to do so.
* '''Francesco "Frankie" Rizzoli, Jr. ([[Jordan Bridges]]):''' Jane's brother and police officer. He looks up to Jane, but does not like feeling caught in her shadow, especially as he tries to make his own way on the police force. Like all the men in Jane's life, Frankie is more protective of Jane than she would like. He is a cop against his mother's wishes, and sees his sister as a role model. In season four, Frankie is promoted to detective and starts taking night classes in computer science in season five to increase his skill set in Frost's absence. In season seven, he begins a romantic relationship with Nina and eventually successfully proposes to her.
* '''Sean Cavanaugh ([[Brian Goodman]]) (Seasons 3–4, main; 1–2, 5, recurring):''' the lieutenant of the Boston PD's Homicide Unit. Fiercely loyal to Jane and an old friend of Korsak, Sean is willing to bend the rules for his guys. It is later discovered that Sean lost his wife and son in a fire (set by Paddy Doyle) back when he and Korsak were rookies.
* '''Nina Holiday ([[Idara Victor]]) (Seasons 6–7, main; 5, recurring):''' a crime scene analyst and computer technician. Formerly a detective, Holiday transferred to Boston Homicide in order to hone her analytical skills in an office-based environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zap2it.com/blogs/idara_victor_joins_rizzoli_isles_as_season_regular-2014-08 |title=Idara Victor joins 'Rizzoli &amp; Isles' as Season 5 regular |work=[[Zap2it]] |accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her being shot in the sixth-season finale, Frankie Rizzoli begins a romantic relationship with her and later successfully proposes to her in the seventh.
* '''Dr. Kent Drake ([[Adam Sinclair (actor)|Adam Sinclair]]) (Season 7, main; 6, recurring):''' a lab technician, and Maura's new assistant starting in the sixth season.  In the series finale, "Ocean-Frank", Kent is set to oversee the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' Medical Examiner's Office during Maura's sabbatical.

===Recurring cast and characters===
* [[Annabeth Gish]] as Alice Sands. Alice was born into a distinguished law enforcement family, but she dropped out of the police academy while Jane was enrolled. Alice was second in her class behind Jane, after having been the best at everything prior to then. This created her dangerous fixation on Jane, which led to Alice inserting herself into a circle of tunnel residents and having them do her bidding. Following a shootout at Korsak's wedding reception, Jane seems to make a personal vendetta against Alice. Jane ultimately corners Alice, who has taken a teenager hostage, and shoots her dead. This leaves her team to wonder if Jane shot her in the line of duty or an act of vengeance.
* [[Tina Huang]] as Susie Chang, the senior criminalist of the Boston Police Department's crime laboratory. She has described herself as having a very physical memory; when circumstances required her to take point in an investigation, she made various dioramas to explain her reasoning. In the third-season episode "Class Action Satisfaction", she is revealed to be a nudist. She was killed in the sixth-season episode "Misconduct" as part of a complex plan to frame the forensics department for poor handling of a recent case, but the subsequent investigation exposed the killer's true agenda.
* [[Donnie Wahlberg]] as Lieutenant Joe Grant, an old rival of Jane's who has known her since childhood. He constantly made fun of her, calling her "Frog-Face" and "Roly-Poly Rizzoli" because she was slightly chubby when she was younger. When he leaves for Washington, DC after being appointed as the liaison between Boston and Homeland Security, he claims that he had liked her for a very long time.
* [[John Doman]] as Patrick "Paddy" Doyle, an Irish-American crime boss and biological father and protector of Maura Isles. Paddy claimed Maura had died as a baby and made sure she was adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ohio.com/entertainment/rich-heldenfels/mailbag-rizzoli-and-isles-parenting-longmire-returns-this-week-1.621678 |title= Mailbag: 'Rizzoli and Isles' parenting; 'Longmire' returns this week |last=Heldenfels |first=Rich |work=[[Akron Beacon-Journal]] |date=September 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Jacqueline Bisset]] as Constance Isles, a visual artist and the adoptive mother of Dr. Maura Isles. She loves Maura but is sorry that they don't have a close relationship.
* [[Colin Egglesfield]] as Thomas "Tommy" Rizzoli: the youngest brother of Jane and Frankie; he is the youngest of the Rizzoli kids, arrested for running a priest over at a crosswalk on his third DUI violation. He returns to the family fold following his release from prison. As of the season two episode [[Rizzoli &amp; Isles (season 2)|"He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother"]], he is 32 years old. He tries to kiss Maura when he comes back to pay her back for her kindness, but she stops him and he develops a huge crush on Maura as he works on starting a new life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother As of season 3, he has a son named TJ, but his relationship with TJ's mother is complicated by his own reluctance to take full responsibility. |episodelink=List of Rizzoli &amp; Isles episodes#Season 2 (2011) |series=Rizzoli &amp; Isles |network=[[TNT (U.S. TV network)|TNT]] |airdate=5 December 2011 |season=2 |number=12 |minutes=1:05 |quote=Your baby is thirty two}}—Frankie Rizzoli, Jr.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Chris Vance (actor)|Chris Vance]] as Charles (Casey) Jones, an old flame of Jane's during high school, reunited with Jane during season two. A [[United States Army|US Army]] officer assigned to the Middle East, he returns to Boston in season three but breaks up with Jane because of injuries that left him partially paralyzed below the waist. He returns in season four's first episode after a successful operation and proposes to Jane, but when he receives the offer of a promotion to colonel, he decides to stay in the army, leaving Jane behind as she was unwilling to leave her life. He is aware that Jane was pregnant with his child, but respects her decision to raise the child alone as he had also made the choice to return to the army; she loses the baby midway through the fifth season after being attacked while protecting a witness.
* [[Darryl Alan Reed]] as Rondo, a man with access to information in the criminal world. Although Jane initially dismisses his offer to be her confidential informant, he does become her informant later on and is currently providing Jane with information from the criminal world. He has also been shown to have a comical character persona, similar to [[Larry Laffer]]. He frequently hits on Jane, calling her "Vanilla", and eventually develops a friendship with Angela, referring to her as "Mrs. Vanilla". He is revealed to be an ex–jazz singer in [[Rizzoli &amp; Isles (season 3)|"This Is How a Heart Breaks"]].
* [[Billy Burke (actor)|Billy Burke]] as Gabriel Dean, an FBI agent often seen working with the Boston Homicide detectives and Medical Examiner's Office.

* [[Chazz Palminteri]] as Francesco "Frank" Rizzoli Sr. – Jane, Frankie, and Tommy's father. He owns and runs a plumbing business called Rizzoli and Sons. He and Angela separate and then divorce after the first season. He later tries to have their marriage annulled so that he can remarry in a Catholic ceremony. He returns to announce he has stage 2 prostate cancer, and, despite the news, his family finds it difficult to overlook his past transgressions.
* [[Matthew Del Negro]] as Giovanni Gilberti, a dim-witted former classmate of Jane's and a blue-collar auto mechanic. He is under the impression that Maura and Jane are dating, which Maura came up with in order to save the two of them from Giovanni's advances.
* [[Michael Massee]] as Charles Hoyt, a former serial killer who stabbed Jane in both hands and continued to threaten Jane, even from behind bars. Hoyt appears in many episodes, including "See One, Do One, Teach One" (episode 1), "I'm Your Boogie Man", and "Remember Me". In the episode "See One, Do One, Teach One", Hoyt and the apprentice he went to medical school with kidnap Jane. Jane shoots and kills the apprentice and throws a flare at Hoyt. Jane then shoots him in the hands and says, "We match". In the episode "Remember Me", Hoyt, despite dying of cancer, lures Jane and Maura into his hospital room with the aid of a new apprentice with the goal of killing Jane before he dies, but Jane manages to get the upper hand and stabs and kills Hoyt with a scalpel while saying, "I win". Despite his death, he continues to haunt Jane and the team and was mentioned in the next two seasons after his death; when dealing with the murders committed by Dennis Rockmond ("Melt My Heart of Stone"), Jane speculates that he may be an apprentice of Hoyt's due to the ritualistic nature of his crimes, and "No One Mourns the Wicked" saw the team deal with a forensic pathologist and her son (conceived by her father's abuse) who were committing murders inspired by Hoyt's methods.

* [[Jaz Sinclair]] as Tasha Williams.

The series started strong in the ratings, as 7.55 million viewers tuned in for the premiere episode. ''Rizzoli &amp; Isles'' was the second most-watched cable program on the evening of July 12, 2010, behind its lead-in, ''[[The Closer]]'', which had 110,000 more viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/07/13/monday-cable-ratings-home-run-derby-goes-yard-pawn-stars-closer-wwe-raw-secret-life-much-more/57037 |title=Monday Cable Ratings: Home Run Derby Goes Yard; Pawn Stars, Closer, WWE RAW, Secret Life &amp; Much More |publisher=TVbytheNumbers |date=July 13, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show finished the week in third behind ''The Closer'' and the final episode of ''[[Deadliest Catch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/455017-USA_Regains_Ratings_Crown.php |title=USA Regains Ratings Crown |last=Umstead |first=R.

A '''scythe''' ({{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|ð}},&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite OED|scythe}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- OED has "Brit. /sʌɪð/" but its /ʌɪ/ is the same phoneme that Wikipedia transcribes as /aɪ/. --&gt; {{IPAc-en|s|aɪ|θ}}{{fact|date=July 2018}}) is an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[hand tool]] for [[mowing]] [[grass]] or [[Harvest|reaping]] [[agriculture|crops]].  It has largely been replaced by [[horse]]-drawn and then [[tractor]] machinery, but is still used in some areas of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].

The word "scythe" derives from [[Old English]] ''siðe''.&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; In [[Middle English]] and after it was usually spelt ''sithe'' or ''sythe''. However, in the 15th century some writers began to use the ''sc-'' spelling as they thought (wrongly) the word was related to the Latin ''scindere'' (meaning "to cut").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=scythe&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the ''sithe'' spelling lingered and notably appears in [[Noah Webster]]'s dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1828.mshaffer.com/d/word/sithe |title=Browse 1828 =&gt; Word SITHE :: Search the 1828 Noah Webster's Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=1828.mshaffer.com |date=2012-06-03 |accessdate=2012-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://1913.mshaffer.com/d/word/sithe |title=Browse 1913 =&gt; Word SITHE :: Search the 1913 Noah Webster's Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=1913.mshaffer.com |date=2012-06-03 |accessdate=2012-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203212309/http://1913.mshaffer.com/d/word/sithe |archivedate=2012-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scythe against hedge.jpg|thumb|A traditional wooden scythe.]]
[[File:scythe.jpg|thumb|A modern scythe of a pattern common in parts of [[Europe]]]]

A scythe consists of a shaft about {{convert|170|cm|in}} long called a ''snaith'', ''snath'', ''snathe'' or ''sned'', traditionally made of wood but now sometimes [[metal]].  Simple snaiths are straight with offset handles, others have an "S" curve or are [[steam bending|steam bent]] in three dimensions to place the handles in an ergonomic configuration but close to shaft.  The snaith has either one or two short handles at right angles to it, usually one near the upper end and always another roughly in the middle.  The handles are usually adjustable to suit the user.  A curved, steel blade between {{Convert|60|to|90|cm|sigfig=2}} long is mounted at the lower end at 90°, or less, to the snaith.  Scythes almost always have the blade projecting from the left side of the snaith when in use, with the edge towards the mower; left-handed scythes are made but cannot be used together with right-handed scythes as the left-handed mower would be mowing in the opposite direction and could not mow in a team.

==Use==
[[File:Scythe user.png|thumb|Using a scythe]]
[[File:CradlePatent.gif|thumb|The addition of a cradle aligns the seed heads and makes picking up and winnowing easier]]

The use of a scythe is traditionally called ''mowing'', now often ''scything'' to distinguish it from machine mowing.  The mower holds the top handle in the left hand and the central one in the right, with the arms straight, the blade parallel and very close to the ground and the uncut grass to the right.  The body is then twisted to the right, the blade hooks the grass and is swung steadily to the left in a long arc ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left.  The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a steady rhythm, stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade.  The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip with each stroke, leaving a uniform [[crop residue|stubble]] on the ground and forming a regular [[windrow]] on the left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/how-to-use-a-scythe-zmaz81mjzraw.aspx|title=How to Use a Scythe - Modern Homesteading - MOTHER EARTH NEWS|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mower moves along the mowing-edge with the uncut grass to the right and the cut grass laid in a neat row to the left, on the previously mown land.  Each strip of ground mown by a scythe is called a ''[[swathe]]'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|s|w|eɪ|ð}}: rhymes with "bathe") or ''swath'' ({{IPAc-en|s|w|ɒ|θ}}: rhymes with "Goth").  Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a [[meadow]] then proceeding clockwise and finishing in the middle.  Mowing grass is easier when it is damp, and so hay-making traditionally began at dawn and often stopped early, the heat of the day being spent raking and carting the hay cut on previous days or peening the blades.

Scythes are designed for different tasks.  A long, thin blade {{Convert|90|to|100|cm|sigfig=2}} is most efficient for mowing grass or wheat, while a shorter, more robust scythe {{Convert|60|to|70|cm|sigfig=2}} is more appropriate for clearing weeds, cutting [[Reed bed|reed]] or [[Cyperaceae|sedge]] and can be used with the blade under water for clearing ditches and waterways.  Skilled mowers using traditional long-bladed scythes honed very sharp were used to maintain short [[lawn]] grass until the invention of the [[lawnmower]].  Many cultures have used a variety of 'cradles' to catch cut different kinds of grain stems, keeping the seed heads aligned and laying them down in an orderly fashion to make them easier to [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] and [[Winnowing|winnow]].

Mowing with a scythe is a skilled task made to look easy by experienced mowers but needs time to learn the skill.  Long-bladed traditional scythes, typically around {{Convert|90|cm|sigfig=2}} (such as in the example below) and suitable for mowing grass or wheat are harder to use at first, consequently, beginners usually start on shorter blades, say {{Convert|70|cm|sigfig=2}} or less. Common beginner's errors include: setting up the snaith with the handles in the wrong locations to suit the body, setting the blade at the wrong turn-in and turn-up angles to suit the conditions, choosing a blade that is too long for the skill level, failing to start with a sharp edge and persevering with a dull one during use, chopping or hacking at the grass, trying to cut too wide a strip of grass at once and striking the ground with the blade. Traditionally, beginners relied on mentors to help them set up and maintain their scythe and to teach them to mow comfortably and efficiently.

===The mowing action===

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Sharpening===
The cutting edge of a tensioned scythe blade is traditionally maintained by occasional [[peening]] followed by frequent [[honing (metalworking)|honing]]. Peening reforms the malleable edge, by hammering, to create the desired profile, to [[Work hardening|work harden]] the metal for improved edge stability, and to remove minor nicks and dents. For mowing fine grass the bevel angle may be peened extremely fine, while for coarser work a larger angle is created to give a more robust edge. Peening requires some skill and is done using a peening hammer and special anvils or by using a peening jig. Historically, a peening station was set up on the edge of the field during harvest but now more likely back in the workshop.

In the example below, a short scythe blade, being used to clear [[bramble]]s, is being sharpened. Before going to the forest the blade is peened back in the workshop; this reforms the malleable steel to create an edge profile that can then be honed. Peening is done only occasionally; how often depends on the hardness of the steel and the nature of the work. The Austrian blade shown is being used to cut tough-stemmed brambles and it is being peened about every thirty hours of work. Nicks and cuts to the blade edge can usually be worked out of the blade by peening and a new edge profile formed for honing.
A peening jig is being used here but blades can be free-peened using various designs of peening anvils. The peening jig shown has two interchangeable caps that set different angles; a coarse angle is set first about 3&amp;nbsp;mm back from the edge and the fine angle is then set on the edge, leaving an edge that lends itself to being easily honed. The blade is then honed using progressively finer honing stones and then taken to the field. In the field the blade is honed using a fine, ovoid [[Sharpening stone|whetstone]] (or ''rubber''), fine-grained for grass, coarser for cereal crops.  Honing is done the moment the mower senses that the edge has gone off; this may be every half hour or more depending on the conditions. The laminated honing stone shown here has two grades of stone and is carried into the field soaking in a water-filled holster on the belt. A burr is set up on the outside of the blade by stroking the blade on the inside, the burr is then taken off by gently stroking it on the outside. There are a great many opinions, regional traditions and variations on exactly how to do this; some eastern European countries even set up the burr on the inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scythecymru.co.uk/scythes-for-sale/peening/|title=Peening and Sharpening - Scythe Cymru|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stevetomlincrafts.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/learning-to-peen-a-scythe/|title=Learning to peen a scythe|first=Steve|last=Tomlin|date=31 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Unlike continental European blades, typical American, English, and Nordic style blades are made of harder steel and are not usually peened for risk of cracking them. The harder blade holds an edge longer and requires less frequent honing in the field but after heavy use or damage the edge must be reshaped by grinding. Because of the greater wear resistance of the hard steel, and the reduced need for honing as a result, this usually only needs to be done around 1–3 times a season. Many examples have a laminated construction with a hard, wear-resistant core providing the edge and softer sides providing strength. In American and English blades the edge steel is typically clad on either side with the tough iron, while some Nordic laminated blades have a layer of iron on the top only, with the edge steel comprising the bottom layer.

==History==
[[File:Wandalbert von Prüm - Juli.jpg|thumb|[[Germans|German]] peasant with scythe from 850 AD]]
[[File:Early Medieval Scythe.jpg|thumb|Early Medieval scythe blade from the Merovingian site Kerkhove-Kouter in Belgium (collection number: RAMS00393)]]

The scythe may have dated back as far as {{circa|500 BC}}, and seems to have been used in Ancient Rome, but became more common in Europe with agricultural developments during the [[Carolingian era]] (8th century AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Scythe |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/scythe |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=26 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially used mostly for mowing hay, it had replaced the [[sickle]] for reaping crops by the 16th century as the scythe was better [[Ergonomics|ergonomically]] and consequently more efficient. In about 1800 the ''[[grain cradle]]'', was sometimes added to the standard scythe when mowing grain; the cradle was an addition of light wooden fingers above the scythe blade which kept the grain stems aligned and the heads together to make the collection and threshing easier.  In the [[developed world]] the scythe has largely been replaced by the motorised [[lawn mower]] and [[combine harvester]].  However, the scythe remained in common use for many years after the introduction of machines because a side-mounted finger-bar mower, whether horse or tractor drawn, could not mow in front of itself and scythes were still needed to ''open up'' a meadow by clearing the first swathe to give the mechanical mower room to start.

The [[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities]] of [[Sir William Smith]] claims that the scythe, known in Latin as the ''falx foenaria'' as opposed to the sickle, the ''falx messoria'', was used by the ancient Romans. According to ancient [[Greek mythology]], [[Gaia]] the Greek goddess and mother of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] gave a sickle made out of the strongest metal to her youngest son [[Cronus|Kronos]], who is also the youngest of the Titans and god of the harvest, to seek vengeance against her husband [[Uranus (mythology)|Ouranos]] for torturing their oldest sons. To illustrate this, Smith cites an image of Saturn holding a scythe, from an ancient Italian cameo. The [[Grim Reaper]] and the Greek Titan [[Cronus]] were often depicted carrying or wielding a scythe. According to Jack Herer and ''Flesh of The Gods'' (Emboden, W.A., Jr., Praeger Press, New York, 1974), the ancient [[Scythians]] grew hemp and harvested it with a hand reaper that we still call a scythe.

The [[Abbeydale Industrial Hamlet]] in [[Sheffield, England]] is a [[museum]] of a scythe-making works that was in operation from the end of the 18th century until the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.simt.co.uk/abbeydale/ Sheffield Industrial Museums Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050107201433/http://www.simt.co.uk/abbeydale/ |date=2005-01-07 }}. Simt.co.uk (2010-10-03). Retrieved on 2011-03-09.&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of the former scythe-making district of north [[Derbyshire]], which extended into [[Eckington, Derbyshire|Eckington]].&lt;ref&gt;K. M.

King, 'The north Worcestershire Scythe Industry' ''Historical Metallurgy'' 41(2), 124–147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Renaissance [[scythe sword]], the Greek and Roman [[harpe]] and the Egyptian [[khopesh]] were scythes or sickles modified as weapons or symbols of authority. An improvised conversion of the agricultural scythe to a [[war scythe]] by re-attaching the blade parallel to the snaith, similar to a [[Bill (weapon)|bill]] has also been used throughout history as a weapon. See ''[[#In art|Scythes in art]]'' below for an example.

[[File:DFRScythey (1).jpg|thumb|This snaith has been steam-bent to place the handles in the correct position for the mower without the need to offset them.  The diagonal tension brace, or "grass nail", is typical of English scythes.]]

The scythe is still an indispensable tool for farmers in developing countries and in mountainous terrain.

In Romania, for example, in the highland landscape of the [[Transylvania]]n [[Apuseni]] mountains,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reif|first1=Albert|last2=Ruşdea|first2=Evelyn|last3=Păcurar|first3=Florin|last4=Rotar|first4=Ioan|last5=Brinkmann|first5=Katja|last6=Auch|first6=Eckhard|last7=Goia|first7=Augustin|last8=Bühler|first8=Josef|title=A Traditional Cultural Landscape in Transformation|journal=Mountain Research and Development|volume=28|pages=18|year=2008|doi=10.1659/mrd.0806}}&lt;/ref&gt; scything is a very important annual activity, taking about 2–3 weeks to complete for a regular house. As scything is a tiring physical activity and is relatively difficult to learn, farmers help each other by forming teams. After each day's harvest, the farmers often celebrate by having a small feast where they dance, drink and eat, while being careful to keep in shape for the next day's hard work. In other parts of the Balkans, such as in [[Serbians|Serbian]] towns, scything competitions are held where the winner takes away a small silver scythe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitserbia.org/i2.php?modid=547&amp;p=readdesc&amp;infoid=802&amp;tabid=109&amp;tabindex=33&amp;portalid=1 Events in Serbia.

Among [[Basque people|Basques]] scythe-mowing competitions are still a popular traditional sport, called ''[[Basque rural sports#Sega jokoa (scything)|segalaritza]]'' (from Spanish verb ''segar'': to mow). Each contender competes to cut a defined section of grown grass before his rival does the same.

There is an international scything competition held at Goricko&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.park-goricko.org/en/informacije.asp?id_informacija=3756&amp;id_jezik=3&amp;id_tip1=1&amp;id_tip2=9&amp;id_tip3=2 Krajinski park Goričko].

He was impressed with the speed of the local reapers, but said such a large scythe would never work in Japan.

The Norwegian municipality of [[Hornindal]] has three scythe blades in its coat-of-arms.

Scythes are beginning a comeback in American suburbs, since they "don't use gas, don't get hot, don't make noise, do make for exercise, and do cut grass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman|first=Barry|title=Who Needs a WeedWacker When You Can Use a Scythe?

The '''Shaheen-III''' ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: {{Nastaliq|شاہین–ااا}}; lit.

Development began in [[secrecy]] in the early 2000s in response to India's ''[[Agni-III]]'', ''Shaheen'' was successfully tested on 9 March 2015 with 2750&amp;nbsp;[[Kilometer|km]] (1700 [[miles|mi]]) range, which could enable it to reach [[Geography of India|all corners]] of India and reach deep into the [[Middle East]] parts of [[North Africa]].&lt;ref name="Voice of Journalists, 2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Analysis|title=Shaheen-III Ballistic Missile: Enforcing Strategic Deterrence|url=http://www.voiceofjournalists.com/shaheen-iii-ballistic-missile-enforcing-strategic-deterrence/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This missile, according to a former Director General of Pakistan’s [[Strategic Plans Division]], is designed to reach Indian islands so that India cannot use them as “strategic bases” to establish a “[[second strike]] capability.”&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/nuke/RL34248.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shaheen'' program is composed of the [[Solid fuel rocket motor|solid-fuel]] system in a contrast to [[Ghauri missile|''Ghauri'']] program that is primarily based on [[Liquid fuel rocket|liquid-fuel]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=6307&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=5/28/2011 |title=Musharraf stopped funds for Ghauri-III missile |date=28 May 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204064523/http://www.thenews.com.pk/TodaysPrintDetail.aspx?ID=6307&amp;Cat=13&amp;dt=5%2F28%2F2011 |archivedate=4 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the successful launch of the ''Shaheen''', it surpasses the range of ''[[Shaheen-II]]''— hence it is the [[IRBM|longest-range]] missile to be launched by the [[Pakistan Armed Forces|military]].&lt;ref name="India Today-Asia Bureau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shukla|first1=Jayoti|title=Pakistan successfully conducted the flight test of ballistic missile Shaheen-III|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/education/story/pakistan-successfully-conducted-the-flight-test-of-ballistic-missile-shaheen-iii/1/423057.html.|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=India Today|publisher=India Today-Asia Bureau|date=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
===Development history===
{{Main|Integrated Missile Research and Development Programme}}
[[File:Shaheen-III-missile-range.svg|thumb|Speculative range of the Shaheen-III.]]
The range of the Shaheen-3 is sufficient to target all of mainland India from launch positions in most of Pakistan to the south of Islamabad. But apparently, the missile was developed to do more than that. According to Gen. Kidwai, the range of 2750 km was determined by a need to be able to target the [[Nicobar and Andaman Islands]] in the eastern part of the Indian Ocean that are “developed as strategic bases” where “India might think of putting its weapons”. But for a 2750-km range Shaheen-3 to reach the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, it would need to be launched from positions in the very Eastern parts of Pakistan, close to the Indian border. If deployed in the Western parts of the Balochistan province, the range of the Shaheen-3 would for the first time bring Israel within range of Pakistani nuclear missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00963402.2016.1241520 | volume=72 | title=Pakistani nuclear forces, 2016 | journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | pages=368–376}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the [[SUPARCO|Space Research Commission]] concluded at least two design studies for its space launch vehicle.&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pike|first1=John|title=Shaheen-III: Space Booster development|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/space/world/pakistan/pakistan-shaheen-iii-space-booster.htm|website=http://www.globalsecurity.org/|publisher=Global Security, Inc.|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, there were two earlier designs were shown in [[International Defence Exhibition and Seminar|IDEAS]] held in 2002 and its design was centered on developing a space booster based on the design technologies of the [[Shaheen-I]].&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."/&gt; Since then, Shaheen owes its existence largely to the joint efforts led by [[National Defence Complex|NDC]] of [[NESCOM|NeScom]] and [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission|Space Research Commission]].&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."/&gt;

The ''Shaheen-III'' was shrouded in top [[secrecy]] and very little information was available to the public, mostly provided in [[International Defence Exhibition and Seminar|2002 IDEAS]].&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."/&gt; Majority of the efforts and funding was being made available to ''[[Ghauri-III]]'' to seek strike in [[East India|Eastern region]] of India.&lt;ref name="News International"/&gt; In May 2000, the ''Ghauri-III'' was cancelled due to its less advance and lack of technological gain.&lt;ref name="News International"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khan|first1=Abdul Qadeer|authorlink1=Abdul Qadeer Khan|title=Musharraf stopped funds for Ghauri-III missile saying: "Do you want to destroy Israel"|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=News International|publisher=News International|date=28 May 2011|archiveurl=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-6307-Musharraf-stopped-funds-for-Ghauri-III-missile-saying-%E2%80%9CDo-you-want-to-destroy-Israel%E2%80%9D#sthash.f4XOjGe2.dpuf|archivedate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite strong advocacy by [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] for the Ghauri-III program made to be feasible, the program was terminated by then-[[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] who made the funding available for ''Shaheen-III'' program which was to be led under [[Samar Mubarakmand]].&lt;ref name="defensenews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=3823118 |title=Pakistan Pushes To Improve Missile Strike Capability |publisher=Defense News |date=2008-11-17 |accessdate=2011-03-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Air Force Strategic Command (Pakistan)|Air Force]], however, pressed for ''Shaheen-III'' to make it feasible as [[Liquid fuel|liquids]] were being developed that would allow the missiles to be left in a ready-to-shoot form for extended periods.&lt;ref name="Defence News, 2008"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ansari|first1=Usman|title=Pakistan Pushes To improve Missile Strike Capability|url=http://www.defensenews.com.|accessdate=11 March 2015|agency=Defence News|publisher=Defence News, 2008|date=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Shaheen-III'' was initially purposed as the [[Expendable launch system|space booster]] for the [[Pakistan space program|space program]] to make it possible for installing the satellite [[payload]] applications.&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."/&gt; Despite its efforts, the existence of ''Shaheen-III'' continued to be speculated in [[news media]] as [[Pakistan Ministry of Defence]] and the [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|Joint Staff HQ]] [[Policy of deliberate ambiguity|nor confirms or deny]] the existence of the program.&lt;ref name="Global Security, Inc."/&gt;

==Testings==
On 9 March 2015, the [[Inter Services Public Relations|ISPR]] released a press statement on notifying the successful testing of the Shaheen-III that was conducted from the southern coast off the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name="ISPR"&gt;{{cite web|last1=ISPR Press Release|title=Shaheen 3 Missile test: ISPR|url=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/front/main.asp?o=t-press_release&amp;latest=1|website=https://www.ispr.gov.pk/|publisher=ISPR|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military officials from [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|JS HQ]], [[Strategic Plans Division|SPD]] scientists and engineers, oversaw the launch of the system and witnessed the [[Bullseye (target)|impact point]] in the [[Arabian Sea]].&lt;ref name="Daily Times, Pakistan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Associated Agencies |title=Pakistan successfully tests Shaheen-III missile |url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/09-Mar-2015/pakistan-successfully-tests-shaheen-iii-missile |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312123741/http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/09-Mar-2015/pakistan-successfully-tests-shaheen-iii-missile |dead-url=yes |archive-date=12 March 2015 |accessdate=11 March 2015 |agency=Daily Times, Pakistan |publisher=Daily Times, Pakistan |date=10 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports summed up by [[Nuclear Threat Initiative|NTI]], there had been series of testings taken place of the [[rocket engine nozzle]]s before the eventual tests took place in 2015.&lt;ref name="Nuclear Threat Initiative"&gt;{{cite web|last1=NTI|title=Delivery system|url=http://www.nti.org/country-profiles/pakistan/delivery-systems/|website=\http://www.nti.org/|publisher=Nuclear Threat Initiative|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
===Strategic prospect===
{{Main|Nuclear brinksmanship|Mutually assured destruction}}
Several Pakistani [[Nuclear strategy|nuclear]] and [[Military strategy|military strategists]] reportedly quoted that the "Shaheen-III has a range greater than that of any other missile system in-service.&lt;ref name="Washington Post-Asia Pacific Bureau" /&gt; Earlier testings of ''[[Shaheen-II]]'' had the maximum range of about 2,500[[Kilometer|km]], which meant it can reach all parts of India, even the [[East India|eastern frontier]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post-Asia Pacific Bureau" /&gt;

[[Air Marshal]] [[Shahid Lateef|Shahid Latif]], a retired senior commander in the [[Pakistan Air Force]], noted the strategic significance of missile: ''"Now, India doesn’t have its [[sanctuary|safe haven]]s anymore. It's all a reaction to India, which has now gone even for tests of [[Agni V|extra-regional missiles]]. It sends a [very] loud message: If you hurt us, we are going to hurt you back.!"''&lt;ref name="Washington Post-Asia Pacific Bureau" /&gt;

Mansoor Ahmad, a professor of [[Strategic studies]] at the Islamabad's [[Quaid-i-Azam University]], stated that: "Pakistan's [[Pakistani military|military]], however, is not interested in a "[[tit-for-tat]]" [[arms race]] with India." and speculated that developmental work may be under progress to make missile capable of delivering [[Multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle|multiple warheads]] which would make them harder to defend against.&lt;ref name="Washington Post-Asia Pacific Bureau" /&gt;

===Peace prospect===
{{Main|India–Pakistan relations|l1=Confidence building measures in India–Pakistan relations|Peace through strength}}
In a views of [[Political science|political scientist]], dr. [[Farrukh Saleem]], the ''Shaheen-III'' seems to be a reaction to [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program|Indian-generated threats]].&lt;ref name="News International, Opinion"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Saleem|first1=Farrukh|authorlink1=Farrukh Saleem|title=Shaheen-III to force India to talk peace|accessdate=11 March 2015|work=Opinion work published by Dr. Farrukh Saleem|agency=News International, Opinion|publisher=News International, 2015|date=10 March 2015|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-2-306009-Shaheen-III-to-force-India-to-talk-peace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Farrukh Saleem|Saleem]], on the other hand, stressed that: "Pakistan does not seem to be aiming at competing with India but Pakistan's aims seem to revolve around the creation of a [[N-deterrence|credible deterrence]], and a [[N-deterrence|credible deterrence]] is bound to strengthen [[Threat Matrix (database)|strategic stability]]."&lt;ref name="News International, Opinion"/&gt;

Dr. [[Farrukh Saleem]]'s views were also echoed by Mansoor Ahmad who maintained that: "Pakistan hopes to improve "existing capabilities," including new delivery systems for evading an Indian [[Indian Missile Defense Program|missile defense shield]].&lt;ref name="Washington Post-Asia Pacific Bureau" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5613">'''Single instruction, multiple thread''' ('''SIMT''') is an execution model used in [[parallel computing]] where [[single instruction, multiple data]] (SIMD) is combined with [[Thread (computing)#Multithreading|multithreading]].

==Overview==
The processors, say a number {{mvar|p}} of them, seem to execute many more than {{mvar|p}} tasks. This is achieved by each processor having multiple "threads" (or "work-items" or "Sequence of SIMD Lane operations"), which execute in lock-step, and are analogous to [[SIMD lanes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael McCool |author2=James Reinders |author3=Arch Robison |title=Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation |publisher=Elsevier |year=2013 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SIMT execution model has been implemented on several [[GPU]]s and is relevant for [[general-purpose computing on graphics processing units]] (GPGPU), e.g. some [[supercomputer]]s combine CPUs with GPUs.

SIMT was introduced by [[Nvidia]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nvidia.com/content/PDF/fermi_white_papers/NVIDIA_Fermi_Compute_Architecture_Whitepaper.pdf |title=Nvidia Fermi Compute Architecture Whitepaper |date=2009 |website=http://www.nvidia.com/ |publisher=NVIDIA Corporation |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=teslaPaper&gt;{{cite journal |title=NVIDIA Tesla: A Unified Graphics and Computing Architecture |date=2008 |page=6 {{subscription required|s}} |doi=10.1109/MM.2008.31 |volume=28 |issue=2 |journal=IEEE Micro|last1=Lindholm |first1=Erik |last2=Nickolls |first2=John |last3=Oberman |first3=Stuart |last4=Montrym |first4=John }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote| Nvidia's [[Tesla (microarchitecture)|Tesla GPU microarchitecture]] (first available November 8, 2006 as implemented in the ''"G80"'' GPU chip) introduced the single-instruction multiple-thread (SIMT) execution model where multiple independent threads execute concurrently using a single instruction.}}

[[ATI Technologies]] (now [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]]) released a competing product slightly later on May 14, 2007, the [[TeraScale (microarchitecture)#TeraScale 1|TeraScale 1]]-based ''"R600"'' GPU chip.

As access time of all the widespread [[random-access memory|RAM]] types (e.g. [[DDR SDRAM]], [[GDDR SDRAM]], [[XDR DRAM]], etc.) is still relatively high, engineers came up with the idea to hide the latency that inevitably comes with each memory access. Strictly, the latency-hiding is a feature of the zero-overhead scheduling implemented by modern GPUs. This might or might not be considered to be a property of 'SIMT' itself.

SIMT is intended to limit [[instruction fetching]] overhead,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first1=Sean |last1=Rul |first2=Hans |last2=Vandierendonck |first3=Joris |last3=D’Haene |first4=Koen |last4=De Bosschere |title=An experimental study on performance portability of OpenCL kernels |year=2010 |conference=Symp. Application Accelerators in High Performance Computing (SAAHPC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the latency that comes with memory access, and is used in modern GPUs (such as those of [[Nvidia]] and [[AMD]]) in combination with 'latency hiding' to enable high-performance execution despite considerable latency in memory-access operations. This is where the processor is oversubscribed with computation tasks, and is able to quickly switch between tasks when it would otherwise have to wait on memory. This strategy is comparable to [[Multithreading (computer architecture)|multithreading in CPUs]] (not to be confused with [[Multi-core processor|multi-core]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vetter/keeneland/tutorial-2011-04-14/12-advanced_topics_in_cuda.pdf |title=Advanced Topics in CUDA |date=2011 |website=cc.gatech.edu |accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A downside of SIMT execution is the fact that thread-specific control-flow is performed using "masking", leading to poor utilization where a processor's threads follow different control-flow paths. For instance, to handle an ''IF''-''ELSE'' block where various threads of a processor execute different paths, all threads must actually process both paths (as all threads of a processor always execute in lock-step), but masking is used to disable and enable the various threads as appropriate. Masking is avoided when control flow is coherent for the threads of a processor, i.e. they all follow the same path of execution. The masking strategy is what distinguishes SIMT from ordinary SIMD, and has the benefit of inexpensive synchronization between the threads of a processor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael McCool |author2=James Reinders |author3=Arch Robison |title=Structured Parallel Programming: Patterns for Efficient Computation |publisher=Elsevier |year=2013 |pages=209 ff.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current flowing out of the fixed layer is spin-polarized. When it reaches the free layer the majority spins relax into lower-energy states of opposite spin, applying a torque to the free layer in the process.]][[File:Spin valve schematic.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic diagram of a spin valve/magnetic tunnel junction.  In a spin valve the spacer layer (purple) is metallic; in a magnetic tunnel junction it is insulating.]] '''Spin-transfer torque''' is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a [[magnetic tunnel junction]] or [[spin valve]] can be modified using a spin-polarized current.

Charge carriers (such as electrons) have a property known as [[spin (physics)|spin]] which is a small quantity of [[angular momentum]] intrinsic to the carrier. An electric current is generally unpolarized (consisting of 50% spin-up and 50% spin-down electrons); a spin polarized current is one with more electrons of either spin. By passing a current through a thick magnetic layer (usually called the “fixed layer”), one can produce a spin-polarized current.  If this spin-polarized current is directed into a second, thinner magnetic layer (the “free layer”), angular momentum can be transferred to this layer, changing its orientation.  This can be used to excite [[ferromagnetic resonance|oscillations]] or even flip the orientation of the magnet.  The effects are usually only seen in nanometer scale devices.

==Spin-transfer torque memory==
Spin-transfer torque can be used to flip the active elements in magnetic random-access memory.  Spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-RAM or STT-MRAM) has the advantages of lower power consumption and better scalability over conventional [[magnetoresistive random-access memory]] (MRAM) which uses magnetic fields to flip the active elements &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.mattod.2017.07.007|title=Spintronics based random access memory: A review|journal=Materials Today|volume=20|issue=9|pages=530|year=2017|last1=Bhatti|first1=Sabpreet|last2=Sbiaa|first2=Rachid|last3=Hirohata|first3=Atsufumi|last4=Ohno|first4=Hideo|last5=Fukami|first5=Shunsuke|last6=Piramanayagam|first6=S.N}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Spin-transfer torque technology has the potential to make possible MRAM devices combining low current requirements and reduced cost; however, the amount of current needed to reorient the magnetization is at present too high for most commercial applications, and the reduction of this current density alone is the basis for present academic research in spin electronics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.jmmm.2007.12.019

A '''spudger''' (or sometimes '''spludger''') is a tool that has a wide flat-head screwdriver-like end that extends as a wedge, used to separate pressure-fit plastic components without causing damage during separation. The flat end of the spudger is often used to loosen or release components inside [[electronics]], for example during the replacement of batteries or touch screens for [[smartphones]].  The other end is often a point or a hook depending on application.  When applied to separate pressure-fit panels, there is often a point to create an initial gap before the wedge end is utilized.

A spudger is also a wiring [[tool]] used for poking or adjusting small wires or components, generally in the [[electronics]] and [[telecommunications]] industries.  A typical spudger is an insulating stick, made of either wood, plastic or a nylon fiberglass material. For instances where the spudger is used for prying it is commonly made of stainless steel or other metals.&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Haan, Radio Testing and Trouble Shooting, Part I, [https://books.google.com/books?id=1N8DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA835 Popular Mechanics, Vol. 49, No. 5] (May 1928); pages 834–836.  See page 835, column 1, for a discussion of spudgers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://doc.telephonecollectors.info/dm/074-257-117_I2.pdf Bell System Practices, Section 074-257-117], "Tools, Spudgers - Description", Issue 2, May 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://spudgers.com/#types Types of Spudger Tool], Spudgers.com. Interfuse LLC. Retrieved 30 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common modern spudger is a black or yellow [[nylon]] stick with a metal hook at one end. Various versions have blunt, sharpened, or insulated hooks. The hook can be used for pulling bridge clips from [[66 block]]s, manipulating wires in a crowded [[wire wrap]] block, or setting [[DIP switch]]es. The body of a plastic spudger is usually contoured to offer a better grip. Some spudgers are made of [[Citrus × sinensis#Wood|orangewood]], used in electronics assembly and [[soldering]] because of its heat tolerance and dense grain. The same orangewood sticks are commonly used in [[filmmaking]], [[manicure]] and [[pedicure]], but these industries do not use the term "spudger".

In telecom applications like punch-down terminal blocks and cell phone repair, the spudger is made of a non-conductive material to prevent transmission of a static shock or direct short to sensitive electrical components' inputs or outputs.  This is critical with high density applications where uninsulated terminals are in close proximity, like a battery or with telephone patch junctions.

The spudger is called a '''non-marring nylon black stick tool''' or simply '''black stick''' in many electronics repair manuals, where it is the recommended tool for prying open certain laptops, audio file players, keyboards, LCDs and other tight fitting electronic enclosures and assemblies.

{{Antennas|expanded=types}}

A '''television antenna''', or '''TV aerial''', is an [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] specifically designed for the [[Telecommunication|reception]] of over-the-air [[terrestrial television|broadcast television]] [[signal]]s, which are transmitted at frequencies from about 41 to 250&amp;nbsp;[[MHz]] in the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] band, and 470 to 960&amp;nbsp;MHz in the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] band [[Television channel frequencies|in different countries]]. Television antennas are manufactured in two different types: "indoor" antennas, to be located on top of or next to the [[television set]], and "outdoor" antennas, mounted on a [[Radio masts and towers|mast]] on top of the owner's house. They can also be mounted in a loft or attic, where the dry conditions and increased elevation are advantageous for reception and antenna longevity. Outdoor antennas are more expensive and difficult to install, but are necessary for adequate reception in [[fringe reception|fringe]] areas far from television stations. The most common types of indoor antennas are the [[dipole antenna|dipole]]&lt;ref name="Gulati"&gt;{{cite book

==Description==
In most countries, television broadcasting is allowed in the [[Very high frequency]] (VHF) band from 47 to 68&amp;nbsp;MHz, called VHF low band or [[band I]] in Europe; 174 to 216&amp;nbsp;MHz, called VHF high band or [[band III]] in Europe, and in the [[ultra high frequency]] (UHF) band from 470 to 698&amp;nbsp;MHz, called [[band IV]] and [[band V|V]] in Europe. The boundaries of each band vary somewhat in different countries.   

To cover this range, antennas generally consist of multiple conductors of different lengths depending on the wavelength of the radio waves they receive.  The elements of most antennas are [[half-wave dipole]]s; metal rods half the [[wavelength]] of the signal they are intended to receive. The wavelength of a signal equals the [[speed of light|speed of light (c)]] divided by the frequency.  The above range of frequencies is too wide to be covered by a single antenna, so often separate antennas for the VHF and UHF bands are used; or a combined antenna that has both VHF and UHF elements mounted on the same boom.  During the last decade many countries in the world switched from broadcasting using an older [[analog television]] standard to newer [[digital television]] (DTV).  However generally the same broadcast frequencies are used, so the same antennas used for the older analog television will also receive the new DTV broadcasts.  Sellers often claim to supply a special "digital" or "[[high-definition television]]" (HDTV) antenna advised as a replacement for an existing [[analog television]] antenna; at best this is misinformation to generate sales of unneeded equipment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dennysantennaservice.com/1496626.html|title=TV Antenna Range|author=|date=|website=www.dennysantennaservice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/dorset/7667221.stm BBC: Digital switch advice 'shocking' ] 9 of 14 installers gave bad or misleading advice, suggesting that people are likely to need a new aerial for digital switchover ... 5 told the mystery shopper they would need a "digital aerial", when in fact there is no such thing.&lt;/ref&gt; at worst it may leave the viewer with a UHF-only antenna in a local market (particularly in North America) where some digital stations remain on their original [[Band III|high VHF]] frequencies.

==Indoor==
[[File:Rabbit-ears dipole antenna with UHF loop 20090204.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Very common "rabbit ears" indoor antenna.  This model also has a loop antenna for UHF reception.]]

Indoor antennas may be mounted on the television itself or stand on a table next to it, connected to the television by a short [[feedline]].  Due to space constraints indoor antennas cannot be as large and elaborate as outdoor antennas, and they are not mounted at as high an elevation; for these reasons indoor antennas generally do not give as good reception as outdoor antennas.  They are often perfectly adequate in urban and suburban areas which are usually within the strong radiation "footprint" of local television stations, but in rural [[fringe reception]] areas only an outdoor antenna may give adequate reception.  A few of the simplest indoor antennas are described below, but a great variety of designs and types exist.   Many have a dial on the antenna with a number of different settings to alter the antenna's reception pattern.  This should be rotated with the set on while looking at the screen, until the best picture is obtained.   

===Rabbit ears===
The oldest and most widely used indoor antenna is the ''rabbit ears'' or ''bunny ears'', which are often provided with new television sets.   It is a simple [[dipole antenna|half-wave dipole]] antenna used to receive the VHF television bands, consisting in the US of 52 to 88&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[band I]]) and 174 to 216&amp;nbsp;MHz ([[band III]]), with wavelengths of 5.5 to 1.4 m.  It is constructed of two telescoping rods attached to a base, which extend out to about 1 meter length (approximately one quarter wavelength at 52&amp;nbsp;MHz), and can be collapsed when not in use.   For best reception the rods should be adjusted to be a little less than 1/4 [[wavelength]] at the frequency of the television channel being received.  However the dipole has a wide [[bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]], so often adequate reception is achieved without adjusting the length.   The half wave dipole has a low [[antenna gain|gain]] of about 2.14&amp;nbsp;dBi; this means it is not as directional and sensitive to distant stations as a large rooftop antenna, but its wide angle reception pattern may allow it to receive several stations located in different directions without requiring readjustment when the channel is changed.  Dipole antennas are bi-directional, that is, they have two [[main lobe]]s in opposite directions, 180° apart.  Instead of being fixed in position like other antennas, the elements are mounted on ball-and-socket joints and can be adjusted to various angles in a "V" shape, allowing them to be moved out of the way in crowded quarters.   Another reason for the V shape is that when receiving channels at the top of the band with the rods fully extended, the antenna elements will typically resonate at their 3rd [[harmonic (music)|harmonic]].  In this mode the direction of maximum gain (the [[main lobe]]) is no longer perpendicular to the rods, but the radiation pattern will have lobes at an angle to the rods, making it advantageous to be able to adjust them to various angles

=== Whip antenna ===
Some portable televisions use a [[whip antenna]].  This consists of a single telescoping rod about a meter long attached to the television, which can be retracted when not in use.  It functions as a [[quarter-wave antenna|quarter-wave]] [[monopole antenna]].  The other side of the feedline is connected to the [[ground plane]] on the TV's circuit board, which acts as [[ground (electricity)|ground]].  The whip antenna generally has an [[omnidirectional antenna|omnidirectional]] reception pattern, with maximum sensitivity in directions perpendicular to the antenna axis, and gain similar to the half-wave dipole.

=== Loop antenna ===
The UHF channels are often received by a single turn [[loop antenna]].  Since a "rabbit ears" antenna only covers the VHF bands, it is often combined with a UHF loop mounted on the same base to cover all the TV channels.

==== Flat antenna====
Soon after television broadcasting switched from analog to digital broadcasting, indoor antennas have evolved beyond the traditional "rabbit ears."  RCA is one manufacturer which has commercially sold a flat antenna.  Flat antennas are very lightweight, very thin, and square-shaped like a thin notebook.  They connect to televisions, or to digital converter boxes, with a single coaxial cable, and may be sold with an optional signal amplifier. Internally, the thin, flat square is a loop antenna, with its circular metallic wiring embedded into conductive plastic.  The amplifier must be plugged into a power source, but the flat antenna does not require a power source.   The flat antenna may need some moving around to achieve an optimum reception, but it eliminates a lot of manipulation which is inherent in use of the "rabbit ears".{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

==Outdoor==
[[File:Mast 1-2.jpg|right|200px]]
{{see also|Yagi antenna|Log-periodic antenna}}
An outdoor TV antenna is a [[antenna gain|high-gain]] [[directional antenna]] often needed to achieve adequate reception in [[fringe reception]] areas, greater than 15 miles from the television station.  Outdoor antennas have a unidirectional [[radiation pattern]] so the correct end of the antenna must be pointed at the TV station.  The received television signal passes down a [[feed line]] ([[transmission line]]) into the house to the television.  Older antennas used flat 300 ohm [[twin-lead]] cable.  This had to be kept several inches away from metal objects such as the antenna tower or gutters, so it had to be mounted on standoff insulators.  Modern antennas use 50 ohm RG-6 [[coaxial cable]] which attaches to the television with a type F connector.   

Outdoor antenna designs are often based on the [[Yagi-Uda antenna]] or [[log-periodic dipole array]] (LPDA). These are composed of multiple [[half-wave dipole]] elements, consisting of metal rods approximately half of the [[wavelength]] of the television signal, mounted in a line on a support boom.  These act as [[resonator]]s; the electric field of the incoming radio wave pushes the electrons in the rods back and forth, creating [[standing wave]]s of oscillating voltage in the rods. The antenna can have a smaller or larger number of rod elements; in general the more elements the higher the gain. Another design, used mainly for UHF reception, is the [[reflective array antenna]], consisting of a vertical metal screen with multiple dipole elements mounted in front of it.    

The television broadcast bands are too wide in frequency to be covered by a single antenna, so either separate antennas are used for the VHF and UHF bands, or a combination (combo) VHF/UHF antenna. A VHF/UHF antenna is really two antennas feeding the same feedline mounted on the same support boom. Longer elements which pick up [[Very high frequency|VHF]] frequencies are located at the "back" of the boom and often function as a [[log-periodic]] antenna. Shorter elements which receive the [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations are located at the "front" of the boom and often function as a [[Yagi antenna]].

Outdoor antennas are highly directional. They have a narrow [[main lobe]]; that is, their maximum sensitivity (gain) is only achieved over a narrow angle along their axis, so they must be pointed at the transmitting antenna. This presents a problem when the television stations to be received are located in different directions. In this case two or more directional rooftop antennas each pointed at a different transmitter are often mounted on the same mast and connected to one receiver. An alternative is to use a single antenna mounted on a ''rotator''; a remote [[servo system]] that rotates the antenna to a new direction when a dial next to the television is turned. 

Sometimes television transmitters are organised such that all receivers in a given location need receive transmissions in only a relatively narrow band of the full UHF television spectrum and from the same direction, so that a single antenna provides reception from all stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aerialsandtv.com/aerials.html#aerialgroups UK aerial groups] In the UK transmitters are grouped into A, B, C, D, E, and K frequency bands and located so that, as far as possible, they are all in the same direction for receivers in a given region. This allows optimal reception of all stations by a single fixed narrow-band (and hence high-gain) antenna pointing in a fixed direction.&lt;/ref&gt;

Antennas are commonly placed on [[roof|rooftops]], and sometimes in [[attic]]s. Placing an antenna indoors significantly attenuates the level of the available signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robsaerials.com.au/What_you_Need.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304202902/http://www.robsaerials.com.au/What_you_Need.php |archivedate=2011-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvantenna.com/support/tutorials/atticantennas.html|title=Attic Mounted TV Antennas - Stallions Satellite and Antenna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=tvantenna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directional antennas must be pointed at the [[transmitter]] they are receiving; in most cases great accuracy is not needed. In a given region it is sometimes arranged that all television transmitters are located in roughly the same direction and use frequencies spaced closely enough that a single antenna suffices for all. A single transmitter location may transmit signals for several channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aerialsandtv.com/nationwidetransmitters.html#WhichTransmitterAmIOn|title=UK TV Transmitters|author=|date=|website=www.aerialsandtv.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; CABD (communal antenna broadcast distribution) is a system installed inside a building to receive free-to-air TV/FM signals transmitted via radio frequencies and distribute them to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/glossary.htm|title=Digital TV|author=|date=|website=www.digitaltv.gov.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Analog television]] signals are susceptible to [[Ghosting (television)|ghosting]] in the image, multiple closely spaced images giving the impression of blurred and repeated images of edges in the picture. This is due to the signal being reflected from nearby objects (buildings, tree, mountains); several copies of the signal, of different strengths and subject to different delays, are picked up. This is different for different transmissions. Careful positioning of the antenna can produce a compromise position which minimizes the ghosts on different channels. Ghosting is also possible if multiple antennas connected to the same receiver pick up the same station, especially if the lengths of the cables connecting them to the splitter/merger are different lengths or the antennas are too close together.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvantenna.com/support/tutorials/combining.html|title=Combining or Stacking Two TV Antennas - Stallions Satellite and Antenna&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=tvantenna.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analog television is being replaced by digital, which is not subject to ghosting but is far more prone to interference; the same reflected signal that causes ghosting in an analog signal would produce no viewable content at all in digital.

===Rooftop and other outdoor antennas===

Aerials are attached to roofs in various ways, usually on a pole to elevate it above the roof. This is generally sufficient in most areas. In some places, however, such as a deep valley or near taller structures, the antenna may need to be placed significantly higher, using a [[guide mast]] or [[radio masts and towers|mast]]. The wire connecting the antenna to indoors is referred to as the ''{{visible anchor|downlead}}'' or ''[[Drop (telecommunication)|drop]]'', and the longer the downlead is, the greater the signal degradation in the wire. Certain cables may help reduce this tendency. 

The higher the antenna is placed, the better it will perform. An antenna of higher [[Antenna gain|gain]] will be able to receive weaker signals from its preferred direction. Intervening buildings, topographical features (mountains), and dense forest will weaken the signal; in many cases the signal will be reflected such that a usable signal is still available. There are physical dangers inherent to high or complex antennas, such as the structure falling or being destroyed by weather. There are also varying [[local ordinance]]s which restrict and limit such things as the height of a structure without obtaining [[Construction permit|permits]]. For example, in the United States, the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]] allows any homeowner to install "An antenna that is designed to receive local television broadcast signals", but that "masts higher than 12 feet above the roof-line may be subject to local permitting requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/media/over-air-reception-devices-rule|title=FCC Over-the-Air Reception Devices Rule|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indoor antennas===

As discussed previously, antennas may be placed indoors where signals are strong enough to overcome antenna shortcomings. The antenna is simply plugged into the television receiver and placed conveniently, often on the top of the receiver ("set-top"). Sometimes the position needs to be experimented with to get the best picture. Indoor antennas can also benefit from RF amplification, commonly called a TV booster. Indoor antennas will never be an option in weak signal areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

===Attic installation===

Sometimes it is desired not to put an antenna on the roof; in these cases, antennas designed for outdoor use are often mounted in the attic or loft, although antennas designed for attic use are also available. Putting an antenna indoors significantly decreases its performance due to lower elevation above ground level and intervening walls; however, in strong signal areas reception may be satisfactory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; One layer of [[asphalt]] [[roof shingle|shingles]], [[roof felt]], and a [[plywood]] [[roof deck]] is considered to attenuate the signal to about half.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terrestrial-digital.com/faqs.html#faq9|title=Antennas Direct - FAQs About HD Television Antennas|author=|date=|website=www.terrestrial-digital.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple antennas, rotators===

[[File:Multiple Antenna.JPG|thumb|right|220px|Two aerials set up on a roof. Spaced horizontally and vertically]]

It is sometimes desired to receive signals from transmitters which are not in the same direction. This can be achieved, for one station at a time, by using a [[Antenna rotator|rotator]] operated by an electric motor to turn the antenna as desired. Alternatively, two or more antennas, each pointing at a desired transmitter and coupled by appropriate circuitry, can be used. To prevent the antennas from interfering with each other, the vertical spacing between the booms must be at least half the wavelength of the lowest frequency to be received (Distance=[[λ]]/2).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; The wavelength of 54&amp;nbsp;MHz (Channel 2) is 5.5 meters (λ x f = [[speed of light|c]]) so the antennas must be a minimum of 2.25 metres, or  about 89&amp;nbsp;inches apart. It is also important that the cables connecting the antennas to the signal splitter/merger be exactly the same length, to prevent [[Phase (waves)|phasing]] issues, which cause ghosting with analog reception. That is, the antennas might both pick up the same station; the signal from the one with the shorter cable will reach the receiver slightly sooner, supplying the receiver with two pictures slightly offset. There may be phasing issues even with the same length of down-lead cable. [[Bandpass]] [[Electronic filter|filters]] or "signal traps" may help to reduce this problem.

For side-by-side placement of multiple antennas, as is common in a space of limited height such as an attic, they should be separated by at least  one full wavelength of the lowest frequency to be received at their closest point.

Often when multiple antennas are used, one is for a range of co-located stations and the other is for a single transmitter in a different direction.

===Safety===

* TV antennas are good conductors of electricity and attract lightning, acting as a [[lightning rod]]. The use of a [[lightning arrestor]] is usual to protect against this. A large grounding rod connected to both the antenna and the mast or pole is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nojolt.com/lightning_protection_for_tv_antennas.shtml|title=Lightning Protection for TV and Radio Antennas&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|author=|date=|website=nojolt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Properly installed masts, especially tall ones, are [[Guy-wire|guyed]] with [[galvanized]] cable; no insulators are needed. They are designed to withstand worst-case weather conditions in the area, and positioned so that they do not interfere with [[power lines]] if they fall.
*There is inherent danger in being on the rooftop of a house, required for installing or adjusting a television antenna.

'''Irish inventions and discoveries''' are objects, processes or techniques which owe their existence either partially or entirely to an [[Irish people|Irish]] person. Often, things which are discovered for the first time, are also called "inventions", and in many cases, there is no clear line between the two. Below is a list of such inventions.

[[File:Toner-container-black-0a.jpg|thumb|Black toner container]][[Image:Toner.jpg|thumb|Colored toner container]]

'''Toner''' is a [[Powder (substance)|powder]] mixture used in [[laser printer]]s and [[photocopier]]s to form the printed text and images on the [[paper]], in general through a [[toner cartridge]]. Mostly granulated plastic, early mixtures only added [[carbon]] powder and [[iron oxide]], however mixtures have since been developed containing [[polypropylene]], [[fumed silica]], and various minerals for [[triboelectrification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2015/03/whats-inside-printer-toner/ |title=Inside Laser Printer Toner: Wax, Static, Lots of Plastic |first=Lee |last=Simmons |publisher=WIRED}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toner using plant-derived plastic also exists as an alternative to [[petroleum]] plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rechargermag.com/articles/67765/ |publisher=The US Environmental Protection Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toner particles are melted by the heat of the [[Laser Printer#Fusing|fuser]], and are thus bonded to the paper.

In earlier photocopiers, this low-cost carbon toner was poured by the user from a bottle into a reservoir in the machine{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}. Later copiers, and laser printers from the first 1984 Hewlett-Packard LaserJet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hp.com/hpinfo/abouthp/histnfacts/museum/imagingprinting/0018/index.html |title=HP Virtual Museum: Hewlett-Packard LaserJet printer, 1984 |newspaper=Hp.com |date=  |author= |accessdate= 28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; feed directly from a sealed toner [[Toner cartridge|cartridge]].

Laser toner cartridges for use in color copiers and printers come in sets of cyan, magenta, yellow and black ([[CMYK]]), allowing a very large color gamut to be generated by mixing.

== Composition, size and manufacture ==
The specific polymer used varies by manufacturer but can be a [[styrene]] [[acrylate]] [[copolymer]], a [[polyester resin]], a styrene butadiene copolymer, or a few other special polymers. Toner formulations vary from manufacturer to manufacturer and even from machine to machine. Typically formulation, granule size and [[melting point]] vary the most.

Originally, the particle size of toner averaged 14–16 [[micrometre]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

To improve image resolution, particle size was reduced, eventually reaching about 8–10&amp;nbsp;micrometers for 600 [[dots per inch]] resolution.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} Further reductions in particle size producing further improvements in resolution are being developed through the application of new technologies such as Emulsion-Aggregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Toner has traditionally been made by compounding the ingredients and creating a slab which was broken or pelletized, then turned into a fine powder with a controlled particle size range by [[jet mill|air jet milling]]. This process results in toner granules with varying sizes and aspherical shapes. To get a finer print, some companies are using a chemical process to grow toner particles from molecular reagents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Galliford Consulting |title=Chemically Prepared Toner |year=2006 |url = http://www.gallifordconsulting.com/Chemically%20Prpared%20Toner%20Basics.pdf |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061015215850/http://www.gallifordconsulting.com/CPT%20Magazine%20Article%20New.pdf
|archivedate=2006-10-15 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in more uniform size and shapes of toner particles. The smaller, uniform shapes permit more accurate colour reproduction and more efficient toner use.

== Clean-up ==
Toner can be washed off [[skin]] and [[garment]]s with cold water.  Hot or warm water softens the toner, causing it to bond in place.  Toner fused to skin eventually wears off, or can be partially removed using an abrasive hand cleaner.  Toner fused to clothing usually cannot be removed.

Toner particles have [[electrostatic]] properties by design and can develop static-electric charges when they rub against other particles, objects, or the interiors of transport systems and vacuum cleaner hoses.  Because of this and the small particle size, toner should not be vacuumed with a conventional home [[vacuum cleaner]]. Static discharge from charged toner particles theoretically may ignite dust&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nfpa.org/~/media/files/research/research-foundation/foundation-proceedings/dust_explosion_fundamentals_ignition_criteria_and_pressure_d.pdf|title= Dust Explosion Fundamentals: Ignition Criteria and Pressure Development|author= Robert Zalosh |date= 2009|website= |publisher= [[National Fire Prevention Association]]|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the vacuum cleaner bag or create a small explosion if sufficient toner is airborne. Toner particles are so fine that they are poorly filtered by household vacuum cleaner filter bags and can blow through the vacuum motor into the room. So they also can cause overheat by clogging the motor filter and [[short circuit]] by their electric conductivity (carbon, iron) when they melt inside the motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dansdata.com/sbs16.htm | title=Step By Step 16 - Preventative Maintenance | website="Dan's Data"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If toner spills into the laser printer, a special type of vacuum cleaner with an electrically conductive hose and a high efficiency ([[HEPA]]) filter may be needed for effective cleaning. These are called [[electrostatic discharge]]-safe (ESD-safe) or toner vacuums.  Similar HEPA-filter equipped vacuums should be used for clean-up of larger toner spills.

Unfused toner is easily cleaned from most water-washable clothing. Because toner is a wax or plastic powder with a low melting temperature, it must be kept cold while cleaning. The washing machine should be filled with cold water before adding the garment. Two complete wash cycles improve the chances of success. The first may use hand wash dish detergent, the second may use regular laundry detergent. Residual toner floating in the rinse water of the first cycle will remain in the garment and may cause permanent graying. A clothes dryer or iron should not be used until all toner has been removed.

== Health risks ==
As a fine powder, toner can remain suspended in the air for some period, and is considered to have [[health effect]]s comparable to [[Chemically inert|inert]] [[dust]]. It can be an irritant to people with [[respiration (physiology)|respiratory]] conditions such as [[asthma]] or [[bronchitis]]. Following studies on [[bacterium|bacteria]] in the 1970s that raised concerns about health effects resulting from [[pyrrole]], a contaminant created during manufacture of the carbon black used in black toner, manufacturing processes were changed to eliminate pyrrole from the finished product.

Research by the [[Queensland University of Technology]] has indicated that some laser printers emit submicrometer particles which have been associated in other environmental studies with [[respiratory disease]]s .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last1 = Morawska| first1 = Lidia|last2= He|first2=Congrong|last3=Taplin|first3=Len| title = Particle Emission Characteristics of Office Printers | work = International Laboratory for Air Quality and Health ([[Queensland University of Technology]]); Queensland Department of Public Works| pages = 1–7| publisher = SF Gate| date = 2007-07-10| url =http://www.genano.fi/pdf/americanchemicalsociety.pdf| format = PDF| accessdate = 2007-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study at the [[University of Rostock]] has found that the microscopic particles in toner are carcinogenic, similar to asbestos. Several technicians who had been working with printers and copiers on a daily basis were observed for several years.  They showed increased lung problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Laut Studie kann Tonerstaub Krebs verursachen|trans-title= Toner dust can cause cancer, according to study| language = German| newspaper = [[Berliner Morgenpost]]| url = https://www.morgenpost.de/web-wissen/gesundheit/article105112825/Laut-Studie-kann-Tonerstaub-Krebs-verursachen.html| accessdate = 2017-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This confirms previous research published in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ewers|first1= U.|last2= Nowak|first2= D.|date= 2006|title= Gesundheitsschäden und Erkrankungen durch Emissionen aus Laserdruckern und Kopiergeräten?|trans-title= Health hazards caused by emissions of laser printers and copiers?|url= http://springer-vdi-verlag.de/libary/common/X370-Ewers.pdf|language= German|journal= Gefahrstoffe – Reinhaltung der Luft|volume= 66|issue= 5|pages=203{{en dash}}210|location= Dusseldorf|publisher= Springer|issn= 0949-8036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Packaging ==
[[File:Tonerkassette Laserdrucker HP.jpg|thumb|The toner cartridge is a kind of toner container, that is also a consumable component of the printer.]]
{{Further|toner cartridge}}

The toner container can be a simple pack, for toner storage and transportation,  or further, a consumable component of the printer.
The most common way to consume toner is with a [[toner cartridge]] (or ''laser toner''), 
as an [[Office supplies|office supply]] of a [[laser printer]]s.

=== Repackaging ===
{{Further|Toner refill}}

Several toner manufacturers offer toner in wholesale quantities. Typically, bulk loose toner is sold in barrels or 10&amp;nbsp;kg (22-pound) bags.

Toner is then used by a variety of industries in order to provide consumers with a finished laser toner cartridge.

Original Equipment manufacturers such as [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Canon (company)|Canon]] as well as manufacturers of compatible toner cartridges use the toner in the process of manufacturing a brand new OEM cartridge.
Remanufacturers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tonerguy.net/managing-the-cost-of-printing-and-copying-whitepaper/ |title=Whitepaper - Managing the cost of printing and copying. |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=tonerguy.net |publisher=Gunn Trading Ltd |access-date=16 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of toner cartridges use the bulk toner in the process of creating a remanufactured toner cartridge. Other companies use the toner to provide a [[toner refill]] service.

Most toner cartridges are available to the average consumer through retail outlets or local remanufacturing operations. Remanufactured and refilled toner cartridges are generally offered at a lower cost than original toner cartridges, having been either wholly remanufactured and then refilled with toner (the more-optimal method) or just refilled with toner (the less-optimal method)..

== Environmental considerations ==
Recycling of pre-consumer waste toner is practiced by most manufacturers.  Classifying toner to the desired size distribution produces off-size rejects, but these become valuable feedstocks for the compounding operation, and are recycled this way.  [[Post-consumer waste]] toner appears primarily in the cleaning operation of the photo-printing machine.  In early printers, as much as 20 to 25% of feed toner would wind up in the cleaner sump and be discarded as waste.  Improved printer efficiencies have reduced this waste stream to lower levels, although on average 13% of the toner in each cartridge is still wasted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2015-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some printer designs have attempted to divert this waste toner back into the virgin toner reservoir for direct reuse in the printer; these attempts have met with mixed success as the composition of the toner will change by expending fusibles while retaining developer particles.  Some consideration and fewer industry attempts have been made to reclaim waste toner by cleaning it and "remanufacturing" it.

Most toner goes to printed pages, a large fraction of which are ultimately recycled in paper recovery and recycling operations.  Removal of toner from the pulp is not easy, and toner formulations to ease this step have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;Kittelberger, Steve and Sacripante, Guerino, "Easily deinkable toner: A solution to the deinking problem for small mills". ''Pulp &amp; Paper Canada''. 104:5, (2003) p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrolyzable, water-soluble, and caustic-soluble toner resins have been reported, but do not appear to enjoy widespread application.  Most [[paper recycling]] facilities mix toner with other waste material, such as inks and resins, into a sludge with no commercial use.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], large compatible ink cartridge manufacturers like [[Jet Tec|Jet Tec  &amp; Dubaria]] have implemented toner recycling programs in order to receive back empty cartridges for refilling of HP, Lexmark, Dell, etc. cartridges, as no compatible version is readily available.

Unstructured information is typically [[plain text|text]]-heavy, but may contain data such as dates, numbers, and facts as well.

== Background ==

The earliest research into [[business intelligence]] focused in on unstructured textual data, rather than numerical data.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=Seth|title=A Brief History of Text Analytics|url=http://www.b-eye-network.com/view/6311|website=B Eye Network|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1958, [[computer science]] researchers like [[Hans Peter Luhn|H.P. Luhn]] were particularly concerned with the extraction and classification of unstructured text.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; However, only since the turn of the century has the technology caught up with the research interest. In 2004, the [[SAS (software)|SAS]] Institute developed the SAS Text Miner, which uses [[Singular Value Decomposition]] (SVD) to reduce a [[Dimensional Analysis|hyper-dimensional]] textual [[space (mathematics)|space]] into smaller dimensions for significantly more efficient machine-analysis.&lt;ref name="SVD"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Albright|first1=Russ|title=Taming Text with the SVD|url=ftp://ftp.sas.com/techsup/download/EMiner/TamingTextwiththeSVD.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematical and technological advances sparked by [[machine learning|machine]] textual analysis prompted a number of businesses to research applications, leading to the development of fields like [[sentiment analysis]], [[voice of the customer]] mining, and call center optimization.&lt;ref name="Applications"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desai|first1=Manish|title=Applications of Text Analytics|url=http://mybusinessanalytics.blogspot.com/2009/08/applications-of-text-analytics.html|website=My Business Analytics @ Blogspot|accessdate=June 24, 2016|date=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emergence of [[Big Data]] in the late 2000s led to a heightened interest in the applications of unstructured data analytics in contemporary fields such as [[predictive analytics]] and [[root cause analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chakraborty|first1=Goutam|title=Analysis of Unstructured Data: Applications of Text Analytics and Sentiment Mining|url=https://support.sas.com/resources/papers/proceedings14/1288-2014.pdf|website=SAS|accessdate=June 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues with terminology ==
The term is imprecise for several reasons:
# [[Structure]], while not formally defined, can still be implied.
# Data with some form of structure may still be characterized as unstructured if its structure is not helpful for the processing task at hand.
# Unstructured information might have some structure ([[semi-structured data|semi-structured]]) or even be highly structured but in ways that are unanticipated or unannounced.

== Dealing with unstructured data ==
Techniques such as [[data mining]], [[natural language processing]] (NLP), and [[text analytics]] provide different methods to [[pattern recognition|find patterns]] in, or otherwise interpret, this information. Common techniques for structuring text usually involve manual [[Tag (metadata)|tagging with metadata]] or [[part-of-speech tagging]] for further [[text mining]]-based structuring. The [[UIMA|Unstructured Information Management Architecture]] (UIMA) standard provided a common framework for processing this information to extract meaning and create structured data about the information.&lt;ref name = "IBMContentAnalytics"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Holzinger |first2=Christof |last2=Stocker |first3=Bernhard |last3=Ofner |first4=Gottfried |last4=Prohaska |first5=Alberto |last5=Brabenetz |first6=Rainer |last6=Hofmann-Wellenhof |year=2013 |chapter=Combining HCI, Natural Language Processing, and Knowledge Discovery – Potential of IBM Content Analytics as an Assistive Technology in the Biomedical Field |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39146-0_2 |pages=13–24 |editor1-first=Andreas |editor1-last=Holzinger |editor2-first=Gabriella |editor2-last=Pasi |title=Human-Computer Interaction and Knowledge Discovery in Complex, Unstructured, Big Data |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-39146-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Software that creates machine-processable structure can utilize the linguistic, auditory, and visual structure that exist in all forms of human communication.&lt;ref name="IntelligentEnterprise"&gt;{{cite web |title=Structure, Models and Meaning: Is "unstructured" data merely unmodeled? |url=http://www.intelligententerprise.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=59301538 |website=InformationWeek |language=en |date=March 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Algorithms can infer this inherent structure from text, for instance, by examining word [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], sentence syntax, and other small- and large-scale patterns. Unstructured information can then be enriched and tagged to address ambiguities and relevancy-based techniques then used to facilitate search and discovery. Examples of "unstructured data" may include books, journals, documents, [[metadata]], [[health record]]s, [[Sound|audio]], [[video]], [[Analog device|analog data]], images, files, and unstructured text such as the body of an [[e-mail]] message, [[Web page]], or [[word-processor]] document. While the main content being conveyed does not have a defined structure, it generally comes packaged in objects (e.g. in files or documents, …) that themselves have structure and are thus a mix of structured and unstructured data, but collectively this is still referred to as "unstructured data".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malone |first1=Robert |title=Structuring Unstructured Data |url=https://www.forbes.com/2007/04/04/teradata-solution-software-biz-logistics-cx_rm_0405data.html |website=Forbes |language=en |date=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an [[HTML]] web page is tagged, but HTML mark-up typically serves solely for rendering. It does not capture the meaning or function of tagged elements in ways that support automated processing of the information content of the page. [[XHTML]] tagging does allow machine processing of elements, although it typically does not capture or convey the semantic meaning of tagged terms.

Since unstructured data commonly occurs in [[electronic document]]s, the use of a [[content management|content]] or [[document management]] system which can categorize entire documents is often preferred over data transfer and manipulation from within the documents. Document management thus provides the means to convey structure onto [[text corpus|document collections]].

[[Search engines]] have become popular tools for indexing and searching through such data, especially text.

=== Approaches in natural language processing ===
Specific computational workflows have been developed to impose structure upon the unstructured data contained within text documents. These workflows are generally designed to handle sets of thousands or even millions of documents, or far more than manual approaches to annotation may permit. Several of these approaches are based upon the concept of [[Online analytical processing|online analytical processing, or OLAP]], and may be supported by data models such as text cubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lin|first=Cindy Xide|last2=Ding|first2=Bolin|last3=Han|first3=Jiawei|last4=Zhu|first4=Feida|last5=Zhao|first5=Bo|date=December 2008|title=Text Cube: Computing IR Measures for Multidimensional Text Database Analysis|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4781199/?reload=true|journal=2008 Eighth IEEE International Conference on Data Mining|language=en-US|publisher=IEEE|doi=10.1109/icdm.2008.135|isbn=9780769535029|citeseerx=10.1.1.215.3177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once document metadata is available through a data model, generating summaries of subsets of documents (i.e., cells within a text cube) may be performed with phrase-based approaches.&lt;ref name = "textcubes"&gt;{{cite web |title=Multi-Dimensional, Phrase-Based Summarization in Text Cubes |url=http://sites.computer.org/debull/A16sept/p74.pdf |last=Tao|first=Fangbo | last2=Zhuang|first2=Honglei | last3=Yu|first3=Chi Wang| first4=Qi|last4=Wang | first5=Taylor|last5=Cassidy | first6=Lance|last6=Kaplan | first7=Clare|last7=Voss| last8=Han | first8=Jiawei | date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Approaches in medicine and biomedical research ===
Biomedical research generates one major source of unstructured data as researchers often publish their findings in scholarly journals. Though the language in these documents is challenging to derive structural elements from (e.g., due to the complicated technical vocabulary contained within and the domain knowledge required to fully contextualize observations), the results of these activities may yield links between technical and medical studies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collier|first=Nigel|last2=Nazarenko|first2=Adeline|last3=Baud|first3=Robert|last4=Ruch|first4=Patrick|date=June 2006|title=Recent advances in natural language processing for biomedical applications|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume=75|issue=6|pages=413–417|doi=10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2005.06.008|issn=1386-5056|pmid=16139564}}&lt;/ref&gt; and clues regarding new disease therapies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gonzalez|first=Graciela H.|last2=Tahsin|first2=Tasnia|last3=Goodale|first3=Britton C.|last4=Greene|first4=Anna C.|last5=Greene|first5=Casey S.|date=January 2016|title=Recent Advances and Emerging Applications in Text and Data Mining for Biomedical Discovery|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|volume=17|issue=1|pages=33–42|doi=10.1093/bib/bbv087|issn=1477-4054|pmc=4719073|pmid=26420781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent efforts to enforce structure upon biomedical documents include [[self-organizing map]] approaches for identifying topics among documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skupin|first=André|last2=Biberstine|first2=Joseph R.|last3=Börner|first3=Katy|date=2013|title=Visualizing the topical structure of the medical sciences: a self-organizing map approach|journal=PLOS One|volume=8|issue=3|pages=e58779|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0058779|issn=1932-6203|pmc=3595294|pmid=23554924}}&lt;/ref&gt; general-purpose [[Unsupervised learning|unsupervised algorithms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiela|first=Douwe|last2=Guo|first2=Yufan|last3=Stenius|first3=Ulla|last4=Korhonen|first4=Anna|date=2015-04-01|title=Unsupervised discovery of information structure in biomedical documents|journal=Bioinformatics|volume=31|issue=7|pages=1084–1092|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btu758|issn=1367-4811|pmid=25411329}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an application of the CaseOLAP workflow&lt;ref name = "textcubes" /&gt; to determine associations between protein names and [[cardiovascular disease]] topics in the literature.&lt;ref name="caseolapCV"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liem|first=David A.|last2=Murali|first2=Sanjana|last3=Sigdel|first3=Dibakar|last4=Shi|first4=Yu|last5=Wang|first5=Xuan|last6=Shen|first6=Jiaming|last7=Choi|first7=Howard|last8=Caufield|first8=John H.|last9=Wang|first9=Wei|last10=Ping|first10=Peipei|last11=Han|first11=Jiawei|date=Oct 1, 2018|title=Phrase mining of textual data to analyze extracellular matrix protein patterns across cardiovascular disease|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

A '''wetware computer''' is an [[Organic matter|organic]] computer (which can also be known as an '''artificial organic brain''' or a '''neurocomputer''') composed of organic material such as living [[neurons]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Wetware computers composed of neurons are significantly different than conventional computers because they are thought to be capable in a way of "thinking for themselves", because of the dynamic nature of neurons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/358822.stm|title=Biological Computer Born|last=|first=|date=June 2, 1999|work=BBC News|access-date=October 24, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While wetware is still largely conceptual, there has been limited success with construction and prototyping, which has acted as a proof of the concept's realistic application to computing in the future. The most notable examples of prototyping have stemmed from the research completed by biological engineer William Ditto during his time at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; His work constructing a simple neurocomputer capable of basic addition from leech neurons in 1999 was a significant discovery for the concept. This research acted as a primary example driving interest in the creation of these artificially constructed, but still organic [[brain]]s.

== Overview ==
The concept of wetware is an application of specific interest to the field of computer manufacturing. A specific application of wetware of interest in the computer industry is in regards to [[Moore's law|Moore’s law]]. This observation by [[Gordon Moore]] which states that the number of [[transistor]]s, which can be placed on a [[Integrated circuit|silicon chip]], is doubled roughly every two years. [[Moore's law]] has acted as a goal for the industry for decades, but as the size of computers continues to get smaller, the ability to meet this goal has become much more difficult, threatening to reach a plateau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nautil.us/issue/21/information/moores-law-is-about-to-get-weird|title=Moore's Law Is About To Get Weird|last=Popkin|first=Gabriel|date=February 15, 2015|website=Nautilis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulty in reducing the size of computers because of size limitations of transistors and integrated circuits wetware provides an unconventional alternative. A wetware computer composed of neurons is an ideal concept because, unlike conventional materials which operate in binary (on/ off) a neuron can shift between thousands of states, constantly altering its chemical conformation, and redirecting electrical pulses through over 200,000 channels in any of its many synaptic connections.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of this large difference in the possible settings for any one neuron compared to the binary limitations of conventional computers the space limitations are far less.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Background ==
The word wetware is a distinct and unconventional concept which draws slight resonance with both [[Computer hardware|hardware]] and [[software]] from conventional computers. While “hardware” is understood as the physical architecture of tradition computational devices, built from the electrical circuitry and silicone plates, software is the conceptual opposite of hardware, it represents the encoded architecture of storage and instructions. Wetware is a separate concept which utilizes the formation of organic molecules, mostly complex cellular structures (such as neurons) to create a computational device such as a computer. In wetware the idea of hardware and software are intertwined and interdependent. The molecular, and chemical composition of the organic or biological structure would represent not only the physical structure of the wetware but also the "software", being continually reprogrammed by the discrete shifts in electrical pulses and chemical concentration gradients as the molecules change their structures to communicate signals. The responsiveness of a cell, proteins, and molecules to changing conformations both within their own structures and around them tie the idea of internal programming, and external structure together in a way which is completely alien to the current model of conventional computer architecture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The structure of wetware represents a model where the external structure and internal programming are interdependent and unified; meaning that changes to the programming or internal communication between molecules of the device would represent a physical change in the structure. The dynamic nature of wetware borrows from the function of complex cellular structures in biological organisms. The combination of “hardware” and “software” into one dynamic, and interdependent system which utilizes organic molecules and complexes to create an unconventional model for computational devices is a specific example of applied [[biorobotics]].

=== Cells as a Model of Wetware ===
Cells in many ways can be seen as their own form of naturally occurring wetware, similar to the concept that the human brain is the preexisting model system for complex wetware. In his book ''Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell'' (2009) [[Dennis Bray]] explains his theory that cells, which are the most basic form of life, are just a highly complex computational structure, like a computer. To simplify one of his arguments a cell can be seen as a type of computer, utilizing its own structured architecture. In this architecture, much like a traditional computer many smaller components operate in tandem to receive input, process the information, and compute an output. In an overly simplified, and non-technical analysis cellular function can be broken into the following components. Information and instructions for execution are stored as DNA in the cell, RNA acts as a source for distinctly encoded input which processed by ribosomes and other transcription factors to access and process the DNA and to output a protein. Bray's argument in favor of viewing cells and cellular structures as models of natural computational devices is important when considering the more applied theories of wetware in relation to biorobotics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Wetware: A Computer in Every Living Cell|last=Bray|first=Dennis|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780300155440|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biorobotics ===
Wetware and biorobotics are closely related concepts, which both borrow from similar overall principles. A biorobotic structure can be defined as a system modeled from a preexisting organic complex or model such as cells (neurons) or more complex structures like organs (brain) or whole organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ljspeert|first=Auke|date=October 10, 2014|title=Biorobotics: Using robots to emulate and investigate agile locomotion|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6206/196.full|journal=Science|volume= 346| issue = 6206|pages=196–203|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike wetware the concept of biorobotics is not always a system composed of organic molecules, but instead could be composed of conventional material which is designed and assembled in a structure similar or derived from a biological model. Biorobotics have many applications, and are used to address the challenges of conventional computer architecture. Conceptually, designing a program, robot, or computational device after a preexisting biological model such as a cell, or even a whole organism provides the engineer or programmer the benefits of incorporating into the structure the evolutionary advantages of the model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trimmer|first=Bary|date=12 November 2008|title=New Challenges in Biorobotics: Incorporating Soft Tissue into Control Systems|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/abb/2008/505213/citations/|journal=Applied Bionics and Biomechanics|volume= 5 |issue=3|pages=119–126|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications &amp; Goals ==

=== Basic Neurocomputer Composed of Leech Neurons ===
In 1999 William Ditto and his team of researchers at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Institute of technology]] and [[Emory University]] created a basic form of a wetware computer capable of simple addition by harnessing leech neurons.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Leeches were used as a model organism due to the large size of their neuron, and the ease associated with their collection and manipulation.The computer was able to complete basic addition through electrical probes inserted into the neuron. The manipulation of electrical currents through neurons was not a trivial accomplishment, however. Unlike conventional computer architecture which is based on the binary on/ off states, neurons are capable of existing in thousands of states and communicate with each other through synaptic connections which each contain over 200,000 channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ltd2DQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=Georgia+Institute+of+technology+%22neurocomputer%22#v=onepage&amp;q=Georgia%20Institute%20of%20technology%20%22neurocomputer%22&amp;f=false|title=Intelligent and Evolutionary Systems: The 20th Asia Pacific Symposium, IES 2016, Canberra, Australia, November 2016, Proceedings|last=Leu|first=George|last2=Singh|first2=Hemant Kumar|last3=Elsayed|first3=Saber|date=2016-11-08|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783319490496|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each can be dynamically shifted in a process called "self-organization" to constantly form and reform new connections. A conventional computer program called the "dynamic Clamp" was written by [[Eve Marder]], a neurobiologist at [[Brandeis University]] that was capable of reading the electrical pulses from the neurons in real times, and interpreting them. This program was used to manipulate the electrical signals being input into the neurons to represent numbers, and to communicate with each other to return the sum. While this computer is a very basic example of a wetware structure it represents a small example with fewer neurons than found in a more complex organ. It is thought by Ditto that by increasing the amount of neurons present the chaotic signals sent between them will "self-organize" into a more structured pattern, such as the regulation of heart neurons into a constant heartbeat found in humans and other living organisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sincell, Mark |title=Future Tech |work=Discover |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2000/oct/feattech |access-date=2018-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological Models for Conventional Computing ===
After his work creating a basic computer from leech neurons Ditto continued to work not only with organic molecules and wetware, but also on the concept of applying the chaotic nature of biological systems and organic molecules to conventional material and logic gates. Chaotic systems have advantages for generating patterns and computing  higher order functions like memory, arithmetic logic, input/output operations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imsc.res.in/~sudeshna/Ditto_for_ICAND.pdf|title=Construction of a Chaotic Computer Chip|last=Ditto|first=William|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his article ''Construction of a Chaotic Computer Chip'' Ditto discusses the advantages in programming of using chaotic systems, with their greater sensitivity to respond and reconfigure logic gates in his conceptual chaotic chip. The main difference between a chaotic computer chip, and a conventional computer chip is the reconfigurability of the chaotic system. A traditional computer chip, where a programmable gate array element must be reconfigured through the switching of many single-purpose logic gates, a chaotic chip is able to reconfigure all logic gates through the control of the pattern generated by the non-linear chaotic element.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Impact of Wetware in Cognitive Biology ===
The concept of [[cognitive biology]] evaluates cognition as a basic biological function. [[W. Tecumseh Fitch]], a professor of cognitive biology at the [[University of Vienna]] is a leading theorist on ideas of cellular intentionality. The idea that not only do whole organisms have a sense of "aboutness" of intentionality, but that single cells also carry a sense of intentionality through cells ability to adapt and reorganize in response to certain stimuli.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitch|first=W. Tecumseh|date=25 August 2007|title=Nano-Intentionality: A Defense of Intrinsic Intentionality|url=|journal=Springer|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fitch discusses the idea of nano-intentionality, specifically in regards to neurons, in their ability to adjust rearrangements in order to create neural networks. He discusses the ability of cells such as neurons to respond independently to stimuli such as damage to be what he considers "intrinsic intentionality" in cells, explaining that "[w]hile at a vastly simpler level than intentionality at the human cognitive level, I propose that this basic capacity of living things [response to stimuli] provides the necessary building blocks for cognition, and higher-order intentionality".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fitch describes the value of his research to specific areas of computer science such as artificial intelligence, and computer architecture. He states that "[I]f a researcher aims to make a conscious machine, doing it with rigid switches (whether vacuum tubes or static silicon chips) is barking up the wrong tree."&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Fitch believes that an important aspect of the development of areas such as artificial intelligence is wetware with nano-intentionalility, and autonomous ability to adapt and restructure itself.

In a review of the above-mentioned research conducted by Fitch, Daniel Dennett a professor at Tufts University discusses the importance of the distinction between the concept of hardware and software when evaluating the idea of wetware, and organic material such as neurons. Dennett discusses the value of observing the human brain, as a preexisting example of wetware. He sees the brain as having "the competence of a silicon computer to take on an unlimited variety of temporary cognitive roles".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dennett |first=D. |date=2014 |title=The Software/Wetware Distinction |journal=Physics of Life Reviews |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=367–368 |doi=10.1016/j.plrev.2014.05.009 |pmid=24998042}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennett disagrees with Fitch on certain areas, such as the relationship of software/ hardware versus wetware, and what a machine with wetware might be capable of. Dennett highlights the importance of additional research into human cognition to better understand the intrinsic mechanism by which the human brain can operate, to better create an organic computer.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Future Applications of Wetware ===
The subfield of organic computers and wetware is still largely hypothetical and in a preliminary stage. While there has yet to be major developments in the creation of an organic computer since the neuron based calculator developed by William Ditto in the 1990s the research mentioned in the sections above continues to push the field forward. Specific examples of research such as the modeling of chaotic pathways in silicon chips by William Ditto have made new discoveries in ways of organizing traditional silicon chips, and structuring computer Architecture to be more efficient, and better structured.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ideas emerging from the field of cognitive biology also help to continue to push discoveries in ways of structuring systems for artificial intelligence, to better imitate preexisting systems in humans.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In December, 2006, [[Travelport]], owner of the [[Galileo CRS|Galileo GDS]], Gullivers Travel Associates (GTA) and a controlling share in [[Orbitz]], agreed to acquire Worldspan. However, at the time, management of Travelport did not commit to the eventual merging of the two GDS systems, saying that they were considering all options, including running both systems in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.btnmag.com/businesstravelnews/headlines/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003671960 Travelport Posts Strong Third-Quarter Growth, Despite Loss Of Expedia Business Worldspan global distribution system receives high ranking.]  ''Business Travel News Online'', November 13, 2007. Accessed November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On August 21, 2007, the acquisition was completed for $1.4 billion and Worldspan became a part of Travelport GDS, which also includes Galileo and other related businesses. On September 28, 2008, the Galileo and Apollo GDS were moved from the Travelport datacenter in Denver, Colorado to the Worldspan datacenter in Atlanta, Georgia (although they continue to be run as separate systems from the Worldspan GDS).

In 2012, Worldspan customers were migrated from the [[Transaction Processing Facility|TPF]]-based FareSource pricing engine to Travelport's [[Linux]]-based 360 Fares pricing engine already used by Galileo and Apollo.  Although the three systems share a common pricing platform, they continue to operate as separate GDS.

==History==
Worldspan was formed in early 1990 by  [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Northwest Airlines]], and [[TWA]] to operate and sell its GDS services to [[travel agencies]] worldwide. Worldspan operated very effectively and profitably, successfully expanding its business in markets throughout North America, South America, Europe, and Asia.  As a result, in mid-2003, Worldspan was sold by its owner airlines to Citigroup Venture Capital and Ontario Teachers' Pension Fund&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604003015/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/afx/2007/07/31/afx3969449.html EU set to clear Travelport buy of Worldspan.] ''[[Forbes]]'', July 31, 2007. Accessed November 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn sold the business to Travelport in 2007.

Worldspan was formed in 1990 by combining the PARS partnerships companies (owned by TWA and Northwest Airlines, Inc.) and DATAS II, a division of Delta Air Lines, Inc.  One of Worldspan’s predecessors – TWA PARS – became the first GDS to be installed in travel agencies in 1976. ABACUS, an Asian company owned by a number of Asian airlines, owned a small portion of Worldspan, and Worldspan owned a small portion of Abacus.  Worldspan and Abacus entered into a series of business and technology relationships.  These relationships were terminated after Abacus engaged in fraudulent and deceptive practices, for which Worldspan received a sizable judgement in an arbitration in London.
