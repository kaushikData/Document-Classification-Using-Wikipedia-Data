      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2447">In [[computational number theory]], the '''Adleman–Pomerance–Rumely primality test''' is an [[algorithm]] for determining whether a number is [[prime number|prime]]. Unlike other, more efficient algorithms for this purpose, it avoids the use of random numbers, so it is a [[deterministic algorithm|deterministic]] [[primality test]]. It is named after its discoverers, [[Leonard Adleman]], [[Carl Pomerance]], and [[Robert Rumely]]. The test involves arithmetic in [[cyclotomic field]]s.

It was later improved by [[Henri Cohen (number theorist)|Henri Cohen]] and [[Hendrik Willem Lenstra]], commonly referred to as APR-CL. It can test primality of an integer ''n'' in time:

: &lt;math&gt;(\ln n)^{O(\ln\,\ln\,\ln n)}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Software implementations ==
* [[UBASIC]] provides an implementation under the name APRT-CLE (APR Test CL extended)
*A [http://www.alpertron.com.ar/ECM.HTM factoring applet] that uses APR-CL on certain conditions (source code included)
*[http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/ Pari/GP] uses APR-CL conditionally in its implementation of isprime().
*[http://sourceforge.net/projects/mpzaprcl/ mpz_aprcl] is an open source implementation using C and GMP.
*[http://jpenne.free.fr/index2.html Jean Penné's LLR] uses APR-CL on certain types of prime tests as a fallback option.

The '''Alan Turing Year''', 2012, marked the celebration of the life and scientific influence of [[Alan Turing]]  during the centenary of his birth on 23 June 1912. Turing had an important influence on [[computing]], [[computer science]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[developmental biology]], and the mathematical [[theory of computability]] and made important contributions to code-breaking during the [[Second World War]]. The Alan Turing Centenary Advisory committee (TCAC) was originally set up by Professor Barry Cooper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/imitation-game-brings-to-life-the-real-alan-turing-pioneer-of-the-computer-age-32517|title=Imitation Game brings to life the real Alan Turing, pioneer of the computer age|first=S. Barry|last=Cooper|website=theconversation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international impact of Turing's work is reflected in the list of countries in which Alan Turing Year was celebrated, including: [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Canada]], [[China]], [[Czech Republic]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Mexico]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Philippines]], [[Portugal]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom|U.K.]] and the [[United States|U.S.A.]] 41+ countries were involved.

The '''horse paradox''' is a [[falsidical paradox]] that arises from flawed demonstrations, which purport to use [[mathematical induction]], of the statement ''All [[horse]]s are the same color''.  There is no actual contradiction, as these arguments have a crucial flaw that makes them incorrect. This example was originally raised by [[George Pólya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pólya |first=George |authorlink=George Pólya |date=1954 |title=Induction and Analogy in Mathematics}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paradox was also used by Joel E. Cohen as an example of the subtle errors that can occur in attempts to prove statements by induction.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=On the nature of mathematical proof|first=Joel E.|last=Cohen|year=1961|journal=Opus}}. Reprinted in ''A Random Walk in Science'' (R. L. Weber, ed.), Crane, Russak &amp; Co., 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The argument ==
The argument is [[proof by induction]]. First we establish a base case for one horse (&lt;math&gt;n=1&lt;/math&gt;). We then prove that if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses have the same color, then &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses must also have the same color.

===Base case: One horse===
The case with just one horse is trivial. If there is only one horse in the "group", then clearly all horses in that group have the same color.

===Inductive step===
Assume that &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses always are the same color. Let us consider a group consisting of &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses.

First, exclude the last horse and look only at the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses; all these are the same color since &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses always are the same color. Likewise, exclude the first horse and look only at the last &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses. By the same reasoning, these too, must also be of the same color. Therefore, the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle, who in turn are of the same color as the last horse. Hence the first horse, middle horses, and last horse are all of the same color, and we have proven that:
*If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; horses have the same color, then &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; horses will also have the same color.

Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction,  in any group of horses, all horses must be the same color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.hmc.edu/funfacts/ffiles/30002.8.shtml|title=All Horses are the Same Color|publisher=Harvey Mudd College Department of Mathematics|accessdate=6 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
{{unreferenced-section|date=August 2018}}
The argument above makes the implicit assumption that the two [[subset]]s of horses to which the induction assumption is applied have a common element. This is not true when the original set (prior to either removal) only contains two horses.

Let the two horses be horse A and horse B. When horse A is removed, it is true that the remaining horses in the set are the same color (only horse B remains). The same is true when horse B is removed. However the statement "the first horse in the group is of the same color as the horses in the middle" is meaningless, because there are no "horses in the middle" (common elements (horses) in the two sets). Therefore the above proof has a logical link broken. The proof forms a [[falsidical paradox]]; it seems to show by valid reasoning something that is manifestly false, but in fact the reasoning is flawed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11243">"'''As I was going to St Ives'''" is a traditional English-language [[nursery rhyme]] in the form of a [[riddle]]. Its [[Roud Folk Song Index]] number is 19772.

==Lyrics==
The most common modern version is:

: As I was going to St. Ives,
: I met a man with seven wives,
: Each wife had seven sacks,
: Each sack had seven cats,
: Each cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were there going to St. Ives?&lt;ref name=Opie1997&gt;I. Opie and P. Opie, ''The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes'' (Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), pp. 376–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The following version is found in a manuscript (Harley MS 7316) dating from approximately 1730:&lt;ref name="Opie1997"/&gt;  

: As I went to St. Ives
: I met Nine Wives
: And every  Wife had nine Sacs,
: And every Sac had nine Cats
: And every Cat had nine Kittens

A version very similar to that accepted today was published in the ''Weekly Magazine'' of August 4, 1779:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

: As I was going to St Ives,
: Upon the road I met seven wives;
: Every wife had seven sacks,
: Every sack had seven cats,
: Every cat had seven kits:
: Kits, cats, sacks, and wives,
: How many were going to St Ives?

The suggestion of [[polygamy]] (implicit in the line "I met a man with seven wives") is generally absent from the earliest publications, but is present by 1837.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |work=Chambers' Edinburgh Journal |date=1837-04-29 |issue=274 |page=112 |title=A Hoax Extraordinary |location=Edinburgh |publisher=Chambers |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015035107351?urlappend=%3Bseq=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of places called [[St Ives (disambiguation)|St Ives]] in England and elsewhere. It is generally thought
that the rhyme refers to [[St Ives, Cornwall]], when it was a busy fishing port and had many cats to stop the rats and mice destroying the fishing gear, although some people argue it was [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire]] as this is an ancient [[market town]] and therefore an equally plausible destination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Answers==

All potential answers to this riddle are based on its ambiguity because the riddle only tells us the group has been "met" on the journey to St. Ives and gives no further information about its intentions, only those of the narrator. In modern usage, 'to meet someone on the road' may include the sense of 'passed' or 'overtook'; while the older usage may have referred exclusively to those going in opposite directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Highway Code|page=9|publisher=The Stationery Office|date=1931}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the 'correct' answer could be stated as "at least one, the narrator plus anyone who happens to be travelling in the same direction as him or her".&lt;ref name="legend of St Ives"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Legend of St Yves|page=76|first=Bryan|last=Gibson|publisher=Waterside Press|date=April 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the group that the narrator meets is assumed ''not'' to be travelling to St. Ives the answer could be ''one'' person going to St. Ives: the narrator. This is the most common assumption,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; as the purpose of the riddle was most likely to trick the listener into making long winded calculations only to be surprised by the simplicity of the answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Number Theory and Its History|page=118|first=Oystein|last=Ore|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|date=1948}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If one disregards the 'trick' answer and assumes the narrator overtook the group as they were ''also'' travelling to St. Ives,&lt;ref name=Opie1997/&gt; the most common mathematical answer is 2802: 1 man, 7 wives, 49 sacks, 343 cats, and 2401 kits, plus the narrator (the sum of a [[geometric series#Formula|geometric series]], plus one).

After the riddle was published in the August 4, 1779 issue of ''The Weekly Magazine'', as described above, a subsequent edition of that journal contained the following solution, submitted by reader "Philo-Rhithmus" of Edinburgh:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Why the deuce do you give yourselves so much vexation,
: And puzzle your brains with a long calculation
: Of the number of cats, with their kittens and sacks,
: Which ''went'' to St Ives, on the old women's backs,
: As you seem to suppose?  {{--}} Don't you see that the cunning
: Old Querist ''went only''? {{--}} The rest were all ''coming''.
: But grant the wives ''went'' too, {{--}} as sure's they were married,

: ''Eight'' only could go, {{--}} for the rest were all ''carried''.

A similar problem is found in the [[Rhind Mathematical Papyrus]] (Problem 79), dated to around 1650 BC.

The problem appears to be an illustration of an [[algorithm]] for [[multiplication|multiplying]] numbers. The sequence 7, 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, 7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; appears in the right-hand column, and the terms 2,801, 2×2,801, 4×2,801 appear in the left; the sum on the left is 7×2,801 = 19,607, the same as the sum of the terms on the right. The equality of the two geometric sequences can be stated as the equation (2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)(7&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;) = 7&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;+7&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, which relies on the coincidence 2&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;+2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=7.

Note that the author of the papyrus listed a wrong value for the fourth power of 7; it should be 2,401, not 2,301. However, the sum of the powers (19,607) is correct.

The problem has been [[paraphrase]]d by modern commentators as a [[story problem]] involving houses, cats, mice, and grain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcript EPISODE 17 – RHIND MATHEMATICAL PAPYRUS|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/about/transcripts/episode17/|work=A history of the world|publisher=BBC|accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus there is no discussion beyond the bare outline stated above. The [[ancient Egyptian weights and measures#Volume|hekat]] was {{frac|1|30}} of a cubic [[cubit]] (approximately {{convert|4.8|l|lk=on|abbr=on|disp=or}}).

==In popular culture==
&lt;!-- If you are going to add items to this section PLEASE GIVE FULL DETAILS - (including years) and an in-line reference if at all possible - as otherwise it is very hard to substantiate the points later--&gt;

| It was parodied by [[Roald Dahl]] in his poetry book ''[[Rhyme Stew]]'' (1989): "As I was going to St Ives/ I met a man with seven wives/ he said: "I think it's much more fun/ than getting stuck with only one."
| In the [[1995 in film|1995 film]] ''[[Die Hard with a Vengeance]]'', the rhyme is presented to the protagonists by the villain as a riddle, giving them thirty seconds to telephone him on the number "555 plus the answer" or a bomb would detonate. The protagonists initially believe the answer to be 2401, only solving for the number of kits. However, they eventually solve the riddle, calling the number 555–0001 which proves to be correct. They missed the 30-second deadline, but the bomb did not explode since the villain had not said "[[Simon Says|Simon says]]."
| The rhyme was recited by [[Mary Murphy (actress)|Mary Murphy]]'s character while caring for a cat with seven kittens in the movie ''[[A Man Alone (film)|A Man Alone]]''. Later the character played by [[Ray Milland]] who overheard the rhyme offers her the answer and Murphy's character explains that she alone was going to St. Ives.
| The rhyme was also the basis of a ''[[Sesame Street]]'' Muppet skit from the show's first season, in which the boy Muppet holding a numeral 7 sings the rhyme as a song to the girl Muppet twice (the second time, the girl is busy writing down the calculations) and finally, in keeping true to the spirit of the riddle, reveals the answer as 1 (the traditional answer), because ''he'' was going to St. Ives and the kits, cats, sacks and wives were going the other way. Then the girl turns the tables on the boy and asks how many were going the other way.  She then reveals the mathematical answer from her calculations: 1 man + 7 wives + 49 sacks + 343 cats + 2,401 kittens, which comes to 2,801. Astonished, the boy responds, "How about that?!"
| ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine used it in at least two articles over the years for the following parodies:&lt;poem&gt;
As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
Of course, the seven wives weren't his
But here in France, that's how it is&lt;/poem&gt; and &lt;poem&gt;As I was going to St Ives
I met a man with seven wives
I know this sounds absurd and loony
But that poor man was [[Mickey Rooney]]!&lt;/poem&gt;
| In a post-Christmas ''[[Pogo (comic strip)|Pogo]]'' comic strip sequence from December 1957, Pogo Possum gives Albert Alligator a book with the poem and Albert immediately gets hopelessly entangled by the riddle. Pogo's proposed solution: "Gimme the book back an' I'll give you a pair of pants to go with the suspenders you got."
| In the sixth series of [[BBC]] radio comedy ''[[John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme]]'', the fourth episode features a sketch with a [[Cornishman]] arguing with another man on a train about whether he actually has seven wives, each of whom have sacks of cats with them, on the train with him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2535">In [[algebraic combinatorics]], a '''Bender–Knuth involution''' is an [[involution (mathematics)|involution]] on the set of [[semistandard tableau]]x, introduced by {{harvtxt|Bender|Knuth|1972|pp= 46–47}} in their study of [[plane partition]]s.

==Definition==
The Bender–Knuth involutions σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; are defined for integers ''k'', and act on the set of semistandard skew Young tableaux of some fixed shape μ/ν, where μ and ν are partitions. It acts by changing some of the elements ''k'' of the tableau to ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, and some of the entries ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 to ''k'', in such a way that the numbers of elements with values ''k'' or ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 are exchanged. Call an entry of the tableau '''free''' if it is ''k'' or ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 and there is no other element with value ''k'' or ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 in the same column. For any ''i'', the free entries of row ''i'' are all in consecutive columns, and consist of ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of ''k'' followed by ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, for some ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. The Bender–Knuth involution σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; replaces them by 
''b''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of ''k'' followed by ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; copies of ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

==Applications==
Bender–Knuth involutions can be used to show that the number of semistandard skew tableaux of given shape and weight is unchanged under permutations of the weight. In turn this implies that the [[Schur polynomial|Schur function]] of a partition is a symmetric function.

Bender–Knuth involutions were used by {{harvtxt|Stembridge|2002}} to give a short proof of the [[Littlewood–Richardson rule]].

In [[type theory]], '''bounded quantification''' (also '''bounded polymorphism''' or '''constrained genericity''') refers to [[universally quantified|universal]] or [[existential type|existential quantifier]]s which are restricted ("bounded") to range only over the subtypes of a particular type. Bounded quantification is an interaction of [[parametric polymorphism]] with [[subtyping]]. Bounded quantification has traditionally been studied in the [[functional programming|functional]] setting of [[System F-sub|System F&lt;sub&gt;&lt;:&lt;/sub&gt;]], but is available in modern [[object-oriented language]]s supporting [[parametric polymorphism]] ([[Generic programming|generics]]) such as [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] and [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]].

== Overview ==
The purpose of bounded quantification is to allow for [[polymorphic function]]s to depend on some specific behaviour of objects instead of [[type inheritance]]. It assumes a record-based model for object classes, where every class member is a record element and all class members are named functions. Object attributes are represented as functions that take no argument and return an object. The specific behaviour is then some function name along with the types of the arguments and the return type. Bounded quantification allows to considers all objects with such a function. An example would be a polymorphic &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt; function that considers all objects that are comparable to each other.

=== F-bounded quantification ===
'''''F''-bounded quantification''' or '''recursively bounded quantification''', introduced in 1989, allows for more precise typing of functions that are applied on recursive types. A recursive type is one that includes a function that uses it as a type for some argument or its return value.&lt;ref&gt;''F''-bounded polymorphism for object-oriented programming. Canning, [[William Cook (computer scientist)|Cook]], Hill, Olthof and [[John C. Mitchell|Mitchell]]. http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=99392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
This kind of type constraint can be expressed in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] with a generic interface. The following example demonstrates how to describe types that can be compared to each other and use this as typing information in [[polymorphic function]]s. The &lt;code&gt;Test.min&lt;/code&gt; function uses simple bounded quantification and does not preserve the type of the assigned types, in contrast with the &lt;code&gt;Test.Fmin&lt;/code&gt; function which uses F-bounded quantification.

In mathematical notation, the types of the two functions are

:min: ∀ T, ∀ S ⊆ {compareTo: T → int}. S → S → S
:Fmin: ∀ T ⊆ Comparable[T]. T → T → T

where

:Comparable[T] = {compareTo: T → int}

&lt;source lang="java"&gt;
interface Comparable&lt;T&gt; {
  public int compareTo(T other);
}

class Integer implements Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(Integer other) {
    //...
  }
}

class String implements Comparable&lt;String&gt; {
  @Override
  public int compareTo(String other) {
    //...
  }
}

class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Comparable&lt;String&gt; a = min("cat", "dog");
    Comparable&lt;Integer&gt; b = min(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
    String str = Fmin("cat", "dog");
    Integer i = Fmin(new Integer(10), new Integer(3));
  }
  public static &lt;S extends Comparable&gt; S min(S a, S b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
  public static &lt;T extends Comparable&lt;T&gt;&gt; T Fmin(T a, T b) {
    if (a.compareTo(b) &lt;= 0)
      return a;
    else
      return b;
  }
}

'''CIP-Tool''' ('''Communicating Interacting Processes''') is a [[software]] tool for the modelling and implementation of event-driven applications. It is especially relevant for the development of software components of [[embedded systems]].

==History==

The underlying mathematical formalisms of CIP were first proposed by the physicist, [[Prof. Dr. Hugo Fierz]]. The tool was subsequently developed at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (Zurich)]] in a series of research projects during the 1990s. Development and distribution has since been transferred to a commercially operating spin-off company, CIP-Tool, based in [[Solothurn]], Switzerland.

CIP Tool has been over taken by Actifsource GmbH in summer 2011. Actifsource has integrated the CIP Tool into the [[Actifsource]] workbench. 

==Methodology==

The CIP-model is basically a [[finite state machine]], or more precisely, an [[extended finite state machine]] (processes can store and modify variables and can use these to enable or disable transitions).

In CIP, a desired system behaviour is broken down into distinct ''processes'', each of which is a set of ''states'' interconnected by ''transitions''. One state in every process is tagged as ''active'' state. This active status can be transferred to another state through the execution of a transition. Such transitions are triggered by ''events'' (from external sources, e.g. sensors) or ''in-pulses'' (from other processes). Transitions can in turn send one or several ''out-pulses'' (to other processes) or ''actions'' (to external receivers, e.g. effectors).

The CIP-model is sometimes confused with [[petri nets]]. This may be because to beginners, the notation looks similar. The similarities should not be over-stressed, however. For example, CIP allows only (and exactly) one active state per process and processes are neither started nor terminated during run-time.

==Code generation==

CIP-Tool permits models to be automatically converted to executable code. This greatly facilitates testing, documentation and final implementation. Currently the languages [[C/C++]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] are supported as output formats.

[[William Rowan Hamilton]] invented [[quaternion]]s, a mathematical entity in 1843. This article describes Hamilton's original treatment of quaternions, using his notation and terms. Hamilton's treatment is more [[geometry|geometric]] than the modern approach, which emphasizes quaternions' [[algebra]]ic properties. Mathematically, quaternions discussed differ from the modern definition only by the terminology which is used.

==Classical elements of a quaternion==
Hamilton defined a quaternion as the [[quotient]] of two directed lines in tri[[dimension (vector space)|dimensional]] space;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg. 60|60}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more generally, as the quotient of two vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1881 pg. 32|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quaternion can be represented as the sum of a [[#Scalar|''scalar'']] and a [[#Vector|''vector'']]. It can also be represented as the product of its [[#Tensor|''tensor'']] and its [[#Versor|''versor'']].

===Scalar===
{{main|Scalar (mathematics)}}

Hamilton invented the term ''scalars'' for the [[real numbers]], because they span the "scale of progression from positive to negative infinity"&lt;ref&gt;
Hamilton, in the ''Philosophical magazine'', as cited in the ''OED''.&lt;/ref&gt; or because they represent the "comparison of positions upon one common scale".&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter II Article 17|10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton regarded ordinary scalar algebra as the science of pure time.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853, pg 2 paragraph 3 of introduction.  Refers to his early article "Algebra as the Science of pure time".|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vector===
{{see also|Vector space}}
Hamilton defined a vector as "a right line ... having not only length but also direction".&lt;ref name=1866b1a1&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamilton derived the word ''vector'' from the Latin [[wikt:vehere|''vehere'']], to carry.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853) Lecture I Article 15, introduction of term vector, from vehere|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton conceived a vector as the "difference of its two extreme points."&lt;ref name=1866b1a1/&gt; For Hamilton, a vector was always a three-dimensional entity, having three co-ordinates relative to any given co-ordinate system, including but not limited to both [[Polar coordinate system|polar]] and [[rectangular]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853) Lecture I Article 17 vector is natural triplet|1-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore referred to vectors as "triplets".

Hamilton defined addition of vectors in geometric terms, by placing the [[Euclidean vector#Representations|origin]] of the second vector at the end of the first.&lt;ref&gt;a{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to define vector subtraction.

By adding a vector to itself multiple times, he defined multiplication of a vector by an [[integer]], then extended this to division by an integer, and multiplication (and division) of a vector by a rational number. Finally, by taking limits, he defined the result of multiplying a vector α by any scalar ''x'' as a vector β with the same direction as α if ''x'' is positive; the opposite direction to α if ''x'' is negative; and a length that is |''x''| times the length of α.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter I Article 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[quotient]] of two [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] or anti-parallel vectors is therefore a scalar with absolute value equal to the ratio of the lengths of the two vectors; the scalar is positive if the vectors are parallel and negative if they are anti-parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1866) Book I Chapter II Article 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unit vector====
A [[unit vector]] is a vector of length one.  Examples of unit vectors include i, j and k.

===Tensor===

: Note: The use of the word ''tensor'' by Hamilton does not coincide with modern terminology. Hamilton's ''tensor'' is actually the [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] on the quaternion algebra, which makes it a [[normed vector space]].
Hamilton defined ''tensor'' as a positive numerical quantity, or, more properly, signless number.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 57|1-PA57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1881 pg 5|5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|CGZLAAAAMAAJ|Tait 1890 pg.31 explains Hamilton's older definition of a tensor as a positive number|31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A tensor can be thought of as a positive scalar.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1989 pg 165, refers to a tensor as a positive scalar.|165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "tensor" can be thought of as representing a "stretching factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Tait (1890), pg 32|31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hamilton introduced the term '''tensor''' in his first book, Lectures on Quaternions, based on lectures he gave shortly after his invention of the quaternions:
*''it seems convenient to enlarge by definition the signification of the new word tensor, so as to render it capable of including also those other cases in which we operate on a line by diminishing instead of increasing its length ; and generally by altering that length in any definite ratio. We shall thus (as was hinted at the end of the article in question) have fractional and even [[Commensurability (mathematics)|incommensurable]] tensors, which will simply be numerical multipliers, and will all be '''positive''' or (to speak more properly) '''SignLess Numbers''', that is, '''unclothed with the algebraic signs of positive and negative''' ; because, in the operation here considered, we abstract from the directions (as well as from the situations) of the lines which are compared or operated on.''

Each quaternion has a tensor, which is a measure of its magnitude (in the same way as the length of a vector is a measure of a vectors' magnitude). When a quaternion is defined as the quotient of two vectors, its tensor is the ratio of the lengths of these vectors.

===Versor===
{{main|versor}}
A versor is a quaternion with a tensor of 1. Alternatively, a versor can be defined as the quotient of two equal-length&lt;!-- non-zero? or Hamilton excluded zero vectors? --&gt; vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 8 pg 133 art 151 On the versor of a quaternion or a vector and some general formula of transformation|133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), art 156 pg 135, introduction of term versor|135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general a versor defines all of the following: a directional axis; the plane [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] to that axis; and an angle of rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Section 8 article 151 pg 133|133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a versor and a vector which lies in the plane of the versor are multiplied, the result is a new vector of the same length but turned by the angle of the versor.

====Vector arc====
Since every unit vector can be thought of as a point on a [[unit sphere]], and since a versor can be thought of as the quotient of two vectors, a versor has a representative [[great circle]] arc, called a '''vector arc''', connecting these two points, drawn from the divisor or lower part of quotient, to the dividend or upper part of the quotient.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 9 art 162 pg 142 Vector Arcs considered as representative of versors of quaternions|142}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Hardy (1881), art. 49 pg 71-72|71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Right versor====
When the arc of a versor has the magnitude of a [[right angle]], then it is called a '''right versor''', a ''right radial'' or ''quadrantal versor''.

====Degenerate forms====
Two special degenerate versor cases, called the unit-scalars&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Hamilton Elements of Quaternions Article 147 pg 130|130}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two scalars, negative and positive unity can be thought of as '''scalar quaternions'''. These two scalars are special limiting cases, corresponding to versors with angles of either zero or π.

Unlike other versors, these two cannot be represented by a unique arc. The arc of one is a single point, and minus one can be represented by an infinite number of arcs, because there are an infinite number of shortest lines between antipodal points of a sphere.

===Quaternion===
Every quaternion can be decomposed into a scalar and a vector.

: &lt;math&gt;q = \mathbf{S}(q) + \mathbf{V}(q)&lt;/math&gt;

These two operations S and V are called "take the Scalar of" and "take the vector of" a quaternion. The vector part of a quaternion is also called the right part.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Elements of Quaternions Section 13 starting on page 190|190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every quaternion is equal to a versor multiplied by the tensor of the quaternion. Denoting the versor of a quaternion by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{U}q&lt;/math&gt;

and the tensor of a quaternion by

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q&lt;/math&gt;

we have

: &lt;math&gt;q=\mathbf{T}q\mathbf{U}q&lt;/math&gt;

====Right quaternion====
A right quaternion is a quaternion whose scalar component is zero,

: &lt;math&gt;S(q) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The angle of a right quaternion is 90 degrees.  A right quaternion can also be thought of as a vector plus a zero scalar. Right quaternions may be put in what was called the standard trinomial form. For example, if Q is a right quaternion, it may be written as:

: &lt;math&gt;Q = xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Section 14 article 221 on page 233|233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four operations==
Four operations are of fundamental importance in quaternion notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 4|4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: + − ÷ ×
In particular it is important to understand that there is a single operation of multiplication, a single operation of division, and a single operations of addition and subtraction. This single multiplication operator can operate on any of the types of mathematical entities. Likewise every kind of entity  can be divided, added or subtracted from any other type of entity. Understanding the meaning of the subtraction symbol is critical in quaternion theory, because it leads to an understanding of the concept of a vector.

===Ordinal operators===
The two ordinal operations in classical quaternion notation were addition and subtraction or + and −.

These marks are:

"...characteristics of synthesis and analysis of a state of progression, according as this state is considered as being derived from, or compared with, some other state of that progression."&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 art 5 pg 4 -5|1-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subtraction====

Subtraction is a type of [[analysis]] called [[ordinal analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton pg 33|33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...let space be now regarded as the field of progression which is to be studied, and POINTS as ''states'' of that progression. ...I am led to regard the word "Minus," or the mark −, in geometry, as the sign or characteristic of analysis of one geometric position (in space), as compared with another (such) position. The comparison of one mathematical point with another with a view to the determination of what may be called their ordinal relation, or their relative position in space...&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 5-6|1-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first example of subtraction is to take the point A to represent the earth, and the point B to represent the sun, then an arrow drawn from A to B represents the act of moving or vection&lt;!-- ??? --&gt; from A to B.

::B − A

this represents the first example in Hamilton's lectures of a vector.  In this case the act of traveling from the earth to the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|see Hamilton 1853 pg 8-15|1-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 15 introduction of the term vector as the difference between two points.|15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Addition====
Addition is a type of analysis called ordinal synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg.19 Hamilton associates plus sign with ordinal synthesis|1-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Addition of vectors and scalars=====
Vectors and scalars can be added. When a vector is added to a scalar, a completely different entity, a quaternion is created.

A vector plus a scalar is always a quaternion even if the scalar is zero.  If the scalar added to the vector is zero then the new quaternion produced is called a right quaternion.  It has an angle characteristic of 90 degrees.

===Cardinal operations===
The two Cardinal operations&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1853), pg 35, Hamilton first introduces cardinal operations|1-35}}&lt;/ref&gt; in quaternion notation are geometric multiplication and geometric division and can be written:

: ÷, ×
It is not required to learn the following more advanced terms in order to use division and multiplication.

Division is a kind of [[analysis]] called cardinal analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1953 pg.36 Division defined as cardinal analysis|36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiplication is a kind of synthesis called cardinal synthesis&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg 37|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division====
Classically, the quaternion was viewed as the ratio of two vectors, sometimes called a geometric fraction.

If OA and OB represent two vectors drawn from the origin O to two other points A and B, then the geometric fraction was written as

: &lt;math&gt;OA:OB&lt;/math&gt;

Alternately if the two vectors are represented by α and β the quotient was written as

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha\div\beta&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Hamilton asserts: '''"The quotient of two vectors is generally a quaternion".'''&lt;ref&gt;{{
google  books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), Article 112 page 110|110}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Lectures on Quaternions'' also first introduces the concept of a quaternion as the quotient of two vectors:

Logically and by definition,&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 32|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on Quaternions page 37|37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=q&lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;{q}\times{\beta} = \alpha.&lt;/math&gt;.

In Hamilton's calculus the product is not [[commutative]], i.e., the order of the variables is of great importance. If the order of q and β were to be reversed the result would not in general be α. The quaternion q can be thought of as an operator that changes β into α, by first rotating it, formerly an act of [[rotation (mathematics)|''version'']] and then changing the length of it, formerly call an act of [[homothetic transformation|''tension'']].

Also by definition the quotient of two vectors is equal to the [[numerator]] times the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[denominator]]. Since multiplication of vectors is not commutative, the order cannot be changed in the following expression.

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}=\,{\alpha}\times\frac{1}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Again the order of the two quantities on the right hand side  is significant.

Hardy presents the definition of division in terms of mnemonic cancellation rules. "Canceling being performed by an upward right hand stroke".&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of quaternions|46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If alpha and beta are vectors and q is a quaternion such that

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta} = q &lt;/math&gt;

then &lt;math&gt;\alpha\beta^{-1}=q&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{\beta}.\beta = \alpha\beta^{-1}.\beta=\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|CGZLAAAAMAAJ|Tait Treaties on Quaternions|32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\div&lt;/math&gt; are inverse operations, such that:

: &lt;math&gt;\beta\div\alpha\times\alpha=\beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q\times\alpha\div\alpha=q&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures On Quaternions pg 38|38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

and

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma=(\gamma\div\beta)\times(\beta\div\alpha)\times\alpha&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on quaternions page 41|41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important way to think of q is as an operator that changes β into α, by first rotating it (''version'') and then changing its length (tension).

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma\div\alpha=(\gamma\div\beta)\times(\beta\div\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|PJIKAAAAYAAJ|Hamilton Lectures on quaternions pg 42|42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Division of the unit vectors ''i'', ''j'', ''k''====
The results of the using the division operator on i, j and k was as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ40|Hardy (1881), page 40-41|40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ij = k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{j}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;jk = i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{i}{k}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ki = j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{j}{i}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ji = -k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-k}{i}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;kj = -i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-i}{j}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;ik = -j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-j}{k}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;i(-j) = -k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-k}{-j}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;i(-k) = j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{j}{-k}=i&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;k(-i) = -j&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-j}{-i}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;k(-j) = i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{i}{-j}=k&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;j(-k) =-i&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{-i}{-k}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;j(-i) = k&lt;/math&gt; || style="padding-left:3em" | &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{-i}=j&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The reciprocal of a unit vector is the vector reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 45 formula 29|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{i} = i^{-1} = -i&lt;/math&gt;

Because a unit vector and its reciprocal are parallel to each other but point in opposite directions, the product of a unit vector and its reciprocal have a special case commutative property, for example if a is any unit vector then:&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 45 formula 30|45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{a}a = (-a)a = 1 = a(-a) = a\frac{1}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, in the more general case involving more than one vector (whether or not it is a unit vector) the commutative property does not hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy 1887 pg 46|46}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example:

::&lt;math&gt;i\frac{k}{i}&lt;/math&gt; ≠ &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} i.&lt;/math&gt;

This is because k/i is carefully defined as:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} = k\frac{1}{i} = ki^{-1} = k(-i) = -(ki) = -(j) = -j&lt;/math&gt;.

So that:

::&lt;math&gt;i\frac{k}{i} = i(-j) = -k&lt;/math&gt;,

however

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{i} i= (-j)i = -(ji) = -(-k) = k&lt;/math&gt;

====Division of two parallel vectors====
While in general the quotient of two vectors is a quaternion, If α and β are two parallel vectors then the quotient of these two vectors is a scalar. For example, if

&lt;math&gt;\alpha = ai&lt;/math&gt;,

and &lt;math&gt;\beta = bi&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha\div\beta = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} = \frac{ai}{bi} = \frac{a}{b}&lt;/math&gt;
Where a/b is a scalar.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of Quaternions, book one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Division of two non-parallel vectors=====
The quotient of two vectors is in general the quaternion:

: &lt;math&gt;q =\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;=\frac{T\alpha}{T\beta}(\cos\phi + \epsilon\sin\phi)&lt;/math&gt;

Where α and β are two non-parallel vectors, φ is that angle between them, and e is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the vectors α and β, with its direction given by the standard right hand rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 39 article 25|39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Multiplication====
Classical quaternion notation had only one concept of multiplication. Multiplication of two real numbers, two imaginary numbers or a real number by an imaginary number in the classical notation system was the same operation.

Multiplication of a scalar and a vector was accomplished with the same single multiplication operator; multiplication of two vectors of quaternions used this same operation as did multiplication of a quaternion and a vector or of two quaternions.

=====Factor, Faciend and Factum=====

::Factor × Faciend = Factum&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|TCwPAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1853 pg. 27 explains Factor Faciend and Factum|27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When two quantities are multiplied the first quantity is called the factor,&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 section 103|104}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second quantity is called the faciend and the result is called the factum.

=====Distributive=====
In classical notation, multiplication was [[distributive property|distributive]]. Understanding this makes it simple to see why the product of two vectors in classical notation produced a quaternion.

: &lt;math&gt;q=(ai + bj + ck)\times(ei + fj + gk)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;q = ae({i}\times{i}) + af({i}\times{j}) + ag({i}\times{k}) + be({j}\times{i}) + bf({j}\times{j}) + bg({j}\times{k}) + ce({k}\times{i}) + cf({k}\times{j}) + cg({k}\times{k})&lt;/math&gt;

Using the quaternion multiplication table we have:

: &lt;math&gt;q = ae(-1) + af(+k) + ag(-j) + be(-k) + bf(-1) + bg(+i) + ce(+j) + cf(-i) + cg(-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Then collecting terms:

: &lt;math&gt;q = -ae - bf - cg + (bg-cf)i + (ce - ag)j + (af-be)k&lt;/math&gt;

The first three terms are a scalar.

Letting

: &lt;math&gt;w = -ae - bf - cg&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;x = (bg-cf)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;y = (ce - ag)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;z = (af-be)&lt;/math&gt;

So that the product of two vectors is a quaternion, and can be written in the form:

: &lt;math&gt;q = w + xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;

=====Product of two right quaternions=====
The product of two right quaternions is generally a quaternion.

Let α and β be the right quaternions that result from taking the vectors of two quaternions:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha=\mathbf{V}p&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta=\mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

Their product in general is a new quaternion represented here by r. This product is not ambiguous because classical notation has only one product.

:&lt;math&gt;r =\,\alpha\beta;&lt;/math&gt;

Like all quaternions r may now be decomposed into its vector and scalar parts.

:&lt;math&gt;r=\mathbf{S}r+\mathbf{V}r&lt;/math&gt;

The terms on the right are called ''scalar of the product'', and the ''vector of the product''&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|Hardy (1887) scalar of the product vector of the product defined, pg |57}}&lt;/ref&gt; of two right quaternions.
: Note: "Scalar of the product" corresponds to Euclidean [[scalar product]] of two vectors up to the change of sign (multiplication to −1).

==Other operators in detail==

===Scalar and vector===
Two important operations in two the classical quaternion notation system were '''S'''(q) and '''V'''(q) which meant take the scalar part of, and take the imaginary part, what Hamilton called the vector part of the quaternion. Here S and V are operators acting on q. Parenthesis can be omitted in these kinds of expressions without ambiguity. Classical notation:

: &lt;math&gt;q =\,\mathbf{S}q + \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''q'' is a quaternion. '''''S'''q'' is the scalar of the quaternion while '''V'''q is the vector of the quaternion.

===Conjugate===
'''K''' is the conjugate operator. The conjugate of a quaternion is a quaternion obtained by multiplying the vector part of the first quaternion by minus one.

If

:&lt;math&gt;q =\,\mathbf{S}q + \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{K}q=\mathbf{S}\,q - \mathbf{V}q&lt;/math&gt;.

The expression

:&lt;math&gt;r=\,\mathbf{K}q&lt;/math&gt;,

means, assign the quaternion r the value of the conjugate of the quaternion q.

===Tensor===
'''T''' is the tensor operator. It returns a kind of number called a [[#Tensor|''tensor'']].

The tensor of a positive scalar is that scalar. The tensor of a negative scalar is the [[absolute value]] of the scalar (i.e., without the negative sign). For example:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(5) = 5 &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}(-5)= 5&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a vector is by definition the length of the vector. For example, if:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = xi + yj + zk&lt;/math&gt;

Then

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}\alpha = \sqrt{x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a unit vector is one.  Since the versor of a vector is a unit vector, the tensor of the versor of any vector is always equal to unity. Symbolically:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{TU}\alpha = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg164 Tensor of the versor of a vector is unity.|164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A quaternion is by definition the quotient of two vectors and the tensor of a quaternion is by definition the quotient of the tensors of these two vectors. In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;q = \frac{\alpha}{\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q = \frac{\mathbf{T}\alpha}{\mathbf{T}\beta}.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Elements of Quaternions, Ch. 11|162}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this definition it can be shown that a useful [[Euclidean norm|formula for the tensor of a quaternion]] is:&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 65|65}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q=\sqrt{w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be proven from this definition that another formula to obtain the tensor of a quaternion is from the common norm, defined as the product of a quaternion and its conjugate. The square root of the common norm of a quaternion is equal to its tensor.
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{T}q=\sqrt{qKq}&lt;/math&gt;

A useful identity is that the square of the tensor of a quaternion is equal to the tensor of the square of a quaternion, so that parenthesis may be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg 169 art 190 Tensor of the square is the square of the tensor|169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;(\mathbf{T}q)^2 = \mathbf{T}(q^2) = \mathbf{T}q^2&lt;/math&gt;

Also, the tensors of conjugate quaternions are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1898 pg 167 art. 187 equation 12 Tensors of conjugate quaternions are equal|167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{TK}q = \mathbf{T}q&lt;/math&gt;

The tensor of a quaternion is now called its [[norm (mathematics)|norm]].

===Axis and angle===
Taking the angle of a non-scalar quaternion, resulted in a value greater than zero and less than π.&lt;ref&gt;{{
cite web|url=http://dlxs2.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=math;cc=math;idno=05230001;node=05230001%3A4;frm=frameset;view=image;seq=304;page=root;size=S|title=Hamilton (1853), pg 164, art 148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 118|118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a non-scalar quaternion is viewed as the quotient of two vectors, then the axis of the quaternion is a unit vector perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors in this original quotient, in a direction specified by the right hand rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 118|117}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle is the angle between the two vectors.

In symbols,

: &lt;math&gt;u = Ax.q&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\theta = \angle q&lt;/math&gt;

===Reciprocal===

If

:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{\alpha}{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

then its [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] is defined as

&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{q}=q^{-1} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

The expression:

: &lt;math&gt;{q}\times{\alpha}\times\frac{1}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

Reciprocals have many important applications,&lt;ref&gt;
See Goldstein (1980) Chapter 7 for the same function written in matrix notation&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{

A versor has an easy formula for its reciprocal.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|YNE2AAAAMAAJ|Hardy (1881), pg 71|34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(\mathbf{U}q)}= \mathbf{S.U}q - \mathbf{V.U}q = \mathbf{K.U}q&lt;/math&gt;

In words the reciprocal of a versor is equal to its conjugate. The dots between operators show the order of the operations, and also help to indicate that S and U for example, are two different operations rather than a single operation named SU.

===Common norm===
The product of a quaternion with its conjugate is its common norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton (1899), pg 128 -129|128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of taking the common norm of a quaternion is represented with the letter '''N'''. By definition the common norm is the product of a quaternion with its conjugate. It can be proven&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See foot note at bottom of page, were word proven is highlighted.|129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{
google  books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Hamilton 1898 pg. 169 art. 190 for proof of relationship between tensor and common norm|169}}&lt;/ref&gt; that common norm is equal to the square of the tensor of a quaternion. However this proof does not constitute a definition. Hamilton gives exact, independent definitions of both the common norm and the tensor. This norm was adopted as suggested from the theory of numbers, however to quote Hamilton "they will not often be wanted". The tensor is generally of greater utility. The word '''norm''' does not appear in ''Lectures on Quaternions'', and only twice in the table of contents of ''Elements of Quaternions''.

In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{N}q=\,q\mathbf{K}q =\,(\mathbf{T}q)^2&lt;/math&gt;

The common norm of a versor is always equal to positive unity.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton 1899 pg 138|138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{NU}q = \mathbf{U}q.\mathbf{KU}q = 1&lt;/math&gt;

==Biquaternions==

===Geometrically real and geometrically imaginary numbers===
In classical quaternion literature the equation

: &lt;math&gt;q^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;

was thought to have infinitely many solutions that were called '''geometrically real'''.
These solutions are the unit vectors that form the surface of a unit sphere.

A '''geometrically real''' quaternion is one that can be written as a linear combination of ''i'', ''j'' and ''k'', such that the squares of the [[coefficient]]s add up to one. Hamilton demonstrated that there had to be additional roots of this equation in addition to the geometrically real roots. Given the existence of the imaginary scalar, a number of expressions can be written and given proper names. All of these were part of Hamilton's original quaternion calculus. In symbols:

: &lt;math&gt;q + q'\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

where q and q′ are real quaternions, and the square root of minus one is the [[imaginary unit|imaginary of ordinary algebra]], and are called an '''imaginary or symbolical roots'''&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See Elements of Quaternions Articles 256 and 257|275}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not a geometrically real vector quantity.

===Imaginary scalar===
'''Geometrically Imaginary''' quantities are additional roots of the above equation of a purely symbolic nature. In article 214 of ''Elements'' Hamilton proves that if there is an i, j and k there also has to be another quantity h which is an imaginary scalar, which he observes should have already occurred to anyone who had read the preceding articles with attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements article 214 infamous remark...as would already have occurred to anyone who had read the preceding articles with attention|218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 149 of ''Elements'' is about Geometrically Imaginary numbers and includes a footnote introducing the term ''biquaternion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Elements of Quaternions Article 149|131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''imaginary of ordinary algebra'' and ''scalar imaginary'' are sometimes used for these geometrically imaginary quantities.

''Geometrically Imaginary'' roots to an equation were interpreted in classical thinking as geometrically impossible situations. Article 214 of elements of quaternions explores the example of the equation of a line and a circle that do not intersect, as being indicated by the equation having only a geometrically imaginary root.&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|See elements of quaternions article 214|217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hamilton's later writings he proposed using the letter h to denote the imaginary scalar&lt;ref&gt;{{
google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements of Quaternions pg 276 Example of h notation for imaginary scalar|276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{

google books|fIRAAAAAIAAJ|Hamilton Elements article 274 pg. 300 Example of h denoting imaginary of ordinary algebra|300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biquaternion===
{{main|Biquaternion}}
On page 665 of ''Elements of Quaternions'' Hamilton defines a biquaternion to be a quaternion with [[complex number]] coefficients. The scalar part of a biquaternion is then a complex number called a '''biscalar'''. The vector part of a biquaternion is a [[bivector (complex)|bivector]] consisting of three complex components. The biquaternions are then the [[complexification]] of the original (real) quaternions.

===Other double quaternions===
Hamilton invented the term ''associative'' to distinguish between the imaginary scalar (known by now as a [[complex number]]) which is both commutative and associative, and four other possible roots of negative unity which he designated L, M, N and O, mentioning them briefly in appendix B of ''Lectures on Quaternions'' and in private letters. However, non-associative roots of minus one do not appear in ''Elements of Quaternions''. Hamilton died before he worked{{clarify|date=February 2012}}&lt;!-- the author is a medium, eh? --&gt; on these strange entities. His son claimed it to be a "bow for another Ulysses".&lt;ref&gt;{{

[[File:Opamp105.gif|thumb]]
In [[electronics]], a '''comparator''' is a device that compares two [[voltage]]s or [[Electric current|currents]] and outputs a digital signal indicating which is larger.  It has two analog input terminals &lt;math&gt;V_+\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_-\,&lt;/math&gt; and one binary digital output &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm o}\,&lt;/math&gt;.  The output is ideally 
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\rm o} = 
\begin{cases} 
1,  &amp; \mbox{if }V_+ &gt; V_-  \\
0,  &amp; \mbox{if }V_+ &lt; V_- 
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
A comparator consists of a specialized high-[[gain (electronics)|gain]] [[differential amplifier]].  They are commonly used in devices that measure and digitize analog signals, such as [[analog-to-digital converter]]s{{clarify|a comparator could be considered a simple ADC, right?|date=May 2017}} (ADCs), as well as [[relaxation oscillator]]s.

== Differential voltage ==

The differential voltages must stay within the limits specified by the manufacturer. Early integrated comparators, like the LM111 family, and certain high-speed comparators like the LM119 family, require differential voltage ranges substantially lower than the power supply voltages (±15&amp;nbsp;V vs. 36&amp;nbsp;V).&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm111.pdf LM111/LM211/LM311 datasheet]. Texas Instruments. August 2003. Retrieved 2014-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rail-to-rail'' comparators allow any differential voltages within the power supply range. When powered from a bipolar (dual rail) supply, 
 
:&lt;math&gt;V_{S-} \le V_+,V_- \le V_{S+}&lt;/math&gt;

or, when powered from a unipolar [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]]/[[CMOS]] power supply:

:&lt;math&gt;0 \le V_+,V_- \le V_{\rm cc}&lt;/math&gt;

Specific rail-to-rail comparators with [[Bipolar junction transistor#PNP|p-n-p]] input transistors, like the LM139 family, allow the input potential to drop 0.3&amp;nbsp;volts ''below'' the negative supply rail, but do not allow it to rise above the positive rail.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm139.pdf LM139/LM239/LM339/LM2901/LM3302 datasheet]. Texas Instruments. August 2012. Retrieved 2014-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Specific ultra-fast comparators, like the LMH7322, allow input signal to swing below the negative rail ''and'' above the positive rail, although by a narrow margin of only 0.2&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lmh7322.pdf LMH7322 datasheet]. Texas Instruments. March 2013. Retrieved 2014-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt; Differential input voltage (the voltage between two inputs) of a modern rail-to-rail comparator is usually limited only by the full swing of power supply.

==Op-amp voltage comparator==

[[image:Op-Amp Comparator.svg|frame|right|A simple op-amp comparator]]
An [[operational amplifier]] (op-amp) has a well balanced difference input and a very high [[gain (electronics)|gain]]. This parallels the characteristics of comparators and can be substituted in applications with low-performance requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, {{ISBN|0-8053-6917-1}}, Chapter 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

A comparator circuit compares two voltages and outputs either a 1 (the voltage at the plus side; VDD in the illustration) or a 0 (the voltage at the negative side) to indicate which is larger. Comparators are often used, for example, to check whether an input has reached some predetermined value. In most cases a comparator is implemented using a dedicated comparator IC, but op-amps may be used as an alternative. Comparator diagrams and op-amp diagrams use the same symbols.

Figure 4 shows a comparator circuit. Note first that the circuit does not use feedback. The circuit amplifies the voltage difference between Vin and VREF, and outputs the result at Vout. If Vin is greater than VREF, then voltage at Vout will rise to its positive saturation level; that is, to the voltage at the positive side. If Vin is lower than VREF, then Vout, will fall to its negative saturation level, equal to the voltage at the negative side.

In practice, this circuit can be improved by incorporating a hysteresis voltage range to reduce its sensitivity to noise. The circuit shown in Fig. 5, for example, will provide stable operation even when the Vin signal is somewhat noisy.

In practice, using an [[operational amplifier]] as a comparator presents several disadvantages as compared to using a dedicated comparator:&lt;ref&gt;Ron Mancini, "[http://www.edn.com/design/analog/4353925/Designing-with-comparators Designing with comparators]," EDN, March 29, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Op-amps are designed to operate in the linear mode with negative feedback. Hence, an op-amp typically has a lengthy recovery time from saturation. Almost all op-amps have an internal compensation capacitor which imposes [[slew rate]] limitations for high frequency signals. Consequently, an op-amp makes a sloppy comparator with [[propagation delay]]s that can be as long as tens of microseconds.
# Since op-amps do not have any internal hysteresis, an external hysteresis network is always necessary for slow moving input signals.
# The quiescent current specification of an op-amp is valid only when the feedback is active. Some op-amps show an increased quiescent current when the inputs are not equal.
# A comparator is designed to produce well limited output voltages that easily interface with digital logic. Compatibility with digital logic must be verified while using an op-amp as a comparator.
# Some multiple-section op-amps may exhibit extreme channel-channel interaction when used as comparators.
# Many op-amps have back to back diodes between their inputs. Op-amp inputs usually follow each other so this is fine. But comparator inputs are not usually the same. The diodes can cause unexpected current through inputs.

== Working ==


A dedicated voltage comparator will generally be faster than a general-purpose operational amplifier pressed into service as a comparator. A dedicated voltage comparator may also contain additional features such as an accurate, internal voltage reference, an adjustable [[hysteresis]] and a clock gated input.

A dedicated voltage comparator chip such as LM339 is designed to interface with a digital logic interface (to a [[Transistor-transistor logic|TTL]] or a [[CMOS]]). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see [[analog to digital converter]]). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just the equivalent of a cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly [[Bipolar transistor]]s. For very high frequencies, the input [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large [[P-n junction|P-N junction]] bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small [[Schottky diode]]s, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in [[flash ADC]]s the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.

The LM339 accomplishes this with an [[open collector]] output. When the inverting input is at a higher voltage than the non inverting input, the output of the comparator connects to the negative power supply. When the non inverting input is higher than the inverting input, the output is 'floating' (has a very high impedance to ground).
The gain of op amp as comparator is given by this equation
V(out)=V(in)

==Key specifications==

While it is easy to understand the basic task of a comparator, that is, comparing two voltages or currents, several parameters must be considered while selecting a suitable comparator:

===Speed and power===

While in general comparators are "fast," their circuits are not immune to the classic speed-power tradeoff. High speed comparators use transistors with larger aspect ratios and hence also consume more power.&lt;ref&gt;Rogenmoser, R.; Kaeslin, H, "The impact of transistor sizing on power efficiency in submicron CMOS circuits," Solid-State Circuits, IEEE Journal of Volume 32, Issue 7, Jul 1997 Page(s):1142–1145.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the application, select either a comparator with high speed or one that saves power. For example, nano-powered comparators in space-saving chip-scale packages (UCSP), DFN or SC70 packages such as [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/4268 MAX9027], [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515060645/http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1002,C1463,P1593 LTC1540], [https://web.archive.org/web/20090503133424/http://www.national.com/pf/LP/LPV7215.html LPV7215], [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/5823 MAX9060] and [http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en010414 MCP6541] are ideal for ultra-low-power, portable applications. Likewise if a comparator is needed to implement a relaxation oscillator circuit to create a high speed clock signal then comparators having few nano seconds of propagation delay may be suitable. [http://www.analog.com/en/amplifiers-and-comparators/comparators/adcmp572/products/product.html ADCMP572] (CML output), [http://www.ti.com/product/lmh7220 LMH7220] (LVDS Output), [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1481 MAX999] (CMOS output / TTL output), [https://archive.is/20130127214618/http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1004,C1012,P1817 LT1719] (CMOS output / TTL output), [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2490/t/al MAX9010] (TTL output), and [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/3400/t/al MAX9601] (PECL output) are examples of some good high speed comparators.

=== Hysteresis ===

A comparator normally changes its output state when the voltage between its inputs crosses through approximately zero volts. Small voltage fluctuations due to noise, always present on the inputs, can cause undesirable rapid changes between the two output states when the input voltage difference is near zero volts. To prevent this output oscillation, a small [[hysteresis]] of a few millivolts is integrated into many modern comparators.&lt;ref&gt;Ron Mancini, "[http://www.edn.com/article/CA84881.html Adding Hysteresis to comparators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221054157/http://edn.com/article/CA84881.html |date=2005-02-21 }}," EDN, May 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; 
For example, the [http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1004,C1012,P38930 LTC6702], [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2411/t/al MAX9021] and [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2363/t/al MAX9031] have internal hysteresis desensitizing them from input noise. In place of one switching point, hysteresis introduces two: one for rising voltages, and one for falling voltages. The difference between the higher-level trip value (VTRIP+) and the lower-level trip value (VTRIP-) equals the hysteresis voltage (VHYST).

If the comparator does not have internal hysteresis or if the input noise is greater than the internal hysteresis then an external hysteresis network can be built using positive feedback from the output to the non-inverting input of the comparator. The resulting [[Schmitt trigger]] circuit gives additional noise immunity and a cleaner output signal. Some comparators such as [https://web.archive.org/web/20090503133351/http://www.national.com/pf/LM/LMP7300.html LMP7300], [http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1004,C1013,P1593 LTC1540], [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1219 MAX931], [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1279/t/al MAX971] and [http://www.analog.com/en/power-management/battery-management/adcmp341/products/product.html ADCMP341] also provide the hysteresis control through a separate hysteresis pin. These comparators make it possible to add a programmable hysteresis without feedback or complicated equations. Using a dedicated hysteresis pin is also convenient if the source impedance is high since the inputs are isolated from the hysteresis network.&lt;ref&gt;AN3616, Maxim Integrated Products, [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/886/ Adding Extra Hysteresis to Comparators].&lt;/ref&gt; When hysteresis is added then a comparator cannot resolve signals within the hysteresis band.

===Output type===
[[File:Dynamic Comparator.png|thumb|right|350px|A Low Power CMOS Clocked Comparator]]

Because comparators have only two output states, their outputs are near zero or near the supply voltage. Bipolar rail-to-rail comparators have a common-emitter output that produces a small voltage drop between the output and each rail. That drop is equal to the collector-to-emitter voltage of a saturated transistor. When output currents are light, output voltages of CMOS rail-to-rail comparators, which rely on a saturated MOSFET, range closer to the rails than their bipolar counterparts.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;AN886, Maxim Integrated Products, [http://www.maxim-ic.com/appnotes.cfm/an_pk/886/ Selecting the Right Comparator].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of outputs, comparators can also be classified as [[open drain]] or [[push–pull output|push–pull]]. Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators are more suitable for mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators can also be used to connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. Push pull output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.

===Internal reference===

The most frequent application for comparators is the comparison between a voltage and a stable reference. Most comparator manufacturers also offer comparators in which a reference voltage is integrated on to the chip. Combining the reference and comparator in one chip not only saves space, but also draws less supply current than a comparator with an external reference.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; ICs with wide range of references are available such as [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/5823/t/al MAX9062] (200 mV reference), [http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515060838/http://www.linear.com/pc/productDetail.jsp?navId=H0,C1,C1154,C1004,C1013,P2340 LT6700] (400 mV reference), [http://www.analog.com/en/power-management/battery-management/adcmp350/products/product.html ADCMP350] (600&amp;nbsp;mV reference), [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/4268/t/al MAX9025] (1.236&amp;nbsp;V reference), [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/2122/t/al MAX9040] (2.048&amp;nbsp;V reference), [http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlv3012.html TLV3012] (1.24&amp;nbsp;V reference) and [http://www.datasheetcatalog.org/datasheet/stmicroelectronics/9208.pdf TSM109] (2.5&amp;nbsp;V reference).

===Continuous versus clocked===

A continuous comparator will output either a "1" or a "0" any time a high or low signal is applied to its input and will change quickly when the inputs are updated.  However, many applications only require comparator outputs at certain instances, such as in A/D converters and memory. By only strobing a comparator at certain intervals, higher accuracy and lower power can be achieved with a clocked (or dynamic) comparator structure, also called a latched comparator. Often latched comparators employ strong positive feedback for a "regeneration phase" when a clock is high, and have a "reset phase" when the clock is low.&lt;ref&gt;

This is in contrast to a continuous comparator, which can only employ weak positive feedback since there is no reset period.

== Applications ==
{{main|Comparator applications}}

=== Null detectors ===

A null detector is one that functions to identify when a given value is zero. Comparators can be a type of amplifier distinctively for null comparison measurements. It is the equivalent to a very high gain amplifier with well-balanced inputs and controlled output limits. The circuit compares the two input voltages, determining the larger. The inputs are an unknown voltage and a reference voltage, usually referred to as v&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; and v&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;. A reference voltage is generally on the non-inverting input (+), while v&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; is usually on the inverting input (&amp;minus;). (A circuit diagram would display the inputs according to their sign with respect to the output when a particular input is greater than the other.)  The output is either positive or negative, for example ±12&amp;nbsp;V. In this case, the idea is to detect when there is no difference between in the input voltages. This gives the identity of the unknown voltage since the reference voltage is known.

When using a comparator as a null detector, there are limits as to the accuracy of the zero value measurable. Zero output is given when the magnitude of the difference in the voltages multiplied by the gain of the amplifier is less than the voltage limits. For example, if the gain of the amplifier is 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, and the voltage limits are ±6&amp;nbsp;V, then no output will be given if the difference in the voltages is less than 6&amp;nbsp;μV. One could refer to this as a sort of uncertainty in the measurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists |last1=Malmstadt |first1=Howard V. |last2=Enke |first2=Christie G. |last3=Crouch |first3=Stanley R. |publisher=The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co |date=January 1981  |isbn=0-8053-6917-1 |pages=108–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Zero-crossing detectors ===

For this type of detector, a comparator detects each time an [[Alternating Current|ac]] pulse changes polarity. The output of the comparator changes state each time the pulse changes its polarity, that is the output is HI (high) for a positive pulse and LO (low) for a negative pulse squares the input signal.&lt;ref&gt;''Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists.''  Malmstadt, Enke, and Crouch, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Co., In., 1981, p.230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relaxation oscillator===

A comparator can be used to build a [[relaxation oscillator]]. It uses both positive and negative feedback. The positive feedback is a [[Schmitt trigger]] configuration. Alone, the trigger is a [[bistable multivibrator]]. However, the slow [[negative feedback]] added to the trigger by the RC circuit causes the circuit to oscillate automatically. That is, the addition of the RC circuit turns the hysteretic bistable [[multivibrator]] into an [[astable multivibrator]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horowitz and Winfield Hill: ''The Art of Electronics'',
Cambridge University Press, Second edition, Cambridge 1989, pp.284–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Level shifter===
[[File:DOV-1X - National Semiconductor LM393N on printed circuit board-9800.jpg|thumb|National Semiconductor LM393]]
This circuit requires only a single comparator with an open-drain output as in the [http://www.ti.com/product/lm393 LM393], [http://focus.ti.com/docs/prod/folders/print/tlv3011.html TLV3011] or [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/4268/t/al MAX9028]. The circuit provides great flexibility in choosing the voltages to be translated by using a suitable pull up voltage. It also allows the translation of bipolar ±5&amp;nbsp;V logic to unipolar 3&amp;nbsp;V logic by using a comparator like the [http://www.maxim-ic.com/quick_view2.cfm/qv_pk/1279 MAX972].&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

===Analog-to-digital converters===

When a comparator performs the function of telling if an input voltage is above or below a given threshold, it is essentially performing a 1-bit [[Quantization (signal processing)|quantization]]. This function is used in nearly all analog to digital converters (such as [[Flash ADC|flash]], pipeline, [[Successive approximation ADC|successive approximation]], [[delta-sigma modulation]], folding, interpolating, [[Integrating ADC|dual-slope]] and others) in combination with other devices to achieve a multi-bit quantization.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Allen and Douglas Holberg: ''CMOS Analog Circuit Design'',
Oxford University Press, Second edition, Oxford 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Window detectors===

Comparators can also be used as window detectors. In a [[window detector]], a comparator is used to compare two voltages and determine whether a given input voltage is under voltage or over voltage.

===Absolute value detectors===

Comparators can be used to create absolute value detectors. In an absolute value detector, two comparators and a digital logic gate are used to compare the absolute values of two voltages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7604807/ |title=Iranmanesh, S., Rodriguez-Villegas, E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5815">'''Digital topology''' deals with properties and features of [[two-dimensional]] (2D) or [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] (3D) [[digital images]]
that correspond to [[Topology|topological]] properties (e.g., [[connectedness]]) or topological features (e.g., [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]]) of objects.

Concepts and results of digital topology are used to specify and justify important (low-level) [[image analysis]] algorithms, 
including algorithms for [[Thinning (morphology)|thinning]], border or surface tracing, counting of components or tunnels, or region-filling.

== History ==
Digital topology was first studied in the late 1960s by the [[computer image analysis]] researcher [[Azriel Rosenfeld]] (1931&amp;ndash;2004), whose publications on the subject played a major role in establishing and developing the field. The term "digital topology" was itself invented by Rosenfeld, who used it in a 1973 publication for the first time.

A related work called the [[grid cell topology]] appeared in Alexandrov-Hopf's book Topologie I (1935) can be considered as a link to classic [[combinatorial topology]].  Rosenfeld ''et al.'' proposed digital connectivity such as 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity in two dimensions as well as 6-connectivity and 26-connectivity in three dimensions. The labeling method for inferring a connected component was studied in the 1970s.  T. Pavlidis (1982) suggested the use of graph-theoretic algorithms such as the [[depth-first search]] method for finding connected components. V. Kovalevsky (1989) extended Alexandrov-Hopf's 2D grid cell topology to three and higher dimensions.   He also proposed (2008) a more general axiomatic theory of [[Locally finite collection|locally finite topological spaces]] and [[abstract cell complexes]] formerly suggested by Steinitz (1908). It is the [[Alexandrov topology]]. The book of 2008 contains new definitions of topological balls and spheres independent of a metric and numerous applications to digital image analysis.

In the early 1980s, [[digital surface]]s were studied. Morgenthaler and Rosenfeld (1981) gave a mathematical definition of surfaces in three-dimensional digital space. This definition contains a total of nine types of digital surfaces. The [[digital manifold]] was studied in the 1990s. A recursive definition of the digital k-manifold was proposed intuitively by Chen and Zhang in 1993. Many applications were found in image processing and computer vision.

== Basic results ==
A basic (early) result in digital topology says that 2D binary images require the alternative use of 4- or 8-adjacency or "[[pixel connectivity]]" (for "object" or "non-object"
[[pixels]]) to ensure the basic topological duality of separation and connectedness. This alternative use corresponds to open or closed
sets in the 2D [[grid cell topology]], and the result generalizes to 3D: the alternative use of 6- or 26-adjacency corresponds
to open or closed sets in the 3D [[grid cell topology]]. Grid cell topology also applies to multilevel (e.g., color) 2D or 3D images,
for example based on a total order of possible image values and applying a 'maximum-label rule' (see book by Klette and Rosenfeld, 2004).

Digital topology is highly related to [[combinatorial topology]]. The main differences between them are: (1) digital topology mainly studies digital objects that are formed by grid cells,{{clarify|reason=How does that differ?|date=October 2011}} and (2) digital topology also deals with non-Jordan manifolds.

A combinatorial manifold is a kind of manifold which is discretization of a manifold. It usually means a [[piecewise linear manifold]] made by [[simplicial complexes]]. A [[digital manifold]] is a special kind of combinatorial manifold which is defined in digital space i.e. grid cell space.

A digital form of the [[Gauss–Bonnet theorem]] is:  Let ''M'' be a closed digital 2D [[manifold]] in direct adjacency (i.e. a (6,26)-surface in 3D). 
The formula for genus is
: &lt;math&gt; g = 1 + (M_{5} + 2 M_{6} - M_{3}) / 8 ,\! &lt;/math&gt;
where ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; indicates the set of surface-points each of which has ''i'' adjacent points on the surface (Chen and Rong, ICPR 2008).
If ''M'' is simply connected, i.e. ''g''&amp;nbsp;= 0, then ''M''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;= 8&amp;nbsp;+ ''M''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ 2''M''&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. (See also [[Euler characteristic]].)

[[File:Ehud Hrushovski.jpg|thumb|220px|Ehud Hrushovski]]
'''Ehud Hrushovski''' ({{lang-he|אהוד הרושובסקי}}; born 1959) is a mathematical logician. He is a Merton Professor of Mathematical Logic  at the [[University of Oxford]] and a Fellows  [[Merton College]], [[Oxford]]. He is also Professor of Mathematics at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].


==Early life and education==
Hrushovski's father, Benjamin Harshav (Hebrew: [[בנימין הרשב]], né Hruszowski; 1928-2015),&lt;ref&gt;Archives, [[Ghetto Fighters' House]]&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[literary theorist]], a Yiddish and Hebrew [[poet]] and a translator, [[Professor]] at [[Yale University]] and [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[comparative literature]]. Ehud Hrushovski earned his PhD from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986 under [[Leo Harrington]]. He was Professor of Mathematics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] until 1998 before he went to Jerusalem.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

==Career==
Hrushovski is well known for several fundamental contributions to [[model theory]], in particular in the branch that has become known as [[geometric model theory]], and its applications.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} His PhD thesis revolutionized stable model theory (a part of model theory arising from the stability theory introduced by [[Saharon Shelah]]). Shortly afterwards he found counterexamples to the [[Trichotomy Conjecture]] of [[Boris Zilber]] and his method of proof has become well known as Hrushovski constructions and found many other applications since.

One of his most famous results  is his proof of the geometric [[Mordell–Lang conjecture]] in all characteristics using model theory in 1996. This deep proof was a landmark in logic and geometry. He has had many other famous and notable results in model theory and its applications to geometry, algebra, and combinatorics.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Hrushovski is a fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (2007), and [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]] (2008). He is a recipient of the [[Erdős Prize]] of 
the Israel Mathematical Union in 1994, the Rothschild Prize in 1998, the Carol Karp Prize of the Association of Symbolic Logic in 1993 (jointly with Alex Wilkie), and the Carol Karp Prize in 1998. He was a Plenary speaker of the ICM in 1998.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

'''F. D. C. Willard''' (ca. 1968&amp;ndash;1982) was the pen name of a [[Siamese cat]] named Chester, who internationally published under this name on [[physics]] in scientific journals, once as a [[co-author]] and another time as the sole author.

==Background==
The [[United States|American]] physicist and mathematician Jack H. Hetherington, of [[Michigan State University]], in 1975 wanted to publish some of his research results in the field of low–temperature physics in the scientific journal ''[[Physical Review|Physical Review Letters]]''. A colleague, to whom he had given his paper for review, pointed out that Hetherington had used the [[Nosism|first person plural]] in his text, and that the journal would reject this form on submissions with a sole author. Rather than take the time to retype the article to use the singular form, or to bring in a co-author, Hetherington decided to invent one.&lt;ref name=Zankl&gt;{{cite|author=Heinrich Zankl|chapter=Einsteins preußischer Schatten und Hetheringtons Kater [Einstein's Prussian shadow and Hetherington's cat]|language=German|editors=Von Dunkelbirnen und Leuchtkaninchen|title=Erlebnis Wissenschaft|publisher=WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.|location=Weinheim|year=2008|isbn=978-3-527-32114-8|chapter-url=http://www.wiley-vch.de/books/sample/3527321144_c01.pdf|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hetherington had a Siamese cat named Chester, who had been sired by a Siamese named Willard. Fearing that colleagues might recognize his pet's name, he thought it better to use the pet's initial. Aware that most Americans have at least two given names, he invented two more given names based on the [[scientific name]] for a [[house cat]], ''Felis domesticus'', and abbreviated them accordingly as F. D. C. His article, entitled "Two-, Three-, and Four-Atom Exchange Effects in bcc ³He" and written by J. H. Hetherington and F. D. C. Willard, was accepted by the Physical Review and published in number 35 (November 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|authors=J. H. Hetherington and F. D. C.

''In 1975, a Cat Co-Authored a Physics Paper'' (Atlas Obscura; 30 August 2016)]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 15th International Conference on Low Temperature Physics in 1978 in [[Grenoble]], Hetherington's co-author was exposed: Hetherington had  sent some signed copies of his article to friends and colleagues and included the "signature" (paw prints) of his co-author in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.L.

D. C. Willard, entitled "L'hélium 3 solide. Un antiferromagnétique nucléaire", published (in French) in September 1980 in the French popular science magazine ''[[La Recherche]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|authors=F. D. C.

Un antiferromagnétique nucléaire|journal=La Recherche|volume=114|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AO/&gt; Subsequently, Willard disappeared as an author from the professional world.

==Reception==
The unmasking of Hetherington's co-author on the ''Physical Review'' essay, which was frequently referenced,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|author=Beispiel|title=Journal of the Physical Society of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused the co-authorship to become world-famous. The story goes that when inquiries were made to Hetherington's office at Michigan State University, and Hetherington was absent, the callers would ask to speak to the co-author instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.academiaobscura.com/academic-animals|title=Academia Obscura, Academic Animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; F. D. C. Willard appeared henceforth repeatedly in footnotes, where he was thanked for "useful contributions to the discussion" or oral communications,&lt;ref name=Zankl/&gt; and even offered a position as a professor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academiaobscura.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/WoodruffLetter.pdf ''Woodruff Letter''] (from MSU Dean Truman O. Woodruff to Professor Jack Hetherington, dated 26 November 1975)&lt;/ref&gt; F. D. C. Willard is sometimes included in lists of "Famous Cats" or "Historical Cats". As an [[April Fool's]] joke, in 2014 the American Physical Society announced that cat-authored papers, including the Hetherington/Willard paper, would henceforth be open-access (papers of the APS usually require subscription or membership for web access).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://journals.aps.org/2014/04/01/aps-announces-a-new-open-access-initiative|title=APS Announces New Open Access Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Feigenbaum.png|thumb|Feigenbaum constant δ expresses the limit of the ratio of distances between consecutive bifurcation diagram on ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; / ''L''&lt;sub&gt;''i'' + 1&lt;/sub&gt;]]

In [[mathematics]], specifically [[bifurcation theory]], the '''Feigenbaum constants''' are two [[mathematical constant]]s which both express ratios in a [[bifurcation diagram]] for a non-linear map. They are named after the mathematician [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]].

==History==
Feigenbaum originally related the first constant to the [[period-doubling bifurcation]]s in the [[logistic map]], but also showed it to hold for all one-dimensional [[Map (mathematics)|maps]] with a single [[Quadratic function|quadratic]] [[Maxima and minima|maximum]]. As a consequence of this generality, every [[Chaos theory|chaotic system]] that corresponds to this description will [[Bifurcation theory|bifurcate]] at the same rate.  It was discovered in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Chaos: An Introduction to Dynamical Systems, K.T. Alligood, T.D. Sauer, J.A. Yorke, Textbooks in mathematical sciences ,Springer, 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-38794-677-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The first constant==
The first Feigenbaum constant  is the limiting [[ratio]] of each bifurcation interval to the next between every [[Period-doubling bifurcation|period doubling]], of a one-[[parameter]] map
:&lt;math&gt;x_{i+1} = f(x_i),&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''f''(''x'')}} is a function parameterized by the [[bifurcation theory|bifurcation parameter]] {{math|'''''a'''''}}.

It is given by the [[Limit of a sequence|limit]]&lt;ref&gt;Non-Linear Ordinary Differential Equations: Introduction for Scientists and Engineers (4th Edition), D. W. Jordan, P. Smith, Oxford University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-0-19-920825-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}}{a_n - a_{n-1}} = 4.669\,201\,609\,\ldots,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are discrete values of {{math|'''''a'''''}} at the {{math|''n''}}-th period doubling.

Here is this number to 30 decimal places {{OEIS|id=A006890}}: {{math|''δ''}} = {{gaps|4.669|201|609|102|990|671|853|203|821|578|…}}

===Illustration===

====Non-linear maps====
To see how this number arises, consider the real one-parameter map
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=a-x^2.&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|''a''}} is the bifurcation parameter, {{math|''x''}} is the variable. The values of {{math|''a''}} for which the period doubles (e.g. the largest value for {{math|''a''}} with no period-2 orbit, or the largest {{math|''a''}} with no period-4 orbit), are {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}, {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} etc. These are tabulated below:&lt;ref&gt;Alligood, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i633SeDqq-oC&amp;pg=PA503 p. 503].&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratio in the last column converges to the first Feigenbaum constant. The same number arises for the [[logistic map]]
:&lt;math&gt; f(x) = a x (1 - x) &lt;/math&gt;
with real parameter {{math|''a''}} and variable {{math|''x''}}. Tabulating the bifurcation values again:&lt;ref&gt;Alligood, [https://books.google.com/books?id=i633SeDqq-oC&amp;pg=PA504 p. 504].&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of the [[Mandelbrot set]] for [[complex quadratic polynomial]]
:&lt;math&gt; f(z) = z^2 + c &lt;/math&gt;
the Feigenbaum constant is the ratio between the diameters of successive circles on the [[real line|real axis]] in the [[complex plane]] (see animation on the right).

Bifurcation parameter is a root point of period-{{math|2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;}} component. This series converges to the Feigenbaum point {{math|''c''}} = −1.401155...... The ratio in the last column converges to the first Feigenbaum constant.

Other maps also reproduce this ratio, in this sense the Feigenbaum constant in bifurcation theory is analogous to [[Pi (number)|{{math|π}}]] in [[geometry]] and [[e (mathematical constant)|{{math|''e''}}]] in [[calculus]].

==The second constant==
The second Feigenbaum constant {{OEIS|id=A006891}},
: {{math|''α''}} = {{gaps|2.502|907|875|095|892|822|283|902|873|218|…}},
is the ratio between the width of a [[Tine (structural)|tine]] and the width of one of its two subtines (except the tine closest to the fold). A negative sign is applied to {{math|''α''}} when the ratio between the lower subtine and the width of the tine is measured.&lt;ref name="NonlinearDynamics"&gt;Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos, Steven H. Strogatz, Studies in Nonlinearity ,Perseus Books Publishing, 1994, {{isbn|978-0-7382-0453-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These numbers apply to a large class of [[dynamical system]]s (for example, dripping faucets to population growth).&lt;ref name="NonlinearDynamics" /&gt;

==Properties==
Both numbers are believed to be [[Transcendental number|transcendental]], although they have not been proven to be so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis

'''François Labourie''' (born 15 December 1960) is a [[France|French]] [[mathematician]] who has made various contributions to [[geometry]], including [[pseudoholomorphic curve]]s, [[Anosov diffeomorphism]], and [[convex geometry]]. In a series of papers with [[Yves Benoist]] and [[Patrick Foulon]], he solved a conjecture on Anosov's flows in compact contact manifolds.

He was educated at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] and [[Paris Diderot University]], where he earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under supervision of [[Mikhail Gromov (mathematician)|Mikhail Gromov]]. In 1992 he was awarded one of the inaugural prizes of the [[European Mathematical Society]].

The goal is to select a ''minimum-size'' subset &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; of ranges such that every point in the universe &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is covered by some range in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

Given the same range space &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;, a closely related problem is the '''geometric hitting set problem''', where the goal is to select a ''minimum-size'' subset &lt;math&gt;H \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; of points such that every range of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; has nonempty intersection with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., is ''hit'' by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

In the one-dimensional case, where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; contains points on the [[real line]] and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is defined by intervals, both the geometric set cover and hitting set problems can be solved in [[Time complexity|polynomial time]] using a simple [[greedy algorithm]]. However, in higher dimensions, they are known to be [[NP-completeness|NP-complete]] even for simple shapes, i.e., when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is induced by unit disks or unit squares.&lt;ref name="npc"&gt;{{Citation

Many [[approximation algorithm]]s have been devised for these problems. Due to the geometric nature, the approximation ratios for these problems can be much better than the general set cover/hitting set problems. Moreover, these approximate solutions can even be computed in near-linear time.&lt;ref name="AP14"&gt;

==Approximation algorithms==

The [[set cover problem#greedy algorithm|greedy algorithm]] for the general set cover problem gives &lt;math&gt;O(\log n)&lt;/math&gt; approximation, where &lt;math&gt;n = \max\{|X|, |\mathcal{R}|\}&lt;/math&gt;.

The approximation ratio can be further improved to &lt;math&gt;O(\log \log \mathsf{OPT})&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}&lt;/math&gt; is induced by axis-parallel rectangles or disks in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">'''George Frederick William Thibaut''' [[Order of the Indian Empire|CIE]] (March 20, 1848 – 1914) was an [[Indologist]] notable for his contributions to the understanding of [[History of India|ancient India]]n [[Indian mathematics|mathematics]] and [[Indian science|astronomy]].

==Life==
Thibaut was born in [[Germany]], worked briefly in [[England]], and then in 1875 was appointed Professor at the [[Government Sanskrit College, Varanasi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=THIBAUT, George Frederick William|magazine=Who's Who|date=1907|volume= 59|page=1734|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1734}}&lt;/ref&gt; in northern India. From 1888 to 1895 he was professor at [[Muir Central College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas T. McGetchin|title=Indology, Indomania, and Orientalism: Ancient India's Rebirth in Modern Germany|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHVRDSM-tyMC&amp;pg=PA107|date=2009|publisher=[[Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press]]|isbn=978-0-8386-4208-5|page=107–}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Allahabad]].

On 6 November 2014 in its column "100 Years Ago" ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' reprinted the following obituary on the late Dr. Thibaut:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The death is reported at Heidelberg Hospital, Germany of Dr George Thibaut, C.I.E., Ph.D., D.Sc., who recently retired from the Education Service as Registrar of the Calcutta University. Dr. Thibaut who took part in Franco-German War of 1870 as a noncommissioned officer joined the Muir Central College, Allahabad some 22 years ago as Professor of Philosophy. He rose to be the Principal of the College and was appointed Registrar of the Allahabad University, afterwards being transferred to Calcutta. Besides being a well-known student of philosophy Eastern and Western, the late Dr. Thibaut was an eminent Sanskrit scholar.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was appointed CIE in the [[1906 New Year Honours]].

==Works==
Between 1875 and 1878 Thibaut published a detailed essay on the ''[[Śulba sūtras]]'', together with a translation of the ''Baudhāyana Śulba sūtra''; he later translated the ''[[Pañca Siddhāntikā]]'' which he co-edited with Pandit [[Sudhakar Dwivedi]] (the latter added a Sanskrit commentary). He also edited and translated the following volumes in [[Max Müller]]'s ''[[Sacred Books of the East]]'':

* Vol. 34, ''[[Brahma Sutras|The Vedanta-Sutras]]'', vol. 1 of 3, with the commentary of  [[Adi Shankara|Sankaracharya]], part 1 of 2. Adhyâya I–II (Pâda I–II). (1890)	
* Vol. 38, ''The Vedanta-Sutras'', vol. 2 of 3, with the commentary of  Sankaracharya, part 1 of 2. Adhyâya II (Pâda III–IV)–IV. (1896)
It was one of the earliest translation of the [[Brahma Sutras]] along with the work of [[Paul Deussen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nakamura|first=Hajime|title=A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy: part two|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]]|page=776}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Vol. 48, ''The Vedanta-Sutras'', vol. 3 of 3, with the commentary of [[Râmânuja]]. (1904)	

Thibaut contributed a number of Sanskrit manuscripts to the Department of Oriental Collections, [[Bodleian Library]], [[University of Oxford]], where they are archived today.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21322">'''Goal difference''' or '''points difference''' is a form of [[tiebreaker]] used to rank sport teams which finish on equal points in a [[sports league|league competition]]. Either "goal difference" or "points difference" is used, depending on whether matches are scored by [[goal (sport)|goals]] (as in [[ice hockey]] and [[association football]]) or by points (as in [[rugby union]] and [[basketball]]).

Goal difference (or points difference) is calculated as the number of goals (or points) scored in all league matches minus the number of goals or points conceded. Goal difference was first introduced as a tiebreaker in association football, at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]],&lt;ref name=Mathletics&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrow|first=John D.|title=Mathletics|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=9780099584230|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was adopted by the [[Football League]] in England five years later.&lt;ref name=Mathletics /&gt; It has since spread to many other competitions, where it is typically used as either the first or, after tying teams' head-to-head records, second tiebreaker.

Goal difference has often replaced the older '''goal average''', or '''goal ratio'''. Goal average means the number of goals scored divided by the number of goals conceded. It was replaced by goal difference, which was thought to encourage more attacking play, encouraging teams to score more goals (or points) as opposed to defending against conceding.&lt;ref name="Mathletics" /&gt; However goal average is still used as the tiebreaker in [[Australian rules football]] where it is referred to as "percentage". This is calculated as points scored divided by points conceded, and then multiplied by 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Calculating Percentages for the AFL Ladder|url=http://thepowerfromport2.tripod.com/AFL/calculatingpercentages.html|publisher=The Power From Port|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If two or more teams' total points scored and goal differences are both equal, then often goals scored is used as a further tiebreaker, with the team scoring the most goals winning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who wins the League if teams have the same number of points? |url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-wins-league-if-teams-finish-on-same-points.html |publisher=FA Premier League |accessdate=7 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429133656/http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/fans/faqs/who-wins-league-if-teams-finish-on-same-points.html |archivedate=29 April 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After this a variety of other tiebreakers may be used.

==Goal difference ''v.'' goal average==

The different schemes can lead to strikingly different results. With the following matches:

{{football box
|date = &amp;nbsp;
|team1 = Team A
|score = 3–0
|team2 = Team B
|goals1 = &amp;nbsp;
|goals2 = &amp;nbsp;
|stadium = &amp;nbsp; |
}}
----
{{football box
|date = &amp;nbsp;
|team1 = Team B
|score = 6–0
|team2 = Team C
|goals1 = &amp;nbsp;
|goals2 = &amp;nbsp;
|stadium = &amp;nbsp; |
}}
----
{{football box
|date = &amp;nbsp;
|team1 = Team A
|score = 0–1
|team2 = Team C
|goals1 = &amp;nbsp;
|goals2 = &amp;nbsp;
|stadium = &amp;nbsp; |
}}

Under goal average, Team A would win:

{{Fb_cl_header|noqr=y|gavg=y}}
|- style="background:#ccffcc;"
| 1 || style="text-align:left;"|Team A || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 3 || 1 || 3.000 || '''3''' 
|-
| 2 || style="text-align:left;"|Team B || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 6 || 3 || 2.000 || '''3''' 
|-
| 3 || style="text-align:left;"|Team C || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 6 || 0.167 || '''3'''
|}

Under goal difference, Team B would win:

{{Fb_cl_header|noqr=y}}
|- style="background:#ccffcc;"
| 1 || style="text-align:left;"|Team B || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 6 || 3 || +3 || '''3'''
|-
| 2 || style="text-align:left;"|Team A || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 3 || 1 || +2 || '''3''' 
|-
| 3 || style="text-align:left;"|Team C || 2 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 6 || −5 || '''3'''
|}

Goal average was replaced by goal difference due to the former's encouragement of lower-scoring games. For example, a team that scores 70 while conceding 40 would have a lesser goal average (1.750) than another team that scores 69 while conceding 39 (1.769). Or, for the team that has scored 70 while conceding 40, conceding another would reduce the goal average by 0.043 (to 1.707), whereas scoring another would increase it by only 0.025 (to 1.775), making not conceding much more important than scoring again.

Another issue with goal average is that, if a team has conceded no goals (e.g. [[1966 FIFA World Cup#Group 1|Group 1 of the 1966 World Cup]]), the value cannot be calculated, as [[division by zero]] is undefined.

Heading into the final day of the 2006–07 ''[[Eredivisie]]'' season, three teams were still in contention to win the title, and with it a guaranteed place in the 2007–08 UEFA Champions League. PSV, looking to win their third straight league title, was the only one of the three to play its final match at home, against [[Vitesse Arnhem]]. Ajax, looking to win their first title since 2004, traveled to [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]], while AZ faced Excelsior looking to win its first league title since 1981, after finishing in the top three in the previous two seasons.

These final matches were played on April 29, 2007. AZ struggled against [[S.B.V._Excelsior|Excelsior]] (who would have to go through a relegation play-off after the end of the game) as they played almost 72 minutes of the match with only 10 men, as goalkeeper [[Boy Waterman]] was red-carded in the 18th minute. AZ came from behind twice, with [[Danny Koevermans]] tying the match in the 70th minute with his 22nd goal of the season. AZ had a chance to take the lead after its numerical disadvantage was leveled as Excelsior's Rene van Dieren was sent off for yellow card accumulation. AZ never took advantage and a goal from Johan Voskamp in the 90th minute gave Excelsior a shock 3–2 win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/04/29/netherlands/eredivisie/sbv-excelsior/stichting-az/372377/|title=Excelsior vs. AZ – 29 April 2007 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, in Tilburg, Ajax took the lead in the 18th minute with a goal from Urby Emanuelson. Ajax added a second goal in the 69th minute as [[Klaas-Jan Huntelaar]] scored his 21st goal of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/04/29/netherlands/eredivisie/sbv-willem-ii-tilburg/afc-ajax/372385/|title=Willem II vs. Ajax – 29 April 2007 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, PSV scored twice in the first 10 minutes, but gave up a goal three minutes later and led only 2–1 at half-time. In the second half, [[Ibrahim Afellay]] scored in the 58th minute before another goal from Jefferson Farfan made the score 4–1 to PSV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2007/04/29/netherlands/eredivisie/psv-nv/sbv-vitesse/372382/|title=PSV vs. Vitesse – 29 April 2007 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Huntelaar's 69th-minute goal, PSV and Ajax were level on points, but Ajax had a superior goal difference, by one goal. But in the 77th minute, Philip Cocu put PSV up 5–1 and the team was up on goal difference (+50 to Ajax's +49). The scores stayed that way at full time, and so PSV won the 2006–07 ''Eredivisie'' in one of the most exciting finishes to a season in recent memory.

==== 2010, [[Breiðablik UBK]], [[ÍBV]] and [[FH Hafnarfjörður]] ====

The [[2010 Úrvalsdeild]] season concluded on September 25, 2010, and three teams were still in contention to win the league title. Leading the table was Breiðablik, based in [[Kópavogur]], who knew that a win would give them their first ever league title. Trailing one point behind were ÍBV from [[Vestmannaeyjar]], who were looking to win their fourth league title, but its first since 1998. In third place was two-time defending champions FH, looking to win the league title, but trailing Breiðablik by only two points.

Breiðablik traveled to [[Stjarnan]] and were held to a scoreless draw, but would get encouraging news. Playing their final game at [[Keflavík]], ÍBV were losing 2–0 with 16 minutes remaining when Denis Sytnik scored for ÍBV to cut the deficit to 2–1. But two late goals from Keflavík's [[Magnús Þorsteinsson]] and Bojan Ljubicic denied ÍBV a chance to overtake Breiðablik, as ÍBV lost to Keflavík by 4–1.

Meanwhile, a draw opened the door for FH as they traveled to Reykjavík to face Fram needing to overturn an 11-goal difference. FH got two goals from Gunnar Kristjansson and a third from [[Atli Viðar Björnsson]] (which would tie him with two players for the league lead with 14 goals). However, the 3–0 victory was not enough to deny Breiðablik their first ever league title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=isl/news/newsid=1536245.html|title=Breidablik celebrate first Icelandic title – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|website=www.uefa.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/09/25/iceland/urvalsdeild/ungmennafelagid-stjarnan-gardabaer/umf-breidablik-kopavogur/908889/|title=Stjarnan vs. Breidablik – 25 September 2010 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/09/25/iceland/urvalsdeild/knattspyrnudeild-keflavikur/ithrottabandelag-vestmannaeyjar/908887/|title=Keflavík vs. ÍBV – 25 September 2010 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2010/09/25/iceland/urvalsdeild/knattspyrnudeild-fram-reykjavik/fimleikafelag-hafnarfjordur/908888/|title=Fram vs. FH – 25 September 2010 – Soccerway|website=int.soccerway.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012, Manchester City and Manchester United====
The [[2011–12 Premier League]] was generally a two-horse race contested between [[Manchester City]] and [[Manchester United]] for most of the season, with both clubs finishing 19 points ahead of third-placed [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]. City and United went into their final matches of the season level on points, but with City in first-place due to a goal difference superior by +8. The final matches were relegation threatened [[Queens Park Rangers]] at home for City, and [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] away for United. City were strong favourites, with United's manager [[Alex Ferguson]] stating City would have to do 'something stupid' not to beat QPR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Sir Alex Ferguson eyes 'stupid' Manchester City result |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18034033 |work=BBC Sport |date=11 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Manchester City win would guarantee the title due to a realistically unassailable superior goal difference. If not a win, then City just needed to match United's result at the [[Stadium of Light]] against Sunderland. United scored in the 20th minute, winning 1–0. City scored two goals in injury time to come from behind and win 3–2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=How Joey Barton handed Manchester City the Premier League title |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/may/13/joey-barton-manchester-city-title |newspaper=The Guardian |date=13 May 2012 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1989, Arsenal and Liverpool====
{{main|Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)}}
[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the league championship on goals-scored, after finishing level on points and goal-difference with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[1988-89 Football League|1988–89 season]]. Arsenal defeated Liverpool 2–0 in the final game of the season to win the championship.

====2014, [[Debreceni VSC]] and [[Győri ETO FC]]====

Ahead of the final day of the [[2013–14 Nemzeti Bajnokság I]] season, Debrecen was on course to win its 7th league title since 2005 as its closest competitor Gyor had to overturn a 14-goal swing on the final matchday. Despite losing its season-finale 2–0 to Budapest Honved FC, Debrecen won the title as Gyor only won 5–0 against already-relegated [[Mezőkövesd-Zsóry SE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=hun/news/newsid=2106765.html|title=Member associations - Hungary - News – UEFA.com|first=|last=uefa.com|date=31 May 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===England lower division titles decided on goal difference===

====[[1983–84 in English football|1983–84]], Second Division – [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]–[[Sheffield Wednesday]]====

Chelsea 88 points and goal difference 50, Sheffield Wednesday 88 points and goal difference 38.

====[[1989–90 in English football|1989–90]], Second Division – [[Leeds United]]–[[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]]====

Leeds United 85 points and goal difference 27, Sheffield United 85 points and goal difference 20.

====[[1981–82 in English football|1981–82]], Third Division – [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]]–[[Carlisle United]]====

Burnley 80 points and goal difference 21, Carlisle United 80 points and goal difference 15.

====[[2016-17 in English football|2016–17]], League 2 – [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]-[[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth Argyle]]====

Portsmouth 87 points and goal difference 39, Plymouth 87 points and goal difference 25.

(N.B. in [[1996–97 in English football|1996–97]] [[Wigan Athletic]] and [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] finished level on 87 points at the top of the Third Division, but Wigan Athletic were awarded the championship on most goals scored, which was the first tie breaker in use in the [[Football League]] between 1992 and 1999, although Fulham had the greater goal difference. Coincidentally [[Brighton and Hove Albion]] avoided relegation from the same division on goals scored at the expense of [[Hereford United]], although Hereford had the better goal difference.  It reverted to the Goal Difference method from the start of the 1999–2000 season.)

===Scotland===

====1986, Premier Division – Hearts–Celtic====
In [[1985–86 in Scottish football|1986]], Hearts lost 2–0 at [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] on the final day of the season, which allowed [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] to win the league championship on goal difference. Had the first tie-breaker been goal average, Hearts would have won the championship.&lt;ref name = "hearts"/&gt;

====2003, Premier League – Old Firm====
[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] won the [[Scottish Premier League 2002-03|Scottish Premier League in 2003]] on goal difference. In the final round of matches, Rangers played [[Dunfermline Athletic F.C.|Dunfermline]], while second-placed Celtic were playing at Kilmarnock. With Celtic and Rangers level on 94 points going into these matches, the Championship would be decided by which team, Celtic or Rangers, performed best during the final round of matches. If both teams won they would each finish on 97 points, and the League would be decided on goal difference. Rangers won 6–1 and Celtic won 4–0, which left Rangers with a goal difference of 73 (101 for and 28 against), and Celtic a goal difference of 72 (98 scored and 26 against) giving Rangers the title.

==Titles decided on goal average==

===England top-flight===

====1953, First Division–Arsenal-Preston North End====
In the [[1952-53 in English football|1952–53 Football League Championship]], [[Arsenal F.C|Arsenal]] and [[Preston North End]] both finished on 54 points. Arsenal won the title with 97 goals for to 64 against, for an average of 1.516. Preston's 85 to 60 gave 1.417.

===England lower divisions===

====1950, Second Division–Sheffield United-Sheffield Wednesday====
Going into the last game of the [[1949-50 in English football|1949–50 season]], [[Sheffield Wednesday]] needed a result against [[Tottenham Hotspur]] to secure second place and clinch promotion at the expense of their [[Steel City derby|local rivals]] [[Sheffield United]].  The resulting 0–0 draw meant Wednesday won promotion by a goal average difference of just 0.008 – a 1–1 draw would have left the two level on points and goal average, and a unique play-off match would have had to be played.

===Scotland===

====1953, Division A – Rangers–Hibernian====
[[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] drew their last match of the [[1952–53 Scottish Division One|1952–53]] season, against [[Queen of the South F.C.|Queen of the South]], 1–1, to finish level with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]] on 43 points. They won the title with a goal average of 80–39 to 93–51 (2.051 to 1.824).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rangers Champions|work=Manchester Guardian|date=8 May 1953}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1965, First Division – Hearts–Kilmarnock====
Entering the final day of the [[1964–65 in Scottish football|1964–65]] season, [[Heart of Midlothian F.C.|Hearts]] were two points ahead of nearest rivals [[Kilmarnock F.C.|Kilmarnock]], with two points awarded for a win. Hearts played Kilmarnock at [[Tynecastle Stadium|Tynecastle]] in the last game, with Kilmarnock needing a 2–0 victory to win the [[list of Scottish football champions|league championship]] on goal average. Hearts could afford to lose 1–0 or 2–1, but lost 2–0 and Kilmarnock won the championship by a goal average of 1.88 to 1.84. Had goal difference been in use, Hearts would have been champions.&lt;ref name = "hearts"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/hearts/5363880/What-a-heartbreaker-How-Hearts-lost-the-Scottish-title-to-Celtic-in-1986.html |title=How Hearts lost the Scottish title to Celtic in 1986  |work=Daily Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph Media Group |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=8 May 2014 |first=Roddy |last=Forsyth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yugoslavia===

====1951, First League – Red Star Belgrade–Dinamo Zagreb====
[[Red Star Belgrade]] won the [[1951 Yugoslav First League]] championship ahead of [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] with a 0.013 better goal average. Dinamo's final match against [[OFK Beograd|BSK Belgrade]] ended in a 2–2 draw, and the following day Red Star defeated [[FK Partizan|Partizan]] 2–0, meaning that both teams finished on 35 points. Red Star's 50 goals for and 21 against gave a goal average of 2.381, while Dinamo's 45 to 19 gave 2.368.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.crvenazvezdafk.com/ovako-je-sve-pocelo-4937-s1-c1-content.htm |title=Ovako je sve počelo... |last= |first= |date=5 November 2011 |work=crvenazvezdafk.com |language=Serbian |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sportal.rs/news.php?id=61686 |title=Šest decenija od prve Zvezdine titule |last= |first= |date=2 November 2011 |work=sportal.rs |language=Serbian |accessdate=26 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104012129/http://sportal.rs/news.php?id=61686 |archivedate=4 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1958, First League – RNK Split–Budućnost====
In the [[1957–58 Yugoslav First League]] championship, [[RNK Split]] and [[FK Budućnost Podgorica|Budućnost]] finished the season leveled on points and goal average. Both teams had 25 points, with Budućnost's 30 goals for and 36 against giving a goal average of 0.833, the same as RNK Split's 35 goals for and 42 against. A two-legged play-off match between the two was needed to decide who will enter relegation play-offs. The match in Split ended in a goalless draw, while in the return leg Budućnost defeated RNK Split 4–0. RNK Split entered the relegation play-offs and was relegated in their first season in the top flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arhiv.slobodnadalmacija.hr/20020416/sport02.asp |title=Devedeset ljeta splitskih crvenih |last=Bibić |first=Milorad |date=16 April 2002 |work=Slobodna Dalmacija |language=Croatian |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Guido Fubini''' (19 January 1879 – 6 June 1943) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]], known for [[Fubini's theorem]] and the [[Fubini–Study metric]].

Born in [[Venice]], he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics.  In 1896 he entered the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]], where he studied under the notable mathematicians [[Ulisse Dini]] and [[Luigi Bianchi]].  He gained some early fame when his 1900 doctoral thesis, entitled ''[[Clifford parallel|Clifford's parallelism]] in [[elliptic space]]s'', was discussed in a widely read work on [[differential geometry]] published by Bianchi in 1902.

After earning his doctorate, he took up a series of professorships.  In 1901 he began teaching at the [[University of Catania]] in [[Sicily]]; shortly afterwards he moved to the [[University of Genoa]]; and in 1908 he moved to the [[Politecnico di Torino|Politecnico]] in [[Turin]] and then the [[University of Turin]], where he would stay for a few decades.

During this time his research focused primarily on topics in [[mathematical analysis]], especially [[differential equations]], [[functional analysis]], and [[complex analysis]]; but he also studied the [[calculus of variations]], [[group theory]], [[non-Euclidean geometry]], and [[projective geometry]], among other topics.  With the outbreak of [[World War I]], he shifted his work towards more applied topics, studying the accuracy of artillery fire; after the war, he continued in an applied direction, applying results from this work to problems in [[electrical circuit]]s and [[acoustics]].

In 1939, when Fubini at the age of 60 was nearing retirement, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Fascists]] adopted the [[anti-Jewish]] policies advocated for several years by [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazis]].  As a [[Jew]], Fubini feared for the safety of his family, and so accepted an invitation by [[Princeton University]] to teach there; he died in [[New York City]] four years later.

A main belt asteroid, [[22495 Fubini]], was named in his honour.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12475">In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, the '''Hajós construction''' is an [[Graph operations|operation on graphs]] named after {{harvs|first=György|last=Hajós|authorlink=György Hajós|year=1961|txt}} that may be used to construct any [[critical graph]] or any graph whose [[chromatic number]] is at least some given threshold.

==The construction==
[[File:Hajos construction.svg|thumb|300px|Applying the Hajós construction to two copies of {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} by identifying a vertex from each copy into a single vertex (shown with both colors), deleting an edge incident to the combined vertex within each subgraph (dashed) and adding a new edge connecting the endpoints of the deleted edges (thick green), produces the [[Moser spindle]].]]
Let {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} be two [[undirected graph]]s, {{mvar|vw}} be an edge of {{mvar|G}}, and {{mvar|xy}} be an edge of {{mvar|H}}. Then the Hajós construction forms a new graph that combines the two graphs by identifying vertices {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|x}} into a single vertex, removing the two edges {{mvar|vw}} and {{mvar|xy}}, and adding a new edge {{mvar|wy}}.

For example, let {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} each be a [[complete graph]] {{math|''K''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}} on four vertices; because of the symmetry of these graphs, the choice of which edge to select from each of them is unimportant. In this case, the result of applying the Hajós construction is the [[Moser spindle]], a seven-vertex [[unit distance graph]] that requires four colors.

As another example, if {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} are [[cycle graph]]s of length {{mvar|p}} and {{mvar|q}} respectively, then the result of applying the Hajós construction is itself a cycle graph, of length {{math|''p'' + ''q'' &amp;minus; 1}}.

==Constructible graphs==
A graph {{mvar|G}} is said to be {{mvar|k}}-'''constructible''' (or Hajós-{{mvar|k}}-constructible) when it formed in one of the following three ways:&lt;ref name="d06"&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The complete graph {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}} is {{mvar|k}}-constructible.
*Let {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} be any two {{mvar|k}}-constructible graphs. Then the graph formed by applying the Hajós construction to {{mvar|G}} and {{mvar|H}} is {{mvar|k}}-constructible.
*Let {{mvar|G}} be any {{mvar|k}}-constructible graph, and let {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} be any two non-adjacent vertices in {{mvar|G}}. Then the graph formed by combining {{mvar|u}} and {{mvar|v}} into a single vertex is also {{mvar|k}}-constructible. Equivalently, this graph may be formed by adding edge {{mvar|uv}} to the graph and then [[edge contraction|contracting]] it.

==Connection to coloring==
It is straightforward to verify that every {{mvar|k}}-constructible graph requires at least {{mvar|k}} colors in any [[graph coloring|proper graph coloring]]. Indeed, this is clear for the complete graph {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, and the effect of identifying two nonadjacent vertices is to force them to have the same color as each other in any coloring, something that does not reduce the number of colors. In the Hajós construction itself, the new edge {{mvar|wy}} forces at least one of the two vertices {{mvar|w}} and {{mvar|y}} to have a different color than the combined vertex for {{mvar|v}} and {{mvar|x}}, so any proper coloring of the combined graph leads to a proper coloring of one of the two smaller graphs from which it was formed, which again causes it to require {{mvar|k}} colors.&lt;ref name="d06"/&gt;

Hajós proved more strongly that a graph requires at least {{mvar|k}} colors, in any [[graph coloring|proper coloring]], if and only if it contains a {{mvar|k}}-constructible graph as a subgraph. Equivalently, every {{mvar|k}}-[[critical graph]] (a graph that requires {{mvar|k}} colors but for which every proper subgraph requires fewer colors) is {{mvar|k}}-constructible.&lt;ref&gt;A proof can also be found in {{harvtxt|Diestel|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, every graph that requires {{mvar|k}} colors may be formed by combining the Hajós construction, the operation of identifying any two nonadjacent vertices, and the operations of adding a vertex or edge to the given graph, starting from the complete graph {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1994}}, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar construction may be used for [[list coloring]] in place of coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gravier|1996}}; {{harvtxt|Kubale|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructibility of critical graphs==
For {{math|1=''k'' = 3}}, every {{mvar|k}}-critical graph (that is, every odd cycle) can be generated as a {{mvar|k}}-constructible graph such that all of the graphs formed in its construction are also {{mvar|k}}-critical. For {{math|1=''k'' = 8}}, this is not true: a graph found by {{harvtxt|Catlin|1979}} as a counterexample to [[Hadwiger conjecture (graph theory)#Generalizations|Hajós's conjecture]] that {{mvar|k}}-chromatic graphs contain a subdivision of {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, also serves as a counterexample to this problem. Subsequently, {{mvar|k}}-critical but not {{mvar|k}}-constructible graphs solely through {{mvar|k}}-critical graphs were found for all {{math|''k'' ≥ 4}}. For {{math|1=''k'' = 4}}, one such example is the graph obtained from the [[dodecahedron]] graph by adding a new edge between each pair of [[antipodal point|antipodal]] vertices&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Jensen|Royle|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Hajós number==
Because merging two non-adjacent vertices reduces the number of vertices in the resulting graph, the number of operations needed to represent a given graph {{mvar|G}} using the operations defined by Hajós may exceed the number of vertices in {{mvar|G}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Diestel|2006}} alludes to this when he writes that the sequence of operations is "not always short". {{harvtxt|Jensen|Toft|1994}}, 11.6 Length of Hajós proofs, pp. 184–185, state as an open problem the question of determining the smallest number of steps needed to construct every {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph.&lt;/ref&gt;

More specifically, {{harvtxt|Mansfield|Welsh|1982}} define the '''Hajós number''' {{math|''h''(''G'')}} of a {{mvar|k}}-chromatic graph {{mvar|G}} to be the minimum number of steps needed to construct {{mvar|G}} from {{mvar|K&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;}}, where each step forms a new graph by combining two previously formed graphs, merging two nonadjacent vertices of a previously formed graph, or adding a vertex or edge to a previously formed graph. They showed that, for an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph {{mvar|G}} with {{mvar|m}} edges, {{math|''h''(''G'') ≤ 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/3 &amp;minus; ''m'' + 1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;minus; 1}}. If every graph has a polynomial Hajós number, this would imply that it is possible to prove non-colorability in [[NP (complexity)|nondeterministic polynomial time]], and therefore imply that NP&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;[[co-NP]], a conclusion considered unlikely by complexity theorists.&lt;ref name="pu95"&gt;{{harvtxt|Pitassi|Urquhart|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is not known how to prove non-polynomial lower bounds on the Hajós number without making some complexity-theoretic assumption, and if such a bound could be proven it would also imply the existence of non-polynomial bounds on certain types of [[Frege system]] in [[mathematical logic]].&lt;ref name="pu95"/&gt;

The minimum size of an [[expression tree]] describing a Hajós construction for a given graph {{mvar|G}} may be significantly larger than the Hajós number of {{mvar|G}}, because a shortest expression for {{mvar|G}} may re-use the same graphs multiple times, an economy not permitted in an expression tree. There exist 3-chromatic graphs for which the smallest such expression tree has exponential size.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Iwama|Pitassi|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other applications==
{{harvtxt|Koester|1991}} used the Hajós construction to generate an infinite set of 4-critical [[polyhedral graph]]s, each having more than twice as many edges as vertices. Similarly, {{harvtxt|Liu|Zhang|2006}} used the construction, starting with the [[Grötzsch graph]], to generate many 4-critical [[triangle-free graph]]s, which they showed to be difficult to color using traditional [[backtracking]] algorithms.

In [[polyhedral combinatorics]], {{harvtxt|Euler|2003}} used the Hajós construction to generate [[Facet (mathematics)|facets]] of the [[Independent set (graph theory)|stable set]] [[polytope]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33737">In [[mathematics]], the '''harmonic mean''' (sometimes called the '''subcontrary mean''') is one of several kinds of [[average]], and in particular one of the [[Pythagorean means]]. Typically, it is appropriate for situations when the average of [[rate (mathematics)|rate]]s is desired.

The harmonic mean can be expressed as the [[multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the [[arithmetic mean]] of the reciprocals of the given set of observations. As a simple example, the harmonic mean of 1, 4, and 4 is
: &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{1^{-1} + 4^{-1} + 4^{-1}}{3}\right)^{-1} = \frac{3}{\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{4}} = \frac{3}{1.5} = 2\,.&lt;/math&gt;

==Definition==

The harmonic mean ''H'' of the positive [[real number]]s
&lt;math&gt;x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined to be

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{n}{\frac1{x_1} + \frac1{x_2} + \cdots + \frac1{x_n}} = \frac{n}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac1{x_i}} = \left(\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n x_i^{-1}}{n}\right)^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The third formula in the above equation expresses the harmonic mean as the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals.

From the following formula:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{n\cdot \prod\limits_{j=1}^n x_j}{ \sum\limits_{i=1}^n \left\{\frac{1}{x_i}{\prod\limits_{j=1}^n x_j}\right\}}.&lt;/math&gt;

it is more apparent that the harmonic mean is related to the [[arithmetic mean|arithmetic]] and [[geometric mean]]s. It is the reciprocal [[dual (mathematics)|dual]] of the [[arithmetic mean]] for positive inputs:

:&lt;math&gt;1/H(1/x_1 \ldots 1/x_n) = A(x_1 \ldots x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

The harmonic mean is a [[Schur-concave]] function, and dominated by the minimum of its arguments, in the sense that for any positive set of arguments, &lt;math&gt;\min(x_1 \ldots x_n) \le H(x_1 \ldots x_n) \le n \min(x_1 \ldots x_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the harmonic mean cannot be made [[arbitrarily large]] by changing some values to bigger ones (while having at least one value unchanged).

==Relationship with other means==
The harmonic mean is one of the three [[Pythagorean means]]. For all ''positive'' data sets ''containing at least one pair of nonequal values'', the harmonic mean is always the least of the three means,&lt;ref&gt;Da-Feng Xia, Sen-Lin Xu, and Feng Qi, "A proof of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean-harmonic mean inequalities", RGMIA Research Report Collection, vol. 2, no. 1, 1999, http://ajmaa.org/RGMIA/papers/v2n1/v2n1-10.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[arithmetic mean]] is always the greatest of the three and the [[geometric mean]] is always in between. (If all values in a nonempty dataset are equal, the three means are always equal to one another; e.g., the harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means of {2,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;2} are all&amp;nbsp;2.)

It is the special case ''M''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; of the [[power mean]]:

:&lt;math&gt;H\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\right) = M_{-1}\left(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\right) = \frac{n}{x_1^{-1} + x_2^{-1} + \cdots + x_n^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the harmonic mean of a list of numbers tends strongly toward the least elements of the list, it tends (compared to the arithmetic mean) to mitigate the impact of large outliers and aggravate the impact of small ones.

The arithmetic mean is often mistakenly used in places calling for the harmonic mean.&lt;ref&gt;*''Statistical Analysis'', Ya-lun Chou, Holt International, 1969, {{ISBN|0030730953}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the speed example [[#Examples|below]] for instance, the arithmetic mean of 50 is incorrect, and too big.

The harmonic mean is related to the other Pythagorean means, as seen in the equation below. This can be seen by interpreting the denominator to be the arithmetic mean of the product of numbers ''n'' times but each time omitting the ''j''-th term. That is, for the first term, we multiply all ''n'' numbers except the first; for the second, we multiply all ''n'' numbers except the second; and so on. The numerator, excluding the ''n'', which goes with the arithmetic mean, is the geometric mean to the power&amp;nbsp;''n''. Thus the ''n''-th harmonic mean is related to the ''n''-th geometric and arithmetic means. The general formula is

:&lt;math&gt;H\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right) =
  \frac{\left(G\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right)\right)^n}
       {A\left(x_2 x_3 \cdots x_n, x_1 x_3 \cdots x_n, \ldots, x_1 x_2 \cdots x_{n-1}\right)} =
  \frac{\left(G\left(x_1, \ldots, x_n\right)\right)^n}
       {A\left(
         \frac{1}{x_1} {\prod\limits_{i=1}^n x_i},
         \frac{1}{x_2} {\prod\limits_{i=1}^n x_i},
         \ldots,
         \frac{1}{x_n} {\prod\limits_{i=1}^n x_i}
       \right)}.
&lt;/math&gt;

If a set of non-identical numbers is subjected to a [[mean-preserving spread]] — that is, two or more elements of the set are "spread apart" from each other while leaving the arithmetic mean unchanged — then the harmonic mean always decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Douglas W., "More on spreads and non-arithmetic means," ''[[The Mathematical Gazette]]'' 88, March 2004, 142–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Harmonic mean of two or three numbers==

===Two numbers===
[[File:MathematicalMeans.svg|thumb|right|A geometric construction of the three [[Pythagorean means]] of two numbers, ''a'' and ''b''. The harmonic mean is denoted by ''H'' in purple. ''Q'' denotes a fourth mean, the [[quadratic mean]]. Since a [[hypotenuse]] is always longer than a leg of a [[right triangle]], the diagram shows that ''Q'' &gt; ''A'' &gt; ''G'' &gt; ''H''.]]

For the special case of just two numbers, &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;, the harmonic mean can be written
:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{2x_1 x_2}{x_1 + x_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

In this special case, the harmonic mean is related to the [[arithmetic mean]] &lt;math&gt;A = \frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and the [[geometric mean]] &lt;math&gt;G = \sqrt{x_1 x_2},&lt;/math&gt; by
:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{G^2}{A} = G \cdot \left(\frac{G}{A}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{G}{A} \le 1&lt;/math&gt; by the [[inequality of arithmetic and geometric means]], this shows for the ''n'' = 2 case that ''H'' &amp;le; ''G'' (a property that in fact holds for all ''n''). It also follows that &lt;math&gt;G = \sqrt{AH}&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the two numbers' geometric mean equals the geometric mean of their arithmetic and harmonic means.

===Three numbers===
For the special case of three numbers, &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x_3&lt;/math&gt;, the harmonic mean can be written
:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{3 x_1 x_2 x_3}{x_1 x_2 + x_1 x_3 + x_2 x_3}.&lt;/math&gt;

Three positive numbers ''H'', ''G'', and ''A'' are respectively the harmonic, geometric, and arithmetic means of three positive numbers [[if and only if]]&lt;ref name=Crux&gt;''Inequalities proposed in “[[Crux Mathematicorum]]”'', {{cite web |url=http://www.imomath.com/othercomp/Journ/ineq.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-09 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141015174828/http://www.imomath.com/othercomp/Journ/ineq.pdf |archivedate=2014-10-15 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.74,#1834}} the following inequality holds

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{A^3}{G^3} + \frac{G^3}{H^3} + 1 \le \frac3{4} \left(1 + \frac{A}{H}\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Weighted harmonic mean==
If a set of [[weight function|weights]] &lt;math&gt;w_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;w_n&lt;/math&gt; is associated to the dataset &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt;, ..., &lt;math&gt;x_n&lt;/math&gt;, the '''weighted harmonic mean''' is defined by
:&lt;math&gt;
  H = \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n \frac{w_i}{x_i}}
    = \left( \frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i x_i^{-1}}{\sum\limits_{i=1}^n w_i} \right)^{-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The unweighted harmonic mean can be regarded as the special case where all of the weights are equal.

==Examples==

===In physics===
====Average speed====
In many situations involving [[rate (mathematics)|rate]]s and [[ratio]]s, the harmonic mean provides the truest [[average]]. For instance, if a vehicle travels a certain distance ''d'' outbound at a speed ''x'' (e.g. 60 km/h) and returns the same distance at a speed ''y'' (e.g. 20 km/h), then its average speed is the harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (30 km/h) &amp;ndash; not the arithmetic mean (40 km/h). The total travel time is the same as if it had traveled the whole distance at that average speed. This can be proven as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learningpundits.com/module-view/48-averages/1-tips-on-averages/|title=Average: How to calculate Average, Formula, Weighted average|author=|date=|website=learningpundits.com|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229231610/https://learningpundits.com/module-view/48-averages/1-tips-on-averages/|archivedate=29 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Average speed for the entire journey
:= &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|Total distance traveled|Total time taken}}&lt;/big&gt;
:= &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|2''d''|{{sfrac|''d''|''x''}} + {{sfrac|''d''|''y''}} }}&lt;/big&gt;
:= &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|2''d''|{{sfrac|''yd'' + ''xd''|''xy''}} }}&lt;/big&gt;
:= &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|2''dxy''|''d''(''x'' + ''y'')}}&lt;/big&gt;
:= &lt;big&gt;{{sfrac|2''xy''|''x'' + ''y''}}&lt;/big&gt; (harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'')

However, if the vehicle travels for a certain amount of ''time'' at a speed ''x'' and then the same amount of time at a speed ''y'', then its average speed is the [[arithmetic mean]] of ''x'' and ''y'', which in the above example is 40 km/h. The same principle applies to more than two segments: given a series of sub-trips at different speeds, if each sub-trip covers the same ''distance'', then the average speed is the ''harmonic'' mean of all the sub-trip speeds; and if each sub-trip takes the same amount of ''time'', then the average speed is the ''arithmetic'' mean of all the sub-trip speeds. (If neither is the case, then a [[#Weighted harmonic mean|weighted harmonic mean]] or [[weighted arithmetic mean]] is needed. For the arithmetic mean, the speed of each portion of the trip is weighted by the duration of that portion, while for the harmonic mean, the corresponding weight is the distance.  In both cases, the resulting formula reduces to dividing the total distance by the total time.)

However one may avoid the use of the harmonic mean for the case of "weighting by distance". Pose the problem as finding "slowness" of the trip where "slowness" (in hours per kilometre) is the inverse of speed. When trip slowness is found, invert it so as to find the "true" average trip speed. For each trip segment i, the slowness s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/speed&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Then take the weighted [[arithmetic mean]] of the s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s weighted by their respective distances (optionally with the weights normalized so they sum to 1 by dividing them by trip length). This gives the true average slowness (in time per kilometre). It turns out that this procedure, which can be done with no knowledge of the harmonic mean, amounts to the same mathematical operations as one would use in solving this problem by using the harmonic mean. Thus it illustrates why the harmonic mean works in this case.

====Density====
Similarly, if one wishes to estimate the density of an [[alloy]] given the densities of its constituent elements and their mass fractions (or, equivalently, percentages by mass), then the predicted density of the alloy (exclusive of typically minor volume changes due to atom packing effects) is the weighted harmonic mean of the individual densities, weighted by mass, rather than the weighted arithmetic mean as one might at first expect. To use the weighted arithmetic mean, the densities would have to be weighted by volume. Applying [[dimensional analysis]] to the problem while labelling the mass units by element and making sure that only like element-masses cancel, makes this clear.

====Electricity====
If one connects two electrical [[resistor]]s in parallel, one having resistance ''x'' (e.g., 60 [[Ohm|Ω]]) and one having resistance ''y'' (e.g., 40 Ω), then the effect is the same as if one had used two resistors with the same resistance, both equal to the harmonic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (48 Ω): the equivalent resistance, in either case, is 24 Ω (one-half of the harmonic mean). This same principle applies to [[capacitor]]s in series or to [[inductor]]s in parallel.

However, if one connects the resistors in series, then the average resistance is the arithmetic mean of ''x'' and ''y'' (with total resistance equal to the sum of x and y). As with the previous example, the same principle applies when more than two resistors are connected, provided that all are in parallel or all are in series.

The "conductivity effective mass" of a semiconductor is also defined as the harmonic mean of the effective masses along the three crystallographic directions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm|title=Effective mass in semiconductors|author=|date=|website=ecee.colorado.edu|accessdate=8 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020040802/http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bart/book/effmass.htm|archivedate=20 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In finance===
The weighted harmonic mean is the preferable method for averaging multiples, such as the [[price–earnings ratio]] (P/E), in which price is in the numerator. If these ratios are averaged using a weighted arithmetic mean (a common error), high data points are given greater weights than low data points. The weighted harmonic mean, on the other hand, gives equal weight to each data point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Fairness Opinions: Common Errors and Omissions |title=The Handbook of Business Valuation and Intellectual Property Analysis |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-142967-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The simple weighted arithmetic mean when applied to non-price normalized ratios such as the P/E is biased upwards and cannot be numerically justified, since it is based on equalized earnings; just as vehicles speeds cannot be averaged for a roundtrip journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Using the Price-to-Earnings Harmonic Mean to Improve Firm Valuation Estimates |first=Pankaj |last=Agrrawal |first2=Richard |last2=Borgman |first3=John M. |last3=Clark |first4=Robert |last4=Strong |journal=[[Journal of Financial Education]] |volume=36 |year=2010 |issue=3–4 |pages=98–110 |jstor=41948650 |ssrn=2621087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, consider two firms, one with a [[market capitalization]] of $150 billion and earnings of $5 billion (P/E of 30) and one with a market capitalization of $1 billion and earnings of $1 million (P/E of 1000). Consider an [[Index (finance)|index]] made of the two stocks, with 30% invested in the first and 70% invested in the second. We want to calculate the P/E ratio of this index.

Using the weighted arithmetic mean (incorrect):
: &lt;math&gt;P/E = 0.3 \times 30 + 0.7 \times 1000 = 709&lt;/math&gt;

Using the weighted harmonic mean (correct):
: &lt;math&gt;P/E = \frac{0.3 + 0.7}{0.3/30 + 0.7/1000} \approx 93.46&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the correct P/E of 93.46 of this index can only be found using the weighted harmonic mean, while the weighted arithmetic mean will significantly overestimate it.

===In geometry===
In any [[triangle]], the radius of the [[incircle and excircles of a triangle|incircle]] is one-third of the harmonic mean of the [[Altitude (triangle)|altitudes]].

For any point P on the [[Arc (geometry)|minor arc]] BC of the [[circumcircle]] of an [[equilateral triangle]] ABC, with distances ''q'' and ''t'' from B and C respectively, and with the intersection of PA and BC being at a distance ''y'' from point P, we have that ''y'' is half the harmonic mean of ''q'' and ''t''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Posamentier |first=Alfred S. |last2=Salkind |first2=Charles T. |title=Challenging Problems in Geometry |edition=Second |publisher=Dover |location= |year=1996 |page=172 |isbn=0-486-69154-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C53dCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA172 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[right triangle]] with legs ''a'' and ''b'' and [[Altitude (triangle)|altitude]] ''h'' from the [[hypotenuse]] to the right angle, {{math|''h''²}} is half the harmonic mean of {{math|''a''²}} and {{math|''b''²}}.&lt;ref&gt;Voles, Roger, "Integer solutions of &lt;math&gt;a^{-2}+b^{-2}=d^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;," ''Mathematical Gazette'' 83, July 1999, 269–271.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richinick, Jennifer, "The upside-down Pythagorean Theorem," ''Mathematical Gazette'' 92, July 2008, 313–;317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Let ''t'' and ''s'' (''t'' &gt; ''s'') be the sides of the two [[Triangle#Squares|inscribed squares in a right triangle]] with hypotenuse ''c''. Then {{math|''s''²}} equals half the harmonic mean of {{math|''c''²}} and {{math|''t''²}}.

Let a [[trapezoid]] have vertices A, B, C, and D in sequence and have parallel sides AB and CD. Let E be the intersection of the [[diagonal]]s, and let F be on side DA and G be on side BC such that FEG is parallel to AB and CD. Then FG is the harmonic mean of AB and DC. (This is provable using similar triangles.)

[[File:CrossedLadders.png|thumb|right|Crossed ladders. ''h'' is half the harmonic mean of ''A'' and ''B'']]
One application of this trapezoid result is in the [[crossed ladders problem]], where two ladders lie oppositely across an alley, each with feet at the base of one sidewall, with one leaning against a wall at height ''A'' and the other leaning against the opposite wall at height ''B'', as shown. The ladders cross at a height of ''h'' above the alley floor. Then ''h'' is half the harmonic mean of ''A'' and ''B''. This result still holds if the walls are slanted but still parallel and the "heights" ''A'', ''B'', and ''h'' are measured as distances from the floor along lines parallel to the walls.

In an [[ellipse]], the [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion#Mathematics of the three laws|semi-latus rectum]] (the distance from a focus to the ellipse along a line parallel to the minor axis) is the harmonic mean of the maximum and minimum distances of the ellipse from a focus.

=== In other sciences ===
In [[computer science]], specifically [[information retrieval]] and [[machine learning]], the harmonic mean of the [[Precision and recall|precision]] (true positives per predicted positive) and the [[Precision and recall|recall]] (true positives per real positive) is often used as an aggregated performance score for the evaluation of algorithms and systems: the [[F1 score|F-score]] (or F-measure). This is used in information retrieval because only the positive class is of [[relevance]], while number of negatives, in general, is large and unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Rijsbergen | first = C. J. | url = http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/Keith/Preface.html | year = 1979 | title = Information Retrieval | edition = 2nd | publisher = Butterworth | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050406090119/http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/Keith/Preface.html | archivedate = 2005-04-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus a trade-off as to whether the correct positive predictions should be measured in relation to the number of predicted positives or the number of real positives, so it is measured versus a putative number of positives that is an arithmetic mean of the two possible denominators.

A consequence arises from basic algebra in problems where people or systems work together. As an example, if a gas-powered pump can drain a pool in 4 hours and a battery-powered pump can drain the same pool in 6 hours, then it will take both pumps {{math|{{sfrac|6·4|6 + 4}}}}, which is equal to 2.4 hours, to drain the pool together. This is one-half of the harmonic mean of 6 and 4: {{math|{{sfrac|2·6·4|6 + 4}} {{=}} 4.8}}. That is the appropriate average for the two types of pump is the harmonic mean, and with one pair of pumps (two pumps), it takes half this harmonic mean time, while with two pairs of pumps (four pumps) it would take a quarter of this harmonic mean time.

In [[hydrology]], the harmonic mean is similarly used to average [[hydraulic conductivity]] values for a flow that is perpendicular to layers (e.g., geologic or soil) - flow parallel to layers uses the arithmetic mean. This apparent difference in averaging is explained by the fact that hydrology uses conductivity, which is the inverse of resistivity.

In [[sabermetrics]], a player's [[Power–speed number]] is the harmonic mean of their [[home run]] and [[stolen base]] totals.

In [[population genetics]], the harmonic mean is used when calculating the effects of fluctuations in generation size on the effective breeding population. This is to take into account the fact that a very small generation is effectively like a [[wikt: bottleneck|bottleneck]] and means that a very small number of individuals are contributing disproportionately to the [[gene pool]], which can result in higher levels of [[inbreeding]].

When considering [[fuel economy in automobiles]] two measures are commonly used – miles per gallon (mpg), and litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km. As the dimensions of these quantities are the inverse of each other (one is distance per volume, the other volume per distance) when taking the mean value of the fuel economy of a range of cars one measure will produce the harmonic mean of the other – i.e., converting the mean value of fuel economy expressed in litres per 100&amp;nbsp;km to miles per gallon will produce the harmonic mean of the fuel economy expressed in miles-per-gallon.

In [[chemistry]] and [[nuclear physics]] the average mass per particle of a mixture consisting of different species (e.g., molecules or isotopes) is given by the harmonic mean of the individual species' masses weighted by their respective mass fraction.

==Beta distribution==
[[File:Harmonic mean for Beta distribution for alpha and beta ranging from 0 to 5 - J. Rodal.jpg|thumb|Harmonic mean for Beta distribution for 0 &lt; α &lt; 5 and 0 &lt; β &lt; 5]]
[[File:(Mean - HarmonicMean) for Beta distribution versus alpha and beta from 0 to 2 - J. Rodal.jpg|thumb|(Mean - HarmonicMean) for Beta distribution versus alpha and beta from 0 to 2]]
[[File: Harmonic Means for Beta distribution Purple=H(X), Yellow=H(1-X), smaller values alpha and beta in front - J. Rodal.jpg|thumb|Harmonic Means for Beta distribution Purple=H(X), Yellow=H(1-X), smaller values alpha and beta in front]]
[[File: Harmonic Means for Beta distribution Purple=H(X), Yellow=H(1-X), larger values alpha and beta in front - J. Rodal.jpg|thumb|Harmonic Means for Beta distribution Purple=H(X), Yellow=H(1-X), larger values alpha and beta in front]]

The harmonic mean of a [[beta distribution]] with shape parameters ''α'' and ''β'' is:

:&lt;math&gt;H = \frac{\alpha - 1}{\alpha + \beta - 1} \text{ conditional on } \alpha &gt; 1 \, \, \&amp; \, \, \beta &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

The harmonic mean with ''α'' &lt; 1 is undefined because its defining expression is not bounded in [0, 1].

Letting ''α'' = ''β''

: &lt;math&gt;H = \frac{\alpha - 1}{2 \alpha - 1}&lt;/math&gt;

showing that for ''α'' = ''β'' the harmonic mean ranges from 0 for ''α'' = ''β'' = 1, to 1/2 for ''α'' = ''β'' → ∞.

The following are the limits with one parameter finite (non-zero) and the other parameter approaching these limits:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \lim_{\alpha \to 0} H &amp;= \text{ undefined } \\
  \lim_{\alpha \to 1} H &amp;= \lim_{\beta \to \infty}  H = 0 \\
  \lim_{\beta \to 0}  H &amp;= \lim_{\alpha \to \infty} H = 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

With the geometric mean the harmonic mean may be useful in maximum likelihood estimation in the four parameter case.

A second harmonic mean (''H''&lt;sub&gt;1 − X&lt;/sub&gt;) also exists for this distribution

:&lt;math&gt;H_{1-X} =  \frac{\beta - 1}{\alpha + \beta - 1} \text{ conditional on } \beta &gt; 1 \, \, \&amp; \, \, \alpha &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;

This harmonic mean with ''β'' &lt; 1 is undefined because its defining expression is not bounded in [ 0, 1 ].

Letting ''α'' = ''β'' in the above expression

:&lt;math&gt;H_{1-X} = \frac{\beta - 1}{2 \beta - 1} &lt;/math&gt;

showing that for ''α'' = ''β'' the harmonic mean ranges from 0, for ''α'' = ''β'' = 1, to 1/2, for ''α'' = ''β'' → ∞.

The following are the limits with one parameter finite (non zero) and the other approaching these limits:

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \lim_{\beta \to 0}  H_{1-X} &amp;= \text{ undefined } \\
  \lim_{\beta \to 1}  H_{1-X} &amp;= \lim_{\alpha \to \infty} H_{1-X} = 0 \\
  \lim_{\alpha \to 0} H_{1-X} &amp;= \lim_{\beta \to \infty}  H_{1-X} = 1
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Although both harmonic means are asymmetric, when ''α'' = ''β'' the two means are equal.

==Lognormal distribution==

The harmonic mean ( ''H'' ) of a [[lognormal distribution]] is&lt;ref name=Aitchison1969&gt;Aitchison J, Brown JAC (1969). The lognormal distribution with special reference to its uses in economics. Cambridge University Press, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;H = \exp \left( \mu - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''μ'' is the arithmetic mean and ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the distribution.

The harmonic and arithmetic means are related by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\mu}{H} = 1 + C_v \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[coefficient of variation]].

The geometric (''G''), arithmetic and harmonic means are related by&lt;ref name=Rossman1990&gt;Rossman LA (1990) Design stream flows based on harmonic means. J Hydr Eng ASCE 116(7) 946–950&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;H \mu = G^2.&lt;/math&gt;

==Pareto distribution==

The harmonic mean of type 1 [[Pareto distribution]] is&lt;ref name=Johnson1994&gt;Johnson NL, Kotz S, Balakrishnan N (1994) Continuous univariate distributions Vol 1. Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;H = k \left( 1 + \frac{1}{\alpha} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' is the scale parameter and ''α'' is the shape parameter.

==Statistics==

For a random sample, the harmonic mean is calculated as above. Both the [[Expected value|mean]] and the [[variance]] may be [[Infinity|infinite]] (if it includes at least one term of the form 1/0).

===Sample distributions of mean and variance===

The mean of the sample ''m'' is  asymptotically distributed normally with variance ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = \frac{m \left[\operatorname{E}\left(\frac{1}{x} - 1\right)\right]}{m^2 n}&lt;/math&gt;

The variance of the mean itself is&lt;ref name=Zelen1972&gt;Zelen M (1972) Length-biased sampling and biomedical problems. In: Biometric Society Meeting, Dallas, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) = \frac{m \left[\operatorname{E}\left(\frac{1}{x} - 1\right)\right]}{n m^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals, ''x'' are the variates, ''n'' is the population size and ''E'' is the expectation operator.

===Delta method===

Assuming that the variance is not infinite and that the [[central limit theorem]] applies to the sample then using the [[delta method]], the variance is

: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var}(H) = \frac{1}{n}\frac{s^2}{m^4}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''H'' is the harmonic mean, ''m'' is the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals

: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{1}{n} \sum{ \frac{1}{x} }.&lt;/math&gt;

''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance of the reciprocals of the data

: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = \operatorname{Var}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and ''n'' is the number of data points in the sample.

===Jackknife method===

A [[resampling (statistics)#Jackknife|jackknife]] method of estimating the variance is possible if the mean is known.&lt;ref name=Lam1985&gt;Lam FC (1985) Estimate of variance for harmonic mean half lives. J Pharm Sci 74(2) 229-231&lt;/ref&gt; This method is the usual 'delete 1' rather than the 'delete m' version.

This method first requires the computation of the mean of the sample (''m'')
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{n}{ \sum{ \frac{1}{x} } }&lt;/math&gt;

where ''x'' are the sample values.

A series of value ''w&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is then computed where
: &lt;math&gt;w_i = \frac{n - 1}{ \sum_{j \neq i} \frac{1}{x} }.&lt;/math&gt;

The mean (''h'') of the ''w''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is then taken:
: &lt;math&gt;h = \frac{1}{n} \sum{w_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The variance of the mean is
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{n - 1}{n} \sum{(m - h)}^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Significance testing and [[confidence interval]]s for the mean can then be estimated with the [[t test]].

===Size biased sampling===

Assume a random variate has a distribution ''f''( ''x'' ). Assume also that the likelihood of a variate being chosen is proportional to its value. This is known as length based or size biased sampling.

Let ''μ'' be the mean of the population. Then the [[probability density function]] ''f''*( ''x'' ) of the size biased population is
: &lt;math&gt;f^*(x) = \frac{x f(x)}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;

The expectation of this length biased distribution E&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;( ''x'' ) is&lt;ref name="Zelen1972"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}^*(x) = \mu \left[ 1 + \frac{\sigma^2}{\mu^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the variance.

The expectation of the harmonic mean is the same as the non-length biased version E( ''x'' )
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}^* \left( \frac{1}{x} \right) = \operatorname{E}\left( \frac{1}{x} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The problem of length biased sampling arises in a number of areas including textile manufacture&lt;ref name=Cox1969&gt;Cox DR (1969) Some sampling problems in technology. In: New developments in survey sampling. U.L. Johnson, H Smith eds. New York: Wiley Interscience&lt;/ref&gt; pedigree analysis&lt;ref name=Davidov2001&gt;Davidov O, Zelen M (2001) Referent sampling, family history and relative risk: the role of length‐biased sampling. Biostat 2(2): 173-181 doi: 10.1093/biostatistics/2.2.173&lt;/ref&gt; and survival analysis&lt;ref name=Zelen1969&gt;Zelen M, Feinleib M (1969) On the theory of screening for chronic diseases. Biometrika 56: 601-614&lt;/ref&gt;

Akman ''et al'' have developed a test for the detection of length based bias in samples.&lt;ref name=Akman2007&gt;Akman O, Gamage J, Jannot J, Juliano S, Thurman A, Whitman D (2007) A simple test for detection of length-biased sampling. J Biostats 1 (2) 189-195&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shifted variables===

If ''X'' is a positive random variable and ''q'' &gt; 0 then for all ''ε'' &gt; 0&lt;ref name=Chuen-Teck2008&gt;Chuen-Teck See, Chen J (2008) Convex functions of random variables. J Inequal Pure Appl Math 9 (3) Art 80&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Var} \left[\frac{1}{(X + \epsilon)^q}\right] &lt; \operatorname{Var} \left(\frac{1}{X^q}\right) .&lt;/math&gt;

===Moments===

Assuming that ''X'' and E(''X'') are &gt; 0 then&lt;ref name="Chuen-Teck2008"/&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}\left[ \frac{1}{X} \right] \ge \frac{1}{ \operatorname{E}(X) }&lt;/math&gt;

This follows from [[Jensen's inequality]].

Gurland has shown that&lt;ref name=Gurland1967&gt;Gurland J (1967) An inequality satisfied by the expectation of the reciprocal of a random variable. The American Statistician. 21 (2) 24&lt;/ref&gt; for a distribution that takes only positive values, for any ''n'' &gt; 0
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E} \left(X^{-1}\right) \ge \frac{\operatorname{E} \left(X^{n-1}\right)}{\operatorname{E}\left(X^n\right)} .&lt;/math&gt;

Under some conditions&lt;ref name=Sung2010&gt;Sung SH (2010) On inverse moments for a class of nonnegative random variables. J Inequal Applic doi:10.1155/2010/823767&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{E}(a + X)^{-n} \sim \operatorname{E}\left(a + X^{-n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where ~ means approximately.

===Sampling properties===

Assuming that the variates (''x'') are drawn from a lognormal distribution there are several possible estimators for ''H'':

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  H_1 &amp;= \frac{n}{ \sum\left(\frac{1}{x}\right) } \\
  H_2 &amp;= \frac{\left( \exp\left[ \frac{1}{n} \sum \log_e(x) \right] \right)^2}{ \frac{1}{n} \sum(x) } \\
  H_3 &amp;= \exp \left(m - \frac{1}{2} s^2 \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where
: &lt;math&gt;m = \frac{1}{n} \sum \log_e (x)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;s^2 = \frac{1}{n} \sum \left(\log_e (x) - m\right)^2&lt;/math&gt;

Of these ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is probably the best estimator for samples of 25 or more.&lt;ref name=Stedinger1980&gt;Stedinger JR (1980) Fitting lognormal distributions to hydrologic data. Water Resour Res 16(3) 481–490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bias and variance estimators===

A first order approximation to the [[bias]] and variance of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are&lt;ref name=Limbrunner2000&gt;Limbrunner JF, Vogel RM, Brown LC (2000) Estimation of harmonic mean of a lognormal variable. J Hydrol Eng 5(1) 59-66 {{cite web |url=http://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/people/vogel/publications/estimation-harmonic.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611205528/http://engineering.tufts.edu/cee/people/vogel/publications/estimation-harmonic.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \operatorname{bias}\left[ H_1 \right] &amp;= \frac{H C_v}{n} \\
   \operatorname{Var}\left[ H_1 \right] &amp;= \frac{H^2 C_v}{n}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''C''&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is the coefficient of variation.

Similarly a first order approximation to the bias and variance of ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are&lt;ref name="Limbrunner2000"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  \frac{H \log_e \left(1 + C_v\right)}{2n} \left[ 1 + \frac{1 + C_v^2}{2} \right] \\
  \frac{H \log_e \left(1 + C_v\right)}{n} \left[ 1 + \frac{1 + C_v^2}{4} \right]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It has been found in numerical experiments that ''H''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is generally a superior estimator of the harmonic mean than ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Limbrunner2000"/&gt; ''H''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produces estimates that are largely similar to ''H''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

In [[computer science]], a '''holographic algorithm''' is an algorithm that uses a holographic reduction. A holographic reduction is a constant-time [[Reduction (complexity)|reduction]] that maps solution fragments many-to-many such that the sum of the solution fragments remains unchanged. These concepts were introduced by [[Leslie Valiant]], who called them ''holographic'' because "their effect can be viewed as that of producing interference patterns among the solution fragments".&lt;ref name="valiant"&gt;{{cite conference

&lt;/ref&gt; The algorithms are unrelated to laser [[holography]], except metaphorically. Their power comes from the mutual cancellation of many contributions to a sum, analogous to the interference patterns in a hologram.&lt;ref name="americanscientist"/&gt;

Holographic algorithms have been used to find [[P (complexity)|polynomial-time]] solutions to problems without such previously known solutions for special cases of [[Boolean satisfiability problem|satisfiability]], [[vertex cover]], and other [[graph theory|graph problems]].&lt;ref name="art"/&gt; They have received notable coverage due to speculation that they are relevant to the [[P versus NP problem]]&lt;ref name="americanscientist"&gt;{{cite journal

Although some of the general problems are [[Sharp-P|#P-hard]] problems, the special cases solved are not themselves #P-hard, and thus do not prove FP = #P.

==Holant problems==
Holographic algorithms exist in the context of Holant problems, which generalize counting [[constraint satisfaction problem]]s (#CSP). A #CSP instance is a [[hypergraph]] ''G''=(''V'',''E'') called the [[constraint graph]]. Each hyperedge represents a variable and each vertex &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is assigned a constraint &lt;math&gt;f_v.&lt;/math&gt; A vertex is connected to an hyperedge if the constraint on the vertex involves the variable on the hyperedge. The counting problem is to compute
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{\sigma : E \to \{0,1\}} \prod_{v \in V} f_v(\sigma|_{E(v)}),~~~~~~~~~~(1)&lt;/math&gt;
which is a sum over all variable assignments, the product of every constraint, where the inputs to the constrain &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt; are the variables on the incident hyperedges of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.

A Holant problem is like a #CSP except the input must be a graph, not a hypergraph. Restricting the class of input graphs in this way is indeed a generalization. Given a #CSP instance, replace each hyperedge ''e'' of size ''s'' with a vertex ''v'' of degree ''s'' with edges incident to the vertices contained in ''e''. The constraint on ''v'' is the equality function of arity ''s''.  This identifies all of the variables on the edges incident to ''v'', which is the same effect as the single variable on the hyperedge ''e''.

In the context of Holant problems, the expression in (1) is called the Holant after a related exponential sum introduced by Valiant.&lt;ref name="fibonacci"&gt;{{cite conference

==Holographic reduction==
A standard technique in complexity theory is a [[many-one reduction]], where an instance of one problem is reduced to an instance of another (hopefully simpler) problem.
However, holographic reductions between two computational problems preserve the sum of solutions without necessarily preserving correspondences between solutions.&lt;ref name="valiant"/&gt;  For instance, the total number of solutions in both sets can be preserved, even though individual problems do not have matching solutions. The sum can also be weighted, rather than simply counting the number of solutions, using [[Basis (linear algebra)|linear basis vectors]].&lt;ref name="art"&gt;{{cite journal

===General example===
It is convenient to consider holographic reductions on bipartite graphs. A general graph can always be transformed it into a bipartite graph while preserving the Holant value. This is done by replacing each edge in the graph by a path of length 2, which is also known as the 2-stretch of the graph. To keep the same Holant value, each new vertex is assigned the binary equality constraint.

Consider a bipartite graph ''G''=(''U'',''V'',''E'') where the constraint assigned to every vertex &lt;math&gt;u \in U&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; and the constraint assigned to every vertex &lt;math&gt;v \in V&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt;. Denote this counting problem by &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v).&lt;/math&gt; If the vertices in ''U'' are viewed as one large vertex of degree |''E''|, then the constraint of this vertex is the [[tensor product]] of &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; with itself |''U''| times, which is denoted by &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|}.&lt;/math&gt; Likewise, if the vertices in ''V'' are viewed as one large vertex of degree |''E''|, then the constraint of this vertex is &lt;math&gt;f_v^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt; Let the constraint &lt;math&gt;f_u&lt;/math&gt; be represented by its weighted [[truth table]] as a row vector and the constraint &lt;math&gt;f_v&lt;/math&gt; be represented by its weighted truth table as a column vector. Then the Holant of this constraint graph is simply &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now for any complex 2-by-2 [[invertible matrix]] ''T'' (the columns of which are the linear basis vectors mentioned above), there is a holographic reduction between &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}, (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)} f_v).&lt;/math&gt; To see this, insert the identity matrix &lt;math&gt;T^{\otimes |E|} (T^{-1})^{\otimes |E|}&lt;/math&gt; in between &lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt; to get
:&lt;math&gt;f_u^{\otimes |U|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= f_u^{\otimes |U|} T^{\otimes |E|} (T^{-1})^{\otimes |E|} f_v^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left(f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}\right)^{\otimes |U|} \left(f_v (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)}\right)^{\otimes |V|}.&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u, f_v)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(G, f_u T^{\otimes (\deg u)}, (T^{-1})^{\otimes (\deg v)} f_v)&lt;/math&gt; have exactly the same Holant value for every constraint graph. They essentially define the same counting problem.

===Specific examples===

====Vertex covers and independent sets====
Let ''G'' be a graph. There is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the [[vertex cover]]s of ''G'' and the [[Independent set (graph theory)|independent set]]s of ''G''. For any set ''S'' of vertices of ''G'', ''S'' is a vertex cover in ''G'' if and only if the [[Complement (set theory)|complement]] of ''S'' is an independent set in ''G''. Thus, the number of vertex covers in ''G'' is exactly the same as the number of independent sets in ''G''.

The equivalence of these two counting problems can also be proved using a holographic reduction. For simplicity, let ''G'' be a 3-[[regular graph]]. The 2-stretch of ''G'' gives a bipartite graph ''H''=(''U'',''V'',''E''), where ''U'' corresponds to the edges in ''G'' and ''V'' corresponds to the vertices in ''G''. The Holant problem that naturally corresponds to counting the number of vertex covers in ''G'' is &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(H, \text{OR}_2, \text{EQUAL}_3).&lt;/math&gt; The truth table of OR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a row vector is (0,1,1,1). The truth table of EQUAL&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as a column vector is &lt;math&gt;(1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1)^T = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}&lt;/math&gt;. Then under a holographic transformation by &lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix},&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\text{OR}_2^{\otimes |U|} \text{EQUAL}_3^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (0,1,1,1)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (0,1,1,1)^{\otimes |U|} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes |E|} \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes |E|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \left((0,1,1,1) \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 2}\right)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}\right)^{\otimes 3} + \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\right)^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= (1,1,1,0)^{\otimes |U|} \left(\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3} + \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}^{\otimes 3}\right)^{\otimes |V|}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;= \text{NAND}_2^{\otimes |U|} \text{EQUAL}_3^{\otimes |V|},&lt;/math&gt;
which is &lt;math&gt;\text{Holant}(H, \text{NAND}_2, \text{EQUAL}_3),&lt;/math&gt; the Holant problem that naturally corresponds to counting the number of independent sets in ''G''.

==History==
As with any type of reduction, a holographic reduction does not, by itself, yield a polynomial time algorithm. In order to get a polynomial time algorithm, the problem being reduced to must also have a polynomial time algorithm. Valiant's original application of holographic algorithms used a holographic reduction to a problem where every constraint is realizable by [[matchgates]],&lt;ref name="valiant"/&gt; which he had just proved is tractable by a further reduction to counting the number of [[perfect matching]]s in a [[planar graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter problem is tractable by the [[FKT algorithm]], which dates to the 1960s.

Soon after, Valiant found holographic algorithms with reductions to matchgates for #[[modulo operation|&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;]][[Planar graph|Pl]]-Rtw-[[Monotonic function#Boolean functions|Mon]]-3[[Conjunctive normal form|CNF]] and #&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-3/2[[bipartite graph|Bip]]-[[vertex cover|VC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These problems may appear somewhat contrived, especially with respect to the [[Modular arithmetic|modulus]]. Both problems were already known to be #P-hard when ignoring the modulus and Valiant supplied proofs of #P-hardness modulo 2, which also used holographic reductions. Valiant found these two problems by a computer search that looked for problems with holographic reductions to matchgates. He called their algorithms ''accidental algorithms'', saying "when applying the term accidental to an algorithm we intend to point out that the algorithm arises from satisfying an apparently onerous set of constraints." The "onerous" set of constraints in question are polynomial equations that, if satisfied, imply the existence of a holographic reduction to matchgate realizable constraints.

After several years of developing (what is known as) matchgate signature theory, Jin-Yi Cai and Pinyan Lu were able to explain the existence of Valiant's two accidental algorithms.&lt;ref name="art"/&gt;  These two problems are just special cases of two much larger families of problems: #&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-Rtw-Mon-kCNF and #&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;Pl-k/2Bip-VC for any positive integer ''k''. The modulus 7 is just the third [[Mersenne number]] and Cai and Lu showed that these types of problems with parameter ''k'' can be solved in polynomial time exactly when the modulus is the ''k''th Mersenne number by using holographic reductions to matchgates and the [[Chinese remainder theorem]].

Around the same time, Jin-Yi Cai, Pinyan Lu and Mingji Xia gave the first holographic algorithm that did not reduce to a problem that is tractable by matchgates.&lt;ref name="fibonacci"/&gt; Instead, they reduced to a problem that is tractable by Fibonacci gates, which are [[symmetric function|symmetric]] constraints whose truth tables satisfy a [[recurrence relation]] similar to one that defines the [[Fibonacci number]]s. They also used holographic reductions to prove that certain counting problems are #P-hard. Since then, holographic reductions have been used extensively as ingredients in both polynomial time algorithms and proofs of #P-hardness.

The '''Institute for Quantum Computing''' ('''IQC''') is an affiliate scientific research institute of the [[University of Waterloo]] in located in [[Waterloo, Ontario]] with a multidisciplinary approach to the field of [[quantum information processing]]. IQC was founded in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca/news-events/archive/what-great-philanthropy-can-do|title=What Great Philanthropy Can Do|publisher=Institute for Quantum Computing|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; primarily through a donation made by [[Mike Lazaridis]] and his wife Ophelia whose substantial donations have continued over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/about/quick-facts |title=Quick facts About the Institute |author=no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=University of Waterloo |publisher=University of Waterloo |access-date=23 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The institute is now located in the [[Mike &amp; Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre]] and the Research Advancement Centre at the University of Waterloo.

It is led by founder and physicist, [[Raymond Laflamme]] with researchers based in 6 departments across 3 faculties at the University of Waterloo. In addition to theoretical and experimental research on [[quantum computer|quantum computing]], IQC also hosts academic conferences and workshops, short courses for undergraduate and high school students, and scientific outreach events including open houses and tours for the public.

==Mission==
The IQC seeks to harness quantum mechanics to develop transformational technologies that will benefit society and become a new engine of economic development in the 21st century. It aims to develop and advance quantum information science and technology at the highest international level through the collaboration of computer scientists, engineers, mathematicians and physical scientists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca/institute/strategic-direction|title=Strategic Direction|publisher=Institute for Quantum Computing|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute's three strategic objectives have been stated as:
#To establish Waterloo as a world-class centre for research in quantum technologies and their applications.
#To become a magnet for highly qualified personnel in the field of quantum information.
#To establish IQC as the authoritative source of insight, analysis and commentary on quantum information.

==History==
The Institute for Quantum Computing was officially created in 2002, sparked by [[Research In Motion]] co-founder [[Mike Lazaridis]] and then-president of the University of Waterloo, [[David Johnston]], for research into quantum information. Since inception, Lazaridis has provided more than $100 million in private funding for IQC. The institute is a collaboration between academia, the private sector, and the federal and provincial governments. [[Raymond Laflamme]] is the founding executive director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca/institute|title=About the Institute|publisher=Institute for Quantum Computing|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its establishment, the institute was composed of only a handful of researchers from the Departments of Computer Science and Physics. Ten years later, there are more than 200 researchers across six departments within the Faculties of Science, Mathematics, and Engineering at the University of Waterloo.

In 2008, IQC moved into the Research Advancement Centre 1 (RAC I) in the University of Waterloo's Research &amp; Technology Park. In 2010, research operations expanded into the adjacent building, Research Advancement Centre 2 (RAC II).

In 2012, IQC expanded into the Mike &amp; Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum-Nano Centre. The 285,000-square-foot facility is shared with the [[Waterloo Institute for Nanotechnology]], and is built to stringent standards (controls for vibration, humidity, temperature, and electromagnetic radiation) for quantum and nanotechnology experiments. The building was designed by Toronto-based firm [[KPMB Architects|Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kpmbarchitects.com/index.asp?navid=30&amp;fid1=&amp;fid2=40&amp;fid3=13&amp;minyearx=2011&amp;maxyearx=2012|title=University of Waterloo Mike and Ophelia Lazaridis Quantum Nano Centre|publisher=Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research at IQC focuses on three main applications of quantum information science and technology using the physical sciences, mathematics and engineering from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. The three applications are [[quantum computer|quantum computing]], which encompasses the manipulation and storage of quantum information; [[quantum channel|quantum communication]], which is related to the transmission of quantum information; and [[quantum sensor|quantum sensing]], which is used to detect signals or stimuli that are present in the nanoscopic world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iqc.uwaterloo.ca/faculty-research|title=Faculty &amp; Research|publisher=Institute for Quantum Computing|accessdate=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Areas of research currently studied at IQC include:
* Nanoelectronics-based quantum information processing
* [[Quantum algorithm]]s
* [[Quantum complexity theory|Quantum complexity]]

QUANTUM: The Exhibition is the first-ever travelling show on quantum information science and technology. Throughout 2017, visitors to science centres and museums across the country can explore how researchers are merging quantum mechanics and information technology to create the technologies that will revolutionize and redefine the 21st century—and how many Canadian researchers are leading the way. This exhibition was selected as part of the Signature Initiative of the Government of Canada's sesquicentennial celebration, INNOVATION150, which celebrates 150 years of Canadian innovation.

The Exhibition began its cross-Canada tour with an invitation-only premiere on October 13, 2016 at [[THEMUSEUM]] in downtown [[Kitchener, Ontario]], and will continue on to at least five other cities on its journey including Vancouver, Saskatoon, Calgary, Halifax and Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://innovation150.ca/quantum-exhibition|title=QUANTUM: The Exhibition|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LIGHT Illuminated====

The United Nations (UN) General Assembly named 2015 as the International Year of Light and Light-based Technologies (IYL 2015).  In order to celebrate and educate the public on the physics of light, a group of graduate students from the University of Waterloo Student Chapter of the Optical Society (OSA) created LIGHT Illuminated, an exhibition featured at [[THEMUSEUM]] in downtown [[Kitchener, Ontario]], from October 2015 to March 2016. PhD students from the Institute for Quantum Computing along with a Master’s student from the University of Waterloo Department of Physics and Astronomy created and curated the exhibition. Over 40,000 visitors passed through THEMUSEUM during the exhibit’s display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/blog/post/light-illuminated|title=LIGHT Illuminated|accessdate=14 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30537">'''Intuitionistic type theory''' (also known as '''constructive type theory''', or '''Martin-Löf type theory''') is a [[type theory]] and an alternative [[Foundations of mathematics|foundation of mathematics]].
Intuitionistic type theory was created by [[Per Martin-Löf]], a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[mathematician]] and [[philosopher]], who first published it in 1972.  There are multiple versions of the type theory:  Martin-Löf proposed both [[Intensional logic|intensional]] and [[extensionality|extensional]] variants of the theory and early [[impredicative]] versions, shown to be inconsistent by [[Girard's paradox]], gave way to [[Predicativity|predicative]] versions. However, all versions keep the core design of constructive logic using dependent types.  

==Design==

Martin-Löf designed the type theory on the principles of [[mathematical constructivism]].  Constructivism requires any existence proof to contain a "witness".  So, any proof of "there exists a prime greater than 1000" must identify a specific number that is both prime and greater than 1000.  Intuitionistic type theory accomplished this design goal by internalizing the [[BHK interpretation]].  An interesting consequence is that proofs become mathematical objects that can be examined, compared, and manipulated.

Intuitionistic type theory's type constructors were built to follow a one-to-one correspondence with logical connectives.  For example, the logical connective called implication (&lt;math&gt;A \implies B&lt;/math&gt;) corresponds to the type of a function (&lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;). This correspondence is called the [[Curry–Howard isomorphism]].  Previous type theories had also followed this isomorphism, but Martin-Löf's was the first to extend it to [[predicate logic]] by introducing [[dependent types]].

==Type theory==
Intuitionistic type theory has 3 finite types, which are then composed using 5 different type constructors.  Unlike set theories, type theories are not built on top of a logic like [[First-order logic|Frege's]].  So, each feature of the type theory does double duty as a feature of both math and logic.

''If you are unfamiliar with type theory and know set theory, a quick summary is: Types contain terms just like sets contain elements.  Terms belong to one and only one type.  Terms like &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; compute ("reduce") down to canonical terms like 4.  For more, see the article on [[Type theory]].''

===0 type, 1 type and 2 type ===

There are 3 finite types:  The '''0''' type contains 0 terms.  The '''1''' type contains 1 canonical term.  And the '''2''' type contains 2 canonical terms.

Because the '''0''' type contains 0 terms, it is also called the [[empty type]].  It is used to represent anything that cannot exist.  It is also written &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and represents anything unprovable.  (That is, a proof of it cannot exist.)  As a result, [[negation]] is defined as a function to it: &lt;math&gt;\neg A := A \to \bot&lt;/math&gt;.

Likewise, the '''1''' type contains 1 canonical term and represents existence.  It also is called the [[unit type]].  It often represents propositions that can be proven and is, therefore, sometimes written &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;.  

Finally, the '''2''' type contains 2 canonical terms.  It represents a definite choice between two values.  It is used for [[Boolean Algebra|Boolean values]] but ''not'' propositions.  Propositions may be proven (the '''1''' type), may be proven to never have a proof (the '''0''' type), or may not be proven either way.  (The [[Law of excluded middle|Law of Excluded Middle]] does not hold for propositions in intuitionistic type theory.)

===Σ type constructor===

Σ-types contain ordered pairs. As with typical ordered pair (or 2-tuple) types, a Σ-type can describe the [[Cartesian product|cartesian product]], &lt;math&gt;A \times B&lt;/math&gt;, of two other types, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. Logically, such an ordered pair would hold a proof of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and a proof of &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, so one may see such a type written as &lt;math&gt;A \wedge B&lt;/math&gt;.

Σ-types are more powerful than typical ordered pair types because of [[Dependent type|dependent typing]]. In the ordered pair, the type of the second term can depend on the value of the first term.  For example, the first term of the pair might be a natural number and the second term's type might be a vector of length equal to the first term. Such a type would be written:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} \operatorname{Vec}({\mathbb R}, n)&lt;/math&gt;

Using set-theory terminology, this is similar to an indexed [[disjoint union]]s of sets. In the case of usual ordered pairs, the type of the second term does not depend on the value of the first term. Thus the type describing the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N} \times {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;

It is important to note here that the value of the first term, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, is not depended on by the type of the second term, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Obviously, Σ-types can be used to build up longer dependently-typed [[tuple]]s used in mathematics and the [[Record (computer science)|records or structs]] used in most programming languages.  An example of a dependently-typed 3-tuple is two integers and a proof that the first integer is smaller than the second integer, described by the type:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m \mathbin{:} {\mathbb I}} {\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb I}} ((m &lt; n) = \text{True})}&lt;/math&gt;

Dependent typing allows Σ-types to serve the role of existential quantifier.  The statement "there exists an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is proven" becomes the type of ordered pairs where the first item is the value &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and the second item is a proof of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Notice that the type of the second item (proofs of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;) depends on the value in the first part of the ordered pair (&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;). Its type would be: 

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

===Π type constructor===

Π-types contain functions. As with typical function types, they consist of an input type and an output type. They are more powerful than typical function types however, in that the return type can depend on the input value. Functions in type theory are different from set theory.  In set theory, you look up the argument's value in a set of ordered pairs.  In type theory, the argument is substituted into a term and then computation ("reduction") is applied to the term. 
  
As an example, the type of a function that, given a natural number &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, returns a vector containing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; real numbers is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} \operatorname{Vec}({\mathbb R}, n)&lt;/math&gt;

When the output type does not depend on the input value, the function type is often simply written with a &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt; is the type of functions from natural numbers to real numbers. Such Π-types correspond to logical implication. The logical proposition &lt;math&gt;A \implies B&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the type &lt;math&gt;A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, containing functions that take proofs-of-A and return proofs-of-B. This type could be written more consistently as:

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{a \mathbin{:} A} B&lt;/math&gt;

Π-types are also used in logic for universal quantification.  The statement "for every &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt; is proven" becomes a function from &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; of type &lt;math&gt;{\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; to proofs of &lt;math&gt;P(n)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, given the value for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; the function generates a proof that &lt;math&gt;P()&lt;/math&gt; holds for that value. The type would be 

:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

=== = type constructor ===
=-types are created from two terms.  Given two terms like &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;, you can create a new type &lt;math&gt;2+2=2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;.   The terms of that new type represent proofs that the pair reduce to the same canonical term.  Thus, since both &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt; compute to the canonical term &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;, there will be a term of the type &lt;math&gt;2+2=2\cdot 2&lt;/math&gt;.  In intuitionistic type theory, there is a single way to make terms of =-types and that is by [[Reflexive relation|reflexivity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{refl} \mathbin{:} \prod_{a \mathbin{:} A} (a = a).&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible to create =-types such as &lt;math&gt;1=2&lt;/math&gt; where the terms do not reduce to the same canonical term, but you will be unable to create terms of that new type.  In fact, if you were able to create a term of &lt;math&gt;1=2&lt;/math&gt;, you could create a term of &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt;.  Putting that into a function would generating a function of type &lt;math&gt;1=2 \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\ldots \implies \bot&lt;/math&gt; is how intuitionistic type theory defines negation, you would have &lt;math&gt;\neg (1=2)&lt;/math&gt; or, finally, &lt;math&gt;1 \neq 2&lt;/math&gt;.

Equality of proofs is an area of active research in [[Proof theory|proof theory]] and has led to the development of [[homotopy type theory]] and other type theories.

===Inductive types===
{{Main|Inductive type}}

Inductive types allow the creation of complex, self-referential types.  For example, a linked list of natural numbers is either an empty list or a pair of a natural number and another linked list.  Inductive types can be used to define unbounded mathematical structures like trees, graphs, etc..  In fact, the natural numbers type may be defined as an inductive type, either being &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or the [[Successor function|successor]] of another natural number.   

Inductive types define new constants, such as zero &lt;math&gt;0 \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt; and the successor function &lt;math&gt;S \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N} \to {\mathbb N}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; does not have a definition and cannot be evaluated using substitution, terms like &lt;math&gt;S 0&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;S S S 0&lt;/math&gt; become the canonical terms of the natural numbers.  

Proofs on inductive types are made possible by [[Induction, Mathematical|induction]].  Each new inductive type comes with its own inductive rule.  To prove a predicate &lt;math&gt;P()&lt;/math&gt; for every natural number, you use the following rule:

:&lt;math&gt;{\operatorname{{\mathbb N}-elim}}\, \mathbin{:} P(0)\, \to \left(\prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n) \to P(S(n))\right) \to \prod_{n \mathbin{:} {\mathbb N}} P(n)&lt;/math&gt;

Inductive types in intuitionistic type theory are defined in terms of W-types, the type of [[well-founded]] trees.  Later work in type theory generated coinductive types, induction-recursion, and induction-induction for working on types with more obscure kinds of self-referentiality.  [[Higher inductive type|Higher inductive types]] allow equality to be defined between terms.

===Universe types===
The universe types allow proofs to be written about all the types created with the other type constructors.  Every term in the universe type &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt; can be mapped to a type created with any combination of &lt;math&gt;0,1,2,\Sigma,\Pi,=,&lt;/math&gt; and the inductive type constructor.  However, to avoid paradoxes, there is no term in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt; that maps to &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;.  

To write proofs about all "the small types" and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;, you must use &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;, which does contain a term for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_0&lt;/math&gt;, but not for itself &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_1&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, for &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_2&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a [[Impredicativity|predicative]] hierarchy of universes, so to quantify a proof over any fixed constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; universes, you can use &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Universe types are a tricky feature of type theories.  Martin-Löf's original type theory had to be changed to account for [[Girard's paradox]].  Later research covered topics such as "super universes", "Mahlo universes", and impredicative universes.

==Judgements==
The formal definition of intuitionistic type theory is written using judgements.  For example, in the statement "if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a type and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a type then &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{a:A} B&lt;/math&gt; is a type" there are judgements of "is a type", "and", and "if ... then ...".  The expression &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \sum_{a:A} B&lt;/math&gt; is not a judgement; it is the type being defined.  

This second level of the type theory can be confusing, particularly where it comes to equality.    There is a judgement of term equality, which might say &lt;math&gt;4=2+2&lt;/math&gt;.  It is a statement that two terms reduce to the same canonical term.  There is also a judgement of type equality, say that &lt;math&gt;A=B&lt;/math&gt;, which means every element of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and vice versa.  At the type level, there is a type &lt;math&gt;4=2+2&lt;/math&gt; and it contains terms if there is a proof that &lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2+2&lt;/math&gt; reduce to the same value.  (Obviously, terms of this type are generated using the term-equality judgement.)   Lastly, there is an English-language level of equality, because we use the word "four" and symbol "&lt;math&gt;4&lt;/math&gt;" to refer to the canonical term &lt;math&gt;S S S S 0&lt;/math&gt;.  Synonyms like these are called "definitionally equal" by Martin-Löf.

The description of judgements below is based on the discussion in Nordström, Petersson, and Smith.
 
The formal theory works with ''types'' and ''objects''.

A type is declared by:
* &lt;math&gt;A\ \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;
An object exists and is in a type if:
* &lt;math&gt;a \mathbin{:} A &lt;/math&gt;
Objects can be equal
* &lt;math&gt;a = b&lt;/math&gt;
and types can be equal
* &lt;math&gt;A = B&lt;/math&gt;
A type that depends on an object from another type is declared
* &lt;math&gt; (x \mathbin{:} A)B&lt;/math&gt;
and removed by substitution
* &lt;math&gt; B[x / a] &lt;/math&gt;, replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.
An object that depends on an object from another type can be done two ways.
If the object is "abstracted", then it is written
* &lt;math&gt;[x]b&lt;/math&gt;
and removed by substitution
* &lt;math&gt; b[x / a] &lt;/math&gt;, replacing the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; with the object &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.
The object-depending-on-object can also be declared as a constant as part of a recursive type. An example of a recursive type is:
* &lt;math&gt;0 \mathbin{:} \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;S \mathbin{:} \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;
Here, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a constant object-depending-on-object.  It is not associated with an abstraction.
Constants like &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; can be removed by defining equality.  Here the relationship with addition is defined using equality and using pattern matching to handle the recursive aspect of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;:
: &lt;math&gt;
  \begin{align}
    \operatorname{add} &amp;\mathbin{:}\ (\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}) \to \mathbb{N} \\
    \operatorname{add}(0, b) &amp;= b \\
    \operatorname{add}(S(a), b) &amp;= S(\operatorname{add}(a, b)))
  \end{align}
  &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is manipulated as an opaque constant - it has no internal structure for substitution.

So, objects and types and these relations are used to express formulae in the theory.  The following styles of judgements are used to create new objects, types and relations from existing ones:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash \sigma\ \mathsf{Type}&lt;/math&gt;
| ''σ'' is a well-formed type in the context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t \mathbin{:} \sigma&lt;/math&gt;
| ''t'' is a well-formed term of type ''σ'' in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash \sigma \equiv \tau&lt;/math&gt;
| ''σ'' and ''τ'' are equal types in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\vdash t \equiv u \mathbin{:} \sigma&lt;/math&gt;
| ''t'' and ''u'' are judgmentally equal terms of type ''σ'' in context Γ.
|-
| &lt;math&gt;\vdash \Gamma\ \mathsf{Context}&lt;/math&gt;
| Γ is a well-formed context of typing assumptions.
|}

By convention, there is a type that represents all other types.  It is called &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; (or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Set}&lt;/math&gt;).  Since &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; is a type, the member of it are objects.  There is a dependent type &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{El}&lt;/math&gt; that maps each object to its corresponding type.  ''In most texts &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{El}&lt;/math&gt; is never written.''  From the context of the statement, a reader can almost always tell whether &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; refers to a type, or whether it refers to the object in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{U}&lt;/math&gt; that corresponds to the type.

This is the complete foundation of the theory.  Everything else is derived.

To implement logic, each proposition is given its own type.  The objects in those types represent the different possible ways to prove the proposition.  Obviously, if there is no proof for the proposition, then the type has no objects in it.  Operators like "and" and "or" that work on propositions introduce new types and new objects.  So &lt;math&gt;A \times B &lt;/math&gt; is a type that depends on the type &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and the type &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  The objects in that dependent type are defined to exist for every pair of objects in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.  Obviously, if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; has no proof and is an empty type, then the new type representing &lt;math&gt; A \times B &lt;/math&gt; is also empty.

This can be done for other types (booleans, natural numbers, etc.) and their operators.

==Categorical models of type theory==
Using the language of [[category theory]], [[R.A.G. Seely]] introduced the notion of a [[locally cartesian closed category]] (LCCC) as the basic model of type theory. This has been refined by Hofmann and Dybjer to ''Categories with Families'' or ''Categories with Attributes'' based on earlier work by Cartmell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clairambault|first=Pierre|last2=Dybjer|first2=Peter|date=2014|title=The biequivalence of locally cartesian closed categories and Martin-Löf type theories|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mathematical-structures-in-computer-science/article/biequivalence-of-locally-cartesian-closed-categories-and-martinlof-type-theories/6ECB295B1246A85D5DD92E5F38428D99|journal=Mathematical Structures in Computer Science|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|doi=10.1017/S0960129513000881|issn=0960-1295|arxiv=1112.3456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A category with families is a category ''C'' of contexts (in which the objects are contexts, and
the context morphisms are substitutions), together with a functor ''T'' : ''C''&lt;sup&gt;op&lt;/sup&gt; → ''Fam(Set)''.

''Fam(Set)'' is the [[category of families]] of Sets, in which objects are pairs ''(A,B)'' of an "index set" ''A'' and a function ''B'': ''X'' → ''A'', and morphisms are pairs of functions ''f'' : ''A'' → ''A' '' and ''g'' : ''X'' → ''X' '', such that ''B' '' &lt;sub&gt;°&lt;/sub&gt; ''g'' = ''f'' &lt;sub&gt;°&lt;/sub&gt; ''B'' - in other words, ''f'' maps ''B&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''B'&lt;sub&gt;g(a)&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The functor ''T'' assigns to a context ''G'' a set ''Ty(G)'' of types, and for each ''A'' : ''Ty(G)'', a set ''Tm(G,A)'' of terms.
The axioms for a functor require that these play harmoniously with substitution. Substitution is usually
written in the form ''Af'' or ''af'', where ''A'' is a type in ''Ty(G)'' and ''a'' is a term in ''Tm(G,A)'', and ''f'' is a substitution
from ''D'' to ''G''.  Here ''Af'' : ''Ty(D)'' and ''af'' : ''Tm(D,Af)''.

The category ''C'' must contain a terminal object (the empty context), and a final object for a form
of product called comprehension, or context extension, in which the right element is a type in the context of the left element.
If ''G'' is a context, and ''A'' : ''Ty(G)'', then there should be an object ''(G,A)'' final among
contexts ''D'' with mappings ''p'' : ''D → ''G'', ''q'' : ''Tm(D,Ap)''.

A logical framework, such as Martin-Löf's takes the form of
closure conditions on the context dependent sets of types and terms: that there should be a type called
Set, and for each set a type, that the types should be closed under forms of dependent sum and
product, and so forth.

A theory such as that of predicative set theory expresses closure conditions on the types of sets and
their elements: that they should be closed under operations that reflect dependent sum and product,
and under various forms of inductive definition.

==Extensional versus intensional==
A fundamental distinction is [[Extensional definition|extensional]] vs [[Intensional definition|intensional]] type theory. In extensional type theory definitional (i.e., computational) equality is not distinguished from propositional equality, which requires proof. As a consequence type checking becomes [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in extensional type theory because programs in the theory might not terminate. For example, such a theory allows one to give a type to the [[Fixpoint combinator|Y-combinator]], a detailed example of this can be found in Nordstöm and Petersson "Programming in Martin-Löf's Type Theory".&lt;ref&gt;Bengt Nordström; Kent Petersson; Jan M. Smith (1990). ''Programming in Martin-Löf's Type Theory''. Oxford University Press p.90&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doesn't prevent extensional type theory from being a basis for a practical tool, for example, [[NuPRL]] is based on extensional type theory. From a practical standpoint there's no difference between a program which doesn't terminate and a program which takes a million years to terminate.

In contrast in intensional type theory [[type checking]] is [[Decision problem|decidable]], but the representation of standard mathematical concepts is somewhat more cumbersome, since intensional reasoning requires using [[setoid]]s or similar constructions. There are many common mathematical objects, which are hard to work with or can't be represented without this, for example, [[Integer|integer numbers]], [[rational number]]s, and [[real number]]s. Integers and rational numbers can be represented without setoids, but this representation isn't easy to work with. Real numbers can't be represented without this.&lt;ref&gt;Altenkirch, Thorsten, Thomas Anberrée, and Nuo Li. "Definable Quotients in Type Theory."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Homotopy type theory]] works on resolving this problem. It allows one to define [[higher inductive type]]s, which not only define first order constructors ([[value (computer science)|value]]s or [[point (geometry)|point]]s), but higher order constructors, i.e. equalities between elements ([[path (topology)|path]]s), equalities between equalities ([[homotopy|homotopies]]), ''ad infinitum''.

==Implementations of type theory==
Different forms of type theory have been implemented as the formal systems underlying of a number of [[Proof assistant|proof assistants]]. While many are based off Per Martin-Löf's ideas, many have added features, more axioms, or different philosophical background. For instance, the  [[NuPRL]] system is based on [[computational type theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Allen|first=S.F.|last2=Bickford|first2=M.|last3=Constable|first3=R.L.|last4=Eaton|first4=R.|last5=Kreitz|first5=C.|last6=Lorigo|first6=L.|last7=Moran|first7=E.|title=Innovations in computational type theory using Nuprl|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2005.10.005|journal=Journal of Applied Logic|volume=4|issue=4|pages=428–469|doi=10.1016/j.jal.2005.10.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Coq]] is based on the [[Calculus of constructions|calculus of (co)inductive constructions]]. [[Dependent types]] also feature in the design of [[programming languages]] such as [[ATS (programming language)|ATS]], [[Cayenne (programming language)|Cayenne]], [[Epigram (programming language)|Epigram]], [[Agda (theorem prover)|Agda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norell|first=Ulf|date=2009|title=Dependently Typed Programming in Agda|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1481861.1481862|journal=Proceedings of the 4th International Workshop on Types in Language Design and Implementation|series=TLDI '09|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=1–2|doi=10.1145/1481861.1481862|isbn=9781605584201}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Idris (programming language)|Idris]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brady|first=Edwin|date=2013|title=Idris, a general-purpose dependently typed programming language: Design and implementation|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-functional-programming/article/idris-a-generalpurpose-dependently-typed-programming-language-design-and-implementation/418409138B4452969AC0736DB0A2C238|journal=Journal of Functional Programming|volume=23|issue=5|pages=552–593|doi=10.1017/S095679681300018X|issn=0956-7968}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Martin-Löf type theories==

Per Martin-Löf constructed several type theories that were published at various times, some of them much later than the preprints with their description became accessible to the specialists{{Who|date=October 2017}}. The list below attempts to list all the theories that have been described in a printed form and to sketch the key features that distinguished them from each other. All of these theories had dependent products, dependent sums, disjoint unions, finite types and natural numbers. All the theories had the same reduction rules that did not include η-reduction either for dependent products or for dependent sums except for MLTT79 where the η-reduction for dependent products is added.

'''MLTT71''' was the first of type theories created by [[Per Martin-Löf]]. It appeared in a preprint in 1971. It had one universe but this universe had a name in itself, i.e. it was a type theory  with, as it is called today, "Type in Type".  [[Jean-Yves Girard]] has shown that this system was inconsistent and the preprint was never published.

'''MLTT72'''  was presented in a 1972 preprint that has now been published.&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, An intuitionistic theory of types, Twenty-five years of constructive type theory (Venice,1995), Oxford Logic Guides, v. 36, pp. 127--172, Oxford Univ. Press, New York, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  That theory had one universe V and no identity types.  The universe was "predicative" in the sense that the dependent product of a family of objects from V over an object that was not in V such as, for example, V itself, was not assumed to be in V. The universe was a-la Russell,  i.e., one would write directly "T∈V" and "t∈T" (Martin-Löf uses the sign "∈" instead of modern ":") without the additional constructor such as "El".

'''MLTT73''' It was the first definition of a type theory that Per Martin-Löf published (it was presented at the Logic Colloquium 73 and published in 1975&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, An intuitionistic theory of types: predicative part, Logic Colloquium '73 (Bristol, 1973), 73--118. Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics, Vol. 80, North-Holland, Amsterdam,1975&lt;/ref&gt;).  There are identity types which he calls "propositions" but since no real distinction between propositions and the rest of the types is introduced the meaning of this is unclear.  There is what later acquires the name of J-eliminator but yet without a name (see pp.&amp;nbsp;94–95).  There is in this theory an infinite sequence of universes V&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,...,V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;,... . The universes are predicative, a-la Russell and ''non-cumulative''!  In fact, Corollary 3.10 on p.&amp;nbsp;115 says that if A∈V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and B∈V&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are such that A and B are convertible then m=n. This means, for example, that it would be difficult to formulate univalence in this theory—there are contractible types in each of the V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; but it is unclear how to declare them to be equal since there are no identity types connecting V&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; for i≠j.

'''MLTT79''' It was presented in 1979 and published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Per Martin-Löf, Constructive mathematics and computer programming, Logic, methodology and philosophy of science, VI (Hannover, 1979), Stud. Logic Found. Math., v. 104, pp. 153--175, North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;  In this paper, Martin-Löf introduced the four basic types of judgement for the dependent type theory that has since became fundamental in the study of the meta-theory of such systems.  He also introduced contexts as a separate concept in it (see p.&amp;nbsp;161).  There are identity types with the J-eliminator (which already appeared in MLTT73 but did not have this name there) but also with the rule that makes the theory "extensional"  (p.&amp;nbsp;169).  There are W-types.  There is an infinite sequence of predicative universes that ''are cumulative''.

'''Bibliopolis''' There is a discussion of a type theory in the Bibliopolis book from 1984&lt;ref name=MartinLöf1984&gt;Per Martin-Löf, Intuitionistic type theory, Studies in Proof Theory. Lecture Notes, v. 1, Notes by Giovanni Sambin,  pp. iv+91, 1984&lt;/ref&gt; but it is somewhat open-ended and does not seem to represent a particular set of choices and so there is no specific type theory associated with it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5152">In [[algebraic combinatorics]], the '''Kruskal–Katona theorem''' gives a complete characterization of the ''f''-vectors of [[abstract simplicial complex]]es. It includes as a special case the [[Erdős–Ko–Rado theorem]] and can be restated in terms of [[hypergraph|uniform hypergraphs]]. The theorem is named after [[Joseph Kruskal]] and [[Gyula O. H. Katona]]. It was independently proved by [[Marcel-Paul Schützenberger]], but his contribution escaped notice for several years.

== Statement ==

Given two positive integers ''N'' and ''i'', there is a unique way to expand ''N'' as a sum of [[binomial coefficient]]s as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; N=\binom{n_i}{i}+\binom{n_{i-1}}{i-1}+\ldots+\binom{n_j}{j},\quad
n_i &gt; n_{i-1} &gt; \ldots &gt; n_j \geq j\geq 1. &lt;/math&gt;

This expansion can be constructed by applying the [[greedy algorithm]]: set ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; to be the maximal ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt; N\geq \binom{n}{i}, &lt;/math&gt; replace ''N'' with the difference, ''i'' with ''i'' − 1, and repeat until the difference becomes zero. Define

: &lt;math&gt; N^{(i)}=\binom{n_i}{i+1}+\binom{n_{i-1}}{i}+\ldots+\binom{n_j}{j+1}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Statement for simplicial complexes ===

An integral vector &lt;math&gt;(f_0, f_1, ..., f_{d-1})&lt;/math&gt; is the [[f-vector|''f''-vector]] of some &lt;math&gt;(d-1)&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional simplicial complex if and only if

: &lt;math&gt; 0 \leq f_{i} \leq f_{i-1}^{(i)},\quad 1\leq i\leq d-1.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Statement for uniform hypergraphs ===

Let ''A'' be a set consisting of ''N'' distinct ''i''-element subsets of a fixed set ''U'' ("the universe") and ''B'' be the set of all &lt;math&gt;(i-r)&lt;/math&gt;-element subsets of the sets in ''A''. Expand ''N'' as above. Then the cardinality of ''B'' is bounded below as follows:

: &lt;math&gt; |B| \geq  \binom{n_i}{i-r}+\binom{n_{i-1}}{i-r-1}+\ldots+\binom{n_j}{j-r}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Lovász' simplified formulation ===

The following weaker but useful form is due to [[László Lovász|Lovász]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lovász|first=László|date=1993|title=Combinatorial problems and exercises|location=Amsterdam|publisher=North-Holland}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let ''A'' be a set of ''i''-element subsets of a fixed set ''U'' ("the universe") and ''B'' be the set of all &lt;math&gt;(i-r)&lt;/math&gt;-element subsets of the sets in ''A''. If &lt;math&gt;|A| = \binom{x}{i}&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;|B| \geq \binom{x}{i-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In this formulation, ''x'' need not be an integer. The value of the binomial expression is &lt;math&gt;\binom{x}{i} = \frac{x(x-1)\dots(x-i+1)}{i!}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Ingredients of the proof ==

For every positive ''i'', list all ''i''-element subsets ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; … ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; of the set '''N''' of [[natural numbers]] in the [[colexicographical order]]. For example, for ''i'' = 3, the list begins

: &lt;math&gt; 123, 124, 134, 234, 125, 135, 235, 145, 245, 345, \ldots. &lt;/math&gt;

Given a vector &lt;math&gt;f = (f_0, f_1, ..., f_{d-1})&lt;/math&gt;  with positive integer components, let ''Δ''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; be the subset of the [[power set]] 2&lt;sup&gt;'''N'''&lt;/sup&gt; consisting of the empty set together with the first &lt;math&gt;f_{i-1}&lt;/math&gt; ''i''-element subsets of '''N''' in the list for ''i'' = 1, …, ''d''. Then the following conditions are equivalent:

# Vector ''f'' is the ''f''-vector of a simplicial complex ''Δ''.
# ''Δ''&lt;sub&gt;''f''&lt;/sub&gt; is a simplicial complex.
# &lt;math&gt; f_{i} \leq f_{i-1}^{(i)},\quad 1\leq i\leq d-1.&lt;/math&gt;

The difficult implication is 1 ⇒ 2.

[[File:Lazare Nicolas Marguerite Carnot00.jpg|thumb]]
'''Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Count Carnot''' (13 May 1753 – 2 August 1823) was a French [[mathematician]], [[physicist]] and politician. He was known as the ''Organizer of Victory'' in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

==Education and early life==
Born on May 13, 1753 in the village of [[Nolay, Côte-d'Or]], Carnot was the son of local judge and royal notary, Claude Carnot and his wife, Marguerite Pothier. He was the second oldest of seven children. At the age of fourteen, Lazare and his brother were enrolled at the [[Collège d’Autun]], in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] where he focused on the study of philosophy and the classics. He held a strong belief in [[Stoicism|stoic philosophy]] and was deeply influenced by Roman civilization. When he turned fifteen, he left the [[Collège d’Autun]] to strengthen his philosophical knowledge and study under the [[Society of the Priests of Saint Sulpice]]. During his short time with them, he studied logic, mathematics and theology under the Abbe Bison. After being impressed with Lazare’s work as a scholar, the [[Louis, duc d'Aumont|Duke D’Aumont]] (Marquis de Nolay) recommended a military career for the young one and was soon sent by his father to the Aumont residence to further his education. Here, he was enrolled in M. de Longpres pension school in 1770 until he was ready to enter one of two prestigious engineering and artillery schools in Paris. A year later, in February 1771, he was ranked the third highest among twelve who were chosen out of his class of more than one hundred who took the entrance exams. It was at this point when he entered the Mézières School of Engineering appointed as second lieutenant. Studies at the Mézières included geometry, mechanics, geometrical designing, geography, hydraulics and material preparation. On January 1, 1773, he graduated the school ranked as first lieutenant. He was eighteen years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lazare Carnot, Republic Patriot|last=Dupre|first=Huntley|publisher=The Mississippi Valley Press|year=1892|isbn=|location=Oxford, O|pages=5–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was here where he met and studied with [[Benjamin Franklin]]&lt;ref name="Paoli, Lazare Carnot 1996"&gt;Dino De Paoli, Lazare Carnot's Grand Strategy for Political Victory. ''Executive Intelligence Review''  (1996)&lt;/ref&gt; and at the age of twenty and obtained commission as a lieutenant in the [[Prince of Condé]]’s engineer corps. At this moment, he made a name for himself both in the line of (physics) theoretical engineering and in his work in the field of fortifications. While in the army, he continued his study of mathematics. In 1784 he published his first work ''Essay on Machines,'' which contained a statement that foreshadowed the principle of energy as applied to a falling weight, and the earliest proof that [[kinetic energy]] is lost in the collision of [[Solid mechanics|imperfectly elastic bodies]]. This publication earned him the honor of admittance to a literary society. Another turning point was his essay on [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] in which he praises the engineer on his works while at the same time developing his own career as a writer/engineer. Vauban's work had a profound effect on his work as a general and engineer.  In that same year, he also received a promotion to the rank of captain.

==Political career==
At the outbreak of the [[French Revolution]] in 1789, Carnot entered political life. He became a delegate to the [[Legislative Assembly (France)|Legislature]] in 1791. While a member of the Legislative Assembly, Carnot was elected to the Committee for Public Instruction. He believed that all citizens should be educated and as a member of that committee, he wrote a series of reforms for the teaching and educational systems, but they were not implemented due to the violent social and economic climate of the Revolution.

After the Legislative Assembly was dissolved, Carnot was elected to the [[National Convention]] in 1792. He spent the last few months of 1792 on a mission to [[Bayonne]], organizing the military defense effort in an attempt to ward off any possible attacks from Spain. Upon returning to Paris, Carnot voted for the death of [[List of French monarchs|King]] [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]], although he had been absent for the debates surrounding the king’s trial.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

On 14 August 1793 Carnot was elected to the [[Committee of Public Safety]], where he took charge of the military situation as one of the Ministers of War.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

With the establishment of the [[French Directory|Directory]] in 1795, Carnot became one of the five initial directors. For the first year, the Directors did well working harmoniously together as well as with the Councils. However, difference of political views led to a schism between Carnot and [[Étienne-François Letourneur]], followed by [[François-Marie, marquis de Barthélemy|François de Barthélemy]], on the one side, and the triumvirate of [[Paul François Jean Nicolas, vicomte de Barras]], [[Jean-François Rewbell]], and [[Louis Marie de La Révellière-Lépeaux]] on the other side. Carnot and Barthélemy supported concessions to end the war, and hoped to oust the triumvirate and replace them with more conservative men. After Letourneur had been replaced by another close collaborator of Carnot, François de Barthélemy, both of them, alongside many deputies in the [[Council of Five Hundred]], were ousted in the [[Coup of 18 Fructidor]] (4 September 1797), engineered by Generals [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] (originally, Carnot's ''[[Mentoring|protégé]]'') and [[Pierre François Charles Augereau, duc de Castiglione|Pierre François Charles Augereau]]. Carnot took refuge in [[Geneva]], and there in 1797 issued his ''La métaphysique du calcul infinitésimal''.

=== Military accomplishments ===
[[File:Lejeune-Lazare Carnot.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Lazare Carnot, a feverishly productive member of the [[Committee of Public Safety]] during the [[Reign of Terror]]. His part in raising the [[levée en masse]] probably saved the French Revolutionary armies from defeat at the hands of their numerically superior opponents.]]
The creation of the [[French Revolutionary Army]] was largely due to his powers of organization and enforcing discipline. In order to raise more troops for the war, Carnot introduced [[conscription]]: the ''[[levée en masse]]'' approved by the National Convention was able to raise France’s army from 645,000 troops in mid-1793 to 1,500,000 in September 1794. He was the first to execute the modern waging of war with mass armies and strategic planning realized by the Revolution.&lt;ref name="Paoli, Lazare Carnot 1996" /&gt; As a military engineer, Carnot favored fortresses and defensive strategies.&lt;ref name="R.R. Palmer 1941"&gt;R.R. Palmer, The Twelve Who Ruled. Princeton: Princeton University Press  (1941)&lt;/ref&gt; He developed innovative defensive designs for forts, including the [[Carnot wall]], called after him. However, with the constant invasions he decided to take his strategic planning to an offensive strike. From his intellect sprang the maneuvers and organization that turned the tides of war from 1793 to 1794.&lt;ref&gt;S.J. Watson. Carnot.London:The Bodley Head  (1954)&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea was to have a massive army separated into several units that could move more quickly than the enemy and attack from the flanks rather than head on, which had led to resounding defeats before Carnot was elected to the Committee of Public Safety. This tactic was extremely successful against the more traditional tactics of existing European armies. It was his initiative to train the conscripts in the art of war and to place new recruits with experienced soldiers rather than having a massive volunteer army without any real idea of how to wage battle.

Once the problem of troop numbers had been solved, Carnot turned his administrative skills to the supplies that this massive army would need. Many of the munitions and supplies were in short supply: copper was lacking for guns so he ordered church bells seized in order to melt them down; saltpeter was lacking and he called chemistry to his aid; leather for boots was scarce so he demanded and secured new methods for tanning. He quickly organized the army and helped to turn the tide of the war. It added significantly to discontent with the course of the Revolution in still [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon-loyalist]] areas – such as the [[Vendée]], which had broken out in [[Revolt in the Vendée|open revolt]] 5 months earlier – but the government of the time considered it a success, and Carnot became known as the ''Organizer of Victory''. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In autumn 1793, he took charge of French columns on the [[Campaigns of 1793 in the French Revolutionary Wars|Northern Front]], and contributed to [[Jean-Baptiste Jourdan]]'s victory in the [[Battle of Wattignies (1793)|Battle of Wattignies]].

==== Relationship with [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Jacobin|Jacobin Club]] ====
Carnot met Robespierre for the first time in Arras where he was assigned for military duty and shortly after [[Maximilien Robespierre|Robespierre]] finished his legal studies. Both of them were members of the literary and singing "Societe des Rosati." The group was founded in 1778 and was inspired by the works of Chapelle, La Fontaine, and Chanlieu. It was here where they became acquaintances and eventually friends. Robespierre preceded Carnot into the Academy of Arras entering in April 1784 while he entered three years later in 1787.

While being an active member of the Committee of Public Safety in 1794, tensions between Carnot and Robespierre began to rise massively. During his time on the committee, which was heavily radical, Carnot signed a total of 43 decrees and drafted 18 of them. Most of them regarding military tactics and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc2.ark:/13960/t9d50nf2c|title=The work of Lazare Carnot in the Committee of Public Safety|last=Culp|first=William Maurice|publisher=|year=1914|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite leaning on Jacobin beliefs,  Carnot was considered the "conservative" of his half. He was not an official member of the radical group and therefore took on his own independent beliefs in regards to many issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org|title=Lazare Carnot|last=Forrest|first=Alan|date=November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these issues included Robespierre's proposal on an egalitarian social system in which he feverishly disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lazare-Carnot|title=Lazare Carnot|last=Soboul|first=Albert|date=March 28, 2011|website=Brittanica|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he had taken no steps to oppose the [[Reign of Terror]], he and some other [[Technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocrats]] on the committee, including [[Robert Lindet]] and [[Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau]], turned on [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and his allies during the [[Thermidorian Reaction]] by having him arrested. Robespierre was later killed along with 21 of his followers. Shortly after Robespierre's fall, Carnot was charged for his role during the time but the charges were quickly dismissed when he became a member of the Directory.

==== Relationship with [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] ====

In 1795, Lazare appointed Napoleon Bonaparte as general in chief of the [[Army of Italy (France)|Army of Italy]]. He is known to be the only member of the Directory to have supported Napoleon during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Lazare Carnot, a forgotten piece in the Napoleon Bonaparte Jigsaw|last=Hicks|first=Peter|publisher=Napoleonica. La Revue|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=64–74|doi=10.3917/napo.131.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1800 Bonaparte appointed Carnot as [[List of Defense Ministers of France|Minister of War]], and he served in that office at the time of the [[Battle of Marengo (1800)|Battle of Marengo]]. In 1802 he voted against the establishment of Napoleon's [[French Consulate|Consular powers for life]] and the passing of the title to his children, for as Carnot said when speaking of the power necessary to govern a state "If this power is the appendage of a hereditary family it becomes despotic."

After [[Napoleon]] crowned himself emperor on 2 December 1804, Carnot's [[First French Republic|republican]] convictions precluded his acceptance of high office under the [[First French Empire]], and he resigned from public life. Probably in response to the fall of the fortress of [[Vlissingen]] to the British during the [[Walcheren Campaign]] in 1809, Napoleon employed Carnot to write a treatise describing how fortifications could be improved, for the use of the [[École militaire de Metz]]. Building on the theories of the controversial engineer [[Marc René, marquis de Montalembert|Montalembert]], Carnot advanced ideas on how the long established [[Star fort|bastioned system]] of fortification could be modified for close defense and to allow for [[counter attack]] by the besieged garrison.

In 1812, Carnot returned to office in defense of Napoleon during the disastrous [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|invasion of Russia]]; he was assigned the [[Siege of Antwerp (1814)|defense]] of [[Antwerp]] against the [[Sixth Coalition]] – he only surrendered on the demand of the [[Charles X of France|Count of Artois]], who was the younger brother of [[Louis XVIII]] and later [[Charles X]].  He was later made a Count of the Empire by Napoleon as Lazare Nicolas Marguerite, Comte Carnot. During the [[Hundred Days]], Carnot served as [[List of Interior Ministers of France|Minister of the Interior]] for Napoleon, and was exiled as a ''[[regicide]]'' during the [[Second White Terror|White Terror]] after the [[Bourbon Restoration|Second Restoration]] during the reign of Louis XVIII.

==Retirement and legacy==
In 1803 Carnot produced his ''Géométrie de position''. This work deals with [[Projective geometry|projective]] rather than [[descriptive geometry]].
Carnot is responsible for initiating the use of [[cross-ratio]]s:
"He was the first to introduce the cross (anharmonic) ratio of four points of a line taking account of its sign, thereby sharpening [[Pappus's hexagon theorem|Pappus' concept]]. He then proved that this ratio is invariant for the four points obtained by cutting four lines of a [[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]] of lines with different secants. In this way, he established the harmonic properties of the [[complete quadrilateral]]."&lt;ref&gt;B. L. Laptev &amp; B. A. Rozenfel'd (1996) ''Mathematics of the 19th Century: Geometry'', p.&amp;nbsp;28, [[Birkhäuser Verlag]] {{ISBN|3-7643-5048-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach to geometry was used by [[Karl von Staudt]] four decades later to set a new [[foundations of mathematics#Projective geometry|foundation to mathematics]].

The [[Borda–Carnot equation]] of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[Carnot's theorem]] in [[plane geometry]] are named after him.

Published in 1810 under the title ''"Traité de la Défense des Places Fortes"'', his ideas on fortification were further developed in the third edition which was published in 1812. An English translation, "A Treatise on the Defence of Fortified Places" was published in 1814. Although few of his proposals were accepted by mainstream engineers, the [[Carnot wall]], a detached wall at the foot of the [[Wikt:escarp|escarp]], became a common feature in fortifications built in the mid-19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, E. M. (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/vaubanmontalembe00lloyrich#page/184/mode/2up ''Vauban, Montalembert, Carnot:  Engineer Studies''], Chapman and Hall, London (pp.&amp;nbsp;183–195)&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived in [[Warsaw]], and moved to [[Prussia]], where he died in the city of [[Magdeburg]]. Carnot's remains were interred at the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in 1889, at the same time as those of [[Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg|Marie Victor de La Tour-Maubourg]], [[Jean-Baptiste Baudin]], and [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers]].

Carnot survived all the phases of the [[French Revolution]], from its beginnings in 1789 until the fall of [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] in 1815. On the social and political front, Carnot was the author of many reforms sought to improve the country. One of these was the proposal for compulsory public education for all citizens. He also penned a proposal for the new Constitution which included the "Declaration of the Duties of the Citizens" that held that there should be not only education but military service for all citizens of France between the ages of twenty and twenty-five.&lt;ref name="Paoli, Lazare Carnot 1996"/&gt; These proposals were in accordance with the Revolutionaries' thinking at the time, which held that men and women should be honored through ability and intelligence rather than through birthright, even though Carnot himself was nobly born.

==Work in mathematics and theoretical engineering==

*Lazare Carnot: [https://books.google.com/books?id=a0sOAAAAQAAJ ''A treatise on the defence of fortified places, 1814'']

He also published essays about engineering theory. 
''Essai sur les machines en général'' won honorable mention from the Academie sur Science of Paris in 1780. It was revised and published in 1783. In this he outlined a mathematical theory of power transmission in mechanical systems. 
His essay ''Principes fondamentaux de l'équilibre et du mouvement'' 1803 was a further revision and expansion of the earlier work. This was "the first theoretical analysis of engineering mechanics". In this "he went on to analyze the movement of energy from one part of the system to another; he found that power is transmitted most efficiently, and the largest amount of useful work done, when friction, turbulence, and other energy wasting factors are kept to a minimum. This was an early and incomplete approach to the general law of conservation of energy."
Carnot's son [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot]] was influenced by his father's work when he undertook his research into the thermal efficiency of steam engines.

Lazare Carnot's name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29995">The '''Leroy P. Steele Prizes''' are awarded every year by the [[American Mathematical Society]], for distinguished research work and writing in the field of [[mathematics]]. Since 1993 there has been a formal division into three categories.

The prizes have been given since 1970, from a bequest of [[Leroy P. Steele]], and were set up in honor of [[George David Birkhoff]], [[William Fogg Osgood]] and [[William Caspar Graustein]]. The way the prizes are awarded was changed in 1976 and 1993, but the initial aim of honoring expository writing as well as research has been retained. The prizes of $5,000 are not given on a strict national basis, but relate to mathematical activity in the USA, and writing in English (originally, or in translation).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">In [[harmonic analysis]], a field within mathematics, '''Littlewood–Paley theory''' is a theoretical framework used to extend certain results about ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; functions to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; functions for 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;. It is typically used as a substitute for orthogonality arguments which only apply to ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; functions when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2. One implementation involves studying a function by decomposing it in terms of functions with localized frequencies, and using the Littlewood–Paley ''g''-function to compare it with its Poisson integral. The 1-variable case was originated by {{harvs|txt||first=J. E. |last=Littlewood|author1-link=J. E. Littlewood|first2=Raymond 
|last2=Paley|author2-link=Raymond Paley|year1=1931|year2=1937|year3=1938}} and  developed further by Polish mathematicians [[A. Zygmund]] and [[J. Marcinkiewicz]]  in the 1930s using complex function theory {{harv|Zygmund|2002|loc=chapters XIV, XV}}. [[E. M. Stein]] later extended the theory to higher dimensions using real variable techniques.

==The dyadic decomposition of a function==
Littlewood–Paley theory uses a decomposition of a function ''f'' into a sum of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; with localized frequencies. There are several ways to construct such a decomposition; a typical method is as follows.

If ''f'' is a function on '''R''', and ''&amp;rho;'' is a measurable set with [[Indicator function|characteristic function]] ''&amp;chi;''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; is defined to be given by
:&lt;math&gt;\hat f_\rho = \chi_\rho\hat f&lt;/math&gt;
where the "hat" is used to represent the [[Fourier transform]]. Informally, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;&amp;rho;&lt;/sub&gt; is the piece of ''f'' whose frequencies lie in&amp;nbsp;''&amp;rho;''.

If &amp;Delta; is a collection of measurable sets which (up to measure 0) are disjoint and have  union  the real line, then a well behaved function ''f''  can be written as a sum of functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''&amp;rho;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;isin;&amp;nbsp;&amp;Delta;.

When &amp;Delta; consists of the sets of the form

: &lt;math&gt; \rho = [-2^{k+1},-2^k] \cup [2^k,2^{k+1}].&lt;/math&gt;

for ''k'' an integer, this gives a so-called "dyadic decomposition" of ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt;.

There are many variations of this construction; for example, the characteristic function of a  set used in the definition of ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; can be replaced by a smoother function.

A key estimate of Littlewood–Paley theory is the Littlewood–Paley theorem, which bounds the size of the functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the size of ''f''. There are many versions of this theorem corresponding to the different ways of decomposing ''f''.  A typical estimate is to bound the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of (&amp;Sigma;&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt; |''f''&lt;sub&gt;''&amp;rho;''&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; by a multiple  of the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of&amp;nbsp;''f''.

In higher dimensions it is possible to generalize this construction by replacing intervals with rectangles with sides parallel to the coordinate axes. Unfortunately these are rather special sets, which limits the applications to higher dimensions.

==The Littlewood–Paley ''g'' function==
The ''g'' function is a non-linear operator on ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)  that can be used to control the  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of a function ''f'' in terms of its [[Poisson integral]].
The Poisson integral ''u''(''x'',''y'') of ''f'' is defined for ''y''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 by

:&lt;math&gt;u(x,y) = \int_{\mathbb R^n} P_y(t)f(x-t) \, dt&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Poisson kernel]] ''P'' is given by 

:&lt;math&gt;P_y(x) = \int_{\mathbb R^n} e^{-2\pi i tx-2\pi |t|y} \, dt = \frac{\Gamma((n+1)/2)}{\pi^{(n+1)/2}}\frac{y}{(|x|^2+y^2)^{(n+1)/2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The Littlewood–Paley ''g'' function ''g''(''f'') is defined by 
:&lt;math&gt;g(f)(x) = \left(\int_0^\infty|\nabla u(x,y)|^2y \, dy\right)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;

A basic property of ''g''  is that it approximately preserves norms. More precisely, for 1&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;, the ratio of the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norms of ''f'' and ''g''(''f'') is bounded above and below by fixed positive constants depending on ''n'' and ''p'' but not on&amp;nbsp;''f''.

==Applications==

One early application of Littlewood–Paley theory was the proof that if ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are the partial sums of the Fourier series of a periodic  ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; function (''p''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1) and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is a sequence satisfying ''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''+1&lt;/sub&gt;/''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; ''q'' for some fixed ''q''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;1, then the sequence ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;  converges almost everywhere. This was later superseded by the [[Carleson's theorem|Carleson–Hunt theorem]] showing that ''S''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; itself converges almost everywhere.

Littlewood–Paley theory can also be used to prove the [[Marcinkiewicz multiplier theorem]].

'''Louis Leithold''' ([[San Francisco]], United States, 16 November 1924 – [[Los Angeles]], 29 April 2005) was an American [[mathematician]] and [[teacher]].

At age 72, after his retirement&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; from Pepperdine,&lt;ref name=malibu/&gt; he began teaching calculus at [[Malibu High School]], in [[Malibu, California]], drilling his students for the [[Advanced Placement Calculus]], and achieving considerable success.&lt;ref name=ap/&gt; He regularly assigned two hours of homework per night, and had two training sessions at his own house that ran Saturdays or Sundays from 9AM to 4PM before the AP test.&lt;ref name=touch&gt;{{cite news|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=His Math Text Was the Standard, His Touch in Class Exceptional|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/08/local/me-leithold8|accessdate=8 February 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=8 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; His teaching methods were praised for their liveliness, and his love for the topic was well known.&lt;ref name=npr/&gt; He also taught workshops for calculus teachers.&lt;ref name=touch/&gt;&lt;ref name=woo&gt;{{cite news|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=Obituaries: Fitting Tribute to Math Teacher; Late instructor Louis Leithold's students receive top scores on AP calculus exam|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/897946231.html?dids=897946231:897946231&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+18%2C+2005&amp;author=Elaine+Woo&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;desc=Obituaries%3B+Fitting+Tribute+to+Math+Teacher%3B+Late+instructor+Louis+Leithold%27s+students+receive+top+scores+on+AP+calculus+exam.&amp;pqatl=google|accessdate=7 February 2011|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=18 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the people he influenced was Jaime Escalante, who taught math to minority students at [[Garfield High School (Los Angeles County, California)|Garfield High School]] in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]].

In [[mathematics]], the term '''mapping''', sometimes shortened to '''map''', refers to either a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], often with some sort of special structure, or a [[morphism]] in category theory, which generalizes the idea of a function. There are also a few, less common uses in logic and graph theory.

==Maps as functions==
{{Main article|Function (mathematics)}}

In many branches of mathematics, the term '''map''' is used to mean a [[Function (mathematics)|function]], sometimes with a specific property of particular importance to that branch.  For instance, a "map" is a ''[[continuous function]]'' in [[topology]], a ''[[Linear map|linear transformation]]'' in [[linear algebra]], etc.

Some authors, such as [[Serge Lang]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Serge|last=Lang|title=Linear Algebra|edition=2nd|year=1971|page=83|publisher=Addison-Wesley}}&lt;/ref&gt; use "function" only to refer to maps in which the [[codomain]] is a set of numbers (i.e. a subset of the [[Field (mathematics)|field]]s '''R''' or '''C''') and the term ''mapping'' for more general functions.

Sets of maps of special kinds are the subjects of many important theories: see for instance [[Lie group]], [[mapping class group]], [[permutation group]].&lt;!-- many more to add here--&gt;

In the theory of [[dynamical system]]s, a map denotes an [[Discrete-time dynamical system|evolution function]] used to create [[Dynamical system#Maps|discrete dynamical systems]]. See also [[Poincaré map]].

A ''partial map'' is a ''[[partial function]]'', and a ''total map'' is a ''[[total function]]''. Related terms like ''[[Domain (mathematics)|domain]]'', ''[[codomain]]'', ''[[Injective function|injective]]'', ''[[Continuous function|continuous]]'', etc. can be applied equally to maps and functions, with the same meaning. All these usages can be applied to "maps" as general functions or as functions with special properties.

==Maps as morphisms==
{{Main article|Morphism}}

In [[category theory]], "map" is often used as a synonym for [[morphism]] or arrow, thus for something more general than a function.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Introduction to Category Theory|first=H.|last=Simmons|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=9781139503327|page=2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VOCQUC_uiWgC&amp;pg=PA2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, morphisms &lt;math&gt;f\, X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, in a [[Concrete category| concrete category]], in other words morphisms that can be viewed as functions, carry with them the information of both its domain (the source &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; of the morphism), but also its co-domain (the target &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;). In the widely used definition of function &lt;math&gt;f:X\to Y&lt;/math&gt;, this is a subset of &lt;math&gt;X\times Y&lt;/math&gt; consisting of all the pairs &lt;math&gt;(x,f(x))&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. In this sense, the function doesn't capture the information of which set &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is used as the co-domain. Only the range &lt;math&gt;f(X)&lt;/math&gt; is determined by the function.

==Other uses==
===In logic===
In [[formal logic]], the term '''map'''  is sometimes used for a ''[[functional predicate]]'', whereas a function is a [[model (logic)|model]] of such a [[Predicate (logic)|predicate]] in [[set theory]].

===In graph theory===
[[File:Dodecahedron schlegel diagram.png|thumb|An example of a map in [[graph theory]]]]

In [[graph theory]], a '''map''' is a drawing of a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] on a surface without overlapping edges (an [[Graph embedding|embedding]]). If the surface is a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] then a map is a [[planar graph]], similar to a [[political map]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first1=Jonathan|last1=Gross|first2=Jay|last2=Yellen|title=Graph Theory and its applications|year=1998|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=0-8493-3982-0|page=294}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In computer science===
In the communities surrounding [[programming language]]s that treat functions as [[first-class citizen]]s, a [[Map (higher-order function)|map]] often refers to the [[Binary function|binary]] [[higher-order function]] that takes a function ''f'' and a [[List (abstract data type)|list]] {{nowrap|[''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]}} as [[Argument of a function|arguments]] and returns {{nowrap|[''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), ..., ''f''(''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)]}}, where {{nowrap|''n'' ≥ 0}}.

'''mcrypt''' is a replacement for the popular [[Unix]] [[Crypt (Unix)|crypt]] command.
crypt was a file encryption tool that used an [[algorithm]] very close to the
[[World War II]] [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] cipher. Mcrypt provides the same functionality but uses several modern algorithms such as [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]. Libmcrypt, Mcrypt's companion, is a library of code which contains the actual encryption functions and provides an easy method for use. The last update to libmcrypt was in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/mcrypt/files/Libmcrypt/|title=Libmcrypt releases}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite years of unmerged patches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceforge.net/p/mcrypt/patches|title=Libmcrypt patches}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facts have led security experts to declare mcrypt [[abandonware]] and discourage its use in new development. Prefer [[ccrypt]], [[libressl]], and others. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://paragonie.com/blog/2015/05/if-you-re-typing-word-mcrypt-into-your-code-you-re-doing-it-wrong|title= If You're Typing the Word MCRYPT Into Your PHP Code, You're Doing It Wrong|author=Paragon Initiative Enterprises}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mcrypt usage in a Linux command line environment:&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
 mcrypt --list                           # See available encryption algorithms.           
 mcrypt -a blowfish myfilename           # Encrypts myfilename to myfilename.nc           
                                         # using the Blowfish encryption algorithm.       
                                         # You are prompted two times for a passphrase.   
 mcrypt -d mytextfile.txt.nc             # Decrypts mytextfile.txt.nc to mytextfile.txt.  
 mcrypt -V -d -a enigma -o scrypt --bare # Can en/decrypt files crypted with SunOS crypt. 
 mcrypt --help&lt;/source&gt;

It implements numerous [[cryptography|cryptographic]] algorithms, mostly [[block cipher]]s and [[stream cipher]]s, some of which falls under [[export of cryptography|export restriction]]s in the [[United States]]. Algorithms include [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], [[blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]], [[RC4|ARCFOUR]], [[enigma machine|Enigma]], [[GOST (block cipher)|GOST]], [[LOKI97]], [[RC2]], [[Serpent (cipher)|Serpent]], Threeway, [[Twofish]], [[WAKE (cipher)|WAKE]], and [[XTEA]].

'''Ocean general circulation models''' (OGCMs) are a particular kind of [[general circulation model]] to describe physical and thermodynamical processes in oceans. The oceanic general circulation is defined as the horizontal space scale and time scale larger than mesoscale (of order 100&amp;nbsp;km and 6 months).{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} They depict oceans using a three-dimensional grid that include active [[thermodynamics]] and hence are most directly applicable to climate studies. They are the most advanced tools currently available for simulating the response of the global ocean system to increasing [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/gcm_guide.html |title=What is a GCM? |publisher=Ipcc-data.org |date=2013-06-18 |accessdate=2016-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hierarchy of OGCMs have been developed that include varying degrees of spatial coverage, resolution, geographical realism, process detail, etc.

==History==
The first generation of OGCMs assumed “rigid lid” to eliminate high-speed external [[gravity waves]]. According to CFL criteria without those fast waves, we can use a bigger time step, which is not so computationally expensive. But it also filtered those ocean tides and other waves having the speed of [[tsunamis]]. Within this assumption Bryan and co-worker Cox developed a 2D model, a 3D box model, and then a model of full circulation in [[GFDL]], with variable density as well, for the world ocean with its complex coastline and bottom topography.&lt;ref&gt;K. Bryan, J. Comput. Phys. 4, 347 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; The first application with specified global geometry was done in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;M. D. Cox, in Numerical Models of Ocean Circulation (National Academy of Sciences, Washington, DC, 1975), pp. 107 120&lt;/ref&gt; Cox designed a 2° latitude-longitude grid with up to 12 vertical levels at each point.

With more and more research on ocean model, mesoscale phenomenon, e.g. most [[ocean currents]] have crossstream dimensions equal to [[Rossby radius of deformation]], started to get more awareness. However, in order to analyze those [[eddies]] and currents in numerical models, we need grid spacing to be approximately 20&amp;nbsp;km in middle latitudes. Thanks to those faster computers and further filtering the equations in advance to remove internal gravity waves, those major currents and low-frequency eddies then can be resolved, one example is the three-layer [[Quasi-geostrophic equations|quasi-geostrophic]] models designed by Holland.&lt;ref&gt;W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 8, 363 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile there are some model retaining internal gravity wave, for example one adiabatic layered model by O'Brien and his students, which did retain internal gravity waves so that equatorial and coastal problems involving these waves could be treated, led to an initial understanding of El Niño in terms of those waves.&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Busalacchi and J. J. O'Brien, ibid. 10, 1929 (1980)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s, simulations could finally be undertaken using the GFDL formulation with eddies marginally resolved over extensive domains and with observed winds and some atmospheric influence on density.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbari.org/staff/braccio/science/semtner.html Albert J. Semtner]&lt;/ref&gt; Further more these simulation with high  enough resolution such as the Southern Ocean south of latitude 25°,&lt;ref&gt;The FRAM Group, Eos 72, 169 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; the North Atlantic,&lt;ref&gt;F. O. Bryan, C. W. Böning, W. R. Holland, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 25, 289 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; and the World Ocean without the Arctic &lt;ref&gt;A. J. Semtner and R. M Chervin, J. Geophys. Res. 97, 5493 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; provided first side-by-side comparison with data.
Early in the 1990s, for those large scale and eddies resolvable models the computer requirement for the 2D ancillary problem associated with the rigid lid approximation was becoming excessive. Further more, in order to predict tidal effects or compare height data from satellites, methods were developed to predict the height and pressure of the ocean surface directly. For example, one method is to treat the free surface and the vertically averaged velocity using many small steps in time for each single step of the full 3D model.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Killworth, D. Stainforth, D. J. Webb, S. M. Paterson, J. Phys. Oceanogr. 21, 1333 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; Another method developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory solves the same 2D equations using an implicit method for the free surface.&lt;ref&gt;J. K. Dukowicz and R. D. Smith, J. Geophys. Res. 99, 7991 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Both methods are quite efficient.

==Importance==
OGCMs have many important applications: dynamical coupling with the atmosphere, sea ice, and land run-off that in reality jointly determine the oceanic boundary fluxes; transpire of biogeochemical materials; interpretation of the paleoclimate record;climate prediction for both natural variability and anthropogenic chafes; data assimilation and fisheries and other biospheric management.&lt;ref&gt;Chassignet, Eric P., and Jacques Verron, eds. Ocean modeling and parameterization. No. 516. Springer, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; OGCMs play a critical role in [[Global climate model|Earth system model]]. They maintain the thermal balance as they transport energy from tropical to the polar latitudes. To analyze the feedback between ocean and atmosphere we need ocean model, which can initiate and amplify climate change on many different time scales, for instance, the interannual variability of [[El Niño]] &lt;ref&gt;S. G. Philander, El Niño, La Nina, and the Southern Oscillation (Academic Press, San Diego, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential modification of the major patterns for oceanic heat transport as a result of increasing greenhouse gases.&lt;ref&gt;S. Manabe and R. J. Stouffer, Nature 364, 215 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Oceans are a kind of undersampled nature fluid system, so by using OGCMs we can fill in those data blank and improve understanding of basic processes and their interconnectedness, as well as to help interpret sparse observations. Even though, simpler models can be used to estimate climate response, only OGCM can be used conjunction with atmospheric general circulation model to estimate global climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Showstack, Randy. "IPCC Report Calls Climate Changes Unprecedented." Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union 94.41 (2013): 363–363&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subgridscale parameterization==
[[File:Family tree of sub-gridscale mixing schemes.png|thumb|ocean parameterization scheme family tree]]

Molecular friction rarely upsets the dominant balances (geostrophic and hydrostatic) in the ocean. With kinematic viscosities of  v=10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;m &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;  the Ekman number is several orders of magnitude smaller than unity; therefore, molecular frictional forces are certainly negligible for large-scale oceanic motions. Similar argument holds for the tracer equations, where the molecular thermodiffusivity and salt diffusivity lead to Reynolds number of negligible magnitude, which means the molecular diffusive time scales are much longer than advective time scale. So we can thus safely conclude that the direct effects of molecular processes are insignificant for large-scale. Yet the molecular friction is essential somewhere. The point is that large-scale motions in the ocean interacted with other scales by the nonlinearities in primitive equation. We can show that by Reynolds approach, which will leads to the closure problem. That means new variables arise at each level in the Reynolds averaging procedure.  This leads to the need of parameterization scheme to account for those sub grid scale effects.

Here is a schematic “family tree” of subgridscale (SGS) mixing schemes. Although there is considerable degree of overlap and inter relatedness among the huge variety of schemes in use today, several branch points maybe defined. Most importantly, the approaches for lateral and vertical subgridscale closure vary considerably. Filters and higher-order operators are used to remove small-scale noise that is numerically necessary. Those special dynamical parameterizations (topographic stress, eddy thickness diffusion and convection) are becoming available for certain processes. 
In the vertical, the surface mixed layer (sml) has historically received special attention because of its important role in air-sea exchange. Now there are so many schemes can be chose from: Price-Weller-Pinkel, Pacanowksi and Philander, bulk, Mellor-Yamada and KPP (k-profile parameterization) schemes.

Adaptive (non-constant) mixing length schemes are widely used for parameterization of both lateral and vertical mixing. In the horizontal, parameterizations dependent on the rates of stress and strain (Smagroinsky), grid spacing and Reynolds number (Re) have been advocated. In the vertical, vertical mixing as a function stability frequency (N^2) and/or Richardson number are historically prevalent. The rotated mixing tensors scheme is the one considering the angle of the principle direction of mixing, as for in the main thermocline, mixing along isopycnals dominates diapycnal mixing. There for the principle direction of mixing is neither strictly vertical nor purely horizontal, but a spatially variable mixture of the two.

==Comparison with Atmospheric General Circulation Model==
OGCMs and [[Global climate model|AGCMs]] have much in common, such as, the equations of motion and the numerical techniques. However, OGCMs have some unique features. For example, the atmosphere is forced thermally throughout its volume, the ocean is forced both thermally and mechanically primarily at its surface, in addition, the geometry of ocean basins is very complex.  The boundary conditions are totally different. For ocean models, we need to consider those narrow but important boundary layers on nearly all bounding surfaces as well as within the oceanic interior. These boundary conditions on ocean flows are difficult to define and to parameterize, which results in a high computationally demand.

Ocean modeling is also strongly constrained by the existence in much of the world’s oceans of mesoscale eddies with time and space scales, respectively, of weeks to months and tens to hundreds of kilometers. Dynamically, these nearly geostrophic turbulent eddies are the oceanographic counterparts of the atmospheric synoptic scale. Nevertheless, there are important differences. First, ocean eddies are not perturbations on an energetic mean flow. They may play an important role in the poleward transport of heat. Second, they are relatively small in horizontal extent so that ocean climate models, which must have the same overall exterior dimensions as AGCMs, may require as much as 20 times the resolution as AGCM if the eddies are to be explicitly resolved.

Most of the difference between OGCMs and AGCMs is that the data are sparser for OGCMs. Also, the data are not only sparse but also nonuniform and indirect{{explanation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Classification==
We can classify ocean models according to different standards. For example, according to vertical ordinates we have geo-potential, isopycnal and topography-following models.  According to horizontal discretizations we have unstaggered or staggered grids.  According to methods of approximation we have finite difference and finite element models. There are three basic types of OGCMs: 

1. Idealized geometry models 

Models with idealized basin geometry have been used extensively in ocean modeling and have played a major role in the development of new modeling methodologies. They use a simplified geometry, offering a basin itself, while the distribution of winds and buoyancy force are generally chosen as simple functions of latitude.

2. Basin-scale models

To compare OGCM results with observations we need realistic basin information instead of idealized data. However, if we only pay attention to local observation data, we don’t need to run whole global simulation, and by doing that we can save a lot of computational resources. 

3. Global models 

This kind of model is the most computationally costly one. More experiments are needed as a preliminary step in constructing coupled Earth system models.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17683">'''Polyhedral combinatorics''' is a branch of [[mathematics]], within [[combinatorics]] and [[discrete geometry]], that studies the problems of counting and describing the faces of [[convex polyhedron|convex polyhedra]] and higher-dimensional [[convex polytope]]s.

Research in polyhedral combinatorics falls into two distinct areas. Mathematicians in this area study the [[combinatorics]] of polytopes; for instance, they seek [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] that describe the relations between the numbers of [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]], [[edge (geometry)|edges]], and faces of higher dimensions in arbitrary polytopes or in certain important subclasses of polytopes, and study other combinatorial properties of polytopes such as their [[Connectivity (graph theory)|connectivity]] and [[diameter]] (number of steps needed to reach any vertex from any other vertex). Additionally, many computer scientists use the phrase “polyhedral combinatorics” to describe research into precise descriptions of the faces of certain specific polytopes (especially 0-1 polytopes, whose vertices are subsets of a [[hypercube]]) arising from [[integer programming]] problems.

==Faces and face-counting vectors==
[[File:Pyramid face lattice.svg|thumb|The [[face lattice]] of a convex polytope.]]
A ''face'' of a convex polytope ''P'' may be defined as the intersection of ''P'' and a closed halfspace ''H'' such that the boundary of ''H'' contains no interior point of ''P''. The dimension of a face is the dimension of this hull. The 0-dimensional faces are the vertices themselves, and the 1-dimensional faces (called ''edges'') are [[line segment]]s connecting pairs of vertices. Note that this definition also includes as faces the empty set and the whole polytope ''P''. If ''P'' itself has dimension ''d'', the faces of ''P'' with dimension ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 are called ''facets'' of ''P'' and the faces with dimension ''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2 are called ''[[Ridge (geometry)|ridges]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The faces of ''P'' may be [[partial order|partially ordered]] by inclusion, forming a [[face lattice]] that has as its top element ''P'' itself and as its bottom element the empty set.

A key tool in polyhedral combinatorics is the ''ƒ-vector'' of a polytope,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt; the vector (''f''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the number of ''i''-dimensional features of the polytope. For instance, a [[cube]] has eight vertices, twelve edges, and six facets, so its ƒ-vector is (8,12,6). The [[dual polyhedron|dual polytope]] has a ƒ-vector with the same numbers in the reverse order; thus, for instance, the [[regular octahedron]], the dual to a cube, has the ƒ-vector (6,12,8). [[Configuration_(geometry)#Higher_dimensions|Configuration]] matrices include the f-vectors of regular polytopes as diagonal elements.

The ''extended ƒ-vector'' is formed by concatenating the number one at each end of the ƒ-vector, counting the number of objects at all levels of the face lattice; on the left side of the vector, ''f''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 counts the empty set as a face, while on the right side, ''f&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 counts ''P'' itself.
For the cube the extended ƒ-vector is (1,8,12,6,1) and for the octahedron it is (1,6,12,8,1). Although the vectors for these example polyhedra are [[unimodal]] (the coefficients, taken in left to right order, increase to a maximum and then decrease), there are higher-dimensional polytopes for which this is not true.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[simplicial polytope]]s (polytopes in which every facet is a [[simplex]]), it is often convenient to transform these vectors, producing a different vector called the ''h''-vector. If we interpret the terms of the ƒ-vector (omitting the final 1) as coefficients of a polynomial ƒ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;Σ''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;x''&lt;sup&gt;''d''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1&lt;/sup&gt; (for instance, for the octahedron this gives the polynomial ƒ(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;6''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;12''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;8), then the ''h''-vector lists the coefficients of the polynomial ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1) (again, for the octahedron, ''h''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1).&lt;ref name="ds"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, pp. 246–253.&lt;/ref&gt; As Ziegler writes, “for various problems about simplicial polytopes, ''h''-vectors are a much more convenient and concise way to encode the information about the face numbers than &amp;fnof;-vectors.”

==Equalities and inequalities==
The most important relation among the coefficients of the ƒ-vector of a polytope is [[Euler characteristic|Euler's formula]] Σ(−1)&lt;sup&gt;''i''&lt;/sup&gt;''f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, where the terms of the sum range over the coefficients of the extended ƒ-vector. In three dimensions, moving the two 1's at the left and right ends of the extended ƒ-vector (1, ''v'', ''e'', ''f'', 1) to the right hand side of the equation transforms this identity into the more familiar form ''v'' − ''e'' + ''f'' = 2. From the fact that each facet of a three-dimensional polyhedron has at least three edges, it follows by [[Double counting (proof technique)|double counting]] that 2''e'' ≥ 3''f''&lt;!-- each face has at least 3 edges, but each edge is on exactly 2 faces --&gt;, and using this inequality to eliminate ''e'' and ''f'' from Euler's formula leads to the further inequalities ''e'' ≤ 3''v'' − 6&lt;!-- e+2=v+f≤v+(2/3)e, so e≤3v-6 --&gt; and ''f'' ≤ 2''v'' − 4&lt;!-- v+f=e+2≥(3/2)f+2, so 2v-4 ≥ f --&gt;. By duality, ''e'' ≤ 3''f'' − 6 and ''v'' ≤ 2''f'' − 4. It follows from [[Steinitz's theorem]] that any 3-dimensional integer vector satisfying these equalities and inequalities is the ƒ-vector of a convex polyhedron.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Steinitz|1906}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In higher dimensions, other relations among the numbers of faces of a polytope become important as well, including the [[Dehn–Sommerville equations]] which, expressed in terms of [[h-vector|''h''-vectors]] of simplicial polytopes, take the simple form ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''h''&lt;sub&gt;''d'' − ''k''&lt;/sub&gt; for all ''k''. The instance of these equations with ''k'' = 0 is equivalent to Euler's formula but for ''d'' &amp;gt; 3 the other instances of these equations are linearly independent of each other and constrain the ''h''-vectors (and therefore also the ƒ-vectors) in additional ways.&lt;ref name="ds"/&gt;

Another important inequality on polytope face counts is given by the [[upper bound theorem]], first proven by {{harvtxt|McMullen|1970}}, which states that a ''d''-dimensional polytope with ''n'' vertices can have at most as many faces of any other dimension as a [[neighborly polytope]] with the same number of vertices:
:&lt;math&gt;f_{k-1} \le \sum_{i=0}^{d/2} {}^* \left( \binom{d-i}{k-i}+\binom{i}{k-d+i} \right) \binom{n-d-1+i}{i},&lt;/math&gt;
where the asterisk means that the final term of the sum should be halved when ''d'' is even.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, pp. 254–258.&lt;/ref&gt; Asymptotically, this implies that there are at most &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle O(n^{\lfloor d/2\rfloor})&lt;/math&gt; faces of all dimensions.

Even in four dimensions, the set of possible ƒ-vectors of convex polytopes does not form a convex subset of the four-dimensional integer lattice, and much remains unknown about the possible values of these vectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Höppner|Ziegler|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graph-theoretic properties==
Along with investigating the numbers of faces of polytopes, researchers have studied other combinatorial properties of them, such as descriptions of the [[undirected graph|graphs]] obtained from the vertices and edges of polytopes (their [[n-skeleton|1-skeleta]]).

[[Balinski's theorem]] states that the graph obtained in this way from any ''d''-dimensional convex polytope is [[k-vertex-connected graph|''d''-vertex-connected]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Balinski|1961}}; {{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of three-dimensional polyhedra, this property and [[planar graph|planarity]] may be used to exactly characterize the graphs of polyhedra: [[Steinitz's theorem]] states that ''G'' is the skeleton of a three-dimensional polyhedron if and only if ''G'' is a 3-vertex-connected planar graph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|1995}}, pp. 103–126.&lt;/ref&gt;

A theorem of {{harvtxt|Blind|Mani-Levitska|1987}} (previously conjectured by [[Micha Perles]]) states that one can reconstruct the face structure of a [[simple polytope]] from its graph. That is, if a given undirected graph is the skeleton of a simple polytope, there is only one polytope (up to combinatorial equivalence) for which this is true.  This is in sharp contrast with (non-simple) neighborly polytopes whose graph is a [[complete graph]]; there can be many different neighborly polytopes for the same graph.  Another proof of this theorem based on [[unique sink orientation]]s was given by {{harvtxt|Kalai|1988}}, and {{harvtxt|Friedman|2009}} showed how to use this theorem to derive a [[polynomial time]] algorithm for reconstructing the face lattices of simple polytopes from their graphs. However, testing whether a given graph or lattice can be realized as the face lattice of a simple polytope is equivalent (by polarity) to realization of [[simplicial polytope]]s, which was shown to be complete for the [[existential theory of the reals]] by {{harvtxt|Adiprasito|Padrol|2014}}.

In the context of the [[simplex method]] for [[linear programming]], it is important to understand the [[diameter]] of a polytope, the minimum number of edges needed to reach any vertex by a path from any other vertex. The system of [[linear inequality|linear inequalities]] of a linear program define facets of a polytope representing all feasible solutions to the program, and the simplex method finds the optimal solution by following a path in this polytope. Thus, the diameter provides a [[lower bound]] on the number of steps this method requires. The [[Hirsch conjecture]], now disproved, suggested a strong bound on how large the diameter could be.{{sfnp|Santos|2011}} Weaker (quasi-polynomial) upper bounds on the diameter are known,{{sfnp|Kalai|Kleitman|1992}} as well as proofs of the Hirsch conjecture for special classes of polytope.{{sfnp|Naddef|1989}}

==Computational properties==
Deciding whether the number of vertices of a given polytope is bounded by some natural number ''k'' is a computationally difficult problem and complete for the complexity class [[PP (complexity)|PP]].{{sfnp|Haase|Kiefer|2016|loc=Thm. 5}}

==Facets of 0-1 polytopes==
It is important in the context of [[cutting-plane method]]s for [[integer programming]] to be able to describe accurately the [[facet (geometry)|facets]] of polytopes that have vertices corresponding to the solutions of combinatorial optimization problems. Often, these problems have solutions that can be described by [[Bit array|binary vectors]], and the corresponding polytopes have vertex coordinates that are all zero or one.

As an example, consider the [[Birkhoff polytope]], the set of ''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''n'' matrices that can be formed from [[convex combination]]s of [[permutation matrices]]. Equivalently, its vertices can be thought of as describing all [[perfect matching]]s in a [[complete bipartite graph]], and a linear optimization problem on this polytope can be interpreted as a bipartite minimum weight perfect matching problem. The ''Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem'' states that this polytope can be described by two types of linear inequality or equality. First, for each matrix cell, there is a constraint that this cell has a non-negative value. And second, for each row or column of the matrix, there is a constraint that the sum of the cells in that row or column equal one. The row and column constraints define a linear subspace of dimension ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;2''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 in which the Birkhoff polytope lies, and the non-negativity constraints define facets of the Birkhoff polytope within that subspace.

However, the Birkhoff polytope is unusual in that a complete description of its facets is available. For many other 0-1 polytopes, there are exponentially many or superexponentially many facets, and only partial descriptions of their facets are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ziegler|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[elementary algebra]], the '''quadratic formula''' is the solution of the [[quadratic equation]]. There are other ways to solve the quadratic equation instead of using the quadratic formula, such as [[Factorization|factoring]], [[completing the square]], or [[Graph of a function|graphing]]. Using the quadratic formula is often the most convenient way.

The general quadratic equation is

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''x''}} represents an unknown, while {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and {{math|''c''}} are [[Constant term|constant]]s with {{math|''a''}} not equal to 0. One can verify that the quadratic formula satisfies the quadratic equation by inserting the former into the latter. With the above parameterization, the quadratic formula is: 

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Each of the solutions given by the quadratic formula is called a [[Zero of a function|root]] of the quadratic equation. Geometrically, these roots represent the {{math|''x''}} values at which ''any'' [[parabola]], explicitly given as {{math|''y'' {{=}} ''ax''{{sup|2}} + ''bx'' + ''c''}}, crosses the {{math|''x''}}-axis. As well as being a formula that will yield the zeros of any parabola, the quadratic formula will give the axis of symmetry of the parabola, and it can be used to immediately determine how many [[Real number|real]] zeros the quadratic equation has.

==Historical development==

The earliest methods for solving quadratic equations were geometric. Babylonian cuneiform tablets contain problems reducible to solving quadratic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Ron|title=Beyond the Quadratic Formula|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CV_UInCRO38C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2013|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-783-0|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Egyptian [[Berlin Papyrus 6619|Berlin Papyrus]], dating back to the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] (2050 BC to 1650 BC), contains the solution to a two-term quadratic equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Ancient History Part 2 Early History of the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;pg=PA530|year=1971|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-07791-0|page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scuola di atene 07.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Euclid]] in [[Raphael Sanzio]]'s [[School of Athens]]]]

The Greek mathematician [[Euclid]] (circa 300 BC) used geometric methods to solve quadratic equations in Book 2 of his ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]'', an influential mathematical treatise.&lt;ref name=quad/&gt; Rules for quadratic equations appear in the Chinese ''[[The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art]]'' circa 200 BC.&lt;ref name=Aitken&gt;{{cite web|last=Aitken|first=Wayne|title=A Chinese Classic: The Nine Chapters|url=http://public.csusm.edu/aitken_html/m330/china/ninechapters.pdf|publisher=Mathematics Department, California State University|accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David Eugene|title=History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTytJGnTf1kC&amp;pg=PA380|year=1958|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=978-0-486-20430-7|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his work ''[[Arithmetica]]'', the Greek mathematician [[Diophantus]] (circa 250 BC) solved quadratic equations with a method more recognizably algebraic than the geometric algebra of Euclid.&lt;ref name=quad&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Ron|title=Beyond the Quadratic Formula|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CV_UInCRO38C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2013|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-783-0|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; His solution gives only one root, even when both roots are positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David Eugene|title=History of Mathematics|url=https://books.google.com/?id=12qdOZ0gsWoC&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|year=1958|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=0-486-20429-4|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian mathematician [[Brahmagupta]] (597–668 AD) explicitly described the quadratic formula in his treatise ''[[Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta]]'' published in 628 AD,&lt;ref name=Bradley&gt;Bradley, Michael. ''The Birth of Mathematics: Ancient Times to 1300'', p. 86 (Infobase Publishing 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; but written in words instead of symbols.&lt;ref&gt;Mackenzie, Dana. ''The Universe in Zero Words: The Story of Mathematics as Told through Equations'', p. 61 (Princeton University Press, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; His solution of the quadratic equation {{math|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bx'' = ''c''}} was as follows: "To the absolute number multiplied by four times the [coefficient of the] square, add the square of the [coefficient of the] middle term; the square root of the same, less the [coefficient of the] middle term, being divided by twice the [coefficient of the] square is the value."&lt;ref name=Stillwell2004&gt;{{cite book |last=Stillwell |first=John |title=Mathematics and Its History (2nd ed.) |year=2004 |publisher=Springer |isbn=0-387-95336-1|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This is equivalent to:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\sqrt{4ac+b^2}-b}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The 9th-century Persian mathematician [[Muḥammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] solved quadratic equations algebraically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Irving|first=Ron|title=Beyond the Quadratic Formula|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CV_UInCRO38C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2013|publisher=MAA|isbn=978-0-88385-783-0|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quadratic formula covering all cases was first obtained by [[Simon Stevin]] in 1594.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Principal Works of Simon Stevin, Mathematics |volume=II-B |first1=D.

''An Investigation of Secondary School Algebra Teachers' Mathematical Knowledge for Teaching Algebraic Equation Solving'', p. 56 (ProQuest, 2007): "The quadratic formula is the most general method for solving quadratic equations and is derived from another general method: completing the square."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rockswold, Gary. ''College algebra and trigonometry and precalculus'', p. 178 (Addison Wesley, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beckenbach, Edwin et al. ''Modern college algebra and trigonometry'', p. 81 (Wadsworth Pub. Co., 1986).&lt;/ref&gt; The two derivations are as follows:

====Method 1====
Divide the quadratic equation by {{math|''a''}}, which is allowed because {{math|''a''}} is non-zero:

:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x + \frac{c}{a}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Subtract {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} from both sides of the equation, yielding:
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 + \frac{b}{a} x= -\frac{c}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The quadratic equation is now in a form to which the method of [[completing the square]] can be applied. Thus, add a constant to both sides of the equation such that the left hand side becomes a complete square.

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+\frac{b}{a}x+\left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 =-\frac{c}{a}+\left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2,&lt;/math&gt;

which produces:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=-\frac{c}{a}+\frac{b^2}{4a^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, after rearranging the terms on the right hand side to have a common denominator, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(x+\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The square has thus been completed. Taking the [[square root]] of both sides yields the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x+\frac{b}{2a}=\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Isolating {{math|''x''}} gives the quadratic formula:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[plus-minus sign|plus-minus symbol "±"]] indicates that both

:&lt;math&gt; x=\frac{-b + \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}\quad\text{and}\quad x=\frac{-b - \sqrt {b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

are solutions of the quadratic equation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sterling|first=Mary Jane|title=Algebra I For Dummies|year=2010|publisher=Wiley Publishing|isbn=978-0-470-55964-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2toggaqJMzEC&amp;pg=PA219&amp;dq=quadratic+formula#v=onepage&amp;q=quadratic%20formula&amp;f=false|page=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many alternatives of this derivation with minor differences, mostly concerning the manipulation of {{math|''a''}}.

An alternative way to write the quadratic formula is:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;

which may be simplified to:

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b}{2a} \pm \sqrt{\left(\frac{b}{2a}\right)^2-\frac{c}{a}} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

This version of the formula is convenient when complex roots are acceptable. Then the expression outside the square root will be the real part and the square root expression will be the imaginary part. The expression inside the square root is a discriminant.

Some sources, particularly older ones, use alternative parameterizations of the quadratic equation such as {{math|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − 2''bx'' + ''c'' = 0}}&lt;ref name="kahan"&gt;{{Citation |first=Willian |last=Kahan |title=On the Cost of Floating-Point Computation Without Extra-Precise Arithmetic |url=http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/Qdrtcs.pdf |date=November 20, 2004 |accessdate=2012-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or {{math|1=''ax''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 2''bx'' + ''c'' = 0}},&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.proofwiki.org/wiki/Quadratic_Formula |title=Quadratic Formula |journal=Proof Wiki |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; where {{math|''b''}} has a magnitude one half of the more common one. These result in slightly different forms for the solution, but are otherwise equivalent.

A lesser known quadratic formula, as used in [[Muller's method]], and which can be found from [[Vieta's formulas]], provides the same roots via the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-2c}{b\mp\sqrt{b^2-4ac}} = \frac{2c}{-b \pm \sqrt {b^2-4ac\ }} \ .&lt;/math&gt;

====Method 2====
The majority of algebra texts published over the last several decades teach [[completing the square]] using the sequence presented earlier: (1) divide each side by {{math|''a''}} to make the equation monic, (2) rearrange, (3) then add {{math|({{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}})&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to both sides to complete the square.

As pointed out by Larry Hoehn in 1975, completing the square can be accomplished by a different sequence that leads to a simpler sequence of intermediate terms: (1) multiply each side by {{math|4''a''}}, (2) rearrange, (3) then add {{math|''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;ref name=Hoehn1975&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoehn |first=Larry |title=A More Elegant Method of Deriving the Quadratic Formula |journal=The Mathematics Teacher |year=1975 |volume=68 |issue=5 |page=442&amp;ndash;443}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, the quadratic formula can be derived as follows: 

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
ax^2+bx+c &amp;= 0 \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + 4ac &amp;= 0 \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx &amp;= -4ac \\
4 a^2 x^2 + 4abx + b^2 &amp;= b^2 - 4ac \\
(2ax + b)^2 &amp;= b^2 - 4ac \\
2ax + b &amp;= \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\
2ax &amp;= -b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\ 
x &amp;= \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac }}{2a} \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This actually represents an ancient derivation of the quadratic formula and was known to the Hindus at least as far back as 1025.&lt;ref name=Smith1958&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=David E.|title=History of Mathematics, Vol. II|year=1958|publisher=Dover Publications|isbn=0486204308|page=446}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with the derivation in standard usage, this alternate derivation is shorter, involves fewer computations with literal coefficients, avoids fractions until the last step, has simpler expressions, and uses simpler mathematics. As Hoehn states, "it is easier 'to add the square of {{math|''b''}}' than it is 'to add the square of half the coefficient of the {{math|''x''}} term'".&lt;ref name=Hoehn1975/&gt;

Many ''alternative derivations'' of the quadratic formula are in the literature. These derivations may be simpler than the standard completing the square method and represent interesting applications of other algebraic techniques or may offer insight into other areas of mathematics.

===By substitution===
Another technique is solution by [[substitution (algebra)|substitution]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph J. Rotman. (2010). Advanced modern algebra (Vol. 114). American Mathematical Soc. Section 1.1&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique, we substitute {{math|1=''x'' = ''y'' + ''m''}} into the quadratic to get:

:&lt;math&gt;a(y+m)^2 + b(y+m) + c =0.&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the result and then collecting the powers of {{math|''y''}} produces:

:&lt;math&gt;ay^2 + y(2am + b) + \left(am^2+bm+c\right) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

We have not yet imposed a second condition on {{math|''y''}} and {{math|''m''}}, so we now choose {{math|''m''}} so that the middle term vanishes. That is, {{math|1=2''am'' + ''b'' = 0}} or {{math|''m'' {{=}} {{sfrac|−''b''|2''a''}}}}. Subtracting the constant term from both sides of the equation (to move it to the right hand side) and then dividing by {{math|''a''}} gives:

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=\frac{-\left(am^2+bm+c\right)}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for {{math|''m''}} gives:

:&lt;math&gt;y^2=\frac{-\left(\frac{b^2}{4a}+\frac{-b^2}{2a}+c\right)}{a}=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;y=\pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

substituting {{math|1=''x'' = ''y'' + ''m'' = ''y'' −{{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}}}} provides the quadratic formula

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

===By using algebraic identities===
The following method was used by many historical mathematicians:&lt;ref&gt;Debnath, L. (2009). The legacy of Leonhard Euler–a tricentennial tribute. International Journal of Mathematical Education in Science and Technology, 40(3), 353–388. Section 3.6&lt;/ref&gt;

Let the roots of the standard quadratic equation be {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The derivation starts by recalling the identity:

:&lt;math&gt;(r_1 - r_2)^2 = (r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Taking the square root on both sides, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 - r_2 = \pm\sqrt{(r_1 + r_2)^2 - 4r_1r_2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the coefficient {{math|1=''a'' ≠ 0}}, we can divide the standard equation by {{math|''a''}} to obtain a quadratic polynomial having the same roots. Namely,

:&lt;math&gt; x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \frac{c}{a} = (x - r_1)(x-r_2) = x^2 - (r_1 + r_2)x + r_1 r_2.&lt;/math&gt;

From this we can see that the sum of the roots of the standard quadratic equation is given by {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, and the product of those roots is given by {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}}.
&lt;!--
We know that the sum of roots of the standard quadratic equation is given by {{math|−{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} + \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-b - b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac} - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} = \frac{-2b}{2a} = -\frac{b}{a}&lt;/math&gt;

Additionally, the product is given by {{math|{{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \cdot \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} = \frac{(-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})(-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac})}{4a^2} = \frac{b^2 - (b^2 - 4ac)}{4a^2} = \frac{4ac}{4a^2} = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
--&gt;
Hence the identity can be rewritten as:

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 - r_2 = \pm\sqrt{\left(-\frac{b}{a}\right)^2-4\frac{c}{a}} = \pm\sqrt{\frac{b^2}{a^2} - \frac{4ac}{a^2}} = \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Now, 

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \frac{(r_1 + r_2) + (r_1 - r_2)}{2} = \frac{-\frac{b}{a} \pm \frac{\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{a}}{2} = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} −''r''{{sub|1}} − {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, if we take

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

then we obtain

:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ;&lt;/math&gt;

and if we instead take

:&lt;math&gt;r_1 = \frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

then we calculate that

:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Combining these results by using the standard shorthand ±, we have that the solutions of the quadratic equation are given by:

:&lt;math&gt; x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

===By Lagrange resolvents===
{{details|Lagrange resolvents}}
An alternative way of deriving the quadratic formula is via the method of [[Lagrange resolvents]],&lt;ref name=Clark&gt;Clark, A. (1984). ''Elements of abstract algebra''. Courier Corporation. p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; which is an early part of [[Galois theory]].&lt;ref name="efei"&gt;{{citation

}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fcp9IiZd3tQC&amp;pg=PA134#PPA134,M1 §6.2, p. 134]&lt;/ref&gt;
This method can be generalized to give the roots of [[cubic polynomial]]s and [[quartic polynomial]]s, and leads to Galois theory, which allows one to understand the solution of algebraic equations of any degree in terms of the [[symmetry group]] of their roots, the [[Galois group]].

This approach focuses on the ''roots'' more than on rearranging the original equation. Given a monic quadratic polynomial

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+px+q,&lt;/math&gt; 

assume that it factors as

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+px+q=(x-\alpha)(x-\beta),&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding yields

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+px+q=x^2-(\alpha+\beta)x+\alpha \beta,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p'' {{=}} −(''α'' + ''β'')}} and {{math|''q'' {{=}} ''αβ''}}.

Since the order of multiplication does not matter, one can switch {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} and the values of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} will not change: one can say that {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}} are [[symmetric polynomials]] in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}. In fact, they are the [[elementary symmetric polynomials]] – any symmetric polynomial in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} can be expressed in terms of {{math|''α'' + ''β''}} and {{math|''αβ''}} The Galois theory approach to analyzing and solving polynomials is: given the coefficients of a polynomial, which are symmetric functions in the roots, can one "break the symmetry" and recover the roots? Thus solving a polynomial of degree {{math|''n''}} is related to the ways of rearranging ("permuting") {{math|''n''}} terms, which is called the [[symmetric group]] on {{math|''n''}} letters, and denoted {{math|''S{{sub|n}}''}}. For the quadratic polynomial, the only way to rearrange two terms is to swap them ("[[Transposition (mathematics)|transpose]]" them), and thus solving a quadratic polynomial is simple.

To find the roots {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}, consider their sum and difference:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r_1 &amp;= \alpha + \beta\\
r_2 &amp;= \alpha - \beta.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

These are called the ''Lagrange resolvents'' of the polynomial; notice that one of these depends on the order of the roots, which is the key point. One can recover the roots from the resolvents by inverting the above equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(r_1+r_2\right)\\
\beta  &amp;= \textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(r_1-r_2\right).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, solving for the resolvents gives the original roots.

Now {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} ''α'' + ''β''}} is a symmetric function in {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}}, so it can be expressed in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, and in fact {{math|''r''{{sub|1}} {{=}} −''p''}} as noted above. But {{math|''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''α'' − ''β''}} is not symmetric, since switching {{math|''α''}} and {{math|''β''}} yields {{math|−''r''{{sub|2}} {{=}} ''β'' − ''α''}} (formally, this is termed a [[group action]] of the symmetric group of the roots). Since {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} is not symmetric, it cannot be expressed in terms of the coefficients {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}, as these are symmetric in the roots and thus so is any polynomial expression involving them. Changing the order of the roots only changes {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} by a factor of −1, and thus the square {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} (''α'' − ''β''){{sup|2}}}} is symmetric in the roots, and thus expressible in terms of {{math|''p''}} and {{math|''q''}}. Using the equation

:&lt;math&gt;(\alpha - \beta)^2 = (\alpha + \beta)^2 - 4\alpha\beta\!&lt;/math&gt;

yields

:&lt;math&gt;r_2^2 = p^2 - 4q\!&lt;/math&gt;

and thus

:&lt;math&gt;r_2 = \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}.\!&lt;/math&gt;

If one takes the positive root, breaking symmetry, one obtains:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r_1 &amp;= -p\\
r_2 &amp;= \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
and thus
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\alpha &amp;= \tfrac12\left(-p+\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)\\
\beta  &amp;= \tfrac12\left(-p-\sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus the roots are
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}\left(-p \pm \sqrt{p^2 - 4q}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which is the quadratic formula. Substituting {{math|''p'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}, ''q'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''a''}}}} yields the usual form for when a quadratic is not monic. The resolvents can be recognized as {{math|{{sfrac|''r''{{sub|1}}|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|−''p''|2}} {{=}} {{sfrac|−''b''|2''a''}}}} being the vertex, and {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}{{sup|2}} {{=}} ''p''{{sup|2}} − 4''q''}} is the discriminant (of a monic polynomial).

A similar but more complicated method works for [[cubic equation]]s, where one has three resolvents and a quadratic equation (the "resolving polynomial") relating {{math|''r''{{sub|2}}}} and {{math|''r''{{sub|3}}}}, which one can solve by the quadratic equation, and similarly for a [[quartic equation]] (degree 4), whose resolving polynomial is a cubic, which can in turn be solved.&lt;ref name=Clark/&gt; The same method for a [[quintic equation]] yields a polynomial of degree 24, which does not simplify the problem, and, in fact, solutions to quintic equations in general cannot be expressed using only roots.

===By extrema===
Knowing the value of {{math|''x''}} in the functional extreme point makes it possible to solve only for the increase (or decrease) needed in {{math|''x''}} to solve the quadratic equation. This method first uses differentiation to find the {{math|''x''}} value at the extremum, called {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;}}. We then solve for the value, {{math|''q''}}, that ensures that {{math|''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q'') {{=}} 0}}. While this may not be the most intuitive method, it ensures that the mathematics is straightforward.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
f(x) &amp; =ax^2+bx+c \\[5pt]
\frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &amp; =2ax+b
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Setting the above differential to zero will give us the extrema of the quadratic function
:&lt;math&gt;x_\text{ext}=\frac{-b}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

We define {{math|''q''}} as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; q=x_0-x_\text{ext} \, &lt;/math&gt;

Here {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the value of {{math|''x''}} that solves the quadratic equation. The sum of {{math|''x''&lt;sub&gt;ext&lt;/sub&gt;}} and the variable of interest, {{math|''q''}}, is plugged into the quadratic equation

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
a\left(\frac{-b}{2a}+q\right)^2+b\left(\frac{-b}{2a}+q\right)+c&amp;=0 \\[5pt]
\left(\frac{-b}{2a}+q\right)^2+\frac{b}{a}\left(\frac{-b}{2a} + q \right) +\frac{c}{a}&amp;=0 &amp;&amp;(a\neq 0)\\[5pt]
\frac{b^2}{4a^2}+q^2-\frac{bq}{a}-\frac{b^2}{2a^2}+\frac {bq} a + \frac{c}{a}&amp;=0 \\[5pt]
\frac{-b^2}{4a^2}+q^2+\frac{c}{a}&amp;=0 \\[5pt]
q^2&amp;=\frac{b^2-4ac}{4a^2} \\[5pt]
q&amp;=\frac{\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} \\[5pt]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of {{math|''x''}} in the extreme point is then added to both sides of the equation
:&lt;math&gt; x_0=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

This gives the quadratic formula. This way one avoids the technique of completing the square and much more complicated math is not needed. Note this solution is very similar to solving deriving the formula by substitution.

===By splitting into real and imaginary parts===
{{quadratic_function_graph_complex_roots.svg}}
Consider the equation
:&lt;math&gt; a z^2 + b z + c = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy&lt;/math&gt; is a complex number and where ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' are real numbers. Then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 a (x + iy)^2 + b (x + iy) + c &amp;= 0,\\
 a (x^2 - y^2 + i2xy) + b(x + iy) + c &amp;= 0.\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
This splits into two equations, the real part:
:&lt;math&gt; a(x^2 - y^2) + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and the imaginary part:
:&lt;math&gt; 2axy + by = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

Assuming that &lt;math&gt;y \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; then divide the second equation by ''y'':
:&lt;math&gt; 2ax + b = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and solve for ''x'':
:&lt;math&gt; x = {-b \over 2a}&lt;/math&gt;.
Substitute this value for ''x'' into the first equation and solve for ''y'':
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 a \Big( {b^2 \over 4 a^2} - y^2 \Big) - {b^2 \over 2 a} + c &amp;= 0\\
 {b^2 \over 4a} - ay^2 - {2b^2 \over 4a} + c &amp;= 0\\
 {-b^2 \over 4a} - ay^2 + c &amp;= 0\\
 ay^2 + {b^2 \over 4a} - c &amp;= 0\\
 y^2 &amp;= {c \over a} - {b^2 \over 4a^2}\\
 y &amp;= \pm \sqrt{{c\over a} - {b^2 \over 4a^2}} = {\pm \sqrt{ca - {b^2 \over 4}} \over a} = {\pm \sqrt{4ca - b^2} \over 2a}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;z = x + iy&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 z &amp;= {-b \over 2a} \pm {i \sqrt{4ac - b^2} \over 2a}\\
 z &amp;= {-b \over 2a} \pm {\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a} = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a}\\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;.
Even though ''y'' was assumed to be non-zero, this last formula works for any roots of the original equation, whereas assuming that &lt;math&gt;y = 0&lt;/math&gt; turns out to be of not much help (trivial and circular).

==Significant Uses==
===Geometrical significance===
{{quadratic_equation_graph_key_points.svg}}
In terms of coordinate geometry, a parabola is a curve whose {{math|(''x'', ''y'')}}-coordinates are described by a second-degree polynomial, i.e. any equation of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;y =p(x) = a_2x^2 + a_1x +a_0, &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''p''}} represents the polynomial of degree 2 and {{math|''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,}} and {{math|1=''a''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0}} are constant coefficients whose subscripts correspond to their respective term's degree. The geometrical interpretation of the quadratic formula is that it defines the points on the {{math|''x''}}-axis where the parabola will cross the axis. Additionally, if the quadratic formula was looked at as two terms,

:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}=-\frac{b}{2a} \pm\frac{\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

the [[axis of symmetry]] appears as the line {{math|1=''x'' = −{{sfrac|''b''|2''a''}}}}. The other term, {{math|{{sfrac|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac''}}|2''a''}}}}, gives the distance the zeros are away from the axis of symmetry, where the plus sign represents the distance to the right, and the minus sign represents the distance to the left. 

If this distance term were to decrease to zero, the value of the axis of symmetry would be the {{math|''x''}} value of the only zero, that is, there is only one possible solution to the quadratic equation. Algebraically, this means that {{math|{{sqrt|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac''}} {{=}} 0}}, or simply {{math|''b''{{sup|2}} − 4''ac'' {{=}} 0}} (where the left-hand side is referred to as the ''discriminant''). This is one of three cases, where the discriminant indicates how many zeros the parabola will have. If the discriminant is positive, the distance would be non-zero, and there will be two solutions. However, there is also the case where the discriminant is less than zero, and this indicates the distance will be ''imaginary''{{snd}} or some multiple of the complex unit {{math|''i''}}, where {{math|''i'' {{=}} {{sqrt|−1}}}}{{snd}} and the parabola's zeros will be [[complex number]]s. The complex roots will be [[complex conjugate]]s, where the real part of the complex roots will be the value of the axis of symmetry. There will be no real values of {{math|''x''}} where the parabola crosses the {{math|''x''}}-axis.

===Dimensional analysis===
If the constants {{math|''a''}}, {{math|''b''}}, and/or {{math|''c''}} are not [[unitless]], then the units of {{math|''x''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''|''a''}}}}, due to the requirement that {{math|''ax''{{sup|2}}}} and {{math|''bx''}} agree on their units. Furthermore, by the same logic, the units of {{math|''c''}} must be equal to the units of {{math|{{sfrac|''b''{{sup|2}}|''a''}}}}, which can be verified without solving for {{math|''x''}}. This can be a powerful tool for verifying that a quadratic expression of [[physical quantities]] has been set up correctly, prior to solving it.

In [[number theory]], a branch of [[mathematics]], '''Ramanujan's sum''', usually denoted ''c&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''n''), is a function of two positive integer variables ''q'' and ''n'' defined by the formula:

:&lt;math&gt;c_q(n)= \sum_{a=1\atop (a,q)=1}^q e^{2 \pi i \tfrac{a}{q} n},&lt;/math&gt;

where (''a'', ''q'') = 1 means that ''a'' only takes on values [[coprime]] to ''q''.

[[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] mentioned the sums in a 1918 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanujan, ''On Certain Trigonometric Sums ...'' &lt;blockquote&gt;These sums are obviously of great interest, and a few of their properties have been discussed already. But, so far as I know, they have never been considered from the point of view which I adopt in  this paper; and I believe that all the results which it contains are new.&lt;/blockquote&gt;(''Papers'', p. 179). In a footnote cites pp. 360&amp;ndash;370 of the Dirichlet-Dedekind ''Vorlesungen über Zahlentheorie'', 4th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the expansions discussed in this article, Ramanujan's sums are used in the proof of [[Vinogradov's theorem]] that every sufficiently-large odd number is the sum of three [[Prime number|primes]].&lt;ref&gt;Nathanson, ch. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notation==
For integers ''a'' and ''b'', &lt;math&gt;a\mid b&lt;/math&gt; is read "''a'' divides ''b''" and means that there is an integer ''c'' such that ''b'' = ''ac''. Similarly, &lt;math&gt;a\nmid b&lt;/math&gt; is read "''a'' does not divide ''b''". The summation symbol

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\,\mid\,m}f(d)&lt;/math&gt;

means that ''d'' goes through all the positive divisors of ''m'', e.g.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{d\,\mid\,12}f(d) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4) + f(6) + f(12). &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(a,\,b)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[greatest common divisor]],

&lt;math&gt;\phi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]],

&lt;math&gt;\mu(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Möbius function]], and

&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]].

==Formulas for ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')==

===Trigonometry===
These formulas come from the definition, [[Euler's formula]] &lt;math&gt;e^{ix}= \cos x + i \sin x,&lt;/math&gt; and elementary trigonometric identities.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c_1(n) &amp;= 1 \\
c_2(n) &amp;= \cos n\pi \\
c_3(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac23 n\pi \\
c_4(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac12 n\pi \\
c_5(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac25 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac45 n\pi \\
c_6(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac13 n\pi \\
c_7(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac27 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac47 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac67 n\pi \\
c_8(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac14 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac34 n\pi \\
c_9(n) &amp;= 2\cos \tfrac29 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac49 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac89 n\pi \\
c_{10}(n)&amp;= 2\cos \tfrac15 n\pi + 2\cos \tfrac35 n\pi \\
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

and so on ({{OEIS2C|A000012}}, {{OEIS2C|A033999}}, {{OEIS2C|A099837}}, {{OEIS2C|A176742}},.., {{OEIS2C|A100051}},...) They show that ''c&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''n'') is always real.

===Kluyver===
Let &lt;math&gt;\zeta_q=e^{\frac{2\pi i}{q}}.&lt;/math&gt; Then {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is a root of the equation {{math|''x&lt;sup&gt;q&lt;/sup&gt;'' − 1 {{=}} 0}}. Each of its powers,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_q, \zeta_q^2, \ldots, \zeta_q^{q-1}, \zeta_q^q = \zeta_q^0 =1&lt;/math&gt;

is also a root. Therefore, since there are ''q'' of them, they are all of the roots. The numbers &lt;math&gt;\zeta_q^n&lt;/math&gt; where 1 ≤ ''n'' ≤ ''q'' are called the ''q''-th [[roots of unity]]. {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is called a '''primitive''' ''q''-th root of unity because the smallest value of ''n'' that makes &lt;math&gt;\zeta_q^n =1&lt;/math&gt; is ''q''. The other primitive ''q''-th roots of unity are the numbers &lt;math&gt;\zeta_q^a&lt;/math&gt; where (''a'', ''q'') = 1. Therefore, there are φ(''q'') primitive ''q''-th roots of unity.

Thus, the Ramanujan sum ''c&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(''n'') is the sum of the ''n''-th powers of the primitive ''q''-th roots of unity.

It is a fact&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, Thms 65, 66&lt;/ref&gt; that the powers of {{math|''ζ&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are precisely the primitive roots for all the divisors of ''q''.

'''Example.''' Let ''q'' = 12. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}, \zeta_{12}^5, \zeta_{12}^7,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^{11}&lt;/math&gt; are the primitive twelfth roots of unity,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^{10}&lt;/math&gt; are the primitive sixth roots of unity,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^3 = i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^9 = -i&lt;/math&gt; are the primitive fourth roots of unity,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^8&lt;/math&gt; are the primitive third roots of unity,

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^6 = -1&lt;/math&gt; is the primitive second root of unity, and

:&lt;math&gt;\zeta_{12}^{12} = 1&lt;/math&gt; is the primitive first root of unity.

Therefore, if

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_q(n) = \sum_{k=1}^q \zeta_q^{kn}&lt;/math&gt;

is the sum of the ''n''-th powers of all the roots, primitive and imprimitive,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_q(n) = \sum_{d\mid q} c_d(n),&lt;/math&gt;

and by [[Möbius inversion]],

:&lt;math&gt;c_q(n) = \sum_{d\mid q} \mu\left(\frac{q}d\right)\eta_d(n).&lt;/math&gt;

It follows from the identity ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; − 1 = (''x'' − 1)(''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''−1&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''q''−2&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''x'' + 1) that

:&lt;math&gt;\eta_q(n) = \begin{cases} 0 &amp; q\nmid n\\ q &amp; q\mid n\\ \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

and this leads to the formula

:&lt;math&gt;c_q(n)=\sum_{d\mid (q,n)} \mu\left(\frac{q}{d}\right) d,&lt;/math&gt;

published by Kluyver in 1906.&lt;ref&gt;G. H. Hardy, P. V. Seshu Aiyar, &amp; B. M. Wilson, notes to ''On certain trigonometrical sums ...'', Ramanujan, ''Papers'', p. 343&lt;/ref&gt;

This shows that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is always an integer. Compare it with the formula

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(q)=\sum_{d \mid q}\mu\left(\frac{q}{d}\right) d.&lt;/math&gt;

===von Sterneck===
It is easily shown from the definition that ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is [[multiplicative function|multiplicative]] when considered as a function of ''q'' for a fixed value of ''n'':&lt;ref name=SS16&gt;Schwarz &amp; Spilken (1994) p.16&lt;/ref&gt; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{If } \;(q,r) = 1 \;\mbox{ then }\; c_q(n)c_r(n)=c_{qr}(n).&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition (or Kluyver's formula) it is straightforward to prove that, if ''p'' is a prime number,

:&lt;math&gt;
c_p(n) = 
\begin{cases}
-1     &amp;\mbox{  if }p\nmid n\\
\phi(p)&amp;\mbox{  if }p\mid n\\
\end{cases}
,&lt;/math&gt;

and if ''p''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; is a prime power where ''k'' &gt; 1,

:&lt;math&gt;
c_{p^k}(n) = 
\begin{cases}
0         &amp;\mbox{  if }p^{k-1}\nmid n\\
-p^{k-1}  &amp;\mbox{  if }p^{k-1}\mid n \mbox{ and }p^k\nmid n\\
\phi(p^k) &amp;\mbox{  if }p^k\mid n\\
\end{cases}
.&lt;/math&gt;

This result and the multiplicative property can be used to prove

:&lt;math&gt;c_q(n)= \mu\left(\frac{q}{(q, n)}\right)\frac{\phi(q)}{\phi\left(\frac{q}{(q, n)}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is called von Sterneck's arithmetic function.&lt;ref&gt;B. Berndt, commentary to ''On certain trigonometrical sums...'', Ramanujan, ''Papers'', p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; The equivalence of it and Ramanujan's sum is due to Hölder.&lt;ref&gt;Knopfmacher, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hardy &amp; Wright, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other properties of ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')===
For all positive integers ''q'',

:&lt;math&gt;
c_1(q) = 1, \;\;
c_q(1) = \mu(q), \;
\mbox{  and  }\; c_q(q) =
\phi(q)
.
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mbox{If }
m \equiv n \pmod q
\mbox{ then }
c_q(m) = 
c_q(n)
.
&lt;/math&gt;

For a fixed value of ''q'' the absolute value of the sequence 
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(1), ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(2), ... is bounded by φ(''q''), and

for a fixed value of ''n'' the absolute value of the sequence 
:''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), ... is bounded by ''n''.

If ''q'' &gt; 1

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=a}^{a+q-1} c_q(n)=0. &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; 0, ''m'' = lcm(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Then&lt;ref&gt;Tóth, external links, eq. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Ramanujan's sums satisfy an [[orthogonality|orthogonality property]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{m}\sum_{k=1}^m c_{m_1}(k) c_{m_2}(k) = \begin{cases} \phi(m) &amp; m_1=m_2=m,\\ 0 &amp; \text{otherwise} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Let ''n'', ''k'' &gt; 0. Then&lt;ref&gt;Tóth, external links, eq. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_\stackrel{d\mid n}{\gcd(d,k)=1} d\;\frac{\mu(\tfrac{n}{d})}{\phi(d)} =
\frac{\mu(n) c_n(k)}{\phi(n)},
&lt;/math&gt;
known as the [[Richard Brauer|Brauer]] - [[Hans rademacher|Rademacher]] identity.

If ''n'' &gt; 0 and ''a'' is any integer, we also have&lt;ref&gt;Tóth, external links, eq. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sum_\stackrel{1\le k\le n}{\gcd(k,n)=1} c_n(k-a) =
\mu(n)c_n(a),
&lt;/math&gt;
due to Cohen.

==Ramanujan expansions==
If ''f''(''n'') is an [[arithmetic function]] (i.e. a complex-valued function of the integers or natural numbers), then a  [[series (mathematics)|convergent infinite series]] of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(n)=\sum_{q=1}^\infty a_q c_q(n)&lt;/math&gt;

or of the form:

:&lt;math&gt;f(q)=\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n c_q(n)&lt;/math&gt;

where the {{math|''a&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ '''C'''}}, is called a '''Ramanujan expansion'''&lt;ref&gt;B. Berndt, commentary to ''On certain trigonometrical sums...'', Ramanujan, ''Papers'', pp. 369&amp;ndash;371&lt;/ref&gt; of ''f''(''n'').

Ramanujan found expansions of some of the well-known functions of number theory. All of these results are proved in an "elementary" manner (i.e. only using formal manipulations of series and the simplest results about convergence).&lt;ref&gt;Ramanujan, ''On certain trigonometrical sums...'' &lt;blockquote&gt;The majority of my formulae are "elementary" in the technical sense of the word &amp;mdash; they can (that is to say) be proved by a combination of processes involving only finite algebra and simple general theorems concerning infinite series&lt;/blockquote&gt;(''Papers'', p. 179)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The theory of formal Dirichlet series is discussed in  Hardy &amp; Wright, § 17.6 and in Knopfmacher.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knopfmacher, ch. 7, discusses Ramanujan expansions as a type of Fourier expansion in an inner product space which has the ''c''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt; as an orthogonal basis.&lt;/ref&gt;

The expansion of the '''zero function''' depends on a result from the analytic theory of prime numbers, namely that the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{\mu(n)}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

converges to 0, and the results for ''r''(''n'') and ''r''&amp;prime;(''n'') depend on theorems in an earlier paper.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanujan, ''On Certain Arithmetical Functions''&lt;/ref&gt;

All the formulas in this section are from Ramanujan's 1918 paper. 
 
===Generating functions===
The [[generating function]]s of the Ramanujan sums are [[Dirichlet series]]:

:&lt;math&gt; \zeta(s) \sum_{\delta\,\mid\,q} \mu\left(\frac{q}{\delta}\right) \delta^{1-s} = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{c_q(n)}{n^s} &lt;/math&gt;

is a generating function for the sequence ''c&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(1), ''c&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;''(2), ... where ''q'' is kept constant, and

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sigma_{r-1}(n)}{n^{r-1}\zeta(r)}= \sum_{q=1}^\infty \frac{c_q(n)}{q^{r}} &lt;/math&gt;

is a generating function for the sequence ''c''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), ''c''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), ... where ''n'' is kept constant.

There is also the double Dirichlet series

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\zeta(s) \zeta(r+s-1)}{\zeta(r)}= \sum_{q=1}^\infty \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{c_q(n)}{q^r n^s}.&lt;/math&gt;

===σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')===
σ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the [[divisor function]] (i.e. the sum of the ''k''-th powers of the divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n''). σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), the number of  divisors of ''n'', is usually written ''d''(''n'') and σ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n''), the sum of the divisors of ''n'', is usually written σ(''n'').

If ''s'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_s(n)= n^s \zeta(s+1) \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1^{s+1}}+ \frac{c_2(n)}{2^{s+1}}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{3^{s+1}}+\dots\right)&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{-s}(n)=\zeta(s+1)\left(\frac{c_1(n)}{1^{s+1}}+\frac{c_2(n)}{2^{s+1}}+\frac{c_3(n)}{3^{s+1}}+\dots\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Setting ''s'' = 1 gives

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n)= \frac{\pi^2}{6}n \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1}+ \frac{c_2(n)}{4}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{9}+ \dots \right).&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Riemann hypothesis]] is true, and &lt;math&gt;-\tfrac12&lt;s&lt;\tfrac12,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_s(n) = \zeta(1-s) \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1^{1-s}}+ \frac{c_2(n)}{2^{1-s}}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{3^{1-s}}+ \dots \right) = n^s \zeta(1+s) \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1^{1+s}}+ \frac{c_2(n)}{2^{1+s}}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{3^{1+s}}+ \dots \right).&lt;/math&gt;

===''d''(''n'')===
''d''(''n'') = σ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the number of divisors of ''n'', including 1 and ''n'' itself.

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
-d(n) &amp;= \frac{\log 1}{1}c_1(n)+ \frac{\log 2}{2}c_2(n)+ \frac{\log 3}{3}c_3(n)+ \dots \\
-d(n)(2\gamma+\log n) &amp;= \frac{\log^2 1}{1}c_1(n)+ \frac{\log^2 2}{2}c_2(n)+ \frac{\log^2 3}{3}c_3(n)+ \cdots 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where γ = 0.5772... is the [[Euler–Mascheroni constant]].

===''φ''(''n'')===
[[Euler's totient function]] φ(''n'') is the number of positive integers less than ''n'' and coprime to ''n''. Ramanujan defines a generalization of it, if

:&lt;math&gt;n=p_1^{a_1}p_2^{a_2}p_3^{a_3}\cdots&lt;/math&gt;

is the prime factorization of ''n'', and ''s'' is a complex number, let

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi_s(n)=n^s(1-p_1^{-s})(1-p_2^{-s})(1-p_3^{-s})\cdots,&lt;/math&gt;

so that ''φ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = ''φ''(''n'') is Euler's function.&lt;ref&gt;This is [[Jordan's totient function]], J&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'').&lt;/ref&gt;

He proves that

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mu(n)n^s}{\varphi_s(n)\zeta(s)}= \sum_{\nu=1}^\infty \frac{\mu(n\nu)}{\nu^s} &lt;/math&gt;

and uses this to show that

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\varphi_s(n)\zeta(s+1)}{n^s}=\frac{\mu(1)c_1(n)}{\varphi_{s+1}(1)}+\frac{\mu(2)c_2(n)}{\varphi_{s+1}(2)}+\frac{\mu(3)c_3(n)}{\varphi_{s+1}(3)}+\dots.
&lt;/math&gt;

Letting ''s'' = 1,

:&lt;math&gt;\varphi(n) = \frac{6}{\pi^2}n \left(c_1(n) -\frac{c_2(n)}{2^2-1} -\frac{c_3(n)}{3^2-1} -\frac{c_5(n)}{5^2-1}+\frac{c_6(n)}{(2^2-1)(3^2-1)} - \frac{c_7(n)}{7^2-1} +\frac{c_{10}(n)}{(2^2-1)(5^2-1)} -\dots \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Note that the constant is the inverse&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Hardy &amp; Wright, Thm. 329, which states that &lt;math&gt;\;\frac{6}{\pi^2}&lt;\frac{\sigma(n)\phi(n)}{n^2}&lt;1.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; of the one in the formula for σ(''n'').

===Λ(''n'')===
[[von Mangoldt function|Von Mangoldt's function]] {{math|Λ(''n'') {{=}} 0}} unless ''n'' = ''p&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' is a power of a prime number, in which case it is the natural logarithm log ''p''.

:&lt;math&gt; -\Lambda(m) = c_m(1)+ \frac{1}{2} c_m(2)+ \frac13c_m(3)+\dots&lt;/math&gt;

===Zero===
For all ''n'' &gt; 0,

:&lt;math&gt;0= c_1(n)+ \frac12c_2(n)+ \frac13c_3(n)+ \dots.&lt;/math&gt;

This is equivalent to the [[prime number theorem]].&lt;ref&gt;Hardy, ''Ramanujan'', p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B. Berndt, commentary to ''On certain trigonometrical sums...'', Ramanujan, ''Papers'', p. 371&lt;/ref&gt;

===''r''&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') (sums of squares)===
''r''&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is the number of way of representing ''n'' as the sum of  2''s'' [[Square number|squares]], counting different orders and signs as different (e.g., ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(13) = 8, as 13 = (±2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (±3)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = (±3)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + (±2)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.)

Ramanujan defines a function δ&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') and references a paper&lt;ref&gt;Ramanujan, ''On Certain Arithmetical Functions''&lt;/ref&gt; in which he proved that ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = δ&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') for ''s'' = 1, 2, 3, and 4. For ''s'' &gt; 4 he shows that δ&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is a good approximation to ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'').

''s'' = 1 has a special formula:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_2(n)= \pi \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1}- \frac{c_3(n)}{3}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{5}- \dots \right). &lt;/math&gt;

In the following formulas the signs repeat with a period of 4.

If ''s'' ≡ 0 (mod 4),

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{2s}(n)= \frac{\pi^s n^{s-1}}{(s-1)!} \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1^s}+ \frac{c_4(n)}{2^s}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{3^s}+\frac{c_8(n)}{4^s}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{5^s}+ \frac{c_{12}(n)}{6^s}+ \frac{c_7(n)}{7^s}+ \frac{c_{16}(n)}{8^s}+ \dots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' ≡ 2 (mod 4),

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{2s}(n)= \frac{\pi^s n^{s-1}}{(s-1)!} \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1^s}- \frac{c_4(n)}{2^s}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{3^s}- \frac{c_8(n)}{4^s}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{5^s}- \frac{c_{12}(n)}{6^s}+ \frac{c_7(n)}{7^s}- \frac{c_{16}(n)}{8^s}+ \dots \right)&lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' ≡ 1 (mod 4) and ''s'' &gt; 1,
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{2s}(n)=
\frac{\pi^s n^{s-1}}{(s-1)!}
\left(
\frac{c_1(n)}{1^s}+
\frac{c_4(n)}{2^s}-
\frac{c_3(n)}{3^s}+ 
\frac{c_8(n)}{4^s}+
\frac{c_5(n)}{5^s}+
\frac{c_{12}(n)}{6^s}-
\frac{c_7(n)}{7^s}+
\frac{c_{16}(n)}{8^s}+
\dots
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' ≡ 3 (mod 4),
:&lt;math&gt;
\delta_{2s}(n)=
\frac{\pi^s n^{s-1}}{(s-1)!}
\left(
\frac{c_1(n)}{1^s}-
\frac{c_4(n)}{2^s}-
\frac{c_3(n)}{3^s}- 
\frac{c_8(n)}{4^s}+
\frac{c_5(n)}{5^s}-
\frac{c_{12}(n)}{6^s}-
\frac{c_7(n)}{7^s}-
\frac{c_{16}(n)}{8^s}+
\dots
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

and therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
r_2(n) &amp;= \pi \left(\frac{c_1(n)}{1}- \frac{c_3(n)}{3}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{5}- \frac{c_7(n)}{7}+ \frac{c_{11}(n)}{11}- \frac{c_{13}(n)}{13}+ \frac{c_{15}(n)}{15} - \frac{c_{17}(n)}{17} + \cdots \right) \\
r_4(n) &amp;= \pi^2 n \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1}- \frac{c_4(n)}{4}+ \frac{c_3(n)}{9}- \frac{c_8(n)}{16}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{25}- \frac{c_{12}(n)}{36}+ \frac{c_7(n)}{49}- \frac{c_{16}(n)}{64}+ \cdots \right) \\
r_6(n) &amp;= \frac{\pi^3 n^2}{2} \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1}- \frac{c_4(n)}{8}- \frac{c_3(n)}{27}- \frac{c_8(n)}{64}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{125}- \frac{c_{12}(n)}{216}- \frac{c_7(n)}{343} - \frac{c_{16}(n)}{512}+ \cdots \right) \\
r_8(n) &amp;= \frac{\pi^4 n^3}{6} \left( \frac{c_1(n)}{1}+ \frac{c_4(n)}{16}+  \frac{c_3(n)}{81}+  \frac{c_8(n)}{256}+ \frac{c_5(n)}{625}+ \frac{c_{12}(n)}{1296}+ \frac{c_7(n)}{2401}+ \frac{c_{16}(n)}{4096}+ \cdots \right)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===''r''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') (sums of triangles)===
''r''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  is the number of ways ''n'' can be represented as the sum of 2''s'' [[triangular number]]s (i.e. the numbers 1, 3 = 1 + 2, 6 = 1 + 2 + 3, 10 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4, 15, ...; the ''n''-th triangular number is given by the formula ''n''(''n'' + 1)/2.)

The analysis  here is similar to that for squares. Ramanujan refers to the same paper as he did for the squares, where he showed that there is a function δ&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') such that ''r''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') = δ&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'')  for ''s'' = 1, 2, 3, and 4, and that for ''s'' &gt; 4, δ&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'') is a good approximation to ''r''&amp;prime;&lt;sub&gt;2''s''&lt;/sub&gt;(''n'').

Again, ''s'' = 1 requires a special formula:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta'_2(n)= \frac{\pi}{4} \left( \frac{c_1(4n+1)}{1}- \frac{c_3(4n+1)}{3}+ \frac{c_5(4n+1)}{5}- \frac{c_7(4n+1)}{7}+ \dots \right). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' is a multiple of 4,

:&lt;math&gt; \delta'_{2s}(n)= \frac{(\frac{\pi}{2})^s}{(s-1)!}\left(n+\frac{s}4\right)^{s-1} \left( \frac{c_1(n+\frac{s}4)}{1^s}+ \frac{c_3(n+\frac{s}4)}{3^s}+
\frac{c_5(n+\frac{s}4)}{5^s}+ \dots \right). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' is twice an odd number,

:&lt;math&gt; \delta'_{2s}(n)= \frac{(\frac{\pi}{2})^s}{(s-1)!}\left(n+\frac{s}4\right)^{s-1} \left( \frac{c_1(2n+\frac{s}2)}{1^s}+ \frac{c_3(2n+\frac{s}2)}{3^s}+ \frac{c_5(2n+\frac{s}2)}{5^s}+ \dots \right). &lt;/math&gt;

If ''s'' is an odd number and ''s'' &gt; 1,

r'_8(n) &amp;= \frac{(\frac12\pi)^4}{6}(n+1)^3 \left( \frac{c_1(n+1)}{1}+ \frac{c_3(n+1)}{81}+ \frac{c_5(n+1)}{625}+ \dots \right)

In [[finance]], the '''rule of 72''', the '''rule of 70'''&lt;ref name=Meadows/&gt; and the '''rule of 69.3''' are methods for estimating an [[investment]]'s doubling time. The rule number (e.g., 72) is divided by the interest percentage per period (usually years) to obtain the approximate number of periods required for doubling.  Although [[scientific calculator]]s and [[spreadsheet]] programs have functions to find the accurate doubling time, the rules are useful for [[mental calculation]]s and when only a basic [[calculator]] is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=All the Math You'll Ever Need|author=Slavin, Steve|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1989|isbn=0-471-50636-2|pages=153–154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These rules apply to [[exponential growth]] and are therefore used for [[compound interest]] as opposed to [[simple interest]] calculations. They can also be used for [[exponential decay|decay]] to obtain a halving time. The choice of number is mostly a matter of preference: 69 is more accurate for continuous compounding, while 72 works well in common interest situations and is more easily divisible.
There are a number of variations to the rules that improve accuracy. For periodic compounding, the ''exact'' doubling time for an interest rate of ''r'' percent per period is
:&lt;math&gt;t = \frac{\ln(2)}{\ln(1+r/100)}\approx \frac{72}{r}&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''t'' is the number of periods required. The formula above can be used for more than calculating the doubling time. If one wants to know the tripling time, for example, simply replace the constant 2 in the numerator with 3. As another example, if one wants to know the number of periods it takes for the initial value to rise by 50%, replace the constant 2 with 1.5.

== Using the rule to estimate compounding periods ==

To estimate the number of periods required to double an original investment, divide the most convenient "rule-quantity" by the expected growth rate, expressed as a percentage.
*For instance, if you were to invest $100 with compounding interest at a rate of 9% per annum, the rule of 72 gives 72/9 = 8 years required for the investment to be worth $200; an exact calculation gives [[Natural logarithm of 2|ln(2)]]/ln(1+0.09) = 8.0432 years.

Similarly, to determine the time it takes for the value of money to halve at a given rate, divide the rule quantity by that rate.

*To determine the time for [[money]]'s [[Purchasing power|buying power]] to halve, financiers simply divide the rule-quantity by the [[inflation rate]]. Thus at 3.5% [[inflation]] using the '''rule of 70''', it should take approximately 70/3.5 = 20 years for the value of a unit of currency to halve&lt;ref name=Meadows&gt;[[Donella Meadows]], ''Thinking in Systems: A Primer'', [[Chelsea Green Publishing]], 2008, page 33 (box "Hint on reinforcing feedback loops and doubling time").&lt;/ref&gt;.
*To estimate the impact of additional fees on financial policies (e.g., [[mutual fund fees and expenses]], loading and expense charges on [[variable universal life insurance]] investment portfolios), divide 72 by the fee.  For example, if the Universal Life policy charges an annual 3% fee over and above the cost of the underlying investment fund, then the total account value will be cut to 1/2 in 72 / 3 = 24 years, and then to just 1/4 the value in 48 years, compared to holding exactly the same investment outside the policy.

== Choice of rule ==
The value 72 is a convenient choice of numerator, since it has many small [[divisor]]s: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 12. It provides a good approximation for annual compounding, and for compounding at typical rates (from 6% to 10%).  The approximations are less accurate at higher interest rates.

For continuous compounding, 69 gives accurate results for any rate. This is because [[natural logarithm|ln]](2) is about 69.3%; see derivation below. Since daily compounding is close enough to continuous compounding, for most purposes 69, 69.3 or 70 are better than 72 for daily compounding. For lower annual rates than those above, 69.3 would also be more accurate than 72.&lt;ref&gt;Kalid Azad [http://betterexplained.com/articles/demystifying-the-natural-logarithm-ln/ Demystifying the Natural Logarithm (ln)] from BetterExplained&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
An early reference to the rule is in the ''[[Summa de arithmetica]]'' (Venice, 1494. Fol. 181, n. 44) of [[Luca Pacioli]] (1445–1514). He presents the rule in a discussion regarding the estimation of the doubling time of an investment, but does not derive or explain the rule, and it is thus assumed that the rule predates Pacioli by some time.
{{cquote|'' A voler sapere ogni quantità a tanto per 100 l'anno, in quanti anni sarà tornata doppia tra utile e capitale, '''tieni per regola 72''', a mente, il quale sempre partirai per l'interesse, e quello che ne viene, in tanti anni sarà raddoppiato. Esempio: Quando l'interesse è a 6 per 100 l'anno, dico che si parta 72 per 6; ne vien 12, e in 12 anni sarà raddoppiato il capitale.'' (emphasis added).}}
Roughly translated:
{{cquote|In wanting to know of any capital, at a given yearly percentage, in how many years it will double adding the interest to the capital, '''keep as a rule [the number] 72''' in mind, which you will always divide by the interest, and what results, in that many years it will be doubled.  Example: When the interest is 6 percent per year, I say that one divides 72 by 6; 12 results, and in 12 years the capital will be doubled.}}

==Adjustments for higher accuracy==
For higher rates, a bigger [[numerator]] would be better (e.g., for 20%, using 76 to get 3.8 years would be only about 0.002 off, where using 72 to get 3.6 would be about 0.2 off).  This is because, as above, the rule of 72 is only an approximation that is accurate for interest rates from 6% to 10%. For every three percentage points away from 8% the value 72 could be adjusted by 1.

:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{72 + (r - 8)/3}{r} &lt;/math&gt;

or for the same result, but simpler:

:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{70 + (r - 2)/3}{r} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{69.3}{r} + 0.33&lt;/math&gt;

===E-M rule===
The Eckart–McHale second-order rule (the E-M rule) provides a multiplicative correction for the rule of 69.3 that is very accurate for rates from 0% to 20%. The rule of 69.3 is normally only accurate at the lowest end of interest rates, from 0% to about 5%. To compute the E-M approximation, simply multiply the rule of 69.3 result by 200/(200−''r'') as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{69.3}{r} \times \frac{200}{200-r}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if the interest rate is 18%, the rule of 69.3 says ''t'' = 3.85 years.  The E-M rule multiplies this by 200/(200−18), giving a doubling time of 4.23 years, where the actual doubling time at this rate is 4.19 years. (The E-M rule thus gives a closer approximation than the rule of 72.)

Note that the numerator here is simply 69.3 times 200. As long as the product stays constant, the factors can be modified arbitrarily.  The E-M rule could thus be written also as

:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{70}{r} \times \frac{198}{200-r}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{72}{r} \times \frac{192}{200-r}&lt;/math&gt;

in order to keep the product mostly unchanged.  In these variants, the multiplicative correction becomes 1 respectively for r=2 and r=8, the values for which the rule of 70 (respectively 72) is most precise.

Similarly, the third-order [[Padé approximant]] gives a more accurate answer over an even larger range of ''r'', but it has a slightly more complicated formula:

:&lt;math&gt; t \approx \frac{69.3}{r} \times \frac{600+4r}{600+r}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Derivation==

===Periodic compounding ===
For [[Compound interest#Periodic compounding|periodic compounding]], [[future value]] is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;FV = PV \cdot (1+r)^t&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; is the [[present value]], &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the number of time periods, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; stands for the interest rate per time period.

The future value is double the present value when the following condition is met:
:&lt;math&gt;(1+r)^t = 2\,&lt;/math&gt;
This equation is easily solved for &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{array}{ccc}
            \ln((1+r)^t) &amp; = &amp; \ln 2                  \\
    t\ln(1+r)   &amp; = &amp; \ln 2                  \\
    t                  &amp; = &amp; \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(1+r)}
  \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;


A simple rearrangement shows:

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\ln{2}}{\ln{(1+r)}}=\bigg(\frac{\ln2}{r}\bigg)\bigg(\frac{r}{ln(1+r)}\bigg)
&lt;/math&gt;


If ''r'' is small, then ln(1 + ''r'') [[Natural logarithm#Derivative.2C Taylor series|approximately equals ''r'']] (this is the first term in the [[Taylor series#Calculation of Taylor series|Taylor series]]). That is, the latter term grows slowly when &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is close to zero. 

Calling this latter term &lt;math&gt;f(r)&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;f(r)&lt;/math&gt; is shown to be accurate in the approximation of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; for a small, positive interest rate when &lt;math&gt;r=.08&lt;/math&gt; (see derivation below). &lt;math&gt;f(.08)\approx1.03949&lt;/math&gt;, and we therefore approximate time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; as:
:&lt;math&gt;
t=\bigg(\frac{\ln2}{r}\bigg)f(.08) \approx \frac{.72}{r}
&lt;/math&gt;

Written as a percentage:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{.72}{r}=\frac{72}{100r}
&lt;/math&gt;



This approximation increases in accuracy as the [[Compound Interest|compounding of interest]] becomes continuous (see derivation below).  &lt;math&gt;100 r&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; written as a [[percentage]].

In order to derive the more precise adjustments presented above, it is noted that &lt;math&gt;\ln(1+r)\,&lt;/math&gt; is more closely approximated by &lt;math&gt;r - \frac{r^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; (using the second term in the [[Taylor series]]).  &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.693}{r - r^2/2}&lt;/math&gt; can then be further simplified by Taylor approximations:

:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{array}{ccc}
    \frac{0.693}{r - r^2/2} &amp; = &amp; \frac{69.3}{R - R^2/200} \\  &amp; &amp; \\
      &amp;    =    &amp; \frac{69.3}{R}    \frac{1}{1-R/200}      \\  &amp; &amp; \\
      &amp; \approx &amp; \frac{69.3 (1+R/200)}{R}                 \\  &amp; &amp; \\
      &amp;    =    &amp; \frac{69.3}{R}+\frac{69.3}{200}          \\  &amp; &amp; \\
      &amp;    =    &amp; \frac{69.3}{R}+0.34\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

Replacing the "R" in ''R/200'' on the third line with 7.79 gives 72 on the numerator.  This shows that the rule of 72 is most precise for periodically composed interests around 8%.

Alternatively, the E-M rule is obtained if the second-order Taylor approximation is used directly.

=== Continuous compounding ===
For [[Compound interest#Continuous compounding|continuous compounding]], the derivation is simpler and yields a more accurate rule:
:&lt;math&gt;
  \begin{array}{ccc}
        (e^r)^p &amp;    =    &amp;           2        \\
        e^{rp}  &amp;    =    &amp;           2        \\
    \ln e^{rp}  &amp;    =    &amp;       \ln 2        \\
           rp   &amp;    =    &amp;       \ln 2        \\
            p   &amp;    =    &amp; \frac{\ln 2}{r}    \\
                &amp;         &amp;                    \\
            p   &amp; \approx &amp; \frac{0.693147}{r}
  \end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1691">In [[mathematics]], the '''Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick''' theorem is an extension of the [[Schwarz lemma]] for [[hyperbolic geometry]], such as the [[Poincaré half-plane model]].

The [[Schwarz lemma#Schwarz.E2.80.93Pick theorem|Schwarz–Pick lemma]] states that every [[holomorphic function]] from the [[unit disk]] ''U'' to itself, or from the [[upper half-plane]] ''H'' to itself, will not increase the Poincaré distance between points. The unit disk ''U'' with the Poincaré metric has negative [[Gaussian curvature]] −1. In 1938, [[Lars Ahlfors]] generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces:

'''Theorem''' ([[Hermann Schwarz|Schwarz]]–[[Lars Ahlfors|Ahlfors]]–[[Georg Alexander Pick|Pick]]). Let ''U'' be the unit disk with Poincaré metric &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;; let ''S'' be a [[Riemann surface]] endowed with a [[Hermitian metric]] &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; whose [[Gaussian curvature]] is&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1; let &lt;math&gt;f:U\rightarrow S&lt;/math&gt; be a [[holomorphic function]]. Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(f(z_1),f(z_2)) \leq \rho(z_1,z_2)&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;z_1,z_2 \in U.&lt;/math&gt;

A generalization of this theorem was proved by [[Shing-Tung Yau]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=From Schwarz to Pick to Ahlfors and Beyond|first=Robert|last=Osserman|authorlink=Robert Osserman|journal=Notices of the AMS|date=September 1999|url=http://www.ams.org/notices/199908/fea-osserman.pdf|volume=46|issue=8|pages=868–873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1862">In mathematics, a '''set function''' is a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] whose input is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]].  The output is usually a number.  Often the input is a set of [[real number]]s, a set of points in [[Euclidean space]], or a set of points in some [[measure space]].

Examples of set functions include:
* The function that assigns to each set its [[cardinality]], i.e. the number of members of the set, is a set function.
* The function

: assigning [[Schnirelmann density|densities]] to sufficiently [[well-behaved]] subsets ''A''&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;{1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;3,&amp;nbsp;...}, is a set function.
* The [[Lebesgue measure]] is a set function that assigns a non-negative real number to any set of real numbers, that is in Lebesgue &lt;math&gt; \sigma &lt;/math&gt;-algebra. (Kolmogorov and Fomin 1975)
* A [[probability measure]] assigns a probability to each set in a [[sigma-algebra|σ-algebra]]. Specifically, the probability of the [[empty set]] is zero and the probability of the [[sample space]] is 1, with other sets given probabilities between 0 and&amp;nbsp;1.
* A possibility measure assigns a number between zero and one to each set in the [[powerset]] of some given set. See [[possibility theory]].
* A Random set is a set-valued [[random variable]]. See [[Random compact set]].

In [[physics]], a '''spin network''' is a type of diagram which can be used to represent [[Quantum state|states]] and interactions between [[Particle physics|particles]] and [[Quantum field theory|fields]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. From a [[mathematical]] perspective, the diagrams are a concise way to represent [[multilinear function]]s and functions between [[representation theory|representations]] of [[matrix group]]s. The diagrammatic notation often simplifies calculation because simple diagrams may be used to represent complicated [[Function (mathematics)|functions]]. 

[[Roger Penrose]] is credited with the invention of spin networks in 1971,&lt;ref name=Penrose71/&gt; although similar diagrammatic techniques existed before his time. Spin networks have been applied to the theory of [[Quantum gravity|quantum gravity]] by [[Carlo Rovelli]], [[Lee Smolin]], [[Jorge Pullin]], [[Rodolfo Gambini]] and others. 

Spin networks can also be used to construct a particular [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[connection (mathematics)|connections]] which is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Definition ==

=== Penrose's original definition ===
A spin network, as described in Penrose (1971),&lt;ref name=Penrose71&gt;R. Penrose (1971a), "Angular momentum: an approach to combinatorial spacetime," in T. Bastin (ed.), ''Quantum Theory and Beyond'', Cambridge University Press (this paper can be found online on [[John C. Baez]]'s [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/penrose/ website]); and R. Penrose (1971b), "Applications of negative dimensional tensors," in D. J. A. Welsh (ed.), ''Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications'' ([[Proceedings|Proc.]] [[Academic conference|Conf.]], Oxford, 1969), Academic Press, pp. 221–244, esp. p. 241 (the latter paper was presented in 1969 but published in 1971 according to Roger Penrose, [http://users.ox.ac.uk/~tweb/00001/#05 "On the Origins of Twistor Theory"] in: ''Gravitation and Geometry, a Volume in Honour of [[Ivor Robinson (physicist)|I. Robinson]]'', Biblipolis, Naples 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; is a kind of diagram in which each line segment represents the [[world line]] of a "unit" (either an [[elementary particle]] or a compound system of particles). Three line segments join at each vertex. A vertex may be interpreted as an event in which either a single unit splits into two or two units collide and join into a single unit. Diagrams whose line segments are all joined at vertices are called ''closed spin networks''. Time may be viewed as going in one direction, such as from the bottom to the top of the diagram, but for closed spin networks the direction of time is irrelevant to calculations.

Each line segment is labelled with an integer called a [[spin number]]. A unit with spin number ''n'' is called an ''n''-unit and has [[angular momentum]] ''nħ/2'', where ''ħ'' is the reduced [[Planck constant]]. For [[boson]]s, such as [[photon]]s and [[gluon]]s, ''n'' is an even number. For [[fermion]]s, such as [[electron]]s and [[quark]]s, ''n'' is odd.

Given any closed spin network, a non-negative integer can be calculated which is called the ''norm'' of the spin network. Norms can be used to calculate the [[probabilities]] of various spin values. A network whose norm is zero has zero probability of occurrence. The rules for calculating norms and probabilities are beyond the scope of this article. However, they imply that for a spin network to have nonzero norm, two requirements must be met at each vertex. Suppose a vertex joins three units with spin numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. Then, these requirements are stated as:
* [[Triangle inequality]]: ''a'' must be less than or equal to ''b'' + ''c'', ''b'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''c'', and ''c'' less than or equal to ''a'' + ''b''.
* Fermion conservation: ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be an even number.
For example, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 6 is impossible since 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 is odd, and ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 9 is impossible since 9 &gt; 3 + 4. However, ''a'' = 3, ''b'' = 4, ''c'' = 5 is possible since 3 + 4 + 5 = 12 is even, and the triangle inequality is satisfied. 
Some conventions use labellings by half-integers, with the condition that the sum ''a'' + ''b'' + ''c'' must be a whole number.

=== Formal definition ===
More formally, a spin network is a (directed) [[graph theory|graph]] whose [[graph theory|edges]] are associated with [[Irreducible representation|irreducible]] [[Representations of Lie groups/algebras|representations]] of a [[Compact group|compact]] [[Lie group]] and whose [[vertex (graph theory)|vertices]] are associated with [[intertwiner#Representation_theory|intertwiner]]s of the edge representations adjacent to it.

A spin network, immersed into a manifold, can be used to define a [[functional (mathematics)|functional]] on the space of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]] on this manifold. One computes [[holonomy|holonomies]] of the connection along every link (closed path) of the graph, determines representation matrices corresponding to every link, multiplies all matrices and intertwiners together, and contracts indices in a prescribed way. A remarkable feature of the resulting functional is that it is invariant under local [[gauge transformation]]s.

== Usage in physics ==

=== In the context of loop quantum gravity ===
In [[loop quantum gravity]] (LQG), a spin network represents a "quantum state" of the [[gravitational field]] on a 3-dimensional [[hypersurface]]. The set of all possible spin networks (or, more accurately, "[[s-knot]]s" - that is, equivalence classes of spin networks under [[diffeomorphisms]]) is [[countable]]&lt;!-- inaccurate - diffeomorphism class? --&gt;; it constitutes a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of LQG [[Hilbert space]].

One of the key results of loop quantum gravity is [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of areas: the operator of the area ''A'' of a two-dimensional surface Σ should have a discrete [[Spectrum of a matrix|spectrum]]. Every '''spin network''' is an [[eigenstate]] of each such operator, and the area eigenvalue equals

:&lt;math&gt;A_{\Sigma} = 8\pi \ell_\text{PL}^2\gamma
\sum_i  \sqrt{j_i(j_i+1)}&lt;/math&gt;

where the sum goes over all intersections ''i'' of Σ with the spin network. In this formula,
*{{ell}}&lt;sub&gt;PL&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Planck length]],
*&lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Immirzi parameter]] and
*''j&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0, 1/2, 1, 3/2, ... is the [[spin (physics)|spin]] associated with the link ''i'' of the spin network.  The two-dimensional area is therefore "concentrated" in the intersections with the spin network.

According to this formula, the lowest possible non-zero eigenvalue of the area operator corresponds to a link that carries spin 1/2 representation. Assuming an [[Immirzi parameter]] on the order of 1, this gives the smallest possible measurable area of ~10&lt;sup&gt;−66&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

The formula for area eigenvalues becomes somewhat more complicated if the surface is allowed to pass through the vertices, as with anomalous diffusion models.  Also, the eigenvalues of the area operator ''A'' are constrained by [[ladder symmetry]].

Similar quantization applies to the volume operator. The volume of 3D submanifold that contains part of spin network is given by a sum of contributions from each node inside it. One can think that every node in a spin network is an elementary "quantum of volume" and every link is a "quantum of area" surrounding this volume.

=== More general gauge theories ===
Similar constructions can be made for general gauge theories with a compact Lie group G and a [[connection form]]. This is actually an exact [[duality (mathematics)|duality]] over a lattice. Over a [[manifold]] however, assumptions like [[diffeomorphism invariance]] are needed to make the duality exact (smearing [[Wilson loop]]s is tricky). Later, it was generalized by [[Robert Oeckl]] to representations of [[quantum group]]s in 2 and 3 dimensions using the [[Tannaka–Krein duality]].

[[Michael A. Levin]] and [[Xiao-Gang Wen]] have also defined [[string-net]]s using [[tensor category|tensor categories]] that are objects very similar to spin networks. However the exact connection with spin networks is not clear yet. [[String-net condensation]] produces [[topological order|topologically ordered]] states in condensed matter.

== Usage in mathematics ==
In mathematics, spin networks have been used to study [[skein module]]s and [[character variety|character varieties]], which correspond to spaces of [[Connection (mathematics)|connections]].

The '''''Sumario Compendioso''''' was the first mathematics book published in the [[New World]]. The book was published in [[Mexico City]] in 1556 by a clergyman [[Juan Diez]].

==Availability==

The book has been digitized and is available on the [[Internet]].

Before the [[Digital Age]] the only four known surviving copies were preserved at the [[Huntington Library]], San Marino, CA, the [[British Library]], London, [[Duke University]] Library, and the [[University of Salamanca]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://curvebank.calstatela.edu/birthdayindex/jun/jun6sumario/jun6sumario.htm calstatela.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Tatiana Ehrenfest cropped.jpg|thumb|Tatyana Afanasyeva]]

'''Tatyana Alexeyevna Afanasyeva''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Татья́на Алексе́евна Афана́сьева}}) ([[Kiev]], 19 November 1876 – [[Leiden]], 14 April 1964) (also known as '''Tatiana Ehrenfest-Afanaseva''' or spelled '''Afanassjewa''') was a Russian/Dutch mathematician and physicist who made contributions to the fields of [[statistical mechanics]] and statistical thermodynamics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epigenesys.eu/de/science-and-you/women-in-science/749-tatyana-ehrenfest-afanassyeva|title=Tatyana Ehrenfest-Afanassyeva|last=|first=|date=|website=www.epigenesys.eu|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 21 December 1904, she married Austrian [[physicist]] [[Paul Ehrenfest]] (1880–1933). They had two daughters and two sons; one daughter, [[Tatyana Pavlovna Ehrenfest]], also became a mathematician.

== Early life ==
Afanasyeva was born in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], then part of the [[Russian Empire]].  Her father was Alexander Afanassjev, a chief engineer on the Imperial Railways, who would bring Tatyana on his travels around the Russian Empire.  Her father died while she was still young, so she moved to [[St Petersburg]] in Russia to live with her aunt Sonya, and uncle Peter Afanassjev, a professor at the [[Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University|St Petersburg Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa.html|title=Ehrenfest-Afanassjewa biography|website=www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk|access-date=2017-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tatyana attended [[normal school]] in St Petersburg with a specialty in mathematics and science.  At the time, women were not allowed to attend universities in Russian territory, so after graduating from normal school, Tatyana began studying mathematics and physics at the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Women's University in St Petersburg]] under [[Orest Khvolson|Orest Chvolson]].  In 1902, she transferred to [[Georg August University of Göttingen|University of Göttingen]] in Germany to continue her studies with [[Felix Klein]] and [[David Hilbert]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

At the University of Gottingen, Tatyana met Paul Ehrenfest.  When Ehrenfest discovered that Tatyana could not attend a mathematics club meeting, he argued with the school to have the rule changed.  A friendship developed between the two, and they married in 1904, later returned to [[St Petersburg]] in 1907.  Under Russian law, marriage was not allowed between two people of different religions. Since Tatyana was a Russian Orthodox and Ehrenfest was Jewish, they both decided to officially renounce their religions in order to remain married.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1912 they moved to [[Leiden]] in the Netherlands, where Paul Ehrenfest was appointed to succeed [[Hendrik Lorentz|H.A. Lorentz]] as professor at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]],{{ref|succeed}} and where the couple lived throughout their career.

Tatyana collaborated closely with her husband, most famously on their classic review of the [[statistical mechanics]] of [[Ludwig Boltzmann|Boltzmann]].{{ref|review}}  ''The Conceptual Foundations of the Statistical Approach in Mechanics,'' by Paul and Tatyana Ehrenfest was originally published in 1911 as an article for the German ''Encyclopedia of Mathematical Sciences'', and has since been translated and republished.

She published many papers on various topics such as [[randomness]]{{ref|probability}} and [[entropy]],{{ref|book}} and [[Mathematics education|teaching]] [[geometry]] to children.{{ref|exercises}}{{ref|moor}}

In [[mathematics]], '''tightness''' is a concept in [[measure theory]]. The intuitive idea is that a given collection of measures does not "escape to [[infinity]]."&lt;!-- and beyond!--&gt;

==Definitions==

Let &lt;math&gt;(X, T)&lt;/math&gt; be a [[topological space]], and let &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; be a [[sigma algebra|&amp;sigma;-algebra]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; that contains the topology &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. (Thus, every [[open set|open subset]] of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[measurable set]] and &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is at least as fine as the [[Borel sigma algebra|Borel &amp;sigma;-algebra]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.) Let &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; be a collection of (possibly [[signed measure|signed]] or [[complex measure|complex]]) measures defined on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt;. The collection &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is called '''tight''' (or sometimes '''uniformly tight''') if, for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a [[compact space|compact subset]] &lt;math&gt;K_{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that, for all measures &lt;math&gt;\mu \in M&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;|\mu| (X \setminus K_{\varepsilon}) &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;|\mu|&lt;/math&gt; is the [[total variation measure]] of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;.  Very often, the measures in question are [[probability measure]]s, so the last part can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (K_{\varepsilon}) &gt; 1 - \varepsilon. \,&lt;/math&gt;

If a tight collection &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; consists of a single measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;, then (depending upon the author) &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; may either be said to be a '''tight measure''' or to be an '''[[inner regular measure]]'''.

If &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is an &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;-valued [[random variable]] whose [[probability distribution]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a tight measure then &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a '''separable random variable''' or a '''Radon random variable'''.

==Examples==

===Compact spaces===

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metrisable]] [[compact space]], then every collection of (possibly complex) measures on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is tight. This is not necessarily so for non-metrisable compact spaces. If we take &lt;math&gt;[0,\omega_1]&lt;/math&gt; with its [[order topology]], then there exists a measure &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; on it that is not inner regular. Therefore, the singleton &lt;math&gt;\{\mu\}&lt;/math&gt; is not tight.

===Polish spaces===

If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a compact [[Polish space]], then every probability measure on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is tight. Furthermore, by [[Prokhorov's theorem]], a collection of probability measures on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is tight if and only if
it is [[Relatively compact subspace|precompact]] in the topology of [[Convergence of measures|weak convergence]].

===A collection of point masses===

Consider the [[real line]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; with its usual Borel topology. Let &lt;math&gt;\delta_{x}&lt;/math&gt; denote the [[Dirac measure]], a unit mass at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. The collection

:&lt;math&gt;M_{1} := \{ \delta_{n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;

is not tight, since the compact subsets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the [[Closed set|closed]] and [[Bounded set|bounded]] subsets, and any such set, since it is bounded, has &lt;math&gt;\delta_{n}&lt;/math&gt;-measure zero for large enough &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, the collection

:&lt;math&gt;M_{2} := \{ \delta_{1 / n} | n \in \mathbb{N} \}&lt;/math&gt;

is tight: the compact interval &lt;math&gt;[0, 1]&lt;/math&gt; will work as &lt;math&gt;K_{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;. In general, a collection of Dirac delta measures on &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; is tight if, and only if, the collection of their [[support (measure theory)|supports]] is bounded.

===A collection of Gaussian measures===

Consider &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; with its usual Borel topology and σ-algebra. Consider a collection of [[Gaussian measure]]s

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \{ \gamma_{i} | i \in I \},&lt;/math&gt;

where the measure &lt;math&gt;\gamma_{i}&lt;/math&gt; has [[expected value]] ([[mean]]) &lt;math&gt;m_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and [[covariance matrix]] &lt;math&gt;C_{i} \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt;. Then the collection &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is tight if, and only if, the collections &lt;math&gt;\{ m_{i} | i \in I \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{ C_{i} | i \in I \} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^{n \times n}&lt;/math&gt; are both bounded.

==Tightness and convergence==

Tightness is often a necessary criterion for proving the [[weak convergence of measures|weak convergence]] of a sequence of probability measures, especially when the measure space has [[Infinity|infinite]] [[dimension]]. See

* [[Finite-dimensional distribution]]
* [[Prokhorov's theorem]]
* [[Lévy–Prokhorov metric]]
* [[Weak convergence of measures]]
* [[Classical Wiener space#Tightness in classical Wiener space|Tightness in classical Wiener space]]
* [[Càdlàg#Tightness in Skorokhod space|Tightness in Skorokhod space]]

==Exponential tightness==

A strengthening of tightness is the concept of exponential tightness, which has applications in [[large deviations theory]]. A family of [[probability measure]]s &lt;math&gt;(\mu_{\delta})_{\delta &gt; 0}&lt;/math&gt; on a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] topological space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''exponentially tight''' if, for any &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a compact subset &lt;math&gt;K_{\varepsilon}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;\limsup_{\delta \downarrow 0} \delta \log \mu_{\delta} (X \setminus K_{\varepsilon}) &lt; - \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

'''Time Cube''' was a [[personal web page]], founded in 1997 by the [[self-proclaimed]] "wisest man on earth", the late Otis Eugene "Gene" Ray.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; It was a [[self-publishing | self-published]] outlet for Ray's [[theory of everything]], called "Time Cube", which claims that all modern sciences are participating in a [[conspiracy theory|worldwide conspiracy]] to teach lies, by omitting his theory's alleged [[truth]] that each day actually consists of four days.&lt;ref name="PCMag"/&gt; Alongside these statements, Ray described himself as a "godlike being with superior intelligence who has absolute evidence and proof" for his views. Ray asserted repeatedly and variously that "[[academia]]" had not taken Time Cube seriously.&lt;ref name=Swarthmore/&gt;

Otis Eugene Ray died at the age of 87, on March 18, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=178435720|title=Otis Eugene Ray (1927 - 2015) - Find A Grave Memorial}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray's website domain names expired in August 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Robertson |first=Adi |date=September 2, 2015 |title=Time Cube Is Gone |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/2/9247913/time-cube-is-gone |dead-url=no |work=The Verge |publisher=Vox Media |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150912045309/http://www.theverge.com:80/2015/9/2/9247913/time-cube-is-gone |archive-date=September 12, 2015 |access-date=February 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Time Cube was last archived by the [[Wayback Machine]] on January 12, 2016.

Retrieved July 8, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==

===Style===
The Time Cube website had no [[home page]] or separate sections.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; It consisted of a single web page that contained a vertical column of centered [[body text]] of various sizes&lt;!-- 36 to 48 points, according to Firefox Web Developer --&gt; and colors.&lt;ref name="PCMag"/&gt;

Ray used cryptic language that included insults and ''[[Non sequitur (logic)|non-sequitur]]'' lines such as "Belly-Button Logic© Works. When Does Teenager Die? Adults Eat Teenagers Alive, No Record Of Their Death." The narrative weaved in and out of his metaphysical ideas with numerous unique digressions.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; In one paragraph he claimed that because his own wisdom "so antiquates known knowledge", a [[psychiatrist]] examining his behavior diagnosed him with [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20080709075217/http://www.timecube.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;, "My wisdom so antiquates known knowledge, that a psychiatrist examining my behavior, eccentric by his academic single corner knowledge, knows no course other than to judge me schizoprenic."&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have claimed it is futile to analyze the text rationally, locate meaningful proofs in the text, or verify any evidence.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="techtv"/&gt;

===Time Cube concept===
[[File:Time Cube.png|thumb|Diagram illustrating an aspect of the Time Cube theory which Ray describes as "LIFE ENCOMPASSES A 4-16 CUBE PRINCIPLE"]]
Ray's [[Mental model|personal model of reality]], called "Time Cube", states that all of modern physics and education is wrong,&lt;ref name="PCMag"/&gt; and argues that, among many other things, [[Greenwich Mean Time|Greenwich Time]] is a global [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy]]. He utilizes various graphs (along with pictures of himself) that purport to show how each day is really four separate days—[[Sunrise|sunup]], [[Noon|midday]], [[Sunset|sundown]], and [[midnight]] (formerly morning, early afternoon, late afternoon, and evening)—occurring simultaneously.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Swarthmore&gt;{{cite news |last=Duffy |first=Kate |date=September 19, 2002 |title=Truth Is Cubic? |url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-09-19/living/12178.php |newspaper=The Phoenix |location=Swarthmore, Pennsylvania |publisher=Swarthmore College |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220092124/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-09-19/living/12178.php |archive-date=December 20, 2002 |access-date=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following quotation from the website illustrates the recurring theme:
{{quote|When the Sun shines upon Earth, 2 – major Time points are created on opposite sides of Earth – known as Midday and Midnight. Where the 2 major Time forces join, synergy creates 2 new minor Time points we recognize as Sunup and Sundown. The 4-[[equidistant]] Time points can be considered as Time Square imprinted upon the circle of Earth. In a single rotation of the Earth sphere, each Time corner point rotates through the other 3-corner Time points, thus creating 16 corners, 96 hours and 4-[[simultaneous]] 24-hour Days within a single rotation of Earth – equated to a Higher Order of Life Time Cube.}}

Ray offered $1,000&lt;ref name="Time Cube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timecube.com/timecubeflierimg.gif |title=Timecube.com Picture |accessdate=September 14, 2014 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818113418/http://www.timecube.com/timecubeflierimg.gif |archivedate=August 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or $10,000&lt;ref name=Swarthmore/&gt; to anyone who could prove his views wrong. Mike Hartwell of ''[[The Maine Campus]]'' wrote that any attempt to claim the prize would require convincing Ray that his theory was invalid. The proof would need to be framed in terms of his own model, thus deviating from any form of modern science. "Even if you could pull that off", Harwell said, "Ray is probably broke".&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

==Reception==
Ray spoke about Time Cube at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in January 2002 as part of a student-organized extra-curricular event during the independent activities period.&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/iap/www/iap02/searchiap/iap-4330.html |title=IAP 2002 Activity: Time Cube Lecture / Debate |accessdate=April 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He repeated his $10,000 offer for professors to disprove his notions at the event; none attempted it.&lt;ref name=Swarthmore/&gt; [[John C. Dvorak]] wrote in ''[[PC Magazine]]'' that "Metasites that track crackpot sites often say this is the number one nutty site."&lt;ref name="PCMag"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dvorak |first=John C. |author-link=John C. Dvorak |date=December 22, 2003 |title=Don't Call Them Crackpots |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1420072,00.asp |website=PC Magazine |access-date=August 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also characterized the site's content as "endless blather".&lt;ref name="PCMag"/&gt; Asked by [[Martin Sargent]] in 2003 how it felt to be an [[Internet celebrity]], Ray stated that it was not a position he wanted, but something he felt he had to do as "no writer or speaker understands the Time Cube".&lt;ref name="techtv"&gt;{{cite episode |date=June 18, 2003 |series=[[Unscrewed with Martin Sargent]] |season=1 |number=15 |network=TechTV |quote=''Sargent:'' Gene, how do you feel about being an Internet celebrity? I mean, you're huge on the web. ''Ray:'' Well, it's not a position I wanted, it's something I had to do. I'm not a writer or speaker, but no writer or speaker understands the Time Cube.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray also spoke about Time Cube at the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in April 2005, in a speech in which he attacked the instruction offered by academics.&lt;ref name=Technique&gt;[https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/1853/7877/3/focus-2005-04-22.pdf "Oddball Time Cube theorist piques interest, elicits mixed response"], by Joshua Cuneo, ''[[The Technique]]''. [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]. April 22, 2005. Retrieved July 25, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 editorial in ''The Maine Campus'' student newspaper remarked upon what it called the site's "subtle little racist ideologies" which culminate in Ray describing [[racial integration]] as "destroying all of the races".&lt;ref name="MC"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mainecampus.com/2004/09/24/timecubecom-where-reality-as-we-know-it-is-a-lie |title=Timecube.com: Where reality as we know it is a lie |last=Hartwell |first=Mark |date=September 24, 2004 |newspaper=The Maine Campus |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430225718/http://mainecampus.com/2004/09/24/timecubecom-where-reality-as-we-know-it-is-a-lie/ |archive-date=April 30, 2011 |access-date=July 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Brett Hanover made ''Above God'' (also the name of one of Ray's websites which criticized the idea that God exists),&lt;ref&gt;abovegod.com&lt;/ref&gt; a short documentary film about Ray and Time Cube,&lt;ref name=Hanover&gt;[http://www.bretthanover.com/video.html ''Above God''], Brett Hanover official site.

Richard Janczarski, also known online as "Cubehead", was a self-professed disciple of Ray who styled himself the 
"second-wisest human".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL93505B8EF06578EB|title=Dr Gene Ray Time Cube Experience|publisher=Richard Janczarski}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004, Janczarski created the Time Cube fansite Cubic Awareness Online, and an accompanying forum. In 2007, he travelled from his native [[Australia]] to [[Florida]] to meet Ray. The pair had several disagreements after going their separate ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Janczarski |first=Richard |interviewer=Charles Berman |title=The Bronze Age of Radio |url=https://yadi.sk/d/t8cdVYIpjMEPn |publisher=[[WHRW]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ray denounced Janczarski on his website after the latter’s visit. Janczarski took his own life on February 12, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fredrik Knudsen|title=Time Cube {{!}} Down the Rabbit Hole|date=2017-11-30|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7lWCqbgQnU&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=2353|accessdate=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/RICHARD-JANCZARSKI/5511847#given_names=RICHARD&amp;family_names=JANCZARSKI|title=Grave Site of Richard Janczarski (1986–2008)|publisher=BillionGraves}}&lt;/ref&gt;
