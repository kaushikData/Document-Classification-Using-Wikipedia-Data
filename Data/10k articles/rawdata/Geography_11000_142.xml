The '''Central Highlands''', '''Central High Plateau''', or '''Hauts-Plateaux''' are a mountainous [[biogeography|biogeographical]] region in central [[Madagascar]]. They include the contiguous part of the island's interior above 800&amp;nbsp;m (2600&amp;nbsp;ft) altitude.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;871&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Highlands are separated from the [[Northern Highlands]] of the northern tip of Madagascar by a low-lying valley, the [[Mandritsara Window]], which has apparently acted as a barrier to [[biological dispersal|dispersal]] for species in the highlands, leading to [[species pair]]s such as ''[[Voalavo gymnocaudus]]'' and ''[[Voalavo antsahabensis]]'' in the Northern and Central Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;872&lt;/ref&gt; Species restricted to the Central Highlands include the bats ''[[Miniopterus manavi]]''&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;5&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Miniopterus sororculus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;1216&lt;/ref&gt; the rodents ''[[Brachyuromys betsileoensis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Musser and Carleton, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;949&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Voalavo antsahabensis'';&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;867&lt;/ref&gt; the tenrecs ''[[Hemicentetes nigriceps]]''&lt;ref&gt;Bronner and Jenkins, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;76&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Oryzorictes tetradactylus]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, pp.&amp;nbsp;44–45&lt;/ref&gt; and the lemur ''[[Cheirogaleus sibreei]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Garbutt, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;104&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the continuous habitat of the Central Highlands, there is little local [[endemism]], unlike the Northern Highlands.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman et al., 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;395&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Hong Kong}}
The '''Districts of Hong Kong''' are the 18 political areas by which [[Hong Kong]] is geographically divided.  Each district has a [[District council of Hong Kong|district council]], formerly district boards, for which the districts were established in 1982,&lt;ref name=SCMPsonny&gt;[http://www.scmp.com/comment/insight-opinion/article/1356830/time-revamp-hong-kongs-neglected-district-councils Time to revamp Hong Kong's neglected district councils], SCMP, Sonny Lo, 18 Nov 2013&lt;/ref&gt; when Hong Kong was under [[Colonial Hong Kong|British rule]]. However, the districts have limited relevance to the population, as few public services operate according to district boundaries. The [[Hong Kong police#Structure|police]], [[List of fire stations in Hong Kong|fire services]], health services and [[List of hospitals in Hong Kong|hospital authority]], and postal service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hongkongpost.hk/eng/locations/delivery/index.htm Hongkong Post: Delivery Office Information] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140311235705/http://www.hongkongpost.hk/eng/locations/delivery/index.htm |date=11 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; each define their own idiosyncratic geographic divisions.  However major departments, such as the [[Education Bureau]], do provide information based on district.

==History==
In the 1860s, residents speaking the same dialects were often grouped together, and social structure was more important than district structure.  Merchants often travelled together as [[guild]]s and sold common goods across different areas.  Organizations such as [[Nam Pak Hong]], [[Tung Wah Hospital|Tung Wah Hospital Committee]] and "District Watch Committee" often cut across any native district lines.  The concept of boundary separation only became important around 1870, when cultural conflicts increased between [[coolies]], Chinese and the British.&lt;ref&gt;Tsai Jung-fang. [1995] (1995). Hong Kong in Chinese History: community and social unrest in the British Colony, 1842–1913. Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-07933-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first legal attempt to control districts came in 1888 under the ''"European District Reservation Ordinance"'', which reserved areas exclusively to Europeans.  The first ''"Town Planning Ordinance"'' did not appear until 1939.&lt;ref&gt;Fong, Ki.  Lai Lawrence Wai-chung.  [2000] (2000) Hong Kong University Press.  Town Planning Practice: Context Procedures and Statistics for Hong Kong.  {{ISBN|962-209-516-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Philippa.  [2003] (2003) Prostitution, Race and Politics: Policing Venereal Disease in the British Empire.  United Kingdom: Routledge Publishing.  {{ISBN|0-415-94446-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The District Administration Scheme was implemented in 1982 with the establishment of a [[District Council of Hong Kong|district board]] and a district management committee in each of the districts in Hong Kong. The aim of the scheme is to achieve a more effective co-ordination of government activities in the provision of services and facilities at the district level, ensure that the [[Hong Kong Government|Government]] is responsive to district needs and problems and promote public participation in district affairs. From 1 July 1997 to 31 December 1999, the former district boards were replaced by provisional district boards. The provisional district boards were in turn replaced on 1 January 2000, with 18 district councils.

There have been two major changes on district divisions since their implementation in 1982:
# [[Kwai Tsing District]] was split off from [[Tsuen Wan District]] in 1985.
# [[Yau Tsim District]] and [[Mong Kok District]] merged to become [[Yau Tsim Mong District]] in 1994.

==Population==
[[File:Density of Hong Kong by Districts.svg|thumb|right|The map depicting population density of Hong Kong by district.]]
The population density per district varies from 783 (Islands) to 52,123 (Kwun Tong) per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Before the combination of [[Mong Kok District|Mong Kok]] and [[Yau Tsim District|Yau Tsim]] districts in 1995, Mong Kok District had the highest density (~120,000 /km²). The following figures come from the 2006 Population By-census. Note that the median monthly per capita income is deduced from the median monthly domestic household income, the average domestic household size and the labour force.

It promotes the concept of effective building management and works closely with other government departments to consistently improve the standard of building management in Hong Kong. It monitors the provision of new arrival services and identifies measures to meet the needs of new arrivals. It also disseminates information relating to and, where necessary, promotes the public's understanding of major government policies, strategies and development plans; and collects and assesses public opinion on relevant issues affecting the community. These responsibilities are discharged primarily through the 18 district offices covering the whole of Hong Kong.

==District officers==
As head of each district office, the district officer is the representative of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government at the district level. He has the responsibility of overseeing directly the operation of the District Administration Scheme in the district. He is charged with implementing and co-ordinating the execution of district programmes, ensuring that the advice of the district council is properly followed up, and promoting residents' participation in district affairs. In addition, he is required to maintain close liaison with different sectors of the community and reflect their concerns and problems to the Government. It is his duty to ensure that district problems are resolved promptly through inter-departmental consultation and co-operation. Also, he acts as a link between the district council and departments and serves as a mediator between them when problems arise. The district officer is also involved with the community at every level. He has a role to mediate in the resolution of disputes between corporate bodies and residents. He performs an advisory and liaison role in providing assistance to building management bodies. He operates a public enquiry service to enable the community to have easy access to services and information provided by government. In emergency situations, the district officer is responsible for co-ordinating various departments' efforts on the ground for ensuring the effective provision of relief services.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.had.gov.hk/en/public_services/district_administration/dis_officers.htm Home Affairs Department - District Officer function , Retrieved 2018-05-29]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The role of district councils==
{{main|District Council of Hong Kong}}
District councils play an essential advisory role on district matters and issues affecting the whole of Hong Kong as appropriate. The functions of a district council are:
* To advise the Government on:
** matters affecting the well-being of the people in the district;
** the provision and use of public facilities and services within the district;
** the adequacy and priorities of government programmes for the district; and
** the use of public funds allocated to the district for local public works and community activities;
* Where funds are made available for the purpose, to undertake:
** environmental improvements within the district;
** the promotion of recreational and cultural activities within the district; and
**community activities within the district.

The district councils also advise on the management of community centres, which should be in the best interest of the local residents. The district councils initiate, organise and sponsor community involvement projects and activities aimed at enhancing community spirit and social cohesion and promoting the well-being of people in the districts. These range from large-scale district festivals to the formation of local youth choirs and dance troupes. They have also achieved notable success in improving the local environment by undertaking minor environmental improvement projects such as the provision of rest gardens, rain shelters and amenity planting.

In the 2003/04 financial year, $205.6 million has been allocated for the district councils.

==Consultation with district councils==
Departments send representatives to district council meetings, to consult them and, where appropriate, act on their advice and keep them informed of government policies and programmes in general and, more specifically, of the work of departments in the district and local matters that are likely to affect the livelihood, living environment or well-being of the residents within a district.

==Composition of district councils==
The second-term district councils, comprising 529 members (400 elected, 102 appointed by the chief executive and 27 ex-officio who are chairmen of the rural committees in the New Territories), commenced on 1 January 2004.

==District management committees==
The district management committee in each district is chaired by the district officer. It is a government committee consisting of representatives of the core departments in the district, and provides a forum for departments to discuss and resolve district problems. It responds positively to the advice and requests of the district council and submits a comprehensive written report on its work to each meeting of the district council. To enhance communication between the district management committee and the district council, the district council chairman, vice-chairman and chairmen of district council committees are invited to join district management committee as members.

The '''ecological urbanism''' project draws from ecology to inspire an urbanism that is more socially inclusive and sensitive to the environment, as well as less ideologically driven, than [[green urbanism]] or [[Sustainable Urbanism|sustainable urbanism]]. In many ways, ecological urbanism is an evolution of, and a critique of, [[Landscape urbanism|Landscape Urbanism]] arguing for a more holistic approach to the design and management of cities. The term appeared first in 1998 as "EcoUrbanism" in a book by Architect and Planner Miguel Ruano,&lt;ref&gt;Eco-Urbanism: Sustainable Human Settlements, 60 Case Studies – Gustavo Gili, 1998 - 192 pages | http://www.abebooks.com/9788425217234/Eco-Urbanism-Sustainable-Human-Settlements-Case-8425217237/plp&lt;/ref&gt; who defined it as "the development of multi-dimensional sustainable human communities within harmonious and balanced built environments". The term was used later in April 2003 at a conference at the University of Oregon,&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.uoregon.edu/hopes/oldhopes/conf03/emailposter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 2006 in a paper by Jeffrey Hou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HOJPAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=ecological+urbanism#search_anchor |title=Proceedings of the ... ACSA Annual ... – Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture – Google Books |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase was used by [[Mohsen Mostafavi]] in 2007 in ''Intervention Architecture''&lt;ref name="Intervention architecture"/&gt; and in a lecture at the [[Canadian Centre for Architecture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cca.qc.ca/en/education-events/247-sustainable |title=Sustainable? &amp;#124; Canadian Centre for Architecture |publisher=CCA |date=17 June 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ecological urbanism as a project was largely started at [[Harvard University Graduate School of Design]], with a conference, and exhibition, and book.&lt;ref name="Ecological Urbanism Harvard"/&gt;

Arguing for a "new ethics and aesthetics of the urban," the 656-page ''Ecological Urbanism'' book, edited by Mohsen Mostafavi with Gareth Doherty, was published in May 2010 by Lars Müller Publishers ({{ISBN|978-3-03778-189-0}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/en/catalogue-architecture |title=Architecture – Lars Müller Publishers |publisher=Lars-mueller-publishers.com |date=14 July 1938 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book follows the conference,&lt;ref name="conference"/&gt; and exhibition, held at the GSD in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2009/04/12/exhibit_provides_sense_of_the_future/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Robert | last=Campbell | title=Exhibit provides sense of the future | date=12 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu/exhibition.php |title=Exhibition on Ecological Urbanism – Harvard Graduate School of Design |publisher=Ecologicalurbanism.gsd.harvard.edu |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708031955/http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/events/exhibitions/Ecological%20Urbanism/eco_urban_final.htm |date=8 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book has a long list of contributors, including [[Rem Koolhaas]], [[Homi K. Bhabha]], [[Mitchell Joachim]], [[Andrea Branzi]], and about 130 others. A blog during the conference is part of the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com/ |title=GSD:ecologicalurbanism |publisher=Gsd-ecologicalurbanism.blogspot.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [http://www.architecturetoday.co.uk/ ''Architecture Today''], the book is "one of the few books that recognises and articulates how, if this systems-based approach is to be successful, it needs to design, integrate and express complex systems and social processes in ways that are fundamentally humane."&lt;ref name="AT Review"/&gt; The book has been reviewed and cited in many publications, including [''Metropolis Magazine''],&lt;ref name="Metropolis review"/&gt; [http://www.info-jola.de/ ''The Journal of Landscape Architecture''],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jola-lab.eu/www/issues.html |title=JoLA &amp;#124; Issue 11 &amp;#124; Spring 2011 |publisher=Jola-lab.eu |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [http://www.citiesthemagazine.com/ Cities magazine].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cities |url=http://vimeo.com/16500456 |title=Ecological Urbanism – Book Review On Vimeo |publisher=Vimeo.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Events and discussions on the book have been held at the 2010 Venice Biennale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abitare.it/biennale-to-the-people/anticipate/ |title=Anticipate? &amp;#124; Abitare |publisher=Abitare.it |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Storefront for Art and Architecture]] in New York, and at the Van Alen Institute in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |title=Van Alen Institute – Events – Ecological Urbanism and Green Gone Wrong: An Exchange |publisher=Vanalen.org |accessdate=10 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129110856/http://www.vanalen.org/projects/events/EcologicalExchange |archivedate=29 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his introduction to the ''Ecological Urbanism'', "Why Ecological Urbanism? Why Now?", extracted in [https://www.topos.de/ ''Topos: The International Review of Landscape Architecture and Urban Design''], Mostafavi asks: "Increased numbers of people and cities go hand in hand with a greater exploitation of the world’s limited resources. Every year, more cities are feeling the devastating impacts of this situation. What are we to do? What means do we have as designers to address this challenging reality?&lt;ref&gt;https://www.topos.de/Previous-issue/detail-991.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeb Brugmann in his book ''Welcome to the Urban Revolution: How Cities Are Changing the World'' (Bloomsbury Press, 2009) says we need to become "masters of a stable, just, and ecological urbanism." For Brugmann, "The first step towards ecological urbanism is increasing the energy and nutrient productivity within the city, but the only way to move sufficiently from extractive mode to a sustainable productive mode is to think, design, and develop at the scale of the City."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policyinnovations.org/ideas/innovations/data/000176 |title=Welcome to the Urban Revolution |publisher=Policyinnovations.org |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a number of recent conferences and lectures on the project of ecological urbanism, including: The New Aesthetics and Ecological Urbanism at Peking University in October 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alicerawsthorn.com/talks_debates.php |title=Alice Rawsthorn |publisher=Alice Rawsthorn |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Zealand Institute of Landscape Architects Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism: A Prospectus for the Super City, in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinz.org.nz/Events/2010/October/46049 |title=Events – NZILA Spring Lecture Series: Ecological Urbanism – a prospectus for the super city |publisher=DINZ |date=1 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Washington’s urban initiative included a seminar on Now Urbanism&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21Oct10 |url=http://sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com/2010/10/21/ecological-urbanism-gradseminar/ |title=Ecological Urbanism [gradseminar&amp;#93; « Now Urbanism |publisher=Sawyerseminaratuw.wordpress.com |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and talks "on Ecological Urbanism, Ecological Design for Healthy Cities, Networked Urbanism, and America’s War on Immigrants.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roth |first=Rick |url=http://depts.washington.edu/geog/2010/10/city-making-in-the-21st-century-and-beyond/ |title=City Making In The 21st century and Beyond &amp;#124; Department of Geography |publisher=Depts.washington.edu |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eco-Urbanism: towards sustainable city living, was hosted by Nottingham University at the Shanghai Expo in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/.../eco-urbanismprogramme.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to courses at the GSD in 2008&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/courses/details.cgi?section_id=10874&amp;term=f2008&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gsd.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/courses/details.cgi?section_id=12383&amp;term=s2011&lt;/ref&gt; there have been courses on ecological urbanism at the Bergen School of Architecture,&lt;ref name="BAS Course"/&gt; Oslo School of Architecture and Design,&lt;ref name="Univ Oslo Course"/&gt; and Yale University.&lt;ref name="YSOA Course"/&gt; It is on numerous course syllabi, including Advanced Design Theories 2010 at Florida International University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~readg/Courses/GradTheory/GradTheorySyllabus2010.htm ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona State University expanded on the subject with a lecture by Charles Anderson, ASLA.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Morris Anderson]]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson stated that "ecology is concerned with the relationships between all organisms and the environment. Together and coupled with aesthetic and expressionist design principles, they form the foundation for urban design."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://design.asu.edu/events/lectures_archive.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of ecological urbanism==
Ecological urbanism has been criticized as an idea that is loosely defined from a set of flashy projects. These are expensive schemes with a commercial and esthetic purpose that satisfy a local or regional ambition to invest in ecology or sustainability without posing a more globally applicable approach. A true merger of landscape architecture with the field of Urban Ecology lacks. From this criticism Frederick Steiner introduced landscape ecological urbanism as an approach that can include the field of urban ecology and Wybe Kuitert has shown how such integrative planning and management of the city should rely on analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Steiner | first1 = F. R. | year = 2011 | title = Landscape Ecological Urbanism: Origins and Trajectories | url = | journal = Landscape and Urban Planning | volume = 100 | issue = | pages = 333–337 | doi=10.1016/j.landurbplan.2011.01.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 = Wybe | year = 2013 | title = Urban landscape systems understood by geo-history map overlay | doi = 10.1080/18626033.2013.798929 | journal = Journal of Landscape Architecture | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 54–63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Discerning the potential quality of wild nature in the city is a first step to see how new urban ecology might be developed. Potential vegetation maps for a city are the tool to this end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kuitert | first1 =  | year = 2013 | title = The Nature of Urban Seoul: Potential Vegetation Derived from the Soil Map | doi = 10.1080/12265934.2013.766505 | journal = International Journal of Urban Sciences | volume = 17 | issue = 1| pages = 95–108 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ecological Urbanism is explained as a successor to Landscape Urbanism without the difference between the two approaches, and the terms used in the new approach, being defined. Jason King sees it as an inadequately explained addition to a list of 61 other 'Fill-in-the-blank Urbanisms'.&lt;ref&gt;http://landscapeandurbanism.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/ecological-urbanism-introduction-part-2.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Turner]] welcomes landscape and ecological urbanism as 'the most significant contributions to landscape design theory since the landscape architecture profession was launched in the mid-nineteenth century' but is 'unpersuaded by the change of name' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gardenvisit.com/blog/2014/01/02/landscape-ecological-urbanism/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8878">'''Environmental informatics''' is the science of information applied to [[environmental science]]. As such, it provides the [[information processing]] and communication infrastructure to the interdisciplinary field of environmental sciences&lt;ref&gt;L.M. Hilty, B. Page, F.J. Radermacher and W.-F. Riekert. Environmental Informatics as a new discipline of applied computer science. N.M. Avouris and B. Page (eds.), Environmental Informatics (1995), pp. 1-11. Kluwer Academic Publishers. The Netherlands. {{ISBN|0-7923-3445-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; aiming at data, information and [[knowledge integration]], the application of [[computational intelligence]] to [[environmental data]] as well as the identification of [[Environmental degradation|environmental impacts]] of [[information technology]]. The UK [[Natural Environment Research Council]] defines environmental informatics as the "research and system development focusing on the environmental sciences relating to the creation, collection, storage, processing, modelling, interpretation, display and dissemination of data and information."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nerc.ac.uk/funding/application/topics.asp&lt;/ref&gt; Kostas Karatzas defined environmental informatics as the "creation of a new 'knowledge-paradigm' towards serving environmental management needs."&lt;ref&gt;K. Karatzas. Environmental Informatics: Concepts and Definitions. In: A. Gnauck and R. Heinrich (eds.), Proceedings of "The Information Society and Enlargement of the European Union"-17th International Conference Informatics for Environmental Protection, Part 1: Concepts and Methods. Metropolis publishers, pp. 146-151, {{ISBN|3-89518-440-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Karatzas argued further that environmental informatics "is an integrator of [[science]], methods and techniques and not just the result of using [[information]] and software technology methods and tools for serving [[environmental engineering]] needs."

Environmental informatics emerged in early 1990 in [[Central Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;B. Page, V. Wohlgemuth. Advances in Environmental Informatics: Integration of Discrete Event Simulation Methodology with ecological Material Flow Analysis for Modelling eco-efficient Systems, Procedia Environmental Sciences, Volume 2, International Conference on Ecological Informatics and Ecosystem Conservation (ISEIS 2010), 2010, Pages 696-705, ISSN 1878-0296, {{doi|10.1016/j.proenv.2010.10.079}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse environmental and ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of fields like environmental informatics and [[ecoinformatics]] to develop the foundations for effectively managing ecological information. Examples of these initiatives are  [[National Science Foundation]] [[Datanet]] projects, [[DataONE]] and Data Conservancy.

The [[Etymology|origin of the name]] of [[Assam]], a state in [[India]] is  unclear&amp;mdash;among the competing theories, two attribute it to the terrain, whereas the others relate it to the [[Ahom people]]. Whatever the source of the English name, ''Assam'' is itself an anglicization.&lt;ref&gt;Das, Bhuban Mohan (1987) "The Peoples of Assam" [https://books.google.com/books?id=wcIOc0YaxGEC&amp;pg=PA23#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p23] "The modern name Assam is an anglicised form of the Assamese name Asom"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scholarly views==
John Peter Wade (1805) called the [[Ahom kingdom]], that commenced on the Konder Chokey, "Kingdom of Assam".&lt;ref name=wade1805&gt;"The Kingdom of Assam, where it is entered from Bengal, commences on the north of the Berhampooter, at the Khonder Chokey, nearly opposite to the picturesque estate of the late Mr Raush at Goalpara; and at the Nagrabaree Hill on the South", Wade, Dr John Peter, (1805) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=WItJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA116 A Geographical Sketch of Assam]" in Asiatic Annual Register, reprinted {{harv|Sharma|1972|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have speculated that the Bodo word "Ha-com" meaning low land was Sanskritised to 'Asama', dating its origin to at least first millennium common era.&lt;ref name="Subir Ghosh 2001, Page 20"&gt;Subir Ghosh, ''Frontier travails: Northeast, the politics of a mess'', 2001, Page 20 the word may have been borrowed from a Boro formation like Ha-Com, meaning low land. If this derivation is correct, the name Asama may go back to a period long before the coming of the Shans/Ahoms. It appears, therefore, reasonable to suggest that the Sanskrit formation, Asama, is based on Ha-com&lt;/ref&gt;. While some believe the name Asama is a Sanskrit originated word which means unparalleled because of its unequal terrain with hills interspersed with valleys&lt;ref&gt;Sujata Miri, ''Communalism in Assam: a civilizational approach'', 1993, Page 31 It is said to be an anglicised version of the Sanskrit word "Asama" meaning "unparalleled" because of its unequal terrain with hills interspersed with valleys."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Banikanta Kakati]] quotes Grierson in [[Linguistic Survey of India]]&lt;ref name="Sarma 1976 1"&gt;{{harv|Sarma|1976|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that "While the Shan invaders called themselves Tai, they came to be referred to as ''Āsām'', ''Āsam'' and sometimes as ''Acam'' by the indigenous people of the country.  The modern Assamese word ''Āhom'' by which the Tai people are known is derived from ''Āsām'' or ''Āsam''.  The epithet applied to the Shan conquerors was subsequently transferred to the country over which they ruled and thus the name Kāmarūpa was replaced by Āsām,  which ultimately took the Sanskritized form ''Asama'', meaning "unequalled, peerless or uneven"&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kakati|1941|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Satyendranath Sarma repeats this derivation while quoting Kakati.&lt;ref&gt;"{{harvcol|sarma|1976|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Masica too endorses this view.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvcol|Masica|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Satyendra Nath Sarma writes "Assamese is the easternmost Indo-Aryan language of India, spoken by nearly eight millions of people inhabiting mostly the Brahmaputra valley of Assam. The word Assamese is an English formation built on the same principle as Simhalese or Canarese etc. It is based on the English word Assam by which the British rulers referred to the tract covered by the Brahmaputra valley and its adjoining areas. But the people call their country Asama and their language Asamiya".''
&lt;ref&gt;Satyendranath Sarma, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early names==
=== Pragjyotisha ===
The land referred to as [[Pragjyotisha]] in the [[Mahabharata]] is now accepted as present-day Assam and [[North Bengal]].  In the ''Bhismaparvan'', the Pragjyotisha king [[Bhagadatta]] is said to have joined the [[Kurukshetra war]] with an army of ''[[kirata]]'' and ''[[cinas]]''.  Since the name [[China]] is derived from the [[Qin Dynasty]] (221 BCE - 206 BCE), the reference cannot be dated to earlier than the third century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;"The late Qing intelectuals were perfectly aware that the various modern terms of "China"
 originated from the sanskrit root ''cina'' and it is widely believed that the Sanskrit derived from the dynastic name of the first unified China, the Qin (Ch'in) dynasty (221-206 B.C.E)." {{harvcol|Liu|2004|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ramayana]], Pragjyotisha is situated on the Varaha mountain and not in present-day Assam; According to Shastri (2002), the author "had no idea at all of its location and was just eager to refer to it as it had already become a celebrated town".&lt;ref&gt;Shastri, Ajay Mitra (2002) "Ancient North-East India (Pragjyotisha)", Aryan Books International, New Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt; {{harv|Shafer|1954}} believes the center of the Pragjyotisha state was in upper Punjab that moved to Assam in the post epic period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Shafer|1954|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kamarupa kings called themselves the ''Maharajadhiraja'' of Pragjyotisha.  One of the kings Vaidyadeva, referred to Pragjyotisha as a ''bhukti'' and Kamarupa as a ''mandala'' (a smaller division, possibly within Pragjyotisha).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sharma|1978|p=286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kamarupa ===
The earliest epigraphic mention of the Assam region comes from the [[Samudragupta]]'s [[Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudra Gupta|Allahabad stone pillar]] from fourth century CE, where it is called ''[[Kamarupa]]''. The pillar lists the frontier kingdoms (''pratyanta nripati'') and lists Kamarupa ([[Western Assam]]) along with [[Davaka]], a region in the central Assam (undivided Nagaon district).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sharma|1978|p=0.15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, during the fourth century, the eastern boundary of the Kamarupa did not extend beyond west Assam. The Kalika Purana and the Yogini Tantra refer to Kamarupa as a kingdom from Karatoya in the west to Dikkaravasini in the east.  Dikkaravasini is identified with present-day Sadiya.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sircar|1971|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The copper-plate inscription from Vaidyadeva calls Kamarupa a ''mandala'' within his own kingdom.  Later epigraphic sources from Assam call the kingdom ''Pragjyotisha-Kamarupa''.  In the early twelfth century, epigraphic sources from the [[Pala dynasty (Kamarupa)|Pala dynasty]] mention Kamarupa as a ''mandala'' of the kingdom they ruled.  The invasion of western Assam by Allauddin Hussein of [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] up to Barnadi river in 1498 is recorded in coins from the early sixteenth century, declaring Hussein as the conqueror of ''Kamru'' (Kamrup) (and not ''Assam'').

==Asam and variations==
Assam, Asam and other variations started appearing in relatively recent times, and their uses cannot be attributed to any period earlier than the sixteenth century,&lt;ref name="Neog 1962 1"&gt;{{harv|Neog|1962|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is associated with the Shan invaders.&lt;ref&gt;"The word Assam was connected with th!' Shan invaders of the Brahmaputra Valley" {{harvcol|Kakati|1941|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names appeared primarily in three different scripts: the Assamese, Persian and the Roman scripts.  The sixteenth century is the period when [[Srimanta Sankardeva]] established his [[Ekasarana Dharma]].  This was accompanied by a profusive production in literature.  At the same time, [[Vishwa Singha]] established the [[Koch kingdom]] in the west and the [[Ahom kingdom]] saw both a rapid expansion in territory and an increasing Hindu and Assamese influence in its court under [[Suhungmung]].  This increased prominence of the Ahom kingdom brought it to the attention of those outside the Brahmaputra valley.

===Local forms===
Locally, Vaishnavite writers and biographers used different forms of the name indiscriminately (e.g. Āsām, Āsam, Asam) to refer to the Ahom community.&lt;ref name="Neog 1962 1"/&gt;  The earliest mention of ''Asama'' is found in the [[Assamese language|Assamese]] [[Bhagavat of Sankardeva]], which was composed in early sixteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;"Sankardeva, in one of his verses, composed in the early sixteenth century, while referring to the castes and communities of the then Assam used the term Axom to mean the Ahom." {{harv|Taher|2001|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The relevant stanza&lt;ref&gt;Srimandbhagavat, skandha 2, H Dattabaruah and Co., Nalbari, pp-38&lt;/ref&gt; is (in [http://www.aczoom.com/itrans/#itransencoding iTrans]):
&lt;poem&gt;
  ''kiraTa kachhaari      khaachi gaaro miri''
          ''yavana ka~Nka govaala |''
  ''asama maluka&lt;ref&gt;"The Ahoms are here referred to as 'Asama'...The term 'Maluk' remains unidentified unless we take it to mean the variety of tribes in the north-eastern part of the country." {{harv|Neog|1980|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;            dhobaa ye turuka''
          ''kubaacha mlechchha chaNDaala ||''
&lt;/poem&gt;
The Ahoms were called ''Asam'' in the eighteenth century ''Darrangraj Vamshavali'' of Suryya Khari Daibajna;&lt;ref name=kakati41_darrang/&gt; variously as ''Āsām'', ''Āsam'', and ''Asam'' in the seventeenth century ''Shankar-carit'' of Daityari Thakur;&lt;ref name=kakati41_carit/&gt; and ''Acam'' in ''Kamrupar Buranji''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|kakati|1941|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a count provided by {{harv|Bhuyan|1930}}, the ''Kamrupar Buranji'' names the country some thirty times, of which ''Āsām''  was used three times, ''Ācam'' was used three times, and ''Ācām'' was used for the rest, though in other Buranjis other spellings are also seen.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bhuyan|1930|pp=a6-a7}}. (The page numbering in this section follows an archaic Assamese numeral.)&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, Bhuyan mentions that though both "{{lang|as|স}}" (''s'') and "{{lang|as|চ}}" (''c'') have been used in the name, it is likely that it was pronounced mostly with {{angle bracket|{{IPA|s}}}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bhuyan|1930|p=a7}}. (The page numbering in this section follows an archaic Assamese numeral.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''asama'' (as well as ''acam'', ''asam'', ''asam'', ''asam'') was used in the form ''asamakshara'' to denote the [[Ahom script]] in Sanskrit-Ahom bilingual copper plate grants of the Ahom kings.&lt;ref&gt;In general these copper plates have inscriptions in Sanskrit on one side and in the [[Ahom language]] on the other. At the end of the Sanskrit side of the plate, there would be a reference to look on the other side for the same text in Ahom script (''asamaksara'').  For example, ''etadartha-vijnapakam-acamaksarena-paraprasthe'' (the same meaning is carried by what is rendered in acamaksarena on the other page); ''etadarthakam-asamksaram-etad-apara-prstha'' (to get this meaning in asamksara, it is there on the other page) {{Harv|Bora|1981|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mughal forms===
As opposed to the local uses, where ''Asam'' and similar formations were used to denote the Ahom community, external sources used variations of ''Asam'' to denote the kingdom ruled by the Ahoms.  The Ain-I-Akbari of the sixteenth century uses the form ''Asham'' (آشام) to denote the Ahom kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;"The dominions of the rajah of Asham [{{lang|ur|آشام}}] join to Kaumvrou:" Ain-i-Akbari.  Note that the 1777 translation of the Ain-i-Akbari uses the [[long s]] in place of "s" in "Asham"&lt;/ref&gt; The official chronicler of [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]] also calls the place "Asam".&lt;ref&gt;The Indian Antiquary, July 1887, pp222-226&lt;/ref&gt;

===European forms===
The earliest Europeans who came in contact with Assam (and who had the opportunity to write the name in the Latin script), were travelers who went to Bengal and adventurers who accompanied military expeditions against the Ahom kingdom; these groups used variations of the name ''Asam'' to denote the kingdom.
In a map of [http://www.indiawijzer.nl/links/assam/map_of_bengale.jpg "Kingdom of Bengale"], drawn by Joh. van Leenen around 1661 and published around 1662, Assam was clearly named and correctly identified.&lt;ref&gt;"Vervarelijke Schipbreuk Van't Oostindisch Jacht Terschilling", January 1944, W. de Haan NV, Utrecht. The [http://www.indiawijzer.nl/links/assam/map_of_bengale.jpg map].&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the first unambiguous references comes from Thomas Bowrey in 1663 about [[Mir Jumla II|Mir Jumla]]'s death: "They lost the best of Nabobs, the Kingdome of Acham, and, by consequence, many large privileges".&lt;ref&gt;Bowrey, Thomas, ''A Geographical Account of Countries around Bay of Bengal'', ed Temple, R. C., Hakluyt Society's Publications&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Bowrey wrote his manuscript in the 17th century, the manuscript itself was published for the first time in the 20th century.  On the other hand, [[Jean-Baptiste Tavernier]]'s ''Travels in India'', published in 1676 uses the spelling "Assem"  for Assam in the French original (''Aſem'' in the English translation, published in 1678).&lt;ref&gt;"Of the Kingdom of Aſem", Book III, Chapter XVII {{harv|Tavernier|1678|pp=187–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the earliest English use of the name was "Aſem", with a [[Long s]].

Colonialists then followed these travelers and adventurers.  Both Grierson and Gait agree that the British used ''Asam'' before finally settling on ''Assam''.&lt;ref&gt;"...in the early dates of British rule, it (Assam) was spelled with only one 's'". {{harv|Gait|1906|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In various documents of the British East India Company relating to the last few Ahom kings, the name of country was mentioned as ''Assam''. The 1826 [[Treaty of Yandabo]], marking the conquest of the [[Ahom kingdom]] at the hands of the British, uses ''Assam'' to denote the area under the erstwhile Ahoms and its protectorates (Darrang Koch, Jaintias, Kacharis and some hill areas in the present Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland).{{fact|date=October 2018}}

After the British took control of the region, the name ''Assam'' was extended to the province that was then much larger than the [[Ahom kingdom]].  It then included, [[Garo Hills]] and [[Lushai Hills]] ([[Mizoram]]). Since that time, the boundaries of Assam have been repeatedly redrawn, though the name ''Assam'' remained.  Today, the political boundary of Assam contains roughly the historical [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom Kingdom]] and its protectorates, the [[Kachari kingdom]], [[Koch Hajo]] and a part of the [[Jaintia Kingdom]].{{fact|date=October 2018}}

==Modern name Assam==
According to {{Harvcoltxt|Grierson|1967}}, the English word ''Assamese'' parallels other [[demonym]]s (''Chinese'', ''Sinhalese'', ''Nepalese'', etc.), building on ''Assam'', an Anglicization of the Bengali word ''Asam'' that itself refers to the Brahmaputra Valley.&lt;ref name="Grierson 1967 393"&gt;{{harv|Grierson|1967|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers (most notably Banikanta Kakati&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kakati|1941|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Kakati|1953|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and S N Sarma&lt;ref&gt;Satyendranath Sarma, ''Assamese literature: Volume 9, Part 2 '', Harrassowitz,1976, p. 43. "It is based on the English word Assam by which the British rulers referred to the tract covered by the Brahmaputra valley and its adjoining areas."&lt;/ref&gt;) have repeated this claim.  {{Harvcoltxt|Gait|1906}} has mentioned that the British used ''Asam'' before finally settling on ''Assam''; though Grierson claims that the form ''Assam'' is English, ''The Assam Tribune'' has reported the finding of a Dutch map drawn around 1661 with a label ''Assam''.&lt;ref&gt;"I got a copy of Frans van der Heiden’s book in Dutch, published in 1944. Several times the name of Assam is mentioned in this publication. I was able to find a copy of the original Dutch publication, published in 1675 in the library of the Maritime Museum, Rotterdam and compared the two publications. The 1944 version has extra preface added by the publisher including a map of Bengale drawn around 1661 where the name of Assam is mentioned." {{harv|Waleh|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories on etymology==
The precise etymology of the name ''Assam'' or ''Asam'' ({{lang|as|অসম}}) is not known, though many explanations have been put forward.  Among the different theories, two attribute the name to the terrain of the region while three attribute it to the Shan invaders of the 13th century.

One of the earliest theories published was provided by Baden-Powell in 1896, when he proposed that the name could possibly derive from the Bodo ''Ha-com'', meaning "low or level country".&lt;ref&gt;"The name 'Assam' (''Āsām'') is most probably traceable to (the ''Boro'') ''Hā-com''=the low and level country;"{{harv|Baden-Powell|1896|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the possibility that the name ''Assam'' (''Asam'') could be derived from ''Aham'' (Ahom).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baden-Powell|1896|pp=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Subsequent writers like  P. C. Choudhury&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Choudhury|1966|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and R N Mosahary&lt;ref&gt;"The root source of the origin of the name Assam is of the Boro formations ''Ha Com'', ''Ha Som'', or ''Ha Sam'', Mushahary (1983) in "Proceedings of the NEIHA, Fourth Session, p64.&lt;/ref&gt; lend credence to this theory. So, if Ha-Com is the source of Sanskrit Asama, then it traces its origin from very early times, long before any Ahom invasion.&lt;ref name="Subir Ghosh 2001, Page 20"/&gt;

===Asama: from Sanskrit===
Two different meanings of the Sanskrit word ''Asama'' have been used to explain the name: one meaning "uneven" (terrain) and the other "unequaled".

{{Harvcoltxt|Gait|1906}} reports that according to some people, the name "Assam" is derived from the Sanskrit ''asama'', meaning "uneven" which describes the terrain of the region in contrast to the flat plains of Samatata,&lt;ref&gt;"According to some, the word is derived from ''Asama'' meaning "uneven", as distinguished from Samatata, or the level plains of East Bengal." {{harv|Gait|1906|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  though he rejects this explanation on the grounds that the word was never used before the advent of the Ahoms and that the Vamshavali of the Darrang kings used it to refer to the Ahom ''community'' and not to the land.&lt;ref name="Gait 1906 241"&gt;{{harv|Gait|1906|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second theory Gait reported is that ''Asama'', meaning "unequal" or "peerless", was a name the local people gave the undefeated Ahoms, according to a tradition that the Ahoms themselves believed in.  Gait rejects this notion as well, noting that the local tribal people would not have given a Sanskrit name to the invaders.&lt;ref name="Gait 1906 241"/&gt;

Though Gait rejects both these explanations, he nevertheless asserts that the name is somehow associated with the Ahoms.&lt;ref name="Gait 1906 241"/&gt; George Grierson,&lt;ref&gt;"This word is popularly, but incorrectly derived from the Assamese word ''aham'' [Grierson uses 'h' for 'x'] which means 'unequaled,' being the same as the Sanskrit ''asama''."{{harv|Grierson|1967|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banikanta Kakati,&lt;ref&gt;"...''Asama'' meaning peerless or unequaled is a latter-day Sanskritisation of some earlier form like ''Acham''." {{harv|Kakati|1953|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dimbeswar Neog,&lt;ref&gt;"... Thus little room is left for the fanciful origin of the name ''Asam'' from Sanskrit to mean 'uneven' ([terrain]) or 'unparalleled' (people)" {{harv|Neog|1962|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; also reject the Sanskrit origin of the name.  Satyendra Nath Sharma accepts Banikanta Kakati's view ''in toto''.&lt;ref name="Sarma 1976 1"/&gt;

Though both explanations have been rejected in the academic literature, the notion that the name ''Assam'' has a Sanskrit origin continues to hold sway in popular perceptions, due mainly to two standard dictionaries of Assamese: ''[[Hemkox]]'' and ''Chandrakanta Abhidhan''.&lt;ref&gt;"While scholars disagree over the precise origins of the name, Assam, there is a consensus that the name, given to the land by the 13th century Shan invaders impressed by the valour of the people they conquered (or, in another reading, given by the conquered to the people who conquered them, being impressed by their generosity in victory), is derived from the Sanskrit word, asama, meaning unequalled, matchless, with the secondary meaning, uneven, undulating, with reference to the terrain of the land. The two standard Assamese dictionaries, Hem Kosha and Chandrakanta Abhidhan, offer broadly the same definitions." {{harv|Prabhakara|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hemkox'' forwards the second theory, associating the name to the meaning "unequaled".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Barua|2006|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-Sham: from the name ''Sham''===
Gait reports that some associated the name with the Shan who are called ''Syam'' by the Assamese, an explanation which he found not convincing.&lt;ref&gt;"It has been suggested that this may be derived from Shan, or as the Assamese say ''Syam''.  This word is however not used by the Assamese when speaking of the Ahoms, but only with reference to people of Siam" {{harv|Gait|1906|p=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  nevertheless Grierson has accepted that the 13th century natives of Assam called the Shan (Sham) invaders by this name.&lt;ref&gt;"The Assamese themselves call the native country Asam, with the vowels in both syllables short. The name is said to be the term given by them to the Shans or "Shams" who commenced invading the country from the east in the 13th century" {{harv|Grierson|1967|p=393}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dimbeswar Neog notes that the Indic prefix ''a''- does not necessarily mean an antonym in Assamese and it could just be a synonym (e.g. ''kumari''/''akumari'', ''bihane''/''abihane''), a feature that is also seen in Sanskrit  (''sur''/''asur''); therefore, ''Asham'' could mean the same as ''Sham'', and the name could be derived as ''Sham'' ({{lang|as|শাম}}) &gt; ''Āshām'' ({{lang|as|আশাম}}) &gt; ''Āsam'' ({{lang|as|আসম}}) &gt; ''Asam'' ({{lang|as|অসম}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Neog|1967|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amalendu Guha, too derives it from ''Sham''; but instead of using an Indo-Aryan rule, derives it from the Bodo form, ''Ha-Sham'', meaning the land of the ''Sham'' people.&lt;ref&gt;"The [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] domain of Upper Assam came to be known to the [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]] and other Bodo people as ''Ha-Sam'' (the land of the Shams or Shans) in their language. From this the terms 'Asam' and 'Ahom' were derived in due course, and the first term came to stand for the expanded Ahom klngdom. Under the impact of the Indo-Aryan heritage of the region, the concept of 'Asam' was further extended to cover the entire area defined as 'Kamarupa' in the Kalika-Purana (c 9th-10th centuries). The Ahom statesmen and chroniclers wishfully looked forward to the [[Karatoya]] as their natural western frontier. They also looked upon themselves as the heirs of that glory that was ancient [[Kamarupa]] by right of conquest, and they long cherished infructuously their unfulfilled hopes of expanding up to that frontier." {{harv|Guha|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Masica too believes that ''Assam'' derives from an earlier attested form of ''asam'', ''acam'' which in turn is from a Burmese corruption of the name ''Shan/Shyam''.&lt;ref&gt;"Ahoms also gave Assam and its language their name (''Ahom'' and the modern ''ɒχɒm'' 'Assam' come from an attested earlier form ''asam'', ''acam'', probably from a Burmese corruption of the word ''Shan/Shyam'', cf. ''Siam'': Kakati 1962; 1-4)." {{harv|Masica|1993|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-cham: from Tai===
{{harv|Kakati|1953}} derives the name from a Tai root, ''cham'' (defeated), with an Indic prefix for negation, ''a-'', so that ''a-cham'' would mean undefeated.&lt;ref&gt;"In Tai the root ''cham'' means "to be defeated". With the privative Assamese affix ''ā'' the whole formation ''Āchām'' would mean undefeated." {{harv|Kakati|1953|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|An approach in human geography which applies the theories, methods and critiques of feminism}}
{{Feminism sidebar |expanded=Feminist critiques}}

'''[[Feminist]] geography''' is an approach in [[human geography]] which applies the theories, methods and critiques of [[feminism]] to the study of the human environment, society and geographical space.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Gillian|authorlink1=Gillian Rose (geographer)|title=Feminism &amp; Geography: The Limits of Geographical Knowledge|date=1993|publisher=[[University of Minnesota Press]]|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=9780816624188|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Feminism_Geography.html?id=ut9_Af4oyGkC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of feminist geography, which uses a multidisciplinary approach, emerged in the 1970s out of the women’s movement's call on the academy to better incorporate women into academia both as producers and subjects&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Feminist geography is a process of situating geographical research on an [[Intersectionality|intersectional]] foundation thereby examining axes beyond gender to incorporate positions of race, class, ability, sexuality, etc. Through this practice, feminist geography prioritizes [[Praxis (process)|praxis]] within the field as established in feminist epistemology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The discipline has been subject to several controversies.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://areomagazine.com/2018/10/02/academic-grievance-studies-and-the-corruption-of-scholarship/|title=Academic Grievance Studies and the Corruption of Scholarship - Areo|date=2018-10-03|work=Areo|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/jul/13/feminist-geographers-dont-cite-research-white-men/|title=Feminist geographers encourage colleagues not to cite research of white men|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|work=The Washington Times|access-date=2018-10-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==The geography of women== 
The geography of women focuses upon description of the effects on [[gender inequality]]. Its theoretical influences focus on welfare geography and [[liberal feminism]]. Geographically, feminist geographers emphasize on constraints of distance and spatial separation. As Seager et al. argues, gender is only the narrow-minded approach when understanding the oppression of women throughout the decades of colonial history. In such, understanding the geography of women would mean taking a critical approach in questioning the dimensions of age, class, ethnicity, orientation and other socio-economic factors (2004).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Seager, J., &amp; Nelson, L. (Eds.). (2004). Companion to Feminist Geography. Williston, VT, USA: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; An early reproach of geography of women approach was that gender roles were mainly explained as gender inequality, such as housewives and mothers, in combination with the some concept of spatial constraint. However, Foord and Gregson (1986) argued that the concept of [[gender role]]s narrows the focus to women, emerges from a static [[social theory]], and presents women as victims. Furthermore, it gives a narrow reading of distance even though the geography of women displays how spatial constraint and separation enter into the construction of women’s position. Theorist Edward Said critiques the idea of geographical spaces in such a context where our actions on gendered practices of representation are fabricated through dominant ideological beliefs (2004).&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, D. (2004). The colonial present. (pp. 18-19). Victoria: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to the misrepresentation of gender roles and taken-for-granted movements on feminine rights, we see that the challenges of the colonial present lies within the confinement of women in limited spatial opportunities. Hence, feminist geographies should consider and trace the inter-connections in all aspects of daily life; in other words, gender should be applied and developed in terms of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Massey|first=Doreen|title=Space, Place, and Gender|year=1990|publisher=University of Minnesota Press Minneapolis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Socialist feminist geography==
[[Socialist feminist]] geography seeks to explain inequality and the relationship between [[capitalism]] and [[patriarchy]]. It uses [[Marxism]] and [[Socialist feminism]] to explain the interdependence of geography, gender relations and economic development under capitalism. Socialist feminist geography revolved around the questions of how to reduce gender inequality based on patriarchy and capitalism. It has theoretical influences on Marxism, socialist feminism. The geographical focus is on spatial separation, gender place, and localities. One of the key theoretical debates within socialist feminist geography revolved around the question of how best to articulate gender and [[class (social)|class]] analysis. For instance, drawing on of married mainland Chinese immigrant women living in New York City. While women remain the primary object of analysis, and gender remains the primary social relation, Zhou is intensely aware that many other factors, such as class, also affect women’s post-migration experiences and circumstances.&lt;ref name="Longhurt 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Longhurt|first=Robyn|title=Geography and gender: a 'critical' time?|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two scales that socialist feminist geographers first worked primarily. First, at the urban scale, Anglo-American feminist geographers focused on the social and spatial separation of suburban homes from paid employment; this was seen as vital to the day-to-day and generational reproduction of workers and the development and maintenance of traditional gender relations in capitalist societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial change, the domestic economy and home life|last=MaccKenzie|first=S.|author2=Rose, D.|publisher=|year=1983|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Socialist feminist geographers widely attending to the ways that gender relations differ from place to place not only reflect, but also partly determine local economic changes. Judith Butler’s idea of citationality expands on the concept of the lack of agency to facilitate the presence of women within the discipline of geography. In such, we come to the awareness that whenever performative measures are taken to diminish women’s rights in geographical space, the conventions around it adapt around this context to make it seem as the norm.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, J. (2001). Perform or Else : From Discipline to Performance. London, GBR: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, feminist geographers are also drawing on a broader range of social, and particularly cultural theory, including [[psychoanalysis]] and [[post-structuralism]], in order to develop a fuller understanding of how gender relations and identities are shaped and assumed. This has led to fundamental rethinking of the category gender, and the contradictions and possibilities presented by the seeming instability and insistent repetitions of [[gender norm]]s in practice. The focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories has brought feminist geographers into dialogue with other strands of critical geography. But another consequence is that theoretical differences among feminist geographers are more obvious than in the past, but according to Monk 1994 the national differences between America and British geographers may be diminishing as both parties pursue new directions.

==Feminist geographies of difference==
Feminist geographies of difference concentrate upon the construction of gendered identities, differences among women, gender and constructions of nature by using cultural, post-structural, [[postcolonial]] and psychoanalytic theories, which writings of [[women of color]], [[lesbian]] women, gay men and women from [[third world]] countries. In terms of geography, feminist geographers emphasize on micro-geographies of body, mobile identities, distance, separation and place, [[imagined geographies]], [[colonialism]] and post-colonialism, and environment or [[nature]].

Since the late 1980s, many feminist geographers have moved on to three new research areas:

First, feminist geographers contest and expand the category of genders between men and women. The difference in the construction of gender relations across race, ethnicity, age, religion, sexuality and nationality, becomes interesting for feminist geographers. Additionally, feminist geographers are also increasingly attentive to women who are positioned in various ways along the multiple axis of difference.

Second, in order to get better understanding of how gender relations and identities are formed and assumed, a broader extent of social theory, particular culture, are drawn by feminist geographers. Feminist geographers are more able to discuss and debate after the focus on multiple identifications and the influence of post-structuralist and psychoanalytic theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Monk|first=J.|title=On not excluding the other half from human geography|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third, a key area of discussion is about the difference between [[relativism]] and [[situated knowledge]], and ways to reconcile partial perspectives with commitment to political action and social change.

==Critical human geography==
Critical human geography is defined as “a diverse and rapidly changing set of ideas and practices within human geography linked by a share commitment to [[emancipatory politics]] within and beyond the discipline, to the promotion of progressive social change and to the development of a broad range of critical theories and their application in geographical research and political practice.” (Johnston 2000).&lt;ref name="Longhurt 2002"/&gt;

Critical human geography comes from Anglophonic geography in the mid-1990s. It presents a broad alliance of progressive approaches to the discipline. Critical human geographers draw on theoretical approaches such as [[anarchism]], [[anti-colonialism]], [[critical race theory]], [[environmentalism]], [[feminism]], [[Marxism]], nonrepresentational theory, [[post-Marxism]], post-colonialism, post-structuralism, [[psychoanalysis]], [[queer theory]], [[situationism]], and [[socialism]]. Much of the focus is on some of the key publications marking different eras in critical geography.

Critical human geography must be understood as multiple, dynamic, and contested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warf|first=Barney|title=Encyclopedia of Geography Critical Human Geography|year=2010|publisher=University British Columbia-vancouve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than a specific sub-discipline of [[geography]], feminist geography is often considered part of a broader [[postmodern]], [[critical theory]] approach, often drawing from the theories of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jacques Derrida]], and [[Judith Butler]] among others. More recent influences include critiques of feminism from [[post-colonial]] theorists. Feminist geographers often focus on the lived experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities, rather than theoretical development without [[empirical]] work.&lt;ref name=rose/&gt;

Many feminist geographers study the same subjects as other geographers, but often with a focus on [[gender]] divisions.&lt;ref name=mcdowell&gt;McDowell, Linda (1993) "Space, place and gender relations" in ''Progress in Human Geography'' 17(2)&lt;/ref&gt; This concern has developed into a concern with wider issues of gender, family, sexuality, race, and class. Examples of areas of focus include:
* Geographic differences in [[gender]] relations and [[gender equality]]
* The geography of [[women]]: spatial constraints, welfare geography
* The construction of [[gender identity]] through the use and nature of spaces and [[Location (geography)|places]]
* Geographies of [[Sexuality and space|sexuality]] ([[queer theory]])
* [[Children's geographies]]

Feminist geographers are also deeply impacted and responding to contemporary globalization and neoliberal discourses that are manifested as being both transnational and translocal. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In addition to societal studies, Feminist Geography also critiques [[Human Geography]] and other academic disciplines,  arguing that academic structures have been traditionally characterized by a [[patriarchal]] perspective, and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the [[masculine]] bias of academic study.&lt;ref name="Moss"&gt;Moss, Pamela, 2007 ''Feminisms in Geography: Rethinking Space, Place, and Knowledges'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Geographer [[Gillian Rose (geographer)|Gillian Rose's]] ''Feminism and Geography''&lt;ref name="rose" /&gt; is one such sustained criticism, focused on Human Geography in Britain as being historically [[masculinist]] in its approach. This includes the writing of landscape as feminine (and thus as subordinate to male geographers), assuming a separation between mind and body.  The following is referenced from Johnston &amp; Sidaway (2004),&lt;ref name="johnston"&gt;Johnston, R.J. &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;D. Sidaway.  (2004). ''Geography and Geographers.'' London: Arnold, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt; and further describes such a separation and its influence on geography:

{{Quotation|"'[[Cartesian dualism]] underlines our thinking in a myriad of ways, not least in the divergence of the social sciences from the natural sciences, and in a geography which is based on the separation of people from their environments.  Thus while geography is unusual in its spanning of the natural and social sciences and in focusing on the interrelations between people and their environments, it is still assumed that the two are distinct and one acts on the other. Geography, like all of the social sciences, has been built upon a particular conception of mind and body which sees them as separate, apart and acting on each other (Johnston, 1989, cited in Longhurst, 1997, p. 492)' 
Thus, too, feminist work has sought to transform approaches to the study of landscape by relating it to the way that it is represented ('appreciated' so to speak), in ways that are analogous to the heterosexual male gaze directed towards the female body (Nash 1996). Both of these concerns (and others)- about the body as a contested site and for the Cartesian distinction between mind and body - have been challenged in [[postmodern]] and [[poststructuralist]] feminist geographies."}}

Other feminist geographers have interrogated the ways in which the discipline of geography itself represents and reproduces the heterosexual male gaze. Feminist geographers such as [[Katherine McKittrick]] have asserted pointed critiques of the ways in which we see and understand space are fundamentally bound up in how we understand the hegemonic presence of the white male subject in history, geography and in the materiality of everyday space. Building off of [[Sylvia Wynter]]'s theories of the racialized production of public and private space, McKittrick challenges “social landscapes that presume [[subaltern]] populations have no relationship to the production of space” &lt;ref name=mckittrick&gt;McKittrick, Katherine. ''Demonic Grounds: Black Women and the Cartographies of Struggle''. Minneapolis, MN: University of Minnesota Press, 2006. p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; and writes to document black female geographies in order to "allow us to engage with a narrative that locates and draws on black histories and black subjects in order to make visible social lives which are often displaced, rendered ungeographic.”&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, x.&lt;/ref&gt; McKittrick stakes claim in the co-articulation of race and gender as they articulate space and she writes, “I am emphasizing here that racism and sexism are not simply bodily or identity based; racism and sexism are also spatial acts and illustrate black women’s geographic experiences and knowledges as they are made possible through domination.”&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, xviii&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, many feminist geographers have critiqued human geography for its centering of masculine knowledge and its emphasis on “objective” knowledge arguing instead for a use of situated knowledge which understands both observation and analysis as being rooted in partial objectivity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coddington|first=Kate|date=2015|title=Feminist Geographies “Beyond” Gender: de-Coupling Feminist Research and the Gendered Subject|url=|journal=Geography Compass|volume=9|pages=214-224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Challenges of feminist geography ==
Linda McDowell and Joanne P. Sharp, both foundational feminist geographers and scholars, describe the struggle of gaining recognition in academia, “[It has been] ‘a long struggle to gain recognition within geography as a discipline that gender relations are a central organizing feature both of the material and symbolic worlds and of the theoretical basis of the discipline.’’&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Space, gender, knowledge: Feminist readings|last=McDowell|first=Linda|last2=Sharp|first2=Joanne|publisher=|year=1997|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist geographers struggle in academia in a variety of ways. Firstly, ideas that originate from feminist discourse are often seen as common sense once the wider field accepts them thereby invisibilizing geography that is explicitly feminist. Furthermore, feminist geography is understood to be the only subfield of geography where gender is explicitly addressed permitting the wider disciple to disengage from feminist challenges. Finally, within the field, some geographers believe that feminist practice has been fully integrated into the academy making feminist geography obsolete.

Challenges of feminist geography are also embedded in the subfield itself. The epistemology of feminist geography argues that the positionality and lived experience of the geographers are as central to scholarship as what is being researched. In this way, feminist geographers must maintain diverse identities to fully engage with the disciple. Linda Peake and Gill Valentine point out that while feminist geography has addressed gender issues in more than twenty-five countries across the world, this scholarship is conducted by white female scholars from institutions in the Global North.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peake|first=Linda|last2=Valentine|first2=Gill|date=2003|title=Editorial|url=|journal=Gender, Place and Culture|volume=10(2)|pages=107-09|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way, feminist geography faces not only barriers rooted in the academy but a lack of diversity in its own field. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dias|first=Karen|last2=Blecha|first2=Jennifer|date=2007|title=Feminism and Social Theory in Geography: An Introduction*|url=|journal=Professional Geographer|volume=59(1)|pages=1-9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies surrounding feminist geography ==
In 2018, a leading journal in feminist geography, Gender, Place and Culture, was subject to a [[Scholarly publishing hoax|scholarly publishing hoax.]] Helen Pluckrose, James A. Lindsay and [[Peter Boghossian]] submitted a paper titled "Human Reactions to Rape Culture and Queer Performativity in Urban Dog Parks in Portland, Oregon".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The paper proposed that dog parks are “rape-condoning spaces”, and a place of rampant canine rape culture and systemic oppression against “the oppressed dog” through which human attitudes to both problems can be measured and analyzed by applying [[black feminist criminology]]. The paper suggested that this could provide insight into training men out of the sexual violence and bigotry. The paper has since been retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Helen|date=2018-10-05|title=Retracted article: Human reactions to rape culture and queer performativity at urban dog parks in Portland, Oregon|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/0966369X.2018.1475346|journal=Gender, Place &amp; Culture|language=en|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/0966369x.2018.1475346|issn=0966-369X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hoax has been criticized as unethical and mean-spirited, and critics of the hoax have suggested that the hoaxers do not understand the process of peer review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/What-the-Grievance/244753|title=What the ‘Grievance Studies’ Hoax Means|date=2018-10-09|work=The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date=2018-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Field of Streams''' is a patch of sky where several [[stellar streams]] are visible and crisscross.

It was discovered by [[Vasily Belokurov]] and [[Daniel Zucker]]'s team in 2006 by analyzing the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]] II (SDSS-II) data. The team named the area ''Field of Streams'' because of so many crisscrossing trails of stars.&lt;ref&gt;''SDSS'', [http://www.sdss.org/news/releases/20060508.mergers.html "Multiple galaxy mergers continue in the Milky Way"], 2006 May 8 (accessed 2009 March 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sagittarius Stream]] of the [[Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy]] (SagDEG) dominates the ''Field''. It has a split trail within the area of the Field of Streams, because SagDEG has wrapped around the Milky Way Galaxy multiple times, which has resulted in overlapping trails. The forking of the trail has made inferences of the organization of dark matter in the inner halo of the Milky Way Galaxy possible, resulting in the determination that it is distributed in a round spherical manner, as opposed to the expected flattened spheroid. The shape of the streams also implies that the dark matter is very cold [[cold dark matter]], due to the thin trails, and persisting existence.&lt;ref&gt;''SpaceDaily'', [http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Milky_Way_A_Field_Of_Streams.html "Milky Way A Field Of Streams"], 2006 May 9 (accessed 2009 March 29)&lt;/ref&gt;

Also appearing in the Field is the [[Monoceros Ring]], which was not discovered by the team which discovered the Field.&lt;ref&gt;''SDSS'', [http://www.sdss.org/includes/sideimages/fos_dr6_marked.html "Map of stars in the outer regions of the Milky Way Galaxy"], ''V. Belokurov, Sloan Digital Sky Survey'' (accessed 2009 March 29) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319050248/http://www.sdss.org/includes/sideimages/fos_dr6_marked.html |date=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''gazetteer''' is a geographical [[dictionary]] or [[Directory (databases)|directory]] used in conjunction with a map or [[atlas]].&lt;ref name="aurousseau 61"&gt;Aurousseau, 61.&lt;/ref&gt; It typically contains information concerning the geographical makeup, [[social statistics]] and physical features of a country, region, or continent. Content of a gazetteer can include a subject's location, dimensions of peaks and waterways, [[statistical population|population]], [[gross domestic product]] and literacy rate. This information is generally divided into topics with entries listed in alphabetical order.

[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] gazetteers are known to have existed since the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] era. The first known Chinese gazetteer was released by the first century, and with the age of print media in [[History of typography in East Asia|China by the ninth century]], the [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]] became invested in producing gazetteers for their local areas as a source of information as well as local pride. The geographer [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] wrote a geographical dictionary (which currently has missing parts) in the sixth century which influenced later European compilers. Modern gazetteers can be found in reference sections of most [[libraries]] as well as on the internet.

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary}}
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' defines a "gazetteer" as a "geographical index or dictionary".&lt;ref name="white 658"/&gt; It includes as an example a work by the British historian [[Laurence Echard]] (d.&amp;nbsp;1730) in 1693 that bore the title "The Gazetteer's: or Newsman's Interpreter: Being a Geographical Index".&lt;ref name="white 658"/&gt; Echard wrote that the title "Gazetteer's" was suggested to him by a "very eminent person" whose name he chose not to disclose.&lt;ref name="white 658"/&gt; For Part&amp;nbsp;II of this work published in 1704, Echard referred to the book simply as "the Gazeteer". This marked the introduction of the word "gazetteer" into the [[English language]].&lt;ref name="white 658"&gt;White, 658.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Robert C. White suggests that the "very eminent person" written of by Echard was his colleague [[Edmund Bohun]], and chose not to mention Bohun because he became associated with the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite movement]].&lt;ref name="white 658"/&gt;

Since the 18th century, the word "gazetteer" has been used interchangeably to define either its traditional meaning (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;a geographical dictionary or directory) or a daily [[newspaper]], such as the ''London Gazetteer''.&lt;ref name="thomas 623 636"&gt;Thomas, 623–636.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asquith 703 724"&gt;Asquith, 703–724.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types and organization==
Gazetteers are often categorized by the type, and scope, of the information presented. ''World gazetteers'' usually consist of an alphabetical listing of countries, with pertinent [[statistics]] for each one, with some gazetteers listing information on individual [[cities]], [[town]]s, [[villages]], and other [[town|settlements]] of varying sizes. ''Short-form gazetteers'', often used in conjunction with computer mapping and [[Geographic information system|GIS]] systems, may simply contain a list of place-names together with their locations in [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] or other [[spatial referencing systems]] (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;[[British National Grid]] reference). Short-form gazetteers appear as a place–name index in the rear of major published atlases. ''Descriptive gazetteers'' may include lengthy textual descriptions of the places they contain, including explanation of [[industries]], [[government]], [[geography]], together with historical perspectives, maps and/or photographs. ''Thematic gazetteers'' list places or geographical features by theme; for example fishing ports, [[nuclear power]] stations, or historic buildings. Their common element is that the geographical location is an important attribute of the features listed.

Gazetteer editors gather facts and other information from official government reports, the [[census]], [[chambers of commerce]], together with numerous other sources, and organise these in [[wikt:digest|digest]] form.

In his journal article "Alexander and the Ganges" (1923), the 20th-century historian [[William Woodthorpe Tarn|W.W. Tarn]] calls a list and description of [[satrap]]ies of [[Alexander the Great|Alexander's Empire]] written between 324 and 323 BC as an ancient gazetteer.&lt;ref name="tarn 93 94"&gt;Tarn, 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt; Tarn notes that the document is dated no later than June 323 BC, since it features [[Partition of Babylon|Babylon as not yet partitioned]] by Alexander's generals.&lt;ref name="tarn 94"&gt;Tarn, 94.&lt;/ref&gt; It was revised by the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] in the 1st century BC.&lt;ref name="tarn 94"/&gt; In the 1st century BC, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] mentioned the [[chronicle]]-type format of the writing of the [[Logographer (history)|logographers]] in the age before the founder of the Greek historiographic tradition, [[Herodotus]] (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;before the 480s BC), saying "they did not write connected accounts but instead broke them up according to peoples and cities, treating each separately".&lt;ref name="brown 1954 837"&gt;Brown (1954), 837.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Truesdell Sparhawk Brown|Truesdell S. Brown]] asserts that what Dionysius describes in this quote about the logographers should be categorized not as a true "history" but rather as a gazetteer.&lt;ref name="brown 1954 837"/&gt; While discussing the Greek conception of the [[river delta]] in ancient Greek literature, Francis Celoria notes that both [[Ptolemy]] and [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] of the 2nd century AD provided gazetteer information on geographical terms.&lt;ref name="celoria 387"&gt;Celoria, 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps predating Greek gazetteers were those made in [[ancient Egypt]]. Although she does not specifically label the document as a gazetteer, [[Penelope Wilson]] (Department of Archaeology, [[Durham University]]) describes an ancient Egyptian [[papyrus]] found at the site of [[Tanis, Egypt]] (a city founded during the [[Twentieth dynasty of Egypt]]) which provides the following for each [[Nome (Egypt)|administrative area of Egypt]] at the time:&lt;ref name="wilson 2003 98"&gt;Wilson (2003), 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;...the name of a nome capital, its sacred barque, its sacred tree, its cemetery, the date of its festival, the names of forbidden objects, the local god, land, and lake of the city. This interesting codification of data, probably made by a priest, is paralleled by very similar editions of data on the temple walls at Edfu, for example.&lt;ref name="wilson 2003 98"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Medieval and early modern eras====
The ''[[Domesday Book]]'' initiated by [[William&amp;nbsp;I of England]] in 1086 was a government survey on all the administrative counties of England; it was used to assess the properties of farmsteads and landholders in order to tax them sufficiently. In the survey, numerous English [[castle]]s were listed; scholars debate on exactly how many were actually referenced in the book.&lt;ref name="harfield 372"&gt;Harfield, 372.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Domesday Book'' does detail the fact that out of 3,558 registered houses destroyed in 112 different boroughs listed, 410 of these destroyed houses were the direct result of castle construction and expansion.&lt;ref name="harfield 373 374"&gt;Harfield, 373–374.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1316 the [[Nomina Villarum]] survey was initiated by [[Edward II of England]]; it was essentially a list of all the administrative subdivisions throughout England which could be utilized by the state in order to assess how much military troops could be conscripted and summoned from each region.&lt;ref name="ravenhill 425"&gt;Ravenhill, 425.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Speculum Britanniae]]'' (1596) of the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor era]] English cartographer and topographer [[John Norden]] (1548–1625) had an alphabetical list of places throughout England with headings showing their [[Hundred (country subdivision)|administrative hundreds]] and referenced to attached maps.&lt;ref name="ravenhill 424"&gt;Ravenhill, 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Englishman [[John Speed]]'s ''Theatre of the Empire of Great Britaine'' published in 1611 provided gazetteers for counties throughout England, which included illustrative maps, short local histories, a list of administrative hundreds, an index of [[parish]]es, and the coordinates of [[longitude]] and [[latitude]] for county towns.&lt;ref name="ravenhill 426"&gt;Ravenhill, 426.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 1662, the Hearth Tax Returns with attached maps of local areas were compiled by individual parishes throughout England while a duplicate of their records were sent to the central government offices of the [[Exchequer]].&lt;ref name="ravenhill 425"/&gt; To supplement his "new large Map of England" from 1677, the English cartographer [[John Adams (cartographer)|John Adams]] compiled the extensive gazetteer "Index Villaris" in 1680 that had some 24,000 places listed with geographical coordinates coinciding with the map.&lt;ref name="ravenhill 424"/&gt; The "Geographical Dictionary" of [[Edmund Bohun]] was published in [[London]] in 1688, comprising 806 pages with some 8,500 entries.&lt;ref name="white 657"&gt;White, 657.&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, Edmund Bohun attributed the first known Western geographical dictionary to geographer [[Stephanus of Byzantium]] (fl. 6th century) while also noting influence in his work from the ''Thesaurus Geographicus'' (1587) by the [[Belgium|Belgian]] cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] (1527–1598), but stated that Ortelius' work dealt largely with ancient geography and not up-to-date information.&lt;ref name="white 657"/&gt; Only fragments of Stephanus' geographical work ''Ethnica'' (Εθνικά) have survived and were first examined by the Italian printer [[Aldus Manutius]] in his work of 1502.

The Italian monk [[Filippo Ferrari|Phillippus Ferrarius]] (d.&amp;nbsp;1626) published his geographical dictionary "Epitome Geographicus in Quattuor Libros Divisum" in the Swiss city of [[Zurich]] in 1605.&lt;ref name="white 656"&gt;White, 656.&lt;/ref&gt; He divided this work into overhead topics of cities, rivers, mountains, and lakes and swamps.&lt;ref name="white 656"/&gt; All placenames, given in [[Latin]], were arranged in alphabetical order for each overhead division by geographic type;.&lt;ref name="white 656"/&gt; A year after his death, his "Lexicon Geographicum" was published, which contained more than 9,000 different entries for geographic places.&lt;ref name="white 656"/&gt; This was an improvement over Ortelius' work, since it included modern placenames and places discovered since the time of Ortelius.&lt;ref name="white 656"/&gt;

[[Pierre Duval (geographer)|Pierre Duval]] (1618–1683), a nephew of the French cartographer [[Nicolas Sanson]], wrote various geographical dictionaries. These include a dictionary on the [[abbey]]s of France, a dictionary on ancient sites of the [[Assyria]]ns, [[Persian Empire|Persians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] with their modern equivalent names, and a work published in [[Paris]] in 1651 that was both the first universal and [[vernacular]] geographical dictionary of Europe.&lt;ref name="white 657"&gt;White, 657.&lt;/ref&gt; With the gradual expansion of [[Laurence Echard]]'s (d.&amp;nbsp;1730) gazetteer of 1693, it too became a universal geographical dictionary that was translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]] in 1750, into [[French language|French]] in 1809, and into [[Italian language|Italian]] in 1810.&lt;ref name="white 659"&gt;White, 659.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[American Revolutionary War]], United States clergyman and historian [[Jeremy Belknap]] and [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]] [[Ebenezer Hazard]] intended to create the first post-revolutionary geographical works and gazetteers, but they were anticipated by the clergyman and geographer [[Jedidiah Morse]] with his ''Geography Made Easy'' in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1941), 153–154.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Morse was unable to finish the gazetteer in time for his 1784 geography and postponed it.&lt;ref name="brown 1941 189"/&gt; Yet his delay to publish it lasted too long, as it was Joseph Scott in 1795 who published the first post-revolutionary American gazetteer, his ''Gazetteer of the United States''.&lt;ref name="brown 1941 189"&gt;Brown (1941), 189.&lt;/ref&gt; With the aid of [[Noah Webster]] and Rev. Samuel Austin, Morse finally published his gazetteer ''The American Universal Geography'' in 1797.&lt;ref name="brown 1941 189 190"&gt;Brown (1941), 189–190.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Morse's gazetteer did not receive distinction by literary critics, as gazetteers were deemed as belonging to a lower literary class.&lt;ref name="brown 1941 190"&gt;Brown (1941), 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The reviewer of Joseph Scott's 1795 gazetteer commented that it was "little more than medleys of politics, history and miscellaneous remarks on the manners, languages and arts of different nations, arranged in the order in which the territories stand on the map".&lt;ref name="brown 1941 190"/&gt; Nevertheless, in 1802 Morse followed up his original work by co-publishing ''A New Gazetteer of the Eastern Continent'' with Rev. Elijah Parish, the latter of whom Ralph H. Brown asserts did the "lion's share of the work in compiling it".&lt;ref name="brown 1941 194"&gt;Brown (1941), 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
Gazetteers became widely popular in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in the 19th century, with publishers such as [[Archibald Fullarton|Fullarton]], [[William Mackenzie (publisher)|Mackenzie]], [[William Chambers (publisher)|Chambers]] and [[Johnston Press#History|W &amp; A.&amp;nbsp;K. Johnston]], many of whom were [[Scotland|Scottish]], meeting public demand for information on an expanding Empire. This British tradition continues in the electronic age with innovations such as the [[National Land and Property Gazetteer]], the text-based [[Gazetteer for Scotland]], and the new (2008) [[National Gazetteer (for Scotland)]], formerly known as the Definitive National Address – Scotland National Gazetteer. In addition to local or regional gazetteers, there have also been comprehensive world gazetteers published; an early example would be the 1912 world gazetteer published by [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]].&lt;ref name="aurousseau 66"&gt;Aurousseau, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also interregional gazetteers with a specific focus, such as the gazetteer of the Swedish atlas "Das Bästas Bilbok" (1969), a road atlas and guide for [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], and [[Denmark]].&lt;ref name="murphy 113"&gt;Murphy, 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Han dynasty]] (202 BC–220 AD) [[China]], the ''[[Yuejue Shu]]'' (越絕書) written in 52 AD is considered by modern [[Sinology|sinologists]] and historians to be the prototype of the gazetteer ([[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]]: ''difangzhi''), as it contained essays on a wide variety of subjects including changes in territorial division, the founding of cities, local products, and customs.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 406"&gt;Hargett (1996), 406.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the first gazetteer proper is considered to be the [[Chronicles of Huayang]] by [[Chang Qu]] 常璩. There are over 8,000 gazetteers of pre-modern China that have survived.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 405"&gt;Hargett (1996), 405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 162"&gt;Thogersen &amp; Clausen, 162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bol, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Gazetteers became more common in the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279), yet the bulk of surviving gazetteers were written during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) and [[Qing dynasty]] (1644–1912).&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 405"/&gt; Modern scholar Liu Weiyi notes that just under 400 gazetteers were compiled in the era between the [[End of the Han dynasty|fall of the Han dynasty]] in 220 and the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907).&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 407"&gt;Hargett (1996), 407.&lt;/ref&gt; Gazetteers from this era focused on boundaries and territory, place names, mountains and rivers, ancient sites, local products, local [[Chinese mythology|myths and legends]], customs, [[botany]], [[topography]], and locations of palaces, streets, temples, etc.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 408"&gt;Hargett (1996), 408.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Tang dynasty the gazetteer became much more geographically specific, with a broad amount of content arranged topically; for example, there would be individual sections devoted to local astronomy, schools, dikes, canals, post stations, altars, local deities, temples, tombs, etc.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 411"&gt;Hargett (1996), 411.&lt;/ref&gt; By the Song dynasty it became more common for gazetteers to provide biographies of local celebrities, accounts of elite local families, bibliographies, and literary anthologies of poems and essays dedicated to famous local spots.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 407"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bol, 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Song gazetteers also made lists and descriptions of city walls, gate names, wards and markets, districts, population size, and residences of former [[Prefecture (China)|prefects]].&lt;ref&gt;Hargett (1996), 414.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 610 after the [[Sui dynasty]] (581–618) united a politically divided China, [[Emperor Yang of Sui]] had all the [[History of the political divisions of China|empire's commanderies]] prepare gazetteers called '[[History of cartography#China|maps and treatises]]' (Chinese: ''tujing'') so that a vast amount of updated textual and visual information on local roads, rivers, canals, and landmarks could be utilized by the central government to maintain control and provide better security.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 409 410"&gt;Hargett (1996), 409–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 518"&gt;Needham, Volume 3, 518.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[History of cartography#China|earliest extant Chinese maps]] date to the 4th century BC,&lt;ref name="hsu 90"&gt;Hsu, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''tujing'' since the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] (221–206 BC) or Han dynasties, this was the first known instance in China when the textual information of ''tujing'' became the primary element over the drawn illustrations.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 409"&gt;Hargett (1996), 409.&lt;/ref&gt; This Sui dynasty process of providing maps and visual aids in written gazetteers—as well as the submitting of gazetteers with illustrative maps by local administrations to the central government—was continued in every subsequent [[Dynasties in Chinese history|Chinese dynasty]].&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 410"&gt;Hargett (1996), 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian James M. Hargett states that by the time of the Song dynasty, gazetteers became far more geared towards serving the current political, administrative, and military concerns than in gazetteers of previous eras, while there were many more gazetteers compiled on the local and national levels than in previous eras.&lt;ref name="hargett 1996 412"&gt;Hargett (1996), 412.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emperor Taizu of Song]] ordered Lu Duosun and a team of cartographers and scholars in 971 to initiate the compilation of a huge atlas and nationwide gazetteer that covered the whole of [[China proper]],&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 518"/&gt; which comprised approximately 1,200 [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]] and 300 [[Prefecture (China)|prefectures]].&lt;ref name="bol 44"&gt;Bol, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; This project was completed in 1010 by a team of scholars under Song Zhun, who presented it in 1,566 chapters to the throne of [[Emperor Zhenzong of Song|Emperor Zhenzong]].&lt;ref name="needham volume 3 518"/&gt; This Sui dynasty process of infrequently collecting ''tujing'' or "map guides" continued, but it would be enhanced by the matured literary genre of ''fangzhi'' or "treatise on a place" of the Song dynasty.&lt;ref name="bol 44"/&gt; Although Zheng Qiao of the 12th century did not notice the ''fangzhi'' while writing his encyclopedic ''Tongzhi'' including monographs to geography and cities, others such as the bibliographer Chen Zhensun of the 13th century were listing gazetteers instead of the map guides in their works.&lt;ref name="bol 44"/&gt; The main differences between the ''fangzhi'' and the ''tujing'' was that the former was a product of "local initiative, not a central command" according to Peter K. Bol, and were usually ten, twenty, or even fifty chapters in length compared to the average four chapters for map guides.&lt;ref name="bol 46"&gt;Bol, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the ''fangzhi'' were almost always [[History of typography in East Asia|printed]] because they were intended for a large reading audience, whereas ''tujing'' were exclusive records read by the local officials who drafted them and the central government officials who collected them.&lt;ref name="bol 46"/&gt; Although most Song gazetteers credited local officials as the authors, already in the Song there were bibliographers who noted that non-official literati were asked to compose these works or did so on their own behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Bol, 47.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 16th century—during the Ming dynasty—local gazetteers were commonly composed due to local decision-making rather than a central government mandate.&lt;ref name="bol 38"&gt;Bol, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Peter K. Bol states that local gazetteers composed in this manner were the result of increased domestic and international trade that facilitated greater local wealth throughout China.&lt;ref name="bol 38"/&gt; Historian [[Richard Britnell|R.&amp;nbsp;H. Britnell]] writes of gazetteers in Ming China, "by the sixteenth century, for a [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]] or [[Chinese Buddhism|monastery]] not to have a gazetteer was regarded as evidence that the place was inconsequential".&lt;ref&gt;Britnell, 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

While working in the [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|Department of Arms]], the Tang dynasty cartographer [[Jia Dan]] (730–805) and his colleagues would [[Foreign relations of Imperial China|acquire information from foreign envoys]] about their respective homelands, and from these interrogations would produce maps supplemented by textual information.&lt;ref name="schafer 26 27"&gt;Schafer, 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; Even within China, [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] information on [[Ethnic minorities in China|ethnic minorities]] of non-[[Han Chinese|Han]] peoples were often described in the local histories and gazetteers of provinces such as [[Guizhou]] during the Ming and Qing dynasties.&lt;ref name="hostetler 633"&gt;Hostetler, 633.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Qing dynasty pushed further with its troops and government authorities into areas of Guizhou that were uninhabited and not administered by the Qing government, the official gazetteers of the region would be revised to include the newly drawn-up districts and non-Han ethnic groups (mostly [[Miao people]]s) therein.&lt;ref name="hostetler 633"/&gt; While the late Ming dynasty officials who compiled the information on the ethnic groups of Guizhou offered scanty details about them in their gazetteers (perhaps due to their lack of contact with these peoples), the later Qing dynasty gazetteers often provided a much more comprehensive analysis.&lt;ref name="hostetler 634"&gt;Hostetler, 634.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1673 the Guizhou gazetteers featured different written entries for the various Miao peoples of the region.&lt;ref name="hostetler 634"/&gt; Historian Laura Holsteter writes on the [[Woodblock printing|woodblock print illustrations]] of Miao peoples in the Guizhou gazeteer, stating "the 1692 version of the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi era]] gazetteer show a refinement in the quality of the illustrations by comparison to 1673".&lt;ref&gt;Hostetler, 637–638.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[Timothy Brook (historian)|Timothy Brook]] states that Ming dynasty gazetteers demonstrate a shift in the attitudes of [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]] towards the traditionally lower [[Four occupations|merchant class]].&lt;ref name="brook numerous pages"/&gt; As time went on, the gentry solicited funds from merchants to build and repair schools, print scholarly books, build [[Chinese pagoda]]s on [[geomancy|auspicious sites]], and other things that were needed by the gentry and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]] in order to succeed.&lt;ref name="brook numerous pages"&gt;Brook, 6–7, 73, 90–93, 129–130, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, the gentry figures composing the gazetteers in the latter half of the Ming period spoke favorably of merchants, whereas before they were rarely mentioned.&lt;ref name="brook numerous pages"/&gt; Brook and other modern sinologist historians also examine and consult the local Ming gazetteers to compare population info with the contemporary central government records, which often provided dubious population figures that did not reflect the actually larger population size of China during the time.&lt;ref name="brook 28 94 96 267"&gt;Brook, 28, 94–96, 267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although better known for his work on the ''[[Gujin Tushu Jicheng]]'' encyclopedia, the early-to-mid Qing scholar [[Jiang Tingxi]] aided other scholars in the compilation of the "Daqing Yitongzhi" ('Gazetteer of the Qing Empire').&lt;ref name="fairbank teng 211"&gt;Fairbank &amp; Teng, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; This was provided with a preface in 1744 (more than a decade after Jiang's death), revised in 1764, and reprinted in 1849.&lt;ref name="fairbank teng 211"/&gt;

The [[Jesuit China missions|Italian Jesuit]] [[Matteo Ricci]] created the first comprehensive world map in the [[Chinese language]] in the early 17th century,&lt;ref name="wong 44"&gt;Wong, 44.&lt;/ref&gt; while comprehensive world gazetteers were later translated into Chinese by Europeans. The [[Protestant missions in China 1807–1953|Christian missionary]] William Muirhead (1822–1900), who lived in [[Shanghai]] during the late Qing period, published the gazetteer "Dili quanzhi", which was reprinted in Japan in 1859.&lt;ref name="masuda 18"/&gt; Divided into fifteen volumes, this work covered Europe, Asia, Africa, and the [[List of archipelagos#Pacific Ocean|Pacific Ocean Archipelagos]], and was sub-divided further into sections on geography, topography, water masses, atmosphere, biology, anthropology, and historical geography.&lt;ref name="masuda 18 19"&gt;Masuda, 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese maritime trade gazetteers mentioned a slew of different countries that came to trade in China, such as United States vessels docking at [[Guangzhou|Canton]] in the "Yuehaiguanzhi" ('Gazetteer of the Maritime Customs of Guangdong') published in 1839 (reprinted in 1935).&lt;ref name="fairbank teng 215"&gt;Fairbank &amp; Teng, 215.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese language gazetteer ''[[Haiguo Tuzhi]]'' ('Illustrated Gazetteer of the Sea Kingdoms') by [[Wei Yuan]] in 1844 (with material influenced by the "Sizhou zhi" of [[Lin Zexu]])&lt;ref name="masuda 32"&gt;Masuda, 32.&lt;/ref&gt; was printed in Japan two decades later 1854.&lt;ref name="masuda 23 24"&gt;Masuda, 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; This work was popular in Japan not for its geographical knowledge, but for its analysis of potential defensive military strategy in the face of European imperialism and the Qing's recent defeat in the [[First Opium War]] due to European artillery and gunboats.&lt;ref name="masuda 23 24"/&gt;

Continuing an old tradition of ''fangzhi'', the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] had gazetteers composed and created national standards for them in 1929, updating these in 1946.&lt;ref name="vermeer 440"&gt;Vermeer 440.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing of gazetteers was revived in 1956 under [[Mao Zedong]] and again in the 1980s, after the reforms of the [[Deng Xiaoping|Deng era]] to replace the [[people's communes]] with traditional [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]].&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 161 162"&gt;Thogersen &amp; Clausen, 161–162.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''difangzhi'' effort under Mao yielded little results (only 10 of the 250 designated counties ended up publishing a gazetteer), while the writing of ''difangzhi'' was interrupted during the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966–1976), trumped by the village and family histories which were more appropriate for the theme of [[class struggle]].&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 163"&gt;Thogersen &amp; Clausen, 163.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vermeer, 440–443.&lt;/ref&gt; A Li Baiyu of [[Shanxi]] forwarded a letter to the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee|CCP Propaganda Department]] on May 1, 1979, which urged for the revival of ''difangzhi''.&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 163"/&gt; This proposal was sponsored by [[Hu Yaobang]] in June 1979 while [[Hu Qiaomu]] of the CCP Politburo lent his support for the idea in April 1980.&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 163"/&gt; The first issue of a modern national journal of ''difangzhi'' was issued by January 1981.&lt;ref name="thogersen clausen 163"/&gt;

====Korea====
In [[Korea]], scholars based their gazetteers largely on the Chinese model.&lt;ref name="mccune 326"&gt;McCune, 326.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Chinese gazetteers, there were national, provincial, and local prefecture Korean gazetteers which featured geographic information, demographic data, locations of bridges, schools, temples, tombs, fortresses, pavilions, and other landmarks, cultural customs, local products, resident clan names, and short biographies on well-known people.&lt;ref name="provine 8"&gt;Provine, 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis 225 226"&gt;Lewis, 225–226.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pratt rutt 423"/&gt; In an example of the latter, the 1530 edition of "Sinjŭng tongguk yŏji sŭngnam" ('New Edition of the Korean National Gazetteer') gave a brief statement about Pak Yŏn (1378–1458), noting his successful career in the [[civil service]], his exceptional filiality, his brilliance in [[music theory]], and his praisable efforts in systematizing ritual music for [[Sejong the Great of Joseon|Sejong's court]].&lt;ref name="provine 8"/&gt; King Sejong established the [[Joseon]] dynasty's first national gazetteer in 1432, called the "Sinch'an p'aldo" ('Newly Compiled Geographic Treatise on the Eight Circuits').&lt;ref name="lewis 225"&gt;Lewis, 225.&lt;/ref&gt; With additional material and correction of mistakes, the title of this gazetteer was revised in 1454 as the "Sejong Sillok chiriji" ('King Sejong's Treatise on Geography'), updated in 1531 under the title "Sinjŭng tongguk yŏji sŭngnam" ('Augmented Survey of the Geography of Korea'),&lt;ref name="lewis 225"/&gt; and enlarged in 1612.&lt;ref name="pratt rutt 423"&gt;Pratt &amp; Rutt, 423.&lt;/ref&gt; The Joseon Koreans also created international gazetteers. The "Yojisongnam" gazetteer compiled from 1451 to 1500 provides a small description for 369 different foreign countries known to Joseon Korea in the 15th century.&lt;ref name="mccune 326"/&gt;

====Japan====
In [[Japan]], there were also local gazetteers in pre-modern times, called ''[[fudoki]]''.&lt;ref name="miller 279"&gt;Miller, 279.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese gazetteers preserved historical and legendary accounts of various regions. For example, the [[Nara period|Nara-period]] (710–794) provincial gazetteer ''Harima no kuni fūdoki'' of [[Harima Province]] provides a story of an alleged visit by [[Emperor Ōjin]] in the 3rd century while on an imperial hunting expedition.&lt;ref name="taryō"&gt;Taryō, 178.&lt;/ref&gt; Local Japanese gazetteers could also be found in later periods such as the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name="levine 78"&gt;Levine, 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Gazetteers were often composed by the request of wealthy patrons; for example, six scholars in the service of the ''[[daimyō]]'' of the [[Ikeda clan|Ikeda]] household published the ''Biyō kokushi'' gazetteer for several counties in 1737.&lt;ref name="hall 211"&gt;Hall, 211.&lt;/ref&gt; World gazetteers were written by the Japanese in the 19th century, such as the ''Kon'yo zushiki'' ("Annotated Maps of the World") published by Mitsukuri Shōgo in 1845, the ''Hakkō tsūshi'' ("Comprehensive Gazetteer of the Entire World") by Mitsukuri Genpo in 1856, and the ''Bankoku zushi'' ("Illustrated Gazetteer of the Nations of the World"), which was written by an Englishman named Colton, translated by Sawa Ginjirō, and printed by Tezuka Ritsu in 1862.&lt;ref name="masuda 18"&gt;Masuda, 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the ambitious title, the work by Genpo only covered ''Yōroppa bu'' ("Section on Europe") while the planned section for Asia was not published.&lt;ref name="masuda 18"/&gt;

===South Asia===
[[File:Jesuits at Akbar's court.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Painting of [[Akbar the Great]] with [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] at his court; Akbar's vizier wrote a gazetteer on the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal realm]].]]
In pre-modern [[India]], local gazetteers were written. For example, [[Muhnot Nainsi]] wrote a gazetteer for the [[Marwar]] region in the 17th century.&lt;ref name="gole 102"&gt;Gole, 102.&lt;/ref&gt; B.&amp;nbsp;S. Baliga writes that the history of the gazetteer in [[Tamil Nadu]] can be traced back to the classical corpus of [[Sangam literature]], dated 200 BC to 300 AD.&lt;ref name="baliga 255"&gt;Baliga, 255.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak]], the [[vizier]] to [[Akbar the Great]] of the [[Mughal Empire]], wrote the ''[[Ain-e-Akbari]]'', which included a gazetteer with valuable information on India's population in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="floor clawson 347 348"&gt;Floor &amp; Clawson, 347–348.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Muslim world===
The pre-modern [[Islamic world]] produced gazetteers. Cartographers of the [[Safavid dynasty]] of [[Iran]] made gazetteers of local areas.&lt;ref&gt;King, 79.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''geology of Bolivia''' comprises a variety of different [[lithology|lithologies]] as well as [[plate tectonics|tectonic]] and [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]]. On a synoptic scale, geological units coincide with topographical units. The country is divided into a mountainous western area affected by the [[subduction]] processes in the Pacific and an eastern lowlands of stable [[platform (geology)|platforms]] and [[shield (geology)|shields]]. The Bolivian [[Andes]] is divided into three main ranges; these are from west to east: the [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]] that makes up the border to [[Chile]] and host several active [[volcano]]es and [[geothermal]] areas, [[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]] (in some contexts also called Cordillera Oriental) once extensively mined for [[silver]] and [[tin]] and the relatively low [[Cordillera Oriental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Oriental]] that rather than being a range by its own is the eastern continuation of the Central Cordillera as a [[fold and thrust belt]]. Between the Occidental and Central Cordillera the approximately 3,750-meter-high [[Altiplano]] high plateau extends.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hc-solar.de/Bericht_AR_2004_en_cm.pdf The Use of Solar Energy for Improving the Living Conditions in Altiplano/Argentina]&lt;/ref&gt; This basin hosts several freshwater lakes, including [[Lake Titicaca]] as well as salt-covered [[dry lake]]s that bring testimony of past climate changes and lake cycles. The eastern lowlands and sub-Andean zone in [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz]], [[Chuquisaca Department|Chuquisaca]], and [[Tarija Department]]s was once an old [[Paleozoic]] [[sedimentary basin]] that hosts valuable [[petroleum reserve|hydrocarbon reserves]]. Further east close to the border with Brazil lies the Guaporé Shield, made up of stable [[Precambrian]] crystalline rock.

==Andes==
{{see also|Andean orogeny}}
[[File:Nevado Sajama.jpg|thumb|6,542 meter high [[Nevado Sajama]] is one of several volcanoes along Cordillera Occidental]]
The Andes of Bolivia began to rise about 200 million years ago (mya) during the [[Jurassic]]. The western margin of what is now South America had been the place of several other [[orogeny|orogenies]] before the Andes rose. It has been hypothesized that the central Andes gained its great height 26 to 14 mya as result of a compressive [[fault (geology)|failure]] of the [[lithosphere]] beneath Bolivia and neighboring areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/geology Geology of the Altiplano], [[Oregon State University]]&lt;/ref&gt; The great heights of the Altiplano, Codillera Occidental and Cordillera Oriental are [[isostacy|isostatically]] compensated  by an up to 70&amp;nbsp;km deep [[crust (geology)|crust]]. Climate has responded to the formation of this important topographic barrier. It is not clear, however, if the rise of the Andes simply caused the extreme aridity of [[Atacama Desert]] and adjacent parts of Bolivia or if a preexisting [[desert climate]] and associated low erosion rates allowed the mountains to build up to their current heights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efn.uncor.edu/departamentos/GeoBas/materias/estratigrafiaygeologia/Home_archivos/tp/mod3/ClimateChange.pdf Neogene climate change and uplift in the Atacama Desert, Chile]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"&gt;Garcia-Castellanos, D., 2007.

===Western Cordillera===
The Western Cordillera is made up by a series of active and extinct volcanoes rising from the western edge of the Altiplano plateau. This range divides the Chilean watersheds of [[Salar de Atacama]] and the Pacific from the [[endorheic basin|endorheic]] Altiplano basin. The western volcanoes of Bolivia are part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes, a major upper [[Cenozoic]] volcanic province.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0012821X78900080|title=Upper Cenozoic Volcanism in the Central Andes – Ages and Volumes|journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters|volume=41|issue=2|pages=175|doi=10.1016/0012-821X(78)90008-0|year=1978|last1=Baker|first1=M.C.W|last2=Francis|first2=P.W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volcanic eruptions in Bolivia are scarce, the latest one occurred in [[Irruputuncu]] in 1995. Volcanic hazards do not represent any threat to the major populated centres which are all in the eastern Altiplano or further east, far away from the volcanic centers. Although the Western Cordillera concentrates most active volcanoes (volcanoes active in the last 10000 years) many old large [[stratovolcano]]es rises up to 100&amp;nbsp;km away from the main line of the Western Cordillera.

===Altiplano plateau===
{{further|Altiplano Basin}}
[[File:Laguna Colorada 1.jpg|thumb|[[Laguna Colorada]] in the southern Altiplano lies just east of [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]]'s volcanoes (background mountain).]]
The Altiplano plateau or Meseta del Collasuyu to differentiate it from other Andean [[high plateau]]x is a wide and long-lived intermontane sedimentary basin with no outlet; it is [[endorheic]]. The Altiplano is an infill of [[sediment|sedimentary material]] from both [[Cordillera Occidental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Occidental]] and [[Cordillera Oriental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Oriental]]. The origin of the Altiplano and its great height has long been major question among geologists. Today the Altiplano is believed to have been an early [[foreland basin]] of the "proto-Andes" that got uplifted by [[orogeny|crustal shortening]] in the [[Miocene|Late Miocene]].&lt;ref name="docs.google.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Hoke, Kennan, Dewey. 1996. [http://www.tectonicanalysis.net/site/download/Lamb97_Central_Andes_Evolution.pdf Cenozoic evolution of the Central Andes in Bolivia and northern Chile].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bolivian Altiplano hosts the world's largest reserves of [[lithium]]. These reserves are in the salt-saturated waters of [[Salar de Uyuni]] and [[Coipasa Lake|Salar de Coipasa]], neither of which are currently being commercially exploited for lithium. Salt is extracted from the saltars in minor amounts to be sold as [[table salt]] after being added [[iodine]] from [[Chile]].

===Eastern Cordillera===
{{see also|Bolivian tin belt}}
[[File:Valle de la Luna - La Paz - Bolivia.jpg|thumb|[[Erosion]] landscapes like [[Valle de la Luna (Bolivia)|Valle de la Luna]] near [[La Paz]] are common in the Central Cordillera and the Sub-Andean Zone]]
Cordillera Oriental is made up of a bended arc of plutons. The bend occurs at the latitude of [[Cochabamba]] and corresponds to eastward projection of the [[Orocline|Arica elbow]], the bend of south Amicas coastline at the Peru-Chile border. North of the bend Cordillera Centrals [[batholith]]s are northwest-southeast oriented while south of it they are north-south oriented.&lt;ref&gt;Hydrothermal Processes and Mineral Systems. Pages 376–381.&lt;/ref&gt; These bodies of [[granite|granitic]] to [[granodiorite|granodioritic]] composition were formed in two episodes: the Early [[Mesozoic]] (199–180 [[million years ago|Ma]]) and the [[Neogene]] (19–8 Ma). The emplacement of these [[pluton (geology)|igneous bodies]] have been interpreted as an effect of two temporary decreases in [[subduction|subduction angle]]s  of the ancient [[Farallon Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandra L. McBride, Ronald C. R. Robertson, Alan H. Clark and Edward Farrar. 1983.[http://www.springerlink.com/content/g3384623363606qj/fulltext.pdf Magmatie and Metallogenetie Episodes in the Northern Tin Belt, Cordillera Real, Bolivia]. Geologische Rundschau. Vol. 72. 
&lt;/ref&gt; This arc of magmatic material hosts Bolivia's widely known [[tin]] belt as well as the famous [[silver]] mine of [[Potosí]]. These mineralizations are of the [[Porphyritic|porphyry]] [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]] type that are typical for [[Convergent boundary|convergent plate margins]]. The [[Cordillera Real (Bolivia)|Cordillera Real]] form the northern, highly uplifted and eroded, part of the Central Cordillera.

==Lowlands and Sub-Andean zone==
{{see also|Andean Foreland Basin}}
[[File:Coroico.jpg|thumb|To reach the lowlands north of [[La Paz]] the [[Yungas]]-vegetated [[Cordillera Oriental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Oriental]] has to be passed.]]
The Sub-Andean Zone and the Northern and Eastern Lowlands share a common ancient history but has since the Andean orogeny developed to two distinct zones. While both zones share essentially the same old [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] [[platform (geology)|platform]] [[strata]] the strata at the Sub-Andean Zone have been folded and thrusted into a [[fold and thrust belt]] with [[structural trap]]s where [[hydrocarbon]] fluids have accumulated. The limit between the fold and thrust belt and the Eastern Lowlands is drawn by the [[Serranía del Aguaragüe]] a north-south range representing the Andean [[fold and thrust belt|thrust front]].

===Fold and thrust belt===
The relatively low [[Cordillera Oriental (Bolivia)|Cordillera Oriental]], located east of [[Cordillera Central (Bolivia)|Cordillera Central]], are part of a [[fold and thrust belt]] and exposes [[Silurian]] and [[Ordovician]] age [[strata (geology)|strata]] some of which are [[fossil]]-bearing. The fold and thrust makes up the framework of the [[catchment basin|hydrographic network]] of [[Pilcomayo River|Pilcomayo]] and other rivers. Currently one of Bolivia's most [[seismicity|seismic]] zones is the [[Cochabamba Fault Zone]] located just below the city of [[Cochabamba]] and its fertile valley. This fault zone is related to the [[Arica]] elbow and the bend in the Andes at this latitude.

===Eastern Lowlands===
The geology of the eastern lowlands is dominated by the ancient [[Paleozoic]] sedimentary [[Gran Chaco|Chaco]]–[[Tarija Department|Tarija]] Basin that has considerable [[Petroleum reservoir|hydrocarbon reserve]]s. During the [[Carboniferous]], the Chaco-Tarija Basin was  covered by thick [[sequence (geology)|sequence]]s that included [[sandstone]] filled channels.&lt;ref name=B175&gt;{{cite book|author1=A. J.

===Northern Lowlands===
{{see also|Ucayali Peneplain}}
The Northern Lowlands are and have long been a [[deposition (geology)|depositional]] milleau are mostly covered by Tertiary and Quaternary deposits. The bulk of these deposits are now [[laterite]]s. River [[erosion]] and [[sediment transport]] have created a large number of [[oxbow lake]]s and added copious [[meander]]s to the rivers.

==Guaporé Shield==

In the north and east of [[Santa Cruz Department (Bolivia)|Santa Cruz Department]] the crystalline and [[Precambrian]] Guaporé Shield (also called Central Brazil Shield)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926881900279|title=The proterozoic history of eastern Bolivia|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=15|issue=2|pages=157|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(81)90027-9|year=1981|last1=Litherland|first1=M|last2=Bloomfield|first2=K}}&lt;/ref&gt; makes up most of the [[bedrock]] but is mostly covered by [[Tertiary]] [[laterite]]s  and [[Quaternary]] [[alluvium|alluvial]] basins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osvaldoarce.com/summary.html METALLIFEROUS ORE DEPOSITS OF BOLIVIA]&lt;/ref&gt; The shield expresses itself topographically as a large elevated [[hinterland]] located north of [[Serranías Chiquitanas]] towards the Brazilian border. High-grade metamorphic rocks occur in the Bolivian part of the Guaporé Shield partly due to the 2000 millions years old "Trans-Amazonian tectonothermal event" that affected parts of South America. Low-grade metamorphic rocks occur as well. The Guaporé Shield is believed to extend beneath the [[Phanerozoic]] Tarija-Chaco and [[Beni River|Beni Basin]] sediments into the Andes. It has been suggested that weaknesses in the shield were responsible for the formation of the [[Andes#Geology|Arica Elbow]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The East-West Río Mercedes Line in the Guaporé Shield hosts several [[Proterozoic]] [[diabase]] [[intrusion]]s. As of 1985 the rocks of Guaporé Shield were considered to be poorly known.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0301926885900762|title=The southern border of the Guaporé Shield in western Brazil and Bolivia: An interpretation of its geologic evolution|journal=Precambrian Research|volume=28|issue=2|pages=111|doi=10.1016/0301-9268(85)90076-2|year=1985|last1=Jones|first1=J.P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the Brazilian border the iron deposit of [[El Mutún]] stands out as the world's largest [[iron ore]] deposit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mindat.org/loc-65228.html|title=Serrania Mutun, Chiquitos Province, Santa Cruz Department,  Bolivia |publisher=mindat.org |accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the Serranía de El Mutún, also called Cerro Mutún or Serranía de Jacadigo in Brazil. The shield also underlies Serrania Caparuch or Huanchaca which is the inspiration for the ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|Lost World]]'' of [[Conan Doyle]].&lt;ref&gt;The geologic and geomorphic evolution of Serrania Huanchaca, eastern Bolivia: the legendary 'Lost World'.

The '''Gippsland Lakes''' are a network of lakes, marshes and lagoons in east [[Gippsland]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]] covering an area of about {{convert|354|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gippsland Lakes - Australian Ramsar site no. 21|url = http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/wetlands/ramsardetails.pl?refcode=21#|website = www.environment.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest of the lakes are '''Lake Wellington''' ([[Gunai language]]: Murla&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chaosfilter.com/wurruk/index.htm Wurruk: by Vaughan Nikitin, ChaosFilter.com Online Publishing, A Story Written in an Aboriginal Ganai - Kurnai - Language - Mountain Cattlemen - Victoria - Gippsland - Aboriginal History, Myth, Legend&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), '''Lake King''' and '''Lake Victoria'''.  The lakes are collectively fed by the [[Avon River (Eastern Victoria)|Avon]], [[Thomson River, Victoria|Thomson]], [[Latrobe River|Latrobe]], [[Mitchell River, Victoria|Mitchell]], [[Nicholson River (Victoria)|Nicholson]] and [[Tambo River (Victoria)|Tambo]] rivers.

==History==
The Gippsland Lakes were formed by two principal processes. The first is [[river delta]] [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposition of sediment brought in by the rivers which flow into the lakes. {{cn|date=October 2017}} Silt deposited by this process forms into long jetties which can run many kilometres into a lake, as exemplified by the [[Mitchell River silt jetties]] that run into Lake King. The second process is the [[Bar (landform)#Sandbars and longshore bars|action of sea current in Bass Strait]] which created the [[Ninety Mile Beach, Victoria|Ninety Mile Beach]] and cut off the river deltas from the sea.

Once the lakes were closed off a new cycle started, whereby the water level of the lakes would gradually rise until the waters broke through the [[Ninety Mile Beach, Victoria|barrier beach]] and the level would drop down until it equalised with sea-level. {{cn|date=October 2017}} Eventually the beach would close-off the lakes and the cycle would begin anew. Sometimes it would take many years before a new channel to the sea was formed and not necessarily in the same place as the last one.

In 1889, a wall was built to fix the position of a naturally occurring channel between the lakes and the ocean at [[Lakes Entrance]], to stabilise the water level, create a harbour for fishing boats and open up the lakes to shipping. This entrance needs to be dredged regularly, or the same process that created the Gippsland Lakes would render the entrance too shallow for seagoing vessels to pass through.

Due to flooding in 2011, Gippsland Lakes experienced blooms of bioluminescent [[Noctiluca scintillans]].&lt;ref&gt;http://philhart.com/content/bioluminescence-gippsland-lakes&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tourism ==
The Gippsland Lakes provide a major hub for tourism, particularly for recreational boating and fishing enthusiasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The economic value of boating and marine industries associated with the use of Gippsland Lakes|url = http://www.gippslandports.vic.gov.au/pdfs/reports/gippslandport_34.pdf|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150309063319/http://www.gippslandports.vic.gov.au/pdfs/reports/gippslandport_34.pdf|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 9 March 2015|website = www.gippslandports.vic.gov.au|accessdate = 15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lakes network can be explored by cruise, water taxi, or boat and kayak hire. On the fringes of the lakes are several tourist towns that swell to support the tourist trade, particularly in the summer months.

[[Lakes Entrance, Victoria|Lakes Entrance]] is the largest of the towns on the lakes with a population of 4,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lakes Entrance Population (VIC)|url = http://lakes-entrance.localstats.com.au/population/vic/south-eastern-victoria/lakes-wilderness/lakes-entrance|website = lakes-entrance.localstats.com.au|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town is well serviced with resorts, hotels and facilities. It is located with easy access to both the lakes network and the surf beach on [[Ninety Mile Beach, Victoria|Ninety Mile Beach]], which is patrolled each summer.

[[Metung]] is a small village located on the tip of a peninsula sitting in the Gippsland Lakes, surrounded almost completely by water. It is an upmarket {{cn|date=October 2017}} tourist destination with many dining options and artisan galleries.

Much of [[Paynesville, Victoria|Paynesville]]’s accommodation and infrastructure are located on the network of canals. One of the key attractions is [[Raymond Island]], known for its koala population.

The diversity of the brine waters of the lakes, surf beaches along Ninety Mile Beach and fresh water streams that feed the lakes, make the Gippsland Lakes a popular fishing destination. Local fish varieties include bream, mullet, flathead, luderick and trevally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Lake fishing, Gippsland, Victoria, Australia|url = http://www.visitvictoria.com/Regions/Gippsland/Things-to-do/Outdoor-activities/Fishing/Lake-fishing|website = Tourism Victoria home|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paynesville, Lakes Entrance and Metung all offer a number of jetties, boat ramps and berthing facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Corner Inlet, Anderson Inlet, Slipways, Boatyards, Port Authority|url = http://www.gippslandports.vic.gov.au/gippsland_lakes_boating.php|website = www.gippslandports.vic.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environment==
The lakes support numerous species of wildlife and there exist two protected areas within: [[The Lakes National Park]] and Gippsland Lakes Coastal Park. The Gippsland Lakes wetlands are protected by the international [[Ramsar Convention]] on wetlands. There are also approximately 400 indigenous flora species and 300 native fauna species. Three plants, two of them being [[orchid]] species, are listed as endangered. The numbers of [[southern right whale]]s and [[humpback whale]]s using the Lake Entrance area show increases in recent years, as the populations have started to recover from illegal hunts by the Soviet Union with help from Japan in 1960s-1970s.

===Burrunan dolphins===
The lakes are home to about 50 of the recently described species of [[bottlenose dolphin]], the [[Burrunan dolphin]] (''Tursiops australis''). The other 150 or so of this rare species are to be found in [[Port Phillip]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monash.edu.au/news/show/researcher-discovers-new-dolphin-species-in-victoria Researcher discovers new dolphin species in Victoria], Monash University, 15 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birds===
The wetlands provide habitat for about 20,000 waterbirds – including birds from as far afield as [[Siberia]] and [[Alaska]]. The lakes have been identified by [[BirdLife International]] as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) because they regularly support over 1% of the global populations of [[black swan]]s, [[chestnut teal]]s and [[musk duck]]s, as well as many [[fairy tern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |title=IBA: Gippsland Lakes |accessdate=2011-06-24 |work=Birdata |first= |last= |publisher=Birds Australia |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706102341/http://www.birdata.com.au/iba.vm |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Greater Sunda Islands''' are a group of four large [[island]]s within the [[Malay Archipelago]]. They are wholly or partly included in present-day Indonesia: [[Java]], smallest but by far the most populous; [[Sumatra]] in the west, directly across the [[Strait of Malacca]] from Malaysia; large [[Borneo]], the Indonesian sector of which is called [[Kalimantan]]; and wishbone-shaped, distended [[Sulawesi]] (formerly Celebes) to the east.&lt;ref&gt;Blij, H. J., &amp; Muller, P. O. (2010). ''Geography: Realms, Regions, and Concepts'' (14th ed.). Hoboken, NJ: J. Wiley &amp; Sons. {{ISBN|0-470-46242-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under some definitions, only Java, Sumatra and Borneo are included in the Greater Sunda Islands.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, John &amp; Phillipps, Karen (1993). ''A Field Guide to the Birds of Borneo, Sumatra, Java, and Bali : the Greater Sunda Islands,'' Oxford University Press, Oxford ; New York. {{ISBN|0198540345}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Raymond (1935). ''The Ethnology of the Greater Sunda Islands'', Ph.D. dissertation, Yale University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], they make up the [[Sunda Islands]].

== Administration ==
The Greater Sunda islands are mostly territory of [[Indonesia]]. However, the island of Borneo is divided among the countries of [[Brunei]], Indonesia, and [[Malaysia]]. It contains all of Brunei, the Indonesian provinces of [[Central Kalimantan|Central]], [[East Kalimantan|East]], [[West Kalimantan|West]], [[North Kalimantan|North]], and [[South Kalimantan]], and the Malaysian states of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] and the federal territory of [[Labuan]].

==Horticultural botanists==
Professional horticultural [[botanist]]s are employed by [[botanical garden]]s, large [[Plant nursery|plant nurseries]], university departments, and government agencies. The activities vary according to the mission goals and priorities of the institutions. 
:Duties can include: 
*searching for new plants suitable for cultivation (''plant hunting''), 
*communicating with and advising the general public on matters concerning the classification and [[botanical nomenclature]] of cultivated plants, 
*carrying out original research on these topics: 
**describing the cultivated plants and their history of particular regions in [[horticultural flora]]s,  
**recording new plant introductions; 
*maintaining [[database]]s of cultivated plants; 
*curating horticultural [[herbarium|herbaria]], including collections of dried specimens and images; 
*contributing to the ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants]]''. 

==Taxonomy of cultivated plants==
Perhaps the single major concern of horticultural botanists has been the [[taxonomy of cultivated plants]] and so, at the present time, many horticultural botanists will be members if the ''International Association of Cultivated Plant Taxonomy'' which was established in 2007.

'''James Croll, [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], ''' (2 January 1821 – 15 December 1890) was a 19th-century Scottish scientist who developed a theory of [[climate change]] based on changes in the Earth's [[planetary orbit|orbit]].

==Life==

James Croll was born in 1821 on the farm of Little Whitefield, near [[Wolfhill]] in [[Perthshire]], Scotland, the son of David Croll, mason, and his wife Janet Geddes.
([[British national grid reference system|NO1733]]). He was largely self-educated.  At 16 he became an apprentice [[wheelwright]] at Collace near Wolfhill, and then because of health problems a tea merchant in [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], Moray.  
In 1848 he married Isabella Macdonald, daughter of John Macdonald and Annabella Sime, of Forres. {{sfn|Bonney|1901}}

In the 1850s he managed a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] hotel in [[Blairgowrie and Rattray|Blairgowrie]], and was then an insurance agent in [[Glasgow]], Edinburgh and [[Leicester]].  
In 1859, he became a [[janitor]] at the museum of the [[University of Strathclyde|Andersonian University]] in Glasgow. He was able to use the university library to get access to books, and taught himself [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] to develop his ideas.{{sfn|Bonney|1901}}

From 1864, Croll corresponded with Sir [[Charles Lyell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; on links between ice ages and variations in the Earth's orbit.  
He theorized that changes in the earth's orbit could cause the [[Gulf stream]] to be diverted, bringing less heat to the [[Arctic]]. More ice would then lead to more sunlight being reflected, causing a feedback loop. His ideas were published in the [[Philosophical Magazine]] in 1864, attributed to "James Croll, Anderson's University".&lt;ref name=Pearce&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fred Pearce |title=Caretaker who solved the ice age mystery |journal=New Scientist |date=Aug 25, 2018 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23931920-700-how-a-janitor-wowed-darwin-by-solving-the-ice-age-mystery/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This led to a position in the Edinburgh office of the [[British Geological Survey|Geological Survey of Scotland]], as keeper of maps and correspondence, where the director, Sir [[Archibald Geikie]], encouraged his research.  
He published a number of books and papers which "were at the forefront of contemporary science",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1876, he was elected Fellow of the [[Royal Society]], and awarded an honorary degree by the [[University of St Andrews]].  He retired in 1880 because of ill health, and died on 15 December 1890 at 5 Pitcullen Crescent, [[Perth, Scotland]]. He was buried in a family grave in [[Cargill, Perthshire]].&lt;ref name=Pearce/&gt;

==Theory of ice ages==
{{refimprove-section|date=July 2016}}
Croll was the leading proponent of an astronomical-based theory of climate change in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=James Croll in Context: The Encounter between Climate Dynamics and Geology in the Second Half of the Nineteenth Century|year=2006|author=James Rodger Fleming|url=http://www.meteohistory.org/2006historyofmeteorology3/3fleming_croll.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using formulae for orbital variations developed by [[Urbain Le Verrier]] (which had led to the discovery of [[Neptune]]), Croll developed a theory of the effects of variations of the Earth's orbit on climate cycles. His idea was that decreases in winter sunlight would favour snow accumulation, and for the first time coupled this to the idea of a positive [[albedo|ice-albedo]] feedback to amplify the [[solar variation]]s. Croll further argued that the accumulation of snow would change the pattern of trade winds, leading to the deflection of warming currents like the Gulf Stream, and finally a self-sustaining ice age. He suggested that when [[eccentricity (orbit)|orbital eccentricity]] is high winters will tend to be colder when the Earth is farther from the sun in that season and hence, that during periods of high orbital eccentricity, ice ages occur on 22,000-year cycles in each hemisphere, and alternate between southern and northern hemispheres, lasting approximately 10,000 years each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Iain Stewart (geologist)|Iain Stewart]]|date=3 March 2012|title= Men of Rock|medium=Motion Picture|language=English|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00wvjnq|access-date=16 October 2017|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croll's theory predicted multiple ice ages, asynchronous in northern and southern hemispheres, and that the last [[ice age]]s should have ended about 80,000 years ago. Evidence was just then emerging of multiple ice ages, and geologists were interested in a theory to explain this. Geologists were not then able to date sediments accurately enough to determine if [[glaciation]] was synchronous between the hemispheres, though the limited evidence more pointed towards synchronicity than not. More crucially, estimates of the recession rate of the [[Niagara Falls]] indicated that the last ice age ended 6,000 to 35,000 years ago – a large range, but enough to rule out Croll's theory, to those who accepted the measurements.

Croll's work was widely discussed, but by the end of the 19th century, his theory was generally discredited. However, the basic idea of orbitally-forced insolation variations influencing terrestrial temperatures – now known generally as [[Milankovitch cycles]] – was further developed by [[Milutin Milankovitch]] and eventually, in modified form, triumphed in 1976.

Due to the shrinkage of the glacier surrounding the southern peak, it is possible the northern peak will assume the title of the highest point in Sweden; as of Summer 2016 the difference in altitude was just {{convert|30|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Turlua | first = Tom | name-list-format = vanc | title = Sweden's highest mountain peak is melting so fast that it's inches away from becoming the second-highest. | work = Business Insider | date = August 24, 2017 | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/swedens-highest-mountain-peak-is-melting-fast-2017-8 | access-date = August 24, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By August of 2018, because of [[2018_European_drought_and_heat_waves#Sweden|record heat]], enough of the glacier on the southern peak had melted so that the northern peak is now the highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Christina | last = Anderson | name-list-format = vanc | title = Sweden’s Tallest Peak Shrinks in Record Heat | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/world/europe/sweden-kebnekaise-heat-wave.html | work = The New York Times | date = 2 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However it is likely the height of the southern peak will increase in the winter so that it may regain its title as the highest peak.

==Geography==
The Kebnekaise massif lies within a range of the Scandinavian mountains that is bordered by the [[glacial valley]]s [[Ladtjovagge]] (Sami spelling Láddjuvággi), Tjäktjavagge (Čeakčavággi) and Vistasvagge (Visttasvággi). The highest points of the massif lie along the ridge (called "vargryggen" in Swedish) that runs from the southern and northern summits to Kebnepakte (Giebmebákti) at {{convert|1990|m}}. Other subsidiary peaks are Kebnetjåkka (Giebmečohkka), [[Vierranvárri]], Tolpagorni {{convert|1662|m}} , Guobircohkka {{convert|1506|m}}, and [[Siŋŋibákti]] {{convert|1614|m}}.

Of the two highest points, the southern peak lies on a glacier situated on a rocky plateau. The glacier has shrunk in recent years, and therefore the summit is not as high as earlier. The top is traditionally said to be {{convert|2,111|m}}, and higher in the oldest measurement, i.e. {{convert|2,117|m}}. If the melting continues at the same rate, the south peak will sink below the north peak (which is the highest ''fixed'' point in Sweden) within a few years' time.&lt;ref&gt;Malin Olofsson, [http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=1422159 "Toppskifte på Kebnekaise"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235321/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=1422159 |date=2007-09-30 }}, [[Sveriges Radio]], 15 June 2007, retrieved 27 March 2012 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjallklubben.org/fjallet/artiklar/4-04art2.htm Kebnekaises sydtopp – högst i Sverige?], fjallklubben.org (broken link)&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of July 2015, [[Tarfala Research Station]] reports that the glacier has grown by {{convert|4.5|to|2102|m}} — from its lowest measurement of {{convert|2097.5|m}} the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Emil Östlund, [http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=83&amp;artikel=6218190 "Sydtoppen växer på Kebnekaise"], [[Sveriges Radio]] 23 July 2015, retrieved 27 October 2015 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The massif is heavily [[glacier|glaciated]], with [[Kebnepakteglaciären]], [[Isfallsglaciären]], and [[Storglaciären]] towards [[Tarfala|Tarfala valley]] to the east, [[Björlings glacier]] to the southeast, and [[Rabots glaciär]] to the west, plus several smaller glaciers throughout the area.

In Europe there are no higher mountains further north. During clear weather, a vast area can be seen from the summit, according to some sources as much as 10% of Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenoffroad.com/old/sv/reportage/rekordresa.html|title=Reportage|work=swedenoffroad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climbing routes==
[[Kebnekaise mountain lodge]] (''Kebnekaise fjällstation'') is located to the southeast at the foot of Kebnekaise, about {{convert|19|km}}, 6–7&amp;nbsp;hours hike from the trailhead at [[Nikkaluokta]]. It is the starting point for an ascent to the south summit via the western route (''västra leden'', about {{convert|18|km}}, 5-7&amp;nbsp;hours to the summit) or the eastern route (''östra leden'', about {{convert|10|km}}, 3–5&amp;nbsp;hours to the summit). The western route leads over steep scree slopes and the intermediate peak [[Vierranvárri]]. Most of this route to the top is pure hiking, but there is a short exposed part that could possibly count as [[scrambling]] ([[Yosemite Decimal System|YDS]] grade 2). The eastern route leads over glaciers and rocks and offers exposure ([[Yosemite Decimal System|YDS]] grade 4). The steepest section is equipped with fixed steel cables for protection, similar to a [[via ferrata]]. There is also a third, less known route only marked with [[cairn]]s — "Durlings led", which branches off [[Kungsleden]] a few kilometers north of Singi, goes about two kilometers into Singivagge, and then turns north into the valley between Kuopertjåkka and Siŋŋibákti. "Durlings led" eventually merges with the western route at "Kaffedalen", the pass between [[Vierranvárri]] and Kebnekaise. Advantages with this route are lack of exposure and a shorter ascent if Singivagge is used for an overnight camp.

Just below the top plateau one encounters an old smaller cabin at {{convert|1880|m}} altitude. A cabin up on the plateau was opened in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedishlaplandvisitorsboard.com/blog/2016/09/05/ny-toppstuga-pa-kebnekaise-giebmegaisi-invigs-i-mitten-av-september/|title=Ny toppstuga på Kebnekaise}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large cabin used to stand below the plateau, near the smaller one, until September 2018, when it was demolished by the county administration due to being too worn. The new cabin up on the plateau is intended as a replacement.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsd.se/nyheter/kebnekaises-toppstuga-nedbrand-nm4910866.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The peak glacier is a small top, merely tens of meters high, on a rocky plateau. To approach the actual mountain top on the glacier, [[crampons]] or other means of enhancing traction may be required, depending on snow conditions. The glacier should be walked upon with great caution; fatal accidents have occurred with people sliding off into the huge void on the eastern side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article7275527.ab|title=Fjällvandrare föll 400 meter|work=Aftonbladet}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This danger might not always be apparent, especially not in times of bad weather and visibility.

Routes to the northern summit, including one via the narrow, icy [[arête]] from the southern summit, require mountaineering equipment and skills.

Due to the harsh [[subarctic climate]] at the location, Kebnekaise sees the vast majority of climbers during the summer months (late June to early September). However, Kebnekaise is also an established destination for winter alpinism and guided skiing tours are organised by the STF lodge's guides.

==Norwegian plane crash==
{{main|2012 Norwegian C-130 crash}}

On 15 March 2012 a [[Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules]] military aircraft crashed into the western snowy mountain side a short distance below the ridge that runs between the mountain's two highest peaks. Five Norwegian officers were killed.

'''Langtang''' is a region in the [[Himalayas]] of [[Nepal]] to the north of the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and bordering [[Tibet]].

The [[Langtang National Park]] is located in the area.
About 4,500 people live inside the park, and many more depend on it for timber and firewood. The majority of the residents are [[Tamang]].

The park contains a wide variety of climatic zones, from subtropical to alpine. Approximately 25% of the park is forested. Trees include the deciduous [[oak]] and [[maple]], and evergreens like [[pine]], and various types of [[rhododendron]]. Animal life includes [[Asiatic black bear|Himalayan black bear]], the goat-like [[Himalayan tahr]], [[rhesus macaque|rhesus monkeys]] and [[red panda]]s. There are also stories of [[Yeti]] sightings.

The park contains the [[Gosainkunda]] lakes, sacred to [[Hindu]]s. Pilgrimages are made there in August. Another spiritual site is the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] monastery [[Kyanjin Gompa]].

Popular activities for tourists in the park include trekking, [[mountain climbing|climbing]], and [[rafting|white-water rafting]].

[[Langtang, Bagmati|Langtang village]] has been completely swiped away by a massive [[avalanche]] followed by the [[May 2015 Nepal earthquake|earthquake in April 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/may/17/nepal-earthquake-langtang-village-everyone-was-dead|title=Nepal earthquake: the village wiped off the map in a few terrifying seconds|last=Cadwalladr|first=Carole|date=May 16, 2015|publisher=The Guardian|language=English|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The village suffered an estimated 310 deaths, including 176 Langtang residents, 80 foreigners, and 10 army personnel. More than 100 bodies were never recovered.

'''Lawn ornaments''' are decorative objects placed in the [[grass]]y area of a property.

== Common lawn ornaments ==
'''Animal forms''': Animal statues such as frogs, turtles, rabbits, and ducks are cast in plastic or cement.

'''[[Bathtub Madonna]]''': A statue of Mary the mother of Jesus is placed in a bathtub half buried under the ground. Statues of Mary are most often made of white concrete, but are sometimes painted with a blue garment.

'''[[Bird bath]]''': A structure designed to hold water for birds to bathe in or drink, generally supported upon a pedestal, is known as a bird bath.

'''[[Bird feeder]]''': A container for foods such as bird seeds is often designed to look like a miniature house or barn, and may be mounted on a stake, post, or column.

'''[[Found object]] art''': Items such as [[bowling ball]]s, [[toilet]] planters, and antique [[farm equipment]] may be repurposed as lawn ornaments.

'''[[Francis of Assisi]]''': A saint often associated with nature and animals may be cast in plaster or cement.

'''[[Garden gnome]]''': A small, generally colorful gnome statuette.

'''Human form''': A depiction of a human being. Human form lawn ornaments can be two-dimensional, generally vertically supported by being thrust in the ground, or three-dimensional. Examples of human form lawn ornaments include the [[Concrete Aboriginal]], lawn jockey and groomsman. Examples of two-dimensional human form lawn ornaments include renditions of Amish and Pennsylvania Dutch people. A variation of the Pennsylvania Dutch human form is a depiction of an older female bending over as in gardening, thus revealing her undergarments.

'''Jigglers''': Plastic or metal flowers, birds and insects fitted on spring-loaded stakes so that they jiggle when the wind blows on them.

'''[[Lawn jockey]]''', or '''Jocko''', or '''Groomsmen''': an often diminutive statuette of a black horse attendant dressed in slave clothing, also called a '''Jocko'''. Groomsmen were often used as hitching posts. The origin of the groomsman is disputed, but it is accepted that they originated in the U.S. South. No longer as common since the civil rights movement. The "Cavalier" variation typically depicts a [[white people|white]] figure. One legend has it that the first Groomsman was created at the commission of [[George Washington]].

'''[[Lighthouse]]s''': Small-scale representations of local lighthouses are popular in coastal areas.

'''[[Nest box]]/bird house''': A small house for a bird normally made of wood and on a stake.

'''[[Plastic flamingo]]''': A generally lifesize replica of a pink [[flamingo]]. According to some, the origin of the plastic flamingo was in 1946 with the company Union Products in its "Plastics for the Lawn" product line. Their collection included dog, ducks, frogs, and a flamingo.

'''Spinners''': Usually shaped like flowers with petals that spin in the wind. Variations include birds or insects with spinning wings.

'''[[Statuary]]''' and '''outdoor sculpture'''

'''[[Topiary]] specimens'''

'''[[Whirligig]]''': An often animalistic sculpture generally supported vertically by being pushed in the ground characterized by at least one rotating member often designed to appear as a bodypart of the sculpture.

'''[[Windmill]]''': A disconnected but free-spinning miniature, typically in the American Aermotor style having about a dozen metal vanes, or the traditional Dutch style having four wood vanes.

'''[[Yard globe]]''': A light-reflective sphere, as large as 16" in diameter and generally displayed on top of a support structure. Also called '''gazing globes''' or '''gazing balls'''.

| footer    = An example of the [[coastline paradox]]. If the coastline of Britain is measured using a scale interval of 200 km (left), then the length of the coastline is about 2400 km. Using a scale interval of 50 km (right), the length of the coastline is about 3400 km.

==Overview==
The [[coastline paradox]] states that a coastline does not have a well-defined length. Measurements of the [[How Long Is the Coast of Britain? Statistical Self-Similarity and Fractional Dimension|length of a coastline]] behave like a [[fractal]], being different at different scale intervals (distance between points on the coastline at which measurements are taken). The smaller the scale interval (meaning the more detailed the measurement), the longer the coastline will be.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;The smaller the scale interval mathematically, the more detailed and the "greater the scale of the map", in common usage. See [[scale (map)]].&lt;/ref&gt; This "magnifying" effect is greater for convoluted coastlines than for relatively smooth ones. Treated as fractals, coastlines can however be measured. For example, the coast of Great Britain has a size of about 28000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;1.43&lt;/sup&gt;, which is called its [[Hausdorff measure]].&lt;ref&gt;Measuring the Size of Britains Coast (German): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/62/K%C3%BCstenl%C3%A4nge_Gro%C3%9Fbritanniens.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Data marked [[The World Factbook]] or TWF covers 198 countries and 55 territories, from the book published by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. In addition to coastline lengths, this is the source of the land area used to calculate the "coast/area ratio" for both TWF and WRI (see below) coastline measurement.  This ratio measures how many [[meter]]s of coastline correspond to every square kilometer of land area. The ratio illustrates the ease of accessibility to the country's coast from every point in its interior. Therefore, an [[list of island nations|island country]] like [[Maldives]], or a country carved by the sea like [[Greece]], is more likely to have a high ratio, while a landlocked country will have a ratio of zero. Note that the scales at which The World Factbook figures were measured are not stated, nor is it known whether the figures are all reported using the same scale, thus the figures are not necessarily comparable across different countries.
* Data marked [[World Resources Institute]] or WRI covers 182 independent countries and 13 dependencies, based on data calculated in 2000 from the World Vector Shoreline, [[Defense Mapping Agency|United States Defense Mapping Agency]], 1989. It may include territories whose status have changed. According to their technical notes, the "coastline length was derived from the World Vector Shoreline database at 1:250,000 scale. The estimates (...) were calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and an underlying database consistent for the entire world. The methodology used to estimate length is based on the following: 1) A country's coastline is made up of individual lines, and an individual line has two or more vertices and/or nodes. 2) The length between two vertices is calculated on the surface of a sphere. 3) The sum of the lengths of the pairs of vertices is aggregated for each individual line, and 4) the sum of the lengths of individual lines was aggregated for a country. In general, the coastline length of islands that are part of a country, but are not overseas territories, are included in the coastline estimate for that country (e.g., Canary Islands are included in Spain). Coastline length for overseas territories and dependencies are listed separately. Disputed areas are not included in country or regional totals."&lt;ref name="wri"/&gt;

* The [[Mediterranean Sea]] and all its tributary basins, during its [[Messinian salinity crisis|Messinian desiccation]] (5 [[Mya (unit)|mya]] approximately) as it became disconnected from the Atlantic Ocean.
* [[Ebro]] and [[Duero]] basins, draining most of northern [[Spain]] during the [[Neogene]] and perhaps [[Pliocene]].
* [[Lake Tanganyika]] in Africa. Currently at an overflow level and therefore draining into the sea via the [[Lukuga River]], but the lake level has been lower in the past, possibly as recently as 1800.
* [[Tularosa Basin]] and Lake Cabeza de Vaca in North America. Basin formerly much larger than at present, including the ancestral [[Rio Grande]] north of Texas, feeding a large lake area.

In the majority of nations, including all industrialised nations except the United States, advances in [[Labour law|employee relations]] have seen the introduction of statutory agreements for minimum [[Annual leave|employee leave from work]]—that is the amount of entitlement to paid vacation and public holidays. Several companies will offer contractually more time, depending on the sector. Companies and the law may also differ as to whether [[Lists of holidays|public holidays]] are counted as part of the minimum leave. Disparities in national minimums are still subject of debate regarding [[work-life balance]] and perceived differences between nations. These numbers usually refer to full-time employment, part-time workers may get a reduced number of days. In most countries, public holidays are paid and usually not considered part of the annual leave. Also, in most countries there are additional paid leave benefits such as [[parental leave]] and [[sick leave]] that are not listed here.

== Methodology ==
For the purpose of comparison, the paid vacation column has been normalised to a five-day workweek. For instance, a calendar day is divided by seven and multiplied by five, while a six-day workweek day is divided by six and multiplied by five. The paid vacation column gives the minimum mandatory vacation days for an employee who has one year of service with the same employer.

In some countries, the public holidays are strictly bound to the calendar dates, so if they happen on Saturday or Sunday, they are "lost" for the particular year. As a result, the average number of paid extra free days can be lower than the table specifies. For example, in the Czech Republic, where the official number of paid public holidays is 13, the average number of public holidays during working days in the years 2000–2016 was only 8.9 days. In other countries, the public holidays which happen on Saturday or Sunday are moved to the nearest Monday or Friday such as in the United Kingdom or the United States.

'''Isobel Moira Dunbar''' {{post-nominals|FRSC|OC}} (3 February 1918 – 22 November 1999) was a Scottish-Canadian [[glaciologist]] and [[Arctic]] ice researcher.

==Early life==
Moira Dunbar was born in 1918 in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]]. She grew up in [[Stornoway]], [[Strathpeffer]], and [[Kilmarnock]], and attended Cranley School for Girls.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12202896.display/|title=Moira Dunbar|date=11 December 1999|work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunbar studied [[geography]] at [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] of the [[University of Oxford]], completing her Bachelor of Arts in 1939.&lt;ref name=igsoc&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.igsoc.org/awards/honorary/j10j211.pdf|title=Women in glaciology, a historical perspective|journal=Journal of Glaciology|volume=56|issue=200|year=2010|first1=Christina L. |last1=Hulbe|first2=Weili|last2=Wang|first3=Simon |last3=Ommanney|pages=944–964|bibcode=2010JGlac..56..944H|doi=10.3189/002214311796406202}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War II, she travelled around the [[United Kingdom]] with a theatre troupe as an actor and stage manager.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

==Career==
Dunbar emigrated to [[Canada]] in 1947 and found work with the Joint Intelligence Bureau, where she studied Arctic ice movement. In 1952 she joined the [[Defence Research Board]] in the position of Scientific Staff Officer in the Arctic Research Section.&lt;ref name=igsoc/&gt;&lt;ref name=science&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=346|title=Moira Isobel Dunbar|date=22 June 2015|website=Science.ca|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She specialised in [[sea ice]] and navigation through frozen Arctic waters. In 1954, she applied to join the crew of scientists on a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] [[icebreaker]] travelling to the Arctic, but her request was denied as women could not be posted on naval vessels. She continued making requests until she was given permission to join an icebreaker with the [[Transport Canada|Department of Transport]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=igsoc/&gt; She thus became the first woman to conduct scientific research from Canadian icebreakers.&lt;ref name=rcgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/about/history/northern_exposure.asp|title= Northern exposure |first=Mary|last=Vincent|publisher=[[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She served on numerous icebreakers and spent 560 hours on [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] aircraft, studying ice formations in the High Arctic.&lt;ref name=igsoc/&gt; She was among the first women to fly over the [[North Pole]].&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;&lt;ref name=rcgs/&gt;

Dunbar published numerous papers on Arctic sea ice, and in 1956 she co-authored ''Arctic Canada from the Air'' with Keith Greenaway, a navigator with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]].&lt;ref name=science/&gt; Dunbar and Greenway's book was an early work in the field of observing sea ice through airborne photography. In her other papers, Dunbar studied the use of radar remote sensing in sea-ice research, promoted the standardisation of sea-ice terminology, and wrote historical accounts of [[Arctic exploration]].&lt;ref name=igsoc/&gt; She investigated icebreaking methods in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Finland]] in 1964, and was an adviser to Arctic [[hovercraft]] trials in 1966–1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/isobel-moira-dunbar/|title=Isobel Moira Dunbar|work=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|first=Diana|last=Rowley|date=10 June 2008|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Dunbar won the [[Meteorological Service of Canada|Meteorological Service of Canada's]] Centennial Award.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; In 1972 she was awarded the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society|Royal Canadian Geographical Society's]] [[Massey Medal]] for "her excellent work in arctic geography and sea ice";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rcgs.org/awards/massey_medal/previous_winners.asp|title=Massey Medal|publisher=[[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]]|accessdate=1 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; she is the only woman to have won the medal.&lt;ref name=rcgs/&gt; She was a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and was made an [[Officer of the Order of Canada]] in 1977.&lt;ref name=science/&gt; She also served as governor of the [[Arctic Institute of North America]] and director of the [[Royal Canadian Geographical Society]].&lt;ref name=herald/&gt;

Dunbar retired in 1978 and died on 22 November 1999, at the age of 81.&lt;ref name=science/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48736">'''Place-names in Normandy''' have a variety of origins.  Some belong to the common heritage of the [[Langue d'oïl]] extension zone in northern France and Belgium; this is called "Pre-Normanic".  Others contain [[Old Norse]] and [[Old English]] male names and toponymic appellatives. These intermingle with Romance male names and place-name elements to create a very specific [[superstratum]], typical of Normandy within the extension zone of the [[Langue d'oïl]]. These are sometimes called "Normanic".&lt;ref&gt;French ''normanique'' cf. RENAUD Jean, ''La toponymie normanique: Reflet d'une colonisation'' in FLAMBARD HÉRICHER Anne-Marie, ''La progression des Vikings, des raids à la colonisation'', Publications de l'Université de Rouen, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carte Duché Normandie.jpg|thumb|Normandy's main towns and cities. Four  have ''Normanic'' names: [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Honfleur]] and [[Barfleur]]. [[Harfleur]], which was an important port before [[le Havre]]'s foundation, can be added.]]

There are still a significant number of Celtic (Gaulish) names, as there are throughout France and western Europe. These names, partly mixed with Latin elements, follow the Late Latin phonetic changes that led to Langue d'oïl.

=== Traditional large cities ===
Almost all the main cities kept a Romanized Celtic name, that produced the modern toponym.

==== BC era ====
* [[Rouen]]: from the Gallo-Romance &lt;small&gt;ROTOMAGU&lt;/small&gt; (Latin ''Rotomagus''),&lt;ref&gt;Toponymic type that exists everywhere in France, for example [[Ruan, Loiret|Ruan]] (''Rothomago'' 1233 / ''Rotomagus'' 5th century), [[Rom, Deux-Sèvres|Rom]].&lt;/ref&gt; in turn from the Gaulish ''Ratumacos'' (sometimes ''Ratómagos'', on the coins of the ''[[Veliocassi]]'' tribe). The first part of the name might refer to ''roto-'', the word for "wheel" or "race", cf. Old Irish ''roth'' or Welsh ''rhod'' ("wheel" or "race"). The meaning of the second part, ''Magos'', is much clearer: "field", "plain", or later "market" cf. Old Irish ''mag'' (gen. ''maige''), meaning "field" or "plain"; Old Breton ''ma'', meaning "place". Taken together, the whole could mean "hippodrome", "racecourse", or "wheel market".&lt;ref&gt;Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', éditions errance 2003, p. 261 - 262.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Caen]]: probably ''*Catumagus'', from the Old Celtic ''catu-'', meaning "battle", "fight", or "combat"; or the Old Irish ''cath'' (gen. ''catho''), meaning "combat", "battalion", or "troop"; the Breton ''-kad'' /''-gad'' and the Welsh ''cad'', both meaning "combat" or "troop". As a whole, the name could mean "battlefield".
* [[Carentan]]: attested as ''Carentomagus''.&lt;ref&gt;Idem [[Charenton (disambiguation)|Charenton]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Vernon, Eure|Vernon]]: probably ''*Vernomagus'',&lt;ref&gt;There are other [[Vernon (disambiguation)|Vernon]] in France, but they come from ''Vernō'' 'place of the alder-trees'.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "plain of the alder-trees", derived from ''uernā'', meaning "alder-tree"; or, in Old Irish, ''fern''; and in Breton and Welsh, ''gwern''.

==== AD era ====

In the following examples, a Gaulish toponym was replaced by the name of the local tribe, according to a process well known in the later [[Roman Empire]]:

* [[Bayeux]]: rooted in the [[civitas]] named ''Bajocassensis''; which was formerly known as ''Augustodurum'', meaning "[[Forum (Roman)|forum]] dedicated to [[Augustus]]".
* [[Evreux]]: rooted in the civitas named ''Eburovicensis'', formerly known as ''Mediolanum''.
* [[Lisieux]]: rooted in the civitas named ''Lexoviensis'', formerly known as ''Noviomagus'',&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[Noviomagus (disambiguation)|Noviomagus]]'' and [[Lexovii]].&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "new market", from the Old Celtic ''noviios'', meaning "new".
* [[Avranches]]: rooted in the civitas named ''Abrincatii''; formerly known as ''Ingena'' or ''Legedia''.

There were exceptions to this practice, such as:

* [[Coutances]]: derived from ''Constantia'', meaning "dedicated to Emperor [[Constantius Chlorus]]".
* [[Lillebonne]]: derived from ''Juliobona'', where ''Julio'' meant "dedicated to [[Julius Caesar|Julius]]", and ''bona'', from the Old Celtic, meant "foundation" or "spring". (Also see ''[[Ratisbona]]'' or ''[[Vindobona]]'').

Some of these would disappear later, replaced by Normanic names; thus ''Coriovallum'' became [[Cherbourg]] and ''Caracotinum'' became [[Harfleur]].  Such changes indicate that the older inhabitants who used the earlier name were displaced by newcomers, either leaving completely or becoming a small minority.

Some cities' Pre-Normanic names are not known, such as [[Honfleur]] or [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]].

=== Common northern French toponymic types ===
The most common [[suffix]] in northern France is ''[[:fr:-acum|-acum]]'' (written ''-acum'', ''-acus'' or ''-aco'' in early [[Medieval Latin]] documents, but pronounced in vulgar Latin ''-acu''), that means "place of" or "property". Its origin is the Celtic ''-āko(n)''. Originally, it was used to as the location of either a god or a people. Examples include Anualonacu, meaning "sanctuary of Anualō [a god]" and nautae Parisiaci, meaning "sailors of the Parisii [tribe]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre-Yves Lambert]], ''La Langue gauloise'', édition errance 1994, p.39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern France and southern Belgium, ''–(i)acum'' became ''-ay, -ai, -ey, -é'' or ''-y''.  All of these variations are found in Normandy.  Places with this suffix include [[Gournay (disambiguation)|Gournay]], [[Bernay (disambiguation)|Bernay]], [[Cernay (disambiguation)|Cernay]], and Andilly.

Another, generally later, variation is composed of masculine names that can be either Gaulish or Latin, for example: [[Massy (disambiguation)|Massy]] from Gaulish ''Mascius''; [[Marcilly (disambiguation)|Marcilly]] from Roman ''Marcellus''; [[Fleury (disambiguation)|Fleury]] from Roman ''Florius''; and [[Montigny (disambiguation)|Montigny]] from Roman ''Montanius''.

However, the latest ''-acum'' formations are combined with a Christian or a Germanic masculine name, such as [[Repentigny, Calvados|Repentigny]], from the Christian name ''Repentin(i)us''. The most common ''-acum'' place-name in Normandy is [[Glatigny (disambiguation)|Glatigny]], of which more than 40 exist.

== Romance place-name elements ==
These come from the [[Vulgar Latin]], but began only about 100 years after [[Decline of the Roman Empire|the fall of the Roman Empire]], in the 6th century AD.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} In this province, it is sometimes difficult to know if these formations (''-ville, -val, -mont, -mesnil'', etc.) are Pre-Normanic or Normanic, due to similarities between the two.

The main romance appellatives are the following:

* ''-ville'' or ''Ville-'', meaning  "farm", and later "village"
* ''-court, Cour-'', or ''Cor-'', meaning "farm with a courtyard"
* ''-val'' or ''Val-'', meaning "small valley"
* ''-mont'' or ''Mont-'', meaning "hill"
* ''-mesnil'', ''-menil'' or ''Mesnil-'', meaning "property"

=== General description ===
In France, including Normandy, the extension of ''-court'', ''-ville'', and ''-mesnil'' (including its variant spellings ''-maisnil'' and ''-ménil'') corresponds generally to Frankish and other Germanic settlements.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} This is the most likely reason why the common word order is also from the Germanic: determinative (adjective, appellative or owner's name) plus determined (romance element).  Examples include: [[Neuville (disambiguation)|Neuville]], meaning "new village"; [[Bourville]] (''Bodardi villa'', 8th century) meaning "Bodard's farm"; [[Harcourt (disambiguation)|Harcourt]] (''Herolcurt'', 11th century) meaning "Herulf's farm"; and [[Carville-Pot-de-Fer|Attemesnil]] (''Ademesnil'', 13th century) meaning "Adda's property".&lt;ref&gt;François de Beaurepaire, ''Les noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de l'Eure'', éditions Picard 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than one-third of France, the north, makes use of the Germanic ordering.

In Vulgar Latin, as in Celtic, the opposite word order prevailed: determined (Romance appellative) plus determinative (adjective).  This order dominates in [[Occitan]] toponymy, as well as in western France.&lt;ref&gt;François de Beaurepaire, ''op. mentioned''.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of Neuville, in the south we find [[Villeneuve (disambiguation)|Villeneuve]], derived either from Occitan, ''Vielanova'', or from a more modern name.

Similarly, northern [[Neuchâtel (disambiguation)|Neuchâtel]], [[Neufchâtel (disambiguation)|Neufchâtel]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Neufchâtel-en-Bray]] is a former Neufcastel 13th century → 15th century, with the Old Norman spelling of the word  "castle": ''castel'', that gave birth to the Mod. Norman ''câtel'' (sometimes written ''catel''). For instance: Old Norman [[Castel, Guernsey]], known in Modern Norman as Sainte-Marie-du-Câtel ([[Guernsey]]), le Câtel ([[Jersey]]), [[:fr:Manoir du Catel|Manoir du Catel]] (Pays de Caux), [[Radicatel]] (Pays de Caux), etc. corresponding to French ''château''. There are many derived words such as [[Le Catelier]], etc.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Neufchâteau (disambiguation)|Neufchâteau]], meaning "new castle", corresponding to southern [[Châteauneuf (disambiguation)|Châteauneuf]] or [[Châtelneuf (disambiguation)|Châtelneuf]], a translation of [[Castelnau (disambiguation)|Castelnau]] in Occitan.&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The local specificity ===
In the Norman toponymy, the most widespread appellative is ''-ville'' or ''Ville-'', with an estimated 20% of the [[French communes]] of Normandy containing this appellative.  The oldest recorded instance is [[Bourville]], as ''Bodardi villa'' in 715.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; This is in contrast to the much less frequently used ''-court'', which was not used anymore in the [[Viking Age]].

The most widely used ''-ville'' toponyms are combined with either an Old Scandinavian or Anglo-Scandinavian male name or a Romance adjective: [[Amfreville (disambiguation)|Amfreville]] (Ásfríðr′s farm), [[Auzouville]] (Osulf / Osolf′s farm), [[Beuzeville]] (Bosi′s farm), [[Colleville (disambiguation)|Colleville]] (Kolli′s farm), [[Épreville]] (*Sproti′s farm, cf. [[Faroese language|Faroese]] Sproti), [[Sotteville (disambiguation)|Sotteville]] (Sóti′s farm), [[Tocqueville]] (Tóki′s farm), [[Touffreville (disambiguation)|Touffreville]] (Þórfríðr′s farm), [[Tourville (disambiguation)|Tourville]] (Þórr's farm), [[Trouville (disambiguation)|Trouville]] (Thorold's farm), [[Grainville]] (Grímr / GrímR's farm), [[Bretteville (disambiguation)|Bretteville]] (Briton's farm) and [[Englesqueville]] or [[Anglesqueville]] (English farm).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; These toponyms do not exist in France outside of Normandy, because their first element is an Old Scandinavian or an Old Anglo-Scandinavian personal name and sometimes a romance adjective marking they came from Great-Britain, but were mainly Anglo-Scandinavian farmers. In addition some typical [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] male′s names can be found in Doncanville ([[Donnchadh]]&gt; Duncan′s farm), [[Quinéville]] or Quenneville ([[Cináed (disambiguation)|Cináed]] &gt; Kenneth′s farm), [[Néville]] ([[Niall]] &gt; Njáll′s farm).

The ''-court'' appellative is usually combined with either a Germanic masculine name, as in [[Hébécourt (disambiguation)|Hébécourt]], from ''[[Herbert (disambiguation)|Herbert]]'' &gt; Norman-French ''Hebert'' (today the surname [[Hébert (disambiguation)|Hébert]]), as in [[Sébécourt]], from ''Sigebert'' &gt; ''Sebert'' (today the surname ''Sébert'').&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; It almost never appears as a suffix in the western part of Normandy, but as a prefix (''Cour-'', ''Gour-'', ''Col-'', ''Coul-''): [[Gourfaleur]] from ''falor'', the name of a people; [[Coulvain]], meaning "Laipwin's court"; and [[Coulimer]], meaning "Lietmar's court".&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; François de Beaurepaire observed that ''-court'' and ''Cour-'' were never used with an Anglo-Scandinavian male's name or element.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common appellative is ''-mesnil'' or ''Mesnil-'' (written as ''ménil'' in the [[Orne]] [[département]]). They are mainly combined with masculine anthroponyms as in [[Aubermesnil]] or [[Avremesnil]], much like the ''-ville'' place-names, and were later built according to the Romance order, for example [[Mesnil-Hermant]] and [[Le Mesnil-Esnard|Mesnil-Esnard]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;

The appellative ''-bosc'' or ''Bosc-'' (pronounced [bo:] or [bɔk]), meaning "wood", corresponds to the French word ''bois'', and is specific to this Province. In Normandy, it is usually combined with a masculine name: Auberbosc and Colbosc, when following the Germanic order; while the later Romance order gives numerous examples, such as [[Bosc-Roger]], [[Bosc-Renoult]], and [[Bosc-Robert]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;

''-vast'' is the only one that never appears as ''*Vast-'', but autonomous as [[le Vast]]. The first element must be a personal name, like Gallo-Romance Martin in [[Martinvast]], Old Norse Sóti in [[Sottevast]] (''Sotewast'', 12th century), and Old Norse Tóli in Tollevast (''Toberwast'' and ''Tolewast'', 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;  Véraval, now often misspelled as Ver-à-Val, became a ''-val'' ("valley") place-name by [[popular etymology]]. First recorded as ''Warelwast'' in 1024 (see [[William de Warelwast]]), utilizing the former appellative, ''-wast'' (meaning "bad land", or "unfertile or uncultivated land"),&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; which is now spelled ''-vast'' in the north and ''ga(s)t(te)'' in the south.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; Its etymology is ultimately Latin ''vastus'' "bad land" mixed up with [[Old Low Franconian]] ''*wost'' "desert" (Old High German ''wuosti'', Old English ''wēste'').

== Normanic place names ==
[[File:Cartehistonormandie1.png|thumb|right|300px|Normandy in 10th - 11th century, map based on the Normannic toponymy (in blue). Normandy is the only region in France with Scandinavian place-names]]

=== Description ===
Old Norse  settlement names began with the Norse settlement at the end of the ninth century, expanding in the tenth century with the creation of the [[Duchy of Normandy]] by [[Rollo]] in 911. Since the speakers of Old Norse were linguistically assimilated into Francophone society within a few generations, these settlement names most likely date prior to the 11th century. Most of these settlers were most likely [[Denmark|Danish]] and/or [[Norway|Norwegian]]. These languages were quite similar to each other, making it difficult to distinguish the origin of the appellatives and accompanying adjective or male name.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Old Norse and Old English appellatives ===
*''Acre, -acre'' "field" &gt; "surface measure" (Norman acre) : Old Norse ''akr'' (Icelandic ''akur'' "field"). in Herboutacre, hamlet at Grainville-Ymauville (''De campo Herboutacre'' 1209). First element ''Herbout-'' represents probably the Germanic personal name ''Herbold'' now found as patronymic as ''Herbout'' in pays de Caux (Valliquerville, etc.); Fouquelacre (Dieppe, ''Fulconis Acra'' 1244); l'Acre-Guérard (Saint-Valéry-en-Caux)
*''[[Bec (place name)|Bec]]''- or ''-bec'', derived from ''[[beck]]'', meaning "stream" or "brook". It can also be found alone as in, le Bec. Examples of its combination with an adjective would be: [[Houlbec-Cocherel|Houlbec]], meaning "hollow beck"; [[Foulbec]], meaning "dirty beck"; and [[Caudebec-en-Caux|Caudebec]] 'cold beck' (Caldebec, 11th century), etc.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''-beuf'' or ''Boos'', from Old Norse ''búð'' &gt; Old Eastern Norse ''bóð'' (&gt; Old English ''bōth'' &gt; English ''booth''), meaning "booth, shed". Examples are: [[Elbeuf-sur-Andelle]], [[Elbeuf]] (Seine-Maritime, ''Wellebuot'' 1070 - 1081), [[Criquebeuf-en-Caux]], [[Lindebeuf]] (Seine-Maritime, ''Lindebeod'' 1142), and [[Boos, Seine-Maritime|Boos]] (Seine-Maritime, ''Bodas'' 1030 - 1040, ''Bothas'' ab 1049) -similar to Booths, Yorkshire-, Daubeuf-la-Campagne (Eure, ''Dalbuoth'' 1011).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;  Two cases at least are doubtful: [[Criquebeuf-la-Campagne]] (Eure, ''Crichebu'' 1203) and [[Carquebut]], which probably derive not from Old Eastern Norse  ''bóð'' but from the Old Norse ''bú''.&lt;ref&gt;Fournier&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes ''-beuf'' has been misspelled ''-bœuf'', meaning "ox" in French, as in [[Cricquebœuf]] (Calvados, ''Crikeboe'' 1198).&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt; The other ''-bœuf'' place-names throughout France refer to "ox", and clearly allude to slaughterhouses, such as [[Écorchebœuf]] ("flay-ox"), [[Saint-Michel-Tubœuf|Tubœuf]] ("kill-ox") or [[Tombebœuf]] ("fall-ox").  The ''-beuf, -bu, -bot'' element corresponds to the place-names ending with ''-by'' in Great Britain. It explains the existence of parallel formations on both sides of the English Channel:&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Bre(c)q-'' or ''-bre(c)que'' (sometimes ''Bricque-''), from the Old Norse ''brekka'', meaning "slope", "incline", or "hill".  Found in the following place-names: Houllebrecque in  ([[Saint-Aubin-de-Crétot]]), [[Brecqhou]] (England : [[Norbreck]], [[Warbreck]], and [[Scarisbrick]]).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;
*''-cher'' or ''-quier'', from the Old Norse ''kjarr'' meaning "marsh" or "swamp", which can be found in [[Villequier]] (combined with the Old English ''wiliġ'', meaning "willow") and [[Gonfreville-l'Orcher|Orcher]] (''Alrecher'', 11th century, combined with the Old English ''alor, aler'', meaning "alder").&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''-clives'', ''-lif'', ''Clé-'' or ''Cli-'', from the Old Norse ''klif'' or Old English ''clif'', meaning "cliff".&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of which are: ''Risleclif'', ''Witeclif'' (now Côte-Blanche "white cliff" at Évreux), [[Mesnil-Verclives|Verclives]], [[Clitourps]], [[Cléville (disambiguation)|Cléville]], [[Saint-Martin-en-Campagne|Carquelif]], and [[Clairefougère]] (''Clivefeugeriam'', 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Adigard des Gautries]] &amp; [[Fernand Lechanteur]], « Les noms de communes de Normandie », in ''Annales de Normandie'' XIX (juin 1969), § 715.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Crique-'' or  ''-crique'', from the Old Norse ''kirkja'', meaning "church", but this should not be confused with the French term, ''la crique'' from Old Norse ''kriki'', "creek".  Examples of this appellative are [[la Crique]], [[Criquetot-l'Esneval]], [[Criquetot-le-Mauconduit]] or [[Yvecrique]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Dalle-'', ''-dalle'', ''-dal'', or ''Dau-'', from the Old Norse ''dalr'', meaning "valley", or the Old English ''dæl'', meaning "dale".  It can be seen on its own with a romance article as in la Dalle or Le Dallet; or in combination with an adjective, as in [[Saint-Vaast-Dieppedalle|Dieppedalle]] (with the Old Norse ''djupr''&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt; or Old English ''dēop'', meaning "deep"&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Croixdalle]] (with the Old English ''crāwe'', meaning "crow"), and [[Oudalle]] (from the Norman ''ouf'', meaning "wolf").
*''Escalle'' or  ''-écal-'', from either the Old Norse ''skali'' or Old English ''scale'', meaning "shelter".  Examples would be Touffrécal, Brecquécal, [[Écalles-Alix]] (Escales, 12th century), and [[Villers-Écalles]] (Escalis, 12th century).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Étain-'', ''Étan-'' or ''Étenne-'', from the Old Norse ''steinn'' or Old English ''stān'', meaning "stone".  Examples would be: [[Fatouville-Grestain|Grestain]] (combined with the Old English ''grēat'', meaning "big"),&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt; [[Étainhus]] (Stone house), Étaintot, Étheintot, [[Étalondes]], and Étangval (Stone valley).
*''-gard'', from the Old Norse ''garðr'', meaning "yard" or "garden", found in the names: [[Auppegard]] (''Appelgart'' ab. 1160) combined with ''æppel'', meaning "apple") and Figard (''Figart'' 1238, combined with ''fiskr'', meaning "fish").&lt;ref&gt;Ridel&lt;/ref&gt;
*''-gate or -gathe'', meaning "way", as in [[Houlgate]], la Houlgate, Hôrgate (meaning "hollow way"), Hiégathe, etc.&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hague'', ''-hague'', from the Old Norse or Old English ''haga'', meaning "enclosure".  Examples are: [[la Hague]], le Tohague, [[Imbleville|Étauhague]], and le Haguedic (combined with the Anglo-Norse ''dik'').&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Hogue'' or ''Hougue'' from the Old Norse ''haugr'', meaning "hill", found in names like [[Les Hogues]], [[Saint-Vaast-la-Hougue]], and la Hougue-Bie (Jersey).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Houlme'', ''Hom(me)'' or ''-homme'', from the Old Norse word ''holmr'', meaning "islet".  The appellative, ''homme'', is identical to the French word meaning, "man", but is pronounced differently: French {{IPA-fr|ɔm|}} (''l'homme'') versus Norman {{IPA-frdia|χɔm|}} or {{IPA|[hɔm]}} (''le homme''). It is found in place-names such as [[Le Houlme]], [[Bavent|Robehomme]], [[Saint-Quentin-sur-le-Homme]], and [[Saint-Senier-sous-Avranches|les Échommes]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''-hus'' or ''-hurs'' from the Old Norse ''hús'' or Old English ''hūs'', meaning "house".  As found in: [[Sahurs]] (''Salhus'' ab 1024, maybe from ''Sálúhús'' "kind of inn" like [[Salhus (disambiguation)]], Norway) and [[Étainhus]] (″stone house″).&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Londe'', ''-lon'' or ''-ron'', from the [[Old Norman]] ''londe'', meaning "forest" or "wood". There are over 45 municipalities and hamlets named La Londe in Normandy, as well as several Les Londes (plural).  It is also used in combination with other adjectives, such as [[Bouquelon]] (Eure, ''Buculun'' ab 1040), Bois de Boclon (Seine-Maritime, ''Bocolunda silva'' 1032), la Bouquelonde, combined with ''bók(i)'', meaning "beech tree"; [[Yquelon]], Yclon (Seine-Maritime, ''Iquelont'' 1404), Iclon (Seine-Maritime, ''Ichelunt'' 1088) combined with ''eik(i)'', meaning "oak tree"; [[Écaquelon]] (Eure, ''Schacherlon'' 1174), Écaquelon (Eure, ''Escakerlon'' 1169), combined with the Old English ''sċeaċere'', meaning "thief" or "brigand"; Catelonde (Calvados, ''Cathelunde'' 12th century) with personal name ''Káti''; [[Yébleron]] (Seine-Maritime, ''Eblelont'' ab 1210); [[Ablon]] (Calvados, ''Eblelont'' w. d.) with ''epli'' "apple".&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Thuit (disambiguation)|Thuit]]'' or ''-tuit'', from the Old Norse ''thveit'', meaning "[[assart]]", English [[Thwaite (placename element)]]. Several le Thuit exist, as well as other combined examples, such as [[Bracquetuit]], [[Doudeville|Vautuit]], and [[Notre-Dame-de-Bliquetuit|Bliquetuit]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Torp'', ''Torps'', ''Tourp'', ''Tourps'', ''-tourp'' or ''-tour'', from the Old Norse ''[[Torp (architecture)|torp]]'' or the Old English ''thorp'', meaning "settlement".  There are several stand alone towns named either Torps or le Torp.  Other examples are: [[le Torp-Mesnil]], [[Clitourps]], [[Fresville|Saussetour]] (''Sauxetorp'' end 12th century), [[Théville|Sauxtour]] (''Sauxetourp'' 1292), similar as [[Saustrup]] (Schleswig-Holstein, ''Saxtorppe'', 15th century&lt;ref&gt;Laur&lt;/ref&gt;), meaning "Saxi's Torp".&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Tot'' or ''-tot'', meaning "property", is the most common suffix of Old Norse origin, with more than 300 locations ending with ''-tot'' in Normandy. It is derived from the Old Norse ''topt'' (similar to the Old English ''[[toft (disambiguation)|toft]]'', and Old Danish ''-toft[e]''), meaning "site of a house". In later usages of the 11th century, it can also be found alone as in, le Tot. It can be combined with a male name, as in [[Yvetot]], [[Routot]], Martintot or Létantot, (respectively Yvo (Germanic), Hrolfr (Norse), Martin (Romance) and Lestan (Anglo-Saxon)); or a tree-name, as in [[Bouquetot]] (from ''boki'', meaning "beech-tree"), and [[Ectot-l'Auber|Ectot]] or [[Ecquetot]] (from ''eski'', meaning "ash-tree") and [[Plumetot]] (from Old English ''plūme'' "plum tree"); or with another appellative or adjective, examples of which would be  Martot (from ''marr'' or ''mere'', meaning "pond"), [[Életot]] (from ''sletta'', meaning "flat land"), and [[Hautot-sur-Mer|Hautot]], [[Hottot-les-Bagues|Hottot]] or [[Hotot-en-Auge|Hotot]] (from the Old English ''hōh'', meaning "slope" or "incline").&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Veules'' or ''El-'', from the Old Norse ''vella'' or OE ''wella'', meaning "spring" or "stream", which can be found in place-names such as: [[Veules-les-Roses]] (Seine-Maritime, ''Wellas'' 1025), [[Elbeuf]] (''Wellebuoth'' 1070 - 1081), [[Elbeuf-sur-Andelle]], and [[Elbeuf-en-Bray]].&lt;ref&gt;De Beaurepaire&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Renaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dauzat et Rostaing&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Manmade River is the world's largest [[irrigation]] project.]]

The '''Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System''' ('''NSAS''') is the world’s largest known [[fossil water]] [[aquifer]] system. It is located underground in the Eastern end of the [[Sahara Desert]] and spans the political boundaries of four countries in north-eastern [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/Nubian/IHS_nubian.html International Atomic Energy Agency: NSAS Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020163247/http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/Nubian/IHS_nubian.html |date=2007-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NSAS covers a land area spanning just over two million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, including north-western [[Sudan]], north-eastern [[Chad]], south-eastern [[Libya]], and most of [[Egypt]]. Containing an estimated 150,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of [[groundwater]],&lt;ref&gt;Center for Environmental and Development for the Arab Region and Europe (CEDARE) 2000&lt;/ref&gt; the significance of the NSAS as a potential [[Water resources|water resource]] for future development programs in these countries is extraordinary. Recently the [[Great Man-Made River|Great Man-made River Project (GMMR)]] in Libya began extracting substantial amounts of water from this aquifer, removing an estimated 2.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; per year. This system is primarily used to supply water in the [[Kufra]] oasis.

==Characteristics==
Since 2001, the [[Nubian Sandstone]] aquifer situated between the [[Toshka]] and [[Abu Simbel]] areas of Egypt underwent intensive drilling and development as part of a [[land reclamation]] project. Drilling information was used to conduct a variety of studies regarding the hydrogeological setting of the area's aquifer. Results indicated that [[lithological]] characteristics and [[tectonic]] settings are having a substantial effect on groundwater flow patterns and the area's overall aquifer potentiality, which is considered relatively low when compared to neighboring areas in eastern [[Oweinat]] or [[Dakhla Oasis|Dakhla]].

===Geology===
The aquifer is largely composed of hard [[Iron oxide|ferruginous]] [[sandstone]] with great [[shale]] and clay [[interbedding|intercalation]], having a thickness that ranges between 140–230 meters. Groundwater type varies from fresh to slightly brackish ([[salinity]] ranges from 240-1300 [[Parts per million|ppm]]). The [[ion]] dominance ordering shows that [[sodium]] [[cation]] is most commonly predominating over [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]] - whereas [[chloride]] is predominant over [[sulfate]] and [[bicarbonate]]. The groundwater is of [[Meteoric water|meteoric origin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/2j9yefx9n3gujay8/] Abd El Samie, S., and Sadek, M., 2001, ''Groundwater recharge and flow in the Lower Cretaceous Nubian Sandstone aquifer in the Sinai Peninsula, using isotopic techniques and hydrochemistry'': Hydrogeology Journal, vol. 9, n. 4, p. 378-389&lt;/ref&gt; (the term meteoric water refers to water that originated as precipitation; most groundwater is meteoric in origin). High concentrations of sodium, chloride, and sulfates reflect the [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]] and [[solvation|dissolution]] processes of [[Gypsum|gypsiferous]] shales and clay, in addition to a lengthy duration of water residence.&lt;ref&gt;''A Study of Hydrogeological Conditions of the Nubian Sandstone Aguifer in the Area between Abu Simbel &amp; Toschka, Western Desert, Egypt''. American Geophysical Union, Spring 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==International development projects==
Since 2006, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] has been working in cooperation with the four NSAS countries to help increase understanding of the aquifer's complexities through the IAEA-UNDP-GEF Nubian Project.&lt;ref name="Science and Diplomacy."&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.sciencediplomacy.org/perspective/2015/international-atomic-energy-agency |journal=Science and Diplomacy|date=June 22, 2015 |title=The International Atomic Energy Agency: Linking Nuclear Science and Diplomacy |first=John |last=Brittain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project partners include the [[United Nations Development Programme]] ([[UNDP]])/[[Global Environment Facility]] ([[Global Environment Facility|GEF]]), IAEA, [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] ([[UNESCO]]) and government representatives from the NSAS countries. The project's long-term goal is establishing rational and equitable management of the NSAS as a productive way of advancing socio-economic development in the region and protecting biodiversity and land resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-naweb.iaea.org/napc/ih/Nubian/document/Nubian%20inception_report%20-may1107.pdf IAEA/UNDP/GEF Nubian Sandstone Aquifer System Medium Sized Project: Inception Meeting Report.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Nauru:

'''[[Nauru]]''' &amp;ndash; [[List of sovereign states|sovereign]] [[island nation]] located in the [[Micronesia]]n [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=2 July 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/nr.html|title=Nauru|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its nearest neighbour is [[Banaba Island]] in the [[Kiribati|Republic of Kiribati]], {{convert|300|km|mi|-1}} due east. Nauru is the world's smallest island nation, covering just {{convert|21|km2|mi2|0}}, the smallest independent [[republic]], and the only republican state in the world without an official [[capital (political)|capital]]. It is the least populous member of the [[United Nations]].

Initially inhabited by [[Micronesia]]n and [[Polynesia]]n peoples, Nauru was [[Annexation|annex]]ed and designated a [[colony]] by [[German Empire|Germany]] in the late 19th century, and became a [[League of Nations|mandate territory]] administered by [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]] following [[World War I]]. The [[island]] was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during [[World War II]], and after the war entered into trusteeship again. Nauru achieved independence in 1968.

Nauru is a [[phosphate rock]] [[island]], and its primary economic activity since 1907 has been the export of phosphate mined from the island.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;[http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html Republic of Nauru Permanent Mission to the United Nations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818033559/http://www.un.int/nauru/overview.html |date=18 August 2006 }}. Retrieved 2006-05-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; With the exhaustion of phosphate reserves, its environment severely degraded by mining, and the trust established to manage the island's wealth significantly reduced in value, the government of Nauru has resorted to unusual measures to obtain income. In the 1990s, Nauru briefly became a [[tax haven]] and [[money laundering]] centre. Since 2001, it accepted aid from the Australian government; in exchange for this aid, Nauru housed, until early 2008, an offshore [[Nauru detention centre|detention centre]] that held and processed [[right of asylum|asylum seekers]] trying to enter [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7229764.stm |title=Australia ends 'Pacific Solution' |publisher=BBC News |date=8 February 2008 |accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Portugal:

The '''[[Portuguese Republic]]''', commonly known as '''[[Portugal]]''', is a [[List of sovereign states|sovereign country]] principally located on the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref name=CIA_World_Factbook&gt;{{cite web|date=July 2, 2009|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/po.html|title=Portugal|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency]]|accessdate=July 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Portugal is the westernmost country of continental Europe and is bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the west and south and by [[Spain]] to the north and east. The Atlantic [[archipelago]]s of the [[Azores Islands|Azores]] and [[Madeira]] (including the [[Savage Islands]]) are also part of Portugal.

The land within the borders of today's Portuguese Republic has been continuously settled since [[Prehistoric Iberia|prehistoric times]]. Some of the earliest [[civilization]]s include [[Lusitanians]] and [[Celt]]ic societies. Incorporation into the [[Roman Republic]] dominions took place in the 2nd century BC. The region was ruled and colonized by [[Germanic peoples]], such as the [[Suebi]] and the [[Visigoths]], from the 5th to the 8th century. From this era, some vestiges of the [[Alans]] were also found. The Muslim [[Moors]] arrived in the early 8th century and conquered the [[Christian]] [[Timeline of Portuguese history (Germanic Kingdoms)|Germanic kingdoms]], eventually occupying most of the Iberian Peninsula. In the early 12th century, during the Christian ''[[Reconquista]]'', Portugal appeared as a kingdom independent of its neighbour, the [[Kingdom of León]] and [[Kingdom of Galicia|Galicia]]. In a little over a century, in 1249, Portugal would establish almost its entire modern-day borders.

During the 15th and 16th centuries, with a [[Portuguese Empire|global empire]] that included possessions in [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[South America]], Portugal was one of the world's major economic, political, and cultural powers. In the 17th century, the [[Portuguese Restoration War]] between Portugal and Spain ended the sixty-year period of the [[Iberian Union]] (1580–1640). In the 19th century, armed conflict with [[France|French]] and [[Spain|Spanish]] invading forces and the loss of its largest territorial possession abroad, [[Brazil]], disrupted political stability and potential economic growth. In 1910, the last Portuguese king was overthrown and a [[First Portuguese Republic|republic]] was proclaimed. In 1926, a [[coup d'état]] established a [[Ditadura Nacional|military dictatorship]] that would be replaced by a fascist regime called [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] in 1933. After the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961-1974) and the [[Carnation Revolution]] [[coup d'état]] in 1974, the ruling [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|regime]] was deposed in Lisbon, a [[Third Portuguese Republic|democracy]] was established and the country handed over its last overseas provinces in Africa. Portugal was accepted as a member of the [[European Economic Community]] in 1986. Portugal's last overseas territory, [[Macau]], was handed over to [[People's Republic of China|China]] in 1999.

[[File:Plumb bob.jpg|thumb|upright|A plumb-bob]]
A '''plumb bob''', or '''plummet''', is a weight, usually with a pointed tip on the bottom, suspended from a string and used as a vertical reference line, or '''plumb-line'''. It is essentially the vertical equivalent of a "[[spirit level|water level]]".

The [[measuring instrument|instrument]] has been used since at least the time of [[ancient Egypt]]&lt;ref name="Stocks2003"&gt;Denys A. Stocks. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=oLDuHvQODoIC&amp;pg=PA180 Experiments in Egyptian archaeology: stoneworking technology in ancient Egypt]''. Routledge; 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-415-30664-5}}. p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure that constructions are "[[wikt:plumb|plumb]]", or vertical. It is also used in [[surveying]], to establish the [[nadir]] with respect to gravity of a point in space. It is used with a variety of instruments (including levels, [[theodolite]]s, and [[tape measure|steel tapes]]) to set the instrument exactly over a fixed [[survey marker]] or to transcribe positions onto the ground for placing a marker.&lt;ref name="Brinker1995"&gt;{{cite book |title=The surveying handbook|pages=93–94|editor1-last=Brinker|editor1-first=Russell Charles|editor2-last=Minnick|editor2-first=Roy|isbn=978-0-412-98511-9|year=1995|publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig23--plumb rule.png|upright=0.4|thumb|left|A plumb rule from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
[[File:Cc&amp;j-fig24--plumb square.png|thumb|A plumb square from the book Cassells' Carpentry and Joinery]]
The "plumb" in "plumb-bob" comes from the fact that such tools were originally made of [[lead]] ([[Latin]]: ''[[wikt:plumbum|plumbum]]'', [[French language|French]]: ''[[wikt:plomb|plomb]]''). The adjective "[[wikt:plumb|plumb]]" developed by extension, as did the noun "[[wikt:aplomb|aplomb]]," from the notion of "standing upright."

==Use==
Until the modern age, plumb-bobs were used on most tall structures to provide vertical datum lines for the building measurements. A section of the scaffolding would hold a plumb line, which was centered over a datum mark on the floor. As the building proceeded upward, the plumb line would also be taken higher, still centered on the datum. Many cathedral [[spire]]s, [[domes]] and [[tower]]s still have brass datum marks inlaid into their floors, which signify the center of the structure above.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

[[File:Lot hg.jpg|thumb|Plumb-bob with scale as an inclinometer]]
Although a plumb-bob and line alone can determine only a vertical if they are mounted on a suitable scale, the instrument may also be used as an [[inclinometer]] to measure angles to the vertical.

The early skyscrapers used heavy plumb-bobs, hung on wire in their elevator shafts.

A plumb bob may be in a container of water (when conditions are above freezing temperatures), molasses, very viscous oils or other liquids to dampen any swinging movement,&lt;ref&gt;Staley, W. W.. ''Introduction to mine surveying'',. 2nd ed. Stanford University, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1964. Print. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; functioning as a [[shock absorber]].

=== Determining center of gravity of an irregular shape ===
Students of [[figure drawing]] will also make use of a plumb line to find the vertical axis through the [[center of gravity]] of their subject and lay it down on paper as a [[frame of reference|point of reference]]. The device used may be purpose-made plumb lines, or simply makeshift devices made from a piece of string and a weighted object, such as a [[washer (hardware)|metal washer]]. This plumb line is important for lining up anatomical geometries and visualizing the subject's [[center of mass|center of balance]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

Together, they co-founded the Contra Costa Ecology Action Education Institute.  Ted, who died August 28, 2016, had served on the EBRPD Board from 1978 to 2014, was the longest-serving member of the board. Among his many accomplishments, he was credited with creating the Carquinez Strait Regional Shoreline, Crockett Hills Regional Park, Alvarado Staging Area at Wildcat Canyon Regional Park and the permanent entrance at Kennedy Grove Regional Recreation Area. Kathy, who died in 2011, had worked to preserve Mt. Wanda from development and to preserve Franklin Hills as open space.&lt;ref name="EBRPD-PA"/&gt;}}

==Features==

In [[statistics]], the '''rational quadratic [[covariance function]]''' is used in [[spatial statistics]], [[geostatistics]], [[machine learning]], image analysis, and other fields where multivariate statistical analysis is conducted on [[metric space]]s. It is commonly used to define the statistical [[covariance]] between measurements made at two points that are ''d'' units distant from each other. Since the covariance only depends on distances between points, it is [[stationary process|stationary]]. If the distance is [[Euclidean distance]], the '''rational quadratic covariance function''' is also [[isotropic]].

The '''rational quadratic covariance''' between two points separated by ''d'' distance units is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
C(d) = \Bigg(1+\frac{d^2}{2\alpha k^2}\Bigg)^{-\alpha}
&lt;/math&gt;

where α and ''k'' are non-negative [[parameter]]s of the covariance.

'''''Stargazer''''', [[aircraft registration|registration number]] '''N140SC''', is a [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]] built in 1974, that was modified in 1994 to be used by [[Orbital Sciences]] (later [[Orbital ATK]], now [[Northrop Grumman]]) as a [[mother ship]] [[launch pad]] for [[Pegasus (rocket)|Pegasus]] rockets. {{As of|2016|12}}, 43 rockets (containing 94 satellites) have been launched from it, using the Pegasus-H and Pegasus-XL configurations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.airframes.org/reg/n140sc&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.orbitalatk.com/flight-systems/space-launch-vehicles/pegasus/ | title = Orbital ATK Pegasus|publisher=Orbital Sciences Corporation|accessdate=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The first Pegasus launch to use ''Stargazer'' was conducted on 27 June 1994, and was the maiden flight of the Pegasus-XL. Previous launches used the [[NASA]]-operated [[Boeing]] [[B-52 Stratofortress|NB-52B]] ''[[Balls 8]]'', which was also used for four subsequent launches, as the original Pegasus could not be launched from ''Stargazer'' due to clearance issues. A modified version, the Pegasus-H, was introduced to rectify this.

In addition to Pegasus launches, ''Stargazer'' was used for captive tests and transportation of the [[Orbital Sciences X-34|X-34]] hypersonic research aircraft; however, [[drop test]]s used ''Balls 8''. [[Orbital Sciences Corporation|Orbital Sciences]] also offer the aircraft for research flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orbital.com/LaunchSystems/SpaceLaunchVehicles/Pegasus/L-1011/|title="Stargazer" L-1011 Carrier Aircraft|publisher=Orbital Sciences Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is capable of carrying a {{convert|23000|kg}} payload to an altitude of {{convert|12800|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.orbital.com/LaunchSystems/Publications/Pegasus_factsheet.pdf | title = L-1011 Fact Sheet|publisher=Orbital Sciences Corporation|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stargazer on IRIS mission,.jpg|thumb|[[Orbital Sciences]] ''Stargazer'' departing from Vandenberg on 27 June 2013, carrying the [[Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph]] (IRIS) aboard a Pegasus XL rocket]]
Pegasus launches using ''Stargazer'' are usually conducted from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. However, launches have also been conducted from the [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], the [[NASA]] [[Kennedy Space Center]], the [[NASA]] [[Wallops Flight Facility]] and from launch sites outside the United States: [[Kwajalein Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]] and [[Gran Canaria Airport|Gando Airport]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_lau/pegasus.htm|title=Pegasus|last=Krebs|first=Gunter|publisher=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=2009-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, ''Stargazer'' was re-painted to reflect Orbital Sciences' merger with [[Alliant Techsystems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Justin|title=Photo: New Orbital ATK paint job for Pegasus carrier jet|url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/04/19/new-orbital-atk-paint-job-for-pegasus-carrier-jet|website=Spaceflight Now|publisher=Spaceflight Now Inc.|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 December 2016, ''Stargazer'' launched [[Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System|CYGNSS]] on behalf of NASA on its second attempt; the first was scrubbed on 12 December due to issues with the hydraulic system responsible for separating the Pegasus rocket from the launch aircraft.

The  Lockheed TriStar upon which Stargazer is based  first flew in February 1974, and was operated as a commercial airliner primarily by [[Air Canada]] until May 1992, when it was so renamed and inducted into its use in the Pegasus launch system.&lt;reF&gt;[ https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/08/icon-resets-october-launch-east-coast/]&lt;/reF&gt; Originally a passenger airliner, the Lockheed TriStar was converted into its current form by Orbital Sciences Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2018/08/icon-resets-october-launch-east-coast/]&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Texhoma''' is a town in [[Texas County, Oklahoma|Texas County]], [[Oklahoma]], United States.  The population was 926 at the [[United States Census, 2010|2010 census]].  Texhoma is a [[divided city]] with the Texas–Oklahoma state border separating the town from [[Texhoma, Texas]].  The name of the town is a [[portmanteau]] of &lt;u&gt;Tex&lt;/u&gt;as and Okla&lt;u&gt;homa&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Td4jAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TygEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3270%2C4288911 | title=Take a Good Look at the US Map. Towns Have the Craziest Names | work=The Milwaukee Journal | date=Sep 8, 1969 | accessdate=18 May 2015 | author=Remington, Frank L. | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Founded around the Rock Island Railroad laying tracks through the area, much of the town's local economy is from ranching and livestock.

==History==
Before [[Neutral Strip|No Man's Land]] was opened for settlers in 1890, the area now known as the [[Oklahoma Panhandle]] was sparsely settled ranchland. After the opening some of the land was filed on near the ranch headquarters, mostly by the cowboys, and sold to the ranch as soon as proved up. Expansion of the [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Railroad]] tracks from [[Liberal, Kansas]] to [[Santa Rosa, New Mexico]] spurred the settlement's formation.

A post office named '''Loretta''' was established May 7, 1898, but the name and location was changed to '''Texhoma''' on November 12, 1901, as there was another [[Loretta, Oklahoma]]. Very few claims were filed on until the railroad was assured. The town grew quickly to a population near 1,000, serving as the closest railroad town to the people who lived as far north and west as present [[Boise City, Oklahoma|Boise City]], and south into the [[Texas Panhandle]] to the present town of [[Gruver, Texas|Gruver]].

The land was quickly homesteaded and proved to be a rich agricultural area.

==Geography==
Texhoma is located at {{Coord|36|30|16|N|101|47|11|W|type:city}} (36.504421, -101.786517).&lt;ref name="GR1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

==Texhoma-Texhoma relationship==
Texhoma is most known for the fact that it is paired with [[Texhoma, Texas|another Texhoma]] across the border in Texas. Tourists come for the border sign that separates Oklahoma and Texas, and the sign is very iconic.

==Gameplay==
{{expand section|date=March 2016}}

''The Park'' is experienced from a first-person perspective as the player interacts with and experiences the decrepit environment of Atlantic Island Park. There is no combat or defense and the player has no health HUD as Lorraine can only interact with limited objects in-game and there are no enemies to battle. These objects mostly consist of pages that reveal the backstory of the park and later, Lorraine. Lorraine can call out to Callum at any time during gameplay, and this may have a small affect as it allows Lorraine to follow Callum's voice and thus continue the narrative of the story or to reach necessary areas or objectives within the park such as the rides. The rides act as both exposition and scares. To enter the House of Horrors, Lorraine must find a flashlight. Throughout the game, Lorraine narrates her feelings and memories to the player.

==Plot==
{{more plot|date=March 2016}}
The game follows Lorraine, a struggling [[Single parents#Mother|single mother]] and [[widow]] with a troubled past, as she searches for her young son, Callum, who goes missing in Atlantic Island Park. Lorraine enters the park after her son just as the park prepares to close for the afternoon, only to find that nighttime comes unnaturally fast as she ascends the escalator and discovers the park to be abandoned, vandalized and rundown as if several years have passed. Despite abandonment, the rides and lights mysteriously still function. Lorraine calls for Callum and his voice calls to her, leading her through the decrepit park.

Lorraine boards several rides which reveal the themes and backstory of the game: the Tunnel of Tales tells the story of [[Hansel and Gretel]], this time with a new ending - in which after cooking the witch in the oven, Hansel and Gretel devour her. On the [[Ferris Wheel]], Lorraine remembers Callum's father Don, a [[construction worker]] at the park who died in a fall from the Ferris Wheel when Lorraine was still pregnant with Callum. Between rides, Lorraine expresses her frustration with Callum, her belief that she is a failure as a mother, her history of mental health problems, and her fear that Callum is becoming changed by some mysterious threat. However, while aboard the roller coaster, a monstrous top-hatted [[Ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] (identified in the credits as The [[Boogeyman]]) accosts Lorraine and claims 'the Witch' has her son.

According to notes found throughout the area, the park's grounds are hinted to have a sinister history that [[Energy (esotericism)|tainted]] them, as a consequence of previous owner Archibald Henderson's actions, which the new owner Mr. Winter tried to take advantage of: several notes indicate that he had found a way to unlock the power hidden beneath the grounds by harvesting the positive emotions of guests, and believed that the energy he unlocked would be enough to grant him [[immortality]]. However, workers and employees alike experienced feelings of anxiety as a result of the process, and a number of fatal incidents occurred. One noticeable case involved 'Chad the Chipmunk', the park's mascot: Steve, the employee wearing the chipmunk suit, became disturbed and reluctant to remove the suit as time went on - and ultimately murdered a teenager with an icepick. Following Steve's arrest and the disappearance of over a dozen children inside the House of Horrors, the Park was forced to close permanently, drawing Lorraine's perceptions during the introduction into question.

At last, Lorraine enters the witch-faced House of Horrors, still following Callum, and remarking on the similarity between this and the Hansel and Gretel story. Inside, messages from Mr. Winter reveal that he retreated into the House with his machines when the Park closed, hoping to achieve immortality by other means. However, the interior of the House changes to a loop of Lorraine and Callum's own home through time, where it is revealed that Lorraine's father abused and abducted her as a child, her estranged mother refuses to help her in the belief that she ran away from home, and she suffered from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] when Callum was born and given [[electroshock therapy]]. As Lorraine passes through each version of her house, it becomes more decrepit and disturbing. At the end, she finds a message by Mr. Winter revealing that he needs children for his harvesting machines, and has already kidnapped and killed at least one in order to fuel his immortality; notes such as these, combined with popular depictions of Winter in a similar ringmaster's garb and top hat, suggest that he is actually the Boogeyman haunting the grounds.

Lorraine reveals that in the oldest versions of the Hansel and Gretel story, the cruel mother and the Witch were the same person, and that she believes she is the real Witch - apparently accepting that her neglect of Callum was the indirect cause of Callum's disappearance. Finally, she reaches Callum, lying unconscious on a slab. Chad the Chipmunk appears behind her, then is replaced by the Boogeyman, who forces a bloody icepick into Lorraine's hands, then guides her hands so she holds the point above Callum's chest; however, he then releases her hands and vanishes, allowing Lorraine to stab Callum in the heart.

Afterwards, Lorraine is sitting in a police station interrogation room, clearly grief-stricken. A detective identical to the Park gatekeeper enters, carrying a jar with a bee in it, and tells her not to worry about losing things and to think of the last place she saw her son. Lorraine narrates that, in her heart and mind, she will always return to Atlantic Island Park. Ultimately, though the supernatural elements of the game are eventually confirmed to be true by the game's ties with ''The Secret World'' and Lorraine's appearance in later issues of the game, it's left ambiguous as to how much of ''The Park'' was real and how much was simply imaginary.

==Development==
''The Park'' was announced by Funcom on August 26, 2015. According to Funcom's Rui Casais, the games' development began as an experiment by a small team. The team hoped to utilize the worlds from their previous [[massively multiplayer online]] games, and reshape them into some smaller single-player games.  According to Casasis, it was "creatively energising" for the team to work on a new single-player game as their last game with a single-player focus was ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/26/funcom-announces-new-horror-game-the-park|title=Funcom Announces New Horror Game The Park|first=Vikki|last=Blake|work=[[IGN]]|date=August 25, 2016|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's universe is based on 2012's ''[[The Secret World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-park-is-a-short-horror-game-set-in-the-secret-worlds-universe/|title=The Park is a short horror game set in The Secret World's universe|first=James|last=Davenport|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=August 26, 2016|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was announced for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] in November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/11/17/psychological-horror-game-the-park-coming-to-consoles.aspx|title=Psychological Horror Game The Park Coming To Consoles|first=Joseph|last=Knoop|date=November 15, 2016|accessdate=April 19, 2016|work=[[Game Informer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funcom later announced that the console versions will be released on May 3, 2016, making it the first Funcom game developed for consoles since ''Dreamfall'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-18-funcoms-horror-game-the-park-dated-for-ps4-and-xbox-one|title=Funcom's horror game The Park is coming to PS4 and Xbox One in May|first=Jeffery|last=Matulef|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=April 18, 2016|accessdate=April 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

The game currently holds a rating of 67 out of 100 on [[Metacritic]] based on 25 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Park|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/the-park/critic-reviews|publisher=Metacritic|accessdate=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The bush'''" is a rural, undeveloped country area in certain areas.

==Usage by country==
===Australia===
[[File:Australian bush02.jpg|thumb|Australian bush in the state of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].]]
The concept of "the bush" has become iconic in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to the landscape, "bush" refers to any sparsely-inhabited region, regardless of vegetation. "The bush" in this sense was something that was uniquely Australian{{cn|date=November 2015}} and very different from the green European landscapes familiar to many new immigrants. The term "[[Outback]]" is also used, but usually in association with the more arid inland areas of Australia. "The Bush" also refers to any populated region outside of the major metropolitan areas, including mining and [[agriculture in Australia|agricultural areas]]. Consequently, it is not unusual to have a mining town in the desert such as [[Port Hedland]] (Pop. 14,000) referred to as "the bush" within the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2008-08-28/grocerychoice-useless-for-those-in-the-bush-tuckey/492284 |title= GroceryChoice useless for those in the bush: Tuckey |date= 28 August 2008 |publisher= [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bush ballad|Bush poets]] such as [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] revered the bush as a source of national ideals, as did contemporaneous painters in the [[Heidelberg School]] like [[Tom Roberts]] (1856-1931), [[Arthur Streeton]] (1867-1943) and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (1855-1917).&lt;ref name="aupa"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-painters |title= Australian painters |accessdate= 5 November 2012 |date= 23 November 2007 |publisher= Commonwealth of Australia |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121021091855/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-painters |archivedate= 21 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanticising the bush in this way was a big step forward for Australians in their steps towards [[self-identity]].{{cn|date=November 2015}} The legacy is a [[folklore]] rich in the spirit of the bush.

Australians affix the term "bush" to any number of other entities or activities to describe their rural, country or folk nature, e.g. "[[Cricket|Bush Cricket]]", "[[Australian folk music|Bush Music]]", "[[Doof|Bush Doof]]", etc.

===New Zealand===
{{see also|Forest parks of New Zealand|Deforestation in New Zealand}}
 &lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Auckland]] --&gt;
[[Image:LakeGunnBush.jpg|thumb|right|New Zealand's bush is variable in appearance, but generally the term connotates densely forested areas, like this one around [[Lake Gunn]] in [[Fiordland]].]]

In New Zealand, ''Bush'' primarily refers to areas of native trees rather than exotic forests, however, the word is also used in the Australian sense of anywhere outside urban areas, encompassing grasslands as well as forests.&lt;ref name=" Jock Phillips"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/the-New-Zealand-bush/1 |title=The New Zealand bush – What is the bush? (The bush: dense native forest) |author=Jock Phillips |date=17 September 2009 |publisher=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Zealand usage of "bush" probably comes from the word "bosch", used by Dutch settlers in South Africa, where it meant uncultivated country.&lt;ref name="Jock Phillips"/&gt;

Areas with bush (i.e. native forest) are found predominantly in the [[South Island]], especially in the [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]] region stretching from [[Fiordland]] to [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], with the east coast having been deforested except for parts of [[Kaikoura]] and [[the Catlins]]. Much of [[Stewart Island/Rakiura]] is bush-covered. In the [[North Island]], the largest areas of bush cover the main ranges stretching north-northeast from [[Wellington]] towards [[East Cape]], notably including the [[Te Urewera|Urewera Ranges]], and the catchment of the [[Whanganui River]]. Significant stands remain in Northland and the ranges running south from the Coromandel Peninsula towards Ruapehu, and isolated remnants cap various volcanoes in Taranaki, the Waikato, the Bay of Plenty and the Hauraki Gulf.

From the word comes many phrases including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Orsman |first=H. W. |title=The Dictionary of New Zealand English |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1999 |location=Auckland |isbn=0-19-558347-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bush-bash – to make one's way through the forest, rather than on a track or trail (''cf.'' American English "bushwhack[ing]", "bushwack[ing]", or "bush-whack[ing]").
* bush shirt – a woolen shirt or [[Swanndri]], often worn by forest workers.
* [[bush lawyer (plant)|bush lawyer]] – the name of a number of native climbing plants or a layman who expounds on legal matters.
* bush walk – short day walks ([[hiking|hikes]]) in the bush
* going bush – to live in the bush for an extended period of time, which may include "living off the land" by means of hunting or fishing.
* Bushman - Used in the 19th century for New Zealand loggers. The term still stands for someone that lives in the bush as a means of preferable lifestyle.

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the term has specific connotations of rural areas which are not open [[veldt]]. Generally, it refers to areas in the north of the country that would be called [[savanna]]. "Going to The Bush" often refers to going to a game park or game reserve. Areas most commonly referred to as The Bush are the [[Mpumalanga]] and [[Limpopo]] [[Lowveld]], The [[Limpopo River]] Valley, northern [[KwaZulu-Natal]] or any other similar area of wilderness.

===Alaska and Canada===
{{Main|The Bush (Alaska)}}
The Bush in Alaska is generally described as any community not "on the road system", making it accessible only by more elaborate transportation. Usage is similar in Canada; it is called ''la brousse,'' if you are French or colloquially ''Le Bois,'' in [[Canadian French]]. In northern Ontario, “the bush” refers to the massive expanse of primarily coniferous trees that sprawl undeveloped towards the northern eastern and western borders of the province. The term is not generally used in the southern parts of the province.

==Related terms==
[[File:Bush icons.JPG|thumb|right|Icons of the Australian bush: [[bracken]], [[corrugated iron]], [[banksia]], felt hat, [[billycan|billy]], [[stockwhip]] and elastic-side boots.]]

The term "to go bush" has several similar meanings all connected with the supposed wildness of the bush. It can mean to revert to a feral nature (or to "go native"), and it can also mean to deliberately leave normal surroundings and live rough, with connotations of cutting off communication with the outside world – often as a means of evading capture or questioning by the police. The term ''bushwhacker'' is used in Australia and New Zealand to mean someone who spends his or her time in the bush. 

Another related term used in Australia is "Sydney or the bush", which equates with such terms as "Hollywood or bust" to mean staking total success or failure on one high-risk event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnews.com.au/details.php?e=161|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907120654/http://www.artnews.com.au/details.php?e=161|dead-url=yes|archive-date=7 September 2003|title=Sydney or the bush|date=29 November 2002|author=John McDonald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/ra/australia/pdf/sydney_bush.pdf |title=CONTEMPORARY AUSTRALIA 5. Sydney or the Bush? |author=Chris Baker |date=6 June 2006 |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |format=[[PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usage appears in several ''[[Peanuts]]'' cartoons, causing Charlie Brown much confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/peanuts/2012/08/29/|title=Peanuts|date=29 August 2012|author=[[Charles M. Schulz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many [[Vietnam War]] Veterans refer to the wilderness, jungle or border areas of the theatre of operations as "the bush", as opposed to towns, cities and military bases.

In New Zealand, "The Bush" is a nickname for the [[Wairarapa Bush Rugby Football Union|Wairarapa Bush provincial rugby team]]. The team was formed by an amalgamation of two earlier teams ([[Wairarapa]] and Bush), the latter of which represented an area on the boundaries of the Wairarapa and [[Hawke's Bay]] which was in former times known as Bush, due to its dense vegetation cover.

[[The Bushwhackers]] were also a New Zealand professional wrestling tag team that was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] class of 2015.

To ''bushwhack'' has two meanings, one is to cut through heavy brush and other vegetation to pass through the tangled country: "We had to do quite a bit of bushwhacking today to clear the new trail." The other meaning is to hide in such areas and then attack unsuspecting passers-by: "We were bushwhacked by the bandits as we passed through their territory and they took all of our money and supplies."

In the United States, the term has a similar meaning, for example in [[minor league baseball]], typically played in smaller cities, and sometimes derisively called "bush league" baseball.

"'''Triangle'''" is the third episode of the [[The X-Files (season 6)|sixth season]] of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction]] television series ''[[The X-Files]]''. It premiered on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network on November 22, 1998. Written and directed by series creator [[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]], "Triangle" is a "Monster-of-the-Week" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the [[Mythology of The X-Files|overarching mythology]] of ''The X-Files''. "Triangle" earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen household rating]] of 10.8, being watched by 18.20&amp;nbsp;million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode generally received positive reviews with many critics commenting on the episode's directing style.

The show centers on [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] special agents [[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) and [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called [[X-File]]s. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work and the two have developed a close friendship. In this episode, Mulder races to a luxury passenger liner which has mysteriously appeared in the [[Bermuda Triangle]]. Once there, he realizes he has traveled back in time to September 3, 1939—the outbreak of [[World War II]]. German soldiers have boarded the ship in search of "Thor's Hammer", something that could ensure victory in the coming conflict. Scully, after being informed of Mulder's disappearance by [[The Lone Gunmen]], rushes through the [[J. Edgar Hoover Building]], looking for someone who can help find her missing partner.

"Triangle" is filmed in a style inspired by the 1948 [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]'', with many scenes edited to appear as single takes. In addition, "Triangle" features the main and recurring cast members such as Anderson, [[William B. Davis]], [[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]], [[James Pickens Jr.]] and [[Mitch Pileggi]], who played their contemporary characters as well as distinctly different characters from 1939 on board the luxury liner. Several of the episode's themes have been critically examined, such as the concept of "dream-nazis", the appearance of modern characters portraying those from the past, and the ramification that the entire episode was a dream.

==Plot==
[[Fox Mulder]] ([[David Duchovny]]) lies unconscious in the sea after wrecking his raft. He is taken aboard a passenger ship, the ''Queen Anne'', by its British crew members. When he is sent to meet the captain, Mulder tries to explain that the ''Queen Anne'' vanished in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] in 1939, and claims that it has reappeared in 1998. The crew dismisses Mulder's story and suspect he is a [[Nazi]] spy. At that moment, the ''Queen Anne'' is boarded by [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] troops under the control of an ''[[Oberführer]]'' resembling [[The Smoking Man]] ([[William B. Davis]]), who sets the ship's course for [[Nazi Germany]]. The crew of the ''Queen Anne'' lock Mulder in the captain's quarters, where he listens to a radio broadcast announcing the start of [[World War II]]. Mulder realizes that the ''Queen Anne'' did not travel to 1998: he has traveled back to 1939.

In the present, [[The Lone Gunmen]] inform [[Dana Scully]] ([[Gillian Anderson]]) that they have lost contact with Mulder, who had set out in search of the ''Queen Anne''. Scully first turns to [[Walter Skinner]] ([[Mitch Pileggi]]), unsuccessfully, then attempts to confront [[FBI#Organization and rank structure|Assistant Director]] [[Alvin Kersh]] ([[James Pickens Jr.]]) who is seen with the Smoking Man. She finally threatens Agent [[Jeffrey Spender]] ([[Chris Owens (actor)|Chris Owens]]) before Skinner shows up and provides her with the information from the [[United States Department of Defense|Pentagon]]. Scully leaves with the Gunmen to find Mulder. On the ''Queen Anne'', a British sailor tells Mulder that the Germans are looking for what they believe is a weapon called "Thor's Hammer". Mulder tells him that Thor's Hammer is not a weapon, but a scientist that will build [[Nuclear weapon|a weapon]]. The sailor turns out to be a German spy and locks Mulder in the engine room with the ship's crew. One of the sailors, who strongly resembles Kersh, decides to steer the boat to Jamaica, but Mulder tells them to sail back where they came from, in order to pass through the time warp and re-appear in 1998.

Eventually, Mulder is taken to the ballroom by the Nazis. Once there, he is ordered to identify the scientist, or the Nazis will begin shooting passengers. After they have killed two men, a woman who looks strikingly like Scully tells the Nazis that they are killing innocent people for nothing, and that Mulder knows nothing. Mulder tells the Nazis that one of the men they shot was the scientist, but the true scientist steps forward. The Nazis prepare to execute Mulder and "Scully", but before they are able, the engine is shut down. British sailors descend upon the ballroom and begin fighting the Nazis. In the midst of the chaos, Mulder and "Scully" escape. Scully and the Lone Gunmen find the ''Queen Anne'' and board it, only to find that it is an empty ghost ship.

Back in 1939, as the British sailors fight the Nazis in the ballroom, Mulder tells "Scully" that she has to turn the ship around and return to the Bermuda Triangle in order to get the ship out of the rift in space. Mulder grabs "Scully" and kisses her, "in case we never meet again". "Scully" punches him, and he jumps overboard. Mulder wakes up in 1998 in a hospital, surrounded by Scully, the Lone Gunmen and Skinner. Mulder attempts to tell them that he traveled to 1939, and of his encounter with Nazis, and tells Scully that she was there with him, but they all think he is delirious. After Skinner and the Gunmen leave, Mulder calls Scully back and tells her that he loves her. Scully thinks his declaration is an effect of the drugs he has been given, rolls her eyes and leaves. As he lies down, Mulder winces as his cheek touches the pillow; the spot where "Scully" punched him in 1939 is still sore and visibly bruised. Mulder feels his eye-socket and breaks into a knowing smile.&lt;ref name="plot"/&gt;

===Conception, writing, and filming===
[[File:RMS Queen Mary Long Beach January 2011 view.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The scenes aboard the ''Queen Anne'' were actually filmed on board the RMS ''Queen Mary''.|alt=The picture is of a large luxury liner.]]

''The X-Files'' creator Chris Carter developed the idea for "Triangle" while working on the [[The X-Files (season 5)|fifth-season]] episode "[[The Red and the Black (The X-Files)|The Red and the Black]]".&lt;ref name="m39"&gt;[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; While filming the episode, Carter used so much film that the crew made him a mock trophy. This, in turn, inspired him to write an episode that featured continuous action, thereby using as little film as possible.&lt;ref name="m40"/&gt; Carter designed "Triangle" in a style similar to [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s 1948 film ''[[Rope (film)|Rope]]''.&lt;ref name="sun"&gt;{{cite news|last=Strachan|first=Alex|title=X-Files Producer Can't Let Go of Vancouver|url=http://www.turning-pages.com/carterconnection/112198sun.htm|accessdate=December 26, 2011|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=November 21, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] executives were hesitant to [[green-light]] production for "Triangle" because it was expected to exceed the $2.5&amp;nbsp;million episode budget. To persuade them, Carter told the executives that the episode would feature elements of Hitchcock's directing style, a move he later called "an easy hook".&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; Carter also cited the 1964 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' adaptation of "[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge]]" as inspiration.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;

The scenes taking place on the ''Queen Anne'' were filmed aboard the retired British [[ocean liner]] [[RMS Queen Mary|RMS ''Queen Mary'']], which is moored at [[Long Beach, California]] and currently serves as a hotel.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="interview"&gt;{{cite interview |last=Anderson |first=Gillian |subjectlink=Gillian Anderson|title=Electronic Press Kit for "Triangle"&lt;!-- |url=http://shippers.fredfarm.com/multimedia/index1.htm INCLUDED JUST FOR VERIFICATION, EVEN THOUGH WE CAN'T LINK TO IT SINCE IT'S A COPY VIO --&gt;|year=1998|publisher=[[Fox Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming on board the ship took place over eleven days. To block out the lights of nearby Long Beach, ''The X-Files'' crew erected wrap-around scaffolding on the ship's bridge.&lt;ref name="m40"/&gt; To give the effect of rain during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems that provided a constant supply of water.&lt;ref name="epcom"/&gt; Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had whole portions of the ship redesigned so that the finished episode would have a late-1930s feel.&lt;ref name="m40"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt;

For authenticity, several British and German actors portrayed the British sailors and Nazi soldiers, whose dialogue was mostly in German. Trevor Goddard, who portrayed the First British Crewman, is English, while Madison Mason, who played Captain Yip Harburg, is American; he affected an English accent for the part.&lt;ref name="Triangle"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Carter, Chris]]|date=1999|title=The Truth About Season Six|medium=DVD|publisher=[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; William B. Davis' dialogue was entirely in German, a language which he did not speak. He later explained, "I certainly didn't realize I was going to be speaking a lot of German until I got the script, which just said 'CSM (in German)'."&lt;ref name=CSMinterview/&gt; To successfully learn his lines, one of the German cast members recorded all of Davis' dialogue onto a [[Compact Cassette|cassette]]. Davis was given the cassette two weeks before shooting and phonetically memorized his lines; he noted that the method "seemed to work pretty well—at least to non-German-speaking people! It was a little more challenging because there were some real German speakers on the show, which I thought was a little unfair."&lt;ref name=CSMinterview&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hughes|first=Davis|title=William B. Davis: TV's Best Bad Guy, Cigarette-Smoking Man, Still Smolders as he Reveals New Dimensions|journal=[[Cinefantastique]]|date=October 1999|volume=31|issue=8|pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tom Braidwood]], who played Lone Gunman Melvin Frohike and was an assistant director on the show, called Davis' role "brutal" and noted that "It was really tough for William because he had to learn all this German."&lt;ref name="bigbook"/&gt; Davis later joked that "Maybe we shouldn't try to do two clever things at once. I think it worked fine, but it was a struggle to do it."&lt;ref name="bigbook"/&gt; The only main cast member of ''The X-Files'' who already spoke German was Mitch Pileggi.&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt; Pileggi had studied in Germany; he had to re-write many of his lines as they made no sense in the context of the scenes.&lt;ref name="bigbook"&gt;[[#Hurwitz|Hurwitz and Knowles (2008)]], p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; The tagline that usually appears after the opening credits of every episode, "The Truth is Out There", was translated into German: "Die Wahrheit ist irgendwo da draußen".&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt;

===Directing style===
[[File:ScullyFBITriangle.ogv|thumb|275px|right|alt=Video clip of a scene in the episode featuring Agent Scully crossing paths with Mulder and the 1939 version of Scully.|Agent Scully crosses paths with Agent Mulder and the 1939 version of Scully. The sophisticated split-screen [[mise en scène]] was inspired by the music video for [[Semisonic]]'s 1998 single "[[Closing Time (Semisonic song)|Closing Time]]."]]
Filmed in [[Real time (media)|real time]], the episode is designed to look like it was recorded in four uninterrupted eleven-minute [[Shot (filmmaking)|takes]].&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; Carter explained, "I said [to the cast and crew] 'Wouldn't it be great since we have 44 minutes of programming time if we just did an episode where we did four 11-minute takes and put it all together?' And everyone looked at me like I was nuts."&lt;ref name="bigbook2"&gt;[[#Hurwitz|Hurwitz and Knowles (2008)]], p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; To film the episode, camera operator Dave Luckenbach wore a [[steadicam]]. The steadicam used could only hold a maximum of four minutes of film, so discreet edits and cuts were necessary.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; Luckenbach later likened the physical aftermath of filming to playing football, "You'd have a game on Friday, and you'd wake up Saturday and really feel it."&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; The cuts were usually made during [[whip pan]]s or in scenes when the screen would go dark.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; With the exception of Mulder jumping off the ''Queen Anne'', the only noticeable editing occurs between scenes, when a side swipe shifts between the two different time periods.&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; Many of the takes needed to be nearly perfect; for example, of the takes made on the eighth day of filming, only two of ten were deemed satisfactory.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; Both the cast and crew admitted that filming an episode of ''The X-Files'' in real time was physically and mentally exhausting. Duchovny later joked that, after filming concluded, he "could win an Emmy for most bruises."&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; Gillian Anderson described the real time directing style as "challenging."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; She said, "I'm realizing how comfortable and connected I am to the rhythm we're used to."&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt;

In an interview before the episode was finished, Gillian Anderson said she was most looking forward to the scene in which Scully takes an elevator through FBI headquarters in her quest to locate Mulder.&lt;ref name="interview"/&gt; She later compared the episode to live theater,&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt; which she had worked in previously.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lowry|Lowry (1995)]], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of this scene, when the actors entered the stage elevator, the set that they would next move onto had to be constructed behind the closed doors. Many times during filming, these doors would open before the set behind had been completed, which ruined the shot.&lt;ref name="m40"&gt;[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The final two acts of the episode feature a sophisticated split-screen [[mise en scène]]: Rather than displaying two different events, each side of the screen features the same setting, but with each side set during a different time period. When Scully runs around the corner in the present day, she does so at the same time as Mulder and the 1939 version of Scully. This was filmed in such a way that as the actors pass each other in the hallway, they also pass into the opposite frame of the split screen.&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; This effect was inspired by the music video for [[Semisonic]]'s hit 1998 single "[[Closing Time (Semisonic song)|Closing Time]]."&lt;ref name="EW"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russo|first=Tom|title=Past Perfect|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,285813,00.html|accessdate=December 28, 2011|volume=459|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|date=November 20, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Editor Louise Innes, who was working on her first ''X-Files'' episode, said the post-production editing process was "not as easy as it sounds."&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; Innes was tasked with connecting roughly forty shots and creating the illusion of one, uniform scene.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; After the reels of film were combined, several pending issues had to be tweaked in post-production. For instance, during the scene in which Scully runs into an elevator, two shots were spliced together, but the color did not completely match. The images and their colors were later corrected by the series' "postproduction {{sic}} troubleshooters" using digital manipulation.&lt;ref name="EW"/&gt; When the episode was filmed, it was shot in 2.35:1 widescreen. When the episode aired, it was shown [[letterbox]]ed to fit in a 1.33:1 television screen; this was the first ''X-Files'' episode to receive this treatment. Carter reasoned that this method would allow for more action to be viewable in each frame.&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt;

===Music and cultural references===
To get a feel for the era, ''X-Files'' composer [[Mark Snow]] listened to the [[big band]] music of [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Harry James]], [[Gene Krupa]], and [[Glenn Miller]]. The "bouncy instrumental" that plays during the ballroom fight scene was inspired by a similar [[swing (music)|swing]] tune, written by [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]], from the 1979 [[Steven Spielberg]] film ''[[1941 (film)|1941]]''. Snow later joked that his composition was "the third generation of the same inspiration."&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt; Carter had significant musical input when it came to scene transitions, saying, "I got a chance to use some of my favorite '40s music here, too, or '30s and '40s music to transition scenes."&lt;ref name="Triangle"/&gt; Producer [[Paul Rabwin]] also supervised "a special arrangement" of the 1938 jazz standard "[[Jeepers Creepers (song)|Jeepers Creepers]]", which was also included in the ballroom scene.&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt;

The episode contains many intentional references to the 1939 musical film ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]''.&lt;ref name="sun"/&gt; The ship's captain is named after the film's lyricist [[Yip Harburg]], and the ballroom singer, Almira Gulch, after ''The Wizard of Oz'' character who is the analog for the [[Wicked Witch of the West]]. Her band is The Lollipop Guild, a reference to a section of the song "[[Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead]]", while Mulder's wrecked ship is called the ''Lady Garland'', after [[Judy Garland]].&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt; The final scene of "Triangle", which features Mulder in bed telling his friends and co-workers that he saw them in his reverie, bears a striking resemblance to the closing scene of ''Oz''. Because of this, the scene was called "obviously derivative" by one reviewer.&lt;ref name="song parody"/&gt; Further, when Mulder mentions that Skinner was with him in 1939, which is the year ''The Wizard of Oz'' was released, Skinner replies "with my dog [[Toto (Oz)|Toto]]", and Scully tells him "there's no place like home".&lt;ref name="epcom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="m41"&gt;[[#Meisler|Meisler (2000)]], p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="triangleep"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Triangle|credits=[[Chris Carter (screenwriter)|Chris Carter]] (Writer and Director)|series=The X-Files|serieslink=The X-Files|network=Fox|airdate=November 22, 1998|season=6|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode features several historical errors. Anderson's 1939 character is said to work for the [[Office of Strategic Services]], which was not established until 1942. The code name "Thor's Hammer" is an invention of the writers. Lee Smith, the official researcher for the show, was tasked with finding the name for the secret pre-World War II atomic research project. Unfortunately for the show, the actual code name, [[Manhattan Project|Development of Substitute Materials]], was considered "uninspiring," so the name "Thor's Hammer" was created instead.&lt;ref name="m41"/&gt;

==Themes==
[[Robert Shearman]] and [[Lars Pearson]], in their book ''Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium &amp; The Lone Gunmen'', examined the characterization of the villains in the episode and the [[meta-reference]]s to the series. Shearman and Pearson note that the episode makes a distinct difference when portraying the Nazis on-screen. Instead of showing them as "real Nazis"—like those featured in the third-season episode "[[Paper Clip]]", among others—this episode portrays them as deliberately exaggerated "dream-nazis".&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; The two argue that the villains are played as "comic book nasties" and are similar in style to the villains from the ''[[Indiana Jones (franchise)|Indiana Jones]]'' movie franchise.&lt;ref name="shearman"&gt;[[#Shearman|Shearman and Pearson (2009)]], pp. 169–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shearman and Pearson analyzed the portrayals of several of the series' regular characters as 1930s villains, noting several meta-references to the wider series. The two noted that, in his portrayal of a Nazi, Jeffrey Spender was allowed to "cut loose and rant like a proper villain rather than a sulky boy hiding in the basement."&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; In contrast, Walter Skinner's 1939 character behaved more like his character in the wider series, his role "charmingly parodying the ambiguity he's been playing all these years and turning out to be an American-loving ally who tells our heroes to get their 'asses out of here'."&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt;

Tom Kessenich, in his book ''Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Season 6–9 of The X-Files'', critically examined the ideas that the entire episode was either a dream or existed in some sort of "parallel universe".&lt;ref name="examinations2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="examinations3"/&gt; Kessenich reasons that, because the episode contains several overt references to ''The Wizard of Oz'' and the fact that Chris Carter noted that the episode was based on the idea of Mulder's subconscious mind at work, much of "Triangle" was simply a dream.&lt;ref name="examinations2"&gt;[[#Examinations|Kessenich (2002)]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Kessenich backs up his argument by pointing out that many of the characters on the ship were played by familiar faces—The Smoking Man as the Nazi leader, Spender as a Nazi "lap dog", Skinner as a double agent, Kersh as an "unfamiliar friend or foe", and Scully as Mulder's ultimate ally.&lt;ref name="examinations3"&gt;[[#Examinations|Kessenich (2002)]], p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; This would suggest, according to Kessenich, that the entire episode was acted out in Mulder's mind while he was unconscious in the Bermuda Triangle.&lt;ref name="examinations3"/&gt;

===Initial reception===
When the finished program was shown to the cast and crew, their response was very positive. Gillian Anderson said, "I never quite understood whether it was going to work or not. When we finally saw 'Triangle' after this new way of filming everything, a style that we'd never attempted before, as well as trying new scenes&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;trying this, trying that&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp; that was terrific."&lt;ref name="bigbook"/&gt; Chris Owens, who portrayed the Agent Spender Nazi lookalike, said, "One thing I really like about ''The X-Files'' was that they were always challenging themselves. Chris [Carter] would write an episode in which we're going to do ''Rope'' without any cuts, seemingly. A great challenge for a cast and crew."&lt;ref name="bigbook"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bigbook2"/&gt;

The episode received generally positive critical reviews from the press. Matt Zoller Seitz from ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'' gave an overwhelmingly positive review of "Triangle". Applauding Carter's risky and audacious direction, he noted that "there has never been an hour of TV that looks or moves like 'Triangle'".&lt;ref name=starled/&gt; He argued that the 1939 scene where Mulder and "Scully" cross paths with present-Scully was "the greatest minute of TV this year".&lt;ref name=starled/&gt; Seitz also compared the episode to three-dimensional video games, like ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', and ''[[Castle Wolfenstein]]'', citing the episode's "gloomy corridors" and "nightmarish cartoon Nazis".&lt;ref name=starled&gt;{{cite news|last=Seitz|first=Matt Zoller|title=Just Watch It&amp;nbsp;– 'X-Files' Episode Sails Into Bermuda Triangle, But Instead of Sinking, Soars with Brilliance|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/0EFDA6209EDC5D07/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=March 20, 2012|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=November 22, 1998}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Liedtke and George Avalos from ''[[The Charlotte Observer]]'' predicted that "'Triangle' seems destined to take its rightful place in the pantheon of greatest 'X-Files' episodes".&lt;ref name="song parody"/&gt; Enjoying the plethora of ''Wizard of Oz'' references, the two parodied a portion of "[[Over the Rainbow]]" in their column.&lt;ref name="song parody"&gt;{{cite news|last=Liedtke|first=Michael|title=Ace 'X-Files' Episode Takes Mulder Beyond Kansas, Toto|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/s/InfoWeb/aggdocs/NewsBank/0EB6D637923316A4/0F8479522BD09CA1?s_lang=en-US|accessdate=March 20, 2012|work=[[Charlotte Observer]]|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]]|date=December 2, 1998|author2=George Avalos|agency=[[Knight Ridder]]}} {{subscription needed}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|The parody included the lines: "Somewhere beneath the conspiracy, romantic hopes soar / Mulder and Scully often hug beneath the conspiracy, why, oh why, can't they do more?"&lt;ref name="song parody"/&gt;|group="nb"}} Not all reviewers were so positive; for [[Alan Sepinwall]], "Triangle" was the episode "that turned out to be a dream", making it "technically impressive but dramatically murky".&lt;ref name=starled2&gt;{{cite news|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|title=All TV&amp;nbsp;– 'X-Files' Creator Breaks His Vows|work=[[The Star-Ledger]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|date=December 11, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later reception===
Several years after its initial broadcast, "Triangle" has continued to receive positive reviews, with many critics calling it one of the show's best episodes. Jessica Morgan from [[Television Without Pity]] gave the episode an A–.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=X-Files TV Show&amp;nbsp;— Triangle&amp;nbsp;— X-Files Recaps, X-Files Reviews, X-Files Episodes |author=Morgan, Jessica |url=http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/triangle-1.php |work=[[Television Without Pity]] |publisher=[[NBCUniversal]] |accessdate=December 25, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120913114940/http://www.televisionwithoutpity.com/show/the-xfiles/triangle-1.php |archivedate=September 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earl Cressey from ''[[DVD Talk]]'' called it one of the highlights of season six.&lt;ref name=dvdtalk&gt;{{cite web|last=Cressey|first=Earl|title=X-Files: Season Six|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/4819/x-files-season-six/|work=[[DVD Talk]]|publisher=[[Internet Brands|Internet Brands Inc]]|accessdate=March 14, 2012|date=November 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shearman and Pearson rated the episode five stars out of five and called it a "shining gem of an episode."&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt;

Carter's helmsmanship of "Triangle" received mostly favorable critical attention. Shearman and Pearson praised his directing, pointing to the scene where Scully dashes through the FBI building as "the best scene of all".&lt;ref name="shearman"/&gt; Todd VanDerWerff of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', in an "A" grade review, appreciated the style of filming, and wrote that the long scenes give "the whole thing a sense of urgency that propels scenes that shouldn't work".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; In addition, he called the split-screen shot "darn near perfect"; VanDerWerff later labeled it "one of my favorite moments in the whole show".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Andrew Payne from ''Starpulse'' applauded the acting and directing, saying, "Chris Carter rarely directed his creation, leaving that mostly to Kim Manners, but when he did he showed a brilliant eye not usually seen on broadcast TV. This is the best example—a breathlessly-paced episode in which each act appears as one continuous shot.&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;This episode is a lot of fun, particularly in the act that finds Scully blitzing through the FBI building in order to get some information on Mulder's whereabouts. The acting is superb and nothing can beat those no-cut acts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Payne|first=Andrew|title='X-Files' 10 Best Episodes|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/Andrew_Payne/2008/07/25/x_files_10_best_episodes|work=Starpulse|publisher=Media Holdings LLC|date=July 25, 2008|accessdate=November 16, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219002540/http://www.starpulse.com/news/Andrew_Payne/2008/07/25/x_files_10_best_episodes|archivedate=December 19, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payne ultimately named it the fourth best ''X-Files'' episode.

In addition, many reviewers were pleased with the style and concept of "Triangle". Tom Kessenich lauded the atmosphere of the entry, calling it "60 minutes of ''The X-Files'' at its finest".&lt;ref name="examinations"/&gt; Kessenich noted that, despite the "gloom and doom" talk that the series was heading in the wrong direction, stylistically, the episode proved "just how exciting this show can be".&lt;ref name="examinations"&gt;[[#Examinations|Kessenich (2002)]], p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately concluded that it was "a wonderful blend of fantasy and reality" that allowed the viewer "to try and ascertain what is real and what is not."&lt;ref name="kesstop"/&gt; He later named "Triangle" one of the "Top 25 Episode of All Time" of ''The X-Files'', and ranked it in second place.&lt;ref name="kesstop"&gt;[[#Examinations|Kessenich (2002)]], p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; VanDerWerff noted that he thoroughly enjoyed the concept, pointing out that the "sheer level of crazy stuff that goes on in this episode makes it fun to watch".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; He wrote that "[n]othing else had ever been this skillfully done on television before", which resulted in a "terrific episode of television".&lt;ref name=avclub/&gt; Furthermore, he opined that "[e]verything comes together in the episode's fantastically entertaining final act", due to the presence of the dramatic fight scene, among others.&lt;ref name=avclub&gt;{{cite web|last=VanDerWerff|first=Todd|title='Triangle'/'TEOTWAWKI' {{!}} TV Club {{!}} TV |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/triangleteotwawki,81163/|work=[[The A.V.

Scully clearly believes this is a man lost in delirium, but Mulder ... is finally beginning to deal with some pretty powerful feelings he has for his partner."&lt;ref name="examinations"/&gt; Paula Vitaris, on the other hand, was frustrated; she complained "[w]hen are these kisses that are not kisses going to end?"&lt;ref name=cinepaula/&gt;

The ''VNREDSat-1'' was built in Toulouse by [[EADS Astrium]]. During the project 15 Vietnamese engineers were integrated and trained by the Astrium team.

'''Washington Park''' (also known as '''Washington Square''') is a small public, [[urban park]] (1 [[acre]]) located in Downtown [[Dubuque, Iowa]], United States.  The park encompasses an entire city block, bordered on the north by West 7th Street, on the west by Bluff Street, on the south by West 6th Street, and on the east by Locust Street. The park is located between the city's [[post office]] and the Dubuque Museum of Art.

It was individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977,&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; and it was included as a [[contributing property]] in the [[Cathedral Historic District (Dubuque, Iowa)|Cathedral Historic District]] in 1985.&lt;ref name=Hawks&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=85002501}}|title=Cathedral Historic District|publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=2017-01-03|author1=Lisa Hawks|author2=Pam Myhre-Gonyier}} with {{NRHP url|id=85002501|photos=y|title=photos}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The block where Washington Park is located today was one of the original 35 blocks plotted out by surveyor G.W. Harrison in 1833 when the city was founded.  From the beginning, the land was set aside for public use.  The first church and first jail in Iowa were located on this land.  In 1857, the area was designated as Washington Park.

In 1877, the Dubuque City Council had all the buildings on the block torn down.  Shrubs and flowers were planted, walkways were established, and a {{convert|40|ft|m|sing=on}}-high Oriental gazebo was built on the grounds for $200.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=77000515}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: |publisher=[[National Park Service]]|accessdate=July 12, 2016|author=James D. Miller |date=1977}} with {{NRHP url|id=77000515|photos=y|title=two photos from c.1890 and 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This gazebo, which was built by local architects Fridolin Heer and Edward Eaescher, was widely viewed as one of the finest pavilions in the area.  On August 24, 1877, approximately 2,000 people attended the formal dedication of the park.

In 1878, a public drinking fountain was erected in the park.  The city paid for half the cost, with the remaining half covered by private donations.  A statue of [[Henry D. Cogswell|Dr. Henry Cogswell]] was placed on top of this drinking fountain.  Cogswell had promised the city that he would donate a statue for the fountain (which was supposed to be of a local heroine who had walked some distance to stop a train before it could come to a washed out bridge and derail).  When the statue was uncovered for the first time, it turned out to be a statue of Cogswell.  The statue remained in place until 1900, when a group of vandals pulled the statue down and buried it under what would be a new sidewalk.  The following day, the new sidewalk was poured which entombed the object.  The water fountain was gone by 1912, however, the statue is rumoured to still be buried under a sidewalk at the park.

Public events at the square over the years included Buffalo Bill Cody's "Authentic Wild West Show" performing in 1896 and President [[William McKinley]] giving a speech in 1899.&lt;ref name=nrhpdoc/&gt;{{rp|3}}

By the beginning of the 20th century, the gazebo was gone.  Later, during the 1970s, the park underwent a $60,000 restoration.  New trees, flowers, and shrubs were planted.  New lights crafted to look like antique gas lamps were placed in the park.  A new steel 3/4 size replica of the original gazebo built by Bradley Iron Works was placed on the site.  This restoration was made possible by the Dubuque Jaycees who made a large financial contribution to the City of Dubuque.  Also the Dubuque Jaycees had put together a time capsule using a donated grave vault.  Boxes were handed out to the public who were asked to place items in the boxes and return to the Park when they would be placed in the time capsule.  Once the boxes filled the vault it was sealed and buried right next to the southern side of the gazebo under the rock with the plaque that explains it is not to be opened for 100 years.  That opening is set for the year 2076.

During the summer of 2005, Washington Park underwent further improvements.  The streets surrounding the park have been rebuilt, and the walkways in and around the park have been replaced.  Lampposts designed to look like late 19th and early 20th century models have also been placed in and around the park.  Again without the Dubuque Jaycees large financial contribution this progject would have been delayed.  The Dubuque Jaycees has a special interest in Washington Park. Numerous times the group has been called upon and responded financially for the betterment of the park.  The Group also decorates the park with a holiday theme each and every year.
