'''''A Separate Reality: Further Conversations With Don Juan''''' is a book written by anthropologist/author [[Carlos Castaneda]], published in 1971, concerning the events that took place during his apprenticeship  with a Yaqui Indian Sorcerer, [[Don Juan Matus]], between 1960 and 1965.

In the book Castaneda continues his description of his apprenticeship under the tutelage of Don Juan. As in his previous book, ''[[The Teachings of Don Juan: A Yaqui Way of Knowledge]]'', Castaneda describes the experiences he has with Don Juan while under the influence of the [[psychotropic plant]]s that Don Juan offered him, [[peyote]] ''(Lophophora williamsii)'' and a smokable mixture of what Castaneda believed to be, among other plants, dried mushroom of the genus ''[[Psilocybe]]''. The main focus of the book centered on Don Juan's attempts at getting Carlos to ''See'', a practice best described as, in Castaneda's own words, "perceiving energy directly as it flows through the universe".

The book contains an introduction, an epilogue and two separate parts. Part One, "The Preliminaries of 'Seeing'", describes his re-initiation into the apprenticeship from which he withdrew in late 1965, and also describes his introduction to another ''brujo'' (sorcerer) named [[Don Genaro]]. Part Two, "The Task of 'Seeing'", elaborates on the mental processes involved with ''Seeing'', and begins with Castaneda realizing that the plants are a necessary tool to arrive at ''Seeing''.

'''Adam Herbert Dickey''' (June 26, 1864 - February 8, 1925), best known as '''Adam H. Dickey''' was a [[Christian Science|Christian Scientist]] and private secretary to [[Mary Baker Eddy]].

==Biography==

Dickey was born in [[Toronto, Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsofbos8192bost#page/n629/mode/2up ''Proceedings of the Bostonian Society'']. Annual Meeting, January 19, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Methodism|Methodist]] but converted to Christian Science in the early 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gottschalk|Gottschalk, Stephen]]. (1969). ''The Emergence of Christian Science in American Religious Life, 1885-1910''. University of California. p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

He was private secretary to [[Mary Baker Eddy]] during the last three years of her life.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;Moore, R. Laurence. (1986). ''Religious Outsiders and the Making of Americans''. [[Oxford University Press]]. pp. 113-114. {{ISBN|0-19-503663-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 25, 1908 Eddy asked Dickey "will you promise me that you will write a history of what has transpired in your experiences with me, and say that I was mentally murdered?".&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Peel (Christian Science)|Peel, Robert]]. (1980). ''Mary Baker Eddy: The Years of Authority''. [[Holt McDougal|Holt, Rinehart and Winston]]. p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; Dickey kept his promise and authored ''Memoirs of Mary Baker Eddy'', which documents her battle against "[[malicious animal magnetism]]". He reported that in her last years, Eddy turned her house into a mental fortress. She employed loyal mental watchers to try and counteract her enemies evil thoughts.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt; 

Eddy made Dickey a director of the Mother Church on November 21, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin A. Larson|Larson, Martin Alfred]]. (1985). ''New Thought Or a Modern Religious Approach''. [[Philosophical Library]]. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; This was her last official communication to any of her Church officers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sibyl Wilbur|Wilbur, Sibyl]]. (1913). ''The Life of Mary Baker Eddy''. [[Christian Science Publishing Society]]. p. 380&lt;/ref&gt;

Dickey's ''Memoirs'' was published posthumously with the permission of his widow Lillian S. Dickey in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edwin Franden Dakin|Dakin, Edwin Franden]]. (1929). ''Mrs. Eddy: The Biography of a Virginal Mind''. C. Scribner's Sons. p. 529&lt;/ref&gt; It was suppressed by the [[The First Church of Christ, Scientist|Mother Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Haight, Anne Lyon. (1970). ''Banned Books: Informal Notes on Some Books Banned for Various Reasons at Various Times and in Various Places''. [[R.R. Bowker]]. p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian R. Laurence Moore "Christian Science officials, eager to be rid of their association with demonology after Eddy's death, suppressed Dickey's book, and it is not easy now to find a copy. However, the story that it tells is consistent with everything one knows about Eddy's final years."&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

{{Calvinism}}
'''Afrikaner Calvinism''' is a theoretical cultural and religious development among [[Afrikaner]]s that combined elements of seventeenth-century [[Calvinist]] doctrine with a "chosen people" ideology similar to that espoused by proponents of the [[Jews as the chosen people|Jewish nation]] movement.{{sfn|Du Toit|1985|p=209}} A number of modern studies have argued that this gave rise to the [[Great Trek]] while serving to legimitise the subordination of other South African ethnic groups, thus laying the foundation for modern [[Afrikaner nationalism]] and ''[[apartheid]]''.{{sfn|Williams|1991}} Dissenting scholars have asserted that Calvinism did not in fact play a significant role in Afrikaner society until the trauma of the [[Second Boer War]], citing the fact that early settlers dwelt in isolated frontier conditions and lived much closer to pseudo-Christian [[animist]] beliefs than organised religion.{{sfn|Hexham, Irving &amp; Poewe, Karla|1997}}

== Background ==

White settlement in [[South Africa]] may be traced to the 1652 arrival of the [[Dutch East India Company]] at the [[Cape of Good Hope]], seeking to establish a refreshment station.{{sfn|McNeill|1967|p=381}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The Dutch administration at the Cape did not initially envision or desire a large European settlement there.&lt;/ref&gt; The Company had its headquarters in [[Amsterdam]] and it was there that it recruited and equipped voyages for the Orient. Most of its Dutch employees were Protestant Calvinists; they were supplemented by Lutheran Germans and Scandinavians, as well as a large exodus of French [[Huguenot]] refugees fleeing persecution at home.{{sfn|McNeill|1967|p=381}}{{sfn|Greaves|2013|p=37}} Among their Afrikaner descendants, individual religious communities such as the ''Dopper''s became known for establishing their own doctrine in rifts with the [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa (NGK)|Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk]] ([[Dutch Reformed Church]]), leading to the formation of the separatist [[Reformed Churches in South Africa|Gereformeerde Kerk]] in the late nineteenth century.{{sfn|Du Toit|1985|p=214}}

==Settlement period==
The Dutch settlement of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] was the first colonial success in South Africa. The key to this success was the establishment of strict rules of trade between the settlement and the native population. No trade or [[Christian missionary]] ventures among the Africans were permitted without the permission of the company administrator. Stealing or shooting [[cow|cattle]] was especially forbidden as a cause of inevitable conflict with the natives. The early Europeans were appalled by the appearance and the customs of the Africans, and false rumours that the natives were cannibals reinforced their motive to avoid unnecessary contact. The Cape was a walled garden, with Africa on the outside and Europe within. This strict order minimised conflicts with the Africans during the early settlement period.

Yet, many of the settlers had arrived with a missionary motive. The synthesis of these attitudes of strict avoidance and a missionary conscience resulted in the widespread practice of indenturing the native Khoisan population, and within that master/servant relationship, to teach the Bible to them in hope that the message would filter back through the servant's family (along with reports of the superiority of European life) and thus bring about conversion.

The farmers who lived outside of the physical walls of the towns had a different arrangement than the townspeople. To them, occupation meant ownership, and ownership implied the right to protect their property. As they settled into the seemingly unoccupied territories surrounding the Cape, they enforced these assumptions of ownership and its rights when the wandering hunters or herding tribes would cross the [[Fish River, Eastern Cape|Fish River]] into farm territories in search of grazing land or game. Thus, the farms represented an extension beyond the towns of the wall of separation between the white and the black occupants of the land. As in the towns, [[plantation]] [[slavery]] was sometimes seen as a means of [[evangelism]].

Separation and rules of exchange were opposed very early in the Afrikaner mind to invasion and conquest. And, this [[anti-imperialism]] extended also to the theory of missionary obligation that developed within the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]: the [[kingdom of God]] will grow within the sphere of influence assigned to the church by divine providence, as children are taught the Gospel by their parents and family. If God deems it fitting for the Gospel to be received by the natives, and taught to their children, then this is his glory. Toward that end, Christians have a defining role given them from God, a calling, or covenantal responsibility as God's people, to keep themselves pure in the faith and just in their dealings with the heathen, and to be absolutely unyielding in their protection of what has been legitimately claimed in the name of the [[Trinity|Triune God]].

==Folk religion==
This history is essential to understanding the distinctive concept of "calling" that developed among the Afrikaners. These attitudes, very early adopted, went with them through later conflicts, formed in a way that seemed to them obviously crafted by the hand of God Himself. They believed themselves preserved by God's own wisdom and [[divine providence|Providence]]. The things they suffered, and the strong bonds between them that were formed through it all, seemed to confirm this idea at every turn. Their history as a people has a central place in forming the Boer religion. In this way, a distinctive folk character became attached to their Calvinistic beliefs.
     
This [[folk religion]] was not articulated in a formal way. It was the experience of the Afrikaners, which they interpreted through their assurance that their absolutely sovereign Creator and Lord had shown special grace to them as a particular people.

==Nationalism==
However, the [[French Revolution]] brought these habits of thought more self-consciously to the surface. France invaded the Republic of the United Provinces in January 1794, the Stadtholder fled to England and asked the British Government to send the Navy to take care of the possessions of the United East Indies Company that was in dire financial straits and in which he had a huge stake. The British took care of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] in 1795 and handed it back to the Batavian Republic after the Peace of Amiens. For about a year and a half, Enlightenment ideas were promoted by Janssens and De Mist, including changes in church government. In 1806, the British Navy invaded the Cape of Good Hope on its own, and appointed British land administrators there, who were zealous propagators of the Enlightenment. They loosened the trade and labour regulations, speaking of the blacks as 'noble savages' whose untainted natural souls they professed to admire. The British Government outlawed slavery in the British Empire in 1835. They called the blacks equals, and gave them access to the courts in suit against white landowners. And, they professed to believe in their own autonomous [[Reason]] above all else.

A more antithetical message could hardly be imagined, as the English Enlightenment found itself with the Afrikaners for the first time. From the Boer point of view, the Enlightenment invaded their shores, seized their properties, annexed their farms, imposed alien laws, liberated their slaves without compensation, justified these actions by appeal to Reason alone, and claimed in all of this to be more virtuous than their God. They were exposed to the Enlightenment, and it appeared to them to be a revolution against their God and way of life.

== Schism between Boer and Cape Calvinists ==

During the Great Trek, many people, mostly from the eastern part of the Cape Colony, went north, to areas not under control of the government of the British Crown Colony. Because the Cape Dutch Reformed Church was seen by the trekkers as being an agent of the Cape government, they also did not trust its ministers and emissaries, seeing them as attempts by the Cape government to regain political control. There were also religious divisions among the trekkers themselves. A minister from the Netherlands, [[Dirk Van der Hoff]] went to the Transvaal in 1853, and became a minister in the [[Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk]], which was constituted in 1856, and in 1860 recognised as the State Church of the [[South African Republic]], separate from the Cape Church.

Meanwhile, back in the Netherlands, the Dutch State church had also been transformed by the Enlightenment, a change represented in the minds of those opposed it, by the loss of any meaningful profession of faith as requisite for adult church members, and the singing of hymns (in addition to psalms) and other innovations in worship and doctrine. In the Netherlands a movement grew in reaction to this perceived dismantlement of Biblical faith. It was called the Afscheiding, in which the Rev. Hendrik de Cock separated himself from the State Church in 1834 in Ulrum, Groningen. There was also a movement called the [[Reveil]] (''Awakening''), supported by those who did not separate from the State Church, like [[Guillaume Groen van Prinsterer]], whose writings became known in South Africa. And much later the leader of another schism called the [[Doleantie]], [[Abraham Kuyper]], began to become known to the Afrikaners. Highly critical of the Enlightenment, the "revolution" as they called it, the Doleantie in the church had counterparts in education and in politics. The timing of this influence was significant, coming on the crest of a wave of evangelical revival, the Reveil in the Dutch Reformed Church which had been led in South Africa by the Scottish preacher, [[Andrew Murray (minister)|Andrew Murray]]. The slogan of the Doleantie, which eventually rang with unintended nationalist nuance for the Afrikaners was, "Separation is Strength".

==Doppers==
In the South African Dutch Reformed Church in Transvaal, the more conservative party (known as [[Doppers]]) were opposed to singing some hymns in church. They asked the Afgescheiden Gereformeerde Kerk in the Netherland to provide them with a minister. The Rev. [[Dirk Postma]] came from Zwolle to the South African Republic in 1858, and was accepted as a minister of the Hervormde Kerk, but on learning that he and his congregation could be required to sing hymns (rather than [[Exclusive psalmody|the Psalms only]]), he and the Doppers, numbering about 300 adults, among whom was the [[South African Republic]]'s President [[Paul Kruger]], broke away from the state church to form the [[Gereformeerde Kerk]] in Rustenburg in February 1859. There were thus now three Dutch Reformed Churches in South Africa – the Afrikaner Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk (the Cape Synod), the Boer [[Nederduitsch Hervormde Kerk]], which was the State Church of the South African Republic, and the Boer [[Gereformeerde Kerk]], the smallest of the three, led by Rev. Postma.

The originally contemptuous name, ''Dopper'', may come from the Dutch ''domp'' (''wick-snuffers'') for their opposition to candles and other innovations in worship, perhaps representing their contempt for the Enlightenment; or, ''Dopper'' may originate from Dutch ''dop'' (and thus ''drinkers''), perhaps on account of their strong opposition to small, individual communion cups.{{sfn|Lee|1992}}

The [[separatism]] of the Doppers, expressed in the severity of their doctrine, the austere [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] of their worship, and even in their distinctive dress and speech, set them in stark contrast to European influence. Nevertheless, the Doppers were symbolic of resistance to all things English in South Africa, and despite their small size and distinctiveness they were culturally sophisticated and disproportionately influential during and after the Great Trek. It was the Dopper church that established [[Potchefstroom University]].

[[Boer Republic]]s which arose after the Great Trek needed a comprehensive philosophy upon which to organise a puritanical Boer society. [[Paul Kruger]], first president of the [[South African Republic]] upon its reacquired independence after the brief British annexation, adopted the Calvinstic principles in its political form, and formulated a ''cultural mandate'' based on the Voortrekkers' conviction that they had a special calling from God, not unlike the people of Israel in the Bible. The Doppers waged an intellectual war against the perceived influx of [[uitlander]] culture which was flooding into the Transvaal through the mass settlements of foreign immigrants lured by gold and diamonds.

==Afrikaner Broederbond==
The [[Boer War]]s had left many of the Afrikaners utterly destitute. The ruined farmers were seen in the hundreds, following the war, lining the highways selling produce by the basket. After the four South African colonies united politically into the [[Union of South Africa]] and relinquished control to democratic elections, a small, anonymous group of young intellectuals called the [[Afrikaner Broederbond]], formed in the years following the [[Second Anglo-Boer War]] to discuss strategies for addressing the overwhelming social problem of ''poor whites'' and other Afrikaner interests. By the account of [[Irving Hexham]], according to [[Klaus Venter]] and [[Hendrik G. Stoker|Hendrick Stoker]] who were themselves disgruntled members of the secret organisation, in 1927 the Broederbond moved to Potchefstroom University, asking that the school would take over leadership of the then-struggling group. That year, the Broederbond formally adopted the Calvinist philosophy based on the work of Abraham Kuyper. The Broederbond believed, with deep-rooted conviction, that what their past had provided them through the interpretation of faith was a model of anti-imperialism, self-discipline and responsibility, which in the end would preserve justice for all – blacks, coloured, and whites – against Communist deceit. These strategies that arose from the Broederbond were directly responsible for the establishment of [[apartheid]], in 1948.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

After the [[Sharpeville massacre]] in 1960, under enormous international pressure, the Broederbond began a slow and quiet re-examination of their policy proposals. And yet no significant changes took place to reform the apartheid system until the [[Soweto]] riots in 1976. Some time after this, the Broederbond declared apartheid an irreformable failure and began work to dismantle it. The conviction had finally become established, although not universally that, if the Afrikaner people, language and religion were to survive, they must take the initiative to emerge from the laager, and invite South Africa in. The Broederbond (dropping the policy of secrecy and with the new name ''[[Afrikanerbond]]'') began proposing initiatives for land reform and the reversal of apartheid.

==Radical changes==
The reversal of apartheid has cast the [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk]] (NGK) into a period of change. While remaining confessionally Calvinist, the religious character of the church is now less cohesive and more difficult to assess. Having been thoroughly conflated with apartheid, historic Calvinism appears to have fallen out of favour. [[Liberation theology]], which embraces the Enlightenment idea of Revolution, has gained a foothold in some quarters, and appears to have advocates both the left and right ends of the political spectrum.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} American-style evangelicalism and [[Arminianism]] also appear to have made inroads, which with its more individualistic emphasis has less potential for a full-scale civil religion. Certainly the old synthesis of revealed and [[natural theology]] is largely repudiated; officially at least. But, the folk religion of the Afrikaners is not dead. Some scholars and revisionist historians are attempting to draw lines of distinction between Calvinism ''per se'', the history of the Afrikaners, and the civil religion of the apartheid regime in particular.

In 1985, 92% of [[Afrikaners]] were members of Reformed Churches. By late 2013, this figure had dropped to 40%, while actual weekly church attendance of Reformed Churches is estimated to be around 25%.{{sfn|Oosthuizen|2014}}

Today, many Afrikaners have found their spiritual homes in charismatic and Pentecostal churches.

'''Are-Katika''', '''Katika''' or '''Are-Suryavamshi''' is a sect hailing from [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] states in India. In Northern part of the country they are known as khatiks. The traditional trade of this community is goat and sheep butchery. They follow [[Hinduism]] and do not slaughter [[animal]]s, which is done by [[Muslim]] [[Qureshi]]s. After the animal is slaughtered, they separate the [[skin]] and other parts from carcass for selling the [[meat]] and its bye-products. The [[women]] folk sell the bye-products of [[goat]] and [[sheep]] in toddy shops. Chakna is a traditional delicacy prepared by the women with goat tripe and other animal digestive parts like intestines. Chaknawadi is a place named after this dish in [[Begum Bazaar]] of [[Hyderabad]], [[India]], where maximum families of this [[community]] hail from. Most of them work as daily wage earners in Mandis (slaughter houses) for their livelihood. 

Though more than sixty percent of the Khatiks in [[Telangana]] still follow the traditional unclean profession of meat selling, they do not come under Scheduled Caste (SC) status by the Government of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and are categorized in [[Other Backward Class]] (OBC) depriving them of benefits on par with other 12 states in the country where they come under [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Schedule Caste]] (SC) community.

'''Babai the Great''' (ܒܐܒܐܝ ܡܚܡܘܕܐ ca. 551 – 628) was an early church father of the [[Church of the East]]. He set several of the foundational pillars of the Church, revived the monastic movement, and formulated its [[Christology]] in a systematic way. He served as a monastic visitor and [[coadjutor]] with [[Mar Aba Qozma|Mar Aba]] as unofficial heads of the Nestorian Church after [[Gregory (Nestorian patriarch)|Catholicos Gregory]] until to 628 AD, leaving a legacy of strong discipline and deep religious [[Orthodoxy]]. He is revered in the modern [[Assyrian Church of the East]].

==Biography==
Babai the Great (not to be confused with [[Mar Babai I]], the first autonomous leader of the Church of the East) was born in Beth Ainata in [[Beth Zabdai]], on the west bank of the [[Tigris]], near [[Nisibis]].&lt;ref name=Kitchen&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bkZITAQ4XbgC&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=babai+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WSF-VJzpKMygyAT7_4G4CA&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=babai%20the%20great&amp;f=false Kitchen, Robert A., "Babai the Great", ''The Orthodox Christian World'', (Augustine Casiday, ed.), Chap. 21, Routledge, 2012] {{ISBN|9780415455169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born to a family of humble means, and studied at the Christian [[School of Nisibis]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kgRV7QohACcC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq=babai+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty9-VJHYHoqxyATpjoCwBQ&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwATgU#v=onepage&amp;q=babai%20the%20great&amp;f=false Bundy, David and Norris, Frederick w. Norris. "Babai the Great", ''Encyclopedia of Early Christianity'', Volume 1, (Everett Ferguson, Michael P. McHugh, Frederick W. Norris, ed.), Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998] {{ISBN|9780815333197}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the directorship of Abraham of Beth Rabban. Sometime around 571 A.D., when the [[Origen]]ist [[Henana of Adiabene]] became the new headmaster, Babai's teacher, [[Abraham the Great of Kashkar]], founded a new monastery on [[Mt. Izla]] above Nisibis. Babai taught for a while at the Xenodocheio of Nisibis. After that he joined the newly founded monastery of Abraham on Mt. Izla. When Abraham died in 588, Babai left and founded a new monastery and school in his home country Beth Zabdai.
In 604 Babai became the third [[abbot]] of Abraham's monastery on Mt. Izla.

Abraham the Great had started a monastic reform movement which Babai and other disciples carried through. Since [[Bar Sauma]] and the [[Synod of Beth Lapat]], monks and nuns had been encouraged to marry. When Babai returned to Mt. Izla in 604, he expelled monks that lived with women on the fringes of the monastery, and enforced strict discipline, emphasizing a deep life of prayer and solitude. The result was a mass exodus, not only of the married monks.&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt;

But the [[Church of the East]] was with Babai. In 604, the Catholicos [[Mar Sabrisho I]] died and a new Catholicos had to be elected. The choice fell between two men named Gregory: [[Gregory O'Kelly|Bishop Gregory]] of Nisibis and Professor Gregory of Seleucia. [[Khosrau II|King Khosrau II]], the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid emperor]], stated only that his preferred candidate was Gregory, possibly meaning the bishop.  The king's influential wife Shirin, however, disliked Gregory of Nisibis and preferred Gregory of Seleucia, who had once been her steward. The [[Synod]] (council) rejected the king's initial candidate, taking advantage of the ambiguity of name, and chose Gregory of Seleucia, who became [[Gregory (Nestorian Patriarch)|Mar Gregorius I]]. The king was accordingly displeased, and reluctantly supported the elected candidate (after applying a hefty fine to him), and said, [[Patriarch]] he is and patriarch he shall be – but never again do I allow another election.&lt;ref&gt;Wigram, p. 247&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Catholicos Gregorius died a few years later in 608, the bishops made the usual request to the king to allow them to elect a new Catholicos, but [[Khosrau II|Khosrau]] had not forgotten the events of the previous election and refused them leave to do so.  The royal physician Gabriel of Shiggar, a staunch [[Miaphysite]], suggested to make [[Henana of Adiabene]] or one of his students Catholicos, and also used his influence with the king to prevent an election.

From 610 to 628 the last and most devastating wars between [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantium]] and [[Persian Empire|Persia]] took place. First Persia conquered parts of Byzantium, which were populated mostly by [[Monophysite]] and [[Chalcedonian]] Christians. To be popular in the newly gained provinces, King Khosrau II did not want to favor the Nestorians any more. During the successful Byzantine counterattack 622—628, Chalcedonians and especially Monophysites were on the advance in Persia and several sees and villages were lost by the Church of the East. The king successfully blocked an election in the church,&lt;ref name=Kitchen/&gt; preventing the church from having any figure who could allow new [[bishop]]s and [[metropolitan bishop|metropolitans]] to be consecrated.

During the decades of this vacancy, the [[Nestorian church]] required a sort of authority. Because the king remained staunch in his policy, the church chose to separate itself from the king's royal proscription. Two ''[[Regent|vekils]]'' (regents) were selected as a stop-gap measure: [[Archdeacon]] [[Mar Aba Qozma|Mar Aba]], who handled matters in the South. In the North, Babai the Great was chosen to lead, who at the time was [[abbot]] of a monastery on [[Mt. Izla]]. He was nominated inspector-general or [[visitor]] of the monasteries of the three northern provinces by the Metropolitans of [[Nisibis]], [[B. Garmai]], and [[Adiabene]].&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RBrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA156&amp;dq=babai+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WSF-VJzpKMygyAT7_4G4CA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=babai%20the%20great&amp;f=false Wood, Philip. ''The Chronicle of Seert: Christian Historical Imagination in Late Antique Iraq'', p.159, Oxford University Press, 2013] {{ISBN|9780199670673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Babai, even though not yet a bishop, acted as patriarch in all ecclesiastical matters, though he could not ordain or consecrate. He was appointed 'visitor of the monasteries' of the North, and administered the church in collaboration with Archdeacon Mar Aba. In particular, this new position allowed Babai to investigate the orthodoxy of the monasteries and monks of northern Mesopotamia, and to enforce discipline throughout the monasteries of northern Mesopotami&lt;nowiki/&gt;a, even against occasional resistance.

Babai the Great and Mar Aba administered the Nestorian Church for 17 years.  Attempts were made during that time to ask the king to change his mind and allow an election, but influences in the court, such as [[Gabriel of Shiggar]], and the king's wife [[Shirin]] (who was under Gabriel's influence) blocked the requests. Gabriel was seeking to maneuver things such that the decision of Catholicos would have been in his own (monophysite) hands, an option completely unacceptable to the bishops.&lt;ref&gt;Wigram, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt;

The king defended this policy until his death in 628. The situation, and vacancy, endured until Khosrau II was murdered in 628. After this, Babai was promptly, and unanimously, elected Catholicos, but he declined. Soon afterward, he died in the cell of his monastery on Mt. Izla,&lt;ref name=Wood/&gt; being 75 or 77 years old.

==Babai's teaching==
Besides bringing discipline to the monasteries and administering the church, Babai is mainly known for his orthodox teaching.

===Babai's writing===
To defend and clarify the Nestorian tradition against Henana's Origenism and the advancing [[Monophysites]], Babai the Great produced some 83 or 84 volumes of writing. He developed a systematic Christology, the only one in Nestorian Mesopotamia. Of his extensive exegetical works on all of Scripture nothing survived. What remains are two hagiographies, his principal work on the foundations of ascetic life 'On the Life of Excellency', and commentaries on mystical themes.

From what has been preserved it appears that his main authority was [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]],&lt;ref name=Phan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nfva8m7UOboC&amp;pg=RA1-PT213&amp;dq=babai+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty9-VJHYHoqxyATpjoCwBQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=babai%20the%20great&amp;f=false Phan, Peter C., ''Christianities in Asia'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011] {{ISBN|9781444392609}}&lt;/ref&gt; though in general he used few citations from the Fathers. There is no evidence that he could read Greek, and Babai must have relied on translations.

He mainly fought against the ideas of the Monophysites and of the Origenist Henana. They were the inner enemies. He also wrote against Mani, Marcion, Bar Daisan, the Messalians and the general loss of discipline since Beth Lapat.

The ''Book of Union'' is Babai's most systematic surviving christological treatise, divided into seven memre that cover more than 200 folios. The 'Tractatus Vaticanus' is another manuscript that deals with the  "impossibility of the [[hypostatic union]] and natural union, the possibility of the parsopic union, and the significance of the expression ''hypostatic union'' among the fathers of the antiquity".

An important source on the position of Babai the Great against [[Origen]] and his follower [[Henana of Adiabene]] is his commentary on [[Evagrius Ponticus]]. It also shows his opposition to [[Messalianism]]. An 8th-century manuscript has been preserved that contains Evagrius' text together with Babai's commentary on it. This commentary is an abridged version of a larger one which Babai had written earlier and which is lost.

The writings of Evagrius were important to the current mystical revival among Greek and Syrian monks. For the monks of Mt. Izla,  Evagrius was the pillar of mystical theology. The Greek text was condemned already in 553 for its Origenist heresies.

But unlike the Greek, the 'Common Syriac Version', a translation of the Gnostic chapters of Evagrius by the Monophysite [[Philoxenus of Mabbug|Philoxenus]], was void of the specific Origenist-Evagrian Christology. For example, it omits the 'nous-Christos' Christology where the God-logos and the flesh are united in the nous, Jesus Christ, the subject of incarnation. Babai tried to eliminate the Origenist ideas even further and presented Evagrius as opposed to Origen and his follower Henana by pointing out apparent contradictions between them.

"The Devil is telling the people that some of Evagrius' statements are similar
to heresies. Some even tried to translate directly from the Greek to show the
heresy of Evagrius. They translated according to their foolishness, but can
be refuted by other writings of Evagrius. The cursed Origen and his disciple,
the fool Apollinaris, they teach completely different from Evagrius on the
renewal of the soul after death".

To show this further, Babai tells the vita of Evagrius and enumerates his sources: Basilius, Gregorius, and Nectarius. No mention of Origen.

===Babai's Christology===
[[File:Chaldean Catholic Cathedral of Saint Joseph 2005 (Ankawa, Erbil, Iraq).jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Holy Apostolic Catholic Assyrian Church of the East. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551–628) and is clearly distinct from the accusations directed toward Nestorius.]]
The main theological authorities of Babai were [[Theodore of Mopsuestia]] and [[Diodorus of Tarsus]]. He also relied on [[John Chrysostomos]], the Cappadocian fathers and on [[Ephrem the Syrian]], which were also accepted in the West. In his exegetical methods he synthesized between the rational Theodore and mystical writers like Evagrius.

And most important, instead of breaking with Theodore because of some extreme interpretations of his teachings, like others did, Babai clarified his position to the point that differences with western Christology became superficial and mostly an issue of terminology. His Christology is far less dualistic than the one Nestorius seems to have presented.

Babai in the 'Book of Union' teaches two ''qnome'' (hypostasis—not the Chalcedonian use of this term, essence), which are unmingled but everlastingly united in one ''parsopa'' (person, character, identity, also "hypostasis" in Chalcedonian usage.) It is essential to use the Syrian terms here and not any translations, because the same words mean different things to different people, and the words must be accepted in the particular sense of each. In Greek Christology, ''hypostasis'' is used specifically to refer to what would correspond to Babai's ''parsopa'', and ''ousion'' would correspond to ''qnome''. In the period in which Babai and others formulated their respective Christological models, words such as "hypostasis" and "ousion" had less specifically fixed definitions. Thus, it was possible for two individuals to honestly use a single term to mean two distinctly different things. According to Jaroslav Pelikan, "Syriac was a richer and more complex language than either Greek or Arabic, and it allowed for more precise distinction".&lt;ref name=Pelikan&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Lr3ebI4iiwcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=babai+the+great&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ty9-VJHYHoqxyATpjoCwBQ&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAzgU#v=onepage&amp;q=babai%20the%20great&amp;f=false Pelikan, Jaroslav. ''The Christian Tradition: A History of the Development of Doctrine'', Volume 2: "The Spirit of Eastern Christendom (600-1700)", p.44, University of Chicago Press, 1977] {{ISBN|9780226653730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To Babai, Christ is both God and man. But he could not tolerate any form of [[Theopaschism]] (the belief that God suffered), be it the divinity itself, the [[Trinity]], or one of the hypostases of the Trinity. According to Babai, [[Cyril of Alexandria]] stood at the root of simple Theopaschism as professed by the Monophysites, and the Emperor [[Justinian I]] at the root of composite Theopaschism. The Nestorian church could accept expressions like 'Christ died', 'the Son died', but not 'the Word died', even not 'the Word died in the flesh'.

In the sixth century AD, Mar Babai wrote the '''Teshbokhta or (Hymn of Praise)''' explaining the theology of the Church of the East He writes:
:One is Christ the Son of God,
:Worshiped by all in two natures;
:In His Godhead begotten of the Father,
:Without beginning before all time;
:In His humanity born of Mary,
:In the fullness of time, in a body united;
:Neither His Godhead is of the nature of the mother,
:Nor His humanity of the nature of the Father;
:The natures are preserved in their Qnumas (substance),
:In one person of one Sonship.
:And as the Godhead is three substances in one nature,
:Likewise the Sonship of the Son is in two natures, one person.
:So the Holy Church has taught.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nestorian.org/index.html Nestorian.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first mentions of the religion happened when the book ''En resa in Persia'', published 1869, which mentions the [[Báb]],&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt; who Bahá'ís view as the herald to the founder of the religion. Bahá'u'lláh is first mentioned in a published account of Persian travels in 1869 in the magazine [[Kringsjaa|Kringsjå]] No. 2 from July 31, 1896.

In 1912 Louise M. Erickson attended the dedication of the first [[Bahá'í House of Worship]] in the West - in Chicago, United States. The first comprehensive article covering the religion was in the July 2, 1913 issue of [[Aftonbladet]].&lt;ref name="Swed-press"&gt;{{cite web|last=Djazayeri |first=Ezzatollah |title=Bahá'í i den Svenska pressen |work=Extracts from ''Bahá'í history in Sweden'' |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Sweden |year=1992 |url=http://www.bahai.se/historia/press-historia.htm |doi= |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711200004/http://www.bahai.se/historia/press-historia.htm |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It covers the history of the period of the Báb, through Bahá'u'lláh imprisonment and banishments, and `Abdu'l-Bahá's freedom and visit to Paris.

===`Abdu'l-Bahá's Tablets of the Divine Plan===
[[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, wrote a series of letters, or [[tablets (religious)|tablets]], to the followers of the religion in the [[United States]] in 1916-1917; these letters were compiled together in the book titled [[Tablets of the Divine Plan]]. The seventh of the tablets was the first to mention several countries in [[Europe]] including beyond where `Abdu'l-Bahá had visited in 1911-12. Written on April 11, 1916, it was delayed in being presented in the United States until 1919 &amp;mdash; after the end of [[World War I]] and the [[Spanish flu]]. The seventh tablet was translated and presented by [[Mirza Ahmad Sohrab]] on April 4, 1919, and published in [[Star of the West (Bahá'í magazine)|Star of the West]] magazine on December 12, 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbas | first = 'Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url = http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"In brief, this world-consuming war has set such a conflagration to the hearts that no word can describe it. In all the countries of the world the longing for universal peace is taking possession of the consciousness of men. There is not a soul who does not yearn for concord and peace. A most wonderful state of receptivity is being realized.… Therefore, O ye believers of God! Show ye an effort and after this war spread ye the synopsis of the divine teachings in the British Isles, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Portugal, Rumania, Serbia, Montenegro, Bulgaria, Greece, Andorra, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, San Marino, Balearic Isles, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Malta, Iceland, Faroe Islands, Shetland Islands, Hebrides and Orkney Islands."&lt;ref name="tablets"&gt;{{cite book |author = `Abdu'l-Bahá |authorlink = `Abdu'l-Bahá |origyear = 1916-17 |year = 1991 |title = Tablets of the Divine Plan |edition = Paperback |publisher = Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location = Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn = 0-87743-233-3 |url =http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/ab/TDP/tdp-6.html | page = 43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Pioneers===
Following the release of these tablets a few Bahá'ís began moving to or at least visiting countries across Europe. August Rudd, born in Värmland on 7 August 1871,&lt;ref name="rudd"/&gt; became the first Swedish Bahá'í pioneer in July 1920, with permission of `Abdu'l-Baha, on returning from Kenosha and Chicago, United States&lt;ref name="kenosha"/&gt; where he and his brothers had sold their inventions.&lt;ref name="rudd"/&gt; Rudd settled in [[Boda glasbruk|Boda]] and worked in a local school. He was followed a year or two later by Edvard Olsson.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt; In 1923, Louise Eriksson visited August Rudd and teacher Anna Elisabeth Gustavsson, perhaps the first convert in Sweden circa 1920-22, and brought them a copy of ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' by [[John Esslemont]]. August and Ann married though August died on February 13, 1926. [[Nya Wermlands-Tidningen]] published a letter in the May 2, 1924 issue by Anna Rudd.&lt;ref name="Swed-press"/&gt; [[Helsingborgs Dagblad]] covered [[Martha Root]]'s visit to Sweden where she participated in an [[Esperanto]] congress in Stockholm. Root made a return trip also covered by Dagblad printed on July 31, 1934. Youness Khan Afrukhtih, formerly one of `Abdu'l-Bahá secretaries, arrived in Oslo in September 1929. He had several interviews, including on the [[BBC]], 2.September 1929 and a Weekly Review, 5. September 1929.&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt;  In 1929 Anna Rudd left Östervallskog and moved to Malmköping and then to Göteborg, where she married Bahá'í Bernard Arvid Palmgren. In October 1932 they moved to Ramen in Värmland and finished translating and publishing ''Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era'' followed by the [[Kitáb-i-Íqán]] in 1936.&lt;ref name="rudd"/&gt; In 1935 Louise Eriksson, on another visit in Sweden, had the opportunity to meet former Chief Magistrate [[Carl Lindhagen]] and on March 19, 1935, she received an audience with then [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|Crown Prince Gustaf-Adolf]] - reported by the Aftonbladet on March 21, 1935,&lt;ref name="Swed-press"/&gt;  Anna Rudd Palmgren died 27 August 1943. Following [[World War II]], [[Shoghi Effendi]], then head of the religion, oversaw the creation of the European Teaching committee which supervised pioneers to Europe. From their work, Amelia Bowman arrived in Stockholm in October 1947, and with the assistance of [[Dorothy Baker]] was able to bring about the election of the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] in [[Stockholm]] in 1947-8.&lt;ref name="bowman"&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Amelia Bowman |work= |publisher=National Spiritual Council of the Baha'is in Norway |url=http://www.bahai.no/326.0.html |doi= |accessdate=2009-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724174952/http://www.bahai.no/326.0.html |archivedate=2011-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowman then traveled to [[Göteborg]] where she was again able to bring the community together and elect its first assembly in 1948-9 - (it lapsed but was re-elected in 1952.)&lt;ref name="historie"/&gt; Bowman then moved to Oslo Norway in 1949 and spent the next 33 years pioneering in various countries of Europe.&lt;ref name="bowman"/&gt;

==Development==
The third inter-continental teachings conference was held in Stockholm 21–26 July 1953 at which a number of talks were given for the general public as well as the Bahá'ís&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= |first= |authorlink= |title=Den tredje interkontinentale undervisningskonferansen |work= |publisher=National Spiritual Assembly of Norway |url=http://www.bahai.no/324.0.html |doi= |accessdate=200-9-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041022155903/http://bahai.no/324.0.html |archivedate=2004-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including a long letter from Shoghi Effendi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

As the religion spread across Scandinavia it reached the point where a regional National Spiritual Assembly for Norway, [[Finland]], [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]] was established in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hassall | first = Graham |author2=Universal House of Justice | title = National Spiritual Assemblies statistics 1923-1999 | work = Assorted Resource Tools | publisher = Bahá'í Library Online | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation | accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate National Spiritual Assembly of Sweden was first elected in 1962. By the end of 1963 there were Local Spiritual Assemblies in [[Göteborg]], [[Malmö]], [[Stockholm]], and [[Uppsala]]. Smaller groups of Bahá'ís were in [[Alafors]], [[Brastad]], [[Sundbyberg]] - and an additional 16 isolated individuals spread through the country.&lt;ref name="stats"/&gt;

Worldwide in 1979 there were 129 officially recognized Bahá'í socio-economic development projects. By 1987, the number of officially recognized development projects had increased to 1482. The Swedish community of Bahá'ís have undertaken a number of projects both internally and for the good of others whether collectively or individually.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14194">The '''Bahá'ís Under the Provisions of the Covenant''' ('''BUPC''') is a small [[Bahá'í divisions|Bahá'í sect]] founded by [[Leland Jensen]] in the early 1970s. The claims of the BUPC focus on a dispute in leadership following the death of [[Shoghi Effendi]] in 1957, and a subsequent dispute among the followers of [[Mason Remey]]. As a follower of Remey, Jensen believed that the majority of Bahá'ís were deceived, and he attempted a new administration that was [[Covenant-breaker|shunned]] by the majority of Bahá'ís. Jensen also made specific [[Leland Jensen#Predictions|predictions]] for worldwide catastrophes, including a specific date in 1980 for the [[apocalypse]], where followers were observed by researchers as a study in [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref name="stone269"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000|pp=269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers from the University of Montana who observed the group in various studies over the course of 16 years noted that from 1980 to 1996 membership fluctuated, but probably never exceeded 200 nationwide.&lt;ref name="stone271"/&gt; Adherents were mostly concentrated in [[Missoula, Montana]], with groups at times in Wyoming, Arkansas, Minnesota, Colorado, and Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="stone271"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000|pp=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stone280"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group consisted of roughly 150 people leading up to 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; but declined in size significantly following the disconfirmed prophecy, with almost all of the believers outside of Montana eventually rejecting Jensen's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990 the researchers claimed the BUPC probably had fewer than 100 members.&lt;ref name="stone280"/&gt; With defection accelerating in the 1990s, they noted that in 1994 a membership phone list showed 66 members in Missoula, Montana, and less than 20 in other states,.&lt;ref name="stone271" /&gt; A schism over leadership of the group in 2001 resulted in other defections and an unresolved [[#Leadership dispute|court battle]] for control of funds. Researchers documenting religious groups in Montana in 2003 noted a community of 30 members in the headquarters of [[Missoula, Montana]].&lt;ref name="pluralism"&gt;{{harvnb|Hyslop|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
The BUPC profess adherence to all the writings of the [[Bahá'í Faith]]'s central figures: the [[Báb]], [[Bahá'u'lláh]], and [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], as well as [[Shoghi Effendi]]. The religious differences between the BUPC and the [[Bahá'í Faith]] are essentially over leadership, although certain teachings introduced by Jensen do differ greatly, which are not accepted by the wider Baha'i community.

Unique to the BUPC, Jensen taught that the institution of the guardianship is the continuation of the [[Davidic line]], which he claimed Bahá'u'lláh passed onto his son, who in turn passed the lineage on to the institution of the guardianship.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt;

===Guardianship===
{{main|Bahá'í divisions}}
Charles Mason Remey, one of [[Shoghi Effendi]]'s [[Hands of the Cause]], declared himself the successor to Shoghi Effendi in 1960. His claim was rejected by his fellow Hands, with the reasoning that he was not a descendant of Bahá'u'lláh, or [[Aghsan]], nor did he have a clear appointment to the position by Shoghi Effendi. Remey based his claim on his being the president of the [[International Bahá'í Council]] appointed by Shoghi Effendi in 1951. The result was that Remey and any followers were unanimously expelled from the Bahá'í community by the Hands of the Cause.&lt;ref name = "PSmith" &gt;{{harvnb|Smith|1999|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal House of Justice]] later announced that it could not appoint or legislate to make possible the appointment of a second Guardian to succeed Shoghi Effendi.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Universal House of Justice]], Letter of 6 October 1963, [http://bahai-library.com/uhj_messages_1963-86_full#s5.1 ''Messages from the Universal House of Justice 1963-1986''] p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen was among the Bahá'ís who accepted Remey to be the 2nd Guardian, and to reconcile the requirement that Guardians be Aghsan he believed Remey had been adopted by `Abdu'l-Bahá, and further that Remey's adopted son Pepe was the third Guardian, a point denied by Pepe.

==Leland Jensen==
{{Main|Leland Jensen}}
In 1963 Mason Remey set up a National Assembly in the United States, which was dissolved in 1966. Leland Jensen was among the members elected in 1963, and in 1964 he left the group during a time of disputes among the members and moved to [[Missoula, Montana]].&lt;ref name="stone271" /&gt; In 1969 he was convicted of performing "a lewd and lascivious act" for sexually molesting a 15-year-old female patient,&lt;ref name="stone271" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fastcase.com/Yahoo/Start.aspx?C=26917489637405405daded611067aa76e77e8a5606aee00f&amp;D=77eca924714beb4591a4da5747d53c9c77862a89c3a754d6&amp;AffiliateConst=Yahoo ''State v. Jensen'', 153 Mont. 233, 455 P.2d 631 (Montana, 1969)]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and served four years of a twenty-year sentence in the Montana State Prison.

It was in prison that Jensen claimed to have a revelation, and converted several dozen inmates to his idea of being the "Establisher" of the Bahá'í Faith,&lt;ref name="stone271"/&gt; stemming from his belief that the administration of the religion had been corrupted, and that he was chosen by God to re-establish the administration.

==Disconfirmed prophecies==
Jensen began teaching as early as 1971 that in 1980 the world would be cleansed of evil by a [[nuclear holocaust]].&lt;ref name="stone271" /&gt; Jensen gained national attention when on April 26, 1980 he led a group of followers into fallout shelters, expecting an apocalyptic nuclear holocaust.&lt;ref name="stone269"/&gt; He went on to predict that [[Halley's Comet]] would enter earth's orbit on April 29, 1986, and collide with the earth exactly one year later.&lt;ref name="stone277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

With Jensen's approval, in the early 1990s his companion Neal Chase made a total of 18 predictions which pertained to small-scale disasters that he claimed would lead step-by-step towards the [[Apocalypse]], as well as dates for a nuclear attack on New York City by middle Eastern terrorists.&lt;ref name="stone272"&gt;{{Harvnb|Stone|2000|pp=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Balch noted that Chase responded to the 18 disconfirmed prophecies with a number of "face-saving strategies",&lt;ref name="stone275"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; including drawing a distinction between prediction and prophecy, claiming miscalculation, reprieve, and tests of faith. Chase later proclaimed "We didn't make a mistake," and that they have "a 100 percent track record!"&lt;ref name="stone275" /&gt;

==Leadership dispute==
===sIBC and Joseph Pepe===
In 1991 Jensen appointed 12 members to a second International Bahá'í Council (sIBC) modeled on the [[International Bahá'í Council]] set up by Shoghi Effendi,&lt;ref name="stone282n5"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=282}} note 5&lt;/ref&gt; and Jensen registered it in 1993 as a non-profit corporation in Montana.&lt;ref name="opinion"&gt;Opinion/Order, Montana Supreme Court, 2/15/2005 Case No. 04-214. Cases are accessible online at [http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/custom/SLL/SLL_FN_home.htm State Law Library of Montana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402023824/http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/custom/sll/sll_fn_home.htm |date=2009-04-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; He intended for it to evolve into the elected Universal House of Justice with the Guardian as its president. Believing Joseph Pepe was the Guardian, Jensen invited him to be the president of the council, but Pepe steadfastly denied being the Guardian and had no involvement with the group. 

===Neal Chase===
Joseph Pepe died in 1994, leaving no clear candidate for leadership after Jensen's own death in 1996, and no way to appoint new members to the board. Jensen's schism from the mainstream [[Bahá'í Faith]] was based on the belief that the religion required a line of appointed hereditary Guardians, and Jensen's chosen candidate for the role was Pepe, who refused to be involved with Jensen's sect. 

After Pepe died in 1994 Jensen began hinting that Neal Chase might be the next Guardian.&lt;ref name="stone282n6"&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|2000|p=282}} note 6&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, justifying his claim to leadership, Neal Chase claimed to have been secretly adopted by Pepe.&lt;ref name="pluralism" /&gt; 

In 2001, the long-running dispute about the identity of the Guardian broke the group into schism when Chase claimed the role in 2001.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; The treasurer of the council responded by declaring Neal Chase a [[Covenant-breaker]], and Chase subsequently claimed that failing to recognize him as the Guardian amounted to Covenant-breaking.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Appellant Brief, p. 8, 4/23/2004. Respondent Brief, p. 9, 5/21/2004. Montana Supreme Court, Case No. 04-214. Cases are accessible online at [http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/custom/SLL/SLL_FN_home.htm State Law Library of Montana] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402023824/http://fnweb1.isd.doa.state.mt.us/idmws/custom/sll/sll_fn_home.htm |date=2009-04-02 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority members of the sIBC filed a complaint on April 26, 2002, seeking an order granting damages against Chase, including interest and attorney's fees; and an injunction forbidding Chase to represent the council.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; Chase filed a motion to dismiss on July 15, 2003, arguing that a judicial resolution would require a court to interpret religious doctrine. The motion was granted September 29, 2003.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt; The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of Montana in 2004, and a decision came February 15, 2005,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Chase argues that the Guardianship, a religious office, vests him with the presidency of the corporation, a secular one, and that it is through holding the latter that he rightfully controls the corporate property. The presidency thus serves in this instance as the temporal nexus between the world of faith, represented by the Guardianship, and the secular world, in which laws define the relationships between persons, corporate or otherwise, and property."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"This dispute revolves around two basic issues: the composition of the Board, and the powers of the presidency in relation to the church property... The District Court has no power either to anoint a successor to any religious office, or to invalidate any claim thereto. If these two issues can be resolved on purely secular grounds, then the District Court can apply corporate, property, and tort law in deciding the merits of the Board’s conversion and other claims against Chase."&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The case was remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.&lt;ref name="opinion" /&gt;

==Domain name dispute over UHJ.net==
On February 24, 2005 the [[Spiritual Assembly|National Spiritual Assembly]] (NSA) of the Bahá'ís of the United States filed a complaint with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] Arbitration and Mediation Center against Neal Chase for his use of the [[domain name]] UHJ.net, which claims to be "The Official website of the Universal House of Justice" - a name for which the NSA has a United States federal trademark registration, issued in 1965.

The case resulted in Chase keeping the [[domain name]] on the basis that "uhj" as an acronym is not commonly used in the Bahá'í Faith to refer to the Universal House of Justice. The panel also concluded that the NSA was not attempting a [[reverse domain name hijacking]]. All other issues were deemed not necessary to address.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://arbiter.wipo.int/domains/decisions/html/2005/d2005-0214.html WIPO document]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although nationwide inquiries have been conducted only in the United States and Ireland, as well as an [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse|Australian inquiry into institutional responses]], cases of clerical sexual abuse of minors have been reported and prosecuted in [[Catholic sexual abuse cases in New Zealand|New Zealand]], Canada and other countries.

In Ireland, the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] issued a report that covered six decades (from the 1950s).

Church officials and academics knowledgeable about the [[Third World]] Roman Catholic Church say that sexual abuse by clergy is generally not discussed, and thus is difficult to measure.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; This may be due in part to the more hierarchical structure of the Church in Third World countries, the "psychological health" of clergy in those regions, and because Third World media, legal systems and public culture are not as apt to thoroughly discuss sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; In the [[Philippines]], where {{as of|2002|lc=y}} at least 85% of the population is Catholic, the revelations of sexual abuse by priests, including child sexual abuse, followed the United States' widespread reporting in 2002.&lt;ref name="BBC News"&gt;{{cite news|title=Philippines Church apologises for sex abuse|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2116154.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=2 August 2012|date=8 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic Mathew N. Schmalz notes India as an example: "you would have gossip and rumors, but it never reaches the level of formal charges or controversies."&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; Traditionally, the Roman Catholic Church has held tight control over many aspects of church life around the globe, including "the words used in prayer", but it left sex abuse cases to be handled locally.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; In 2001, the church first required that sex abuse cases be reported to Rome.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; In July 2010, the Vatican doubled the length of time after the 18th birthday of the victim in which clergymen can be tried in a church court.

According to a 2004 research study by the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] for the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], 4,392 Catholic priests and deacons in active ministry between 1950 and 2002 have been plausibly (neither withdrawn nor disproven) accused of under-age sexual abuse by 10,667 individuals. Estimating the number of priests and deacons active in the same period at 110,000, the report concluded that approximately 4% have faced these allegations. The report noted that "It is impossible to determine from our surveys what percent of all actual cases of abuse that occurred between 1950 and 2002 have been reported to the Church and are therefore in our dataset."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/child-and-youth-protection/upload/The-Nature-and-Scope-of-Sexual-Abuse-of-Minors-by-Catholic-Priests-and-Deacons-in-the-United-States-1950-2002.pdf|title=THE NATURE AND SCOPE OF SEXUAL ABUSE OF MINORS BY CATHOLIC PRIESTS AND DEACONS IN THE UNITED STATES 1950–2002|last=|first=|publisher=John Jay School of Criminal Justice|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Augustin Cardinal Bea, S.J. specializes in abuse counseling and is considered an expert on clerical abuse; he states "approximately 4% of priests during the past half century (and mostly in the 1960s and 1970s) have had a sexual experience with a minor."&lt;ref name="Plante"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Plante2&gt;{{cite web|work=Pastoral Psychology, Vol. 52, No. 5, May 2004 |title=The Sexual Abuse Crisis in the Roman Catholic Church: What Psychologists and Counselors Should Know |author=Plante, Thomas G. and Courtney Daniels |publisher=Springer Publishing |url=http://ww.scu.edu/cas/psychology/faculty/upload/Plante-Clergy-Paper-2.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720042251/http://ww.scu.edu/cas/psychology/faculty/upload/Plante-Clergy-Paper-2.pdf |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine, this figure is similar to the rate of frequency in the rest of the adult population.&lt;ref name="newsweek.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236096 | work=Newsweek | title=Mean Men: The priesthood is being cast as the refuge of pederasts.

Allegations of and convictions for sexual abuse by clergy have occurred in many countries. There are no accurate figures available on the number of sexual abuse cases in different regions. But, in 2002 ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' reported, "clearly the issue has been most prominent in the United States."&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; The US is the country with the highest number of reported Catholic sex abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, Mark M. "The Impact of Religious Switching and Secularization on the estimated size of the U.S. Adult Catholic Population". Article 49.4(2008)457–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the United States, the country with the next highest number of reported cases is Ireland.&lt;ref name="Garrett 2013"/&gt; A significant number of cases have also been reported in Australia, [[Sexual abuse scandal at Marylands School, Christchurch|New Zealand]], Canada, and countries in [[Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Europe|Europe]], Latin America, Africa, and Asia.&lt;ref name=Paulson&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories/040802_world.htm |title=World doesn't share US view of scandal |date=8 April 2002 |accessdate=28 July 2009 |first=Michael |last=Paulson | work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been unfair, excessive, and disproportionate.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2012}} According to a [[Pew Research Center]] study, in 2002 the media coverage was focused on the US, where a ''Boston Globe'' series initiated widespread coverage in the region. However, by 2010 the focus had shifted to Europe.&lt;ref name="pewforum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

In September 2011, a submission was lodged with the [[International Criminal Court]] alleging that the Pope, Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] ([[Dean of the College of Cardinals]]), Cardinal [[Tarcisio Bertone]] ([[Cardinal Secretary of State]]), and Cardinal [[William Levada]] (then-current Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]) had committed a [[crime against humanity]] by failing to prevent or punish perpetrators of rape and sexual violence in a "systematic and widespread" concealment which included failure to co-operate with relevant law enforcement agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/13/pope-crimes-humanity-victims-abuse | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Karen | last=McVeigh | title=Pope accused of crimes against humanity by victims of sex abuse | date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement to the [[Associated Press]], the Vatican described this as a "ludicrous publicity stunt and a misuse of international judicial processes." Lawyers and law professors emphasized that the case is likely to fall outside the court's jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2011/0915/Why-the-ICC-likely-won-t-charge-pope-over-Catholic-Church-sex-abuses |title=Why the ICC likely won't charge pope over Catholic Church sex abuses |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |date=15 September 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cases==
In the late 1940s, American Fr. [[Gerald Fitzgerald (priest)|Gerald Fitzgerald]] founded the [[Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete]], a religious order that treats Roman Catholic priests who struggle with personal difficulties such as substance abuse and sexual misconduct. In a series of letters and reports to high-ranking Catholic leaders starting in the 1950s, Fitzgerald warned of substantial problems with [[pedophile]] priests. He wrote, for example, "[sexual abuse] offenders were unlikely to change and should not be returned to ministry." He discussed the problem with [[Pope Paul VI]] (1963&amp;nbsp;– 1978) and "in correspondence with several bishops".&lt;ref name=zollusa/&gt;

In 2001, the Vatican first required that sex abuse cases be reported to the Vatican hierarchy; before that, it left management of the cases to local dioceses.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; After the 2002 revelation by the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' that cases of abuse were widespread in the Church in Massachusetts and elsewhere, ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' did a year-long investigation.&lt;ref name=hundreds/&gt; It reported in 2004 that even after these revelations and public outcry, the institutional church had moved allegedly abusive priests out of the countries where they had been accused but assigned them again to "settings that bring them into contact with children, despite church claims to the contrary".&lt;ref name=hundreds/&gt; Among the investigation's findings was  that nearly half of 200 cases "involved clergy who tried to elude law enforcement."&lt;ref name=hundreds/&gt;

The cases received significant media and public attention in the United States, Ireland (where abuse was reported as widespread), and Canada, and throughout the world.&lt;ref name=WDSUS/&gt; In response to the attention, members of the church hierarchy have argued that media coverage has been excessive and disproportionate.&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt;{{failed verification|date=December 2016}}  According to a [[Pew Research Center]] study, media coverage was generated mostly in the United States, beginning in 2002, with a ''Boston Globe'' series that published hundreds of news reports. By contrast, in 2010 much of the reporting focused on child abuse in Europe.&lt;ref name="pewforum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Non-disclosure===
&lt;!--This section summarizes detailed reports from many countries, discussed in the country sections and in #Criticisms of church responses--&gt;
Church authorities are often accused of covering up cases of sex abuse. In many cases, as discussed in the sections on different countries, clergy discovered by Church authorities to be criminally offending are not reported to civil authorities such as the police. They are often merely moved from one diocese to another, usually without any warning to the authorities or the congregations at the destination. While offending clergy could be subject to action such as [[defrocking]], this is rare; the intention of the Church until recent times has been to avoid publicity and scandal at all costs.

In some cases offenders may confess their wrongdoing to a priest under the [[Sacrament of Penance]]. [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|Church canon law]] unconditionally prohibits a priest hearing such a confession from making any disclosure about the existence or content of the confession to anybody, including Church and civil authorities—the [[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|"Seal of the Confessional"]]. This obligation is taken very seriously throughout the Catholic Church; for example all serving archbishops in Australia told the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse that they would not report to police a colleague who admitted in the confessional to child rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-29/george-pells-charging-and-what-it-means-for-the-church-kennedy/8663554 |title=George Pell's charging and what it means for the Catholic Church in Australia|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) News|date= 30 June 2017|author=Paul Kennedy |accessdate= 30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not always in contradiction with civil law; the law in many, but not all, countries confers [[confessional privilege]], a rule of evidence that forbids judicial inquiry into certain communications between clergy and members of their congregation.

Most reported incidents of sex abuse occurred between 1950 and 1989,&lt;ref name=settlementoz /&gt; however it was noted that there was on average a delay of 33 years between when a victim was abused to when it was reported,&lt;ref name="abc.net.au" /&gt; which skews the statistics towards older incidents of abuse.

In June 2010, Belgian police raided the Belgian Catholic Church headquarters in [[Brussels]], seizing a computer and records of a Church commission investigating allegations of child abuse. This was part of an investigation into hundreds of claims that had been raised about alleged child sexual abuse committed by Belgian clergy.

===Canada===
{{Main|Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Canada}}
In the late 1980s, allegations were made of physical and sexual abuse committed by members of the [[Christian Brothers of Ireland|Christian Brothers]], who operated the [[Mount Cashel Orphanage]] in St. John's, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]]. The government, police, and church had colluded in an attempt to cover up the allegations, but in December 1989 they were reported in the ''St. John's Sunday Express''. Eventually more than 300 former pupils came forward with allegations of physical and sexual abuse at the orphanage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/clergy_sex3.htm |title=Sexual abuse by Catholic clergy – The Canadian situation |accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious order that ran the orphanage filed for [[bankruptcy]] in the face of numerous civil lawsuits seeking damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2004/2004canlii66324/2004canlii66324.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721185816/http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2004/2004canlii66324/2004canlii66324.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=2004 CanLII 66324 (ON SC) |publisher=CanLII |accessdate=5 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Mount Cashel scandal, a number of priests across Canada have been accused of sexual abuse.

=== Chile ===
{{Main|Catholic sexual abuse cases in Chile}}
Early in 2018, Pope Francis met with Bishop [[Juan Barros Madrid|Juan Barros]] from Chile. Before his visit to Chile to meet with the bishop, there were serious sex abuse charges concerning the priest, [[Karadima case|Fernando Karadima]]. Barros was accused of covering up several sex crimes by Karadima.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/services/englishnews/2018/pope-apologizes-to-sex-abuse-victims-defends-accused-chilean-bishop.cfm|title=Pope apologizes to sex abuse victims, defends accused Chilean bishop|website=www.catholicnews.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many laypersons and victims of sexual abuse&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lies|first=William Matthew|date=|title=Counting sheep: Religious socialization, competition and Chilean politics|url=https://search-proquest-com.libproxy.berkeley.edu/dissertations/docview/305310109/16EFFC8BF1EC4CF1PQ/3?accountid=14496|journal=UMI|volume=|pages=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; came forward to condemn Barros for having covered up the sex crimes. When Pope Francis came to visit the bishop, he was asked by local reporters about the sexual abuse scandal surrounding Barros. Pope Francis quickly reprimanded critics, even the victims of Karadima, by calling the scandal a ‘’slander.” In addition, Pope Francis chastised reporters by stating, "The day they bring me proof against Bishop Barros, I will speak. There is not one piece of evidence against him. It is calumny. Is that clear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncronline.org/news/accountability/ncr-today/chile-controversy-contrasts-image-pope-francis-leveler|title=Chile controversy contrasts with image of Pope Francis as a leveler|date=2018-01-23|work=National Catholic Reporter|access-date=2018-05-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following the pope’s defense of Barros, Boston Cardinal [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O’Malley]], a key Vatican advisor on clergy abuse, acknowledged that Francis’ comments about Barros were “a source of great pain” for victims. Subsequently, Francis appointed Archbishop [[Charles Scicluna]] of Malta to investigate the allegations of abuse in the Chilean church. &lt;ref&gt;www.latimes.com: [http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-vatican-chilean-bishops-resign-20180611-story.html ]&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon receive Scicluna’s report, Francis wrote on April 12th that he had “made serious mistakes in the assessment and perception of the situation, especially because of a lack of truthful and balanced information.”

He also declared that that the Chilean church hierarchy was collectively responsible for “grave defects” in handling sexual abuse cases and the resulting loss of credibility suffered by the church. Following Francis’ remarks, 33 Chilean bishops offered their resignation. &lt;ref&gt;theguardian.com: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/may/18/chilean-bishops-offer-their-resignation-over-sexual-abuse-cover-up ''All Chilean bishops offer their resignation over sexual abuse cover-up'']&lt;/ref&gt;
Later Pope Francis apologized to the victims of the sex abuse scandal. In late April 2018, three victims&lt;!--- Juan Carlos Cruz, James Hamilton and Andrés Murillo---&gt; were invited to the Vatican.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2018/04/30/chilean-abuse-victims-praise-personal-meetings-pope-francis|title=Chilean abuse victims praise personal meetings with Pope Francis|date=2018-04-30|work=[[America (magazine)|America Magazine]] |access-date=2018-05-03 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In June 2018, Francis accepted the resignations of five bishops ([[Gonzalo Duarte García de Cortázar]], [[Juan Barros Madrid]] and [[Cristián Caro Cordero]], [[Alejandro Goić Karmelić]] and [[Horacio del Carmen Valenzuela Abarca]]) and in September the resignations of [[Alejandro Goić Karmelić]] ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Rancagua|Diocese of Rancagua]]) und [[Horacio del Carmen Valenzuela Abarca]] ([[Roman Catholic Diocese of Talca|Diocese of Talca]]).&lt;ref&gt;www.straitstimes.com: [https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/pope-francis-accepts-resignation-of-two-more-chilean-bishops-following-abuse-scandal ''Pope Francis accepts resignation of two more Chilean bishops following abuse scandal'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-vatican-chilean-bishops-resign-20180611-story.html latimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Raju Kokkan, the vicar of the Saint Paul's Church in [[Thaikkattussery]], [[Thrissur]], [[Kerala]], was arrested on charges of raping a nine-year-old girl. According to [[Kerala Police]], Kokkan had raped the child on several different occasions, including at least thrice in his office during the month of April. Kokkan promised to gift the child expensive vestments for her [[Holy Communion]] ceremony before sexually assaulting her. The abuse was revealed after the victim informed her parents that she had been raped by Kokkan on 25 April 2014. The priest subsequently fled to [[Nagercoil]] in the neighbouring state of [[Tamil Nadu]], and was arrested by police on 5 May. Following the arrest, the Thrissur Archdiocese stated that the vicar had been removed from his position within the Church.

{{Main|Roman Catholic Church sexual abuse scandal in Ireland}}
{{See also|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin|Murphy Report}}

In the Republic of Ireland, starting in the 1990s, there were a series of criminal cases and government enquiries related to allegations that priests had abused hundreds of minors over previous decades. State-ordered investigations documented "tens of thousands of children from the 1940s to the 1990s" who suffered abuse, including sexual abuse at the hands of priests, nuns, and church staff in three dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pope: Irish clergy child sex abuse a 'mystery'|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10813749|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120618133242/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10813749|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 June 2012|accessdate=6 July 2012|newspaper=New Zealand Herald|date=18 June 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases senior clergy had moved priests accused of abuse to other parishes. By 2010, a number of in-depth judicial reports had been published, but with relatively few prosecutions. The abuse was occasionally made known to staff at the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education]], the [[Garda Síochána|police]], and other government bodies. They have said that prosecuting clergy was extremely difficult given the "Catholic ethos" of the Irish Republic.{{citation needed|date = November 2015}} In addition, in 2004 the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]] had sued for a civil settlement that barred prosecution of any of its members or the naming of any Christian Brother in the government investigatory report. Christian Brothers had a higher number of allegations made against their order than were made against others. Neither were any victims named in the report.

In 1994, [[Micheal Ledwith]] resigned as President of [[St Patrick's College, Maynooth]] when allegations of sexual abuse by him were made public. The June 2005 ''[[McCullough Report]]'' found that a number of bishops had rejected concerns about Ledwith's inappropriate behavior towards [[seminary|seminarians]] "so completely and so abruptly without any adequate investigation", although his report conceded that "to investigate in any very full or substantial manner, a generic complaint regarding a person's apparent propensities would have been difficult".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/bishops-accused-in-college-sex-row-254978.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120804195935/http://www.independent.ie/national-news/bishops-accused-in-college-sex-row-254978.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-04 |title=Bishops accused in college sex row |work=Independent.ie }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Northern Ireland====
In [[Northern Ireland]] (part of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]] and politically independent of the Republic of Ireland), the [[Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry]] started in January 2014. It was the largest inquiry in UK legal history into sexual and physical abuse in certain institutions (including non-Catholic ones) that were in charge of children from 1922 to 1995. The [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools#Sexual abuse of boys|De La Salle Brothers]] and the [[Sisters of Nazareth]] admitted early in the inquiry to physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions in Northern Ireland that they controlled, and issued an apology to victims.&lt;ref name="lasalle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jan/14/de-la-salle-brothers-order-admits-abuse-boys-care-home|title=Sisters of Nazareth become second Catholic order to admit to child abuse|author=Henry McDonald|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/rubane-house-like-hell-upon-earth-for-69yearold-branded-a-liar-for-reporting-his-abuse-as-boy-30643584.html|title=Rubane House 'like Hell upon Earth' for 69-year-old branded a liar for reporting his abuse as boy|work=BelfastTelegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2017 report also stated that the local police, who had also poorly investigated claims of sex abuse at the non-Catholic Kincora Boys' Home,&lt;ref name=kp[ppav&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/ireland/2017/0120/846491-kincora/|title='Catalogue of failures' over Kincora abuse|date=20 January 2017|website=Rte.ie|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=atonement&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/utv/2017-01-20/no-credible-evidence-of-paedophile-ring-at-kincora-boys-home/|title=‘No credible evidence’ of paedophile ring at Kincora Boys’ Home|website=Itv.com|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  had played a role in assisting the local Catholic officials in covering up reported pedophile activity at four Catholic-run homes for boys in the Belfast area and that these four homes had contained the highest level of reported sex abuse of all the 22 homes which were investigated.&lt;ref name=sexabuseireland&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38685157|title='Widespread abuse' in children's homes|date=29 October 2017|accessdate=29 October 2017|website=Bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sexabuseireland2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jan/20/northern-ireland-inquiry-report-outlines-shocking-child-abuse|title=Northern Ireland child abuse inquiry singles out police and church|first=Henry McDonald Ireland|last=correspondent|date=20 January 2017|accessdate=29 October 2017|website=Theguardian.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
After revelations by Norwegian newspaper ''[[Adresseavisen]],'' the Catholic Church in Norway and the Vatican acknowledged in 2010 that [[Georg Müller (Catholic bishop)|Georg Müller]] had resigned in July 2009 from the position of Bishop of Trondheim which he held from 1997, because of the discovery of his abuse of an altar boy two decades earlier. The Vatican cited Canon (Church) law 401/2 but as is customary gave no details. The Norwegian Catholic Church was made aware of the incident at the time but did not alert the authorities. Norwegian law did not allow a criminal prosecution of Müller so long after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6362KE20100407 |title=Norwegian bishop who resigned in 2009 was abuser |accessdate=7 April 2010 | work=Reuters | date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===
During 2013 the public in this deeply Catholic country became concerned about reports of child sex abuse scandals within the church, some of which reached the courts, and the poor response by the church. The church resisted demands to pay compensation to victims.&lt;ref name="ft-20131011"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/571c9b72-31a4-11e3-817c-00144feab7de.html |title=Polish Catholic Church rocked by sex abuse scandal |author=Jan Cienski |newspaper=Financial Times |date=11 October 2013 |accessdate=12 July 2014 |quote=The Church faces compensation claims from victims, the first of which is now in the Polish courts.

In October 2013 the Catholic Church in Poland explicitly refused to publish data on sexual abuse, but said that, if the data were to be published, the scale would be seen to be very low.&lt;ref name="onet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.onet.pl/kraj/marcin-przeciszewski-pedofilia-w-kosciele-ma-charakter-marginalny/sn5xc|title=Marcin Przeciszewski: pedofilia w Kościele ma charakter marginalny – Wiadomości|publisher=wiadomosci.onet.pl|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop [[Antoni Pacyfik Dydycz|Antoni Dydycz]] said that priests should not be pressed to report sexual abuse to state authorities, invoking the ecclesiastical "[[Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church|seal of confession]]," which bans them from revealing what is said in the rite of confession.&lt;ref name="gazeta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/wiadomosci/1,114871,14881054,Bp_Dydycz_w_liscie_do_wiernych_o_pedofilii_i_tajemnicy.html#TRNajCzyt|title=Bp Dydycz w liście do wiernych o pedofilii i tajemnicy spowiedzi.

On September 27, 2018, Bishop [[Romuald Kamiński]] of the Warsaw-Praga Diocese issued an apology to those who had been sexually abused by priests in his Diocese and that church leaders in Poland had completed work on a document to address the abuse of minors and suggest ways to prevent it.&lt;ref name=polandsexabuse&gt;https://www.krmg.com/news/world/polish-bishop-apologizes-victims-clergy-sex-abuse/5xA9BnSwCSLGHCiNlFPg2I/&lt;/ref&gt; According to Archbishop [[Wojciech Polak]], the head of Poland's Catholic Church, the document will also include data on the scale of priestly sex abuse in Poland.&lt;ref name=polandsexabuse /&gt; However, it will not be made public until later in the year.&lt;ref name=polandsexabuse /&gt;

Although bishops had been sending sexually abusive priests to facilities such as those operated by the [[Servants of the Paraclete]] since the 1950s, there was scant public discussion of the problem until the mid-1960s. Even then, most of the discussion was held amongst the Catholic hierarchy with little or no coverage in the media. A public discussion of sexual abuse of minors by priests took place at a meeting sponsored by the National Association for Pastoral Renewal held on the campus of the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1967, to which all U.S. Catholic bishops were invited.

Various local and regional discussions of the problem were held by Catholic bishops in later years. However, it was not until the 1980s that discussion of sexual abuse by Roman Catholic clerics began to be covered as a phenomenon in the news media of the United States. According to the [[Catholic News Service]], public awareness of the sexual abuse of children in the United States and Canada emerged in the late 1970s and the 1980s as an outgrowth of the growing awareness of physical abuse of children in society.

In September 1983, the'' [[National Catholic Reporter]] '' published an article on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natcath.org/crisis/092383.htm |title=Sex Abuse Crisis: Sex abuse sparks program |publisher=Natcath.org |date=5 April 2002 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The subject gained wider national notoriety in October 1985 when [[Louisiana]] priest Gilbert Gauthe pleaded guilty to 11 counts of molestation of boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=oTaQPSjSlfEC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22Gilbert+Gauthe%22+guilty+%22october+1985%22 |title=Pedophiles and priests: anatomy of a ... – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 15 April 2001|accessdate=27 April 2010|isbn=978-0-19-514597-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the coverage of Gauthe's crimes subsided, the issue faded to the fringes of public attention until the mid-1990s, when the issue was again brought to national attention after a number of books on the topic were published.&lt;ref name="religioustolerance.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/clergy_sex8.htm |title=What Percentage Of Priests Abuse, And Whom Do They Victimize?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the ''[[Boston Globe]]''{{'}}s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning coverage of sexual abuse cases involving Catholic priests drew the attention, first of the United States and ultimately the world, to the problem.&lt;ref name="Abuse in the Catholic Church"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dartcenter.org/articles/special_features/church_abuse.php |title=Abuse in the Catholic Church |accessdate=21 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518070854/http://www.dartcenter.org/articles/special_features/church_abuse.php |archivedate=18 May 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion-jan-june02-boston_3-26/|title=The Boston Globe: Challenging the Catholic Church &amp;#124; PBS NewsHour|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=pbs.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301165322/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/religion-jan-june02-boston_3-26/|archive-date=2014-03-01|dead-url=yes|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="springerlink.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/c5u2w617245j24m5/|title=The Clergy Sex Abuse Crisis and the Mourning of American Catholic Innocence – Springer|accessdate=14 September 2014 | doi=10.1007/s11089-007-0099-5|volume=56|journal=Pastoral Psychology|pages=321–339}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--&lt;ref name="pep-web.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=SGS.005.0121A|title=PEP Web – Psychosocial Anatomy of the Catholic Sexual Abuse Scandal|publisher=pep-web.org|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6765175|title=Abuse Scandal Still Echoes Through Catholic Church : NPR|publisher=npr.org|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="archive.newsmax.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2004/4/5/01552.shtml|title=NewsMax Archives|publisher=archive.newsmax.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="glaad.org"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030816220712/http://www.glaad.org/media/resource_kit_detail.php?id=3166] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="multiline.com.au"&gt;[https://archive.is/20050724200707/http://www.multiline.com.au/~johnm/betrayal.htm] &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; Other victims began to come forward with their own allegations of abuse, resulting in more lawsuits and criminal cases.&lt;ref name="Bruni336"&gt;Bruni, ''A Gospel of Shame'' (2002), p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, the problem of clerical abuse of minors has received significantly more attention from the Church hierarchy, law enforcement agencies, government and the news media.

In 2003 [[Archbishop]] [[Timothy M.

As recently as 2011 Fr Curtis Wehmeyer was allowed to work as a priest in [[Minnesota]] despite many people having reported concern about his sexual compulsion and suspicious behavior with boys. Wehmeyer was employed as a priest without proper background checks. Wehmeyer was later convicted of sexually abusing two boys. After Wehmeyer's arrest there were complaints the responsible clergy were more concerned with how to spin the story in a favorable light than in helping victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2013/09/clergy-abuse/|title=Archdiocese knew of priest's sexual misbehavior yet kept him in ministry|author=Minnesota Public Radio|date=23 September 2013|work=Minnesota Public Radio News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Jay Report''====
In the United States the 2004 ''[[John Jay Report]],'' commissioned from the [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] and funded by the [[U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB), was based on volunteer surveys completed by the Roman Catholic dioceses in the United States. The 2004 ''John Jay Report'' was based on a study of 10,667 allegations against 4,392 priests accused of engaging in sexual abuse of a minor between 1950 and 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/nrbstudy/nrbreport.htm#johnjay |title=A Report on the Crisis in the Catholic Church in the United States |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The surveys filtered provided information from diocesan files on each priest accused of sexual abuse and on each of the priest's victims to the research team, in a format which did not disclose the names of the accused priests or the dioceses where they worked. The dioceses were encouraged to issue reports of their own based on the surveys that they had completed.

The report stated there were approximately 10,667 reported victims (younger than 18 years) of clergy sexual abuse between 1950 and 2002:
* Around 81% of these victims were male.
* Female victims of sexual abuse by Catholic priests tended to be younger than the males. Data analyzed by John Jay researchers, shows that the number and proportion of sexual misconduct directed at girls under 8 years old was higher than that directed at boys the same age.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/04/14/what-about-the-girls.html|title=newsweek/2010/04/14/what-about-the-girls|publisher=thedailybeast.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 22.6% were age 10 or younger, 51% were between the ages of 11 and 14, and 27% were between the ages to 15 to 17 years.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=America |url=https://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3497 |title=Facts, Myths and Questions |first=Thomas J. |last=Reese |date=22 March 2004 |accessdate=29 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420111108/http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3497 |archivedate=20 April 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AgostinoBono&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/news/clergysexabuse/johnjaycns.asp |title=John Jay Study Reveals Extent of Abuse Problem |first=Agostino |last=Bono}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usccb.org"&gt;John Jay College of Criminal Justice. [http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/incident3.pdf The Nature and Scope of the Problem of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests and Deaconsin the United States]: 4.3 Characteristics of children who alleged sexual abuse by Catholic priests. p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;
* A substantial number (almost 2000) of very young children were victimized by priests during this time period.
* 9,281 victim surveys had information about an investigation. In 6,696 (72%) cases, an investigation of the allegation was carried out. Of these, 4,570 (80%) were substantiated; 1,028 (18%) were unsubstantiated; 83 (1.5%) were found to be false. In 56 cases, priests were reported to deny the allegations.
* More than 10 percent of these allegations were characterized as not substantiated because diocese or order could not determine whether the alleged abuse actually took place.
* For approximately 20 percent of the allegations, the priest was deceased or inactive at the time of the receipt of the allegation and typically no investigation was conducted in these circumstances.
* In 38.4% of allegations, the abuse is alleged to have occurred within a single year, in 21.8% the alleged abuse lasted more than a year but less than 2 years, in 28% between 2 and 4 years, in 10.2% between 5 and 9 years and, in under 1%, 10 or more years.

The 4,392 priests who were accused amount to approximately 4% of the 109,694 priests in active ministry during that time. Of these 4,392, approximately:
* 56 percent had one reported allegation against them; 27 percent had two or three allegations against them; nearly 14 percent had four to nine allegations against them; 3 percent (149 priests) had 10 or more allegations against them. These 149 priests were responsible for almost 3,000 victims, or 27 percent of the allegations.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions /&gt;
* The allegations were substantiated for 1,872 priests and unsubstantiated for 824 priests. They were thought to be credible for 1,671 priests and not credible for 345 priests. 298 priests and deacons who had been completely exonerated are not included in the study.
* 50 percent were 35 years of age or younger at the time of the first instance of alleged abuse.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions /&gt;
* Almost 70 percent were ordained before 1970.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions /&gt;
* Fewer than 7 percent were reported to have themselves been victims of physical, sexual or emotional abuse as children. Although 19 percent had alcohol or substance abuse problems, 9 percent were reported to have been using drugs or alcohol during the instances of abuse.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions /&gt;

Many of the reported acts of sexual abuse involved fondling or unspecified abuse. There were allegations of forced acts of oral sex and intercourse. Detailed information on the nature of the abuse was not reported for 26.6% of the reported allegations. 27.3% of the allegations involved the cleric performing oral sex on the victim. 25.1% of the allegations involved penile penetration or attempted penetration.

Although there were reported acts of sexual abuse of minors in every year, the incidence of reported abuse increased by several orders of magnitude in the 1960s and 1970s. There was, for example, a more than sixfold increase in the number of reported acts of abuse of males aged 11 to 17 between the 1950s and the 1970s. After peaking in the 1970s, the number of incidents in the report decreased through the 1980s and 1990s even more sharply than the incidence rate had increased in the 1960s and 1970s. Contributing factors to the abuse are considered to be "poor screening and training of priests."

According to a ''Newsweek'' article the rate of abuse by Catholic priests is no higher than the rate of abuse by the general male population in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Winger, Pat. "Priests Commit No More Abuse Than Other Males" in Newsweek, 4/7/2010. Online at:  [http://www.newsweek.com/priests-commit-no-more-abuse-other-males-70625]  Accessed 22 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lawsuits and their effects==

The [[Associated Press]] estimated the settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 totaled more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="MSNBCSet"/&gt; BishopAccountability puts the figure at more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="zollusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pimd/&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Settlements and bankruptcies in Catholic sex abuse cases}}

BishopAccountability.org, an "online archive established by lay Catholics," reports that over 3,000 "civil lawsuits have been filed against the church" in the United States, some of these cases have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements with many claimants.&lt;ref name="pimd"/&gt;

The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Dallas]] paid $30.9&amp;nbsp;million in 1998 to twelve victims of one priest.&lt;ref name="TCJPR"/&gt; In July 2003 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Louisville]] paid $25.7&amp;nbsp;million to "settle child sexual-abuse allegations made in 240 lawsuits naming 34 priests and other church workers."&lt;ref name="TCJPR"/&gt;

In April 2007 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Portland in Oregon]] agreed to a [[Sexual abuse scandal in Portland archdiocese|$75&amp;nbsp;million settlement with 177 claimants]] and the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Seattle]] agreed to a $48&amp;nbsp;million settlement with more than 160 victims.&lt;ref name="Langlois"&gt;{{cite news|last=Langlois |first=Ed |title=Portland Archdiocese ends bankruptcy with $75 million settlement |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702198.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20130408001034/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0702198.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 April 2013 |accessdate=29 June 2012 |newspaper=Catholic News Service |date=19 April 2007 |author2=Robert Pfohman }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Denver]] agreed "to pay $5.5&amp;nbsp;million to settle 18 claims of childhood sexual abuse."&lt;ref name="Richardson"&gt;{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Valerie|title=Denver Archdiocese Settles 18 Sex-Abuse Cases|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/jul/02/denver-archdiocese-settles-18-sex-abuse-cases/|accessdate=29 June 2012|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=2 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press estimated that the total from settlements of sex abuse cases from 1950 to 2007 to be more than $2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=MSNBCSet/&gt; According to BishopAccountability reports that figure reached more than $3&amp;nbsp;billion in 2012.&lt;ref name="zollusa"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pimd/&gt;

Most sex abuse cases are subject to the laws of each individual state. As of April 2010 many sex abusers associated with the Church in several countries have been tried by secular authorities and some have been convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.

Addressing "a flood of abuse claims" five dioceses (Tucson, Arizona; Spokane, Washington; Portland, Oregon.; [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic diocese of Davenport|Davenport, Iowa]], and San Diego) got bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref name=MSNBCSet/&gt; Eight [[Settlements and bankruptcies in Catholic sex abuse cases|Catholic diocese have declared bankruptcy due to sex abuse cases]] from 2004 to 2011.&lt;ref name=Eightbankruptcies/&gt;

&lt;!-- The next two paragraphs should be integrated to describe an increase from $500million "by the end of the mid 1990s" (whatever that means) to $1.5billion at the end of March 2006 --&gt;
According to [[Donald Cozzens]], "by the end of the mid 1990s, it was estimated that [...] more than half a billion dollars had been paid in jury awards, [[financial settlement|settlements]] and legal fees." This figure grew to about one billion dollars by 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Donald B. |last=Cozzens |title=The changing face of the priesthood: A reflection on the priest's crisis of soul |publisher=Liturgical Press |year=2000 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Catholics spent $615&amp;nbsp;million on sex abuse cases in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dhadm.com/content/catholic-church-spent-615-million-on-sexual-abuse-cases-in-2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709020146/http://www.dhadm.com/content/catholic-church-spent-615-million-on-sexual-abuse-cases-in-2007|date=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of March 2006, dioceses in which abuse was committed or in which abuse allegations were settled out of court had made financial settlements with the victims totaling over $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="FactsMythsQuestions"/&gt; The number and size of these settlements made it necessary for the dioceses to reduce their ordinary operating expenses by closing churches and schools in order to raise the funds to make these payments.&lt;ref name="Bruni336"/&gt;  Several dioceses chose to declare [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] as a way to litigate settlements while protecting some church assets to ensure it continues to operate.

By 2009, U.S. dioceses have paid more than US$2.6&amp;nbsp;billion in abuse-related costs since 1950.&lt;ref name=usatodayAP&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-03-31-catholic-abuse_N.htm|title=Letters: Catholic bishops warned in '50s of abusive priests - USATODAY.com|work=usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advancedchristianity.com/Pages/CBS/CBS.htm|title=Crimen_Sollicitationis|work=advancedchristianity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many instances, dioceses were forced to declare bankruptcy as a result of the settlements. At least six U.S. dioceses sought bankruptcy protection. In some cases, the dioceses filed bankruptcy just before civil suits against them were about to go to trial. This had the effect of mandating that pending and future lawsuits be settled in bankruptcy court. The sexual abuse scandal costs each of the 195 dioceses "an average of $300,000 annually."&lt;ref&gt;United Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2006 Report: Findings and Recommendations (Washington: United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, 2007) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resignations, retirements, and laicizations====
Some of the accused priests were forced to resign. Some priests whose crimes fell within statutes of limitation are in jail. Some have been [[laicization|laicized]]. Others — because they are elderly, because of the nature of their offenses, or because they have had some success fighting the charges — cannot be laicized under [[canon law]]. Some priests live in retreat houses that are carefully monitored and sometimes locked.&lt;ref name=nytimespriests&gt;{{Cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |title=A Choice for New York Priests in Abuse Cases |work=The New York Times |date=31 August 2006 |url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/31/nyregion/31priest.html |accessdate=5 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Francis Law]], Cardinal and [[Archbishop]] of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], United States, resigned after Church documents were revealed which suggested he had covered up sexual abuse committed by priests in his archdiocese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/00882888.htm News/Features |&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151116054008/http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/top/features/documents/00882888.htm |date=16 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 December 2002, [[Pope John Paul II]] accepted Law's resignation as Archbishop and reassigned him to an administrative position in the [[Roman Curia]], naming him archpriest of the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], and he later presided at one of the Pope's funeral masses. Law's successor in Boston, Archbishop (later Cardinal) [[Seán Patrick O'Malley|Seán P. O'Malley]], found it necessary to sell substantial real estate properties and close a number of churches in order to pay the $120&amp;nbsp;million in claims against the archdiocese.

Two bishops of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm Beach|Palm Beach, Florida]], resigned due to child abuse allegations. Resigned bishop [[Joseph Keith Symons]] was replaced by [[Anthony O'Connell]], who later also resigned in 2002.

==Irish government responses==
{{Main|Catholic sexual abuse scandal in Ireland}}
{{See also|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin|Ferns Report|Ryan Report|Murphy Report}}

In an address before the Irish parliament on 11 May 1999, [[Taoiseach]] [[Bertie Ahern]] announced a comprehensive program to respond to the scandal of abuse in the nation's Catholic-run childcare institutions. Ahern's speech included the first official apology to those who had been abused physically and sexually while they had been in the care of these institutions. The Taoiseach asked the abuse victims for forgiveness, saying: "On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue."&lt;ref name="escholarship.bc.edu"/&gt;

In response to the furor aroused by the media reports of abuse in Irish government institutions run by religious orders, the Irish government commissioned a study which took nine years to complete. On 20 May 2009, the commission released its 2600-page report, which drew on testimony from thousands of former residents and officials from more than 250 institutions. The commission found that there were thousands of allegations of physical abuse of children of both sexes over a period of six decades. Over the same period, around 370 former child residents alleged they had suffered various forms of sexual abuse from religious figures and others.&lt;ref name="Commission Report_2009 3.7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-07.php|publisher=The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse|title=Commission Report Vol 3 Ch. 7|accessdate=22 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724061728/http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-07.php|archivedate=24 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Commission Report_2009 3.9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-09.php|publisher=The Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse|title=Commission Report Vol 3 Ch. 9|accessdate=22 July 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722051225/http://www.childabusecommission.com/rpt/03-09.php|archivedate=22 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report revealed that government inspectors had failed in their responsibility to detect and stop the abuse. The report characterized sexual molestation as "endemic" in some church-run industrial schools and orphanages for boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0523/1224247209591.html|title=This week they said|date=23 May 2009|work=Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the broadcast of a BBC Television documentary, ''[[Suing the Pope]]'', which highlighted the case of [[Seán Fortune]], one of the most notorious clerical sexual offenders, the Irish government initiated an official inquiry into the allegations of clerical sexual abuse in the Irish [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Ferns]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/correspondent/1879407.stm Suing the Pope] ''BBC News''&lt;/ref&gt;  The inquiry resulted in the publication of the [[Ferns Report]] in 2005.

In response to the Ferns Report, Ireland's Prime Minister [[Brian Cowen]] stated that he was "ashamed by the extent, length, and cruelty" of child abuse, apologized to victims for the government's failure to intervene in [[wikt:Endemic|endemic]] sexual abuse and severe [[Assault#Punishment|beatings]] in schools for much of the 20th century. Cowen also promised to reform the Ireland's [[social services]] for children in line with the recommendations of the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] report.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20090526/wl_nm/us_ireland_abuse Shamed by child abuse, Ireland to reform services]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ''Reuters, 26 May 2009''&lt;/ref&gt; Irish President [[Mary McAleese]] and Cowen made further motions to start criminal investigation against members of Roman Catholic religious orders in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=aFWYtkcymX_4 "Irish Church Abusers Should Face Law, McAleese Says"], ''Bloomberg'', 30 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] reported its findings in which it concluded that:

{{blockquote|"the Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State".&lt;ref name="justice.ie"/&gt;}}

&lt;!-- {{Main|Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin}} --&gt;
In 2009, The [[Murphy Report]] is the result of a three-year public inquiry conducted by the Irish government into the [[Sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Dublin|Sexual abuse scandal in Dublin archdiocese]], released a few months after the report of the [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse|Ryan report]]. The Murphy report stated that, "The Commission has no doubt that clerical child sexual abuse was covered up by the Archdiocese of Dublin and other Church authorities". It found that, "The structures and rules of the [[Catholic Church]] facilitated that cover-up." Moreover, the report asserted that, "State authorities facilitated that cover-up by not fulfilling their responsibilities to ensure that the law was applied equally to all and allowing the Church institutions to be beyond the reach of the normal law enforcement processes."  The report criticized four archbishops – [[John Charles McQuaid]] who died in 1973, [[Dermot Ryan]] who died in 1984, [[Kevin McNamara (bishop)|Kevin McNamara]] who died in 1987, and retired [[Cardinal Desmond Connell]] – for not giving allegations and information on abusers to legal authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Catholic Church in Ireland given immunity for child sexual abuse cover-up, report says |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/religion/6662086/Catholic-Church-in-Ireland-given-immunity-for-child-sexual-abuse-cover-up-report-says.html |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=6 January 2010 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church responses==
{{POV section|date=May 2012}}
{{Main|Ecclesiastical response to Catholic sex abuse cases}}
The responses of the Catholic Church to the sex abuse cases can be viewed on three levels: the [[diocese|diocesan level]], the episcopal conference level, and the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Responses to the scandal proceeded at levels in parallel, with the higher levels becoming progressively more involved as the gravity of the problem became more apparent. For the most part, responding to allegations of sexual abuse in a diocese was left to the jurisdiction of the local bishop or archbishop. According to [[Thomas Plante]], a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, "unlike most large organizations that maintain a variety of middle management positions, the organizational structure of the Catholic Church is a fairly flat structure. Therefore, prior to the Church clergy abuse crisis in 2002, each bishop decided for himself how to manage these cases and the allegations of child sexual abuse by priests. Some have handled these matters very poorly (as evidenced in [[sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston|Boston]]) while others have handled these issues very well."&lt;ref name=Plante2/&gt;

After the number of allegations exploded following the ''Boston Globe'''s series of articles, the breadth and depth of the scandals became apparent in dioceses across the United States. The U.S. bishops felt compelled to formulate a coordinated response at the episcopal conference level. Although the Vatican did not respond immediately to the series of articles published by the ''Boston Globe'' in 2002, it has been reported that Vatican officials were, in fact, monitoring the situation in the U.S. closely.&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity /&gt;

[[John L. Allen, Jr.]], senior correspondent for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', characterized the reaction of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] (USCCB) as calling for "swift, sure and final punishment for priests who are guilty of this kind of misconduct."&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity /&gt; In contrast to this, Allen characterized the Vatican's primary concern as wanting to make sure "that everyone's rights are respected, including the rights of accused clergy" and wanting to affirm that it is not acceptable to "remedy the injustice of sexual abuse with the injustice of railroading priests who may or may not be guilty."&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity /&gt;

===Diocesan responses===

====United States====
According to the [[John Jay Report]], one in four child sex abuse allegations were made within 10 years of the incident.&lt;ref name="JohnJay5.3"/&gt; Half were made between 10 and 30 years after the incident and the remaining 25% were reported more than 30 years after the incident.&lt;ref name="JohnJay5.3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/response3.pdf |title=Response from Dioceses and Religious Communities |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Report points at: failure by the RCC hierarchy in the United States to grasp the seriousness of the problem, overemphasis on the need to avoid a scandal, use of unqualified treatment centers for clergy removed for rehabilitation, a sort of misguided willingness by bishops to forgive sexual misconduct as a moral failing and not treat it a crime, allowance of recidivism upon reassignment of the priest, and insufficient accountability of the hierarchy for inaction.&lt;ref&gt;James T. O'Reilly, Margaret S. P. Chalmers: The Clergy Sex Abuse Crisis and the Legal Responses, Oxford University Press, 2014 {{ISBN|0199937931}}, 9780199937936 p. 291&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rehabilitation efforts====
Since 2002, a major focus of the lawsuits and media attention has been criticism of the approach taken by bishops when dealing with allegations of sexual abuse by priests. As a general rule, the allegations were not reported to legal authority for investigation and prosecution. Instead, many dioceses directed the offending priests to seek psychiatric treatment and for assessment of the risk of re-offending. In 2004, according to the John Jay report, nearly 40% of accused priests participated in psychiatric treatment programs. The remaining priests did not undergo abuse counseling because allegations of sexual abuse were only made after their death. The more allegations made against a priest, the more likely he was to participate in treatment.&lt;ref name=FactsMythsQuestions /&gt;

Some bishops repeatedly moved offending priests from parish to parish after abuse counseling, where they still had personal contact with children.&lt;ref name="Bruni, p.336"/&gt;  According to the USCCB, Catholic bishops in the 1950s and 1960s viewed sexual abuse by priests as "a spiritual problem, one requiring a spiritual solution, i.e. prayer".&lt;ref name="nccbuscc.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nccbuscc.org/mr/mediatalk/Warnings_of_Sexual_Abuse.shtml |title=Media Talk: Warnings of Sexual Abuse in the 1950s |accessdate=4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, starting in the 1960s, the bishops came to adopt an emerging view based on the advice of medical personnel who recommended psychiatric and psychological treatment for those who sexually abused minors. This view asserted that with treatment priests who had molested children could safely be placed back into ministry, although perhaps with certain restrictions such as not being in contact with children.&lt;ref&gt;Frawley-ODea, ''Perversion of Power: Sexual Abuse in the Catholic Church '' (2007), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  This approach viewed [[pedophilia]] as an addiction, such as [[alcoholism]] which can be treated and restrained.&lt;ref name="nccbuscc.org"/&gt;

Some of the North American treatment facilities most frequently used for this purpose included the [[Saint Luke Institute]] in Maryland; centers operated by the [[Servants of the Paraclete]] in Jemez Springs, New Mexico, and St. Louis, Missouri; John Vianney Center in Downingtown, Pennsylvania.; the [[Institute of Living]] in Hartford, Connecticut; and the Southdown Institute near Toronto, Ontario in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal= |title=Priest treatment unfolds in costly, secretive world |last=Barry |first=Ellen |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/archives/6740 |date=3 April 2002 |accessdate=4 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach continued into the mid-1980s, a period which the USCCB characterizes as the "tipping point in the understanding of the problem within the church and in society".&lt;ref name="nccbuscc.org"/&gt; According to researcher Paul Isley, however, research on priest offenders is virtually nonexistent and the claims of unprecedented treatment success with clergy offenders have not been supported by published data.&lt;ref name=Isley&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Pastoral Psychology |first=Paul J. |last=Isley |title=Child sexual abuse and the Catholic church: An historical and contemporary review |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/pv666385476j9037/ |publisher=Springer Netherlands |date = March 1997|pages=277–299 |doi=10.1007/BF02282657 |volume=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevention efforts====
&lt;!-- The text quoted to the Catholic News Service should be checked against the source.  It is probably not an exact quote.  Any part that is paraphrased should be moved outside the quotation marks. --&gt;
The USCCB perceived a lack of adequate procedures for the prevention of sexual abuse of minors, the reporting of allegations of such abuse and the handling of those reports. In response to deficiencies in canonical and secular law, both ecclesiastical and civil authorities have implemented procedures and laws to prevent sexual abuse of minors by clergy and to report and punish it if and when it occurs. In June 2002, the USCCB adopted a [[zero tolerance|zero tolerance policy]] to future sex abuse that required responding to allegations of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"/&gt; It promulgated a [[Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People]] that pledged the Catholic Church in the U.S. to providing a "safe environment" for all children in Church-sponsored activities.&lt;ref name="beliefnet.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Faiths/Christianity/Catholic/2002/06/Insiders-Guide-To-The-Catholic-Bishops-Conference.aspx|title=Insider's Guide to the Catholic Bishops' Conference - Beliefnet.com|publisher=beliefnet.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Charter instituted reforms to prevent future abuse by requiring [[background check]]s for Church employees.&lt;ref name="charteryouth"/&gt; The Charter requires dioceses faced with an allegation to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation and remove the accused from duty.&lt;ref name="charteryouth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/ocyp/charter.shtml|title=Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People|accessdate=8 October 2007|publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops|year=2005|author=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''Dallas Morning News'' article reported nearly two-thirds of the bishops attending the conference had covered for sexually abusive priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/cgi-bin/bi/dallas/2002/priests.cgi|title=News - Dallas News|website=Dallas News|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Catholic News Service'' by 2008, the U.S. church had trained "5.8&amp;nbsp;million children to recognize and report abuse," run criminal checks on volunteers and employees and trained them to create a safe environment for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author = [[Catholic News Service]] |title = We dare not become complacent on abuse, says U.S. bishops' new child protection head | publisher = [[Florida Catholic]] | date = 19 December 2008 – 1 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by Jesuit [[Georgetown University]] Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA) found lay Catholics were unaware of the specific steps that the church has decided to take, but 78% strongly approved reporting allegations of sexual abuse to civil authorities and 76% strongly approved of removing people credibly accused of sexual abuse of a minor.&lt;ref name=VaticanStudy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/article-9560?l=english |title=Vatican Study on Sex Abuse |first=Delia |last=Gallagher |publisher=Zenit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316160509/http://www.zenit.org/article-9560?l=english |archivedate=16 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark M.

====Ireland====
In June 2001, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Ireland established the [[Catholic Church Commission on Child Sexual Abuse (Ireland)]], also known as the Hussey Commission, to investigate how complaints about clerical abuse of minors have been handled over the last three decades.

In February 2002, 18 religious orders agreed to provide more than 128&amp;nbsp;million euros (approximately $128&amp;nbsp;million) in compensation to the victims of childhood abuse. Most of the money was raised from church property transfers to the State; in fact the actual value of the settlement is estimated to be about half that, and the Archbisop of Dublin in 2009 accused the orders of falling short even on the amount promised, and said the church's failure to complete transfers of cash, property and land worth at least €128&amp;nbsp;million over the past seven years "is stunning".&lt;ref name=shortfall/&gt;

The agreement also stipulated that any victims who accepted monetary settlements would waive their right to sue both the church and the government,&lt;ref name=cnsincreased/&gt; and that the identities of the accused abusers was to be kept secret.&lt;ref name=shortfall&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/feedarticle/8524891|title=Archbishop slams Irish Catholic orders over abuse|work=guardian.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the orders agreed to increase their contribution; it was learned that total compensation paid to victims was about €1.2&amp;nbsp;billion, so that until then the promised €128&amp;nbsp;m had been about 10% of the total.&lt;ref name=cnsincreased&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0902564.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090610061920/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0902564.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-10 |title=CNS STORY: Irish religious orders agree to boost compensation for abuse victims |work=catholicnews.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010 the Vatican announced that it would shortly begin an investigation into how the Irish Catholic Establishment's handling of the sex abuse and subsequent scandal. This enquiry will include consulting groups representing victims. Irish Survivors of Child Abuse (Soca), stated that "Irish Soca and other survivors' groups are excited over the apostolic visitation because it's the end of allowing the Irish hierarchy to handle the scandal and crises on their own."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/13/irish-paedophile-priests-vatican-inquiry | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Vatican inquiry into Irish paedophile priests to meet victim groups | first=Henry | last=McDonald | date=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Philippines====
When sexual scandals involving Catholic priests in the US came to light in 2002, the Philippines media began reporting on abuses by local priests. In July of that year, the Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines apologized for sexual misconduct committed by its priests over the last two decades and committed to drafting guidelines on how to deal with allegations of such offenses. According to Archbishop Orlando Quevedo, president of the Catholic Bishops Conference, about 200 of the country's 7,000 priests may have committed "sexual misconduct" – including child abuse, homosexuality and affairs – over the past two decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Philippines Church apologises for sex abuse |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2116154.stm |date=8 July 2002 |accessdate=10 January 2010 | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, activist women's group "Gabriela" assisted a 17-year-old girl in filing sexual abuse allegations against a priest in Butuan province. The bishop of [[Butuan]], Juan de Dios Pueblos, took the priest under his custody without handing him over to civil and church authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gabriela calls on Butuan Bishop to stop coddling priest charged with rape of minor|url=http://bulatlat.com/main/2011/08/30/gabriela-calls-on-butuan-bishop-to-stop-coddling-priest-charged-with-rape-of-minor/ |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=31 August 2011 | work=Bulatlat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behaviour was also heavily criticized by retired Archbishop [[Oscar V.

===Episcopal responses===

====United States====
In June 2002, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. The charter includes guidelines for reconciliation, healing, accountability, reporting, and prevention of future acts of abuse.&lt;ref name="charteryouth"/&gt;

The USCCB's [[National Review Board|National Review Board for the Protection of Children and Young People]] now requires dioceses faced with an allegation of child sexual abuse (where the victim is currently a minor) to alert the authorities, conduct an investigation, and (in the case of an admission of guilt or finding of guilt by an appropriate investigation) remove the accused from duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title =Scandals in the church: The Bishops' Decisions; The Bishops' Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People | work= The New York Times | date =15 June 2002 | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/15/us/scandals-church-bishops-decisions-bishops-charter-for-protection-children-young.html?sq=Charter+for+the+Protection+of+Children+and+Young+People&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt | accessdate =12 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Board also approached [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] to conduct a descriptive study of the nature and scope of the problem of child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church as well as the costs to the church of the scandal. Data collection commenced in March 2003, and ended in February 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/ |title=The Nature and Scope of the Problem of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests and Deacons in the United States |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723061119/http://www.usccb.org/nrb/johnjaystudy/ |archivedate=23 July 2011 |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of this study are discussed elsewhere on this page.

====United Kingdom====
The 2001 Lord Nolan recommendations, accepted in full by the bishops, became model guidelines for other bishops' conferences around the world, and a model for other institutions in Britain.&lt;ref name=america/&gt; One guideline was that in each parish there should be a "safeguarding officer", a lay person who would vet through the [[Criminal Records Bureau]], a government agency, anyone in the parish who had access to young people or vulnerable adults, and would be a contact for anyone with any concerns.&lt;ref name=america&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americamagazine.org/blog/entry.cfm?blog_id=2&amp;entry_id=2800 |title=America Magazine |publisher=America Magazine |date=22 April 2010 |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vatican responses===
[[John L. Allen, Jr.]], Vatican correspondent for the ''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'', commented that many [[Roman Catholicism in the United States|American Catholics]] saw the Vatican's initial silence on the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' stories as showing a lack of concern or awareness about the issue. However, Allen said that he didn't know anyone in the [[Roman Curia]] who was not at least horrified "by the revelations that came out of the ''Globe'' and elsewhere" or who would defend "Cardinal Law's handling of the cases in Boston" or "the rather shocking lack of oversight that revealed itself" though "they might have different analyses of what should have happened to him".&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity/&gt; Allen described the Vatican's perspective as being somewhat skeptical of the media handling of the scandal. In addition, he asserted that the Vatican viewed American cultural attitudes toward sexuality as being somewhat hysterical as well as exhibiting a lack of understanding of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity /&gt;
{{blockquote|No one [in the Vatican] thinks the sexual abuse of kids is unique to the States, but they do think that the reporting on it is uniquely American, fueled by [[anti-Catholicism]] and shyster lawyers hustling to tap the deep pockets of the church. And that thinking is tied to the larger perception about American culture, which is that there is a hysteria when it comes to anything sexual, and an incomprehension of the Catholic Church. What that means is that Vatican officials are slower to make the kinds of public statements that most American Catholics want, and when they do make them they are tentative and halfhearted. It's not that they don't feel bad for the victims, but they think the clamor for them to apologize is fed by other factors that they don't want to capitulate to.''}}
According to Allen, cultural differences between the Vatican and American Catholics complicated the process of formulating a comprehensive response to the sexual abuse scandal: "there is a lot about the American culture and the American Church that puzzles people in the Vatican, and there is much about the Vatican that puzzles Americans and English speakers generally."&lt;ref name=SantaClaraUniversity&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Connections |url=http://office.ajcunet.edu/connections/display.asp?issue=12&amp;article=8&amp;backissue=open |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120722040754/http://office.ajcunet.edu/connections/display.asp?issue=12&amp;article=8&amp;backissue=open |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-22 |title=SCU Conference on the Crisis |date=December 2003 |volume=4 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Following paragraph was copied from [[Crimen sollicitationis]], possibly without attribution --&gt;
Cardinal [[Alfredo Ottaviani]], Secretary of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office]], sent a letter which became known as the [[Crimen sollicitationis]]. In this letter, addressed to "all [[Patriarch#Patriarchs of the Catholic Church|Patriarchs]], [[Archbishop#Catholic Church)|Archbishops]], [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishops]] and other [[Ordinary (officer)|Local Ordinaries]], including those of [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]]", the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith|Holy Office]] laid down procedures to be followed in dealing with cases of [[cleric]]s ([[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or bishops) of the [[Catholic Church]] accused of having used the sacrament of Penance to make sexual advances to penitents; its rules were more specific than the generic ones in the [[Canon Law (Catholic Church)#Codification|Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P4X.HTM|title=CIC  1917: text – IntraText CT|work=intratext.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, it instructed that the same procedures be used when dealing with denunciations of [[homosexuality|homosexual]], [[pedophilia|pedophile]] or [[zoophilia|zoophile]] behaviour by clerics. It repeated the rule that any Catholic who failed for over a month to denounce a priest who had made such advances in connection with confession was automatically excommunicated and could be absolved only after actually denouncing the priest to the Ordinary of the place or to the Holy Congregation of the Holy Office, or at least promising seriously to do so.&lt;ref&gt;"18. «Fidelis vero, qui scienter omiserit eum, a quo sollicitatus fuerit, intra mensem denuntiare contra praescriptum (suprarelati) Canonis 904, incurrit in excommunicationem latae sententiae nemini reservatam, non absolvendus nisi postquam obligationi satisfecerit aut se satisfacturum serio promiserit»"&lt;/ref&gt;

====1983====
The Vatican promulgated a revised Code of Canon Law which included a canon (1395, §2) which explicitly named sex with a minor by clerics as a canonical crime "to be punished with just penalties, not excluding dismissal from the clerical state if the case so warrants."&lt;ref name="Canon1395"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.saintwiki.com/index.php?title=Code_of_Canon_Law,_Book_VI_Part_II:_Penalties_for_Particular_Offenses#TITLE_V:_OFFENSES_AGAINST_SPECIAL_OBLIGATIONS | title=Code_of_Canon_Law,_Book_VI_Part_II:_Penalties_for_Particular_Offenses#TITLE_V:_OFFENSES_AGAINST_SPECIAL_OBLIGATIONS | publisher=[[Holy See|Vatican]] | accessdate=18 April 2010 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715230442/http://www.saintwiki.com/index.php?title=Code_of_Canon_Law,_Book_VI_Part_II:_Penalties_for_Particular_Offenses#TITLE_V:_OFFENSES_AGAINST_SPECIAL_OBLIGATIONS | archivedate=15 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[De delictis gravioribus]], the letter sent in May 2001 by then Cardinal [[Joseph Ratzinger]] (who later became [[Pope Benedict XVI]]) – Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and according to Father [[Thomas Patrick Doyle]], who has served as an expert witness on Pontifical Canon Law, [[Crimen Sollicitationis]] was in force until May 2001.

In April, Pope [[John Paul II]] issued a letter stating that "a sin against the [[Thou shalt not commit adultery|Sixth Commandment]] of the [[Ten Commandments|Decalogue]] by a cleric with a minor under 18 years of age is to be considered a grave sin, or '[[delictum gravius]].'"&lt;ref name="VaticanStudy"/&gt; In the letter, ''Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela'' (Safeguarding the Sanctity of the Sacraments), "§1 Reservation to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) is also extended to a delict against the sixth commandment of the Decalogue committed by a cleric with a minor below the age of eighteen years. §2 One who has perpetrated the delict mentioned in §1 is to be punished according to the gravity of the offense, not excluding dismissal or deposition."&lt;ref name="Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bishop-accountability.org/resources/resource-files/churchdocs/SacramentorumAndNormaeEnglish.htm | work=Vatican | title=Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela | accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the CDF was given a broader mandate to address the sex abuse cases only from 2001&lt;ref name="stevencwelsh.com"&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.stevencwelsh.com/faith/Catholic-News-sexual-abuse-data-Vatican-news-april-203.php | work=Avvenire | title=Promoter Of Justice At Doctrine Of Faith On Paedophilia | accessdate=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; – prior to that date, the 1917 Code of Canon Law permitted sexual abuse cases by the clergy to be handled by the Congregation, for the Congregation to open cases itself, or for the [[Catholic Church hierarchy#Ordinaries and local ordinaries|Ordinary]] to handle judgement.&lt;ref name="Mullaney2003"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullaney | first1 = Michael | year = 2003 | title = Graviora delicta: The Duty to Report Clerical Sexual Abuse to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith | url = | journal = [[Irish Theological Quarterly]] | volume = 68 | issue = | pages = 292–293 | doi=10.1177/002114000306800306}}&lt;/ref&gt; All priestly sex crimes cases were placed under the CDF which, in the majority of cases, then recommended immediate action.&lt;ref name="Allen2010"&gt;Allen, John L, JR.

* Every allegation of sexual abuse of a minor by a priest is investigated by the local diocese and, if there is even a "semblance of truth" the case is referred to the Vatican CDF. "The local bishop always retains power to protect children by restricting the activities of any priest in his diocese."
* Civil law concerning reporting of crimes to the appropriate authorities should always be followed.
* The CDF may authorise the local bishop to try the case. If a priest (who has the right of appeal to the CDF) is found guilty, a number of canonical penalties are possible, including dismissal from the clerical state. "The question of damages can also be treated directly during these procedures."
* Some cases can be referred directly to the Pope, who can issue a decree of dismissal from the priesthood ex officio.
* Other disciplinary measures short of dismissal are available where the priest has undertaken to live a life of prayer and penance, but he can be dismissed if he breaks the conditions imposed.
* The CDF continues to update the 2001 law (Motu Proprio Sacramentorum Sanctitatis tutela) in the light of special faculties granted to the CDF by Popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI.

In May, in line with the 1983 Code of Canon Law and the 1990 Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches, a letter from the CDF was sent to the Catholic bishops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20010518_epistula_graviora%20delicta_lt.html Instruction ''De delictis gravioribus''.] An English translation of this 2001 Instruction appeared on [http://www.bishop-accountability.org/resources/resource-files/churchdocs/EpistulaEnglish.htm ''Origins'', 31:32] (24 January 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vatican instituted reforms to prevent future United States abuse by requiring background checks for all church employees who have contact with children.&lt;ref name="charteryouth"/&gt; Since then, in the US, over 2&amp;nbsp;million volunteers and employees; 52,000 clerics; 6,205 candidates for ordination have had their backgrounds evaluated.&lt;ref name=usccblist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usccb.org/catholic-church-sxl-ab.pdf |title="What has the Catholic Church done to effectively respond to sexual abuse by church personnel?" |publisher=United States Conference of Catholic Bishops |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414123246/http://www.usccb.org/catholic-church-sxl-ab.pdf |archivedate=14 April 2010 |accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, the USCCB established the "Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People", a comprehensive set of procedures for addressing allegations of sexual abuse of minors by Catholic clergy. (More details in the Episcopal Responses section above.)

====2003====
[[Pope John Paul II]] stated that "there is no place in the priesthood and religious life for those who would harm the young".&lt;ref name="Walsh"&gt;Walsh, ''John Paul II: A Light for the World'' (2003), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, the [[Pontifical Academy for Life]] organized a three-day conference, entitled "Abuse of Children and Young People by Catholic Priests and Religious", where eight non-Catholic psychiatric experts were invited to speak to near all Vatican dicasteries' representatives. The panel of experts overwhelmingly opposed implementation of policies of "zero-tolerance" such as was proposed by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops. One expert called such policies a "case of overkill" since they do not permit flexibility to allow for differences among individual cases.&lt;ref name=VaticanStudy /&gt;

Archbishop Csaba Ternyak, secretary of the [[Congregation for the Clergy|Congregation for Clergy]], put the following question to the experts: "[T]o what degree one can talk about the rehabilitation of the offender, what are the most effective methods of treatment, and on what grounds we can say that a person who has never offended is at risk to sexually molest someone?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_35_43/ai_n27371508/ |title=Most unaware of bishops' responses to clergy sex abuse |date=31 August 2007 |work=National Catholic Reporter |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016214259/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1141/is_35_43/ai_n27371508/ |archivedate=16 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ternyak spoke about the way that the crisis had damaged the priest-bishop relationship. He noted that there was a "sense of gloom" felt by the overwhelming majority of priests who had not been accused of any abuse but nonetheless who perceived that their bishops had turned against them and therefore had "become disillusioned about the effectiveness of the laws of the Church to defend their dignity and their inalienable rights". Ternyak also noted that "there have been more than a few suicides among accused priests."&lt;ref name=VaticanStudy /&gt;

Two researchers reported that abuse cases had "steeply declined" after 1985 and that responses to abuse had changed substantially over 50 years, with suspension becoming more common than reinstatement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2009-11-17-Catholic-abuse-report_N.htm |title=Report:Homosexuality no factor in abusive priests |accessdate= |author=Rachel Zoll |authorlink= |date=17 November 2009 |work=USA Today|pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a statement, read by Archbishop [[Silvano Maria Tomasi]] at a meeting of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] in [[Geneva]] on 22 September 2009, the Holy See stated that the majority of Catholic clergy who had committed acts of sexual abuse against under-18-year-olds should not be viewed as pedophiles, but as homosexuals who are attracted to sex with adolescent males. The statement said that rather than pedophilia, "it would be more correct to speak of [[ephebophilia]]; being a homosexual attraction to adolescent males ... Of all priests involved in the abuses, 80 to 90% belong to this sexual orientation minority which is sexually engaged with adolescent boys between the ages of 11 and 17."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/28/sex-abuse-religion-vatican | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Sex abuse rife in other religions, says Vatican | first=Riazat | last=Butt | date=28 September 2009 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Margaret Smith and Karen Terry, two researchers who worked on the John Jay Report, cautioned against equating the high incidence of abuse by priests against boys with homosexuality, calling it an oversimplification and "an unwarranted conclusion" to assert that the majority of priests who abused male victims are gay. Though "the majority of the abusive acts were homosexual in nature ... participation in homosexual acts is not the same as sexual identity as a gay man."

Msgr. Charles J.

Moreover, following the promulgation of the 1983 Code of Canon Law, there was a period of uncertainty as to which of the "delicta graviora" were reserved to the competency of this dicastery. Only with the 2001 "Motu Proprio" did the crime of pedophilia again become our exclusive remit... In the years (2001–2010) the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF) had "considered accusations concerning around three thousand cases of diocesan and religious priests, which refer to crimes committed over the last fifty years."&lt;ref name="Sacramentorum Sanctitatis Tutela"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stevencwelsh.com"/&gt;

In July 2010 the Vatican issued a document to clarify their position.

In May, the Vatican published new guidelines, drawn up by Cardinal [[William Levada]], the head of the [[Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith]], on dealing with the clergy sexual abuse cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/17/world/europe/17vatican.html Vatican Tells Bishops to Set Clear Strategy Against Abuse], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines tell the bishops and heads of Catholic religious orders worldwide to develop "clear and coordinated" procedures for dealing with the sexual abuse allegation by May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110517/ap_on_re_eu/eu_vatican_church_abuse Vatican suggests bishops report abuse to police]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519194414/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110517/ap_on_re_eu/eu_vatican_church_abuse |date=19 May 2011 }}, [[Associated Press]], 16 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The guidelines instruct the bishops to cooperate with the police and respect the relevant local laws in investigating and reporting allegations of sexual abuse by the clergy to the civic authorities, but do not make such reporting mandatory. The guidelines also reinforce bishops' exclusive authority in dealing with abuse cases. Victims advocacy groups criticized the new guidelines as insufficient, arguing that the recommendations do not have the status of church law and do not provide any specific enforcement mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20110520101702/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/vaticans-paedophile-guidelines-spark-fury-among-sex-abuse-victims-16000900.html Vatican's paedophile guidelines spark fury among sex abuse victims], [[Belfast Telegraph]], 16 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/may/16/vatican-sex-abuse-guidelines-criticised Vatican sex abuse guidelines 'leave bishops behind cover-ups in control'], [[The Guardian]], 16 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014====
The [[Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors]] ({{lang-it|Pontificia Commissione per la Tutela dei Minori}}) was instituted by [[Pope Francis]] on 22 March 2014 for the safeguarding of minors.&lt;ref name="Bollettino"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/de/bollettino/pubblico/2014/03/22/0199/00444.html | title=Comunicato della Sala Stampa: Istituzione della Pontificia Commissione per la Tutela dei Minori | publisher=[[Holy See Press Office]] | date=March 22, 2014 | accessdate=March 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is headed by [[Boston]]'s cardinal archbishop, [[Sean P.

====2018====
At the beginning of 2018, Francis denied overwhelming reports of widespread sexual abuse by priests in Chile. In the face of the resulting outcry, he introduced an investigation that led to every bishop in Chile submitting his resignation; only a few of these were accepted, however.&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Poblete and Patrick J.

At mid-year, amidst a series of abuse scandals in many countries, including the revelation that over a 50-year period, more than 300 priests were plausibly accused of abuse in the state of Pennsylvania alone, Pope Francis spoke of his "shame", without however offering concrete steps to remove abusive priests or sanction those who took part in cover-ups.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pope-francis-stops-short-of-offering-steps-to-remove-abusive-priests/ Pope Francis stops short of offering concrete steps to remove abusive priests]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of church responses==
While the church in the United States claims to have addressed the issue, some disagree. Mark Honigsbaum of ''The Guardian'' wrote in 2006 that, "despite the National Review Board's own estimates that there have been some 5,000 abusive priests in the US, to date 150 have been successfully prosecuted."  Some critics of the church, such as Patrick Wall, attribute this to a lack of cooperation from the church. In California, for example, the archdiocese{{clarify|date=October 2015}} has sought to block the disclosure of confidential counseling records on two priests, arguing that such action would violate their First Amendment right on religious protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/may/04/religion.uk |title='Everywhere I turned, I ran into sexual abuse' | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Mark | last=Honigsbaum | date=4 May 2006 | accessdate=1 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Lakeland]] claims Church leaders who enabled abuse were too frequently careless about their own [[accountability]] and the accountability of perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votf.org/July2005/Paul_lakeland.pdf|title=Accountability, Credibility and Authority|website=Votf.org|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the [[BBC]] reported that the latest research by experts indicate that Catholic priests may be no more likely than others to abuse. However, a major cause of the scandal was the cover-ups and other alleged shortcomings in the way the church hierarchy has dealt with the abuses.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; Particularly, the actions of Catholic bishops in responding to allegations of clerical abuse were harshly criticized.&lt;ref&gt;Marziali, Carl (18 July 2003).

In September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI lamented that the Roman Catholic Church had not been vigilant enough or quick enough in responding to the problem of sexual abuse by Catholic clergy.&lt;ref name="BenedictXVI-shock-and-sadness"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://us.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/europe/09/16/uk.pope.visit/index.html?hpt=C1 |title= Pope addresses sex abuse scandal as he starts visit to Britain |date=17 September 2010 |accessdate=17 September 2010 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Benedict laicized 400 priests for abuses in two years of his papacy.[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/01/17/pope-benedict-defrock-priests_n_4618932.html] A representative of [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests]] (SNAP), a group representing abuse victims, criticized the pope's remarks as "disingenuous" because, in her opinion, the church had in fact been "prompt and vigilant" in concealing the scandal.&lt;ref name="BenedictXVI-shock-and-sadness"/&gt; After Benedict's resignation in 2013, he was criticized by SNAP for allegedly protecting the church's reputation "over the safety of children." Representatives from the [[Center for Constitutional Rights]] (at the time engaged in an International Criminal Court case against Pope Benedict in which they were acting for SNAP), alleged that Pope Benedict had been directly involved in covering up some of the crimes.&lt;ref&gt;McVeigh, Karen.

===For non-removal===

March organized by Facciamo Breccia against the interference of the Catholic Church in Italian Politics. The placard says: If Ratzinger really wants to play inquisitor that much, why doesn't he go deal with his pedophile priests?]]

The Catholic hierarchy has been criticized for not acting more quickly and decisively to remove, [[laicization|laicize]] and report priests accused of sexual misconduct. Cardinal [[Roger Mahony]] of the [[Archdiocese of Los Angeles]], said: "We have said repeatedly that ... our understanding of this problem and the way it's dealt with today evolved, and that in those years ago, decades ago, people didn't realize how serious this was, and so, rather than pulling people out of ministry directly and fully, they were moved."&lt;ref name=NationalCatholicReview&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ncronline.org/news/accountability/bishops-were-warned-abusive-priests |title=Bishops were warned of abusive priests |date=20 March 2009 |first=Tom |last=Roberts |accessdate=29 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early opponent of the treatment of sexually abusive priests was Father [[Gerald Fitzgerald (priest)|Gerald Fitzgerald]], the founder of [[The Congregation of the Servants of the Paraclete]]. Although Fitzgerald started the Servants of the Paraclete to assist priests who were struggling with alcohol and substance abuse problems, he soon began receiving priests who had sexually abused minors. Initially, Fitzgerald attempted to treat such priests using the same spiritual methods that he used with his other "guests". However, as he grew convinced of the futility of treating sexually abusive priests, Fitzgerald came to oppose vehemently the return of sexual abusers to duties as parish priests. He wrote regularly to bishops in the United States and to Vatican officials, including the pope, of his opinion that many sexual abusers in the priesthood could not be cured and should be laicizied immediately.&lt;ref name=nytimesGoodstein/&gt;

Eventually, Fitzgerald lost control of the Servants of the Paraclete. The center began to employ medical and psychological professionals who added psychiatry and medical treatment to the spiritual regimen of treatment favored by Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald continued to oppose these modifications to his treatment regimen until his death in 1969.&lt;ref name=nytimesGoodstein/&gt;

Bishop [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tucson#Bishops|Manuel D. Moreno]] of Tucson, Arizona, United States repeatedly attempted to have two local abusive priests laicized and disciplined, pleading unsuccessfully in a letter of April 1997 with Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to have one laicized; he was first suspended in 1990 and convicted by the church in 1997 of five crimes, including sexual solicitation in the confessional. The two were finally laicized in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/article_6fd9e4bd-fcfc-50d6-ab3f-2d14c95219fd.html|title=Moreno struggled to defrock 2 priests|author=Patty Machelor Arizona Daily Star|work=Arizona Daily Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Moreno had been strongly criticized for failing to take action until details of his efforts became public.

In a ''The New York Times'' article, Bishop Blase J. Cupich, chairman of the United States Bishops Committee for the Protection of Children and Young People, is quoted explaining why Father Fitzgerald's advice "went largely unheeded for 50 years": First, "cases of sexually abusive priests were considered to be rare." Second, Father Fitzgerald's, "views, by and large, were considered bizarre with regard to not treating people medically, but only spiritually, and also segregating a whole population with sexual problems on a deserted island." And finally, "There was mounting evidence in the world of psychology that indicated that when medical treatment is given, these people can, in fact, go back to ministry." This was a view which Cupich characterized as one that "the bishops came to regret."&lt;ref name=nytimesGoodstein&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/03/us/03church.html?_r=1&amp;hpw "Early Alarm for Church on Abusers in the Clergy"] by Laurie Goodstein, ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 several secular and liberal Catholics were calling for [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s [[Resignation of Pope Benedict XVI|resignation]], citing the actions of then Cardinal Ratzinger's blocking of efforts to remove a priest convicted of child abuse.&lt;ref name=nty&gt;{{cite news|title=Do Popes Quit?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/weekinreview/11wakin.html?ref=europe|accessdate=13 February 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 April 2010|pages=1|first=Daniel J.|last=Wakin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pope did eventually resign in 2013, although he said that he did so because of his declining health.&lt;ref name="VatRadio_resign"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/articolo.asp?c=663815 | title=Pope Benedict XVI announces his resignation at end of month | publisher=Vatican Radio | date=11 February 2013 | accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Monsignor [[William J.

===For secrecy among bishops===
As reported by the ''Boston Globe,'' some bishops had facilitated compensation payments to victims on condition that the allegations remained secret.&lt;ref name=globesecret&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories/013102_priests.htm|title=Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church / Scandal and coverup|work=boston.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, according to the ''Boston Globe'', the Archdiocese of Boston secretly settled child sexual abuse claims against at least 70 priests from 1992 to 2002.&lt;ref name=globesecret/&gt;

In November 2009, the Irish [[Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse]] reported its findings in which it concluded that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"the Dublin Archdiocese's pre-occupations in dealing with cases of child sexual abuse, at least until the mid 1990s, were the maintenance of secrecy, the avoidance of scandal, the protection of the reputation of the Church, and the preservation of its assets. All other considerations, including the welfare of children and justice for victims, were subordinated to these priorities. The Archdiocese did not implement its own canon law rules and did its best to avoid any application of the law of the State".&lt;ref name="justice.ie"&gt;{{Cite news|title =Report by Commission of Investigation into Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|url=http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Pages/PB09000504}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2010, [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] wanted to prosecute the Pope for [[Crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] due to what they see as his role in intentionally covering up abuse by priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/apr/13/pope-prosecution-dawkins|title=The pope should stand trial|author=Richard Dawkins|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 April 2010|accessdate=18 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/faith/article7094310.ece|title=Richard Dawkins calls for arrest of Pope Benedict XVI|work=[[The Times]]|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=18 April 2010 | location=London | first=Marc | last=Horne}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a CNN interview a few days later, however, Dawkins declined to discuss the international crime law court's definition of crimes against humanity, saying it is a difficult legal question.&lt;ref name="youtube"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ccbVCxWNn8|title=YouTube|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2010, a lawsuit was filed in the Milwaukee Federal Court by an anonymous "John Doe 16" against the Vatican and Pope Benedict XVI. The plaintiff accused Ratzinger and others of having covered up abuse cases to avoid scandal to the detriment of the concerned children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/22/26652.htm|title=Illinois Man Sues Pope, Vatican in Alleged Sex Abuse Case|author=Nick Divito|work=[[Courthouse News Service]]|date=22 April 2010|accessdate=25 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319023951/http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/04/22/26652.htm|archivedate=19 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2011, two German lawyers initiated charges against Pope Benedict XVI at the [[International Criminal Court]]. As one of the reasons for the charges they referred also to the "strong suspicion" that Joseph Ratzinger, as head of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], covered up the sexual abuse of children and youths and protected the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0223/1224290630240.html|title=Charges initiated against Pope for crimes against humanity|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=23 February 2011|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=Patsy McGarry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Internal division became public, with [[Christoph Cardinal Schönborn]] accusing Cardinal [[Angelo Sodano]] of blocking Ratzinger's investigation of a high-profile case in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/ncr-today/kiss-and-make-session-wont-end-debate-sodano|title=Kiss-and-make-up session won't end debate on Sodano|work=[[National Catholic Reporter]]|date=28 June 2010|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=John L.

In the trial of the French bishop Pierre Pican, who  received a suspended jail sentence for failing to denounce an abusive priest, the retired Cardinal [[Dario Castrillon Hoyos]] wrote a letter to support Pican in his decision. Exposed to heavy critiques, Hoyos claimed to have had the approval of Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jp72iEhN5qWyiHYV7YxKwKk67BZgD9F51G6G0|title=Cardinal: late pope backed priest-shielding|agency=Associated Press |date=18 April 2010|accessdate= 18 April 2010|author=Harold Heckle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/04/17/us-pope-abuse-cardinal-idUSTRE63G1SH20100417|title=John Paul backed praise for hiding abuse: Cardinal|work=Reuters News Agency|date=17 April 2010|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=Tom Heneghan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Hoyos was heavily criticized again. This time the [[Congregation for the Clergy]] was blamed of having opposed in 1997 to the newly adapted rules of the Irish bishops, demanding the denouncement of every abusive priest to the police. The Archbishop of Dublin [[Diarmuid Martin]] described the cooperation with the Congregation for the Clergy as "disastrous".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2011/0117/1224287680501.html|title=Vatican edict in 1997 rejected calls to report priests who abused|work=[[Irish Times]]|date=17 January 2010|accessdate= 28 April 2011|author=Patsy McGarry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For Vatican statements denying canonical competence===
{{canon law}}
A Vatican [[spokesman]] stated, "When individual institutions of national churches are implicated, that does not regard the competence of the Holy See...The competence of the [[Holy See]] is at the level of the Holy See."&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe11/2/1013"&gt;[https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/columns/2014/02/10/united-nations-vatican-city-what-now-pope-francis/iwcJ7PnJqwwWsEjZhTd4wO/story.html No excuses for priestly child abuse]&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing canons 331 and 333 of the ''[[1983 Code of Canon Law]]'', James Carroll of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' asserted that "On the question of how far papal authority extends, the [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law of the Catholic Church]] could not be clearer" and alleges that the Holy See's denial of competency contravenes canon law. Canon 331 states that "The [[pope|vicar of Christ]].. . possesses full, immediate, and universal [[ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary]] power in the Church, which he is always able to exercise freely", and canon 333 states that "...[[ex officio|By virtue of his office]], the [[pope|Roman pontiff]] not only possesses power over the [[Catholic Church|universal church]], but also obtains the [[petrine primacy|primacy]] of [[ordinary (Catholic Church)|ordinary power]] over all [[particular church]]es and groups of them."&lt;ref name="BostonGlobe11/2/1013"/&gt;

Silvano Tomasi, the [[Holy See and the United Nations|Holy See's ambassador to the U.N.]] stated that the Vatican was not responsible for abusive priests because "priests are citizens of their own states, and they fall under the [[jurisdiction]] of their own country" but the United Nations report differed claiming that since priests are "bound by obedience to the pope" under [[canon law (Catholic Church)|canon law]], then the Holy See is accountable. The report also urged the Vatican to insist that priests and bishops involve the police in all abuse reports and end a ''"code of silence"'' leading to [[whistleblower]]s being ''"ostracized, demoted and fired."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/worldnow/la-fg-wn-un-catholic-church-abusive-priests-20140205,0,3036334.story|title=Catholic Church 'systematically' protected abusive priests, U.N. says|author=Los Angeles Times|date=5 February 2014|work=latimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For lack of transparency in Vatican proceedings===
To place the cases under the competence of the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] has been criticized by some as making the process more secretive and lengthening the time required to address the allegations. For example, in his biography of John Paul II, David Yallop asserts that the backlog of referrals to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith for action against sexually abusive priests is so large that it takes 18 months to merely get a reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Yallup|first=David|title=The Power and the Glory: Inside the Dark Heart of Pope John Paul II's Vatican|year=2009|publisher=Basic Books|isbn=978-0-465-01542-9|pages=497|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blCER-BslvAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vatican officials have expressed concern that the church's insistence on confidentiality in its treatment of priestly sexual abuse cases was seen as a ban on reporting serious accusations to the civil authorities. Early in 2010 Cardinal [[Claudio Hummes]], the head of the [[Congregation for Clergy]], finally said that instances of sexual abuse by priests were "criminal facts" as well as serious sins and required co-operation with the civil justice system. Italian academic {{Interlanguage link multi|Lucetta Scaraffia|it}} described the conspiracy involved in hiding the offense as ''[[omerta]]'', [[the Mafia]] code of silence, and said that "We can hypothesise that a greater female presence, not at a subordinate level, would have been able to rip the veil of masculine secrecy that in the past often covered the denunciation of these misdeeds with silence".&lt;ref name=schonborn/&gt;

Some parties have interpreted the ''[[Crimen sollicitationis]]'' – a 1962 document ("Instruction") of the Holy Office (which is now called the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith) codifying procedures to be followed in cases of [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priests]] or bishops of the [[Catholic Church]] accused of having used the sacrament of [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|Penance]] to make sexual advances to penitents&lt;ref name=Doyle&gt;[http://www.richardsipe.com/Doyle/2008/2008-10-03-Commentary%20on%201922%20and%201962%20documents.pdf Thomas Doyle, ''The 1922 instruction and the 1962 instruction "''Crimen sollicitationis''" promulgated by the Vatican]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bishop-accountability.org/resources/resource-files/churchdocs/EpistulaEnglish.htm De delictis gravioribus], footnote 3&lt;/ref&gt; – as a directive from the Vatican to keep all allegations of sexual abuse secret, leading to widespread media coverage of its contents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/08/06/eveningnews/main566978.shtml|title=Sex Crimes Cover-Up By Vatican?|date=6 August 2003|work=cbsnews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for some of those making abuse allegations claimed that the document demonstrated a systematic conspiracy to conceal such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/aug/18/uk.religion|title=Row over Vatican order to conceal priests' sex abuse|author=Owen Bowcott|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican responded that the document was not only widely misinterpreted, but moreover had been superseded by more recent guidelines in the 1960s and 1970s, and especially the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/article.cfm?article_id=3127|title=Signs of the Times|work=America Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===For failure to prevent further abuse===
{{cquote|It is easy to think that when we talk about the crisis of child rape and abuse that we are talking about the past – and the Catholic Church would have us believe that this most tragic era in church history is over. It is not. It lives on today. Pedophiles are still in the priesthood. Coverups of their crimes are happening now, and bishops in many cases are continuing to refuse to turn information over to the criminal justice system. Cases are stalled and cannot go forward because the church has such power to stop them. Children are still being harmed and victims cannot heal.|||Abuse victim, Mary Dispenza&lt;ref name=MaryDispenza&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/02/06/opinion/dispenza-priest-abuse/|title=Opinion: Pope Francis must finally root out child abuse  - CNN.com|author=Mary Dispenza|date=6 February 2014|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mary Dispenza states further that crimes against children took place in the past, take place now and will continue in the future unless [[Pope Francis]] and the bishops act decisively to ensure that child safety has higher priority than protecting priests and the image of the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=MaryDispenza/&gt;

==United Nations==
The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, in early 2014, issued a report asserting that the pope and the Roman Catholic Church have not done enough and protect their reputation rather than protect children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/u-n-panel-blasts-vatican-covering-sex-abuse-article-1.1602967 "Pope Francis pressured by U.N. committee to act on priest sex abuse cases"], [[Associated Press|AP]] via New York ''Daily News'', 5 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The panel of the committee wants all known or suspected child molesters removed, archives on abusers and [[Bishop (Catholic Church)|Bishops]] who covered up abuse opened, and instances of abuse handed to law enforcement agencies to be investigated and prosecuted. A joint statement of the panel said,
{{quote|The committee is gravely concerned that the Holy See has not acknowledged the extent of the crimes committed, has not taken the necessary measures to address cases of child sexual abuse and to protect children, and has adopted policies and practices which have led to the continuation of the abuse by, and the impunity of, the perpetrators&lt;ref name=Winfield&gt;Winfield, Nicole, [http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/accuses+Vatican+adopting+policies+that+allowed+priests+rape/9471164/story.html "Pope Francis under pressure to act on abuse after UN committee accuses Vatican of complicity"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208012147/http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/accuses+Vatican+adopting+policies+that+allowed+priests+rape/9471164/story.html |date=8 February 2014 }}, AP via Montreal ''Gazette'', February 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Euronews/&gt;}}

Committee chair, [[Kirsten Sandberg]] enumerated some major findings, that pedophile priests were sent to new parishes or other countries without police being informed, that the Vatican never insisted on bishops reporting abuse to police, and that known abusers still have access to children. [[Barbara Blaine]] of [[Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests|SNAP]] said,
{{quote|This report gives hope to the hundreds of thousands of deeply wounded and still suffering clergy sex abuse victims across the world. Now it's up to secular officials to follow the U.N.'s lead and step in to safeguard the vulnerable because Catholic officials are either incapable or unwilling to do so.&lt;ref name=Winfield/&gt;}}

The UN report prompted discussions of specific areas of controversy, including secrecy among bishops and Vatican statements denying responsibility which in canon law they have.

British author and Catholic social activist [[Paul Vallely]] wrote that he felt the UN report had been hurt by the Commission having gone well beyond the issue of child abuse to issues such as contraception. However, he also felt the report did bring important pressure on the Vatican on important issues like reporting cases to police.&lt;ref&gt;Vallely, Paul, [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/opinion/vatican-missteps-and-un-blunders.html "Vatican Missteps and U.N. Blunders"], New York ''Times'', 11 February 2014. Retrieved 11 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
{{Main|Media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases}}

The media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases is a major aspect of the academic literature surrounding the pederastic priest scandal.

In 2002 the discovery that the sex abuse by Catholic priests was widespread in the U.S. received significant media coverage. For the first 100 days ''[[The New York Times]]'' had 225 pieces, including news and commentary, and the story appeared on its front page on 26 occasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nelson|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Sex Abuse in the American Catholic Church and the Attempt at Redemption|journal=Communication &amp; Theater Association of Minnesota|year=2009|volume=Summer|pages=37–51|quote=From a review of ''The New York Times'', January 9 through April 18, 2002.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentator Tom Hoopes wrote that:

during the first half of 2002, the 61 largest newspapers in California ran nearly 2,000 stories about sexual abuse in Catholic institutions, mostly concerning past allegations. During the same period, those newspapers ran four stories about the federal government’s discovery of the much larger — and ongoing — abuse scandal in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cbsnews.com/news/has-media-ignored-sex-abuse-in-school/&lt;/ref&gt;

Anglican writer Philip Jenkins supported many of these arguments stating that media coverage of the abuse story had become "..a gross efflorescence of anti-catholic rhetoric.".&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip, The New Anti-Catholicism – the Last Acceptable Prejudice, Oxford University Press, 2004, pp. 133–57&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walter V. Robinson]], an American journalist and journalism professor, led the ''[[Boston Globe]]'''s coverage of the Roman Catholic sex abuse cases, for which the newspaper won the [[Pulitzer Prize for Public Service]]. Robinson was also a Pulitzer Prize finalist in Investigative Reporting in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/bios/robinson.htm |title=Boston Globe / Spotlight / Abuse in the Catholic Church |publisher=Boston.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2006/08/walter_v_robins_1.html |title=Walter V.

In Ireland television journalism similarly played a key role in helping public awareness of widespread sexual abuse of children by priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kenny|first=Colum|title=Significant Television: Journalism, Sex Abuse and the Catholic Church in Ireland|journal=Irish Communications Review|date=January 2009|volume=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''The Wall Street Journal''-NBC News poll found that 64 percent of those queried thought Catholic priests "frequently" abused children; however, there is no data that indicates that priests commit abuse more often than the general population of males.&lt;ref name="news.uk.msn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.uk.msn.com/world/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=152959036|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110054146/http://news.uk.msn.com/world/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=152959036|dead-url=yes|archive-date=10 November 2013|title=Priests Commit No More Abuse Than Other Males|publisher=news.uk.msn.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC documentary in 2006===
Produced by a victim of clerical sex abuse for the British Broadcasting Corporation ([[BBC]]) in 2006, the documentary ''[[Sex Crimes and the Vatican]]'' included the claim that all allegations of sex abuse are to be sent to the Vatican rather than the civil authorities, and that "a secret church decree called '[[Crimen sollicitationis]]' ... imposes the strictest oath of secrecy on the child victim, the priest dealing with the allegation, and any witnesses. Breaking that oath means instant banishment from the Catholic Church – excommunication."&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5389684.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Programmes – Panorama – Sex crimes and the Vatican|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary quoted the 2005 [[Ferns Report]]: "A culture of secrecy and fear of scandal that led bishops to place the interests of the Catholic Church ahead of the safety of children".

Canon lawyer Thomas Doyle, who was included in the documentary as supporting the picture that it presented, later wrote with regard to the 1962 ''Crimen sollicitations'' and the 2001 ''[[De delictis gravioribus]]'' as well as the Church's formal investigation into charges of abuse: "There is no basis to assume that the Holy See envisioned this process to be a substitute for any secular legal process, criminal or civil. It is also incorrect to assume, as some have unfortunately done, that these two Vatican documents are proof of a conspiracy to hide sexually abusive priests or to prevent the disclosure of sexual crimes committed by clerics to secular authorities."&lt;ref name="bishop-accountability"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bishop-accountability.org/news2010/03_04/2010_03_12_Doyle_VeryImportant.htm|title=Very Important Tom Doyle Comments on Crimen Sollicitationis, Thomas Doyle, Voice from the Desert, March 12, 2010|publisher=bishop-accountability.org|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reform-network"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reform-network.net/?m=20100316|title=Voice from the Desert   » 2010 » March » 16|publisher=reform-network.net|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two years later in 2008 Doyle said of attempts to reform the Catholic Church that it was like "trudging through what can best be described as a swamp of toxic waste".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.votfnj.org/page.cfm?Web_ID=142 |title=Thomas Doyle On Church Reform: VOTF and Reform of the Governmental Structure of the Catholic Church |last=Doyle |first=Thomas |date=January 2008 |work=Voice of the Faithful – New Jersey |publisher=NJ VOTF |accessdate=5 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728164657/http://www.votfnj.org/page.cfm?Web_ID=142 |archivedate=28 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Church was reluctant to provide to the civil authorities information about the Church's own investigations into charges. In the BBC documentary, [[Rick Romley]], a district attorney who initiated an investigation of the Diocese of Phoenix, stated that "the secrecy, the obstruction I saw during my investigation was unparalleled in my entire career as a DA...it was so difficult to obtain any information from the Church at all." He reported archives of documents and incriminating evidence pertaining to sex abuse that were kept from the authorities, which under the law could not be subpoenaed. "The Church fails to acknowledge such a serious problem but more than that, it is not a passiveness but an openly obstructive way of not allowing authorities to try to stop the abuse within the Church. They fought us every step of the way."&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

==Debate over causes==
{{Main|Debate on the causes of clerical child abuse}}
There have been many debates over the causes of sex abuse cases.

===Seminary training===
The 2004 [[John Jay Report]], a report commissioned by the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, stated "the problem was largely the result of poor [[seminary]] training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s."&lt;ref name=SGNTBFPP&gt;{{cite news|last=Zoll|first=Rachel|title=Study: Gays Not to Blame for Pedophile Priests|url=http://www.edgenewyork.com/index.php?ch=news&amp;sc=national&amp;sc2=news&amp;sc3=&amp;id=119731|accessdate=9 July 2012|newspaper=The Edge/Associated Press|date=18 May 2011|quote=the problem was largely the result of poor seminary training and insufficient emotional support for men ordained in the 1940s and 1950s, who were not able to withstand the social upheaval they confronted as pastors in the 1960s.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report by the [[National Review Board]] issued simultaneously with the ''John Jay Report'' pointed to two major deficiencies on the part of seminaries: failure to screen candidates adequately, followed by failure to "form" these candidates appropriately for the challenges of celibacy. These themes are taken up by a recent memoir by Vincent J. Miles&lt;ref name="Miles"&gt;Miles, Vincent J. (2012) [http://boysofthecloth.com ''Boys of the Cloth: The Accidental Role of Church Reforms in Causing and Curbing Abuse by Priests'']. Lanham, Maryland: Hamilton Books.&lt;/ref&gt; that combines a first-hand account of his life in a minor seminary during the 1960s with a review of the scientific literature about sexually abusive behavior. Miles identifies specific aspects of seminary life that could have predisposed future priests to engage in such behavior.

===Impact of psychology from previous decades===
Some bishops and psychiatrists have asserted that the prevailing psychology of the times suggested that people could be cured of such behavior through counseling.&lt;ref name="adrift"&gt;Steinfels, ''A People Adrift'' (2003). pp. 40–6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Plante]], a psychiatrist specializing in abuse counseling and considered an expert on clerical abuse, states "the vast majority of the research on sexual abuse of minors didn't emerge until the early 1980s. So, it appeared reasonable at the time to treat these men and then return them to their priestly duties. In hindsight, this was a tragic mistake."&lt;ref name="Plante"&gt;Plante, Thomas, [http://www.psychwww.com/psyrelig/plante.html "A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse"], San Jose ''Mercury News'', 24 March 2002 (updated online version)&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert S. Bennett, the Roman Catholic Washington attorney who headed the National Review Board's research committee, identified "too much faith in psychiatrists" as one of the key problems concerning Catholic sex abuse cases.&lt;ref name="sexabusereport"&gt;{{cite web|last=Filteau |first=Jerry |title=Report says clergy sexual abuse brought 'smoke of Satan' into church |publisher=Catholic News Service |year=2004 |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/abuse/abuse08.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20040626055022/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/abuse/abuse08.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 June 2004 |accessdate=10 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 40% of the abusive priests had received counseling before being reassigned.&lt;ref name="JohnJay"&gt;{{cite web | author = Terry, Karen| title = John Jay Report| publisher =John Jay College of Criminal Justice | year = 2004| url =http://www.bishop-accountability.org/reports/2004_02_27_JohnJay/index.html | accessdate =9 February 2008 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedophilia and ephebophilia===
In ''[[Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention]]'', Cimbolic &amp; Cartor (2006) noted that because of the large share of post-[[pubescent]] male minors among cleric victims there is need to further study the differential variables related to [[ephebophilia]] (sexual interest in mid-to-late [[Adolescence|adolescents]], generally ages 15 to 19)&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |last=Blanchard |first=R. |last2=Lykins |first2=A. D. |last3=Wherrett |first3=D. |last4=Kuban |first4=M. E. |last5=Cantor |first5=J. M. |last6=Blak |first6=T. |last7=Dickey |first7=R. |last8=Klassen |first8=P.

Looking at ephebophilia through the lens of priest sexual abuse. Sexual Addiction and Compulsivity: The Journal of Treatment and Prevention, 13(4), 347–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Cartor, Cimbolic &amp; Tallon (2008) found that 6 percent of the cleric offenders in the [[John Jay Report]] are pedophiles, 32 percent ephebophiles, 15 percent 11 and 12 year olds only (both male and female), 20 percent indiscriminate, and 27 percent mildly indiscriminate.&lt;ref name="cartor" /&gt;

They also found distinct differences between the pedophile and ephebophile groups. They reported that there may be "another group of offenders who are more indiscriminate in victim choice and represent a more heterogeneous, but still a distinct offender category" and suggested further research to determine "specific variables that are unique to this group and can differentiate these offenders from pedophile and ephebophile offenders" so as to improve the identification and treatment of both offenders and victims.&lt;ref name="cartor"&gt;Cartor, Cimbolic &amp; Tallon (2008). Differentiating Pedophilia from Ephebophilia in Cleric Offenders. Sexual Addiction &amp; Compulsivity, Volume 15, Issue 4, pages 311 – 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

All victims in the John Jay report were [[Minor (law)|minors]]. Using a non-standard definition of "pre-pubescent", the Causes and Context Study of the John Jay College estimated that only a small percentage of offender priests were true pedophiles.&lt;ref name="JJReportCC"&gt;{{citation | author = John Jay College of Criminal Justice | year = 2011| title =  The Causes and Context of Sexual Abuse of Minors by Catholic Priests in the United States, 1950–2010 | publisher = United States Conference of Catholic Bishops | ISBN = 978-1-60137-201-7 | url = http://www.usccb.org/issues-and-action/child-and-youth-protection/upload/The-Causes-and-Context-of-Sexual-Abuse-of-Minors-by-Catholic-Priests-in-the-United-States-1950-2010.pdf | accessdate = 1 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study classified victims as pre-pubescent if they were age 10 or younger, whereas the age bracket specified in the current guidelines issued by the [[American Psychiatric Association]] is "generally age 13 or younger". A recent book estimates that if the latter definition were used instead of the former, the percentage of victims classified as prepubescent would have been 54% rather than the 18% figure cited by the Causes and Context report, and that a higher percentage of priests would therefore have been classified as pedophiles.&lt;ref name="Miles" /&gt; The same book also points out that with the pending new definition of "pedohebephilic disorder" in [[DSM-5]], an even higher percentage of victims would fall into a category consistent with their abusers having a recognized psychosexual disorder.

====Statement of Pope Francis====
In July 2014, [[Pope Francis]] was quoted as having said in an interview that about 8,000 Catholic clergy (2% of the total), including bishops and cardinals, were pedophiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=David Barrett|author2=Nick Squires|title=Pope Francis says about 8,000 pedophiles are members of Catholic clergy, including bishops and cardinals|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2014/07/13/pope-francis-says-about-8000-pedophiles-are-members-of-catholic-clergy-including-bishops-and-cardinals/|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=The Telegraph|date=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican indicated the interview had not been recorded nor notes taken during it and that quotes may have been misattributed in a deliberate attempt to manipulate readers. They stated that Pope Francis had not indicated that any cardinal abusers remained in their position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lachlan Williams |title=Pope says two percent of priests are pedophiles: report |url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/2014/07/14/10/25/pope-says-two-percent-of-priests-are-pedophiles-report |accessdate=14 July 2014 |work=ninemsn |date=14 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714201135/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/world/2014/07/14/10/25/pope-says-two-percent-of-priests-are-pedophiles-report |archivedate=14 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/world/pope-says-about-two-percent-of-priests-are-pedophiles-paper|title=Pope says about two percent of priests are pedophiles: paper|publisher=news.msn.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gay priests and homosexuality===
{{further|Debate on the causes of clerical child abuse#Gay priests and homosexuality}}
According to the John-Jay-Report, 80.9% of the abuse victims in the United States were male;&lt;ref name="usccb.org"/&gt; and a study by Dr. Thomas Plante found the number may be as high as 90%.&lt;ref&gt;Plante, Thomas. "A Perspective on Clergy Sexual Abuse". Online at: http://www.psywww.com/psyrelig/plante.html (Accessed 25 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; A number of books, such as "The Rite of Sodomy: Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church", have argued that homosexual priests view sex with minors as a "rite of passage" for altar boys and other pre-adult males.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Randy. "The Rite of Sodomy : Homosexuality and the Roman Catholic Church" (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Donohue|William Donohue]] of the Catholic League argued that the Church's [[pedophile]] problem was really a "homosexual crisis",&lt;ref name="BillDonohue"&gt;{{cite news | last = Donohue| first =William| title =Catholic Church's issue is homosexuality, not pedophilia | publisher =The Washington Post | year =2010| url =http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/guestvoices/2010/07/catholic_churchs_issue_is_homosexuality_not_pedophilia.html | accessdate =4 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which some have dismissed as unwarranted by arguing that there's a lack of correlation between a man identifying as homosexual and any particular likelihood he will abuse children.&lt;ref name="politicsdaily.com"/&gt; In the United States Father Cozzens quoted figures from 23 percent to 58 percent of homosexual priests, with a higher percentage among younger priests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Church and the Homosexual Priest|url = http://americamagazine.org/issue/387/article/church-and-homosexual-priest|website = America Magazine|access-date = 2016-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, research on pedophilia in general shows a majority of abusers identify themselves as heterosexual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Adult sexual orientation and attraction to underage persons|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|date=May 1978|volume=7|issue=3|pages=175–81|pmid=666571|author=Groth AN, Birnbaum HJ|quote=There were no examples of regression to child victims among peer-oriented, homosexual males.

===Clerical celibacy===
{{main|Clerical celibacy}}

Opinion seems divided on whether there is any definite link or connection between the Roman Catholic institution of celibacy and incidences of child abuse by Catholic clergy.

A 2005 article in the conservative Irish weekly the ''[[Western People]]'' proposed that [[clerical celibacy]] contributed to the abuse problem by suggesting that the institution of celibacy has created a "morally superior" status that is easily misapplied by abusive priests: "The Irish Church's prospect of a recovery is zero for as long as bishops continue blindly to toe the Vatican line of Pope Benedict XVI that a male celibate priesthood is morally superior to other sections of society."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2005/11/02/story27811.asp Western People, 2 Nov. 2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209081328/http://archives.tcm.ie/westernpeople/2005/11/02/story27811.asp |date= 9 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christoph Schönborn]] and [[Hans Küng]] have also said that priestly celibacy could be one of the causes of the sex abuse scandals within the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=schonborn&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/11/priestly-celibacy-catholic-sex-scandals|title=Archbishop links priestly celibacy and Catholic sex abuse scandals|author=Riazat Butt|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernie Allen, president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, said, "We don't see the Catholic Church as a hotbed of this or a place that has a bigger problem than anyone else. I can tell you without hesitation that we have seen cases in many religious settings, from traveling evangelists to mainstream ministers to rabbis and others."&lt;ref name=newsweek&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/236096|title=Priests Commit No More Abuse Than Other Males|publisher=newsweek.com|accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip Jenkins]], a long-time Catholic turned Episcopalian, asserts that his "research of cases over the past 20 years indicates no evidence whatever that Catholic or other celibate clergy are any more likely to be involved in misconduct or abuse than clergy of any other denomination—or indeed, than non-clergy. However determined news media may be to see this affair as a crisis of celibacy, the charge is just unsupported."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/forum/comm/20020303edjenk03p6.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | title=Forum: The myth of the 'pedophile priest' | first=Philip | last=Jenkins | date=3 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male culture of the church===
Italian academic [[Lucetta Scaraffia]] wrote in ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' that a greater presence of women in the Vatican could have prevented clerical sexual abuse from taking place.&lt;ref name=schonborn/&gt;

This view has been challenged and severely criticized by several scholars for denying the cases of nuns implicated in sexual abuse and pedophilia. In 1986, a history scholar from [[Stanford University]], recovered archival information about investigations from 1619 to 1623 involving nuns in Vellano, Italy, secretly exploiting illiterate nuns for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, M.L. (2007). Sexual Abuse and the Culture of Catholicism: How Priests and Nuns Become Perpetrators. (p.36) Publisher: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, a religious research national survey on revealed a very high number of nuns reporting childhood victimizations of sexual abuse by other nuns. It was further noted that the majority of nun-abuse victims are of the same sex.&lt;ref&gt;Chibnall, J.T., Wolf, A. &amp; Duckro, P.N. (1998). A National Survey of the Sexual Trauma Experiences of Catholic Nuns. Review of Religious Research Vol. 40, No. 2, pp. 142–167&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Markham examined the sexual histories of nuns to find several cases of nuns sexually abusing children.&lt;ref&gt;Markham, D. J. (2002). Some facts about women religious and child abuse. Covenant, September, 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Priest shortage===
It has been argued that a [[priest shortage in the Roman Catholic Church|shortage of priests]] caused the Roman Catholic hierarchy to act in such a way to preserve the number of clergy and ensure that sufficient numbers were available to serve their congregations despite serious allegations that some of these priests were unfit for duty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2004-06/a-2004-06-11-24-1.cfm Catholic Priests in India 'Outsourced' to Meet Clergy Shortage in West – 2004-06-11&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114133236/http://www.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-a-2004-06-11-24-1-66888707.html |date=14 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree and assert that the Church hierarchy's mishandling of the sex abuse cases merely reflected their prevailing attitude at the time towards any illegal or immoral activity by clergy. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

===Purported declining standards in prevailing culture===
In ''The Courage To Be Catholic: Crisis, Reform, and the Future of the Church'', author [[George Weigel]] claims that it was the infidelity to orthodox Roman Catholic teaching, the "culture of dissent" of priests, women religious, bishops, theologians, catechists, Church bureaucrats, and activists who "believed that what the Church proposed as true was actually false" was mainly responsible for the sexual abuse of parishioners' children by their priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/religion/re0568.html George Weigel on the Church Crisis in U.S] catholiceducation.org&lt;/ref&gt; Cardinal [[Theodore Edgar McCarrick]], retired [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington|Archbishop of Washington]], blamed the declining morals of the late 20th century as a cause of the high number of child molestations by priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wpherald.com/articles/4350/1/1960s-moral-decline-blamed-for-Catholic-sex-abuse-scandals/Retired-archbishop-of-Washington-cites-Woodstock.html Down For Maintenance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522165433/http://wpherald.com/articles/4350/1/1960s-moral-decline-blamed-for-Catholic-sex-abuse-scandals/Retired-archbishop-of-Washington-cites-Woodstock.html |date=22 May 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that a purported decline in general moral standards was associated with an increase in abuse by clergy was promoted by a study by [[John Jay College]] funded by the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]. The study claimed that the liberal 1960s caused the increase in abuse, and the conservative Reagan years led to its decline. The study was branded the 'Woodstock Defence' by critics who said that the study's own figures showed a surge in abuse reported from the 1950s, and the passage of time meant that reports of abuse from earlier decades were unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silk|first=Mark|title='Woodstock defense' of abuse doesn't hold water|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2011/may/25/woodstock-defence-abuse-catholic-church|accessdate=8 May 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=25 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
{{See also|Media coverage of Catholic sex abuse cases}}

Many popular culture representations have been made of the sex abuse of children cases. Some are first person like ''[[Sex crimes and the Vatican]]'' (2006) is a documentary film by [[Colm O'Gorman]], who was raped by a Catholic priest in the diocese of [[Ferns, County Wexford|Ferns]] in [[County Wexford]] in Ireland when he was 14 years old.

===Publications===
A number of books have been written about the abuse suffered from priests and nuns, including Andrew Madden's ''Altar Boy: A Story of Life After Abuse'', Carolyn Lehman's ''Strong at the Heart: How it Feels to Heal from Sexual Abuse'', Larry Kelly's ''The Pigeon House'' which deals with abuse in the [[Pigeon House TB Sanatorium]] at [[Ringsend]], and Kathy O'Beirne's bestseller ''Kathy's Story'' which details physical and sexual abuse suffered in a [[Magdalene laundry]] in Ireland. Writing in the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Ed West has asserted that Kathy Beirne's story is "largely invented" according to ''Kathy's Real Story'', a book by [[Hermann Kelly]], a [[Derry]] born journalist on the ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]'' and former editor of ''[[The Irish Catholic]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2008/03/05/ftmag105.xml "Mis lit: Is this the end for the misery memoir?", ''Daily Telegraph''] 5 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films and documentaries===
The [[Magdalene laundry|Magdalene laundries]] caught the public's attention in the late 1990s as claims of widespread abuse from some former inmates gathered momentum and were made the subject a controversial film called ''[[The Magdalene Sisters]]'' (2002). In 2006, a documentary called ''[[Deliver Us from Evil (2006 film)|Deliver Us From Evil]]'' was made about sexual abuse and primarily focused on one priest and his crimes; it also showed the lengths that some clergy would go to in order to cover up the many reports of sexual abuse.

==History==
Religious instruction was an important component of the curriculum of the first school in Melbourne, established in July 1840.  Over the next 80 years, forms of religious education for Victorian children were debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/stream/historyofstateed00victrich/historyofstateed00victrich_djvu.txt |title=A history of state education in Victoria |last1=Wilberforce |first1=Stephen |date= |work=[[Internet Archive]] |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The '''Joint Council for Religious Instruction in State Schools''' (the fore-runner of the Council for Christian Education in Schools) was established in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/15012092?q&amp;versionId=17671312 |title=Council for Christian Education in Schools (Vic.) |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |work=[[NLA Trove#Trove|NLA Trove]] |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Victorian education minister, [[Martin Dixon]], attended the launch of the training institute.&lt;ref name="SRI"/&gt;

===Special religious instruction===

Access Ministries is the largest provider of special religious instruction (SRI) in Victoria, and is authorised to provide it under the regulations of the Victorian Education Act. In 2011, SRI was provided to 130,100 Victorian school children in 940 schools, with the number dropping to 92,808 children in 666 schools by 2013. Access Ministries, however, claim that the figure of 666 is due to incorrect census reporting, and that in 2013, they actually provided SRI to 780 schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/access-ministries-asserts-its-right-to-teach-religion-in-schools-20140221-337r1.html |title=Access Ministries asserts its right to teach religion in schools |author=Marshall, Konrad |date=22 February 2014|work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=27 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall in attendance is largely attributed to department of education rules in August 2011, changing SRI classes from opt-out to [[wikt:opt-in|opt-in]] following complaints from parents and activist groups.&lt;ref name=drop&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/primary-school-principals-shut-down-religious-education-classes-20140216-32ty8.html|title=Primary school principals shut down religious education classes |last1=Marshall |first1=Konrad |date=February 17, 2014 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/education/religious-instruction-faces-massive-enrolments-drop-funding-uncertainty-20141220-12a1p0.html|title=Religious instruction faces massive enrolments drop, funding uncertainty|date=December 21, 2014|author=Konrad Marshall|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the complaints in September 2011, the [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]] declined to vote on a proposal to continue supporting Access Ministries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/church-to-probe-access-20110920-1kjlz.html |title=Church to probe Access |author=Zwartz, Barney |date=September 17, 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=21 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chaplaincy===
Access Ministries provides chaplains for the [[National school chaplaincy program|National School Chaplaincy Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessministries.org.au/chaplains |title=Why Chaplaincy? |publisher=Access Ministries |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessministries.org.au/chaplains/about-national-schools-chaplaincy-and-student-welf|title=About National Schools Chaplaincy and Student Welfare Program (NSCSWP)|publisher=Access Ministries |accessdate=March 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; All chaplains are required to have a bachelor's degree in theology or ministry, education, counselling or pastoral care, coupled with tertiary qualifications or experience in the other applicable areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessministries.org.au/chaplains/become-an-access-chaplain-2 |title=Become an ACCESS Chaplain or Student Wellbeing Worker |publisher=Access Ministries |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
David Hastie, director of Cambridge International Courses at [[Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney]], has said that while there has been a campaign against the services provided by Access Ministries, claims there has been a rise in enrolments in religious schools, along with strong support for SRI and school chaplaincy programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2014/03/31/3975454.htm|title=Big Secularism or the Australian Sprawl? Why Marion Maddox is Wrong about Christian Education|author=Hastie, David|publisher=ABC|date=31 March 2014|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in recent years there has been less support for SRI. In 2011 nine hundred and forty government schools offered SRI and by 2013 this had dropped to six hundred and sixty six schools. Which is a change of approximately thirty seven thousand students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/primary-school-principals-shut-down-religious-education-classes-20140216-32ty8.html|title=Primary school principals shut down religious education classes|author=Marshall, Konrad|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=17 February 2014|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In term three of 2014 after a new Ministerial Directive clarified SRI for parents a further fifty schools dropped SRI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/2014-08-31/5699360|title=Parents flee Access Ministries religion classes|author=Cohen, Hagar|publisher=ABC|date=31 August 2014|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tim Costello]], who taught religious education in a Victorian state school and supports faith-based religious education in public schools, has said in relation to Access Ministries, "if the vehicle is wrong, we can amend that rather than throwing the baby out with the bath water".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/bigideas/stories/2014/03/27/3972919.htm|title=IQ2 Debate: Faith-based Religious Education Has No Place in Public Schools|publisher=ABC, Big Ideas|date=27 March 2014|accessdate=2 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==

===Volunteer training===
Complaints have been made that Access Ministries provides inadequate training to its volunteers.  Volunteers pay Access Ministries $15 for six hours of training in order to qualify to teach SRI to children, compared to the three to four year degree required for teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/more-news/religious-education-instructors-in-schools-after-just-hours-of-training/story-fn7x8me2-1226061577933 |title=Religious education instructors in schools after just hours of training |author=O'Brien, Susie |date=May 24, 2011 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr [[Marion Maddox]], a member of the Uniting Church, professor at [[Macquarie University]] and expert on religious issues, has criticised Access Ministries volunteers for being under qualified.&lt;ref name=drop/&gt;

===Allegations of proselytising and bias===
Access Ministries have been accused of proselytising in public schools on several occasions, and for presenting Christian's beliefs as facts,&lt;ref name=drop/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/central/st-kilda-mum-shines-a-light-on-informed-consent-in-religion-debate/story-fngnvlpt-1226730825740 |title=St Kilda mum shines a light on informed consent in religion debate |last1=McCauley |first1=Dana |date=October 1, 2013 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher= |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are forbidden under government regulations. In May 2011, complaints were made after the CEO of Access Ministries stated that, "our federal and state governments allow us to take the Christian faith into our schools and share it. We need to go and make disciples".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/school-religion-classes-probed-20110512-1ekr9.html?from=age_sb |title=School religion classes probed |author=Topsfield, Jewel |date=May 13, 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access Ministries subsequently was questioned by [[Peter Garrett]], then Minister for Education. Access Ministries responded by stating that after inviting all principals to notify Access of any concerns, that no school principal indicated any concern with their Access Ministries chaplain acting inappropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://docs.education.gov.au/documents/access-ministries-report | title=ACCESS Ministries Report |date=  28 November 2011|publisher=Australian Government, Department of Education |accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr Garrett wrote to Access Ministries saying he was satisfied with their response and that he had asked his department to take no further action on this matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessministries.org.au/sitebuilder/support/knowledge/asset/files/21/petergarrettletterjuly2011.pdf |title=Dear Canon Paddison|first=Garrett |last=Peter |authorlink=Peter Garrett |date=July 20, 2011 |publisher=Access Ministries |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gary Bouma]], an Anglican priest and professor of sociology at [[Monash University]] has criticised Access Ministries' SRI curriculum for being biased, describing it as "just appalling". Dr [[Marion Maddox]] and former justice of the High Court of Australia [[Michael Kirby (judge)|Michael Kirby]] have also accused Access Ministries of presenting their beliefs in a biased manner.&lt;ref name=maddox&gt;{{cite journal |last=Maddox |first=Marion |date= |title=The Church, The State and the Classroom |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/UNSWLJ/2011/13.pdf |journal=UNSW Law Journal |publisher=[[University of New South Wales]] |volume=34 | issue = 1  |pages=315 |doi= |accessdate=26 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slam&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/priest-slams-religion-curriculum-as-appalling-20110402-1csld.html |title=Priest slams religion curriculum as 'appalling' |last1=Bachelard |first1=Michael |date=April 3, 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an Anglican chaplain accused Access Ministries of bias, the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, [[Philip Freier]], came to their defence, stating he believes that in the vast majority of cases Christian religious education teachers give their time to teach, not to proselytise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/chaplain-joins-religion-row-20110519-1ev07.html |title=Chaplain joins religion row |last1=Topsfield |first1=Jewel |date=May 20, 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |publisher= |accessdate=March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational content and activities===
There has been opposition to the content and activities provided by Access Ministries. They have been criticised for teaching children unscientific [[Creationism|creationist]] songs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/66677419/school-kids-taught-god-created-everything|title=School kids taught 'God created everything'|author=Jody O'Callaghan|date=26 Feb 2015|work=Stuff.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/christmas-season-hijacked-by-creationists/story-e6frf7kx-1226536402302 |title=Christmas season 'hijacked' by creationists |last1=O'Brien |first1=Susie |date=December 14, 2012 |work=[[Herald Sun]] |publisher= |accessdate=December 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing children with material claiming girls who wear revealing clothes are inviting sexual assault, that homosexuality, masturbation and sex before marriage are sinful,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/uproar-at-biblezine-sex-tips-for-kids-20140222-338zn.html|title=Uproar at 'Biblezine' sex tips for kids|date=February 22, 2014|author=Jill Stark|work=[[The Age]]|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=February 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that anyone having homosexual feelings should seek counselling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Access Ministries under scrutiny after 'inappropriate and offensive' material given out at Victorian primary school|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-23/biblezine-complaint-sparks-probe-into-religious-educator/5277766|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=5 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access Ministries were also criticized for a comic book which was said to imply that teachers were either too lazy or callous to help children unless God intervenes. Access removed the comic from their website after it was criticised by teachers, the Australian Childhood Foundation and Victorian education minister, Martin Dixon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/education/teacher-fury-over-god-comic-20110505-1ea5a.html |title=Teacher fury over God comic |author=Topsfield, Jewel |date=May 6, 2011 |work=[[The Age]] |accessdate=3 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Curse of Ham''' is the [[curse]] upon [[Canaan (Bible)|Canaan]], Ham's son, that was imposed by the biblical patriarch [[Noah]]. The curse occurs in the [[Book of Genesis]] and concerns Noah's drunkenness and the accompanying shameful act perpetrated by his son [[Ham (son of Noah)|Ham]], the father of Canaan ({{bibleverse||Gen.|9:20–27|HE}}).{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=76}} The controversies raised by this story regarding the nature of Ham's transgression, and the question of why Noah cursed Canaan when Ham had sinned, have been debated for over 2,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QFHB2D4XH8UC&amp;pg=PA157#v=snippet&amp;q=two%20thousand%20years&amp;f=false 157]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story's original purpose may have been to justify the subjection of the [[Canaan]]ite people to the [[Israelites]],&lt;ref name="Alter 2008 52–53"&gt;{{harvnb|Alter|2008|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in later centuries, the narrative was interpreted by some [[Christian]]s, [[Muslim]]s and [[Jews]] as an explanation for [[black skin]], as well as [[slavery]].{{sfn|Goldenberg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=QFHB2D4XH8UC&amp;pg=PA170#v=snippet&amp;q=curse%20%22black%20skin%22&amp;f=false 170]}} Nevertheless, most Christians, Muslims and Jews now disagree with such interpretation, because in the biblical text, Ham himself is not cursed, and race or skin color is never mentioned.{{sfnm|Whitford|2009|1p=35|2a1=Ham|2a2=Sarfati|2a3=Wieland|2y=2001}}

For a period of its history the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] used the curse of Ham [[Black people and priesthood (LDS)|to prevent black men from getting the priesthood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reeve|2015|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DC manual" /&gt;

==Origins==
===Genesis===
The concept of the Curse of Ham finds its origins in Genesis 9:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
20 And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:
21 And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was uncovered within his tent.
22 And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without.
23 And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw not their father's nakedness.
24 And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son had done unto him.
25 And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren.
26 And he said, Blessed be the Lord God of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
27 God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.
:– {{bibleref2|Genesis|9:20–27|KJV}}, ''King James Version''&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The objective of the story may have been to justify the subject status of the Canaanites, the descendants of Ham, to the Israelites, the descendants of Shem.&lt;ref name="Alter 2008 52–53"/&gt; The narrative of the curse  is replete with difficulties:{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=77}} It is uncertain what the precise nature of Ham's offense is.{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=77}} Verse 22 has been a subject of debate,{{sfn|Sadler|2005|pp=26–27}} as to whether it should be taken literally, or as "a euphemism for some act of gross immorality".{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=77}} In verse 25, Noah names Shem and Japheth as the "brethren" (the [[New Living Translation]] reads "relatives") of Canaan, seven verses after indicating that they were Canaan's uncles. The [[Table of Nations]] presents Canaan and [[Mizraim]] (Egypt) among the sons of Ham (10:6). In the Psalms, Egypt is equated with Ham.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarna|1981|p=77}}: Ps.78:51; 105:23,27; 106:22.&lt;/ref&gt; The treatment of Japheth in verses 26–27 raises questions: Why is YHWH named as the God of Shem, but not of Japheth? What does it mean that God will "enlarge" Japheth? And why will Japheth "dwell in the tents of Shem"?&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brett|2000|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further difficulties include Ham's being referred to as "the youngest son", when all other lists make him Noah's second son.{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=77}} Per Sarna, the biggest challenge of the narrative is why Canaan was cursed, rather than Ham,{{sfn|Sarna|1981|p=77}} and the concealed details of the shameful incident bear the same reticence of [[Reuben (Bible)|Reuben]]'s sexual transgression.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarna|1981|p=77}}:Gen.35:22&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative's short five verses indicate that Canaan's Hamite paternity must have had great significance to the narrator or redactor, according to Sarna, who adds, "The curse on Canaan, invoked in response to an act of moral depravity, is the first intimation of the theme of the corruption of the Canaanites, which is given as the justification for their being dispossessed of their land and for the transfer of that land to the descendants of [[Abraham]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sarna|1981|pp=77, 78}}: Lev.20:23f&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ham's transgression==
===Seeing nakedness===
[[File:Ham Mocking Noah.jpg|thumb|right|275px|''[[Ham Mocking Noah]]'', a painting by [[Bernardino Luini]]]]
The majority of commentators, both ancient and modern, have felt that Ham's seeing his father naked was not a sufficiently serious crime to explain the punishment that follows.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg 2005 259–260"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|2005|pp=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Genesis 9:23, in which Shem and Japheth cover Noah with a cloak while averting their eyes, suggests that the words are to be taken literally,&lt;ref name="Levenson 2004 26"&gt;{{harvnb|Levenson|2004|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has recently been pointed out that, in 1st millennium Babylonia, looking at another person's genitals was indeed regarded as a serious matter.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg 2005 259–260"/&gt;

Other ancient commentators suggested that Ham was guilty of more than what the Bible says. The ''[[Targum Onqelos]]'' has Ham gossiping about his father's drunken disgrace "in the street" (a reading which has a basis in the original Hebrew), so that being held up to public mockery was what had angered Noah; as the ''[[Cave of Treasures]]'' (4th century) puts it, "Ham laughed at his father's shame and did not cover it, but laughed about it and mocked."&lt;ref name="Kugle 1998 222"/&gt;

Ancient commentaries have also debated whether "seeing" someone's nakedness meant to have sex with that person (e.g. Leviticus 20:17).&lt;ref name="Levenson 2004 26"/&gt; The same idea was raised by 3rd-century rabbis, in the ''[[Babylonian Talmud]]'' (c. 500 AD), who argue that Ham either castrated his father, or [[sodomy|sodomised]] him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|2005|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same explanations are found in three Greek translations of the Bible, which replace the word "see" in verse 22 with another word denoting homosexual relations.&lt;ref name="Kugle 1998 222"&gt;{{harvnb|Kugle|1998|p=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; The castration theory has its modern counterpart in suggested parallels found in the castration of [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]] by [[Cronus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Robertson|1910|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Greek mythology]] and a [[Hittites|Hittite]] myth of the supreme god [[Anu]] whose genitals were "bitten off by his rebel son and cup-bearer [[Kumarbi]], who afterwards rejoiced and laughed ... until Anu cursed him".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graves|Patai|1964|p=Ch.21, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book of Jubilees===
In the [[Book of Jubilees]], the seriousness of Ham's curse is compounded by the significance of God's covenant to "never again bring a flood on the earth".&lt;ref name = "Bergren, 2002, 137"&gt;{{harvnb|Dimant|2001|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this covenant, Noah builds a sacrificial altar "to atone for the land".&lt;sup&gt;[Jub. 6:1–3]&lt;/sup&gt; Noah’s practice and ceremonial functions parallel the festival of [[Shavuot]] as if it were a prototype to the celebration of the giving of the [[Torah]].&lt;ref name = "Bergren, 2002, 137"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philo, ''Abr.'' 34&lt;/ref&gt; His "priestly" functions also emulate being "first priest" in accordance with [[halakhah]] as taught in the [[Qumran]]ic works.&lt;ref&gt;Albeck. ''Buch der Jubiäen'',p. 21, 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|VanderKam|1980|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; By turning the drinking of the wine into a religious ceremony, ''Jubilees'' alleviates any misgivings that may be provoked by the episode of Noah's drunkenness. Thus, Ham's offense would constitute an act of disrespect not only to his father, but also to the festival ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dimant|2001|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Judaism===
The medieval commentary of [[Rashi]] (Rabbi Shlomo Yitzchaki 1040–1105), who cites older sources from Judaism's [[Oral Torah]], which is relied upon by traditional Judaic scholarship as the most basic commentary to the present time, provides an introductory explanation. ({{bibleverse||Genesis|9:22–27)|HE}}:

* {{bibleverse||Genesis|9:22|HE}}: ''and Ham, the father of Canaan, saw'': "There are those among our rabbis who say that Canaan saw and told his father [Ham] and this is why Canaan was mentioned with regard to the matter and was cursed."

''And [Ham] saw his father's nakedness.'': "There are those of our rabbis who say he [[Emasculation|emasculated]] (סרסו [[Castration|castrated]]) him, and there are those who say he had ([[Homosexuality|homosexual]] רבעו) relations with him." [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]] 70a.

==Curse of Canaan==
*Genesis 9:25: "And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren"
It is noteworthy that the curse was made by Noah, not by God. Some biblical scholars claim that when a curse is made by a man, it could only have been effective if God supports it, unlike the curse of Ham and his descendants, which was not confirmed by God&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Wiggins (2005). ''The Curse of Ham: Satan's Vicious Cycle''. pages 41, 42; 48.&lt;/ref&gt; or, at least, it is not mentioned in the Bible that he had confirmed it.

===Dead Sea Scrolls===
[[4Q252]], a ''pesher'' (interpretation) on the Book of Genesis found among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], explains that since Ham had already been blessed by God (Genesis 9:1), he could not now be cursed by Noah.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|2005|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4Q252 scroll probably dates from the latter half of the first century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Trost|2010|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; A century later, the Jewish historian [[Josephus]] argued that Noah refrained from cursing Ham because of his nearness of kin, and so cursed Ham's son instead.&lt;ref name="Kugle 1998 223"&gt;{{harvnb|Kugle|1998|p=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new alternative interpretation of 4Q181, which is a Dead Sea scroll of Genesis, parallels the Book of Jubilees, suggesting that Canaan was cursed because he defied Noah’s division of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/.premium-1.527210 | title = Scholars owe new Dead Sea Scrolls reading to Google | date = 2013-02-13 | accessdate = 2013-12-27 | publisher = haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.biblicalarchaeology.org/daily/news/the-curse-of-hama-new-reading-in-the-dead-sea-scrolls/ | title = The Curse of Ham—A New Reading in the Dead Sea Scrolls | date = 2013-06-07 | accessdate = 2013-12-27 | publisher = biblicalarchaeology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jubilees===
The [[Book of Jubilees]] also recounts the incident between Ham and Noah, and Noah's resulting curse against Canaan, in similar terms. Later, however, ''Jubilees'' explains further that Noah had allocated Canaan a land west of the Nile along with his brothers, but that he violated this agreement and instead chose to squat in the land delineated to [[Shem]] (and later [[Abraham]]), and so rightly deserved the curse of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Seters|2000|pp=491–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classical Judaism===
[[Philo of Alexandria]], a 1st-century BC Jewish philosopher, said that Ham and Canaan were equally guilty, if not of whatever had been done to Noah, then of other crimes, "for the two of them together had acted foolishly and wrongly and committed other [[sin]]s." Rabbi Eleazar decided that Canaan had in fact been the first to see Noah, and had then gone and told his father, who then told his brothers in the street; this, said Eleazar, "did not take to mind the commandment to honour one's father." Another interpretation was that Noah's "youngest son" could not be Ham, who was the middle son: "for this reason they say that this youngest son was in fact Canaan."&lt;ref name="Kugle 1998 223"/&gt;

{{bibleverse||Genesis|9:25|HE}}: ''Cursed (ארור) is Canaan: Noah said to Ham'': "You caused me that I should not father a fourth son, another one to serve me. May your fourth son [Canaan was Ham's fourth son, see {{bibleverse||Genesis|10:6|HE}}] be cursed by serving the offspring of these greater ones [of Shem and Japheth]... What did Ham see that he emasculated him? He said to his brothers [[Adam]] the first man had only two sons ([[Cain and Abel]]) yet one killed the other because of the inheritance of the world [Cain killed Abel over a dispute how to divide the world between them according to [[Genesis Rabbah]] 22:7] and our father has three sons yet he seeks still a fourth son."&lt;ref name="The Torah: With Rashi's Commentary Translated, Annotated, and Elucidated 1996 96–99"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pentateuch with Targum Onkelos, Haphtaroth and Rashi's Commentary 1935 40–41"/&gt;

== Misconception, Racism and Slavery ==
In the past, some people have claimed the "curse of Ham" as a biblical justification for imposing slavery or racism on black people,&lt;!--Goldenberg--&gt; although this concept is essentially an ideologically driven&lt;!--Lulat--&gt; misconception.{{sfnm|Goldenberg|2009|1p=168|Lulat|2005|2p=85, 86|Metcalf|2005|3p=[https://books.google.com/books?&amp;id=lWuNIISvBqIC#v=snippet&amp;q=ham%20curse&amp;f=false 164]}} Regarding this matter, the Christian leader [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] called such attempt "a blasphemy" that "is against everything that the Christian religion stands for."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/doc_pauls_letter_to_american_christians/ Paul’s Letter to American Christians]", Delivered at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church, Montgomery, Alabama, on 4 November 1956. "I understand that there are Christians among you who try to justify segregation on the basis of the Bible. They argue that the Negro is inferior by nature because of Noah's curse upon the children of Ham. Oh my friends, this is [[blasphemy]]. This is against everything that the Christian religion stands for. I must say to you as I have said to so many Christians before, that in Christ "there is neither Jew nor Gentile, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female, for we are all one in Christ Jesus."&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, elite intellectuals were "successful" in establishing the Hamitic misconception as a valid justification for slavery and racism within a wide sphere of public thought. For Southern slave owners faced with the abolitionist movement to end slavery, the Curse of Ham was among the only grounds upon which Christian slave owners could formulate an ideological defense of slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Stephen|date=2003-10|title=Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=3-19|doi=10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|issn=1937-5239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even before slavery, in order to promote economic motivations within Europe associated with colonialism, the Curse of Ham was used to shift the common Aristotelian belief that phenotypic differentiation among humans was a result of climatic difference, to a racialist perspective that phenotypic differentiation among the species was due to there being different racial types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400873678|title=Racism: A Short History|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|date=2015-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781400873678|location=Princeton|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; This latter effort started in England.  Englishmen were widely afraid to further the colonial efforts of The Crown and begin a new life in lower latitude colonies for fear of becoming black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=112-118|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1578, George Best, a sea captain who was a member of the Elizabethan court,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=105|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; first popularized the myth of racial differences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400873678|title=Racism: A Short History|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|date=2015-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=|isbn=9781400873678|location=Princeton|pages=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; within what would be a widely read book on the search for a Northwest passage to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=105|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Best uses careful ethnographic descriptions to portray the indigenous peoples of the North West as being sophisticated hunters and gatherers, not different in spirit than the white Englishmen,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=109|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the same time he presents a scathing account of Africans, saying of them that they are a "black and loathsome" people on account of being descendants of the “cursed chus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=109|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;". Interestingly, Best doesn’t mention the curse as lying upon Ham, but rather Chus.  The fact is is that there is no indication in Genesis proper to justify racism and slavery, but the vagueness of Genesis 9-11 coupled with a damning curse from an important biblical patriarch could be used as propaganda to influence popular belief by cunning intellectuals trying to further particular agendas. The historian David Whiteford writes of a “curse matrix” being derived from the vagueness of genesis 9 such that it didn’t matter who was cursed or what people they were suppose to have been the originators of, all that mattered was that there was a vague reference to a generational curse that could be exploited any which way by agenda-driven intellectuals like George Best.

Pro-slavery intellectuals were hard pressed to find any justification for slavery and racism within Christian theology which taught that all humans were descendants of Adam and therefore one race, possessed of equal salvation potential and deserving of being treated as kin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400873678|title=Racism: A Short History|last=Fredrickson|first=George M.|date=2015-01-31|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2015|isbn=9781400873678|location=Princeton|pages=17-47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curse of Ham was used to drive a wedge in the mythology of a single human race, as elite intellectuals were able to convince people that the three sons of Noah represented the three sects of Man and their respective hierarchy of different fates. Leading intellectuals in the south, like Benjamin M. Palmer, claimed that White Europeans were decedent from Japhet who was prophesied by Noah to cultivate civilization and the powers of the intellect, while Africans, being descendants of the cursed Ham, were destined to be possessed by a slavish nature ruled by base appetites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Stephen|date=2002|title=Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=129|doi=10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|issn=1937-5239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Curse of Ham, as construed by agenda driven, pro-slavery intellectuals like Palmer, gave a biblical depth to the justification of slavery that couldn't be found anywhere else within the Christian Framework. Palmer cited the Germanic philosophical position put forth by thinkers like Friedrich Von Schlegel, that there are different "historic peoples," with different roles to play in the unfolding of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Stephen|date=2002|title=Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=129|doi=10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|issn=1937-5239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These philosophies gave the common pro-slaver their only sense of profound justification for their behavior. As Palmer liked to preach, the southern slave owners were just continuing the pattern set forth by the great biblical patriarch Noah. Palmer taught that slave owners should appraise their own actions for that they were planters of the land as was Noah, and that the enslavement of the Africans was making good upon the great patriarch’s righteous curse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haynes|first=Stephen|date=2003-10|title=Noah's Curse: The Biblical Justification of American Slavery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=|pages=125-174|doi=10.1086/ahr/108.4.1150|issn=1937-5239|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-Slavers could make connections between the ancient rabbinical tradition that interpreted the mysterious wrong doings of Ham as being sexually deviant in nature with their own racialized, hyper-sexualized conception of Africans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Whitford|first=David M.|date=2017-07-05|title=The Curse of Ham in the Early Modern Era|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781315240367|journal=|volume=|pages=122-139|doi=10.4324/9781315240367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus southern slave owners could convince themselves of a perverse natural order that set them at the top. The Curse of Ham itself gives no any grounds for such gross misuse, and misinterpretation, as the majority of Christian Theologians have always argued, yet agenda-driven intellectuals found ways to exploit the vagueness and mystery of Genesis 9-11 to further their own ends.

===Early Judaism and Islam===
[[File:Noah-Curses-Ham.jpg|thumb|right|Noah curses Ham by [[Gustave Dore]]]]
While Genesis 9 never says that Ham was black, he became associated with black skin, through [[folk etymology]] deriving his name from a similar, but actually unconnected, word meaning "dark" or "brown".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|1997|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next stage are certain fables according to ancient Jewish traditions. According to one legend preserved in the Babylonian [[Talmud]], God cursed Ham because he broke a prohibition on sex aboard [[Noah's ark|the ark]] and "was smitten in his skin";&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Sanhedrin 108b&lt;/ref&gt; according to another, Noah cursed him because he castrated his father.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|1997|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Talmud refers only to Ham, the version brought in a [[midrash]] goes on further to say "Ham, that [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] came from him" in reference to the blackness,&lt;ref&gt;Yalkut Shim'oni. Noah Sec. 58&lt;/ref&gt; that the curse did not apply to all of Ham but only to his eldest son Cush, [[Kingdom of Kush|Cush]] being a sub-Saharan African.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce, Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, two distinct traditions existed, one explaining dark skin as the result of a curse on Ham, the other explaining slavery by the separate curse on Canaan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|1997|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concepts were introduced into Islam during the Arab expansion of the 7th century, due to cross-pollination of Jewish and Christian parables and theology into Islam, called "[[Isra'iliyyat]]".&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 4| pages = 211–212| last = Vagda| first = G.| title = Isrāʾīliyyāt| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]]| year = 1973|ISBN=9004057455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some medieval Muslim writers—including [[Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], and even the later ''Book of the Zanj''—asserted the view that the effects of Noah's curse on Ham's descendants included blackness, slavery, and a requirement not to let the hair grow past the ears,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|1997|pp=33–[https://books.google.com/books?id=C2MJkRjpOHoC&amp;pg=PA34#v=onepage&amp;q=%22long+history+of+enslaving%22&amp;f=false 34]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldenberg|2003|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1MS9AiZ74MoC&amp;lpg=PA397&amp;vq=curse%20black%20skin&amp;pg=PA170#v=snippet&amp;q=curse%20black%20skin&amp;f=false 170]}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that this contradicted the teachings of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]] regarding skin color and racial equality, most notably in his [[Farewell Sermon|last sermon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://library.islamweb.net/newlibrary/display_book.php?idfrom=22393&amp;idto=22393&amp;bk_no=6&amp;ID=1079|title=Musnad Ahmad}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also in spite of the fact that the account of the drunkenness of Noah and curse of Ham are not present within the text of the [[Qur'an]], the Islamic holy book,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|11|25–49|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not consistent with Islamic teachings that Noah is a prophet, and prophets do not drink alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Diane |authorlink= |title=Essential Islam: A Comprehensive Guide to Belief and Practice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U94S6N2zECAC&amp;pg=PA40#v=onepage&amp;q=Quran%20%22Noah's%20drunkenness%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=30 November 2013 |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location= |isbn=978-0313360251 |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam holds prophets of God in very high esteem, and some Muslims suggest the prophets are infallible.&lt;ref name="Shaatri, A. I. 2007"&gt;Shaatri, A. I. (2007). Nayl al Rajaa' bisharh' Safinat an'najaa'. Dar Al Minhaj.&lt;/ref&gt;

An independent interpretation of the curse being imposed on all of the descendants of Ham persisted in Judaism, especially since the other children of Ham were situated in the African continent; i.e., [[Mizraim]] fathered the Egyptians, [[Cush (Bible)|Cush]] the [[Kingdom of Kush|Cushites]], and [[Phut]] the Libyans.&lt;ref&gt;William M. Evans, "From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the 'Sons of Ham{{'"}}. ''American Historical Review'' 85 (February 1980), 15–43 .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval serfdom and "Pseudo-Berossus"===
In medieval Christian exegesis, Ham's sin was regarded as laughter (for mocking his father and doing nothing to rectify his condition).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|1999|p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in Medieval Europe, the "Curse of Ham" also became used as a justification for [[serfdom]]. [[Honorius Augustodunensis]] (c. 1100) was the first recorded to propose a [[caste system]] associating Ham with serfdom, writing that serfs were descended from Ham, nobles from Japheth, and free men from Shem. However, he also followed the interpretation of 1 Corinthians 7:21 by [[Ambrosiaster]] (late 4th century), which held that as servants in the temporal world, these "Hamites" were likely to receive a far greater reward in the next world than would the Japhetic nobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitford|2009|pp=31–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Freedman|1999|p=291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that serfs were the descendants of Ham soon became widely promoted in Europe. An example is Dame [[Juliana Berners]] (c. 1388), who, in a treatise on hawks, claimed that the "[[churl]]ish" descendants of Ham had settled in Europe, those of the temperate Shem in Africa, and those of the noble Japheth in Asia (a departure from normal arrangements, which placed Shem in Asia, Japheth in Europe, and Ham in Africa), because she considered Europe to be the "country of churls", Asia of gentility, and Africa of temperance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitford|2009|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; As serfdom waned in the late medieval era, the interpretation of serfs being descendants of Ham decreased as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Whitford|2009|p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ham also figured in an immensely influential work ''Commentaria super opera diversorum auctorum de antiquitatibus'' (''Commentaries on the Works of Various Authors Discussing Antiquity''). In 1498, [[Annius of Viterbo]] claimed to have translated records of [[Berossus]], an ancient Babylonian priest and scholar; which are today usually considered an elaborate forgery. However, they gained great influence over Renaissance ways of thinking about population and migration, filling a historical gap following the biblical account of the flood.&lt;ref&gt;Morse, Michael A. ''How the Celts Came to Britain''. Tempus Publishing, Stroud, 2005. page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this account, Ham studied the evil arts that had been practiced before the flood, and thus became known as "Cam Esenus" (Ham the Licentious), as well as the original [[Zoroaster]] and Saturn ([[Cronus]]). He became jealous of Noah's additional children born after the deluge, and began to view his father with enmity, and one day, when Noah lay drunk and naked in his tent, Ham saw him and sang a mocking incantation that rendered Noah temporarily sterile, as if castrated. This account contains several other parallels connecting Ham with Greek myths of the castration of Uranus by Cronus, as well as Italian legends of Saturn and/or Camesis ruling over the Golden Age and fighting the [[Titanomachy]]. Ham in this version also abandoned his [[Wives aboard Noah's Ark|wife who had been aboard the ark]] and had mothered the African peoples, and instead married his sister Rhea, daughter of Noah, producing a race of giants in Sicily.

===European/American slavery, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries===
The explanation that black Africans, as the "sons of Ham", were cursed, possibly "blackened" by their sins, was advanced only sporadically during the Middle Ages, but it became increasingly common during the [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Braude, "The Sons of Noah and the Construction of Ethnic and Geographical Identities in the Medieval and Early Modern Periods, "William and Mary Quarterly LIV (January 1997): 103–142. See also [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1853423 William McKee Evans], "From the Land of Canaan to the Land of Guinea: The Strange Odyssey of the Sons of Ham,"American Historical Review 85 (February 1980): 15–43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Swift Superstition"&gt;John N. Swift and Gigen Mammoser, "'Out of the Realm of Superstition: Chesnutt's 'Dave's Neckliss' and the Curse of Ham'", ''American Literary Realism'', vol. 42 no. 1, Fall 2009, 3&lt;/ref&gt; The justification of slavery itself through the sins of Ham was well suited to the ideological interests of the elite; with the emergence of the slave trade, its [[Racialization|racialized]] version justified the exploitation of African labour.

The painting depicts a black grandmother, mulatta mother, white father and their [[quadroon]] child, hence three generations of racial [[hypergamy]] though [[Blanqueamiento|whitening]].]]
In the parts of Africa where Christianity flourished in the early days, while it was still illegal in Rome, this idea never took hold, and its interpretation of scripture was never adopted by the African [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]es. A modern [[Amharic]] commentary on Genesis notes the nineteenth century and earlier European theory that blacks were subject to whites as a result of the "curse of Ham", but calls this a false teaching unsupported by the text of the Bible, emphatically pointing out that Noah's curse fell not upon all descendants of Ham, but only on the descendants of Canaan, and asserting that it was fulfilled when Canaan was occupied by both Semites (Israel) and [[Japhetite]]s. The commentary further notes that Canaanites ceased to exist politically after the [[Third Punic War]] (149 BC), and that their current descendants are thus unknown and scattered among all peoples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://good-amharic-books.com/images/PDFs/Gentee_04.pdf Amharic ''Commentary on Genesis'' pp. 133–142.

[[Robert Boyle]]—a seventeenth-century scientist who also was a [[theologian]] and a devout Christian—refuted the idea that blackness was a Curse of Ham, in his book ''Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours'' (1664).&lt;ref&gt;David Mark Whitford (2009), "The curse of Ham in the early modern era", pages 174–175;  Nina G. Jablonski (2012), "Living Color: The Biological and Social Meaning of Skin Color", page 219&lt;/ref&gt; There, Boyle explains that the Curse of Ham used as an explanation of the [[complexion]] of coloured people was but a misinterpretation embraced by "vulgar writers", travelers, critics, and also "men of note" of his time.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Boyle (1664), "[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/14504/14504-h/14504-h.htm#Page_160 Experiments and Considerations Touching Colours]", Henry Herringman, London, page 160&lt;/ref&gt; In his work, he challenges that vision, explaining:

{{Quote|And not only we do not find expressed in the Scripture, that the Curse meant by ''Noah'' to ''Cham'', was the Blackness of his Posterity, but we do find plainly enough there that the Curse was quite another thing, namely that he should be a Servant of Servants, that is by an Ebraism, a very Abject Servant to his Brethren, which accordingly did in part come to pass, when the ''Israelites'' of the posterity of ''Sem'', subdued the ''Canaanites'', that descended from ''Cham'', and kept them in great Subjection. Nor is it evident that Blackness is a Curse, for Navigators tell us of Black Nations, who think so much otherwise of their own condition, that they paint the Devil White. Nor is Blackness inconsistent with Beauty, which even to our European Eyes consists not so much in Colour, as an Advantageous Stature, a Comely Symmetry of the parts of the Body, and Good Features in the Face. So that I see not why Blackness should be thought such a Curse to the ''Negroes''... [author's italics and capitalization]}}

A number of other scholars also support the claim that the racialized version of the Curse of Ham was devised at that time because it suited ideological and economical interests of the European elite and [[slave trade]]rs who wanted to justify exploitation of African labour.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Robinson (2007), "Racism: a History", (BBC Documentary)&lt;/ref&gt;  While Robinson (2007) claims that such version was non-existent before, historian [[David Brion Davis]] argues, as well, that contrary to the claims of many reputable historians, neither the [[Talmud]] nor any early post-biblical [[Jewish]] writing relates blackness of the skin to a curse whatsoever.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Brion Davis]] Sterling Professor of History [[Yale University]] (Emeritus), "[[Inhuman Bondage: The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World]]", Oxford University Press, Apr 1, 2006, pages 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1835, [[Joseph Smith]], the founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], produced a work called the [[Book of Abraham]].  It explicitly denotes that an Egyptian king by the name of [[Pharaoh (Book of Abraham)|Pharaoh]] was a descendant of Ham and the Canaanites,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; who were black,({{lds|Moses|moses|7|8}}) that Noah had cursed his lineage so they did not have the right to the priesthood,&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that all Egyptians descended from him.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Pearl of Great Price|book=Abraham|chapter=1|verse=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later considered scripture by the LDS Church.  This passage is the only one found in any Mormon scripture that bars a particular lineage of people from holding the priesthood, and, while nothing in the Book of Abraham explicitly denotes Noah's curse was the same curse mentioned in the Bible or that the Egyptians were related to other black Africans,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mauss|2003|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; it later became the foundation of church policy in regards to the priesthood ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reeve|2015|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2002 ''Doctrine and Covenants Student Manual'' points to Abraham 1:21–27 as the reasoning behind the not giving black people the priesthood until 1978.&lt;ref name="DC manual"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/doctrine-and-covenants-student-manual/official-declaration-2-every-faithful-worthy-man?lang=eng|title=Official Declaration 2, ‘Every Faithful, Worthy Man’|year=2002|publisher=LDS Church|pages=634–365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following year, Smith taught that the Curse of Ham came from God, and that blacks were cursed with servitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bringhurst|254|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He warned those who tried to interfere with slavery that God could do his own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite wikisource | title = Latter Day Saints' Messenger and Advocate/Volume 2/Number 7/Letter to Oliver Cowdery from Joseph Smith, Jr. (Apr. 1836) | last  = Smith | first = Joseph | year  = 1836 | pages = 290 | quote = As the fact is uncontrovertable, that the first mention we have of slavery is found in the holy bible...

In 1978, LDS Church president [[Spencer W. Kimball]] said he received [[1978 Revelation on Priesthood|a revelation]] that extended the priesthood to all worthy male members of the church without regard to race or color.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |contribution= Official Declaration 2 |contribution-url= http://scriptures.lds.org/od/2 |title= [[Doctrine and Covenants]] |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2013, The LDS church denounced the curse of Ham explanation for withholding the priesthood from black Africans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood "Race and the Priesthood"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the essays have not been well publicized,&lt;ref name=stack&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/lifestyle/faith/2475803-155/mormon-bishop-dismisses-teacher-for-using|title=This Mormon Sunday school teacher was dismissed for using church's own race essay in lesson|author=Peggy Fletcher Stack|date=May 10, 2015|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many members remain unaware of the essays and hold to racist beliefs that had been taught in the past.&lt;ref name=Stack2017&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sltrib.com/home/5371962-155/39-years-later-priesthood-ban-is|title=39 years later, priesthood ban is history, but racism within Mormon ranks isn’t, black members say|author=Peggy Fletcher Stack|date=June 9, 2017|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|quote=But [the essay] was published online, rather than read over the pulpit, which means many members still know little about it.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Book of Abraham is still considered scripture in the LDS church.  The Old Testament student manual, which is published by the Church and is the manual currently used to teach the Old Testament in LDS Institutes, teaches that Canaan could not hold the priesthood because of his ancestral lineage but mentions nothing of race or skin color:{{blockquote|Therefore, although Ham himself had the right to the priesthood, Canaan, his son, did not. Ham had married Egyptus, a descendant of Cain ([http://scriptures.lds.org/en/abr/1/21-24#21-24 Abraham 1:21–24]), and so his sons were denied the priesthood.&lt;ref name="OT manual"&gt;{{cite book|title=Old Testament Student Manual Genesis-2 Samuel|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/old-testament-student-manual-genesis-2-samuel/genesis-4-11-the-patriarchs?lang=eng&amp;clang=pes&amp;_r=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Daji was from a noble family called Su (蘇) from the state of [[Yousu]] (有蘇). Hence, she is also known as '''Su Daji'''. In 1047 BC, [[King Zhou of Shang]] invaded Yousu and took Daji as his prize. In ''[[Feng Shen Yan Yi]]'', she was a daughter of [[Su Hu]] (蘇護);&lt;ref name="FSYYSuHu"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Xu | first1 = Zhong Lin| authorlink1 = Xu Zhonglin (writer) | title = [[Fengshen Yanyi]] | year = 1600s }}[[:zh:s:封神演義/卷003|Chapter 3]] wrote: "[After Su Hu's eldest son were captured...] Su Hu looks anxious, carrying his [Su Hu's] sword into the back hall, seeing the young miss Daji, who is wearing a graceful smile with her slightly spit lips, asking 'Father, why are you carrying your sword [in your own home]?'

Translated from original text: 蘇護帶十分煩惱，仗劍走進後廳，只見小姐妲己，盈盈笑臉，微吐朱唇，口稱：「爹爹，為何提劍進來？」蘇護一見妲己，乃親生之女，又非讎敵，此劍焉能舉的起。&lt;/ref&gt; in the early chapters, she was killed by a thousand-year-old [[huli jing|vixen spirit]] who [[possessed by spirits|possessed]] her body before becoming a [[concubinage|concubine]] of King Zhou.&lt;ref name="FSYYDeath"&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Xu | first1 = Zhong Lin| authorlink1 = Xu Zhonglin (writer) | title = [[Fengshen Yanyi]] | year = 1600s}} [[:zh:s:封神演義/卷004|Chapter 4]] wrote: "——Without knowing that an answer not from Daji but the Thousand-year-old Vixen. When the lamps are off, so are the lights in the front hall and the back, it's time the Vixen sucks all of Daji's soul out of her body, then she [Daji] is dead; She [the vixen] possesses her [Daji's] body, ready to seduce King Zhou and ruin his beautiful country". Translated from the original text: ──不知這個回話的乃是千年狐狸，不是妲己。方纔滅燈之時，再出廳前取得燈火來，這是多少時候了，妲己魂魄已被狐狸吸去，死之久矣；乃借體成形，迷惑紂王，斷送他錦繡江山。&lt;/ref&gt;

King Zhou became extremely infatuated with Daji and started to neglect state affairs in order to keep her company. He used any means necessary to ingratiate himself with her and to please her. Daji liked animals so he built her a zoological [[Shangdu#In popular culture|Xanadu]] with several rare species of birds and animals. He also ordered artists to compose lewd music and choreograph bawdy dances to satisfy her musical taste. He gathered 3000 guests at one party to indulge in his "pond of alcohol" and "forest of meat". He allowed the guests to play a [[cat and mouse]] game nude in the forest to amuse Daji. When one of King Zhou's concubines, the daughter of Lord Jiu, protested, King Zhou had her executed. Her father was ground in pieces and his flesh fed to King Zhou's vassals.

Daji's greatest joy was to hear people cry in physical torment. Once, she saw a farmer walking barefoot on ice and ordered his feet cut off so she could study them and figure out why they were so resistant to low temperatures. On another occasion, she had a pregnant woman's belly cut open so it satisfied her curiosity to find out what happened inside. To verify an ancient saying that "a good man's heart has seven apertures", she even had the heart of the minister [[Bi Gan]] (King Zhou's uncle) dug out and subjected to her scrutiny.

Daji was best known for her invention of a method of torture known as [[Creations of Daji#The Bronze Toaster|''Paolao'' (炮烙)]]. A bronze cylinder covered with oil was heated like a furnace with charcoal beneath until its sides became extremely hot. The victim was made to walk on top of the slowly heating cylinder and he was forced to shift his feet to avoid the burning. The oily surface made it difficult for the victim to maintain his position and balance. If the victim fell into the charcoal below, he would be burnt to death. The victim was forced to dance and scream in agony before dying while the observing King Zhou and Daji would laugh in delight.

Daji was executed on the orders of [[King Wu of Zhou]] after the fall of the Shang dynasty on the advice of [[Jiang Ziya]].

==Literature==
[[File: Hokusai Daji.jpg|thumb|Depiction of Daji in the [[Hokusai Manga]]]]
{{see also|Creations of Daji}}
Daji is featured in the Chinese novel ''[[Fengshen Yanyi]]'' as a major antagonist. She was the first featured corrupter of the declining [[Shang dynasty]] in the novel. Her father [[Su Hu]] gave her to [[King Zhou of Shang]] as an appeasement offer after armed conflict broke out between Su's and Shang military forces.

One night before Daji was sent to the capital city of [[Zhaoge]], she was possessed by an evil [[Hu Li Jing|nine-tailed fox spirit]] (aka Thousand-Year-Old Vixen). When Daji arrived in Zhaoge, she became the center of attention of King Zhou and caused the king to be extremely obsessed with her. King Zhou neglected state affairs to keep her company and ignored the advice of his subjects. [[Yunzhongzi]] was the first man to act against Daji by giving the king a magical peach-wood sword which would make Daji ill and kill her eventually. She rose above the ranks from a minor concubine to become the queen based on the king's favoritism towards her.

Daji was blamed for the fall of the Shang dynasty by corrupting King Zhou and causing him to neglect state affairs and rule with tyranny and despotism. This ultimately led to the dynasty's decline and widespread chaos. King Zhou's tyranny incurred the anger and resentment of the common people, who eventually rose up in revolt against him under [[King Wu of Zhou]]'s leadership. After the fall of the Shang dynasty, Daji was exorcised by [[Jiang Ziya]] (aka Jiang Taigong) and died eventually.

'''''De Clementia''''' (frequently translated as ''On Mercy'' in English) is a two volume (incomplete) [[hortatory]] essay written in 55–56 CE by [[Seneca the Younger]], a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[stoicism|Stoic]] [[philosopher]], to the emperor [[Nero]] in the first five years of his reign.&lt;ref&gt;James R. Harrison, ''Paul and the Imperial Authorities at Thessalonica and Rome'', 2011, p. 292&lt;/ref&gt;

==Date and writing==
The work was written after [[Nero]] had become emperor and clearly dates from an early part of Nero's reign.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Malaspina|2013|p=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Seneca's remarks, it would appear that it was written after Nero had turned eighteen, which would place it after the murder of his rival [[Brittanicus]] in 55 AD.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman174"/&gt; It may therefore been written partly as an ''apology'', perhaps as a means of assuring the Roman nobility that the murder would be the end, not the beginning of bloodshed.&lt;ref name="habby10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Habinek|2013|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work survives in a fragmentary state. Of an original three books, only the first and the beginning of the second survive.&lt;ref name="rgm93"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reynolds|Griffin|Fantham|2012|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The essay==
Seneca's ''De Clementia'' is an instructional contrast between the good ruler and the tyrant, and an evaluation of the relationship between ruler and subject. A survey of history is made in the first volume to select different rulers to point out as examples, including [[Dionysius I of Syracuse|Dionysius of Syracuse]] and [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla|Sulla]] being used as cautionary tales and young [[Augustus]] as the exemplar. An extended illustration of Augustus showing mercy to the rebellious [[Gnaeus Cornelius Cinna Magnus|Cinna]] alongside an example from Nero's own life is meant to encourage the aspiring emperor to likewise show clemency.

While the first volume is accommodated to popular understanding&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Battles|1992|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second book touches on [[Stoicism|stoic]] paradoxes and scholastic details. In general, the two books are not overly concerned with historical accuracy.

Within his essay, Seneca does not discuss the constitutional legitimacy of the [[principate]], but rather deals with the problem of having a good sovereign. The only real power, in his view, was power which was guided by the Stoic conception of ''[[logos]]'' (universal reason). Thus, clemency, not pity or unmotivated generosity, is the reasonable approach which guarantees the consent and devotion of the emperor's subjects and provides the state's security.&lt;ref&gt;Gian Conte, ''Latin Literature – A History'', 1999, pp. 412–413&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
''De Clementia'' is a rare survival of a Roman work dedicated to political advice.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman175"&gt;{{Harvnb|Malaspina|2013|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly unusual in its discussion of mercy, as later [[panegyric]]s tend to emphasise imperial piety and majesty.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman179"&gt;{{Harvnb|Malaspina|2013|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text has come down to us together with ''[[De Beneficiis]]'' in one of the earliest surviving Senecan manuscripts, as part of the 8th century ''Codex Nazarianus'' (Vat. Pal. 1547).&lt;ref name="rgm93"/&gt; In the 12th century copies of ''De Clementia'' were circulating Europe nearly always attached to ''De Beneficiis'', and in this form it reached the Renaissance.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman179"/&gt; Although always regarded as a minor work of Seneca's, it received one significant appraisal in 1532 when John Calvin published his commentary on it.&lt;ref name="hermanthegerman180"&gt;{{Harvnb|Malaspina|2013|p=179}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==John Calvin's commentary on ''De Clementia''==
Shortly after finishing his legal studies, a young [[John Calvin]] wrote his first book, a commentary on ''De Clementia.'' The commentary consists mostly of philological notes and context with other Latin writers interspersed with notes on Seneca's style and ideas. There have been three suggested reasons for this. First, [[Erasmus]] wrote the preface to his 1529 translation of Seneca that he welcomed editorial comments by young scholars. In taking up this invitation, some believe Calvin was attempting to establish his reputation as a humanist among the intellectual elite.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salley|1992|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, because there was a general revival of Stoicism in Renaissance times, it may have been simply because Calvin wanted more popularity for Seneca, who his successor in Geneva, [[Theodore Beza]], mentions as "a great favorite for him" because he was "obviously in accord with Calvin."&lt;ref&gt;''Tracts relating to the reformation. by John Calvin. With his life by Theodore Beza'', vol. I, 1844–1851, p. xxiv&lt;/ref&gt; The third possibility, generally rejected by scholars{{who|date=July 2012}}, is that he was writing to the French King [[Francis I of France|Francis I]]. The lack of a dedication to him, mention of him, and gross error that would have been made comparing Francis with Nero all lead to the theory's disuse.&lt;ref name="sally76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Salley|1992|p=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In writing his ''Commentary'', Calvin made use of the texts of two "ancient pillars," Cicero and Seneca, and two "modern pillars," Erasmus and [[Guillaume Budé|Budaeus]]. Ford Lewis Battles argues there is a third "modern pillar," [[Filippo Beroaldo|Philipus Beroaldus the Elder]]. When quoting from sources, he is less versed in Greek literature than in Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Battles|1992|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is worth noting that Calvin's brief biographical sketch of Seneca at the outset is taken almost entirely from [[Tacitus]], while ignoring the less noble picture from [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]].

Fundamentally, Calvin at this point in his career is acting as a humanist and not a Protestant reformer.&lt;ref name="sally76"/&gt; Calvin and Seneca agree that all men are sinners and sin needs to be punished, and both are committed to a deterministic theism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Salley|1992|p=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it becomes clear that Calvin had not intended to pass Stoic elements into Protestant theology, and in fact Calvin attacks the Stoic creed more often than he approves it.&lt;ref&gt;Edward F. Meylan, ''A Stoic Doctrine in Calvin'', in ''The Romanic Review'', 1937, pp. 105–115&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond theological critique, Calvin also reproves Seneca's style as too luxuriant, and remarks, "I also miss the orderly arrangement of matter, which is certainly not the least quality of a good style."&lt;ref&gt;John Calvin, ''Commentary on De Clementia'', preface iii.&lt;/ref&gt; We can already begin to see the anticipation of Calvin's full development in his writing method and can expect the transformation of Calvin's classical learning and the seriousness of the Stoic ethic into Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Battles|1992|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diocese of Aragatsotn''' ({{lang-hy|Արագածոտնի թեմ}} ''Aragatsotni t'em''), is a diocese of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] covering the [[Aragatsotn Province]] of [[Armenia]]. The name is derived from the historic Aragatsotn canton of [[Ayrarat]] province of  [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. 

The diocese was officially founded on May 30, 1996, by Catholicos [[Karekin I]]. The diocesan headquarters are located in the provincial capital [[Ashtarak]], while the cathedral of the diocese is the [[Saint Mesrop Mashtots Cathedral]] in the nearby village of [[Oshakan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://aragatsotni-tem.am/%D5%A1%D6%80%D5%A1%D5%A3%D5%A1%D5%AE%D5%B8%D5%BF%D5%B6%D5%AB-%D5%A9%D5%A5%D5%B4/ Արագածոտնի թեմը ձևավորվել է 1996թ. մայիսի 30-ին]&lt;/ref&gt; Bishop Mkrtich Broshyan is currently the primate of the diocese, serving since 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aragatsotni-tem.am/%D5%A1%D5%BC%D5%A1%D5%BB%D5%B6%D5%B8%D6%80%D5%A4/ Primate of the Diocese of Aragatsotn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Cemestry at St Marine Church 2015 5.JPG|thumb|left|The prelacy building located near the [[Saint Marianeh Church, Ashtarak|Church of Saint Marianeh]] in Ashtarak]]
Historically, the territory of modern-day Aragatsotn has been regulated by the [[Araratian Pontifical Diocese]] and the [[Diocese of Shirak]]. The towns of [[Ashtarak]] and [[Aparan]] along with their villages were under the jurisdiction of the Araratian diocese, while the town of [[Talin, Armenia|Talin]] and the surrounding areas were under the jurisdiction of Shirak diocese.

After the independence from the [[Soviet Union]], Armenia has been divided into provinces based on the territorial administration reform of 1995. During the following year, the Diocese of Aragatsotn was officially founded upon a ''[[kontakion]]'' issued by Catholicos [[Karekin I]] on May 30, 1996. The Saint Mesrop Mashtots Cathedral in Oshakan is serving as the seat of the diocese since the formation of the diocese.

Currently, the Aragatsotn diocese has 29 churches and 9 chapels under its jurisdiction.

:''Edah, should not be confused with the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] communal body in [[Israel]] known as the [[Edah HaChareidis]].''

'''Edah''' was a [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] [[Jew|Jewish]] organization, generally associated with the liberal wing of [[Orthodox Judaism]] in the [[United States]] and with the [[Religious Zionism]] movement of [[Israel]]. Its headquarters were located in [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

Edah was founded in 1996 in response to what its founding director, Rabbi [[Saul Berman]], called “the separatist trend in Modern Orthodoxy”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://jewishweek.timesofisrael.com/modern-orthodox-think-tank-to-fold/|title=Modern Orthodox Think Tank To Fold|work=Jewish Week|access-date=2017-08-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It promised in its mission statement to “give voice to the ideology and values of modern Orthodoxy and to educate and empower the community to address its concerns."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edah.org/index.cfm|title=Edah|website=www.edah.org|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Edah organized conferences, fellowships, and adult education programs, primarily in the New York metropolitan area, and to a lesser extent around the world. It also published the Edah Journal, an academic journal on Modern Orthodoxy and contemporary issues in the religious community.

In July 2006, Edah announced plans to close down its operations as a stand-alone entity. In a news release, leaders of the organization acknowledged that it had made significant achievements, but given limited financial resources available to the Orthodox community, a tactical decision was made so that its goals would be able to continue through other means.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.edah.org/edah-to-close.htm|title=News Release|website=www.edah.org|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After winding down operations, Rabbi Berman took on an administrative position at [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], a Modern Orthodox rabbinical school in New York City. YCT also assumed Edah’s journal, website, and audio-visual library.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishpress.com/indepth/front-page/the-emergence-role-and-closing-of-edah/2006/07/12/|title=The Emergence, Role, and Closing of Edah {{!}} The Jewish Press {{!}} Rabbi Saul J. Berman {{!}} 17 Tammuz 5766 – July 12, 2006 {{!}} JewishPress.com|last=Berman|first=Rabbi Saul J.|website=www.jewishpress.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Edah Journal was rebranded as ''Meorot: A Forum of Modern Orthodox Discourse'' and its publication continued by YCT.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://library.yctorah.org/journals/january-2007/|title=Meorot – Shevat 5767/2007 - YCTorah Library|website=library.yctorah.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gurudwara Goindwal Sahib.jpg|thumbnail|The Baoli Sahib]]

'''Goindwal''' ({{lang-pa|ਗੋਇੰਦਵਾਲ}}), also known as Goindwal Sahib, is located in [[Taran Taran district]] in the [[Majha]] region of the state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] in [[India]] about 23&amp;nbsp;km from [[Tarn Taran Sahib]]. In the 16th century it became an important center for the Sikh religion during the Guruship of the  [[Guru Amar Das]]. Goindwal is on the banks of the river [[Beas]] and is one of the focal points of small scale industries of [[Tarn Taran district]].

[[Guru Amar Das]] (the third Guru or the third Nanak) stayed in Goindwal for 33 years where he established a new centre for preaching Sikhism. A ''Baoli'' ([[stepwell]]), paved with 84 steps was constructed there. Some devout believe that by reciting [[Japji Sahib]], the divine ''Word'' revealed to Guru Nanak Dev at each of the 84 steps after taking a bath in the Baoli provides [[Moksha]], liberation from 84,00,000 [[Saṃsāra|cycles]] of life of this world and unity with God (mukhti). Goindval is where Guru Amar Das met Guru Ram Das, the next Guru. [[Guru Arjan Dev]] was also born there on 15 April 1563. It is called axis of Sikhism as it was the first center of Sikhism.

Today the [[Gurdwara]] and Goindwal Baoli is visited as a prime tourist destination and the massive langar or the community kitchen provides food to a large number of visitors every day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== The origin of the Goindwal name ===
The location of the town was an ancient eastwest highway that crossed the river [[Beas]] connecting Delhi and Lahore&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Surinderjit|title=The Masters &amp; The Word Divine|year=1999|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|location=Amritsar|isbn=8176013129|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the head of the most important ferries on the river Beas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Trilochan|title=Guru Tegh Bahadur, prophet and martyr: a biography|year=1967|publisher=Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee|page=107}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the renovation of the highway by Sher Shall Sur, the Afghan ruler of north India (1540–45), this ferry site became an important transit point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Jonathan|title=The Grove encyclopedia of Islamic art and architecture, Volume 2|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195309911|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led one Goinda or Gonda, a Marvaha Khatri trader,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agnihotri|first=Harbans|title=The Liberated Soul: The Life and Bani of Guru Angad Dev|year=2002|publisher=Gopal Prakashan|isbn=9788187436058|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; to plan establishing an habitation at the western end of the ferry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Census of India, 1991: Punjab, Volume 1|year=1992|publisher=Controller of Publications|location=the University of Michigan|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thwarted in his endeavour by natural calamities which Goinda attributed to evil spirits which nobody settled there, Goinda went to Khadur to seek [[Guru Angad]]'s blessing and asked if anyone of the two Guru's sons of the Guru starts living there, the superstition of the people regarding the evil spirits will vanish and the village will be inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Sikh Studies, Volume 9|year=1982|publisher=Department of Guru Nanak Studies|location=the University of California|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Surinderjit|title=The Masters &amp; The Word Divine|year=1999|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|location=Amritsar|isbn=8176013129|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guru agreed to help Goinda but none of the Guru's sons agreed to this proposal so the Guru asked his devoted disciple, (Guru) [[Guru Amar Das|Amar Das]], to help Goinda. Bhai Amar Das, who knew that tract very well as he had been carrying river water from this place to Khadur daily for his Master`s ablutions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Agnihotri|first=Harbans|title=The Liberated Soul: The Life and Bani of Guru Angad Dev|year=2002|publisher=Gopal Prakashan|isbn=9788187436058|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; laid the foundation of Goinda's village which then was named after Goinda, Goindwal. The trader Goinda had a special place built in Goindwal to honor Guru Angad Dev.

=== Bhai Amar Das's daily seva of bringing Guru Angad water ===

The Guru requested Bhai Amar Das to make Goindwal his home. During the night Bhai Amar Das slept in Goindwal and during the day he resumed his duties and carried water from the river Beas to Khadur for Guru Angad’s morning bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hansra|first=Harkirat|title=Liberty at Stake|year=2007|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595875634|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way Bhai Amar Das recited "[[Japji Sahib]]", the Sikh's morning prayer. &lt;small&gt;Gurdwara Damdama Sahib was built in commemoration of the place where Guru Amar Das took rest under a tree about one and a half miles from Goindwal, the historic tree which is also still preserved today.&lt;/small&gt; Guru Amardas stayed in Khadur to hear the hymn of "[[Asa di Var]]", a composition of Guru Angad, interspersed with hymns of Nanak. He then returned to Goindwal to fetch more water for the guru’s communal kitchen and carried it back to Khadur where Guru Angad, and his followers resided.

=== Sikh Development in Goindwal ===

Guru Angad asked his faithful follower, Bhai Amar Das, to oversee the project of building Goindwal. The guru gave Amar Das a staff&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Calcutta Review, Volumes 32-33|year=1859|publisher=University of Calcutta|page=98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RqkbAQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; with instructions that it should be used for the removal of any obstacles. Guru Angad Dev selected Bhai Amar Das as the most faithful of his Sikhs and appointed him to be his successor.

=== Guru Amar Das leaves Goindwal ===

After Gurgaddi of Guru Amar Das people visited in large crowds for a spiritual glimpse of the third Guru. This angered the jealous Dattu, the younger son of Guru Angad. Dattu come to Goindwal and found the Guru who was surrounded by his disples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jawandha|first=Nahar|title=Glimpses of Sikhism|year=2010|publisher=Sanbun Publishers|location=New Delhi|isbn=9789380213255|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rage he kicked the Guru; the Guru immediately touched his foot and feeling sorry said his foot might have been hurt by his aged bones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Surjit|title=History Of Sikh Gurus Retold 1469-1606 C.e. Vol# 1|year=2007|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126908578|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; This event and the overall dislike that Dattu had for Guru Amar Das was the cause for Guru Amar Das to decide to briefly leave Goindwal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=H. S. Singha|title=The Encyclopedia of Sikhism|year=2000|publisher=Hemkunt Press|isbn=9788170103011|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Amar Das shifted himself to his native village Basarke and closeted himself in a secluded place. The guru had written on the outside door that whosoever opens the door will not be his Sikh and he will not be his Guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the devotees became impatient to have a glimpse of the Guru, [[Baba Budha Ji|Baba Budha]], instead of opening the front door, broke open the back wall and enabled the devotees to reach the Guru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The devotees led by Baba Budha requested the Guru come back to Goindwal and then took him there. Gurdwara Sann Sahib commemorates this incident.

=== Emperor Akbar's visit ===

According to the historians, Emperor [[Akbar]] once visited the Guru in Goindwal in 1598&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dhillon|first=Dalbir|title=Sikhism Origin and Development|year=1988|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; and took lunch in the Langar while he was going from Delhi to Lahore.  Akbar was highly impressed by the tradition of Langer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism And Indian Civilization|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=9788171418794|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; that he granted land in the name of Bibi Bhani, the daughter of the Guru. Guru directed his son in law, [[Guru Ram Das]] would found [[Amritsar]] on that newly granted land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johar|first=Surinder|title=Holy Sikh Shrines|year=1998|publisher=M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd.|isbn=9788175330733|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bhai Jetha (Guru Ram Das) at Goindwal ===
[[Guru Ram Das]], whose original name before becoming the Guru was Bhai Jetha, arrived at Goindwal to remain in contact with Guru Amar Das who he had seen previously at Khadur. Bhai Jetha started earning his bread by selling cooked beans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Surinderjit|title=The Masters &amp; The Word Divine|year=1999|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|location=Amritsar|isbn=8176013129|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; however he spent most of his time in the service for the construction of the [[Baoli]] and in the [[Langar (Sikhism)|community kitchen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Surinderjit|title=The Masters &amp; The Word Divine|year=1999|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|location=Amritsar|isbn=8176013129|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guru Amar Das and his wife Mata Mansa Devi recognized Bhai Jetha's upright character and steadfast service and decided to get their daughter, Bibi Bhani married to him, they married on 1 February 1554.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harjeet|first=Singh|title=Faith and Philosophy of Sikhism|year=2009|publisher=Gyan Publishing House|isbn=9788178357218|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple stayed in Goindwal to remain in the service of the Guru. They had three sons, Bhai Prithi Chand, Bhai Mahadev, and Bhai Arjun Dev (later known as [[Guru Arjan Dev]]). After Guru Amar Das`s successor. Guru Ram Das, had built up Amritsar and made it his permanent seat but devotees still continued to visit Goindval to have a dip in the sacred Baoli and pay homage at other local shrines.

=== Guru Hargobind and Guru Tegh Bahadur's visit ===
[[Guru Hargobind]] with his family travelled from Jhabal to Goindwal. As they reached Goindwal, Guru Hargobind, his family, and his Sikhs made ablutions in the Goindwal Baoli built by Guru Amar Das. Bhai Tegh Bahadur, then barely two, was bathed with the holy water. Ablutions were repeated the following morning before Guru Hargobind left for [[Kartarpur, Pakistan|Kartarpur]]. The family were left in Goindwal on the persuasion of Baba Sundar, great-grandson of Guru Amar Das. Upon his return to Amritsar, Guru Hargobind recalled the family from Goindwal. Guru Tegh Bahadur also visited Goindwal again in 1664 after first halt during this journey was at Amritsar, followed by halts at Tarn Taran, and Khadur Sahib.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gandhi|first=Surjit|title=History Of Sikh Gurus Retold 1606-1708 C.e. Vol# 2|year=2007|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Distributors|isbn=9788126908585|page=556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guru Har Rai's visit ===
When the Mughal emperor [[Shah Jahan]]'s eldest son [[Dara Shikoh]] was seriously ill  [[Guru Har Rai]] sent a herbal medicine which cured him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism And Indian Civilization|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=9788171418794|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Sikh - Mughals relations remained on a good footing for a short time. There was eventual instability in the Delhi royal court when Shah Jehan fell ill and his second son [[Aurangzeb]] aligned himself with his youngest brother Murad against their eldest brother Dara Shikoh,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Prithi Pal|title=The History of Sikh Gurus|year=2006|publisher=Lotus Press|isbn=9788183820752|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shah Jehan's approved successor. Aurangzeb imprisoned his father in Agra and his soldiers as well as those of his youngest brother Murad forced Dara Shikoh to flee towards Punjab. Guru Har Rai was visiting Goindwal in June 1558&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism And Indian Civilization|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=9788171418794|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  along with 2200 horse riders and here he met Dara Shikoh who had come to receive his blessings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Teja|title=Highroads of Sikh History, Volumes 1-3|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dara Shikoh remembered that the Guru had been responsible for saving his life when he was sick. Dara Shikoh was both an intellectual and liberally tolerant towards other religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|title=Sikhism And Indian Civilization|year=2004|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|isbn=9788171418794|page=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great admirer of the Muslim [[Sufi]] Saint [[Mian Mir]] who was in turn a great admirer of the Gurus. Guru Har Rai granted Dara Shikoh an audience and received the prince with due courtesy. After some time Dara Shikoh was eventually captured by the forces of Aurangzeb. Aurangzeb had Dara Shikoh executed, then killed his own youngest brother Murad and appointed himself as the emperor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thackeray|first=Frank|title=Events That Formed the Modern World|year=2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781598849011|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The entrance of Goindwal is decorated with murals describing significant scenes of the [[Sikh history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurmukh|title=Historical Sikh Shrines|year=1995|publisher=Singh Bros.|isbn=9788172051518|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main gurdwara, standing next to the Baoli, white against the chequerboard of the courtyard. The Gurdwara is an example of typical [[Sikh architecture]] with a large dome tipped with a gold pinnacle - four [[cupola]]s echoing the main dome in shape and the ubiquitous facade of [[turrets]], elliptical cornices and projected windows.

Goindwal Baoli, the well of Goindwal Guru Amar Das had a Baoli, or covered step-well, constructed in Goindwal. The step-well spans about 25 feet or 8 meters. The well has a few resting places between the 84 steps providing the Sikhs a place to get together and have spiritual discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Surinderjit|title=The Masters &amp; The Word Divine|year=1999|publisher=B. Chattar Singh Jiwan Singh|location=Amritsar|isbn=8176013129|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An arched access opens to a domed entrance decorated with frescoes depicting the life of Guru Amar Das. A divided underground staircase with 84 covered steps descends beneath the earth to Goindwal's sacred waters. The Baoli is entered through a wide, pointed archway and the structure is surmounted by a large fluted dome. There are projected eaves on all sides, while the front face also has a row of small turrets. The cornice under the dome is multi-coloured with [[floral]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Gurmukh|title=Historical Sikh Shrines|year=1995|publisher=Singh Bros.|isbn=9788172051518|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hadestown''''' is the fourth [[album]] by [[Vermont]]-based [[Anais Mitchell|Anaïs Mitchell]], and was released by [[Righteous Babe Records]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] on March 9, 2010. The album, a [[concept album]], follows a variation on the [[Greek Mythology|Ancient Greek myth]] of [[Orpheus|Orpheus and Eurydice]], where [[Orpheus]] must embark on a quest to rescue his wife [[Eurydice]] from the underworld. It has been advertised as a 'folk [[opera]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the songs feature singers other than Mitchell, including [[Justin Vernon]] (better known as lead vocalist and guitarist of [[Wisconsin]]-based band [[Bon Iver]]), [[Ani DiFranco]], [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], and [[Tanya Haden|Tanya]], [[Petra Haden|Petra]] and [[Rachel Haden|Rachel]] Haden (referred to in the track listing as 'The Haden Triplets').

==Production==
The album features orchestral arrangements by [[Michael Chorney]], who was involved with Anaïs' recordings since [[Hymns for the Exiled]] in 2004. The recording itself is based upon a live version of the 'folk opera' which was performed by Mitchell with the collaboration of Mr. Chorney and a theatrical director, Ben T. Matchstick. These performances originally featured a 22-person cast and, after a tour of [[New England]], the songs began to be edited and reworked.

Within the narrative of the album, the part of [[Orpheus]] is played by Vernon, [[Persephone]] by DiFranco, [[Hades]] by [[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]], [[Moirai|The Fates]] by [[The Haden Triplets|Tanya, Petra and Rachel Haden]], [[Hermes]] by [[The Low Anthem|Ben Knox Miller]] and Mitchell herself plays [[Eurydice]].

While most of the recording was produced by [[Todd Sickafoose]] at Brooklyn Recording Studio in [[New York City]], the lead vocals were often produced elsewhere in the [[United States|U.S.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Plot==
As the album begins, "''Wedding Song''" describes the courtship of Orpheus ([[Justin Vernon]]) and Eurydice ([[Anaïs Mitchell]]). Living in a time of economic depression, she asks him how he can possibly afford to marry her and give her a good life, to which he replies that his musicianship will bring them everything they desire. Although she loves Orpheus, Eurydice seems wary and unsure whether he can provide for them. Orpheus then sings of how Hades built his empire in the underworld, using exploitation and trickery to force the residents to do his bidding ("''Epic Part I''"). Hermes ([[The Low Anthem|Ben Knox Miller]]) visits Eurydice and teaches her how to get to Hadestown, telling her it is a world full of prosperity and far away from the poverty she fears. She seems convinced although Orpheus tries to change her mind by making Hadestown out to be full of slavery and unending work. He is drowned out by Persephone ([[Ani DiFranco]]), who sings of the coming end of summer when she will be taken back to the underworld to reunite with her husband, and The Fates ([[The Haden Triplets]]), who sing of the luck that comes from living in Hadestown. Eurydice begins to question her quality of life and considers journeying down ("''Way Down Hadestown''"). In "Hey, Little Songbird" Hades himself ([[Greg Brown (folk musician)|Greg Brown]]) calls to Eurydice and lures her onto a train down to his domain in the underworld.

Eurydice apologises for leaving Orpheus, saying that she allowed her gut feelings to overrule her heart. She tries to excuse her decision by telling him that she was gone as soon as she met Hades and nothing could have stopped her from leaving ("''Gone, I'm Gone''"). The Fates chastise the listeners for judging her from their life of comfort. They then pay a visit to her and ask her what she is going to do when forced to make another tough decision ("''When the Chips Are Down''"). Orpheus is determined to rescue his love from Hadestown but Hermes warns him that it will be a difficult task to accomplish but gives him advice about how to survive the journey and shows him to the train ("''Wait for Me''"). Meanwhile, Hades reinforces his power over the underworld by manipulating it's residents into believing that, although they must work tirelessly to do Hades' bidding, that the outside world is much worse. Therefore, Hades is able to seem as if he is a benevolent ruler who is, in fact, protecting his people rather than enslaving them ("''Why We Build the Wall''"). 

Orpheus travels through Hadestown and comes across a speakeasy run by Persephone. Instead of alcohol, Persephone offers earthly desires (such as rain, wind, stars and sunlight) to her customers. When he enters, Persephone takes a liking to him ("''Our Lady of the Underground''"). In "''Flowers''", Eurydice, who has now become Hades' mistress, realises what a terrible mistake she made being tempted by his wealth and power. She regrets leaving Orpheus, the only man who ever loved her, to live with a cruel tyrant and expresses her wish to being reunited with him. The Fates pay Orpheus a visit and try to persuade him to abandon his quest to rescue Eurydice, telling him there is no chance he will succeed and trying will only bring him pain ("''Nothing Changes''"). Their words trouble him and he begins to wonder if he will ever see his true love again ("''If It's True''").

Hades, having discovered that Orpheus is trying to save Eurydice, sympathises with their plight, for he loves his own wife in the same way that Orpheus loves Eurydice. He is afraid that allowing the couple to reunite and leave the underworld would make him look weak and would cause his power over Hadestown come under threat. Persephone, knowing her husband will never give in to his humanity without encouragement, convinces him to be kind and put the love of Orpheus and Eurydice over his own greed ("''How Long?''"). When Orpheus finally reaches Hades, he appeals to him to let Eurydice go. Doing so in front of his wife and subjects forces Hades to grant the request, as refusing would reveal his true heartless nature ("''Epic Part II''"). Hades devises a plan to ensure that he maintains control of the underworld without looking weak by making a deal with Orpheus: the lovers are permitted to leave Hadestown together so long as Eurydice follows Orpheus and he does not turn around ("''His Kiss, the Riot''").

As they journey back to the surface together, doubt begins to plague Orpheus. The arrogance and confidence that filled him when he began his quest, is lost and replaced with fear because he is unable to see Eurydice and does not know if she is truly following him. As they walk Eurydice tries to reassure him that she loves him but, after her initial betrayal, Orpheus does not believe her and turns ("''Doubt Comes In''"). In the album's closing track, "''I Raise My Cup to Him''", Eurydice, doomed to remain in Hadestown forever, finds herself in Persephone's bar where they both lament the loss of love and raise a toast to Orpheus, who was forced to return to the surface alone.

Upon release, ''Hadestown'' gained extremely positive reviews overall. [[Drowned in Sound]] awarded the album a rare 10/10, stating that "Mitchell traverses such a sweeping range of emotions, genres and styles over the course of Hadestown, it’s frankly remarkable that the whole thing works at all. That it works so brilliantly well, that in under an hour it creates a world you’ll want to return to time and time again, that it is a glittering model of the form – of collaboration itself – is nothing short of awe-inspiring."&lt;ref name=drowned /&gt; [[The Guardian]] and [[NME]] were similarly effusive in their praise, awarding the album 5/5 and 9/10 respectively. Stereo Subversion's Jonathan Sanders gave the album a perfect score and called it "a lasting example of where folk music can go when the right musicians take hold of history."&lt;ref name=stereosubversion /&gt; The album also topped review aggregator website [[AnyDecentMusic?]]'s all time chart with an 8.9, the highest rating for any album until [[Frank Ocean|Frank Ocean's]] [[Channel Orange]].&lt;ref name=anydecentmusic /&gt;

"Why We Build the Wall" was later covered by English [[country folk]] musician [[Billy Bragg]] on his 2018 album [[Bridges Not Walls]].

In 2017 it was ranked number 63 in [[Paste magazine]]'s "The 100 Best Indie Folk Albums".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2017/04/the-best-indie-folk-albums-1.html?p=2 | title= The 100 Best Indie Folk Albums | accessdate=11 October 2018 |publisher=''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Hell-fresco-from-Raduil.jpg|thumb|Hell – detail from a fresco in the medieval church of St Nicholas in Raduil, [[Bulgaria]]]]
In [[religion]] and [[folklore]], '''Hell''' is an [[afterlife]] location, sometimes a place of [[torture|torment]] and [[punishment]]. [[Religion]]s with a [[Philosophy of history#Cyclical and linear history|linear]] [[Divinity|divine]] history often depict hells as eternal destinations&lt;!--(for example, see [[Christian views on hell]])--&gt; while religions with a [[reincarnation|cyclic history]] often depict a hell as an intermediary period between [[incarnation]]s.&lt;!--(for example, see Chinese [[Diyu]])--&gt; Typically these traditions locate hell in another dimension or under the [[Earth]]'s surface and often include entrances to Hell from the land of the living. Other afterlife destinations include [[Heaven]], [[Purgatory]], [[Paradise]], and [[Limbo]].

Other traditions, which do not conceive of the afterlife as a place of punishment or reward, merely describe Hell as an abode of the dead, the [[grave]], a neutral place located under the surface of Earth (for example, see [[Sheol]] and [[Christian views on Hades|Hades]]).

==Etymology==
[[File:Hel (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|''Hel'' (1889) by [[Johannes Gehrts]], depicts the Old Norse [[Hel (being)|Hel]], a goddess-like figure, in the [[Hel (location)|location of the same name]], which she oversees]]
The modern English word ''hell'' is derived from Old English ''hel'', ''helle'' (first attested around 725 AD to refer to a nether world of the dead) reaching into the [[Anglo-Saxon paganism|Anglo-Saxon pagan period]].&lt;ref name=BARNHART348&gt;[[Robert Barnhart|Barnhart, Robert K.]] (1995) ''The Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology'', page 348. [[Harper Collins]] {{ISBN|0-06-270084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word has [[cognate]]s in all branches of the [[Germanic languages]], including Old Norse ''hel'' (which refers to both a [[Hel (location)|location]] and [[Hel (being)|goddess-like being]] in [[Norse mythology]]), [[Old Frisian]] ''helle'', [[Old Saxon]] ''hellia'', [[Old High German]] ''hella'', and [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''halja''. All forms ultimately derive from the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] feminine noun *''xaljō'' or *''haljō'' ('concealed place, the underworld'). In turn, the Proto-Germanic form derives from the [[Indo-European ablaut|o-grade form]] of the [[Proto-Indo-European root]] *''kel-'', *''kol''-: 'to cover, conceal, save'.&lt;ref name="HEL-NOUN"&gt;For discussion and analysis, see Orel (2003:156) and Watkins (2000:38).&lt;/ref&gt; Indo-European cognates including Latin ''cēlāre'' ("to hide", related to the English word ''cellar'') and early Irish ''ceilid'' ("hides"). Upon the Christianization of the Germanic peoples, extension of Porto-Germanic *''xaljō'' were reinterpreted to denote the underworld in [[Christian mythology]],&lt;ref name=BARNHART348/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"hell, n. and int." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/85636. Accessed 7 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; for which see [[Gehenna]].

Related early Germanic terms and concepts include Proto-Germanic *''xalja-rūnō(n)'', a feminine compound noun, and *''xalja-wītjan'', a neutral compound noun. This form is reconstructed from the Latinized Gothic plural noun *''haliurunnae'' (attested by [[Jordanes]]; according to philologist [[Vladimir Orel]], meaning '[[witchcraft|witches]]'), Old English ''helle-rúne'' ('sorceress, [[necromancer]]', according to Orel), and Old High German ''helli-rūna'' 'magic'. The compound is composed of two elements: *''xaljō'' (*''haljō'') and *''rūnō'', the Proto-Germanic precursor to Modern English ''[[runic alphabet|rune]]''.&lt;ref name="HELL-RUNE"&gt;See discussion at Orel (2003:155-156 &amp; 310).&lt;/ref&gt; The second element in the Gothic ''haliurunnae'' may however instead be an agent noun from the verb ''rinnan'' ("to run, go"), which would make its literal meaning "one who travels to the netherworld".&lt;ref&gt;Scardigli, Piergiuseppe, Die Goten: Sprache und Kultur (1973) pp. 70-71.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehmann, Winfred, A Gothic Etymological Dictionary (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

Proto-Germanic *''xalja-wītjan'' (or *''halja-wītjan'') is reconstructed from Old Norse ''hel-víti'' 'hell', Old English ''helle-wíte'' 'hell-torment, hell', Old Saxon ''helli-wīti'' 'hell', and the Middle High German feminine noun ''helle-wīze''. The compound is a compound of *''xaljō'' (discussed above) and *''wītjan'' (reconstructed from forms such as Old English ''witt'' 'right mind, wits', Old Saxon ''gewit'' 'understanding', and Gothic ''un-witi'' 'foolishness, understanding').&lt;ref name="HELVÍTI"&gt;Orel (2003:156 &amp; 464).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion, mythology, and folklore==
Hell appears in several [[mythology|mythologies]] and [[religion]]s. It is commonly inhabited by [[demon]]s and the [[soul]]s of dead people. A fable about Hell which recurs in [[folklore]] across several cultures is the [[allegory of the long spoons]]. Hell is often depicted in art and literature, perhaps most famously in [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.

==Punishment==
Punishment in Hell typically corresponds to [[sin]]s committed during life. Sometimes these distinctions are specific, with [[Damnation#Religious|damned]] souls suffering for each sin committed (see for example Plato's [[myth of Er]] or Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]''), but sometimes they are general, with condemned sinners relegated to one or more chamber of Hell or to a level of suffering.

In many religious cultures, including Christianity and Islam, Hell is often depicted as fiery, painful, and harsh, inflicting suffering on the guilty. Despite these common depictions of Hell as a place of fire, some other traditions portray Hell as cold. Buddhist - and particularly Tibetan Buddhist - descriptions of Hell feature an equal number of hot and cold Hells. Among Christian descriptions [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' portrays the innermost (9th) circle of Hell as a frozen lake of blood and guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

With the rise of the cult of [[Osiris]] during the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]] the "democratization of religion" offered to even his humblest followers the prospect of eternal life, with moral fitness becoming the dominant factor in determining a person's suitability. At death a person faced judgment by a tribunal of forty-two divine judges. If they had led a life in conformance with the precepts of the Goddess [[Maat]], who represented truth and right living, the person was welcomed into the heavenly [[Aaru|reed fields]]. If found guilty the person was thrown to [[Ammit]], the "devourer of the dead" and would be condemned to the [[lake of fire]].&lt;ref&gt;''Religion and Magic in Ancient Egypt'', Rosalie David, p. 158–159, Penguin, 2002, {{ISBN|0-14-026252-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The person taken by the devourer is subject first to terrifying punishment and then annihilated.

===Greek===
{{Main|Tartarus}}
In classic [[Greek mythology]], below Heaven, Earth, and [[Pontus (mythology)|Pontus]] is [[Tartarus]], or ''Tartaros'' (Greek Τάρταρος, deep place). It is either a deep, gloomy place, a pit or abyss used as a dungeon of torment and suffering that resides within Hades (the entire underworld) with Tartarus being the hellish component. In the ''Gorgias'', [[Plato]] (c. 400 BC) wrote that souls were judged after death and those who received punishment were sent to Tartarus. As a place of punishment, it can be considered a hell. The classic Hades, on the other hand, is more similar to Old Testament Sheol.

===Europe===
The hells of Europe include Breton mythology's "Anaon", [[Celtic mythology]]'s "Uffern", [[Slavic mythology]]'s "Peklo", the hell of [[Sami mythology]] and Finnish "[[tuonela]]" ("manala").

===Asia===
The hells of Asia include the [[Bagobo]] "Gimokodan" and Ancient [[Hindu mythology|Indian mythology]]'s "Kalichi" or "[[Naraka]]".

In folklore among the [[Ainu people]], hell is below ground, and is described as an uninviting wet place reserved for sinful people.&lt;ref&gt;Ainu Folklore: Traditions and Culture of the Vanishing Aborigines of Japan - Page 150, Carl Etter - 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
African hells include [[Haida mythology]]'s ''Hetgwauge'' and the Hell of Swahili mythology (''kuzimu'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crisafulli|first1=Chuck|last2=Thompson|first2=Kyra|title=Go to Hell: A Heated History of the Underworld|date=2010|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1451604733|page=75|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h-SHq2vPd-4C&amp;pg=PA75|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rejection and becoming a wandering soul is a sort of hell for one [[Death|passing over]]. The souls of the dead must make their way to ''Jaaniw'' (the sacred dwelling place of the soul). Only those who have lived their lives on earth in accordance with [[Serer religion#Religious law|Serer doctrines]] will be able to make this necessary journey and thus accepted by the ancestors. Those who can't make the journey become lost and wandering souls, but they do not burn in "hell fire".&lt;ref name="Thiaw"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], "La civilisation sereer, vol.

The hells of the Americas include the [[Aztec religion]]'s ''[[Mictlan]]'', [[Inuit religion]]'s ''[[Adlivun]]'', and the [[Yanomami]] religion's ''[[Shobari Waka]]''. In [[Mayan religion]], ''[[Xibalba]]'' (or ''Metnal'') is the dangerous underworld of nine levels. The road into and out of it is said to be steep, thorny and very forbidding. Ritual healers would intone healing prayers banishing diseases to ''Xibalba''. Much of the [[Popol Vuh]] describes the adventures of the [[Maya Hero Twins]] in their cunning struggle with the evil lords of ''Xibalba''.

The [[Aztec]]s believed that the dead traveled to ''Mictlan'', a neutral place found far to the north. There was also a legend of a place of white flowers, which was always dark, and was home to the gods of death, particularly Mictlantecutli and his spouse Mictlantecihuatl, which means literally "lords of Mictlan". The journey to ''Mictlan'' took four years, and the travelers had to overcome difficult tests, such as passing a mountain range where the mountains crashed into each other, a field where the wind carried flesh-scraping knives, and a river of blood with fearsome [[jaguar]]s.

==Abrahamic religions==
Hell is viewed by most Abrahamic traditions as a place of or a form of [[punishment]].&lt;ref&gt;''Heart of Buddha, Heart of China: James Carter'' - 2010, p 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Gehenna|Sheol}}
Early Judaism had no concept of Hell, although the concept of an afterlife was introduced during the [[Hellenistic period]], apparently from neighboring [[Hellenistic religion]]s. It occurs for example in [[Book of Daniel]]. Daniel 12:2 proclaims "And many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, Some to everlasting life, Some to shame and everlasting contempt."

[[Judaism]] does not have a specific doctrine about the afterlife, but it does have a mystical/Orthodox tradition of describing [[Gehinnom]]. Gehinnom is not Hell, but originally a grave and in later times a sort of Purgatory where one is judged based on one's life's deeds, or rather, where one becomes fully aware of one's own shortcomings and negative actions during one's life. The [[Kabbalah]] explains it as a "waiting room" (commonly translated as an "entry way") for all souls (not just the wicked). The overwhelming majority of rabbinic thought maintains that people are not in Gehinnom forever; the longest that one can be there is said to be 12 months, however there has been the occasional noted exception. Some consider it a spiritual forge where the soul is purified for its eventual ascent to [[Jewish eschatology#The afterlife and olam haba (the world to come)|Olam Habah]] (''heb.'' עולם הבא; ''lit.'' "The world to come", often viewed as analogous to heaven). This is also mentioned in the Kabbalah, where the soul is described as breaking, like the flame of a candle lighting another: the part of the soul that ascends being pure and the "unfinished" piece being reborn.

According to Jewish teachings, hell is not entirely physical; rather, it can be compared to a very intense feeling of shame. People are ashamed of their misdeeds and this constitutes suffering which makes up for the bad deeds. When one has so deviated from the will of [[God in Judaism|God]], one is said to be in Gehinnom. This is not meant to refer to some point in the future, but to the very present moment. The gates of [[teshuva]] (return) are said to be always open, and so one can align his will with that of God at any moment. Being out of alignment with God's will is itself a punishment according to the [[Torah]].

Many scholars of Jewish mysticism, particularly of the [[Kabbalah]], make mention of seven "compartments" or "habitations" of Hell, just as there are seven divisions of [[Heaven]]. These divisions go by many different names, and the most frequently mentioned are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;(edit.) Boustan, Ra'anan S. Reed, Annette Yoshiko.

[[File:Fra Angelico 010.jpg|thumb|''The Last Judgement, Hell'', circa 1431, by [[Fra Angelico]]]]
The Christian doctrine of hell derives from passages in the [[New Testament]]. The word ''hell'' does not appear in the Greek New Testament; instead one of three words is used: the Greek words ''Tartarus'' or ''Hades'', or the Hebrew word ''Gehinnom''.

In the [[Septuagint]] and New Testament the authors used the Greek term Hades for the Hebrew Sheol, but often with Jewish rather than Greek concepts in mind. In the Jewish concept of Sheol, such as expressed in Ecclesiastes,&lt;ref&gt;Ecclesiastes 9:10 πάντα ὅσα ἂν εὕρῃ ἡ χείρ σου τοῦ ποιῆσαι ὡς ἡ δύναμίς σου ποίησον ὅτι οὐκ ἔστιν ποίημα καὶ λογισμὸς καὶ γνῶσις καὶ σοφία ἐν ᾅδῃ ὅπου σὺ πορεύῃ ἐκεῖ&lt;/ref&gt; Sheol or Hades is a place where there is no activity. However, since [[Augustine]], Christians have believed that the souls of those who die either rest peacefully, in the case of Christians, or are afflicted, in the case of the damned, after death until the [[resurrection]].&lt;ref name="Hoekema"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoekema|first=Anthony A|title=The Bible and the Future|year=1994|location=Grand Rapids|publisher=Wm.

While these three terms are translated in the KJV as "hell" these three terms have three very different meanings.
* Hades has similarities to the Old Testament term, [[Sheol]] as "the place of the dead" or "grave". Thus, it is used in reference to both the righteous and the wicked, since both wind up there eventually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Unger |first=Merrill F.|authorlink=Merrill_Unger |year=1981 |title='''Unger's Bible Dictionary''' |publisher=Moody Bible Institute, The |location=Chicago|page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Gehenna refers to the "Valley of Hinnom", which was a garbage dump outside of Jerusalem. It was a place where people burned their garbage and thus there was always a fire burning there. Bodies of those deemed to have died in sin without hope of salvation (such as people who committed suicide) were thrown there to be destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Schaf-Herzog Encyclopedia of religious Knowledge'', p. 415&lt;/ref&gt; Gehenna is used in the New Testament as a metaphor for the final place of punishment for the wicked after the resurrection.&lt;ref&gt;The New Schaf-Herzog Encyclopedia of religious Knowledge pgs. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Tartaróō'' (the verb "throw to [[Tartarus]]", used of the fall of the Titans in [[The Illiad|Illiad]] 14.296) occurs only once in the New Testament in II Peter 2:4, where it is parallel to the use of the noun form in [[1 Enoch]] as the place of incarceration of the fallen angels. It mentions nothing about human souls being sent there in the afterlife.

The [[Roman Catholic Church]] defines Hell as "a state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed." One finds oneself in Hell as the result of dying in [[mortal sin]] without repenting and accepting God's merciful love, becoming eternally separated from him by one's own free choice&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', Article 1033&lt;/ref&gt; immediately after death.&lt;ref&gt;''Catechism of the Catholic Church'', Article 1035&lt;/ref&gt; In the Roman Catholic Church, many other Christian churches, such as the Baptists and Episcopalians, and some [[Greek Orthodox]] churches,&lt;ref&gt;See Kallistos Ware, "Dare we hope for the salvation of all?" in ''The Inner Kingdom: Volume 1 of the Collected Works''&lt;/ref&gt; Hell is taught as the final destiny of those who have not been found worthy after the [[general resurrection]] and [[last judgment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20:11-15|title=Revelation 20:11-15|website=Bible Gateway|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203142225/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+20:11-15|archivedate=3 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=romans+6:23|title=Romans 6:23|website=Bible Gateway|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602120139/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+6:23|archivedate=2 June 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mt 25:31, 32, 46&lt;/ref&gt; where they will be eternally punished for [[sin]] and permanently separated from God. The nature of this judgment is inconsistent with many [[Protestant]] churches teaching the saving comes from accepting Jesus Christ as their savior, while the Greek Orthodox and [[Catholic Church]]es teach that the judgment hinges on both faith and works. However, many [[Liberal Christian]]s throughout Liberal Protestant and Anglican churches believe in [[universal reconciliation]] (see below) even though it might contradict more evangelical views in their denomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/699929.stm |publisher=BBC |title=Hell - it's about to get hotter |date=4 April 2000 |accessdate=30 April 2012 |first1=Joe |last1=Gooden |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031013436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/699929.stm |archivedate=31 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some modern Christian theologians subscribe to the doctrines of [[Christian conditionalism|conditional immortality]]. Conditional immortality is the belief that the soul dies with the body and does not live again until the resurrection. As with other Jewish writings of the [[Second Temple]] period, the New Testament text distinguishes two words, both translated "Hell" in older English Bibles: ''Hades'', "the grave", and ''Gehenna'' where God "can destroy both body and soul".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=4.9 Hell|url=http://www.christadelphians.com/biblebasics/0409hell.html|publisher=The Christadelphians|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority of Christians read this to mean that neither Hades nor Gehenna are eternal but refer to the ultimate destruction of the wicked in the Lake of Fire in a consuming fire after resurrection. However, because of the Greek words used in translating from the Hebrew text has become confused with Greek myths and ideas.  In the Hebrew text when people died they went to [[Sheol]], the grave&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hirsch|first1=Emil G|title=SHEOL|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13563-sheol|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=10 August 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150918204814/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13563-sheol|archivedate=18 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the wicked ultimately went to Gehenna which is the consuming by fire. So we see where the grave or death or eventual destruction of the wicked, was translated using Greek words that since they had no exact ones to use, became a mix of mistranslation, pagan influence, and Greek myth associated with the word, but its original meaning was simple death or the destruction of the wicked at the end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bedore, Th.D.|first1=W.

[[Christian mortalism]] is the doctrine that all men and women, including Christians, must die, and do not continue and are not conscious after death. Therefore, [[annihilationism]] includes the doctrine that "the wicked" are also destroyed rather than [[tortured|tormented]] [[eternity|forever]] in traditional "Hell" or the [[lake of fire]]. Christian mortalism and annihilationism are directly related to the doctrine of conditional immortality, the idea that a human [[soul]] is not immortal unless it is given eternal life at the [[second coming of Christ]] and [[resurrection of the dead]].

Biblical scholars looking at the issue through the Hebrew text have denied the teaching of innate immortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | quote = Many biblical scholars down throughout history, looking at the issue through Hebrew rather than Greek eyes, have denied the teaching of innate immortality. | last = Knight | title = A brief history of Seventh-Day Adventists | page = 42 | year = 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Pool | 1998 | p = 133 | ps =: ‘Various concepts of conditional immortality or annihilationism have appeared earlier in Baptist history as well. Several examples illustrate this claim. General as well as particular Baptists developed versions of annihilationism or conditional immortality.’}} Rejection of the [[immortality of the soul]], and advocacy of Christian mortalism, was a feature of Protestantism since the early days of the [[Reformation]] with [[Martin Luther]] himself rejecting the traditional idea, though his view did not carry into orthodox [[Lutheranism]]. One of the most notable English opponents of the immortality of the soul was [[Thomas Hobbes]] who describes the idea as a Greek "contagion" in Christian doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. State ''Thomas Hobbes and the Debate Over Natural Law and Religion'' 2013 "The natural immortality of the soul is in fact a pagan presumption: "For men being generally possessed before the time of our Saviour, by contagion of the Daemonology of the Greeks, of an opinion, that the Souls of men were substances distinct from their Bodies, and therefore that when the Body was dead"&lt;/ref&gt; Modern proponents of conditional immortality include some in the [[Anglican church]] such as [[N.T. Wright]]&lt;ref&gt;N.T. Wright ''For All the Saints?: Remembering the Christian Departed'' 2004 "many readers will get the impression that I believe that every human being comes already equipped with an immortal soul. I don't believe that. Immortality is a gift of God in Christ, not an innate human capacity (see 1 Timothy 6.16)."&lt;/ref&gt; and as denominations the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Bible Student movement|Bible Students]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Christadelphians]], Living Church of God, The Church of God International, and some other [[Protestant]] [[Christians]], as well as recent [[Roman Catholic]] teaching. It is not [[Roman Catholic]] dogma that anyone is in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43596919|title=Vatican: Pope did not say there is no hell|date=2018-03-30|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-GB|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331001451/http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43596919|archivedate=31 March 2018|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the 1993 ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'' (CCC) seems to allow room for new understanding.  In 1033 it states: 'This state of definitive self-exclusion from communion with God and the blessed is called "hell”’. Then in 1035 its use of quotation marks can imply the metaphorical nature of the description, and the words that follow are certainly open to interpretation: "… they suffer the punishments of hell, "eternal fire." The chief punishment of hell is eternal separation from God" (CCC 1035).  During an Audience in 1999, [[Pope John Paul II]] commented: "images of hell that Sacred Scripture presents to us must be correctly interpreted. They show the complete frustration and emptiness of life without God. Rather than a place, hell indicates the state of those who freely and definitively separate themselves from God, the source of all life and joy." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite|url=http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_28071999.html|title=GENERAL AUDIENCE 28 July 1999|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113172530/http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul-ii/en/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_28071999.html|archivedate=13 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See "25. Second Coming of Christ", "26. Death and Resurrection", "27. Millennium and the End of Sin", and "28. New Earth".

[[Biblical Perspectives]], 1997; {{ISBN|1-930987-12-9}}, {{ISBN|978-1-930987-12-8}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They deny the Catholic purgatory and teach that the dead lie in the grave until they are [[Last judgment|raised for a last judgment]], both the righteous and wicked await the resurrection at the [[Second Coming]]. Seventh-day Adventists believe that [[death]] is a state of [[Soul sleep|unconscious sleep]] until the resurrection. They base this belief on biblical texts such as {{Bibleverse||Ecclesiastes|9:5|NIV}} which states "the dead know nothing", and {{Bibleverse|1|Thessalonians|4:13-18|NIV}} which contains a description of the dead being raised from the [[Grave (burial)|grave]] at the second coming. These verses, it is argued, indicate that death is only a period or form of slumber.

Adventists teach that the resurrection of the righteous will take place at the second coming of [[Jesus]], while the resurrection of the wicked will occur after the [[Millennialism|millennium]] of {{Bibleverse||Revelation|20|NIV}}. They reject the traditional doctrine of hell as a state of everlasting conscious torment, believing instead that the wicked will be permanently destroyed after the millennium.

The Adventist views about death and hell reflect an underlying belief in: (a) conditional immortality (or conditionalism), as opposed to the [[Physical Immortality|immortality]] of the [[soul]]; and (b) the [[holism|holistic]] (or monistic) [[Christian anthropology]] or nature of [[human beings]], as opposed to [[bipartite (theology)|bipartite]] or [[tripartite (theology)|tripartite]] views.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] hold that the soul ceases to exist when the person dies&lt;ref name="bibleteach"&gt;"What Does the Bible Really Teach?", 2005, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore that Hell (Sheol or Hades) is a state of non-existence.&lt;ref name="bibleteach" /&gt; In their theology, Gehenna differs from Sheol or Hades in that it holds no hope of a resurrection.&lt;ref name="bibleteach" /&gt; Tartarus is held to be the metaphorical state of debasement of the fallen angels between the time of their moral fall (Genesis chapter 6) until their post-millennial destruction along with Satan (Revelation chapter 20).&lt;ref&gt;"Insight on the scriptures, Volume 2", 1988, Published by Jehovah's Witnesses.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christian Universalism|Christian Universalists]] believe in [[universal reconciliation]], the belief that all human souls (even demons and fallen angels) will be eventually reconciled with God and admitted to Heaven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-12-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122135418/http://www.auburn.edu/~allenkc/chr-univ.html |archivedate=22 November 2017 |df=dmy-all }} What is Christian Universalism by Ken Allen Th.D&lt;/ref&gt; This view is held by some [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian-Universalists]].&lt;ref&gt;''New Bible Dictionary'', "Hell", InterVarsity Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''New Dictionary of Biblical Theology'', "Hell", InterVarsity Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Evangelical Alliance]] Commission on Truth and Unity Among Evangelicals, ''The Nature of Hell'', Paternoster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s [[Second Coming]] [[Christian]] revelation, hell exists because evil people want it.&lt;ref&gt;Swedenborg, E.

Members of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teach that hell is a state between death and resurrection, in which those spirits who did not repent while on earth must suffer for their own sins (Doctrine and Covenants 19:15–17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 19|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017052659/http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19?lang=eng|archivedate=17 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In Islam, ''[[jahannam]]'' (in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]]: جهنم) (related to the Hebrew word ''gehinnom'') is a place filled with blazing fire, boiling water, and a variety of other torments for those who have been condemned to it in the hereafter.

[[File:Ngaye (Naraka) in Burmese art.jpg|thumb|Naraka in the Burmese representation]]
In "Devaduta Sutta", the 130th discourse of the [[Majjhima Nikaya]], Buddha teaches about hell in vivid detail. Buddhism teaches that there are five (sometimes six) realms of rebirth, which can then be further subdivided into degrees of agony or pleasure. Of these realms, the hell realms, or ''Naraka'', is the lowest realm of rebirth. Of the hell realms, the worst is ''[[Avici|Avīci]]'' or "endless suffering". The Buddha's disciple, [[Devadatta]], who tried to kill the Buddha on three occasions, as well as create a schism in the monastic order, is said to have been reborn in the Avici Hell.

However, like all realms of rebirth, rebirth in the Hell realms is not permanent, though suffering can persist for eons before being reborn again. In the [[Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha teaches that eventually even Devadatta will become a Pratyekabuddha himself, emphasizing the temporary nature of the Hell realms. Thus, Buddhism teaches to escape the endless migration of rebirths (both positive and negative) through the attainment of [[Nirvana]].

The [[Bodhisattva]] [[Ksitigarbha]], according to the Ksitigarbha Sutra, made a great vow as a young girl to not reach Nirvana until all beings were liberated from the Hell Realms or other unwholesome rebirths. In popular literature, Ksitigarbha travels to the Hell realms to teach and relieve beings of their suffering.

===Hinduism===
{{Main|Naraka (Hinduism)}}

[[File:Yama's Court and Hell.jpg|thumb|Yama's Court and Hell. The Blue figure is [[Yamaraja]] (The Hindu god of death) with his consort [[Yami]] and [[Chitragupta]] &lt;br /&gt; 17th-century painting from Government Museum, [[Chennai]].]]
Early Vedic religion does not have a concept of Hell. Ṛg-veda mentions three realms, bhūr (the [[earth]]), svar (the [[sky]]) and [[Loka|bhuvas]] or antarikṣa (the middle area, i.e. air or [[atmosphere]]). In later Hindu literature, especially the law books and Puranas, more realms are mentioned, including a realm similar to Hell, called [[naraka]] (in Devanāgarī: नरक). [[Yama]] as the first born human (together with his twin sister [[Yamuna in Hinduism|Yamī]]), by virtue of precedence, becomes ruler of men and a judge on their departure. Originally he resides in Heaven, but later, especially medieval, traditions mention his court in naraka.

In the law-books (smṛtis and dharma-sūtras, like the Manu-smṛti), naraka is a place of punishment for sins. It is a lower spiritual plane (called ''naraka-loka'') where the spirit is judged and the partial fruits of [[karma]] affect the next life. In [[Mahabharata]] there is a mention of the [[Pandavas]] and the [[Kauravas]] both going to Heaven. At first Yudhisthir goes to heaven where he sees Duryodhana enjoying heaven; Indra tells him that Duryodhana is in heaven as he did his Kshatriya duties. Then he shows Yudhisthir hell where it appears his brothers are. Later it is revealed that this was a test for Yudhisthir and that his brothers and the Kauravas are all in heaven and live happily in the divine abode of gods. Hells are also described in various [[Purana]]s and other scriptures. The Garuda Purana gives a detailed account of Hell and its features; it lists the amount of punishment for most crimes, much like a modern-day penal code.

It is believed that people who commit sins go to Hell and have to go through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god [[Yama (Hinduism)|Yamarāja]], who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by [[Chitragupta]], who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of [[karma]]. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; but if one has generally led a pious life, one ascends to [[svarga]], a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.

According to [[Brahma Kumaris]] iron world (kalyug, a stage of world cycle) is regarded as hell.

===Jainism===
{{Main|Naraka (Jainism)}}
[[File:Seven Jain Hells.jpg|thumb|right|17th-century cloth painting depicting seven levels of [[Jain cosmology|Jain]] Hell and various tortures suffered in them. Left panel depicts the demi-god and his animal vehicle presiding over each Hell.]]
In [[Jain cosmology]], Naraka (translated as Hell) is the name given to realm of existence having great suffering. However, a Naraka differs from the hells of [[Abrahamic religions]] as souls are not sent to Naraka as the result of a divine judgment and punishment. Furthermore, length of a being's stay in a Naraka is not eternal, though it is usually very long and measured in billions of years. A soul is born into a Naraka as a direct result of his or her previous [[Karma in Jainism|karma]] (actions of body, speech and mind), and resides there for a finite length of time until his karma has achieved its full result. After his karma is used up, he may be reborn in one of the higher worlds as the result of an earlier karma that had not yet ripened.

The Hells are situated in the seven grounds at the lower part of the universe. The seven grounds are:
# Ratna prabha
# Sharkara prabha.
# Valuka prabha.
# Panka prabha.
# Dhuma prabha.
# Tamaha prabha.
# Mahatamaha prabha.

The hellish beings are a type of souls which are residing in these various hells. They are born in hells by sudden manifestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sanghvi | first =Sukhlal | title =Commentary on Tattvārthasūtra of Vācaka Umāsvāti | publisher =L. D. Institute of Indology | year =1974 | location =Ahmedabad | language =|others=trans. by K. K. Dixit}} pp. 107&lt;/ref&gt; The hellish beings possess ''vaikriya''  body (protean body which can transform itself and take various forms). They have a fixed life span (ranging from ten thousand to billions of years) in the respective hells where they reside. According to Jain scripture, [[Tattvarthasutra]], following are the causes for birth in hell:&lt;ref&gt;Sanghvi, Sukhlal (1974) pp.250-52&lt;/ref&gt;
#Killing or causing pain with intense passion.
#Excessive attachment to things and worldly pleasure with constantly indulging in cruel and violent acts.
#Vowless and unrestrained life.&lt;ref&gt;refer [[Mahavrata]] for the vows and restraints in Jainism&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Sikhism===
In Sikh thought, Hell and Heaven are not places for living hereafter, they are part of spiritual topography of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&amp;pg=PA271 | title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism | publisher=Unistar Books | last=Singh | first=Jagraj | year=2009 | pages=271 | isbn=978-8-1714-2754-3 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170424012358/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&amp;pg=PA271 | archivedate=24 April 2017 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Guru Arjan]] explains that people who are entangled in emotional attachment and doubt are living in hell on this Earth i.e. their life is hellish.

{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;So many are being drowned in emotional attachment and doubt; they dwell in the most horrible hell.&lt;/poem&gt;|Guru Arjan|Guru Granth Sahib 297|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=297|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170903031902/http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=297|archivedate=3 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Taoism===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Ancient [[Taoism]] had no concept of Hell, as morality was seen to be a man-made distinction and there was no concept of an immaterial soul. In its home country [[China]], where Taoism adopted tenets of other religions, popular belief endows Taoist Hell with many deities and spirits who punish sin in a variety of horrible ways.

===Chinese folk beliefs===
{{Main|Diyu}}
[[File:ROM-ChineseGallery-DemonSculpture.png|upright|thumb|right|A Chinese glazed earthenware sculpture of "Hell's torturer", 16th century, [[Ming Dynasty]]]]
''Diyu'' is the realm of the dead in [[Chinese mythology]]. It is very loosely based upon the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] concept of [[Naraka (Buddhism)|Naraka]] combined with traditional Chinese afterlife beliefs and a variety of popular expansions and re-interpretations of these two traditions. Ruled by [[Yama (East Asia)|Yanluo Wang]], the King of Hell, Diyu is a maze of underground levels and chambers where souls are taken to atone for their earthly sins.

Incorporating ideas from [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] as well as traditional Chinese folk religion, Diyu is a kind of purgatory place which serves not only to punish but also to renew spirits ready for their next incarnation. There are many deities associated with the place, whose names and purposes are the subject of much conflicting information.

The exact number of levels in Chinese Hell - and their associated deities - differs according to the Buddhist or Taoist perception. Some speak of three to four 'Courts', other as many as ten. The ten judges are also known as the 10 Kings of [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Yama]]. Each Court deals with a different aspect of atonement. For example, murder is punished in one Court, adultery in another. According to some Chinese legends, there are eighteen levels in Hell. Punishment also varies according to belief, but most legends speak of highly imaginative chambers where wrong-doers are sawn in half, beheaded, thrown into pits of filth or forced to climb trees adorned with sharp blades.

However, most legends agree that once a soul (usually referred to as a 'ghost') has atoned for their deeds and repented, he or she is given the Drink of Forgetfulness by [[Meng Po]] and sent back into the world to be reborn, possibly as an animal or a poor or sick person, for further punishment.

==Other traditions==
===Zoroastrianism===
{{Main|Zoroastrian eschatology}}
[[Zoroastrianism]] has historically suggested several possible fates for the wicked, including annihilation, purgation in molten metal, and eternal punishment, all of which have standing in Zoroaster's writings. [[Zoroastrian eschatology]] includes the belief that wicked souls will remain in hell until, following the arrival of three saviors at thousand-year intervals, [[Ahura Mazda]] reconciles the world, destroying evil and resurrecting tormented souls to perfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |title=An Introduction to Zoroastrianism |author=Meredith Sprunger |accessdate=10 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206152658/http://www.ubfellowship.org/archive/readers/601_zoroastrianism.htm |archivedate=6 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sacred [[Gathas]] mention a "House of the Lie″ for those "that are of an evil dominion, of evil deeds, evil words, evil Self, and evil thought, Liars."&lt;ref&gt;[[Yasna]] 49:11, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | title=Avesta: Yasna | accessdate=11 October 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009200459/http://www.avesta.org/yasna/y47to50b.htm | archivedate=9 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the best-known Zoroastrian text to describe hell in detail is the [[Book of Arda Viraf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=About Zoroastrian Hell | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=10 February 2006 | accessdate=10 October 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015035745/http://www.hell-on-line.org/AboutZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=15 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts particular punishments for particular sins—for instance, being trampled by cattle as punishment for neglecting the needs of work animals.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 75, {{cite web | url=http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | title=The Book of Arda Viraf | accessdate=10 October 2008 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008091012/http://www.avesta.org/pahlavi/viraf.html | archivedate=8 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other descriptions can be found in the ''Book of Scriptures (Hadhokht Nask), Religious Judgments (Dadestan-i Denig)'' and the ''Book of the Judgments of the Spirit of Wisdom (Mainyo-I-Khard)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | title=Zoroastrian Hell Texts | author=Eileen Gardiner | date=18 January 2009 | accessdate=24 August 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917075010/http://www.hell-on-line.org/TextsZOR.html#The%20Fate%20of%20the%20Soul | archivedate=17 September 2010 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wicca===
In [[Wicca]], there is no such thing as hell because Wiccans largely do not believe in the concept of punishment or reward.&lt;ref&gt;''Solitary Wicca For Life: Complete Guide to Mastering the Craft on your Own'' - Page 162&lt;/ref&gt; Although Wiccan views differ among different denominations, Wiccans tend to prefer viewing the [[Horned God]] and the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]] as gentle deities.&lt;ref&gt;''Living Wicca: A Further Guide for the Solitary Practitioner''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
[[File:William Bouguereau - Dante and Virgile - Google Art Project.jpg|upright|thumb|''[[Dante]] and [[Virgil]] in Hell'' (1850) by [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]]. In this painting, the two are shown watching the condemned.]]
{{Main|Hell in popular culture}}
In his ''[[Divine Comedy|Divina commedia]]'' (''Divine Comedy''), set in the year 1300), [[Dante|Dante Alighieri]] employed the concept of taking [[Virgil]] as his guide through Inferno (and then, in the second canticle, up the mountain of [[Purgatory|Purgatorio]]). Virgil himself is not condemned to Hell proper in Dante's poem but is rather, as a virtuous pagan, confined to [[Limbo]] just at the edge of Hell. The geography of Hell is very elaborately laid out in this work, with nine concentric rings leading deeper into the Earth and deeper into the various punishments of Hell, until, at the center of the world, Dante finds [[Satan]] himself trapped in the frozen lake of [[Cocytus]]. A small tunnel leads past Satan and out to the other side of the world, at the base of the Mount of Purgatory.

[[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' (1667) opens with the [[fallen angel]]s, including their leader [[Satan]], waking up in Hell after having been defeated in the war in heaven and the action returns there at several points throughout the poem. Milton portrays Hell as the abode of the demons, and the passive prison from which they plot their revenge upon Heaven through the corruption of the human race. 19th-century French poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]] alluded to the concept as well in the title and themes of one of his major works, ''[[Une Saison en Enfer|A Season In Hell]]''. Rimbaud's poetry portrays his own suffering in a poetic form as well as other themes.
[[File:019Visita al infierno.jpg|thumb|left|''Visit to hell'' by Mexican artist [[Mauricio García Vega]].]]
Many of the great epics of European literature include episodes that occur in Hell. In the Roman poet [[Virgil]]'s Latin epic, the ''[[Aeneid]]'', Aeneas descends into [[Hades|Dis]] (the underworld) to visit his father's spirit. The underworld is only vaguely described, with one unexplored path leading to the punishments of Tartarus, while the other leads through Erebus and the Elysian Fields.

The idea of Hell was highly influential to writers such as [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] who authored the 1944 play ''[[No Exit]]'' about the idea that "Hell is other people". Although not a religious man, Sartre was fascinated by his interpretation of a Hellish state of suffering. [[C.S. Lewis]]'s ''[[The Great Divorce]]'' (1945) borrows its title from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'' (1793) and its inspiration from the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as the narrator is likewise guided through Hell and Heaven. Hell is portrayed here as an endless, desolate twilight city upon which night is imperceptibly sinking. The night is actually the [[Apocalypse]], and it heralds the arrival of the demons after their judgment. Before the night comes, anyone can escape Hell if they leave behind their former selves and accept Heaven's offer, and a journey to Heaven reveals that Hell is infinitely small; it is nothing more or less than what happens to a soul that turns away from God and into itself.

[[Piers Anthony]] in his series ''[[Incarnations of Immortality]]'' portrays examples of Heaven and Hell via Death, Fate, Underworld, Nature, War, Time, Good-God, and Evil-Devil. [[Robert A. Heinlein]] offers a [[yin-yang]] version of Hell where there is still some good within; most evident in his book ''[[Job: A Comedy of Justice]]''. [[Lois McMaster Bujold]] uses her five Gods 'Father, Mother, Son, Daughter and Bastard' in ''[[The Curse of Chalion]]'' with an example of Hell as formless chaos. [[Michael Moorcock]] is one of many who offer Chaos-Evil-(Hell) and Uniformity-Good-(Heaven) as equally unacceptable extremes which must be held in balance; in particular in the ''[[Elric]]'' and ''[[The Eternal Champion (novel)|Eternal Champion]]'' series. [[Fredric Brown]] wrote a number of [[fantasy]] short stories about [[Satan]]'s activities in Hell. [[Cartoonist]] [[Jimmy Hatlo]] created a series of [[cartoon]]s about life in Hell called ''The Hatlo Inferno'', which ran from 1953 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg Sample ''Hatlo Inferno'' comic:] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415045157/http://www.cartoonbrew.com/archives/jimmyhatlo.jpg |date=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Early period of Islamic contact===
During the 8th century,the '''Kingdom of Kashmir''' was subjected to several attacks aimed at its conquest. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] conquered  Turkistan, Kabul, and Kashgar. Their conquests were further consolidated by the early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. In 751 C.E, Arabs gained victory over the Chinese and compelled them to abandon Gilgit and their other territories in the extreme west. Though these conquests brought Arabs within the vicinity of the Kingdom of Kashmir, no attempt was made at its invasion from the north.&lt;ref name=" History-A"&gt;{{cite book | author=Hasan, M.| title=Kashmir Under the Sultans| url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=EUlwmXjE9DQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| accessdate=14 November 2016 |year=1959| publisher=Aakar Books, 1959|ISBN=8187879491| pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, several attempts to conquer Kashmir were made by the Arabs who had established themselves in Sindh (711-13 C.E), under the leadership Muhammad bin Qasim. During the reign of Raja Chandrapida, Muhammad bin Qasim marched from Mutan to the borders of Kashmir kingdom. The Raja sent an envoy to the Chinese emperor asking for help against the Arabs, but, no aid was received. Muhammad bin Qasim was recalled by the Umayyad Caliph to Damascus, thus averting the possible invasion.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-B"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sen, S.N| title=Ancient Indian History and Civilization| url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA293&amp;lpg=PA293&amp;dq=Raja+Chandrapida+kashmir&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4-y82EvU7m&amp;sig=wSk_PyTkd9hqu0XwcYguNYFe1mY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwipp5fQt6jQAhUGiRoKHVv5AbwQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Raja%20Chandrapida%20kashmir&amp;f=false| accessdate=14 November 2016 |year=1999| publisher=New Age International, 1999|ISBN=8122411983| pages=293–294}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the reign of [[Hisham ibn Abd al-Malik|Caliph Hisham]] (724-43 C.E), the Arabs again marched towards Kashmir under the leadership of ambitious and energetic leadership of the governor Junaid. [[Lalitaditya Muktapida]] (724–60 CE), the Raja (ruler) of Kashmir, defeated Junaid and overran his kingdom. However, this victory was not decisive as further attempts to invade were made by the Arabs, but Lalitaditya was able to stem the tide of these advances.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt; A last attempt at the invasion of the Kashmir Kingdom was made by Hisham ibn 'Amr al-Taghlibi, the Governor of Sindh, appointed by [[Al-Mansur|Caliph Mansur]] (754-75 C.E). Though he reached as far as the southern slopes of the Himalayas, which were a part of the Kashmir Kingdom, he failed to enter, and occupy the valley.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;

After the Arabs, it was the [[Ghaznavids]] who attempted to conquer Kashmir. [[Mahmud of Ghazni]], known for his numerous invasions into India, defeated Raja [[Jayapala|Jaipal]] (1002 C.E), the ruler of Waihand (near Peshawar, in modernday Pakistan).&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-C"&gt;{{cite book | author=Jaques,T| title=Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: P-Z| url=https://books.google.ae/books?id=tW_eEVbVxpEC&amp;pg=PA1089&amp;dq=waihand&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz9Yys66jQAhVErRQKHQYsD4kQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=waihand&amp;f=false| accessdate=14 November 2016 |year=2007| publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007|ISBN=0313335397| page=1089}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Anandapala|Anandpal]], the son and successor of Jaipal, also suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Mahmud in 1009 C.E., and died a few years later. Anandpal's son Trilochanpala, whose power of influence was now confined only to the [[Salt Range]], appealed to Samgramaraja (1003-28 C.E), the king of Kashmir, for help against Mahmud. A large army contingent was sent by Samgramaraja, who joined Trilochanpala's forces, and won a battle against a reconnaissance party of Sultan Mahmud. Seeing this, Mahmud personally advanced for battle and defeated Trilochanpala in 1014 C.E. Provoked by Samgramaraja's conduct, Mahmud decided to invade Kashmir, and punish him. Mahmud advanced towards Kashmir and tried entering the kingdom via the Toshamaidan Pass. His progress was checked by the strong Loharkot Fort, which he besieged for a month. Owing to the heavy snowfall, which cut off Mahmud's communications, he was compelled to retreat.&lt;ref name="Spread of Islam in Kashmir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt; However, the Sultan again set out to invade Kashmir in September–October, 1021 C.E, but was again compelled to retreat due to bad weather conditions.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;

===Establishment of Muslim rule and conversion to Islam===
After Sultan Mahmud's attempted conquests, Kashmir remained generally unaffected by invasions that were aimed at the plains of India, up until 1320 C.E. The [[Lohara dynasty|Loharas]] (1003-1320 C.E.) ruled during this period, and was the last of the Hindu dynasties of Kashmir. In the spring of 1320, a Mongol chieftain by the name of Zulju, invaded Kashmir via the Jehlum Valley route. Suhadeva (1301–20 C.E), last ruler of the Loharas, tried to organize resistance, but failed due to his unpopularity among the masses. The reason for this unpopularity was financial exaction and general misrule that prevailed during the end period of the Lohara Dynasty.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt; Zulju's invasion created havoc and Suhadeva fled to [[Kistwar]]. [[Rinchan]]a, son of a Ladakhi chief, who was employed by Ramacandra (Prime Minister of Kashmir) to establish law and order, took advantage of the chaos. He got Ramacandra murdered, occupied the Kashmir throne by the end of the year 1320, and ruled until his death in 1323 C.E. In order to gain acceptance of Kashmiris, he married [[Kota Rani]], the daughter of Ramacandra, and made Rawancandra (Ramacandra's son) his commander in chief.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-D"&gt;{{cite book | author=Kaw, M.

He changed his name to Sultan Sardarudin Shah after converting to Islam, and thus became the first Muslim ruler of Kashmir.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt; Following the conversion of Rinchan, his commander in chief also became Muslim. The royal patronage for Islam won it new converts, and according to one source, many Kashmiris embraced the creed of Bulbul Shah.&lt;ref name="Spread of Islam in Kashmir"/&gt;&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;

The period after Sultan Sardarudin's death was marked by chaos and power tussle. Udayanadeva, the brother of Suhadeva, was made the ruler after an agreement among the nobles. However, he proved to be incompetent, and it was Kota Rani who was the virtual ruler. Soon after Udayanadeva's accession, a foreign chieftain attacked Kashmir, but the invaders were successfully repelled and defeated. However, the administration again fell into chaos. Udayanadeva had fled the country in sight of the attack, and lost his prestige in the eyes of the nobles. He died in the year 1338 C.E, and Kota Rani ascended the throne.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-D"/&gt; But, [[Shah Mir]], a nobleman employed earlier by Suhadeva, had other ambitions. A period of battle ensued between him and Kota Rani, and in 1339 C.E, Shah Mir captured the throne.&lt;ref name="History-A"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-D"/&gt;&lt;ref name=" History-E"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sufi, G.M.D.| title=Islamic culture in Kashmir| url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/islamic-culture-in-kashmir/oclc/5750806&amp;referer=brief_results| accessdate=15 November 2016 |year=1979| publisher=New Delhi : Light &amp; Life Publishers, 1979|OCLC= 5750806| pages=32–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shah Mir Dynasty|Shahmiri Dynasty]] (1339- 1561 C.E), founded by Sultan Shah Mir, ruled Kashmir for the next 222 years.

{{Islam by country}}
{{Ahmadiyya by country}}
'''[[Islam]]''' is a minority religion in the island nation [[Tuvalu]]. With the introduction of Islam in 1985 by [[Ahmadiyya|Ahmadi Muslims]], there are approximately 50 Muslims in the country, of which all are members of the Ahmadiyya movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Religious Diversity in Southeast Asia and the Pacific |author1=Gary D. Bouma |author2=Rodney Ling |author3=Douglas Pratt | page=198 | date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the country's small population, this represents 0.5% of Tuvalu. The Tuvalu Mosque, in [[Funafuti]], the capital of Tuvalu, is the only mosque in the country.

==History==
Islam was first introduced to the island nation by a [[British people|British]] Ahmadi Muslim of Pakistani descent, [[Iftikhar A. Ayaz]], who works as the British [[Consul (representative)|consular representative]] to Tuvalu Islands. In 1985, he came to Tuvalu, and in out of office hours, he endeavoured to introduce the Islamic faith to the local population. With several converts to the faith, Ayaz requested the headquarters of the Community in [[London]] to send a missionary to the Islands. As a result, Hafiz Jibrail, a [[Ghana]]ian missionary, who was already based in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] at the time, arrived in 1989, approximately four years after the introduction of Islam to the nation. However, in 1991 Hafiz Jibrail had to be transferred to the [[Kiribati]] Islands and thus was replaced by Abdul Ghaffar, another Ghanaian missionary to the Community. Nonetheless, having served the Islands for roughly 5 years, he returned to serve his home country, Ghana. After a lag of several years, during which the islands had no missionary, Abdul Hakeem Boateng, another Ghanaian missionary arrived in 2003, who served there until 2009. Since 2009, Muhammad Idris, an [[Indonesia]]n missionary to the Ahmadiyya Community, is now the current and first non-Ghanaian missionary to Tuvalu.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://ahmadiyyatuvalu.wordpress.com/about/ | title=Brief History of Ahmadiyya Muslim Tuvalu | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community translated the [[Quran]] into the [[Tuvaluan language]] in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.alislam.org/library/links/translations.html | title=List of Quran translations | accessdate=April 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tuvalu mosque, first constructed in 1991, is the only mosque in the Islands.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marshallislandsjournal.com/Archive%2010-28-11-page.html | title=Mosque soon to open in Uliga | date=November 28, 2011|accessdate=May 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Jabach Altarpiece''''' is an [[oil painting|oil]] on lime tree panel painting by German Renaissance artist [[Albrecht Dürer]], executed around 1503–1504. Originally a [[triptych]], only the side panels are now preserved: the right picture, measuring 96×54&amp;nbsp;cm, is housed in the [[Wallraf-Richartz Museum]] of [[Cologne]]; the left picture, measuring 96×51&amp;nbsp;cm, is housed in the [[Städel]] of [[Frankfurt]].

==History==
The altarpiece was probably commissioned by [[Frederick III, Elector of Saxony]], for a chapel in his castle at [[Wittenberg]], perhaps in occasion of the end of the plague in 1503.

The reconstruction of the work is disputed. Some art historians identify the central panel with the [[Uffizi]] [[Adoration of the Magi (Dürer)|''Adoration of the Magi'']], while according to others there was instead a group of sculptures.&lt;ref name = "Porcu"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Costantino Porcu |title=Dürer|publisher=Rizzoli|location=Milan|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Apostles'' on gilded background now at the [[Alte Pinakothek]] of Munich have also been associated with the [[polyptych]]: in this view, the two known paintings would form a single image on the external shutters once closed; in fact, the two share a common background, and the dress of Job's wife continues to the right panel as well.&lt;ref name = "Porcu"/&gt;

It is named after one of its owners, [[Everhard Jabach]], in whose family chapel it was still hanging in the late 18th century, before being split up and scattered to different locations.

|}

==Description==

The left panel depicts the prophet [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] seated, with a desperate expression on his face, after [[Satan]] has defied him to keep his allegiance to God even in the most tremendous afflictions. These include his flock getting scattered in the other panel, while his properties are on fire at the left edge. Further, his skin is covered by blisters, an appropriate element for a painting likely originated as an [[ex-voto]] for the end of plague. His wife, dressed in Renaissance garments, is pouring dirty water above him, while a small devil flees in the far background.&lt;ref name="Porcu"/&gt;

The right panel shows two standing musicians. The right one, with the drum, is perhaps a self-portrait. Their meaning has not been explained: they could be a further element of mockery against Job, or, instead, an attempt to console him through music.&lt;ref name="Porcu"/&gt;

(2001))&lt;/ref&gt; His conversion was motivated by his studies in [[Kabbalah]] and his disappointment following the failure of a prophecy spread by the Polish Sabbatean prophet Zadok of [[Grodno]], which predicted that [[Sabbatai Zevi]] would return in the year 1695/6,&lt;ref name=Dole&gt;Dole, George, F. "[http://www.baysidechurch.org/studia/studia.cfm?ArticleID=53&amp;VolumeID=25&amp;AuthorID=&amp;detail=1 Philosemitism in the Seventeenth Century]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}",''Studia Swedenborgiana'', Volume 7, No. 1, December 1990&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether he continued to observe Jewish practices after his conversion.

In March 1701 he was employed as a teacher of Rabbinic Hebrew at [[Uppsala University]] in Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;Eskhult, M. "Rabbi Kemper's Case for Christianity in his Matthew Commentary, with Reference to Exegesis" in T. L. Hettema, Arie van der Kooij. ''Religious Polemics in Context: Papers Presented to the Second International Conference of the Leiden Institute for the Study of Religions (Lisor) Held at Leiden, 27–28 April 2000''. Uitgeverij Van Gorcum, 2004. {{ISBN|90-232-4133-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death in 1716. Some scholars believe that he was [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]'s Hebrew tutor.&lt;ref name=Dole/&gt;

During his time at [[Uppsala]], he wrote his three-volume work on the ''[[Zohar]]'' entitled ''Matteh Moshe'' (''The Staff of Moses''), (1711).&lt;ref&gt;Schoeps, Hans-Joachim, trans. Dole, George F., ''Barocke Juden, Christen, Judenchristen,'' Bern: Francke Verlag, 1965, pp. 60-67&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he attempted to show that the ''Zohar'' contained the [[Christian]] doctrine of the [[Trinity]].&lt;ref name=Wolfson/&gt;

This belief also drove him to make a literal Hebrew translation of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] from Syriac (1703). He also wrote ''Me'irat 'Enayim'' (''The Enlightenment of the Eyes''), (1704) a [[Christian Kabbalah|Christian Cabala]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kabbalaonline.org/kabbalah/article_cdo/aid/380679/jewish/KABBALAH-CABALA-QABALAH.htm KABBALAH? CABALA? QABALAH?] from Jewish kabbalaonline.org&lt;/ref&gt; commentary on Matthew, which emphasized the unity of the Old and New Testaments and used elements from the Sabbatean and non-Sabbatean Kabbalistic traditions to derive Christian beliefs and meanings from traditional Jewish beliefs and practices.

In his commentary on polemical treatment of Christianity in rabbinical literature he was one of the first Lutherans to comment on the connection between the form of the name "Joshua" used for [[Jesus in the Talmud]], ''Yeshu'' instead of the normal ''Yeshua'' used for other figures, and connected the dropping of the final [[ayin]] with the ancient curse ''[[yimakh shemo]].''&lt;ref&gt;Mats Eskhult ''Rabbi Kemper's Case for Christianity in His Matthew Commentary, with Reference to Exegesis (per Mats Eskhult (Uppsala University) Hebrew Studies within Seventeenth Century Swedish Lutheranism) in ''Religious polemics in context: papers presented to the Second International Conference of the Leiden Institute for the Study of Religions (LISOR) '' ed. Theo L. Hettema, Arie van der Kooij - Page 161 2004 - "This is applied to Jesus: "It is easy to see that Jesus is spoken of," Kemper says, "and still today they mock him by rendering his name without 'ayin as Yeshu, ie, yimmah stud wezikro 'may his name and memory be wiped out."&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, Kemper's student Andreas Norrelius (1679–1749) translated the commentary into Latin as ''Illuminatio oculorum''   (''The Light of the Eyes''),(1749).

{{Banavasi Kadamba Kings Infobox}}
The '''Kadambas''' ([[Kannada]]: ಕದಂಬರು) (345–525 CE) were an ancient royal family of [[Karnataka]], India, that ruled northern Karnataka and the Konkan from [[Banavasi]] in present-day [[Uttara Kannada|Uttara Kannada district]]. At the peak of their power under King Kakuthsavarma, they ruled large parts of modern Karnataka state.

The dynasty was founded by [[Mayurasharma]] in 345 CE which at later times showed the potential of developing into imperial proportions, an indication to which is provided by the titles and epithets assumed by its rulers. He was the grand son of Veera Sharma and son of Bhandhu Shena. King Mayurasharma defeated the armies of the [[Pallavas of Kanchi]] possibly with help of some native tribes. The Kadamba fame reached its peak during the rule of [[Kakusthavarma]], a notable ruler with whom even the kings of [[Gupta Dynasty]] of northern India cultivated marital alliances. Tiring of the endless battles and bloodshed, one of the later descendants, King Shivakoti adopted Jainism. The Kadambas were contemporaries of the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] and together they formed the earliest native kingdoms to rule the land with absolute autonomy. The dynasty later continued to rule as a feudatory of larger Kannada empires, the [[Chalukya]] and the [[Rashtrakuta]] empires, for over five hundred years during which time they branched into minor dynasties known as the [[Kadambas of Goa]], [[Kadambas of Halasi]] and [[Kadambas of Hangal]].

During the pre-Kadamba era the ruling families that controlled the Karnataka region, the [[Mauryas]], and the [[Satavahanas]] were not natives of the region and the nucleus of power resided outside present-day Karnataka. The Kadambas were the first indigenous dynasty to use [[Kannada]], the language of the soil, at an administrative level. In the history of Karnataka, this era serves as a broad based historical starting point in the study of the development of region as an enduring geo-political entity and Kannada as an important regional language. Their legacy was so impressive that even the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagara]] rulers who fought the [[Deccan sultanates]] hired descendants of the Kadambas to manage their Goan military naval fleet.&lt;ref&gt;P. 48 ''Goa Today, Volume 17'' By Goa Publications, 1982 - Goa, Daman and Diu (India)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There is no shortage of myths about the origin of the Kadambas. According to one account the dynasty was founded by one ''Trilochana Kadamba'' also known from the [[Halasi|Halsi]] and [[Kamala Narayana Temple, Degaon (Degamve / Devgram)|Degamve]] records as ''Jayanta'' who had three eyes and four arms.&lt;ref name="jayanta"&gt;George M. Moraes (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p8&lt;/ref&gt; He was born out of the sweat of Shiva, which had fallen under a Kadamba tree and hence his name Kadamba.
According to another myth, [[Mayurasharma]] himself was born to Lord [[Shiva]] and mother earth and had three eyes.&lt;ref name="sweat"&gt;Yet another legend is that Mayurasarma was born to a sister of Jain Thirtankara Ananda Jinavritindra under a Kadamba tree. All these legends are from the records of the later [[Hangal]] Kadambas and Kadambas of [[Goa]], George M. Moraes (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p7&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the inscriptions of the Kadambas mention [[Murugan|Skanda]] and his ''Matrs'' (mothers). According to the Talagunda inscription, the founder Mayurasharma was anointed by ''the six-faced god of war'', that is Skanda or Kartikeya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Kadamba Kula: A History of Ancient and Mediaeval Karnataka|author=George M. Moraes|publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1995 - History - 504 pages|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Rise of Mahāsena: The Transformation of Skanda-Kārttikeya in North India from the Kuṣāṇa to Gupta Empires|author=Richard D. Mann|publisher=BRILL, 07-Dec-2011 - Religion - 296 pages|page=227}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Grama Paddhati'', a Kannada work dealing with the history of the Tulu Brahmanas, Mayurasharma was born to Lord Shiva and goddess [[Parvathi]] under a Kadamba tree in the [[Sahyadri mountain]]s and hence the name Kadamba. An inscription of the Nagarakhanda Kadambas, a later descendent dynasty, gives a legendary account and traces their lineage back to the [[Nanda Dynasty|Nandas]]. According to the inscription, King Nanda who had no heir prayed to Lord Shiva in the Kailash mountains when a heavenly voice advised him that two sons would be born to him, would bear the name of Kadamba ''Kula'' (family) and they should be instructed in the use of weapons.&lt;ref name="jayanta"/&gt;

There are two theories to the origin of the Kadamba dynasty, a native [[Kannadiga]] origin and the other a north Indian origin. Mention of the north Indian origin of the Kadambas are only found in their later records of their offshoot descendent dynasty and is considered legendary. The earliest record making this claim is the 1053 and 1055 inscriptions of Harikesari Deva which are copied in inscriptions thereafter, describing Mayurasharma as the progenitor of the kingdom who established his might on the summit of Mount Himavat. But this theory has not found popularity as there is no indication of this account in any of their early records.&lt;ref name="himavat"&gt;Royal families of the Deccan in the 11th century period often concocted northern origin theories according to George M. Moraes (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, the family derives its name from the Kadamba tree that is common only to the South India region.&lt;ref name="naga"&gt;George M. Moraes (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p.10&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians are divided on the issue of the [[caste]] of the Kadamba family, whether the founders of the kingdom belonged to the [[Brahmin]] caste as claimed by the [[Talagunda]] inscription, or were of tribal origin. A claim has been made that the Kadambas were none other than a tribe called the Kadambu, who were in conflict with the [[Chera Dynasty|Chera]] kingdom (of modern Kerala). The 'Kadambus' find mention in the [[Sangam literature]] as totemic worshippers of the Kadambu tree and the Hindu god [[Murugan|Subramanya]].&lt;ref name="sub"&gt;Chopra et al. (2003), p.161&lt;/ref&gt; While some historians have argued that they being of [[Brahmin]] descent made Mayurasharma's ancestors natives of northern India, the counter argument is that it was common for [[Dravidian peoples]] to be received into the Brahmanic caste during early and later medieval times. Being native Kannadigas, the Kadambas promptly gave administrative and political importance to their language, Kannada, after coming to power.&lt;ref name="hal"&gt;Sahitya Akademi (1988), p.1717&lt;/ref&gt; It is thus claimed that the family of the Kadambas were undoubtedly of [[Kanarese]] descent and may have been admitted into the Brahminical caste.&lt;ref name="brahminc"&gt;George M. Moraes (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p.11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rice"&gt;Kadambas were essentially Mysoreans (Rice 1897, pp.296, 335)&lt;/ref&gt; The Naga descent of the Kadambas has been stated in early inscriptions of King Krishna Varma I too, which confirms the family was from present day Karnataka.&lt;ref name="naga"/&gt;

Inscriptions in Sanskrit and Kannada are the main sources of the Kadamba history. The Talagunda, Gundanur, [[Chandravalli]], [[Halasi]] and [[Halmidi inscription]] are some of the important inscriptions that throw light on this ancient ruling family of Karnataka.&lt;ref name="light"&gt;Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), pp 30–39&lt;/ref&gt; They belonged to the ''Manavya Gotra'' and were ''Haritiputrās'' (lineage), which connects them to the native Chutus of [[Banavasi]], a feudatory of the [[Satavahana]] empire.&lt;ref name="gotra"&gt;Both the Talagunda and Gundanur inscriptions attest to this-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p30&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions of the Kadambas in Kannada and Sanskrit ascribed to the main dynasty and branch kingdoms have been published by historians.&lt;ref name="publish"&gt;

Kadambas were the first rulers to use [[Kannada language|Kannada]] as an additional official administrative language, as evidenced by the [[Halmidi inscription]] of 450.&lt;ref name="Oldest inscription"&gt;A report on Halmidi inscription, {{cite news|title=Halmidi village finally on the road to recognition |url=http://www.hindu.com/2003/11/03/stories/2003110304550500.htm|author=Muralidhara Khajane |publisher=The Hindu|work=The Hindu, Monday, November 3, 2003 |accessdate=2006-11-28 |location=Chennai, India |date=3 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oldest1"&gt;The Kadamba-Western Ganga Dynasty era is a momentous importance to Kannada language for it was with these rulers that Kannada language first gained official language status-K.V.

One of their earliest inscriptions, the Talagunda inscription of Santivarma (450) gives what may be the most possible cause for the emergence of the Kadamba kingdom. It states that Mayurasharma was a native of Talagunda, (in present-day [[Shimoga district]]) and his family got its name from the Kadamba tree that grew near his home.&lt;ref name="origin"&gt;According to Dr. B. L. Rice-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p30&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origin1"&gt;George M. Moares (1931), The Kadamba Kula, A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka, Asian Educational Services, 1990, p10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="origin3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kadambas of Banavasi|url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/deccan/kadamba.htm|author=Dr. Jyotsna Kamat|publisher=1996–2006 Kamat's Potpourri|work=|accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscription narrates how [[Mayurasharma]] proceeded to [[Kanchi]] in 345 along with his [[guru]] and grandfather Veerasarma to pursue his [[Vedas|Vedic]] studies at a Ghatika (school). There, owing to some misunderstanding between him and a [[Pallava]] guard or at an ''Ashvasanstha'' (a place of horse sacrifice), a quarrel arose in which Mayurasharma was humiliated. In high rage, the [[Brahmana]] discontinued his studies, left Kanchi, swearing vengeance on the impudent Pallavas, and took to arms. He collected a faithful group of followers and routed the Pallava armies near Srisilam region. After a prolonged period of low intensity warfare against the Pallavas and other smaller kings such as the Brihad-Banas of [[Kolar]] region, he proclaimed independence. Unable to contain him, the Pallavas had to accept his sovereignty.&lt;ref name="grass"&gt;The Talagunda inscription of 450 states that Mayurasharma was the progenitor of the kingdom. The inscription gives a graphic description of the happenings at Kanchi, "That the hand dextrous in grasping the Kusha (grass), fuel and stones, ladle, melted butter and the oblation vessel, unsheathed a flaming sword, eager to conquer the earth"-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), pp 30–31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="grass1"&gt;K.V. Ramesh, Chalukyas of Vatapi, 1984, Agam Kala Prakashan, p6&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in an act of righteous indignation was born the first native kingdom of Karnataka, the Pallava King Skandavarman condescending to recognise the growing might of the Kadambas south of the [[Malaprabha]] river as a sovereign power.&lt;ref name="malaprabha"&gt;K.V. Ramesh, Chalukyas of Vatapi, 1984, Agam Kala Prakashan, p3&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars such as Mores and Sastry opine that Mayurasharma availed himself of the confusion that was created by the invasion of Samudragupta who in his Allahabad Inscription claims to have defeated Vishnugopa of Kanchi. Taking advantage of the weakening of the Pallava power, Mayura appears to have succeeded in establishing a new kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;A CONCISE HISTORY OF KARNATAKA  By Dr.SURYANATH U.KAMATH, page 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Mayurasharma had to travel to distant [[Kanchi]] for Vedic studies gives an indication that Vedic lore was quite rudimentary in the region at that time. The recently discovered Gudnapur inscription states that Mauryasharma's grandfather and preceptor was Virasarma and his father Bandhushena developed the character of a Kshatriya.&lt;ref name="gudnapur"&gt;The inscription was discovered by Dr. B.R. Gopal, {{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Kadambas of Banavasi|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka10.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher=1998-00 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mayurasharma's successor was his son Kangavarma in 365 who had to fight the [[Vakataka]] might to protect ''Kuntala''. He was defeated by Vakataka Prithvisena but managed to maintain his freedom.&lt;ref name="vakataka"&gt;According to Prof. Jouveau-Dubreuil-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p32&lt;/ref&gt;
His son Bhagiratha is said to have retrieved his fathers losses but Vakataka inscriptions do not attest to this.&lt;ref name="sagara"&gt;The Talagunda inscription describes Bhagiratha as the sole lord of the Kadamba land and the great ''Sagara'' himself, indicating he may have retrieved their losses against the Vakatakas-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p32&lt;/ref&gt; His son Raghu died fighting the [[Pallavas]]. He was succeeded by his brother Kakusthavarma who was the most powerful ruler of the dynasty.&lt;ref name="Kakusthavarma"&gt;According to Dr. G. M. Moraes who wrote ''Kadamba Kula: A History of Ancient and Medieval Karnataka'', under the rule Kakusthavarma, the kingdom reached its acme of success and the Talagunda record calls him the ornament of the family, the [[Halsi]] and [[Halmidi]] inscriptions also hold him in high esteem-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p32&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained marital relations with even the imperial Guptas of the north, according to the Talagunda inscription. One of his daughters was married to Kumara Gupta's son Skanda Gupta. His other daughter was married to a Vakataka king Narendrasena.&lt;ref name="daughter"&gt;According to Dr. P.B. Desai and the Balaghat inscription of Vakataka Pritvisena-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p33&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained similar relations with the Bhatari, the [[Alupas]] of South Canara and the [[Western Ganga Dynasty]] of Gangavadi according to the Talagunda inscription. The great poet [[Kalidasa]] had visited his court.&lt;ref name="kalidasa"&gt;The Sanskrit work ''Auchitya Vichara'' by Kshemendra quotes certain portions of a work by great Poet [[Kalidasa]] called ''Kunthalesvara Dautya'' which discusses his visit to the Kadamba court. Apparently, the Kadamba did not offer the poet a seat to sit on and Kalidasa had to sit on the ground, indicating the Kadambas treated the ambassador from the Gupta kingdom with scant respect. This is also verified from a Sanskrit work by Bhoja called ''Shringara Prakasika'' which mentions a Gupta ambassador being sent to the court of Kuntala. While Dr. Moraes opines the ambassador went during the time of Kadamba king Bhagiratha, Dr. P.B. Desai, R.S. Panchamukhi feel it was during the rule of king Kakusthavarma-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p33&lt;/ref&gt;

After Kakusthavarma only Ravivarma who came to the throne in 485 was able to build upon the kingdom. His rule was marked by a series of clashes within the family, and also against the [[Pallavas]] and the [[Gangas]]. He is also credited with a victory against the [[Vakatakas]], which helped extend his Kingdom as far north as the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]]. The crux of their kingdom essentially consisted of large areas of [[Karnataka]], [[Goa]] and southern areas of present-day [[Maharashtra]]. After his death, the kingdom went into decline due to family feuds. The Birur plates of Kadamba Vishnuvarman call Shantivarman "The master of the entire Karnataka region". The Triparvatha branch that broke away in 455 ruled from Murod in [[Belagavi]] for some time and merged with the main [[Banavasi]] kingdom during rule of Harivarma. Finally the kingdom fell to the power of the Badami Chalukyas. The Kadambas thereafter became feudatories of the Badami Chalukyas and later the Rashtrakutas and Kalyani Chalukyas. The successors of Mayurasharma took to the name "varma" to indicate their Kshatriya status.

==Coins==
Kadamba coins were one the heaviest and perhaps purest of all medieval Indian gold coinage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nupam.com/postg1.html|title=The Kadambas of Hangal|publisher=|accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They issued 2 types of gold coins, those which were punch-marked and others which were die-struck. During 1075-1094 CE, Shanti Varma, issued gold punch-marked coins and in 1065 CE, Toyimadeva, issued die-struck gold coins.

''Punch-marked gold coins''

* Kadamba punch-marked gold coin issued in name of ''Jaysimha II'' Jagadekamalla ([[Chalukya]]).
* Coin consists of a central punch mark of [[Hanuman]], and 4 retrospectant lions.
* 2 prominent punch marks create 2 Shri alphabets depicts goddess Laxmi in Kadamba script [[Kannada]] script.

''Die struck gold coins ([[Pagoda (coin)|Pagoda]])''

* In 1065 AD [[Kadambas]] ''Toyimadeva'' issued ''first die struck gold coins''.
* The gold coin of Kadambas depict god [[Hanuman]], inside lined circle and dotted circle, flanked by two chouries and conch. Also include the figures of sun and moon. Below is the legend Nakara (Nagara, the deity of [[Bankapura]], Nagareshwara) in [[Kannada]] script.

They have been definitively attributed to the Kadambas because they not only have various Kadamba symbols, such as conches and chakras, but one of the epithets on the coins, ''sri dosharashi'', is known from inscriptions to have been used by the Kadamba king Krishnavarma II (ruled 516–540).&lt;ref&gt;K. Ganesh: ''Coins of Banavasi'', Bangalore, March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other coins with the legend ''sri manarashi'' were also found, along with anepigraphic coins (that is, coins without any legends) featuring flowers, ''chakras'', and conches. The lotus, ''chakra'' (discus), and conch are all symbols of the god [[Vishnu]]. Kadamba inscriptions frequently invoke Vishnu, indicating they must have been devotees of this deity. The identity of the king named ''sri manarashi'' has still not been determined.

The coins are perhaps the earliest ones to use [[Kannada]] letters, a confirmation that the Kadambas were the first ruling dynasty native to Karnataka.

== Kadamba Coins and the earliest Kannada inscription ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}

The [[Halmidi inscription]] was the earliest known epigraph that showed the early usage of [[Kannada script]] ([[Kadamba script]]). The stone inscription found at Halmidi has been assigned to C. 450 CE. and belongs to Kadamba ruler ''Kakusthavarma'', whose reign is estimated to be between 435 CE to 455 CE.

In the year 2006, the Jalagars, the sand sievers family, from Tamil Nadu, yielded around 6 Kannada inscribed potin coins from the riverbed of Varada in Sirsi Taluk, which is in Uttara Kannada district.  The legends could not be satisfactorily deciphered by Sri MM Prabhu of Mangalore due to the poor chipped condition of coins, and was read Sri Manaragi. Later, when more coins came to limelight, the next year, he managed to attribute it to the [[Kadambas|Kadambas of Banavasi]]. The Banavasi village, which is {{convert|22|mi|km}} away from the Sirsi town was the ancient capital of the Kadambas of Banavasi. Banavasi was also known as "Jaldurga" in the ''[[Aihole inscriptions|Aihole inscription]] of [[Pulakeshin II]]''. The Varada river encompassed the Banavasi town in all the four directions to form a natural water port and hence the name Jal (water) durga (port).

For the next two years (2007–2008), the Jalagars made a headway and yielded Satavahana Potin coins bearing Elephant/quadri-directional symbol in quantity above 5000 pieecs along with few hundreds of Kura Potin coins bearing Bull/Bow-and-Arrow symbols. Most of the elephant Satavahana coins were of rulers Siri, Satakarni and Pudumavi. The Satavahaha fractions of up to 50&amp;nbsp;mg weight, with similar elephant motiff and illegible legend were also obtained. The Bull/Discus Potin coins were issued mainly by Rajno Vishnurudra though other rulers name such as Vishnurudra Putra, Vasithi Putra, Satakarni etc. exist.  Third of the series, the inscribed Kadamba Potin coins were found too, but in small quantities, estimated to be around 100 pieces with four unique legend types. Only the coins bearing the legend Sri-Manarashi and Sr-Dhosharashi have been published yet. There exist around 10 die variations of the same. Other coins such as Bull/Trident-Goad coins in bell metal of tetradrachm standard bearing legend Vinukhata Brahmananda were found in 5 to 6 numbers, Copper and Lead coins of Chutukulananda, Mulananda and Sivalananda etc. are seen seldom in those river beds but in too lesser numbers. Copper coins of Chutus were not known hitherto. Since Banavasi was an important religious site of sanctity, the site attracted old-age piigrims from distant places who spent their last days in the holy site. They offered coins such as Guptas, Kushan, Roman, Western Kshatrapas, Vijayanagaras and Hoysalas etc., which stands evidence to this.

As far as the chronology of these Banavasi Kadamba coins concerned, Sri-Dhosharashi coins follow Sri-Manarashi coins as evidenced by the script style. Since Dhosharashi epithet was adorned by Ravivarma, the Manarashi coins are either issued by the predecessors Shanthivarma or Mrigeshavarma. This is understood by the script style of Manarashi coins that resembled more that of Halmidi inscription. Moreover, Halmidi inscription is assigned to Kakkushthavarman. These potin coins are observed in varied weights such as 200&amp;nbsp;mg to 400&amp;nbsp;mg stanadard. The fractional coins weighed around 100&amp;nbsp;mg and contained religious symbols such as Discus, Conch and Lotus, which are the icons of Lord Vishnu.

Their [[Talagunda pillar inscription|Talagunda inscription]] had an invocation of Lord Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions started with an invocation of Lord Vishnu. Moreover, their temple, the Madukeshwara, also seem to have undergone several changes over a period. The initial statue is believed to be of Lord Vishnu while Siva Linga is currently worshipped. Another tale about this place involves the slaying of demon Madhu by Lord Vishnu at the behest of Lord Shiva. This tale is mentioned in the Puranas. So, the religious symbol such as Conch, Discuss and Lotus only signifies the fractional value of coin, which is seen evenin the Hanas and Hagas of the Alupas and Gangas, who were the contemporaries and also in time, the feudatories of the Kadambas of Banavasi.

It is impressive to see the shift of script usage to Kannada, from the Satavahana Brahmi. Satavahana Brahmi was used by the Chutus, Satavahanas and the Kuras respectively as the official script. It is quite possible that Kannada was in use prior to the rule of the Chutus but Brahmi was the script. The usage of Kannada script in coins and inscriptions is the gift of the Kadambas and trend continued in the whole of then Karnataka.  The stone tablets recently found in Parkala, Udupi taluk, attests the usage of Kannada around the same period (5th century CE).

==Administration==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2011}}
The Kadamba kings called themselves ''Dharmamaharajas'' like the [[Satavahana]] kings. Dr. Mores has identified various cabinet and other positions in the kingdom from inscriptions. The prime minister (''Pradhana''), Steward (''Manevergade''), secretary of council (''Tantrapala'' or ''Sabhakarya Sachiva''), scholarly elders (''Vidyavriddhas''), physician (''Deshamatya''), private secretary (''Rahasyadhikritha''), chief secretary (''Sarvakaryakarta''), chief justice (''Dharmadhyaksha'') and other officials (''Bhojaka'' and ''Ayukta''). The army consisted of officers like ''Jagadala'', ''Dandanayaka'' and ''Senapathi''.

A crown prince from the royal family helped the king in administration. Princesses of the royal family were appointed as governors of various provinces. King Kakusthavarma had appointed his son Krishna as viceroy of Thriparvatha region. This later proved detrimental to the kingdom as it gave opportunity for break away factions in the kingdom.&lt;br/&gt;
The kingdom was divided into ''Mandalas'' (provinces) or ''Desha''. Under a ''Mandala'' was ''Vishayas'' (districts). A total of nine ''Vishaya'' have been identified.&lt;ref name="vishaya"&gt;Prof. R.S. Panchamukhi has identified nine such Vishaya like the Sendraka Vishaya, Tagare Vishaya etc-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), p35&lt;/ref&gt; Under a ''Vishaya'' were ''Mahagramas'' (Taluk) and ''Dashagramas'' (Hobli). ''Mahagrama'' had more villages than ''Dashagramas''. One sixth of land produce was collected as tax. Taxes were collected as ''Perjunka'' (levy on load), ''Vaddaravula'' (social security tax for royal family), ''Bilkoda'' (sales tax), ''Kirukula'' (land tax), ''Pannaya'' (betel tax) and other professional taxes on traders etc.

==Culture==

===Religious condition===
The Kadambas were followers of Vedic Hinduism. The founder, [[Mayurasharma]] was a [[Brahmin]] by birth but later his successors changed their surname to ''Varma'' to indicate their [[Kshatriya]] status but they used to marry [[brahmins]] only. Some Kadamba kings like Krishna Varma performed the ''[[Ashwamedha]]'' (horse sacrifice). Their Talagunda inscription starts with an invocation of Lord Shiva while the Halmidi and Banavasi inscriptions start with an invocation of Lord Vishnu. They built the Madhukesvara temple which is considered their family deity. Many records like the Kudalur, Sirsi records speak of grants made by them to scholarly Brahmins. Grants were also made to Buddhist viharas.

The Kadambas also patronised [[Jainism]]; several of the latter kings adopted the religion, and built numerous Jain ''Basadis'' (temples) that are scattered around [[Banavasi]], [[Belagavi]], [[Mangaluru]] and [[Goa]]. Kings and Queens of the dynasty were renowned for their support of literature, arts and liberal grants to temples and educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=BMdU2Kj9RHcC|title=Goa: A Daughter'S Story|first=Maria Aurora|last=Couto|publisher=Penguin UK|date=2005|isbn=9789351180951|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several descendants are scattered around present day Goa, [[Belagavi]], [[Mangaluru]] and [[Bengaluru]].
[[Adikavi Pampa]] highly spoke of this kingdom in his writings. Following are his famous quotes on [[Banavasi]]: ''Aaramkushamittodam nenevudenna manam banavasi deshamam'' (''I shall cherish the sweet memories of Banavasi even when tortured''), ''Maridumbiyagi mEN Kogileyagi puttuvudu nandanadol Banavasi deshadol'' (''As a bee or as nightingale should one born here in this beautiful country of Banavasi'').&lt;ref name="pampa"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Karnataka-Kadambas of Banavasi|url=http://www.ourkarnataka.com/states/history/historyofkarnataka10.htm|author=Arthikaje, Mangalore|publisher= 1998-00 OurKarnataka.Com, Inc|work=|accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architecture===

{{main|Kadamba architecture}}
The contribution of the Kadambas to the architectural heritage of Karnataka is certainly worthy of recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient City of Banavasi |url=http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/archaeology/banavasi.htm|author=Dr. Jyotsna Kamat
|publisher=Kamat's Potpourri|work=1996–2006 Kamat's Potpourri|accessdate=2006-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kadamba style can be identified and that it has a few things in common with the [[Chalukya]] and the [[Pallava]] styles. The most prominent feature of their architecture, basic as it was is their ''Shikara'' called ''Kadamba Shikara''. The ''Shikara'' is pyramid shaped and rises in steps without any decoration with a ''Stupika'' or ''Kalasha'' at the top. This style of ''Shikara'' are used several centuries later in the [[Doddagaddavalli]] [[Hoysala]] temple and the Mahakuta temples in [[Hampi]]. Some of their temples also use perforated screen windows. It has also been pointed out that in architecture and sculpture, the Kadambas contributed to the foundation of the later Chalukya-Hoysala style.&lt;ref name="architecture"&gt;Dr. G. M. Moraes opines that apart from using some unique features, the Kadambas used many mixed styles in their architecture derived from their predecessors and overlords. The Kadambas were the originators of the Karnataka architecture-Dr. Suryanath U. Kamath, A Concise history of Karnataka from pre-historic times to the present, Jupiter books, 2001, MCC, Bangalore (Reprint 2002), pp 37–38&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The ''Madhukeshwara'' (Lord [[Shiva]]) temple built by them still exists in [[Banavasi]]. Built in the 10th century and renovated many times, the temple is a very good piece of art. The stone cot with wonderful carvings is one of the main tourist attractions in the temple.

===Impact===
''Kadambotsava'' ("The festival of Kadamba") a festival is celebrated every year by Government of Karnataka in honour of this kingdom.&lt;ref name="kadambotsava"&gt;''Kadambotsava'' is held at Banavasi as it is here that the Kadamba kings organised the spring festival every year. {{cite news|title=Kadambotsava in Banavasi from today |url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/01/20/stories/2006012003990300.htm|author=Staff Correspondent|publisher=The Hindu|work=The Hindu, Friday, January 20, 2006 |accessdate=2006-11-28|location=Chennai, India|date=20 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular Kannada film, ''[[Mayura (film)|Mayura]]'' starring Dr. [[Rajkumar (actor)|Raj Kumar]]  based on a novel of the same name by [[Devudu Narasimha Sastri]] celebrates the creation of the first Kannada kingdom.

On 31 May 2005 Defence minister Pranab Mukherjee commissioned India's most advanced and first dedicated military naval base named INS Kadamba after the Kadamba dynasty, in [[Karwar]].&lt;ref name="INS"&gt;Defense Minister Pranab Mukherjee opened the first phase of India's giant western naval base INS Kadamba in [[Karwar]], Karnataka state, on 31 May. {{cite web|title=India Opens Major Naval Base at Karwar|url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/india-opens-major-naval-base-at-karwar-0647/|work=Defence Industry Daily|date=21 May 2012|accessdate=2013-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early Years ==

From a young age, Karen had an awareness of the constant presence of God. Her first extraordinary experience was at ten years of age, when she was flung into a construction pit by children at her school. During those lonely dark hours, she was visited by the Angel Michael who told her she would be saved, and that every difficulty she experiences is part of a larger plan for her life. From that moment on, Karen continued to find spirituality in all things.  

Karen was a medium by the age of 21. In 1972, after a series of synchronistic events and a chance meetings, Karen married Rav Berg. When they married, they didn’t just marry each other, they married two worlds—Karen’s world, spirituality and the mystical arts, and the Rav’s, the rites and rituals of a traditional orthodox religious practice. 

Although Kabbalah was intended for use and study by all of humankind, until their chance meeting, the wisdom of Kabbalah had been a closely guarded, perplexing study reserved for religious male scholars.

In the face of persecution and constant obstacles, Karen successfully defied thousands of years of “religious” tradition and restrictions, opening the doors for women to study Kabbalah, as well as for all people, at all levels of study. 


== Career ==
Born Karen Mulnich,&lt;ref name=faith/&gt; Berg grew up in a Jewish family, but was not around orthodox Jews until she worked at an insurance office based in New York where she met Philip Berg. She and Philip Berg later married in 1971. The couple moved to Jerusalem with Karen Berg's two daughters from a previous marriage, and had two sons, Yehuda and Michael, born in 1972 and 1973. Philip began teaching Kabbalah with Berg supporting him. They set up The Research Centre of Kabbalah in Tel Aviv. After living there for 12 years, they moved to Richmond Hill in Queens. Berg suggested opening a school so that all people could learn Kabbalah. Their house became the first American location of the Kabbalah Centre.&lt;ref name=LA/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt;&lt;ref name=yoga/&gt; The Bergs later moved to Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name=jpost/&gt;

In 2005, Berg wrote ''God Wears Lipstick: Kabbalah for Women''.&lt;ref name=LA/&gt;&lt;ref name=jpost2/&gt; The book covers ancient Kabalistic wisdom in a contemporary and practical way.&lt;ref name=yogi/&gt; She also wrote ''Simple Light, Wisdom from a Woman's Heart'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=huff/&gt; 

Berg founded The Kabbalah Centre Charitable Foundation, Spirituality for Kids, an online program that works to help at-risk kids and teens.

As the Founder of The Kabbalah Centre, Karen Berg is devoted to an enduring vision— within each person is a spark of God that can be bound together to create transcendence beyond all differences. Karen is certain that peace is possible, and foresees a world free of hatred and intolerance. She works untiringly to cultivate a new paradigm of Global Spirituality through which people from diverse beliefs and no belief can work together to bring the world to a better place through mutual respect, dignity, and love for humanity. 

== Today ==

Following Rav Berg’s passing in 2013, Karen continues to passionately lead and nurture the Kabbalah Centres around the world. She has expanded her efforts to bring peace to the world through spiritual unity and travels extensively. Karen meets with people daily, both personally and online, serving a worldwide community of over 300,000 souls.

To this end Karen has:

* Founded the international children’s program Spirituality for Kids, an online children’s educational program that supports children to find the spark of Light within themselves, within others, and within all things.  
* Founded Kids Creating Peace (KCP), a program designed to help children discover for themselves a place of peaceful coexistence in the Middle East. For the International Day of Peace in 2010, teenage KCP participants were invited to make a presentation on behalf of peace in the Middle East to the French National Assembly. In 2014, teenage KCP representatives attended the United Nations Youth Assembly at the UN in New York City where Karen gave the keynote address. 
* Discussed human dignity and peace with many spiritual leaders including: the Dalai Lama; Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, founder of the Art of Living Centres; Imam Mohammed Ali Elahi, spiritual leader of the Islamic House of Wisdom; Michael Bernard Beckwith, founder and CEO of the Agape Centre International; Bawa Jain, Secretary-General of the Millennium World Council of Religious Leaders; Mabel Katz, authority on the ancient Hawaiian healing method, Ho’oponopono; and Ilchi Lee, founder and developer of Brain Education and Dahn Yoga. Karen has also spoken with political and thought leaders including: President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian National Authority; Hilary Rantisi, director of the Middle East Initiative at Harvard University; Governor Cesar Duarte of Chihuahua, Mexico; and First Lady of Mexico Anjelica Rivera. In London in 2011, Karen spoke alongside Dr. Jehan Sadat, human rights activist and widow of former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, and later that year, hosted an event in honor of International Women’s Day with Ibtisam Mahameed, co-founder of the Women’s Interfaith Encounter, and Professor Galia Sabar, chair of African Studies at Tel Aviv University, both recipients of the Dalai Lama Peace Prize.


Karen has four children, sixteen grandchildren, and considers everywhere there is a Kabbalah Centre her home.

:''Keśava  may also refer to: the grammarian [[Kesiraja]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Krishna with a flute.jpg|right|thumb|Krishna]] --&gt;
'''Keshava''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{lang|sa|केशव}} ''{{IAST|keśava}}'') is a name of [[Vishnu]] from the [[Hindu]] tradition. The name appears as the 23rd and 648th names in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]] of the [[Mahabharata]].  Keshava is venerated by those persons wanting to avert bad luck, or ill omens. His consort is Keerti.&lt;ref&gt;''The Illustrated Dictionary of Hindu Iconography'', Margaret Stutley, p.71, 73&lt;/ref&gt;

== Scriptural references ==
=== Vishnu Sahasranama ===
According to [[Adi Sankara]]'s commentary on the [[Vishnu sahasranama]], "Keshava" has the following meanings: 
* One whose kesa or hair is long, uncut and beautiful
* The lord of creation, preservation, and dissolution
* One who destroyed the demon [[Keshi (demon)|Keshi]] in the [[Krishna]] avatar
* One who is endowed with the rays of light spreading within the orbit of the sun
* One who is himself the three: kah [[Brahma]]; ah [[Vishnu]] and Isa [[Shiva]]

=== Padma Purana ===
*The one with beautiful long (unshorn) hair
According to the [[Padma Purana]] the name refers to Krishna's long, beautiful looking unshorn hair.

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
*Killer of the Keśī demon
In the [[Bhagavad Gita]] [[Arjuna]] uses the name Keshava&lt;ref&gt;Maharishi Mahesh Yogi on the Bhagavad-Gita, a New Translation and Commentary, Chapter 1-6. Penguin Books, 1969, p 148-149 (v 54)&lt;/ref&gt; for Krishna a number of times, referring to him as the 'Killer of the [[Keshi (demon)|Keshi]] demon': "I am now unable to stand here any longer. I am forgetting myself, and my mind is reeling. I see only causes of misfortune, O Kesava, killer of the Keśī demon." (Bhagavad Gita 1.30). The demon Keshi, in the form of a horse, was sent by [[Kamsa]] to kill Krishna but was overpowered and slain (Vishnu Purana 5.15-16).

'''Lampadomancy''' is a form of [[divination]] using a single [[oil lamp]] or a [[torch]] flame.

As with [[Lychnoscopy]], the [[diviner]] reads presages from the movements of the [[flame]]. An alternate method is also practiced, consisting of reading the spots of [[carbon]] deposited on [[paper]] sheets held over the flame.  In yet another method, the diviner uses the lamp as a means of "attracting [[spirit]]s to the flames", in the hope of consulting them regarding future events. In this method, usually a specially designed lamp is employed, on the belief that [[grotesque]] forms will attract the spirits.

[[Lychnomancy]] is a related form of divination with flames of three identical candles arranged in a triangle.

Lampadomancy was a popular method of divination in ancient [[Egypt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''''Macumba''''' ({{IPA-pt|maˈkũᵐbɐ}}) is a word that has a dual meaning. It can be used when describing a musical instrument or a form of witchcraft (or magic). Before it was used for a single religion Macumba was originally used to categorize all religions who practiced or believed in animistic-syncretism during the 1800s. In the 1900s Macumba became a [[slang]] term among Brazilians who aren’t affiliated with these religions. The religions that are refereed to under the umbrella term Macumba are Candomblé, Giro, and Mesa Blanca.

Brazilian Macumba is the name that was used to designate all [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] religious practices, mainly in the Brazilian state of [[Bahia]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hayes|first=Kelly E.|chapter=Black Magic and the Academy: Macumba and Afro-Brazilian "Orthodoxies"|title=History of Religions|url=|lengua=|publisher= |date=2007|pages=283–31|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later (in the 20th century), these practices were organized in what is now called [[Umbanda]], [[Quimbanda]] and [[Omoloko]]. Macumba became common in parts of [[Brazil]], [[Uruguay]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Argentina]]. This word is used by some people as a pejorative word meaning [[black magic]]. The word macumba is used in Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay, to refer to any ritual or [[religion]] of [[Afro-American religion|Afro-American]] origin, and although its use by outsiders is usually derogatory (referring to all kinds of religion, superstitions and rituals related with luck) and it is considered offensive, among its practitioners it is not seen negatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religion.idoneos.com/religiones/sincretismo/macumba/ www.religion.idoneos.com/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Despacho of quimbanda in Itacorubi cemetery.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A black hen sacrifice as a Quimbanda ritual in a graveyard in Florianopolis, Brazil]]
Macumba is practiced in [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]]. There appears to be a relationship with the concept of the [[Boto]] (the fresh-water [[porpoise]] found in the [[Amazonas River]] and its tributaries) having shape-shifting abilities and then while in the form of a human male having sexual relations with young women. This belief was noted in several Indigenous American villages along the Amazonas (Solimões) River, Rio Negro, and [[Rio Japurá]].

Macumba is widely practiced throughout the [[Southern Cone]]. Many practitioners continue to practice their traditional religions (Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc.) but also practice Macumba, often in violation of the tenets of their official religious affiliations but which their social environment appears to quietly accept.

Some practitioners purport to use Macumba to inflict harm, financial failure, illness, death, etc. on other people for various reasons. Commonly, a Macumba spiritual leader will ask for a picture of the person on whom retribution is sought, with the name of the person written on the back of the picture. This kind of practice is often seen as sorcery or black magic.

==Practices==
Out of all the religions grouped into Macumba only followers of Candomblé sacrifice animals during their rituals. Animals are also sacrificed during Consultas. In Candomblé blood is a very sacred and symbolic item and is used as often as possible. Blood to these followers represents life pure essence and a bond that unites them all together as family.

Giro on the other hand use palm tree oil (azeite de dendé) in their rituals, this is because using blood has formed a negative stigma around Candomblé as many people associate animal sacrifice with savagery and see it as backwards. This dependence on blood and animal sacrifice has led to a loss of converts and a stigma to form around Candomblé and its followers. Since dendé is a similar hue to blood it works well as a replacement in many rituals that would require it. This also allows followers of Giro to practice without fear of being stigmatized.

Mesa Blanca on the other hand believes that blood and dendé can bring evil and misfortune on those who dare to use it in rituals. Dendé for example is linked to aggressive spirits of slaves, as well as other evils that the group has shunned and removed from their practices. The movement away from these two mediums can be seen as a way to distance themselves from Afro-Brazilian religions and the Macumba itself.

Honey is also important to these religions as it represents the spirits of Native Indians, the use of honey can be for healing as well as reconciliation. Honey is an entirely different color than blood and Dendé so it is not associated with the evils of first two liquids.

Water is the final liquid and is the main symbol for most religions other than Candomblé (which is blood). Water can be used to gaze into during consultas as it is believed looking into water can help attain wisdom or information. Water symbolizes life as it has the ability to heal but it can also represent the ability to avoid death.

==Hierarchy==
The hierarchy of many of these religions is family based and can be seen by the addressing of leaders in Candomblé as "mother" and "father". Also many leaders of these religions are female as a mother figure is needed.

The cult of '''Maria Santissima della Confusione''' began in the province of [[Trapani]], and from here itt spread in the near province of [[Palermo]].&lt;ref name=bisco&gt;http://biscobreak.altervista.org/2015/08/madonna-della-confusione/&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chiesa_di_Sant'Anna_(Alcamo)_04.jpg|thumb|Madonna della Confusione, [[Church of Saint Anne (Alcamo)|chiesa di Sant'Anna (Alcamo)]]]]

== Origin of the name ==
Maria Santissima della Confusione,  that is venerated by the [[Friars Minor Capuchin]] of  [[Salemi]], is a wonderful painting realized in the 18th century by fra Felice da Sambuca; it is represented a [[Madonna (art)|Madonna]] in tears, with the symbols of the [[Passion of Jesus]] (the [[spear]], the sponge with [[vinegar]], the nails and the column of [[Jesus]]’ [[flagellation]])  around her.&lt;ref name="bisco"/&gt;

The  title Madonna della Confusione, referred to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]],  expresses the state of consternation, of confusion, that seizes a person when he is the victim of a strong pain. Maria, a [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciple]] of Jesus until his death,  shows u show a mother remains confused, that is afflicted and at a loss, faced with the painful death of a son.&lt;ref name="bisco"/&gt;

The  term Confused derives from the [[Latin]] ''cum'' and ''fixus'', then with-fixed,  hanged with, but also from ''cum-flictus'', con-flicted,  from which the derivation of the term afflicted, that is  ''confitto'',  as a person beaten vigorously, put on the cross with violence, together his Son. Even in this she identifies herself with Jesus, as she merges with Him, ''cum-fusio'', and for this reason she suffers with Him and climbs on the [[Cross]], (juxta crucem lacrimosa, in the  [[Stabat Mater]] of  [[Jacopone da Todi]]).

Man turns to Her in every moment of confusion, because She is the [[Mediator Dei|mediator]] between [[God]] and us, through her Son, and can help us in the difficulties of life.

== Devotion ==
It has started and spread, above all, in the friaries of [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]]s.&lt;ref name="bisco"/&gt;

In [[Salemi]] the feast has taken place on the last Sunday of August for about three centuries:  they carry the magnificent painting of ''Madonna della Confusione'' in [[procession]] along the town streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/08/21/la-madonna-della-confusione-che-protegge-il.html&lt;/ref&gt; Even if she is not the [[Patroness saint|patroness]] of Salemi, she is much venerated by people.
The devotion to this Madonna is also very profound in [[Marsala]], in the convent and in the Church of the Capuchins dedicated to Madonna della Confusione; the image of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]]  with her head  bent a little on the right, fingers crossed and eyes narrowed; in front of her, on a small table, there are the [[nail (relic)|nail]]s of [[crucifixion]]&lt;ref name="ague"&gt;Salvatore Agueci: La Devozione alla Madonna della Confusione, con prefazione di Mons.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Partanna]], in the small Church dedicated to Saint [[Andrew the Apostle]], next to the friary of Capuchins, there was a valuable painting of Madonna della Confusione which was stolen after that [[1968 Belice earthquake]]  had damaged the small Church.  The image was similar to the other [[icons]]: [[Marian shrines|Our Lady]] has the head bent on the left, fingers crossed on her chest and a mantle dropping down.&lt;ref name="ague"/&gt;

In [[Alcamo]], in the [[Church of Saint Anne (Alcamo)|Church of Saint Anne]], there is a painting on canvas dated 1916, made by Leonardo Mirabile from Alcamo, representing Maria Santissima della Confusione.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trapaninostra.it/libri/carlo_cataldo/Splendori_della_memoria/Splendori_della_memoria-04.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  This picture is a copy of a painting made by [[Giuseppe Renda]], dedicated to  [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], which was kept in the [[Church of Saint Mary of Jesus]], and stolen in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;Carlo Cataldo, Guida storico-artistica dei beni culturali di Alcamo-Calatafimi-Castellammare del Golfo, Alcamo, Sarograf, 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also icons of Madonna della Confusione in the monasteries and ex monasteries of Capuchins of [[Erice]], [[Mazara del Vallo]], [[Trapani]]. In the [[province of Palermo]]: at [[Giuliana]] and at ''Palermo Boccadifalco'', where the cult rose as the patron saint of pregnant women&lt;ref name="ague" /&gt;.

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Culture}}

In [[Judaism]], a '''''minyan''''' ({{lang-he-n|מִנְיָן}} {{IPA-he|minˈjan|}} [[Literal translation|lit.]] noun ''count, number''; pl. {{Hebrew|מִניָנִים}} ''minyanim'' {{IPA-he|minjanˈim|}}) is the [[quorum]] of ten Jewish adults required for certain [[Mitzvah|religious obligation]]s. In more traditional streams of Judaism only men may constitute a minyan; in more modern streams [[Women in Judaism|women are also counted]].&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf|title=Women and the Minyan|last=Fine|first=Rabbi David J.|date=12 June 2012|work=Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly|publisher=Rabbinical Assembly|language=English, Hebrew|accessdate=23 May 2011|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Golinkin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.responsafortoday.com/engsums/6_5.htm|title=Women in the Minyan and as Shelihot Tzibbur|last=Golinkin|first=Rabbi David|work=Va'ad Halakhah – English Summaries|publisher=Schechter Institute of Jewish Studies|accessdate=23 May 2011|location=Jerusalem, Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common activity requiring a ''minyan'' is public [[Jewish services|prayer]]. Accordingly, the term ''minyan'' in contemporary Judaism has taken on the secondary meaning of referring to a [[Jewish services|prayer service]].

[[File:JaffaMaariv.jpg|thumb|right|Minyan Ma'ariv prayer in a Jaffa [[Tel Aviv]] flea-market shop]]

==Sources==
The source for the requirement of ''minyan'' is recorded in the Talmud. The word ''minyan'' itself comes from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root {{lang|he-Latn|maneh}} {{Hebrew|מנה}} meaning to count or to number. The word is related to the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word ''mene'', numbered, appearing in [[the writing on the wall]] in {{bibleverse||Daniel|5:25|HE}}.

'''Babylonian Talmud'''

The [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]] ([[Megillah (Talmud)|Megillah]] 23b) derives the requirement of a ''minyan'' of ten [[shomer Shabbat]] for [[Kiddush Hashem]]&lt;ref name="Sanhedrin 74b"&gt;[[Sanhedrin]] 74b&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Devarim she-Bikdusha'', "matters of sanctity", by combining three scriptural verses using the rule of {{lang|he-Latn|[[Talmudical Hermeneutics#Gezerah Shavah (גזירה שוה)|gezerah shavah]]}}:

The word "midst" in the verse:

:''"And I shall be '''sanctified''' in the '''midst''' of the children of Israel"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Leviticus|22:32|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

also appears in the verse:

:''"Separate yourselves from the '''midst''' of the '''congregation'''"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Numbers|16:21|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

The term "congregation" is also used in another verse that describes the [[Shlach#The scouts|ten spies]] who brought back a negative report of the [[Land of Israel]]:

:''"How long shall I bear with this evil '''congregation''' which murmur against me?"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Numbers|14:27|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

From this combination, the Talmud concludes that "sanctification" should occur in the "midst" of a "congregation" of ten.

'''Jerusalem Talmud'''

The [[Jerusalem Talmud]] (Megillah 4:4) offers two sources for the requirement, also using a {{lang|he-Latn|[[Talmudical Hermeneutics#Gezerah Shavah (גזירה שוה)|gezerah shavah]]}}:

The word "congregation" in the verse:

:''"Speak to all the '''congregation''' of the children of Israel, and say to them: '''You shall be holy'''"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Leviticus|19:2|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

is also used in another verse:

:''"How long shall I bear with this evil '''congregation''' which murmur against me?"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Numbers|14:27|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

Since the term "congregation" in the later verse refers to the [[Shlach#The scouts|ten spies]], so too in the former verse: "You shall be holy" refers to a "congregation" of ten.

The second source is based on the term "children of Israel" which appears in the following two verses:

:''"And I shall be '''sanctified''' in the midst of the '''children of Israel'''"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Leviticus|22:32|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

:''" And the '''children of Israel''' came to buy among those that came"'' &lt;small&gt;({{bibleverse||Genesis|42:5|HE}})&lt;/small&gt;

Just as the "children of Israel" in the later verse refers to the ten sons of [[Jacob]] who descended to Egypt to obtain food during the famine, so too the former verse refers to sanctification among the “children of Israel” in the presence of ten.

==Rituals requiring a ''minyan''==
Some rituals require a minyan; the presence of a rabbi (a teacher, not a [[Priest (Judaism)|priest]]) is not essential—it is said that "nine rabbis do not constitute a minyan, but ten cobblers can".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.templewb.org/Chronicle/Volume09_Issue01.pdf Temple Israel Chrnicle, January 2009, p3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The following instances which require a minyan are listed in the [[Mishnah]] in [[Scroll of Esther|Megillah]] (iv. 3): 
*Public worship, which consists of the additional readings of ''[[Kaddish]]'', ''[[Barechu]]'', ''[[Kedusha]]'' and the [[Amidah#The repetition|Repetition of the Amidah]]. The treatise [[Soferim (Talmud)|Soferim]], written in Babylonia in the seventh century, contains a passage (10:7) often interpreted as asserting that in [[Land of Israel]] at that time seven men were allowed to hold public services. Correctly interpreted it refers to the repeating of "Kaddish" and "Barechu" at the synagogue for the benefit of late comers, and declares that in Israel such a repetition is permitted only when seven (according to others, when six) men are present who have not yet heard these responsive readings.
*The [[priestly blessing]].
*Reading from the [[Torah reading|Torah]] and [[Haftarah|Prophets]] with the associated benedictions.
*[[Sheva Brachot|Seven benedictions]] recited at a wedding, or at any meal of the bridegroom and bride within a week from the wedding.
*Using the formulation "Let us bless our God, from whose wealth we have eaten," in preparing for [[Grace after meals]].
*Ancient funeral ceremonies, no longer in use, which incorporated arranging the standing and sitting, reciting the benedictions of the mourners and the consolation of the mourners.

Other instances which require the presence of a ''minyan'' include:
*[[Kiddush Hashem]]&lt;ref name="Sanhedrin 74b"/&gt;
*Recitation of the [[Thirteen Attributes of Mercy]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]]  [[Orach Chayim|OC]]  565:5&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recitation of [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Blessing for surviving illness or danger|Birkat ha-Gomel]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chayim|OC]]  219:3&lt;/ref&gt;

While the required quorum for most activities requiring a quorum is usually ten, it is not always so. For example, the [[Passover]] sacrifice or [[Korban]] ''Pesach'' (from the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]) must be offered before a quorum of 30. (It must be performed in front of ''kahal adat yisrael'', the assembly of the congregation of Israel. Ten are needed for the assembly, ten for the congregation, and ten for Israel.) According to some Talmudic authorities, women counted in the ''minyan'' for offering the ''Korban Pesach'' (e.g. Rav, Rav Kahana, ''Pesachim'' 79b).

==Prayer with a ''minyan''==
[[File:Minyan waiting for the tenth.jpg|thumb|300px|An exhibit at the [[Diaspora Museum, Tel Aviv]] shows a group of Jews waiting for the tenth man]]

It was the firm belief of the sages that wherever ten Israelites are assembled, either for worship or for the study of the Law, the [[Shekinah|Divine Presence]] dwells among them. In rabbinical literature, those who meet for study or prayer in smaller groups, even one who meditates or prays alone, are to be praised. However, the stress is put upon the merits and sacredness of the ''minyan'' of ten. The codifiers, such as [[Maimonides]],&lt;ref&gt;Maimonides writes that ''"The prayer of the community is always heard; and even if there were sinners among them, the Holy One, blessed be He, never rejects the prayer of the multitude. Hence a person must join himself with the community, and should not pray by himself so long as he is able to pray with the community."'' [[Mishneh Torah]] ''Hilkhot Tefillah'' 8.1&lt;/ref&gt; his annotators, and the author of the [[Shulkhan Arukh]], have unitedly given strength to this sentiment, and have thus, for more than a thousand years, made the daily attendance at public worship, morning and evening, to be conducted with a quorum of ten.

There is a disagreement between the medieval commentators on whether prayer with a ''minyan'' is preferable or obligatory. [[Rashi]] is of the view that an individual is obligated to pray with a ''minyan'', while [[Nahmanides]] holds that only if ten adult males are present are they obliged to recite their prayer together, but an individual is not required to seek out a ''minyan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Rashi and the [[Tosafot]] on Talmud Bavli Pesachim 46a are both of the opinion that one is required to travel the distance of 4 ''[[Biblical mile|mil]]'' to pray with a minyan.  The [[Mishnah Berurah]] writes that one who is sitting at home must travel up to one ''mil''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hashkafah.com/index.php?/topic/63680-halacha-lite/page__p__1405610&amp;#entry1405610 Savannah at the Hashkafah.com forums quoting https://www.dafdigest.org/pesachim/Pesachim%20046.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eligibility==
[[File:Minyan at the Kotel.jpg|thumb|A Minyan held at the [[Western Wall]] in [[Israel]].]]
There is much discussion in [[rabbinic literature]] on the matter of who is eligible to be counted in a ''minyan''. Some discussions revolve around whether or not a ''minyan'' should consist of individuals who are obligated in performance of that particular precept. Some authorities deduce who may constitute a ''minyan'' by drawing on the verses which are brought as the basis for minyan and their implication. For example, the verse, ''"How long shall I bear with this evil congregation which murmur against me?"'' is referring to the ten spies, a congregation comprising Jewish adult males. It is understood from this that a minyan must likewise comprise ten Jewish adult males. Other classical sources base their rulings on discussions brought in the Talmud. Contemporary rabbinical authorities deal with a plethora of questions relating to qualification for ''minyan''.

===Minors===
Before a boy [[Bar Mitzvah|turns thirteen]], he is considered a [[Minor (law)|minor]] in Jewish law and is not obligated in the performance of religious precepts. However, if a child is over six years of age and has adequate comprehension of the significance of the precepts, his status may change. His inclusion in ''minyan'' is thus subject of Talmudic dispute. Based on the Talmudic [[Sugya|passage]] in Berachot, [[Rabbeinu Tam]] states that a minor can act as the tenth person&lt;ref&gt;[[Tosafot]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berachot]] 47b&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the [[Baal Ha-Maor]], up to four minors would be permitted. [[Asher ben Jehiel|Rosh]] explains that those who permit the inclusion of a minor maintain that it is the [[Shekhinah|Divine Presence]] which actually constitutes the tenth member, thereby validating the ''minyan''. (This may explain why some of these authorities require that the minor represent this fact by holding a [[Chumash (Judaism)|chumash]].) However the majority of [[poskim]] follow the conclusion of the [[Isaac ben Samuel|Ri]] who holds that a minor can never be counted in a ''minyan'' under any circumstances. This is the stance taken by the [[Shulchan Aruch]], who, although acknowledging some authorities do permit the inclusion of an astute six-year-old, writes that consensus rejects this view and only males over the age of thirteen may constitute a ''minyan''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Shulchan Aruch]] [[Orach Chayim|OC]] 55&lt;/ref&gt; However, in extraordinary circumstances some are lenient and permit a minor over six years old holding a chumash or [[Sefer Torah]] to complete a ''minyan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Women===
Although the issue of whether women are permitted to make up a ''minyan'' has been noted in early works, the matter has only come to the fore in the past few decades, a reaction to an enhanced role of women in modern society and to the demand for their inclusion in all areas of religious life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Talmud itself does not directly address the question of whether women may count as part of a minyan for devarim shebkdusha. Since the Talmud uses the same ''gezerah shavah'' for Kiddush Hashem as it uses for ''devarim shebkdusha'', one may expect the laws for those two cases to be the same. Many authorities are of the opinion that women are included in the ''minyan'' for Kiddush Hashem and Hillul Hashem. However, traditional codifiers generally do not include women in the ''minyan'' for ''devarim shebkdusha''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The Talmud ([[Arakhin]] 3a) relates that women are required to recite ''[[Grace After Meals#Zimmun|zimmun]]'' of three participants, and Berakhot 45 says that women may recite the zimmun. However, the majority of scholars are of the opinion that ten women may not recite the additional form of ''zimun be-Shem'', which is obligatory when ten men are present. The few authorities who do permit ten women to use the ''zimmun be-Shem'' formulation explain that the necessity for ten in this case is unique and cannot be compared to other instances requiring ''minyan''. Only [[Rabbeinu Simcha]] among these authorities mentions the possibility of one woman joining with nine men to form a ''minyan'' for prayer. This isolated opinion is rejected by the codifiers. There are a number of cases, including reading of the [[Book of Esther|megillah]], where a limited number of authorities count women towards the minyan. However, in these cases the reason why women are counted is not because they constitute a "congregation," but rather because a public audience is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A possible reason why it is men who were obligated to form a congregation in order to convene the Divine Presence is that women were individually considered sufficiently holy and did not require the combination of a group and special prayers to achieve added holiness deficient in men. Due to the righteousness of the women in the wilderness, they did not suffer the same deadly fate as their male counterparts, and despite the spies’ negative report about the holy land, wished to enter it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Others point to the sociological reality that women were traditionally expected to care for the house and children. The Jewish tradition did not require women to leave their social role to engage in public prayer.&lt;ref name=BermanWomen&gt;Rabbi Saul Berman, "The Status of Women in Halakhic Judaism", Tradition, Fall 1973, pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1845, rabbis attending the [[Frankfort Synod]] of the emerging [[Reform Judaism]] declared that women count in a minyan, a formalization of a customary Reform practice dating back to 1811.&lt;ref&gt;http://uf.sjc.vic.edu.au/religious-traditions-depth-studies/07/39{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of [[Conservative Judaism]] voted to count men and women equally as members of a minyan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1973/09/11/archive/women-equal-with-men-in-minyan |title=Women Equal with Men in Minyan &amp;#124; Jewish Telegraphic Agency |publisher=Jta.org |date=1973-09-11 |accessdate=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the Committee adapted a [[responsum]] by Rabbi David Fine which provides an official religious-law foundation for women counting in a ''minyan'' and explains the current Conservative approach to the role of women in prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= |title=[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/sites/default/files/public/halakhah/teshuvot/19912000/oh_55_1_2002.pdf] }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(194&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt; This responsum holds that, although Jewish women do not traditionally have the same obligations as men, Conservative women have, as a collective whole, voluntarily undertaken them. Because of this collective undertaking, the Fine responsum holds that Conservative women are eligible to serve as agents and decision-makers for others.  The responsum also holds that traditionally-minded communities and individual women can opt out without being regarded by the Conservative movement as sinning.  By adopting this responsum, the CJLS found itself in a position to provide a considered Jewish-law justification for its egalitarian practices, without having to rely on potentially unconvincing arguments, undermine the religious importance of community and clergy, ask individual women intrusive questions, repudiate the ''halakhic'' tradition, or label women following traditional practices as sinners.

===Transgressors===
The question of whether a sinner can be counted for a ''minyan'' has become much more pertinent in recent generations, where a general malaise in religious observance among the majority of Jews has occurred.  The Shulchan Aruch states that though a person may be a notorious and habitual sinner and has even committed a [[capital offense]], unless a person has been placed under a religious ban due to his sinful behaviour, he is counted among the ten. The source provided for this sentiment is from the incident with [[Achan (Bible)|Achan]] who, despite having been put to death for his transgression, was still referred to as a Jew.&lt;ref&gt;[[Beit Yosef (book)|Beit Yosef]] [[Orach Chayim|OC]] 55:11–12&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pri Megadim]] explains that this is only true if he sins for self-satisfaction, but if a person sins to spite God or has openly severed their connection with the Jewish people by professing a hostile creed or by publicly desecrating the Shabbat, such a person is prohibited from constituting a minyan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Orach Chayim|OC]] 55&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, many contemporary authorities have been driven to adopt a lenient view in the face of widespread public non-observance of the Shabbat, on the presumption that it does not indicate a deliberate denial of faith, but is rather a result of ignorance and succumbing to the pressure of social and economic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Proselytes===
{{see also|Proselyte}}
Even though [[Tosafot]] deduce from the Talmud in [[Sukkah]] 38b that wherever the verse states “children of Israel” it comes to exclude a proselyte unless there is specific clause for inclusion, here with regard to ''minyan'' the sources state that there is no reasoning to exclude a full-fledged proselyte. Since such a person is permitted to act as a prayer leader, obviously they can count towards a ''minyan''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf Hachayim]] '' 55:17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Those who are unable to respond===
As long as a person is of sufficient intelligence, he can be included in the ''minyan'', even if he is unable to respond to the prayers which make the presence of ten a necessity. According to some sources, this is because as long as ten are gathered the [[Divine Presence]] descends and it is feasible to pronounce a ''Dvar she'bekedusha''. This includes someone who is in the middle of his prayers but is precluded from responding to the [[hazzan]]’s incantations and someone who is [[Muteness|mute]] but can hear the prayers. (Someone who is deaf but has the ability and knows when to respond can also be included.) There is however a dispute regarding someone who is asleep or intoxicated. Such a person has sufficient intelligence, but at present can neither hear or respond.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aruch Hashulchan]] '' 55:12–13&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally he should be woken to the extent that he is dozing, but in extraneous circumstances where it impossible to arouse him, it is permitted to include the maximum of one sleeping person in the ''minyan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Arrangement==
It is not just the status of the individual which dictates eligibility; the physical arrangement of the ''minyan'' is also a factor. Maimonides delineates the confines which are placed on the arrangement of the people making up a ''minyan''. Ideally all the members of the minyan should be gathered in one room. However, if they are within hearing distance of one another, it is permitted for the ten to be distributed in two adjoining rooms.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishnah Torah]] Tefillah viii&lt;/ref&gt; Later authorities limit the extent of this opinion and rule that even if there is an opening between the two rooms, the two groups are still considered separate entities. Only in unusual circumstances is it permitted, as long as some of the men in each room can see each other.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mishna Berurah]] 55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ten-and-ten minyan (ten men and ten women)==
{{main|Independent minyan|Partnership minyan|Guide for the Halakhic Minyan}}
Over the last decade or so, more and more lay-led worship communities have formed that attempt to combine commitment to traditional Jewish law with a push for increased participation and recognition of the role of women. While many are simply referred to as "independent minyanim," the term used by the [[Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance]] for those groups that consider themselves part of the Modern Orthodox community is "partnership minyan."  Many of these groups have adopted the custom initially instituted by [[Shira Hadasha]] in Jerusalem to wait for a "ten-and-ten minyan," made up of ten men and ten women.

Shira Hadasha has based many of its decisions on the writings of rabbis like [[Mendel Shapiro]] and [[Daniel Sperber]].  Some also use the [[Guide for the Halakhic Minyan]], a compendium of halakhic sources supporting increased participation by women in services, as a basis for discussions of practices like the ten-and-ten minyan.

[[File:Mollah imamzadeh tabriz.jpg|thumb|right|A mullah praying in [[Imamzadeh Hamzah, Tabriz]].]]
'''Mullah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ʌ|l|ə|,_|ˈ|m|ʊ|l|ə|,_|ˈ|m|uː|l|ə}}; {{lang-ar|ملا}}, {{lang-az|Molla}}, {{lang-fa|ملا}} / ''Mollâ'', {{lang-tr|Molla}}, {{lang-bn|মোল্লা}}) is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|مَوْلَى}}{{verification needed|date=December 2015}} ''mawlā'', meaning "vicar", "master" and "guardian". However, used ambiguously in the [[Quran]], some publishers have described its usage as a religious title as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Esposito|first1=John|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Islam|date=2004|page=214}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes applied to a [[Muslim]] man or woman, educated in [[Islamic theology]] and [[Sharia|sacred law]]. In large parts of the [[Muslim world]], particularly [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Bahrain (historical region)|Eastern Arabia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Balkans#Religion|the Balkans]], [[Central Asia]], the [[Horn of Africa]] and [[South Asia]], it is the name commonly given to local Islamic clerics or [[mosque]] leaders.&lt;ref name="Roy"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Failure of Political Islam| last=Roy| first=Olivier| authorlink=Olivier Roy (professor)| year=1994| pages=28–9| publisher=Harvard University Press| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn=0-674-29140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title has also been used in some [[Sephardic]] [[Jewish]] communities to refer to the community's leadership, especially religious leadership.&lt;ref&gt;See for example: [http://www.jewishgen.org/Rabbinic/journal/bukhara.htm "Rabbinic Succession in Bukhara 1790–1930"],&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''mullah'' is primarily understood in the Muslim world as a term of respect for an educated religious man.&lt;ref name="Taheri"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Spirit of Allah: Khomeini and the Islamic Revolution| last=Taheri| first=Amir| authorlink=Amir Taheri| year=1985| pages=53| publisher=Adler &amp; Adler| location=Bethesda, Md.| isbn=0-917561-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Training and duties==
Ideally, a trained mullah will have studied Islamic traditions ([[hadith]]), and Islamic law ([[fiqh]]). Such figures often have memorized the [[Qur'an]]. Uneducated villagers may frequently classify a literate Muslim with a less than complete Islamic training as their "mullah" or religious cleric. Mullahs with varying levels of training lead prayers in mosques, deliver religious sermons, and perform religious ceremonies such as birth rites and funeral services. They also often teach in a type of Islamic school known as a [[madrasah]]. Three kinds of knowledge are applied most frequently in interpreting Islamic texts (i.e. the [[Quran]], [[Hadiths]], etc.) for matters of [[Shariah]], i.e., Islamic law.

Mullahs have frequently been involved in politics, but only recently have they served in positions of power,  since  [[Islamism|Islamists]] [[Iranian Revolution|seized power in Iran]] in 1979. In Syria, political militant groups supported by the West have taken root. The [[Taliban]] enforced Islamism in Afghanistan.

==Usage==
The term is most often applied to Shi'ite clerics, as [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]] is the predominant tradition in Iran. However, the term is very common in [[Urdu language|Urdu]], spoken throughout [[Pakistan]], and it is used throughout the Indian subcontinent for any Muslim clergy, [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] or Shi'a. Muslim clergy in [[Russia]] and other former [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]]s are also referred to as mullahs, regardless of whether they are Sunni or Shi'a.

The term has also been used among [[Persian Jews]], [[Bukharan Jews]], Afghan Jews, and other [[Central Asian]] Jews to refer to the community's religious and/or secular leadership. In [[Kaifeng]], China, the [[history of the Jews in China|historic Chinese Jews]] who managed the synagogue were called "mullahs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04kdAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=mohammedan#v=snippet&amp;q=mohammedan%20roll%20law%20purchase&amp;f=false |title=Chinese and Japanese repository of facts and events in science, history and art, relating to Eastern Asia, Volume 1|author= |editor= |year=1863 |publisher=s.n. |edition= |location=Oxford|page=48|isbn=|pages=|volume=|accessdate=2011-07-06}} (Original from the University of Michigan)&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of Eastern Arabia, which has a long Shiite tradition and numerous Shiite minorities, the term is seldom used in other Arabic-speaking areas where its nearest equivalent is often ''[[shaykh]]'' (implying formal Islamic training), ''[[imam (Sunni Islam)|imam]]'' (prayer leader; not to be confused with the imams of the Shiite world), or [[ulema|''ʿālim'']] ("scholar", plural ''ʿulamāʾ'').  In the Sunni world, the concept of "cleric" is of limited usefulness, as authority in the religious system is relatively decentralized.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The term is frequently used in English, although English-speaking Muslim clergy rarely call themselves mullahs.  It was adopted from Urdu by the British rulers of India and subsequently came into more widespread use.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

It is sometimes used in a derogatory and humorous form, to mock [[Gnosticism|gnostically]] religious men.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Iran===
Until the early 20th century, the term ''mullah'' was used in Iranian [[hawza]]s (seminaries) to refer to low-level clergy who specialized in telling stories of [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], rather than teaching or issuing [[fatwa]]s. Today, the term is sometimes used as a derogatory term for any Islamic cleric. In recent years, at least among Shia clerics, the term ''ruhani'' (spiritual) has been promoted as an alternative to mullah and ''[[akhoond]]'', free of pejorative connotations.&lt;ref&gt;[[Moojan Momen|Momen, Moojan]], ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

The god [[Susanoo-no-Mikoto|Susanoo]] is described as the ruler of Ne-no-kuni. There are differing accounts on how he assumed this position:

According to the ''Kojiki'' when [[Izanagi]] tasked his children with the rule over the various realms: [[Amaterasu]] got the "Plain of the High Heaven" (''[[Takama-ga-hara]]''), [[Tsukuyomi-no-Mikoto|Tsukuyomi]] got the "Dominion of the Night" (''Yoru-no-wosu-kuni''), and Susanoo got the {{Nihongo|"Sea Plain"|海原|Una-bara}}. However, Susanoo ignored this command and kept crying over the loss of his dead mother [[Izanami]], such that his weeping lead to death and destruction. As Susanoo wished, Izanagi expelled him to be near his mother in Ne-no-kata-su-kuni.&lt;ref&gt;''Kojiki'', section XII.&lt;/ref&gt; In the previous episodes about Izanami's death this land is called Yomi.

The ''Nihon Shoki'' mentions ''Ne-no-kuni'' in passing when describing an episode where Susanoo was banished from Takama-ga-hara for various evil acts he committed, and went to a place called ''(Soko-tsu-)Ne-no-kuni''.&lt;ref&gt;''Nihonshoki'', volume 1, sections 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Kojiki'' when [[Ōkuninushi]] visited Ne-no-kuni and insulted Susanoo he was submitted to overcome three ordeals, one being described to sleep in a house infested with snakes, centipedes and wasps. This is sometimes taken as another hint that Ne-no-kuni is a subterranean realm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://k-amc.kokugakuin.ac.jp/DM/detail.do?class_name=col_eos&amp;data_id=23640|title=View of the other world (takaikan)|last=Matsumura|first=Kazuo|date=2007-03-31|website=Encyclopedia of Shinto|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation of the myth contrasts the trials of Ōkuninushi to a symbolic death through rites of initiation that cause one to become reborn into a new life. In this story, death doesn't pollute, it regenerates. The land of the dead also contains the forces of life, ''[[Mitama|tama]]''.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The {{Nihongo|''Michiae no matsuri''|道饗祭}} [[norito]] is an ancient [[Shinto]] prayer asking the gods to prevent the evil beings from {{Nihongo|''Ne-no-kuni-Soko-no-kuni''|根國底國}} to do any harm. The {{Nihongo|''Minatsuki no tsugomori no ōharae (no norito)''|六月晦大祓[祝詞]}}, also short {{Nihongo|''Ōharae no kotoba''|大祓詞}}, which is performed in the great purification (''[[harae]]'') ceremony of the sixth month locates Ne-no-kuni-Soko-no-kuni in the {{Nihongo|"Great Sea Plain"|大海原|Ō-una-bara}}, i.e. the ocean.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[Yanagita Kunio]] compared ''Ne no Kuni'' to the [[Ryukyuan religion#Nirai Kanai|Niraikanai of the Ryukyuan religion]]. This paradisaical land is situated beyond the seas.

The description '''person of faith''' (plural: '''people of faith''') refers to any person who can be delineated or classified by an adherence to a religious tradition or doctrine, as opposed to those who do not publicly identify or in any way espouse a religious path. The term '''people of faith''' has been increasingly used in the 20th and 21st century by religious adherents in Westernized countries who are critical of a perceived increase in public disenchantment or de-emphasis upon accommodation for religious adherents, although the term itself is used more as a catch-all term which is intentionally non-denominational or non-specific to any particular religious path.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A person of faith is said to belong to a '''faith community''' or '''faith-based community'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith community|url=http://www.ldoceonline.com/dictionary/faith-community|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=faith-based|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/faith-based|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also criticized by advocates of nontheistic positions for being inaccurate in its assumption of an underlying, unifying commonality between all religious observants - despite stark doctrinal differences and oppositional stances - simply for the purpose of reducing the influence of secular-minded individuals (similar to the term [[person of color]] as a catch-all descriptor of non-white persons, or the Islamic description of [[people of the Book]] to describe the communities of adherents to Islam, Christianity and Judaism).{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

The '''Qingming''' or '''Ching Ming''' festival, also known as '''Tomb-Sweeping Day''' in English (sometimes also called '''Chinese Memorial Day''' or '''Ancestors' Day'''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.hk/en/about/abouthk/holiday/ |title=General holidays for 2015 |publisher=GovHK |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macautourism.gov.mo/events/calendar.php |title=Macau Government Tourist Office |publisher=Macau Tourism |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[traditional Chinese festival]]. It falls on the first day of the fifth [[solar term]] of the [[Chinese calendar|traditional Chinese]] [[lunisolar]] calendar. This makes it the 15th day after the [[March equinox|Spring Equinox]], either 4 or 5 April in a given year.&lt;ref name=ChiComs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/Festivals/78319.htm |title=Traditional Chinese Festivals |publisher=china.org.cn |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ROC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=44782&amp;CtNode=2499&amp;mp=1008 |title=Tomb Sweeping Day |publisher=Taiwan.gov.tw |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407065951/http://www.taiwan.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=44782&amp;CtNode=2499&amp;mp=1008 |archivedate=7 April 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.discoverhongkong.com/uk/see-do/events-festivals/chinese-festivals/ching-ming-festival.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; During Qingming, Chinese families visit the tombs of their ancestors to clean the gravesites, pray to their ancestors, and make ritual offerings. Offerings would typically include traditional food dishes, and the burning of [[joss sticks]] and [[joss paper]].

The Qingming Festival has been observed by the Chinese for over 2500 years. It became a [[public holidays of the People's Republic of China|public holiday]] in mainland China in 2008. In [[Taiwan]], the [[holidays in Taiwan|public holiday]] was in the past always observed on 5 April to honor the death of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on that day in 1975, but with Chiang's party currently out of power, this convention is not being observed. A similar holiday is observed in the [[Ryukyu Islands]], called ''Shīmī'' in the [[Ryukyuan languages|local language]].

In mainland China, the holiday is associated with the consumption of ''[[qingtuan]]'', green dumplings made of [[glutinous rice]] and [[Chinese mugwort]] or [[barley grass]]. A similar confection called ''[[caozaiguo]]'' or ''shuchuguo'', made with [[Jersey cudweed]], is consumed in Taiwan.

== Origin ==
{{see also|Cold Food Festival}}
The festival originated from the [[Cold Food Festival|Cold Food or Hanshi Festival]] which remembered [[Jie Zhitui]], a nobleman of the [[Jin (Chinese state)|state of Jin]] (modern [[Shanxi]]) during the [[Spring and Autumn Period]]. Amid the [[Li Ji Unrest]], he followed his master [[Prince Chong'er]] in 655{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}} to exile among the [[Beidi|Di tribes]] and around China. Supposedly, he once even cut meat from his own thigh to provide his lord with [[soup]]. In 636{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, [[Duke Mu of Qin]] invaded Jin and enthroned Chong'er as its duke, where he was generous in rewarding those who had helped him in his time of need. Owing either to his own high-mindedness or to the duke's neglect, however, Jie was long passed over. He finally retired to the forest around [[Mount Mian]] with his elderly mother. The duke went to the forest in {{nowrap|636 {{sc|bc}}}} but could not find them. He then ordered his men to set fire to the forest in order to force Jie out. When Jie and his mother were killed instead, the duke was overcome with remorse and erected a temple in his honor. The people of Shanxi subsequently revered Jie as an [[Taoist immortal|immortal]] and avoided lighting fires for as long as a month in the depths of winter, a practice so injurious to children and the elderly that the area's rulers unsuccessfully attempted to ban it for centuries. A compromise finally developed where it was restricted to 3 days around the [[Qingming (solar term)|Qingming]] [[solar term]] in mid-spring.

The present importance of the holiday is credited to [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]]. Wealthy citizens in China were reportedly holding too many extravagant and ostentatiously expensive ceremonies [[ancestral veneration in China|in honor of their ancestors]]. In {{nowrap|{{sc|ad}} 732}}, Xuanzong sought to curb this practice by declaring that such respects could be formally paid only once a year, on Qingming.&lt;ref name=cathay_ce&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cathay.ce.cn/person/200712/21/t20071221_13994183.shtml |title=寒食清明节:纪念晋国大夫介之推 |publisher=Cathay.ce.cn |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A Indonesian Chinese Family pray for their deceased members at Sanggar Agung Temple, Surabaya.jpg|200px|thumb|An [[Indonesian Chinese]] family pray for their deceased members at Qingming Festival of 2013 under the Heaven Gate of [[Sanggar Agung]].]]
Qingming Festival is when Chinese people traditionally visit the tombs to sweep tombstones. This tradition has been legislated by the Emperors who built majestic imperial tombstones for every dynasty. For over 5000 years, the Chinese imperials, [[nobility]], [[merchants]] and [[peasantry]] alike have gathered together to remember the lives of the departed, to visit their [[tombstones]] to perform Confucian filial piety by tombsweeping, to visit burial grounds, graveyards or in modern urban cities, the city columbaria, to perform groundskeeping and maintenance, and to commit to pray for their [[ancestors]] in the uniquely Chinese concept of the [[afterlife]] and to offer remembrances of their ancestors to living blood relatives, their kith and kin.

The Qingming Festival commemorates the life of the departed in an elaborate set of rituals often mistranslated in the West as [[Ancestor worship|ancestral worship]]. Actually, it is a Confucian form of posthumous respect and filial piety offered to a Chinese person's ancestors, departed relatives, or parents. Not all Chinese persons will pray directly to their ancestors in ancestral spirit but almost all will observe the Qing Ming Rituals.

The young and old alike kneel down to offer prayers before tombstones of the ancestors, offer the burning of joss in both the forms of incense sticks (joss-sticks) and silver-leafed paper (joss-paper), sweep the tombs and offer food, tea, wine, chopsticks, and/or libations in memory of the ancestors. Depending on the religion of the observers, some pray to a higher deity to honour their ancestors while others may pray directly to the ancestral spirit/s.

These rites have a long tradition in Asia, especially among the imperialty who legislated these rituals into a national religion. They have been preserved especially by the peasantry and are most popular with farmers today, who believe that continued observances will ensure fruitful harvests ahead by appeasing the spirits in the other world.

Religious symbols of ritual purity, such as pomegranate and willow branches, are popular at this time. Some people carry willow branches with them on Qingming or stick willow branches on their gates and/or front doors. There are similarities to palm  leaves used on Palm Sundays in Christianity; both are religious rituals. Furthermore, the belief is that the willow branches will help ward off the unappeased, troubled and troubling spirits, and/or evil spirits that may be wandering in the earthly realms on Qingming.

After gathering on Qingming to perform Confucian clan and family duties at the tombstones, graveyards or columbaria, celebrants spend the rest of the day in clan or family outings, before they start the spring plowing. They often sing and dance. Qingming is also a time when young couples traditionally start courting. Another popular thing to do is to fly kites in the shapes of animals or characters from [[Chinese opera]].&lt;ref name=gov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cese/eng/qzhhz/notice/t422776.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=8 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415062446/http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/ce/cese/eng/qzhhz/notice/t422776.htm |archivedate=15 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another common practice is to carry flowers instead of burning paper, incense, or firecrackers.&lt;ref name=upi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upiasia.com/Politics/2009/04/08/chinas_restless_dead_on_tomb-sweeping_day/9394/ |title=Asia News - South Asia News - Latest headlines – News, Photos, Videos |publisher=UPIAsia.com |date=2012-07-22 |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having no official status, the [[overseas Chinese]] communities in Southeast Asian nations, such as those in Singapore and [[Malaysia]], take this festival seriously and observe its traditions faithfully. Some Qingming rituals and ancestral veneration decorum observed by the overseas Chinese in Malaysia and Singapore can be dated back to Ming and Qing dynasties, as the overseas communities were not affected by the Cultural Revolution in Mainland China. Qingming in Malaysia is an elaborate family function or a clan feast (usually organized by the respective clan association) to commemorate and honour recently deceased relatives at their grave sites and distant ancestors from China at home altars, clan temples or makeshift altars in Buddhist or Taoist temples. For the overseas Chinese community, the Qingming festival is very much a family celebration and, at the same time, a family obligation. They see this festival as a time of reflection for honouring and giving thanks to their forefathers. Overseas Chinese normally visit the graves of their recently deceased relatives on the  weekend nearest to the actual date. According to the ancient custom, grave site veneration is only permissible ten days before and after the Qingming Festival. If the visit is not on the actual date, normally veneration before Qingming is encouraged. The Qingming Festival in [[Malaysia]] and Singapore normally starts early in the morning by paying respect to distant ancestors from China at home altars. This is followed by visiting the graves of close relatives in the country. Some follow the concept of [[filial piety]] to the extent of visiting the graves of their ancestors in [[mainland China]]. Traditionally, the family will burn [[Hell bank note|spirit money]] and paper replicas of material goods such as cars, homes, phones and paper servants. In Chinese culture, it is believed that people still need all of those things in the afterlife. Then family members take turns to kowtow three to nine times (depending on the family adherence to traditional values) before the tomb of the ancestors. The [[Kowtow]]ing ritual in front of the grave is performed in the order of patriarchal seniority within the family. After the ancestor worship at the grave site, the whole family or the whole clan feast on the food and drink they have brought for the worship either at the site or in nearby gardens in the memorial park, signifying the family's reunion with its ancestors. Another ritual related to the festival is the [[Cockfight (Sacred)|cockfight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~c07p208h/qingming.html |title=Festival of Pure Brightness |publisher=Uiowa.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141119191658/http://www.uiowa.edu/~c07p208h/qingming.html |archivedate=19 November 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being available within that historic and cultural context at [[Kaifeng]] Millennium City Park (Qingming Riverside Landscape Garden).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchinaguide.com/attraction/henan/kaifeng/millennium-city-park.htm |title=Millennium City Park, Kaifeng, Henan |publisher=Travelchinaguide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |title=Qingming Riverside Landscape Garden |publisher=Cultural-china.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812045704/http://www.cultural-china.com/chinaWH/html/en/Scenery88bye362.html |archivedate=12 August 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] died in 1976, thousands honored him during the festival to pay their respects. Many also pay respects to victims of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protests in 1989]] and [[Zhao Ziyang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090408-134013.html | title = China clamps down on Qing Ming | publisher = [[Straits Times]] | date = 8 April 2009 | accessdate = 18 March 2014 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140320010138/http://news.asiaone.com/News/the+Straits+Times/Story/A1Story20090408-134013.html | archivedate = 20 March 2014 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Chinese tea culture ==
{{See also|Chinese tea culture}}

The Qingming festival holiday has a significance in the Chinese tea culture since this specific day divides the fresh [[green tea]]s by their picking dates. Green teas made from leaves picked before this date are given the prestigious 'pre-qingming' ({{linktext|清|明|前}}) designation which commands a much higher price tag. These teas are prized for having much lighter and subtler aromas than those picked after the festival.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

The famous ''Qingming scroll'' by [[Zhang Zeduan]] is an ancient Chinese painting which portrays the scene of [[Kaifeng]] city, the capital of the [[Song Dynasty]] during a Qingming festival.

== In literature ==
Qingming was frequently mentioned in [[Chinese literature]]. Among these, the most famous one is probably [[Du Mu]]'s poem (simply titled "Qingming"):

Although the date is not presently a holiday in [[Vietnam]], the Qingming festival is mentioned (under the name ''Thanh Minh'') in the epic poem ''[[The Tale of Kieu]]'', when the protagonist Kieu meets a ghost of a dead old lady.  The description of the scenery during this festival is one of the best-known passages of [[Vietnamese literature]]:

{{Islamic prophets|Events}}{{Quran}}
The '''Qiṣaṣ al-'Anbiyā'''' ({{lang-ar| قصص الأنبياء}}) or '''Stories of the Prophets''' is any of various collections of stories adapted from the [[Quran]] and other Islamic literature, closely related to [[exegesis of the Qur'an]].  One of the best-known is a work composed by the Persian author Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm bin Mansūr bin Khalaf of Neyshābūr (A city located in Khorasan, Northeast Iran) the 12th century ([[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 5th century); another was composed by [[Al-Kisa'i|Muhammad al-Kisai]] in the 8th century ([[Anno Hegirae|AH]] 2th century); others include the ''Ara'is al-Majalis'' by [[Tha'ālibī|al-Tha'alabi]] (d. 1035, AH 427)  and the ''Qisas al-Anbiya'' by [[Ibn Kathir]] (d. 1372, AH 774).

==Overview==
[[File:Pharaoh watches a serpent devour a person in the presence of the Moses (6125069974).jpg|thumb|[[Pharaoh (Bible)|Pharaoh]] watches a serpent devour a person in the presence of [[Moses in Islam|Musa]]; from a manuscript of ''Qisas al-Anbiya'', c. 1540.]]
Because the lives of biblical figures — the Muslim [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|prophets]] or أنبياء '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''anbiya''' — were covered only briefly in the Qur'an, scholars, poets, historians, and storytellers felt free to elaborate, clothing the bare bones with flesh and blood.  Authors of these texts drew on many traditions available to medieval Islamic civilization such as those of Asia, Africa, China, and Europe.  Many of these scholars were also authors of commentaries on the Qur'an; unlike Qur'an commentaries, however, which follow the order and structure of the Qur'an itself, the Qiṣaṣ told its stories of the prophets in chronological order  &amp;ndash; which makes them similar to the Jewish and Christian versions of the [[Bible]].

The ''Qiṣaṣ'' thus usually begins with the creation of the world and its various creatures including angels, and culminating in God's masterpiece, [[Islamic views on Adam|Adam]], created by His own hand and given life from His own breath.  Following the stories of the Prophet Adam and his family come the tales of [[Idris (prophet)|Idris]], [[Noah in Islam|Nuh]], [[Shem]], [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]], [[Salih]], [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]], [[Ishmael in Islam|Ismail]] and his mother [[Hagar in Islam|Hajar]], [[Lot in Islam|Lut]], [[Isaac in Islam|Ishaq]], [[Jacob and Esau]], [[Joseph in Islam|Yousuf]], [[Shuaib]], [[Moses in Islam|Musa]] and his brother [[Aaron]], [[Khidr]], [[Joshua]], Josephus, [[Eleazar]], [[Elijah]], [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]], [[Saul the King|Saul]], [[David in Islam|Dawud]], [[Solomon in Islam|Sulaiman]], [[Jonah#Jonah in Islam|Yunus]], [[Dhul-Kifl]] and [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] all the way up to and including [[John the Baptist#Islam|Yahya]] and [[Jesus in Islam|Isa]] son of [[Mary in Islam|Mariam]].  Sometimes the author incorporated related local folklore or oral traditions, and many of the ''Qiṣaṣ al-'Anbiyā&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;''s tales echo medieval Christian and Jewish stories.

During the mid-16th century, several gorgeously [[illumination (manuscript)|illuminated]] versions of the ''Qiṣaṣ'' were created by unnamed [[Ottoman Empire]] painters.  According to Milstein et al., "iconographical study [of the texts] reveals ideological programs and cliché typical of the Ottoman polemical discourse with its [[Shi'ite|Shi‘ite]] rival in [[Iran]], and its Christian neighbors in the West."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mazdapub.com/Stories-Prophets.htm Stories of the Prophets] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060703075506/http://www.mazdapub.com/Stories-Prophets.htm |date=July 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Culture of Peru}}
'''Religion in [[Peru]]''' is characterised by a diversity of religious beliefs and practices. [[Christianity]] is the predominant religion in Peru.

==Christianity==
 
===Roman Catholicism=== 
====History====                               
The Spanish conquerors not only conquered Peru militarily, but also sought to convert the indigenous populations to Christianity. Indigenous Andean religious beliefs and practices persisted, which the Catholic Church sought to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Mills, ''Idolatry and Its Enemies: Colonial Andean Religion and Extirpation, 1640-1750''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Ramírez, ''To Feed and Be Fed: The Cosmological Bases of Authority and Identity in the Andes''. Stanford: Stanford University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Dean, ''Inka Bodies and the Body of Christ: Corpus Christi in Colonial Cuzco, Peru''. Durham: Duke University Press 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches were built in the colonial period, the visible manifestation of Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Damián Bayon and Murillo Marx, ''History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture''. New York: Rizzoli 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wethey, ''Colonial Architecture and Sculpture in Peru''. Cambridge: Harvard University Press 1949.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Benavides Rodríguez, ''La arquitectura en el Virreinato del Perú y en la Capitanía General de Chile. 3rd edition’’. Santiago de Chile: Andrés Bello 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Antonio San Cristóbal Sebastián, ''Arquitectura virreinal religiosa de Lima''. Lima: stadium 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Valerie Fraser. ''The Architecture of Conquest: Building in the Viceroyalty of Peru, 1535-1635''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Gisbert and José de la Mesa, ''Arquitectura andina, 1500-1830''. 2nd edition. La Paz: embajada de España en Bolivia 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some convents were also built on Inca sites. For example, in 1605, some Dominican nuns built the Convent of Santa Catalina in Cuzco atop the site of the "acllahuasi", once home to virginal young women dedicated to serving the ruling Inca. Another convent, the Convent of Santa Clara, was one of the first institutions the conquistadores of Cuzco built for "Indian nobles", the daughters of the indigenous elite whose collaboration made Spain's indirect rule over the Andes possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Kathryn |last=Burns |title=Colonial Habits: Convents and the Spiritual Economy of Cuzco, Peru|location=Durham, North Carolina |publisher=Duke University Press |edition=2nd |year=1999 |isbn=9780822322917 |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Santa Clara, Inca nobles were to be "raised Christian and to receive 'buenas costumbres' (literally, good customs or manners), shorthand for an education in Spanishness", which included knowledge, stitchery, and literacy. After graduating from this course in Spanish culture, charges were free to profess vows or leave the convent.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Miscegenation was not an issue among Spaniards. Many prominent Spanish men lived with elite Inca women, only to marry Spanish women later in life and marry off their Andean partners to less prominent Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;Burns, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modern era====
The Peruvian government is closely allied with the Catholic Church. Article 50 of the Constitution recognizes the Catholic Church's role as "an important element in the historical, cultural, and moral development of the nation." &lt;ref&gt;International Religious Freedom Report 2007; Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor; Published by U.S. State Department. Page 15&lt;/ref&gt; Catholic clergy and laypersons receive state remuneration in addition to the stipends paid to them by the Church. This applies to the country's 52 bishops, as well as to some priests whose ministries are located in towns and villages along the borders. In addition each diocese receives a monthly institutional subsidy from the Government. An agreement signed with the Vatican in 1980 grants the Catholic Church special status in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Boyle (lawyer)|Kevin Boyle]] and Juliet Sheen, ''Freedom of religion and belief: a world report''. Routledge; 1997. Page 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church receives preferential treatment in education, tax benefits, immigration of religious workers, and other areas, in accordance with the agreement. So Roman Catholicism could be considered the main religion of Peru. See also the following: [[Roman Catholicism in Peru]] with Partial list of Catholic universities in Peru; and [[Lord of Miracles]], Peruvian religious festival. 

Although the Constitution states that there is freedom of religion, the law mandates that all schools, public and private, impart religious education as part of the curriculum throughout the education process (primary and secondary).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Fleet and Brian H. Smith''The Catholic Church and democracy in Chile and Peru''. University of Notre Dame Press; 1997. Page 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt; Catholicism is the only religion taught in public schools. In addition, Catholic religious symbols are found in all government buildings and public places.

According to the 2017 Census, there were 76% of the population 12+ identifying themselves as [[Catholics]].

===Protestants===

At the 2017 Census there were 14.1% of the population 12+ identifying themselves as [[Protestants]], mainly [[Evangelicals]]. In Latin America most Protestants are called Evangelicos because most of them are Evangelical Protestants, while some are also traditional [[Mainline Protestant]]. They continue to grow faster than the national growth rate.

== Other religions in Peru ==
&lt;!--
Con las migraciones llegaron otras prácticas religiosas al Perú. Los chinos en la primera mitad del siglo XIX, los judíos, las comunidades árabes y turcas, cada grupo social trajo su propia religión, de tal manera que se practica en el Perú, además de la religión cristiana, la religión budista, mahometana, hinduista, entre otras.
--&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
{{main|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Peru}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] claims more than [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints membership statistics#South America|578,000 members]] in Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta-newsroom.lds.org/country/peru |title=LDS Newsroom -Peru |publisher=Beta-newsroom.lds.org |date=2011-12-24 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ldsstats"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/peru |title=Peru |publisher=[[Church News]]|date=2016-09-24 |accessdate=2016-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently 764 congregations that meet in Peru.&lt;ref name="ldsstats"/&gt; 

There are currently two [[Temples (LDS Church)|LDS temples]] in Peru, one located in [[Lima Peru Temple|La Molina]], Lima, and the other in [[Trujillo Peru Temple|Trujillo]]. On October 6, 2012, the LDS church announced a third temple to be built in Arequipa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/trujillo/ |title=Trujillo Peru Temple |website=LDS Church Temples |date= |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the April 3, 2016 General Conference of the LDS church, it was announced that a fourth temple would be built in [[Los Olivos District|Los Olivos]], Lima. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ldschurchtemples.org/limalosolivos/ |title=Lima Peru Los Olivos Temple |website=LDS Church Temples |accessdate=2018-04-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This second temple in Lima will make the city one of the few in the world with two temples. Peru is also home to more than 100 stakes of the LDS church.

===Buddhism===
Buddhism was introduced to Peru in 1899 when the ship Sakura Maru arrived at Callao, Peru, with 790 people from Japan. Japanese, Chinese, and Korean immigration to Peru during the 19th and 20th Century  brought [[Mahayana Buddhism]] to Peru, and followers of that style of Buddhism remain largely concentrated within those ethnic groups. While Mahayana remains the largest school of Buddhism in Peru, other schools such as the Diamond form have begun to spread so that Peru has more than 50,000 practicing Buddhists.

=== Bahá'í Faith ===

{{main|Bahá'í Faith in Peru}}
The Bahá'í Faith in Peru begins with references to Peru in Bahá'í literature as early as 1916, with the first [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'ís]] visiting as early as 1919. A functioning community wasn't founded in [[Peru]] until the 1930s with the beginning of the arrival of coordinated [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]] from the [[United States]]&lt;ref name="alamb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Lamb  | first = Artemus  | title = The Beginnings of the Bahá'í Faith in Latin America:Some Remembrances, English Revised and Amplified Edition | publisher = M L VanOrman Enterprises  |date=November 1995  |location = 1405 Killarney Drive, West Linn OR, 97068, United States of America | url =http://bahai-library.com/lamb_bahai_latin_america}}&lt;/ref&gt; which progressed into finding national Peruvian converts and achieved an independent national community in 1961.&lt;ref name="stats"&gt;{{cite book |title = The Bahá'í Faith: 1844-1963: Information Statistical and Comparative, Including the Achievements of the Ten Year International Bahá'í Teaching &amp; Consolidation Plan 1953-1963 | publisher = [[Hand of the Cause|Hands of the Cause]] Residing in the Holy Land | year = 1963  | location = Haifa, Israel | pages = 19, 22, 23, 36, 46, 52, 109 | url =http://bahai-library.com/handscause_statistics_1953-63#22 | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 41,000 Bahá'ís in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; |publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp |accessdate = 2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albania]] has been a [[secular state]] since its founding in 1912, despite various changes in political systems.  During the 20th century after Independence (1912) the democratic, monarchic and later the totalitarian [[communist]] regimes followed a systematic secularisation of the nation and the national culture. The Albanian understanding of [[secularism]] has strong influences from the French “[[Laicité]]”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tiranaobserver.al/aleksander-xhuvani-laiciteti-dhe-shekullarizimi-i-shkollave-dhe-morali-laik/|title=Aleksandër Xhuvani: Laiciteti dhe shekullarizimi i shkollave dhe morali laik – Tirana Observer|website=www.tiranaobserver.al|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently Albania is a secular [[parliamentary republic]], in which the state guarantees freedom of belief. The constitution recognizes the equality of religious communities and the state is neutral in the questions of faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/constitution-of-albania-article-10-state-and-religion|title=Constitution of Albania, Article 10: State and Religion|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ottoman Era=== 
[[File:Sami Frasheri with his wife Emine.jpg|thumb|right|200x200px|Sami Frashëri with his wife]]
[[File:PashkoVasa.jpg|thumb|left|200x200px|Pashko Vasa]]
During [[Ottoman Albania|Ottoman era]], Albanians were divided by religion in the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet system]] in which the Muslims should use Sharia while the Christians would use Canon Law. [[Albanian nationalism]] as it emerged wanted to overcome the religious divisions among Albanians between members of the local [[Sunni Muslim]], [[Orthodox Christian]], [[Bektashi Order|Bektashi Muslim]] and [[Roman Catholic Christian]] communities since the Ottomans would use religion to divide them. Albanian nationalists argued that divisive sectarian religious fanaticism was alien to Albanian culture, and propagated what some historians refer to as a "'civic religion' of Albanianism".&lt;ref name="Duizings6162"&gt;Duijzings, Ger. "Religion and the Politics of 'Albanianism'". In Schwandler-Stevens and Jurgen, ''Albanian Identities: Myth and History''. Pages 61-62. Page 62: "nationalist rhetoric declared it [religion/millet] to be unimportant (and that religious fanaticism to be alien to the Albanian soul)", page 61:"From the beginning, national ideologists propagated a kind of 'civil religion' of Albanianism, which was epitomized in Pashko Vasa's famous and influential nationalist poem ''O moj Shqipni'' ("O poor Albania"): "Awaken, Albanians, wake from your slumber. Let us all be brothers, swear an oath not to mind church or mosque. The faith of the Albanian is Albanianism!'"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pashko Vasa]]'s famous poem ''[[O moj Shqypni]]'' told Albanians to "swear an oath not to mind [lit. "look to"] church or mosque" because "the faith of the Albanian is Albanianism"&lt;ref name="Duizings6162" /&gt; ({{lang-sq|feja e shqiptarit është shqiptaria}} or in {{lang-aln|Feja e shqyptarit asht shqyptarija}}).

[[Sami Frashëri]] in his 1899 work, ''"Shqipëria ç'ka qenë, ç'është dhe ç'do të bëhet"'', envisioned an Albania that would have no official religion and where education would be secular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.valbonanathanaili.com/shqiperia-cka-qene-ceshte-e-cdo-te-behete-nga-sami-frasheri/|title=Tirana Review of Books {{!}}   Shqipëria ç’ka qenë, ç’është e ç’do të bëhetë Nga Sami Frashëri|website=www.valbonanathanaili.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independence and Zogist Era===

[[File:Ahmet-Zogu-1895---1961.jpg|thumb|upright|170px|[[Zog I of Albania|King Zog I]] supported strong secularist policies.]]

After Albania became Independent in 1912, the government decided that the old Ottoman laws would still be in use until the government would pass new laws. But it was decided that [[Kadi (Ottoman Empire)|Kadis]] would only handle cases related to religion, while the civil cases would proceed but by state courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historia e Shtetit dhe e se Drejtes ne Shqiperi; Luarasi|last=|first=|publisher=University Press|year=2007|isbn=99927-856-8-3|location=Tirane|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Albanian Constitution of 1920 had no official religion and the separation of between the state and the religious communities was in the framework of the freedom of religion.

In 1924 the government led by [[Ahmet Zogolli]] (later King Zog) passed a decree in which the religious communities of Albania would be granted a special status that gave the state the right to monitor the ban of religious political activities. They would also have no jurisdiction in the Albanian state, no subsidies or relations with outside organisations or persons.

In 1928, a new constitution was put in force which proclaimed King Zog and abolished [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Canon Law and the Albanian customary law, adopting in their place a [[civil code]] based on the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] one, as [[Ataturk]]'s Turkey had done in the same decade. The new constitution declared:&lt;ref name="arkivi.peshkupauje.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arkivi.peshkupauje.com/node/36654|title=Politika e Mbretit Zog I per laicizimin dhe modernizimin e shtetit {{!}} Peshku pa ujë|website=arkivi.peshkupauje.com|language=sq|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|The Albanian State has no [[official religion]]. All religions and religious beliefs are respected and their free &lt;br&gt;practice is guaranteed. Religion in no way can be used as a prohibition or legal obstacle of any kind. &lt;br&gt;Religion and religious beliefs can not be used in any way for the realization of political purposes.}}

In a 1929 congress, the Muslim community, under pressure from the government, decreed that only Albanian would be the language of religion and that most of the mosques would be closed. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arkivi.peshkupauje.com/node/36654|title=Politika e Mbretit Zog I per laicizimin dhe modernizimin e shtetit {{!}} Peshku pa ujë|website=arkivi.peshkupauje.com|language=sq|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930 the Albanian Ministry of Education passed a decree which forces religious communities to finance their own religious schools and lessons. The law hit the Muslim community hard because they could not finance them, and as a result of it in 1938 there were only 2-3 [[madrasa]]s left in all of Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dritaislame.al/medresete-ne-shqiperi-gjate-viteve-1924-1947/|title=Medresetë në Shqipëri gjatë viteve 1924-1947|website=www.dritaislame.al|access-date=2017-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1933 until 1936 all [[private school]]s were banned, which in practice meant that Catholic schools could not operate in Albania. The government of Zog was forced to backtrack after Italian and international pressure.&lt;ref name="arkivi.peshkupauje.com"/&gt;

===Italian and Germany occupation=== 
The relations with the state and the religious communities improved after the 1939 occupation, since both the Italians and the Germans wanted to have good relations with the religious communities of Albania. During the occupation a limited number of religious lessons were maintained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edmondsharka.al/medresete-ne-shqiperi-gjate-viteve-1924-1947/|title=Medresetë në Shqipëri gjatë viteve 1924-1947 - Edmond Sharka|date=2013-11-12|work=Edmond Sharka|access-date=2017-07-31|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Communist Albania|communist era]], Albania transitioned from a simple secular state to, in 1967, an entity upholding [[state atheism]] by which all public practice of religion was banned, although some private practice survived.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2000 99,109"&gt;{{citation|first=Miranda |last=Vickers|first2= James|last2=Pettifer|publisher=NYU Press|year=2000|isbn=081478805X|title=Albania: From Anarchy to a Balkan Identity|pages=99,109|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Gm8TCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Enver Hoxha]] exploited Pashko Vasa's ''O moj Shqypni'' and implemented its stanza "the faith of the Albanians is Albanianism" literally as state policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trix|first=Frances|title=The Resurfacing of Islam in Albania|url=https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-16362015/the-resurfacing-of-islam-in-albania|journal=East European Quarterly|volume=28|issue=4|year=1994|page=536|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crawshaw|first=Robert|chapter=The file on H.

====1946-1967====
The [[Land reform in Albania|Agrarian Reform Law]] of August 1946 nationalized most property of religious institutions, including the estates of monasteries, orders, and dioceses. Many clergy and believers were tried, tortured, and executed, and all foreign Roman Catholic priests, monks, and nuns were expelled.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-186.html|title=Albania – Hoxha's Antireligious Campaign|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religious communities or branches that had their headquarters outside the country, such as the [[Jesuit]] and [[Franciscan]] orders, were henceforth ordered to terminate their activities in Albania.

Religious institutions were forbidden to have anything to do with the education of the young, because that had been made the exclusive province of the state. All religious communities were prohibited from owning real estate and from operating philanthropic and welfare institutions and hospitals.
Although there were tactical variations in First Secretary of the Communist Party Enver Hoxha's approach to each of the major denominations, his overarching objective was the eventual destruction of all organized religion in Albania. Between 1945 and 1953, the number of priests was reduced drastically and the number of Roman Catholic churches was decreased from 253 to 100, and all Catholics were stigmatized as fascists.&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt;

====Total ban on religion beginning in 1967 ====
Beginning in 1967 the Albanian authorities began a violent campaign to try to eliminate religious life in Albania. Despite complaints, even by [[Party of Labour of Albania]] members, all churches, mosques, [[tekkes]], monasteries, and other religious institutions were either closed down or converted into warehouses, gymnasiums, or workshops by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-170.html|title=Albania – The Cultural and Ideological Revolution|publisher=|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 1967, religious institutions had been forced to relinquish all 2,169 churches, mosques, cloisters, and shrines in Albania, many of which were converted into cultural centres for young people. As the literary monthly Nëndori reported the event, the youth had thus "created the first atheist nation in the world."&lt;ref name="country-data.com"/&gt; A major center for anti-religious propaganda was the National Museum of Atheism ({{lang-al|Muzeu Ateist}}) in Shkodër, the city viewed by the government as the most religiously conservative.&lt;ref name="Vickers 2000 99,109"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Mentor|last=Mustafa|chapter=What Remained of Religion in an "Atheist" State and the Return of Religion in Post-Communist Albania|editor1-last=Repič|editor1-first=Jaka|editor2-last=Bartulović|editor2-first=Alenka|editor3-last=Sajovec Altshul|editor3-first=Katarina|title=MESS and RAMSES II.

====Lift of the ban ==== 
After the death of [[Enver Hoxha]] in 1985, his successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], adopted a relatively tolerant stance toward religious practice, referring to it as "a personal and family matter." Émigré clergymen were permitted to reenter the country in 1988 and officiate at religious services. [[Mother Teresa]], an ethnic Albanian, visited Tirana in 1989, where she was received by the foreign minister and by Hoxha's widow. In December 1990, the ban on religious observance was officially lifted, in time to allow thousands of Christians to attend Christmas services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-187.html|title=Albania – The Revival of Religion|publisher=Country Data|accessdate=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constitutional principles==

The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, and the Government generally respects this right. There is no official religion and all religions are equal; however, the predominant religious communities (Sunni Muslim, Bektashi, Orthodox, and Catholic) enjoy a greater degree of official recognition (e.g., national holidays) and social status based on their historical presence in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/256369.pdf|title=ALBANIA 2015 INTERNATIONAL RELIGIOUS FREEDOM REPORT|last=|first=|date=|work=United States Department of State • Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Albanian constitution (from 1998) stipulates that:

# In the Republic of Albania there is no official religion.
# The state is neutral on questions of belief and conscience and guarantees the freedom of their expression in public life.
# The state recognizes the equality of religious communities. 
# The state and the religious communities mutually respect the independence of one another and work together for the good of each and all.
# Relations between the state and religious communities are regulated on the basis of agreements entered into between their representatives and the Council of  Ministers. These agreements are ratified by the Assembly.
# Religious communities are juridical persons. They have independence in the administration of their properties according to their principles, rules and canons, to the extent that interests of third parties are not infringed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/quotes/constitution-of-albania-article-10-state-and-religion|title=Constitution of Albania, Article 10: State and Religion|website=berkleycenter.georgetown.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debates about secularism == 
Generally in Albanian society secularism is considered very important and the guarantor of religious tolerance and coexistence. However, there have been public debates about its scope and how encompassing it should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.idk-al.org/pdf/Broshura_f_e.pdf|title=Feja, laiciteti dhe hapësira publike|last=|first=|date=September 2011 – June 2012|work=Friedrich Ebert Stiftung|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious symbols in schools ===

The Albanian government in 2011 wanted to pass a new education law that would prohibit religious symbols in the schools. This promoted new debates about the secularity of education and about possible religious discrimination since they could ban the [[hijab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/sq/projektligj-diskriminues-debati-p%C3%ABr-simbolet-fetare-n%C3%AB-shkollat-shqiptare/a-14773064|title=Projektligj diskriminues?

In a 2011 Ipsos poll in Albania, 53.6% of those who responded "fully supported" a ban on religious symbols in public schools, while 20.7% supported it to "some extent" and 21.5% were opposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=Nation building - Albania|url=http://www.hf.uio.no/ilos/forskning/prosjekter/nation-w-balkan/dokumenter/nb_albania-wine-summer.pdf|journal=Ipsos|volume=|pages=50 p.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion classes in state schools ===

The Ministry of Education asserts that public schools in the country are secular and that the law prohibits ideological and religious indoctrination. Religion generally is not taught in public schools but there have been attempts to include religion in education.&lt;ref name="State Dept"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2004/35434.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2004: Albania|year=2004|publisher=[[United States Department of State]]|accessdate=2 June 2017}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the religious communities proposed an inclusion of a subject about "Religious culture" in pre-university education and they gained the support the then minister of education, Myqerem Tafaj. This incited strong debates about the nature of subject, with questions regarding whether it was permissible by the constitution and what impact it could have.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arkivi.peshkupauje.com/2012/04/lende-fetare-ne-shkolla-tafaj-pranon-kerkesen-e|title=Lëndë fetare në shkolla, Tafaj pranon kërkesën e klerikëve {{!}} Peshku pa ujë|website=arkivi.peshkupauje.com|language=sq|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the government of [[Edi Rama]] proposed to have lessons about "History of Religion" which according to the Education Minister, [[Lindita Nikolla]] "would not entail religious proselytizing". A pilot project about this new religious school subject started being implemented in the second semester of 2016-2017  in some schools for 6th and 10th graders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.syri.net/sociale/37610/video-ne-shkollat-shqiptare-ka-nisur-mesimi-i-fese/|title=VIDEO/ Në shkollat shqiptare ka nisur mësimi i fesë|date=2017-02-06|work=Syri {{!}} Lajmi i fundit|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Six of Swords''' is a card used in Latin suited playing cards which include [[tarot|tarot decks]]. It is part of what [[tarot reading|tarot card readers]] call the "[[Minor Arcana]]"

Tarot cards are used throughout much of [[Europe]] to play [[tarot card games]].&lt;ref name="DummettGame"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[English language|English]]-speaking countries, where the games are largely unknown, Tarot cards came to be utilized primarily for [[Tarot reading|divinatory]] purposes.&lt;ref name="DummettGame" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [[Paul Huson|Huson, Paul]], (2004) ''Mystical Origins of the Tarot: From Ancient Roots to Modern Usage'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-190-0}}

==Symbolism==
The card is sometimes seen as depicting the [[Slough of Despond]] from [[The Pilgrim's Progress]].
Upright it can mean: gradual change, movement, or travel away from difficulty or imminent danger; the solution of current problems; long journeys and passage from pain; or obstacles which are overcome. It may also be a suggestion of interpenetrating worlds, and changing channels from one set of perceptions to another.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Ganther and Stevee Postman, (1998) ''The Cosmic Tribe Tarot'', Vermont: Destiny Books, {{ISBN|0-89281-700-3}}, pp.78-79&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Temple of Bel''' ({{lang-ar|معبد بل}}), sometimes also referred to as the "Temple of [[Baal]]", was an ancient temple located in [[Palmyra]], [[Syria]]. The temple, consecrated to the [[Mesopotamia]]n god [[Bel (mythology)|Bel]], worshipped at Palmyra in triad with the lunar god [[Aglibol]] and the sun god [[Yarhibol]], formed the center of religious life in [[Palmyra]] and was dedicated in [[32 AD]].&lt;ref name="Gates"&gt;Gates, 2003, p.390&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaizer"&gt;Kaizer, p.67.&lt;/ref&gt;  The temple would have been closed during the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]] in a campaign against the temples of the East made by [[Maternus Cynegius]], [[Praetorian Prefect]] of Oriens, between 25 May 385 to 19 March 388.&lt;ref name="Trombley"&gt;Trombley, ''[https://books.google.se/books?id=HZefAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA145&amp;lpg=PA145&amp;dq=statue+allat-athena&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=J8DvCAWQZN&amp;sig=6CwrxUq7hCUokhhLY5j60U_yebU&amp;hl=sv&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi11Zq2o6fbAhXkIJoKHU-fB3EQ6AEITTAM#v=onepage&amp;q=statue%20allat-athena&amp;f=false  Hellenic Religion and Christianization c. 370-529]''&lt;/ref&gt;      Its ruins were considered among the best preserved at Palmyra,&lt;ref&gt;Cremin, p.187.&lt;/ref&gt; until they were further destroyed by the [[Islamic State of Iraq and Syria]] in August 2015.&lt;ref name=BBC-09-01/&gt; The arched main entrance into the temple is still intact,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Vigilo|last=Domingo|first=Plácido|author-link=Plácido Domingo|title=End the International Destruction of Cultural Heritage|date=December 2016|publisher=[[Din l-Art Ħelwa]]: National Trust of Malta|pages=30-31|issue=48|issn=1026-132X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its exterior walls and fortified gate.

==History==
[[File:PALMYRA Tempio di Baal particolare del fregio con sfilata degli dei - GAR - 6-057.jpg|thumb|left|Relief at the courtyard of the temple showing detailed ornaments and depictions of Palmyrene war deities]]
The temple was built on a [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] with [[Stratification (archeology)|stratification]] indicating human occupation that goes back to the third millennium BC. The area was occupied in pre-[[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods with a former temple that is usually referred to as "the first temple of Bel" and "the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] temple". The walls of the [[temenos]] and [[propylaea]] were constructed in the late first and the first half of the second century AD. The names of three Greeks who worked on the construction of the temple of Bel are known through inscriptions, including a probably Greek architect named Alexandras ({{lang-gr|Αλεξάνδρας}}).&lt;ref name="groks"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stoneman |first=Richard |date=1994 |title=Palmyra and Its Empire: Zenobia's Revolt Against Rome |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=9780472083152 |page=54 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8kLFfE1qPhIC&amp;pg=PA54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Alcock |first=Susan E. |date=1997 |title=The Early Roman Empire in the East |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |location=Ann Arbor, MI |isbn=9781900188524 |page=157 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Early_Roman_Empire_in_the_East.html?id=DxQMAQAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many Palmyrenes adopted Greco-Roman names and native citizens with the name Alexander are attested in the city.&lt;ref name="namo"&gt;{{cite book |last=Yon |first=Jean-Baptiste |date=2002 |title=Les notables de Palmyre |publisher=Institut français d'archéologie du Proche-Orient |isbn=9782912738196 |pages=10,59 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Les_notables_de_Palmyre.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Temple of Bel was converted into a Christian church during the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Era]].&lt;ref name="Browning 1979"&gt;{{cite book |last=Browning |first=Iain |date=1979 |title=Palmyra |publisher=Noyes Press |isbn=9780815550549 |page=168 |quote=Like the Temple of Bel, the Baal Shamin was converted into a church during the Byzantine period.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the structure were modified by Arabs in 1132 which preserved the structure and converted the Temple into a mosque. The enormous temple courtyard (approx. 200 x 200 meters) held mud-brick houses among the ruins, and served as a fortified citadel for the village of [[Palmyra]] (known as Tadmur during the 1100s). The mosque in the temple proper and the dwellings remained in use until the 1920s when Franco-Syrian archaeological missions cleared the temple grounds of its postclassical elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Frances Terpak and Peter Louis Bonfitto|title=Temple of Bel|url=http://www.getty.edu/research/exhibitions_events/exhibitions/palmyra/index.html|website=The Legacy of Ancient Palmyra|publisher=The Getty Research Institute|accessdate=10 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yan|first1=Holly|title=How ISIS' demolition of a Syrian temple impacts the world|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/09/01/middleeast/syria-palmyra-temple-consequences/|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=CNN|date=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] columns of the inner [[colonnade]]s still showed pedestals where the statues of the benefactors stood.&lt;ref name="Kaizer"/&gt; The temple was aligned along the eastern end of the [[Great Colonnade at Palmyra]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Columns in the inner court of the Bel Temple Palmyra Syria.JPG|thumb|left|Columns in the inner court of the temple]]

The temple showed a remarkable synthesis of [[ancient Near East]]ern and [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman architecture]].&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; The temple remains lay inside a large [[precinct]] lined by [[porticos]]. It had a rectangular shape and was oriented north-south.&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt; It was based on a paved court surrounded by a massive {{convert|205|m|ft|adj=on}} long wall with a [[propylaea|propylaeum]]. On a [[podium]] in the middle of the [[Courtyard|court]] was the actual temple building. The [[cella]] was entirely surrounded by a [[prostyle]] of Corinthian columns, only interrupted on the long side by an entrance gate with large steps leading from the court. The cella was unique in the fact that it had two inner sanctuaries, the north and south [[adyton]]s, dedicated as the shrines of Bel and other local deities. The northern chamber was known for a [[Relief|bas-relief]] carving of the [[Astrology of sect|seven planets]] known to the ancients surrounded by the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]] and the carvings of a procession of camels and veiled women.&lt;ref name="embassy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Temple of Bel |publisher=Syrian Embassy in the United States |url=http://www.syrianembassy.us/Aboutsyria/temple_of_bel.htm |accessdate=31 August 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715065316/http://www.syrianembassy.us/Aboutsyria/temple_of_bel.htm |archivedate=15 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cella was lit by two pairs of windows cut high in the two long walls.&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaizer"/&gt; In three corners of the building stairwells could be found that led up to rooftop terraces.&lt;ref name="Gates"/&gt;

In the court there were the remains of a [[Sink|basin]], an [[altar]], a dining hall, and a building with [[Niche (architecture)|niches]]. And in the northwest corner lay a ramp along which [[Animal sacrifice|sacrificial animals]] were led into the temple area.&lt;ref name="Kaizer"/&gt; There were three monumental gateways, of which the entry was through the west gate. These were modified by the [[Arab]]s in 1132 when they erected a [[bastion]], and the temple was converted into a [[mosque]],&lt;ref name="embassy"/&gt; which preserved it from further dilapidation.

Syria's Director of Antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim stated that ISIL was looking for treasures and "stores of gold" in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=19 August 2015 |title=Syrian archaeologist 'killed in Palmyra' by IS militants |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-33984006 |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 30 August 2015, the [[Associated Press]] reported that ISIL had partially demolished the temple by explosives, citing eyewitness accounts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Westall |first=Sylvia |date=30 August 2015 |title=Islamic State destroys part of Syria's Temple of Bel – monitors |work=Reuters UK |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2015/08/30/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-bel-idUKKCN0QZ0XO20150830}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=30 August 2015 |title=СМИ: боевики ИГ подорвали Храм Бэла на территории сирийской Пальмиры |language=Russian |work=[[RIA Novosti]] |url=http://ria.ru/world/20150830/1217983802.html |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bricks and columns were reported as lying on the ground and only one wall was reported as remaining, according to a Palmyra resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 Aug 2015 |title=Syria's Palmyra Temple of Bel 'severely damaged' by IS |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34103994 |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 August 2015 |title=IS Partially Destroys Temple Of Bel – Reports |work=[[Sky News]] |url=http://news.sky.com/story/1544154/is-partially-destroys-temple-of-bel-reports |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The damage was also attested by the [[Syrian Observatory for Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Activists: ISIL damages ancient temple in Syria's Palmyra |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2015/08/30/isil-damages-palmyra-temple/71428468/ |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=Associated Press |date=30 August 2015 |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim later stated that although there was an explosion within the temple's perimeter, "the basic structure is still standing".&lt;ref name=bbc2015-08-31&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=31 August 2015 |title=Palmyra's Temple of Bel 'still standing' |work=[[BBC News]] |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34110717 |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these reports were proved to be incorrect. 

On August 31, 2015 the [[United Nations]] confirmed the temple's destruction after reviewing satellite imagery, "We can confirm destruction of the main building of the Temple of Bel as well as a row of columns in its immediate vicinity" reported by the [[United Nations Institute for Training and Research]] (UNITAR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Barnard |first1=Anne |last2=Saad |first2=Hwaida |date=2015-08-31 |title=Palmyra Temple Was Destroyed by ISIS, U.N.

The main entrance arch survived the destruction of the temple. The [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] proposed that replicas of this arch be installed in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]] and [[Times Square]], [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gayle|first1=Damien|title=Palmyra arch that survived Isis to be replicated in London and New York|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/palmyra-temple-bel-arch-survived-isis-syria-london-new-york|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109093409/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/28/palmyra-temple-bel-arch-survived-isis-syria-london-new-york|archivedate=9 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later decided that instead of the temple's main entrance, the replica would be of part of the [[Monumental Arch of Palmyra|Monumental Arch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Nigel|title=Why the Arch of Triumph of Palmyra is being recreated in London - 1,800 years after it was built|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/04/08/why-the-arch-of-triumph-of-palmyra-is-being-recreated-in-london/|work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=8 April 2016|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration===
Following the [[Palmyra offensive (March 2016)|recapture of Palmyra]] by the Syrian Army in March 2016, director of antiquities Maamoun Abdelkarim stated that the Temple of Bel, along with the [[Temple of Baalshamin]] and the Monumental Arch, will be rebuilt using the surviving remains ([[anastylosis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shaheen|first1=Kareem|last2=Graham-Harrison|first2=Emma|title=Syrian regime forces retake 'all of Palmyra' from Isis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/syrian-regime-forces-retake-all-of-palmyra-from-isis|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=27 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160327092726/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/27/syrian-regime-forces-retake-all-of-palmyra-from-isis|archivedate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISIL recaptured the city on 11 December,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.alaraby.co.uk/english/news/2016/12/11/islamic-state-recaptures-palmyra-after-syria-army-withdrawal|title=Islamic State recaptures Palmyra after Syria army withdrawal|publisher=The New Arab}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the Syrian Army retook it on 2 March 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-palmyra-syria-driven-out-second-time-islamic-state-ancient-roman-ruins-assad-executions-a7607351.html|title=Isis driven out of ancient Syrian city of Palmyra for second time|first=Lizzie|last=Dearden|date=2 March 2017|publisher=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the French company "Art Graphique et Patrimoine" travelled to Palmyra and scanned the Temple's rubble in order to create a plan for its restoration. &lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://dgam.gov.sy/index.php?d=314&amp;id=2310|title=Scientific Cooperation Project with (Art Graphique &amp; Patrimoine Co.)|accessdate=27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Treatise on the Gods''''' (1930) is [[H. L. Mencken]]'s survey of the history and philosophy of [[religion]], and was intended as an unofficial companion volume to his [[Treatise on Right and Wrong]] (1934).&lt;ref&gt;https://openlibrary.org/b/OL14380373M/Treatise_on_right_and_wrong&lt;/ref&gt; The first and second printings were sold out before publication, and eight more printings followed.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', preface to the Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first edition received a major 5-column review in the ''[[New York Times]]'', written by one P.W. Wilson;&lt;ref&gt;See the NYT online archive&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic [[Granville Hicks]] called it "the best popular account we have of the origin and nature of religion." However, the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] theologian [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], writing in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', claimed that "It is only in dealing with moral and social issues that [Mencken] achieves the heights of complete detachment, and in this case the detachment is that of a cynic rather than that of a scientist." By the end of its first year ''Treatise'' had sold thirteen thousand copies.&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1940 its popularity had waned, and although it went temporarily out of print in 1945, Mencken considered it "my best book, and by far."&lt;ref&gt;''The Skeptic: A Life of H. L. Mencken'', by [[Terry Teachout]]&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of its original publisher [[Alfred A Knopf]], Mencken wrote a revised edition (1946), eliminating (among other changes) a controversial quote about [[Jews]]:

:The Jews could be put down very plausibly as the most unpleasant race ever heard of. As commonly encountered, they lack many of the qualities that mark the civilized man: courage, dignity, incorruptibility, ease, confidence. They have vanity without pride, voluptuousness without taste, and learning without wisdom. Their fortitude, such as it is, is wasted upon puerile objects, and their charity is mainly a form of display.&lt;ref&gt;''Treatise on the Gods'', 1930, pp. 345–46&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after publication the ''[[New York Times]]'' published another review, this one by [[Philip Wylie]] and accompanied by a [[caricature]] of Mencken by [[Miguel Covarrubias|Covarrubias]]. Wylie referred to the book as a "[[Tourbillon (disambiguation)|tourbillon]] by the [[Burgrave]] of [[Baltimore]]". Two more editions of the book followed, in 1997 and 2006.

The '''[[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]''' (sometimes formerly referred to as the Huron) are a [[First Nations]]/[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people originally from [[Ontario]], Canada, and surrounding areas.

The [[shaman]]s of a Wyandot tribe were called '''Arendiwane''' (or '''Arendi wane''', '''Orendi wane''').

According to Wyandot mythology, ''Iosheka'' created the first [[man]] and [[woman]] and taught them many skills, including all their religious ceremonies and rituals, the ability to fight evil spirits, healing, and the use of the [[sacrament]] of [[tobacco]].
