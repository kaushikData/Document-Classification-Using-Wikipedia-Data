'''Anamorphosis''' or '''Anamorphogenesis''' refers to postembryonic development and [[moulting]] in [[Arthropoda]] that results in the addition of [[abdominal]] body segments, even after sexual maturity. An example of this occurs in [[protura]]ns and [[millipede]]s.

Anamorphosis has been depicted various times throughout early modern literature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Anamorphosis In Early Modern Literature|last=Boyle|first=Jen|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Limited|year=2010|isbn=|location=Farnham, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3608">The '''aquifer properties''' of the aquifer essentially depend upon the composition of the [[aquifer]]. The most important properties of the aquifer are [[porosity]] and specific yield which in turn give its capacity to release the water in the pores and its ability to transmit the flow with ease.
==Porosity==
In [[soil mechanics]] and [[hydrology]], porosity is defined as the ratio of volume of voids to the total volume of porous medium. Mathematically it can be represented by the equation expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;n = \frac{V_V}{V_T} = \frac{V_V}{V_S + V_V} = \frac{e}{1 + e}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is void ratio, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is [[porosity]], ''V''&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of void-space (air and water), ''V''&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; is the volume of solids, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is the total or bulk volume of medium.&lt;ref&gt; Craig, R. F. ''Craig's Soil Mechanics.'' London: Spon, 2004, p.18. {{ISBN|0-203-49410-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The significance of the porosity is that it gives the idea of [[water]] storage capacity of the aquifer. Qualitatively, porosity less than 5% is considered to be small, between 5 and 20% as medium and the percentage exceeding 20% is considered as large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geol.lsu.edu/Faculty/Nunn/gl4182/Fetter_Ch4.html | title=Properties of Aquifers | accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific yield==
Porosity gives a measure of the water storage capability of [[soil]] but not all the water present in the soil pores is available for extraction by pumping for the use of humans or draining by [[gravity]]. The pores in the soil hold back sufficient quantity of water on account of forces like [[surface tension]] and molecular attraction. Hence the actual amount of water that can be extracted from the unit volume of aquifer by pumping or under the action of gravity is called as specific yield. The fraction of water held back in the aquifer is known as specific retention. Thus it can be said that porosity is the sum of specific yield and specific retention. Specific yield of soils differ from each other in the sense that some soil types have strong molecular attraction with the water held in their pores while others have less. It is found experimentally that cohessionless soils have high specific yield than cohesive soils because the former has significantly less molecular attraction then the latter. Coarse-grained soils or rocks such as coarse [[sandstone]] can have specific yields that are closer to their actual porosity in the range 20 to 35%. The case of fine grained materials is quite opposite to that range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Engineering_Hydrology.html?id=URaFZvATAcEC | title=Engineering Hydrology | publisher=McGraw Hill Education (India) | author=K Subramanya | authorlink=Groundwater | year=2014 | pages=394}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.viu.ca/earle/geol304/geol-304-b.pdf | title=Specific retention and Specific yield | accessdate=6 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the table above, [[sand]] and [[gravel]] though having less porosity than clay yield much more than clay because of relatively less molecular attraction and coarse size of particles.

The '''C. N. Yang Institute of Theoretical Physics (YITP)''' is a research center at [[Stony Brook University]]. In 1965, it was the vision of then University President [[John S. Toll|J.S. Toll]] and Physics Department chair T.A. Pond to create an institute for theoretical physics and invite the famous physicist [[Chen Ning Yang]] from [[Institute for Advanced Study]] to serve as its director with the Albert Einstein Professorship of Physics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://insti.physics.sunysb.edu/~yang/yangbio.pdf Biography of C.N. Yang]&lt;/ref&gt; While the center is often referred to as "YITP", this can be confusing as YITP also stands for the [[Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in Japan.  

The active research areas of the institute include: [[Quantum Field Theory]], [[String Theory]], [[Mathematical Physics]] and [[Statistical Mechanics]]. The YITP is situated on top of the Math Tower, home to the Department of Mathematics which is connected to the Department of Physics and the [[Simons Center for Geometry and Physics]] -- therefore the physicists enjoy intimate interactions with the mathematicians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.sunysb.edu/html/rtgrtg.shtml RTG Program in Geometry and Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; This close relationship dates back to the friendship of [[C.N. Yang]] and the mathematician [[James Harris Simons]].

Founded in 1967, YITP celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2017. During the time span, the YITP has produced significant results in different areas, most notably was the discovery of [[Supergravity]] in 1976 by [[Peter van Nieuwenhuizen]], [[Daniel Z. Freedman]], and [[Sergio Ferrara]], who were all working there at the time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11198">The '''Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health''' ('''CSCHAH''') is an infectious disease laboratory complex in [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] owned and operated by the Government of Canada. This modern facility is home to two laboratories: The [[Public Health Agency of Canada]]'s [[National Microbiology Laboratory]] (NML) and the [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]]'s [[National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease]] (NCFAD). It is the workplace of approximately 500 federal employees.

While most of the laboratory space is dedicated to Containment Level 2 (also known as Biosafety Level 2) and Containment Level 3 laboratories, CSCHAH is the only facility in Canada operating Containment Level 4 (CL4) laboratories and is believed to be the first in the world to have both human and animal Level 4 laboratories under one roof. Level 4 laboratories are designed to allow scientists to safely handle the most serious infectious agents. Their design, construction, and engineering controls safeguard against the release of any infectious material.

Both NML and NCFAD operate critical diagnostic testing programs relied on across the country. These programs protect human health, animal health, and international trade. Staff also undertake cutting-edge research to advance scientific knowledge, improve diagnostics and develop therapeutics to protect health.

== History ==

In the 1980's, both [[Agriculture Canada]] (prior to the Canadian Food Inspection Agency being formed) and Health Canada identified the need to replace existing laboratory space that was reaching the end of its lifespan as well as the need for Containment Level 4 space in the country. Numerous benefits were identified for housing both laboratories in one building, including cost savings. Winnipeg was chosen as the site and an announcement was made in October 1987.

After some debate, the spot chosen for the site was a city works yard near to the [[Health Sciences Centre (Winnipeg)|Health Sciences Centre]] (a major teaching hospital) and the University of Manitoba's medical school. The City of Winnipeg transferred the title for $1. Construction of  the facility that came to be named the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health (often referred to locally as "the Virology Lab") began with an official groundbreaking in December 1992. The design team, headed by the Winnipeg-based Smith Carter Architects and Engineers Inc., visited laboratories around the world to seek best practices in containment and design. Construction finished toward the end of 1997, with the first programs beginning in the spring of 1998 following an extensive commissioning process. The rest of the laboratories then became operational one by one. The official opening took place in 1999.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074113/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_81_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, the laboratories in the facility have been instrumental in responding to a number of significant infectious disease outbreaks: The 2003 SARS outbreak when NML led the laboratory response; the 2003 BSE case when NCFAD provided the diagnosis of the initial case and then undertook testing as part of a vast investigation; the 2004 avian influenza outbreak in BC for which NCFAD led the laboratory investigation; and the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza where Mexico sought help from NML in identifying the unknown respiratory pathogen. Most recently, NML's involvement in the response to the West African Ebola outbreak. For a period of about 18 months, teams from NML travelled to West Africa to aid in the diagnostics during the outbreak. Their ongoing work on developing both a vaccine and treatment was fast-tracked into clinical trials during this period to help stop the outbreak.

== Co-location ==

The primary reason for housing the two laboratories in the same complex was economic. It saves the citizens of Canada money by only having one facility to operate with a number of shared services also keeping costs down. However, the partnership between these two world leading labs also allows for collaboration and cooperation on established, emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases. Many of the viruses, bacteria and prions studied at CSCHAH are zoonotic, meaning that they can transfer from animals to humans. Co-location of these labs allows scientists to work together on these shared challenges and to take advantage of each other's complementary expertise and unique resources. This model is held in high regard within the international containment laboratory community.

== Facility ==

CSCHAH is a state-of-the-art, 332,766 square foot complex. Built to exceed national and international standards, CSCHAH maintains its high level of excellence through ongoing maintenance and regular upgrades. The complex is built as a series of program-specific blocks interconnected by an area dedicated to common elements for both departments such as the library, cafeteria, and theatre.

CSCHAH houses laboratories to manage any type of infectious organism from the most common to the most exotic. Containment Level 2 (CL2) laboratories are the same as what can be found at a hospital or doctor's office; 60.8% of CSCHAH lab space is dedicated to level 2.  Containment Level 3 involves specific engineering controls and protocols to ensure the safety of lab staff, the public and the environment; 35.5% of CSCHAH lab space is CL3 space, the majority of which is dedicated to animal pathogens. Although the facility is thought of as a "Level 4 facility," only 3.7% of lab space is used for CL4. Level 4, with its special construction and biosafety suits, is necessary to work with the most serious of pathogens including Ebola, Nipah, and Marburg.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/blk-acb/lbg-ldmbl-eng.php Laboratory Biosafety Guidelines 3rd Edition - 2004] .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="three"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/sci/bio/anima/convet/convet1-3e.shtml#a2   Animal Pathogen Containment Levels], .&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the SARS outbreak in 2003, lessons learned resulted in a number of changes to public health in Canada. Among those were the creation of the Public Health Agency of Canada &lt;ref name="four"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213075940/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/2004/2004_47_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt; and the construction of a high-tech operations centre at CSCHAH. This operations centre is the hub of the National Microbiology Laboratory when there is an outbreak or a deployment of personnel off-site. It is equipped with three separate phone systems, can videoconference with 38 participants at a time, and can connect via satellite to remote locations around the world. Virtually all staff at NML are trained in the Incident Command System and are able to jump into action at a moment's notice if there is a public health event of some type.

A three-story expansion to the building was completed in 2011. The expanded and renovated areas include specimen receiving, shipping and receiving, bio-repository, media preparation, office, and meeting space.&lt;ref name="five"&gt;[http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/media/nr-cp/2009/0508a-eng.asp News Release].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Safety ==

CSCHAH was designed for safety; it was built to meet or exceed all national and international standards. The construction, engineering controls and sterilization systems are geared toward the highest level of safety.

Safety is of paramount importance to everyone working in the facility. Extensive Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are in place and everyone is well-trained for the specific area they work in. A Safety and Environmental Services (SES) team provides numerous "hands-on" demonstrations and presentations on biosafety and occupational health and safety throughout the year and provides 24/7 response to biological or chemical issues.

Any material exiting the level 3 or 4 laboratories must be sterilized or decontaminated in some manner. Air is drawn into the laboratories through the use of negative air pressure before being filtered out through High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filters. Laboratory waste such as gloves, test tubes, and pipette tips are removed via an autoclave, a piece of equipment that sterilizes materials with steam and pressure. Any liquids leaving the high-containment space go through a biowaste system that operates like a large autoclave to sterilize it. The high-containment labs are built as a box-in-a-box; they do not border exterior walls and there are mechanical spaces above and below them.

== Security ==

CSCHAH is a high-security facility. Security staff work closely with local police, RCMP and CSIS to ensure an appropriate level of security at all times. Only the lobby area is open to the public; all guests must be escorted within the secure area at all times. All staff working in the facility have Secret Level II security clearance.

== Community Liaison Committee ==

The Community Liaison Committee to the Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health was struck by the ministers of Health and Agriculture in 1999.&lt;ref name="six"&gt;[https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/webarchives/20071213074758/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ahc-asc/media/nr-cp/1999/1999_103_e.html News Release].&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's first meeting took place in January 2000. It was to create a basis for and to maintain an atmosphere of public trust and confidence between the centre and the community.
 
The committee consists of volunteer members representing a wide range of organizations including community residents, scientists, health care professionals, and agricultural professionals. The committee meets at least four times per year, holds regular public information sessions and issues reports on their activities. Other laboratories have modelled this approach. 
At the committee's request, CSCHAH developed reporting guidelines to determine the extent of communication around any incidents that may take place at the centre. This ensures that the committee and others are apprised of incidents of any significance in a timely manner plus they have access to information on each and every incident no matter how minor, at their meetings.

'''Esri CityEngine''' is a [[three-dimensional]] (3D) [[3d modeling|model]]ing software application developed by [[Esri]] R&amp;D Center Zurich (formerly Procedural Inc.) and is specialized in the generation of 3D [[urban environment]]s. With the [[procedural modeling]] approach, CityEngine supports the creation of detailed large-scale 3D city models. CityEngine works with architectural object placement and arrangement in the same manner that [[E-on Vue|VUE]] manages terrain, ecosystems and atmosphere mapping. Unlike the traditional 3D modeling methodology which is using [[Computer-aided design|Computer-Aided Design (CAD)]] tools, CityEngine improves the shape generation via the rule-based system and data sets—similar as the [[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System (GIS)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nae-Young|first=Choei|date=April 1, 2016|title=Procedural Modeling of a Residential Site Using the Interoperability between the GIS and CityEngine|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=15f46927-cb0a-4a18-b27b-987a24d250a4%40sessionmgr4009&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ%3d%3d#AN=115375340&amp;db=aci|journal=GSTF Journal of Engineering Technology|volume=3| issue = 4|pages=4–10|via=Applied Science &amp; Technology Source}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this dominant feature, CityEngine has been broadly used in academic research or building virtual environments, e.g., [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[game development]], [[entertainment]], [[GIS]], [[archeology]], and [[cultural heritage]]. After being integrated with the [[Building information modeling|Building Information Model (BIM)]], CityEngine can visualize the data of buildings in a larger urban context, enhancing its working scenario toward real construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.esri.com/esri/arcgis/2016/09/22/bim-gis-integration-with-ifc/|title=BIM-GIS Integration with IFC|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and releases==

=== Developer ===
In 2007, Procedural Inc. was founded and separated from [[ETH Zurich]], the top-ranking technology university in Switzerland. In the summer of 2011([http://www.esri.com/news/releases/11-3qtr/esri-acquires-3d-software-company-procedural.html]), Procedural Inc. was acquired by [[Esri|Esri Inc]] and became [[Esri]] R&amp;D Center Zurich, continually studying in the fields of [[computer graphics]], [[computer vision]], software engineering, finance, marketing, and business.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.linkedin.com/company/procedural-inc./|title=Procedural Inc. LinkedIn Home Page|last=|first=|date=|website=linkedin|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software ===
CityEngine was developed at [[ETH Zurich]] by the original author Pascal Mueller, co-founder and CEO of Procedural Inc. During his PhD research at [http://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/ ETH Computer Vision Lab], Mueller invented a number of techniques for [[procedural modeling]] of 3D architectural content which make up the foundation of CityEngine. Since CityEngine's public debut in the 2001 [[Siggraph]] conference,&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/felix11/OpenPCG/blob/master/literature/procedural_modeling_of_cities__siggraph2001.pdf ''Procedural Modeling of Cities'' - Yoav Parish and Pascal Mueller (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt; additional research papers have contributed to featuring CityEngine. In 2008, the first commercial version of CityEngine was released by the Swiss company Procedural Inc and was used by professionals in [[urban planning]], [[architecture]], [[Visualization (computer graphics)|visualization]], [[game development]], [[entertainment]], [[GIS]], [[archeology]], and [[cultural heritage]].

==Features==
'''Procedural Modeling Core (CGA Shape Grammar Language):''' CGA ([[computer generated architecture]]) rules allow to control mass, geometry assets, proportions, or texturing of buildings or streets on a citywide scale. (''More details can be seen in the "Procedural Modeling" section.'')

'''Get Map Data:''' Users can create a 3D urban environment in few minutes via the download helper; Users can select a target location and import geo-referenced satellite imagery and 3D terrain of that place. If they are available in the [[OpenStreetMap]] (OSM), the data of street and building footprint can be easily retrieved to build 3D models via default CGA rules.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/get-started/cityengine-2016-release-notes.htm|title=CityEngine 2016.0 release notes—Esri CityEngine {{!}} ArcGIS Desktop|website=desktop.arcgis.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GIS/CAD Data Support:''' Support for industry-standard formats such as Esri Shapefile, File Geodatabase and [[OpenStreetMap]] which allow to import/export any geo-spatial/vector data.

'''Parametric Modeling Interface:''' An interface to interactively control specific street or building parameters, such as the height or age (defined by the CGA rules)

'''Dynamic City Layouts:''' Interactive design, editing and modification of urban layouts consisting of (curved) streets, blocks and parcels.

'''Map-Controlled City Modeling:''' Global control of buildings and street parameters through image maps (for example the building heights or the landuse-mix).

'''Street Networks Patterns:''' Street grow tools to design and construct urban layouts.

'''Industry-Standard 3D Formats:''' CityEngine supports Collada, Autodesk FBX, 3DS, Wavefront OBJ, RenderMan RIB, mental ray MI and e-on software's Vue.

'''Custom Report Generation:''' Users can script and generate rule-based reports to show social-economic figures (e.g., [[Gross Floor Area]] (GFA), [[Floor area ratio|Floor Area Ratio]] (FAR)) and to analyze their urban design proposals.

'''3D Web Scene Export:''' The model built in CityEngine can be directly exported and then used to create a [[WebGL]] scene in a browser. The 3D environment in the web scene can be rotated, explored, compared and commented online by multiple users.

'''360 VR Experience:''' The scenarios of urban environments can be used to generate a series of panoramic photos for publishing them online. Users can look around by turning their heads in virtual reality (VR) headsets. (Currently, it only supports Samsung Oculus Gear)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehelp.esri.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.procedural.cityengine.help/html/manual/export/vr360/export_formats_3vr.html|title=360 VR Experience Helper page|last=|first=|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Python Scripting Interface:''' CityEngine provides ce.py as a built-in library.

'''Facade Wizard:''' Rule creator and visual facade authoring tool.

'''3D Format Support for Game Engines (VR/AR):''' Now the model built in CityEngine can be directly exported to Unreal Engine, with the loading capacity of tens of millions of polygons and tens of thousands of objects, as well as non-limited material textures. Meanwhile, exporting to Unity3D still requires users to use Autodesk [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]] as a transfer station.

'''Available for All Platforms:''' Available for Windows (64bit only), Mac OS X (64bit), and Linux (32/64bit).

==Procedural Modeling==
CityEngine uses a [[procedural modeling]] approach to automatically generate models through a predefined rule set. The rules are defined through a CGA [[shape grammar]] system enabling the creation of complex parametric models. Users can change or add the shape grammar as much as needed providing room for new designs.

Modeling an urban environment within CityEngine can start out with creating a street network either with the street drawing tool or with data imported from openstreetmap.org or from Esri data formats such as [[Shapefiles]] or [[File Geodatabase]]. The next step is to subdivide all the lots as many times as specified resulting in a map of lots and streets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.procedural.com/cityengine/examples/new-york-city-2259.html New York example]&lt;/ref&gt; By selecting all or some of the lots CityEngine can be instructed to start generating the buildings. Due to the procedural modeling technology, all buildings can be made to vary from one another to achieve an urban aesthetic. At this point the city model can be re-designed and adjusted by changing parameters or the shape grammar itself.

CGA Shape Grammar system can read Esri-Oracle format datasets directly, and it operates as a top-bottom generation tree: it generates complex components from simple Shapefiles polygons/poly-lines/points whereas each branch and leaf of the generation tree cannot interact with others. It is different than main-stream shape grammars like [[Grasshopper 3D|Grasshopper]] in [[Rhinoceros 3D]] and Dynamo in [[Autodesk Revit]].

== Relevant applications ==
Traditionally, building a 3D urban environment is very time-consuming resulted from numerous buildings and details of a city. Designers used CAD software to create shapes one by one, and researchers analyzed cities by computing 2D information in GIS (GIS only supports limited 3D shape generation like extrusion.) CityEngine's Procedural Modeling system makes it possible to generate complex 3D models via information massively, bringing a large number of relevant applications. It not only enhances the workflow of urban design/study/planning and merges to a new field of study called Geodesign (means using geospatial information to design a city), but also lowers the threshold of making city environments in game and movie industry.

===Geodesign===
Discussions on [[geodesign]] often mention the use of Esri CityEngine,&lt;ref&gt;http://video.esri.com/watch/2116/the-instant-citygeodesign-and-urban-planning&lt;/ref&gt; although it is not an analytical tool like [[GIS]]. As a crucial tool to enhance 3D shape generation in ArcGIS, Esri CityEngine is the critical product to improve the applicability of GeoDesign, using geospatial information to design or analyze a city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esri.com/products/arcgis-capabilities/geodesign/overview|title=GeoDesign Overview {{!}} Esri|last=|first=|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Design and Planning ===
[[Garsdale Design]] were early pioneers of Esri CityEngine in the creation of city master plans in Iraq pre-2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/aug/26/yorkshire-dales-family-designing-cities-in-iraq|title=

Before using that, it took them numerous work hours on creating interactive visualizations of hundred thousands of buildings. With CityEngine, the designers and clients of projects can communicate via craft fluid, data-rich, and real-time rendered experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://desktop.arcgis.com/en/cityengine/latest/get-started/cityengine-whats-new.htm|title=Visibility Analysis tools for planners|last=Zoog|first=Christopher|date=|website=Esri.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Urban Study ===
Due to its dominant feature in building informative city models, urban researchers are using CityEngine to compare [[Land use|land-use]] planning schemes, starting from the densest global cities such as Hong Kong and Seoul.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guo|first=Jian|date=July 2017|title=A study of plot ratio/building height restrictions in high density cities using 3D spatial analysis technology: A case in Hong Kong|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0197397515303465?|journal=Habitat International|volume=65|pages=13–31|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.habitatint.2017.04.012|hdl=10397/69923}}&lt;/ref&gt; When urban designers/planners enjoy the quantitive analyst, environmental scientists also like the instant 3D model generation in CityEngine, leading to more convenient informative research out of the time-consumption on creating a city from each building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Choei|first=Nae-Young|date=April 2016|title=Procedural Modeling of a Residential Site Using the Interoperability between the GIS and CityEngine: An Adaptation of the Radburn Type Cul-de-sac Roadsystem and Housing|url=https://eds.b.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=5&amp;sid=f1cb27b0-bfcf-491a-8034-9f7e850331df%40pdc-v-sessmgr01|journal=Journal of Engineering Technology|volume=3|pages=4|via=GSTF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhu|first=Qing|date=July 2017|title=Robust point cloud classification based on multi-level semantic relationships for urban scenes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0924271616305445?|journal=Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing|volume=129|pages=86–102|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.isprsjprs.2017.04.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Game Development ===
Triple-A Games require detailed 3D environments to assign interactive scripts, causing CityEngine's participation in the creation of game scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Klein|first=Bernhard|date=2016|title=Managing the Scalability of Visual Exploration Using Game Engines to Analyse UHI Scenarios|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705816332350?|journal=Procedia Engineering|volume=169|pages=272–279|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2016.10.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, game scenes become larger than that of old video games ten years ago. Large sandbox or open-world games such as GTA series or Assassin Creeds series need millions of distinguished 3D buildings in their virtual world. Designing these games with instantly testing and editing can reduce workloads and increase the rationality of a game scene in the gameplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Literary Mapping in the Digital Age|last=Cooper|first=David|publisher=Routledge|date=May 20, 2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movie Industry ===
''[[Zootopia]],'' which won the 2016 [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature|Academy Award for Best Animated Feature Film]], used CityEngine to establish an impressive metropolis where humans don’t exist. From giraffes to shrews, animals own diverse scales in the system of transportation, houses, and amenities. To build up a multi-scaling city, the designers used CityEngine due to its rule-based system. Before Zootopia (also known as Zootroplis in countries outside the USA), CityEngine was also used to create [https://gizmodo.com/a-tour-of-san-fransokyo-the-hybrid-city-disney-built-f-1642066794 the Japanese-style city]—San Fransokyo—in ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]'' .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tracy|first=Cozzens|date=July 10, 2017|title=Esri UC: How CityEngine powered Disney's Zootopia|url=http://gpsworld.com/esri-uc-how-cityengine-powered-disneys-zootopia/|journal=GPS World|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been contested view with regard to the position of  the local [[community]] on their resources that surrounds their vicinity. Most people urge that the local community's perceptions and aspirations has to be taken on board in the course of [[Natural resource management|planning and managing]] the resources that are close to their surroundings from which they acquire their day to day livelihood means.According to &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Logomo|title=Community perception of on farm trees and adjacent natural forest status under participatory management, Dodola District, Ethiopia|accessdate=2012|agency=Hawassa University Ethiopia.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptions of the local community towards a given natural resource management programme is very essential and hence need not to be underestimated. Understanding of community perceptions is of paramount importance in natural resources management.Several studies stress the importance of using local people’s perceptions as an input for designing and applying appropriate management plans for [[sustainable development]], particularly in [[protected area]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kleftoyanni|title=Environmental perceptions of students, farmers and other economically active members of the local population near the protected areas of [[Axios River|Axios]], [[Loudias (river)|Loudias]] and  Aliakmonas Estuaries in [[Greece]].|journal= Global NEST Journal|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2648">'''Comparative law wikis''' are [[wiki]]s that allow users to create empirical cross-reference datasets for the analysis of the world's myriad [[List of national legal systems|legal systems]]. Wikis are adaptable to use by any cross-geographical comparative study, such as [[comparative politics]], [[comparative religion]].

==Examples==

Over the past decade, there have been several attempts to create a global legal wiki,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ler.edu.au/pdf/vol19_fullpapers/ler_vol19_paper3.pdf|title=Normann Witzleb, Engaging with the World: Students of Comparative Law Write for Wikipedia|publisher=Legal Education Review (2009)}}&lt;/ref&gt; though as of April 2017 none have gained primacy.  Examples include the World Encyclopedia of Law, by LAWi &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawin.org/comparative-law/|title=World Encyclopedia of Law|publisher=LAWi}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wex]], the online legal encyclopedia created by [[Cornell Law School]]'s [[Legal Information Institute]]. Parallel efforts to create crowdsourced data structures to map global legal/regulatory authorities include projects like [[Intellipedia]], an online system for collaborative data sharing used by the [[United States Intelligence Community]] (IC).

== Usefulness ==

Comparative law wikis are an efficient method of performing [[comparative law|comparative legal]] analysis.  Wikis are particularly useful for comparative global analysis because of the use with which sources from multiple jurisdictions can be gathered in one place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kennedy|first1=Dennis|last2=Mighell|first2=Tom|title=Wikis for the Legal Profession|url=http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|website=American Bar Association|accessdate=12 June 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140911023153/http://apps.americanbar.org/lpm/lpt/articles/slc02071.shtml|archivedate=11 April 2014|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crowdsourcing]] permits gathering up-to-date legal authorities from contributors who have local expertise, particularly knowledge of languages and administrative structures that background implementation of particular legal/regulatory norms.  

Comparative law wikis can also be useful for comparative study in federal legal systems, such as in the U.S., where 50-state law surveys are particularly useful.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9128">'''Complementary holism''' is a [[social theory]] or conceptual framework proposed by [[Michael Albert]] and [[Robin Hahnel]], that sees all societies as consisting of a Human Center and Institutional Boundaries, and that all social relations in the political, economic, community/cultural and kinship "spheres" as mutually interacting to defining our social experiences. Complementary holism does not rest on an ''a priori'' assumption that a particular sphere is the base and all else is superstructure, as [[historical materialism]] does, but rather that we must take an empirical look at society's development and assess how it has been shaped by all social forces. Complementary holists agree with [[Marxists]] that economics is important to human and social development, just as they do with [[anarchists]] in regard to the [[State (polity)|State]] or with [[feminists]] in regard to [[gender inequality]], but they assert that Marxists see economics, or [[class conflict]], as the sole factor, and they don't believe that economics is always the most important factor.

In ''Liberating Theory'', Michael Albert, Robin Hahnel et al. write that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Just as Marx and Engels paid strict attention to "state of the art" science in their time, we should keep up with contemporary developments. Ironically, however, though most contemporary Marxists pride themselves on being "scientific," few bother to notice that "state of the art" science has changed dramatically in the last hundred years. While avoiding simplistic mimicry and misapplication of scientific principles, we should update our methods by seriously examining contemporary science for new ideas relevant to our theoretical efforts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Modern quantum physics, for example, teaches that reality is not a collection of separate entities but a vast and intricate "unbroken whole." Ilya Prigogine comments, "The new paradigms of science may be expected to develop into the new science of connectedness which means the recognition of unity in diversity." When thinking about phenomena, we inevitably conceptually abstract parts from the whole in which they reside, but they then exist as separate entities only in our perceptions. There are no isolated electrons, for example, only fields of force continually ebbing and flowing in a seamless web of activity which manifests events that we choose to call electrons because it suits our analytic purposes. For the physicist, each electron, quark, or whatever is a "process" and a "network." As a process it has a developmental trajectory--extending through all time. As a network, it is part of an interactive pattern--stretching throughout all space. Every part embodies and is subsumed in a larger whole.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Human Center and Institutional Boundary==
Each society has a human center where we find people, their consciousness, personalities, talents and needs. Each society also has an institutional boundary consisting of social institutions and their role structures. Just as our consciousnesses, needs and desires are shaped by the institutions we create to facilitate our social activities so are our institutions shaped by our cultural traditions. How we define our institutions and the roles we play in society has an important effect on what kind of people we become.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Society's center and boundary are ''complementary'' aspects of a single unbroken whole. Both center and boundary are complex dissipative systems. Whatever society's defining features may be, they will necessarily pervade both society's center and boundary. They will persist through evolutionary changes since such changes necessarily involve limited adaptations of both center and boundary. Revolution, however, will alter these defining features. Since we know that historically people universally engage in certain social activities, which in turn involve social relations contouring daily life and governing group interactions, as our next conceptual step it makes sense to subdivide society along lines highlighting these activities, social relations, and social groups. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Spheres==
Complementary holism carves out the Human Center and Institutional Boundary into four separate but interconnecting social spheres: the Economic Sphere, the Kinship Sphere, the Community Sphere and the Political Sphere.

# The [[Economic]] Sphere is where the production, consumption, and allocation of material means of life occur. The key institutions for the economy are workplaces, allocation mechanisms, property relations, and remuneration schemes.
# The [[Kinship]] Sphere is where child rearing, nurturing future generations, socializing and care giving occur. Key institutions are the family, with parental and child rearing roles, where gender and sexuality, and other relations form for boys and girls, men and women, fathers and mothers, adults, children and the elderly.
# The [[Political]] Sphere is where adjudication, policy regulation and law making occur with courts, a legislature and police.
# The [[Community]] Sphere is where identity, religion, and spirituality occur with race, ethnicity, places of worship, beliefs about life and death, celebration of cultural traditions, etc.

Like the human center and institutional boundary, these four spheres interconnect with one another:

&lt;blockquote&gt;People aren't economically-affected in one part of their lives and gender-affected in another; state-influenced one day of the week and community-influenced some other day. Instead, they simultaneously experience economic, kinship, governance, and community involvements, and this guarantees that spheres interact. At a particular time class may have more influence on molding a person's consciousness and behavior than gender, or vice-versa. But these influences must co-exist. ''(Liberating Theory)''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Accommodation==
Accommodation describes a particular way in which the four spheres interact with each other. The assigned roles that are a feature of one sphere may be accommodated in another. How our roles are divided in the workplace may accommodate with sexist and racist divisions found as central features in our Kinship and Community Spheres so that economic activity subjugates women and non-whites to lower pay and positions of power than men and whites.

==Co-Definition==
Another way the four spheres can interact is by co-defining each other. For example, workplace roles are often determined by more than "class divisions."

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is nothing inherent in capitalist economic relations that requires the activity of coffee-making to be assigned to the role of secretary. There is no purely economic reason why in the U.S., women are ghettoized into so-called "pink collar" jobs: clerical work, nursing, domestic work, restaurant and food service, retail sales, elementary school teaching, etc. There is nothing about economics that requires that in addition to different levels of compensation, women's and men's activities must or even should involve different degrees of oversight and mobility. Purely economic dynamics cannot explain such profound gender differentiations. In this sense, then, not only do economic relations accommodate kinship hierarchies, by placing women in the lowest "economicallydefined" positions, but patriarchy "co-defines" basic economic relations. (''Liberating Theory'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Social Change==
Proponents of complementary holism feel the social theory is not only helpful in understanding society as it is but in understanding how society can be changed. By recognizing the interconnecting social forces - the human center, institutional boundary and four social spheres - and how they shape and are shaped by the intertwining relationship with each other, complementary holists feel we are better equipped to transform society and overcome social oppressions.

Complementary holism sees two ways in which societies can change:

# ''Reproduction'': This is where a change recreates a past social feature. An example could be where a revolution overthrows one hierarchical political system and replaces it with another.
# ''Transformation'': This is where social activities create an entirely new characteristics that differ from the past. For example, a social revolution may overthrow a [[market economy]] and replace it with a self-managed [[participatory economy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6583">'''Creode''' or '''chreod''' is a [[neologism|neologistic]] [[portmanteau]] term coined by the English 20th century biologist [[C.H. Waddington]] to represent the developmental pathway followed by a [[cell (biology)|cell]] as it grows to form part of a specialized organ.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington,  pp 19–30&lt;/ref&gt;  Combining the Greek roots for "necessary" and "path," the term was inspired by the property of [[biology|regulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 32&lt;/ref&gt;  When [[biology|development]] is disturbed by external forces, the embryo attempts to regulate its growth and differentiation by returning to its normal developmental trajectory.

==Developmental biology==

Waddington used the term along with [[canalisation (genetics)|canalisation]] and [[homeorhesis]], which describes a system that returns to a steady trajectory, in contrast to [[homeostasis]], which describes a system which returns to a steady state. Waddington explains development with the metaphor of a ball rolling down a hillside, where the hill's contours channel the ball in a particular direction. In the case of a pathway or creode which is deeply carved in the hillside, external disturbance is unlikely to prevent normal development. He notes that creodes tend to have steeper sides earlier in development, when external disturbance rarely suffices to alter the developmental trajectory.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 23&lt;/ref&gt; Small differences in placement atop the hill can lead to dramatically different results by the time the ball reaches the bottom. This represents the tendency of neighboring regions of the early embryo to develop into different organs with radically different structures.  Since intermediate structures rarely exist between organs, each ball that rolls down the hill is "[[canalisation (genetics)|canalised]]" to a region distinct from other regions, just as an eye, for instance, is distinct from an ear.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington refers to the network of creodes carved into the hillside as an "[[epigenetic]] landscape," meaning that the formation of the body depends on not only its [[Genetics|genetic]] makeup but the different ways genes are expressed in different regions of the embryo.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 30–33&lt;/ref&gt;  He expands his metaphor by describing the underside of the epigenetic landscape.  Here we see that the "landscape" is really more like a giant sheet that would blow away except that a series of tension-bearing cables holds it down.  The pegs that connect the cables to the ground are the genes.  The cables themselves are the epigenetic factors that influence gene expression in various regions of the embryo.  The depth and direction of the channels is thus determined by a combination of genetic makeup and the epigenetic [[feedback loops]] by which genes are regulated.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 34–37&lt;/ref&gt;

While Waddington does assert that the process of development is genetically driven, he makes no attempt to explain how this works and even offers evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 37&lt;/ref&gt;  He observes, for instance, that genes ordinarily determine peripheral traits, such as eye color, rather than "focal" traits, such as the structure of the eye itself.  Moreover, when genetic mutation influences basic structures, the result tends to be the complete transformation of a structure into another rather than piecemeal change, which Waddington illustrates with the developmental ball rolling out of one creode into another.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, pp 51-52&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus his account gives the impression that genes influence development, perhaps altering the course of a region of cells, without determining the endpoints toward which the embryo develops.

This interpretation is further reinforced by Waddington's discussion of the organization of the gene pool, where he points out that "the epigenetic process occurring during the development of the organism might be so buffered or canalized that the optimum end-result is produced irrespective of the genes which the individual contains."&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 120&lt;/ref&gt;  The more deeply creodes are carved into the epigenetic landscape, the weaker the influence of genes over development.  He also argues that deep creodes will resist not only genetic but environmental pressures to change course.  This phenomenon, which he calls "stabilizing selection," puts genes and environment on a par in secondary importance compared to the epigenetic system.&lt;ref&gt;Waddington, p 123&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington's emphasis on epigenetics over genes prefigured the current interest in [[evolutionary developmental biology]].  As [[Sean B. Carroll]] and others have explained, genes involved in development are roughly the same in all animal species, from insect to primate.  Instead of mutations in developmental genes, evolution has been driven by changes in gene expression, namely which genes are expressed at which times and locations in the developing organism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sean B Carroll]], ''Endless Forms Most Beautiful'', WW Norton &amp; Company, 2005, pp 9, 64–71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

Architectural theorist [[Sanford Kwinter]] described the concept of the chreod as "the most important concept of the 20th century."&lt;ref&gt;Sandford Kwinter, "Lecture Excerpt: What Is Life?," ''GSD 08 Platform,'' Harvard University Graduate School of Design, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The word "chreod" also closely describes paths of decision within what [[Christopher Alexander]] has called [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], his term for what he notes that Stuart Kaufmann calls "fitness landscape." By Alexander's theory, because conscious human design decisions do not need to follow these chreods, conscious human design can lead to mixed results. Therefore, he proposes that discovering ways to allow architecture to follow these paths is the best way to get good results in the built environment. Alexander sees his theories of "The Fundamental Process", "structure preserving transformations" and "15 fundamental properties" which he outlines in his work ''[[The Nature of Order]]'' as instrumentally shaping paths through configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Alexander]], [http://www.katarxis3.com/SCIENTIFIC%20INTRODUCTION.pdf ''New Concepts in Complexity Theory Arising from Studies in the Field of Architecture''], p 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''crisis actor''' (aka '''actor-patient''' or '''actor victim''') is a trained [[actor]], role player, volunteer, or other person engaged to portray a disaster victim during [[safety drill|emergency drills]] to train first responders such as police, firefighters or EMT personnel. Crisis actors are used to create high-fidelity simulations of disasters in order to allow first responders to practice their skills and help emergency services organizations to prepare and train in realistic scenarios as part of full-scale disaster exercises.&lt;ref name="CrisisActors"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crisis Actors.

== Disaster training simulations ==
Actors take on the role of mock victims and simulate specific injuries from a disaster to add life-like realism to an emergency exercise. Theatrical [[makeup]] and cosmetics, plus rubber and latex appliances, are often used to simulate a variety of wounds or medical conditions that realistically portray victim's injuries, a practice known as [[Moulage|medical moulage]].&lt;ref name="Merica2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bobbie J Merica|title=Medical Moulage: How to Make Your Simulations Come Alive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hX_2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR32|date=22 November 2011|publisher=F.A.

Actors who portray news reporters, relatives of victims, and concerned citizens are also used during drills to train [[emergency operations center]] personnel to cope with a variety of emotionally-charged demands and requests.&lt;ref name="Hiatt2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charlotte J.

== Conspiracy theories and defamation ==
The term has been used by [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorists]] who claimed that some [[mass shootings]] and other disasters were staged, and victims and their families were being played by crisis actors. Conspiracy theorists' use of the term is thought to have originated in 2012, when a blog post by former professor and professional conspiracy theorist [[James Tracy (communication scholar)|James Tracy]] suggested that the government could have hired an [[Talent agent|acting agency]] named [[Visionbox]], which supplied crisis actors who were "trained in criminal and victim behavior, and bring intense realism to simulated mass casualty incidents in public places" to help stage the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting|Sandy Hook shooting]].

Tracy also promoted a crisis actor conspiracy theory of the [[Boston Marathon bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/pammy8/what-is-a-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theory-explanation-parkland-shooting-sandy-hook|title=Where the 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theory Comes From|last1=Koebler|first1=Jason|date=22 February 2018|work=Motherboard|accessdate=22 February 2018|agency=[[Vice Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/2/22/17036018/parkland-conspiracy-theories|title=The Parkland conspiracy theories, explained Crisis actors? The deep state?|last1=Yglesias|first1=Matthew|publisher=Vox|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conspiracy theorists have claimed such attacks are "[[false flag]] operations" staged by conspirators, usually government or corporate forces, in order to achieve some goal such as justifying increased [[government surveillance]], disarmament of the population, or military action against blamed nations or groups. Crisis actors are claimed in this context to play the part of bystanders or witnesses, emergency response personnel, and (with the aid of stage makeup) wounded victims of the attack.

Popularizers of the conspiracy theory include commentators such as [[Alex Jones]] and outlets such as ''True Pundit''.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/us/after-orlando-shooting-false-flag-and-crisis-actor-conspiracy-theories-surface.html|title=After Orlando Shooting, 'False Flag' and 'Crisis Actor' Conspiracy Theories Surface|last1=Mele|first1=Christopher|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian12"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/feb/21/crisis-actors-deep-state-false-flag-the-rise-of-conspiracy-theory-code-words |title=Crisis actors, deep state, false flag: the rise of conspiracy theory code words|last1=Wilson|first1=Jason|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vox2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Snopes12"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/same-girl-crying-now-oregon/|title=Crisis Actors Uncovered?|publisher=Snopes |accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the parents of two children killed in the Sandy Hook shooting launched a lawsuit against Alex Jones for defamation "accusing him and his website [[InfoWars]] of engaging in a campaign of 'false, cruel, and dangerous assertions'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-texas-lawsuit-alexjones/sandy-hook-parents-sue-conspiracy-theorist-alex-jones-for-defamation-idUSKBN1HO2FU|title=Sandy Hook parents sue conspiracy theorist Alex Jones for defamation|author=Editorial |publisher=Reuters |access-date=2018-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The D.M. was introduced at [[Case Western Reserve]] in 1995,&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; and several universities have since developed their own programs. In the UK, the Doctor of Management (DMan) was introduced at the [[University of Hertfordshire]] in 2000.&lt;ref name=DMan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/word_doc/0018/25209/CMGdman-brochure2011.docx|title=Doctor of Management/Master of Arts|publisher=University of Hertfordshire|date=December 2010|accessdate=2017-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.M. program is an applied professional practice doctorate including a similar strong emphasis on research to the academically-equivalent [[PhD in management]], but with a focus on the application of management theories rather than on developing and extending those theories.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"&gt;{{cite web | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132958/http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx| archive-date=20 December 2017|format=PDF|url=http://www.coloradotech.edu/~/media/CTU/Files/ThoughtLeadership/dm-or-phd.ashx | title=D.M. or Ph.D. in Management?| accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to research, it is focused on developing the talents, skills and abilities of organization executives and experienced management professionals.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aasa.org/SchoolAdministratorArticle.aspx?id=6624 | title=A Degree of Difference: A Doctorate in Management| accessdate=February 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===D.M. versus Ph.D.===
In most cases, the distinction between the degrees is one of orientation and intended outcomes. The Ph.D. is highly focused on developing theoretical knowledge, while the D.M. further emphasizes applied research leading to the practical application of this theoretical knowledge. The Ph.D. thus prepares students for careers in academia, while the D.M. is more aimed at those seeking a career in management.&lt;ref name="coloradotech.edu"/&gt; Some D.M. programs require a [[dissertation]], while others have replaced this with a number of applied research projects.&lt;ref name="aasa.org"/&gt; 

The British DMan is a professional doctorate with the same academic status as a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=DMan/&gt; The U.S. Doctor of Management is also a professional doctorate but is not (as of the report ''Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014'') recognised as a Ph.D.-equivalent research doctorate by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/2016/nsf16300/technotes.cfm|title=Technical Notes|work= Doctorate Recipients from U.S. Universities: 2014 |date=December 2015|publisher=[[National Science Foundation]]|accessdate=4 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this doctorate is sometimes viewed as a variant of the Ph.D. in Management (especially when a dissertation is required in the program).{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

==Program structure==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2018}}
To be admitted as a doctoral management student in the U.S., one must hold a [[Business education#Postgraduate education|management-related]] [[master's degree]], have sufficient managerial experience, and pass a comprehensive entrance exam or doctoral essay. In the UK (and in many programs in the U.S.), there is a minimum of five years of management or professional consulting experience required. In the UK, an [[honours degree]] plus a relevant master's degree is preferred.&lt;ref name=Herts/&gt; The student must then complete necessary [[coursework]] (typically focused on [[Management#Management skills|leadership]] and [[business strategy|strategy]], and including training in [[research methodology]]), perform independent original [[thesis|research]] under supervision of a qualified [[doctoral advisor]], pass the doctoral dissertation or doctoral [[thesis defense]], and in some cases, teach examinable courses.

Although it can be completed in as little as three years, the D.M. typically takes 4–6 years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;AACSB article about a PhD in Business and Becoming a Business Professor {{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first two years of the program are usually focused on intensive doctoral-level coursework and generally at least one research practicum (near the end of core courses, residencies, and research and writing training). It may be followed by a comprehensive examination (comps) at this point if the candidate has successfully reached this stage.&lt;ref name="aacsb.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711061612/http://www.aacsb.edu/resource_centers/DoctoralEdu/BusinessProfessor-full.pdf |archivedate=2009-07-11 |df= }}{{failed verification|date=October 2016|reason=Page is about the D.B.A., not the D.M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to the PhD, the subsequent dissertation completion phase for the D.M. can take an additional two or more years. In some programs where the candidate has a good deal of professional management practical experience, the D.M. can be completed in as little as three years if the candidate has proven capable of taking a full load of credits each term, as well as successful completion of the required dissertation and its defense.

===Research methodologies===
Common research methodologies used in management studies include both quantitative and qualitative approaches such as: [[Business model|Modeling]], [[Econometrics]], [[Experiment]]s, Descriptive and Field Studies, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|Phenomenology]], [[Case Study]], [[Action Research]] or [[Mixed Methods]] strategies of inquiry.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8451">[[File:Amanita muscaria After Rain.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' has a long and varied history of psychoactive use.]]
'''Ethnomycology''' is the study of the historical uses and sociological impact of [[fungi]] and can be considered a subfield of [[ethnobotany]] or [[ethnobiology]]. Although in theory the term includes fungi used for such purposes as [[tinder]], medicine ([[medicinal mushrooms]]) and food (including [[yeast]]), it is often used in the context of the study of psychoactive mushrooms such as [[psilocybin mushrooms]], the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom, and the [[ergot]] fungus.

American banker [[Robert Gordon Wasson]] pioneered interest in this field of study in the late 1950s, when he and his wife became the first Westerners on record allowed to participate in a mushroom ''[[Velada (Mazatec ritual)|velada]]'', held by the [[Mazatec people|Mazatec]] ''[[Curandero|curandera]]'' [[María Sabina]]. The biologist [[Richard Evans Schultes]] is also considered an ethnomycological pioneer.  Later researchers in the field include [[Terence McKenna]], [[Albert Hofmann]], [[Ralph Metzner]], [[Carl Ruck]], [[Blaise Daniel Staples]], [[Giorgio Samorini]], [[Keewaydinoquay Peschel]], [[John Marco Allegro]], [[Clark Heinrich]], [[Jonathan Ott]], and [[Paul Stamets]].

Besides mycological determination in the field, ethnomycology depends to a large extent on [[anthropology]] and [[philology]]. One of the major debates among ethnomycologists is Wasson's theory that the [[Soma (drink)|Soma]] mentioned in the [[Rigveda]] of the [[Indo-Aryans]] was the ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' mushroom.&lt;ref name="ref2"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-15-683800-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his example similar attempts have been made to identify psychoactive mushroom usage in many other (mostly) ancient cultures, with varying degrees of credibility. Another much written about topic is the content of the [[Kykeon]], the [[sacrament]] used during the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] in [[ancient Greece]] between approximately 1500 BCE and 396 CE.&lt;ref name="ref3"&gt;{{cite book

  | page = 149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not an ethnomycologist as such, [[philologist]] [[John Allegro]] has made an important contribution suggesting, in a book controversial enough to have his academic career destroyed, that ''Amanita muscaria'' was not only consumed as a sacrament but was the main focus of worship in the more [[esoteric]] sects of [[Sumerian mythology|Sumerian religion]], [[Judaism]] and [[early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="ref4"&gt;{{cite book

  | isbn = 0-340-12875-5
  | page = 320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clark Heinrich]] claims that ''Amanita muscaria'' use in Europe was not completely wiped out by [[Orthodox Christianity]] but continued to be used (either consumed or merely symbolically) by individuals and small groups such as [[medieval]] [[Holy Grail]] [[myth]] makers, [[alchemy|alchemists]] and [[Renaissance]] artists.&lt;ref name="ref5"&gt;{{cite book

While Wasson views historical mushroom use primarily as a facilitator for the [[shamanic]] or spiritual experiences core to these rites and traditions, McKenna takes this further, positing that the ingestion of psilocybin was perhaps primary in the formation of language and culture and identifying [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] mushrooms as the original "[[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]]".&lt;ref name="ref6"&gt;{{cite book

The 1990s saw a surge in the recreational use of [[psilocybin mushrooms]] due to a combination of a psychedelic revival in the [[rave]] culture, improved and simplified cultivation techniques, and the distribution of both the mushrooms themselves and information about them via the [[Internet]]. This "mushrooming of mushroom use" has also caused an increased popularization of ethnomycology itself as there are many websites and Internet forums where mushroom references in [[Christmas]] and [[fairy tale]] symbolism are discussed. It remains open to interpretation what effect this popularization has on ethnomycology in the academic world, where the lack of verifiable evidence has kept its theories with their often far-reaching implications shrouded in controversy.

In the United States, '''Extended School Year''' ('''ESY''') services are designed to support a student with a [[disability]] as documented under the [[Individuals with Disabilities Education Act]] (IDEA) to maintain the academic, social/behavioral, communication, or other skills that they have learned as part of their [[Individualized Education Program]] (IEP) or [[Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act|Section 504]] accommodation plan. In order for a student to receive ESY services, the student must have evidenced substantial regression and recoupment issues during the previous IEP year and/or there is evidence of emerging skills which are often referred to as "breakthrough" skills. The focus of the services provided to the student as part of an ESY program are generally not upon learning new skills or "catching up" to grade level, but rather to provide practice to maintain previously acquired or learned skills. In some cases ESY is focused on continuing education for students whose rate of progress is insufficient to enable effective progress during the regular school year. If a student has received ESY services in previous years the student may not be eligible in future years as determinations for eligibility of ESY services are made annually by the IEP or 504 plan (which includes the parent and student of age 16 or older. NOTE: The mandatory age at which a student must be included varies by State but the Federal law states no later than age 16.)  

;(a) General.
# Under the re-authorization of IDEA, effective July 1, 2005, each public agency must ensure that extended school year services are available as necessary to provide [[Free Appropriate Public Education]] (FAPE), consistent with paragraph (a)(2).
# Extended school year services must be provided only if a child's IEP Team determines, on an individual basis, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 300.320 through 300.324, that the services are necessary for the provision of FAPE to the child.
# In implementing the requirements of this section, a public agency may not—
## Limit extended school year services to particular categories of disability; or
## Unilaterally limit the type, amount, or duration of those services.

;(b) Definition. 
As used in this section, the term extended school year services means special education and related services that--
# Are provided to a child with a disability—
## Beyond the normal school year of the public agency;
## In accordance with the child's IEP; and
## At no cost to the parents of the child; and
# Meet the standards of the [[State education agency]] (SEA).

'''Fire history''', the ecological science of the study of the history of wildfires, is a subdiscipline of [[fire ecology]]. Patterns of forest fires in historical and prehistorical time provide information relevant to the pattern of vegetation in modern landscapes. It provides an estimate of the historical range of variability of a natural disturbance regime, and can be used to identify the processes affecting the occurrence of fire. Fire history reconstructions are achieved by compiling atlases of past fires, using the [[tree ring]] record from fire scars and tree ages, and the charcoal record from soils and sediments.

== Prehistoric fires ==
Sustained wildfire can only exist once oxygen levels and fuel sources were present in sufficient quantities. Between 400 and 450 million year ago, fire became a feature of the landscape.&lt;ref name="Pyne2001"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/757509384|title=Fire : a brief history|last=1949-|first=Pyne, Stephen J.,|date=2001|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=029598144X|location=Seattle|oclc=757509384}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11–14}} The presence of [[fusain]] (fossil charcoal), beginning in the early [[Carboniferous]] attests to this fire history and forms an important element of the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]].&lt;ref name="Pyne2001" /&gt;{{rp|11–14}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2000-12-01|title=The Pre-Quaternary history of fire|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018200001929|journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology|volume=164|issue=1-4|pages=281–329|doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(00)00192-9|issn=0031-0182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth record of a tree in seasonal climates is preserved in the growth rings in the stem wood; the field of [[dendrochronology]] is the study of the record of climate and other events preserved in the growth record. Each growth ring represents one year of life. The thickness of each ring indicates the amount of wood produced during that growing season. At the beginning of the growing season large cells are able to quickly divide creating a light colored wood. When growth slows down, generally in colder months, a darker wood is created from smaller cells dividing more slowly. Thus, one year is represented by a light inner ring and a darker outer ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theforestacademy.com/tree-knowledge/annual-growth-rings/#.Whs6c0qnFhF|title=Annual growth rings {{!}} Tree knowledge {{!}} Booklet {{!}} Forest Academy - Domtar|website=www.theforestacademy.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rings can be counted from dead trees as well as stumps left behind from logging. A sample can be collected from a living tree using tools like the [[increment borer]]. The increment borer is a hollow steel tube used to extract a core sample from a tree’s trunk. The growth rings in a core sample are counted to determine the age of that tree. Ages of stand-replacing fires may be determined by determining the cohort-age of trees that established after a fire. For example, tree-ring dating of large stands will show the age of the forest, and may provide an estimate of when the last large disturbance event occurred.

Sometimes growth rings exhibit scars. A fire scar forms when heat kills the vascular cambium beneath the bark, which then heals over subsequent years as growth rings curl over the scarred area, thus protecting the tree from infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fs.fed.us/rmrs/science-spotlights/making-scar-how-fire-scars-develop-trees|title=The making of a scar:  How fire scars develop in trees  {{!}} Rocky Mountain Research Station|website=www.fs.fed.us|language=en|access-date=2017-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method can be used to date the year a fire occurred. Observing the scars establishes the timeline of a forest fire and the time between fires at a site. Surveying many trees over a large sample area provides a view to individual fire events and the overall fire regime. Not all tree species scar and show evidence of fire. Most pine species in the subgenus [[List of Pinus species#Subgenus Pinus|Pinus]] readily produce scars that are protected by resin; such scarring on other trees may result in death, leaving no fire record behind.

===Research and data examples===
Prior to Euro-American settlement in western North America, fire histories from scars preserved in ponderosa pine forests often reveal a pattern of frequent fire (often with 5 to 20 year intervals in a single area), with a pattern in time and space strongly related to past variations in climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Falk|first=Donald A|last2=Heyerdahl|first2=Emily K|last3=Brown|first3=Peter M|last4=Farris|first4=Calvin|last5=Fulé|first5=Peter Z|last6=McKenzie|first6=Donald|last7=Swetnam|first7=Thomas W|last8=Taylor|first8=Alan H|last9=Van Horne|first9=Megan L|date=2011-10-01|title=Multi-scale controls of historical forest-fire regimes: new insights from fire-scar networks|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/100052/abstract|journal=Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment|language=en|volume=9|issue=8|pages=446–454|doi=10.1890/100052|issn=1540-9309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fuel reduction from grazing and fire suppression greatly reduced the amount of fire in dry forests over the last 100 years.

A study by Arne Buechiling and William L. Baker in 2004 identified 41 fire events beginning in 1533 in a 9200-ha study area north of Estes Park, Colorado. They sampled 3461 tree cores and 212 fire scars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Buechling|first=Arne|last2=Baker|first2=William L.|date=2004|title=A fire history from tree rings in a high-elevation forest of Rocky Mountain National Park|url=http://cjfr.nrc.ca/|journal=Canadian Journal of Forest Research|volume=34|pages=1259–1273|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fire scar data provided greater insight into the fire event parameters. Of the 41 fires, 22 where high-severity crown fires, 7 low-severity surface fires, and 8 mixed-severity fires. Fires larger than 300 ha were few, but composed a substantial proportion of the area burned since 1700. Drought periods led to larger fires.

There is little known about the fire history in some places. Central Europe for instance has a lack of intact forests with old growth trees or an abundance of dead or cut down trees that can be used to reconstruct the past fire regimes. An exception to this lacking history is the [[Białowieża Forest|Bialowieza Primeval Forest]] in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niklasson|first=Mats|last2=Zin|first2=Ewa|last3=Zielonka|first3=Tomasz|last4=Feijen|first4=Markus|last5=Korczyk|first5=Adolf F.|last6=Churski|first6=Marcin|last7=Samojlik|first7=Tomasz|last8=Jedrzejewska|first8=Bogumiła|last9=Gutowski|first9=Jerzy M.|date=2010|title=A 350-year tree-ring fire record from Białowie_za Primeval Forest, Poland: implications for Central European lowland fire history|url=|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=98|pages=1319–1329|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A group of researchers were able to use a 350-year tree-ring fire record to reconstruct the fire history in precise detail. This is a shining example of how the method can be used in a place with lost or no written history of a fire regime.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="67504">The '''five-planet Nice model''' is a recent variation of the [[Nice model]] that begins with five [[giant planet]]s, the current four plus an additional [[ice giant]], in a chain of mean-motion resonances. After the [[orbital resonance|resonance]] chain is broken, the five giant planets undergo a period of planetesimal-driven migration, followed by a gravitational instability similar to that in the original Nice model. During the instability the additional giant planet is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and is ejected from the [[Solar System]] following an encounter with Jupiter. An [[Formation and evolution of the Solar System|early Solar System]] with five giant planets was proposed in 2011 after numerical models indicated that this is more likely to reproduce the current Solar System.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nesvorný|first=David|title=Young Solar System's Fifth Giant Planet?|journal=The Astrophysical Journal Letters|date=2011|volume=742|issue=2|pages=L22|doi=10.1088/2041-8205/742/2/L22|arxiv = 1109.2949 |bibcode = 2011ApJ...742L..22N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A five-planet Nice model==

The following is a version of the five-planet Nice model that results in a late instability and reproduces a number of aspects of the current Solar System. The early Solar System may have evolved differently, however, with the instability occurring [[Five-planet Nice model#Timing of the instability|soon after]] the dissipation of the gas nebula,&lt;ref name="Kaib_Chambers_2016" /&gt; or with the giant planets [[Five-planet Nice model#Initial conditions|beginning]] in another resonance chain.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The Solar System ends its [[nebular hypothesis|nebula phase]] with [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], and the three ice giants in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain with [[semi-major axis|semi-major axes]] ranging from 5.5 – 20 [[astronomical unit|AU]]. A dense disk of [[planetesimal]]s orbits beyond these [[planet]]s, extending from 24 AU to 30 AU. [[impact event|Collisions]] between planetesimals in the outer disk produce debris that is ground to dust in a cascade of collisions. The dust spirals inward toward the planets due to [[Poynting–Robertson effect|Poynting-Robertson drag]] and eventually reaches [[Neptune]]'s orbit. Gravitational interactions with the dust allow the giant planets to escape from the resonance chain roughly ten million years after the dissipation of the [[Circumstellar disc|gas disk]]. After a series of distant planetary encounters the planets settle into an extended period of slow dust-driven migration.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; Their orbits slowly diverge over four hundred million years,&lt;ref name="Bottke_2012" /&gt; until Neptune approaches the inner edge of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

The migration of the planets then accelerates and transitions to a [[Planetary migration#Planetesimal-driven migration|planetesimal-driven migration]] as Neptune encounters and exchanges [[angular momentum]] with an increasing number of planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt; A net inward transfer of planetesimals and outward migration of Neptune occur during these encounters as most of those [[gravity assist|scattered]] outward return to be encountered again while some of those scattered inward are prevented from returning after encountering [[Uranus]]. A similar process occurs for Uranus, the extra ice giant, and Saturn resulting in their outward migration and a transfer of planetesimals inward from the outer belt to Jupiter. Jupiter, in contrast, ejects most of the planetesimals from the Solar System, and as a result migrates inward.&lt;ref name="Tsiganis_etal_2005" /&gt; After 10 million years the divergent migration of the planets leads to resonance crossings, exciting the [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricities]] of the giant planets and destabilizing the planetary system when Neptune is near 28 AU.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2015-a" /&gt;

During this instability the extra ice giant enters a Saturn-crossing orbit and is scattered inward by Saturn onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit. Repeated gravitational encounters with the ice giant cause jumps in Jupiter's and Saturn's semi-major axes, driving a step-wise separation of their orbits, leading to a rapid increase of the ratio of their [[orbital period|period]]s until it is greater than 2.3.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2009" /&gt; The ice giant also encounters Uranus and Neptune and crosses parts of the [[asteroid belt]] as these encounters increase the eccentricity and semi-major axis of its orbit.&lt;ref name="Roig_Nesvorny_2015" /&gt; After 10,000–100,000 years,&lt;ref name="Morbidelli_etal_2010" /&gt; the ice giant is ejected from the Solar System following an encounter with Jupiter, becoming a [[rogue planet]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_2011" /&gt; The remaining planets then continue to migrate at a declining rate and slowly approach their final orbits as most of the remaining planetesimal disk is removed.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2016" /&gt;

The migrations of the giant planets and encounters between them have many effects throughout the Solar System.

Specifically, one of the ice giants was scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit by a gravitational encounter with Saturn, after which it was scattered outward by a gravitational encounter with Jupiter.&lt;ref name="Brasser_etal_2009" /&gt; As a result, Jupiter's and Saturn's orbits rapidly diverged, accelerating the sweeping of the secular resonances. This evolution of the orbits of the giant planets, similar to processes described by [[exoplanet]] researchers, is referred to as the [[jumping-Jupiter scenario]].&lt;ref name=Fasset_Minton_2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fassett|first=Caleb I.|author2=Minton, David A.|title=Impact bombardment of the terrestrial planets and the early history of the Solar System|journal=Nature Geoscience|date=2013|volume=6|issue=7|pages=520–524|doi=10.1038/ngeo1841|url=http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/full/ngeo1841.html|bibcode = 2013NatGe...6..520F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ejected planet===

The encounters between the ice giant and Jupiter in the jumping-Jupiter scenario often lead to the ejection of the ice giant. For this ice giant to be retained its eccentricity must be damped by [[dynamical friction]] with the planetesimal disk, raising its perihelion beyond Saturn's orbit. The planetesimal disk masses typically used in the Nice model are often insufficient for this, leaving systems beginning with four giant planets with only three at the end of the instability. The ejection of the ice giant can be avoided if the disk mass is larger, but the separation of Jupiter and Saturn often grows too large and their eccentricities become too small as the larger disk is cleared. These problems led David Nesvorný of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] to propose that the Solar System began with five giant planets, with an additional Neptune-mass planet between Saturn and Uranus.&lt;ref name=Nesvorny_2011 /&gt; Using thousands of simulations with a variety of initial conditions he found that the simulations beginning with five giant planets were ten times more likely to reproduce the orbits of the outer planets.&lt;ref name=Stuart_2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Stuart|first=Colin|title=Was a giant planet ejected from our solar system?|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2011/nov/21/was-a-giant-planet-ejected-from-our-solar-system|publisher=Physics World|accessdate=16 January 2014|date=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study by David Nesvorný and Alessandro Morbidelli found that the required jump in the ratio of Jupiter's and Saturn's periods occurred and the orbits of the outer planets were reproduced in 5% of simulations for one five-planet system vs less than 1% for four-planet systems. The most successful began with a significant migration of Neptune, disrupting the planetesimal disk, before planetary encounters were triggered by resonance crossing. This reduces secular friction, allowing Jupiter's eccentricity to be preserved after it is excited by resonance crossings and planetary encounters.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Nesvorný |first=David |last2=Morbidelli |first2=Alessandro |title=Statistical Study of the Early Solar System's Instability with Four, Five, and Six Giant Planets |journal=The Astronomical Journal |date=2012 |volume=144 |issue=4 |page=17 |doi=10.1088/0004-6256/144/4/117 |arxiv=1208.2957 |bibcode=2012AJ....144..117N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Konstantin Batygin]], [[Michael E.

A number of previous works also modeled Solar Systems with extra giant planets. A study by Thommes, Bryden, Wu, and Rasio included simulations of four and five planets beginning in resonant chains. Loose resonant chains of four or five planets with Jupiter and Saturn beginning in a 2:1 resonance often resulted in the loss of an ice giant for small mass planetesimal disks. The loss of a planet was avoided in four planet systems with a larger planetesimal disk but no scattering of planets occurred. A more compact system with Jupiter and Saturn in a 3:2 resonance sometimes resulted in encounters occurring between Jupiter and Saturn.&lt;ref name="Thommes_etal_2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thommes|first1=Edward W.|last2=Bryden|first2=Geoffrey|last3=Wu|first3=Yanqin|last4=Rasio|first4=Frederic A|title=From Mean Motion Resonances to Scattered Planets: Producing the Solar System, Eccentric Exoplanets, and Late Heavy Bombardments|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|date=2007|volume=675|issue=2|pages=1538–1548|doi=10.1086/525244|arxiv=0706.1235|bibcode=2008ApJ...675.1538T}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by Morbidelli, Tsiganis, Crida, Levison, and Gomes was more successful in reproducing the Solar System beginning with a four planet system in a compact resonant chain.

===Initial conditions===

The giant planets begin in a chain of resonances. During their formation in the protoplanetary disk, interactions between the giant planets and the gas disk caused them to migrate inward toward the Sun. Jupiter's inward migration continued until it was halted, or reversed, as in the [[Grand tack hypothesis|Grand Tack]] model, when it captured a faster migrating Saturn in a mean-motion resonance.&lt;ref name=Masset_2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Masset|first=F.|author2=Snellgrove, M.|title=Reversing type II migration: resonance trapping of a lighter giant protoplanet|journal=[[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]]|date=2001|volume=320|issue=4|pages=L55–L59|doi=10.1046/j.1365-8711.2001.04159.x|arxiv=astro-ph/0003421|bibcode = 2001MNRAS.320L..55M }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resonance chain was extended as the three ice giants also migrated inward and were captured in further resonances.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012" /&gt; A long-range migration of Neptune outward into the planetesimal disk before planetary encounters begins is most likely if the planets were captured in a 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 resonance chain, occurring in 65% of simulations when the inner edge was within 2 [[Astronomical unit|AU]]. While this resonance chain has the highest likelihood of reproducing Neptune's migration other resonance chains are also possible if the instability occurred early.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017" /&gt;

A late instability may have followed an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. The combination of a late escape from a resonance chain, as described in the [[Nice 2 model]], and a long-range migration of Neptune is unlikely. If the inner edge of the planetesimal disk is close an early escape from resonance occurs, if it is distant an instability typically triggered before a significant migration of Neptune occurs. This gap may be bridged if an early escape from resonance is followed by an extended period of slow dust-driven migration. Resonance chains other than the 3:2, 3:2, 2:1, 3:2 are unlikely in this case. Instabilities occur during the slow migration for tighter resonance chains and the distant disk is unrealistically narrow for more relaxed resonance chains. The rate of dust-driven migration slows with time as the rate of dust generation declines. As a result, the timing of the instability is sensitive to factors that determine the rate of dust generation such as the size distribution and the strength of the planetesimals.&lt;ref name="Deienno_etal_2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deienno|first1=Rogerio|last2=Morbidelli|first2=Alessandro|last3=Gomes|first3=Rodney S.|last4=Nesvorny|first4=David|title=Constraining the giant planets' initial configuration from their evolution: implications for the timing of the planetary instability|date=2017|arxiv=1702.02094|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aa5eaa|volume=153|issue=4|journal=The Astronomical Journal|page=153|bibcode = 2017AJ....153..153D }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Timing of the instability===

The timing of the instability in the Nice model was initially proposed to have coincided with the Late Heavy Bombardment, a spike in the impact rate thought to have occurred several million years after the formation of the Solar System. However, recently a number of issues have been raised regarding the timing of the Nice model instability, whether it was the cause of the Late Heavy Bombardment, and if an alternative would better explain the associated craters and impact basins. Most of the effects of the Nice model instability on the orbits of the giant planets and those of the various small body populations from the asteroid belt outward to the scattered disk are independent of its timing, however.

A five-planet Nice model with a late instability has a low probability of reproducing the orbits of the terrestrial planets. Jupiter's and Saturn's period ratio makes the required jump in a small fraction of simulations (7%–8.7%)&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_Morbidelli_2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Kaib_Chambers_2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaib|first1=Nathan A.|last2=Chambers|first2=John E.|title=The fragility of the terrestrial planets during a giant-planet instability|journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society|date=2016|volume=455|issue=4|pages=3561–3569|doi=10.1093/mnras/stv2554|url=http://mnras.oxfordjournals.org/content/455/4/3561|bibcode = 2016MNRAS.455.3561K |arxiv = 1510.08448}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the eccentricities of the terrestrial planets can also be excited when Jupiter encounters the ice giant.&lt;ref name="Agnor_Lin_2012" /&gt; In a study by Nathan Kaib and John Chambers this resulted in the orbits of the terrestrial planets being reproduced in a few percent of simulation with only 1% reproducing both the terrestrial and giant planets orbits. This led Kaib and Chambers to propose that the instability occurred early, before the formation of the terrestrial planets.&lt;ref name="Kaib_Chambers_2016" /&gt; However, a jump in the ratio of the orbital periods of Jupiter and Saturn is still required to reproduce the asteroid belt, reducing the advantage of an early instability.&lt;ref name="Walsh_Morbidelli_2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Walsh|first1=K.

Sufficient mass may not remain in the planetesimal disk after 400 million years of collisional grinding to fit models of the instability. If the size distribution of the planetesimal disk initially resembled its current distribution and included 1000's of Pluto mass objects significant mass loss occurs. This leaves the disk with under 10 Earth masses, while a minimum of 15 Earth masses is needed in current models of the instability. The size distribution also becomes shallower than is observed. These problems remain even if simulations begin with a more massive disk or a steeper size distribution. In contrast, a much lower mass loss and little change in the size distribution occurs during a early instability.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018a"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nesvorny|first1=David|last2=Parker|first2=Joel|last3=Vokrouhlicky|first3=David|title=Bi-lobed Shape of Comet 67P from a Collapsed Binary|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2018|volume=155|issue=6|page=246|doi=10.3847/1538-3881/aac01f|arxiv=1804.08735|bibcode=2018AJ....155..246N}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the planetesimal disk began without Pluto mass objects collisional grinding would begin as they formed from smaller object, with the timing depending on the initial size of the objects and mass of the planetesimal disk.&lt;ref name="Kenyon_Bromley_2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kenyon|first1=Scott J.|last2=Bromley|first2=Benjamin C.|title=Coagulation Calculations of Icy Planet Formation at 15-150 AU: A Correlation between the Maximum Radius and the Slope of the Size Distribution for Trans-Neptunian Objects|journal=The Astronomical Journal|date=2012|volume=143|issue=3|page=63|doi=10.1088/0004-6256/143/3/63|arxiv=1201.4395|bibcode=2012AJ....143...63K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Binary objects such as [[617 Patroclus|Patroclus]]-Menoetius would be separated due to the collisions if the instability was late. Patroclus and Menoetius are a pair of ~100 km objects orbiting with a separation of 680 km and relative velocities of ~11 m/s. While this binary remains in a massive planetesimal disk it is vulnerable to being separated due to collision. Roughly ~90% of similar binaries are separated per hundred million years in simulations and after 400 million years its survival probabilities falls to 7 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;. The presence of Patroclus-Menoetius among the Jupiter Trojans requires that the giant planet instability occurred within 100 million years of the formation of the Solar System.&lt;ref name="Nesvorny_etal_2018b"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nesvorný |first1=David |last2=Vokrouhlický |first2=David |last3=Bottke |first3=William F. |last4=Levison |first4=Harold F. |title=Evidence for very early migration of the Solar System planets from the Patroclus–Menoetius binary Jupiter Trojan |journal=Nature Astronomy |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=878–882 |date=2018 |doi=10.1038/s41550-018-0564-3 |arxiv=1809.04007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed names==
According to Nesvorný, colleagues have suggested several names for the hypothetical fifth giant planet—[[Hades]], after the Greek god of the underworld; [[Liber]], after the Roman god of wine and a cognate of [[Dionysus]] and [[Bacchus]]; and [[Mefitis|Mephitis]], after the Roman goddess of toxic gases. Another suggestion is "Thing 1" from Dr. Seuss's ''[[Cat in the Hat]]'' children's book.&lt;ref&gt;A New Name for an Old Planet: ''New Scientist'': 01.10.2011: 15, https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20952-missing-planet-explains-solar-systems-structure/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes on Planet Nine==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14177">'''Focal dystonia''' is a neurological condition, a type of ''[[dystonia]]'', that affects a muscle or group of muscles in a specific part of the body, causing involuntary muscular contractions and abnormal postures. For example, in [[writer's cramp|focal hand dystonia]], the [[finger]]s either curl into the [[hand|palm]] or extend outward without control. In musicians, the condition is called ''musician's focal dystonia'', or simply, ''musician's dystonia''. In sports, it is commonly referred to as the ''[[yips]]''.

==Causes==
Current medical science does not precisely describe the causes of dystonia. Misfiring of [[neuron]]s in the [[sensorimotor cortex]], a thin layer of neural tissue that covers the brain, is thought to cause contractions. This misfiring may result from impaired inhibitory mechanisms during muscle contraction.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hallet|first=Mark|title=Neurophysiology of dystonia: The role of inhibition|journal=Neurobiology of Disease|year=2011|volume=42|pages=177–184|doi=10.1016/j.nbd.2010.08.025|pmc=3016461}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the brain tells a given muscle to contract, it simultaneously silences muscles that would oppose the intended movement. It appears that dystonia interferes with the brain's ability to inhibit those surrounding muscles, leading to loss of selectivity.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The sensorimotor cortex is organized as discrete "maps" of the human body. Under normal conditions, each body part (such as individual fingers) occupies a distinct area on these cortical maps. In dystonia, these maps lose their distinct borders and overlap occurs.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Byl | first1 = NN | last2 = Merzenich | first2 = MM | last3 = Jenkins | first3 = WM. | year = 1996 | title = A primate genesis model of focal dystonia and repetitive strain injury: I. Learning-induced dedifferentiation of the representation of the hand in the primary somatosensory cortex in adult monkeys | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 47 | issue = 2| pages = 508–20 | pmid = 8757029 | doi=10.1212/wnl.47.2.508}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploration of this initially involved over-training particular finger movements in non-human primates, which resulted in the development of focal hand dystonia. Examination of the primary somatosensory cortex in the trained animals showed grossly distorted representations of the maps pertaining to the fingers when compared to the untrained animals.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Additionally, these maps in the dystonic animals had lost the distinct borders that were noted in the untrained animals.

Imaging studies in humans with focal dystonia have confirmed this finding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bara-Jimenez | first1 = W | last2 = Catalan | first2 = MJ | last3 = Hallett | first3 = M | last4 = Gerloff | first4 = C | title = Abnormal somatosensory homunculus in dystonia of the hand | journal = Annals of Neurology | volume = 44 | issue = 5 | pages = 828–831 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9818942 | doi = 10.1002/ana.410440520 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, synchronous [[Afferent nerve fiber|afferent]] stimulation of peripheral muscles induces organizational changes in motor representations, characterized both by an increase in map size of stimulated muscles and a reduction in map separation, as assessed using [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schabrun SM, Ridding MC | year = 2007 | title = The influence of correlated afferent input on motor cortical representations in humans | url = | journal = Experimental Brain Research | volume = 183 | issue = 1| pages = 41–49 | doi = 10.1007/s00221-007-1019-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cross-connectivity between areas that are normally segregated in the sensory cortex may prevent normal sensorimotor feedback and so contribute to the observed co-contraction of antagonist muscle groups, and inappropriately timed and sequenced movements that underlie the symptoms of focal dystonia. It is hypothesized that a deficit in inhibition caused by a genetically mediated loss of inhibitory [[interneurons]] may be the underlying cause of the deficits observed in dystonia.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

While usually painless, in some instances the sustained contraction and abnormal posturing in dystonia cause pain. Focal dystonia most typically affects people who rely on fine motor skills—musicians, writers, surgeons, etc. It is thought that the excessive motor training those skills require may contribute to the development of dystonia as their cortical maps become enlarged and begin to overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenkranz|first=Karin|author2=Katherine Butler |author3=Aaron Williamon |author4=John C. Rothwell |title=Regaining Motor Control in Musician’s Dystonia by Restoring Sensorimotor Organization|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=November 18, 2009|volume=29|issue=46|pages=14627–14636|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.2094-09.2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Focal dystonia is generally "task-specific," meaning that it is only problematic during certain activities.

* [[Keith Emerson]], pianist and keyboard player 
* [[Leon Fleisher]], an international concert pianist, dealt with this condition in his right hand beginning in the 1960s and switched to only left hand playing. In the 2000s, he regained use of his right hand and recommenced performing and recording with two hands.
* [[Dominic Frasca]], Guitarist 
* [[Gary Graffman]], pianist, who changed to performing only with his left hand.

* [[Christian Münzner]], ex-lead guitar of progressive extreme metal band [[Obscura (band)|Obscura]]
* [[Apostolos Paraskevas]], Greek-American classical guitarist-composer, was struck by focal dystonia to his right hand in 2009. He fully recovered in 2013 after 7,000 hours of personal work in re-constructing his technique. He was able to decode the condition as an ''unconscious behavioral habit'' and returned to performing professionally again. His rehabilitation was based on reducing tension in his hand and retraining his brain through proper, relaxed hand movements, practiced extensively. His article ''A Classical Guitarist's Story of Recovery from Focal Dystonia'' will be published in London on the ''Classical Guitar Magazine''
* [[Charlie Parr]], American country blues musician from Minnesota &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/music/man-of-constant-sorrow-charlie-parrs-quiet-battle-to-stay-alive/442806393|title=Man of constant sorrow: Charlie Parr's quiet battle to stay alive - City Pages|first=Erica|last=Rivera|date=|website=City Pages|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
This condition is often treated with injections of [[botulinum neurotoxin A]] (BoNT/A). BoNT/A reduces the symptoms of the disorder but it is not a cure for dystonia. Since the root of the problem is neurological, doctors have explored sensorimotor retraining activities to enable the brain to "rewire" itself and eliminate dystonic movements. The work of several doctors such as Nancy Byl and Joaquin Farias has shown that sensorimotor retraining activities and proprioceptive stimulation can induce [[neuroplasticity]], making it possible for patients to recover substantial function that was lost to focal dystonia.&lt;ref&gt;TEDx Talk.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7553">'''Functional contextualism''' is a modern [[philosophy of science]]{{Citation needed|date=November 2018|reason=Needs a citation from a Philosophy of Science s source.}} rooted in philosophical [[pragmatism]] and [[contextualism]]. It is most actively developed in [[behavioral science]] in general and the field of [[behavior analysis]] and contextual behavioral science in particular (see the entry for the [[Association for Contextual Behavioral Science]]). Functional contextualism serves as the basis of a theory of language known as [[relational frame theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Barnes-Holmes, D. &amp; Roche, B. (Eds.). (2001). ''Relational Frame Theory: A Post-Skinnerian account of human language and cognition''. New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and its most prominent application, [[acceptance and commitment therapy]].&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C.; Strosahl, K. &amp; Wilson, K.G. (1999). ''Acceptance and Commitment Therapy: An experiential approach to behavior change''. New York: Guilford Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an extension and contextualistic interpretation of [[B.F. Skinner]]'s [[radical behaviorism]] first delineated by [[Steven C. Hayes]] which emphasizes the importance of predicting and influencing psychological events (including thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) with precision, scope, and depth, by focusing on manipulable variables in their context.

==Contextualism==
The form of contextualism from which functional contextualism emerged is the one described by the philosopher [[Stephen C. Pepper]] in his book ''[[World Hypotheses]]: A Study in Evidence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, S.C. (1942). ''World hypotheses: A study in evidence''. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In this work, Pepper noted that philosophical systems tend to cluster around a few distinct "world hypotheses" or "[[world view]]s". Each world view is characterized by a distinctive underlying root metaphor and [[Truth#Substantive theories|truth criterion]]. Root metaphors are based on seemingly well-understood, common-sense, everyday objects or ideas, and serve as the basic analogy by which an analyst attempts to understand the world. A world view's root metaphor roughly corresponds to its [[ontological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of being or existence (e.g., whether the universe is deterministic or not). Truth criteria are inextricably linked to their root metaphors, and provide the basis for evaluating the validity of analyses. A world view's truth criterion roughly corresponds to its [[epistemological]] assumptions, or views about the nature of knowledge and truth (e.g., whether it is discovered or constructed).

The root metaphor of contextualism is the "act in context", whereby any event is interpreted as an ongoing act inseparable from its current and historical context. The truth criterion of contextualism is often dubbed "successful working", whereby the truth and meaning of an idea lies in its function or utility, not in how well it is said to mirror reality. In contextualism, an analysis is said to be true or valid insofar it as it leads to effective action, or achievement of some goal. Contextualism is Pepper's term for the philosophical [[pragmatism]] developed by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and others.

===Varieties of contextualism===
Analytic goals are vitally important to the contextualistic world view. This is because the analytic tools of contextualism—its root metaphor and truth criterion—both hinge on the purpose of the analysis, and neither can be mounted effectively without a clearly specified analytic goal. The pragmatic truth criterion of "successful working" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because "success" can only be measured in relation to the achievement of some objective.&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, J. (1953). ''Essays in experimental logic''. New York: Dover (Original work published 1916)&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, the root metaphor of the "act-in-context" is rendered meaningless in an analysis without an explicit goal because there would be no basis on which to restrict the analysis to a subset of the infinite expanse of the act's historical and environmental context.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, E.V. &amp; Hayes, S.C. (1999). Functional contextualism: A pragmatic philosophy for behavioral science. In W. O'Donohue &amp; R. Kitchener (Eds.), ''Handbook of behaviorism'' (pp. 285–327). San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Without a clear analytic goal, the contextualist could analyze the endless context of an act in perpetuity, without ever knowing when the analysis was complete or good enough to be deemed "true" or "useful". It is very difficult for a contextualist without an explicit goal to construct or share knowledge.

Contextualists can, and do, adopt different analytic goals, and the many different varieties of contextualism can be distinguished by their goals.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, S.C. (1993). Analytic goals and the varieties of scientific contextualism. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 11–27). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Based on their overarching analytic goals, contextualistic theories can be divided into two general categories: "descriptive contextualism" and "functional contextualism".

====Descriptive contextualism====
Descriptive contextualists seek to understand the complexity and richness of a whole event through a personal and aesthetic appreciation of its participants and features. This approach reveals a strong adherence to the root metaphor of contextualism and can be likened to the enterprise of [[history]], in which stories of the past are constructed in an attempt to understand whole events. The knowledge constructed by the descriptive contextualist is personal, ephemeral, specific, and spatiotemporally restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, E.K. (1993). Contextualism, historiography, and the history of behavior analysis. In S.C. Hayes, L.J. Hayes, H.W. Reese &amp; T.R. Sarbin (Eds.), ''Varieties of scientific contextualism'' (pp. 137-165). Reno, NV: Context Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a [[historical narrative]], it is knowledge that reflects an in-depth personal understanding of a particular event that occurred (or is occurring) at a particular time and place. Most forms of contextualism, including [[social constructionism]], [[dramaturgy]], [[hermeneutics]], and narrative approaches, are instances of descriptive contextualism.

====Functional contextualism====
Functional contextualists, on the other hand, seek to predict and influence events using empirically based concepts and rules. This approach reveals a strong adherence to contextualism's extremely practical truth criterion and can be likened to the enterprise of [[science]] or [[engineering]], in which general rules and principles are used to predict and influence events. Rules or theories that do not contribute to the achievement of one's practical goals are ignored or rejected. Knowledge constructed by the functional contextualist is general, abstract, and spatiotemporally unrestricted.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, E. J. (2006). Constructing a pragmatic science of learning and instruction with functional contextualism. ''Educational Technology Research &amp; Development, 54'' (1), 5-36.&lt;/ref&gt; Like a scientific principle, it is knowledge that is likely to be applicable to all (or many) similar such events, regardless of time or place.

'''Glazing''', which derives from the [[Middle English]] for 'glass', is a part of a [[wall]] or [[window]], made of [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing Merriam-Webster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231000931/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/glazing |date=2011-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Definition of ''glazing'' at [http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing Cambridge Dictionaries Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930065434/http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/glazing?q=glazing |date=2012-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glazing also describes the work done by a professional "[[glazier]]". Glazing is also less commonly used to describe the insertion of ophthalmic lenses into an eyeglass frame.

Common types of glazing that are used in architectural applications include clear and tinted [[float glass]], [[tempered glass]], and [[laminated glass]] as well as a variety of coated glasses, all of which can be glazed singly or as [[Insulated glazing|double, or even triple]], glazing units. Ordinary clear glass has a slight green tinge but special colorless glasses are offered by several manufacturers.

Glazing can be mounted on the surface of a [[window]] [[Sash window|sash]] or [[door]] [[Frame and panel|stile]], usually made of [[wood]], [[aluminium]] or [[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]]. The glass is fixed into a [[rabbet|rabbet (rebate)]] in the frame in a number of ways including triangular glazing points, [[putty]], etc.  Toughened and laminated glass can be glazed by bolting panes directly to a metal framework by bolts passing through drilled holes.

Glazing is commonly used in low temperature solar thermal collectors because it helps retain the collected heat.

[[File:Fra Carnevale - The Ideal City - Walters 37677.jpg|thumb|500px|''The Ideal City'' by [[Fra Carnevale]], c. between 1480-1484.]]
An '''ideal city''' is the concept of a [[City planning|plan]] for a [[city]] that has been conceived in accordance with a particular rational or moral objective.

==Concept==
The "ideal" nature of such a city may encompass the [[moral]], [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[juridical]] qualities of [[citizenship]] as well as the ways in which these are realised through urban structures including buildings, street layout, etc.  The ground plans of ideal cities are often based on grids (in imitation of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] town planning) or other geometrical patterns.  The ideal city is often an attempt to deploy [[Utopian]] ideals at the local level of urban configuration and living space and amenity rather than at the culture- or civilisation-wide level of the classical Utopias such as [[St Thomas More]]'s [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]].

==History==
[[File:Formerly_Piero_della_Francesca_-_Ideal_City_-_Galleria_Nazionale_delle_Marche_Urbino_2.jpg|thumb|350px|The ideal city attributed to [[Luciano Laurana]] or [[Melozzo da Forlì]].]]
Several attempts to develop ideal city plans are known from the [[Renaissance]], and appear from the second half of the fifteenth century. The concept dates at least from the period of [[Plato]], whose ''[[The Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' is a philosophical exploration of the notion of the 'ideal city'.   The nobility of the Renaissance, seeking to imitate the qualities of [[Classical antiquity|Classical civilisation]], sometimes sought to construct such ideal cities either in reality or notionally through a reformation of manners and culture.

==Examples==
[[File:Idealstadt.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan of [[Sforzinda]], Filarete, c. 1465]]
[[Image:Palmanova1600.jpg|thumb|left|Map of [[Palmanova]] in 1593. The town is encircled by massive [[Venetian Works of Defence between 15th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Venetian Defensive Systems]] that are a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]].&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/331/|title=The city of Bergamo - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|last=Centre|first=UNESCO World Heritage|website=whc.unesco.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Examples of the ideal cities include [[Filarete]]'s "[[Sforzinda]]", a description of which was included in his ''Trattato di Architettura'' (c. 1465).  The city of Sforzinda was laid out within an eight-pointed star inscribed within a circular [[moat]].  Further examples may have been intended to have been read into the so-called "Urbino" and "Baltimore" panels (second half of the fifteenth century), which show [[Classical architecture|Classically]] influenced architecture disposed in logically planned [[piazza]]s. The cities of [[Palmanova]] and [[Nicosia]], whose [[Venetian Works of Defence between the 16th and 17th centuries: Stato da Terra – western Stato da Mar|Ventian Fortess]] were built in the 1590s by the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], are considered to be practical examples of the concept of the ideal city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cosmescu|first1=Dragos|title=Nicosia|url=http://fortified-places.com/nicosia/|website=fortified-places.com|accessdate=18 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable example of the concept is [[Zamość]] in eastern [[Poland]] founded in the late 16th century, modelled by the Italian architect [[Bernardo Morando]].

[[James Oglethorpe]] synthesized Classical and Renaissance concepts of the ideal city with new [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals of scientific planning, harmony in design, and social equality in his plan for the [[Province of Carolina]]. The physical design component of the famous [[Oglethorpe Plan]] remains preserved in the [[Savannah Historic District (Savannah, Georgia)|Savannah Historic District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Thomas D. ''The Oglethorpe Plan: Enlightenment Design in Savannah and Beyond''. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late nineteenth-century examples of the ideal city include the [[Garden city movement]] of Sir [[Ebenezer Howard]], realised at [[Letchworth Garden City]] and [[Welwyn Garden City]] in England.  [[Poundbury]], [[Prince Charles]]' architectural vision established in [[Dorset]], is among the most recent examples of ideal city planning.

'''Image resolution''' is the detail an [[image]] holds. The term applies to raster [[digital image]]s, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more image detail.

Image resolution can be measured in various ways. Resolution quantifies how close lines can be to each other and still be [[Visual perception|visibly]] ''resolved''.  Resolution units can be tied to physical sizes (e.g. lines per mm, lines per inch), to the overall size of a picture (lines per picture height, also known simply as lines, [[TV lines]], or TVL), or to angular subtense.  Line pairs are often used instead of lines; a line pair comprises a dark line and an adjacent light line. A line is either a dark line or a light line. A resolution of 10 lines per millimeter means 5 dark lines alternating with 5 light lines, or 5 line pairs per millimeter (5 LP/mm).  [[Photographic lens]] and [[Photographic film|film resolution]] are most often quoted in line pairs per millimeter.

==Resolution of digital images==

The resolution of digital cameras can be described in many different ways.

===Pixel resolution===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[PlayStation Eye]] --&gt;
The term ''resolution'' is often considered equivalent to [[pixel]] count in digital imaging, though international standards in the [[digital camera]] field specify it should instead be called "Number of Total Pixels" in relation to image sensors, and as "Number of Recorded Pixels" for what is fully captured. Hence, JCIA &amp; CIPA suggest notation such as  "Number of Recorded Pixels 1000 × 1500".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cipa.jp/std/documents/e/DCG-001_E.pdf] Guideline for Noting Digital Camera Specifications in Catalogs. "The term 'Resolution' shall not be used for the number of recorded pixels"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051126202022/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=ANSI%2FI3A+IT10%2E7000%2D2004 ANSI/I3A IT10.7000-2004]  Photography - Digital Still Cameras - Guidelines for Reporting Pixel-Related Specifications&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same standards, the "Number of Effective Pixels" that an [[image sensor]] or [[digital camera]] has is the count of [[pixel]] sensors that contribute to the final image (including pixels not in said image but nevertheless support the image filtering process), as opposed to the number of ''total pixels'', which includes unused or light-shielded pixels around the edges.

An image of N pixels height by M pixels wide can have any resolution less than N lines per picture height, or N TV lines.  But when the pixel counts are referred to as "resolution", the convention is to describe the ''pixel resolution'' with the set of two positive [[integer]] numbers, where the first number is the number of pixel columns (width) and the second is the number of pixel rows (height), for example as ''7680 × 6876''. Another popular convention is to cite resolution as the total number of pixels in the image, typically given as number of [[megapixel]]s, which can be calculated by multiplying pixel columns by pixel rows and dividing by one million. Other conventions include describing pixels per length unit or pixels per area unit, such as [[pixels per inch]] or per square inch.  None of these ''pixel resolutions'' are true resolutions{{Clarification needed|reason=|date=August 2017}}, but they are widely referred to as such; they serve as [[upper bound]]s on image resolution.

Below is an illustration of how the same image might appear at different pixel resolutions, if the pixels were poorly rendered as sharp squares (normally, a smooth image reconstruction from pixels would be preferred, but for illustration of pixels, the sharp squares make the point better).

[[Image:Resolution illustration.png]]

An image that is 2048 pixels in width and 1536 pixels in height has a total of 2048&amp;times;1536 = 3,145,728 pixels or 3.1 megapixels.  One could refer to it as 2048 by 1536 or a 3.1-megapixel image. Or, you can think of it as a very low quality image (72ppi) if printed at about 28.5 inches wide, or a very good quality (300ppi) image if printed at about 7 inches wide.

Unfortunately, the count of pixels isn't a real measure of the resolution of [[digital camera]] images, because color [[image sensors]] are typically set up to [[Bayer filter|alternate color filter types]] over the light sensitive individual pixel sensors.  Digital images ultimately require a red, green, and blue value for each pixel to be displayed or printed, but one individual pixel in the image sensor will only supply one of those three pieces of information.  The image has to be interpolated or [[demosaic]]ed to produce all three colors for each output pixel.

=== Spatial resolution ===
{{main|Focus (optics)}}
The terms blurriness and sharpness are used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images.

Spatial resolution in radiology refers to the ability of the imaging modality to differentiate two objects. Low spatial resolution techniques will be unable to differentiate between two objects that are relatively close together.
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:1951 USAF Resolution Test Target.JPG|thumb|right|250px|The [[1951 USAF resolution test chart|1951 USAF resolution test target]] is a classic test target used to determine spatial resolution of imaging sensors and imaging systems.]] --&gt;
{{multiple image
| footer    = Image at left has a higher ''pixel count'' than the one to the right, but is still of worse spatial resolution.
| align     = right
| image1    = Matakis - blurred.jpg
| width1    = 200
| image2    = MARTAKIS1.jpg
| width2    = 200
}}

The measure of how closely lines can be resolved in an image is called spatial resolution, and it depends on properties of the system creating the image, not just the pixel resolution in [[pixels per inch]] (ppi). For practical purposes the clarity of the image is decided by its spatial resolution, not the number of pixels in an image. In effect, spatial resolution refers to the number of ''independent'' pixel values per unit length.

The spatial resolution of consumer displays range from 50 to 800 pixel lines per inch.  With scanners, [[optical resolution]] is sometimes used to distinguish spatial resolution from the number of pixels per inch.

In [[remote sensing]], spatial resolution is typically limited by [[diffraction limit|diffraction]], as well as by aberrations, imperfect focus, and atmospheric distortion.   The [[ground sample distance]] (GSD) of an image, the pixel spacing on the Earth's surface, is typically considerably smaller than the resolvable spot size.

In [[astronomy]], one often measures spatial resolution in data points per arcsecond subtended at the point of observation, because the physical distance between objects in the image depends on their distance away and this varies widely with the object of interest.  On the other hand, in [[electron microscopy]], line or fringe resolution refers to the minimum separation detectable between adjacent parallel lines (e.g. between planes of atoms), whereas ''point resolution'' instead refers to the minimum separation between adjacent points that can be both detected ''and interpreted'' e.g. as adjacent columns of atoms, for instance.  The former often helps one detect periodicity in specimens, whereas the latter (although more difficult to achieve) is key to visualizing how individual atoms interact.

In Stereoscopic 3D images, spatial resolution could be defined as the spatial information recorded or captured by two viewpoints of a stereo camera (left and right camera).

=== Spectral resolution ===
{{main|ICC profile}}
Pixel encoding limit the information stored in a digital image, and the term color profile is used for digital images but other descriptors are used to reference the hardware capturing and displaying the images. 

Spectral resolution is the ability to resolve spectral features and bands into their separate components. [[Color image]]s distinguish light of different [[visible spectrum|spectra]]. [[Multispectral image]]s can resolve even finer differences of spectrum or [[wavelength]] by measuring and storing more than the traditional 3 of common RGB color images.

=== Temporal resolution ===
{{main|Frame rate}}
Temporal resolution (TR) refers to the precision of a measurement with respect to time. 

[[Movie camera]]s and [[high-speed camera]]s can resolve events at different points in time. The time resolution used for movies is usually 24 to 48 [[frames per second]] (frames/s), whereas high-speed cameras may resolve 50 to 300 frames/s, or even more.

Many cameras and displays offset the color components relative to each other or mix up temporal with spatial resolution:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Bayer matrix.svg|[[digital camera]] (Bayer [[color filter array]])
Image:Lcd_display_dead_pixel.jpg|[[Liquid-crystal display|LCD]] (Triangular [[pixel geometry]])
Image:Shadow_mask_closeup_cursor.jpg|[[Cathode ray tube|CRT]] (shadow mask)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

In the quantum physics there is a trade-off between temporal resolution of a measurement and its spatial resolution due to uncertainty principle, similarly a time/space trade-off is an inherent property of [[Fourier transform]] used to visualise audio.185.127.125.171

=== Radiometric resolution ===
{{main|Color depth}}
[[Radiometric]] resolution determines how finely a system can represent or distinguish differences of [[luminous intensity|intensity]], and is usually expressed as a number of levels or a number of [[bit]]s, for example 8 bits or 256 levels that is typical of computer image files. The higher the radiometric resolution, the better subtle differences of intensity or [[reflectivity]] can be represented, at least in theory. In practice, the effective radiometric resolution is typically limited by the noise level, rather than by the number of bits of representation.

==Resolution in various media==
This is a list of traditional, analog horizontal resolutions for various media.  The list only includes popular formats, not rare formats, and all values are approximate, because the actual quality can vary machine-to-machine or tape-to-tape. For ease-of-comparison, all values are for the NTSC system. (For PAL systems, replace 480 with 576.) Analog formats usually had less chroma resolution.

'''Jack M. Sasson''', now retired, taught most recently as Mary Jane Werthan Professor of [[Jewish Studies]] and [[Hebrew Bible]] at [[Vanderbilt Divinity School]] and before that as a Professor of [[Classics]] at [[Vanderbilt University]].&lt;ref name="faculty"&gt;[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/divinity/facultypages/jsasson.php Vanderbilt Divinity School Faculty Pages]&lt;/ref&gt;  His research focuses primarily on [[Assyriology]] and [[Hebrew Scriptures]], writing on the archives from eighteenth century BCE found at [[Mari, Syria]], by the [[Euphrates]], near the modern-day Syria-Iraq border as well as on [[biblical studies]].

==Biography==
Born in [[Aleppo, Syria]], on October 1, 1941, Sasson immigrated to the [[United States]] in 1955 after a significant stay in [[Lebanon]] where he attended the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] schools.&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite web |author=Lew Harris |date=28 August 2000 |title=Syrian-born divinity professor discovers America as the land of opportunity |work=Vanderbilt Register |url=https://news.vanderbilt.edu/archived-news/register/articles/index-id=4369.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In America, Sasson enrolled in [[Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn, New York)|Abraham Lincoln High School]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]], and then [[Brooklyn College]], which later became a constituent school of the [[City University of New York]] college system.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt; He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in history in 1962 from [[Brooklyn College]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Immediately after completing his undergraduate education, Sasson accepted a scholarship to pursue his graduate studies at [[Brandeis University]]. At Brandeis, he focused first on [[Islamic Studies]], earning an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Mediterranean Studies in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Biblical Studies and Archaeology'', 2nd ed., 1993, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, however, he earned his doctorate in [[Ancient Near Eastern]] Studies in 1966, writing his dissertation under [[Cyrus Gordon]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Sasson taught at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], moving up the rank and becoming a full professor of Religious Studies in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Klebba, Caryn E. ''Directory of American Scholars 2002''. 10th ed., vol. 4, 437.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Sasson was appointed to the prestigious [[William R. Kenan Chair]] in Religious Studies where he remained until joining the faculty of [[Vanderbilt University]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;

Sasson was president of the [[American Oriental Society]] from 1996 to 1997 and of the [http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/IAA/ International Association for Assyriology] from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref name="faculty"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://people.vanderbilt.edu/~jack.m.sasson/curriculum_vitae.htm Jack M. Sasson's Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt; He also established and directed the [[Jewish Studies]] program at [[Vanderbilt University]] from 2002 to 2005.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

[[File:Lasse Nordlund by Marko Ulvila 2016-06-19.jpg|thumb|Lasse Nordlund summer 2016]]

'''Lasse Nordlund''' (1965) is a Finnish social thinker who is known for his experiment of living completely self-sufficiently in the Finnish countryside, producing his clothes and tools and cultivating his food from his small farm and what he gathered from the surrounding country.

==History==
Born in [[Helsinki]] to a Finnish father and a German mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/lantun-varassa/ |title=Hän elää luontaistaloudessa – ei omaisuutta, syö toista kiloa lanttua päivässä |website=[[Suomen Kuvalehti|Suomenkuvalehti.fi]] |access-date=November 26, 2017 |url-access=subscription |language=fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nordlund spent a typical youth in Germany and was interested in studying physics. However, he began to doubt the viability and meaning of conventional living and decided to try and live a self-sufficient lifestyle.

The background to Nordlund's experiment is his conviction that only [[Subsistence economy|subsistence living]] is materially sustainable on a long-term basis.

==The Experiment==

Nordlund could not, by his own admission, distinguish between a [[pine]] or a [[fir]] tree when he started his project, but started by studying books and experimenting to produce goods and obtain food. Eventually, he was able to live in [[Valtimo]], in [[North Karelia|Finnish North Karelia]], for the years between 1992 and 2004 in complete self-sufficiency.

According to Nordlund, one person needs about five [[Are (unit)|ares]] (500m²) of farmland to live on without buying any additional food. The most important food crop for him is the [[rutabaga]], a common Finnish staple. In his self-sufficient economy, Nordlund consumes 200&amp;nbsp;kg of mushrooms per year and about the same in berries preserved without additives or sugar. He forsook livestock because he projected the maintenance for example, animal feed) to be too time-consuming to make sense. Though he does accept the value of animal husbandry as wool and leather are handy clothing materials able to outlast cotton cloth. Nordlund became accustommed to life without salt, though many believe it to be life-threatening. He argues that he has been able to live without salt for years, although initially leaving out salt caused him some health issues. Instead of toilet paper, he uses dried [[sphagnum|sphagnum moss]]. In the early years of self-reliance, Nordlund's days were full of work, but eventually he was able to relax and take up hobbies from his youth, such as [[flute]] playing and working on equations.

==Recent==
He is an author and a speaker on sustainability topics.

Today, he lives with his family, still mostly self-sufficiently.

In 2008, Palladium books published a work written by Lasse Nordlund and Maria Dorff "The Foundations of Our Life, Reflections about Human labour, Money and Energy from Self-sufficiency Standpoint".

'''''Life After People''''' is a television series on which [[scientists]], [[structural engineers]], and other experts speculate about what might become of Earth [[Human extinction|should humanity instantly disappear]]. The featured experts also talk about the impact of human absence on the environment and the vestiges of civilization thus left behind. The series was preceded by a two-hour special that aired on January 21, 2008 on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]&lt;ref name=special&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people |title=Life After People — History.com TV Episodes, Schedule, &amp; Video |work=History.com |accessdate=August 3, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429170535/http://www.history.com/minisites/life_after_people/ |archivedate=April 29, 2009 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; which served as a de facto [[Television pilot|pilot]] for the series that premiered April 21, 2009. The documentary and subsequent series were both narrated by James Lurie.

==Format==
The program does not speculate on how humanity may disappear, stipulating only that it has, and that it has done so suddenly, leaving everything behind including household [[pets]] and [[livestock]] that have to fend for themselves. The [[thought experiment]] is based on documented results of the sudden removal of humans from a geographical area and the results that have occurred when people discontinue the maintenance of buildings and urban infrastructure. Lurie's narration begins:

{{cquote|What would happen if every human on Earth disappeared?  This ''isn't'' the story of how we might vanish...it's the story of what will happen to the world we leave behind}}

The series' episodes thematically offer examples of [[Urban decay|urban]] and [[Decomposition|biological decay]]. The focus is on specific locations such as [[skyscraper]]s, [[religious icons]], [[bridge]]s and [[dam]]s, and government buildings, and the fate of certain related objects, such as [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], [[document]]s and [[human body|human bodies]]. The fate of some kinds of [[plant|flora]] and [[animal|fauna]] are covered as well. Each episode also contains a segment in which experts examine real locations that have been abandoned by people, including [[ghost town]]s and other sites of deterioration, where the deterioration has been caused by events similar to those outlined in the episode. Although the series speculates on the fates of [[landmark]]s around the world, the main focus is on situations that may occur at locations in the United States.

The various events that may occur after people disappear suddenly are depicted using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] dramatizations. The timeline of predicted events begins approximately one day after the disappearance of humankind and extends up to one hundred million years into the future (one day, one week, one year, 10 years, 15 years, 25 years, 50 years, 100 years, 200 years, etc.).

===Tagline===
The program's tagline is the ominous greeting:

{{cquote|Welcome to Earth...Population: Zero. [while all episodes end with the title fitting the last sentence,] ...in a life after people}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6439">In [[computer science]], a '''linear bounded automaton''' (plural '''linear bounded automata''', abbreviated '''LBA''') is a restricted form of [[Turing machine]].

== Operation ==
A linear bounded automaton is a [[nondeterministic Turing machine]] that satisfies the following three conditions:

* Its input alphabet includes two special symbols, serving as left and right endmarkers.
* Its transitions may not print other symbols over the endmarkers.
* Its transitions may neither move to the left of the left endmarker nor to the right of the right endmarker.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"&gt;{{cite book| author1=John E. Hopcroft |author2=Jeffrey D. Ullman| author1link=John E. Hopcroft| author2link=Jeffrey D. Ullman|title=Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation| year=1979| publisher=Addison-Wesley| isbn=0-201-02988-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|225}}
In other words: 
instead of having potentially infinite tape on which to compute, computation is restricted to the portion of the tape containing the input plus the two tape squares holding the endmarkers. 

An alternative, '''less restrictive definition''' is as follows:
* Like a [[Turing machine]], an LBA possesses a tape made up of cells that can contain symbols from a [[finite set|finite]] [[alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]], a head that can read from or write to one cell on the tape at a time and can be moved, and a finite number of states. 
* An LBA differs from a [[Turing machine]] in that while the tape is initially considered to have unbounded length, only a finite contiguous portion of the tape, whose length is a [[linear function]] of the length of the initial input, can be accessed by the read/write head; hence the name ''linear bounded automaton''.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|225}}

This limitation makes an LBA a somewhat more accurate model of a real-world [[computer]] than a Turing machine, whose definition assumes unlimited tape.

The strong and the weaker definition lead to the same computational abilities of the respective automaton classes,&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|225}} due to the ''[[linear speedup theorem]]''.

==LBA and context-sensitive languages==
Linear bounded automata are [[acceptor (finite-state machine)|acceptor]]s for the class of [[context-sensitive language]]s.&lt;ref name="Hopcroft.Ullman.1979"/&gt;{{rp|225-226}}  The only restriction placed on [[Formal_grammar|grammars]] for such languages is that no production maps a string to a shorter string.  Thus no derivation of a string in a context-sensitive language can contain a [[sentential form]] longer than the string itself.  Since there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear-bounded automata and such grammars, no more tape than that occupied by the original string is necessary for the string to be recognized by the automaton.

==History==
In 1960, [[John Myhill]] introduced an automaton model today known as deterministic linear bounded automaton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report | author=John Myhill | authorlink=John Myhill | title=Linear Bounded Automata | institution=Wright Patterson AFB, Wright Air Development Division, Ohio | type=WADD Technical Note | number=60-165  | date=June 1960 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Peter S. Landweber proved that the languages accepted by deterministic LBAs are context-sensitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=P.S. Landweber | title=Three Theorems on Phrase Structure Grammars of Type 1 | journal=[[Information and Control]] | volume=6 | number=2 | pages=131&amp;mdash;136 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995863901694/pdf?md5=15d5b2836e2e59a70ed02fb4074b63f9&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0019995863901694-main.pdf | year=1963 | doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(63)90169-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, [[S.-Y. Kuroda]] introduced the more general model of (nondeterministic) linear bounded automata, noted that Landweber's proof also works for nondeterministic linear bounded automata, and showed that the languages accepted by them are precisely the context-sensitive languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Sige-Yuki Kuroda | authorlink=Sige-Yuki Kuroda |title=Classes of languages and linear-bounded automata | journal=Information and Control | volume=7 | number=2 | pages=207&amp;mdash;223 | url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019995864901202/pdf?md5=0a10da0e20ccd77c5d61461764f42e5f&amp;pid=1-s2.0-S0019995864901202-main.pdf | date=Jun 1964 | doi=10.1016/s0019-9958(64)90120-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Willem J. M. Levelt| authorlink=Willem Levelt| title=An Introduction to the Theory of Formal Languages and Automata|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tFvtwGYNe7kC&amp;pg=PA126|year=2008|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=90-272-3250-4|pages=126–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==LBA problems==
In his seminal paper, Kuroda also stated two research challenges, which subsequently became famously known as the "LBA problems": The first LBA problem is whether the class of languages accepted by LBA is equal to the class of languages accepted by deterministic LBA. This problem can be phrased succinctly in the language of [[computational complexity theory]] as:
:'''First LBA problem''': Is '''[[NSPACE]]'''(O(n)) = '''[[DSPACE]]'''(O(n))?
The second LBA problem is whether the class of languages accepted by LBA is closed under complement.
:'''Second LBA problem''': Is '''[[NSPACE]]'''(O(n)) = '''co-[[NSPACE]]'''(O(n))?
As observed already by Kuroda, a negative answer to the second LBA problem would imply a negative answer to the first problem. But the second LBA problem has an affirmative answer, which is implied by the [[Immerman–Szelepcsényi theorem]] proved 20 years after the problem was raised. As of today, the first LBA problem still remains open.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20268">'''Modelling biological systems''' is a significant task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]].{{efn|Sometimes called theoretical biology, dry biology, or even biomathematics.}} '''Computational systems biology'''{{efn|Computational systems biology is a branch that strives to generate a system-level understanding by analyzing biological data using computational techniques.}}&lt;ref&gt;Andres Kriete, Roland Eils, Computational Systems Biology, Elsevier Academic Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; aims to develop and use efficient [[algorithms]], [[data structures]], [[Biological data visualization|visualization]] and communication tools with the goal of [[computer modelling]] of biological systems. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of biological systems, including [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems (such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s), to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tavassoly|first=Iman|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Joseph|last3=Iyengar|first3=Ravi|date=2018-10-04|title=Systems biology primer: the basic methods and approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/early/2018/10/02/EBC20180003|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|volume=62|issue=4|language=en|pages=487–500|doi=10.1042/EBC20180003|issn=0071-1365|pmid=30287586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Artificial life]] or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.

An unexpected [[emergent property]] of a [[complex system]] may be a result of the interplay of the cause-and-effect among simpler, integrated parts (see [[biological organisation]]).  Biological systems manifest many important examples of emergent properties in the complex interplay of components. Traditional study of biological systems requires reductive methods in which quantities of data are gathered by category, such as concentration over time in response to a certain stimulus. Computers are critical to analysis and modelling of these data. The goal is to create accurate real-time models of a system's response to environmental and internal stimuli, such as a model of a cancer cell in order to find weaknesses in its signalling pathways, or modelling of ion channel mutations to see effects on cardiomyocytes and in turn, the function of a beating heart.

==Standards==
By far the most widely accepted standard format for storing and exchanging models in the field is the [[Systems Biology Markup Language| Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)]]&lt;ref&gt;Klipp, Liebermeister, Helbig, Kowald and Schaber. (2007). "Systems biology standards—the community speaks" (2007), Nature Biotechnology 25(4):390–391.&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://sbml.org/ SBML.org] website includes a guide to many important software packages used in computational systems biology.  A large number of models encoded in SBML can be retrieved from [[BioModels]]. Other markup languages with different emphases include [[BioPAX]] and [[CellML]].

==Particular tasks==

===Cellular model===
{{Main|Cellular model}}
[[File:Signal transduction pathways.svg|thumb|right|200px|Part of the [[cell cycle]]]]
[[File:EltonFW.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Summerhayes and Elton's 1923 food web of Bear Island (''Arrows represent an organism being consumed by another organism'').]]
[[File:Lotka Volterra dynamics.svg|thumb|300px|right|A sample [[Time series|time-series]] of the [[Lotka–Volterra equation|Lotka–Volterra model]].  Note that the two populations exhibit [[Limit cycle|cyclic behaviour]].]]
Creating a cellular model has been a particularly challenging task of [[systems biology]] and [[mathematical biology]]. It involves the use of [[computer simulation]]s of the many [[cell (biology)|cellular]] subsystems such as the [[metabolic network|networks of metabolites]] and [[enzyme]]s which comprise [[metabolism]], [[signal transduction]] pathways and [[gene regulatory network]]s to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes.

The complex network of biochemical reaction/transport processes and their spatial organization make the development of a [[predictive modelling|predictive model]] of a living cell a grand challenge for the 21st century, listed as such by the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1696.full American Association for the Advancement of Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

A whole cell computational model for the bacterium ''[[Mycoplasma genitalium]]'', including all its 525 genes, gene products, and their interactions, was built by scientists from Stanford University and the J. Craig Venter Institute and published on 20 July 2012 in Cell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674%2812%2900776-3 Karr, J. (2012) A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype Cell]&lt;/ref&gt;

A dynamic computer model of intracellular signaling was the basis for Merrimack Pharmaceuticals to discover the target for their cancer medicine MM-111.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mct.aacrjournals.org/content/early/2012/02/17/1535-7163.MCT-11-0820.short McDonagh, CF (2012) Antitumor Activity of a Novel Bispecific Antibody That Targets the ErbB2/ErbB3 Oncogenic Unit and Inhibits Heregulin-Induced Activation of ErbB3. Molecular Cancer Therapeutics ]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Membrane computing]] is the task of modelling specifically a [[cell membrane]].

===Multi-cellular organism simulation===
An open source simulation of C. elegans at the cellular level is being pursued by the [[OpenWorm]] community. So far the physics engine [https://github.com/openworm/OpenWorm/wiki/Geppetto--Overview Gepetto] has been built and models of the neural connectome and a muscle cell have been created in the NeuroML format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openworm.org/downloads.html OpenWorm Downloads&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protein folding===
{{Main|Protein folding problem}}
Protein structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein]] from its [[amino acid]] sequence—that is, the prediction of a protein's [[tertiary structure]] from its [[primary structure]].  It is one of the most important goals pursued by [[bioinformatics]] and [[theoretical chemistry]]. [[Protein structure prediction]] is of high importance in [[medicine]] (for example, in [[drug design]]) and [[biotechnology]] (for example, in the design of novel [[enzymes]]). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the [[CASP]] experiment.

===Human biological systems===

====Brain model====
The [[Blue Brain Project]] is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by [[Reverse engineering|reverse-engineering]] the [[mammalian brain]] down to the molecular level. The aim of this project, founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of the ''[[Ecole Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|École Polytechnique]]'' in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland, is to study the brain's architectural and functional principles. The project is headed by the Institute's director, Henry Markram. Using a [[Blue Gene]] [[supercomputer]] running Michael Hines's [[Neuron (software)|NEURON software]], the simulation does not consist simply of an [[artificial neural network]], but involves a partially biologically realistic model of [[neuron]]s.&lt;ref name="Brainsim"&gt;Graham-Rowe, Duncan. [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7470--mission-to-build-a-simulated-brain-begins.html "Mission to build a simulated brain begins"], ''NewScientist'', June 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8012496.stm Simulated brain closer to thought], BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; It is hoped by its proponents that it will eventually shed light on the nature of [[consciousness]].
There are a number of sub-projects, including the [[Cajal Blue Brain]], coordinated by the [[Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid]] (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories in the UK, U.S., and Israel. The Human Brain Project builds on the work of the Blue Brain Project.&lt;ref name="hbp_homepage"&gt;[http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html The Human Brain Project.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705000755/http://www.humanbrainproject.eu/index.html |date=July 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hbp_video"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4a-Om-1MrQ Video of Henry Markram presenting The Human Brain Project on 22 June 2012.]&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of six pilot projects in the Future Emerging Technologies Research Program of the European Commission,&lt;ref name="FET_flagships_homepage"&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/fp7/ict/programme/fet/flagship/home_en.html FET Flagships Initiative homepage.]&lt;/ref&gt; competing for a billion euro funding.

====Model of the immune system====
The last decade has seen the emergence of a growing number of simulations of the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/5qn66fvhu6cvlyvc/ Multi-criterion Evolutionary Algorithm with Model of the Immune System to Handle Constraints for Task Assignments - Springer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/05/090518111729.htm|title=Computer Simulation Captures Immune Response To Flu|accessdate=2009-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Virtual liver====
The [[virtual liver network|Virtual Liver]] project is a 43 million euro research program funded by the German Government, made up of seventy research group distributed across Germany. The goal is to produce a virtual liver, a dynamic mathematical model that represents human liver [[mathematical physiology|physiology]], morphology and function.&lt;ref name="virtual liver"&gt;[http://www.virtual-liver.de/ Virtual Liver Network.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tree model===
{{Main|Simulated growth of plants}}
Electronic trees (e-trees) usually use [[L-system]]s to simulate growth. L-systems are very important in the field of [[complexity science]] and [[A-life]].
A universally accepted system for describing changes in plant morphology at the cellular or modular level has yet to be devised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |title=Simulating plant growth |accessdate=2009-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209022645/http://www.acm.org/crossroads/xrds8-2/plantsim.html |archivedate=2009-12-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The most widely implemented tree generating algorithms are described in the papers [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=218427 "Creation and Rendering of Realistic Trees"], and [http://www.springerlink.com/content/n0nacdyjpyvxnnef/ Real-Time Tree Rendering]

===Ecological models===
{{Main|Ecosystem model}}
Ecosystem models are [[mathematics|mathematical]] representations of [[ecosystem]]s.  Typically they simplify complex [[food web|foodwebs]] down to their major components or [[trophic level]]s, and quantify these as either numbers of [[organism]]s, [[biomass]] or the [[inventory]]/[[concentration]] of some pertinent [[chemical element]] (for instance, [[carbon]] or a [[nutrient]] [[chemical species|species]] such as [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]]).

===Models in ecotoxicology===
The purpose of models in [[ecotoxicology]] is the understanding, simulation and prediction of effects caused by toxicants in the environment. Most current models describe effects on one of many different levels of biological organization (e.g. organisms or populations). A challenge is the development of models that predict effects across biological scales. [http://www.ecotoxmodels.org/ Ecotoxicology and models] discusses some types of ecotoxicological models and provides links to many others.

===Modelling of infectious disease===
{{Main|Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|Epidemic model}}
It is possible to model the progress of most infectious diseases mathematically to discover the likely outcome of an [[epidemic]] or to help manage them by [[vaccination]]. This field tries to find [[parameter]]s for various [[infectious disease]]s and to use those parameters to make useful calculations about the effects of a mass [[vaccination]] programme.

The '''National Music Centre''' ('''NMC'''; {{lang-fr|Centre nationale de musique}}) is a non-profit museum and performance venue located in [[Calgary|Calgary, Alberta, Canada]]. The centre's permanent building, branded '''Studio Bell''',&lt;ref name= Bain&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/travel/2016/09/08/7-reasons-to-love-canadas-new-national-music-centre.html|title=7 reasons to love Canada’s new National Music Centre|last=Bain|first=Jennifer|date=8 September 2016|work=Toronto Star|access-date=14 September 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located at 850 4th Street S.E. in [[Downtown East Village, Calgary|Downtown East Village]].

== History ==
===Beginnings===
The National Music Centre and its collections origins can be traced to the installation of a pipe organ (known as the Carthy Organ) in Calgary’s Jack Singer Concert Hall in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rccocalgary.org/instruments/4-manual-organs/jack-singer-concert-hall.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216230627/http://www.rccocalgary.org/instruments/4-manual-organs/jack-singer-concert-hall.html |archivedate=2014-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The installation of this instrument was the genesis of the International Organ Festival and Competition operated by TriumphEnt from 1990 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/calgary-international-organ-festival-emc/|title=Calgary International Organ Festival|first=Barbara|last=Norman|website=Thecanadianencyclopedia.ca|accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also subsequently led to the creation of a new organization known as the Chinook Keyboard Centre, which began developing a collection of keyboard instruments in mid-1996.
Chinook Keyboard Centre was soon renamed Cantos Music Museum and expanded the scope of its collection beyond keyboard instruments to include electronic instruments and sound equipment beginning in the year 2000, it also began to offer limited programming in the way of gallery tours and concerts.

===Customs House===
In 2003, TriumphEnt and Cantos Music Museum joined forces to become the Cantos Music Foundation, located at the historic Customs House building, 134-11th Avenue S.E, and expanded its presentation of music programs using the collection and gallery spaces. In 2005, an exhibition commemorating 100 years of music in Alberta to mark the Centennial led to plans to expand the organization’s scope to chronicle, celebrate, and foster a broader vision for music in Canada. In February 2012, Cantos became the National Music Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmc.ca/about-us/ |title=Visit &amp;#124; Studio Bell |website=Nmc.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the centre began to outgrow its space, plans for construction of a 60,000 square-foot facility in Calgary’s [[Downtown East Village, Calgary|East Village]] with a projected cost of $168 million. With a design by Portland architect [[Brad Cloepfil]], construction began on February 22, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infrastructure.gc.ca/media/news-nouvelles/2013/20130222calgary-eng.html |title=Infrastructure Canada - National Music Centre breaks ground in Calgary |website=Infrastructure.gc.ca |date=2013-02-22 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final steel beam was set into place on December 12, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/building-toward-a-delightful-crescendo-at-the-national-music-centre-in-calgary/article22058233/ |title=Building toward a delightful crescendo at the National Music Centre in Calgary |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building eventually cost $191 million.

The National Music Centre held its last public tour at the Customs House on December 28, 2014. After that the location shut down in order to begin the move to the new centre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25974">The '''neuroanatomy of memory''' encompasses a wide variety of anatomical structures in the [[brain]].

==Subcortical structures==

=== Hippocampus ===
[[File:NIA human brain drawing.jpg|right|300px|The [[hippocampus]]|thumb]]

The [[hippocampus]] is a structure in the brain that has been associated with various [[memory]] functions. It is part of the [[limbic system]], and lies next to the medial temporal lobe. It is made up of two structures, the '''Ammon's Horn''', and the [[Dentate gyrus]], each containing different types of [[Cell (biology)|cells]].&lt;ref name= "Kolb"&gt;{{cite book | last = Kolb |first = B |author2=Whishaw I| year = 2008 | title = Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, 6th ed | location = New York | isbn = 0-7167-9586-8 | publisher = Worth Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cognitive maps ====
There is evidence that the hippocampus contains [[cognitive map]]s in humans. In one study, single-cell recordings were taken from electrodes implanted in a rat's hippocampus, and it was found that certain [[neurons]] responded strongly only when the rat was in certain locations. These cells are called [[place cells]], and collections of these cells can be considered to be mental maps. Individual place cells do not only respond to one unique area only however, the patterns of activation of these cells overlap to form layered mental maps within the hippocampus. A good analogy is the example of the same television or computer screen pixels being used to light up any trillions of possible combinations to produce images, just as the place cells can be used in any multiple possible combinations to represent mental maps. The hippocampus' right side is more oriented towards responding to spatial aspects, whereas the left side is associated with other context information. Also, there is evidence that experience in building extensive mental maps, such as driving a city taxi for a long time (since this requires considerable memorization of routes), can increase the volume of one's hippocampus.&lt;ref name= "Ward"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ward | first = J | year = 2009 | title = The Student's Guide to Cognitive Neuroscience | publisher = Psychology Press | isbn = 1-84872-003-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Encoding ====
Damage to the hippocampus and surrounding area can cause [[anterograde amnesia]], the inability to form new memories.&lt;ref name= "Mahut"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Mahut | first = H |author2=Zola-Morgan S |author3=Moss M | year = 1982 | title = Hippocampal resections impair associative learning and recognition memory in the monkey | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 2 | pages = 1214–1229 | pmid=7119874 | issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This implies that the hippocampus is important not only for storing cognitive maps, but for [[Encoding (memory)|encoding memories]]. 
 
The hippocampus is also involved in [[memory consolidation]], the slow process by which memories are converted from [[short term memory|short]] to [[long term memory]]. This is supported by studies in which lesions are applied to rat hippocampi at different times after learning.&lt;ref name= "Ward"  /&gt;  The process of consolidation may take up to a couple years.
  
It has also been found that it is possible to form new [[semantic memories]] without the hippocampus, but not [[episodic memories]], which means that explicit descriptions of actual events (episodic) cannot be learned, but some meaning and knowledge is gained from experiences (semantic).&lt;ref name= "Ward"  /&gt;

=== Cerebellum ===
[[File:Brain bulbar region.svg|right|200px|The [[cerebellum]]|thumb]]

The [[cerebellum]] ("little brain") is a structure located at the rear of the brain, near the [[spinal cord]]. It looks like a miniature version of the [[cerebral cortex]], in that it has a wavy, or convoluted surface.&lt;ref name= "Mahut"  /&gt;

Unlike the hippocampus which is involved in the encoding of complex memories, the cerebellum plays a role in the learning of [[procedural memory]], and motor learning, such as skills requiring co-ordination and fine motor control.&lt;ref name= "Mishkin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mishkin | first1 = M. | last2 = Appenzeller | first2 = T. | year = 1987 | title = The anatomy of memory | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 256 | issue = 6| pages = 80–89 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0687-80}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of a skill requiring procedural memory would be playing a musical instrument, or driving a car or riding a bike. Individuals with [[transient global amnesia]] that have difficulty forming new memories and/or remembering old events may sometimes retain the ability to perform complex musical pieces, suggesting that procedural memory is completely dissociated from conscious memory, also known as [[explicit memory]].

This separation makes sense if the cerebellum, which is far removed from the hippocampus, is responsible for procedural learning. The cerebellum is more generally involved in motor learning, and damage to it can result in problems with movement, specifically it is considered to co-ordinate timing and accuracy of movements, and to make long-term changes (learning) to improve these skills.&lt;ref name= "Kolb"  /&gt;

=== Amygdala ===
[[File:Amgydala.jpg|right|200px|thumb|The [[amygdala]].]]

Located above the hippocampus in the medial temporal lobes are two amygdalae (singular "amygdala"). The amygdalae are associated with both emotional learning and memory, as it responds strongly to emotional stimuli, especially fear. These neurons assist in encoding emotional memories and enhancing them. This process results in emotional events being more deeply and accurately encoded into memory. Lesions to the amygdalae in monkeys have been shown to impair motivation, as well as the processing of emotions.&lt;ref name= "Robbins"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Robbins | first = TW |author2=Ersche KD |author3=Everitt BJ| year = 2008 | title = Drug Addiction and the memory systems of the brain | journal = New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1141 | pages = 1–21 | doi = 10.1196/annals.1441.020 | pmid = 18991949 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory of fear conditioning ====
[[Pavlovian conditioning]] tests have shown the active role of the amygdala in fear conditioning in rats. Research involving lesions to the basolateral nucleus have shown a strong association with memories involving fear. The central nucleus is linked with the behavioral responses that are dependent on the basolateral's reaction to fear.&lt;ref name= "Rabinak"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rabinak | first = CA |author2=Maren S | year = 2008 | title = Associative Structure of Fear Memory After Basolateral Amygdala Lesions in Rats | journal = Behavioral neuroscience | volume = 122 | issue = 6 | pages = 1284–1294 | doi = 10.1037/a0012903 | pmid = 19045948 | pmc = 2593860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The central nucleus of the amygdala is also linked to emotions and behaviors motivated by food and sex.&lt;ref name= "McGaugh"&gt;{{cite journal | last = McGaugh | first = JL | year = 2004 | title = The Amygdala modulates the consolidation of memories of emotionally arousing experiences | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 27 | pages = 1–28 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.27.070203.144157 | pmid = 15217324 | issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Memory consolidation ====
Emotional experiences and events are somewhat fragile and take a while to be completely set into memory. This slow process, referred to as consolidation, allows emotions to influence the way the memory is stored.&lt;ref name= "McGaugh"  /&gt;

The amygdala is involved in [[memory consolidation]], which is the process of transferring information that is currently in working memory into ones long-term memory. This process is also known as memory modulation.&lt;ref name= "McGaugh"  /&gt;  The amygdala works to encode recent emotional information into memory. Memory research has shown that the greater ones emotional arousal level at the time of the event, the greater the chance that the event will be remembered.&lt;ref name= "McGaugh"  /&gt; This may be due to the amygdala enhancing the emotional aspect of the information during encoding, causing the memory to be processed at a deeper level and therefore, more likely to withstand forgetting.

=== Basal ganglia and motor memory ===
[[File:Basal Ganglia and Related Structures.svg|right|300px|thumb|The [[basal ganglia]]]]

The [[basal ganglia]] are a group of [[nucleus (neuroanatomy)|nuclei]] which are located in the medial temporal lobe, above the [[thalamus]] and connected to the cerebral cortex. Specifically, the basal ganglia includes the [[subthalamic nucleus]], [[substantia nigra]], the [[globus pallidus]], the [[ventral striatum]] and the [[dorsal striatum]], which consists of the [[putamen]] and the [[caudate nucleus]].&lt;ref name= "Packard"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Packard | first1 = M.G. | last2 = Knowlton | first2 = B. | year = 2002 | title = Learning and Memory Functions of the Basal Ganglia | doi = 10.1146/annurev.neuro.25.112701.142937 | journal = Annual Review of Neuroscience | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 563–93 | pmid = 12052921 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic functions of these nuclei deal with cognition, learning, and motor control and activities. The basal ganglia are also associated with learning, memory, and unconscious memory processes, such as motor skills and [[implicit memory]].&lt;ref name= "Mishkin"  /&gt; Particularly, one division within the ventral striatum, the nucleus accumbens core, is involved in the consolidation, retrieval and reconsolidation of drug memory.&lt;ref name="drug memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crespo|first=JA.|author2=Stöckl P |author3=Ueberall F |author4=Marcel J |author5=Saria A |author6=Zernig G |title=Activation of PKCzeta and PKMzeta in the nucleus accumbens core is necessary for the retrieval, consolidation and reconsolidation of the drug memory|journal=PLoS ONE|date=February 2012|url=http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0030502|accessdate=17 March 2012 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0030502 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=e30502 |pmid=22348011 |pmc=3277594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caudate nucleus is thought to assist in learning and memory of associations taught during [[operant conditioning]]. Specifically, research has shown that this part of the basal ganglia plays a role in acquiring stimulus-response habits, as well as in solving sequence tasks.&lt;ref name= "Packard"  /&gt;

Damage to the basal ganglia has been linked to dysfunctional learning of motor and perceptual-motor skills. Most disorders that are associated with damage to these areas of the brain involve some type of motor dysfunction, as well as trouble with mental switching between tasks in [[working memory]]. Such symptoms are often present in those who suffer from [[dystonia]], [[athymhormic syndrome]], [[Fahr's syndrome]], [[Huntington's disease]] or [[Parkinson's disease]]. Huntington's and Parkinson's disease involve both motor deficits and cognitive impairment.&lt;ref name= "Packard"  /&gt;

== Cortical structures ==
[[File:Lobes of the brain NL.svg|The cortical structures|thumb]]

=== Frontal lobe ===
The frontal lobes are located at the front of each [[cerebral hemisphere]] and positioned [[anterior]] to the [[parietal lobes]]. It is separated from the parietal lobe by the [[primary motor cortex]], which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts associated with the [[precentral gyrus]].&lt;ref name= "Kuypers"&gt;Kuypers, H. (1981). Anatomy of the descending pathways. V. Brooks, ed. The Nervous System, Handbook of Physiology, vol. 2. Baltimore: Williams and Wilkins.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cortex here serves our ability to plan the day, organize work, type a letter, pay attention to details and control the movements of your arms and legs. It also contributed to your personality and behaviour. 

When considering the frontal lobes in regards to [[memory]], we see that it is very important in the [[:wikt:coordination|coordination]] of information. Therefore, the frontal lobes are important in [[working memory]]. For example, when you are thinking about how to get to a mall you have never been to before, you combine various bits of knowledge you already have: the layout of the city the mall is in, information from a map, knowledge of traffic patterns in that area and conversations with your friends about the location of the mall. By actively using all of this information, you can determine the best route for you to take. This action involves the controlled use of information in working memory, coordinated by the frontal lobes.

The frontal lobes help a person select out memories that are most relevant on a given occasion. It can coordinate various types of information into a coherent [[memory trace]].&lt;ref name= "Frankland"&gt;Frankland P.W., Bontempi B. (2005). [http://www.franklandlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/Nature-Reviews-Neuroscience-2005.pdf The organization of recent and remote memories]. Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 119–130.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the knowledge of the information itself, as well as knowing where information came from must be put together into a single memory representation; this is called source monitoring.&lt;ref name= "Johnson"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M.K. | last2 = Hashtroudi | first2 = S. | last3 = Lindsay | first3 = S. | year = 1993 | title = Source Monitoring | url = | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 114 | issue = 1| pages = 3–28 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.114.1.3 | pmid=8346328}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes we experience situations where information becomes separated, such as when we recall something, but cannot remember where we remember it from; this is referred to as a [[source monitoring error]].&lt;ref name= "Johnson"  /&gt;

The frontal lobes are also involved in the ability to remember what we need to do in the future; this is called [[prospective memory]].&lt;ref name= "Winograd"&gt;Winograd, E. (1988). Some observations on prospective remembering. In M. M. Gruneberg, P. E. Morris &amp; R. N. Sykes (Eds.), Practical Aspects of Memory: Current Research and Issues. Vol. 2, pp. 348-353.&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporal lobes are a region of the [[cerebral cortex]] that is located beneath the [[Sylvian fissure]] on both the left and right hemispheres of the brain.&lt;ref name= "Squire"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Squire | first1 = L.R. | last2 = Zola-Morgan | first2 = S. | year = 1991 | title = The medial temporal lobe memory system | url = | journal = Science | volume = 253 | issue = 5026| pages = 1380–1386 | doi=10.1126/science.1896849}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lobes in this cortex are more closely associated with memory and in particular [[autobiographical memory]].&lt;ref name= "Conway"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conway | first1 = M. A. | last2 = Pleydell Pearce | first2 = C. W. | year = 2000 | title = The construction of autobiographical memories in the self memory system | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 107 | issue = 2| pages = 261–288 | doi=10.1037/0033-295x.107.2.261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temporal lobes are also concerned with recognition memory. This is the capacity to identify an item as one that was recently encountered.&lt;ref name= "Rugg"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rugg | first1 = M. | last2 = Yonelinas | first2 = A.P. | year = 2003 | title = Human recognition memory: a cognitive neuroscience perspective | url = | journal = Trends Cogn. Sci. | volume = 7 | issue = 7| pages = 313–19 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(03)00131-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recognition memory is widely viewed as consisting of two components, a [[wikt:familiar|familiarity]] component (i.e. Do I know this person waving at me?) and a recollective component (i.e. That is my friend Julia, from evolutionary psychology class).

Damage to the temporal lobe can affect an individual in a litany of ways ranging from: disturbance of auditory sensation and perception, disturbance of selective attention of auditory and visual input, disorders of visual perception, impaired organization and categorization of verbal material, disturbance of language comprehension, and altered personality.&lt;ref name= "OlderKolb"  /&gt;

In regard to memory, temporal lobe damage can impair [[long-term memory]].&lt;ref name= "OlderKolb"&gt;Kolb, B., &amp; Whishaw, I. (1990). Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology. W.H. Freeman and Co., New York.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, general semantic knowledge or more personal episodic memories of one's childhood could be affected.

=== Parietal lobe ===
The parietal lobe is located directly behind the [[central sulcus]], superior to the occipital lobe and posterior to the frontal lobe, visually at the top of the back of the head.&lt;ref name= "Blackmore"&gt;Blakemore &amp; Frith (2005). The Learning Brain. Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;  The make up of the parietal lobe is defined by four anatomical boundaries in the brain, providing a division of all the four lobes.&lt;ref name= "Blackmore"  /&gt;

The parietal lobe has many functions and duties in the brain and its main functioning can be divided down into two main areas: (1) sensation and perception (2) constructing a spatial coordinate system to represent the world around us.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"&gt;Kandel, E., Schwartz, J., &amp; Jessell, T. (1991). Principles of Neural Science. 3rd edition. New York: NY. Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;  The parietal lobe helps us to mediate attention when necessary and provides spatial awareness and navigational skills. Also, it integrates all of our sensory information (touch, sight, pain etc.) to form a single perception.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"  /&gt;  Parietal lobe gives the ability to focus our attention on different stimuli at the same time, PET scans show high activity in the parietal lobe when participates being studied were asked to focus their attention at two separate areas of attention.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"  /&gt;  Parietal lobe also assists with verbal short term memory and damage to the supramarginal gyrus cause short term memory loss.&lt;ref name= "Cowan"&gt;Cowan, Nelson. (2005). Working Memory Capacity. Psychology Press. New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Damage to the parietal lobe results in the syndrome ‘neglect' which is when patients treat part of their body or objects in their visual field as though it never existed. Damage to the left side of the parietal lobe can result in what is called [[Gerstmann syndrome]].&lt;ref name= "Warrington"  /&gt; It includes right-left confusion, difficulty with writing ([[agraphia]]) and difficulty with mathematics ([[acalculia]]). It can also produce disorders of language ([[aphasia]]) and the inability to perceive objects.&lt;ref name= "Warrington"  /&gt; Damage to the right parietal lobe can result in neglecting part of the body or space (contralateral neglect), which can impair many self-care skills such as dressing and washing. Right side damage can also cause difficulty in making things (constructional [[apraxia]]), denial of deficits ([[anosognosia]]) and drawing ability.&lt;ref name= "Warrington"  /&gt;  Neglect syndrome tends to be more prevalent on the right side of the parietal lobe, because the right mediates attention to both the left and right fields.&lt;ref name= "Warrington"&gt;Warrington, E., &amp; Weiskrantz, L.  (1973). An analysis of short-term and long-term memory defects in man. In J.A. Deutsch, ed. The Physiological Basis of Memory. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Damage in the somatic sensory cortex results in loss of perception of bodily sensations, namely sense of touch.

=== Occipital lobe ===
The occipital lobe is the smallest of all four lobes in the human cerebral cortex and located in the rearmost part of the skull and considered to be part of the [[forebrain]].&lt;ref name= "Westmoreland"&gt;Westmoreland, B. et al. (1994). Medical Neurosciences: An Approach to Anatomy, Pathology, and Physiology by Systems and Levels. New York: NY. Little, Brown and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;  The occipital lobe sits directly above the cerebellum and is situated [[Posterior (anatomy)|posterior]] to the [[Parieto-occipital sulcus]], or parieto-occipital sulcus.&lt;ref name= "Westmoreland"  /&gt; This lobe is known as the centre of the [[visual perception]] system, the main function of the occipital lobe is that of vision.

Retinal sensors send signals through the optic tract to the [[Lateral geniculate nucleus]]. Once the Lateral Geniculate Nucleus receives the information it is sent down the [[primary visual cortex]] where it is organized and sent down one of two possible path ways; [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] or [[ventral stream]].&lt;ref name= "Goodale"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Goodale | first1 = MA | last2 = Milner | first2 = AD | year = 1992 | title = Separate visual pathways for perception and action | url = | journal = Trends Neurosci | volume = 15 | issue = 1| pages = 20–5 | doi=10.1016/0166-2236(92)90344-8 | pmid=1374953}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ventral stream is responsible for object representation and recognition and is also commonly known as the "what" stream. The dorsal stream is responsible for guiding our actions and recognizing where objects are in space, commonly known as the "where" or "how" stream. Once in the information is organized and sent through the pathways it continues to the other areas of the brain responsible for visual processing.&lt;ref name= "Goodale"  /&gt;

The most important function of the Occipital lobe is vision. Due to the positioning of this lobe at the back of the head it is not susceptible to much injury but any significant damage to the brain can cause a variety of damage to our visual perception system. Common problems in the occipital lobe are field defects and [[scotoma]]s, movement and colour discrimination, [[hallucinations]], [[illusion]]s, inability to recognize words and inability to recognize movement.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"  /&gt; A study was done in which patients suffered from a tumour on the occipital lobe and the results shows that the most frequent consequence was [[contralateral]] damage to the visual field. When damage occurs in the occipital lobe it is most common to see the effects on the opposite side of the brain. Since the brain regions are so specialized in their functioning damages done to specific areas of the brain can cause specific type of damage. Damage to the left side of the brain can lead to language discrepancies, i.e. difficulty in properly identifying letters, numbers and words, inability to incorporate visual stimuli to comprehend multiple ways an object can be found.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"  /&gt; Right side damage causes non-verbal problems, i.e. identifying geometric shapes, perception of figures and faces.&lt;ref name= "Kandel"  /&gt;  In almost all regions of the brain left side damage leads to general language problems whereas right side damage leads to general perception and problem solving skills.

=== Damage to the cortex ===
Many studies of different disease and disorders that have symptoms of memory loss have provided reinforcing evidence to the study of the anatomy of the brain and which parts are more utilized in memory.

==== Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and memory ====
[[Frontotemporal lobar degeneration]] (FTLD) is a common form of [[dementia]] due to the degeneration of the frontal and temporal lobes. Studies have found significant decreases in the essential needs for proper functioning in these lobes. The [[Autobiographical memory|autobiographical domain in memory]] is largely affected by this disease. In one study, FTLD patients were interviewed and asked to describe a significant event from five different periods of their lives. Using the interview and different methods of imaging, the experimenters hoped to find links between patterns of brain volume loss and performance in the interview.&lt;ref name= "McKinnon"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McKinnon | first1 = M.C. | last2 = Nica | first2 = E.I. | last3 = Sengdy | first3 = P. | last4 = Kovacevic | first4 = N. | last5 = Moscovitch | first5 = M. | last6 = Freedman | first6 = M. | last7 = Miller | first7 = B.L. | last8 = Black | first8 = S.E. | last9 = Levine | first9 = B. | year = 2008 | title = Autobiographical memory and patterns of brain atrophy in frontotemporal lobar degeneration | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 20 | issue = 10| pages = 1839–1853 | doi=10.1162/jocn.2008.20126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through image processing, patterns of significant reduced [[parenchymal]] volumes that encompass the frontal and temporal lobes were found. Through comparison to a control group of patients it was found that parenchymal volumes increased during episodic recall, and decreased during semantic recall. The experimenters discussed that lifespan autobiographical episodic recall was largely damaged in FTLD patients and semantic autobiographical memory seemed to be spared.&lt;ref name= "McKinnon"  /&gt;

==== Parkinson's disease and memory ====
[[Parkinson's disease]] involves both damage to the basal ganglia and certain memory dysfunctions, suggesting that the basal ganglia are involved in specific types of memory. Those who have this disease have problems with both their working memory and spatial memory.&lt;ref name= "Montomery"&gt;Montomery, P. Siverstein, P., et al. (1993). Spatial updating in Parkinson's disease, Brain and Cognition, 23, 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most people can instantly and easily use visual-spatial memory to remember locations and pictures, but a person with Parkinson's disease would find this difficult. He or she would also have trouble encoding this visual and spatial information into long-term memory.&lt;ref name= "Montomery"  /&gt; This suggests that the basal ganglia work in both encoding and recalling spatial information.

People with Parkinson's disease display working memory impairment during sequence tasks and tasks involving events in time. They also have difficulty in knowing how to use their memory, such as when to change strategies or maintain a train of thought.&lt;ref name= "Montomery"  /&gt;

'''''Parasagitta elegans''''' is a small [[Chaetognatha|arrow worm]] in the family [[Sagittidae]], previously named ''Sagitta elegans''

==Morphology==

''Parasagitta elegans'' (prev. ''Sagitta elegans''). Body of adult animal is narrow, firm and opaque (this image: animal very see-through. Visible opaque animal needs better picture).

Fins are separated, rounded, and completely rayed. Anterior fins beginning below the ventral ganglion. Alimentary diverticula present. Eyes with small, round pigment spot. Ovaries long and narrow. Seminal vesicles conical in shape, either exactly next to or very close to the tail fin, separated from posterior fins.

For anatomy, reproduction, classification, and fossil record; see [[Chaetognatha]]

==Taxonomy==

Three subspecies are recognised - ''Sagitta elegans arctica'', ''Sagitta elegans baltica'' and ''Sagitta elegans elegans''.&lt;ref name=ref1&gt;{{cite journal |author= Thuesen, Erik V. 
|title= Parasagitta elegans (Verrill, 1873). Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=105440 on 2014-08-21
|journal=WoRMS|year=2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The subspecies are considered to vary in size depending on the temperature of the waters in which they develop, which could be an indication of them being synonymous species. The numbers of hooks and teeth vary slightly in the three subspecies.&lt;ref name=ref2&gt;{{cite journal |author= A. C. Pierrot-Bults and K. C. Chidgey, edited by Doris M. Kermack and R. S. K. Barnes, 1988 |title= Chaetognatha}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==

===General===

With exception for the [[Benthos|benthic]] species ''Spadella'', arrow worms are all adapted for [[plankton]]ic existence. They swim to the surface at night, and descend during daytime. Most of the time they drift passively, but they can dart forward in swift spurts, using their caudal fin and longitudinal muscles. Horizontal fins bordering the trunk serve largely as stabilizers, and are used in flotation rather than in active swimming.

===Distribution===

''Parasagitta elegans'' and the three subspecies occur in [[Arctic]] and subarctic waters. ''S. elegans elegans'' is a coastal subspecies with oceanic influence. ''S. elegans arctica'' is a boreal-arctic form, and ''S. elegans baltica'' is the smallest form, found only in or near the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref name=ref3&gt;{{cite journal |author= Fraser, J. H. 1952 |title= The Chaetognatha and other zooplankton of the Scottish area and their value as biological indicators of hydrographical conditions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15253">'''[[Philosophy]] of music''' is the study of "...fundamental questions about the nature of [[music]] and our experience of it".&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;Andrew Kania, "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2014/entries/music/ The Philosophy of Music]", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Spring 2014 edition, edited by Edward N. Zalta.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophical study of music has many connections with philosophical questions in [[metaphysics]] and [[aesthetics]]. 
Some basic questions in the philosophy of music are:

* What is the [[definition of music]]? (what are the [[necessary and sufficient conditions]] for classifying something as music?)
* What is the relationship between music and mind?
* What is the relationship between music and language?
* What does musical history reveal to us about the world?
* What is the connection between music and emotions? (in the 19th century there was a debate over whether instrumental music could convey emotion)
* What is meaning in relation to music?

==Philosophical issues==
{{Philosophy sidebar}}

===Definition of music===
{{main article|Definition of music}}
"Explications of the concept of music usually begin with the idea that music is organized sound. They go on to note that this characterization is too broad, since there are many examples of organized sound that are not music, such as human speech, and the sounds non-human animals and machines make."&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; There are many different ways of denoting the fundamental [[Aspect of music|aspects of music]] which are more specific than "sound": popular aspects include [[melody]] ([[pitch (music)|pitches]] that occur consecutively), [[harmony]] (pitches regarded as groups—not necessarily sounding at the same time—to form [[chord (music)|chord]]s), [[rhythm]], [[meter (music)|meter]] and [[timbre]] (also known as a sound's "color"). However, [[noise music]] may consist mainly of noise. [[Musique concrète]] often consists only of sound samples of non-musical nature, sometimes in random juxtaposition. [[Ambient music]] may consist of recordings of wildlife or nature. The arrival of these avant-garde forms of music in the 20th century have been a major challenge to traditional views of music as being based around melodies and rhythms, leading to broader characterizations.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Absolute music vs program music===
{{main article|Absolute music|Program music}}
There was intense debate over absolute music versus program music during the late Romantic Era. Advocates of the "[[absolute music]]" perspective argued that instrumental music does not convey emotions or images to the listener. They claimed that music is not explicitly "about" anything and that it is non-[[Representation (arts)|representational]].&lt;ref name=horowitz&gt;M. C. Horowitz (ed.), ''New Dictionary of the History of Ideas'', {{ISBN|0-684-31377-4}}, vol.1, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of absolute music developed at the end of the 18th century in the writings of authors of early [[German Romanticism]], such as [[Wilhelm Heinrich Wackenroder]], [[Ludwig Tieck]] and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]].&lt;ref name=horowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dahlhaus|first=Carl|title=The Idea of Absolute Music|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adherents of the "[[program music]]" perspective believed that music could convey emotions and images. One example of program music is [[Berlioz]]'s ''[[Symphonie fantastique]]'', in which the fourth movement is the composer's depiction of a story about an artist who poisons himself with opium and then is executed. The majority of opposition to absolute instrumental-based music came from composer [[Richard Wagner]] and the philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Wagner's works were chiefly programmatic and often used vocalization, and he said that "Where music can go no further, there comes the word… the word stands higher than the tone." Nietzsche wrote many commentaries applauding the music of Wagner and was in fact an amateur composer himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |title=Nietzsche and Music |accessdate=17 May 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717140220/http://www.virtusens.de/walther/musik_eng.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Romantic philosophers and proponents of absolute music, such as [[Johann von Goethe]] saw music not only as a subjective human "language" but as an absolute transcendent means of peering into a higher realm of order and beauty. Some expressed a spiritual connection with music. In Part IV of his chief work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' (1819), [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] said that "music is the answer to the mystery of life. The most profound of all the arts, it expresses the deepest thoughts of life." In "The Immediate Stages of the Erotic, or Musical Erotic", a chapter of ''[[Either/Or]]'' (1843), [[Søren Kierkegaard]] examines the profundity of music of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and the sensual nature of ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.

===Meaning and purpose===
In his 1997 book ''How the Mind Works'', [[Steven Pinker]] dubbed music "auditory cheesecake",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pinker|first1=Steven|title=How The Mind Works|date=1997|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York, London|isbn=0393045358|page=524|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5cXKQUh6bVQC&amp;lpg=PA534|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase that in the years since has served as a challenge to the musicologists and psychologists who believe otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2006/09/03/survival_of_the_harmonious/?page=1|publisher=The Boston Globe|title=Survival of the harmonious|accessdate=2008-03-15|last= Bennett |first=Drake|  date=2006-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among those to note this stir was [[Philip Ball]] in his book ''The Music Instinct'' &lt;ref name="The Music Instinct"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=The Music Instinct|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199896429|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Music-Instinct-Works-Without/dp/0199896429}}&lt;/ref&gt;  where he noted that music seems to reach to the very core of what it means to be human:  "There are cultures in the world where to say 'I'm not musical' would be meaningless," Ball writes, "akin to saying 'I'm not alive'." In a filmed debate, Ball suggests that music might get its emotive power through its ability to mimic people and perhaps its ability to entice us lies in music's ability to set up an expectation and then violate it.&lt;ref name="http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery"&gt;{{cite web|last=How The Light Gets In|first=2013|title=Music's Mystery|url=http://iai.tv/video/music-s-mystery|publisher=The Institute of Art and Ideas|accessdate=19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orchestra conservatorio.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[symphony orchestra]] is not only the main large ensemble used in [[classical music]]; one work for orchestra, [[Beethoven]]'s [[Beethoven's Ninth Symphony|Ninth Symphony]] has been called the supreme masterpiece of the [[Western canon]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Cook, Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 (Cambridge Music Handbooks), Cambridge University Press (24 June 1993). {{ISBN|9780521399241}}. "Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is acknowledged as one of the supreme masterpieces of the Western tradition. More than any other musical work it has become an international symbol of unity and affirmation."&lt;/ref&gt;]]

In the pre-modern tradition, the aesthetics of music or musical aesthetics explored the mathematical and cosmological dimensions of rhythmic and harmonic organization. In the eighteenth century, focus shifted to the experience of hearing music, and thus to questions about its beauty and human enjoyment (''[[plaisir]]'' and ''[[jouissance]]'') of music.  The origin of this philosophic shift is sometimes attributed to [[Alexander Gottlieb Baumgarten|Baumgarten]] in the 18th century, followed by [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;!-- This is a remarkably sweeping claim, presented without citation. --&gt; Through their writing, the ancient term ''aesthetics'', meaning sensory perception, received its present-day connotation. In recent decades philosophers have tended to emphasize issues besides beauty and enjoyment. For example, music's capacity to express emotion has been a central issue.

Aesthetics is a sub-discipline of philosophy. In the 20th century, important contributions were made by [[Peter Kivy]], [[Jerrold Levinson]], [[Roger Scruton]], and [[Stephen Davies (philosopher)|Stephen Davies]]. However, many musicians, [[music criticism|music critics]], and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. In the 19th century, a significant debate arose between [[Eduard Hanslick]], a music critic and musicologist, and composer [[Richard Wagner]]. [[Harry Partch]] and some other [[musicologist]]s, such as [[Kyle Gann]], have studied and tried to popularize [[microtonal music]] and the usage of alternate [[musical scale]]s. Also, many modern composers like [[La Monte Young]], [[Rhys Chatham]] and [[Glenn Branca]] paid much attention to a [[musical tuning|system of tuning]] called [[just intonation]].

There has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include [[lyrics|lyricism]], [[harmony]], [[hypnotism]], [[emotion|emotiveness]], [[Temporal Dynamics of Music and Language|temporal dynamics]], [[resonance]], playfulness, and [[timbre (music)|color]] (see also [[musical development]]).

It is often thought &lt;!-- By whom? --&gt;that music has the ability to affect our [[emotions]], [[intellect]], and [[psychology]]; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. The philosopher [[Plato]] suggests in the ''Republic'' that music has a direct effect on the soul. Therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state (Book VII).

[[File:Platform Supply Vessel.JPG|thumb|right|Platform Supply Vessel]]
A '''Platform supply vessel''' (often abbreviated as PSV) is a ship specially designed to supply offshore [[oil platform|oil and gas platform]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Platform Supply Vessels|url=http://www.emas.com/index.php/our-expertise/emas-marine/our-fleet-2/platform-supply-vessels/|publisher=[[EMAS (company)|EMAS]]|accessdate=27 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ships range from 50 to 100 meters in length and accomplish a variety of tasks. The primary function for most of these vessels is logistic support and transportation of goods, tools, equipment and personnel to and from offshore oil platforms and other offshore structures.
In the recent years a new generation of Platform Supply Vessel entered the market, usually equipped with Class 1 or Class 2 [[Dynamic Positioning]] System.

They belong to the broad category of offshore vessels (OSVs) that include platform supply vessels (PSV's), Crane vessels (C/V) and [[Well stimulation|Well stimulation vessels]] (WSVs), [[Anchor handling tug supply vessel]]s (AHTSVs) and Offshore construction vessels (OCVs). Larger offshore vessels have extensive sophisticated equipment including [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]]s and tend to accommodate a larger number of people (more than 100)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About the Norshore Atlantic|url=http://www.ship-technology.com/projects/norshore-atlantic-multi-purpose-drilling-vessel/|accessdate=25 September 2017|publisher=Offshore technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Capabilities==

===Cargo===
[[File:AHTS 408A.jpg|thumb|Deck cargo]]
A primary function of a platform supply vessel is to transport supplies to the oil platform and return other cargoes to shore.  Cargo tanks for [[drilling mud]], pulverized cement, diesel fuel, potable and non-potable water, and chemicals used in the drilling process comprise the bulk of the cargo spaces. Fuel, water, and chemicals are almost always required by oil platforms.  Certain other chemicals must be returned to shore for proper recycling or disposal, however, crude oil product from the rig is usually not a supply vessel cargo.

===Support===
Common and specialty tools are carried on the large decks of these vessels.  Most carry a combination of deck cargoes and bulk cargo in tanks below deck.  Many ships are constructed (or re-fitted) to accomplish a particular job. Some of these vessels are equipped with a firefighting capability and [[fire monitor]]s for fighting platform fires. Some vessels are equipped with oil containment and recovery equipment to assist in the cleanup of a spill at sea.  Other vessels are equipped with tools, chemicals and personnel to "work-over" existing oil wells for the purpose of increasing the wells' production.

==Vessel crews==
[[File:Northern-Genesis.jpg|thumb|The Norwegian PSV ''Northern Genesis'' in [[Bergen]] harbour]]

Crew on these ships can number up to 36 crew members, depending on the size, working area and whether DP equipped or not. Crane vessels and drill ships often have 100 to 200 people on board including a dedicated "Project team".

===Daily operations===
Crews sign on to work and live aboard the ship an extended period of time (4 – 6 weeks). This is followed by similar period of time off, often depending on the ship owner / operator the number of weeks or months aboard, specially this period the Companies due to lack of Offshore projects could ask to remain on board from 1 to 3 months, and after this trip 1 month off. Work details on platform supply vessels, like many ships, are organized into shifts of up to 12 hours.

Living aboard the ship, each crew member and worker will have at least 12 hour shift, lasting some portion of a 24-hour day. Supply vessels are provided with a "bridge" area for navigating and operating the ship, machinery spaces, living quarters, and galley and mess room. Some have built in work areas, and common areas for entertainment. The large main deck area is sometimes utilized for portable housing.

Living quarters consist of cabins, lockers, offices and spaces for storing personal items. Living areas are provided with wash basins, showers and toilets.

The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] or cooking and eating areas aboard ship will be stocked with enough grocery items to last for the intended voyage but with ability also to store provision for months if required. A walk-in size cooler and freezer, a commercial stove and oven, deep sinks, storage and counter space will be available for the persons doing the cooking. The eating area will have coffee makers, toasters, microwave ovens, cafeteria style seating, and other amenities needed to feed a hard working crew.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5353">'''Prebendalism''' refers to [[political systems]] where [[elected officials]], and [[government]] workers feel they have a right to a share of government revenues, and use them to benefit their supporters, co-religionists and members of their [[ethnic group]].

==Origins of the term ==

''[[The Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' defines a [[Prebendary|prebend]] as the "right of member of chapter to his share in the revenues of a cathedral".&lt;ref&gt;''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12371a.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Weber]] used the term to describe India and China in the early Middle Ages in his 1915 book The Religion of China&lt;ref&gt;Max Weber, ''The Religion of China: Confucianism and Taoism'' (Free Press, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; and his 1916 book The Religion of India.&lt;ref name="WeberInd"&gt;Max Weber, ''The Religion of India: The Sociology of Hinduism and Buddhism'' (Free Press, 1958), pp 70–71, as quoted by Immanuel Wallerstein in ''The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century'' (University of California Press, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The occidental [[seigneurie]], like the oriental Indian, developed through the disintegration of the central authority of the patrimonial state power—the disintegration of the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the Occident, the disintegration of the [[Caliphs]] and the [[Maharadja]] or [[Great Moguls]] in India. In the Carolingian Empire, however, the new stratum developed on the basis of a rural subsistence economy. Through oath-bound vassalage, patterned after the war following, the stratum of lords was joined to the king and interposed itself between the freemen and the king. Feudal relations were also to be found in India, but they were not decisive for the formation either of a nobility or landlordism. &lt;br&gt; In India, as in the Orient generally, a characteristic seigniory developed rather out of tax farming and the military and tax prebends of a far more bureaucratic state. The oriental seigniory therefore remained in essence, a "prebend" and did not become a "fief"; not feudalization, but prebendalization of the patrimonial state occurred. The comparable, though undeveloped, occidental parallel is not the medieval fief but the purchase of offices and prebends during the papal [[seicento]] or during the days of the French [[Noblesse de Robe]].&lt;ref name="WeberInd" /&gt; }}

Alavi describes how state-derived rights over capital held by state officials in parts of India in the early 18th Century were held to be of a patron-client nature and thus volatile. They were thus converted where possible into hereditary entitlements.&lt;ref&gt;Seema Alavi, ''The 18th Century in India'' (New Delhi, 2002), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Nigeria==

Richard A. Joseph, director of The Program of African Studies at [[Northwestern University]], is usually credited with first using the term to describe patron-clientelism or [[neopatrimonialism]] in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Richard A., ''Democracy and Prebendal Politics in Nigeria: The Rise and Fall of the Second Republic'', Cambridge University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the term has commonly been used in scholarly literature and textbooks.

Joseph wrote in 1996, "According to the theory of prebendalism, state offices are regarded as prebends that can be appropriated by officeholders, who use them to generate material benefits for themselves and their constituents and kin groups..."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph, Richard, "Nigeria: Inside the Dismal Tunnel," ''Current History'', May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of that kind of patron-client or [[identity politics]], Nigeria has regularly been one of the lowest ranked nations for political transparency by [[Transparency International]] in its [[Corruption Perceptions Index]].&lt;ref&gt;Corruption Perceptions Index 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2006 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110416023729/http://www.transparency.org/policy_research/surveys_indices/cpi/2006 |archivedate=2011-04-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other uses include the corruption investigations into the activities of 31 out of 36 Nigerian governors,&lt;ref&gt;"Nigerian governors in graft probe" at http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/5387814.stm&lt;/ref&gt; the frequent comments in the Nigerian press about the problems of corruption (for example, Victor E. Dike's article in the ''Daily Champion'' of Lagos, "Nigeria: Governance and Nigeria's Ailing Economy"&lt;ref&gt;Dike, Victor E., "Nigeria: Governance and Nigeria's Ailing Economy," ''Daily Champion'' (Lagos), http://allafrica.com/stories/200612130710.html&lt;/ref&gt;) and the common defenses of prebendalism as necessary for justice and equality in government funding (for example Oliver O. Mbamara's editorial, "In Defense of Nigeria: Amidst the Feasting of Critics" at ''Africa Events''.&lt;ref&gt;Mbamara, Oliver O., "In Defense of Nigeria: Amidst the Feasting of Critics," ''Africa Events'', http://www.africanevents.com/Essay-InDefenseOfNigeria0606.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">[[Grave goods]] are utilitarian and ornamental objects buried with the deceased. ''"Pabaon"'', as present day Filipinos know, is the tradition of including the priced possessions or items of the dead to its grave because of the belief that these things might be helpful to the deceased as it travels to the life after death. This has been a practice since the neolithic times.

Grave goods are symbol of social activities, and in a way reflects the urge of the people who buried the dead to show his or her social status. Grave goods provide substantial background on the technology, degree of complexity of the society, level of integration with other communities, social or group identities, individual identities, and concepts of wealth and power of the existing community.

The types and prestige values of the grave goods differ among groups, because of cultural differences. In studying grave goods, it is important to know the period of existence and to substantiate its prestige value.

== Grave goods through time ==

===Early [[Neolithic|Neolithic Age]]===
This period was centered on the population's needs. Thus, utilitarian objects, such as [[adze]]s, were most common among grave goods. Ornamental objects were shell pendants, ear ornaments among others. During this period, death was conceived as the transformation of physical form into something inanimate. Goods buried along with the body were mostly composed of their personal belongings.

===Late Neolithic Age===
Local trade can already be observed in this period. This created a diversity of material possessions of individuals, leading to a diversity of grave goods. Among these were jade and agate, and [[earthenware]] pottery. Other materials were shell and some foreign trade objects.

===[[Chalcolithic]] (Metal Age)===
During this period, inter-island trade was already prominent. Grave goods were jars, metal implements, alkali glass beads, imported porcelain and local imitations, tradeware, coins, metal accessories, gold, and shell. Sex differentiation was also evident during this period wherein it is one of the basic determinants of social stratification. This was a time when social roles started to have variations therefore allowed an individual to be identified in the society based on the goods included in its grave. Iron implements were most of the finds together with male bodies while glass beads were among women.

==Prestige value==
The prestige value of grave goods are dependent on four factors:

===Sources===
The acquisition of the material is a factor on its prestige value. Materials that are harder to acquire, such as when the source is a remote area, the prestige value is higher.

===Raw material===
The abundance or rarity of the source of the raw material relates to its prestige value. The rarer the material is, the higher its prestige value.

===Time and energy in acquisition and manufacture===
Here, grave goods are evaluated on whether they are traded and reworked, traded, or locally produced. Traded items take more time to acquire, especially if these have to be reprocessed once acquired. Therefore, these items have higher values than locally produced items which are abundant and easier to acquire.

===Cultural function===
This categorizes grave goods as either utilitarian or non-utilitarian. Non-utilitarian or ornamental items have higher prestige value because these generally take more time to make, are harder to acquire and are not as abundant as utilitarian good which are seen and used in everyday living.

==Sites==

===Duyong cave, [[Palawan]]===
A male adult was excavated in an open pit with stone and shell adzes. Ornamentations were shell disks with perforations near the ears and chest. Shells were of local material. Other materials were shell containers that are part of the areca nut chewing paraphernalia.
This site was dated back to the early neolithic age, 4630 +/- 250 BP.

===Manunggul cave, Palawan===
This is a jar burial site where jade beads, jade bracelets, stone beads, agate bracelets, shell bracelets, shell beads, and highly decorated jars.
This site was dated back to the late neolithic age, 2660 +/- 80 BP and 2840 +/- 80 BP.

===Tigkiw na saday, [[Sorsogon]]===
This is a primary burial inland site where eight burial jars were recovered, some with impressive design and some undecorated. Materials recovered were glass beads interred with females and metal implements interred with males.
The site is of metal age, 200 BC – AD 200.

===Maitum jar burials, [[South Cotabato]]===
A lot of detailed anthropomorphic pottery in different types were found in this site. Materials found were shell bracelets, shell spoons, and metal implements such as daggers and bolos.
This site is of metal age, dating 70- 370 AD and 5 BC to AD 225.

===Panhutongan, [[Surigao del Nort]]e===
This site consisted of sixteen dug-out wooden coffins in varying designs and woods used. Materials found were different varieties of metal implements such as bolos, metal spearheads and beads.
This site is of early Iron Age, AD 140 +/- 340.

===Balingsagay, Bolinao===
This site is a huge burial site where a total of 51 burials were found. Materials were same with the other sites, with the inclusion of a large amount of trade goods from china, especially porcelain. Local imitations of porcelain were also found.
This site is of late 15th to early 14th century.

===Puling bakaw, [[Calatagan, Batangas|Calatagan]]===
The grave goods found along with the bodies could be interpreted as a form of respect to the family of the dead (Barretto 2002). The family's grief was another probable explanation for high-valued goods.(Macdonald 2001) 

This site best exhibited the extensive trade with other south east Asian countries. From the 207 graves excavated, a large amount of South East Asian wares were found, along with materials existent in the other sites, but understandably with greater detail and variety. Extensive use of gold by all population was also exhibited.
This site precedes the Spanish era.

'''Rotation around a fixed axis''' or '''about a fixed axis of revolution''' or '''motion with respect to a fixed [[wiktionary:axis of rotation|axis of rotation]]''' is a special case of [[rotation]]al motion. The fixed axis hypothesis excludes the possibility of an axis changing its orientation, and cannot describe such phenomena as [[nutation|wobbling]] or [[precession]]. According to [[Euler's rotation theorem]], simultaneous rotation along a number of stationary axes at the same time is impossible. If two rotations are forced at the same time, a new axis of rotation will appear.

This article assumes that the rotation is also stable, such that no torque is required to keep it going. The [[kinematics]] and [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] of rotation around a fixed axis of a rigid body are mathematically much simpler than those for [[Rigid body dynamics#Rigid-body angular momentum|free rotation of a rigid body]]; they are entirely analogous to those of [[linear motion]] along a single fixed direction, which is not true for ''free rotation of a rigid body''.  The expressions for the [[kinetic energy]] of the object, and for the forces on the parts of the object, are also simpler for rotation around a fixed axis, than for general rotational motion. For these reasons, rotation around a fixed axis is typically taught in introductory physics courses after students have mastered [[linear motion]]; the full generality of rotational motion is not usually taught in introductory physics classes.

==Translation and rotation==
{{see also|Rigid body}}
[[File:Worm Gear.gif|thumb|An example of rotation. Each part of the [[worm drive]]—both the worm and the worm gear—is rotating on its own axis.]]

A ''rigid body'' is an object of finite extent in which all the distances between the component particles are constant.  No truly rigid body exists; external forces can deform any solid. For our purposes, then, a rigid body is a solid which requires large forces to deform it appreciably.

A change in the position of a particle in three-dimensional space can be completely specified by three coordinates.  A change in the position of a rigid body is more complicated to describe.  It can be regarded as a combination of two distinct types of motion: translational motion and circular motion.

Purely ''[[Translation (geometry)|translational motion]]'' occurs when every particle of the body has the same instantaneous velocity as every other particle; then the path traced out by any particle is exactly parallel to the path traced out by every other particle in the body.  Under translational motion, the change in the position of a rigid body is specified completely by three coordinates such as ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' giving the [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] of any point, such as the center of mass, fixed to the rigid body.

Purely ''rotational motion'' occurs if every particle in the body moves in a circle about a single line. This line is called the axis of rotation. Then the radius [[Vector (geometry)|vector]]s from the axis to all particles undergo the same angular displacement at the same time. The axis of rotation need not go through the body. In general, any rotation can be specified completely by the three angular displacements with respect to the rectangular-coordinate axes ''x'', ''y'', and ''z''.  Any change in the position of the rigid body is thus completely described by three translational and three rotational coordinates.

Any displacement of a rigid body may be arrived at by first subjecting the body to a displacement followed by a rotation, or conversely, to a rotation followed by a displacement.  We already know that for any collection of particles—whether at rest with respect to one another, as in a rigid body, or in relative motion, like the exploding fragments of a shell, the acceleration of the center of mass is given by
:&lt;math&gt;F_{\mathrm{net}} = M a_{\mathrm{cm}}\;\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''M'' is the total mass of the system and ''a''&lt;sub&gt;cm&lt;/sub&gt; is the acceleration of the center of mass.  There remains the matter of describing the rotation of the body about the center of mass and relating it to the external forces acting on the body. The kinematics and dynamics of ''rotational motion around a single axis'' resemble the kinematics and dynamics of translational motion; rotational motion around a single axis even has a work-energy theorem analogous to that of particle dynamics.

==Kinematics==

===Angular displacement===
{{main|Angular displacement}}A particle moves in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;. Having moved an arc length &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, its angular position is &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; relative to its original position, where &lt;math&gt;\theta=\frac{s}{r}&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics and physics it is usual to use the natural unit [[radian]]s rather than degrees or [[revolutions per minute|revolutions]]. Units are converted as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  1 \text{ revolution } &amp;= 360^\circ = 2\pi \text{ radians, and} \\
  1 \text{ rad} &amp;= \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} \approx 57.27^\circ.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

An angular displacement is a change in angular position:

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta \theta = \theta_{2} - \theta_{1}, \!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement, &lt;math&gt;\theta_1&lt;/math&gt; is the initial angular position and &lt;math&gt;\theta_2&lt;/math&gt; is the final angular position.

===Angular speed and angular velocity===
{{main|Angular velocity}}

Change in angular displacement per unit time is called angular velocity with direction along the axis of rotation. The symbol for angular velocity is &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; and the units are typically rad s&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Angular speed is the magnitude of angular velocity.

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\omega} = \frac{\Delta \theta}{\Delta t} = \frac{\theta_2 - \theta_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous angular velocity is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega(t) = \frac{d\theta}{dt}.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the formula for angular position and letting &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{ds}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;, we have also

:&lt;math&gt;\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt} =  \frac{v}{r},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the translational speed of the particle.

Angular velocity and [[frequency]] are related by

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = {2 \pi f} \!&lt;/math&gt;.

===Angular acceleration===
{{main|Angular acceleration}}
A changing angular velocity indicates the presence of an angular acceleration in rigid body, typically measured in rad s&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. The average angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; over a time interval Δ''t'' is given by 
:&lt;math&gt;\overline{\alpha} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta t} = \frac{\omega_2 - \omega_1}{t_2 - t_1}.&lt;/math&gt;

The instantaneous acceleration ''α''(''t'') is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha(t) = \frac{d\omega}{dt} = \frac{d^2\theta}{dt^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the angular acceleration is the rate of change of the angular velocity, just as acceleration is the rate of change of velocity.

The translational acceleration of a point on the object rotating is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a = r\alpha,\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ''r'' is the radius or distance from the axis of rotation. This is also the [[tangential component]] of acceleration: it is tangential to the direction of motion of the point. If this component is 0, the motion is [[uniform circular motion]], and the velocity changes in direction only.

The radial acceleration (perpendicular to direction of motion) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;a_{\mathrm{R}} = \frac{v^2}{r} = \omega^2r\!&lt;/math&gt;.
It is directed towards the center of the rotational motion, and is often called the ''centripetal acceleration''.

The angular acceleration is caused by the [[torque]], which can have a positive or negative value in accordance with the convention of positive and negative angular frequency. The ratio of torque and angular acceleration (how difficult it is to start, stop, or otherwise change rotation) is given by the [[moment of inertia]]: &lt;math&gt;T = I\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

===Equations of kinematics===
When the angular acceleration is constant, the five quantities angular displacement &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, initial angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;, final angular velocity &lt;math&gt;\omega_f&lt;/math&gt;, angular acceleration &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; can be related by four [[Kinematics#Rotational motion|equations of kinematics]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    \omega_f &amp;= \omega_i + \alpha t \\
      \theta &amp;= \omega_i t + \frac{1}{2} \alpha t^2 \\
  \omega_f^2 &amp;= \omega_i^2 + 2 \alpha\theta \\
      \theta &amp;= \frac{1}{2} \left(\omega_f + \omega_i\right) t
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Dynamics==

===Moment of inertia===
{{main|Moment of inertia}}

The moment of inertia of an object, symbolized by '''I''', is a measure of the object's resistance to changes to its rotation. The moment of inertia is measured in kilogram metre² (kg m²). It depends on the object's mass: increasing the mass of an object increases the moment of inertia. It also depends on the distribution of the mass: distributing the mass further from the center of rotation increases the moment of inertia by a greater degree. For a single particle of mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; a distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is given by

:&lt;math&gt;I = mr^2.&lt;/math&gt;

===Torque===
{{main|Torque}}
Torque &lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}&lt;/math&gt; is the twisting effect of a force '''F''' applied to a rotating object which is at position '''r''' from its axis of rotation. Mathematically,
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{F},&lt;/math&gt;
where × denotes the [[cross product]]. A net torque acting upon an object will produce an angular acceleration of the object according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = I\boldsymbol{\alpha},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''m'''''a''' in linear dynamics.

The work done by a torque acting on an object equals the magnitude of the torque times the angle through which the torque is applied:
:&lt;math&gt;W = \tau\theta. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The power of a torque is equal to the work done by the torque per unit time, hence:
:&lt;math&gt;P = \tau\omega. \!&lt;/math&gt;

===Angular momentum===
{{main|Angular momentum}}
The angular  momentum &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}&lt;/math&gt; is a measure of the difficulty of bringing a rotating object to rest. It is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L} = \sum\mathbf{r} \times \mathbf{p}&lt;/math&gt; for all particles in the object.
Angular momentum is the product of moment of inertia and angular velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{L}=I\boldsymbol{\omega},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''p''' = ''m'''''v''' in linear dynamics.

The equivalent of linear momentum in rotational motion is angular momentum. The greater the angular momentum of the spinning object such as a top, the greater its tendency to continue to spin.

The Angular Momentum of a rotating body is proportional to its mass and to how rapidly it is turning. In addition, the angular momentum depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation: the further away the mass is located from the axis of rotation, the greater the angular momentum. A flat disk such as a record turntable has less angular momentum than a hollow cylinder of the same mass and velocity of rotation.

Like linear momentum, angular momentum is vector quantity, and its conservation implies that the direction of the spin axis tends to remain unchanged. For this reason, the spinning top remains upright whereas a stationary one falls over immediately.

The angular momentum equation can be used to relate the moment of the resultant force on a body about an axis (sometimes called torque), and the rate of rotation about that axis.

Torque and angular momentum are related according to
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau} = \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt},&lt;/math&gt;
just as '''F''' = ''d'''''p'''/''dt'' in linear dynamics. In the absence of an external torque, the angular momentum of a body remains constant. The conservation of angular momentum is notably demonstrated in [[figure skating]]: when pulling the arms closer to the body during a spin, the moment of inertia is decreased, and so the angular velocity is increased.

===Kinetic energy===
{{main|Kinetic energy}}The kinetic energy ''K''&lt;sub&gt;rot&lt;/sub&gt; due to the rotation of the body is given by
:&lt;math&gt;K_\text{rot} = \frac{1}{2}I\omega^2,&lt;/math&gt;
just as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;trans&lt;/sub&gt; = {{frac|1|2}}''mv''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in linear dynamics.

Kinetic energy is the energy of motion. The amount of translational kinetic energy found in two variables: the mass of the object (m) and the speed of the object (v) as shown in the equation above.  Kinetic energy must always be either zero or a positive value. While velocity can have either a positive or negative value, velocity squared will always be positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/work-and-energy/work-and-energy-tutorial/a/what-is-kinetic-energy|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vector expression==
{{See also|Vector (geometry)}}
The above development is a special case of general rotational motion.  In the general case, angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration, and torque are considered to be vectors.

An  angular displacement is considered to be a vector, pointing along the axis, of magnitude equal to that of &lt;math&gt;\Delta \theta&lt;/math&gt;.  A [[right-hand rule]] is used to find which way it points along the axis; if the fingers of the right hand are curled to point in the way that the object has rotated, then the thumb of the right hand points in the direction of the vector.

The [[angular velocity]] vector also points along the [[axis of rotation]] in the same way as the angular displacements it causes.  If a disk spins counterclockwise as seen from above, its angular velocity vector points upwards.  Similarly, the [[angular acceleration]] vector points along the axis of rotation in the same direction that the angular velocity would point if the angular acceleration were maintained for a long time.

The torque vector points along the axis around which the torque tends to cause rotation. To maintain rotation around a fixed axis, the total torque vector has to be along the axis, so that it only changes the magnitude and not the direction of the angular velocity vector. In the case of a hinge, only the component of the torque vector along the axis has an effect on the rotation, other forces and torques are compensated by the structure.

==Examples and applications==

===Constant angular speed===
{{main|Uniform circular motion}}
The simplest case of rotation around a fixed axis is that of constant angular speed. Then the total torque is zero.  For the example of the Earth rotating around its axis, there is very little friction.  For a  [[Fan (mechanical)|fan]], the motor applies a torque to compensate for friction. Similar to the fan, equipment found in the mass production manufacturing industry demonstrate rotation around a fixed axis effectively. For example, a multi-spindle lathe is used to rotate the material on its axis to effectively increase production of cutting, deformation and turning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.davenportmachine.com/multi-spindle-machines/|title=Multi Spindle Machines - An In-Depth Overview|work=Davenport Machine|access-date=2017-08-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The angle of rotation is a linear function of time, which modulo 360° is a periodic function.

An example of this is the [[two-body problem]] with [[circular orbit]]s.

===Centripetal force===
{{main|Centripetal force}}
{{See also|Fictitious force}}
Internal [[tensile stress]] provides the [[centripetal force]] that keeps a spinning object together.  A [[rigid body]] model neglects the accompanying [[Strain (materials science)|strain]].  If the body is not rigid this strain will cause it to change shape. This is expressed as the object changing shape due to the "[[centrifugal force]]".

Celestial bodies rotating about each other often have [[elliptic orbit]]s. The special case of [[circular orbit]]s is an example of a rotation around a fixed axis: this axis is the line through the [[center of mass]] perpendicular to the plane of motion. The centripetal force is provided by [[gravity]], see also [[two-body problem]]. This usually also applies for a spinning celestial body, so it need not be solid to keep together unless the angular speed is too high in relation to its density. (It will, however, tend to become [[Oblate spheroid|oblate]].)  For example, a spinning celestial body of water must take at least 3 hours and 18 minutes to rotate, regardless of size, or the water will separate{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. If the density of the fluid is higher the time can be less. See [[orbital period]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WQCJOkVfsUC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;dq=orbital+period+3+hours+18+minute&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc_bejorTVAhWRCD4KHdBEB0UQ6AEIJjAA|title=Cataclysmic Cosmic Events and How to Observe Them|last=Mobberley|first=Martin|date=2009-03-01|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9780387799469|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Schallanalyse''' (pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈʃal anaˈlyzə|}}), "sound analysis,") was a method of [[poetic]] analysis developed by the renowned [[philologist]] [[Eduard Sievers]], and described in detail in his book ''Ziele und Wege der Schallanalyse'' (1924). Sievers had previously developed a system of [[Sievers' Theory of Anglo-Saxon Meter|"five types"]] to describe the rhythmic patterns found in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Old Saxon language|Old Saxon]] poetry, which had met with widespread acceptance. He then abandoned the five types in favor of his new model. ''Schallanalyse'', however, proved difficult to understand for even the most intelligent people in his field and had very few adherents, usually people who worked with Sievers personally.

{{Essay-like|date=February 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=October 2014}}A '''social experiment''' is a research project conducted with human subjects in the real world. It typically investigates the effects of a policy intervention by randomly assigning individuals, families, businesses, classrooms, or other units to different treatments or to a controlled condition that represents the status quo.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas D. Cook and Donald T. campbell (1979): Quasi-experimentation: Design and Analysis Issues for Field Settings. Houghton Mifflin, {{ISBN|978-0-39-530790-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The qualifier "social" distinguishes a policy experiment from a "clinical" experiment, typically a medical intervention within the subject's body, and also from a laboratory experiment, such as a university psychology faculty might conduct under completely controlled conditions. In a social experiment, randomization to assigned treatment is the only element in the subject's environment that the researchers control. All other elements remain exactly as they were.&lt;ref name="MINCOM1"/&gt;

==Efficacy==
Social experiments are often referred to as "the gold standard" for program evaluation and reform processes. In measuring the impact of a social program, the researcher has to assess what the outcomes of the relevant population would have been in the absence of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Donald T.|authorlink1=Donald T. Campbell|title=Reforms as Experiments|journal=[[American Psychologist]]|date=1969|volume=24|issue=4|pages=409–429|doi=10.1037/h0027982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost every naturally occurring comparison group, however, will differ from the composition of a non-random treatment group, usually because of selection bias (outside of an experiment, people choose to receive the treatment or choose not to). Randomization helps to create a control group that is statistically identical in large sample with the group that is assigned to receive the treatment, and in principle there is no selection bias.&lt;ref name="MINCOM1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Robins |first1=Philip K |last2=Spiegelman |first2=Robert G |last3=Weiner |first3=Samuel  |date=1980 |title=A Guaranteed Annual Income: Evidence from a Social Experiment  |location=New York, New York |publisher=Academic Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1nqLBQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The starting differentiation of the general field of psychology into physiological and social psychology as suggested by Wilhelm Wundt in 1862 lay way for the first social experiments. In 1895, American psychologist Norman Triplett constructed one of the first social experiments with the intention to study the influence of a group on racing performance. During the 1920s, Gordon Allport used experimental methods to study conformity, nonverbal communication, and social facilitation, shaping social psychology as we know it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=T D Cook|last2=Shadish|first2=and W. R.|date=1994|title=Social Experiments: Some Developments over the Past Fifteen Years|url=https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev.ps.45.020194.002553|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=45|issue=1|pages=545–580|doi=10.1146/annurev.ps.45.020194.002553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social experiments that we commonly refer to today were conducted decades later; a famous example is Stanley Milgram's obedience experiment in 1963. Social experiments began in the United States as a test of the [[negative income tax]] concept in the late 1960s and since then have been conducted on all the populated continents. Some "have pilot tested major innovations in social policy", some "have been used to assess incremental changes in existing programs", while some "have provided the basis for evaluating the overall efficacy of major existing programs. Most "have been used to evaluate policies targeted at disadvantaged population groups".&lt;ref name="MINCOM1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html|title=The Digest of Social Experiments, Third Edition|author=David Greenberg and Mark Shroder|accessdate=December 9, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130101109/http://www.urban.org/pubs/digest/introduction.html|archivedate=November 30, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s, cristicism of the ethics and accusations of gender and racial bias led to a reassessment of both the field of social psychology and the conducted experiments. While experimental methods were still employed, other methods gained popularity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Today, we often see the term ''social experiment'' on video sharing platforms like youtube, used for lay people's experiments during which actors attempt to provoke responses from e.g. passersby, usually filmed with a hidden camera.&lt;ref&gt;citation needed&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethics ==
Social experimentation has raised many ethical concerns, due to its manipulation of large groups of the population, often without consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Humphreys|first=Macartan|date=2015-06-01|title=Reflections on the Ethics of Social Experimentation|url=https://doi.org/10.1515/jgd-2014-0016|journal=Journal of Globalization and Development|language=en|volume=6|issue=1|doi=10.1515/jgd-2014-0016|issn=1948-1837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Best-known social experiments==

=== Bystander Apathy (Effect) ===
{{main |Bystander effect}}Based on the real event of when the Kitty Genovese murder outside her home as bystanders watched and nobody came to her aid, the bystander effect occurs when individuals are less likely to assist a victim when other people are present. Social psychologists Bibb Latané and John Darley coined the term bystander apathy after completing a classic experiment in 1964.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Unresponsive Bystander: Why Doesn't He Help?|last=Latane|first=Bibb|last2=John M. Darley|publisher=Prentice Hal|date=June 1, 1970|isbn=0139386130|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For their experiment, Latané and Darley &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; tried to replicate the Genovese slaying by having participants aware of each other but unable to communicate directly. Each participant was in a cubical in contact with each other via a microphone, however only one voice was allowed to speak at a time. A taped recording played of a participant having an epileptic seizure. When the participant believed themselves to be alone they invariably attempted to find help. When the participant believed others were around the speed and frequency of response declined significantly. The authors concluded that situational factors play an influential role on bystander apathy. People are less likely to help in an emergency if other people are present. Two reasons were offered by Latané and Darley: first is ''[[diffusion of responsibility]]''. The second is [[pluralistic ignorance]] or the mentality that if nobody else is helping, then I am not needed as well.

Current research on bystander apathy by psychologist Kyle Thomas et al, found that people’s decisions to help are influenced by their level of knowledge. While diffusion of responsibility and pluralistic ignorance are factors, the researchers found that bystanders’ decisions also consider what they know about other bystanders and the situation before getting involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=Kyle A.|last2=De Freitas|first2=Julian|last3=DeScioli|first3=Peter|last4=Pinker|first4=Steven|date=2016|title=Recursive Mentalizing and Common Knowledge in the Bystander Effect|url=|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology|volume=145 |issue=5|pages=621–629|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===HighScope===
{{main | HighScope}}
The HighScope Perry Preschool Project was evaluated in a randomized controlled trial of 123 children (58 were randomly assigned to a treatment group that received the program and a control group of 65 children that did not). Prior to the program, the preschool and control groups were equivalent in measures of intellectual performance and demographic characteristics. After the program the educational and life outcomes for the children receiving the program were much superior to outcomes for the children not receiving the program. Many of the program effects were significant or approaching significance.&lt;ref&gt;Significant Benefits, The High/Scope Perry Preschool Study Through Age 27&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coalition for Evidence-Based Policy: Social Programs That Work: Perry Preschool Project&lt;/ref&gt;

===RAND Health Insurance Experiment===
{{main | RAND Health Insurance Experiment}}
The RAND Health Insurance Experiment was an experimental study of [[health care]] costs, utilization and outcomes in the United States, which assigned people randomly to different kinds of plans and followed their behavior, from 1974 to 1982. As a result, it provided stronger evidence than studies that examine people afterwards who were not randomly assigned. It concluded that [[cost sharing]] reduced "inappropriate or unnecessary" medical care ([[overutilization]]), but also reduced "appropriate or needed" medical care. It did not have enough statistical power to tell whether people who got less appropriate or needed care were more likely to die as a result.

===Oportunidades/Prospera/Progresa===
{{main | Oportunidades}}
Oportunidades (now rebranded as "Prospera"
) is a government social assistance ([[welfare]]) program in [[Mexico]] founded in 2002, based on a previous program called ''Progresa'', created in 1997.&lt;ref name="NYC"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/opinion/17tues4.html?ex=1318737600&amp;en=b0691545441aa115&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss Paying for Better Parenting], ''New York Times'', Accessed 12/07/06&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to target poverty by providing cash payments to families in exchange for regular school attendance, health clinic visits, and nutrition support.&lt;ref name="Mexico's Oportunidades Program"&gt;[http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/reducingpoverty/case/119/summary/Mexico-Oportunidades%20Summary.pdf Mexico's Oportunidades Program] Accessed 12/07/06&lt;/ref&gt; ''Oportunidades'' is credited with decreasing poverty and improving health and educational attainment in regions where it has been deployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0042-96862006000800004&amp;lng=pt&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en Bulletin of the World Health Organization - Reaching Mexico's poorest] Accessed 12/07/06&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moving to Opportunity===
{{main | Moving to Opportunity}}
Moving to Opportunity for Fair Housing was a randomized social experiment sponsored by the United States [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] in the 1990s among 4600 low-income families with children living in high-poverty [[Public housing in the United States|public housing projects]]. The program was designed based on the assumption that households benefit from living in higher-opportunity neighborhoods. Early evaluations of the MTO program, however, showed minimal gains for participant families. One explanation for these findings is the short length of time which MTO families typically spent in lower-poverty neighborhoods; the positive effects of longer-term exposure to low-poverty neighborhoods appear more promising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blumenberg|first=Evelyn|last2=Pierce|first2=Gregory|date=December 2017|title=Car Access and Long-term Poverty Exposure: Evidence from the Moving to Opportunity (MTO) Experiment.|url=|journal=Journal of Transport Geography|volume=65|pages=92–100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stanford prison experiment===
{{main | Stanford prison experiment}}
The Stanford prison experiment was a study of the [[psychology|psychological]] effects of becoming a [[prisoner]] or [[prison guard]]. The experiment was conducted at [[Stanford University]] on August 14–20, 1971, by a team of researchers led by psychology professor [[Philip Zimbardo]] using college students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonexp.org/psychology/41 The Stanford Prison Experiment – A Simulation Study of the Psychology of Imprisonment Conducted at Stanford University]&lt;/ref&gt; It was funded by the [[Office of Naval Research|U.S. Office of Naval Research]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm FAQ on official site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120909193121/http://www.prisonexp.org/faq.htm |date=2012-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was of interest to both the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] as an investigation into the causes of conflict between military guards and prisoners. The experiment is a classic study on the psychology of imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prisonexp.org/30years.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011105013502/http://www.prisonexp.org/30years.htm |archivedate=2001-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a topic covered in most introductory psychology textbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psypost.org/2014/09/intro-psychology-textbooks-gloss-criticisms-zimbardos-stanford-prison-experiment-27970 Intro to psychology textbooks gloss over criticisms of Zimbardo's Stanford Prison Experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments by Muzafer Sherif===
{{main | Muzafer Sherif}}
Sherif was a founder of modern social psychology, who developed several unique and powerful techniques for understanding social processes, particularly social norms and social conflict. Sherif's experimental study of autokinetic movement demonstrated how mental evaluation norms were created by human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaan Valsiner|title=Comparative study of human cultural development|publisher=Fundacion Infancia y Aprendizaje|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iYgp55xAQwEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherif is equally famous for the [[Robbers Cave Experiment]]s. This series of experiments, begun in Connecticut and concluded in Oklahoma, took boys from intact middle-class families, who were carefully screened to be psychologically normal, delivered them to a summer camp setting (with researchers doubling as counsellors) and created social groups that came into conflict with each other.

'''Big brother'''

Big brother also known as celebrity big brother and big brother VIP is a social experiment. Filmed in a custom built house, the first series was in 1999 in the netherlands. It was made from George orwells 1984 book. Bug brother is popular in the UK,USA and croatia. [[Big Brother (Dutch TV series)|Big brother uk]] us one of the most popular big brothers in the world. Some of the spin off series show [[Teen Big Brother: The Experiment]], [[Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack]] and much more.

=== Hawthorne experiment ===
{{Main|Hawthorne effect}}
The Hawthorne experiment took place in 1924 in the city of Chicago.[[Elton Mayo]] is widely known as the person behind the project. However, his involvement started in 1928 after he was invited by George Pennock, the Assistant Works Manager for the Hawthorne plant of Western Electric. During the experiment, workers were separated into two groups to study the effects of different incentives on their productivity. Different variations were tested, such as changing the light levels in the rooms. Other, more obvious incentives, such as monetary incentives and rest pauses, were also tested and seemed to show positive results.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/people/elton-mayo|title=Elton Mayo: The Hawthorne Experiments Thinker.|website=The British Library|language=en|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several conclusions were made, after the experiments finished: 
* when employees had more freedom to choose their own conditions and output standards, their productivity increased;
* social interaction played an important role in creation of high level of group cohesion;
* people tend to put more effort when they feel their worth and cooperate with each other.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{{sociology}}
The '''sociology of race and ethnic relations''' is the study of [[social]], [[political]], and [[economic]] relations between [[Race (classification of human beings)|races]] and [[ethnicities]] at all levels of [[society]]. This area encompasses the study of systemic [[racism]], like [[residential segregation]] and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups. The sociological analysis of race and ethnicity frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as, but not limited to, [[Social stratification|stratification]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]], as well as with [[postcolonial theory]].

At the level of political policy, ethnic relations is discussed in terms of either [[assimilationism]] or [[multiculturalism]]. [[Anti-racism]] forms another style of policy, particularly popular in the 1960s and 1970s.  At the level of academic inquiry, ethnic relations is discussed either by the experiences of individual racial-ethnic groups or else by overarching theoretical issues.

==Classical Theorists==

===Marx===

[[Marx]] described society as having nine "great" classes, the capitalist class and the working class, with the middle classes falling in behind one or the other as they see fit. He hoped for the working class to rise up against the capitalist class in an attempt to stop the exploitation of the working class. He blamed part of their failure to organize on the capitalist class, as they separated black and white laborers. This separation, specifically between Blacks and Whites in America,  contributed to racism. Marx attributes [[capitalism]]'s contribution to racism through segmented labor markets and a racial inequality of earnings.&lt;ref name="Bohmer"&gt;Bohmer, Peter. 1998. [http://academic.evergreen.edu/b/bohmerp/marxracism.html    Marxist Theory of Racism and Racial Inequality].  Readings in Black Political Economy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weber===
[[Weber]] laid the foundations for a micro-sociology of ethnic relations beginning in 1906.  Weber argued that biological traits could not be the basis for group foundation unless they were conceived as shared characteristics. It was this shared perception and common customs that create and distinguish one ethnicity from another.  This differs from the views of many of his contemporaries who believed that an ethnic group was formed from biological similarities alone apart from social perception of membership in a group.&lt;ref name="Banton"&gt;Banton, Michael. 2008. The Sociology of Ethnic Relations. ''Ethnic and Racial Studies''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===W.E.B. Du Bois===
[[W.E.B. Du Bois]] is well known as one of the most influential black scholars and activists of the 20th century. Du Bois educated himself on his people, and sought academia as a way to enlighten others on the social injustices against his people. Du Bois research "revealed the [[Negro]] group as a symptom, not a cause; as a striving, palpitating group, and not an inert, sick body of crime; as a long historic development and not a transient occurrence".&lt;ref name="DuBois"&gt;Du Bois, W.E.B. 1940. Dusk of dawn; an essay toward an autobiography of a race concept. Schocken Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois believed that Black Americans should embrace higher education and use their new access to schooling to achieve a higher position within society. He referred to this idea as the [[Talented Tenth]]. With gaining popularity, he also preached the belief that for blacks to be free in some places, they must be free everywhere. After traveling to Africa and Russia, he recanted his original philosophy of integration and acknowledged it as a long term vision.&lt;ref name="Hynes"&gt;Hynes, Gerald. ????.

===Booker T. Washington===

[[Booker T. Washington]] was considered one of the most influential black educators of the 19th and 20th centuries. Born in 1856 as a slave in Virginia, Washington came of age as slavery was coming to an end.  Just as slavery ended, however, it was replaced by a system of sharecropping in the South that resulted in black indebtedness.  With growing discrimination in the South following the end of the Reconstruction era, Washington felt that the key to advancing in America rested with getting an education and improving one's economic well-being, not with political advancement.  Consequently, in 1881, he founded the [[Tuskegee Institute]], now Tuskegee University, in order to provide individuals with an education that would help them to find employment in the growing industrial sector. By focusing on education for blacks, rather than political advancement, he gained financial support from whites for his cause.  Secretly, however, he pursued legal challenges against segregation and disfranchisement of blacks.&lt;ref name="Harlen"&gt;Harlen, Louis. 1972.

== Modern Theorists ==

=== Patricia Hill Collins ===
[[Patricia Hill Collins]] is currently a Distinguished University Professor Emerita at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. She received her PhD in sociology in 1984 from [[Brandeis University]]. Collins was the president-elect for the [[American Sociological Association]], where she was the 100th president and the first African-American woman to be president of the organization. Collins is a social theorist whose work and research primarily focuses on race, social class, sexuality, and gender. She has written a number of books and articles on said topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://socy.umd.edu/facultyprofile/Collins/Patricia%20Hill|title=Patricia Hill Collins {{!}} SOCY l Sociology Department l University of Maryland|website=socy.umd.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins work focuses on [[Intersectionality]], by looking at issues through the lens of women of color.

[[Eduardo Bonilla-Silva]] is currently a professor of sociology at [[Duke University]] and is the 2018 president of the American Sociological Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/about-asa/leadership|title=Leadership|date=2009-05-23|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received his PhD in 1993 from [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], which is where he met his mentor, Professor [[Charles Camic]], of which he said "Camic believed in me and told me, just before graduation, that I should stay in the states as I would contribute greatly to American sociology." Bonilla-Silva did not start off his work as a "race scholar," but originally was trained in [[class analysis]], [[political sociology]], and sociology of development ([[globalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.duke.edu/people/eduardo-bonilla-silva|title=Eduardo Bonilla-Silva {{!}} Duke Sociology|website=sociology.duke.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the late 1980s when he joined a student movement calling for racial justice at the University of Wisconsin that he began his work in race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.asanet.org/news-events/footnotes/sep-oct-2017/features/introducing-eduardo-bonilla-silva-2018-asa-president|title=Introducing Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, 2018 ASA President|date=2017-10-29|work=American Sociological Association|access-date=2018-11-05|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book, [[Racism without Racists]], Bonilla-Silva discusses less overt racism, which he refers to as "new racism," which disguises itself "under the cloak of legality" in order to accomplish the same things. He also discusses "color-blind racism," which is essentially when people go off the basis that we have achieved equality and deny past and present discriminations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/973481548|title=Racism without racists : color-blind racism and the persistence of racial inequality in America|last=1962-|first=Bonilla-Silva, Eduardo,|isbn=9781442276222|edition= Fifth|location=Lanham|oclc=973481548}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social psychology==
[[File:Racistcampaignposter1.jpg|thumb|A racist political campaign poster from the 1866 [[Pennsylvania]] [[governor|gubernatorial]] election]]

One of the most important social psychological findings concerning race relations is that members of stereotyped groups internalize those stereotypes and thus suffer a wide range of harmful consequences.  For example, in a phenomenon called [[stereotype threat]], members of racial and ethnic groups that are stereotyped as scoring poorly on tests will perform poorer on those tests if they are reminded of this stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;"What is stereotype threat?" http://www.reducingstereotypethreat.org/definition.html&lt;/ref&gt;  The effect is so strong that even simply asking the test-taker to state her or his race before taking the test (such is by bubbling in "African American" on a multiple choice question) will significantly alter test performance.&lt;ref&gt;Steele &amp; Aronson. 1995. Stereotype threat and the intellectual test performance of African Americans. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.&lt;/ref&gt;  A specifically sociological contribution to this line of research has found that such negative stereotypes can be created on the spot: an experiment by Michael Lovaglia et al.(1998) demonstrated that [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] people can be made to suffer stereotype threat if they are led to believe that they are a disadvantaged group for a particular kind of test.&lt;ref name="Lovaglia"&gt;Lovaglia, Michael, JW Lucas, SR Thye. 1998. Status Processes and Mental Ability Test Scores. American Journal of Sociology.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racism and psychoanalysis==

[[Psychoanalysis]] has much to offer the study of racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wear|first1=Andrew|title=Pauline, politics and psychoanalysis: theorising racism in Australia|url=https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/39156}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its central proposition is that rationality is not the natural state of the individual, and that individuals develop defence mechanisms to cope with anxiety. Humans resist change because change threatens established ways of dealing with anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Frosch|first1=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis and Psychology: Minding the Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual defence mechanisms contribute to [[social defence]] mechanisms. The most regressive defence mechanism (the 'paranoid-schizoid' position) results in a complete dehumanising of the 'all-bad' group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Segal|first1=Hanna|title=Introduction to the Work of Melanie Klein}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 'all-bad' group is admired as well as feared (often evident in the [[conspiracy theory]]). Paradoxically, the arbitrariness of the category 'race' enables the psychotic subject to invest more meaning in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rustin|first1=Michael|title=The Good Society and the Inner World: Psychoanalysis and Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernity's attempt at rationalisation papers over a polycentric psyche (i.e. all of us still have anxieties and desires, despite our apparent rationality). Racism is a response to the abstracting logic of modernity. The rationality of western, 'white' society is defined in opposition to the 'animality' of black, 'primitive' society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kovel, Joel|editor1-last=Elliot|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Frosch|editor2-first=Stephen|title=Psychoanalysis in Contexts: Paths between Theory and Modern Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychoanalytic theorists also argue that passionate anti-racism can produce psychological states analogous to racism.&lt;ref name="minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au"/&gt;

==Audit studies==
{{Main|audit study}}
Another important line of research on race takes the form of [[audit studies]].  The audit study approach creates an artificial pool of people among whom there are no average differences by race. For instance, groups of white and black auditors are matched on every category other than their race, and thoroughly trained to act in identical ways.  Given nearly identical resumes, they are sent to interview for the same jobs.  Simple comparisons of means can yield strong evidence regarding discrimination. The best known audit study in sociology is ''The Mark of a Criminal Record'' by [[Harvard University]] sociologist Devah Pager.  This study compares job prospects of black and white men who were recently released from jail.  Its key finding is that blacks are significantly discriminated against when applying for service jobs.  Moreover, whites ''with'' a criminal record have about the same prospect of getting an interview as blacks ''without'' one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pager|first1=D.|title=The Mark of a Criminal Record|journal=[[American Journal of Sociology]]|date=March 2003|volume=108|issue=5|pages=937–975|doi=10.1086/374403}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another recent audit by [[UCLA]] sociologist S. Michael Gaddis examines the job prospects of black and white college graduates from elite private and high quality state higher education institutions.  This research finds that blacks who graduate from an elite school such as Harvard have about the same prospect of getting an interview as whites who graduate from a state school such as UMass Amherst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gaddis|first1=S. M.|title=Discrimination in the Credential Society: An Audit Study of Race and College Selectivity in the Labor Market|journal=[[Social Forces]]|date=June 2015|volume=93|issue=4|pages=1451–1479|doi=10.1093/sf/sou111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discipline development by country==

===United States===
In the [[United States]], the study of racial and ethnic relations has been widely influenced by the factors associated with each major wave of [[immigration]] as the incoming group struggles with keeping its own cultural and ethnic identity while also assimilating into the broader mainstream [[American culture]] and [[Economy of the United States|economy]].  One of the first and most prevalent topics within American study is that of the relations between white Americans and [[African Americans]] due to the heavy [[collective memory]] and culture borne out of and lingering from centuries of forced [[slavery]] in [[plantations in the American South|plantations]].   Throughout the rest of American history, each new wave of [[immigration to the United States]] has brought another set of issues as the tension between maintaining [[cultural diversity|diversity]] and [[cultural assimilation|assimilating]] takes on new shapes.  [[Racism]] and conflict often rears up during these times.&lt;ref name="Park"&gt;Park, Robert Ezra. 1950. [https://books.google.com/books?id=8jcVlv2HTj8C&amp;pg=PR5 The Early Sociology of Race and Ethnicity]. The Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, some key currents can be gleaned from this body of knowledge: in the context of the United States, there is a tendency for minorities to be punished in times of economic, political and/or geopolitical crises. Times of social and systemic stability, however, tend to mute whatever underlying tensions exist between different groups. In times of societal crisis—whether perceived or real—patterns or retractability of American identities have erupted to the fore of America's political landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fong|first1=Jack|title=American Social ‘Reminders’ of Citizenship after September 11, 2001: Nativisms in the Ethnocratic Retractability of American Identity|journal=Qualitative Sociology Review|volume=4|issue=1|pages=69–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Notable and infamous examples can be seen in [[Executive Order 9066]] that [[Internment of Japanese Americans|placed Japanese Americans in incarceration centers]] as well as the 19th century [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] that banned Chinese laborers from emigrating to the United States (local workers viewed Chinese laborers as a threat). Current examples include post-[[9/11]] backlash against Muslim Americans, although these have taken place in civil society, not through public policy.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], foreign nationals were actively encouraged and sponsored to migrate in the 1950s after the dissolution of [[British Empire|the Empire]] and the social devastation of the [[Second World War]]. The [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1962|1962 Commonwealth Immigrants Act]] changed the law so that only certain [[British Commonwealth]] members were able to migrate. This law was tightened again with the [[Commonwealth Immigrants Act 1968]] and [[Immigration Act 1971]]. The [[Race Relations Act 1968]] extended certain anti-discrimination policies with respect to employment, housing, commercial and other services. This was extended again with the [[Race Relations Act 1976]].

As with the UK establishments of [[media studies|media]] and [[cultural studies]], 'ethnic relations' is often taught as a loosely distinct discipline either within sociology departments or other schools of humanities.

Major British theorists include [[Paul Gilroy]], [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], Richard Jenkins, [[John Rex]], [[Michael Banton]] and [[Tariq Modood]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5225">The '''spin stiffness''' or '''spin rigidity''' or '''helicity modulus''' or the "'''superfluid density'''" (for bosons the superfluid density is proportional to the spin stiffness) is a constant which represents the change in the ground state energy of a spin system as a result of introducing a slow in plane twist of the spins. The importance of this constant is in its use as an indicator of [[quantum phase transitions]]—specifically in models with metal-insulator transitions such as [[Mott insulators]]. It is also related to other [[topological invariant]]s such as the [[Berry phase]] and [[Chern number]]s as in the [[Quantum hall effect]].

==Mathematically==
Mathematically it can be defined by the following equation: 
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_s = \cfrac{\partial^2}{\partial \theta^2}\cfrac{E_0(\theta)}{N}|_{\theta = 0} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_0&lt;/math&gt; is the ground state energy, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the twisting angle, and N is the number of lattice sites.

==Spin stiffness of the Heisenberg model==
{{See also|Heisenberg model (quantum)|l1=Heisenberg model}}

Start off with the simple Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;H_\mathrm{Heisenberg} = -J \sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;} \left[S_i^z S_j^z + \cfrac{1}{2}(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+)\right]&lt;/math&gt;

Now we introduce a rotation in the system at site i by an angle θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; around the z-axis:

:&lt;math&gt;S_i^+ \longrightarrow S_i^+e^{i \theta_i}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S_i^- \longrightarrow S_i^-e^{-i \theta_i}&lt;/math&gt;

Plugging these back into the Heisenberg Hamiltonian:

:&lt;math&gt;H(\theta_{ij}) = -J \sum_{&lt;i,j&gt;} \left[S_i^z S_j^z + \cfrac{1}{2}(S_i^+e^{i\theta_i} S_j^-e^{-i\theta_j} + S_i^-e^{-i\theta_i} S_j^+e^{i\theta_j})\right]&lt;/math&gt;

now let θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = θ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - θ&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; and expand around θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 via a [[Taylor series|MacLaurin expansion]] only keeping terms up to second order in θ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;H \approx H_\mathrm{Heisenberg} - J \sum_{&lt;ij&gt;} \left[\theta_{ij}J_{ij}^{(s)} - \cfrac{1}{2}\theta_{ij}^2 T_{ij}^{(s)}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the first term is independent of θ and the second term is a [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation]] for small θ.

:&lt;math&gt;J_{ij}^{s} = \cfrac{i}{2}(S_i^+ S_j^- - S_i^- S_j^+)       &lt;/math&gt; is the z-component of the spin current operator
:&lt;math&gt;T_{ij} = \cfrac{1}{2}(S_i^+ S_j^- + S_i^- S_j^+)           &lt;/math&gt;  is the "spin kinetic energy"

Consider now the case of identical twists, θ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; only that exist along nearest neighbor bonds along the x-axis
Then since the spin stiffness is related to the difference in the ground state energy by

:&lt;math&gt;E(\theta) - E(0) = N\rho_s\theta_x^2&lt;/math&gt;

then for small θ&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and with the help of [[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|second order perturbation theory]] we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho_s = \cfrac{1}{N} \left[ \cfrac{1}{2}\langle T_x \rangle + \sum_{\nu \neq 0} \cfrac{ | \langle 0| j_x^{(s)}|\nu\rangle |^2 }{E_{\nu} - E_0}\right]&lt;/math&gt;

The crenelated appearance of the trenches is due to the presence of traverses.]]
A '''traverse''' in [[trench warfare]] is an adaptation to reduce casualties to defenders occupying a trench. One form of traverse is a U-shaped detour in the trench with the trench going around a protrusion formed of earth and [[sandbag]]s. The [[Fragmentation (weaponry)#Difference between fragmentation and shrapnel|fragments or shrapnel]], or shockwave from a shell landing and exploding within a trench then cannot spread past the obstacle the traverse interposes. Also, an enemy that has entered a trench is unable to fire down the length at the defenders, or otherwise [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilade]] the trench.

A traverse trench is a trench dug perpendicular to a trench line, but extending away from the enemy. It has two functions. One function is to provide an entry into the main trench. A second function is to provide a place for defenders to shelter and regroup should the enemy have penetrated into the main trench and be able to fire down the main trench's length.

On an approach trench, that is, a trench leading from the rear to the frontline or firing trench, defenders may construct an island traverse. With an island traverse, the approach trench splits to go around both sides of a traverse before coming together again. 

Lastly, a flying or bridge traverse is a sandbagged covering for a stretch of trench to block shrapnel or shell fragments from entering the trench.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6708">In [[biology]], a '''tunica''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|uː|n|ᵻ|k|ə}}) (plural '''tunicae''') is a layer, coat, sheath, or similar covering. The word came to English from the [[New Latin]] of science and medicine. Its literal [[word sense|sense]] is about the same as that of the word ''[[tunic]]'', with which it is [[cognate]]. In biology one of its senses used to be the [[taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] name of a [[genus]] of plants, but the nomenclature has been revised and those plants are now included in the genus ''[[Petrorhagia]]''. 

In modern biology in general, ''tunica'' occurs as a technical or anatomical term mainly in [[botany]] and [[zoology]]. It usually refers to membranous structures that line or cover particular organs. In many such contexts ''tunica'' is used interchangeably with ''tunic'' according to preference. An [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] or [[organism]] that has a tunic(a) may be said to be ''tunicate'', as in a ''tunicate bulb''. This adjective ''tunicate'' is not to be confused with the noun ''[[tunicate]]'', which refers to a member of the sub[[phylum]] ''[[Tunicate|Tunicata]]''.

==Botanical and related usages==
In botany there are several contexts for the term.
*As a general, but not comprehensive, descriptive term in botanical anatomy [[John Lindley]] in the 19th century defined tunica as "any loose membranous skin not formed from epidermis".&lt;ref&gt;Lindley, John. The Treasury of Botany. Pub. William Wood 1872. May be downloaded from: [https://archive.org/details/treasurybotanya01moorgoog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"&gt;Jackson, Benjamin, Daydon; A Glossary of Botanic Terms with their Derivation and Accent; Published by Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. London, 4th ed 1928&lt;/ref&gt;
*The apical [[meristem]], in particular in [[Angiosperm]]s, has an outer layer of cells called the tunica; its role in growth and development differs from that of the inner meristem, or ''corpus''.&lt;ref&gt;Mishra, S.R. Understanding Plant Anatomy. Publisher: Discovery  2009. {{ISBN|978-8183564571}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bulbs]] and [[corm]]s often have protective outer coverings of dead material. Particularly in fields such as horticulture and taxonomic description, such bulbs and corms are said to be "[[Wiktionary:tunicate|tunicate]]" &amp;mdash; having tunics. Usually such a tunic is derived from the bases of sacrificial dead leaves, often [[cataphyll]]s specialised for the purpose and dying in place. Such tunics may be delicate, brittle membranes such as those around the bulbs of onions, but the many variations reflect a wide range of adaptations in various species. Many of the larger Amaryllidaceae in particular, for example ''[[Boophone]]'' species, accumulate thick layers of rot-resistant leaf-base material around their bulbs. Again, corms of [[Iridaceae|Iridaceous]] species, such as some [[Watsonia (plant)|Watsonias]] and the larger species of [[Gladiolus]], accumulate thick, reticulated, fibrous or woody defences.
*More generally than in describing tunics of bulbs etc., any leaf-sheath or protective bract remaining attached to the plant after the leaf has died may be called a tunica or tunic.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;
*The [[Seed|testa]] or [[Wiktionary:spermoderm|spermoderm]] of a seed is sometimes called the tunic, especially in older books.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;
*In fungi the [[peridium]] may be referred to as the tunica.&lt;ref name= "BotGloss"/&gt;

==Zoological usages==
As an anatomical or [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] reference in zoology, ''tunica'' has a range of applications to membranous structures in anatomy, including human anatomy. Such structures are generally coverings or capsules of organs, but also may be linings of cavities. In some cases, such as the walls of macroscopic blood vessels, layers of the tissue of the walls, whether inner, intermediate, or outer, are called ''tunica'' of one kind or another. Examples follow, but neither the list nor the discussions are exhaustive.   
*In arteries and veins the inner wall is the ''[[tunica intima]]'', the outer wall is the ''[[tunica adventitia]]'', and they are separated by the ''[[tunica media]]''. More generally, the ''tunica adventitia'' or simply the "adventitia" is the outermost connective tissue covering round any internal organ.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"&gt;Junqueira, L. Carlos; Carneiro, Jose; Kelly, Robert O. Basic Histology, Publisher: Prentice Hall 1995 {{ISBN|0-8385-0590-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Tunica albuginea (disambiguation)|Tunica albuginea]]'' is a general term for a tunic of whitish connective tissue. In human anatomy it generally is applied in three contexts: the fibrous sheath of the ''[[Tunica albuginea (penis)|corpora cavernosa penis]]'', the [[Tunica albuginea of testis|fibrous tunic of the testis]], and the [[Tunica albuginea (ovaries)|connective tissue tunic]] around the ovaries.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''[[Dartos|Tunica dartos]]'' is a muscular tunic beneath the skin of the scrotum. It is one of the mechanisms for retraction of the testes, largely for temperature control.&lt;ref name= "PSHH"&gt;Amenta, Peter S. Histology: From Normal Microanatomy to Pathology. Publisher: Piccin Nuova Libraria 1997 {{ISBN|978-8829911950}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|Tunica fibrosa oculi]]'', is the [[Fibrous tunic of eyeball|fibrous tunic of the eyeball]], the outer layer that includes both the cornea and sclera.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica mucosa]]'' is the predominant Latin rendering of "[[mucous membrane]]" in English-speaking countries, though ''membrana mucosa'' also is acceptable and in some European languages is preferred. The name may be qualified in referring to particular regions of the body, such as ''[[oral mucosa|tunica mucosa oris]]'' for the [[oral mucosa]], and ''[[Endometrium|tunica mucosa uteri]]'' for the [[endometrium]].&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica muscularis]]'' refers to muscular layers in the walls of hollow organs such as the gut, where they are required for peristalsis, and sometimes for [[sphincter]]s.&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*''[[Tunica serosa]]'' is the [[serous membrane]]&lt;ref name= "PSHH"/&gt;
*'' [[Tunica vaginalis]]'' is the serous covering of the testis within the scrotum.&lt;ref name= "Histol1"/&gt;
*''Tunica vasculosa'' could refer to any tunic rich in blood vessels. In human anatomy it generally refers either to ''[[Tunica vasculosa lentis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Barishak, Y. Robert. Embryology of the Eye and Its Adnexae. Publisher: S Karger 2001 {{ISBN|978-3805571791}}&lt;/ref&gt; or to ''[[Tunica vasculosa testis]]''&lt;ref&gt;Shu-Xin Zhang. An Atlas of Histology.

In [[Johan Galtung|Johan Galtung's]] 1969 paper, "Violence, Peace and Peace Research,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galtung|first=Johan|date=1969|title=Violence, Peace and Peace Research|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=6|pages=167–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; he presents his theory of the Conflict Triangle, a framework used in the [[Peace and conflict studies|study of peace and conflict]], with the purpose of defining the three key elements of violence that form this "triangle." The theory is based on the principle that peace must be defined by widely accepted social goals, and that any state of peace is characterized by the absence of violence. When a conflict has features of all three areas of violence, the result is a more consolidated, static state of violence in a social system, which may include a conflict or a nation-state, whereas the absence of these three typologies of violence results in peace.

== Structural Violence ==
[[Structural violence|Structural Violence]], also referred to as social injustice, is defined as injustice and inequality built into the structure of society, resulting in unequal power and, subsequently, imbalanced life chances. There is no requirement for a clear actor to be defined as committing the violence, rather it is embedded within the institutions of the society, where the power to decide the distribution of resources is uneven. Rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an avoidable impairment of [[fundamental human needs]]. Structural violence is increased in situations where low income individuals also suffer in the rank dimensions of education, health, and power. This is due to an overall consolidation of factors in the social structure, resulting in a high correlation between social class and disempowerment. Structural violence can be recognized through its relative stability, having been built into the social structure. This can make structural violence difficult to ascertain, despite its often vast consequences. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of the most notable are listed below.

[[Akhil Gupta]] argued in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Red Tape: Bureaucracy, Structural Violence and Poverty in India|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that structural violence has been the key influence in the nature and distribution of extreme suffering in India, driven by the Indian state in its alleged corruption, overly bureaucratic standards of governance used to exclude the middle and working classes from the political system through a system of politicized poverty.

Jacklyn Cock’s 1989 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cock|first=Jacklyn|date=1989|title=Keeping the Fires Burning: Militarization and the Politics of Gender in South Africa|url=|journal=Review of African Political Economy|volume=|pages=50–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Review of African Political Economy]] applied Galtung’s theory of structural violence, analysing the role of militarized society under the [[Apartheid|apartheid regime of South Africa]] in the development of patriarchal values that is a form of structural violence against women. Cock found that tacit misdirection of women in society by its leadership focused their energies toward the direct and indirect incorporation of the patriarchal regime in order to maintain the status quo.

Mats Utas claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Utas|first=Mats|date=2003|title=Sweet Battlefields: Youth and the Liberian Civil War|url=|journal=Uppsla University Dissertations in Cultural Anthropology|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that even those youth in Liberia indirectly unaffected by direct violence in the [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war of 1989-1996]] suffered from structural violence in the form of association with different blocs, leading to poverty, joblessness and marginalisation effects.

== Cultural Violence ==
Cultural violence is defined as any aspect of a culture that can be used to legitimise violence in its direct or structural form. Unlike direct and structural violence, then, cultural violence is a foundational principle for extended conflict. The existence of prevailing or prominent social norms make direct and structural violence seem natural or at least acceptable, and serves to explain how prominent beliefs can become so embedded in a given culture that they function as absolute and inevitable and are reproduced uncritically across generations. Galtung expanded on the concept of cultural violence in a 1990 paper&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galtung|first=Johan|date=1990|title=Cultural Violence|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=27|pages=291–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; also published in the Journal of Peace Research. This concept has been applied in a limited number of cases, with most occurring after Galtung’s follow up paper in 1990,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; some of the most notable of which are listed below.

In [[Ed Husain]]'s 2007 book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Islamist|last=Husain|first=Ed|publisher=Penguin|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Islamist]], seminal extremist literature such as [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s [[Milestones (book)|Milestones]] is highlighted  as being particularly influential on many young Muslims in terms of defining their identity and life goals, in which the book embodies the principles outlined whereby there is a cultural imperative for violence built into the societal values or cultural values of Islam through such [[Extremism|extremist]] literature.

Gregory Phillips argues in his 2003 book, Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country|last=Philips|first=Gregory|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resistance to the Western medical sphere driven by [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|previous atrocities]] committed against the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal community]] has led to a fierce resistance effort against modern medicine, addiction treatment and perhaps fuels a desire to seek out drugs and illicit substances as a starting point of addiction. Wide scale suspicion against medical practitioners and government representatives has become engendered in the Aboriginal community.

In Enduring Violence: Ladina Women's Lives in Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enduring Violence|last=Menjívar|first=Cecilia|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011 book by [[Cecilia Menjívar]], it is argued that the preexisting cultural conditions of ''mediania'', or half and half, agriculture led to women facing large scale cultural violence due to high rents, low returns and high required investment with additionally harsh conditions due to the conflict in Guatemala. Given the patriarchal culture of Guatemala, any earnings would go to the partner of the working woman, leaving a large poverty gap enshrined in the demographic diversity of the country.

== Direct Violence ==
Direct Violence is characterised as having an actor that commits the violence, and is thus able to be traced back to persons as actors. Direct violence shows less stability, given it is subject to the preference sets of individuals, and thus is more easily recognised. Direct violence is the most visible, occurring [[Physical abuse|physically]] or [[Verbal abuse|verbally]], and the victim and the offender can be clearly identified. Direct violence is highly interdependent with structural and cultural violence: cultural and structural violence causes direct violence which on the other hand reinforces the former ones. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of which are listed below.

A 2011 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solutions-to-End-Child-Marriage.pdf|title=Solutions to End Child Marriage|last=Malhotra|first=Anju|date=|website=ICRW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[International Center for Research on Women]] (ICRW) demonstrated the widespread nature of [[child marriage]] in [[South Asia]]. The ICRW highlighted marriage before the age of 18 as a fundamental human rights violation, one that leads to early childbearing, with significantly higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates as well as higher infant mortality rates amongst women. The paper most directly presented evidence to show that child brides are at heightened risk of violence in the home.

In Matthew Chandler's 2009 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Matthew|date=2009|title=When armed combatants employ nonviolent action: A case study of Hezbollah|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304844175/abstract/F1B927DF887E448CPQ/1?accountid=12768|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on so-called "non-violent" techniques utilised by [[Hezbollah]] still include forms of Direct Violence, most notably the threat of violence toward [[Fouad Siniora]]'s allies after his 2008 order to dismantle the Hezbollah telecommunications network in 2008, which led to the freezing of the order. Further, Hezbollah are argued to have used their operation of [[Hezbollah social services|social services]], in lieu of government operations, as a ransom for support as well as rewarding their fighters with guaranteed healthcare and support for their families. Chandler argues this is due to opposition within the group to harming Lebanese civilians, who they view as "their own", or exacerbating conflict through civil war.

In 2005, Steven Wright made the case&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Steven|date=2005|title=Violent Peacekeeping: The Rise and Rise of Repressive Techniques and Technologies|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1743453X0500100106|journal=Politics and Ethics Review|volume=1|pages=60–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Peacekeeping efforts to be regarded as violence due to increasing use of techniques such as pre-interrogation treatment, and the use of non-lethal weapons such as tear gas for crowd dispersal and plastic bullets, which he terms "torture-lite", being increasingly common in peacekeeping manuals across a number of nation-states and supranational organisations.

== Reinforcing Factors ==
Galtung focuses a section of the paper on the means of direct and structural violence, in particular, developing groups of factors that may be included as types of such forms and methods of maintaining and reinforcing the mechanisms of such violence. In terms of reinforcing factors, Galtung identifies six key areas:

;Linear Ranking Order
:Systems in which there is an open and complete ranking of actors leaves no doubt as to the actor who is ranked more highly, and is thus a mechanism of structural violence due to the reinforcement of an existing power dynamic.
;Acyclical Interaction Pattern
:Systems in which all actors are connected via a one-way ‘correct’ path of interaction, where outcomes are structurally dependent on using this system in the intended way of its design. This makes structural systems stable, as change can only be achieved through this consolidated [[Selectorate theory|power-seeking and power-retaining system]].
;Rank-Centrality Correlation
:Within the social system, actors that are higher ranked are more central within the system itself, reinforcing their importance to the status quo as well as their incentives to maintain it.
;(4)  System Congruence
:Social systems are made up of similar components, allowing those who are ranked highly and are successful at mobilising one system shifting from a comparative advantage within one system to an absolute advantage over all systems of desired operation.
;Rank Concordance
:Actors that are ranked highly within one metric, such as income, are also ranked highly on other metrics such as education and health. This congruence is also present in actors ranked low within these metrics, and serves to limit [[Social mobility|mobility within the social system]].
;Interlevel High Rank Coupling
:Collaboration amongst the highest ranks results in the system being defined in such a way that benefits the most powerful actors, usually through a sub optimally ranked representative (not the highest ranked actor), which limits allegations of system consolidation by the most powerful.

Beyond Galtung’s initial paper and thesis, scholars have applied the Conflict Triangle to a broad array of conflicts, struggles and occupations since 1969, and retroactively.

== Criticism ==
[[Johan Galtung]]'s Conflict Triangle and Peace Research paper are widely cited as the foundational pieces of theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peace processes: a Sociological Approach|last=Brewer|first=John D.|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within peace and conflict studies. However, they are not without criticism. Galtung uses very broad definitions of [[violence]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]], and applies the terms of mean both direct and indirect, negative and positive, and violence in which one cannot distinguish actors or victims, which serves to limit the direct application of the model itself.

Galtung uses a [[Positivism|positivist]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Question of Values: Johan Galtung's Peace Research|last=Lawler|first=Peter|publisher=Lynne Rienner|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that he assumes that every rational tenet of the theory can be verified, serving to reject social processes beyond relationships and actions. This approach enforces a paradigm of clear-cut, currently testable propositions as the ‘whole’ of the system, and thus is often deemed [[Reductionism|reductionist]]. Galtung also wields an explicit [[normative]] orientation in the paper, in which there is a weighting toward evaluative statements that may show bias or simply opinion, or indeed a trend toward the [[institution]]s and concepts of peace in the West, which may serve to limit the applicability of the model more widely.

A '''vortex generator''' ('''VG''') is an [[aerodynamic]] device, consisting of a small [[wikt:vane|vane]] usually attached to a lifting surface (or [[airfoil]], such as an [[aircraft|aircraft wing]])&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; or a rotor blade of a [[wind turbine]].&lt;ref name="WindTurbineVortexGenerators"&gt;[http://www.upwindsolutions.com/upgrades/wind-turbine-vortex-generator/ Wind Turbine Vortex Generators], UpWind Solutions.&lt;/ref&gt; VGs may also be attached to some part of an aerodynamic vehicle such as an aircraft fuselage or a car.  When the airfoil or the body is in motion relative to the air, the VG creates a [[vortex]],&lt;ref name="Peppler"&gt;Peppler, I.L.: ''From The Ground Up'', page 23. Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, Ottawa Ontario, Twenty Seventh Revised Edition, 1996. {{ISBN|0-9690054-9-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/pages/v_howvgswrk.html|title = How Micro VGs Work|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which, by removing some part of the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the airfoil surface, delays local [[flow separation]] and [[Stall (fluid dynamics)|aerodynamic stalling]], thereby improving the effectiveness of wings and [[Wing configuration#Tailplanes and foreplanes|control surfaces]], such as [[Flap (aeronautics)|flaps]], [[Elevator (aeronautics)|elevators]], [[aileron]]s, and [[rudder]]s.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

==Method of operation==
Vortex generators are most often used to delay [[flow separation]].  To accomplish this they are often placed on the external surfaces of vehicles&lt;ref name="Clancy"&gt;Clancy, L.J. ''Aerodynamics'', Section 5.31&lt;/ref&gt; and wind turbine blades. On both aircraft and wind turbine blades they are usually installed quite close to the leading edge of the [[airfoil|aerofoil]] in order to maintain steady airflow over the control surfaces at the trailing edge.&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt; VGs are typically rectangular or triangular, about as tall as the local [[boundary layer]], and run in spanwise lines usually near the thickest part of the wing.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; They can be seen on the wings and vertical tails of many [[airliner]]s.

Vortex generators are positioned obliquely so that they have an [[angle of attack]] with respect to the local airflow&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt; in order to create a tip vortex which draws energetic, rapidly moving outside air into the slow-moving boundary layer in contact with the surface. A turbulent boundary layer is less likely to separate than a laminar one, and is therefore desirable to ensure effectiveness of trailing-edge control surfaces. Vortex generators are used to trigger this transition. Other devices such as [[vortilon]]s, [[leading-edge extension]]s, [[leading edge cuff]]s,&lt;ref&gt;A drooped leading edge presents a "vortex-producing discontinuity", in "Spin Resistance Development for Small Airplanes", SAE paper 2000-01-1691&lt;/ref&gt; also delay flow separation at high angles of attack by re-energizing the boundary layer.&lt;ref name="Peppler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MicroHow"/&gt;

Examples of aircraft which use VGs include the [[Embraer 170]] and [[Symphony SA-160]]. For swept-wing transonic designs, VGs alleviate potential [[shock-stall]] problems (e.g., [[Hawker Siddeley Harrier|Harrier]], [[Blackburn Buccaneer]], [[Gloster Javelin]]).

==Aftermarket installation==
Many aircraft carry vane vortex generators from time of manufacture, but there are also aftermarket suppliers who sell VG kits to improve the [[STOL]] performance of some light aircraft.&lt;ref name="Micro"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.microaero.com/|title = Micro Vortex Generators for Single and Twin Engine Aircraft|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Micro AeroDynamics|authorlink = |year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aftermarket suppliers claim (i) that VGs lower stall speed and reduce take-off and landing speeds, and (ii) that VGs increase the effectiveness of ailerons, elevators and rudders, thereby improving controllability and safety at low speeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landshorter.com/page2.html |title=Land Shorter! Benefits |publisher=Landshorter.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; For home-built and experimental [[homebuilt aircraft|kitplane]]s, VGs are cheap, cost-effective and can be installed quickly; but for certified aircraft installations, [[Type certificate|certification]] costs can be high, making the modification a relatively expensive process.&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

Owners fit aftermarket VGs primarily to gain benefits at low speeds, but a downside is that such VGs may reduce cruise speed slightly. In tests performed on a [[Cessna 182]] and a [[Piper Cherokee|Piper PA-28-235 Cherokee]], independent reviewers have documented a loss of cruise speed of {{convert|1.5|to|2.0|kn|km/h|1|abbr=on}} .  However, these losses are relatively minor, since an aircraft wing at high speed has a small angle of attack, thereby reducing VG drag to a minimum.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003"&gt;Psutka, Kevin, ''Micro-vortex generators'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], August 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004"&gt;Kirkby, Bob, ''Vortex Generators for the Cherokee 235'', [[Canadian Owners and Pilots Association|COPA Flight]], July 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Owners have reported that on the ground, it can be harder to clear snow and ice from wing surfaces with VGs than from a smooth wing, but VGs are not generally prone to inflight icing as they reside within the boundary layer of airflow. VGs may also have sharp edges which can tear the fabric of airframe covers and may thus require special covers to be made.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAMay2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COPAJuly2004" /&gt;

For twin-engined aircraft, manufacturers claim that VGs reduce single-engine control speed ([[V speeds|Vmca]]), increase zero fuel and gross weight, improve the effectiveness of ailerons and rudder, provide a smoother ride in turbulence and make the aircraft a more stable instrument platform&lt;ref name="Micro" /&gt;

==Increase in maximum takeoff weight==
Some VG kits available for light twin-engine airplanes may allow an increase in [[maximum takeoff weight]].&lt;ref name="Micro"/&gt;  The maximum takeoff weight of a twin-engine airplane is determined by structural requirements and single-engine climb performance requirements (which are lower for a lower stall speed).  For many light twin-engine airplanes, the single-engine climb performance requirements determine a lower maximum weight rather than the structural requirements.  Consequently, anything that can be done to improve the single-engine-inoperative climb performance will bring about an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

In the USA from 1945&lt;ref&gt;USA Civil Air Regulations, Part 3, §3.85a&lt;/ref&gt; until 1991,&lt;ref name="FAR23"&gt;USA Federal Aviation Regulations, Part 23, §23.67, amendment 23-42, February 4, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement for multi-engine airplanes with a maximum takeoff weight of {{convert|6000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} or less was as follows:
{{quote|All multi-engine airplanes having a stalling speed &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; greater than 70 miles per hour shall have a steady rate of climb of at least &lt;math&gt;0.02(V_{s0})^2&lt;/math&gt; in feet per minute at an altitude of 5,000 feet with the critical engine inoperative and the remaining engines operating at not more than maximum continuous power, the inoperative propeller in the minimum drag position, landing gear retracted, wing flaps in the most favorable position …}}
where &lt;math&gt;V_{s0}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stall (flight)|stalling]] speed in the landing configuration in miles per hour.

Installation of vortex generators can usually bring about a slight reduction in stalling speed of an airplane&lt;ref name="Clancy"/&gt; and therefore reduce the required one-engine-inoperative climb performance.  The reduced requirement for climb performance allows an increase in maximum takeoff weight, at least up to the maximum weight allowed by structural requirements.&lt;ref name="Busch"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.avweb.com/news/reviews/182564-1.html|title = Vortex Generators: Band-Aids or Magic?|accessdate = 2008-03-15|last = Busch|first = Mike|authorlink = |date=November 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An increase in maximum weight allowed by structural requirements can usually be achieved by specifying a [[maximum zero fuel weight]] or, if a maximum zero fuel weight is already specified as one of the airplane's limitations, by specifying a new higher maximum zero fuel weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  For these reasons, vortex generator kits for many light twin-engine airplanes are accompanied by a reduction in maximum zero fuel weight and an increase in maximum takeoff weight.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;

The one-engine-inoperative rate-of-climb requirement does not apply to single-engine airplanes, so gains in the maximum takeoff weight (based on stall speed or structural considerations) are less significant compared to those for 1945–1991 twins.

After 1991, the airworthiness certification requirements in the USA specify the one-engine-inoperative climb requirement as a gradient independent of stalling speed, so there is less opportunity for vortex generators to increase the maximum takeoff weight of multi-engine airplanes whose certification basis is FAR 23 at amendment 23-42 or later.&lt;ref name="FAR23"/&gt;

==Maximum landing weight==
Because the landing weights of most light aircraft are determined by structural considerations and not by stall speed, most VG kits increase only the takeoff weight and &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; the landing weight.  Any increase in landing weight would require either structural modifications or re-testing the aircraft at the higher landing weight to demonstrate that the certification requirements are still met.&lt;ref name="Busch"/&gt;  However, after a lengthy flight, sufficient fuel may have been used, thereby bringing the aircraft back below the permitted maximum landing weight.

==Aircraft noise reduction==
Vortex generators have been used on the wing underside of [[Airbus A320 family]] aircraft to reduce noise generated by airflow over circular pressure equalisation vents for the fuel tanks. Lufthansa claims a noise reduction of up to 2&amp;nbsp;dB can thus be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html More than 200 Lufthansa A320 aircraft to become quieter.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504034353/http://www.lufthansagroup.com/en/press/news-releases/singleview/archive/2014/february/12/article/2797.html |date=2014-05-04 }} Retrieved 2014-05-04&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14717">'''World Inequality Report''' is a report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]] that provides estimates of global income and wealth inequality based on the most recent findings compiled by the World Wealth and Income Database (WID). WID, also referred to as WID.world, is an open source database, that is part of an international collaborative effort of over a hundred researchers in five continents. The World Inequality Report includes discussions on potential future academic research as well as content useful for public debates and policy related to economic inequality. The first report, entitled World Inequality Report 2018, which was released on December 14, 2017 at the [[Paris School of Economics]] during the first WID.world Conference, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Lucas Chancel]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]] based on WID data. The 300-page report cautions that since 1980, around the globe, there has been an increase in the gap between rich and poor. In Europe, the increase in inequality increased more moderately while in North America and Asia, the increase was rapid. In the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil, income inequality did not increase but remained at very high levels.

In an interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty predicted that if the "world follows the trajectory of the US" inequality would get much worse.

==World Inequality Lab==
The  report by the World Inequality Lab at the [[Paris School of Economics]], is "based on the latest evidence collected for the World Wealth and Income Database, a massive project maintained by more than 100 researchers in more than 70 countries."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

Researchers worked on an international collaborative effort to extend the existing database, the World Top Incomes Database (WTID) to the World Wealth and Income Database (WID) which provides data on both distribution of income and wealth, "as well as the distribution of different forms of capital assets, in the analyzed countries".&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt; The WTID "generally focused on the concentration of wealth among the top decile in a given population."&lt;ref name="review_WID"&gt;{{cite journal |series=Reviews of Datasets |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |journal=Journal of World-Historical Information (JWHI)|volume= 2-3 |number=2 |year=2014-2015  |  ISSN=2169-0812 |doi=10.5195/jwhi.2015.33  |url=http://jwhi.pitt.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WID is an "information hub" informing academic research&lt;ref&gt;Anthony B.

By 2015, the WID provided data series on the distribution of income and wealth in thirty-three countries mainly from the Americas and Europe. At that time there the intention was to "include data series for an additional forty countries." The first WID in 2013, which was placed in an open source repository in September 2013, was compiled by [[Facundo Alvaredo]], [[Anthony B. Atkinson]], [[Thomas Piketty]],  [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Gabriel Zucman]].&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WID"&gt;{{citation |title=The World Wealth and Income Database (WID) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Anthony B.  |editor-last2=Atkinson |editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |date=September 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2016 to 2017, through a 2015 Centers for Equitable Growth (CEG), Piketty, Saez, and Zucman studied Distributional National Accounts (DINA) for the United States. "DINA are defined as distributional statistics of pre-tax and post-tax income and wealth consistent with National Income and Product Accounts, and the Flow of Funds of the United States."&lt;ref name="review_WID"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first1=Thomas |last1=Piketty |first2=Emmanuel |last2=Saez |first3=Gabriel |last3=Zucman |title=Summary: CEG Grant: US Distributional Accounts |url=http://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/dina-CEG.pdf |format=PDF |date=June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Piketty, Thomas. 2014.

==World Inequality Report 2018==
In 2018 Facundo Alvaredo, Lucas Chancel, Thomas Piketty,  Emmanuel Saez, and Gabriel Zucmanon compiled the first report, the "World Inequality Report 2018"&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"&gt;{{cite report |title=World Inequality Report (2018) |editor-first1=Facundo |editor-last1=Alvaredo |editor-first2=Lucas   |editor-last2=Chancel|editor-first3=Thomas |editor-last3=Piketty |editor-first4=Emmanuel |editor-last4=Saez |editor-first5=Gabriel |editor-last5=Zucman  |url=http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf |format=PDF |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |pages=300}} "This report emphasizes recent research articles written by: Facundo Alvaredo Lydia Assouad Anthony B.

==Highlights of the World Inequality Report 2018==
The five part 300-page report discusses "the WID.world project and the measurement of economic inequality in Part I, trends in global income inequality in Part II, public versus private capital dynamics in Part III, trends in global wealth inequality in Part IV , tackling Economic Inequality in [http://wir2018.wid.world/files/download/wir2018-full-report-english.pdf#250 Part V]. Methodological "details on how estimations were constructed are available at the report's website".&lt;ref&gt;[wir2018.wid.world Dedicated website for World Inequality Report 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New York Times'', "Policy, it turns out, matters. More aggressive redistribution through taxes and transfers has spared Europe from the acute disparities that Americans have grown used to. Unequal access to education is helping reproduce inequality in the United States down the generations."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|10,16}} The ''Times'' article also noted that, "China's strategy based on low-skill manufacturing for export, and underpinned by aggressive investment in infrastructure, has proven more effective at raising living standards for the bottom half of the population than India's more inward-looking strategy, which has limited the benefits of globalization to the well-educated elite."&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"/&gt; Tetlow of the ''Financial Times'' described inequality as the "defining characteristic of the age" as [[The rich get richer and the poor get poorer]].&lt;ref name="FT_London_Tetlow"/&gt; The ''India Times'' article drew attention to the way in which "[d]eregulation and opening-up reforms in India since 1980s have led to substantial increase in inequality so much that top 0.1% of earners has continued to capture more growth than all those in the bottom 50% combined."&lt;ref name="indiatimes_WIR_2017"/&gt; The WIR reported that, "Income inequality in India has reached historically high levels. In 2014, the share of national income accruing to India's top 1% of earners was 22%, while the share of the top 10% was around 56%."&lt;ref name="WIR_2018"/&gt;{{rp|123}}

''Quartz'' cited the report, "[S]ince 1980 the top 0.1% have captured as much income growth as the entire bottom half of world's (adult) population. And for the group of people in between the bottom 50% and top 1%—mostly the lower- and middle-income groups in North America and Europe—income growth has been either sluggish or flat."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; The WIR 2018 shows that, "The gap between rich and poor has increased in nearly every region in the world over the past few decades."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt; Since "1980, income inequality has increased rapidly in North America and Asia, increased more moderately in Europe, and stabilized at very high levels in the Middle East, Africa, and Brazil."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;

==First WID.world conference==
The conference held on December 14 and December 15, was sponsored by the Paris School of Economics, the [[Institute for New Economic Thinking]], the Washington Center for Equitable Growth (CEG), the [[Ford Foundation]], and the [[European Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wid.world/news-article/first-wid-world-conference-program-available/ |title=First WID.world Conference |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of the first issue of the World Inequality Report #wir2018 on Thursday 14th (9.30 am – 1 pm). The executive committee of the conference included Alvaredo, Chancel, Piketty, Saez, Zucman, the WID.world and the World Inequality Lab Executive Committee. The program included the release of the report that would "provide global estimates of income and wealth inequality drawing on the latest evidence gathered in WID.world" [and ] "discuss implications for future research and the global policy debate on rising inequality". There was a session honoring Tony Atkinson and presentations of "research papers on income and wealth inequality" and "on the DINA-Distributional National Accounts agenda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/news/save-the-date-release-of-the-world-inequality-report-2018-14-december-2017/ |title=(save the date) Release of the World Inequality Report 2018 - 14 December 2017 |date=December 2017 |access-date=December 14, 2017 |work=WID}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Within days of its December 14, 2017 publication online, the report was featured in articles in the ''[[New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name="NYT_Porter_WIR_2018"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/14/business/world-inequality.html |newspaper=New York Times |date=December 14, 2017 |access-date=December 16, 2017 |title=It's an Unequal World.

In the interview with ''Quartz'', Piketty warned of the impediments to getting "a comprehensive picture of wealth", such as [[tax havens]]. Piketty observed that "there are financial and political forces that have a vested interest in keeping this information secret," noting the "paradox of today's globalized economy" where "we are supposed to be in the era of big data and transparency, and we see that we still don't have access to all the data sources we would need."&lt;ref name="Quartz_2017_Piketty_US_WIR"/&gt;
