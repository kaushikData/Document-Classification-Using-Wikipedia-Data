      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9054">While the small physical size of the city-state does not qualify the creation of national subdivisions in the form of [[province]]s, [[State (administrative division)|states]], and other national political divisions found in larger countries, the city has nonetheless been '''administratively subdivided''' in various ways throughout its history for the purpose of local administration and urban planning.

==History==
Historically, these subdivisions have been based on postal districts, especially during the colonial era. When local elections necessitated the setting up of electoral districts, however, it began to supplement postal districts as an alternative form of local governance, since each electoral district is headed by a member of parliament who represents and speaks for the respective electorates.

==Administrative and Electoral Divisions==

===Community Development Council Districts===

{{main article|Community Development Council}}

Established in 1997 by the PA Act, there were 9 districts formerly, governed by 9 different [[Community Development Council|Community Development Councils (CDCs)]]. In 2001, the 9 districts and CDCs were then reformed into 5, namely the [[North East Community Development Council|North East CDC]], [[North West Community Development Council|North West CDC]], [[South East Community Development Council|South East CDC]], [[South West Community Development Council|South West CDC]] and [[Central Singapore Community Development Council|Central Singapore CDC]].&lt;ref name=PAact1997/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19970217-1.2.34.13.aspx|title= First 2 CDCs preparing for launch. |date=February 17, 1997 |publisher=The Straits Times, p. 27. (Retrieved from Newspaper SG)|accessdate=August 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each district is then further divided into [[Constituencies of Singapore|electoral constituencies]] and [[Town council#Singapore|town councils]].

The council boundaries follow that of the existing political divisions, with each handling between four and six [[Group representation constituency|GRCs]] and [[Single member constituency|SMCs]] and roughly dividing the country's population into equal parts. Each CDC is managed by a Council, which in turn is headed by a [[mayor]] and has between 12 and 80 members. The members are appointed by the Chairman or Deputy Chairman of the [[People's Association]].

The role of the CDCs is to initiate, plan and manage community programmes to promote community bonding and social cohesion within local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Fernandez, W. (1996, August 19). [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19960819-1.2.2.aspx PM Goh urges young to rally behind him.] The Straits Times, p. 1. Retrieved from NewspaperSG; The Straits Times, 19 Aug 1996, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; The electoral boundaries of Singapore are relatively fluid, and are reviewed prior to each general election. The districts are composed of the constituencies and electoral districts (the latter as of the 2015 General Elections).

There are currently five CDCs, namely the
*[[Central Singapore Community Development Council]]
*[[North East Community Development Council]]
*[[North West Community Development Council]]
*[[South East Community Development Council]]
*[[South West Community Development Council]]

===Town councils===
The first town councils were set up in September 1986 by the Town Councils Act, with the main purpose of [[Property manager|estate management]].&lt;ref&gt;Low, A. (1986, September 1). [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19860901-1.2.23.9.aspx Town councils take over from HDB.] .The Straits Times, p. 8. Retrieved from NewspaperSG.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the introduction of town councils, housing estates were managed by the [[Housing Development Board]].&lt;ref name=MyKindOfTown&gt;Ngoo, I., et al. (1987, April 7). [http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870407-1.2.29.1.aspx My kind of town.] The Straits Times, Retrieved from NewspaperSG; Koh, T., et al.&lt;/ref&gt; As the estates were centrally managed, the standardised rules that the board had set for all housing estates made HDB towns monotonous in appearance and problems faced by residents in the different estates were not addressed fast enough.&lt;ref name=MyKindOfTown/&gt;

Town councils boundaries are drawn based on electoral district boundaries. A town council area can consist of a [[Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC), a Single Member Constituency (SMC), or a collection of neighbouring GRCs and SMCs controlled by the same political party. The Members of [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] head the town councils of their constituencies. Town councils boundaries do not correspond to [[new towns of Singapore|new town]] boundaries; different parts of the same HDB town may be managed by different town councils.&lt;ref&gt;{{Singapore legislation|title=Town Councils Act|titlelink=|cap=329A|ed=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constituencies=== 
{{main article|Constituencies of Singapore}}

[[File:Electoral boundaries during the Singapore general elections 2015.svg|thumb|500px|centre|Electoral divisions for the [[Singaporean general election, 2015|2015 General Elections]].]]

Town councils are then further subdivided into different constituencies, which are classified as either Single Member Constituencies (SMCs) or Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs). The boundaries of the electoral constituencies are decided by the Elections Department, which is under the control of the Prime Minister's Office.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Au Waipang, 'The Ardour of Tokens: Opposition Parties' Struggle to Make a Difference', in T.Chong (eds), '' Management of Success: Singapore Revisited ''(Singapore, 2010), p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other administrative subdivisions==

===URA Master Plan boundaries===

====Regions====
{{main|Regions of Singapore}}
The regions are groupings of the planning areas.

====Planning Areas====
{{main|Planning Areas of Singapore}}
Regions are further subdivided into planning areas. In the 1990s, the [[Urban Redevelopment Authority]] carved up the country into 55 of these planning areas. Their boundaries became increasingly accepted as an alternative method of subdividing the country, made all the more popular as the boundaries do not change compared to the more fluid nature of electoral boundaries. The Singapore [[Statistics Singapore|Department of Statistics]] adopted these boundaries for the latest 2000 nationwide population census, and the [[Singapore Police Force]] uses them as an approximate guide when demarcating boundaries for its [[Neighbourhood Police Centre]]s, as opposed to the former Neighbourhood Police Post system which was also based on electoral divisions.

===Survey Districts===
Singapore is divided into 64 survey districts, of which 34 are [[mukim]]s (originally, rural districts) and 30 are town subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sla.gov.sg/Services/PropertyOwnership/LandTitlesSearch.aspx|title=Land Titles Search|website=Singapore Land Authority|access-date=2016-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postal Districts===
Postal districts were numbered from 01 to 83 under the new system implemented on 1 September 1995. Census data and most forms of internal boundaries had been based on postal districts until the introduction of new [[Urban planning areas in Singapore|planning boundaries]] in the 1990s.{{Citation needed|reason=Whether census data used postal districts is questionable|date=May 2016}}

In [[physical geology]], '''aspect''' is the compass direction that a slope faces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/475/PMS475_chap2b.pdf National Wildfire Coordinating Group, Basic Land Navigation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626073207/http://www.nwcg.gov/pms/pubs/475/PMS475_chap2b.pdf |date=June 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a slope on the eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]] toward the [[Great Plains]] is described as having an ''easterly aspect''. A slope which falls down to a deep [[valley]] on its western side and a shallower one on its eastern side has a ''westerly aspect'' or is a ''west-facing slope''. The direction a slope faces can affect the physical and biotic features of the slope, known as a '''slope effect'''. The term aspect can also be used to describe the shape or alignment of a [[coastline]]. Here, the aspect is the direction which the coastline is facing towards the sea. For example, a coastline with sea to the northeast (as in most of [[Queensland]]) has a ''northeasterly aspect''.

[[Image:Slope effect.JPG|thumb|200px| Slope effect, a vegetational result of aspect, in evidence in the coastal sage scrub community of southern [[California|California's]] [[Santa Monica Mountains|Santa Monica Mtns]]. The slope on the left side is north-facing, thus moister and dominated by ''[[Ceanothus]] sp.'' The south-facing slope on the right side is much drier (receiving more direct sun), and is more sparsely vegetated with the more drought tolerant ''[[Artemisia californica]]'' and ''[[Yucca whipplei]]''.]]

==Importance of aspect==
Aspect can have a strong influence on temperature. This is because of the angle of the sun in the northern and southern hemispheres which is less than 90 degrees or directly overhead. In the northern hemisphere, the north side of slopes is often shaded, while the southern side receives more solar radiation for a given surface area [[insolation]] because the slope is tilted toward the sun and isn't shaded directly by the earth itself. The further north or south you are and closer to winter solstice the more pronounced the effects of aspect of this are, and on steeper slopes the effect is greater, with no energy received on slopes with an angle greater than 22.5° at 40° north on December 22 ([[winter solstice]]).&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, et al. (1999) ''Terrestrial Plant Ecology, 3rd Ed.'' Benjamin/Cummings. Chapter 14. pp. 390-391&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Effects of aspect on vegetation- SW Idaho.JPG|thumb|Effects of aspect on vegetation can be clearly seen in this photo from Southwest Idaho near Anderson Ranch Reservoir. The north facing slopes receive more snow often because of prevailing winds and are shaded from direct sunlight during the winter, consequently they have more water available to support trees and forests, while the south facing slopes which receive more insolation is much hotter and dryer and supports only smaller more desert adapted woody plant species.North facing slopes here are dominated by a Pinus ponderosa, Pseudotsuga menziesii forest while the south facing slopes are mainly dominated by desert shrubs Artemisia tridentata and Purshia tridentata.]]

The aspect of a [[slope]] can make very significant influences on its local [[climate]] ([[microclimate]]). For example, because the [[sun]]'s rays are in the [[west]] at the hottest time of day in the afternoon, in most cases a west-facing slope will be warmer than a sheltered east-facing slope (unless large-scale rainfall influences dictate otherwise). This can have major effects on altitudinal and [[tree line|polar limits of tree growth]] and also on the distribution of vegetation that requires large quantities of moisture. In [[Australia]], for example, remnants of rainforest are almost always found on ''east-facing slopes'' which are protected from dry westerly [[wind]].

Similarly, in the [[northern hemisphere]] a south-facing slope (more open to sunlight and warm winds) will therefore generally be warmer and drier due to higher levels of [[evapotranspiration]] than a north-facing slope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bennie | first = Jonathan |author2=Mark O. Hill|author3=Robert Baxter|author4=Brian Huntley | title = Influence of slope and aspect on long-term vegetation change in British chalk grasslands | journal = Journal of Ecology | year = 2006 | volume = 94 | issue = 2 | pages = 355–368 | accessdate =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2745.2006.01104.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be seen in the [[Swiss Alps]], where [[agriculture|farming]] is much more extensive on south-facing than on north-facing slopes. In the [[Himalaya]]s, this effect can be seen to an extreme degree, with south-facing slopes being warm, wet and forested, and north-facing slopes cold, dry but much more heavily [[glaciated]].

== Soil aspects ==

In some locales there are patterns of soil differences related to differences in aspect. Strong slopes with equatorward aspects tend to have [[soil organic matter]] levels and seasonal influences similar to level slopes at lower elevation whereas poleward aspects have [[pedogenesis|soil development]] similarities to level soils at higher elevations. Soils with a prevailing [[windward]] aspect will typically be shallower, and often with more developed subsoil characteristics, than adjacent soils on the [[leeward]] where decelerating winds tend to deposit more [[Aeolian processes|air-borne]] particulate material. Outside of the tropics, soils with an aspect directed toward an early afternoon solar position will typically have the lowest soil moisture content and lowest soil organic matter content relative to other available aspects in a locale.  Aspect similarly influence seasonal [[soil life|soil biological]] processes that are temperature dependent. Particulate laden winds often blow from a prevailing direction near solar early afternoon, the effects combine in pattern common to both hemispheres.

==Coastal aspects==

These are usually of importance only in the [[tropics]], but there they produce many unexpected climatic effects:

* The dryness of the [[Dahomey Gap]], due to the rain-bearing winds moving ''parallel to the coast''.
* The summer dryness of the [[Coromandel Coast]] due to the southerly [[monsoon]] flowing ''parallel to the coast''. Its wetness during the northeast monsoon is similarly explained.
* The anomalous late autumn rainy seasons of central [[Vietnam]] and the [[Zona da Mata (coastal)|coastal zone of northeastern Brazil]] for the same reason as above.
* The unusual dryness of [[Port Moresby]] compared to the rest of [[New Guinea]] is because the National Capital District lies parallel to the [[trade winds]] which have a drying effect. In [[Gulf (PNG)|Gulf Province]] and [[Lae]], which receives their full force, rainfall during southern winter is exceedingly heavy, with rainfall and thunder storms  during the rainy season.
* The relative dryness of the Queensland coast has the same cause as with Port Moresby.

A '''consular district''' is a sub-national region designated by a [[Consulate|consular post]] to exercise consular functions in a host country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Vienna Convention on Consular Relations |date=1963 |work=[[United Nations]] |publisher=[[United Nations Office of Legal Affairs|UN Office of Legal Affairs]] |url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180813173321/http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_2_1963.pdf |archivedate=2018-08-13 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consular district is serviced by a consul or "consul-general" and is headquartered at a consulate or "consulate-general." It is a common utility for spreading diplomatic representation and services to regions of a host country beyond a guest country's embassy in the capital.

==Example==
For instance, the United States' consular representation in [[India]] and [[Bhutan]] is divided into 5 regions. One of which, the New Delhi Consular District (based at the U.S. consulate in New Delhi), covers the Indian states of Delhi, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Uttaranchal, and the Kingdom of Bhutan. Consular districts are demarcated to serve only citizens resident within the district with non-immigrant visas.

'''''Event[0]''''' is a [[First-person (video games)|first-person]] [[science fiction]] [[Exploration game|exploration]] [[video game]] developed and published by Ocelot Society. It was released on September 14, 2016 for both [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]].

==Plot and gameplay==
''Event[0]'' is set in an [[alternate timeline]] where humanity achieved interplanetary space travel as early as the 1980s. The game takes place in this timeline's 2012, where the player's character is selected by International Transport Spacelines (ITS) to be part of a mission to Jupiter's moon [[Europa (moon)|Europa]], from Earth. En route, the ship suffers a catastropic failure and the player-character appears to be the only member of its crew to escape into a lifepod. The pod drifts for several weeks until it comes across the ''Nautilus'', a leisure ship built in the 1980s. The player-character docks with the ship, and discovers that while the ''Nautilus'' is still functional, it has fallen into disrepair, with no sign of its human crew. The only conversations on the ship are through the ship's [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) named Kaizen-85 (from the Japanese word [[kaizen]] meaning "continuous improvement"), who communicates with the player-character through keyboard terminals throughout the ship. Kaizen-85 instructs the player-character to destroy the ''Nautilus''{{'}}s "Singularity Drive", the engine that powers the ship, as it claims this will enable it to return them both back to Earth.&lt;ref name=pcg/&gt;&lt;ref name=steam/&gt; However, as the player explores the station more, they discover that many of the doors and systems have been locked down apparently by the previous human crew, and must work with Kaizen-85 to access these systems.

The player communicates with the AI by physically typing input instead of selecting from a set of inputs.&lt;ref name=WCCFtech/&gt; The AI is capable of procedurally generating over two million lines of dialog, with personality influenced by the player's input.&lt;ref name=euro/&gt; The player must gather clues as to discover what happened on the ship and eventually finds out that Captain of the ''Nautilus'', Anele Johnson, murdered one of the crew so as not to allow Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. When the player recovers the code to the bridge terminal and enters it, they can find Anele Johnson's body in one of the seats, who was presumably killed after uploading her consciousness into the Nautilus's mainframe. Depending on the player's choices and their attitude previously to Kaizen, multiple endings can occur.

===Endings===
The first ending is achieved when the player allows Kaizen to destroy the Singularity Drive. The player will then engage in a conversation with Anele Johnson's consciousness via computer; she is angry at the player and explains that in order to save humanity, the player must upload his/her consciousness into the computer so as to overpower Kaizen. If the player agrees to this, the player-character is killed and their consciousness uploaded into the computer. Within the computer system, they are told by Anele's consciousness that Kurt, the President of ITS, convinced Kaizen to lie about the Singularity Drive. She also explains that destroying the Drive will mean that humans will never develop advanced colonies. After going through all the doors, Anele asks the player if they want to go home and the final door will open and Earth can be seen in the distance before the credits roll.

The second ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness. If the player has mistreated Kaizen, he will reply that he is "too old for this" and will delete his memory from the ''Nautilus''{{'}}s mainframe and hand over control to the player. A cut scene will play out showing the current state of each room the player previously explored before the credits roll.  

The third ending is achieved if the player refuses to upload their consciousness but treated Kaizen kindly enough, he will remember events during their time speaking before he launches the emergency boosters and tells the player: "Let's go home." A cut scene will play with the ''Nautilus'' steadily moving towards the Earth before the credits roll.

Although the game has three endings, a fourth ending can be achieved if the player refuses to destroy the Singularity Drive, refuses to upload their consciousness, and has treated Kaizen kindly throughout the game. After questioning the player's trust, Kaizen can be convinced to send the ''Nautilus'' to Earth even though the player didn't destroy the drive. The same cut-scene as the third ending will play before the credits. The fourth ending is actually due to a [[software bug|bug]] in the game and was labeled as a "secret ending".

==Development==
''Event[0]'' began as part of a graduate student project at the National School of Video Game and Interactive Media in France (Enjmin) in 2013. The students later formed Ocelot Society in order to continue development into a commercial project.&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;&lt;ref name=igm/&gt; The team that worked on ''Event[0]'' is composed of eleven people.&lt;ref name=igm/&gt; In 2014, the game received the student award at the European Indie Game Days as well as the Innovation award at BIG 2015. ''Event[0]'' received funding from France's [[National Center of Cinematography and the moving image|CNC]], as well as from the [[Indie Fund]].&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;

The game, as released, had three expected endings, with Ocelot Society having dropped a possible fourth ending prior to release. However, around July 2017, Emmanuel Corno, one of the developers and writers at Ocelot, noted that the [[Wikipedia]] page for the game had described a different fourth ending to the game (the last one listed above) which he affirmed was possible to obtain in the released game, and was not the same as the dropped ending. Corno attributed this unexpected ending to be the result of a bug that the team had not caught until this point, but was pleased that it existed as it made the artificial intelligence they created feel "more human".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/301642/Event0_has_an_ending_so_secret_even_the_dev_team_didnt_know_about_it.php | title=  Event[0] has an ending so secret even the dev team didn't know about it | first = Alex | last = Wawro | date = July 12, 2017 | accessdate = July 12, 2017 | work = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Event[0]'' has received positive reviews and has a score of 78 on [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="mc" /&gt; Reviewers have compared ''Event[0]'' to games such as the solitary narrative of ''[[Firewatch]]'',&lt;ref name=euro/&gt; as well as the ''[[King's Quest]]'' series.&lt;ref name=inverse/&gt; The environment has been compared to the spaceship in [[Ridley Scott]]'s [[Alien (film)|''Alien'']].&lt;ref name=inverse/&gt; Several reviewers have also noted the similarities between ''Event[0]'s'' Kaizen AI and [[HAL 9000]] from [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref name=euro/&gt;&lt;ref name=pcg2/&gt; A common complaint even among positive reviews is the game's very short play time: as little as 3 hours for the first playthrough and an hour for subsequent playthroughs for the other endings. ''Event[0]'' was nominated for the [[Seumas McNally Grand Prize]] and for the Excellence in Design and Excellence in Narrative awards for the 2017 [[Independent Games Festival]].&lt;ref name="IGF: 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polygon.com/2017/1/9/14214750/2017-igf-awards-nominees-inside-hyper-light-drifter-virginia-host-nina-freeman | title = Hyper Light Drifter, Inside and Virginia among nominees for 2017 IGF Awards | first = Charlie | last = Hall | date = January 9, 2017 | accessdate = January 9, 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4585">
* The tallest [[mountain]] in [[Antarctica]] is [[Mount Vinson]] rising 4,892 metres (16,050 feet) above sea level.
* The lowest point in Antarctica is within the [[Bentley Subglacial Trench]], which reaches 2,555 metres below sea level.  This is also the lowest place on Earth not covered by ocean (although it is covered by ice).
* The lowest accessible point in Antarctica is the shore of Deep Lake, [[Vestfold Hills]], which is 50 m{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} beneath sea level.
* The point on land farthest from any coastline on the Antarctic Continent is located at {{Coord|83|06|S|54|58|E|}}.  This is also known as the South [[Pole of inaccessibility]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polarheritage.com/index.cfm/Sitelist01up Historic Sites &amp; Monuments in Antarctica], International Polar Heritage Committee&lt;/ref&gt;
* Antarctica is the southernmost [[land mass]] on [[Earth]].  The Geographical [[South Pole]] lies on the Polar Plateau at {{Coord|90|00|S|00|00|W|}}.  It is here that the southernmost human habitation on Earth is located: [[Amundsen–Scott South Pole Station]] (U.S. Administered Base).
* [[Vostok Station]] is the most isolated research base on the continent (located at {{Coord|77|S|105|E|}}), and it is situated over the southernmost lake in the world, [[Lake Vostok]], a subglacial lake 4,000 metres (13,000 feet) under the surface of the ice where the station sits. Formerly administrated by the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], it is now operated by [[Russia]].
* The southernmost [[volcano]] on the planet—[[Mount Erebus]]—is in Antarctica on the world's southernmost island reachable from the sea: [[Ross Island]].
* The southernmost island is [[Berkner Island]]. It is embedded in the [[ice shelf]], fully covered by ice and fully below sea level.
* The [[Ross Sea]] is the southernmost sea in the world, with its southernmost extremity ([[Gould Coast]]) at the foot of the [[Horlick Mountains]] approximately 200 miles (320&amp;nbsp;km) from the Geographic South Pole. However, this area is covered by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]]. The southernmost open sea is also part of Ross Sea, namely [[Bay of Whales]] at 78°30'S, at the edge of Ross Ice Shelf.
* The northernmost extremity of the Antarctic mainland (without nearshore islands) is [[Prime Head]], at the northern tip of the [[Trinity Peninsula]] at {{Coord|63|12|48|S|57|18|08|W|}}.  The Antarctic Peninsula is the largest contiguous part of the continent projecting north of the [[Antarctic Circle]] and thus has many of the continent's research bases. Prime Head is 609&amp;nbsp;mi (980&amp;nbsp;km) from [[Cape Horn]]. The northernmost research base on the mainland is [[Esperanza Base]].

==Other extremes==
* While animal life such as [[penguins]] and [[Pinniped|seals]] are found all around the Antarctic coastline, the continent's only flowering plants are found on the northern portion of the Antarctic Peninsula (see [[Antarctic flora]]).
* Highest temperature so far recorded in Antarctica: {{convert|14.6|°C}} at [[Vanda Station]] ([[New Zealand]] administered station) on 5 January 1974.
* Lowest temperature so far recorded in Antarctica: {{convert|-93.2|°C}} in the interior of the Antarctica on August 2010. The record temperature was found by scientists sifting through decades of climate data taken by Earth-orbiting satellites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsidc.org/news/press/2013_ColdestPlace_PR.html|title=Press Release: Landsat 8 helps unveil the coldest place on Earth|date=9 December 2013|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the previous record was {{convert|-89.2|°C}} at [[Vostok, Antarctica|Vostok]] ([[Russia]]n administered station) on 21 July 1983 and it is to this day more widely known.
* The highest non-[[cyclone|cyclonic]] winds ever recorded on the Continent were at [[Commonwealth Bay]] ({{Coord|66|54|S|142|40|E|}}), which is about {{convert|48|km}} wide and located at the entrance between [[Point Alden]] and [[Cape Gray]].  Winds regularly exceed 200&amp;nbsp;km/h here. The fastest wind ever recorded was in the base [[Belgrano II]] at {{convert|351|km/h|abbr=on}}.
* Antarctica has the world's lowest [[rainfall]] average (zero at the Geographic South Pole) and thus is the world's driest continent.
* Despite its low rainfall average, Antarctica has approximately 70% of the world's fresh water (as well as 90% of the world's ice).

'''[[Ivory Coast]]''' (Côte d'Ivoire) is a [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan]] nation in southern [[West Africa]] located at 8 00°N, 5 00°W. The country is approximately square in shape. Its southern border is a {{convert|515|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} coastline on the [[Gulf of Guinea]] on the north Atlantic Ocean. On the other three sides it borders five other African nations for a total of {{convert|3458|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}: [[Liberia]] to the southwest for {{convert|778|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Guinea]] to the northwest for {{convert|816|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mali]] to the north-northwest for {{convert|599|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, [[Burkina Faso]] to the north-northeast for {{convert|545|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Ghana]] to the east for {{convert|720|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

Ivory Coast comprises {{convert|322463|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|318003|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is land and {{convert|4460|km2|mi2|-1|abbr=on}} is water, which makes the country about the size of [[Germany]].

== Maritime claims ==
Ivory Coast makes maritime claims of {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1|lk=on}} as an [[exclusive economic zone]], {{convert|12|nmi|km mi|1}} of territorial sea, and a {{convert|200|nmi|km mi|1}} [[continental shelf]].

==Terrain and topography==
Ivory Coast's terrain can generally be described as a large plateau rising gradually from sea level in the south to almost {{convert|500|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} elevation in the north. The nation's natural resources have made it into a comparatively prosperous nation in the [[Economy of Africa|African economy]]. 
The southeastern region of Ivory Coast is marked by coastal inland lagoons that starts at the Ghanaian border and stretch {{convert|300|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} along the eastern half of the coast. The southern region, especially the southwest, is covered with dense tropical moist forest. The [[Eastern Guinean forests]] extend from the Sassandra River across the south-central and southeast portion of Ivory Coast and east into [[Ghana]], while the [[Western Guinean lowland forests]] extend west from the [[Sassandra River]] into [[Liberia]] and southeastern [[Guinea]]. The mountains of [[Dix-Huit Montagnes]] region, in the west of the country near the border with Guinea and Liberia, are home to the [[Guinean montane forests]].

The [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]] belt extends across the middle of the country from east to west, and is the transition zone between the coastal forests and the interior [[savanna]]s. The forest-savanna mosaic interlaces forest, savanna and grassland habitats. Northern Ivory Coast is part of the [[West Sudanian Savanna]] ecoregion of the [[Tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]]. It is a zone of lateritic or sandy soils, with vegetation decreasing from south to north.

The terrain is mostly flat to undulating plain, with mountains in the northwest. The lowest elevation in Ivory Coast is at sea level on the coasts. The highest elevation is [[Mount Nimba]], at {{convert|1752|m}} in the far west of the country along the border with Guinea and Liberia.

==Rivers==
{{See also|List of rivers of Ivory Coast}}

The Cavalla River drains the western border area of the Ivory Coast and eastern Liberia. It forms the southern two-thirds of the international boundary between Liberia and Côte d'Ivoire.

The [[Sassandra River]] forms in the Guinea highlands and drains much of the western part of the Ivory Coast east of the Cavalla River.

The [[Bandama River]] is the longest river in the Ivory Coast with a length of some {{convert|800|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} draining the east central part of the country.  In 1973 the [[Kossou Dam]] was constructed at [[Kossou]] on the Bandama creating [[Lake Kossou]].  The capital, [[Yamoussoukro]], is located near the river south of the lake.

The [[Komoé River]] originates on the [[Sikasso]] Plateau of [[Burkina Faso]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|author1=Rupley, Lawrence A. |author2=Bangali, Lamissa |author3=Diamitani, Boureima |title=Sikasso Plateau|year=2013|encyclopedia=Historical Dictionary of Burkina Faso|location=Lanham, Maryland|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=HnRbA-pYcegC&amp;pg=PA197 197]|isbn=978-0-8108-6770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and briefly follows the border between Burkina Faso and [[Ivory Coast]] before entering Ivory Coast. It drains the northeastern and eastern-most portions of the country before emptying into the eastern end of the [[Ébrié Lagoon]] and ultimately the [[Gulf of Guinea]] in the Atlantic Ocean.  Its waters contribute to the [[Comoé National Park]].&lt;ref name="Mepham1991"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mepham|first=Robert|title=IUCN Directory of African Wetlands|publisher=Pinter Pub. Ltd.|year=1991|isbn=2-88032-949-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The [[climate]] of Ivory Coast is generally warm and humid, ranging from [[equator]]ial in the southern coasts to [[Tropics|tropical]] in the middle and semiarid in the far north. There are three seasons: warm and dry (November to March), hot and dry (March to May), and hot and wet (June to October). Temperatures average between {{convert|25|and|32|°C|°F|1}} and range from {{convert|10|to|40|°C|°F}}.

==Crops and natural resources==
Ivory Coast has a large [[timber]] industry due to its large forest coverage. The nation's [[hardwood]] exports match that of [[Brazil]]. In recent years there has been much concern about the rapid rate of [[deforestation]]. [[Rainforest]]s are being destroyed at a rate sometimes cited as the highest in the world. The only forest left completely untouched in Ivory Coast is [[Taï National Park]] (''Parc National de Taï''), a {{convert|3600|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} area in the country's far southwest that is home to over 150 [[Endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species and many other [[endangered species]] such as the [[Pygmy hippopotamus]] and 11 species of [[monkey]]s.

Nine percent of the country is [[arable land]]. Ivory Coast is the world's largest producer of cocoa, a major national [[cash crop]]. Other chief crops include [[coffee]], [[banana]]s, and [[Elaeis guineensis|oil palms]], which produce [[palm oil]] and kernels. [[Natural resource]]s include [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[diamond]]s, [[manganese]], [[iron]], [[cobalt]], [[bauxite]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[nickel]], [[tantalum]], [[silica]] sand, [[clay]], [[palm oil]], and [[hydropower]].

==Natural hazards==
[[Natural hazard]]s include the heavy surf and the lack of [[natural harbor]]s on the coast; during the rainy season torrential flooding is a danger.

== Extreme points ==

Extreme points are the geographic points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in the country.

* Northernmost point – the point at which the border with [[Mali]] enters the [[Bagoé river]], [[Savanes District]], the [[Sahel]].
* Easternmost point – unnamed location on the border with [[Ghana]] south-west of the town of [[Tanbi]], [[Zanzan District|Zanzan]]
* Southernmost point – [[Boubré]], [[Bas-Sassandra District|Bas-Sassandra district]]
* Westernmost point -  unnamed location on the border with [[Liberia]] in the [[Nuon river]] west of [[Klobli]], [[Montagnes District|Montagnes district]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3394">The '''geology of [[Guatemala]]''' encompasses rocks divided into two tectonic blocks. The Maya Block in the north has igneous and metamorphic North American Craton basement rocks, overlain by late Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks, which experienced deformation during the [[Devonian]]. [[Red beds]], evaporites and marine limestone from the Mesozoic overlie these rocks. A [[karst]] landscape formed in the thick limestone units across the north of the country. During a collisional orogeny, these Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks were uplifted, thrusted and folded as the Central Guatemalan Cordillera. Paleogene rocks from the early Cenozoic include volcanic and marine clastic rocks, associated with high rates of erosion.

By contrast, to the south of the Motagua Valley, the underlying rocks belong to the [[Chortis Block]]—the northern section of the Caribbean Plate. Many geologists have interpreted the Chortis Block as having "translated" eastward to its present position, with [[Cretaceous]] brittle deformation and uplift suggesting a connection to the [[Laramide orogeny]] building up the Rocky Mountains to the north.

Particularly within the [[Quaternary]], the Cocos Plate which split off the Pacific Plate in the [[Oligocene]] has subducted beneath the Caribbean and North American plates, producing a chain of volcanoes along the Pacific Coast of Guatemala. The North American and Caribbean plates are moving with strike-slip displacement along the Motagua-Polochic Fault Zone.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthsci.stanford.edu/research/mahood/bio/SAP_Guatemala_guidebook.pdf|date=2005-12-18|title=Field Guide to Guatemalan Geology – Stanford Alpine Project 2004-2005|accessdate=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3852">{{History of Berlin}}
The '''Greater Berlin Act''' ({{lang-de|Groß-Berlin-Gesetz}}), in full the '''Law Regarding the Creation of the New Municipality of Berlin''' ({{lang-de|Gesetz über die Bildung einer neuen Stadtgemeinde Berlin}}), was a law passed by the [[Free State of Prussia|Prussia]]n government in 1920 that greatly expanded the size of the [[Germany|German]] capital of [[Berlin]].

==History==
[[Image:Groß-Berlin.png|thumb|Pre-1920 municipal limits of the City of Berlin (dark red) within the extended city area of Greater Berlin (light red)]]
[[File:Die Erweiterung Berlins durch das Groß-Berlin-Gesetz von 1920 (Karte).png|thumb|Map showing the new territories merged into Berlin in 1920]]
Berlin had been part of the [[Province of Brandenburg]] since 1815. On 1 April 1881, the city became [[History of Berlin|Stadtkreis Berlin]], a city district separate from Brandenburg. The Greater Berlin Act was passed by the [[Landtag of Prussia|Prussian parliament]] on 27 April 1920 and came into effect on 1 October of the same year. The region then termed ''Greater Berlin'' acquired territories from the Province of Brandenburg and consisted of the following:
* The city of Berlin (''Alt-Berlin'');
* 7 towns that surrounded Berlin: [[Charlottenburg]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lichtenberg]], [[Neukölln]], [[Schöneberg]], [[Spandau]] and [[Wilmersdorf]];
* 59 rural communities and 27 estate districts from the surrounding districts of [[Niederbarnim]], [[Osthavelland]] and [[Teltow (district)|Teltow]];
* and the grounds of the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] which curiously, until this point, formed an estate district in its own right.

The act increased the area of Berlin 13-fold from 66&amp;nbsp;km² (25.5&amp;nbsp;mi²) to 883&amp;nbsp;km² (341&amp;nbsp;mi²) and the population doubled from approximately 1.9 million to near 4 million, with almost 1.2 million of these new inhabitants coming from the 7 surrounding towns alone.

Greater Berlin was then sub-divided into 20 [[Boroughs and localities of Berlin|boroughs]] (''Verwaltungsbezirke''):
* from Alt-Berlin: [[Mitte]], [[Tiergarten, Berlin|Tiergarten]], [[Wedding (Berlin)|Wedding]], [[Prenzlauer Berg]], [[Kreuzberg]] and [[Friedrichshain]];
* one borough for each of the 7 previously independent towns: [[Charlottenburg]], [[Köpenick]], [[Lichtenberg]], [[Neukölln]], [[Schöneberg]], [[Spandau]] and [[Wilmersdorf]];
* 7 new boroughs created from the remaining added areas, each named after the largest village in the area at the time: [[Pankow]], [[Reinickendorf]], [[Steglitz]], [[Tempelhof]], [[Treptow]], [[Berlin-Weißensee|Weißensee]] and [[Zehlendorf (Berlin)|Zehlendorf]]

Through this law, it became possible to implement integrated [[town planning]] across the whole of Greater Berlin. With this, the act was an important foundation for the rise of Berlin to a cultural centre of Europe in the [[1920s Berlin|1920s]].

Apart from minor changes, the city boundary defined in the law is still the same as today, even though its character has changed several times over the years. Originally a mere municipal boundary, it became a demarcation line between [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|occupation zones]] after 1945, a part of the [[Iron Curtain]] after 1949 with the [[Berlin Wall]] on some of its length between 1961 and 1990. Since the [[reunification of Germany]] it is the border between the German states of Berlin and [[Brandenburg]].

[[Image:Hadruthos.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The Hadrut Regional Hospital]]
'''Hadrut Province''' (Հադրութ in [[Armenian language|Armenian]]) is a [[Administrative divisions of the Republic of Artsakh|province]] of the ''de facto'' [[Republic of Artsakh]]. The Republic has [[Political status of Nagorno-Karabakh|limited international recognition]]. It is ''de jure'' part of the Republic of [[Azerbaijan]]. It forms the southern border of Nagorno-Karabakh, and one of the most [[mountain]]ous parts. Villages are primarily found along two river valleys and scattered in lower elevations on the very southern fringe. Excavations of the [[Azykh Cave|Azokh Cave]] show that humans have inhabited this area for tens of thousands of years, and the region has a rich history.

Hadrut province has 30 communities of which 1 is considered urban and 29 are rural. The most important problems are drinking and irrigation water, and internal communication roads. Some villages are lacking a telephone network and some have difficulties with watching Armenian TV channels. More than 340 people of Hadrut Region fell victim during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh war]].{{cn|date=June 2017}} Nearly 30% of its area has been ruined and burnt several times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.hetq.am/eng/society/0610-hadrut.html Hetq.am Now the time has come for building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531152833/http://archive.hetq.am/eng/society/0610-hadrut.html |date=2011-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 3166-2:GQ''' is the entry for [[Equatorial Guinea]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Equatorial Guinea, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for two levels of subdivisions:
* 2 regions (i.e., the [[Continental Region (Equatorial Guinea)|Continental Region]] and the [[Insular Region (Equatorial Guinea)|Insular Region]])
* [[provinces of Equatorial Guinea|7 provinces]]

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|GQ}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Equatorial Guinea. The second part is either of the following:
* one letter: regions
* two letters: provinces

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

[[ISO 639-1]] codes are used to represent subdivision names in the following [[official language|administrative languages]]:
* (es): [[Spanish language|Spanish]]
* (fr): [[French language|French]]
* (pt): [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]

'''ISO 3166-2:IR''' is the entry for the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]] in [[ISO 3166-2]], part of the [[ISO 3166]] [[standardization|standard]] published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), which defines [[code]]s for the names of the principal [[country subdivision|subdivision]]s (e.g., [[province]]s or [[state (administrative division)|state]]s) of all [[country|countries]] coded in [[ISO 3166-1]].

Currently for Iran, ISO 3166-2 codes are defined for [[provinces of Iran|31 provinces]].

Each code consists of two parts, separated by a hyphen. The first part is {{mono|IR}}, the [[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] code of Iran. The second part is two digits:
* 01&amp;ndash;25 except 09: provinces as of the early 1990s (09 was used by the dissolved [[Khorāsān Province]])
* 26&amp;ndash;28: provinces created between 1995 and 1997
* 29&amp;ndash;31: provinces created after the division of Khorāsān in 2004
* 32: province created in 2010

==Current codes==
Subdivision names are listed as in the ISO 3166-2 standard published by the ISO 3166 Maintenance Agency (ISO 3166/MA).

'''John Alan Glennon''' (born September 24, 1970) is an [[United States|American]] [[geographer]] and [[explorer]]. His work has been mapping and describing [[caves]] and [[geysers]].

==Discoveries and research==
===Caves===
In 1996, Glennon and Jon Jasper discovered an entrance to the [[Martin Ridge Cave System]], [[Kentucky]], and explored connections to nearby Jackpot and Whigpistle Caves (Groves, C.G. 1998). The combined [[cave]] system is {{convert|51|km|mi|sp=us}} long (Gulden, B. 2005). The [[cave]] is hydrologically connected to [[Mammoth Cave]]---the world's longest [[cave]] (Quinlan J.F. and Ray, J. 1989). Glennon also was involved in the discovery of one of the largest [[cave]] chambers in [[Kentucky]] (Yonker, R. 2003).

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:tatio3.jpg|frame|right|A portion of El Tatio Geyser Field, Chile.]] --&gt;

===Geysers===
In 2002, Glennon led an [[United States|American]] expedition to [[El Tatio]] [[Geyser]] Field, [[Chile]]. The team produced the first comprehensive inventory and description of the geysers' behaviors. The resulting report concluded that the site was the world's third largest [[geyser]] field (Glennon, J.A. and Pfaff, R.M. 2003).

===Hoffman Environmental Research Institute (HERI)===
With Dr. [[Cave Research Foundation|Chris Groves]], president of the [[Cave Research Foundation (2004-2006)]], Glennon cofounded HERI in 1999. The Institute's mission is to study the [[natural environment|environmental]] and [[geologic]] aspects of [[caves]] and [[karst]] landscapes. Headquartered at [[Western Kentucky University]], HERI's major scientific focus has been on the [[karst]] issues of [[China]].

==Background==
Glennon was a [[geography]] [[Ph.D.]] [[student]] of Dr. [[Michael Frank Goodchild]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and received his PhD in 2013. Goodchild is a pioneer in [[Geographic Information Science]] and discoverer of [[Castleguard Cave]], Canada's longest [[cave]]. Glennon received a [[Master of Science]] in [[Geoscience]] from [[Western Kentucky University]], 2001, and [[Bachelor of Science]] in Park Administration from [[Texas A&amp;M University]], 1994.

For his cave discoveries in Kentucky, Alan has been commissioned in the [[Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7838">This is a list of the '''mammal species recorded in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands''', a small [[Indian Ocean]] archipelago approximately midway between [[Australia]] and [[ Sri Lanka]]. There are two non-[[marine mammal]] species in the [[Cocos (Keeling) Islands]], neither of which is believed to be threatened.&lt;ref&gt;This list is derived from the [[IUCN Red List]] which lists species of mammals and includes those mammals that have recently been classified as extinct (since 1500 AD). The taxonomy and naming of the individual species is based on those used in existing Wikipedia articles as of 21 May 2007 and supplemented by the common names and taxonomy from the IUCN, Smithsonian Institution, or University of Michigan where no Wikipedia article was available.
&lt;/ref&gt;

The following tags are used to highlight each species' conservation status as assessed by the [[World Conservation Union|IUCN]]:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| EX ||'''Extinct'''|| No reasonable doubt that the last individual has died.
|-
| EW ||'''Extinct in the wild'''|| Known only to survive in captivity or as a naturalized populations well outside its previous range.
|-
| CR ||'''Critically Endangered'''|| The species is in imminent risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| EN ||'''Endangered'''|| The species is facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| VU ||'''Vulnerable'''|| The species is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild.
|-
| NT ||'''Near Threatened'''|| The species does not meet any of the criteria that would categorise it as risking extinction but it is likely to do so in the future.
|-
| LC ||'''Least Concern'''|| There are no current identifiable risks to the species.
|-
| DD ||'''Data Deficient'''|| There is inadequate information to make an assessment of the risks to this species.
|}

Some species were assessed using an earlier set of criteria. Species assessed using this system have the following instead of Near Threatened and Least Concern categories:
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:left"
|-
| LR/cd || '''Lower Risk/conservation dependent''' || Species which were the focus of conservation programmes and may have moved into a higher risk category if that programme was discontinued.
|-
| LR/nt || '''Lower Risk/near threatened''' || Species which are close to being classified as Vulnerable but are not the subject of conservation programmes.
|-
| LR/lc || '''Lower Risk/least concern''' || Species for which there are no identifiable risks.
|}

==Subclass: [[Theria]]==

===Infraclass: [[Eutheria]]===

====Order: [[Chiroptera]] (bats)====
----
The bats' most distinguishing feature is that their forelimbs are developed as wings, making them the only mammals in the world naturally capable of flight. Bat species account for about 20% of all mammals.

*** [[Wrinkle-lipped Free-tailed Bat]] ''Chaerephon plicata'' LR/lc

====Order: [[Cetacea]] (whales and dolphins and porpoises)====
----
The order Cetacea includes [[whale]]s, [[dolphin]]s and [[porpoise]]s. They are the mammals most fully [[aquatic adaptation|adapted to aquatic]] life with a spindle-shaped nearly hairless body, protected by a thick layer of blubber, and forelimbs and tail modified to provide propulsion underwater.

*Suborder: [[Mysticeti]]
**Family: [[Balaenopteridae]]

'''MARC''' ([[Machine-readable data|'''MA'''chine-'''R'''eadable]] [[Cataloguing|'''C'''ataloging]]) '''[[Technical standard|standards]]''' are a set of [[Digital data|digital]] [[File format|formats]] for the description of items catalogued by libraries, such as books.  Working with the [[Library of Congress]], American computer scientist [[Henriette Avram]] developed MARC in the 1960s to create records that could be read by computers and shared among libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schudel|first=Matt|title=Henriette Avram, 'Mother of MARC,' Dies|url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/0605/avram.html|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1971, MARC formats had become the US national standard for dissemination of [[Bibliographic database|bibliographic data]]. Two years later, they became the [[international standard]].
There are several versions of MARC in use around the world, the most predominant being [[MARC 21]], created in 1999 as a result of the harmonization of U.S. and Canadian MARC formats, and [[UNIMARC]], widely used in Europe. The MARC 21 family of standards now includes formats for [[authority record]]s, holdings records, [[Library classification|classification schedules]], and community information, in addition to the format for [[bibliographic record]]s.

==Record structure and field designations==

The MARC standards define three aspects of a MARC record:  the field designations within each record, the structure of the record, and the actual content of the record itself.

===Field designations===

Each '''field''' in a MARC record provides particular information about the item the record is describing, such as the author, title, publisher, date, language, media type, etc.  Since it was first developed at a time when computing power was low, and space precious, MARC uses a simple three-digit numeric code (from 001-999) to identify each field in the record.  MARC defines field 100 as the primary author of a work, field 245 as the title and field 260 as the publisher, for example.

Fields above 008 are further divided into '''subfields''' using a single letter or number designation.  The 260, for example, is further divided into subfield "a" for the place of publication, "b" for the name of the publisher, and "c" for the date of publication.

===Record structure===

MARC records are typically stored and transmitted as binary files, usually with several MARC records concatenated together into a single file.  MARC uses the [[ISO 2709]] standard to define the structure of each record.  This includes a marker to indicate where each record begins and ends, as well as a set of characters at the beginning of each record that provide a directory for locating the fields and subfields within the record.

In 2002, the Library of Congress developed the MARCXML schema as an alternative record structure, allowing MARC records to be represented in [[XML]]; the fields remain the same, but those fields are expressed in the record in XML [[Markup language|markup]]. Libraries typically expose their records as MARCXML via a [[web service]], often following the [[Search/Retrieve via URL|SRU]] or [[OAI-PMH]] standards.

===Content===

MARC encodes information about a bibliographic item, not about the content of that item; this means it is a [[metadata]] transmission standard, not a content standard. The actual content that a cataloger places in each MARC field is usually governed and defined by standards outside of MARC, except for a handful of fixed fields defined by the MARC standards themselves. [[Resource Description and Access]], for example, defines how the physical characteristics of books and other items should be expressed. The [[Library of Congress Subject Headings]] (LCSH) are a list of authorized subject terms used to describe the main subject content of the work. Other cataloging rules and classification schedules can also be used.

==MARC formats==
{| class="wikitable"
|+MARC formats
!Name
!Description
|-
|[[Authority record]]s
|provide information about individual names, subjects, and [[uniform title]]s. An authority record establishes an authorized form of each heading, with references as appropriate from other forms of the heading.
|-
|Bibliographic records
|describe the intellectual and physical characteristics of bibliographic resources (books, sound recordings, video recordings, and so forth).
|-
|Classification records
|MARC records containing classification data. For example, the Library of Congress Classification has been encoded using the MARC 21 Classification format.
|-
|Community Information records
|MARC records describing a service-providing agency, such as a local [[homeless shelter]] or tax assistance provider.
|-
|Holdings records
|provide copy-specific information on a library resource (call number, shelf location, volumes held, and so forth).
|}

===MARC 21===

MARC 21 was designed to redefine the original MARC record format for the 21st century and to make it more accessible to the international community. MARC 21 has formats for the following five types of data: Bibliographic Format, Authority Format, Holdings Format, Community Format, and Classification Data Format.&lt;ref name="Joudrey and Taylor, p. 262" /&gt; Currently MARC 21 has been implemented successfully by The [[British Library]], the European Institutions and the major library institutions in the United States, and [[Canada]].

MARC 21 is a result of the combination of the United States and Canadian MARC formats (USMARC and CAN/MARC). MARC21 is based on the [[National Information Standards Organization| NISO]]/[[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standard [[Z39.2]], which allows users of different software products to communicate with each other and to exchange data.&lt;ref name="Joudrey and Taylor, p. 262" &gt;[[#Joudrey and Taylor, Organization of Information|Joudrey and Taylor, Organization of Information]], p. 262&lt;/ref&gt;

MARC 21 allows the use of two [[Character encoding|character sets]], either [[MARC-8]] or [[Unicode]] encoded as [[UTF-8]]. MARC-8 is based on [[ISO 2022]] and allows the use of Hebrew, Cyrillic, Arabic, Greek, and East Asian scripts. MARC 21 in UTF-8 format allows all the languages supported by Unicode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/marc/specifications/speccharmarc8.html|title=Character Sets:  MARC-8 Encoding Environment: MARC 21 Specifications for Record Structure, Character Sets, and Exchange Media (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MARCXML===
MARCXML  is an [[XML]] [[XML schema|schema]] based on the common [[MARC21]] standards.&lt;ref name = "marcxml"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/ |title=MARC 21 XML Schema |publisher= Library of Congress |date= |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MARCXML was developed by the [[Library of Congress]] and adopted by it and others as a means of facilitating the sharing of, and networked access to, bibliographic information.&lt;ref name = "marcxml"/&gt; Being easy to parse by various systems allows it to be used as an aggregation format, as it is in software packages such as [[MetaLib]], though that package merges it into a wider [[Document Type Definition|DTD]] specification.

The MARCXML primary design goals included:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/standards/marcxml/marcxml-design.html |title=MARC XML Design Considerations |publisher=Loc.gov |date=2004-12-30 |accessdate=2013-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Simplicity of the schema	
* Flexibility and extensibility
* Lossless and reversible conversion from MARC
* Data presentation through XML stylesheets
* MARC records updates and data conversions through XML transformations
* Existence of validation tools

==Future==

The future of the MARC formats is a matter of some debate among libraries. On the one hand, the storage formats are quite complex and are based on outdated technology. On the other, there is no alternative bibliographic format with an equivalent degree of granularity. The billions of MARC records in tens of thousands of individual libraries (including over 50,000,000 records belonging to the [[Online Computer Library Center|OCLC consortium]] alone) create inertia. The Library of Congress has launched the [[Bibliographic Framework Initiative]] (BIBFRAME),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bibframe.org/ |title=Bibliographic Framework Initiative |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=2 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which aims at providing a replacement for MARC that provides greater granularity and easier re-use of the data expressed in multiple catalogs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2013-12-11
| date = 2013-11-22
| url = https://www.loc.gov/bibframe/media/updateforum-nov22-2013.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2013, OCLC Research exposed data detailing how various MARC elements have been used by libraries in the 400 million MARC records (as of early 2018) contained in WorldCat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://experimental.worldcat.org/marcusage/|title = MARC Usage in WorldCat|date = 2013|accessdate = April 8, 2015|website = |publisher = OCLC Research|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The MARC formats are managed by the MARC Steering Group, which is advised by the MARC Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/marc/mac/MAC_members.html|title=MARC Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=Library of Congress|access-date=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposals for changes to MARC are submitted to the MARC Advisory Committee and discussed in public at the American Library Association (ALA) Midwinter and ALA Annual meetings.

The term '''Machine Guidance''' is used to describe a wide range of techniques which improve the productivity of agricultural, mining and construction equipment. It is most commonly used to describe systems which incorporate [[GPS]], Motion Measuring Units (MMU) and other devices to provide on-board systems with information about the movement of the machine in either 3, 5 or 7 axis of rotation. Feedback to the operator is provided through audio and visual displays which allows improved control of the machine in relation to the intended or designed direction of travel.

{{About|the urban legend|the film|The Mole People (film)|other uses|Mole Men (disambiguation)}}

'''Mole people''' ('''tunnel people''' or '''tunnel dwellers''') are [[Homelessness|homeless]] people living under large cities in abandoned [[Rapid transit|subway]], [[railroad]], [[Flood tunnel|flood]], [[sewerage|sewage tunnels]], and heating shafts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Tunnel People of Las Vegas|date=3 November 2010|journal=Daily Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Homeless People Go Underground|date=14 December 2010|author=Pat Hartnan|journal=Housethehomeless.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also refer to the [[speculative fiction]] [[Trope (literature)|trope]] of an entirely subterranean society.

==Urban folklore==
While it is generally accepted that some homeless people in large cities make use of abandoned underground structures for shelter, [[urban legends]] persist that make stronger assertions. These include claims that "mole people" have formed small, ordered societies similar to [[tribes]], with members numbering up to the hundreds, living underground year-round. It has also been suggested that they have developed their own cultural traits and even have electricity by illegal hook-up. The subject has attracted some attention from [[sociologists]] but is highly controversial due to a lack of evidence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

[[Jennifer Toth]]'s 1993 book ''The Mole People: Life In The Tunnels Beneath New York City'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Toth |first=Jennifer |authorlink=Jennifer Toth |title=The Mole People: Life in the Tunnels Beneath New York City |year=1993 |publisher=Chicago Review Press, Incorporated |location=Chicago, Illinois |isbn=1-55652-241-X | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H7jfvdtA0hsC&amp;printsec=frontcover}}&lt;/ref&gt; written while she was an intern at the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', was promoted as a true account of travels in the tunnels and interviews with tunnel dwellers. The book helped canonize the image of the mole people as an ordered society living literally under people's feet. However, few claims in her book have been verified, and it includes inaccurate geographical information, numerous factual errors, and an apparent reliance on largely unprovable statements. The strongest criticism came from [[New York City Subway]] historian Joseph Brennan, who declared, "Every fact in this book that I can verify independently is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~brennan/abandoned/mole-people.html |title=Fantasy in ''The Mole People'' |first=Joseph |last=Brennan |year=1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cecil Adams]]'s ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' contacted Toth in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cecil |last=Adams |title=Are there really "Mole People" living under the streets of New York City? |work=The Straight Dope |publisher=Chicago Reader, Inc. |date=2004-01-09 |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040109.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted the large amount of unverifiability in her stories, while declaring that the book's accounts seemed to be truthful. A later article, after contact with Brennan, was more skeptical of Toth's truthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Cecil |last=Adams |title=The Mole People revisited |work=The Straight Dope |publisher=Chicago Reader, Inc. |date=2004-03-05 |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/040305.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other journalists have focused on the underground homeless in [[New York City]] as well. Photographer Margaret Morton made the photo book ''The Tunnel''.&lt;ref name="Morton, Margaret, ‘The Tunnel. The Architecture of Despair’"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morton|first=Margaret|title=The Tunnel.

In 2010, anthropologist [[Teun Voeten]] published ''[[Tunnel People]]''.&lt;ref name="Tunnel People"&gt;{{cite book|last=Voeten|first=Teun|title=Tunnel People|year=2010|publisher=PM press|location=Oakland, CA|isbn=978-1-60486-070-2|pages=320, includes one map and one 16–page b&amp;w photo insert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5RWsvXPDCPYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Tunnel+People%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Tunnel%20People%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media accounts have reported "mole people" living underneath other cities as well. In the [[Las Vegas Valley]], it is estimated about 1,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1326187/Las-Vegas-tunnel-people-How-1-000-people-live-shimmering-strip.html ''The tunnel people of Las Vegas: How 1,000 live in flooded labyrinth under Sin City's shimmering strip''], [[Daily Mail]] November 3, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; homeless people find shelter in the storm drains underneath the city for protection from extreme temperatures that exceed {{convert|115|F|C}} while dropping below {{convert|30|F|C}} in winter. 

According to media reports, the "mole people" living in the tunnels underneath Las Vegas have managed to furnish their "rooms." In one ABC News report from 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smartphonecasinos.co.uk/las-vegas-underground-strip-the-tunnel-people|title=Tunnel People: The Hidden Community Living Under Las Vegas|work=Best UK Online Casino Sites 2018 - Licensed by Gambling Commission|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; a couple, who had been living in the tunnels for five years, had managed to furnish their home with a bed, bookcase and even a make-shift shower. The tunnels are prone to flooding, which can be extremely dangerous for the tunnel's residents. Most lose their belongings regularly, and there have even been some reported deaths. 

Most of the inhabitants are turned away from the limited charities in Las Vegas and find shelter in the industrial infrastructure of the Las Vegas Strip, similar to most cities. The Las Vegas Channel 8 News sent their Eyewitness News I-Team with Matt O'Brien, the local author who spent nearly five years exploring life beneath the city to write the book ''[[Beneath the Neon]].'' O'Brien also founded the Shine A Light Foundation to help the homeless people taking refuge in the tunnels. The charity helps tunnel residents by providing supplies, such as underwear, bottled water and food. 

According to the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, the valley has about {{convert|450|mi|km}} of flood control channels and tunnels, and about {{convert|300|mi|km}} of those are underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=I-Team: 'Beneath the Neon' -- Underground Las Vegas|work=8newsnow |url=http://www.8newsnow.com/story/6453397/i-team-beneath-the-neon-underground-las-vegas.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 24, 2009, article in the British paper ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' interviewed some of the inhabitants of the Las Vegas Valley mole people, and included photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Samson |title=Lost Vegas: The People Living in the Drains Below Las Vegas|work=The Sun |date=2009-09-24|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/2651937/The-people-living-in-drains-below-Las-Vegas.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stock character version==
There are three distinct [[stock character]] version of mole people:

* The first and most famous example of "mole people" are the [[Morlock]]s, who appear in [[H.G. Wells]]'s 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]''.
*Conceptually linked to the Morlocks are socially isolated, often oppressed and sometimes forgotten subterranean societies, most often seen in science fiction. Examples include ''[[Demolition Man (film)|Demolition Man]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'' (in the form of "Sewer [[Mutant (fictional)|Mutants]]"), ''[[C.H.U.D.]]'',  and ''[[The Matrix]]''. 
* Another version is literally a race of humanoid [[Mole (animal)|moles]]. Examples include ''[[The Mole People (film)|The Mole People]]'' (1956), ''[[Underdog (TV series)|Underdog]]'', ''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]'', ''[[ThunderCats (1985 TV series)|ThunderCats]]'', and ''[[Johnny Test]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mole Men | website=TV Tropes | url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/MoleMen | accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Marvel Comics]], two very different underground "mole people" societies exist: the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], a society of [[mutants (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] outcasts, named after the subterranean race from H.G. Wells' novel, that live in the abandoned tunnels and sewers beneath [[New York City]]; and the inhabitants of [[Subterranea (comics)|Subterranea]], a fictional cavernous realm far beneath the Earth's surface where various species of subterranean humanoids exist. The [[Moloids]] (or Mole People) are the inhabitants of Subterranea most commonly depicted in the comics. Moloids usually serve as soldiers for the [[Mole Man]], a human from the surface world who discovered Subterranea and subsequently became ruler of the Moloids. Mole Man is frequently an antagonist of the [[Fantastic Four]].

{{Expert-subject|France|date=February 2009}}
{{Wiktionary|pays}}
In [[France]], a '''''pays''''' ({{IPA-fr|pɛ.i|lang|Fr-pays.ogg}}) is an area whose inhabitants share common geographical, economic, cultural, or social interests, who have a right to enter into communal planning contracts under a [[law]] known as the Loi Pasqua or LOADT (''Loi d'Orientation pour l'Aménagement et le Développement du Territoire''; {{lang-en|Directive law concerning territorial planning and development}}), which took effect on February 4, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Assessment &amp; Decision Making for Sustainable Transport|author=European Conference of Ministers of Transport|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2004|ISBN=92-821-1311-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was augmented on June 25, 1999, by the Loi Voynet or LOADDT (''Loi d'Orientation de l'Aménagement Durable du Territoire'').  The LOADDT enables the citizens of a community to form a legally recognized ''pays'' after deciding to do so by mutual consent; its aim is to help bring the inhabitants of urban and neighboring rural districts into dialogue and agreement.

The Council of Development in each ''pays'' assembles together the elected officials and the economic, social, and cultural actors, and their associates, into a deliberative forum to discuss the development policies which should be followed by the community.  While the Council can give advice, submit proposals, and monitor development projects, it does not have the authority to make official decisions.

The Charter of the ''Pays'' makes it possible to fix the stakes and the objectives of the community. Few structures are recognized as ''pays Voynet'', meaning nationwide, because the recognition criteria are sometimes far from what the ''pays'' are. Then again, several ''pays'' are recognized by the Commission Régionale d'aménagement et de développement du Territoire.

The Contract of the ''Pays'' can be signed among the members of the ''pays'', or between the ''pays'' and its surrounding area, the [[Département|department]], the [[Région in France|region]], or with the national state when the stakes are well-identified.

In this context, the [[French language|French]] term ''pays'' is not used in the modern sense of "[[country]]"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} but preserves the original meaning of the [[Latin]] word from which it was derived, ''[[pagus]]'', which designated the territory controlled by a [[medieval]] [[count]].  The majority of ''pays'' are roughly coextensive with the old counties (e.g., county of [[Comminges]], county of [[Ponthieu]], etc.). Today ''Pays de France'' still refers to a tiny area in northwest [[Île-de-France (region)|Ile-de-France]], hence city names such as ''Roissy-en-France'' or ''Tremblay-en-France''.

==''Pays'' of Brittany==
[[Brittany]], consisting of 4 departments, is also subdivided into 21 ''pays''.

[[Image:Vluchtheuvel.jpg|thumb|right|Refuge island without traffic lights]]
[[File:Allen-Delancey Mall jeh.JPG|thumb|right|Wide refuge island]]
A '''refuge island''', also known as a '''pedestrian refuge''', '''pedestrian island''' and colloquially as a "pork chop" island, is a small section of [[pavement (material)|pavement]] or [[sidewalk]], completely surrounded by [[asphalt]] or other road materials, where [[pedestrian]]s can stop before finishing crossing a [[road]]. It is typically used when a street is very wide, as the [[pedestrian crossing]] can be too long for some individuals to cross in one [[traffic light]] cycle, they can often been seen on roads with higher speed limits also. In the UK Refuge Islands re commonly illuminated by a white 300mm beacon mounted on a 5m grey pole with white reflective bands. &lt;ref&gt; TSRGD-2016 regulations page 440.https://tsrgd.co.uk/documents/traffic-signs-regulations-and-general-directions &lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 a solar powered version of the Refuge Beacon was introduced  requiring no mains cabling and incorporating the energy saving technology cited in patent GB2519445 &lt;ref&gt; Solar Power Refuge Beacon Patent No: GB2519445 - owner Ticknall Solar Ltd &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Solar Powered Refuge Beacon.jpg|thumb|left|Solar Powered Refuge Beacon]]
It is also often used when no light exists, and pedestrians need safe harbour after managing one direction of traffic, before taking on the next. This significantly improves the amenity for pedestrians trying to cross busy streets, as they are much more likely to find two small gaps in traffic rather than one situation in which gaps for both directions coincide. Since this reduces their average waiting time, it also improves safety - with impatient pedestrians less likely to use gaps that turn out to be too short for safe crossing.&lt;ref&gt;''Pedestrian planning and design guide'' - Land Transport New Zealand, 2007, Page 6-16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gilles Robert de Vaugondy''' (1688–1766), also known as Le [[Sieur]] or Monsieur Robert, and his son, [[Didier Robert de Vaugondy]] (c.1723–1786), were leading [[cartography|cartographers]] in [[France]] during the 18th century.

==Life==
[[File:1784 Vaugondy Map of the World on Mercator Projection - Geographicus - World-vaugondy-1784.jpg|thumb|left|1784 map on a Mercator projection by Robert de Vaugondy: Whites/Blancs (green), Browns/Bruns (red), Yellows/Jaunâtres (yellow), Olives/Olivâtres/ (light green).]]
In 1757, Gilles and Didier Robert De Vaugondy published ''The Atlas Universel'', one of the most important [[atlas]]es of the 18th century. To produce the atlas, the Vaugondys integrated older sources with more modern surveyed maps. They verified and corrected the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of many regional maps in the atlas with [[astronomical observation]]s. The older material was revised with the addition of many new place names. In 1760, Didier Robert de Vaugondy was appointed geographer to [[Louis XV]].

Gilles and Didier Robert De Vaugondy produced their maps and terrestrial globes working together as father and son. Globes of a variety of sizes were made by gluing copperplate-printed gores on a plaster-finished papier-mache core, a complicated and expensive manufacturing process, employing several specialists. In some cases it is uncertain whether Gilles or Didier made a given map. Gilles often signed maps as "M.Robert", while Didier commonly signed his maps as "Robert de Vaugondy", or added "fils" or "filio" after his name.

The Robert de Vaugondys were descended from the [[Nicolas Sanson]] family through Sanson's grandson, Pierre Moulard-Sanson. From him, they inherited much of Sanson's cartographic material, which they combined with maps and plates acquired after Hubert Jaillot's death in 1712 to form the basis the ''Atlas Universel''. Sources from the [[Dépôt de la Marine]], the official French repository for maritime-related information, were used for their maps of Canada and South America.

Like [[Abraham Ortelius|Ortelius]] and [[Gerardus Mercator|Mercator]], the Vaugondy's credited their sources, which has greatly benefited the study of the history of cartography during that period.

A '''scroll plain''' occurs where a river [[meander]]s across an area with a very low gradient, usually with a fairly continuous discharge. In addition to meanders, scroll plains are also characterised by many [[oxbow lake]]s.

==Examples of scroll plains==
===New Zealand===
The upper reaches of the [[Taieri River]] form a stunning scroll plain near [[Paerau]] (pictures:[https://web.archive.org/web/20050924190735/http://www.business.otago.ac.nz/SIRC/taieri/cpics/gallery11.htm] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070310220311/http://www.maf.govt.nz/mafnet/publications/rmupdate/rm14/rm14-06.gif] [http://data.gns.cri.nz/geoatlas/image.jsp?id=48407]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="795">'''Sebago to the Sea Trail''' is a trail that goes from [[Lake Sebago]] to the [[Gulf of Maine]]. It was created in 2007 in order to create an eventual 28 mile trail to the sea. The trail runs through the towns of [[Falmouth, Maine|Falmouth]], [[Windham, Maine|Windham]], [[Standish, Maine|Standish]], and [[Gorham, Maine|Gorham]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4997">In Australia the predominant term used for SOEs is '''government business enterprise''' (GBE). Various [[States and territories of Australia|Australian states]] also have GBEs, especially with respect to the provision of water and sewerage, and many state-based GBEs were privatized in some states during the last decade of the twentieth century. Former Commonwealth SOEs include [[Telstra]], established in the 1970s as [[Telecom Australia]]. Telstra, now Australia's leading telecommunications company, was privatized in 1997 by the government of [[John Howard]]. As of June 2010 Telstra owned a majority of the copper wire infrastructure in Australia (the rest is owned by [[Optus]]) and is pending sale to its former parent, the Australian government, for a non-binding amount of 11 billion Australian dollars, as ducts in the copper wire tunnels are needed to install the fiber optic cable. The [[Commonwealth Bank]], as its name indicates, was also founded as public company before later being privatized.

In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] many GBEs were sold in the 1990s to reduce the state's level of debt. The [[State Electricity Commission of Victoria]] and the [[Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria|Gas and Fuel Corporation]] were the best-known government enterprises to be disaggregated and sold.

'''Yardangs''' are common in some regions on Mars, especially in the [[Medusae Fossae Formation]]. This formation is found in the [[Amazonis quadrangle]] and near the equator.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979JGR....84.8147W SAO/NASA ADS Astronomy Abstract Service: Yardangs on Mars], Journal of Geophysical Research Vol. 84, Issue B14, 30 December 1979. https://doi.org/10.1029/JB084iB14p08147 &lt;/ref&gt;  They are formed by the action of wind on sand sized particles; hence they often point in the prevailing direction that the winds were blowing when they were formed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esa.int/Our_Activities/Space_Science/Mars_Express/Yardangs_on_Mars Yardangs on Mars], ESA Mars Express, 23 Jul 2004&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.esa.int/var/esa/storage/images/esa_multimedia/images/2004/07/yardangs_on_the_surface_of_mars/10312091-3-eng-GB/Yardangs_on_the_surface_of_Mars.jpg ESA High-resolution image, Yardangs on Mars near Olympus Mons on Mars], image taken by the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) on board the ESA [[Mars Express]] spacecraft. &lt;/ref&gt; Because they exhibit very few impact craters they are believed to be relatively young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020416a  THEMIS image of Medusae Fossae Formation], ASU, 2002-04-16 &lt;/ref&gt;  The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles, and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or [[volcanic ash]]. Yardangs are parts of rock that have been sand blasted into long, skinny ridges by bouncing sand particles blowing in the wind.&lt;ref name=H1703&gt;[http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039563_1730 Yardangs in Arsinoes Chaos] University of Arizona HiRISE Operations, 04 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_039563_1730&lt;/ref&gt; Layers are seen in parts of the formation.

The '''Yucatán Channel''' or '''Straits of Yucatán''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Canal de Yucatán'') is a [[strait]] between [[Mexico]] and [[Cuba]]. It connects the [[Yucatán Basin]] of the [[Caribbean Sea]] with the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. It is just over {{convert|200|km}} wide and nearly {{convert|2800|m}} deep at its deepest point near the coast of Cuba.

==Currents==

The Yucatán Channel separates Cuba from Mexico and links the Caribbean Sea with the Gulf of Mexico. The strait is {{convert|217|km|mi}} across between [[Cape Catoche]] in Mexico and [[Cape San Antonio, Cuba|Cape San Antonio]] in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/654543/Yucatan-Channel Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt; It has a maximum depth near the Cuban coast of {{convert|2,779|m}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Yucatan+Strait Free Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; Water flows through the Caribbean Sea from east to west. This flow consists of 5 [[Sverdrup|Sv]] of water from the [[North Equatorial Current]] flowing through the [[Windward Passage]] and 12 Sv of water from the [[South Equatorial Current]] which flows along the coast of Brazil. The total flow is about 17 Sv at a temperature of at least 17&amp;nbsp;°C. When this water flows past the Yucatán Peninsula it becomes the Yucatán Current.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/caribbean/caribbean.html |title=The Caribbean Current |author1=Gyory, Joanna |author2=Mariano, Arthur J. |author3=Ryan, Edward H. |work=Ocean surface currents |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This current provides most of the inflow of water into the Gulf of Mexico as the amount of water entering by the [[Straits of Florida]] is small and intermittent.&lt;ref name=Gyory/&gt; The Yucatán Current flows strongly on the western side of the channel while the Cuban Countercurrent flows in the opposite direction on the easterly side of the channel. Underneath the Yucatán Current there is a southward-flowing Yucatán Undercurrent which takes water away from the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name=Gyory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oceancurrents.rsmas.miami.edu/caribbean/yucatan.html |title=The Yucatan Current |author1=Gyory, Joanna |author2=Mariano, Arthur J. |author3=Ryan, Edward H. |work=Ocean surface currents |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coral reefs==
As the water flowing through the Yucatán Channel enter the Gulf of Mexico, it passes over the [[Campeche Bank]], a shallow area of sea. Here there are [[coral reef]]s on the outer fringes of the Yucatán shelf about {{convert|100|km}} offshore. The main reef-building corals here are ''[[Acropora cervicornis]]'', ''[[Acropora palmata]]'' and ''[[Montastraea annularis]]'' and in the late 1990s many of these died. Some recolonisation has since taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Latin American Coral Reefs |last=Cortés |first=J. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=Gulf Professional Publishing |isbn=9780080535395 |pages=134–147 |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=LLlwoNsqxi0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Yucat%C3%A1n+Channel+fish&amp;ots=41X8vfzRqF&amp;sig=QtF0Fm3gccwEf4ekLo3rEUL4bP8#v=onepage&amp;q=Yucat%C3%A1n%20Channel%20fish&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Campeche Bank is a biodiverse area and it and other parts of the Yucatán Channel are heavily fished by artisan fishermen who converge on the area from along the coast of Mexico. The area is threatened by over exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wri.org/publication/content/7893 |title=Mexico |author=Jord, E. |work=Reefs at Risk in the Caribbean |publisher=World Resources Institute |accessdate=2013-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zero Mile Stone''' ({{lang-mr|शून्य मैलाचा दगड}}) is a monument built by [[British Raj|British]] during [[Great Trigonometrical Survey]] of [[India]] in 1907 in [[Nagpur]], [[Maharashtra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image of Inscription at Zero Mile Monument|url=https://www.tripadvisor.in/SavedPhotos-g2365349-i289433083-Nagpur_Nagpur_District_Maharashtra.html|website=TripAdvisor|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ganesan|first1=P|title=A method of transferring G.T.S. benchmark value to survey area using electronic total station|journal=NIO Technical Report|date=2007-12-01|issue=2007/04|url=http://drs.nio.org/drs/handle/2264/1028|accessdate=7 December 2017|publisher=National Institute of Oceanography|location=Vishakapatnam, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zero Mile Stone consists of a pillar made up of sandstone and another small stone representing the GTS Standard Bench Mark, and four stucco horses that were added later. The height of the top of the pillar is 1020.171 feet above mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image of Inscription at Zero Mile Monument|url=https://www.tripadvisor.in/SavedPhotos-g2365349-i289433083-Nagpur_Nagpur_District_Maharashtra.html|website=TripAdvisor|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[The Times of India]] undertook to maintain the monument for the next 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://photogallery.indiatimes.com/events/nagpur/zero-mile-stone/articleshow/3048476.cms|title=Zero miles stone|publisher=[[The Times of India]]|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to the popular belief, there is no verifiable evidence that it is a monument locating the geographical centre of [[colonial India]] in the city of Nagpur, Maharashtra,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/marathi/mahInfo/nagpur.php |title=Zero Mile |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816130049/http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/marathi/mahInfo/nagpur.php |archivedate=16 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or that the Zero Mile Stone was erected by the British to use this point to measure all the distances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hindu.com/2001/08/25/stories/13251106.htm|title=Zero miles stone|author=G.
