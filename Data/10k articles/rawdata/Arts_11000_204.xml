'''Fashion in the years 1750–1775''' in European countries and the colonial Americas was characterised by greater abundance, elaboration and intricacy in clothing designs, loved by the [[Rococo]] artistic trends of the period. The French and English styles of fashion were very different from one another. French style was defined by elaborate court dress, colourful and rich in decoration, worn by such iconic fashion figures as [[Marie Antoinette]].

After reaching their maximum size in the 1750s, [[hoop skirt]]s began to reduce in size, but remained being worn with the most formal dresses, and were sometimes replaced with side-hoops, or [[Pannier (clothing)|pannier]]s.&lt;ref name=methoop&gt;"Panniers [British] (1973.65.2)". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000–. http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1973.65.2 (October 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Hairstyles were equally elaborate, with tall headdresses the distinctive fashion of the 1770s. For men, [[waistcoat]]s and [[breeches]] of previous decades continued to be fashionable.

English style was defined by simple practical garments, made of inexpensive and durable fabrics, catering to a leisurely outdoor lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"&gt;Ribeiro, Aileen: ''The Art of Dress: Fashion in England and France 1750–1820'', Yale University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0300062877}}&lt;/ref&gt; These lifestyles were also portrayed through the differences in portraiture. The French preferred indoor scenes where they could demonstrate their affinity for luxury in dress and lifestyle. The English, on the other hand, were more "egalitarian" in tastes, thus their portraits tended to depict the sitter in outdoor scenes and pastoral attire.&lt;ref&gt;Ribeiro. ''The Art of Dress''. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women's fashion ==

=== Overview ===
[[File:Jean-Marc Nattier 003.jpg|right|thumb|[[Princess Henriette of France]] in court dress playing the [[viola de gamba]], {{circa|1750–52}}, by [[Jean-Marc Nattier]]]]
[[File:Batoni lady mary fox.jpg|right|thumb|Lady Mary Fox wears a grey silk hooded Brunswick gown with striped ribbon ornaments, 1767]]
Women's clothing styles retained the emphasis on a narrow, inverted conical torso, achieved with boned stays, above full skirts. [[Hoop skirt]]s continued to be worn, reaching their largest size in the 1750s, and were sometimes replaced by side-hoops, also called 'false hips', or [[Pannier (clothing)|panniers]].&lt;ref name=methoop/&gt; Court dress had little or no physical comfort with restriction of movement. Full size hoops skirts prevented sitting and reminded those wearing them to stand in the presence of the King. Stays forced a proper standing posture. Garments like these could not be washed often because of the fabrics from which they were made. The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] produced a backlash against [[sumptuary law]]s which asserted a stagnant social hierarchy. During the Enlightenment, court dress stayed almost the same while outside of court dress, fashion became less extravagant and shifted more towards comfort rather than courtly display.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, ''The Appearance of Enlightenment''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gowns ===
The usual fashion of the years 1750–1775 was a low-necked [[gown]] (usually called a {{lang|fr|robe}}), worn over a petticoat. Most gowns had skirts that opened in front to show the petticoat worn beneath. If the bodice of the gown was open in front, the opening was filled in with a decorative [[stomacher]], pinned to the gown over the laces or to the stays beneath.

Close-fitting sleeves just past the elbow were trimmed with frills or ruffles, and separate under-ruffles referred to as [[engageante]]s in modern terms, of lace or fine linen were [[tack (sewing)|tacked]], to the inside of the gown's sleeves,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fineartlib.info/gallery/p17_sectionid/10/p17_imageid/899|title=Mrs. Richard Skinner :: John Singleton Copley - 4 women's portraits 18th century hall|website=www.fineartlib.info|access-date=2018-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; or perhaps to the [[chemise|shift or chemise]] sleeves. The neckline was trimmed with a fabric or lace ruffle, or a neckerchief called a "[[fichu]]" could be tucked into the low neckline. Women would also sometimes wear a neckerchief or a more formal lace modesty piece, particularly on low-cut dresses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashionencyclopedia.com/fashion_costume_culture/European-Culture-18th-Century/Eighteenth-Century-Clothing.html|title=Eighteenth-Century Clothing|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{lang|fr|robe à la française}} or [[sack-back gown]] featured back pleats hanging loosely from the neckline. A fitted bodice held the front of the gown closely to the figure.

The {{lang|fr|robe à l'anglaise}} or [[close-bodied gown]] featured back pleats sewn in place to fit closely to the body, and then released into the skirt which would be draped in various ways.

The [[Brunswick (clothing)|Brunswick]] dress was a two-piece costume of German origin consisting of a hip-length jacket with "split sleeves"—flounced elbow-length sleeves and long, tight lower sleeves—and a hood, worn with a matching petticoat. It was popular for traveling.

Court dress, the {{lang|fr|grand habit de cour}} or "stiff-bodied" gown, retained the styles of the 1670s. It featured a low, oval neckline that bared the shoulders, and the heavily boned bodice laced closed in back, unlike the front-opening robe. The elbow-length sleeves were covered with tiers of lace flounces, echoing the full-sleeved chemise worn with the original style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Waugh|first=Norah|title=The Cut of Women's Clothes: 1600–1930|year=1968|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=0878300260|pages=66–67, 69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Front-wrapping thigh-length "shortgowns" or [[bedgown]]s of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear, worn with petticoats. Over time, bedgowns became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear.&lt;ref&gt;Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', pp. 116–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in previous periods, the traditional [[riding habit]] consisted of a tailored jacket like a man's coat, worn with a high-necked shirt, a waistcoat, a petticoat, and a hat. Alternatively, the jacket and a false waistcoat-front might be a made as a single garment, and later in the period a simpler riding jacket and petticoat—without waistcoat—could be worn.

=== Underwear ===
The shift, [[chemise]] (in France), or smock, had a low neckline and elbow-length sleeves which were full early in the period and became increasingly narrow as the century progressed. [[Undergarment|Drawers]] were not worn in this period.

The long-waisted, heavily boned "stays" of the [[1700–1750 in fashion|early 1740s]] with their narrow back, wide front, and shoulder straps gave way by the 1760s to strapless stays which still were cut high at the armpit, to encourage a woman to stand with her shoulders slightly back, a fashionable posture. The fashionable shape was a rather conical torso, with large hips. The waist was not particularly small. Stays were laced snugly, but comfortably. They offered back support for heavy lifting, and poor and middle class women were able to work comfortably in them.

Free-hanging pockets were tied around the waist and were accessed through "pocket slits" in the side-seams of the gown or petticoat.

Woollen or quilted waistcoats were worn over the stays and under the gown for warmth, as were petticoats quilted with wool batting, especially in the cold climates of northern Europe and America. In the 1770s stays began to be produced so they would end higher on a woman's body. Phillip Vicker complained: "For the late importation of Stays which are said to be now most fashionable in London, are produced upwards so high that we can have scarce any view at all of the Ladies Snowy Bosoms..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makinghistorynow.com/2016/01/musings-from-the-millinery-revealing-the-truth-about-18th-century-womens-necklines/|title=Musings from the millinery: revealing the truth about 18th-century women's necklines|website=Making History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Woman's yellow silk shoes 1760s.jpg|thumb|Woman's yellow silk shoe to be worn with shoe buckle, {{circa|1760–65}}]]

=== Shoes ===
Shoes had high, curved heels—the origin of modern "louis heels"—and were made of fabric or leather, with separate [[shoe buckle]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Tortora &amp; Eubank 1995, p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; These were either shiny metal, usually in silver—sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style—or with paste stones, although there were other types.

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
By the 1770s extreme hairstyles and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] had come into fashion. Women wore their hair high upon their heads, in large plumes. To create tall extreme hair, rolls of horse hair, tow, or wool were used to raise up the front of the hair. The front of the hair was then frizzed out, or arranged in roll curls and set horizontally on the head. Women turned their hair up in the back often in a knot. In addition, pomatum and false hair was used to give more height to the hair. Pomatum was paste that women used to stiffen their hair. Pomatum was also used to hold powder, which women put in their hair. The Pomatum was made of many ingredients including hog's grease, tallow, or a mix of beef marrow and oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Courtais|first=Georgine de|title=Women's hats, headdresses, and hairstyles: with 453 illustrations, medieval to modern|date=2006|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Mineola, N.Y.|isbn=0486448509|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

=== Overview ===
Throughout the period, men continued to wear the [[coat (clothing)|coat]], [[waistcoat]] and [[breeches]] of the [[1700–1750 in fashion|previous period]]. However, changes were seen in both the fabric used as well as the cut of these garments. More attention was paid to individual pieces of the suit, and each element underwent stylistic changes.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt; Under new enthusiasms for outdoor sports and country pursuits, the elaborately [[embroider]]ed silks and velvets characteristic of "full dress" or formal attire earlier in the century gradually gave way to carefully [[tailor]]ed woollen "undress" garments for all occasions except the most formal. This more casual style reflected the dominating image of "nonchalance." The goal was to look as fashionable as possible with seemingly little effort. This was to be the new, predominant mindset of fashion.

=== Coats ===
The skirts of the coat narrowed from the gored styles of the previous period. Waistcoats extended to mid-thigh to the 1770s and then began to shorten. Waistcoats could be made with or without sleeves.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

As in the previous period, a loose, T-shaped silk, cotton or linen gown called a [[banyan (clothing)|banyan]] was worn at home as a sort of dressing gown over the shirt, waistcoat, and breeches. Men of an intellectual or philosophical bent were painted wearing banyans, with their own hair or a soft cap rather than a wig.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franklin and Friends|accessdate=2006-03-19|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/franklin/rush.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A coat with a wide collar called a [[frock coat]], derived from a traditional working-class coat, was worn for hunting and other country pursuits in both Britain and America.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

=== Shirt and stock ===
[[Shirt]] sleeves were full, gathered at the wrist and dropped shoulder. Full-dress shirts had ruffles of fine fabric or lace, while undress shirts ended in plain wrist bands.&lt;ref name="Ribeiro, Aileen 1820"/&gt;

=== Breeches, shoes, and stockings ===
Knee-length breeches fitted snugly and had a fall-front opening.

Low-heeled leather [[shoe]]s fastened with [[shoe buckle|buckles]] were worn with silk or woollen [[stocking]]s. [[Boot]]s were worn for riding. The buckles were either polished metal, usually in silver—sometimes with the metal cut into false stones in the Paris style—or with paste stones, although there were other types. These buckles were often quite large and one of the world's largest collections can be seen at [[Kenwood House]].

=== Hairstyles and headgear ===
Wigs were worn for formal occasions, or the hair was worn long and powdered, brushed back from the forehead and "clubbed" (tied back at the nape of the neck) with a black ribbon. Wigs were generally now short, but long wigs continued to be popular with the older generation. Wigs were made with a lot of white powder.

Wide-brimmed hats turned up on three sides called "cocked hats"—called [[tricorne|tricorns]] in later eras—were worn in mid-century.{{-|left}}

=== The macaroni ===
{{main|Macaroni (fashion)}}
[[File:Philip Dawe, The Macaroni. A Real Character at the Late Masquerade (1773).jpg|thumb|1773 caricature of the exaggerated style of the macaroni]]
The trend of the macaroni grew out of the tradition of those who partook of the [[Grand Tour]]. Elite men in the 18th century would travel abroad across Europe, namely Italy, to broaden their cultural depth. These men adopted foreign fashions and tastes and brought them back to England where they interpreted them further.&lt;ref&gt;Amelia Rauser, ''Hair, Authenticity, The Self Made Macaroni'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, Fall 2004) p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; The original macaroni of the 1760s was characterized by elaborate dress consisting of short and tight trousers, large wigs, delicate shoes and small hats.&lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; As the general population of English males became exposed to the luxurious appeal of the macaroni trend, they began to adopt and replicate the trends they saw. By the 1770s, any man could appear as if they themselves had been on the Grand Tour-based solely on their outward appearance.

The macaroni and the subsequent imitators were criticized for being [[Androgyny|gender ambiguous]] and [[effeminacy|effeminate]].&lt;ref&gt;S. West, ''The Darly Macaroni Prints and the Politics of the Private Man'', Duke University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Frequently, the macaroni fashion trend was the subject of satirical caricatures and pamphlets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chenoune|first=Farid|title=A History of Men's Fashion|date=1993|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=9782080135360}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their large costume like wigs and short coats, which deeply contrasted the masculine British dress of the time, were ridiculed for their frivolity and were said to be threatening the stability of gender difference, thereby undermining the nation's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Rauser 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The question of farce and inauthenticity comes into play as well because by dressing as a macaroni, one claimed the status and the means of an elite who went on the Grand Tour.

Although many mocked the macaroni for their outwardly eccentric characteristics, some celebrated them for their commitment to the demonstration of personal identity. The idea of a unique character was becoming an important concept that spanned many types of media including books and prints as Britain wanted to distinguish itself from France.&lt;ref&gt;West, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Children's fashion ==
During most of this period, the clothes worn by middle- and upper-class children older than toddlers continued to be similar to the clothes worn by adults, with the exception that girls wore back-fastening bodices and petticoats rather than open-fronted robes. Boys wore dresses until they were [[breeching (boys)|breeched]].

== Working class clothing ==

[[File:John Collet The Elopement detail.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|A working-class woman wears a short dress or [[bedgown]], a patched and mended petticoat, and neckerchief (England, {{circa|1764}})]]
Working-class people in 18th century England and the United States often wore the same garments as fashionable people—shirts, waistcoats, coats and breeches for men, and shifts, petticoats, and dresses or jackets for women—but they owned fewer clothes and what they did own was made of cheaper and sturdier fabrics. Working class men also wore short jackets, and some, especially sailors, wore trousers rather than breeches. [[Smock-frock]]s were a regional style for men, especially shepherds. Country women wore short hooded cloaks, most often red. Both sexes wore handkerchiefs or neckerchiefs.&lt;ref name="Styles"&gt;Styles, ''The Dress of the People'', pp. 32–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reveal"&gt;Baumgarten, ''What Clothes Reveal'', pp. 106–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Men's felt hats were worn with the brims flat rather than cocked or turned up. Men and women wore shoes with shoe buckles—when they could afford them. Men who worked with horses wore boots.&lt;ref name="Styles" /&gt;

The cinema releases of 1935 were highly representative of the [[Classical Hollywood cinema#The golden age|early Golden Age]] period of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]]. This period was punctuated by performances from [[Judy Garland]], [[Clark Gable]] and [[Shirley Temple]]. A significant number of productions also originated in the UK film industry. It was also a period notable in Soviet Russia for the increasing amount of state control exercised over their film industry.

==Events==
* February 23 - [[Gene Autry]] stars as himself as the Singing Cowboy in the serial ''[[The Phantom Empire]]''.  He would later be voted the number one [[Western (genre)|Western]] star from 1937 to 1942.
* February 27 - Seven-year-old [[Shirley Temple]] wins the first special [[Academy Juvenile Award]].
* March - The [[Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment]] is started in order to educate the [[Bantu peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Notcutt, L. A. |author2=Latham, G. C. |title=The African and the Cinema: An Account of the Work of the Bantu Educational Cinema Experiment during the Period March 1935 to May 1937|location=London|publisher=Edinburgh House Press|year=1937}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* May - Formation of [[Republic Pictures]] following merger of smaller companies including [[Monogram Pictures]], [[Mascot Pictures]], [[Liberty Pictures]] and [[Majestic Pictures]].
* May 31 - [[Fox Film]] and [[Twentieth Century Pictures]] merge to form [[20th Century Fox]].

* November 30 - The [[List of British films of 1935|British]]-made film ''[[Scrooge (1935 film)|Scrooge]]'', the first all-talking film version of [[Charles Dickens]]' novel ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', opens in the U.S. after its U.K. release on November 26. [[Seymour Hicks]] plays [[Ebenezer Scrooge]], a role he has played onstage hundreds of times. The film is criticized by some for not showing all of the ghosts physically, and quickly fades into obscurity. Widespread interest does not surface until the film is shown on [[television]] in the 1980s, in very shabby-looking prints. It is eventually restored on [[DVD]].

'''''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul''''' ({{lang-de|'''Angst essen Seele auf'''|lit=Fear Eat Soul Up}}) is a 1974 [[West German film]] written and directed by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], starring [[Brigitte Mira]] and [[El Hedi ben Salem]]. The film won the [[International Federation of Film Critics]] award for best in-competition movie and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1974 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2216/year/1974.html |title=Festival de Cannes: ''Ali: Fear Eats the Soul'' |accessdate=2009-04-26|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be one of Fassbinder's most powerful works and is hailed by many as a masterpiece.

The film revolves around the romance that develops between Emmi, an elderly German woman and Ali, a Moroccan migrant worker in post-[[World War II]] [[Germany]].

==Plot==
The film takes place an unspecified number of months after the [[Munich Massacre]] in [[West Germany]]. Emmi (Mira), a 60 year-old window cleaner and widow, enters a bar, driven in by the rain and wanting to listen to the music being played inside. A woman in the bar (Katharina Herberg) tauntingly suggests Ali (Salem), a [[Morocco|Moroccan]] ''[[Gastarbeiter]]'' ([[guest worker]]) in his late thirties, ask Emmi to dance, to which Emmi accepts. After they dance, they develop a friendship and Ali follows Emmi home, staying at her apartment for the night. After some more interaction between the two, they start to fall in love and Ali continues to live with Emmi. Emmi decides to visit her children to introduce them to Ali; daughter Krista ([[Irm Hermann]]) and her tyrannical son-in-law Eugen (Fassbinder himself); Eugen thinks she is losing her sanity and Krista thinks that her mother - who has been a widow for years - is fantasizing.

Their relationship is threatened when the landlord's son, who has been sent on the assumption that Emmi has taken in a lodger,  to point out to Emmi that subletting is against Emmi's tenancy agreement, and that Ali must leave within a day. Fearful of losing Ali, Emmi claims that she and Ali are planning to marry to alleviate this problem. After the landlord's son apologizes for the misapprehension and leaves, Emmi speaks to Ali and apologizes for having invented the idea of her marrying him, but is surprised by Ali when he says that it is an excellent idea. The film then shows them in a civil court, married.

Their marriage is looked upon negatively by those who live near them, which include apartment tenants and nearby shop keepers. Emmi is shunned by her coworkers, and Ali faces discrimination at every turn. When Emmi invites her three grown children and son-in-law to meet Ali, they openly reject him. One of Emmi's sons smashes in her TV set in anger, her other son declares she must have lost her sanity, and her daughter calls her apartment a "pigsty" and calls Emmi a "whore", before the four of them leave.

Emmi's sadness towards this rejection washes away as her optimism resurfaces and decides that she and Ali should take a long vacation together to escape the discrimination, convinced that upon return, they will have been missed and will be welcomed back. After their return, they face less discrimination, but only because neighboring tenants and shopkeepers see the gain in treating Emmi better, not because they have outgrown their prejudices.

Wanting to get back with her old friends' after their apparent renewed respect, Emmi begins to neglect Ali or to adopt some of their attitudes toward him.  She becomes more strict, ordering him to do more things. When co-workers visit and remark on how surprisingly clean he is and comment on his muscles, she shows him off as if he were an object.  This causes Ali to leave, and to seek comfort in female bartender Barbara (Barbara Valentin), with whom he has apparently had a relationship with prior to meeting Emmi.  When he leaves Emmi to her friends, she attributes it to his "mood swings," and notes that it must be his "foreigner mentality", adopting the xenophobic attitudes of her friends in order to fit in. This causes them to drift apart, with Ali not standing up to Emmi because of the insecurities he faces as a foreigner. He then turns back to the bartender,  spending the night with her. Emmi wants to see him more visits him at work, where he pretends he doesn't know her as his workmates make fun of her age, calling her Ali's "Moroccan grandmother."

Just when it seems as if the relationship is beyond repair, Emmi goes back to the bar where they first met to meet with Ali and has the bartender put the same song on the jukebox that led to their dance in the beginning of the movie. They decide to dance together, and, while dancing, Emmi emphasizes that she knows she is old and that he is free to come and go, but tells him that when they are together, they must be nice to each other. He agrees and they declare their love for each other. In that moment, Ali collapses in Emmi's arms from what turns out to be a burst [[stomach ulcer]]. The film then shows Emmi with Ali in the hospital, where a doctor tells her the illness is common among foreign workers because of the stress they face in everyday life; the doctor then adds that Ali will have surgery to remove the ulcer, but that he will probably be back in six months with another ulcer. Emmi declares that she will do everything in her power to prevent this and holds Ali's hand.

==Production==
The film was shot in just under two weeks, and was planned as an exercise in film-making for Fassbinder, to fill in the time in his schedule between the work on two other films, ''[[Martha (1974 film)|Martha]]'' and ''[[Effi Briest (1974 film)|Effi Briest]]''.{{ref|1}}

Ali is played by [[El Hedi ben Salem]], who was Fassbinder's [[significant other|partner]] at the time. Fassbinder himself has a cameo appearance as Emmi's son in law. Emmi's daughter, Kristin, played by [[Irm Hermann]]), had herself a turbulent relationship with Fassbinder in real life, having been quoted as saying of Fassbinder, "He couldn't conceive of my refusing him, and he tried everything. He almost beat me to death on the streets of [[Bochum]] ....".&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Baer|1986|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; And Fassbinder himself grew up under some of the domestic effects of immigrant prejudice, given that his mother immigrated back to Germany from Poland after the Soviet Occupation and Fassbinder grew up in a turbulent and eventually divorcing household where immigrating relatives stayed with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Thomsen|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Watson|1992|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original German title ''Angst essen Seele auf'' is deliberately grammatically incorrect, translating literally as "Fear eat soul up."  The correct German form would be ''"Angst isst die Seele auf''" - which (without the definite article "die") became the title of a related 2002 short film also starring Mira. The title is one of the things Ali tells Emmi. As an immigrant, he speaks in what can be referred to as  "[[Broken English|broken German]]" consistently throughout the film. The line of dialogue he utters is simply "Fear eat soul up." Since Ali's poor German grammar is translated literally in the film's English subtitles, the subtitles for Ali's dialogue are similarly riddled with grammatical errors.

''Ali'' is in part an homage to the films of [[Douglas Sirk]], in particular ''[[Imitation of Life (1959 film)|Imitation of Life]]'' (1959) and ''[[All That Heaven Allows]]'' (1955). The most overt homage is the scene in which Emmi's son kicks in the television (an important symbol in ''All That Heaven Allows'') after finding out that his mother has married a [[north African]].&lt;ref name=Toteberg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/1068-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-all-that-fassbinder-allows |title=Ali: Fear Eats the Soul: All That Fassbinder Allows |first=Michael |last=Töteberg |date=1990 }} Posting of a published essay by Fassbinder's biographer and editor.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes and symbolism==
"Fear eats the soul", which is one of the things Ali says while talking with Emmi early in the movie, becomes almost literal later on, when it turns out that Ali has a stomach ulcer and is hospitalized. The characters are also often shown on screen in exaggerated ways; Characters are shown far away from the camera to emphasize how distant from society Emmi and Ali feel, while their apartment is shot in a claustrophobic manner, to symbolize the fear they feel in their relationship and everyday life.&lt;ref name="Ebert Digital LLC"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Great Movie: Ali: Fear Eats the Soul|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/great-movie-ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert Digital LLC|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Upon release===
The film gained critical acclaim upon its release, with the film's tone and Fassbinder's direction being signaled out as highlights. Writing for ''The [[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', [[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 4 out of 4 stars, saying: "[Fassbinder] nudges us to get outside the movie and look at it as absurd, as black humor, as [a] comment on these people so hopelessly trapped in their dreary surroundings and by their fates...Is [Fassbinder] sometimes being deliberately funny? I’m sure of it. His style and tone are so adamant that audiences sometimes just sit in silence, uncertain of the right response. With some films, that indicates the director’s loss of control over tone. With Fassbinder, it seems to be the response he wants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=Ali: Fear eats the soul review|url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ali-fear-eats-the-soul-1974|website=rogerebert.com|publisher=Ebert digital LLC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Moskowitz of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' gave it a similarly positive review, calling the film "Not showy for exploitation, too observant and cool for robust hyoping".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moskowitz|first1=Gene|title=Fear eats the soul out review|url=https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/cinefiles/DocDetail?docId=2983|website=cinefiles; the review came from Variety magazine|publisher=Variety Media, LLC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' dissented somewhat, calling it a "Courageous attempt" and praising Mira and Salem's performances, while criticizing the "Posterlike Blandness" of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canby|first1=Vincent|title=At the Film Festival: ‘Ali’|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1974/10/07/archives/at-the-film-festivalali-fassbinder-explore-racial-prejudice-the.html|website=nytimes.com|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the acclaim his movie received, Fassbinder stated that he thought it was only the 8th best movie he made.&lt;ref name="NYTretrospec"/&gt;

===Modern reception===
The film has continued to receive positive reviews, with Mira and Salem's acting being praised as a highlight. On [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an approval rating of 100%, based on 32 reviews, with an [[average rating]] of 9.5/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Regarded as one of the high-water marks in German New Wave cinema of the 1970s, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul is at once an intense portrayal of a relationship and a tribute to one of Rainer Werner Fassbinder's film heroes, Douglas Sirk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANGST ESSEN SEELE AUF (ALI: FEAR EATS THE SOUL)|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/fear_of_fear/|website=Rotten Tomatoes|publisher=Fandago|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for ''[[The New York Times]]'', Alex Abramovich calls ''Ali'' "The most thought-provoking, and beautiful, of [Fassbinder's] films"&lt;ref name=NYTretrospec/&gt; Richard Brody of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' praised the direction, saying "Fassbinder uses the camera with a precise, novelistic touch", and also praised Fassbinder's tributes to other films, saying "...[Fassbinder] didn't just make use of prior forms, he quoted them, and derived from them the ironies implicit in his melodramatic styles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brody|first1=Richard|title=DVD of the week: Ali: Fear eats the Soul|url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dvd-of-the-week-ali-fear-eats-the-soul|website=newyorker.com|publisher=Condé Nast|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Peter Bradshaw calls Mira and Salem's performance "Superb", and "The most purely lovable characters I have ever seen on a movie screen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bradshaw|first1=Peter|title=Fear Eats the Soul review – love versus racism in Fassbinder's exquisite tale|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/30/fear-eats-the-soul-review-love-versus-racism-in-fassbinders-exquisite-tale|website=thegaurdian.com|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Re-reviewing the movie for his ''[[Great Movies]]'' series of essays, [[Roger Ebert]] calls the film "Very powerful" and ends his review by saying, "“Ali: Fear Eats the Soul” might sound like improbable, contrived soap opera. It doesn’t play that way." &lt;ref name="Ebert Digital LLC"/&gt;

'''Allegory in the Middle Ages''' was a vital element in the synthesis of biblical and [[classical tradition]]s into what would become recognizable as medieval culture. People of the [[Middle Ages]] consciously drew from the cultural legacies of the ancient world in shaping their institutions and ideas, and so [[allegory]] in [[medieval literature]] and [[medieval art]] was a prime mover for the synthesis and transformational continuity between the ancient world and the "new" Christian world.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

People of the Middle Ages did not see the same break between themselves and their classical predecessors that modern observers see; rather, they saw continuity with themselves and the ancient world, using [[allegory]] as a synthesizing agent that brings together a whole image.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt;

==Four types of interpretation or ''allēgoria''==

For most medieval thinkers there were four categories of interpretation (or meaning) used in the Middle Ages, which had originated with the Bible commentators of the early Christian era.&lt;ref name=barney&gt;Stephen A. Barney (1989). "Allegory". ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]''. vol-1. {{ISBN|0-684-16760-3}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

# The first is simply the ''[[literal and figurative language|literal]]'' interpretation of the events of the story for historical purposes with no underlying meaning. 
# The second is called ''[[typology (theology)|typological]]'': it connects the events of the [[Old Testament]] with the [[New Testament]]; in particular drawing allegorical connections between the events of Christ's life with the stories of the Old Testament. 
# The third is ''[[moral]]'' (or ''[[tropological]]''), which is how one should act in the present, the "moral of the story". 
# The fourth type of interpretation is ''[[anagogical]]'', dealing with the future events of Christian history, heaven, hell, the last judgment; it deals with prophecies.

Thus the four types of interpretation (or meaning) deal with past events (literal), the connection of past events with the present (typology), present events (moral), and the future (anagogical).&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Dante]] describes interpreting through a "four-fold method" (or "allegory of the theologians") in his [[epistle]] to [[Scaliger|Can Grande della Scala]]. He says the "senses" of his work are not simple, but:

{{cquote|Rather, it may be called "[[polysemy|polysemous]]", that is, of many senses. A first sense derives from the letters themselves, and a second from the things signified by the letters. We call the first sense "literal" sense, the second the "allegorical", or "moral" or "anagogical". To clarify this method of treatment, consider this verse: ''When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a barbarous people: Judea was made his sanctuary, Israel his dominion'' (Psalm 113). Now if we examine the letters alone, the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified; in the allegory, our redemption accomplished through Christ; in the moral sense, the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the state of grace; in the anagogical sense, the exodus of the holy soul from slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory.. they can all be called allegorical.

=== Old and New Testaments ===

Medieval allegory began as a Christian method for synthesizing the discrepancies between the Old Testament and the New Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; While both testaments were studied and seen as equally divinely inspired by [[God]], the Old Testament contained discontinuities for Christians—for example the Jewish [[kosher]] laws.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The Old Testament was therefore seen in relation to how it would predict the events of the New Testament, in particular how the events of the Old Testament related to the events of Christ's life. The events of the Old Testament were seen as part of the story, with the events of Christ's life bringing these stories to a full conclusion. The technical name for seeing the New Testament in the Old is called ''[[typology (theology)|typology]]''.

[[Image:Biblia.pauperum.jpg|250px|thumb|Christ rises from the tomb, alongside Jonah spit onto the beach, a typological allegory.]]

One example of typology is the story of [[Jonah]] and the whale from the Old Testament.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; Medieval allegorical interpretation of this story is that it prefigures Christ's burial, with the stomach of the whale as Christ's tomb. Jonah was eventually freed from the whale after three days, so did Christ rise from his tomb after three days. Thus, whenever one finds an allusion to Jonah in Medieval art or literature, it is usually an allegory for the burial and resurrection of Christ.

Another common typological allegory is with the four major Old testament prophets [[Isaiah]], [[Jeremiah]], [[Ezekiel]], and [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]]. These four prophets prefigure the four Apostles [[Matthew the Evangelist|Matthew]], [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]], [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]], and [[John the Apostle|John]]. There was no end to the number of analogies that commentators could find between stories of the Old Testament and the New.

There also existed a tradition in the Middle Ages of ''[[mythography]]''—the allegorical interpretation of pagan myths.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt; [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' were standard textbooks throughout the Middle Ages, and each had a long tradition of allegorical interpretation. 
:"An illustrative example can be found in [[Siena]] in a painting of Christ on the cross (''Sano di Pietro's Crucifix'', 15th c). At the top of the cross can be seen a bird pecking its own breast, blood pouring forth from the wound and feeding its waiting chicks below. This is the [[pelican]] whose "story" was told by the Roman naturalist [[Pliny the Elder]]. Thus by analogy to a "[[paganism|pagan]]" source,  Christ feeds his own children with his own blood."

Mediaeval philosophers also saw allegory in the natural world, interpreting animals, plants, and even non-living things in books called [[bestiary|bestiaries]] as symbols of Biblical figures and morals.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;  For example, one bestiary compares [[stag]]s with people devoted to the Church, because (according to medieval zoology) they leave their pastures for other (heavenly) pastures, and when they come to broad rivers (sin) they form in line and each rests its head on the haunches of the next (supporting each other by example and good works), speeding across the waters together.&lt;ref&gt;''The Book of Beasts'', trans. [[T. H. White]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of allegory==

===Late Antiquity===
The early allegorizing trait in the interpretation of the [[Hebrew Bible]] figures prominently in the massive oeuvre of a prominent Hellenized Jew of Alexandria, [[Philo Judaeus]] (c. 20 BCE – c. 50 CE), whose allegorical reading of the [[Septuagint]] synthesized the traditional Jewish narratives with [[Platonism]]. Philo's allegorizing, in which he continued an earlier tradition, had little effect in later Jewish thought, in part because the Jewish culture of Alexandria dispersed by the fourth century.&lt;ref name="Norman"&gt;Norman F. Cantor, [https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/321173.The_Civilization_of_the_Middle_Ages''The Civilization of the Middle Ages''], 1993:40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian writers such as [[Origen]] (184/185 – 253/254) took up the allegorized interpretations and began to read the Old Testament as a series of prefigurations of the New Testament,&lt;ref name="Norman" /&gt; in a time when rhetorical training was common, when the classics of mythology were still standard teaching texts, when the Greek and Roman pantheon of gods were still visible forms (if not always fully recognized by the more learned populace), and when the new religions such as Christianity adopted or rejected pagan elements by way of ''allegoresis'' (the study and interpretation of allegory).

[[Prudentius]] wrote the first surviving Christian purely allegorical freestanding work, ''[[Psychomachia]]'' ("Soul-War"), about AD 400.&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The plot consists of the personified "good" virtues of Hope, Sobriety, Chastity, Humility, etc. fighting the personified "evil" vices of Pride, Wrath, Paganism, Avarice, etc. The [[personification]]s are women, because in Latin words for abstract concepts have feminine grammatical gender; an uninformed reader of the work might take the story literally as a tale of many angry women fighting one another, because Prudentius provides no context or explanation of the allegory.&lt;ref name=cook&gt;William R. Cook and Ronald B. Herzman (2001). ''Discovering the Middle Ages''. [[The Teaching Company]]. {{ISBN|1-56585-701-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this same period of the early 5th century three other authors of importance to the history of allegory emerged: [[Claudian]], [[Macrobius]] and [[Martianus Capella]]. Little is known of these authors, even if they were "truly" Christian or not, but we do know they handed down the inclination to express learned material in allegorical form, mainly through personification, which later became a standard part of medieval schooling methods.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Claudian's first work ''In Rufinum'' attacked the ruthless [[Rufinus (Byzantine official)|Rufinus]] and would become a model for the 12th century ''[[Alanus de Insulis Anticlaudianus|Anticlaudianus]]'', a well known allegory for how to be an upstanding man. As well his ''Rape of Prosperpine'' served up a litany of mythological allegories, personifications, and [[cosmological allegory|cosmological allegories]].&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Neoplatonist]] commentators&lt;ref name=calian/&gt; used allegory as a [[rhetorical]], philosophical and religious devise in reading Ancient mythology, [[Homer]],&lt;ref name=lamberton&gt;Robert Lamberton (1989). ''Homer the Theologian: Neoplatonist Allegorical Reading and the Growth of the Epic Tradition'' (London: University of California Press).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Plato]].&lt;ref name=calian&gt;Florin Calian (2013).[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256848245_Clarifications_of_Obscurity_Conditions_for_Proclus's_Allegorical_Reading_of_Plato's_Parmenides ''“Clarifications” of Obscurity: Conditions for Proclus’s Allegorical Reading of Plato’s Parmenides''] Obscurity in Medieval Texts (Krems: Institut für Realienkunde des Mittelalters und der frühen Neuzeit)&lt;/ref&gt;

Macrobius wrote ''Commentary of the Dream of Scipio'', providing the Middle Ages with the tradition of a favorite topic, the allegorical treatment of dreams.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

Lastly Martianus Capella wrote ''De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii'' ("Marriage of Philology and Mercury"), the title referring to the allegorical union of intelligent learning with the love of letters. It contained short treatises on the "[[seven liberal arts]]" (grammar, rhetoric, dialectic, geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, music) and thus became a standard textbook, greatly influencing educators and students throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

[[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boethius]], perhaps the most influential author of [[Late Antiquity]], first introduced readers of his work ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]'' to the personified Lady Philosophy, the source of innumerable later personified figures (such as Lady Luck, [[Fortuna|Lady Fortune]], etc.)&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===Early Middle Ages===
After Boethius there exists no known work of allegorical literature until the 12th century. Although allegorical thinking, elements and artwork abound during this period, it was not until the rise of the medieval university in the High Middle Ages that sustained allegorical literature appears again.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;

===High and Late Middle Ages===
The earliest works were by [[Hugh of St Victor]] (''[[Didascalicon]]'', 1125{{cn|date=February 2018}}), [[Bernard Silvestris]] (''[[Cosmographia (Bernard Silvestris)|Cosmographia]]'', 1147), and [[Alanus ab Insulis]] (''Plaint of Nature'', 1170, and ''Anticlaudianus'') who pioneered the use of allegory (mainly personification) for abstract speculation on metaphysics and scientific questions.

The High and Late Middle Ages saw many allegorical works and techniques. There were four great works from this period.&lt;ref name=barney/&gt;
*'''The Four Great Medieval Allegories'''
**''[[Le Roman de la Rose]]''. A major allegorical work, it had many lasting influences on western literature, creating entire new genres and development of vernacular languages.
**''[[The Divine Comedy]]''. Ranked amongst the greatest medieval works, both allegorically and as a work of literature; was (and remains) hugely popular.
**''[[Piers Plowman]]''. An encyclopedic array of allegorical devices. Dream-vision; pilgrimage; personification; satire; typological story structure (the dreamer's progress mirrors the progress of biblical history from the Fall of Adam to Apocalypse).
**''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]''. A plot based on an [[anagogical]] allegory; a dreamer is introduced to heavenly Jerusalem. Focus on the meaning of death. A religious response to ''Consolation of Philosophy''.

[[File:Arezzo posizione.svg|thumb|237x237px|The Arezzo 1465 vase was found in Arezzo, in the Etruria region of Italy.]]
The '''Arezzo 1465 vase''' is an [[Pottery of ancient Greece|Attic]] [[Krater|volute krater]] attributed to [[Euphronios]], that dates to the [[Archaic Greece|Late Archaic period]] (550-510 BCE). It is a [[Red-figure pottery|red-figure style]] vase, which became popular during the time of its making, and it was found in [[Arezzo|Arezzo, Italy]] in the Etruria region in 1465 due to the vast trade network stemming from Athens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arezzobedandwine.com/en/routes/arezzo-history.html|title=Arezzo History|website=www.arezzobedandwine.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vase is currently housed in Arezzo, in the ''Museo Archeologico Nazionale''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://archeotoscana.wordpress.com/about/arezzo-museo-archeologico-nazionale/|title=Arezzo, Museo Archeologico Nazionale e anfiteatro romano|date=2013-05-31|work=ARCHEOTOSCANA|access-date=2017-12-03|language=it-IT}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Attica, cratere di euphronios, 500-470 ac. ca. 02.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Attica,%20cratere%20di%20euphronios,%20500-470%20ac.%20ca.%2002.JPG|thumb|left|The depictions on one side of the Arezzo 1465 vase include Herakles and Telamon fighting the Amazons.|277x277px]]

The entire body of the vase primarily focuses on an [[amazonomachy]], which is a battle between the [[Greeks]] and the [[Amazons]], a nation of all-female warriors from mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ancient.eu/amazon/|title=Amazon|work=Ancient History Encyclopedia|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; One side leads into the other, showing three Greek [[hoplite]]s and an [[Amazons|Amazon]] seemingly running into battle, shown by their equipment of shields, spears, and helmets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0363|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0363|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other side shows [[Heracles|Herakles]] and [[Telamon]] battling the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0355|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0355|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The frieze on the neck shows a [[komos]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/image?img=Perseus:image:1993.01.0358|title=Perseus:image:1993.01.0358|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a drunken ritual that was performed during Ancient Greek celebrations.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.definitions.net/definition/komos|title=What does komos mean?|website=www.definitions.net|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Depictions ==
All depictions on this vase point towards warfare in [[Ancient Greece]]. The body shows an [[amazonomachy]] with clear indications of Greek [[Hoplite]]s, which all carry spears and wear the style of helmet and shield that were historically attributed to [[Hoplite]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hellenic-art.com/greek-hoplite-armor.html|title=Greek Hoplite Armor &amp; Weapons|website=www.hellenic-art.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as hints towards the other warriors being the [[Amazons]], due to their use of a bow rather than spear, the long thin bodies indicative of a more feminine body type, and their different style of clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Amazon-Greek-mythology|title=Amazon {{!}} Greek mythology|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heracles|Herakles]] is known to be a great warrior and hero, so the placement of him among everything else is also indicative of some sort of battle, or of something that he is contributing his efforts in order to reign victorious. [[Telamon]], a friend of the demigod [[Heracles|Herakles]], is commonly thought of in reference to the myth where [[Telamon]] assists [[Heracles|Herakles]] in killing the sea monster that [[Poseidon]] sends to destroy the city of [[Troy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Telamon/telamon.html|title=Telamon|website=www.greekmythology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than an [[amazonomachy]] like this [[krater]] depicts, however his presence then further solidifies the warfare theme as he is directly tied to another mythical battle.

Even the [[komos]] scene along the neck of the vase is a celebration. Though the direct purpose of a [[komos]] is still unclear, they were performed at post-game celebrations for victorious athletes.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In [[Ancient Greece]], people regarded warriors as the greatest athletes, with [[Heracles|Herakles]] as the epitome of  heroic athletes,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunt|first=David|date=Fall 2009|title=The Heroic Athlete in Ancient Greece|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2009/JSH3603/jsh3603i.pdf|journal=Journal of Sport History|volume=36|pages=375–392|via=Sports Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; so even this contributes to the warfare theme. The [[komos]] scene could be celebrating the victory of [[Heracles|Herakles]] over the [[Amazons]] in his [[Labours of Hercules|9th labor]] to retrieve the [[Girdle Of Hippolyta|Belt of Hippolyta]], the queen of the [[Amazons]], as this is the only mythological reference to any interaction between [[Heracles|Herakles]] and the [[Amazons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Mortals/Hippolyta/hippolyta.html|title=Hippolyta|website=www.greekmythology.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as none of the [[Amazons]] on this [[krater]] are identifiable as [[Hippolyta]] and the belt is not on the vase either, it can only be said with certainty that this vase depicts an [[amazonomachy]] which involves [[Heracles|Herakles]].

'''''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life''''' is a 1996 American [[documentary film]] written, produced, and directed by [[Michael Paxton]]. Its focus is on novelist and philosopher [[Ayn Rand]], the author of the [[bestseller|bestselling novels]] ''[[The Fountainhead]]'' and ''[[Atlas Shrugged]]'', who promoted her philosophy of [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]] through her books, articles, speeches, and media appearances.

==Synopsis==
Actress [[Sharon Gless]] narrates the story of Rand's life and an overview of her ideas. In addition to color and black-and-white archival footage of Rand, the film includes appearances by philosophers [[Harry Binswanger]] and [[Leonard Peikoff]], [[CBS News]] correspondent [[Mike Wallace]], television interviewers [[Phil Donahue]] and [[Tom Snyder]], architect [[Frank Lloyd Wright]], political figures [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Leon Trotsky]], and Hollywood personalities [[Cecil B. DeMille]], [[Edith Head]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], and [[Robert Taylor (actor)|Robert Taylor]].

==History==
Paxton first encountered Rand's work in 1970 at the age of 13, when he read her novel ''[[We the Living]]''. In 1977 he saw her speak at the [[Ford Hall Forum]], an experience that he later cited as an inspiration for his approach to the documentary.&lt;ref name="Paxton"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life (The Companion Book) |last=Paxton |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Paxton |location=Layton, Utah |publisher=Gibbs Smith |year=1998 |isbn=0-87905-845-5 |oclc=38048196 |pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paxton spent four years working on the film.&lt;ref name="Paxton" /&gt; It was completed in 1996 and appeared that year at the [[Telluride Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Sutton |title=A Payoff for Patience: NYU Film Maker Bides Time, Wins Change for Oscar |work=New York Daily News |date=March 21, 1998 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/payoff-patience-nyu-film-maker-bides-time-wins-chance-oscar-article-1.800843}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 1996, it premiered in Los Angeles with a special screening to benefit the [[Ayn Rand Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=''Ayn Rand'' Premiere Slated at Paramount |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 26, 1996 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-26/entertainment/ca-57795_1_ayn-rand}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1997, it appeared at the [[Slamdance Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Slamdance Chronology |url=https://variety.com/1999/more/news/slamdance-chronology-1117490524/ |publisher=''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' |date=January 21, 1999 |accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film "a pedantic specimen," "dutiful in outlook and utterly conventional in format," and said it "does little beyond appreciating its subject as unwaveringly as possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/021398rand-film-review.html |title='Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life:' A View of the Philospher (''sic'') |author=Maslin, Janet |website=NYTimes.com |accessdate=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, and commented: "Too long – and pedantic – for some viewers, but a must for Rand enthusiasts."&lt;ref name="maltin"&gt;{{cite book |last =Maltin |first =Leonard |authorlink =Leonard Maltin |title =Leonard Maltin's 2004 Movie &amp; Video Guide |publisher =Plume |year =2003 |page =70 |isbn = 0-452-28478-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said the film "is not what one might expect at this stage in Rand's literary afterlife. The film doesn't make a case for her as an artist or philosopher, nor does it delineate her place in the pantheon of letters. It just assumes her importance and goes about telling her story . . . Obviously this was a woman of enormous courage, tenacity and fire. That comes through enough in ''Ayn Rand'' to make one wonder what she would have thought about the tone of the documentary, which at times borders on sappy . . . The tone will become grating even to anyone who is in sympathy with Rand's work. Though the documentary concentrates on the biographical, it glosses over the major embarrassment of her personal life – her adulterous relationship with her much younger disciple, [[Nathaniel Branden]] . . . ''Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life'' isn't nearly ambitious enough, but as an introduction to an important 20th century American voice, it works."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1998/05/01/DD14367.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' observed, "Benefiting from some first-rate archival, personal and commercial film material, Michael Paxton's Oscar-nominated effort serves as a solid and appreciative precis of her life and world views, but doesn't get down in the trenches to illustrate how and why she stirred up such passions pro and con, and gingerly refrains from analyzing the paradoxes and complexities of her personality and intimate relationships."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117467179.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1&amp;p=0 ''Variety'' review]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
Following appearances at festivals and other limited venues, the film's regular theatrical release was on February 13, 1998. It earned $26,101 at two theaters in its opening weekend. When it closed its domestic theatrical run on November 12, 1998, it had grossed $205,246.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=aynrand.htm |title=Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life |publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards and nominations===
The film won the [[Satellite Award for Best Documentary Film]]. It was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]], but lost to ''[[The Long Way Home (1997 film)|The Long Way Home]]''.&lt;ref name="Oscars1998"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oscars.org/awards/academyawards/legacy/ceremony/70th-winners.html |title=The 70th Academy Awards (1998) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=November 19, 2011|work=oscars.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of tortoise-mounted stelae originated no later than early 3rd century (late [[Han dynasty]]).
According to the 1957 survey by Chêng Tê-k'un (鄭徳坤), &lt;!-- there is [[:de:Zheng Dekun]] already.... --&gt;
the earliest extant tortoise-borne stele is thought to be the one at the tomb of Fan Min (樊敏), in [[Lushan County, Sichuan|Lushan County]], [[Ya'an]], [[Sichuan]].&lt;ref name=cheng&gt;{{citation

The author's name would be spelled Zheng Dekun in Pinyin.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Segalen]] had earlier identified the stele as a [[Han dynasty]] monument; present-day authors agree, usually giving it the date of 205 AD.&lt;ref name=seg68&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|1995|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Robert E. |last=Harrist|publisher=University of Washington Press |year=2008

The stele has a rounded top with a dragon design in [[low relief]] - a precursor to the "two intertwined dragons" design that was very common on such steles even in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, over a thousand years later.&lt;ref name=cheng/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scdms.com/lineArticleAction.do?method=showLineDetail&amp;lineid=34910 雅安汉源九襄石牌坊、青溪古镇、金钟山、芦山龙门洞、飞仙关、灵鹫山五日游] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716013347/http://www.scdms.com/lineArticleAction.do?method=showLineDetail&amp;lineid=34910 |date=July 16, 2011 }} (A Ya'an tourist trip description, with the photos from the  "Fan Min Que (Gate Towers) and Sculptures" site (樊敏阙及石刻), including the present-day condition of the Fan Min stele, in a new gazebo&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best known extant early example of the genre is the set of four stele-bearing tortoises at the mausoleum of [[Xiao Xiu]] (475-518), who was the younger brother of the first [[Liang dynasty]] emperor [[Emperor Wu of Liang|Wu]] (Xiao Yan), near [[Nanjing]].&lt;ref&gt;Angela Falco Howard, Li Song, Wu Hung, Yang Hong, «[https://books.google.com/books?id=PGuPsNCaJdwC Chinese Sculpture]».

The ''bixi'' tradition flourished during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing dynasties]]. The Ming founder, the [[Hongwu Emperor]], in the first year after the dynasty had been proclaimed (1368), adopted regulations, allowing tortoise-based funerary tablets to the [[Mandarin square|higher ranks]] of the [[Chinese nobility|nobility]] and the [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|mandarinate]]. He tightened the rules in 1396, leaving only the highest nobility (those of the ''gong'' and ''hou'' ranks) and the officials of the [[mandarin square|top 3 ranks]] eligible for ''bixi''-based stelae. The type of [[Chinese dragon|dragons]] crowning the tortoise-born stele, and the type and number of other statuary at the tomb site, were prescribed by the same regulations as well.&lt;ref name=deGroot2&gt;{{citation

At the Hongwu Emperor's [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum|own mausoleum]], a huge ''bixi'' holding the so-called ''Shengde'' stele welcomes visitors at the Sifangcheng pavilion at the entrance of the mausoleum complex. Three centuries later (1699), the [[Kangxi Emperor]] of the Qing dynasty visited Nanjing and contributed another tortoise, with a stele praising the founder of the Ming, comparing him to the founders of the great Tang and Song dynasties of the past.&lt;ref name=pd2003&gt;[http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html 明孝陵两大“碑石之谜”被破解] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018052502/http://www.people.com.cn/GB/paper447/9409/871387.html |date=2012-10-18 }} (Solving the two great riddles of the Ming Xiaoling's stone tablets).

The inscription is interpreted as "His reign was as glorious as that of the Tang and Song"&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hongwu Emperor's tortoise tradition was continued by the later Ming and Qing emperors, [[Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties|whose mausoleums]] are usually decorated by ''bixi''-born steles as well.

Even the self-declared emperor [[Yuan Shikai]] was posthumously honored with a ''bixi''-based stele in [[Anyang]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aynews.net.cn/jray/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=3736  洹园里的破嘴龟] (The tortoise with a broken mouth in Huanyuan Park) {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; as was the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] Premier [[Tan Yankai]] (1880–1930), whose stele near [[Nanjing]]'s [[Linggu Temple]] had its inscription erased after the Communist Revolution.

Occasionally, a foreign head of state was honored with a ''bixi'' as well, as it happened to the sultan of [[Brunei]] [[Abdul Majid Hassan]], who died during his visit to China in 1408. The [[Tomb of the King of Boni|sultan's grave]], with a suitably royal ''bixi''-based monument, was discovered in Yuhuatai District south of [[Nanjing]] in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Rozan Yunos, [http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china "The Brunei Sultan who died in China"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319185326/http://www.bt.com.bn/en/life/2008/11/09/the_brunei_sultan_who_died_in_china |date=March 19, 2009 }} The Brunei Times, 9.11.2008&lt;/ref&gt;

After an [[Nestorian Christian|ancient Christian stele]] was unearthed in [[Xi'an]] in 1625, it, too, was put on the back of a tortoise. In 1907, this so-called [[Nestorian Stele]] was moved to the [[Stele Forest]] Museum along with its tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Michael |last=Keevak| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCsCcij1S4AC

As Havret comments (p. 142), looking at the early drawings it's rather easy to mistake the tortoise for a "horrible bat"!&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See modern [https://www.flickr.com/photos/chinaencounters/2722082168/ photos of the stele on Flickr.com], complete with the same tortoise&lt;/ref&gt;

These days, long-lost bixi continue to be unearthed during archaeological excavations and construction work. Among the most remarkable finds is the discovery of a huge 1200-year-old in [[Zhengding]] ([[Hebei]] Province) in June 2006. The stone turtle is 8.4 m long, 3.2 m wide, and 2.6 m tall, and weighs 107 tons. It has since been moved to Zhengding's [[Kaiyuan Temple (Zhengding)|Kaiyuan Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zd.gov.cn/WebSite/Info.aspx?ModelId=1&amp;Id=2171 正定开元寺] (Zhengding's Kaiyuan Temple), 2014-12-22&lt;/ref&gt;

Electronic Version (October 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Turkish researcher Cengiz Alyilmaz, it was the design of this stele that influenced the builders of the important 8th-century stelae with [[Old Turkic script|Old Turkic]] inscriptions, many of which also stood on tortoises.&lt;ref name=alyilmaz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N.Bazylkhan  [http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?lang=e&amp;mod=1&amp;tid=1 The Orhon Inscriptions]&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, the most accessible one is probably [[Bayanchur Khan]]'s (Eletmish Bilge Kağan)'s [[Tariat inscriptions|Terhin-Gol stele]] (753 AD), now in the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in [[Ulan Bator]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://irq.kaznpu.kz/index.php?mod=1&amp;tid=1&amp;oid=24&amp;lang=e  Inscription El etmish Bilge kagan (Tariat // Terh)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)]] and the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]] erected tortoise-based monuments as well, some of which have been preserved in Russia's [[Ussuriysk]] and Mongolia's [[Karakorum]].

In Japan, this form of tortoise-supported stele is found primarily at the graves of prominent [[Kamakura period]] (1185–1333) figures, especially in the city of [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. Another large collection of tortoise-borne stelae, spanning 17th through 19th centuries, can be seen at the cemetery of the [[Tottori Domain]] ''[[daimyō]]'' outside [[Tottori, Tottori|Tottori]]. Otherwise, the form does not seem to have been particularly popular in earlier or later times.

In Korea, tortoise-borne stelae are known already during the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period (e.g., the Tombstone of King [[Muyeol of Silla]], erected 661).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cha.go.kr/korea/heritage/search/Culresult_Db_View.jsp?VdkVgwKey=11,00250000,37 경주 태종무열왕릉비(慶州 太宗武烈王陵碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Monuments of this type have been preserved from the later [[Goryeo]] dynasty as well, such as the [[Stele of Bongseon Honggyeongsa]] (1026).&lt;ref&gt;[http://blackmoon.tistory.com/292 봉선홍경사사적갈비 (奉先弘慶寺事蹟碣碑); 성주사낭혜화상백월보광탑비 (聖住寺郎慧和尙白月보光塔碑)] (Includes photos of Korean monuments) {{ko icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vietnam also has a long tradition of tortoise-born stelae, where they [[:commons:Category: Vinh Lang stele|commemorate]] emperor [[Lê Lợi]] as well as the graduates of the Confucian academy at Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]].

While there is no indigenous tradition of erecting stelae on tortoise-shaped pedestals in the United States, a Qing period ''bixi'' can be seen on campus of the [[Harvard University]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. [[Harvard Bixi|This bixi]] was given as a gift to Harvard in 1936 by the members of Harvard Clubs in China; an appropriate text was carved for the occasion on the tablet carried by the tortoise.

==Development as an art form==
According to [[Victor Segalen]]'s assessment, the early ([[Han dynasty|Han]] and the [[Six Dynasties]]) stone tortoises were artistic images of quite real aquatic turtles.&lt;ref name=seg68/&gt; The creatures looked quite realistic through the [[Song dynasty]], when huge tortoise pedestals, such as the ones in [[Shou Qiu]] near [[Qufu]], or the one in [[Dai Miao]] at [[Mount Tai]] were erected.

The early-Ming specimens, while still definitely [[Green sea turtle|chelonian]], had sprouted small ears; sides of their heads and their [[carapace]]s are often decorated by a leaf-like design. They usually have prominent teeth, which real-life turtles don't.&lt;ref name=lishuai/&gt;
By the mid-[[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (the 18th century), however, the stele-bearing tortoise becomes the characteristic [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]-headed ''bixi''.

According to some 19th-century western authors, the Chinese tradition of using a tortoise as a pedestal may have a common source with the Indian legend of the world being held up by a giant turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0LoNAAAAIAAJ
|title=The Chinese reader's manual: A handbook of biographical, historical, mythological and general literary reference
|first= William Frederick|last= Mayers|year=1874|location=Shanghai|publisher=American Presbyterian Mission Press
|page=94}}, section 299 ("Kwei, 龟"). Quote: "The conception is probably derived from the same source with that of the Hindoo legend of the tortoise supporting an elephant, on whose back the existing world reposes." Mayers is also quoted in: {{citation|first=Charles Alfred Speed|last= Williams|title=Chinese Symbolism and Art Motifs: An Alphabetical Compendium of Antique Legends and Beliefs, as Reflected in the Manners and Customs of the Chinese|publisher= Tuttle Publishing|year= 1988|ISBN= 0-8048-1586-0|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wV_3WRPC3gQC|page=405}} (reprint of the 1941 edition).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The word ''bi'' 贔 or ''bixi'' 贔屭 (also written with a variant character, 贔屓) is translated by Chinese dictionaries as "strong", "capable to support great weight". The word ''bixi'' is attested already in [[Zhang Heng]]'s (78-139) "Western Metropolis Rhapsody" (''Xi Jing Fu''), which mentions "the great strides" of the giant divine ''bixi''.&lt;ref&gt;"Western Metropolis Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:西京賦|西京賦]]), Quote: "綴以二華，巨靈贔屓，高掌遠蹠，以流河曲，厥跡猶存". Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Zhang Heng's follower [[Zuo Si]] (250 - 305) in his ''[[Eastern Wu|Wu]] [[Jiankang|Capital]] [[Fu (poetry)|Rhapsody]]'' (''Wu Jing Fu'') explicitly associates the attribute ''bixi'' with the legendary giant turtle ''[[ao (turtle)|ao]]'', whose head supports a sacred mountain.&lt;ref&gt;"Wu Capital Rhapsody" ([[:zh:s:吳都賦|吳都賦]]), Quote: "巨鼇贔屓，首冠靈山" (Giant ''Ao'' ''bixi'' [i.e. 'mighty'], [his] head holds up a sacred mountain). Quoted also in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''bixi'' became associated with the stele-carrying tortoises no later than the [[Ming dynasty]]. The terminology, however, did not immediately become stable. The earliest known Ming-era list of fantastic creatures appearing in architecture and applied art is given by [[Lu Rong]] (1436–1494) in his ''Miscellaneous records from the bean garden'' (椒园杂记, ''Shuyuan Zaji''). The ''bixi'', with the syllables swapped (屭贔, ''xibi''), appears in the first position in that list:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''xibi'' looks like a tortoise. By its nature it likes to carry heavy weights.  It used to be employed to support stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lu Rong]]'s  ''Shuyuan Zaji'' is quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "屭赑其形似龟，性好负重，故用载石碑". The full text of ''Shuyuan Zaji'' can be found at a number of sites online, e.g. here: [http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html  菽園雜記] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306151643/http://xxgblog.tcip.net.cn/index.php/56/viewspace-3024.html |date=2010-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Lu Rong claims that his list (including the total of 14 creatures) is based on the ancient books of beasts and supernatural creatures, the ''[[Shan Hai Jing]]'' and the ''Bo Wu Zhi'' (博物志); however, as the modern researchers Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong note, that is not the case, and the names, much more likely, were taken by Lu Rong from the folklore of his times.&lt;ref name=yang2008&gt;[[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after Lu Rong, the mighty tablet-carrying tortoise appears in various lists of the "[[Chinese dragon#Children of Dragon|Nine children of the Dragons]]", compiled by several Ming authors. However, both [[Li Dongyang]] (1441–1516) in his ''Huai Lu Tang Ji'' and Xie Zhaozhe ([[:zh:謝肇淛|謝肇淛]], 1567–1624) in his ''Wu Za Ji'' ([[:zh:五雜俎|五雜俎]], ''Five Assorted Offerings'', ca. 1592), refer to the tortoise that carries the stele by the name ''baxia'' (霸下), rather than ''bixi''; at the same time they apply the name ''bixi'' to the "literature-loving" dragons that appear on the sides of the stele:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''baxia'' has an innate love for carrying weights; the creature [that] now [is] under tablets is its image. ... The ''bixi'' has an innate love for literature; the dragons [that] now [are] on the sides of tablets are its image.&lt;ref&gt;[[Li Dongyang]]'s  ''Huai Lu Tang Ji''  (怀麓堂集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "霸下平生好负重，今碑座兽足是其遗像。... 赑屭平生好文，今碑两旁龙是其遗像。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The name ''bixi'', however, is given to the table-carrying tortoise in the more popular version of the list of the "Nine Children of the Dragon". In this form of the list, given e.g. by [[Yang Shen]] (1488–1559), the ''bixi'' is given the first position:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The ''bixi'' looks like a tortoise, and likes to carry heavy weights; [he] is the tortoise-carrier (''guifu'') now [seen] under stone tablets.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yang Shen]]'s ''Sheng'an Ji'' (升庵集) quoted in  [[#yang2008|Yang Jingrong and Liu Zhixiong (2008)]]: "赑屭形似龟，好负重，今石碑下龟蚨是也。"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Stone tortoises in art and popular lore==
The great stone tortoises, whose antiquity sometimes went farther into the history than anyone could remember, often made impression on people who saw them, and excited their curiosity. It is said that an old legend of the stone tortoise made by [[Lu Ban]] that went to swim in the ocean every summer, and came back to its seaside hill in the fall, inspired [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]]'s lines:
&lt;ref name=deGroot4_341&gt;{{citation
 |publisher=Brill Archive 
 |year=1892b 
 |first=Jan Jakob Maria

 |title=The Religious System of China 
 |volume=IV 
 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8kUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA341 
 |pages=341 
}}. The legend, and the reference to [[Lu Ji (Shiheng)|Lu Ji]], comes from the book ''Shu Yi Ji'' (述异记, "Extraordinary stories"), commonly ascribed to [[Ren Fang]] (460—508). The story from the tortoise from a seaside hill  (海畔石龜), as well as the one about another sea-going stone turtle from [[Linyi]] County  (臨邑縣), and their translations to [[Modern Standard Mandarin]], can be found [http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712014209/http://www.fulan.com/167/ebook/classic/taipinggj/tpgj374.html |date=July 12, 2006 }}.
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Lu Ji's poem: «[http://sc.zdic.net/weijin/1223279777683632.html 石龟尚怀海。我宁忘故乡] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724140557/http://sc.zdic.net/weijin/1223279777683632.html |date=July 24, 2011 }}». Unlike modern Chinese editions, {{harvnb|de Groot|1892b|p=341}} has  亡 (to die) instead of 忘 (to forget), which changes the meaning of the second line to "I'd rather die in my home village."&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone tortoise cherishes in its heart the love of the sea.&lt;br&gt;

The opening chapter of the 14th-century novel ''[[Water Margin]]'' involves Marshal Hong releasing 108 spirits imprisoned under an ancient stele-bearing tortoise.

}}, which includes the English translation of the relevant excerpt from the novel. The original text of the chapter can be seen e.g. at [[:zh:s:水滸傳/第001回|水滸傳/第001回]], starting from "只中央一個石碑，約高五六尺，下面石龜趺坐 ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''bixi'' plays a key role in a ghost story, "The Spirit of the Stone Tortoise" (贔屭精, ''Bixi jing''), 
from [[Yuan Mei]]'s (1716–1797) collection ''[[Zi Bu Yu|What the Master does not Speak of]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Thome, [https://scholar.google.com/ STRANGE OVERTONES: THE EXPRESSIONS OF RESENTMENT AND COMPASSION IN YUAN MEI’S WHAT THE MASTER DOES NOT SPEAK OF] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903014320/https://scholar.google.com/ |date=September 3, 2009 }}. M.A. thesis, Arizona State University, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The French poet and researcher [[Victor Segalen]] (1878–1919), who published both a scholarly book about China's stelae&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a book of poetry-in-prose about them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
was also impressed by the "truly emblematic" stone tortoises, their "firm gestures and [[elegy|elegiac]] posture".&lt;ref name=segalen&gt;{{harvnb|Segalen|2007|pp=52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the image of the ''bixi'' continues to inspire modern Chinese artists.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Zhijie, [https://archive.is/20130131212441/http://www.qiuzhijie.com/image/Performance/nanjing/shiban/%E5%A4%B1%E8%B4%A5%E4%B9%8B%E5%9F%8E.JPG "City of failure"] - the print is based on the Sifangcheng pavilion in the [[Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation concerns==
As with other stone (particularly, marble and limestone) statuary, ''bixi'' turtles and their stelae are vulnerable to [[acid rain]] (or, in winter, acid snow). On the Harvard University campus, the curators of [[Harvard Bixi|its turtle]] protect it against the "acid snow" by wrapping it with a waterproof cover for the winter.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://harvardmagazine.com/2000/03/art-under-wraps.html Art Under Wraps]" , Harvard Magazine, March–April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

A more ''bixi''-specific concern is the wear to the creatures' noses from the people who touch them for good luck. At Hanoi's [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Temple of Literature]], highly popular with visitors, this has become a sufficient concern to the site's managers as to make them develop plans for introducing creative landscaping and structural obstacles to keep visitors from touching the temple's 82 stone turtles.&lt;ref name=lishuai&gt;The custom of rubbing ''bixi'' for good luck (or, rather, protection from bag luck) is attested elsewhere e.g. in: 
李帅 (Li Shuai), 毛朝青 (Mao Chaoqing), [http://news.ifeng.com/a/20150114/42931143_0.shtml 赑屃不是龟. 专职驮石碑] (Bixi is not a turtle.

'''Classical sculpture''' refers loosely to the forms of [[sculpture]] from [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Ancient Rome]], as well as the Hellenized and Romanized civilizations under their rule or influence from about 500 BC to around 200 AD. More precisely it refers to [[Ancient Greek sculpture]] from around 500 BC to the onset of the [[Hellenistic]] style around 323 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Manuel Cook|Cook, R.M.]], ''Greek Art'', pp. 142, 148, Penguin, 1986 (reprint of 1972), {{ISBN|0140218661}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also refer stylistically to later sculpture done in a [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] or classical style. Classical sculptures have been popular since the [[Renaissance]]. Only those works that closely follow the canon of classical forms would fall under the term.

In addition to free standing [[statue]]s, the term classical sculpture incorporates [[relief]] work (such as the famous [[Elgin Marbles]] of the Parthenon) and the flatter [[bas-relief]] style. Whereas sculptural works emphasized the human form, reliefs were employed to create elaborate decorative scenes.

Ancient statues and bas-reliefs survive showing the bare surface of the material of which they are made, and people generally associate classical art with white marble sculpture. But there is evidence that many statues were painted in bright colours.&lt;ref name=colorgods&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/0801/trenches/colorgods.html Archeological Institute of America: Carved in Living Color]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the colour was weathered off over time; small remnants were removed during cleaning; in some cases small traces remained which could be identified.&lt;ref name=colorgods/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://io9.com/5616498/ultraviolet-light-reveals-how-ancient-greek-statues-really-looked io9.com: Ultraviolet light reveals how ancient Greek statues really looked]&lt;/ref&gt; A travelling exhibition of 20 coloured replicas of Greek and Roman works, alongside 35 original statues and reliefs, was held in Europe and the United States in 2008: Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity.&lt;ref name="artmuseums.harvard.edu"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090104060402/http://www.artmuseums.harvard.edu/exhibitions/sackler/godsInColor.html Gods in Color: Painted Sculpture of Classical Antiquity September 22, 2007 Through January 20, 2008, The Arthur M. Sackler Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; Details such as whether the paint was applied in one or two coats, how finely the pigments were ground, or exactly which binding medium would have been used in each case—all elements that would affect the appearance of a finished piece—are not known.

There are several periods:
{{main|Ancient Greek sculpture|Roman sculpture}}

== Archaic period ==
The most important sculptural form of the Archaic period was the ''[[kouros]]'' (plural: ''kouroi''), the standing male nude (See for example Biton and Kleobis). Reflecting Egyptian influence, the ''kouros'' stands upright with his left leg slightly forward and his arms at his sides. Archaic Greek sculptors seem to have been influenced stylistically by the Egyptians, although divergences appeared early on. In particular, the male figures of Archaic Greece tended to be represented in the nude, while this was uncommon during all periods of ancient Egyptian art (except when slaves or enemies were depicted). As in Egyptian art, female subjects were always portrayed clothed; female nudity would not appear until much later on.

In this period, the later emphasis on naturalistic bone and muscle anatomy had not yet developed, which can be seen in observing details such as the knees and other critical joints.  Some details seem to be "incised" rather than fully modeled, a relic of more ancient traditions. Nor did figures stand or move naturally. However, as the Archaic style gradually transformed into what is known as the Classical style, a clear progression displaying more and more technical knowledge and skill can be detected.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Classical period ==

The Classical period saw changes in both the style and function of sculpture. Poses became more naturalistic (see the [[Charioteer of Delphi]] for an example of the transition to more naturalistic sculpture), and the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting the human form in a variety of poses greatly increased. From about 500 BC statues began to depict real people. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton set up in Athens to mark the overthrow of the tyranny were said to be the first public monuments to actual people.

As Greek artists began to study human movement and anatomy, they discovered that living humans tend to display a "weight shift" or contraposition when standing.

The first Greek statue to exhibit [[contrapposto]] is the famed Kritios Boy, dating circa 480 BC. Contrapposto soon became a defining element of Greek sculptural technique, culminating in the Canon of the [[Doryphoros]] ("spear-bearer"), which adopted extremely dynamic and sophisticated contrapposto in its cross-balance of rigid and loose limbs.

Most of the sculptures made at this time were created to show appreciation to the gods for showing them good fortune, and also to help bring good fortune in the future, and to also gain favor from the gods.  Greek temples were specially made to fit the large cult statues.  They believed that placing shrines around the areas that were said to be holy would please the gods.  Because Greek gods were mostly myths based on real people's lives mixed feelings were created about the sculptures, and therefore more man-like sculptures were created.  Most sculptures created can be understood to represent myth, archetype or purpose in life.

During the classical period sculptors were not only creating works for temples, but also mortuary statues to show tribute to deceased loved ones. The sculptures would often show the deceased person in a relaxed pose.  Successful athletes and rich families would commission statues of themselves for temples to show respect to the gods.  In the 5th century BC portraits became popular and busts featuring generals, philosophers and political leaders appeared.

The high quality of Greek work attracted Italian interest, and greatly influenced both Etruscan, and later, Roman art.
The enthusiasm with which Rome greeted Greek art has proven{{According to whom|date=February 2011}} important not merely because of the transmission of classical Greek style, but also because most of the extant classical Greek works survive mainly in the form of Roman marble copies of Greek bronze originals. As bronze has always been a valuable metal, most of the originals were likely long ago melted down, and the few genuine survivals have been found by mostly in the context of shipwrecks.

However, Greeks did carve marble, and a number of classical Greek marbles have survived; the famed [[Parthenon Marbles]] (also known as the Elgin Marbles), lasted ''in situ'' until the beginning of the 19th Century. In fact, many of the surviving classical Greek marbles are from an architectural context.

&lt;/center&gt;

== Hellenistic period ==

The transition from the Classical to the Hellenistic period occurred during the 1st century. Sculpture became more and more naturalistic. Common people, women, children, animals and domestic scenes became acceptable subjects for sculpture, which was commissioned by wealthy families for the adornment of their homes and gardens. Realistic portraits of men and women of all ages were produced, and sculptors no longer felt obliged to depict people as ideals of beauty or physical perfection. Most Greek men were sculpted standing with their hips slightly to the side. When human beings stand this way it uses more muscles.

Roman sculpture began with the copying of Greek sculpture, but then evolved into a form of sculpture which more emphasised the individual. There are many surviving sculptures of Roman emperors.

== Influence ==

Greco-Roman sculpture had a profound influence on Western art. With it, the Greco-Roman style established the possibility and potential of realism in art. Because of the relative durability of sculpture, it has managed to survive and continue to influence and inform artists in varying cultures and eras, from Europe to Asia, and today, the whole world.

While classical art gradually fell into disfavor in Europe after the fall of the Western Roman Empire, its rediscovery during the early [[Italian Renaissance]] proved decisive. One of the most important sculptors in the classical revival was [[Donatello]]. Many other sculptors such as [[Michelangelo]] also made works which can be considered classical. Modern Classicism contrasted in many ways with the classical sculpture of the 19th Century which was characterized by commitments to naturalism ([[Antoine-Louis Barye]]) -- the melodramatic ([[François Rude]]) sentimentality ([[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux]]) -- or a kind of stately grandiosity ([[Lord Leighton]]) Several different directions in the classical tradition were taken as the century turned, but the study of the live model and the post-Renaissance tradition was still fundamental to them.

'''''Dirty Dancing''''' is a 1987 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[drama film|drama]] [[dance film]] written by [[Eleanor Bergstein]], directed by [[Emile Ardolino]] and starring [[Patrick Swayze]] and [[Jennifer Grey]] in lead roles. These two actors are also seen in the 1984 [[disaster film|disaster]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] [[Red Dawn]].

Originally a low-budget film by a new studio, [[Vestron Pictures]], ''Dirty Dancing'' became a box office hit. {{As of|2009|df=US}}, it has earned over $214 million worldwide.&lt;ref name=singh-2010&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/film-news/6193195/Patrick-Swayze-the-man-who-inspired-a-generation-of-women-to-dance-has-died.html|date=September 16, 2009|title=Patrick Swayze, the man who inspired a generation of women to dance, has died|accessdate=January 9, 2010|author=Singh, Anita|work=The Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first film to sell more than a million copies on home video,&lt;ref name=singh-2010/&gt; and the [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|''Dirty Dancing'' soundtrack]] created by [[Jimmy Ienner]] generated two multi-[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] albums and multiple singles, including "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]", which won both the [[Golden Globe]] and [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and a [[Grammy Award]] for best duet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Save the Last Dirty Dance for the Revival; Movies: 'Dirty Dancing,' the Catskills love story with forbidden footwork, steps out again for its 10th birthday.|author=Craughwell, Kathleen|work=Los Angeles Times|date=August 18, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's popularity led to a 2004 [[prequel]], ''[[Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights]]'', and a stage version which has had sellout performances in Australia, Europe, and North America.

A [[television film|made-for-TV]] [[Dirty Dancing (2017 film)|remake]] was released in 2017.&lt;ref name="premiere"&gt;{{cite web|last=Desk|first=TV News|title=ABC Announces May Premiere Date for DIRTY DANCING Event Movie|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/ABC-Announces-May-Premiere-Date-for-DIRTY-DANCING-Event-Movie-20170110|date=10 January 2017|accessdate=11 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the original theatrical film, the remake received negative reviews from critics.

== Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 to 700 words. --&gt;In the summer of 1963 17-year-old Frances "Baby" Houseman is vacationing with her [[affluent]] family at Kellerman's resort. Her father, Jake, is doctor and friend to Max Kellerman, the resort proprietor. Exploring one night, Baby surreptitiously observes Max instructing the waiters, all [[Ivy League]] students, to romance the guests' daughters no matter how unattractive. She also sees Max's condescending attitude to the [[working class]] entertainment staff including Johnny, the resort's dance instructor. Baby is attracted to Johnny, and dances briefly with him when his cousin Billy takes her to one of the staff's secret dirty dancing parties.

Baby discovers Johnny's dance partner, Penny, is pregnant by Robbie, the Houseman's waiter who attends [[Yale]] medical school and who flirts with Baby's older sister Lisa. When Robbie refuses to help Penny, Baby borrows money from her father to pay for Penny's illegal [[abortion]] without revealing what the money is for. At first Penny refuses an abortion as it would mean she and Johnny missing a performance at a neighboring resort, costing them the season's salary. Baby volunteers to stand in for Penny, and during her dance sessions with Johnny they develop a romantic attraction.

[[File:Dirty-dancing-coverx-large.jpg|left|thumb|A scene from the dancing finale&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news|author=Vernon, Polly|url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1868781,00.html |title=Hey Baby&amp;nbsp;– we're all Swayze now|date=October 10, 2006| work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=May 15, 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;]]

Johnny and Baby's performance is successful except for Baby's failure to execute the climactic lift. Back at Kellerman's Billy tells them Penny's abortion was successful but the doctor was a quack and Penny is in great pain. Baby enlists her doctor father's help and he stabilizes Penny, then refuses to shake Johnny's hand and orders his daughter never to see him again, believing Johnny to be responsible for Penny's pregnancy. Baby later apologizes to Johnny for her father's behavior and declares her feelings for him. They dance and spend the night together in his cabin where she loses her virginity to him.

The next morning Jake tells the family he wants to leave, claiming he wants to avoid traffic. Lisa and their mother convince him to stay. Baby and Johnny continue seeing each other despite Baby hiding their relationship from her father, which hurts Johnny. Johnny declines to have sex with a promiscuous married guest, Vivian Pressman, who instead has sex with Robbie, with whom Lisa wanted to lose her virginity. Vivian catches Baby leaving Johnny's cabin one morning and attempts to get revenge by claiming Johnny stole her husband's wallet. When Max prepares to fire Johnny Baby reveals their relationship to give Johnny an alibi. Johnny is cleared of the theft but instead fired for his relationship with Baby. Before leaving Kellerman's, Johnny attempts to apologize to Jake, but Jake accuses him of tossing Penny aside and moving on to his daughter. Baby apologizes for lying to her father, but not for her relationship with Johnny. She also berates him for claiming compassion for the less fortunate but an [[elitist]] attitude when it comes to himself and his own family.

At the end of season talent show Jake gives Robbie money for medical school, and Robbie accidentally admits it was he who he got Penny pregnant, not Johnny. Jake snatches the money back. Johnny interrupts the final song by bringing Baby up on stage and declaring that she has made him a better person. They dance a provocative version of the dance they'd practiced throughout the summer, ending with Baby successfully performing the climactic lift. Jake admits he was wrong about Johnny and he and Baby embrace. The staff and guests all join Baby and Johnny dancing to "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]".

==Production==

===Pre-production===
''Dirty Dancing'' is based in large part on screenwriter [[Eleanor Bergstein]]'s own childhood: she is the younger daughter of a Jewish doctor from New York, spent summers with her family in the Catskills, participated in "Dirty Dancing" competitions, and was herself nicknamed "Baby" as a girl. In 1980, Bergstein wrote a screenplay for the [[Michael Douglas]] film, ''[[It's My Turn (film)|It's My Turn]]''. However, the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script, much to her dismay. She then conceived a new story, focused almost exclusively on dancing. In 1984, she pitched the idea to [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] executive Eileen Miselle, who liked it and teamed Bergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb. They set the film in 1963, with the character of Baby based on Bergstein's own life, and the character of Johnny based on the stories of [[Michael Terrace]], a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985 while she was researching the story.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} She finished the script in November 1985, but management changes at MGM put the script into [[Turnaround (filmmaking)|turnaround]], or limbo.

Bergstein then shopped the script around to other studios but was repeatedly rejected, until she brought it to Vestron Pictures, the newly formed studio division of [[Stamford, Connecticut]], based Vestron Inc., the leading independent home video distribution company.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} While honing their pitch to Vestron, Gottlieb and Bergstein chose [[Emile Ardolino]] as the film's director, who had won the 1983 [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Academy Award]] for the documentary, ''[[He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin']]''. Ardolino had never directed a feature film, but was extremely passionate about the project; he even sent a message from where he was sequestered on jury duty, insisting that he was the best choice as director. The team of Gottlieb, Bergstein, and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron's president, Jon Peisinger, and the company's vice president for production, Mitchell Cannold. By the end of the meeting, Peisinger had greenlighted the project to become Vestron's first feature film production. The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $5&amp;nbsp;million, at a time when the average cost for a film was $12&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=Bergstein, Eleanor, producer |date=2007 |title=Dirty Dancing: 20th anniversary |format=DVD |publisher=Lions Gate | quote=Tribute to Emile Ardolino }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For choreographer, Bergstein chose [[Kenny Ortega]], who had been trained by [[Gene Kelly]].&lt;ref name=ode&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/01/16/DD168837.DTL |title=Choreographer Kenny Ortega's ode to disco|date=January 16, 2003|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|author=Hartlaub, Peter }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a location, they did not find anything suitable in the Catskills (as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point), so they decided on a combination of two locations: [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]] and the [[Mountain Lake Hotel (Virginia)|Mountain Lake Hotel]] near [[Pembroke, Virginia]], and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area.&lt;ref name=asheville&gt;{{cite news|title='Dirty Dancing' marks 20 years with return to big screen|date=April 30, 2007|work=[[Asheville Citizen-Times]]|author=Clark, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
Director Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers who could also act, as he did not want to use the "stand-in" method that had been used with ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983). For the female lead of Frances "Baby" Houseman, Bergstein chose the 26-year-old [[Jennifer Grey]], daughter of the Oscar-winning actor and dancer [[Joel Grey]] (''e.g.'', of the film ''[[Cabaret (1972 film)|Cabaret]]'' (1972)), who, like her father, was a trained dancer. They then sought a male lead, initially considering 20-year-old [[Billy Zane]], who had the visual look desired (originally the Johnny character was to be Italian and have a dark exotic look), but initial dancing tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations. The next choice was 34-year-old [[Patrick Swayze]], who had been noticed for his roles in ''[[Grandview, U.S.A.]]'' (1984) and ''[[Red Dawn]]'' (1984). He was a seasoned dancer, with experience from the [[Joffrey Ballet]]. The producers were thrilled with him, but his agent was opposed to the idea. However, Swayze read the script, liked the multi-level character of Johnny, and took the part anyway, and Johnny was changed from being Italian to Irish. Grey was initially not happy about the choice, as she and Swayze had difficulty getting along on ''Red Dawn'', but when they did their dancing screen test, the chemistry between them was obvious. Bergstein described it as "breathtaking".&lt;ref name=story&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Dancing|publisher='' [[The E! True Hollywood Story]]''|date=September 3, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other casting choices were [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jerry Orbach]] as Dr. Jake Houseman, Baby's father; and [[Jane Brucker]] as Lisa Houseman, her older sister. Bergstein also attempted to cast her friend, sex therapist Dr. [[Ruth Westheimer]], to play Mrs. Schumacher, and [[Joel Grey]] as her husband. However, Westheimer backed out when she learned the role involved being a thief. The role went instead to 89-year-old [[Paula Trueman]], and Joel Grey was not cast. Another role went to Bergstein's friend, New York radio personality [[Bruce Morrow|"Cousin Brucie"]]. She initially wanted him to portray the social director but then later asked him to play the part of the magician. The role of the social director went to the then unknown [[Wayne Knight]] (of later ''[[Seinfeld]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]'' fame).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=You may know Wayne Knight whether you know you do or not|date=November 7, 1992|author=Moore, Frazier|work=[[Chicago Tribune]] (AP)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of Baby's mother was originally given to [[Lynne Lipton]], who is briefly visible in the beginning, when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman's (she is in the front seat for a few seconds; her blonde hair is the only indication), but she became ill during the first week of shooting and was replaced by actress [[Kelly Bishop]], who had already been cast to play Vivian Pressman, the highly sexed resort guest. Bishop moved into the role of Mrs. Houseman, and the film's assistant choreographer [[Miranda Garrison]] took on the role of Vivian.&lt;ref name=dvd&gt;{{cite video|date=2007|title=Dirty Dancing: 20th anniversary|format=DVD|publisher=Lions Gate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some scenes shot with Lipton in the role of Mrs. Houseman can be viewed on the 20th anniversary 2007 DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Otrada4.JPG|thumb|A typical family resort in the [[Catskill Mountains]]]]
[[Principal photography]] for ''Dirty Dancing'' took place in [[Lake Lure, North Carolina]], and [[Mountain Lake (Virginia)|Mountain Lake, Virginia]]. Scenes in Lake Lure were filmed at the old Boys Camp, which is now a private, residential community known as Firefly Cove. These scenes included the interior dancing scenes, Baby carrying the watermelon and practicing on the signature stairs, Johnny's cabin, the staff cabins, the golf scene where Baby asks her father for $250, the "log" scene and the famous "water lift" scene. Scenes filmed at Mountain Lake included dining scenes, Kellerman's Hotel, the beach games, Penny crying in the kitchen, and the Houseman family's cabins.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The tight schedule allowed only two weeks for rehearsal and 44 days for filming, as it was already the tail end of summer. The cast stayed in the same hotel at Mountain Lake Lodge in [[Pembroke, Virginia]] and at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn &amp; Spa in [[Lake Lure]], N.C. Rehearsals quickly turned into disco parties involving nearly every cast member, even non-dancers such as [[Jack Weston]].{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The dancing and drinking went on almost non-stop and, immersed in the environment, the lead actors, Grey and Swayze, began identifying with their characters. Bergstein built upon this, encouraging the actors to improvise in their scenes. She also built the sexual tension by saying that no matter how intimate or "grinding" the dance steps, that none of the dancers were to have any other kind of physical contact with each other for the next six months.&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

Filming started on September 5, 1986 but was plagued by the weather, which ranged from pouring rain to sweltering heat. The outside temperature rose to {{convert|105|°F|°C}}, and with all the additional camera and lighting equipment needed for filming, the temperature inside could be as high as {{convert|120|°F|°C}}. According to choreographer Kenny Ortega, on one day 10 people passed out within 25&amp;nbsp;minutes of shooting. The elderly Paula Trueman collapsed and was taken to the local emergency room to be treated for dehydration. Patrick Swayze also required a hospital visit; insisting on doing his own stunts, he repeatedly fell off the log during the "balancing" scene and injured his knee so badly he had to have fluid drained from the swelling.&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

Delays in the shooting schedule pushed filming into the autumn, which required the set decorators to spray-paint the autumn leaves green. The uncooperative weather then took a different turn, plunging from oppressive heat to down near {{convert|40|°F|°C}}, causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October. The crew wore warm coats, gloves, and boots. Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing, to repeatedly dive into the cold water.&lt;ref name=asheville/&gt; Despite her character's enjoyment, Grey later described the water as "horrifically" cold, and she might not have gone into the lake, except that she was "young and hungry".&lt;ref name=dvd/&gt;

Relations between the two main stars varied throughout production. They had already had trouble getting along in their previous project, ''[[Red Dawn]]'' (1984), and worked things out enough to have an extremely positive screen test, but that initial cooperation soon faded, and they were soon "facing off" before every scene.&lt;ref name="story"/&gt; There was concern among the production staff that the animosity between the two stars would endanger the filming of the love scenes. To address this, producer Bergstein and director Ardolino forced the stars to re-watch their initial screen-tests—the ones with the "breathtaking" chemistry. This had the desired effect, and Swayze and Grey were able to return to the film with renewed energy and enthusiasm.&lt;ref name=dvd/&gt;

Director Ardolino encouraged the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling, even if actors went "off script". One example of this was the scene where Grey was to stand in front of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm (similar to the pose seen in the movie poster). Though it was written as a serious and tender moment, Grey was exhausted, found the move ticklish, and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it, no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for. Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey's behavior annoying. However, the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film, complete with Grey's giggling and Swayze's annoyed expression. It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie, turning out, as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it, "as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film."&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

===Post-production===
The shooting [[Wrap (film industry)|wrapped]] on October 27, 1986, both on-time and on-budget. No one on the team, however, liked the rough cut that was put together, and Vestron executives were convinced the film was going to be a flop. Thirty-nine percent of people who viewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot. In May 1987, the film was screened for producer [[Aaron Russo]]. According to Vestron executive Mitchell Cannold, Russo's reaction at the end was to say simply, "Burn the negative, and collect the insurance."&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

Further disputes arose over whether a corporate sponsor could be found to promote the film. Marketers of the [[Clearasil]] acne product liked the film, seeing it as a vehicle to reach a teen target audience. However, when they learned the film contained an abortion scene, they asked for that part of the plot to be cut. As Bergstein refused, the Clearasil promotion was dropped. Consequently, Vestron promoted the film themselves and set the premiere on August 16, 1987. The Vestron executives had planned to release the film in theaters for a weekend, and then send it to home video, since Vestron had been in the video distribution business before film production.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Considering how many people disliked the film at that point, producer Gottlieb's recollection of her feelings at the time was, "I would have only been grateful, ''if'' when it was released, people didn't yell at me."&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

===Critical response===
Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives the film a rating of 72% based on reviews from 61 critics and a rating average of 6.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Like its winsome characters, ''Dirty Dancing'' uses impressive choreography and the power of song to surmount a series of formidable obstacles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/dirty_dancing/ |title= Dirty Dancing (1987) |work= [[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher= [[Flixster]] |accessdate= November 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref name="metacritic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/dirty-dancing |title=Dirty Dancing reviews| work = [[Metacritic]]|accessdate=December 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://m.cinemascore.com |title=Dirty Dancing |work=[[CinemaScore]]|accessdate=January 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the film's opening, ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a review titled "Dirty Dancing Rocks to an Innocent Beat". The ''Times'' reviewer called the film "a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963&amp;nbsp;– orderly, prosperous, bursting with good intentions, a sort of Yiddish-inflected Camelot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40712F83A5C0C758DDDA10894DF484D81 |title= 'Dirty Dancing' Rocks to an Innocent Beat |date= August 16, 1987 |author= Freedman, Samuel G. |work= The New York Times |page=A19 |accessdate= May 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviews were more mixed: [[Gene Siskel]] gave the film a "marginal Thumbs Up" as he liked Jennifer Grey's acting and development of her character, while [[Roger Ebert]] gave it "Thumbs Down" due to its "idiot plot",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=1410 |archive-url= https://archive.is/20080504150919/http://bventertainment.go.com/tv/buenavista/ebertandroeper/index2.html?sec=1&amp;subsec=1410 |dead-url= yes |archive-date= May 4, 2008 |author= Siskel, Gene |authorlink= Gene Siskel |author2= Ebert, Roger |title= Video review on ''Siskel &amp; Ebert and The Movies'' |date= August 21, 1987 |accessdate= March 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling it a "tired and relentlessly predictable story of love between kids from different backgrounds."&lt;ref name=ebert&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19870821/REVIEWS/708210301/1023|author=Ebert, Roger |title= Review of ''Dirty Dancing'' |work= [[Sun Times]]|date=August 21, 1987 |accessdate=June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine was lukewarm, saying, "If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein's script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film's song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,965450,00.html |title= Cinema: Teenage Turmoil |author= Schickel, Richard |date= September 14, 1987 |accessdate= June 8, 2007 |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a retrospective review, ''[[Jezebel (website)|Jezebel]]''{{'}}s [[Irin Carmon]] called the film "the greatest movie of all time" as "a great, brave movie for women" with "some subtle, retrospectively sharp-eyed critiques of class and gender."&lt;ref name="irin"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jezebel.com/5527079/dirty-dancing-is-the-greatest-movie-of-all-time |author= Carmon, Irin |title= Dirty Dancing Is the Greatest Movie of All Time |work=[[Jezebel (website)]] |date= April 29, 2010 |accessdate= June 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
{{See also|Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)}}
Rehearsals for the dancing, and some filming, used music from Bergstein's personal collection of gramophone records. When it came time to select actual music for the film, Vestron chose [[Jimmy Ienner]] as music supervisor. Ienner, who had previously produced albums and songs for [[John Lennon]] and [[Three Dog Night]], opted to stick with much of the music that had already been used during filming and obtained licenses for the songs from Bergstein's collection. He also enlisted Swayze to sing the new song "[[She's Like the Wind]]". Swayze had written the song a few years earlier with Stacy Widelitz, originally intending for it to be used in the film ''[[Grandview, U.S.A.]]'' (1984).&lt;ref name=story/&gt;

[[John Morris (composer)|John Morris]] composed the film's score. The lyrics for the Kellermans' song that closes the talent show were written specifically for the film&lt;ref name=dvd/&gt; and were sung to the tune of "[[Annie Lisle]]", a commonly used theme for school alma maters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=School searches for song of itself|date=December 26, 2007|author=Gardinier, Bob|work=Times Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenny Ortega]] and his assistant Miranda Garrison chose the song for the finale by going through an entire box of tapes, listening to each one. According to Ortega, literally the last tape they listened to had "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|The Time of My Life]]", which they saw as the obvious choice.&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; Ienner then insisted that [[Bill Medley]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]] record it. The song won the 1988 [[Grammy Award]] for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group, an [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]], and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song]].&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;{{Cite news|date=June 26, 1988|title=Dirty Dancing: The movie, the music, the money|author=Hoekstra, Dave |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray|page=71|year=2004|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company|McFarland]]|isbn=0-7864-1836-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demand for the album caught [[RCA Records]] by surprise. According to [[Franke Previte]], before a single had even been released, there were a million albums on back-order.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; The [[Dirty Dancing (soundtrack)|''Dirty Dancing'' album]] spent 18&amp;nbsp;weeks at number&amp;nbsp;one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album sales charts and went platinum eleven times, selling more than 32 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Music/Those-chart-busters/Article1-356957.aspx |title=Those chart busters |last=Taneja |first=Nikhil |publisher=[[The Hindustan Times]] |accessdate=April 28, 2013 |date=December 9, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010140344/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Music/Those-chart-busters/Article1-356957.aspx |archivedate=October 10, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://havanajournal.com/culture/entry/black_eyed_peas_go_dirty_dancing_havana_nights/ |title=Black Eyed Peas go Dirty Dancing - Havana Nights|publisher=Havana Journal |date=February 8, 2004|accessdate=April 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It spawned a follow-up multi-platinum album in February 1988, entitled ''[[More Dirty Dancing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whedon.info/article.php3?id_article=8624|title=Zuma Beach Ent.

Songs from the album which appeared on the charts included:&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt;
* "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life]]", performed by [[Bill Medley]] and [[Jennifer Warnes]], composed by [[Franke Previte]], John deNicola, and Donald Markowitz&amp;nbsp;– this song rose to #1 on the pop charts.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=soundtrack|chart=all}} |title=Dirty Dancing discography |publisher=Billboard.com |accessdate=March 6, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612131930/{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=soundtrack|chart=all}} |archivedate=June 12, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "[[She's Like the Wind]]", performed by lead actor [[Patrick Swayze]], composed by Lee and Stacy Widelitz; this song peaked at #3 in 1988.
* "[[Hungry Eyes]]", performed by [[Eric Carmen]], composed by [[Franke Previte]] and John deNicola; this song peaked at #4 in 1988.
* "Yes", performed by [[Merry Clayton]], composed by Neal Cavanaugh, Terry Fryer and Tom Graf; this song peaked #45 in 1988.

Additionally, the resurgence in popularity of the oldies contained in the movie led to a re-release of [[The Contours]]' single "[[Do You Love Me]]". "Do You Love Me" was featured in the movie but was omitted from the original soundtrack; it was included on ''More Dirty Dancing''. Upon being re-released, "Do You Love Me" became a surprise hit all over again, this time peaking at #11 (it originally hit #3 back in 1962).{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

As for the studio, despite the film's huge monetary success, Vestron followed it up with a series of flops and ran out of money. Vestron's parent company, [[Vestron Video|Vestron Inc.]], went bankrupt in 1989,&lt;ref name=story/&gt; and was bought out in January 1991 by LIVE Entertainment for $26 million.

Orbach, already known as a successful Broadway actor, continued in different genres. He was the voice of the candelabrum "[[Lumiere (Beauty and the Beast)|Lumiere]]" in the Disney animated film ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), before taking on his best known role, detective [[Lennie Briscoe]] in the TV crime drama ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', which he played from 1992 until his death in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Master actor exits to ringing applause|date=January 10, 2005|work=Newcastle Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choreographer Ortega went on to choreograph and direct other major pictures such as ''[[Newsies]]'' (1992)&lt;ref name=ode/&gt; and starting in 2006, the ''[[High School Musical]]'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How a Disney made-for-TV movie suddenly became ...

Lake Lure celebrated its ''Dirty Dancing'' legacy in the 1980s with the ''Dirty Dancing Revue'' featuring the A-Lure Dancers, soul singer Maurice Williams (whose song "Stay" was featured in the film), and Billy Scott and the Party Prophets.

Various images and lines from the film have worked their way into popular culture. Johnny Castle's line, "Nobody puts Baby in a corner", has been used in song lyrics, as the title of the "[[Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner]]" episode of the TV series ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', and as the title of a [[Fall Out Boy]] song. "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" was also quoted in ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'': when [[Dean Winchester|Dean]] says the line concerning his beloved Impala and his brother [[Sam Winchester|Sam]] retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie; Dean responds: "Swayze always gets a pass". The line was parodied in the webcomic ''[[Looking for Group]]'' where Richard, one of the primary characters, uttered a variation involving his own name, and in ''[[Family Guy]]'', where the scene is parodied by Baby's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth. In Sweden, feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text "Nobody puts Baby in a corner" (in English) in white neon light at [[Umeå]] Bus Square (2008) and at [[Karlstad University]] (2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sistersofjam.com/category/nobody-puts-baby-in-a-corner/|title=Nobody Puts Baby In a Corner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Family Guy]]'' also parodies the scene where Baby first sees Johnny dancing with the staff. In the TV series ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', [[Barney Stinson]] attempts to pass off the ''Dirty Dancing'' story as the story of his own loss of virginity because he is ashamed of his actual story; the original "Love is Strange" scene is shown with Barney replacing Johnny.

In ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in 2018 the famous lift dance sequence was rehearsed for the 2018 wedding of Steve McDonald and Tracy Barlow and was also performed to "[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|The Time of My Life]]" as in the film.

The French film ''[[Heartbreaker (2010 film)|Heartbreaker]]'' (2010) pays homage to the film, as a plot detail, with some clips from the film shown and a "recreation" by the two main characters of the "lift" scene.

In the first episode of the TV series ''[[New Girl]]'', the female lead Jess watches the film repeatedly after her break up. Jess continues to repeatedly watch the film after various break-ups throughout the series.

==Alternate versions==

===Stage version===
The film was adapted for the stage in 2004 as a musical, ''Dirty Dancing: The Classic Story on Stage''. Produced by Jacobsen Entertainment in Australia for $6.5&amp;nbsp;million, it was written by Eleanor Bergstein and had the same songs as the film, plus a few extra scenes. Musical direction was by [[Chong Lim]] (one of the composers for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney), and the initial production starred [[Kym Valentine]] as Baby and Sydney Dance Company's [[Josef Brown]] as Johnny. Although reviews were mixed,&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; the production was a commercial success, selling over 200,000 tickets during its six-month run.&lt;ref name=Age/&gt; It has also had sellout runs in Germany and in London's West End, where it opened at the [[Aldwych Theatre]] on October 23, 2006 with the highest pre-sell in London history, earning £6&amp;nbsp;million ($US12&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; {{As of|2011|alt=As of March 2011}}, over 1 million people have seen the musical in London, selling out 6 months in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitcardiff.com/site/latest-news/2011/3/18/dirty-dancing-to-make-welsh-debut-at-wales-millennium-centre-in-2012-a287 |title=Dirty Dancing to make Welsh debut at Wales Millennium Centre in 2012 - Cardiff |publisher=Visitcardiff.com |date=March 18, 2011 |accessdate=July 10, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003173224/http://www.visitcardiff.com/site/latest-news/2011/3/18/dirty-dancing-to-make-welsh-debut-at-wales-millennium-centre-in-2012-a287 |archivedate=October 3, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[West End theatre|West End]] production closed in July 2011 after a five-year run, prior to a two-year national tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831297730873/Dirty+Dancing+Closes+9+Jul,+Prior+to+National+Tour.html |title=Dirty Dancing Closes 9 Jul, Prior to National Tour |publisher=Whatsonstage.com |date= |accessdate=July 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718035355/http://www.whatsonstage.com/news/theatre/london/E8831297730873/Dirty+Dancing+Closes+9+Jul,+Prior+to+National+Tour.html |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show returned to the West End at the [[Piccadilly Theatre]] and ran from July 13, 2013 to February 22, 2014 before resuming its tour of the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dirty Dancing returns to give West End audiences the time of their lives!|url=http://www.bestoftheatre.co.uk/blog/post/dirty-dancing-returns|work=BestofTheatre.co.uk|accessdate=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tours and TV show===
''Dirty Dancing'' has appeared in other forms than the stage version. In 1988, a music tour named ''Dirty Dancing: Live in Concert'', featuring [[Bill Medley]] and [[Eric Carmen]],&lt;ref name=campbell/&gt; played 90 cities in three months.&lt;ref name=story/&gt; Also in 1988, the CBS network launched a ''[[Dirty Dancing (1988 TV series)|Dirty Dancing]]'' television series, however with none of the original cast or crew. The series was canceled after only a few episodes.

===Prequel===
In 2004, a prequel of the film was released, entitled ''[[Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights]]''. It tells the story of a sheltered American teenager learning about life through dance, when her family relocates to Havana, Cuba just before the [[1959 Cuban Revolution]]. Swayze was paid $5 million to appear in a cameo role as a dance teacher&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Film/DirtyDancing|title=Dirty Dancing (Film) - TV Tropes|website=tvtropes.org|access-date=2017-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; —considerably more than the $200,000 he earned for the first film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Tulsa World|date=November 5, 1989 |title=Movie Notes|author=Knight-Ridder Newspapers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th anniversary releases===
For the 20th anniversary in 2007, the film was re-released in theatres with additional footage, while the original film version was re-released on DVD with deleted scenes, and included writer commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=June 24, 2007 |url=http://www.codemasters.com/dirtydancing/ |title=Dirty Dancing Video Game&amp;nbsp;– official site |publisher=Codemasters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630005627/http://www.codemasters.com/dirtydancing/ |archivedate=June 30, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Codemasters released ''Dirty Dancing: The Video Game''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/coming_soon_to_.html |title=Coming soon to your PC: Dirty Dancing, the Video Game |date=May 29, 2007 |accessdate=June 24, 2007 |work=Wired magazine blog network |author=Arendt, Susan |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609224258/http://blog.wired.com/games/2007/05/coming_soon_to_.html |archivedate=June 9, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, the anniversary was marked by a [[reality TV]] show based on the film; titled ''[[Dirty Dancing: The Time of Your Life]]'', the TV show was filmed at the Mountain Lake resort.

In the UK, to mark the 20th anniversary of the film, Channel Five broadcast a special documentary called ''Seriously Dirty Dancing''. It was presented by Dawn Porter, an investigative journalist and a self-confessed ''Dirty Dancing'' addict. The documentary was very successful, being Channel Five's highest rated documentary of 2007. Porter visited the set of the film, met other ''Dirty Dancing'' fanatics, and learned the last dance, which she performed at the end of the documentary in front of family and friends.

==Remake==
{{main|Dirty Dancing (2017 film)}}
In August 2011, [[Lionsgate]], who owns the film rights, announced their plan to remake the film. It was confirmed that the studio had hired the film's choreographer, [[Kenny Ortega]], to direct. "We believe that the timing couldn't be better to modernize this story on the big screen, and we are proud to have Kenny Ortega at the helm," Joe Drake, president of Lionsgate's Motion Picture Group, explained about the project. A miniseries version of "Dirty Dancing" had been scheduled to be shot in Western North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wlos.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/dirty-dancing-film-tv-miniseries-wnc-20826.shtml Dirty Dancing to Film TV Miniseries in WNC &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526014114/http://www.wlos.com/news/features/top-stories/stories/dirty-dancing-film-tv-miniseries-wnc-20826.shtml |date=May 26, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2015|July|29|df=US}}, the miniseries has been put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/article29272366.html|title=Producers put Asheville ‘Dirty Dancing’ miniseries in a corner|work=charlotteobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928 she was elected to a term as Mayor of [[King's Lynn]], though she opposed the idea of women as lawmakers.

'''Helena''' is a fictional character and one of the four young lovers – [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]], [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]], [[Hermia]] and Helena – featured in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.

She is the daughter of Nedar, and a friend of [[Hermia]] (with whom she often compares herself). Prior to the play's beginning, she is betrothed to the nobleman [[Demetrius (Shakespeare)|Demetrius]] but is jilted when his affections turn to Hermia. Despite this, Helena's abiding love for Demetrius remains consistent throughout the play. Hermia and her suitor, [[Lysander (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Lysander]], confide in Helena that they plan to [[Elopement (marriage)|elope]]. In the hopes that she will gain back some of his respect, Helena tells Demetrius of Hermia and Lysander's plans and, the next night, they follow the escaping lovers into the forest.

Though Demetrius is deliberately cruel towards her, Helena remains intent in her devotion. Her ardor catches the attention of [[Oberon]], who commands that [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] enchant Demetrius so that he will fall back in love with Helena. When Puck mistakenly enchants a sleeping Lysander instead, Lysander wakes and falls instantly in love with Helena. He pursues a shocked and hurt Helena, deserting a sleeping Hermia. Oberon, trying to correct Puck's error, then puts the potion on Demetrius. Confused by the two men's change in behaviour, Helena concludes that the other three lovers have banded together to ridicule her. Helena is left confused and hurt by how cruel and unkind her closest friend and her two suitors have become.  In the scene's climax, she and Hermia nearly come to blows while the two men set out to kill one another to prove who is more worthy of Helena's affections.

Oberon commands Puck to correct the enchantment placed on Lysander. Separated by Oberon's command and Puck's magic, and with dawn approaching, the lovers each go sleep again. Puck crushes another herb into Lysander's eyes, negating the effect of the first one. When the lovers are discovered in the morning by a hunting Theseus, Hippolyta, and Egeus, all is put to rights. Demetrius claims that a metaphorical 'sickness' made him love Hermia, but in health, his love has returned to Helena. The lovers are married in a joint ceremony with Theseus and [[Hippolyta (Shakespeare)|Hippolyta]]  and together watch the play put on by the [[Mechanical (character)|Mechanicals]] in honor of the marriages.

While not the only [[protagonist]] of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'', Helena is one of its most talkative characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=All Shakespeare characters ordered by part size |url=http://www.shakespeareswords.com/Special-Features-All-Characters |publisher=ShakespeareWords.com |accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her dialogue provides key insight for the audience into humanist beliefs on the nature of love and the process of falling in love. It is her honest, unrequited love that convinces Oberon to meddle with the lovers, and her pain in being "tricked" by her friends  that convinces Oberon to restore everyone.

Helena is never criticised for her [[unrequited love]] for Demetrius; her constancy is seen by other characters as a great virtue, compared to his fickle nature. She also demonstrates great [[platonic love]] and sisterly devotion to Hermia. Within the cast of the lovers, her role is comparable to Lysander's. Both are more outwardly romantic and thoughtful than their partners, and both speak those lines most pertinent to the play's themes of romantic maturity and the source of lasting love. While Lysander says, 'the course of true love ne'er did run smooth', Helena's speech in Act I includes the well-known quote: "Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; And therefore is wing'd [[Cupid]] painted blind."

Her name is &lt;u&gt;reminiscent&lt;/u&gt; of [[Helen of Troy]], a reference made by Theseus towards the play's end, and her character is similar to another of Shakespeare's Helenas in ''[[All's Well That Ends Well|All's Well That End's Well]]''.

==United States==

===Alcott, Louisa May===
(HFR)

Rather than ''[[Little Women]]'', set in a North that was winning the war, '''[[Louisa May Alcott]]''' wrote ''After the War was Lost''.

===Ballou, Charles===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Charles Clarendon Ballou]]''' is a [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in the [[United States Army]], and the base commandant of [[Fort Leavenworth]] when Irving Morrell is posted there in the mid-1930's. It is Ballou who reintroduces [[colonel (United States)|Colonel]] Morrell to Brigadier General Daniel MacArthur, and who reassigns Morrell to be armor commander of MacArthur's occupying force in Houston.

===Baum, L. Frank===
(GW:AF, AE:VO)

In a rather odd move on Turtledove's part, '''[[L. Frank Baum]]''' is introduced as an American fighter pilot early in the Great War, this despite the fact that Baum was aged 58 in 1914. (Perhaps there is confusion with his son [[Frank Joslyn Baum]]) Somewhere along the line, Baum still becomes a children's author. Only his book ''[[Queen Zixi of Ix]]'' is mentioned by name, but because the book is an offshoot of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'' craze, we can assume he still wrote his most famous book. (However, ''The Wizard of Oz'' was inspired by [[architectural]] exhibits at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of 1893, which is unlikely to have happened in this timeline, making this plot element questionable.)

===Bernstein, Carl===
(SA:G)

Sergeant '''[[Carl Bernstein]]''' is in charge of a [[U.S. Army]] [[counterintelligence]] squadron that specializes in detecting [[wiretaps]]. He is sent to check [[Congresswoman]] Flora Blackford's office for bugs. Among his team are a 'Bob' (possibly [[Bob Woodward]] or [[H. R. Haldeman]]) and 'Dick' (almost certainly [[Richard Nixon]]). This is an obvious [[anachronism]] for the sake of a laugh, as the Bernstein of our timeline was not born until 1944.

===Blaine, James G.===
(HFR)

'''[[James G. Blaine]]''' was the second and last [[Republican Party (USA)|Republican]] [[president of the United States]]. He was also known as the only other president to start a war (over the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]'s purchase of the states of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and [[Sonora]], giving the Confederacy a [[Pacific]] port) and to lose the war as well. At the end of The [[Second Mexican War]], Blaine started the U.S. tradition of Remembrance Day and also started the alliance with the [[German Empire]], which developed into The [[Central Powers]] of the Great War.

===Bogart, Humphrey===
(SA:DE)

In this timeline, '''[[Humphrey Bogart]]''' still became a movie actor. He starred in the movie ''The Maltese Elephant'', an analog to the main timeline's ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (''The Maltese Elephant'' is also the name of a short story in Harry Turtledove's short story collection ''[[Counting Up, Counting Down]]''). Armstrong Grimes thought of Bogart when he learned that his aunt Clara was marrying someone named Humphrey Baxter.

===Booth, John Wilkes===
(HFR)

With the South having gained its independence, '''[[John Wilkes Booth]]''' has nothing to be [[Lincoln assassination|homicidally angry]] about. He and his elder brother '''[[Edwin Booth]]''' remain popular stage actors in both the U.S. and [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] into the 1880s.

===Borah, William Edgar===
(AE:VO)

[[Herbert Hoover]]'s running mate (Hoover became president after president-elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died and did not have a vice president) in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]], '''[[William Edgar Borah]]''' had even some of the most loyal Democrats saying that his vice presidential opponent, [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]], would make a better VP.

===Brown, Mordecai===
(GW:WH, AE:VO)

Known only as "Mordecai" in the series, '''[[Mordecai Brown|Mordecai "Three Finger" Brown]]''', instead of becoming a [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] pitcher, was a crewman on the ''[[United States Ship|USS]] Dakota'' during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. [[Sam Carsten]] noted how Mordecai could work as if he had ten fingers, instead of eight, which was the result of a childhood accident (also suffered by the Brown of our timeline). By 1934, Mordecai was the foreman at a [[Los Angeles]] construction company; one of his employees was Chester Martin, who had moved from [[Toledo, Ohio]] as a result of the [[Great Depression|Business Collapse]]. By the late 1930s, however, Mordecai lost many of his workers, including Martin, as a result of a strike.

===Butler, Benjamin Franklin===
(HFR)

'''[[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]]''' had been a politician of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] when the War of Secession began in 1861. He left the party and joined the [[United States Army|Army]] to fight the war. He was best known for commanding the occupation garrison of [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]], a post in which he was most thoroughly despised by the locals. When the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] was defeated, Butler was forced to flee New Orleans for his life; the Confederate authorities had promised to hang him for war crimes without a trial. In the aftermath of the war, Butler left the army and returned to politics, this time joining the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] as a hard liner.

When the [[Second Mexican War]] began in 1881, Butler was more than enthusiastic to fight it, but as the war progressed and turned against the Union, Butler grew bitter and openly critical of US President [[James G. Blaine]].

In 1882, Butler was one of several prominent leaders of the Republican Party to attend a convention called by former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederate States with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. Butler steadfastly refused to drop his Anti-Confederate policies. He blamed the loss of the war on the social and moral weakness of the country, and that it needed to rebuild itself into a more authoritarian nation if the nation was to ever be triumphant over the Rebels. When he realized he wasn't going to get his way, Butler walked out of the meeting. In the chaos that followed, the Republican Party split, with the Liberal faction joining the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]], while Butler left the Republican Party and rejoined the Democrats, taking all of the Conservative hardliners with him.

As a result of Butler's actions, the Democratic Party would be pushed further to the right on the political spectrum and would also cause a majority of the party to adopt a hard line foreign policy and the gearing of American society to [[American nationalism|nationalism]] and [[revanchism]].

===Cannon, Clarence===
(AE:VO)

A [[Socialist Party (USA)|Socialist]] Congressman from [[Missouri]], '''[[Clarence Cannon]]''' becomes [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] during the [[Alfred Emanuel Smith|Smith]] Administration.

===Chaney, Lon===
(SA:G)

'''[[Lon Chaney, Sr.]]''' appeared as a silent movie star in ''The Phantom of the Catacombs'', which is probably an analog of our timeline's ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]].''

===Clemens, Samuel===
(HFR, SA:DE)

'''[[Samuel Clemens]]''' does not become famous in this timeline as the novelist, travel writer, and essayist [[Mark Twain]]. Here he has lost his family's valuable land in [[Tennessee]] (as it is now part of an enemy nation).  He settles down with his family in [[San Francisco]] where he becomes the editor of the ''San Francisco Morning Call'',  and is known for his very sarcastic war editorials in the 1880s during the [[Second Mexican War]]. His home is burned by [[British army|British soldiers]] on their way to steal from the [[San Francisco Mint]], and he is briefly suspected of being an enemy agent until Colonel [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] meets with him and determines he is safe. His journalistic work keeps him occupied full-time and he never takes up writing books.

Clemens had a different wife and children in this world than he had in our timeline. Unlike our world, one of his offspring grew up to be a famous [[journalist]]: Ophelia Clemens. It was never revealed whatever happened to his other child, Orion.

===Coolidge, Calvin===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Calvin Coolidge]]''' was the Democratic politician in the early 1900s. He served as the [[governor of Massachusetts]] in the 1910s and 20s, and was elected to the presidency in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. He holds the distinction of being the only man elected [[President of the United States]] never to be inaugurated.

A veteran of the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], Coolidge rose to prominence during his tenure as the governor of Massachusetts during the 1920s. [[United States presidential election, 1928|In 1928, he was the Democratic Party's nominee for president]]. However, as the United States had been experiencing an economic boom under the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President [[Upton Sinclair]], Coolidge was readily portrayed as another regressive Democrat. Despite Coolidge's promises to keep the [[Confederate States]] in check, his lack of accomplishment outside of [[Massachusetts]], worked against him. Although he carried all of the [[New England]] states (including his home and birth states of Massachusetts and [[Vermont]]), [[Kansas]], [[Kentucky]], [[Montana]], [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], he lost that election narrowly to the incumbent Vice President, Socialist [[Hosea Blackford]]. When Coolidge called Blackford to concede the race, he warned him that a "[[bull market]] going as high as it is, will fall". Blackford thought it was just [[:wikt:sour grapes|sour grapes]] and paid no heed. When Coolidge's words [[Stock Market Crash 1929|came true in 1929]] and the Socialists and Blackford were blamed for the crash, he was nominated on the Democratic ticket again in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]] with [[Herbert Hoover]] as his running mate. He won the 1932 election in a landslide. However, on January 5, 1933, President-elect Coolidge suffered a heart attack while shaving and died, less than a month before he would be inaugurated on February 1. (The Coolidge of our history died on the same date, but after he served as president from 1923 to 1929.) Herbert Hoover took his place as President-elect and would go on to be inaugurated as the thirty first [[President of the United States]] on February 1.

===Curley, Jim===
(SA:ID)

Congressman '''[[James Michael Curley|Jim Curley]]''' of [[Massachusetts]] was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party's]] candidate for Vice President in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 election]]. [[Flora Hamburger|Flora Hamburger Blackford]] questioned this choice because of his role in the [[Boston]] Socialist political machine, though she figured the [[Kansas City]] Democratic machine was more corrupt. The Socialist ticket of [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follete]] and Curley lost to the Democratic ticket of [[Thomas E. Dewey]] and [[Harry S. Truman]].

===Custer, George Armstrong===
(HFR, GW:AF-AE:CCH)

In this timeline, '''[[George Custer]]''' was not [[Battle of Little Big Horn|killed fighting Indians in 1876]], as this smaller United States appears to have attempted to salve its wounded national pride following the [[War of Secession]] by unleashing a much larger [[US Army]] upon the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes, thus compressing the conquest of the Great Plains into a much shorter timescale. He served in [[Utah]] and [[Montana]] during the Second Mexican War, where he met [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. His forces helped defeat General [[Charles George Gordon|Charles Gordon]]'s invasion of [[Montana]].  A movement to nominate him to succeed [[James G. Blaine]] as [[US President]] flourished briefly but petered out. In the Great War he was a [[lieutenant general]] in the [[United States Army]] and commanded the First Army forces in [[Tennessee]]. He was personally vain, using peroxide to bleach his grey hair and mustache despite his advanced age. He was concerned about his public image, and was furious when he read the reports on him by [[journalist]] [[Richard Harding Davis]]. As a Great War commander, he was unsuited for [[trench warfare]], insisting on mounting large assaults on enemy lines instead of winning by attrition. However, his strategies were perfectly suited for "barrels," the timeline's term for [[tanks]]. Once they were introduced in force he crafted the "Barrel Roll Offensive," an armored breakthrough which ultimately won the Great War for the U.S.

Following the war, Custer was appointed to command the occupation forces in Canada, where he survived several [[assassination]] attempts, ultimately killing the man who had tried so determinedly to kill him. Custer was forced into retirement following the election of [[Upton Sinclair]] as President; Secretary of War [[Norman Mattoon Thomas]] served him the papers. He died in 1930 and was buried next to Theodore Roosevelt near [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington, West Virginia]], in one of several northern [[Virginia]] counties reassigned to [[West Virginia]] after the Great War. His extraordinarily lengthy career, approximately 60 years in the [[US Army]], is roughly analogous to that of the German general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] in our timeline.

===Custer, Thomas===
(HFR)

'''[[Thomas Custer|Tom Custer]]''', in this timeline, was not killed in 1876 alongside his brother George at [[Battle of the Little Bighorn|Little Big Horn]]. He fought alongside his brother during the Second Mexican War in both [[Utah]] and [[Montana]]. In 1881, Tom was killed during the fighting in Montana; this led to his brother George developing a lifelong hatred of the Canadians.

===Daniels, Josephus===
(GW:AF-GW:B)

Although being of Southern origins, '''[[Josephus Daniels]]''' served as Secretary of the [[U.S. Navy]] during the Great War. A destroyer escort was named after him in the Second Great War.

(It is unknown why he is on the USA's side, and it is commonly believed to be an error on the part of author Harry Turtledove. In actual history, Daniels was born in [[Washington, North Carolina]] to a Unionist family; his father was killed by Confederate artillery in January 1865.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&amp;sp=search&amp;k=Markers&amp;sv=B-24%20-%20JOSEPHUS%20DANIELS&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Southern Victory'' timeline, it may be presumed that the Daniels family moved North after the Union defeat in 1862.)

===Darrow, Clarence===
(AE:CCH)

With no Southern states to [[Scopes Trial|interfere with the teaching of evolution]], '''[[Clarence Darrow]]''' practiced [[criminal law]] in the United States. He was famous enough to convince the State of [[Kentucky]] (and the Kentucky State Police head Luther Bliss) that it was wrong in holding Cincinnatus Driver on trumped-up charges.

===Davis, Richard Harding===
(GW:AF-GW:WH)

'''[[Richard Harding Davis]]''' was a journalist and war correspondent in this timeline as well as ours. He was famous for coverage of the Hispano-Japanese War of 1905, and was a thorn in the side of General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. He died of a heart attack in 1916 observing the trench fighting in the Great War. (In our timeline, he died in the same year of the same cause, but in [[New York City]] instead of a war zone.)

===Debs, Eugene V.===
(GW:B-AE:BI)

Senator '''[[Eugene V. Debs]]''' was one of the first Socialists to be elected to Congress after the split of the Republican Party. He was the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] candidate for President in [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]], [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912]] and [[United States presidential election, 1916|1916]]. He ran unsuccessfully for president against [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in both the 1912 and 1916, and was a strong opponent of U.S. involvement in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].

===Dewey, George===
(GW:AF)

'''[[George Dewey]]''' of [[Vermont]] is the admiral who commands the successful U.S. attack on the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] early the Great War, in 1914. There are passing similarities between this fictional battle and the real [[Battle of Manila Bay]].

Dewey may or may not have commanded the Navy during the Battle of the Three Navies—the commander is never named. If it is not Dewey, it is [[Bradley Fiske]], who evidently succeeded Dewey. It should be noted that Dewey would have been 77 at the time of the Battle, and Fiske was over a decade younger.

===Dewey, Thomas E.===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Thomas Dewey]]''' was governor of New York when he received the Democratic nomination for President in 1944. He and his running mate [[Harry S. Truman]] of [[Missouri]] defeat the incumbent [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. His victory is partially attributed to pointing out that the CSA was able to regain strength and attack the United States on the watch of three Socialist Presidents (conveniently downplaying Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]], who made no efforts to stop the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]).

At his inauguration on February 1, 1945, President Dewey pledged to continue US occupation of the CS with the intention of re-integrating the southern states back into the Union, even though over 82 years had passed since the Confederate States had won its independence in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]] (1861–1862) with the support of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Second French Empire|France]]. He pledged to continue La Follette's policy of racial equality in the armed services. Furthermore, he proposed a continued partnership with the United States' traditional ally, the [[German Empire]], to police the world and prevent the spread of superbomb technology to their former enemies, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]. Given that it was widely believed that Dewey would lose the election, the front-page headline of the November 8, 1944 edition of the [[Chicago Tribune]] inaccurately read "[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follette Defeats Dewey]]". Vice President-elect Truman was photographed holding up a copy of the paper by the media. Dewey was elected at the age of 42, tying the first Socialist president Upton Sinclair (who was elected to the first of two terms in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], defeating the Democratic incumbent [[Theodore Roosevelt]]) as the youngest president in US history. He also held the distinction of being the first president born in the 20th century whereas Sinclair was the first born after the War of Secession.

Dewey's victory might be intended to parallel [[Clement Attlee]]'s surprising landslide victory over [[Winston Churchill]] at the end of the Second World War in our timeline. His U.S.-German partnership is reminiscent of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[Four Policemen]] idea.

===Douglass, Frederick===
(HFR)

'''[[Frederick Douglass]]''' was still trying to tell the United States of the suffering of the [[African-American]] slaves in the Confederacy twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. His pleas were heard only by the small minority of freedmen in the USA and a handful of whites. He also, ironically, becomes one of the first people (in his mind) to approve of the "Revenge" mindset that the United States picked up in the [[How Few Remain|Second Mexican War]] in fighting the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].

===Fields, W.C.===
(SA:DE)

'''[[W.C. Fields]]''' still becomes a film comic, and retains his trademark line "All things considered, I'd rather be in [[Philadelphia]]," perhaps inspired by the city becoming the de facto capital of the U.S.

===Fiske, Bradley===
(GW:B)

'''[[Bradley Fiske]]''' is a rear admiral during the Great War. He is the force commander of the U.S. fleet that assists Chile in its war against Argentina in 1917. He appears briefly to congratulate Sam Carsten and Vic Crosetti for tipping off the military to [[Hawaii]]an spy John Liholiho.

===Foulke, William Dudley===
(HFR, GW:AF)

This American politician, lawyer, and poet appears at the beginning of ''How Few Remain''. Before the war starts '''[[William Dudley Foulke|William Foulke]]''' is an infantry captain of the United States Army. [[Jeb Stuart]] wonders what a stuck-up young man is doing out west. He reappears in 1915 as Irving Morrell's divisional commander in southeastern Kentucky.

===Foxx, Jimmie===
(SA:DE)

Instead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman, '''[[Jimmie Foxx]]''' was a running back in the U.S. football league. His name was used as a password in Irving Morrell's army to identify Confederate spies.

===Garfield, James===
(HFR)

Senator '''[[James Garfield]]''' is one of the Republican Party leaders who gather in [[Chicago]] in 1882 to discuss the party's future. He is more conservative than former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] and wishes not to make the party more radical.

===Gehrig, Lou===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Lou Gehrig]]''' played professional football in this timeline as a member of the [[Philadelphia]] [[tanks|Barrels]] team. When asked about earning more money than [[US President]] [[Hosea Blackford]], he responded, "I had a better year than he did," echoing [[Babe Ruth]]'s comments about [[Herbert Hoover|President Hoover]] in our timeline.

===Goldwater, Barry===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Barry Goldwater]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[New Mexico]] noted for his [[anti-Mormon]] speeches and rabble rousing during the days and months leading up to Second Great War. (Note that the New Mexico of this timeline included [[Arizona]], home to our timeline's Goldwater.)

===Grant, Ulysses S.===
(HFR, AE:BI)

General '''[[Ulysses Grant]]''', in the twenty years after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], is a broken down, poor man. Known for his victories in a war the United States had few in, he was one of the few people left in the United States who supported the plight of [[African-Americans]] in both North American republics. Grant died from complications from [[alcoholism]].

===Greenberg, Hank===
(SA:DE)

Instead of becoming a Hall of Fame first baseman for the [[Detroit Tigers]], '''[[Hank Greenberg]]''' was a prominent U.S. running back. His name was used as a code in Irving Morrell's army to prevent Confederate spies from infiltrating U.S. lines.

===Guffey, Joseph===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Joseph F. Guffey]]''' was the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|U.S. Speaker of the House]] during the Smith and La Follette administrations. When [[Al Smith]] was killed in the Confederate bombing raid of Philadelphia in 1942, Guffey announced the President's death to a joint session of Congress.

===Halsey, William Frederick Jr.===
(SA:RE)

A Rear Admiral of the Southern Shore Squadron, '''[[Bill Halsey]]''' was part of the MacArthur plan to land and attack at the mouth of the [[James River]] until General Abner Dowling contacted the War Department to stop that plan. From Dowling's statement on him, it seems he is as reckless as MacArthur.

===Hamlin, Hannibal===
(HFR)

'''[[Hannibal Hamlin]]''' was [[Vice President of the United States]] under President [[Abraham Lincoln]] from 1861 to 1865. In the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]], and in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], he and Lincoln were defeated in a landslide. Hamlin would later serve as [[United States Secretary of State|secretary of state]] in the [[James G. Blaine]] administration and is chosen to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the conflict leading up to the Second Mexican War, a task in which he was not successful.

In 1882, Hamlin was one of several prominent Republican leaders to attend a convention called by Lincoln at the Florence Hotel in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. He resisted Lincoln's proposal to replace hostility toward the Confederacy with workers' rights as the central plank of the party's platform. The rejection of this proposal led to Lincoln's defection to the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] and the end of the Republican Party as an effective force in American politics.

===Haywood, Bill===
(GW:WH)

Like he was in our timeline, '''[[Bill Haywood|"Big Bill" Haywood]]''' is a [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] bigwig in the U.S. during the Great War. He is introduced to Flora Hamburger by Herman Bruck at a [[May Day]] rally, and eyes her with lust.  Flora doesn't seem to like him, but does acknowledge that he brings a furious energy to the cause that makes him a force to be reckoned with.

===Hemingway, Ernest===
(GW:WH, AE:CCH-AE:VO)

Known only as "Ernie", the novelist '''[[Ernest Hemingway]]''' was an [[ambulance]] driver in the U.S. Army on the [[Québec]] front in the Great War (in our timeline Hemingway drove an ambulance in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] during [[World War I]]), Ernest was strafed by a [[Royal Flying Corps|British aircraft]] and severely wounded in the groin. After the war, his [[impotence]] served as a constant frustration. He ghost-wrote Sylvia Enos' book, ''I Sank Roger Kimball'', and was involved in an affair with his client. He accidentally shoots her when attempting [[suicide]] while he is drunk. He then shoots himself in remorse. (In our timeline, Hemingway lived to 1961, shooting himself to death but no one else.) In the Southern Victory Series,  he never becomes a prominent author—though he does have work published.

===Holmes, Oliver Wendell===
(GW:WH-AE:VO)

'''[[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]]''' becomes Chief Justice of the United States rather than associate justice, as he does in our timeline. He is one of the last surviving [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] veterans and manages to outlive even General [[George Armstrong Custer]]. Holmes is a staunch Democratic supporter, who is very displeased in 1920 at having to administer the oath of office to [[Upton Sinclair]], the first Socialist President. He dies in 1935 (the same year of his death in our timeline) during [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. He is replaced as Chief Justice by Cicero Pittman in time for [[Al Smith]]'s inauguration in 1937.

===Hoover, Herbert===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

'''[[Herbert Hoover]]''' was part of the Coolidge-Hoover Democratic ticket that defeated the Blackford-[[Hiram Johnson|Johnson]] Socialist ticket during the Democratic sweep in [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932]]. When President-Elect [[Calvin Coolidge]] died less than a month before he got into office, Hoover took over. The only thing his term was known for was making the situation in [[Kentucky]], [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]], [[Oklahoma|Sequoyah]], and [[Utah]] worse. He ended the Pacific War with a [[status quo ante bellum]] "peace" with [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and allowed [[Jake Featherston]] to begin rebuilding the [[Confederate Army]] in the face of the "black rebellion". Hoover was also derided for not doing anything to help the [[Great Depression]]. Because of this, the Democrats were defeated with a Socialist sweep the Congressional elections of 1934 and he lost the presidential race to Socialist [[Al Smith]] in [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936]].

===Humphrey, Hubert===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Hubert Humphrey]]''' is referred to as the "[[pharmacist]] from [[Minneapolis]]." He wisely decides not to move his business to [[Rosenfeld, Manitoba]], where the local [[general store]] (owned by an American) had been bombed by Mary MacGregor Pomeroy several years before.

===Johnson, Hiram===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Hiram Johnson]]''' was the Socialist nominee for vice-president in both the [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] and [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 elections]]. He and [[Hosea Blackford]] won the 1928 election over [[Calvin Coolidge]]; the victory was clinched after the Socialists won Johnson's home state of [[California]]. He was present at the Socialist party rally that was held on the same day that [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] raided [[Los Angeles]]. Blackford and Johnson were easily defeated in 1932 by Coolidge and [[Herbert Hoover]].

===Kennedy, Joseph P. Sr.===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)

'''[[Joseph Kennedy]]''', in this timeline, was a Democratic Party [[organizer (party)|organizer]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Although married to [[Rose Kennedy]] and the father of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]], he attempted to seduce Sylvia Enos, who was a minor heroine for killing Roger Kimball, and was campaigning for him at his political rallies.

After the Second Great War, Kennedy helped obtain the discharge of George Enos Jr., from the navy to allow him to return to civilian life.

===Kennedy, Joseph Jr.===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.|Joseph Kennedy, Jr.]]''' is a [[fighter pilot]] serving in the same squadron as Jonathan Moss during Operation [[Blackbeard]]. It is unknown whether he survived the Second Great War. In our timeline, he did not survive [[World War II]].

===La Follette, Robert M.===
(GW:WH)

'''[[Robert M. La Follette]]''' was a Socialist U.S. Senator from [[Wisconsin]]. In 1916, he won re-election handily. His son [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Charles W. La Follette|Charles]] (who is primarily modeled after his real life son [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/HNTurtledove/status/1000485494503849985&lt;/ref&gt;) went on to become a key figure of American history in the 1930s and '40s.

===LaGuardia, Fiorello===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Fiorello LaGuardia]]''' is elected [[governor of New York]] on the Socialist ticket and attends the [[New York City]] Remembrance Day parade shortly before the beginning of the Second Great War.

===Lansing, Robert===
(GW:B)

'''[[Robert Lansing]]''' was the [[United States Secretary of State]] at the conclusion of the Great War in 1917, and was responsible for drafting the terms of the [[peace treaty]] with the [[Confederate States]] and setting policy for Occupied Canada.

===Liggett, Hunter===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Hunter Liggett]]''' replaced General [[Leonard Wood]] as Army Chief of Staff under President [[Upton Sinclair]]. He appeared unenthusiastic about some of the Socialists' more unrealistic policies.

===Lincoln, Abraham===
(HFR, GW:AF)

In this timeline, '''[[Abraham Lincoln]]''' was a one-term president who was defeated in the [[United States presidential election, 1864|1864 election]] in a landslide, and who was generally remembered as a failure. After his presidency, he travels around the country as an [[orator]] advocating for labor rights. In 1881, feeling that the Republican party was no longer true to its original roots, he led a faction of the party to break off and join the [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist Party]] with Marxist activist [[Friedrich Sorge]], which eventually became the major opposition to the Democrats and one of the two main parties in the American political system. After which, he spends the rest of his days in seclusion outside [[Chicago]].

In the prologue of ''Great War: American Front,'' while considering the mediation put forth by British ambassador Richard Lyons, Lincoln makes a solemn vow that the United States would find European allies to someday get even with England and France for their violating of the [[Monroe Doctrine]] and helping of the CSA. Though laughed at by Lyons, his prediction would eventually come true by the Great War.

===Lincoln, Mary Todd===
(HFR)

'''[[Mary Todd Lincoln]]''' was the wife of former President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. As her husband was not assassinated in 1865, she did not suffer from mental illness. In the late 1870s, Mary Lincoln died of typhus.

===Mahan, Alfred Thayer===
(GW:WH)

'''[[Alfred Mahan]]''' was a two-term Democratic president from 1889 to 1897. During his time in office, Mahan threatened to declare war on the Confederate States because of a proposal by the CSA to build a canal in Nicaragua in order to reach their Pacific port in Guaymas, Sonora, without having to travel around South America. After receiving the threat of war, the CSA backed down in their attempt to build the canal. [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Carsten, Sam|Sam Carsten]] mentions that he might be the best President the country had ever had before [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

===Moran, Edward===
(AE:VO)

Congressman '''[[Edward C. Moran, Jr.]]''' of [[Maine]] is a Democrat who debates Flora Blackford on whether or not the United States should interfere with the treatment of blacks in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]].

===Patrick, Mason===
(GW:AF-GW:B)

[[Brigadier General]] '''[[Mason Patrick]]''' was a senior aviator in the [[U.S. Army]] air service and served on the [[Canada|Canadian]] front in the Great War.

===Pershing, John "Black Jack"===
(GW:AF-AE:CCH)

'''[[John Pershing]]''' was commanding general of the US Second Army and rival of [[George Custer]]'s First Army in the Great War. After the Socialist victory over the Democrats, he became [[military governor]] of [[Utah]]. In 1929, a [[Mormon]] sniper killed him, and he was succeeded by Colonel Abner Dowling, erstwhile commandant of [[Salt Lake City]].

===Pitney, Mahlon===
(AE:BI)

Rather than being appointed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in 1912, as he was in our timeline, '''[[Mahlon Pitney]]''' goes to Canada to preside over trials in occupied country.

===Pope, John===
(HFR)

'''[[John Pope (military officer)|John Pope]]''' was the commander of U.S. forces in [[Utah]] during the Second Mexican War. He was responsible for ordering the [[execution]] of several [[Mormon]] leaders during the attempted revolt in Utah. Pope also arrested former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] for allegedly having Mormon sympathies, but President [[James Blaine]] ordered Lincoln's release.

===Reagan, Ronald===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Ronald Reagan]]''', "Dutch", like this timeline's counterpart, was a sports announcer in [[Iowa]] between the wars. His favorite phrase in games is "There he goes again" (similar to one of Reagan's most familiar phrases in our timeline, "[[There you go again]]"). Cincinnatus Driver also describes "Dutch" as a "great communicator", a description applied to the historical Reagan.

===Reed, Thomas Brackett===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Thomas Brackett Reed]]''' was a Democratic president sometime in the late 1890s. Like [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Reed was considered a hero of the Remembrance ideology. Reed entered the United States into a mutual-defense pact with [[Haiti]]. Presumably this helped curb [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] designs in the [[Caribbean]] while at the same time irritating the CS government, which had long desired the destruction of the former slave colony. This pact was reaffirmed by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] during the Great War.

Reed was depicted on a [[United States half dollar coin|fifty-cent coin]] used as currency during the Great War.

===Rickover, Hyman G.===
(SA:ID)

Captain '''[[Hyman G. Rickover]]''', [[U.S. Navy]] testifies before a House of Representatives committee, as an expert on [[submarines]] (as he was in our timeline).  Rickover has the unpleasant task of explaining why the U.S. has not yet built copies of [[German High Seas Fleet]] submarines.

===Rogers, Will===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Will Rogers]]''' is referred to as "that comic from [[State of Sequoyah|Sequoyah]]" (part of [[Oklahoma]] native in the main timeline). As in our timeline, he is quoted as having said, "All I know is what I read in the newspapers."

{{anchor|Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt|Roosevelt, Franklin}}

===Roosevelt, Franklin D.===
(AE:CCH, SA:RE-SA:ID)

'''[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]''' is Secretary of War in the [[Herbert Hoover]] administration and later Assistant Secretary of War under the [[Alfred E. Smith]] and [[Charles La Follette]] Administrations. He is not much in the public eye, but plays a key role being in charge of the United States [[Manhattan Project|nuclear program]] at the [[Hanford site]]. Roosevelt is [[paraplegic]] and uses a [[wheelchair]]. He has a platonic affair with Flora Blackford. There is no mention of his being married in this timeline to [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]. It noted that his son (who goes unnamed) is in the [[US Navy]] during the Second Great War.

===Roosevelt, Theodore===
(HFR-AE:CCH)

'''[[Theodore Roosevelt]]''', called '''Teddy''' or '''TR''' in the press, became a national figure for leading a volunteer cavalry unit, the "Unauthorized Regiment," in the [[Second Mexican War]], during which he developed an intense rivalry with [[George Custer]]. A member of the Democratic Party, he was [[President of the United States]] from 1913 to 1921. Roosevelt was the first president to run for a third term, but he was ultimately defeated by Socialist [[Upton Sinclair]] in [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]]. After he died suddenly of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] while [[golf]]ing in 1924, he was buried at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s house in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] which had been annexed to [[West Virginia]] from [[Virginia]] after the Great War. He died in 1919 in our timeline.

===Rosecrans, William===
(HFR)

'''[[William Rosecrans]]''' was a lead general in the Second Mexican War. He was partly responsible for the U.S. defeat as he admitted to observers on the [[Kentucky]] front that he had no real strategy to defeat the [[Confederate States]].

===Sevareid, Eric===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Eric Sevareid]]''' was a [[radio]] broadcaster for U.S. Wireless [[Atlanta]], which was established after the fall of Atlanta, possibly to counter Confederate Connie. After the death of [[Jake Featherston]], Sevareid was one of the broadcasters who interviewed Cassius Madison.

===Shaw, Robert Gould===
(GW:AF)

Ironically, '''[[Robert Gould Shaw]]''', the man who in our timeline led the [[54th Massachusetts]], one of the first all black regiments in the [[US Civil War]], ends up surviving through the War of Secession, though losing a hand in the process, and lives on until 1914 in [[Boston]]. He was depicted as an elderly [[racist]] with little money.

===Sherman, William T.===
(HFR)

Despite having fought with valor and distinction at the historical [[Battle of Bull Run (disambiguation)|Battles of Bull Run]] and [[Battle of Shiloh|Shiloh]], the victories of '''[[William Tecumseh Sherman]]''' amounted to nothing after the United States' defeat at [[Camp Hill, Glenn Springs, South Carolina|Camp Hill]] and the encirclement of [[Washington, DC]]. Sherman was stripped of his rank of [[brigadier general]] and would never command regular troops again.  Sherman remained in the [[US Army]] and by 1881, he commanded the defences of [[San Francisco]] from his headquarters at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]]. When the Second Mexican War began later that year, Sherman organised volunteers and harbour guns in preparation for any attacks. His efforts were mocked by [[Samuel Clemens]] in his newspaper, the San Francisco ''Morning Call''. Because of this, he investigated Clemens on suspicion that he was a Confederate agent, but found nothing to substantiate it and gave Clemens a letter to that effect.

As the war dragged on, the [[Royal Navy]] of the United Kingdom turned up the pressure against the United States in support of their Confederate ally and attacked San Francisco. In spite of Sherman's preparations, the harbour guns were ineffective and his troops proved inadequate in stopping the [[Royal Marines]] from raiding the [[San Francisco Mint]]. After the raid, Sherman was ridiculed in the city's papers. However, after the cease fire was called, Sherman loudly insisted that with more fortifications, he could make the city impregnable.

===Shirer, William===
(SA:ID)

'''[[William Shirer]]''' is a U.S. broadcaster who interviews Cassius Madison in his tour of the U.S. after killing [[Jake Featherston]].

===Sinclair, Upton===
(AE:BI-AE:VO)

'''[[Upton Sinclair]]''' was the first [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] President. He was elected over [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920 election]] for a number of reasons, including (but not limited to) worker unrest, outrage at Roosevelt's decision to run for a third term, and the public's general exhaustion with the Remembrance ideology. His first acts were to slash the military budget, force [[George Custer|General Custer]] into retirement and enact new labor laws. He was re-elected in [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]], where he and the Socialist Party take credit for the [[Roaring Twenties]] prosperity. Sinclair declined to run for a third term in [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]] and was succeeded in office by his Vice President, [[Hosea Blackford]], who defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic candidate]] [[Calvin Coolidge]] by a narrow margin.

===Smith, Al===
(AE:VO-SA:RE)

'''[[Al Smith]]''' is elected as the third Socialist (and first [[Catholic]]) President in the [[United States presidential election, 1936|1936 election]], defeating Democrat [[Herbert Hoover]]. He is known as the "Happy Warrior" since he tries everything to keep the United States out of war with [[Jake Featherston]]'s [[Confederate States]], including the infamous Richmond Agreement, helping to gain him re-election over [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]] in [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]]. All of Smith's efforts simply delay the inevitable; Featherston scraps any agreement with Smith and once again demands territorial concession.  Smith refuses, touching off the Second Great War in June, 1941 (in an operation patterned after OTL's [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Smith is killed in his second term (1942) when Confederate bombers blew up parts of [[Powel House]] and destroy his [[bunker]].

Smith shares parallels with [[Neville Chamberlain]], who attempted, but failed, to prevent war in our timeline with a [[fascist]] regime through the use of [[appeasement]].

===Smith, Kate===
(SA:G)

'''[[Kate Smith]]''' was a famous U.S. singer in this timeline as well as ours. In 1943, she sang "[[God Bless America|God Bless the Stars and Stripes]]" with backing by [[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces.

===Sousa, John Philip===
(GW:AF and AE:BI)

The marches of '''[[John Philip Sousa]]''' in this timeline were very popular in the United States. The Socialists despised him as a tool who substituted nationalist desires for vengeance for the class struggle, but respected his talents.

===Stassen, Harold===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Harold Stassen]]''' was peripherally mentioned as "the governor of [[Minnesota]]" as the Republican Party's candidate for President in the [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944 election]], carrying electoral votes from the four states of [[Minnesota]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Kansas]], and [[Indiana]] in a three-way race against Socialist [[Charles M. LaFollette|Charles W. La Follette]] and Democrat [[Thomas E. Dewey]].

===Stedman, Seymour===
(AE:BI)

'''[[Seymour Stedman]]''' was a Socialist Congressman from [[Ohio]]. In the Socialist-majority Congress of 1919, he was elected [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. Stedman became the first non-Democrat since 1881 to be elected as Speaker.

===Sutro, Adolph===
(HFR)

'''[[Adolph Sutro]]''' is still the mayor of [[San Francisco]], [[California]] as in our timeline. His mayorship was heavily criticized for incompetence, particularly after the British [[Royal Navy]] bombarded the city and [[Royal Marines]] raided the [[San Francisco Mint]].  Sutro was a supporter of President [[James G. Blaine]] and designed several outlandish security measures to protect San Francisco (which was an extremely low priority target) from attack during the Second Mexican War. Ironically, when the British did attack the city, the defenses Sutro proposed proved worthless.

One of Sutro's most vocal critics was [[Samuel Clemens]], who named his dog Sutro as an insult to the mayor.

===Taft, Robert===
(AE:VO, SA:DE-SA:G)

'''[[Robert A. Taft]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Ohio]] who ran against [[Al Smith]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 presidential election]]. Taft was narrowly defeated running his campaign on an anti-Freedom Party line and the refusal to permit the states of [[Kentucky]] and [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] to hold a [[plebiscite]] to return to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]. During the Second Great War, he and former rival Flora Blackford (who had known [[William H. Taft|his father]] before him) became fast friends and political allies as Flora became more hawkish as the war went on. Taft died in 1943, a victim of a [[Mormon]] [[suicide bomber]] in [[Philadelphia]].

===Taft, William Howard===
(GW:B-AE:BI)

'''[[William Howard Taft]]''' was a Democratic Congressman from [[Ohio]] who served on the Transportation Committee during the later days of the Great War. He was on the same committee as Socialist congresswoman Flora Hamburger, and the two frequently disagreed on many political issues. His son [[Robert A. Taft]] became an important ally of hers during the Second Great War.

===Thomas, Norman===
(AE:BI-AE:CCH)

'''[[Norman Thomas|N. Mattoon Thomas]]''' served as Undersecretary of War in the [[Upton Sinclair]] Administration, often as Sinclair's hatchet man. He was responsible for informing General [[George A. Custer]] of his forced retirement and for closing down the [[tank|Barrel]] Works.

===Tilden, Samuel J.===
(HFR)

'''[[Samuel Tilden]]''' was [[President of the United States]] from 1877 to 1881. He was nominated by the Democrats for [[United States presidential election, 1880|reelection in 1880]], but lost to Republican [[James G. Blaine]]. Tilden was defeated for not taking a hard line against the Confederate States and for ordering the removal of twelve stars (representing the former Union states in the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]]) from the U.S. flag.

===Truman, Harry===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Harry Truman]]''' was a Democratic Senator from [[Missouri]] who was selected by [[New York Governor]] [[Thomas E. Dewey]] as the Democratic VP candidate in [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]]. The Dewey-Truman ticket defeated the incumbent President [[Charles M. La Follette|Charles W. La Follette]]. In announcing the Democratic victory, Truman had a copy of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' that had the inaccurate headline "[[Dewey Defeats Truman|La Follete Beats Dewey]]". Truman made an appearance in occupied [[Florida]] to speak to U.S. soldiers before his inauguration as Vice President. He made it clear to the locals that the United States would be firm in the former Confederate States, but that they would be no firmer than needed, and that if they worked together they could one day be part of the same country once again.

===Voorhis, Jerry===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Jerry Voorhis]]''' was the United States ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] prior to the start of the Second Great War. After delivering news to [[Jake Featherston]] that U.S. president [[Al Smith]] refused the latest C.S. territorial demands, the C.S. president told Voorhis to leave the country within 24 hours; soon after this meeting, Featherston authorized the commencement of Operation [[Blackbeard]].

===Wallace, Henry===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Henry A. Wallace]]''' was [[US Secretary of the Interior]] under [[Al Smith]]. He was one of the few people who knew of the United States' plans to develop [[nuclear weapons]] during the Second Great War.

===Wayne, John===
(AE:VO)

'''[[John Wayne]]''' is an actor known in this world under his real name, Marion Morrison. He played [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in a movie that recounted the details of the Battle of [[Montana]] in ''How Few Remain''.

===Willkie, Wendell===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Wendell Willkie]]''' was the Republican nominee for president in the [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940 election]], both in this timeline and our history. As the Republicans had become a third party in this timeline, Willkie was not considered to seriously contend for the presidency. On election day, he only carried the electoral votes from his home state of [[Indiana]] and came in third after [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] incumbent [[Al Smith]] and the Democratic challenger [[Robert A. Taft|Robert Taft]]. Ironically, Willkie's slogan was "Win With Wendell".

===Winchell, Walter===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Walter Winchell]]''' was a news reporter from [[New York City]] who was one of those to interview Cassius Madison after he shot [[Jake Featherston]]. During his interview with Winchell, Cassius found his accent difficult to understand.

===Wood, Leonard===
(GW:AF-GW:B)

General '''[[Leonard Wood]]''' was Chief of the General Staff of the U.S. Army during the Great War.

===Yount, Barton K.===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Barton Kyle Yount]]''' is a [[United States Army]] [[major general (United States)|major general]], and as the Second Great War ends, he commands what is possibly the largest air training center in the world, just outside of [[Dayton, Ohio]]. He offers Jonathan Moss the opportunity to train to fly [[jet aircraft|turbo aircraft]]. Moss gladly takes him up on his offer.

==Confederate States==

===Arango, Doroteo===
(GW:AF-GW:WH, AE:BI)

During the Great War, '''[[Pancho Villa|Doroteo Arango]]''' (known by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' "Pancho Villa" in our timeline) was the Radical Liberal presidential candidate in the 1915 election. He promised he would fight the war against the United States even harder than [[Woodrow Wilson]] did. He is also the first non-white candidate to seriously run for the presidency of the Confederacy and showed the wartime strains on the ruling Whig Party, as the war dragged on and the United States' numbers and the Red Rebellion started to strain the Confederates. He was not opposed due to his ethnicity (Mixed "Mestizo" Mexican), only his political views. The [[Mexican Revolution]] in which our timeline's Pancho Villa had a major role has its counterpart in the Republican revolt against the [[Habsburg]] Emperors of this timeline's [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]], which is crushed with the help of Freedom Party stalwarts. However, in the Confederate-annexed parts of Mexico, it is the Freedom Party itself which mobilises the peasants to overthrow the centuries-old rule of the big landowners.

===Benjamin, Judah===
(HFR)

'''[[Judah P. Benjamin]]''' was [[Confederate States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Jefferson Davis]], and served in the Cabinets of many others of the Confederacy's first generation of leaders. He led his country's diplomatic efforts in the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]. During the presidency of [[James Longstreet]], Judah Benjamin was the ambassador to the United States. Despite his best efforts, he was not able to prevent the [[Second Mexican War]] of 1881–82.

During the closing days of the Second Mexican War, Benjamin became aware that Senator [[Wade Hampton III]] was attempting to recruit support for a coup should Longstreet go through with his plans to end slavery. He also knew that Hampton had unsuccessfully attempted to recruit [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas Jackson]], a fact which surprised Jackson.

===Black, Hugo===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Hugo Black]]''' was the Whig Party's Vice-Presidential nominee in 1933 during the Freedom electoral sweep. He ran with [[James Longstreet]]'s grandson [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Samuel Longstreet|Samuel Longstreet]], and was caught in a riot against Freedom Party stalwarts during the 1933 Election Riots. The Longstreet-Black ticket lost in a landslide to the [[Jake Featherston|Featherston]]-Knight ticket. This defeat made it the first Presidential election in Confederate history where the Whig candidates lost.

===Castro, Fidel===
(SA:G)

Known by his first name only, '''[[Fidel Castro]]''' is a young leader of an anti-Freedom Party group in Confederate Cuba, working closely with the United States which sends him clandestine shipments of arms and ammunition.

===Carter, Jimmy===
(SA:DE)

A [[Confederate Navy]] sailor, '''[[Jimmy Carter]]''' (1924-1942) was on leave and found himself informally in charge of the defense of his hometown of [[Plains, Georgia]] when the black rebels raided the town. He was killed by Jonathan Moss in front of his mother, "[[Lillian Gordy Carter|Miss Lillian]]". In our timeline, he remains alive in 2018.

===Chapman, Ben===
(AE:VO)

Instead of becoming notorious in the [[baseball]] world for his attitude towards [[Jackie Robinson]], '''[[Ben Chapman (baseball)|Ben Chapman]]''' serves in the Freedom Party guards as a Chief Assault Band Leader (a captain in Army ranking). His first and only appearance in the books is when he shows up at Camp Dependable in the dead of night to drop off [[Willy Knight]] as a political prisoner.

{{anchor|Nathan Bedford Forrest III}}

===Forrest, Nathan Bedford III===
(AE:VO-SA:ID)

A great-grandson of [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] was the head of the Confederate General Staff. Instead of airplane warfare, '''[[Nathan Bedford Forrest III]]''', was a [[tank|barrel]] expert. Forrest was valued by [[Jake Featherston]] because he was unafraid to tell the President the truth about how the war was going, instead of being a "yes man" and only telling him what he wanted to hear. When an increasingly stubborn Featherston rejects Forrest's advice to cut short the [[Pittsburgh]] Campaign, thus dooming [[George Patton]]'s entire army of irreplaceable veterans to death or surrender, he begins plotting with Clarence Potter based on concerns about Featherston's sanity and whether new leadership was needed, for Forrest fears a Confederate loss and what the Yankees would do if they defeated the Confederacy again.

With the Confederate war effort collapsing, Forrest attempted to execute a coup to oust Featherston in 1944, analogous to the [[July 20 Plot]], but was thwarted by the President. Forrest never revealed that he had ever discussed the failed coup with Potter. Eventually, Forrest was killed off for his attempt.

===Hope, Bob===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Bob Hope]]''' is a comic seen entertaining the troops in Occupied [[Ohio]]. He was booed offstage for his non realistic war jokes and for not being "[[Satchmo]] and the Rhythm Aces".

===Howard, Robert E.===
(AE:CCH)

The Conan the Barbarian creator is an unnamed reference in a Jefferson Pinkard chapter as a contributor to Aeroplane Adventures. The book references a young Texan author from Cross Plains where Howard lives for most of his short life; in reality this would have been around the time he wrote ‘The Shadow Kingdom’, which was published in Weird Times.

===Jackson, Thomas J. "Stonewall"===
(HFR)

Because of the Confederate victory in 1862, '''[[Stonewall Jackson]]''' did not die in 1863 as he did in our timeline. In the twenty years from the [[US Civil War|War of Secession]] to the Second Mexican War, Jackson became the head of the Confederate General Staff in the [[James Longstreet]] Administration. His brilliant tactics in the Second Mexican War led to victory for the Confederacy. Also critical to the Confederate cause was his decision to let the captured [[Frederick Douglass]] go free, after a memorable debate between the two showing some grudging mutual respect - a decision which eventually helped the Confederacy cement British and [[Third French Republic|French]] support for its cause. Subsequently, Jackson refused [[Wade Hampton III]]'s proposal to lead a coup against Longstreet after Longstreet began steps to end slavery.

His face appeared on the Confederate five-dollar coin, which naturally came to be called a "Stonewall".

===Lamar, Lucius Q. C.===
(HFR)

'''[[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)|Lucius Lamar]]''' is the vice president of the Confederate States under his cousin [[James Longstreet]]. It is mentioned that Lamar would have acted as president should anything have happened to President Longstreet while he visited the war front in [[Kentucky]].

===Lee, Robert E.===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Robert E. Lee]]''' is the Confederacy's military hero. It is his decision to invade [[Maryland]], and the complete failure of Union general [[George B. McClellan|George McClellan]] to respond that allows the CS to gain military victory, and receive recognition as a country from Britain and France.

Lee appears briefly in the prologue of GW:AF, which is set in 1862. He is heavily referenced throughout the series.

In AE:CCH, we learn that a man named 'Lee' was president. As Robert E. Lee was never said to have been president in the prior volumes, nor so described in subsequent volumes, a debate has developed among fans of the series, with some arguing that Robert E. was president, while others favor his more political nephew, [[Fitzhugh Lee]].

There is one apparent difference between Turtledove's character and the historic Lee. In our timeline, Lee became the president of Washington College in [[Lexington, Virginia]] immediately after the Civil War. He served in that role until his death in 1870, at which time the college adopted its current name of [[Washington and Lee University]]. In the Southern Victory Series, the college never added Lee's name—it is referenced in several books in the series as Washington University.

===Long, Earl===
(AE:VO)

After the assassination of their sibling, we learn that one of Governor [[Huey Long]]'s brothers is involved in some sort of machine gun "accident" and the other is imprisoned at "Camp Dependable" outside Alexandria, Louisiana for his brother's non-Freedom Party politics. Although in our timeline Huey Long had three brothers, George, Julius and '''[[Earl Long]]''', in the Southern Victory Series he has only two.

===Long, Huey===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

In this timeline, '''[[Huey Long]]''' was a Radical Liberal governor of [[Louisiana]] in the [[Confederate States]]. Like [[Jake Featherston]], he used strong-arm tactics to suppress opposition and control that state, erected prison camps for political opponents, but did not resort to anti-black [[racist]] demagoguery. He proved to be a danger to the Freedom Party in the 1932 elections and afterwards, where the Freedom Party was under attack in his state, and planned to run for president once Featherston ended his term (at the time, the clause in the Confederate constitution restricting a president to a single term was still in force). He was later killed by an assassin of the Freedom Party in 1938 after getting a warning about not following Jake Featherston's orders from [[Anne Colleton]]. (He lived 3 years longer than he did in our timeline.) This assassination allowed Featherston to have the entire Confederacy under his control. The conquest of Louisiana from Long and his followers is roughly the analogue of [[Hitler]]'s Austrian [[Anschluss]].

===Longstreet, James===
(HFR)

'''[[James Longstreet]]''' was a victorious Confederate general turned president of the CSA serving 1880-1886. Although having a reputation as being an opportunist, his term was known for the second defeat of the United States in the Second Mexican War and the [[manumission]] of the [[slaves]] as the price of British and French alliance for help in the Second Mexican War. Longstreet also prevented, with [[Stonewall Jackson]]'s help, a planned rebellion by [[Wade Hampton III]].

===Mahon, George===
(AE:VO)

'''[[George H. Mahon|George Mahon]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from the State of [[Texas Panhandle|Houston]] who was among the Congressmen (from Houston and [[Kentucky]]) who demanded that plebiscites be held in order to return to the Confederate States (Houston had joined the U.S. in 1917). He eventually got his wish, and on January 7, 1941, Houston, along with Kentucky, was returned to the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] by popular vote, and was restored to the state of [[Texas]].

===McReynolds, James Clark===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO)

'''[[James Clark McReynolds]]''' was the last Chief Justice of the Confederate Supreme Court. He played a key role in the ruling allowing Burton Mitchel to run again out of fear of the Freedom Party after the Hampton assassination. Later he was noted for his battles in the early months of the first [[Jake Featherston]] administration, most importantly the "torpedoing" of the River and Dam Act. (This is roughly analogous to the opposition of McReynolds to much of [[Franklin Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] legislation in our timeline.) This led to the Featherston Administration finding a way to abolish the Supreme Court before it could strike down any more Freedom laws, (analogous to FDR's "Court Packing" plan in our timeline) and because Featherston wanted to settle accounts with the Court for its allowing Mitchel to run for re-election.

Attorney General Ferdinand Koenig pounced on the precedent of the CSA not having a Supreme Court for the first five years of existence, and forced McReynolds to admit to the legality of that precedent as prelude to having the Supreme Court knocked down, to great fanfare across the Confederacy's white population. Threatened with his life by Featherston if he trifled with the abolition of the Supreme Court, McReynolds retired into private life. The Confederate president then went on the [[radio]] to declare: "James McReynolds has made his decision, now let him enforce it!" (echoing [[Worcester v. Georgia#Jackson's response|a quote attributed to Andrew Jackson]] following an 1832 U.S. Supreme Court decision).

===Patman, Wright===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Wright Patman]]''' was the [[Governor of Texas]] during the Second Great War. In 1944, with the U.S. close to defeating the [[Confederate States of America|C.S.]], Patman seceded his state from the Confederacy and declared an independent [[Republic of Texas]] with himself as President. His first act was to obtain an armistice with the U.S., who immediately recognized his nation, although they continued stationing large numbers of soldiers there. To win brownie points with his new overlords, he turned over all Confederate [[war criminals]] that could be found in Texas, including [[Jefferson Pinkard]], for [[crimes against humanity]] trials.

===Patton, George S.===
(SA:RE-SA:ID)

General '''[[George S. Patton]]''', [[C.S. Army]], was in charge of the Confederate armored forces (Army of [[Kentucky]]) in Operation [[Blackbeard]] in [[Ohio]] and the attack on [[Pittsburgh]]. He had many of the same character traits as our timeline's Patton: strict attention to detail in a soldier's appearance, high standards and a short temper, highly-effective use of armor, and a seemingly-limitless drive and energy that inspired great confidence among the soldiers serving under him and made him an outstanding commander. But Patton in this timeline is also a different man known to us: instead of being the first American general to integrate his combat formations, this Patton is an unabashed racist and strong supporter of the Freedom Party.

Patton was evacuated from the pocket at Pittsburgh before it fell in February 1943. He unsuccessfully tried to hold the U.S. Army out of Kentucky and [[Tennessee]]. This included an [[George S. Patton slapping incidents|incident]] where he slapped a soldier suffering from [[Combat stress reaction|battle fatigue]]. He would have shot the soldier save that other soldiers around them threatened to shoot Patton on the spot. He was reprimanded for this incident by President [[Jake Featherston]], who promised the average soldier a fair shake. Patton intensely disliked Brigadier General Clarence Potter and would have fought him in a duel had Featherston not forbidden it.

Patton was a fierce and aggressive commander, but as the war turned against the Confederate States, Patton's instincts to attack every chance he got largely succeeded only in squandering men and materiel that the Confederacy could not easily replace. Patton's aggressiveness was checked by General [[Irving Morrell]], a punning reference to the real Patton's African contest with [[Erwin Rommel]]. When he switched tactics to fight a delaying action in [[Chattanooga]], he was bypassed by a U.S. airborne assault on the hills overlooking the city. Because of this, the U.S. drove to [[Atlanta]], disgracing him in Jake Featherston's eyes.

By 1944, Patton was forced to flee Atlanta and head into [[Alabama]]. With the U.S. ravaging his army, Patton was eventually forced to surrender in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. After giving a farewell address to his forces, his men crowded around to say their own goodbyes, an act which moved Patton to tears. He was subsequently taken in as a prisoner of war.

Note: Though a [[Virginia]]n in the Southern Victory timeline, in our timeline Patton was born in [[California]]. In our timeline, General Patton's father, [[George S. Patton (attorney)|George William Patton]], was born in Virginia before Civil War, later moved to California in 1877. General Patton's grandfather, [[George S. Patton, Sr.]] was a Confederate colonel from Virginia killed in 1864 (an event which would not have happened in the alternate timeline). Because of Confederate won the Civil War in this timeline, General Patton's father wasn't likely to move to California, which is a Northern territory. With a Virginian military family background, it is highly possible that General Patton play the role as a Confederate General in an alternative world which Confederate won.

===Russell, Richard Brevard Jr.===
(AE:VO)

'''[[Richard Brevard Russell, Jr.]]''' was the Confederate Ambassador to the United States before the Second World War. He was kicked out of the U.S. after President [[Jake Featherston]] kicked out the Confederacy's U.S. ambassador [[Jerry Voorhis]] from the C.S. as well.

{{anchor|Sennacherib_.28.22Satchmo.22.29|Louis Armstrong|Satchmo}}

===Satchmo===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:G)

Known in the Southern Victory world as '''Sennacherib ("Satchmo")''', [[Louis Armstrong]] in the [[Confederate States]], during the rise of the Freedom Party and the Featherston Administration, was the leader of the popular band "Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces". He was forced by the Confederate government during Second Great War to play for Confederate troops in Ohio. Satchmo and his band were able to escape to U.S. lines at night after one of their shows. In ''[[Drive to the East]]'', Satchmo and his band share the horrors of the Featherston government's treatment of [[African-Americans]] with Flora Blackford.  Subsequently, Satchmo and the Rhythm Aces produce [[propaganda]] for the U.S., although their style of music, unknown outside of the C.S., is a bit of a mystery to the average U.S. citizen.

===Stuart, James Ewell Brown===
(HFR)

Because of the CSA's victory in 1862, '''[[Jeb Stuart]]''' did not die in 1864 [[Battle of Yellow Tavern|as he did in history]]. During the Second Mexican War, General Stuart arrived in the former [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexican]] provinces of [[Sonora]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] in order to ease their transition into C.S. territories (later states). After joining forces with [[Geronimo]] for raids on [[Arizona|western New Mexico]], Stuart was killed by an [[Apache]] [[sniper]] near the close of the war in 1882. His son Jeb Stuart Jr. (a person who had never known his father in real life) later became head of the Confederate War Department, and his (fictionalized) grandson Jeb Stuart III was a battery command officer on the [[Virginia]] front in the Great War.

J.E.B Stuart III once prevented Army intelligence from interrogating his manservant.  Later it was revealed that this servant had been a spy and a [[communist]] rebel. Stuart was humiliated, and assured by many that he would never rise above the rank of captain, despite his father's position in the war department. Destroyed, Stuart decided glory was all he had left, and died leading a charge across No Man's land.

This would greatly impact history, because it was [[Jake Featherston]] who had reported the man servant, and Stuart's father blamed him for his son's humiliation.  He ensured that Featherston also was never promoted, which infuriated Featherston forever after, leading him to write his infamous book ''Over Open Sights'', and later to purge the old military upon his ascension to [[President of the Confederate States]].  After that point, promotion and rank in the new army was based solely on talent and loyalty, which unfortunately for the United States, worked very well in the opening months of Operation [[Blackbeard]].

=== Stuart, James Ewell Brown, Jr. ===
(HFR, AE:BI, AE:VO)

It is debatable whether "Jeb Stuart Jr." in this series is a historical character or a fictional one, see his article on [[Fictional characters in the Southern Victory Series#Stuart, Jeb Jr.|a different page]].

===Thurmond, Strom===
(SA:RE)

'''[[Strom Thurmond]]''' was a Freedom Party Congressman from [[South Carolina]]. He is as conservative in this timeline as he was in ours. His name is never mentioned, but the viewpoint character [[Anne Colleton]] thinks of him as "Storm, or something like that." Good on the "[[Negro]] question, but weaker elsewhere" was the view expressed of him by Anne, who was killed during the June 1941 [[U.S. navy]] raid on [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] just after Thurmond gave a speech. It is unknown whether Thurmond was killed in the same raid.

===Walker, George Herbert===
(SA:DE)

[[Confederate Secretary of State]] during the Featherston Administration, '''[[George Herbert Walker]]''' is probably one of the few remaining old-liners to remain from the Whig Era into the Freedom Regime, since he is not considered to be part of the Freedom Party inner circle by Featherston. Walker is placed in charge of obtaining more soldiers from [[Second Mexican Empire|Mexico]] to aid the Confederacy after General Morrell's attacks destroyed the first three divisions in the 1942 U.S. offensive in [[Ohio]].

This is a little bit implausible, as Walker was from [[Missouri]] and his father [[David Davis Walker]] was from [[Illinois]], neither of which were Confederate states in this timeline or ours.

===Wilson, Woodrow===
(GW:AF-GW:WH)

'''[[Woodrow Wilson]]''' was [[President of the Confederate States of America|President of the Confederate States]] from 1910 to 1916 on the Whig Party. He led the [[Confederate States of America|CSA]] to war with the United States in the summer of 1914, following the US declaration of war on the Confederacy.

==Native Americans==

===Geronimo===
(HFR)

'''[[Geronimo]]''' led a band of [[Apache]] warriors into an alliance with [[Jeb Stuart]]'s army during the Second Mexican War. The alliance would not outlast the war. He led a rebellion against the Confederates following a dispute in territory occupied in [[New Mexico]]. During this, one of Geronimo's men shot and killed Stuart, which consequently led the Confederate Army to all but wipe the Apache tribes out.

==Mormons==

===Taylor, John===
(HFR)

The [[Mormon]] leader '''[[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]]''' takes the opportunity to try to force the United States to recognize the believers' right to [[Mormonism and polygamy|practice]] [[polygamy]]. However, with the use of the new [[Gatling gun]] his rebellion is quickly crushed and he becomes a fugitive, facing death along with the other Mormon leaders if he is caught. The Union army places a price on his head, but he is never captured.

==Canada==

===Borden, Robert===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Robert Borden]]''' becomes [[Prime Minister of Canada]] during the Great War years in both our history and Turtledove's novels. When Canada was ceded to the U.S. after the war, his government was ejected from the occupied territory.

==United Kingdom==

===Churchill, Winston===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-SA:ID)

'''[[Winston Churchill]]''', in this timeline as in the real one, was the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]]. He leads his nation into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] on what appears to be a platform of rearmament, restoration of the [[British Empire|British Empire's]] former borders, and a military alliance with France and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] aimed at reversing the [[German Empire|German Empire's]] dominant position in the world.

Although he was a member of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], his government's actions were strongly influenced by Silver Shirt leader [[Oswald Mosley]], who wielded much greater power and influence in the right-leaning revanchist Britain. In our timeline Mosley's [[British Union of Fascists]] were known as [[Blackshirts]], though Turtledove may be referencing the American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh]] Baby case. It is unknown how his half-American heritage has influenced his relationship with the U.S. or whether his mother was still [[Jennie Jerome]], born in the [[Cobble Hill, Brooklyn|Cobble Hill]] section of [[Brooklyn]].

Churchill authorized the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] attack on [[Hamburg]], and retaliated to the German superbomb attacks on [[London]], [[Norwich]], and [[Brighton]] by sending a plane with a second superbomb to attack Germany. However, the plane was shot down over Belgium and landed and detonated harmlessly between [[Bruges]] and [[Ghent, Belgium|Ghent]], all but ending Britain's chances to defeat Germany. Churchill was then ousted as Prime Minister in a no-confidence vote, and was succeeded by [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], who sought a cease-fire with Germany.

===Edward VIII===
(SA:ID)

With relations between the U.S. and the United Kingdom so bad in this timeline, '''[[Edward VIII]]''' never meets [[Wallis Simpson]], and so never abdicates his throne.  He is still the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|king of the United Kingdom]] when [[German Empire|Germany]] drops a [[Nuclear weapon|superbomb]] on [[London]]. Sam Carsten guesses that Edward VIII and his family got out of London even before the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] hit [[Hamburg]], knowing that the Germans would strike back.

===George V===
(AE:BI)
'''[[George V]]''' was the King of the United Kingdom during the Great War. He was the last British monarch to hold a number of titles afforded to the ruler of the [[British Empire]], including the King of Ireland and the [[Monarch of Canada|King of Canada]], both of which he was forced to relinquish by the victorious [[Central Powers]].

During the Great War, he relinquished all German titles and styles on behalf of his relatives who were British subjects; and changed the name of the royal house from [[Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] to [[House of Windsor|Windsor]]. In the face of the United Kingdom's defeat in 1917, this act was token at best.

[[Jake Featherston]] derisively compared [[Wade Hampton V]] to the British King during the 1921 Confederate States Presidential Election, a somewhat provocative act considering how staunchly Britain had supported the Confederate States.

Upon his death on 20 January 1936 (the date of the death of the historic George V), he was succeeded by his oldest son [[Edward VIII]], who led the United Kingdom to defeat at the hands of the Central Powers in the Second Great War.

===Halifax, Lord===
(SA:ID)

'''[[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]]''' was the British ambassador to the [[Confederate States]] during the Second Great War. He presented to [[C.S. President]] [[Jake Featherston]] materials on the British [[atomic bomb|superbomb]] project, which possibly helped the Confederacy develop their own superbomb.

{{anchor|Lyons, Richard}}

===Lyons, Richard Bickerton Pemell===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Richard Lyons, 1st Viscount Lyons|Richard Lyons]]''' was a British diplomat who was sent to Washington after the Battle of Camp Hill to advise [[Abraham Lincoln]] that the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and [[Second French Empire|France]] were set to offer recognition to the Confederate States, and that if the U.S. did not do the same, Britain would defend the C.S. by use of its military. Lord Lyons also envisioned a time where both the U.S. and C.S. would "stand together, [as] a pair of sturdy brothers," which never happened at any point of the Confederacy's independence between 1861 and 1944.

===Mosley, Oswald===
(AE:CCH-AE:VO, SA:ID)

'''[[Oswald Mosley]]''' is the leader of the Silver Shirts, a fascist movement analogous to the [[British Union of Fascists]] (Turtledove conflates two OTL movements: Mosley's historical BUF, also known as the Blackshirts; and the [[Silver Legion of America|Silver Shirts]], an American fascist group linked to [[Bruno Hauptmann]] and the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|Lindbergh Baby case]]). Mosley and several members of the Union gain seats in the British parliament, creating an influential minority. In an attempt to stifle them, the Conservative Party formed a coalition with the Silver Shirts. However, this actually gave more power to the Silver Shirts. The fact that the Conservatives under the leadership of [[Winston Churchill]] had taken a revanchist just insured that the coalition left both parties indistinguishable. Churchill named Mosley [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] to mollify the Silver Shirts. During the later conflict with [[German Empire|Germany]] in 1941, Mosley was also given a position as Minister of War.

Shortly after Germans shot down a British plane carrying the second British superbomb in Belgium in 1944, he was ousted as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a non-confidence vote.

===Victoria===
(HFR)

As in our history, '''[[Queen Victoria|Victoria]]''' was the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the United Kingdom and the [[British Empire]] from 1837 until her death in 1901.

During her reign, Victoria's Empire intervened twice in North America within 20 years. The first time was in 1862 after the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] destroyed the [[Army of the Potomac]] and occupied [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], the [[British Empire]] (along with [[Second French Empire|France]]) extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]], ending the [[American Civil War|War of Succession]]. The second time was in 1881 when the British Empire once again sided with the Confederacy and [[French Third Republic|France]] against the United States during the [[Second Mexican War]], after both a promise from the Confederacy to [[manumit]] their [[slaves]], and in response to the aggressive behavior from the United States.

===Wilson, Horace===
(SA:ID)

'''[[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]]''' became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] in 1944 in the wake of the ouster of [[Winston Churchill]] in a no-confidence vote. His first act as Prime Minister was to ask [[German Empire|Germany]] for a cease-fire.

==France==

===Duchamp, Marcel===
(GW:AF)

'''[[Marcel Duchamp]]''', in this timeline, is still a famous French artist, but this time his appeal in North America is limited to the upper-crust of the Confederacy. He tried to have an affair with [[Anne Colleton]], who exhibited some of his works at Marshlands [[plantations in the American South|Plantation]]. His works were all removed before [[Marxist]] rebel Cassius and his gang burned the mansion, and Cassius regretted not being able to destroy any Duchamp paintings, which he saw as eyesores.

===Foch, Ferdinand===
(HFR)

'''[[Ferdinand Foch]]''' is a major, the [[Third French Republic|French]] Military Attaché to [[Washington, DC]], at the onset of the Second Mexican War. With his [[German Empire|German]] opposite number [[Alfred von Schlieffen]], and an unnamed British army captain, he accompanies [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hannibal Hamlin]] and Captain Saul Berryman ([[U.S. Army]]) under a flag of truce to the [[Long Bridge (Potomac River)|Long Bridge]] outside Washington D.C. The truce, called by [[C.S. President]] [[James Longstreet]] and C.S. General [[Thomas J. "Stonewall" Jackson]], is designed to declare Washington D.C. an [[open city]], sparing its destruction.  The Confederate proposal is rejected by Berryman, under the authority of U.S. Commanding General [[William Rosecrans]].  The French and British are declared ''[[personae non gratae]]'' and asked to leave the United States.

===Napoleon III===
(HFR and GW:AF)

'''[[Napoleon III]]''' installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]] in the 1860s, a move opposed by the United States under the [[Monroe Doctrine]]. His government was hostile to the United States, and in late 1862, during the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], despite opposition to slavery, Napoleon III extended diplomatic recognition to the [[Confederate States]] and supported [[British Military]] protection over that country, thus beginning an alliance between France and the CS that would continue through the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] over eighty years later. This eventually turned out to have been a major strategic blunder for which France paid a heavy price, since it threw the United States into the arms of [[German Empire|Germany]] in a rival alliance which triumphed in both the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] and the Second Great War.

Ultimately, Napoleon was forced to abdicate in 1870 during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He was also the last [[Monarchy of France|Monarch of France]] until King Charles XI under the [[Action Francaise]] party restored the monarchy around 1930.

==Germany==

===Einstein, Albert===
(SA:DE)

'''[[Albert Einstein]]''' is a German physicist who was believed to have been working on an [[atomic bomb]] project in Europe. Along with several other leading German and Austro-Hungarian physicists, Einstein disappeared from public view in 1942. Not long afterwards, the United States, along with [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Austria-Hungary]], were suspected of beginning atomic bomb programs. Since in this world Germany never became [[Nazi]] and there were no persecutions of [[Jews]], he has no problem in contributing to the German war effort, especially as the war begins with Germany being attacked and invaded.

===Guderian, Heinz===
(GW:WH, AE:CCH)

Captain '''[[Heinz Guderian]]''' of the German Imperial Army was an observer attached to Irving Morrell's unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]].  He expressed a more strategic view of the fighting than Major [[Eduard Dietl]], noting that fighting is done for a purpose.  He then displays his great insight into warfare by adding that the point of battle is to get behind the enemy and "smash him up".  (In our timeline, Guderian was one of the masterminds of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]'s [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics, in which the main goal is indeed to get behind the enemy and attack where the enemy is more vulnerable.)  Due to a desire to stay in the field rather than return to a desk position, Guderian stays with Morrell after Major Dietl returns to Austria, and accompanies him back to [[Philadelphia]], during which they meet Luther Bliss and the new Lieutenant Governor of [[Kentucky]].  Guderian makes another appearance, now as a [[lieutenant colonel]], in occupied Canada in 1926, when he shows up in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], and asks Colonel Morrell for a tour of western Canada.  He is accompanied by his [[aide-de-camp]] [[Adolf Hitler]], whose [[anti-Semitic]] views he does not care for.

{{anchor|Adolf Hitler}}

===Hitler, Adolf===
(AE:CCH)

Because of the [[German Empire]]'s victory in this world, '''[[Adolf Hitler]]''' is a sergeant in the German Army. He holds the [[Iron Cross]], First Class. Morrell met him once as an orderly to Colonel [[Heinz Guderian]], who was on an inspection tour in [[Kamloops, British Columbia]], an occupied territory of the United States. Morrell thought that he was very much like [[Jake Featherston]], but with a hatred for [[Jews]] and [[Slavs]] rather than [[Africans]]. Hitler is never mentioned by name in CCH, but the author has acknowledged his identity. (See also Turtledove's short story "Uncle Alf" in the anthology ''Alternate Generals II'', narrated by a similar version of Hitler.)

===Marx, Karl===
(HFR-AE:CCH)

'''Karl Marx''' was greatly admired by former [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]]. However, Lincoln did not agree with Marx's belief in violent revolution, and steered the [[Socialist Party of the United States]] towards change through the ballot, rather than the bullet at the party's founding 1882.

In the [[Confederate States]], black revolutionaries embraced Marx's call for revolution, staging a revolt during the early years of the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. While various socialist republics such as the Black Belt Socialist Republic and Congaree Socialist Republic were created, the uprisings were crushed by the C.S. in short order.

===von Schlieffen, Alfred===
(HFR)

'''[[Alfred von Schlieffen]]''' was a [[colonel]] in the German [[army]] working as a military [[attaché]] before and during the Second Mexican War at the German embassy in the United States. His study of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s encirclement of [[Washington, D.C.]] is said to be the inspiration for the [[Schlieffen Plan]] of [[World War I]].

===von Schlözer, Kurd===
(HFR)

'''[[Kurd von Schlözer]]''' remained the [[German Empire]]'s ambassador to the United States as in our timeline. After U.S. President Blaine sued for peace during the Second Mexican War, Schlözer and the German military attaché Alfred von Schlieffen first brought up the idea of an alliance between the United States and the German Empire as a counterpart to the alliance between the United Kingdom, France and the [[Confederate States]], thus forming the foundations for the [[Central Powers]] and breaking the United States' policy of nonintervention in European affairs.

===Wilhelm II, Kaiser===
(GW:AF-AE:VO)

Kaiser '''[[Wilhelm II]]''' was the German Emperor and one of the main allies of the United States in World War I. "Kaiser Bill" was a popular character in the U.S. Many men wore a "Kaiser Bill" mustache in imitation of him. He lived until 1941 (as he did in our timeline), where his death and his son's coming to the throne and refusal to give France its [[Alsace-Lorraine|lost territory]] back started the Second Great War. He was the father of Kaiser [[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|Friedrich Wilhelm V]].

===Wilhelm III, Kaiser===
(AE:VO, SA:RE-ID)

[[Crown Prince Wilhelm of Germany|'''Friedrich Wilhelm''']], Crown Prince of Germany, became Kaiser of the German Empire in 1941, upon the death of his father, [[Wilhelm II]]. He refused to return Alsace-Lorraine to the newly revived Kingdom of France and their British allies, which precipitated the Second Great War in Europe. He authorised the destruction of several targets with superbombs, including [[Petrograd]], [[Paris]] as well as [[London]], [[Norwich]] and [[Brighton]] in a deadly triple strike that crippled Britain into defeat. After the war, he entered into a treaty with the new US President [[Thomas E. Dewey]] to police the world and prevent further development of superbombs.

This character may be the center of a substantial mistake on Turtledove's part. Upon his ascension at the end of [[American Empire: The Victorious Opposition|''The Victorious Opposition'']], he is announced as "Friedrich I of Germany and Friedrich Wilhelm V of Prussia." If this character is indeed the historical figure Wilhelm, Crown Prince of Germany, then he would have reigned as Wilhelm III. While the Crown Prince's first name was Friedrich, even if he chose to call himself that upon his ascension, or, if the character is meant to be the fictional son of Wilhelm II of Germany, he could not have been Friedrich I, but would in fact have been Friedrich IV. There also does not appear to have been a tradition of the German Emperor using a different name in his role as King of Prussia.

As Turtledove only refers to this character as 'the Kaiser' in the ''Settling Accounts'' series, there are no additional clues available to the reader as to the character's identity.

==Austria-Hungary==

===Charles I of Austria===
(SA:G)

'''[[Charles I of Austria]]''' still holds the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]] well into the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. In 1943, he and [[Tsar]] [[Michael II of Russia]] trade public insults as to whose country [[God]] hates more.

Turtledove does not spend much time on the monarchy of Austria-Hungary. Indeed, the only reference to Charles is the one described above. But with Austria victorious at the end of [[World War I]], Charles would not have abdicated as in real history, and so would have avoided dying of [[pneumonia]] in 1922 while living in [[Portugal]].

===Dietl, Eduard===
(GW:WH)

Major '''[[Eduard Dietl]]''' of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] army was an observer attached to [[Irving Morrell|Irving Morrell's]] unit during the 1916 campaign in the [[Canadian Rockies]]. While Turtledove made him an Austro-Hungarian officer, real-life Dietl was a member of the German army.

===Ferdinand, Franz===
(GW:AF)

'''Archduke Franz Ferdinand''' and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Duchess Sophie]] through [[Sarajevo]] were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|blown up by an assassin's bomb]] on June 28, 1914. In real history, the Archduke and his wife were assassinated on the same date, but by gunshot after failed attempts to throw bombs into their car. After the assassination, Austria-Hungary issued a number of ultimata against [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]], which was supported by [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. Austria-Hungary was in turn supported by [[German Empire|Germany]] and the [[United States]]. Russia invoked its alliances with the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[French Third Republic|France]], and the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]] began.

Franz Ferdinand's death inspired [[Arthur McGregor]]'s last failed attempt to assassinate [[George Custer|General George Armstrong Custer]] in 1922.

===Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg===
(GW:AF)

'''Duchess Sophie''' and her husband Archduke Franz Ferdinand were [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|killed when a bomb was thrown into their car and exploded]], as they rode through the streets of [[Sarajevo]] on 28 June 28, 1914. This act helped to spark the [[Great War (series)|Great War]].

==Denmark==

===Bohr, Niels===

There is no mention of Denmark taking any part in either of the Great Wars, and it seems to have succeeded in maintaining its neutrality. However, [[Niels Bohr]] is mentioned as having been persuaded by [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]] to come over to [[German Empire|Germany]] and take part in its [[atomic weapons]] program.

==Russia==

===Michael II, Tsar===
(AE:VO-SA:RE, SA:ID)

'''[[Michael Alexandrovich]]''' is the Grand Duke (and later [[Emperor]]) of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. With the [[Russian Revolution|Red Russian Revolt]] smashed, and the tsarist government still in control of a post-Great War Russia, "Grand Duke Michael" took the throne as Michael II. He joined [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]] to help his allies in 1941 to wage war against the [[Central Powers]]. He condemned the [[German Empire|German]] [[atomic bomb]] attack on [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], the city of which he had escaped prior to the attack, but later was forced to request an armistice from Germany and to relinquish the throne.

===Molotov, Vyacheslav ("The Hammer")===
(AE:CCH)

Also known as "The Hammer", this is '''[[Vyacheslav Molotov]]''' from our world, another Red holdout (in the failed rebellion) in the [[Volga]] area, trying to defeat the Tsarist forces. By 1941, the Tsarist forces have all but defeated the Red Russians.

===Nicholas II, Tsar===
(GW:AF - GW:B, AE:VO)

In 1914, when [[Austria-Hungary]] issued a number of ultimata to [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] following the assassination of Franz Ferdinand by a Serb in Sarajevo, '''[[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]]''' promised to support the Serbs should they refuse the ultimata. They did, and Russia declared war on Austria-Hungary, which had declared war on Serbia. The Great War followed.

In 1917, Nicholas found himself facing a [[Russian Revolution|Red revolution]], followed by a protracted [[Russian Civil War|civil war]], which resulted in Russia backing out of the Great War. Ultimately, Nicholas and his supporters triumphed, and Nicholas remained emperor for the remainder of the 1920s. The destruction resulting from the wars left Russia in such a poor state that in 1929 she was forced to suspend payment of a loan to Austria-Hungary. This caused a chain effect that led in turn to the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|worldwide stock market]] crash of that year.

Nicholas was succeeded as Tsar by his younger brother [[Michael Alexandrovich|Michael II]] by the early 1930s.

===Stalin, Joseph===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Joseph Stalin]]''' is nicknamed "The Man of Steel" in this world. The Red Revolution following the Great War failed and Stalin and the "Hammer" ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]]) became holdouts in the Volga area near the city of [[Volgograd|Tsaritsyn]] which in our timeline was renamed by him as Stalingrad.

==Ottoman Empire==

===Abdul Mejid II===
(AE:CCH)

'''[[Abdul Mejid II]]''' became the [[Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] sometime after the Great War. He was responsible for continuing the [[Armenian genocide]] through the 1920s. Despite protests from the United States and [[German Empire|Germany]], the Sultan continued the killings until there were few remaining Armenians left in Turkey.

==Ireland==

===Collins, Michael===
(AE:BI)

General '''[[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]]''' led a rebellion against the [[British Empire]] during the Great War, supported by the United States and Germany, and became first president of the [[Republic of Ireland]] when this country achieved independence shortly after the war ended. In the early 1920s Collins led the Irish Army against a pro-British Protestant uprising in [[Ulster]] and suppressed it with the help of American and German warships.

==Italy and Vatican City==

===Mussolini, Benito===
(SA:RE)

Although not mentioned by name, Flora Blackford tries to recall the Italian politician who had pledged to make all the trains in his country run on time, but had little public support. The real '''[[Benito Mussolini]]''' claimed to have done this during his rule of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]]; actually, improvements in the train system predated Mussolini, and the trains were as unpunctual as before.

===Pope Pius XII===
(SA:G)

'''[[Pope Pius XII|Pius XII]]''' was Pope in this timeline as well as ours. He was criticized for not condemning the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[genocide]] of [[Armenians]] or the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] [[pogroms]] against [[Jews]], and it appeared that he likewise did not care about the Freedom Party's killing of the black population of the Confederate States. One character observes that Pius would have spoken out against human rights violations if the group being persecuted consisted mainly of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]]. (Yet this argument is faulty, as the killings were also affecting Catholic Haiti.) The criticism of Pius' failure to condemn human rights violations in this timeline echoes the widely held belief that [[Pope Pius XII and the Holocaust|Pope Pius XII didn't condemn the Holocaust]] in ours.

Given the passage of eight decades between the point of divergence and this part of the story, there's no guarantee that this Pius XII is Eugenio Pacelli, the man who used that numeral in our timeline. For most of history, Popes simply took their regnal names from a fairly short list. However, the plethora of other historical figures in the series suggests that he is the same.

==Mentioned Historical Characters from Before the [[point of divergence|Change]]==

===Adams, John===
'''[[John Adams]]''' served as the second [[President of the United States]]. After the [[How Few Remain|War of Secession]], he and the other Northerner [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were treated more favorably.

During the 1900s, Adams's portrait was used on the [[United States five-dollar bill|five dollar bill]].

===Brown, John===
(AE:BI)

Following the U.S. defeat in the Second Mexican War, '''[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]''' became a national hero. He was not seen so after the War of Secession. Many towns raised memorials to John Brown because of his attacks on the 'slavocrats' in [[Virginia]] ("He saw the coiled serpent and attacked it!"), particularly in [[Kansas]].

===Calhoun, John Caldwell===
(GW:AF) (SA:G)

Although '''[[John C. Calhoun]]''' died over a decade before the Confederate States was created by the secession of eleven US states in 1860-61, the secession of the CS's founding states was a direct descendant of his nullification doctrine, and Calhoun was therefore seen as a founding father of the Confederacy along with [[Jefferson Davis]], [[Robert E. Lee]], and even [[George Washington]]. His picture appeared on the [[Confederate States dollar|Confederate dollar bill]], for example. Naturally, the U.S. felt differently about Calhoun.

The towns of [[Calhoun, Kentucky]] and [[Calhoun, Georgia]] were named in Calhoun's honor in this timeline. (In our timeline, only the Georgia town was unquestionably named in honor of Calhoun. The Kentucky town [[Calhoun, Kentucky#History|had several names]] before being incorporated in 1852, after Calhoun's OTL death in 1850, as ''Calhoon'', honoring Kentucky congressman [[John Calhoon]]. There is no historic record that definitively states whether the later spelling change to "Calhoun" was specifically in honor of John C. Calhoun.)

===Franklin, Benjamin===
As a [[Pennsylvania|Pennsylvanian man]], '''[[Benjamin Franklin]]''' remained a favorite Founding Father after the War of Secession along with [[John Adams]] and [[Alexander Hamilton]]. A profile of Franklin's face was printed on stamps issued in American Occupied Canada after the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]].

[[Flora Hamburger]] once quoted Franklin's warning "Those who would trade essential liberty for a little temporary security deserve neither liberty nor security" in a floor debate in the House of Representatives—which incidentally met in [[Independence Hall]].

Former president [[Abraham Lincoln]] also quoted Franklin to his host when he visited [[Salt Lake City]] in 1881.

===Jefferson, Thomas===
'''[[Thomas Jefferson]]''' was the third [[President of the United States]]. Following the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]], Thomas Jefferson's status as a [[Virginia]]n (and more substantively, his insistence on a weak central government) tarnished his memory considerably in the United States. Northern Founding Fathers such as [[John Adams]], [[Benjamin Franklin]], and [[Alexander Hamilton]] were viewed much more favorably.

===Madison, James===
(SA:ID)

Despite his contributions to the [[Federalist paper]]s with [[Alexander Hamilton]], '''[[James Madison]]''' later developed anti-Federalist sentiments and allied himself with Hamilton's archrival, [[Thomas Jefferson]]. For this reason as well as his Virginian heritage, Madison was generally remembered unfavorably in the version of US history advanced under the Remembrance tradition.

In 1944, many in the U.S. presumed that Cassius Madison, the man who killed [[Jake Featherston]], had taken his surname name to honor the fourth President. In fact Cassius had taken the surname from the [[Madison, Georgia|Georgia town]] nearest to where he'd gunned Featherston down. He had never even heard of President Madison before his tour of the U.S.

===Monroe, James===
(HFR)

Despite being from [[Virginia]] (a trait which other presidents and [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers]] such as [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Madison]], and even [[George Washington]] to being remembered in a mixed or negative light by US historians after the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]]), '''[[James Monroe]]''' was looked on kindly in US history books for his attempt to promote U.S. security and international prestige with the [[Monroe Doctrine]]—a doctrine which was eviscerated in 1862 when, thanks to the Confederate States, the U.S. was powerless to prevent [[Second French Empire|France]] from installing [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as the [[Emperor of Mexico]].

===Napoleon===
(HFR)

'''[[Napoleon]]''' had been a military genius, achieving an almost mythological stature in the eyes of the world. All those who were masters on the battlefield were often compared to him. He was also an uncle of [[Napoleon III]] who, in turn, was the Emperor of [[Second French Empire|France]] from 1852 to 1870.

Only in [[German Empire|Germany]] was he not admired as his victory over [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] was remembered. In the aftermath of France's defeat in the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]], this made him even more of a hero to the people of France.

During his youth, US President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] counted Napoleon as one of his personal heroes, along with [[George Washington]] and [[Zachary Taylor]].

In 1881, [[Alfred von Schlieffen]] noted that Kaiser [[Wilhelm I]] was one of the last surviving men to have fought under Napoleon during the [[Napoleonic Wars]].

===Polk, James Knox===
(SA:ID)

'''[[James Knox Polk]]''' had served as the eleventh President of the United States. He was born in what became [[Pineville, North Carolina]]. A monument erected on the spot of his birth was site of the 1944 meeting between U.S. General [[Irving Morrell]] and [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Don Partridge]] at which Partridge signed away Confederate sovereignty and ended the [[Settling Accounts|Second Great War]]. Both men deemed it a fit location for the meeting because Polk had been President before the United States was divided by the [[American Civil War|War of Secession]].

===Taylor, Zachary===
(HFR)

Despite his southern roots, '''[[Zachary Taylor]]''' was appreciated in the United States for his military success during the [[Mexican–American War|First Mexican War]] (the last which the United States would see until the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]).

In his youth, Theodore Roosevelt was a great admirer of Taylor's, viewing him as a conqueror and leader ranking with [[George Washington]] and [[Napoleon]].

===Washington, George===
As a military hero and the first President of the United States, '''[[George Washington]]''' was universally revered as a major Founding Father and one of the most memorable presidents in American history. Also after it broke into two mutually antagonistic nations, U.S. historians continued to so regard Washington, alongside Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt as the most memorable of presidents.

Before 1920, the Confederacy esteemed Washington as a Founding Father, but generally preferred their own founding fathers such as [[John C. Calhoun]], [[Jefferson Davis]], and [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1914, then-President [[Woodrow Wilson]] invoked George Washington in his speech asking for Congress for a declaration of war against the U.S. while speaking in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

In the Union, however, Washington was remembered on mixed terms. The general public did not always remember kindly. Washington came from [[Virginia]], and after the War of Secession his popularity in the U.S. suffered because of it - as did that of Thomas Jefferson and [[James Madison]]. Northern people in general preferred to remember Northern Founding Fathers such as John Adams, Alexander Hamilton and Benjamin Franklin (whose picture appeared on stamps issued by the U.S. occupation authorities in Canada). Despite this, the U.S. Government would rebuild the [[Washington Monument]] after it was destroyed during the [[Great War (Harry Turtledove)|Great War]]. As a young man, Theodore Roosevelt admired Washington as a great leader along with [[Zachary Taylor]] and [[Napoleon]].

The Freedom Party in its earliest phase, while still under [[Anthony Dresser]], used George Washington's picture as an emblem, with the slogan "We need a New Revolution". [[Jake Featherston]], who considered Washington to have "sold out the South to the damnyankees" stopped that custom when he took over the party. Many Confederates did view Washington with some suspicion in the years after the Great War, but still thought of him as a Virginian first, and President of the United States second. Washington University in [[Lexington, Virginia]], home of the Confederacy's effort to build a [[Nuclear bomb|superbomb]], retained its name, and the statue of Washington that stood in Richmond survived both Great Wars.

===Webster, Daniel===
(GW:B)

As a northern abolitionist, '''[[Daniel Webster]]''' became a hero to the United States during the Remembrance era between the [[Second Mexican War]] and the [[Great War (series)|Great War]]. His image was on the [[Quarter (United States coin)|U.S. quarter]]. In the Confederate States, he was vilified for thwarting the interests of the ante-bellum South.

'''''I Spit on Your Grave''''' (initially titled as '''''Day of the Woman'''''&lt;!--BOLDING PER MOS:BOLD, Day of the Woman (film) is a redirect to this section.--&gt;) is a 1978 American [[rape and revenge film|rape-and-revenge]] [[exploitation film|exploitation]] [[horror film]] written, directed, produced and edited by [[Meir Zarchi]]. The plot involves [[Jennifer Hills]] ([[Camille Keaton]]), a Manhattan writer, on a summer vacation in a lakeside cabin when a group of four men [[gang rape]]s her, leaving her for dead. Hills has her revenge, killing each of them in horrific ways as retribution. The film had a limited release, which later expanded to a wider release in 1980. Forty years later, the film was followed by a sequel, in which Keaton reprises her role: ''I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu'' (2019).

''I Spit on Your Grave'' is noted for its very controversial depiction of extreme graphic violence, in particular the lengthy depictions of gang rape, that take up 30 minutes of the film's runtime. During its wider release, the film was branded a "[[video nasty]]" in the United Kingdom, and was a target of censorship by film commissioning bodies.&lt;ref name="videonasty1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phelan|first1=Laurence|title=Film censorship: How moral panic led to a mass ban of 'video nasties'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/film-censorship-how-moral-panic-led-to-a-mass-ban-of-video-nasties-9600998.html|accessdate=19 February 2017|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="videonasty2"&gt;{{cite news|title=I Spit On Your Grave|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/case-studies/i-spit-your-grave|accessdate=19 February 2017|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, renowned film critic [[Roger Ebert]] became one of the most notable detractors of the film, calling it "a vile bag of garbage".&lt;ref name="ebertchicago"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ebert|first1=Roger|title=I Spit on Your Grave Movie Review (1980)|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/i-spit-on-your-grave-1980|accessdate=18 February 2017|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=16 July 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film remains highly controversial to this day, even being considered to be one of the [[List of films considered the worst|worst films ever made]]. For some, it is this controversy which has led to it being deemed a [[cult classic]].&lt;ref name="villagevoice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardy|first1=Ernest|title=Full of Gruesome Sexual Violence, ''I Spit on Your Grave 2'' Is an Unnecessary Sequel|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/film/full-of-gruesome-sexual-violence-i-spit-on-your-grave-2-is-an-unnecessary-sequel-6439538|accessdate=28 February 2017|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It made [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine's Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/completelist/0,29569,2015869,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Ridiculously Violent Movies | date=3 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The film spawned a 2010 [[I Spit on Your Grave (2010 film)|remake]], which has since spawned more sequels: ''[[I Spit on Your Grave 2]]'' (2013), and ''[[I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance Is Mine]]'' (2015).

==Plot==
Short story writer [[Jennifer Hills]] ([[Camille Keaton]]) lives in [[Manhattan]] and rents an isolated cottage in [[Kent, Connecticut]] near the [[Housatonic River]] in the [[Litchfield County]] countryside to write her first novel. The arrival of the attractive and independent young woman attracts the attention of Johnny, the gas station manager, and Stanley and Andy, two unemployed men. Jennifer has her groceries delivered by Matthew, who is mildly mentally disabled. Matthew is friends with the other three men and reports back to them about the beautiful woman he met, claiming he saw her breasts.

Stanley and Andy start cruising by the cottage in their boat and prowl around the house at night. One day, the men attack Jennifer. She realizes they planned her abduction so Matthew can lose his virginity. She fights back, but the three men rip her [[bikini]] off and hold her. Matthew refuses to rape Jennifer out of respect and pity for her, so Johnny rapes her first; Andy [[anal sex|anally]] rapes her next. After she crawls back to her house, they attack her again. Matthew finally rapes her after drinking alcohol. The other men ridicule her book and rip up the manuscript, and Stanley violently forces her to perform oral sex on him. She passes out; Johnny realizes she is a witness to their crimes and orders Matthew to go and murder her. Matthew cannot bring himself to stab her, so he dabs the knife in her blood and then returns to the other men, claiming he has killed her.

In the following days, a [[Psychological trauma|traumatized]] Jennifer pieces both herself and her manuscript back together. She goes to church and asks for forgiveness for what she plans to do. The men learn Jennifer has survived and beat Matthew up for deceiving them. Jennifer calls in a grocery order, knowing Matthew will deliver it. He takes the groceries and a knife. At the cabin, Jennifer entices him to have sex with her under a tree. She then hangs him alive and drops his body into the lake.

At the gas station, Jennifer seductively directs Johnny to enter her car. She stops halfway to her house, points a gun at him, and orders him to remove all his clothing. Johnny insists the rapes were all her fault because she enticed the men by parading around in revealing clothing. She pretends to believe this and invites him back to her cottage for a hot bath, where she gives him a [[handjob]]. When Johnny mentions that Matthew has been reported missing, Jennifer states that she killed him; as he nears his orgasm, she takes the knife Matthew brought with him and severs Johnny's genitals. She leaves the bathroom, locks the door, and listens to classical music as Johnny screams as he bleeds to death. She dumps his body in the basement and burns his clothes in the fireplace.

Stanley and Andy learn that Johnny is missing and take their boat to Jennifer's cabin. Andy goes ashore with an axe. Jennifer swims out to the boat and pushes Stanley overboard. Andy tries to attack her but she escapes with the axe. Andy swims out to rescue Stanley, but Jennifer plunges the axe into Andy's back, killing him. Stanley moves towards the boat and grabs hold of the motor to climb aboard, begging Jennifer not to kill him. She repeats an order he made to her during the sexual assaults: "Suck it, bitch!" She starts the motor, disemboweling him with the propeller, and she speeds away.

===Title===
The film's original title was ''Day of the Woman''. It was also shown under the title ''I Hate Your Guts'' and ''The Rape and Revenge of Jennifer Hill''. The title was changed to ''I Spit on Your Grave'' for the 1980 re-release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077713/releaseinfo |title=Release dates for Day of the Woman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
Zarchi was unable to find a distributor, so he distributed the film himself. It played a number of engagements in rural [[drive-in theater]]s, but only for brief runs each time, and Zarchi barely made back what he spent in advertising. In 1980, it was picked up for distribution by the Jerry Gross Organization. A condition of this re-release was that they could change the title to anything they wished. It was at this time the film was retitled ''I Spit on Your Grave''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squabblebox.co.uk/2016/05/cult-corner-i-spit-on-your-grave-day-of-the-woman-1978/|title=Cult Corner: I Spit on Your Grave (Day of the Woman, 1978) - SquabbleBox.co.uk - Entertainment Under Attack|website=www.squabblebox.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''I Spit on Your Grave'' received universally negative reviews from critics. Film critic [[Roger Ebert]] referred to it as "a vile bag of garbage...without a shred of artistic distinction," adding that "Attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800716/REVIEWS/7160301/1023 |title= Review of ''I Spit on Your Grave'' |accessdate=2007-03-20 |author= Roger Ebert |authorlink= Roger Ebert |date= July 16, 1980 |work= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He mentioned in his review a female member of the audience (one of many people who randomly talked aloud) who had "feminist solidarity for the movie's heroine". He wrote, "I wanted to ask if she'd been appalled by the movie's hour of rape scenes". Ebert was also one of many to cite the movie's poor production quality as a weakness in addition to the scenes he found offensive, stating "The story of 'I Spit on Your Grave' is told with moronic simplicity. These horrible events are shown with an absolute minimum of dialogue, which is so poorly recorded that it often cannot be heard. There is no attempt to develop the personalities of the characters - they are, simply, a girl and four men, one of them mentally retarded. The movie is nothing more or less than a series of attacks on the girl and then her attacks on the men, interrupted only by an unbelievably grotesque and inappropriate scene in which she enters a church and asks forgiveness for the murders she plans to commit".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19800716/REVIEWS/7160301/1023 |work= Chicago Sun-Times |title= I Spit on Your Grave}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ebert also included it on his "most hated" list and considered it to be the worst movie ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Video Q&amp;A |author= Roger Ebert |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0U9IAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NP0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2655,5621128&amp;dq=roger+ebert+i+spit+on+your+grave+worst+ever&amp;hl=en |newspaper=[[The Ledger]] |date= 28 May 1998 |accessdate= 3 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Both Ebert and fellow critic [[Gene Siskel]] blasted the movie on their television program ''[[Sneak Previews]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ebertpresents.com/movies/halloween/videos/268#ooid=92bmNyMjpQy8gFxO2bZLr-LDZFLxW6UI |title= Classics from the Vault: Women in Danger (1980) |publisher= Ebert Presents |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a later episode, Siskel and Ebert chose the film as the worst film of 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siskelandebert.org/video/K67XHXKYBXU4/Worst-of-1980|title=Siskel &amp; Ebert org - Worst of 1980|first=Modified by Richi from Juapo2Services &amp; Developer by Arslan Hassan -|last=http://clip-bucket.com/arslan-hassan|website=siskelandebert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siskel would join Ebert in calling the film one of the worst ever made.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/doc/175977821.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Aug%2017,%201983&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago%20Tribune&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=Tempo |title= 'Man Who Wasn't There' would best be left unseen |accessdate= 2013-10-02 |author=Gene Siskel |authorlink= Gene Siskel |date= 1983-08-17 |work= Chicago Tribune |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Luke Y. Thompson of ''[[New Times LA|The New Times]]'' stated that "defenders of the film have argued that it's actually pro-woman, due to the fact that the female lead wins in the end, which is sort of like saying that cockfights are pro-rooster because there's always one left standing".&lt;ref name=Spiton&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/i_spit_on_your_grave/ |title=I Spit on Your Grave (Day of the Woman) |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2013-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Film critic [[Mark Kermode]] has opined that it is "deeply, deeply problematic at the very best of times" and is not as interesting as earlier exploitation films such as ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''.  Critic David Keyes named it the worst film of the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Spiton"/&gt; This led to the film's removal from a major theatre. 

''Encyclopedia of Horror'' notes that the film attracted much debate for and against, frequently involving people who clearly had not actually seen the film. "The men are so grossly unattractive and the rapes so harrowing, long-drawn-out and starkly presented it is hard to imagine most male spectators identifying with the perpetrators, especially as the film's narrative structure and ''[[Mise en scène|mise-en-scene]]'' force the spectator to view the action from Keaton's point of view. Further, there is no suggestion that she 'asked for it' or enjoyed it, except, of course, in the rapists' own perceptions, from which the film is careful to distance itself." The book continues that the scenes of revenge were "grotesquely misread by some critics" as Jennifer only "pretends to have enjoyed the rape so as to lure the men to their destruction", and that in these scenes the film is critiquing "familiar male arguments about women 'bringing it on themselves'" as "simply sexist, self-excusing rhetoric and are quite clearly presented as such".&lt;ref name="Milne, Tom 1986. p 329"&gt;Milne, Tom. Willemin, Paul. Hardy, Phil. (Ed.) ''Encyclopedia of Horror'', Octopus Books, 1986. {{ISBN|0-7064-2771-8}} p 329&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later reception====
The initial criticism was followed by reappraisals of the film. Michael Kaminski's 2007 article for the website "Obsessed with Film", titled "Is 'I Spit on Your Grave' Really a Misunderstood Feminist Film?" argues that, when understood within the context in which director Zarchi was inspired to make it, the movie may be equally appropriate to analyze as "feminist wish-fulfillment" and a vehicle of personal expression reacting to violence against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/specials/is-i-spit-on-your-grave-really-a-misunderstood-feminist-film.php |title=Is I Spit on Your Grave Really a Misunderstood Feminist Film? |author=Michael Kaminski |date=October 29, 2007 |year= |month= |format= |work= |publisher=Obsessed With Film |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031004519/http://www.obsessedwithfilm.com/specials/is-i-spit-on-your-grave-really-a-misunderstood-feminist-film.php|archivedate=2007-10-31|dead-url=yes |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A reappraisal was made by [[Carol J. Clover]] in the third chapter of her 1992 book ''[[Men, Women, and Chainsaws]]''. Clover notes that she and others like her "appreciate, however grudgingly, the way in which [the movie's] brutal simplicity exposes a mainspring of popular culture." Clover further argues that the film's sympathies are entirely with Jennifer, that the male audience is meant to identify with her and not with the attackers, and that the point of the film is a [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] identification with pain used to justify the bloody [[catharsis]] of revenge. Clover wrote that in her opinion the film owes a debt to ''[[Deliverance]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |title=The Best Rape Deterrent Hollywood Has Ever Made |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/03/the-best-rape-deterrent-hollywood-has-ever-made/274223 |work=The Atlantic|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group |accessdate=2013-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British feminist [[Julie Bindel]], who was involved in pickets outside cinemas in Leeds when the film was released, has said that she was wrong about the film and that it is a feminist film. The film currently holds a 53% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 34 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/19/wrong-about-spit-on-your-grave | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Julie | last=Bindel | title=Rape films vs realism – Julie Bindel | date=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International bans===
Many nations, including [[Ireland]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]], and [[West Germany]], banned the film altogether, claiming that it "glorified violence against women". [[Canada]] initially banned the film, but in the 1990s decided to allow its individual provinces to decide whether to permit its release. Since 1998, some provinces (such as [[Manitoba]], [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Quebec]]) have released the film, with a rating that reflects its content.

The censored American version of the film was released in [[Australia]] in 1982 with an R 18+ rating. In 1987, the film survived an appeal to ban it. It continued to be sold until 1997, when another reclassification caused its ban in Australia. In 2004, the full uncut version was awarded an R 18+, lifting the seven-year ban. The Office of Film and Literature Classification justified this decision by reasoning that [[castration]] is not sexual violence (Australian censorship law forbids the release of films that depict scenes of sexual violence as acceptable or justified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://refused-classification.com/Films_ISpitOnYourGrave.htm |title=Details for ''I Spit On Your Grave'' |accessdate=2007-03-20 |author= |date= |publisher=Refused-Classification.com |pages= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], the film was branded a "[[video nasty]]". It appeared on the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]]'s list of prosecutable films until 2001, when a heavily cut version which extensively edited the rape scenes was released with an [[18 (British Board of Film Classification)|18 certificate]]. All subsequent releases of the film have received similar cuts.

In [[New Zealand]], the uncut version of the film (101 minutes) was classified in 1984 as R20 with the descriptive note, "Contains graphic violence, content may disturb". Other versions with shorter running times (96 minutes) were also classified in 1984 and 1985, and received the same classification.

[[The Irish Film Board]] has again banned the film from sale. Having been banned for many years in the country, the new Blu-ray and DVD uncensored edition has been prohibited from purchase by retailers due to the nature of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.horrorsociety.com/2010/09/17/ireland-bans-i-spit-on-your-grave |title= Ireland Bans I Spit on your Grave |publisher= Horror Society |date= 17 September 2010 |accessdate= 1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zarchi's inspiration and responses to criticism===
In the commentary for the Millennium Edition, Zarchi said he was inspired to produce the film after helping a young woman who had been raped in New York. He tells of how he, a friend and his daughter were driving by a park when they witnessed a young woman crawling out of the bushes bloodied and naked (he later learned the young woman was taking a common shortcut to her boyfriend's house when she was attacked). They collected the traumatized girl, returned the daughter home, and quickly decided it was best to take the girl to the police rather than a hospital, lest the attackers escape and find further victims.

They quickly decided that they made the wrong decision &amp;mdash; the officer, whom Zarchi described as "not fit to wear the uniform", delayed taking her to the hospital and instead insisted that she follow formalities such as giving her full name (and the spelling), even though her jaw had been broken and she could hardly speak. Zarchi insisted the officer take her to the hospital and he eventually complied. Soon afterwards the woman's father wrote both Zarchi and his friend a letter of thanks for helping his daughter. The father offered a reward, which Zarchi refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20579|title=100 Years of Horror: A Celebration of the Top Ten Most Controversial Horror Films!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same commentary, Zarchi denied that the film was exploitative and that the violent nature of the film was necessary to tell the story. He described actress Camille Keaton as "brave" for taking on the role.&lt;ref name="Eofftv"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eofftv.com/notes/d/day/day_of_the_woman_notes.htm |title=Day of the Woman: EOFFTV Production Notes |publisher=Eofftv.com |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2013-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406094149/http://www.eofftv.com/notes/d/day/day_of_the_woman_notes.htm |archivedate=2012-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequels and remake==
The film was followed by the unofficial [[sequel]] ''[[Savage Vengeance]]'' (the title card on the movie was misspelled as ''Savage Vengance'') (1993) in which [[Camille Keaton]] (under the alias of Vickie Kehl for unknown reasons) reprises the role of Jennifer. However, no scenes from ''I Spit on Your Grave'' were used for the flashbacks. The film barely went for 65 minutes, and received extremely negative reviews from critics and fans alike.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

CineTel Films acquired rights to remake ''[[I Spit on Your Grave (2010 film)|I Spit on Your Grave]]'', which had a Halloween 2010 worldwide theatrical release. The remake was produced by CineTel president and CEO Paul Hertzberg and Lisa Hansen, with Jeff Klein, Alan Ostroff, Gary Needle and Zarchi as executive producers.&lt;ref name="remake"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986830.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=i+spit+on+your+grave|title=Cinetel set for 'Grave' remake |accessdate=2008-07-03 |author= |date= 2008-06-03 |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |pages= |language= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210100212/http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117986830.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1&amp;query=i+spit+on+your+grave|archivedate=2008-12-10|quote= | first=Michael |dead-url=yes| last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steven R. Monroe directed, with newcomer [[Sarah Butler]] starring as Jennifer. The follow up ''[[I Spit on Your Grave 2]]'' was released on September 20, 2013, starring Jemma Dallender, [[Joe Absolom]], Yavor Baharov, and Aleksandar Alekiov.  It was directed by [[Steven R. Monroe]] and written by [[Thomas Fenton]] and Neil Elman.  A second sequel, ''[[I Spit on Your Grave III: Vengeance is Mine]]'', arrived in 2015.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

The official sequel ''I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu'', directed by original director [[Meir Zarchi]], was finished in October 2016 with [[Camille Keaton]] reprising her role as Jennifer Hills.&lt;ref name="sequel"&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://bloody-disgusting.com/indie/3369406/meir-zarchi-just-finished-a-sequel-to-his-own-i-spit-on-your-grave/ |title= Meir Zarchi Just Finished a Sequel to His Own ‘I Spit On Your Grave’! |accessdate= |date= |publisher= [[Bloody Disgusting]] |pages= |quote= | first=Brad| last=Miska}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The film received its first [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] release on 20 September 2010 in the United Kingdom from 101 Films. It was released in an 'Ultimate Collector's Edition', containing the film on both Blu-ray and DVD, a collector's booklet and poster. It is the most complete version released in the UK, but it is not uncut - cuts of almost three minutes were required for an '18' rating &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/HVV102647/ |title=BBFC 2010 DVD report}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the rape scenes (previous UK releases were cut by over seven minutes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/CVV102647// |title=BBFC 2001 report}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:2007 06 19 Maria Kaczynska 01.jpg|thumb|[[Hansō Sōshitsu|Genshitsu Sen]], 15th ''iemoto'' of the ''[[Urasenke]]'' school]]
{{Nihongo|'''''Iemoto'''''|家元|lead=yes|extra2=(lit. "family foundation")}} is a [[Japanese language|Japanese term]] used to refer to the founder or current Grand Master of a certain school of traditional Japanese art. It is used synonymously with the word {{nihongo||宗家|[[sōke]]}} when it refers to the family or house that the iemoto is head of and represents. 

The word ''iemoto'' is also used to describe a system of familial generations in traditional Japanese arts such as [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] (inc. [[sencha tea ceremony]]), [[ikebana]], [[noh]], [[calligraphy]], [[traditional Japanese dance]], [[traditional Japanese music]], the Japanese art of incense appreciation ([[Japanese incense#Kōdō|kōdō]]), and [[Japanese martial arts]]. [[Shogi]] and [[Go (board game)|go]] once used the ''iemoto'' system as well. The ''iemoto'' system is characterized by a hierarchical structure and the supreme authority of the ''iemoto'', who has inherited the secret traditions of the school from the previous ''iemoto''.
==Titles==
An ''iemoto'' may be addressed by the title ''Iemoto'' or ''O-iemoto'', or by the title {{nihongo||宗匠|Sōshō}} or 
{{nihongo||大先生|Ō-sensei}}. In English, "Grand Master" is often the title that is used. The ''iemoto's'' main roles are to lead the school and protect its traditions, to be the final authority on matters concerning the school, to issue or approve licenses and certificates and, in some cases, to instruct the most advanced practitioners.

The title of ''iemoto'' in most cases is hereditary. It is commonly transmitted by direct line, or by adoption.  Once the "successor-to-be" is officially recognized, that successor-to-be may appropriate the title of {{nihongo||若宗匠|Wakasōshō|extra2="Young Master"}}.

There can only be one ''iemoto'' at a time, which sometimes leads to the creation of new "houses" or "lines."

By tradition, the title of ''iemoto'' is passed down along with a hereditary name.  In the [[Urasenke]] tradition of tea ceremony, for example, the ''iemoto'' carries the name Sōshitsu.
==Structure==
Officially recognized teachers of the traditional arts that have an "iemoto" have obtained a license to teach from the ''iemoto'', signifying the ''iemoto'''s trust that the so-licensed person is capable and qualified to faithfully pass on the school's teachings.  Students must also acquire licenses or certificates at various stages in their study.  Depending on the school, such certificates either give the student permission to study at a particular level or affirm that the student has achieved a given level of mastery.  Recipients must pay for these certificates which, at the highest level, may cost several million [[Japanese yen|yen]].  It is also the ''iemoto'' who authorises, selects and bestows ceremonial names for advanced practitioners.

==History==

As far back as the [[Heian period]] (794-1185), there were iemoto-like family lines that were responsible for passing down the secret traditions and orthodox teachings of their particular school of art, but the first appearance of the word ''iemoto'' in extant records dates to the end of the 17th century, where it is used in reference to families entitled to have their sons become priests at great temples. Its use in the sense that it is used today, in the realm of traditional Japanese arts, starts to appear in documents in the middle of the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;A Chanoyu Vocabulary: Practical Terms for the Way of Tea (Kyoto: Tankosha, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

The system of iemoto is a manifestation of the {{nihongo||家|ie}} or "household" and {{nihongo||同族|dōzoku}} or "extended kin" pattern of relationships in Japanese society.&lt;ref&gt;"Iemoto" entry by Francis L. K. Hsu in Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of the {{Nihongo|"Iemoto System"|家元制度}} was explicated by the historian Matsunosuke Nishiyama in the post-war period to describe the social structures associated with exclusive family control and networks of instructors, a characteristic of the feudal era whose influence on traditional arts is still felt today.

==Famous families and schools==
===Go===

There were originally four main schools of [[Go_(game)|Go]] players: Hon'inbō, Hayashi, Inoue and Yasui; and three minor schools: Sakaguchi, Hattori and Mizutani.  

Early in the 17th century, the then best player in Japan, [[Hon'inbō Sansa]], was made head of a newly founded Go academy (the {{Nihongo|[[Hon'inbō school]]|本因坊}}, which developed the level of playing greatly, and introduced the martial arts style system of ranking players. The government discontinued its support for the Go academies in 1868 as a result of the fall of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

In honour of the Hon'inbō school, whose players consistently dominated the other schools during their history, one of the most prestigious Japanese Go championships is called the "Honinbo" tournament.

===Ikebana===

The three main schools of Japanese flower arrangement, or [[ikebana]], are [[Ikenobō]], [[Ohara-ryū|Ohara]], and [[Sōgetsu]].

According to the organization Ikebana Network,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kadou.com/hp/ryuuha.htm&lt;/ref&gt; there currently are 138 registered schools of small and large size (as of August 2008).

===Japanese dancing===

There are about 200 schools of Japanese dancing. The five most famous are the Hanayagi-ryū, Fujima-ryū, Wakayagi-ryū, Nishikawa-ryū, and Bandō-ryū.

===Incense appreciation===
The two main schools of {{Nihongo|Incense appreciation|香道|kōdō}} are the Shino-ryū and the Nijō-ryū.

===Tea ===
see the article [[Schools of Japanese tea ceremony]]

==Criticisms and resistance==

The ''iemoto'' system has been described as rigid, expensive, nepotistic, authoritarian and undemocratic. Some groups have chosen to reject the ''iemoto'' system. In the realm of the Japanese tea ceremony, Sensho Tanaka in 1898 initiated the ''Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai''.&lt;ref name="Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai"&gt;[http://www.santokuan.or.jp/eng/index.html] Dai Nihon Chado Gakkai official web site (English)&lt;/ref&gt; Hiroaki Kikuoka, a [[shamisen]] player, created a presidential system for his group,&lt;ref name=Metropolis&gt;[http://metropolis.co.jp/biginjapanarchive299/266/biginjapaninc.htm "Hiroaki Kikuoka"], Metropolis&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Koto (instrument)|koto]] player [[Michiyo Yagi]] has rejected both the ''iemoto'' system and the traditional style of her instrument, choosing to strike [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref name=Weekend&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1406597 "Japanese Classical Music"], Weekend Edition Sunday, August 24, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
* Initial idea and development of a beta-version of the platform in 2008 by founder Jonas Liepmann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/wiredcampus/american-mooc-providers-face-international-competition/44637, Grossman, Sara in The Chronicle of Higher Education: “American MOOC Providers Face International Competition”], 5 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* This startup is said to have begun in 2011 and offered online collaboration tools for [[Learning Management|learning management]] with Hannes Klöpper as the co-founder and the second managing director.&lt;ref name="Lomas"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/09/online-learning-platform-iversity-gets-a-lifeline-from-holtzbrinck-media-group/|title=Online learning platform iversity gets a lifeline from Holtzbrinck media group|last=Lomas|first=Natasha|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* in 2012 iversity decided to become a European-based MOOC platform&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wiredacademic.com/2013/07/5-questions-with-an-edtech-startup-hannes-klopper-of-berlin-based-mooc-provider-iversity/, Wired Academic: "5 Questions With An EdTech Startup: Hannes Klöpper of Berlin-based MOOC provider ‘iversity"], 4 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Spring 2013 – iversity and the [[Stifterverband für die Deutsche Wissenschaft]] launched “The MOOC Production Fellowship” as a competition for online course concepts. A jury chose 10 of the best MOOC concepts out of more than 250 entries. The winners were each awarded €25,000 for the production of their courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-raises-funding, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: “Online education platform iversity raises funding from T-Venture and new CEO”], 16 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/en/pages/advisory-board, iversity: “Press Release: iversity creates Advisory Board”], 18 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwertig.com/2014/01/29/zwei-jahre-spaeter-15-heise-startups-aus-berlin-und-was-aus-ihnen-geworden-ist/, Weigert, Martin in Netzwertig: “Zwei Jahre später - heiße Startups aus Berlin und was aus ihnen geworden ist”], 29 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In October 2013 iversity relaunched as a platform for online courses, initially with 10 courses and 115,000 registered users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://venturevillage.eu/iversity-stifterverband-mooc-fellowship, Fowler, Nina in Venture Village: "Professors, want to teach online?

* In January 2014 online learners were able to take the first paid final, on-site exams, through which iversity earned its first revenues.
* In October 2014, exactly one year since the relaunch, iversity's total funding reached over €5 million.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2014/02/19/iversity-500k-sign-ups/, Lomas, Natasha in Tech Crunch: “European Online Education Startup, iversity, Gets ~500k Course Sign-Ups In First 4-Months”], 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edukwest.eu/hedline-iversity-nears-500-000-enrollments/, Alexander, Kay in Edukwest: “iversity Nears 500.000 Enrollments”], 20 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Courses ==

[[Massive Open Online Course]]s (MOOCs) harness visual elements (lecture videos, animations, graphics), interactive elements (simulations) and written materials (scientific articles).&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/07/08/moocs-and-economic-reality/, Shirky, Clay in The Chronicle of Higher Education:  "MOOCs and Economic Reality"], 8 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bohle"&gt;[http://www.scilogs.com/scientific_and_medical_libraries/librarians-and-the-era-of-the-mooc/, Bohle, Shannon in SciLogs: “Librarians and the Era of the MOOC”], 11 Mai 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsok.com/first-massive-open-online-course-at-university-of-oklahoma-to-feature-graphic-novel/article/3759503?custom_click=lead_story_title, Price, Matthew in The Oklahoman: "First massive open online course at University of Oklahoma to feature graphic novel"], 1 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/Dont-Call-Them-Textbooks/136835/, Young, Jeffrey R. in The Chronicle of Higher Education: "The Object Formerly Known as the Textbook"], 27 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; All elements can be reviewed at any time. Instructor and course participants can interact with each other in discussion forums.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/blog/user-interaction-learning-iversity-looks-like-iii/, iversity: “User Interaction: What learning at iversity looks like”], 13 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Instructors can use quizzes to get feedback on the learning progress of the course participants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/blog/learning-iversity-looks-like-breaking-90-minute-lecture/, iversity: "What learning at iversity looks like: Breaking down the 90 minute lecture"], 26 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Most iversity courses end with a final assessment or exam. Exams can be taken on-site, online as “[[proctor]]ed-exam” or in form of a final project that has to be handed in to the instructor.

Students at iversity.org can choose between different study paths, resulting in different certificates. “Statement of Participation” is free-of-charge, other certificates come with varying costs – depending on which level of certification the student chooses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailyfinance.com/2014/04/16/mooc-great-college-classes-free/, Kraft-Linder, Annalisa in Daily Finance: “MOOCs: What’s A Great College Class Worth When It’s Free?”], 16 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edcetera.rafter.com/verified-certificates-moocs-money-maker-or-anachronism/, Winkler, Kirsten in Edcetera: “Verified Certificates – MOOC’s Money Maker or Anachronism?”], 24 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Universities that offer a course at iversity have the option of offering European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System ([[European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System|ECTS]]) credits. This track allows students to receive credits from their course and apply them to their university studies. ECTS Credits can be used at any European Higher Education Institution. A certificate that awards ECTS credits is issued once the participant has passed an on-site or online proctored exam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-magazin.net/2014/03/virtuell-lernen-mit-moocs-das-prinzip-und-die-vorteile-von-massive-open-online-courses-37321.html, Strobel, Marisa in M-Magazin: “Virtuell lernen mit MOOCs”], 5 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://iversity.org/en/pages/enrolments-revenue, iversity: “Online Education Platform iversity.org On The Road To Success”], 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Enrolment to courses is free, costs only apply when purchasing certificates.

For the production of courses, iversity collaborates with European universities and individual professors. Lecturers design their own MOOCs with technical support from iversity. 
iversity cooperates with institutions such as 
* [[Libera Università Internazionale degli Studi Sociali Guido Carli]] (LUISS)
* [[RWTH Aachen]]
* [[University of Buckingham]]
* [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP)
* [[Hertie School of Governance]]
* [[European University Institute]]
* [[University of Tubingen]]
* [[University of Mainz]]
* [[Reutlingen University]] (''Hochschule Reutlingen'' in German)

== Business Model ==
iversity earns revenue through the sale of certificates, which online learners receive after successfully completing courses on iversity.org thereby catering to all types of learners, among them working professionals who need to document their learning achievements and university students.&lt;ref name="bohle" /&gt; Some courses at iversity can be integrated into the student's [[diploma]] through the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS).
iversity has raised more than €5 million in [[venture capital]]. The investors are T-Venture, bmp media investors, BFB Frühphasenfonds, Masoud Kamali, Westtech Ventures, CRALS, Peter Zühlsdorf and Kontor B45.
The iversity Advisory board consists of Dr. Jörg Dräger and Prof. Édouard Husson.

'''Joanna Priestley'''
'''Joanna Priestley''' is a contemporary film director, producer, animator and teacher. She lives and works in [[Portland, Oregon]].

==Early life and education==
Priestley was born in Portland, Oregon to Mae Irene and Arthur James Priestley. She grew up in a wooded area near the Willamette River with horses, dogs, a cat and a huge collection of comic books. Priestley began experimenting with animation early in her life. In an interview with Harvey Deneroff&lt;ref&gt;http://www.skwigly.co.uk/joanna-priestley-independent-animator/&lt;/ref&gt; she explained: "One of the first toys I was given was a zoetrope, which worked on a little turntable and had little zoetrope strips with it. I loved it! I'm sure I became an animator because of that toy. Then I started drawing on the corners of my textbooks in grade school, and later studied art in high school and college, where I specializing in painting and printmaking."

==Education==
Priestley studied painting and animation at [[Rhode Island School of Design]] and received a BFA in Art (with a minor in Art History) from the [[University of California at Berkeley]], graduating with honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelspornanimation.com/splog/?p=2724|title=Michael Sporn Animation – Splog » Joanna Priestley|website=www.michaelspornanimation.com|accessdate=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her final year there she produced thousands of posters used in protests against the Vietnam War and she was the Art Department representative to the Ad Hoc Committee to End the War.

Priestley received a Master of Fine Arts in Experimental Animation from the [[California Institute of the Arts]], where she received the Louis B. Mayer Award. For two years she was the teaching assistant for famed abstract animator [[Jules Engel]]. Priestley made the first computer animated film at Cal Arts, "Jade Leaf" (1985), using the Cubicomp, early animation hardware that was purchased by Cal Arts in the fall of 1984. Priestley and Engel co-directed "Times Square" (1986), also using the Cubicomp&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0893609/reference|title=Times Square (1986)|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; to generate images and recording them on a 16mm Bolex camera on a tripod, positioned in front of the monitor.

[[File:Mantegna, madonna della vittoria, dettaglio 01.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of the coral]]
The '''''Madonna della Vittoria''''' is a painting by the Italian [[Renaissance]] painter [[Andrea Mantegna]]; the painting was executed in 1496.

==History==
On 6 July 1495 the French army of [[Charles VIII of France]], retreating from Italy after the [[Italian War of 1494–98|French Invasion of 1494-1498]], fought the Italic League at the [[Battle of Fornovo]].  The League, commanded by [[Francesco II Gonzaga]], Marquess of Mantua, was made up of numerous nation-states determined to prevent French dominance in Italy, and included the Holy Roman Empire, Spain, Venice, Milan, and the Papal States controlled by [[Pope Alexander VI]].  Though the League lost more soldiers, they had also captured more soldiers than had the French; they also recovered nearly all of the plunder the French had taken over the course of their four-year invasion.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Particularly valued items included the helmet, sword, and seal of Charles VIII, as well as a book containing portraits of the ladies whose favors he had enjoyed during the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cesare Borgia|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|publisher=Macmillan|year=1976|isbn=0025144006|location=New York|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Francesco's absence from Mantua, Daniele da Norsa, a Jewish banker, had purchased a house in the city's San Simone quarter and replaced the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] which decorated its façade with his own coat of arms. The regent, [[Sigismondo Gonzaga]], ordered him to restore the depiction. Although Daniele agreed to do so, the populace, inflamed by anti-semitic feeling, destroyed his house.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
[[File:Mantegna, madonna della vittoria, dettaglio 03, francesco Gonzaga.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Detail of Francesco Gonzaga]]
When Francesco returned, he forced Daniele to fund a chapel and a devotional painting. The painting was to be executed by the Mantuan court painter, Mantegna, and was inaugurated in 1496 on the anniversary of the duke's victory at Fornovo. The work was placed in the church of [[Santa Maria della Vittoria (Mantua)|Santa Maria della Vittoria]], which had been constructed over the ruins of Daniele da Norsa's house.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The painting was one of the works looted by the French during the [[Napoleonic Wars|Napoleonic invasion of Italy]], and by 1798 was being exhibited in the [[Louvre]]. The painting was never returned; the given excuse was that its large size made the transport difficult. The presence of a [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]] in the painting is being investigated by historians as it may have implications on our understanding of 15th-century trading networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.melbourne.edu/news/aussie-bird-renaissance-artwork-forces-history-rethink "Aussie bird in Renaissance artwork forces history rethink"], melbourne.edu, 19 March 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
The altarpiece shows Francesco Gonzaga paying homage to Mary, who sits on a high throne decorated with marbles [[intarsia]]s and [[bas-relief]]s. The base of the throne, with lion paws, has, within a medallion, the inscription "{{Lang|la|REGINA/CELI LET./ALLELVIA}}" (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, Alleluia); it lies on a circular basement with a bas-relief of the "[[Original Sin]]" and other stories from the [[Book of Genesis]] which are partly obscured by the praying figures. The throne's back has a large solar disc, decorated with weavings and [[Wikt:vitreous|vitreous]] pearls.

The child Jesus, who holds two red flowers (symbols of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]) and Mary look at Francesco Gonzaga, who is kneeling and has a grateful and smiling expression while receiving their blessing. The protection given to Gonzaga during the battle is also symbolized by Mary's mantle, which partially covers his head. Opposite to the donor are [[St. John the Baptist]] with a cross featuring the usual [[Cartouche (design)|cartouche]] saying "{{Lang|la|ECCE/[[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|AGNVS/DEI]] ECCE/Q[VI] TOLL/IT P[ECCATA] M[VNDI]}}" (Behold the [[Lamb of God]], which takes away the sins of the world), and his mother, [[Elizabeth (biblical figure)|St. Elizabeth]], protector of [[Isabella d'Este]], wife of Francesco Gonzaga. The choice of St. Elizabeth in the place of a patron may have been chosen as a message of judgement to the Norsa who were made to pay for the work as a penalty for removing an image of the Madonna from their home.  Unlike the Norsa, St. Elizabeth who is represented as a Jewess in a yellow turban, was said to be the first to recognize the sanctity of Mary.&lt;ref name="The Yellow Turban: Unraveling Andrea Mantegna's Enigmatic Representation of the Jewish Woman"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yarmo|first1=Leslie|title=Associate Professor|url=https://www.academia.edu/24345342/The_Yellow_Turban_Unraveling_Andrea_Mantegnas_Enigmatic_Representation_of_the_Jewish_Woman|website=Academia.edu|publisher=Casa Editrice La Giuntina.|accessdate=31 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the sides are two couples of standing saints: in the foreground are two military saints, the archangel [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]] with a sword and [[St. Longinus]] with a broken spear, donning richly decorated armors; behind them are [[St. Andrew]], patron saint of Mantua, with a long stick with the cross and [[St. George]], another military saint, with a helmet and a long red lance.

The scene is set in an [[apse]] formed by a [[pergola]] of leaves, flowers and fruits, with several birds; the pergola's frame has at the top a shell (an attribute of the Virgin as new [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]]), from which hang threads of [[coral]] pearls and [[rock crystal]], as well as a large piece of red coral, another hint to the Passion of Jesus. The [[parrot]] is a comment on the birth of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Lajos Kalmár: "Der intellektuelle Hintergrund der Vogeldarstellungen der [[Victorinus]]-[[Corvina]].

'''Metarealism''' is a direction in [[Russian poetry]] and art that was born in the 1970s to the 1980s. The term was first used by [[Mikhail Epstein|Mikhail Epshtein]], who coined it in 1981 and made it public in the Soviet magazine "Voprosy Literatury" in 1983; see below his "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" from 1983 and the following years [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html] Also: Third Wave: The New Russian Poetry. Ed. K. Johnson &amp; S. M. Ashby. Preface by M. Epshtein, A. Wachtel, [[Alexei Parshchikov|A. Parshchikov]]. University of Michigan Press, 1992 {{ISBN|0-472-06415-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;10, 53, 184 [https://books.google.com/books?id=czhO4m4yjZUC&amp;pg=RA1-PA173&amp;lpg=RA1-PA173&amp;dq=metarealism+poetry&amp;source=web&amp;ots=9zVPX-rMeG&amp;sig=gKOXtyHheDWHsGEgc15Vh1Gknf4#PPP1,M1], Tom Epstein's essay «Metarealism» in the anthology Crossing Centuries: The New Generations in Russian Poetry. Ed. High, John. NY: Talisman House Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|1-883689-90-2}}, {{ISBN|978-1-883689-90-2}}, p.&amp;nbsp;87-89, and [[Marjorie Perloff]] "Russian Postmodernism: An Oxymoron?" in Postmodern Culture, Volume 3, # 2, January 1993 [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/postmodern_culture/v003/3.2perloff.html].

M. Epshtein insists that in its philosophic dimension metarealism is "[[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] realism," while "stylistically" metarealism is "[[metaphorical]]" realism. (See the most detailed explanation and exposition of this term in Epshtein's articles "Theses on Metarealism and Conceptualism" [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.concept.metareal.html], "A Catalogue of the New Poetries" (Russian version) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} and in its English version [http://www.emory.edu/INTELNET/e.pm.catalog.poetry.html] Thus, "meta" means both "through" and "beyond" the reality that we all can see; hence, "metarealism" is the realism of the hyperphysical nature of things. The main expression of its essence is given through a non-visual [[metaphor]] or, according to another Epshtein's term, a "metabola" (rather than [[hyperbole]]), that means "transfer" or "transition," opening many dimensions. [See part 3 in {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904005720/http://modernpoetry.by.ru/proekt/epshtein.htm |date=September 4, 2007 }} "Metabola" is different from the [[symbol]] or a "visual" metaphor, because it assumes the interosculation of realities. See: M.Epshtein. After the Future: the Paradoxes of Postmodernism &amp; Contemporary Russian Culture. [[University of Massachusetts Press]], 1995, 416 p.&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|0-87023-973-2}}, {{ISBN|0-87023-974-0}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;40–50. Metarealism has very little to do with [[surrealism]], since it appeals to the [[superconscious]] and not to the [[subconscious]], thus opening up a many-dimensional perception of the world.

Metarealism further gained traction after it became a subject of the House of Artists debate at an exhibition of the [[Hyperreality|Hyperrealists]], where its utility was discussed as a new method of creation to overcome traditional realism.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Knowledge Communication: Transparency, Democracy, Global Governance|last=Mesaros|first=Caludiu|publisher=Editura Universității de Vest|year=2011|isbn=9789731253497|location=|pages=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==What is metarealism?==

[http://www.metarealism.com Metarealism] is synonymous to metaconscience, which means beyond psychological consciousness, beyond a subjective psychological polarized view of reality. Metarealism seeks to depict the reality which exists beyond that psychological subjective perspective. Metarealism proposes not only to communicate further than the pictorial aspect of the perception of other dimensions of reality, but also the essence of those dimensions and their relation to us as human beings. Metarealism then becomes a tool for the evolution of consciousness; just like in the old days when artists painted sacred art to depict their vision of the reality they perceived, through their spiritual interpretation of other dimensions. Thus, Epstein explained that the entire history of world art is the premise and source of metarealism, particularly its condensed codes, encyclopedic summaries, and extracts.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Russian Postmodernism: New Perspectives on Post-Soviet Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|last2=Genis|first2=Alexander|last3=Vladiv-Glover|first3=Slobodanka|publisher=Berghahn Books|year=2016|isbn=9781782388647|location=New York|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, metabola or metabole is derived from the dictionary and a microencyclopedia of culture, compressed and translated from one language to another so that it pertains to a reality consisted of interpenetration of different consubstantial realities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; For Epstein, metarealism is an attempt to return to the word the fullness of its [[Literal and figurative language|figurative]] and transcendent meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=After the Future: The Paradoxes of Postmodernism and Contemporary Russian Culture|last=Epstein|first=Mikhail|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=1995|isbn=0870239732|location=Amherst|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metarealism could be also considered a sacred art, in that it also tries to depict, through a [metaconscious] perspective, the essence of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind. Meta meaning, a [[holistic]] view of reality as perceived by a metaconscious mind, who sees reality as a whole rather than from a subjective personalized intellectually fragmented point of view. Metarealism is the materialization in pictorial form of the reality of other dimensions and their direct effect, and relation upon us. Metarealism tries to depict the relations between those dimensions of reality and how we psychologically interpret them through our sub mental symbolism. As a narrative style, metarealism does not have a clearly defined lyrical hero and focuses instead on the so-called sum of perceptions, which is "the geometrical space constituted by points of view.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Metarealism in visual art==

According to Bernard De Montréal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |title=Bernard de Montreal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170114114543/http://www.psychologie-alternative.com/Bernard%20de%20Montreal.htm |archive-date=2017-01-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; most contemporary visual arts are involutionary art that expresses the dissimulated frustrations and struggle of the unconscious self in her search for real identity through the [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoric]], sub mental symbolism of the art form an [[avocation]] of the soul that has little in common with the interdimensional identity of the self.

Conscious or mental art "metarealism" when created by an metaconscious artist is inspired from the higher self, and is a channel for the dictation of the conscious science of art, instead of being simply a lower form of self-expression, a cultural artefact of relative value.

The mental artist has little need for unconscious expression and directs her creative "expiration" toward the exploration of higher consciousness through her art, rather than simply entertaining a fictitious role. Art in its astral form belongs to our kind of civilization. We still need its contention that there is more to reality than appears at first sight. Art in its higher form is therefore created by a totally new human being.

The '''''Nativity with St. Francis and St. Lawrence''''' (also known as '''''The Adoration''''')  is a painting traditionally believed to have been created in 1609 by the Italian Baroque master [[Caravaggio]]. Recent discoveries link the painting to that commissioned by Fabio Nuti in April 1600, and thus sent from Rome to Palermo.

It was stolen on October 18, 1969 from the [[Oratorio di San Lorenzo]] in [[Palermo]], Sicily.

The painting, which hung above the altar, was large, measuring almost six square metres (actual size 268&amp;nbsp;cm x 197&amp;nbsp;cm). Probably because of its size, it was removed from its frame by two thieves&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt; before being taken out of the church. After it was stolen, the Oratory was pillaged of other art, along with choir stalls of carved and gilded wood and benches inlaid with [[precious wood]]s and mother of pearl. {{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

The local [[Sicilian Mafia]] are generally considered to be the prime culprits in the theft although nobody actually knows who committed the crime. The whereabouts of the work remain unknown to this day. Rumours of its destruction during the theft, or subsequently in the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]], have circulated from time to time as has the notion that the masterpiece is now hidden abroad. In 1996, [[Francesco Marino Mannoia]], an informant and former member of the Sicilian Mafia, claimed he had stolen the painting as a young man on the orders of a high-ranking mobster, but other sources say it was stolen by amateurs and then sold on to various Mafiosi; at one point it is said to have ended up in the hands of [[Rosario Riccobono]], who was killed in 1982, after which it passed on to [[Gerlando Alberti]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2005/02/05/bacara105.xml Will we ever see it again?], The Daily Telegraph, February 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a former Mafia figure turned police informer, claimed that he was told in 1999 that the painting was stolen for a private collector but had been destroyed by rats and pigs while hidden in a farm outbuilding and the remains burned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6950256.ece Lost Caravaggio painting 'was burnt by Mafia'] Times Online, December 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/nov/28/arts.italy Mafia informer asked to solve mystery of stolen Caravaggio], The Guardian, November 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Nativity'' is one of the most famous unrecovered stolen works of art; its theft is on the [[FBI]]'s top ten list of art crimes.&lt;ref name="fbi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Theft of Caravaggio’s Nativity with San Lorenzo and San Francesco |url=https://www.fbi.gov/investigate/violent-crime/art-theft/fbi-top-ten-art-crimes/nativity-with-san-lorenzo-and-san-francesco |website=Federal Bureau of Investigation |accessdate=25 October 2018 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The value, if the work was ever sold, is estimated to be $20 million&lt;ref name="fbi"/&gt;; though resale value on the black market, especially for an infamous work of art, is nowhere near the actual value.

In 2016, a reproduction of the painting was commissioned by [[Sky plc|Sky]] and produced by [[Factum Arte]]. The replica was then permanently installed in the chapel, in the place of the original, with an official ceremony in the presence of the President of the Republic, [[Sergio Mattarella]]. In the same year, Sky produced the international documentary "[[Mystery of the Lost Caravaggio]]" by [[Sky Arts Production Hub]], which tells the story of the Nativity and the life of the artist. Through interviews and archive material, the documentary tells the story of the theft of the work in 1969, the process of reproduction and the technologies used to recreate the Nativity. The documentary debuted on January 27, 2017 on [[Sky Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neuendorf|first1=Henri|title=Caravaggio Masterpiece Stolen in Notorious Mafia Heist Replaced with Replica|journal=Artnet News|date=December 11, 2015|url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/stolen-caravaggio-replaced-replica-391166}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirchgaessner|first1=Stephanie|title='Restitution of a lost beauty': Caravaggio Nativity replica brought to Palermo|journal=The Guardian|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/10/restitution-lost-beauty-stolen-caravaggio-nativity-replica-brought-palermo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Squires|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=The Telegraph|date=December 10, 2015|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/12044479/How-a-long-lost-Caravaggio-masterpiece-was-recreated-nearly-50-years-after-it-was-stolen.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vivarelli|first1=Nick|title= How a long-lost Caravaggio masterpiece was recreated, nearly 50 years after it was stolen|journal=Variety|date=December 18, 2015|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/global/murdoch-owned-sky-paybox-mixes-philanthropy-and-production-with-operation-caravaggio-1201662897/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zalewski|first1=Daniel|last2=Bradford|first2=Harry |title=The Factory of Fakes|journal=The New Yorker|date=November 28, 2016|pages=75, 77|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-factory-of-fakes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Old Custom House Inn''' is located at 69 and 71 Watergate Street, [[Chester]], [[Cheshire]], England.  It is recorded in the [[National Heritage List for England]] as a designated Grade&amp;nbsp;II [[Listed building#England and Wales|listed building]].&lt;ref name=nhl&gt;{{NHLE |num= 1376449|desc= The Old Custom House Inn, Chester|accessdate= 31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The inn originated from two former houses, their [[undercroft]]s now forming the inn's cellars.  The older house, on the east side, is dated 1637, and the west house dates probably from the early 18th century.  Part of [[Chester Rows]] formerly passed through the buildings, but this was enclosed in 1711.  The inn also incorporates a former cottage to its rear built on a [[burgage]] plot.  When it opened as an inn it was called The Star Inn, but later changed its name in the late 18th&amp;nbsp;century because the [[Custom House, Chester|custom house of the port of Chester]] stood opposite.  The building has been altered on a number of occasions, most recently in the 1990s when an extension was added to the rear of the former west house.&lt;ref name=lang&gt;{{Citation |editor1-last= Langtree|editor1-first= Stephen|editor2-last= Comyns|editor2-first= Alan| year = 2001| title = 2000 Years of Building: Chester's Architectural Legacy| publication-place = Chester| place = | publisher = Chester Civic Trust| pages = | page = 101| format = | id = | isbn = 0-9540152-0-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==

The former east house is constructed with [[sandstone]] in the lower storey, and [[timber framing]] above.  It has an undercroft, and two storeys plus an attic.  On the side facing Watergate Street is a [[gable]], an entrance door, a beer-drop door, and a five-light [[transom (architectural)|transomed]] window in the lower storey.  Between the storeys is a [[bressumer]] carved with vine leaves, grapes, and the initials "T.W.A.".  The upper storey contains a seven-light transomed [[oriel window]], with a small two-light window on each side.  Around these windows are panels, some of which are plain, the others arched.  The gable is [[jettying|jettied]] and carries the date 1637.  It contains a three-light [[mullion]]ed [[casement window]] with herringbone struts at the sides and above it.  The [[bargeboard]]s are plain.  The former west house has a [[stucco|rendered]] lower storey, and a brick upper storey.  It has a doorway and two three-light windows in the lower storey, and [[sash window]]s above.  The former cottage at the rear is in [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] style.  It is constructed in brick on a sandstone [[plinth]], with a grey [[slate]] roof.  It contains sash windows, and two [[dormer]]s in the gables above.&lt;ref name=nhl/&gt;  Many alterations have been carried out to the interior of the inn, but it does retain oak beams dating from about 1642, and a carved stone fireplace.&lt;ref name=lang/&gt;

'''Peripeteia''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|ɛr|ə|p|ᵻ|ˈ|t|aɪ|.|ə}} ({{lang-el|περιπέτεια}}) is a reversal of circumstances, or turning point. The term is primarily used with reference to works of literature. The Anglicized form of ''peripeteia'' is '''peripety'''.

==Aristotle's view==
[[Aristotle]], in his [[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]], defines peripeteia as "a change by which the action veers round to its opposite, subject always to our rule of probability or necessity." According to [[Aristotle]], peripeteia, along with discovery, is the most effective when it comes to [[drama]], particularly in a [[tragedy]]. He wrote that "The finest form of Discovery is one attended by Peripeteia, like that which goes with the Discovery in [[Oedipus]]...".&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [[Poetics]], 1452a&lt;/ref&gt;

Aristotle says that peripeteia is the most powerful part of a plot in a tragedy along with discovery. A peripety is the change of the kind described from one state of things within the play to its opposite, and that too in the way we are saying, in the probable or necessary sequence of events. There is often no element like Peripeteia; it can bring forth or result in terror, mercy, or in comedies it can bring a smile or it can bring forth tears (Rizo). This is the best way to spark and maintain attention throughout the various form and genres of drama "Tragedy imitates good actions and, thereby, measures and depicts the well-being of its protagonist. But in his formal definition, as well as throughout the Poetics, Aristotle emphasizes that" ... Tragedy is an imitation not only of a complete action, but also of events inspiring fear or pity" (1452a 1); in fact, at one point [[Aristotle]] isolates the imitation of "actions that excite pity and fear" as "the distinctive mark of tragic imitation" (1452b 30). Pity and fear are effected through reversal and recognition; and these "most powerful elements of emotional interest in Tragedy-Peripeteia or Reversal of the Situation, and recognition scenes-are parts of the plot (1450a 32). has the shift of the tragic protagonist's fortune from good to bad, which is essential to the plot of a tragedy. It is often an ironic twist. Good uses of Peripeteia are those that especially are parts of a complex plot, so that they are defined by their changes of fortune being accompanied by reversal, recognition, or both" (Smithson).

Peripeteia includes [[character arc|changes of character]], but also more external changes.  A character who becomes rich and famous from poverty and obscurity has undergone peripeteia, even if his character remains the same.

When a character learns something he had been previously ignorant of, this is normally distinguished from peripeteia as [[anagnorisis]] or discovery, a distinction derived from Aristotle's work.

Aristotle considered anagnorisis, leading to peripeteia, the mark of a superior tragedy.  Two such plays are ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', where the oracle's information that Oedipus had killed [[Laius|his father]] and married [[Jocasta|his mother]] brought about his mother's death and his own blindness and exile, and ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'', where Iphigenia realizes that the strangers she is to sacrifice are her brother and his friend, resulting in all three of them escaping Tauris. These plots he considered complex and superior to simple plots without anagnorisis or peripeteia, such as when Medea resolves to kill her children, knowing they are her children, and does so. Aristotle identified ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' as the principal work demonstrating peripety.  (See Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.)

==Examples==

===''Oedipus Rex''===
In Sophocles' ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', the peripeteia occurs towards the end of the play when the Messenger brings Oedipus news of his parentage.  In the play, Oedipus is fated to murder his father and marry his mother.  His parents, Laius and Jocasta, try to forestall the oracle by sending their son away to be killed, but he is actually raised by Polybus and his wife, Merope, the rulers of another kingdom.  The irony of the Messenger’s information is that it was supposed to comfort Oedipus and assure him that he was the son of Polybus. Unfortunately for Oedipus, the Messenger says, "Polybus was nothing to you, [Oedipus] that’s why, not in blood" (Sophocles 1113).  The Messenger received Oedipus from one of Laius’ servants and then gave him to Polybus.  The plot comes together when Oedipus realizes that he is the son and murderer of Laius as well as the son and husband of Jocasta.  Martin M. Winkler says that here, peripeteia and [[Anagnorisis|anagnôrisis]] occur at the same time "for the greatest possible impact" because Oedipus has been "struck a blow from above, as if by fate or the gods. He is changing from the mighty and somewhat arrogant king of Thebes to a figure of woe" (Winkler 57).

===Conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus===
{{main|Conversion of Paul}}
The instantaneous conversion of Paul on the road to Damascus is a classic example of ''peripeteia'', which [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] presented in his ''Life of Constantine'' as a pattern for the equally revelatory conversion of [[Constantine I|Constantine]]. Modern biographers of Constantine see his conversion less as a momentary phenomenon than as a step in a lifelong process.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Paul Stephenson, ''Constantine, Roman Emperor, Christian Victor'' 2010: the ''trope'' of peripaty is discussed in "Constantine's Conversion", pp168f.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Three Apples===
In "[[The Three Apples]]", a medieval ''[[One Thousand and One Nights|Arabian Nights]]'', after the murderer reveals himself near the middle of the story, he explains his reasons behind the murder in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], which begins with him going on a journey to find three rare apples for his wife, but after returning finds out she cannot eat them due to her lingering illness. Later at work, he sees a slave passing by with one of those apples claiming that he received it from his girlfriend, a married woman with three such apples her husband gave her. He returns home and demands his wife to show him all three apples, but she only shows him two. This convinces him of her [[infidelity]] and he murders her as a result. After he disposes of her body, he returns home where his son confesses that he had stolen one of the apples and that a slave, to whom he had told about his father's journey, had fled with it. The murderer thus realizes his guilt and regrets what he has just done.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=86–95}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=240–1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second use of peripety occurs near the end. After finding out about the culprit behind the murder, the protagonist [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] is ordered by [[Harun al-Rashid]] to find the [[tricky slave]] within three days, or else he will have Ja'far executed instead. After the deadline has passed, Ja'far prepares to be executed for his failure and bids his family farewell. As he hugs his youngest daughter, he feels a round object in her pocket, which is revealed to be the same apple that the culprit was holding. In the story's twist ending, the daughter reveals that she obtained it from their slave, Rayhan. Ja'far thus realizes that his own slave was the culprit all along. He then finds Rayhan and solves the case, preventing his own execution. That was a [[plot twist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights|first=David|last=Pinault|publisher=[[Brill Publishers]]|year=1992|isbn=90-04-09530-6|pages=95–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Arabian Nights Reader|first=Ulrich|last=Marzolph|publisher=[[Wayne State University Press]]|year=2006|isbn=0-8143-3259-5|pages=241–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Piano Lesson''''' depicts the living room of [[Henri Matisse]]{{'}}s home in [[Issy-les-Moulineaux]], with his elder son, [[Pierre Matisse|Pierre]], at the piano, the artist's sculpture ''Decorative Figure'' (1908), at bottom left, and, at upper right, his painting ''[[Woman on a High Stool]]''. Matisse began with a naturalistic drawing, but he eliminated detail as he worked, scraping down areas and rebuilding them broad fields of color. The painting evokes a specific moment in time—light suddenly turned on in a darkening interior—by the triangle of shadow on the boy's face and the rhyming green triangle of light falling on the garden. The artist's incising on the window frame and stippling on the left side produce a pitted quality that suggests the eroding effects of light or time, a theme reiterated by the presence of the metronome and burning candle on the piano.&lt;ref&gt;"MoMA | The Collection | Henri Matisse.

This painting, ''The Moroccans'' (1915), and ''Bathers by a River'' (1909–10, May–November 1913, and early spring 1916–October (?) 1917&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/artwork/79307|publisher=Art Institute of Chicago|accessdate=2013-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were all painted at the time of the [[Battle of Verdun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spurling|first=Hillary|title=Matisse the Master: a life of Henri Matisse: volume two, 1909-1954|year=2005|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=9780241133392|page=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Portsmouth and District Magic Circle (PDMC)''' is a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]s' society based in [[Portsmouth]] in the English county of [[Hampshire]]. It is one of the largest magic societies in the UK with nearly 100 members.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Mischa (11 January 2012 ). [http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/lifestyle/now-that-s-magic-1-3405614 "Now that's magic!"], ''Portsmouth News''&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was founded in 1938 at a meeting in the Talbot Hotel in Portsmouth. Amongst its founding members were the close-up magician [[Lewis Ganson]] and the master illusionist [[Will Ayling]], author of ''The Art of Illusion'' and ''Oriental Conjuring and Magic''.&lt;ref&gt;Windsor, John (27 February 1993).

The society organizes an annual event called "Jumbo Day" in which magicians from around the UK gather to trade and sell magic equipment and paraphernalia and attend workshops and demonstrations. The event closes with a gala magic show in the evening. According to the PDMC, "Jumbo Day" is southern England's "largest annual one-day magic event."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portsmouthmagic.co.uk PDMC official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Members also raise money for the [[Anthony Nolan Trust]] with "Magic Trek", a sponsored walk from the headquarters of the PDMC in Portsmouth to the headquarters of [[The Magic Circle (organisation)|The Magic Circle]] in London, stopping off at various magic societies along the route. The first "Magic Trek" took place in 2009 led by PDMC member Sean Lobban dressed in a giant bunny costume accompanied by an [[escapologist]], a [[juggler]], a magician, and several other entertainers.&lt;ref&gt;''Portsmouth News'' (3 March 2009).

'''''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint''''' ({{lang-de|Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte}}) (1874; second edition 1924) is an 1874 book by the Austrian philosopher [[Franz Brentano]], in which the author argues that the goal of psychology should be to establish exact laws. Brentano's best known book, it established his reputation as a philosopher, helped to establish [[psychology]] as a scientific discipline, and influenced developments such as [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Husserlian phenomenology]], [[analytic philosophy]], [[gestalt psychology]], and [[Alexius Meinong]]'s theory of objects. It has been called Brentano's greatest work, and compared to [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s ''Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie'' and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology''. However, the results that Brentano produces from his method in ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' have been described as "deadly dull and nearly vacuous."

==Background and publishing history==
Brentano was at work on ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' in 1873, while travelling in Europe after leaving the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and resigning from his position at the University of [[Würzburg]]. He completed the first two books of the work in March 1874. Brentano originally intended to produce a large work consisting of six books, the first five of which would cover psychology as a science, mental phenomena in general, and their three basic classes, while the sixth would deal with the mind-body problem, the soul, and immortality. However, Brentano was ill with smallpox after publishing the first two books. The work remained incomplete. In 1911, Brentano published book two of ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' under the new title ''Von der Klassifikation der psychischen Phänomene'', with the addition of remarks explaining his later views, where they differed from those he held in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sim95|Simons 1995]]. pp. xiv-xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' was first published as ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkte'', but subsequent editions were published as ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt'', which is the more commonly cited name. The first edition was designated Volume 1, but this was also abandoned in later editions.&lt;ref name="Simons"&gt;[[#Sim95|Simons 1995]]. p. xiii.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1924, after Brentano's death, the book was published in a new edition, which included explanatory notes by Oskar Kraus.&lt;ref name="Simons" /&gt;

==Summary==
Discussing [[Karl Robert Eduard von Hartmann|Eduard von Hartmann]]'s ''[[Philosophy of the Unconscious]]'' (1869), Brentano comments that Hartmann "uses the term 'consciousness' to refer to something different from what we do. He defines consciousness as 'the emancipation of the idea from the will...and the opposition of the will to this emancipation,' and as 'the bewilderment of the will over the ''existence'' of the idea, which existence the will does not want but which, nevertheless, is sensibly present.' Brentano suggests that Hartmann's definition of consciousness perhaps refers to "something purely imaginary", and certainly does not agree with Brentano's definition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bre95|Brentano 1995]]. p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Psychology from an Empirical Stanpoint'' is Brentano's best-known book,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Bau05|Baumgartner 2005]]. p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; and much has been written about its "intentionality passage", quoted above.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;[[#Smi96|Smith 1996]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Brentano reintroduced the concept of intentionality into the [[philosophy of mind]]. However, the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], writing in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986), describes the intentionality passage of ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' as both obscure and hesitant. Scruton believes that the obscurity of the passage is "compounded by Brentano's description of intentionality as the mark which distinguishes mental ''phenomena'' from physical ''phenomena'', the latter being described, not as objective features of the natural world, but as appearances." According to Scruton, while in later editions of ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' Brentano described intentionality as a property of mental activity, and characterized it as a kind of "mental reference", Brentano never makes clear precisely what kind of property he believes it to be anywhere in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scr94|Scruton 1994]]. p. 378.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' has been compared to Sigmund Freud's early metapsychology, especially as expressed in his ''Project for a Scientific Psychology''. [[Paul Vitz]], who calls ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' Brentano's greatest work, notes that while Brentano rejected the unconscious, "his answer followed largely from his definitions of consciousness and unconsciousness, and the evidence subsequently available to Freud did not, of course, figure in Brentano's thought."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Vit88|Vitz 1988]]. pp. 51-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Clark Glymour]] writes that ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' "gave Freud one vision of what psychology should seek to know, and of what methods it should use." According to Glymour, Brentano believed that "psychology should have exact laws, and that the goal of psychology should be to find such laws...Brentano held that there are exact laws that refer only to the mental, and do not need to appeal to physical circumstances." In Glymour's view, while ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' "contains lively criticism", Brentano nevertheless "had no laws of any interest to propose" and when Brentano tries to produce results from his method "the product is deadly dull and nearly vacuous." Glymour considers Brentano's efforts "lame" in comparison to the work of the physician [[Carl Wernicke]], who produced a new analysis of the capacity for language.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gly91|Glymour 1991]]. pp. 47-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Barry Smith (academic and ontologist)|Barry Smith]] writes that Brentano's thesis about intentionality has "proved to be one of the most influential in all of contemporary philosophy. It gave rise to Husserlian phenomenology, but it also lies at the root of much of the thinking of analytic philosophers on meaning and reference and on the relations of language and mind. In addition, the notion of intentionality, and Brentano's use of this notion as a criterion for the demarcation of the psychological realm, pervades much contemporary philosophizing within the realm of [[cognitive science]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Smi96|Smith 1996]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Scruton commented in 1994 that none of the volumes of ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' "fulfil the promise made in the book's title", adding that Brentano eventually came to doubt that an empirical science of the mental is likely to be invented.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scr00|Scruton 2000]]. p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the philosopher [[Peter Simons (academic)|Peter Simons]], ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' "forged Franz Brentano's reputation and it remains his most important and influential single work...it helped to establish psychology as a scientific discipline in its own right. Through Brentano's illustrious circle of students it exerted a wide influence on philosophy and psychology, especially in Austria, Germany, Poland, and Italy." Simons compares the influence of Brentano's work to that of Wilhelm Wundt's ''Grundzüge der physiologischen Psychologie'', also published in 1874. Simons lists gestalt psychology and Alexius Meinong's theory of objects as additional developments related to Brentano's work, noting that "The course of the ''Psychology'''s influence has yet to be fully run." Simons comments that Kraus's notes on ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' "are frequently shrill and intrusive." Simons writes that while passages in chapter one "clearly accord mental phenomena an epistemological advantage over physical phenomena", Kraus "cannot forbear intervening several times to explain how Brentano expresses himself misleadingly, how this conflicts with other things he says elsewhere, and so on." Simons believes that the purpose of Kraus's notes is to harmonize Brentano's views in ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'' with views he adopted subsequently.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sim95|Simons 1995]]. pp. xiv-xvi.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Rabbula Gospels''', or '''Rabula Gospels''', (Florence, Biblioteca Mediceo Laurenziana, cod. Plut. I, 56) is a 6th-century [[illuminated manuscript|illuminated]] [[Syriac language|Syriac]] [[Gospel Book]]. One of the finest Byzantine works produced in [[Asia]], and one of the earliest Christian manuscripts with large miniatures, it is distinguished by the miniaturist's predilection for bright colours, movement, drama, and [[expressionism]]. Coming from a period from which little art survives, and which saw great development in Christian [[iconography]], the manuscript has a significant place in art history, and is very often referred to.

Recent scholarship has suggested that the manuscript completed in 586 was later partly overpainted by restorers and bound together with miniatures from other sources in the 15th or 16th century.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"/&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Meister des Rabula-Evangeliums 002.jpg|thumb|left|The earliest crucifixion in an [[illuminated manuscript]], from the Rabbula Gospels.]]
The Gospel was completed in 586 at Monastery of St. John of Zagba (Syriac: {{lang|syr|ܒܝܬ ܙܓܒܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Bēṯ Zaḡbā}}''), which, although traditionally thought to have been in Northern Mesopotamia, is now thought to have been in the hinterland between [[Antioch]] and [[Apamea (Syria)|Apamea]] in modern [[Syria]]. It was signed by its scribe, Rabbula ({{lang|syr|ܪܒܘܠܐ}}, ''{{transl|syr|Rabbulā}}'') about whom nothing else is known. In their current condition the folios are 34&amp;nbsp;cm (13.4&amp;nbsp;in) by 27&amp;nbsp;cm (10.6&amp;nbsp;in). Their original size is unknown because they were trimmed during previous rebindings. The text is written in black or dark brown ink in two columns of a variable number of lines. There are footnotes written in red ink at the bottom of many of the columns. The text is the [[Peshitta]] version of the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] translation of the Gospels.

The manuscript is illuminated, with the text framed in elaborate floral and architectural motifs. The Gospel canons are set in [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]]s ornamented with flowers and birds. The miniaturist obviously drew some of his inspiration from [[Hellenistic]] art (draped figures), but relied mainly on the ornamental traditions of [[Persia]]. The miniatures of the Rabbula Gospels, notably those representing the [[Crucifixion]], the [[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension]] and [[Pentecost]], are real pictures with a decorative frame formed of [[zigzag]]s, [[curve]]s, [[rainbow]]s and so forth. The scene of the Crucifixion is the earliest to survive in an illuminated manuscript, and shows the Eastern form of the image at the time.  There is a miniature of the [[Apostle (Christian)|Apostle]]s choosing a new twelfth member (after the loss of [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]); this is not an event found in the [[Canonical Gospels]] (though it is mentioned in Chapter 1 of [[Acts]]) and is almost never seen in later art.  The artist was trained in the classical illusionist tradition, and is a competent and practiced hand rather than an outstanding talent; but surviving images from this period are so rare that his are extremely valuable for showing the style and [[iconography]] of his age.
[[File:RabulaGospelsFolio04vCanonTable.jpg|thumb|250px|Folio 4v of the Rabbula Gospels showing the [[canon tables]], harmonization of the four gospels, with marginal miniatures.]]

The French Orientalist Edgard Blochet (1870–1937) argued that some of the folios of the manuscript, including the pictorial series, were an interpolation no earlier than the 10th or 11th century. Since the original [[Photo caption|caption]] accompanying the miniatures is of the same paleographic character as the main text of the manuscript, this theory was rejected by Giuseppe Furlani and by Carlo Cecchelli in the commentary of the facsimile edition of the miniatures published in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sor.cua.edu/Bible/RabbulaMs.html Miniatures from the Rabbula Gospels ms.]&lt;/ref&gt;  But doubts as to the original unity of the contents continued.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, David H. "The Date and Arrangement of the Illustrations in the Rabbula Gospels." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 27 (1973): 197-208. Web., [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1291340 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, scholars have proposed that the text of 586 was only bound up together with the miniatures in the 15th century, and that the miniatures themselves were taken from at least one other original manuscript, and come from two different campaigns of work.&lt;ref name="G.Peers"&gt;Peers, Glenn, [https://www.academia.edu/285889/Review_of_Il_Tetravangelo_di_Rabbula._Firenze_Biblioteca_Medicea_Laurenziana_Plut._1.56._L_illustrazione_del_Nuovo_Testamento_nella_Siria_del_VI_secolo_ed._M._Bernab%C3%B2_Rome_2008 Review of Bernabò] (see Further reading)&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of the manuscript after it was written is vague until the 11th century when it was at [[(Maifuc -Jbeil/Byblos Lebanon)]].  In the late 13th or early 14th century it came to [[Kadisha Valley#The Qannubin Monastery|Quannubin]].  In the late 15th or early 16th century, the manuscript was taken by the [[Maronite]] Patriarch to the [[Laurentian Library]] in [[Florence]], where it is today.

The Manuscript has served during Medieval Age as register of Maronites Patriarches (Elias Kattar) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Holy Spirit University of Kaslik {{!}} لبنان الوسيط  عهد السلاطين المماليك|url=http://www.usek.edu.lb/en/publications/phoenix/loubnan-waseet|website=www.usek.edu.lb|access-date=2017-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;,

== Examples ==
The motif involves a character who makes a promise pertaining to love for another character. The first character promises to grant the other his/her love if an impossible wish is granted. Alternately, the first character could promise the second anything he/she asks for in exchange for escape from a life-or-death situation. 

A notable example of the first scenario is [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s "[[The Franklin's Tale]]", itself partly based on [[Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Filocolo]]''; Dorigen, a married woman whose husband is absent, promises another suitor that he may have her if she makes the rocks on the coast of Brittany disappear.&lt;ref name="edwards" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clouston|first=W.

An example of the second variation is found in Chaucer's "[[The Wife of Bath's Tale]]", where the main character, a young rapist knight threatened with execution if he cannot answer the question "What do women want?," promises an older woman (the proverbial "[[loathly lady]]") anything she desires if she can provide the answer (she desires to marry him).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mann|first=Jill|title=Geoffrey Chaucer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zlX9B4etMxAC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2002|publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer|isbn=9780859916134|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wollock|first=Jennifer G.|title=Rethinking Chivalry and Courtly Love|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=orTn7RpmyZIC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=9 January 2013|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780275984885|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Salt Lake City'''" is a song written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]] for the [[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] [[band (music)|band]] [[The Beach Boys]]. It was released on their 1965 album ''[[Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)]]''. 

==Background==

"Salt Lake City" was written to call attention to the band's major fan base in [[Salt Lake City|the city of the same name]].  From 1963 until 1973, The Beach Boys performed at Utah's Lagoon Amusement Park's Patio Gardens at least twelve times, and Utah was one of the earliest places that The Beach Boys' music was played outside of California.&lt;ref name=SaltLakeTribune&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wharton|first1=Tom|title=Utah's long love affair with the Beach Boys|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/54352723-81/beach-fun-lake-salt.html.csp|website=The Salt Lake Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[KYAH|KNAK]] [[deejay]] Gene Davis said, "[Brian Wilson] remembered coming to Salt Lake, but it was not a big deal. When you talk to Mike Love, Salt Lake was big time to them. He loved Salt Lake City. But [Wilson] remembered writing 'Salt Lake City' as one of those fun songs they sat down and did."&lt;ref name=SaltLakeTribune /&gt; The song was also released as a promo single, backed with "Amusement Parks U.S.A.", by the city's downtown merchants association.&lt;ref name="Inside the Music of Brian Wilson: The Songs, Sounds, and Influences of the Beach Boys' Founding Genius"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lambert|first1=Philip|title=Inside the Music of Brian Wilson: The Songs, Sounds, and Influences of the Beach Boys' Founding Genius}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song lyrics extol the attractions of northern Utah: summer sun, winter skiing, local girls and the [[Lagoon (park)|Lagoon amusement park]]. Mike Love and Brian Wilson sing the leads vocals on the song.

==Critical opinion==

''[[AllMusic]]'' writer [[Richie Unterberger]] called the song a "subpar effort" as well as one of the "throwbacks to the empty-headed summer filler of previous days" on ''Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)''.&lt;ref name=allmusic&gt;{{cite web|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|title='Summer Days (and Summer Nights!!)'|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/summer-days-and-summer-nights%21%21-mw0000116156|website=allmusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Jim Fuselli described the track as a throwback "to the group's happy-go-lucky days."&lt;ref name=PetSounds&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuselli|first1=Jim|title=The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sheketak Group''' was created by duo Danny Rahum and Tzahi Patish in 1997. The Group's productions combine [[contemporary dance]], lively [[music]], [[video]], and [[theater]]. The group put on their shows in [[Israel]] and in around 30 other countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheketak.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the group's name is the blending of two words in [[Hebrew]]: Sheket (silence), and Tak (the creation of sound). The word "sheketak" is widely used by the group's artists in order to express rhythmic and musical phrases during a work process.

Sheketak won the "Young Creators" prize of the Ministry of Culture and Education of 2001.

Sheketak partook in various televisional and theatrical productions, such as "King Solomon and Shlomi the Shoemaker" in Habima Theater, and TV shows such as [[Kokhav Nolad]], [[Nolad Lirkod]], and [[Yair Lapid]] and [[Dudu Topaz]]'s talk shows.

The managers of Sheketak created several soundtracks and choreography for many televisional productions and commercials.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5593">'''Sociological criticism''' is [[literary criticism]] directed to understanding (or placing) literature in its larger social context; it codifies the literary strategies that are employed to represent [[social constructs]] through a sociological methodology. Sociological criticism analyzes both how the social functions in literature and how literature works in society. This form of literary criticism was introduced by [[Kenneth Burke]], a 20th-century literary and critical theorist, whose article "Literature As Equipment for Living" outlines the specification and significance of such a critique. 

Sociological criticism is influenced by [[New Criticism]]; however, it adds a [[sociological]] element as found with [[critical theory]] ([[Frankfurt School]]), and considers art as a manifestation of society, one that contains metaphors and references directly applicable to the existing society at the time of its creation. According to Kenneth Burke, works of art, including literature, "are strategic namings of situations" (Adams, 942) that allow the reader to better understand, and "gain a sort of control" (Adams, 942) over societal happenings through the work of art. 

This complicates the basic trend of New Criticism which simply calls for a close textual reading without considering affective response or the [[authorial intent|author's intentions]]. While Burke also avoids affective response and authorial intention, he specifically considers pieces of art and literature as systematic reflections of society and societal behavior. He understands the way in which these artworks achieve this to be strategically employed through the work, and he therefore suggests the standardization of the methods used by the artists and authors so as to be able to consider works of art within a social context. 

== Sociology and literature ==
===Importance===

Austin Harrington outlines in his book ''Art and Social Theory'' six ways in which art can be approached from a sociological standpoint: 1) humanistic historic approach, 2) Marxist social theory, 3) cultural studies, 4) theory of art in analytical philosophy, 5) anthropological studies of art, and 6) empirical studies of contemporary art institutions (Harrington, 15). The variety of sociological approaches introduced by Harrington confronts traditional, metaphysical approaches to art. According to Harrington, "sociological approaches generally possess a stronger sense of the material preconditions, historical flux and cultural diversity of discourse, practices and institutions of art," (Harrington, 31). 

Harrington argues that pieces of art can serve as "normative sources of social understanding in their own right" (Harrington, 207); the ways in which these sources make manifest this social understanding is precisely what is of interest to [[Kenneth Burke]]. As Harrington observes, there are several methods of regarding art from a sociological perspective, and considering the sociological element is essential because art is inevitably full of references and commentaries on the present day society. Sociological critics are then to look at exactly how such references and commentaries function within the work of art, so that codification of their method is possible.

===Employment===

In [[Franco Moretti]]'s article "The Dialectic of Fear", he addresses the methods by which [[Mary Shelley]] and [[Bram Stoker]] highlight the problems and inconsistencies within their societies through their respective novels ''[[Frankenstein (novel)|Frankenstein]]'', and ''[[Dracula]]''. Moretti notes that the fear in ''Frankenstein'' lies in the protagonist and not the reader, so as to encourage the reader to "reflect on a number of important problems (the development of science, the ethic of family, respect for tradition) and agree – rationally – that these are threatened by powerful and hidden forces," (Moretti, 12). Shelley does this, notes Moretti, by keeping the novel in the past tense, and not hiding any of the monster's qualities, but rather informing the readers totally, (Moretti, 12). Stoker, by contrast, wants to scare his readers, and so Moretti recognizes the way in which this is done: "the narrative time is always in the present, and the narrative order – always para tactic – never establishes causal connections ... the reader has only clues" (Moretti, 12). [[Kenneth Burke]] would approach these pieces of literature through their statements on society, and push for sociological critics to standardize methods like the ones employed by Shelley and Stoker as a way of regarding art as a function of, and functioning in, society – a criticism technique that "cut[s] across previously established disciplines" (Adams, 942).

===Types ===

There are many sub classifications of sociological criticism, two of the most prominent being [[Marxist literary criticism|Marxist criticism]] and [[feminist criticism]].

The '''Teatro delle Dame''', also known as the '''Teatro Alibert''' (its original name), was a theatre in Rome built in 1718 and located on what is now the corner of Via D'Alibert and [[Via Margutta]]. In the course of its history it underwent a series of reconstructions and renovations until it was definitively destroyed by a fire in 1863. In their 18th-century heyday, the Teatro delle Dame and its rival, the [[Teatro Capranica]], were the leading opera houses in Rome and saw many world premieres performed by some of the most prominent singers of the time. 
==History==
The theatre was built by Antonio D'Alibert for the performance of ''[[opera seria]]''. It was a project long planned by his father Jacques D'Alibert (1626–1713) who had been the secretary to [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] and had managed the [[Tor di Nona|Teatro Tordinona]]. The Teatro Tordinona was Rome's first public theatre but was demolished in 1697 on the orders of [[Pope Innocent XII]] who considered public theatres a corrupting influence on the populace. 
[[File:Teatro delle Dame floor plan, 1760-61.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Floor plan of the theatre in 1761]]
The Teatro Alibert (as it was then called) was constructed in wood on a piece of land formerly used for playing [[pallacorda]] (a game similar to [[real tennis]]). According to the Italian theatre historian Saverio Franchi, the architect supervising the construction was probably Matteo Sassi (1646–1723).&lt;ref name = "Franchi"&gt;Franchi, Saverio (1997). [https://books.google.com/books?id=HCUwopOtrLgC&amp;pg=PR48 ''Drammaturgia romana''], Vol. 2, pp. xxvii; xlviii. Edizioni di Storia e Letteratura {{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was inaugurated in 1718 with the premiere of [[Francesco Mancini (composer)|Francesco Mancini]]'s opera ''Alessandro Severo'', the Teatro Alibert was the largest theatre in Rome with seven tiers of 32 boxes each. In 1720 [[Francesco Galli Bibiena]] enlarged and redesigned the interior, reshaping the auditorium into a "phonetic curve" (midway between a rectangle and a horseshoe).&lt;ref name = "Nicassio"&gt;Nicassio, Susan Vandiver (2002). [https://books.google.com/books?id=poDHquurm24C&amp;pg=PA82 ''Tosca's Rome: The Play and the Opera in Historical Perspective''], pp. 81–82. University of Chicago Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Lynn"&gt;Lynn, Karyl Charna (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=eQK2AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241 ''Italian Opera Houses and Festivals''], p. 241. Scarecrow Press&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre was an artistic success but not a financial one. Matters were not helped by the [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee Year]] of 1725 when all Roman theatres were closed for the duration. Antonio D'Alibert went bankrupt and the Roman authorities put the theatre up for auction in 1726. It was bought by a consortium of Roman nobility and renamed the Teatro delle Dame.&lt;ref name = "Franchi" /&gt; The theatre's management eventually passed to the [[Knights of Malta]], with whom some members of the consortium had close links. The order was to maintain control of the theatre until well into the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Markstrom, Kurt Sven (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=GpedtmXE6tIC&amp;pg=PA137 ''The Operas of Leonardo Vinci, Napoletano''], pp. 137–138. Pendragon Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1730s, the building underwent extensive renovation and embellishment designed by the architect [[Ferdinando Fuga]] and reopened in 1738 with a performance of [[Nicola Logroscino]]'s opera ''Quinto Fabio''. 

By the 19th century, the Teatro delle Dame (like its rival the [[Teatro Capranica]]) had ceased being a leading opera house in the city. Operas were still performed there, but it was increasingly used for public balls, acrobatic shows, and plays written in the local [[Roman dialect]].&lt;ref name = "Groppi" /&gt; Prince Alessandro [[Torlonia]] acquired the theatre in 1847 and had it reconstructed in brick with an even larger stage which could accommodate equestrian shows. On the night of 15 February 1863, the theatre caught fire yet again and was completely destroyed. Later, an inn known as the Locanda Alibert was constructed on the site. In the early 2000s the Locanda Alibert building was completely restructured and turned into a congress and event centre.&lt;ref&gt;Costantini, Emilia (14 December 2005).

[[File:Teresa Bertinotti.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Teresa Bertinotti]], the first woman to sing at the Teatro delle Dame]]
Throughout most of the 18th century, women were forbidden to perform on stage in the [[Papal States]]. During that period operas were sung at the Teatro delle Dame by all-male casts with [[castrati]] singing the female roles. Amongst the famous castrato singers to appear there were [[Farinelli]], [[Giacinto Fontana]] ("Farfallino"), [[Giovanni Carestini]], and [[Luigi Marchesi]]. From 1798 when Rome came under [[Roman Republic (18th century)|French rule]], women began appearing on the theatre's stage—the first one was the soprano [[Teresa Bertinotti]].&lt;ref name = "Groppi" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Nicassio" /&gt;

'''The Art Life''' is a [[blog]] about the art scene in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] and an ongoing series of [[television]] programs broadcast by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]].

== The Art Life Blog ==

Established in 2004 using the [[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] online service, The Art Life [http://www.artlife.blogspot.com]  established itself as an independent voice of art criticism in the Australian art and media world.

Written as an [[anonymous blog]], the Art Life's irreverent tone, humorous articles, polls and lively reader discussion provide many readers with an introduction to the often obscure Sydney art world, from commercial galleries to artist-run initiatives, art events, personalities and news.

The identities of The Art Life writers and editors has been the subject of speculation [http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/10/18/1097951630879.html?from=storylhs]. In October 2004, [[The Sydney Morning Herald]] journalist Andrew Hornery reported that arts-writer [[Andrew Frost (arts writer)|Andrew Frost]] and artist [[Simon Barney]] were widely believed to be responsible. Although both denied authorship of the blog, the subsequent appearance of Frost on television as the "face" of the blog seemed to put an end to that speculation.

More recently, some contributors to the blog have been named on posts and have included [[Bonny Dot Cassidy]], [[Carrie Miller]],  [[Marcus Trimble]], [[Margaret Mayhew]], [[Ian Houston]] and [[Isobel Johnston]].

== The Art Life on TV ==

''The Art Life'' was a three-part TV series that aired on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation [ABC] in July 2007. The series was an overview of recent Australian art and was organised thematically: Ep 1 ''Out There'' looked at the context of Australian art inspired by the experience of the suburbs, Ep 2 ''Millions of Images'' surveyed the practice of photography and video art in the aftermath of Post Modernism while Ep 3 ''Always Busy Dying'' was an examination of painting in contemporary art. The series was produced by Frank Haines and directed by Brendan Fletcher. The series was written and presented by Andrew Frost.

Following the initial Art Life series, the ABC commissioned a two subsequent specials.

''A Year in The Art Life'' was broadcast on 13 November 2007 on the ABC and looked at art news from the year December 2006 through to November 2007. The special was presented by Frost and directed by Brendan Fletcher.

''The Art Life At The Biennale of Sydney 2008'', broadcast on [[ABC1]] on 22 July 2008, was a 27-minute documentary about the bi-annual international art exhibition. The program featured interviews with international artists exhibiting in the [[Biennale of Sydney]] including among others [[Pierre Huyghe]], [[George Bures Miller]], [[Dora Garcia]] and the curator of the 2008 exhibition [[Carolyn Christov-Bakargiev]]. Written and presented by Frost, the documentary was directed by [[Simon von Wolkenstein]].

In March 2009, ABC1 [formerly the ABC] aired ''The Art Life 2''. The three episodes of this second series were linked by an investigation of a single question - what is an artist? Ep 1 ''Starry Starry Night'' looked at the history of the ''idea'' of the artist, from [[Vincent van Gogh]] to contemporary artists; Ep 2 ''Who Made Who'' met and interviewed artists who explore identity as their principal subject; while Ep 3 ''Lust For Life'' was a survey of art with an explicit connection to political issues.

'''''The Parnassus''''' is a [[fresco]] painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] artist [[Raphael]] in the [[Raphael Rooms]] ("''Stanze di Raffaello''"), in the [[Apostolic Palace|Palace of the Vatican]] in Rome, painted at the commission of [[Pope Julius II]].  It was probably the second wall of the ''[[Stanza della Segnatura]]'' to be painted between 1509 and 1511,&lt;ref&gt;Raphael, Marcia B. Hall (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Raphael'', Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; after ''[[La Disputa]]'' and before ''[[The School of Athens]]'', which occupy other walls of the room.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Penny, p. 74: "The execution of the ''School of Athens'' ... probably followed that of the ''Parnassus''."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The whole room shows the four areas of [[human knowledge]]: philosophy, religion, poetry and law, with ''The Parnassus'' representing poetry. The fresco shows the [[mythology|mythological]] [[Mount Parnassus]] where [[Apollo]] dwells; he is in the centre playing an instrument (a contemporary [[lira da braccio]] rather than a classical [[lyre]]), surrounded by the [[muse|nine muses]], nine [[poet]]s from antiquity, and nine contemporary poets.  Apollo, along with [[Calliope]], the [[muse]] of epic poetry, inspired poets.&lt;ref name="Paoletti"&gt;{{cite book | title=Art in Renaissance Italy  | first1=J | last1=Paoletti | first2=G | last2=Radke| publisher=Laurence King Publishing | location=London | year=2005 | origyear=1997 | page=409 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFhVehAvVyUC&amp;pg=PA409&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=56aATbfBK4assAOIt5iNBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false |isbn=1-85669-439-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stinger"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Renaissance in Rome | author=Stinger, C | publisher=Indiana Bloomington Press | location=Bloomington, IN | year=1998 | origyear=1985 (hardback) | page=199 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-uQYq9uMoOsC&amp;pg=PA199&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yauATbaZFYf6sAOo7dGRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false | isbn=0-253-33491-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raphael used the face of Laocoön from the classical sculpture ''[[Laocoön and His Sons]]'', excavated in 1506 and also in the Vatican for his [[Homer]] (in dark blue robe to the left of centre), expressing blindness rather than pain.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Jones and [[Nicholas Penny]], ''Raphael'', p. 74, Yale, 1983, {{ISBN|0300030614}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the female figures in the fresco have been said to be reminiscent of [[Michaelangelo]]'s ''Creation of Adam,'' [[Euterpe]] and [[Sappho]], who is named on a scroll she holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Drawings of Raphael: With a Complete Catalogue | author=Joannides, P | publisher=University of California Press | location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA | year=1983 | page=20 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MsV1ZASkP0kC&amp;pg=PA19&amp;dq=Parnassus+Raphael+Vatican+Segnatura+Apollo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yauATbaZFYf6sAOo7dGRBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Parnassus%20Raphael%20Vatican%20Segnatura%20Apollo&amp;f=false | isbn=0-520-05087-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sappho is the only female poet shown, presumably identified so that she is not confused with a muse; she is a late addition who does not appear in the print by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] that records a drawing for the fresco.

The window below the fresco ''Parnassus'' frames the view of [[Vatican Hill|Mons Vaticanus]], believed to be sacred to [[Apollo]].

'''''The Wounded Deer'''''  (''El venado herido'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) is an [[oil painting]] by [[Mexican art]]ist  [[Frida Kahlo]] created in 1946. It is also known as '''''The Little Deer'''''. Through ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo shares her enduring physical and emotional suffering with her audience, as she did throughout her creative oeuvre. This painting in particular was created towards the end of Kahlo's life, when her health was in decline. Kahlo combines [[pre-Columbian]], [[Buddhist]], and [[Christian]] symbols to express her wide spectrum of influences and beliefs.

==Background==
Frida Kahlo was plagued with poor health her entire life. In 1925, she was in a bus accident that resulted in serious injuries to her entire body. Her spine, ribs, pelvis, right leg, and abdomen were particularly damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka.''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 23-26.&lt;/ref&gt; She would deal with the wounds from this accident for the rest of her life. Kahlo painted this [[self-portrait]] before an operation on her spine, which would leave her bedridden for almost a year. During her recovery, she wore a steel corset, which can be seen in her late self-portraits.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1993. Page 191.&lt;/ref&gt; Her right leg would eventually be amputated up to her knee, as a result of [[gangrene]].&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial, 1993. Page 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The variety of cultural influences reflect Kahlo's own background. She had a German father and a Mexican mother, thus she was aware of traditional European and Mexican ideas during her childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka. ''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Pages 1-10.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known that Kahlo was interested in Eastern Religion during the later years of her life.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''Frida Kahlo''. London: Tate Publishing, 2005. Pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, Kahlo married fellow [[Mexican art]]ist [[Diego Rivera]] for the second time. Their second marriage saw many of the same problems as their first, filled with jealousy, affairs, and arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Drucker, Malka. ''Frida Kahlo: Torment and Triumph in her Life and Art''. New York: Bantam Books, 1991. Page 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the time she created ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo made a drawing of a young deer in her diary, which is thought to be inspired by her pet deer, Granizo.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''The Diary of Frida Kahlo: an Intimate Self-Portrait''. New York: N.H. Abrams, 1995. Page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Wounded Deer'' was given by Frida Kahlo to close friends Arcady and Lina Boytler as a wedding gift.&lt;ref&gt;Herrera, Hayden. ''Frida Kahlo: the Paintings''. New York: Harper Perennial. Page 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
In ''The Wounded Deer'', Frida Kahlo paints herself as an animal and human hybrid. She has the body of a deer along with antlers extending from her own head. The deer is standing up, its legs extended in action. Its front right leg is elevated off the ground, as though it is injured or in motion. In the deer's body are nine arrows, creating wounds from which blood flows. The deer is in a forest; nine trees are on the right of the deer, and a broken branch lies in the foreground. Only the tree trunks can be seen in the [[picture plane]]; none of the foliage above is visible. One of the branches on the tree in the right of the foreground is severed. It is probable that the detached limb is the branch located on the ground before the deer. The broken branch is prominent, as it is given more detail by the artist than all of the forest floor. Kahlo's face stares stoically at the viewer, showing little sign of pain. Her neck and head are upright and alert. A set of deer ears emerge from behind Kahlo's own. In the background a body of water is present, which can be seen through the trees. Though the sky is bright, a bolt of lightning strikes down from a white cloud. The word "carma" ([[karma]]) is written in the bottom left corner of the painting, after the artist's signature and the year of creation. ''The Wounded Deer'' is mostly rendered with green, brown, and gray tones, as well as small measures of blue and red. The painting’s physical dimensions are very modest, measuring at only 22.4 x 30 centimeters.&lt;ref&gt;Souter, Gerry. ''Frida Kahlo: Beneath the Mirror''. Parkstone International, 2010. Page 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation and analysis==
In this painting, Kahlo shares her lifelong splanchnic pain with her audience.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann. "Three Painters with a Natural Bond; a Passion for Place and Culture Unites O'Keeffe, Kahlo and Carr". ''The Washington Post'', February 10, 2002.&lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/409252883&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New Yorhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reusing_Wikipedia_contentk: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The pain she represents is not only physical, but emotional torment caused by her relationship with husband, [[Diego Rivera]].&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New York: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to the grand murals of her [[Mexican muralism|Mexican]] contemporaries, such as Diego Rivera, [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[José Clemente Orozco]], the paintings of Frida Kahlo were small. Some critics interpret the scale of her works as a sign of isolation, which also downplays her painful circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Booker, Bobbi. "Private Kahlo Works Unveiled". ''Philadelphia Tribune'', February 17, 2008. &lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/337870948&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

It is Mexican tradition to place a broken branch on a grave. This is taken as an acknowledgement of the artist's deteriorating health.&lt;ref&gt;[[Judy Chicago]] and [[Frances Borzello]]. ''Frida Kahlo: Face to Face''. Munich; New York: [[Prestel Publishing|Prestel]], 2012. Page 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the wounds on the body of the deer, Kahlo does not paint a face of anguish, but of strength.&lt;ref&gt;Bauer, Claudia. ''Frida Kahlo''. New York: Prestel, 2007. Page 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars point out that the antlers on Kahlo's head are those of a stag, a male deer.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabelle Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dosamantes-Beaudry, Irma. "Frida Kahlo: Self-Other Representation and Self-Healing Through Art". ''The Arts in Psychotherapy'' 28, no. 1, February 2001. Pages 5-17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo is representing herself as part male and part female, as well as elements of human and animal features. This hybrid form is often explained by the artist's influence of [[pre-Columbian]] ideas and traditions, which hold the belief that the right foot is represented by a deer.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; In this belief system, days were represented by a symbol and a number. Important dates such as birthdays were used in predictions. Kahlo adopted the deer as a symbol for herself because of its connection to the right foot, and in the [[Aztec]] calendar, she was born on day nine. These two symbols together were not good, as nine was a symbol for earthly elements as well as the underworld, which was made up of nine phases.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; The number nine can be seen twice in ''The Wounded Deer'': there are nine trees in the left side, before the clearing that reveals the ocean and lightning bolt, as well as nine arrows protruding from the body of the deer. An additional nine can be seen in the points of her antlers, if counted together.

In the painting, the deer's front right leg is raised off the ground, perhaps in a reflection of Kahlo's own impairment.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time she painted ''The Wounded Deer'', Kahlo had difficulty walking, which she would attempt to correct through a spinal surgery later that year.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''The Diary of Frida Kahlo: an Intimate Self-Portrait''. New York: N.H. Abrams, 1995. Page 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some art historians believe that Frida Kahlo's decision to portray herself with male and female features is a reflection of her own sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo." The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This perception recognizes her [[bisexuality]]. Other interpretations of the figure relate the male and female elements, referred to as [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]], to pre-Columbian [[Aztec]] beliefs that hold relationships between animals and parts of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;Delgado, Marina. "The Female Grotesque in the Works of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Isabel Allende, and Frida Kahlo". The University of Texas at Dallas, ProQuest, UMI Dissertations Publishing, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of the word "[[karma|carma]]", painted in the lower left corner of the painting, is controversial. It was Kahlo's own belief that her life was planned out by destiny or fate, and therefore she could not prevent any of the difficulties she faced.&lt;ref&gt;Grimberg, Salomon. ''Frida Kahlo: Song of Herself''. London; New York: Merrell, 2008. Pages 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, her misfortune must have been caused by deeds from her previous lives.

An influence of [[Christianity]] is also integrated through reference to the story of [[Saint Sebastian]], a martyr who was tied to a tree and shot by arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Jo Ann. "Three Painters with a Natural Bond: A Passion for Place and Culture Unites O'Keeffe, Kahlo and Carr". ''The Washington Post'', February 10, 2002.&lt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/409252883&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Saint Sebastian | Biography - Christian Martyr". Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Accessed April 15, 2015. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/531221/Saint-Sebastian&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Columbian, Buddhist, and Christian symbols combine to reflect Kahlo's multi-cultural reality - a reality which also represents a spectrum of gender possibilities. Frida Kahlo renders herself with these juxtaposing features to explore the concept of the self. Through these changes, identity is seen as dynamic and complex, not a fixed state.&lt;ref&gt;Kahlo, Frida. ''Frida Kahlo''. London: Tate Publishing. 2005. Pages 42-43.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], summaries should remain between 400-700 words. Please keep rewrites within this range! (It's a summary, not a competition to see who can remember the most detail.) ---&gt;
[[Jay Baruchel]] arrives in [[Los Angeles]] to visit old friend and fellow Canadian actor [[Seth Rogen]], who invites him to a party hosted by [[James Franco]]. Jay is uncomfortable at the crowded party so Seth accompanies him to a convenience store for cigarettes. When beams of blue light come down and suck numerous people into the sky, Seth and Jay flee back to Franco's house and find the party unharmed. An earthquake strikes and the crowd rushes outside. A [[sinkhole]] opens in James' yard swallowing several attendees. Seth, Jay, James, [[Jonah Hill]] and [[Craig Robinson (actor)|Craig Robinson]] run back inside the house. Jay tells the remaining party-goers that the earthquake has destroyed most of Los Angeles. They take inventory of their supplies, set up a ration system, board up the house and await help.

The next morning, [[Danny McBride]], unaware of the crisis, wastes much of their food and water. He disbelieves what the others tell him of the previous night's events until a man outside is decapitated by an unseen creature. Tensions rise due to various conflicts including Jay and Seth's growing estrangement, and the others' skepticism of Jay's belief that the disaster might be the [[Apocalypse]] predicted in the [[Book of Revelation]]. Due to a misunderstanding [[Emma Watson]] believes the group is planning to rape her and leaves with the group's remaining drinks. 

Craig goes for water but encounters an unknown being causing him to believe Jay's theory. Jay and Seth dig through the floor and find water, but Danny wastes most of it out of spite and the others kick him out of the house. Before leaving, Danny reveals that Jay was in town two months prior but stayed at a hotel instead of with Seth because of their strained friendship. Jonah annoys Jay, who punches him in the nose. Later Jonah prays for Jay to die and is [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by a demon. Seth and James are attacked by the possessed Jonah. Jay and Craig subdue Jonah and tie him up. During an [[exorcism]] attempt Jay and Seth fight and knock over a candle. A fire starts, engulfing Jonah and the house and forcing the others outside.

James suggests driving to his home in [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] but finds his car guarded by a demon. Craig volunteers to sacrifice himself and is raptured into [[Heaven]] when the plan succeeds. The others realize they can save themselves by performing a selfless act. They are captured by a group of [[cannibalism|cannibals]] led by Danny. When James volunteers to sacrifice himself, a blue beam begins to pull him to Heaven, but when he taunts and insults Danny the beam vanishes. Danny and the other cannibals devour James while Seth and Jay run away. They encounter an enormous demonic being. Jay apologizes to Seth for his actions while the being attempts to eat them. A beam strikes Jay and he begins to ascend while Seth does not. Jay grabs Seth's hand but his presence prevents them from ascending into Heaven. Seth forces Jay to leave him behind whereupon another beam appears around Seth. The pair arrive in Heaven where they are greeted by Craig who tells them that any desire comes true there. Jay wishes for the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the band performs "[[Everybody (Backstreet's Back)]]" as everyone dances.

==Production==
Rogen and Goldberg told interviewers, "We always wanted to do a movie where people played themselves and something extraordinary happened; the initial version of the film was Seth Rogen and [[Busta Rhymes]] were filming a music video and a film respectively, on the [[Sony Pictures Studios|Sony]] lot, and Antmen attacked from the center of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1gd6yr/we_are_seth_rogen_and_evan_goldberg_ask_us/caj3yuv?context=3|title=We are Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg - Ask Us Anything|work=[[Reddit]]|date=June 14, 2013|accessdate=June 21, 2013|author1=Rogen, Seth|author2=Goldberg, Evan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is also based on ''[[Jay and Seth versus the Apocalypse]]'', a [[short film]] created by Goldberg and Jason Stone in 2007.&lt;ref name="Chitwood"&gt;{{cite web|last=Chitwood|first=Adam|title=Aziz Ansari Joins Seth Rogen in THE APOCALYPSE|url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|publisher=[[Collider (website)|Collider]]|accessdate=March 28, 2013|date=April 6, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FTh9x3i5?url=http://collider.com/the-apocalypse-aziz-ansari/157660/|archivedate=March 29, 2013|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'' Goldberg commented on influences contributing to the film, "If you drilled down to the core of what I do, it's just ripping off little bits of [[Charlie Kaufman]]. Seth and I always loved ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]''  too. And the popularity of [[reality television]] now also feeds into that idea of whether what we're watching is actually real. We thought working with our friends in that situation would be awesome because they're all comedians willing to take stabs at themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ryan|last=Gilbey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jun/06/this-is-the-end-actors-play-themselves|title=''This is the End'': why actors love to play themselves|date=June 6, 2013|work=The Guardian|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors play exaggerated versions of themselves, with only James Franco having no objections to doing what the script wanted him to do.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/06/10/this-is-the-end-stars-talk-reuniting-for-new-apocalypse-comedy/2406015/ Good friends made 'This Is the End' into a real party], USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

During production, the film was titled ''The Apocalypse'' which was later changed to ''The End of the World''.&lt;ref name="Chitwood"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aziz Ansari Joins 'The Apocalypse'|url=http://my.spill.com/profiles/blogs/aziz-ansari-joins-the-apocalypse|publisher=[[Spill.com]]|accessdate=April 9, 2012|date=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name changed to ''This Is the End'' on December 20, 2012, upon the release of its first trailer and poster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Germain|last=Lussier|title=‘This Is The End’ Red-Band Teaser Clip and Poster: Seth Rogen's End Of The World Comedy Debuts, Before Possible End Of The World|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/this-is-the-end-red-band-teaser-clip-seth-rogens-end-of-the-world-comedy-debuts-before-possible-end-of-the-world/|publisher=[[/Film]]|date=December 20, 2012|accessdate=December 20, 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D3wyLsYx?url=http://www.slashfilm.com/this-is-the-end-red-band-teaser-clip-seth-rogens-end-of-the-world-comedy-debuts-before-possible-end-of-the-world/|archivedate=December 20, 2012|deadurl=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Germain|last=Lussier|title=‘This Is The End’ Emma Stone Movies: Best Netflix Movie, End Of The World Comedy Debuts Before, Action New Movies On Netflix, End Of The World|url=http://www.emmastonemovies.com/browse-english-hollywood-emma-stone-movies-videos-1-date.html/|publisher=/Film|date=December 20, 2014| accessdate=December 20, 2014|archiveurl=http://www.newmoviesonnetflix.com/browse-action-new-movies-on-netflix-videos-1-date.html|archivedate=December 20, 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was done at the request of Rogen's ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]'' co-star [[Simon Pegg]], who wrote to Rogen in concern that ''The End of the World'' was similar to his comedy film ''[[The World's End (film)|The World's End]]'' which was also released in summer 2013 and centered around an apocalypse with an ensemble cast. As ''The World's End'' was the name of a key location in that film, Pegg felt he couldn't change the name of his film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vineyard|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.vulture.com/2013/08/simon-pegg-nick-frost-the-worlds-end-interview.html|title=Simon Pegg Didn’t Love Man of Steel's Ending|publisher=Vulture|date=February 12, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
[[File:Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, Jonah Hill This is the End Screening 1 (cropped).jpg|220px|thumb|Seth Rogen, Jay Baruchel, and Jonah Hill at a screening for the film in June 2013]]
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film holds an approval rating of 82% based on 214 reviews, with an average rating of 7.1/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "Energetic, self-deprecating performances and enough guffaw-inducing humor make up for the flaws in ''This Is the End''{{'}}s loosely written script."&lt;ref&gt;{{Rotten Tomatoes|this_is_the_end|This Is the End}} [[Flixster]]. Retrieved March 11, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a weighted average score of 67 out of 100, based on 41 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{metacritic film|this-is-the-end|This Is the End}} [[CBS Interactive]]. Retrieved July 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; On [[CinemaScore]], audiences gave the film an average grade of "B+" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.cinemascore.com|title=Cinemascore|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' gave the film a [[Academic grading in the United States|letter grade]] of "A", saying, "You could sit through a year's worth of Hollywood comedies and still not see anything that's genuinely knock-your-socks-off audacious. But ''This Is the End'' . . truly is. It's the wildest screen comedy in a long time and also the smartest, the most fearlessly inspired and the snort-out-loud funniest."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Owen|last=Gleiberman|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20687779,00.html|title=Movie Review: This Is the End|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=June 8, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian D. Johnson of ''[[Maclean's]]'' wrote, "There could be worse ways to experience the apocalypse than with a party of stoned celebrities at James Franco's house. For one thing, his epic art collection can be used to board up the cracking walls against demons and zombies. That's the [[Screwball comedy film|screwball]] scenario of ''This Is the End''...The film unfolds as a profanely funny showbiz parody. But with perfect timing, it also sends up a genre that has recently gone viral at the multiplex: the [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|apoca]]-[[Blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Brian D.|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2013/06/07/was-armageddon-always-this-complicated/|title=Was Armageddon always this complicated?|work=Maclean's|date=June 7, 2013|accessdate=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Canada's ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' gave the film one-and-a-half stars out of five, comparing the film to the interminable wait for a cancelled bus and referring to the actors in the film as "the lazy, the privileged and the mirthless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/summer-entertainment/this-is-the-end-leaves-viewers-asking-when-will-it-be-over/article12469461/#dashboard/follows/|title=This Is the End leaves viewers asking: When will it be over?|work=The Globe and Mail|last=Groen|first=Rick D.|accessdate=February 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==
When [[Evan Goldberg]] was asked whether a sequel to the film was probable, he said, "If you ask me, I'd say there's a pretty good chance of a sequel. If you ask Seth Rogen, he'd say no." In June 2013, Goldberg announced ideas for a sequel in which the apocalypse occurs at the premiere of ''This Is the End''. "Seth's a cokehead in this version, Michael Cera is a calm dude with a boyfriend, Rihanna and The Backstreet Boys are back," Goldberg said in an interview. "We have a lot of ideas: a heaven and hell for example and a [[Garden of Eden]] version where Danny [McBride] is [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/evan-goldberg-thinks-this-is-the-end-sequel-is-entirely-possible/|title=Evan Goldberg Thinks 'This is The End' Sequel is Entirely Possible|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Goldberg has stated that it would be difficult to recreate the casting conditions from the first film due to different schedules, believing them to be a stroke of luck, saying, "I honestly don't know if we could get the guys together [again]." In May 2014, Rogen posted a status of the sequel on Twitter saying "I don't think we'll make a sequel to ''This Is the End'', but if we did, it would be called ''No, THIS Is the End''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sethrogen/status/472174283360567296|title=Seth Rogen on Twitter|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attraction==
''This Is The End'' was adapted into a [[three-dimensional space|3D]] [[Haunted attraction (simulated)|maze]] entitled ''This Is The End: 3D'' at [[Halloween Horror Nights]] at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]] in 2015. The maze served as the event's first comedy-horror based attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweenhorrornights.com/hollywood/2015/att-this-is-the-end.php|title=Halloween Horror Nights Event in Los Angeles|accessdate=August 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wimbledon College of Arts''', formerly '''Wimbledon School of Art''', is a constituent college of the [[University of the Arts London]]. It is located in [[Wimbledon, London|Wimbledon]] and [[Merton Park]], [[South West (London sub region)|South West London]].

==History==

The foundation of Wimbledon College of Arts goes back to 1890, when an art class for the [[Rutlish School|Rutlish School for Boys]] was started. Between 1904 and 1920 this was housed in the [[Wimbledon Technical Institute]] in Gladstone Road. It became independent in 1930 and moved to Merton Hall Road in 1940. Theatre design was taught from 1932, and became a department in 1948. BA courses were introduced from 1974, and MA courses from 1984. In 1993 the school, which previously had been controlled by the [[London Borough of Merton]], was incorporated as an independent higher education institution, and from 1995 awarded degrees accredited by the [[University of Surrey]].&lt;ref name=qaa/&gt;&lt;ref name=ual/&gt;

Wimbledon School of Art became part of the [[University of the Arts London]] in 2006 and was renamed Wimbledon College of Art. In 2013 it was renamed Wimbledon College of Arts.

Wimbledon delivers specialist art, design and theatre courses ranging from [[undergraduate]] to [[postgraduate]], as well as providing research supervision for students undertaking a research programme of study.

It was founded in 1976 as '''Women's Art Registry of Minnesota''', a [[feminist art|feminist]] [[artist collective]]. The organization ran the influential WARM Gallery in downtown Minneapolis from 1976 to 1991.

==History==

===Early years===
WARM has its origins in the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|feminist art movement]] of the early 1970s. Gatherings in the studios and homes of [[women artists]] in the [[Minneapolis–Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] led to the beginning of the Women's Art Registry of Minnesota in the winter of 1973 with the establishment of a slide registry of women artists from Minnesota by Lynn Lockie Warkov and Susan Fiene.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=13}} The group organized their own exhibitions and gathered statistics on the representation of women in the [[Minneapolis Institute of Art]] and the [[Walker Art Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Meredith A.|title="The Enemies of Women’s Liberation in the Arts Will be Crushed": A.I.R. Gallery’s Role in the American Feminist Art Movement|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/essay/meredith-brown|publisher=Archives of American Art}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year artist [[Judy Chicago]] spoke at the [[University of Minnesota]] and the [[College of St. Catherine]] about her [[Feminist Art Program]] at the [[California Institute of the Arts]]. The next year Chicago, [[Miriam Shapiro]], and educators from the College of St. Catherine laid the foundations for WARM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klein|first1=Jennie|title=Doin' It in Public: Feminism and Art at the Woman's Building|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=132|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0129}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Mid-west Women's Artists' Conference in Michigan in 1975, attendees from Minneapolis learned about the practicalities of maintaining a cooperatively run gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moravec|first1=Michelle|title=Toward a History of Feminism, Art, and Social Movements in the United States|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2012|volume=33|issue=2|page=30|jstor=10.5250/fronjwomestud.33.2.0022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota was founded as a [[artist cooperative|cooperative]] by 37 [[women artists]] in 1976. It was the first feminist art cooperative in Minnesota.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=3}} The group was non-hierarchical, with all members serving on the organization's governing body.&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt; They registered as a non-profit on January 28, 1976. They limited the membership to 40 people, who were required to pay dues, attend monthly meetings, and spend at least 300 hours annually on activities related to the organization and gallery.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=27–28}}

===WARM Gallery (1976–1991)===
In 1976 the WARM collective established WARM: A Women's Collective Artspace (also known as the WARM Gallery) in a former millinery store in Minneapolis' [[Warehouse District, Minneapolis|Warehouse District]] in the Wyman Building at 414 First Avenue North.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=21}} In 1972 New York City's [[A.I.R. Gallery]] had become the first women's cooperative gallery in the United States. WARM Gallery was one of number of cooperative artist galleries established by women using A.I.R. as a model. The WARM Gallery hosted solo and group exhibitions by invited women artists and from its membership. Visiting artists at the gallery included the painters [[Grace Hartigan]], [[Alice Neel]], [[Joan Semmel]] and [[Joan Snyder]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=38–39}}

WARM began offering the Feminist Perspectives monthly lecture series in 1980. The program was directed by Joyce Lyon and succeeded in bringing art critics and historians such as [[Linda Nochlin]], [[Robin Morgan]], [[Lucy Lippard]], and [[Germaine Greer]] through the group's visiting artists program. The series continued until 1984.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=51–52}}&lt;ref name="Jordan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyon|first1=Joyce|last2=Erickson|first2=Elizabeth|title='The House We Built: Feminist Art Then and Now'|url=http://www.womenspress.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&amp;SubSectionID=22&amp;ArticleID=4243|work=Minnesota Women's Press|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980 the WARM newsletter expanded to the quarterly ''WARM Journal''. Designed by [[Patricia Olson]], the periodical featured fiction and poetry from Minnesota women in addition to articles on art. The journal's editorial committee was chaired by Susan McDonald, Alice Towle, Marty Nash and Elizabeth Erickson until 1985 when Phyllis Wiener took over. By 1985 the journal's circulation had risen to nearly 5000.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=58–59}} Informed by [[cultural feminism]], ''WARM Journal'' was one of the few interdisciplinary publications in the area and for a time it was the only art magazine published regularly in the Twin Cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chiarmonte|first1=Paula L.|title=Women Artists: A Resource and Research Guide|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=October 1982|volume=1|issue=5|page=A-15|jstor=27947012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''WARM Journal'' ceased publication in 1987.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=58}}

Catherine Jordan was hired as the gallery's coordinator in 1981. She became executive director of WARM the following year.&lt;ref name="Jordan"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Umolu|first1=Yesomi|title=WARM in the ’80s Then &amp; Now: Catherine Jordan on Art, AIDS, and Feminism in the Twin Cities|url=http://www.walkerart.org/magazine/2012/catherine-jordan-minneapolis-feminist-art-aid|publisher=Walker Art Center|date=July 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collective established the WARM Mentor Program in 1982. Emerging artists are paired with professionals for the two-year program. A more intensive program, the WARM Mentor Intensive Program, lasts one to three months.&lt;ref name="History of WARM"/&gt;

In October 1986, WARM hosted a national conference at the Minneapolis Plaza Hotel called "The Contemporary Women in the Visual Arts". The conference featured speakers such as [[Wilhelmina Holladay]], artist [[June Wayne]], and Janet Wolff. WARM Gallery and other galleries in the Twin Cities featured women artists during the conference. WARM also sponsored a traveling exhibition featuring artist [[Harmony Hammond]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|editor1-last=Crowe|editor1-first=Edith L.|title=WOMEN AND ART DOCUMENTATION GROUP: The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota|journal=Art Documentation: Journal of the Art Libraries Society of North America|date=Spring 1987|volume=6|issue=1|page=36|jstor=27947720|doi=10.1086/adx.6.1.27947720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conference, WARM found itself in significant debt.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=67}} Shortly after the opening of the nearby [[Target Center]] sports complex in October 1990, parking and traffic problems worsened and the gallery experienced a decline in visitors. Unable to keep up with rising rents, the board made a decision to close WARM Gallery in January 1991. They retained the non-profit and the Mentor Program, moving to an office on University Avenue in [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] before relocating to the Women's Building on Rice Street.{{sfn|Inglot|2007|pp=74–75}}

==Post-gallery era==
The Women's Art Registry of Minnesota continues to hold exhibitions for its members. In addition to its educational and professional programs, WARM maintains an online art registry of local and regional artists and publishes an e-newsletter.&lt;ref name="History of WARM"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Olsen|first1=Alis|title=About WARM: History of WARM|url=http://www.thewarm.org/about-warm/|publisher=Women's Art Resources of Minnesota|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; WARM changed its name to Women's Art Resources of Minnesota in 2010.&lt;ref name="Abbe"/&gt;

==Legacy==
The WARM Gallery provided an important exhibition space outside of mainstream venues for Minnesota women artists. It was a catalyst for economic renewal in the Warehouse District and played an important role in the development of [[arts in Minneapolis]]. WARM served as a key Midwestern node in the early [[feminist art movement in the United States]].{{sfn|Inglot|2007|p=2}}

The University of Minnesota's [[Weisman Art Museum]] held an exhibition of work from 12 of WARM's long-term members in 2006. The exhibition was documented in Joanna Inglot's 2007 book ''WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota''. The book includes a history of WARM and entries for each of the 12 artists featured in the exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gardner-Huggett|first1=Joanna|title=Review: WARM: A Feminist Art Collective in Minnesota by Joanna Inglot|journal=Woman's Art Journal|date=2008|volume=29|issue=1|pages=64–66|jstor=20358154}}&lt;/ref&gt; On WARM's 40-year anniversary in 2013, exhibitions were held at both the University of Minnesota's [[Katherine E. Nash Gallery]] and Robbin Gallery.&lt;ref name="Abbe"&gt;{{cite news|last=Abbe|first=Mary|title=Women's work, and proud of it|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/stageandarts/187324971.html|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=January 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Worthmann &amp; Steinbach''' was a Chicago-based [[architectural firm]] that was active from 1903 through 1928. It was a partnership between
[[Henry W. Worthmann]] (1857–1946) and [[John G. Steinbach]] (b. 1878)&lt;ref&gt;'''Steinbach''' was not related to [[Gustave E. Steinback]], the well known church architect from New York City and Stamford CT.&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm is best remembered for its design of large and elaborate churches in the Chicago area which were built for [[Latin Church|Roman Catholic]], [[Eastern Catholic]], and Lutheran
clients.&lt;ref&gt;[[Denis Robert McNamara]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=gDZMAFxPxwMC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=worthmann+and+steinbach+church&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ts7X5WaFcQ&amp;sig=0MKIzccgKp_kDfRD5zsn3qUIQGE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=yVD9TIf7HoPGlQe0s_CcBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=worthmann%20and%20steinbach%20church&amp;f=false Heavenly City: The Architectural Tradition of Catholic Chicago] ([[Chicago]]:[[Archdiocese of Chicago Liturgy Training Publications]], 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Worthmann and Steinbach were also active outside of Chicago and eventually built for clients in Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.

'''SKUC Theatre''' (ŠKUC gledališče) is a member of the Student Cultural Center [[Ljubljana]] (ŠKUC).

==About ŠKUC organization==
ŠKUC is one of the leading non-governmental organisations promoting [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] cultural and artistic activity in [[Slovenia]]. Its beginnings date back to Ljubljana's radical student movement of 1968, though the [[theatre]] itself was not formally established until January 31, 1972. In the late 1970s and in the 1980s, ŠKUC was one of the key supporters and promoters of [[alternative culture]]. Today, ŠKUC's main goals are to support promising young artists by including them in the cultural sphere and to organise creative spare-time activities for young people. During the past few years, the activities of ŠKUC have expanded to areas such as providing information and counselling for young people, including education, a library, archives, social affairs, prevention, sociology, humanism as well as research activities. It has also acquired the status of an association working in the public interest in the area of [[health care]].

==About ŠKUC Theatre==
The theatre section took its first steps in the late 1980s with some notable street and ambient performances. The first generation produced some of today's well-recognised theatre actors and groups. The ŠKUC Theatre again came to life in 2000 after a long period of inactivity following a significant start with street theatre. Conceptually, its work focuses on so-called 'chamber performances' with the guiding principle that such theatre involve young, professional artists as well as students of play, production and the [[drama|dramatic arts]]. The selection of dramaturgical texts is based on staging world premieres and debut performances in Slovenia, as well as texts dealing with the problems of marginalised groups in society. The annual production comprises three performances of its own production or in co-production with other groups and theatre houses. Art Manager is [[Alen Jelen]].
